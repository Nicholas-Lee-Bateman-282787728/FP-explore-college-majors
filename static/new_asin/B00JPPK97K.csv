8653017,5,B00JPPK97K,"I thoroughly enjoyed this little documentary, ""Iguanas After Breakfast"". I found it both educational and charming! Young Connor makes a fine host and adds a refreshing perspective to the explorations of San Cristobal island, in the Galapagos.

We meet animals and people, see the town, a farm, the woods, the countryside, and the seashore. I've never been to the Galapagos islands and didn't know much about them, only that they are home to certain unusual animals, which fascinated Charles Darwin. I did not have a clear picture in my mind of what these islands are really like. I learned that people live there too, more about the animals, and how lovely it is. The documentary is filmed from a very natural point of view that provides many satisfying glimpses of the island and its residents as they go about their daily lives. The narrative adds interesting snippets of history and local character. I now have a much better understanding of the Galapagos islands and what life is like there.

This is a perfect documentary for children; I am sure they will love a travel adventure with animals, nature, and another child as guide. As a former child myself, I, too, found it fun, and I also recommend it for adults who enjoy travel films and learning about our natural world.",1399852800,,1278,4.804545454545455
