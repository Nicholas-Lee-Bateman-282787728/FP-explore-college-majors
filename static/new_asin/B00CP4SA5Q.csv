Has everything that you would hope for in a good movie...action, humor, drama.
One of the best independent films I have ever seen.
Even working with a small budget the team managed to not only produce a solid story, but they captured an action packed film that leaves many big budget films beaten and left curbside.
The film is presented so professionally you forget that it's an independent film.
The fight choregraphy is awesome.
I have viewed the film twice now and look forward to adding the dvd to my collection.
Hopefully a Bluray edition will be released so that I can enjoy the movie in all its high def glory.
Keep an eye on this team of talented individuals because I know I will.

I highly recommend this film to fans of Quentin Tarantino, Guy Ritchie, Jason Statham...and the likes.",1372118400,6,825,4.612244897959184
5731874,5,B00CP4SA5Q,"Truly a great movie.  Hard to believe it was just a low budget flick...  Great writing, great acting, editing, etc.  No willie-nillie indie movie feel-good nonsense; I wish some big time directors would pay more attention to communicating the story and less to the special effects and spending a huge predetermined budget.  I grew up with Guy Ritchie and Quentin Tarantino films, this was right up my alley.  No complaints!  I can't wait to see more from this writing/acting duo.  What's in the works???",1372118400,6,503,4.916666666666667
5731875,5,B00CP4SA5Q,"The Lackey starts with a Reservoir Dogs feel, pours in some Guy Ritchie styled narration, mixes it all with a splash of Mixed Martial Arts, and then serves it to you with such a well polished rawness that you quickly forget that you are watching a ""low budget"" Indie Film.

The look of the film is quite unique and hard to explain, it's ""grainy"" without looking like your watching a twelve year old 35mm print in a dollar theater. This multiple award winning film grabs you by the collar and drags you straight down into the street where the action takes place.

The writing is spot on with a mix of wit, heart, and believability. The fight scenes feel natural and are choreographed in such a manner as to feel completely spontaneous. Kudos to Shaun Paul Piccinino and Steve Pisa for not only writing this visually striking film, but also for coordinating the stunts, which include possibly the best fight scene that takes place around a billiards table you will likely never find a comparison to.

The actors all play their roles true and with respect to the genre. The lovely Lauren Parkinson (""Phase Two"", ""In Mysterious Ways"") plays Lola, Jude's junky ex-girlfriend, who can still tug the heartstrings of our hero like a marionette handler while she spirals out of control. Orlando McGuire (""The Bloodletting"", ""Deadliest Warrior"") steps right into the spotlight as Suga Henare, the always eager sidekick to the cagey Sonny Fingers, played by Rickey Bird Jr. (""The Deadlines"", ""Phase Two"").  Two of the most unforgettable characters of the film are Big Leo, played by D.T. Carney (""John Dies at the End"", ""The Curse"") and Guy A. Grundy (""Deadliest Warrior"", ""Acts of Violence"") as Grundy. There are no shortcomings in the acting department on this one, From Shaun Paul Piccinino (""Deadliest Warrior"", ""Jinn"") who plays the infamous Jude St. Clere to Vernon Wells (""Mad Max 2: The Road Warrior"", ""Weird Science"") as Mr. Dechlan. There are a multitude of mastermind actors in supporting roles as well that bring the whole film to life and complete what just might be one of the best action films to hit the Indie screen in quite some time.

So what is the greatest aspect of The Lackey? One word, Cinematography. Ian McAleece and Jason Sanders are nothing short of genius in the way they show you the darker side of any major city. They put you in places you would never see on a tourist brochure and makes sure that you feel it gather grit under your fingernails while you witness the story unfold. This action film lives up to the action billing as well. Just when you think you can't possibly handle any more excitement, the pace slows for a moment so that you can catch your breath, take in the moonlit cityscape, and then plunges you right back in. Like a truly feared roller coaster ride, you don't know whether to raise your arms and cheer or just white knuckle the arms of your couch, and try not to get knocked out of your seat!",1371945600,6,2939,4.687984496124031
8584334,1,B00CP4SA5Q,"Could not finish watching this. Poorly developed script, poor cinematography, bad sound track. To its credit, it is a better movie than I have ever made, but then, that's why I do not make movies.",1475452800,,196,4.628571428571429

8584336,5,B00CP4SA5Q,It seems like all movies today are remakes of remakes of a remake but the Lackey brings in a fresh storyline that has 100% of your attention the whole time. Quality editing with a smooth storyline flow that leaves no loose ends in the story.,1400544000,,241,4.377777777777778
8584337,5,B00CP4SA5Q,"This is your classic action movie- lots of fights, seedy criminal underworld dealings, and a love interest.  Kind of like ""The Karate Kid"" if Daniel grew up in the bad part of town.  There's even a guy who reminded me of Mr. Miyagi.  ""Man who catch fly with chopstick accomplish anything.""",1388707200,2,289,4.627450980392157
8584338,5,B00CP4SA5Q,"This movie is action packed and keeps you on your toes from beginning to end. Definitely recommend it. It would make a great ""date night"" at home with the hubby. These indie film makers are definitely on their way to making a name for themselves in Hollywood.",1387238400,,259,4.531914893617022
8584339,5,B00CP4SA5Q,"Hilarious. A Guy Archie-like film with lots if action.  The cinematography is excellent, making you feel that it was filmed before color film.  Loved it!",1385337600,,153,5.08

8584341,4,B00CP4SA5Q,"I went to school with Shaun - the writer, producer & actor in this movie. I am glad to see it doing so well. It is defiantly rated R as the language in the movie is not for young children. Other than that a good movie.",1379980800,,218,3.760869565217391
8584342,5,B00CP4SA5Q,When i first put in the DVD i wasn't sure how the quality was going to be...But it holds up great! The action scenes are intense and the acting is good. I would recommend this for sure!,1379548800,,185,4.027027027027027
8584343,5,B00CP4SA5Q,"I got a chance to see The Lackey at the Socal Film Fest where it won the Audience Choice Award. Often it's difficult for movies to find its soul, but the director captures the ""cool"" factor of throwback action films with solid acting, fearless cinematography and biting ""street"" dialogue.

The film has a heart and draws you in. I particularly liked the different cultural crime lords like Maori mob boss, Mr Henare. Been waiting to see it again since the festival.

Edit: Got the DVD, the commentary is great lol! One of the more entertaining commentaries I've heard in awhile.",1372982400,6,578,4.77
