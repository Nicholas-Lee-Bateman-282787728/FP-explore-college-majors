6038840,5,B00FYETGVG,"When I watch a horror movie I love to have a good time and with this movie you are guaranteed to have a good time. Teddy, Popularity Killer, and Blood Brothers are also great movies and it is such a good deal that this copy comes with FOUR movies. This is horror done right by people who love horror. I hope to see more from Kevin Sommerfield and Steve Goltz because they are obviously extremely talented.",1389484800,2,405,4.342105263157895
6038841,4,B00FYETGVG,"Dont Go To the Reunion is an updated retelling of Prom Night and an homage to the slasher genre in general. The kills are ok, but the dialogue in the first half of the movie is phenomenal.  There are some flaws, but for a first time independent slasher, its pretty damn good.

Dont Go to the Reunion is definitely worth a look.  It has a Sleepaway Camp-iness to it that had me wondering what tricks were going to be pulled out for the finale, but it shines where most movies fail:  in the story.  This is Slasher Studios first feature film, but I expect great things from them in the future. (more can be found at scaretissue.com)",1384473600,,630,4.35042735042735
6038842,5,B00FYETGVG,"If you're looking for a fun movie abounding in gore and dark humor, this is one of those slashers for you. What l love about the team of Kevin Sommerfield as a writer and Steve Goltz as a director is that they effortlessly share the same vision for their films. The death scenes are unique, gory, and sometimes funny. Make no mistake- the plot has a good twist and is intelligently incorporated. Sommerfield is a creative death scene writer and shares many of his unlikable, yet highly entertaining characters with those of us with our own sense of humor in the offenses of their stupidity (Nick Sommer portrays this type of character excellently as ""Christopher""). Goltz possesses an artistic eye with his own style as a director, which complement his talent and professionalism as an editor. The cast does an excellent job of capturing and contributing to feel of 80's and 90's slashers. I wouldn't miss this opportunity to enjoy a fun and smart indie horror film.",1384387200,,966,4.790419161676646
6038843,5,B00FYETGVG,"Different, Fun and totally cool. The first feature film from Slasher Studios is a fun and retro homage to everything 80s slaher! with interesting twists and a great young upincoming cast this is sure to be the next big thing in horror.

Not being afraid to poke fun at itself while still managing to achieve a seriously slasher feel the dark humour and sometime over the top humour helps to add to the experience.  With a run time of just over 70 mins this sure is one to pick up. If you are a slasher fan or even just a horror fan hell comedy fan will enjoy this film this is oen for you.

The DVD itself is a great buy as it contains all the original slasher studios shorts and more behind the scenes footage from the making of a true cult classic.

If this was made in the 80s it would be a well loved and respected film but as it is made in this decade where we are run down by remakes people don't see that this film actually pays tribute to some of horrors best films.",1384387200,,974,4.110526315789474
6038844,5,B00FYETGVG,"Don't Go to the Reunion is as 80's as 2013 can get. From the writing to the score to the constant horror references, you would think that this movie was filmed in the 1980's and just never released until ~30 years later. It's filled with hilarious one liners and sick death scenes, and you can tell the filmmakers behind this REALLY love the horror genre. DO go to the reunion!",1384300800,,377,4.4
6038845,5,B00FYETGVG,"It is 2004 and a group of seniors decide to play a prank on one of their classmates which results in him getting into major trouble. 10 years later the group of friends receive invites to stay at the house they thought was abandoned in their hometown the night before their 10 year reunion. Upon arriving they find disturbing drawings and immediately think something isn't right. Throughout the night, people start to disappear, and suspicions begin to rise. Has their old classmate plotted his own revenge or has one of their own decided to take matters into their own hands and get rid of the class of 04?

This indie horror film directed by Steve Goltz and written by Kevin Sommerfield is the breath of fresh air the slasher and horror genre needed in the wake of remakes and endless sequels. Although the film runs 75 minutes, it is non-stop fun throughout. The film has MANY references and nods to other slasher films. Not only that but it has excellent kills, and a great cast to boot. You can really tell the cast had a lot of fun with the film and their roles. Most notable is Stephanie Leigh Rose as our lead girl Erica. Watching her in this film made me think she has all the making of a Scream Queen. We also have leading male, Spencer Harlan as Erica's boyfriend David, who brings a lot of the charm of the film, but once things begin to escalate, Harlan gives it his all. The whole cast does a great job that you can't help but love them, even the characters you're supposed to despise. When the film finally reaches its big showdown with the killer you can just feel the tension between the characters and you really see the actors losing themselves in the roles.

If you're sick of remakes, sequels, and overused found footage horror Hollywood is spitting at you, check out this great film that shows the slasher subgenre is still very much alive.",1384300800,2,1862,4.5222551928783385
6038846,4,B00FYETGVG,"Don't go to the Reunion comes to us from Slasher Studios and these guys know a thing or two about horror movies. Much like us, they have a podcast, website, and their own film projects in the works. So it's no surprise that a film about a badly treated horror fan would come from their minds. We've discussed the belabored lives of the lovers of our genre with bully's, trials, and tribulations that are only a few of the hurdles we have to overcome before people realize we are all pretty cool. And like we've discussed with Some Guy Who Kills People writer Ryan Levine and director Jack Perez, who doesn't want to kill their bully's both literally an figuratively?

That much said, this is an extremely ""no budget"" film. So there's a lot of forgiveness that goes into watching it and an undying appreciation for campiness. Trust me, when you get past all that and let yourself enjoy the silliness and bask in the glory of folks who understand a horror movie's structure as much as any rabid fan, this movie is a must. As for me, I found myself sucked into the plight of the bullies and enjoyed the whodunnit aspect so much I managed to forget the campiness. It's a fun blood covered film that reminded me of younger days watching Slaughter High on Up All Night. It's a well choreographed homage to 80s slashers that looks to have been as much fun making as watching. Well done Steve and Kevin! Give these guys a budget because I'm sure their next film will do more than just earn them a few awards at festivals.",1382918400,,1513,4.462093862815885
6038847,4,B00FYETGVG,"Awesome flick made by lovers of the slasher genre, I watched the first time and liked it, and after watching again I really enjoyed it much more. I missed a lot of the references from other movies so it was nice to catch those this time. I recommend if you like slasher films that celebrate 80's and 90's slashers.",1423353600,,314,4.338983050847458
6038848,1,B00FYETGVG,"Just finished watching this a few minutes ago... all the way through... but before I get up to grab the Advil and lament yet another waste of an hour and 11 minutes of my life... here you go:

Another truly terrible c-horror, microbudget, weekend-shoot video - terrible acting, no thrills, no scares, cliched characters, and a plot ripped right from the pages of Scream.

On a positive note, the DVD artwork is pretty cool - very retro.

** WARNING - Ignore the phony 4- and 5-star reviews, they always pop up from family and friends of the ""filmmakers"" (using the term very loosely here) when buddies get together to make c-movies...  and in this case, these guys really went all-out in asking for help, even on IMDB. **",1422576000,4,721,4.609375
6038849,5,B00FYETGVG,"Don't Go to the Reunion, the first feature from Slasher Studios, proves that the studio is one to watch out for.

A wonderful and fun homage to early '80s slashers, this film takes tropes and cliches and goes their own way with them. Full of likable characters, great deaths, and an unexpected twist. The acting is much better than most low budget slashers. A wonderful script and near perfect direction shows that these guys know what they're doing and have quite a career ahead of them.",1418688000,2,488,4.674418604651163
6038850,2,B00FYETGVG,"Needs more blood, more screen time in terms of a kill.  The dialogue is lame, the actors can't act.  I get it, it's an homage, lot of references, but it needs to be executed better.  No pun intended",1413158400,,198,4.157894736842105

6038852,4,B00FYETGVG,"Its OK sounds like a thumbs down to me. While the production values were substandard and justify a 3, the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Its a B flick, which means its got some camp (but not to the point that it becomes a comedy) and it looks and feels lo budget. The story is nothing new: revenge. Some of the characters were really obnoxious or bottom of the barrel but they manage to generate chemistry between them and to create an illusion of genuineness. I wasn't expecting the reveal at all, which is a definite plus. The ending goes campy, and I kind of wish it ended differently but it is what it is. A retro flavored slasher/revenge flick done on a lo budget and for this viewer, it gelled enough to give me a good time. I wouldn't recommend you watch this during primetime viewing hours, as the main event of a movie night or something. But if you are like me, starved for some decent horror and you don't need it to be bright and shiny then you might enjoy it too.",1400889600,,989,4.238095238095238
6038853,4,B00FYETGVG,"Kevin Sommerfield and Sasher Studios bring us another of the 80's throwback slashers in the form of (Don't Go to the Reunion) a fun and effective entry that works on all levels.

The acting was apropos the stand out actors being ""Spencer Harland"" and "" Steve Goltz"" Both of whom had backside nudity scenes and their squats obviously paid off! Don't worry guys there is plenty of female nudity as well.

The story was fun abiet clich but that was still OK with me most 80's slashers are. The gore effects were pretty well done for the budget and somewhat creative.

Included with this DVD are three short stories also by Slasher Studios ""Teddy"" ""Popularity Killer"" and "" Blood Brothers"",Teddy being the most intriguing. All in all a great purchase for slasher lovers.",1400371200,3,766,4.7443609022556394
6038854,4,B00FYETGVG,"the film makers really know there slashers. we got great kills ,each one a copy cat from slashers such as Madman, Night School, Friday the 13th pt. 2 and more. if you love fright flicks from the last few decades, this is a trip down memory lane",1398643200,,244,4.212765957446808
6038855,5,B00FYETGVG,a very fun slasher created by people who love the genre. A fun throwback that homages many 80's and 90's slasher with some solid acting and a entertaining script.,1391904000,,162,4.620689655172414
6038856,3,B00FYETGVG,"Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie a lot but... it was extremely predictable.

Being a huge Horror fan I enjoyed the murder scenes and except for one, I knew which other Slasher they were paying homage to. The acting was tolerable, some of the effects were better than others and both male and female cast show some skin.

If it hadn't been for the weak ending (very been there, done that), I would've given it 4 stars.

Recommended to Slasher fans, especially fans of low budget horror like myself.",1390867200,,503,4.5054945054945055
8619402,5,B00FYETGVG,"This was an awesome slasher movie it was refreshing. The acting was great. The lead actress was great. I loved her and all the characters were good. The story is in high school is the leading lady and the other bullies play a prank on a kid who then gets kicked out of school and ends up in a mental hospital.

  Is he back for revenge with  invitations sent out to gather all the bullies together many years later?  Is he out for revenge or what does he want. I feel they focused on the main characters while there were a lot of supporting characters. This was refreshing with slashers kind of dead I found this to be a above average slasher that I will watch more than once.

  I liked the leading best and the ending was great. Cheers!",1520035200,,738,4.2214285714285715

8619408,2,B00FYETGVG,"Seriously ... believe the title, not the hype, and don't go to this reunion. So much of what I love about a slasher film is missing here. Gore? Leslie Gore, maybe. Several miscast characters, and mediocre acting at best. The sound quality of this video is horrendous. Low-level sound requires cranking up the volume, and then spikes in the sound that make the neighbors call the cops, with no happy medium. It truly becomes unwatchable (unlistenable). At least now I know to avoid future releases from this company.",1434412800,,515,4.863636363636363

8619410,3,B00FYETGVG,"Pretty decent first film from the creators of SlasherStudios though it is nothing extraordinary. It lacks a lot of gore (the cover is misleading) and the characters aren't really special minus Erica who was amazing. Stephanie Leigh Rose kicked ass in that role and I really hope some big casting director in Hollywood sees this movie so they cast her as a final girl. The score is amazing, the cinematography and camera work is decent for such a low budget film, and sometimes the film is decent with suspense. The ending is disappointing and feels more 90's than 80's but the final lines of dialogue make up for it. Overall, not a bad flick but not a great one. Make sure to check out their new winter slasher ""Dismembering Christmas"" releasing this year!",1428019200,3,756,4.69172932330827
8619411,1,B00FYETGVG,"I would actually give this 1.5 stars. --- My overall problem w/ the film is its unsure tone and the plotting. The film aims to be a throwback to the slasher films of the 80's, yet the film feels far more self referential, a trademark of the post Scream horror films of the late 90's. Then, in terms of plotting, the film takes a while to establish the overall scenario, but once it does, it rushes through the second act. Lots of missed opportunities to develop suspense. There's a first act, a closing act, but the middle feels more like an after thought.

With that said, I could tell the people who made the film were enthusiastic. And congrats to them for getting a film off the ground - no easy task. However, at the end of the day, gotta judge the production by what is in front of me. There was obviously an idea as to what they wanted this film to be, but the overall train of thought hasn't been fully realized. My overall advice, stick to the guiding principal of what your overall idea is for the film even if that means editing some ideas that you like.",1423612800,,1065,4.298507462686567
