8612960,3,B00F878K7U,"This documentary is NOT about the birth of hip-hop, nor sampling. If fact, you're nearly 50 minutes into it before anything substantial about hip-hop is mentioned. This documentary is really about producer Michael Viner and his career, specifically the formation of The Incredible Bongo Band. Time is also spent featuring the members of the group. The song ""Apache"" is highlighted and that's the only connection in this documentary to hip-hop. If you're looking for a documentary about Michael Viner and The Incredible Bongo Band, this is it! For what it is, it's well made. Good production, good interviews, and good narration by Gene Simmons. I actually learned a few things. However, to actually learn about the birth of hip-hop, as well as sampling, look at other documentaries.",1498262400,,782,5.165354330708661

8612965,3,B00F878K7U,not what its advertised to be. Its really about one guy who was kinda slimy and didn't seem very nice and accidentally helped create hip hop through his greed.,1432512000,,159,4.517241379310345
