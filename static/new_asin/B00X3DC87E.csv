8714921,4,B00X3DC87E,A 1930s western in black and white. However a decent film for the era with  a sound performance by Warner Baxter as the hero.,1439078400,,125,4.208333333333333
8714922,4,B00X3DC87E,I have seen this one before. Great acting by the whole cast.but warren Baxter was much to old for the main actor. But he was great.the real bandit was 19 years old at the time he went out for payback for the murder of his wife and kids.cal.rangers chanced him for 6 years and still do not know if they him or not.none of them knew what he looked like. If they really got him he would been. 24 or 25. at the most. But they never knew what he looked like.at that time all Mexicans looked the same.  So the robin hood of Eldorado got away and no one will know.so he will live forever.  Joe,1435449600,2,586,4.0
