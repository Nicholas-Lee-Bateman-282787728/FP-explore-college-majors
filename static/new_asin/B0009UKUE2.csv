8066697,3,B0009UKUE2,"My family and I play ""Shout Out About Movies"" every Christmas, but we've played all 4 DVD's already. I heard this game was similar, but it was just ok. The product itself was great though and I received it on time and in great condition.",1357344000,,237,4.288888888888889
8066698,2,B0009UKUE2,"We are huge ""Shout about Movies"" fans and traditionally have 20-30 friends and family who play ""SAM"" on Christmas evening.  I was soooo dissapoined this year to see that they did not come out with a new one.  So, I purchased DVD Trivia games.  While the questions are good and a bit tougher than ""SAM and Scene It"", the technology was greatly inferior and not near as diverse and fun.  I'd recommend it if you really like tougher movie triva (particularly horror movies and other B movies...not your traditional higher quality better rated movies), but otherwise, it's worth repeat play of Shout About Movies.",1231027200,,609,4.826923076923077
8066699,5,B0009UKUE2,"We recently purchased the playback game and love it.  The game has provided for some wonderful family time, as well as, fun when our friends come over.  We are hoping that this company continues to put out new titles.  The other dvd trivia games that we have played are not really ""dvd"" games.  The playback game comes on one dvd and nothing else is needed.  Simple - and I like that!",1198713600,,384,4.352112676056338
8066700,1,B0009UKUE2,"I am very dissapointed in this game, it has low production values and honestly, you can't play it more than once.  It reused several of the trivia questions from the first game when we tried to play it a second time (dumb but we wanted to see if all the questions were as stupid).  But the most irritating thing was that a lot of the questions were really trivial, I know that's the point, but it was to the extent that the game wasn't fun.  There were six of us (4 of us watch a lot of movies) and we were all stumped for 80% of the questions because they were movies that I had never heard of.  One question was from the strait to video movie with Mandy Moore, ""A Walk to Remember"" that I had watched on cable (I still couldn't answer the question).  Other questions included stuff you would not know unless you read gossip sites specifically about the movie.  Don't waste your money on this DVD/Trivia game.

Shout About the Movies (Hasbro) is much better, I've played this at two different parties, there are movie clips, sound clips, etc... and an actual person narrating/hosting the whole thing.  You can play with two people or get into teams.  The best thing is that all of the questions can be answered if you've watched the movie and are movies you might have seen.  Plus Hasbro sells them on its site for $8.99 each.",1164585600,4,1327,4.3795918367346935
8066701,1,B0009UKUE2,"After reading the 2 reviews, I was very excited to receive this game. We have Scene It (too many repeats) and Shout About Movies (play it once and your done, not worth the money)and were not totally satisfied, but they were fun enough for the time being. The box that my game came in was damaged, so that might be the cause, but the game did not work properly. We couldn't get past the first round. The screen kept going back to the menu, not of the game but the dvd player. Then the game would start from the beginning with the same catagories and questions. We tried it in more than one player with no luck. I'm returning it in hopes that if we get another, it will work correctly and I can write a new review. However, at the moment, I'm very disappointed and have to wait longer for a replacement to arrive. I wonder if anyone else had this problem or if it was damaged in  shipment.",1155686400,,887,4.2176470588235295
8066702,5,B0009UKUE2,"I purchased the PlayBack game for a party, and it was a HUGE hit.

We planned on playing one game, but ended up playing it all night.  One of the many things that I liked about the game was not having to keep track of how many questions I got right.  The game actually kept score for us.  NICE feature.  I can't wait until the next title.

5 Stars!!!!!",1118361600,5,352,4.028985507246377
8066703,5,B0009UKUE2,"This title is cool.  Don't confuse it with the competition.  Unlike ""Scene It"", PlayBack does not need a board to play, and it outshines ""Shout About Movies"", because it allows for up to four players/teams!  It even keeps score and can determine ties.  This is the ultimate party trivia game.  It also plays neat movie facts, just like those old Coca-Cola Screenplays in the movie theaters.",1118016000,7,390,4.848484848484849
