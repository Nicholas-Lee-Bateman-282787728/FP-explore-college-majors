3430130,5,B00199PP6U,"Years before Firefly, there was a one-season wonder of a Space Western. A brief but glorious run led to a fandom that persists to this day. This underrated little gem would make a fine live-action movie, but until then, we have this collection.

To say GR is a cult classic is understating things a bit. It's in the top 100 cartoon section at fanfiction.net, it has a surprisingly dedicated fanbase (despite our small size), and plenty of critical acclaim from anime fans despite an American origin. It was groundbreaking at the time for its integration of CGI and cel animation, the casting of character actors for voice talent, its nascent use of mytharc structures, and its better-developed character and story structure than its toy-advert peers.

It took over 20 years, three production companies and...let's face it...plenty of groveling by fans like me in order to get this done. Kosh really went out of their way to do this right. Commentary tracks are on the high-end episodes; Christopher Rowley is awesome at deadpan snark, Henry Mandell has a lot to say about the challenge of voicing so many characters, and Robert Mandell sticks mostly to comments about production hell). There are bonus features of artwork and notes about the ships and technology.

Oh, and there are music tracks. The music was an early outing of John van Tongeren (composer for the 1990's Outer Limits, Thelma and Louise, and The 4400) and Peter Wetzler, with tracks sung by rockers Steve Overland and Myles Hunter. Yes, it's 80's rock - AWESOME 80's rock.

Like any 80's series, it has its share of cheese and a couple of true stinkers. most Rangers fans will tell you that ""Mothmoose"" is mind-bogglingly bad, and anything starring Buzzwang is best watched with your MST3K filters on. What makes up for it are dramatic entries like ""Psychocrypt,"" ""Scarecrow,"" and the Supertrooper duology (the latter half being a loving homage to Clint Eastwood flicks).

Highly recommended to Children of the 80's, anime watchers, animation history buffs...and ESPECIALLY Browncoats. I wouldn't have become a Firefly fan if it weren't for this and Saber Rider.",1287532800,12,2130,5.005649717514125
3430131,5,B00199PP6U,"I was extremely happy to discover that they had finally released the complete collection of the GALAXY RANGERS besides the 4 DVDs released a couple years ago.

This cartoon shown on weekdays in the late 80s was IMO one of the most underrated and ahead of its time cartoons at the time.

With an actual story, character development and backstories, interesting support characters and universe, surround sound, computer graphics, etc.......I could go on and on. It wasn't just for selling toys.

I loved this show so much that I actually kept my BETA player around just so I could watch the episodes I recorded.

If you appreciate animated series and science fiction.....you will not be disappointed in this series.",1260230400,2,713,4.966386554621849
3430132,5,B00199PP6U,"Wow, I had almost lost hope this series would be released, I did not live in the US for a while so I totally missed the previous (and crappy out of order) release of individual DVDs, but when I saw this on Amazon I had to get them... and I am not disappointed at al. This series is more interesting than its peers of the time, it is not up to modern standards but it is still very worth your time if you are ok with watching older animation. But this show was actually farmed out to Japan (one of the first I believe) so the animation is also better than the average show of the time and has anime touches to it. Hopefully someone will pick this up and make a new cartoon series with as much love and budget as the Justice League or the spectacular spiderman. The potential is definitely there and Firefly just further proved that space cowboys is a concept that is appealing and works, they just need to put more complexity to the characters already there to be more in line with modern cartoons (sorry, I do not count spongebob, johnny test or any of the current half drawn half scripted garbage they make kids watch these days). I wish they had commentary with some of the voice actors besides the same 3 guys all the time. Do not skip this one, if you are short on cash rent it but I would strongly suggest you buy this it is a classic you will want both volumes in your collection.",1250294400,2,1386,4.214285714285714
3430133,5,B00199PP6U,"Don't you dare pick up volume 1 without picking up volume 2, as well.  Some of my favorite episodes are in this package.

As I was saying...

Mature viewers, such as my friends and I, weren't the intended audience. On the whole, the writers actually wrote up to their viewers, as opposed to everyone else at the time, creating 30 minute toy commercials, and writing down to them.

Reclaiming a lost wife, coming to grips with a past life, and other advanced storylines ran through the series like a golden thread, in stark contrast to the childish and predictable plots in other cartoons at the time.

So many great characters, and great stories. I've already watched, and rewatched every episode that delt with the Super Troopers, and some of Goose's other issues. I wish the character of Niko had been explored furthur, but I'll take what I can get.

I was surprised to see this collection finally come to light. No, that's wrong, I was extatic. This isn't a shoddy slap together product, either. It's crammed full of artwork, info, and bonus materials on the DVD itself.

What's more, you can play the 'Galaxy Rangers theme', and 'Rangers are forever', until you can't see straight. All these years, and those songs are still hardwired into my brain. Yes, the cartoon had fantastic music, as well.

So, why are you still reading this? Show some support, and maybe a future movie or two will be based off of a good cartoon for a change.

No guts, no glory!",1248393600,5,1458,4.642023346303502
3430134,5,B00199PP6U,"For me, Galaxy Rangers is the best animation ever. I have been, for years, hoping for the launch of the complete series in VHS and, later, in DVD.

A must have.",1243728000,4,315,4.962264150943396

3430136,5,B00199PP6U,"I used to watch this when I was a kid, and it is a blast to watch it again. Not super by today's standards, very campy and stuff, but still fun to watch, especially for fans of the series. And the video/audio quality are excellent, far above what I expected.",1220400000,6,258,4.18
3430137,5,B00199PP6U,"Koch Vision and Gaylord Productions presents ""ADVENTURES OF THE GALAXY RANGERS: THE COLLECTION VOL. 2"" (1986.1989) (774 mins/Color) (Dolby Digital) --- The final 33 episodes of anime space western ""Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers"" are included in this volume, featuring the voice work of Jerry Orbach (LAW & ORDER) and Corrine Orr (SPEED RACER) --- Created by the famed anime studio Tokyo Movie Shinsha, the series follows a quirky team of intergalactic rangers who fight for justice on the frontiers of the future.

In 2086, two peaceful aliens journey to Earth seeking our help. In return, they gave us the plans for our first hyperdrive, allowing mankind to open the doors to the stars. We have assembled a team of unique individuals to protect Earth and our allies. Courageous pioneers committed to the highest ideals of justice and dedicated to preserving law and order across the new frontier --- The Adventures of the Galaxy Rangers (1986-1989) was an animated Space Western television series created by Robert Mandell and Gaylord Entertainment Company. The series combined sci-fi stories with a typical wild-west-""feel"", elements of a space opera and with the traditional fantasy elements of sword and sorcery. It was one of the first anime-style shows to be primarily created in the US, although the actual animation was done in Japan by the famed Tokyo Movie Shinsha, and at the time it was aired, it was a revolutionary children's show --- When the series originally aired, episodes were aired five days a week until all sixty five episodes were shown, with the episodes largely being aired out of order.

Under the production staff of:
Robert Mandell - producer & created by
Abe Mandell - executive producer
Bob Chrestani - producer
Eleanor Kearney - associate producer
Phil Galdston - Original Music
John Van Tongeren - Original Music

Story line set after the year 2086, when two aliens from the planets Andor and Kirwin travelled to Earth to search for allies against the ruthless and expansionist Crown Empire led by the Queen of the Crown. In return for the help, mankind was given construction plans for an FTL-drive (hyperdrive). After this key-event in human history, interstellar travel flourished and a huge number of colonies were built on distant star-systems. Alongside the growth of human activities in space, criminal activities also grew and the new colonies had to be defended against various threats, including the Crown Empire. BETA (Bureau for Extra-Terrestrial Affairs) was founded to cope with these tasks, the ""Ranger""-division being a part of it. Most of the colonies portrayed in the show are either specialized in agriculture (by growing genetically engineered crops or breeding genetically engineered cattle) or mining star stones. Many of the planets have names that evoke Western settings; Nebraska, Mesa, Ozark, Prairie.(From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia)

I would have liked to see more stories and with a final build up to the final downfall of the evil queen. ""Nimrod"" is my favorite villian. (notice the corny name) There are many great stories here with a positive theme to take pride in yourself, do your best, and never give up. I would love to also see ""The Bionic Six"" series come out on DVD. That was another great series of story telling!",1409270400,,509,4.257731958762887
3430166,5,B00199PP6U,"(What does BETA stand for, and what is BETA?) BETA stands for Bureau of Extra Terrestrial Affairs. Moreover, BETA is like our United Nations here on earth; inclusively, its members are from different ""other worldly"" cultures as well.

(What are the Galaxy Rangers?) They are a para-police or para-military law enforcement organization based upon the past lore and glory of the Texas Rangers. More importantly, they are the enforcers/peacekeepers of BETA.

(Who are the Galaxy Rangers?) Their is a special segment of the Ranger Corps that utilizes a cranial device that enhances their individual and personal attributes. These Rangers are: Zachery Foxx, Shane Gooseman, Niko (the only woman on the team), Dr. Walter Hartford, Waldo Zeptic (an Andorian), and Zozo (a Kiwi).

(How was this series produced?) INITIALLY, it was decided that this entire production would not be associated with a toy line; in fact, I only saw them on a child's lunch box being offered at a grocery wholesaler where I often shopped back in the late 80's. MOREOVER, unlike other animations of the 1980's, the artwork was rendered first. Then, the voice actors were flown to Japan to do the sound recordings. As a base of reference, they viewed the artwork first which guided their recordings. This technique was a vast improvement in the production of later animations. LASTLY, in 1983 to 1986 dollars, the entire production cost $65 million dollars or $1 million dollars per episode.

(How well did I enjoy this series?) When they first aired in the autumn of 1986, I would wake up every weekday morning at 5 am in order to watch them at 5:30 am. To me the Rangers were very special; I've been a devotee ever since.

(Is this purchase worth your money?) If you like the military, special forces, and ""other worldly"" cultures, along with a mixture of merriment ;then, you shall like/enjoy this production. Also, this production had one of the hottest sound tracks ever recorded, which some of the tracks have been included with this offer.
Purchase both volumes, you won't be disappointed.",1408924800,,2064,4.971014492753623

3430187,5,B00199PP6U,"This a great for fans of the show. I have watched most of the episodes on tv back in the day but was pleasantly surprised by the ones that I have missed. The episodes are in the actual order so you'll get to watch the story as the creators meant for them to be aired. Both Vol. 1&2 have these detailed booklets of bios of the characters (Vol. 1) & info on the technological equipment (Vol. 2) used in the show. Definitely more than just your average silly repeated pictures & listing of episodes that other DVD collections provide. Certain discs have extra commentaries from the writers for selected episodes. The animation is consistent throughout the series & the episodes are packed with music, even additional pop songs. There is also an extra feature in one of the discs in Vol. 1 that has complete tracks of songs featured in the show. I highly recommend this to all fans & anyone who is looking for a show of great imagination, action, music & depth. They truly don't make shows today like they used to.",1318032000,,1010,4.494565217391305
3430188,5,B00199PP6U,"It was 1986.  I remember that year well, because it was the same year Star Trek: The Next Generation hit the syndication airwaves. To make a long story short, the producers wrote more adult material and didn't appeal to the lowest common denomenator.  That's why there was never a great toy line based on the characters.  There was one. However, it was more popular overseas.  This second volume has interviews with two of the writers and the show's main producer.  You won't be dissapointed with Robert Mandel and his talk about how they struggled to stay on the air. The only parallel they share with Star Trek; was the 65 episodes became popular after they left the air.

If your a fan of animation and science fiction adventure; Galaxy Rangers is a sure bet. Most veiwers don't know that the lead ranger was voiced by Jerry (Law and Order) Orbach. That alone made me want to check out this incredible show.",1304553600,,910,4.62111801242236
