8572344,2,B00BQ0UNLE,"I was disappointed  to find that the DVD set is homemade job.
The disc are not labeled excepted with a 1, 2 and setting loose in the DVD case, as there is only a slot for one DVD. Not what I was expecting based on the product description.
The sleeve insert for the cover is to small showing holes in the body of dvd case.
I really wish the disc were properly labeled.",1472083200,,367,4.027397260273973
8572345,5,B00BQ0UNLE,Heritage USA  will make you emotional at times when you watch this video tour. To think that there was once a happy place where Christians young and old could enjoy fellowship In a Paradise such as this .,1427068800,,204,4.368421052631579
8572346,5,B00BQ0UNLE,I am a big fan of parks and PTL history and this DVD is a complete tour of the grounds as it was after the fall.  I really liked it becuase I was able to put a visual with the books I have read about HUSA.  It's really insane to see how the place has just sat there for years and rotted.  I'm glad I got to see this before a lot of it was torn down.  The audio CD was especially amazing becuase to hear Jim Bakker talking about what was being built and hear bulldozers in the background made me feel like I was there.,1362614400,,517,3.803738317757009
