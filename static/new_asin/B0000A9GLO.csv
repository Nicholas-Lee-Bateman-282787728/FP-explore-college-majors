If one wants to follow history of Linux and struggle of software developers for recognition of their effort to make software easy available to creative people around without artificial and often difficult to explain restrictions, should watch this film.",1386201600,,303,5.7555555555555555
1903974,5,B0000A9GLO,A great documentary on linux and GNU. You get a lot of different sides and stories. It covers a lot of ground from Linux vs Microsoft to the linux or linux-GNU debate.  Overall its a documentary that I watch over and over and let people borrow all the time.,1383523200,,257,4.244897959183674
1903975,4,B0000A9GLO,"I thought it was cool to finally meet Linus Tarvalds! I never know what open source meant, until I watched this video. I always hear open source in reference to being free. But, it means the source code that was used to build the operating system----IS FREELY AVAILABLE for anyone to look at, modify, and use!!!! So, now I understand the purpose of open source, and why Linux is so much appreciated. It was cool to see all the people and hear their opinions of what legal rights they believe we all are entitled to as software consumers. Hay, you paid for the hardware... so why should you also pay for the software too? Open source!!!!",1382745600,,636,4.491379310344827

1903977,4,B0000A9GLO,"There are two (2) DVDs, the first contains audio commentary, trailers, a music only audio track (which I fail to see the point in having that).  It's in 2.35:1 letterbox picture format as well.  Also a few other things not too interesting at least to me.  The second DVD has extended interviews which total a little over an hour (70 minutes).  A still image gallery, Biographies, document files with 113 writings about Free Software & Open Source, same letterbox format (2.35:1).

It is CSS encryption free so it's not encumbered by restrictive patents so you are allowed to watch it where you want how you want.

The run time is about 85 minutes (so almost an hour and a half).

My single complaint is the lack of subtitles at all.  Which I'm rather surprised and disappointed that it was not included.",1364860800,,803,4.6453900709219855
1903978,5,B0000A9GLO,Revolution OS is a great documentary on the history of computing OS with a particular focus on Linux. A must see for anyone with an interest in the early days of computers.,1354406400,,172,4.40625
1903979,5,B0000A9GLO,"The quote I used in my title is the opening clip in this documentary. Right off the bat hearing this you know your about to learn about something interesting.

There are many movies and documentaries created about Microsoft and Macintosh, not so much about Linux. As a life long Windows OS user, I knew little about Linux and it's history. I'm sad to say I didn't even realize that the Linux OS and Open Source Software were even connected by the same people. Revolution OS contains a wealth of info about the creation of Linux and it's impact on the computer world.

This documentary takes you on the twenty year history through the creation of Linux. It's actually narrated by the people who worked on the operating systems development, such as Richard Stallman and Linus Torvalds. You can't get better than hearing the history of the operating system than from the programs authors themselves.

Revolution OS goes into more than just the development of Linux. It talks about the GNU Project, the free software movement, open source code, etc. It shows how all these are tied into the creation and growth of Linux. It explains how heart of the Linux OS/GNU Project is to get good open source code software into the hands of everyone, who then can change the code to improve it. The idea being positive growth in numbers of people using the software by letting everyone have the ability to access the source code to turn the program into exactly what they need, and then redistributing it to even more users.

While this film will be most enjoyed by those of us who take pride in the term ""computer geek"", it can be understood and followed by most audiences. A great lesson in the history of the Linux operating system.",1318204800,,1720,4.666666666666667
1903980,4,B0000A9GLO,"Audio quality: No problems noticed. Everything perfectly audible. Stereo.

Video quality: Has one problem that I've noticed: It's letterboxed, not true widescreen. Meaning the black bars at the top and bottom of the screen are actually part of the video, not added by your playing equipment. This won't make any difference if you watch it on a 4:3 'square-screen' TV, but if you try to watch this on a 16:9 widescreen TV, as I did, then black bars will be visible on all four sides. Why? Most other DVDs use true widescreen, why not this one? Other than that, the video's perfect. Colors are vivid and the picture is clear, no compression artifacts or anything.

Annoying stuff: None except for a short 'do not copy under penalty of law' warning (Kind of ironic considering that the freedom to copy and modify copyrighted stuff is so important to the subject of the movie :). No forced advertisements, no region coding, no CSS encryption.

1903981,5,B0000A9GLO,"I liked this movie! But I am being biased, since the director J.T.S Moore added my small scene with me at the Linux Instal Fest, helping my co-worker Fernando at Intel install Caldera 2.1 on a Dual Pentium Pro White Box we built, using a 3D labs Video Card, with a Permedia Chipset which required a glint driver update on the X server XF86. The ironic thing is that Fernando is much more proficient with Unix, Solaris in particular, and had worked at Sun as a WAN engineer, and was the one who taught me how to install Solaris and configure it.",1310256000,,544,4.3431372549019605

1903983,4,B0000A9GLO,"A decent insight into the history and minds of those who started the GNU/Opensource revolution dating back to the late 70's. Being an Opensource fan myself, I found the documentary interesting...however I do find the totalitarian approach to opensource (i.e. no intellectual properties at all) to be a bit short-sighted. I, for one, feel that open and closed source softwares can coexist just fine.

I agree that some of Microsoft's tactics were a bit underhanded over the years, but one cannot deny the importance of Microsoft's role in the popularity of computing in general. Opensource plays a huge role today and in the future, but it does owe something to MS.

Oh yeah... Stallman is either waaay to smart for his own good or simply retarded.

It was kinda cool because I actually participated in some of the code editing back in the late 90's mentioned in this film.",1266624000,,872,4.8389261744966445

1903987,4,B0000A9GLO,"Revolution OS is a reasonably-accurate snapshot of the Open Source movement at a particular moment in time. It presents some of the major participants and their philosophies and stories, focusing on the breakthrough to public awareness and commercial acceptance of Open Source software in general and the Linux operating system in particular. The differences between the Free Software ethos and the marketing-friendly Open Source approach is also explored in some depth. Many other aspects of the Free Software, Open Source, and Linux stories get only cursory treatment, and therefore the documentary is neither balanced nor good evangelism. While this is regrettable, the interested viewer can follow up by reading the books and essays available from many of the people profiled, including Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and Eric Raymond.

There's still plenty of room for a more definitive documentary, but Mr. Moore should get credit for being the first to give the public at large a glimpse of some of the people behind the Open Source phenomenon. Even those who will, like me, learn nothing new from this film will enjoy the chance to see and hear people who have had a profound impact on their life but who they have only ""met"" online.",1185926400,,1244,5.12807881773399
1903988,5,B0000A9GLO,"A wonderful documentary about the GNU movement and birth of Linux. Some hard to find interviews and recordings of some key events. The documentary has been very well prepared, with all necessary details in place.
I read Eric Raymond's Cathedral and the Bazaar straight after the book, which led me to rethink my business model. I would recommend it to all young entrepreneurs.",1183420800,2,376,4.984126984126984
1903989,5,B0000A9GLO,Great movie. Wow the part about Cygnus was wonderful. The Open Source movement misses the point on freedom but that is an idealogical debate that movies like this are bound to spark. The producer was on TLLTS in about episode 179 or so and that was sooo good. I heard about the movie from google first and downloaded parts of it but I did actually buy it before the guy was on TLLTS. The Linux Code movie is also being pirated and I learned of and got it from google video now I want to buy it but it seems the company has gone belly up already. Free media and software companies need to do well and we need them to do very well. We need this stuff. The point of GNU FREE is not free as in cost. It is not even about better quality. The point of GNU FREE is not about making the rich CEOs of Red Hat and Novel even richer. It is FREEDOM FREEDOM all the time and in every way. All of the other points are just tools to acquire and spread that FREEDOM. BUY THIS MOVIE!,1173312000,2,966,4.010362694300518
1903990,5,B0000A9GLO,"I'll be upfront: one reason I like this documentary is that J.T.S. Moore included some of the photographs I contributed. In any case, the movie is a valuable historic record, showing many of the prominent figures in free and open source software in a direct way. They tell us how they see things in their own words, which you don't often get to see.

Even as something of an insider, I didn't expect the film to be as interesting as it turned out to be.  You don't normally think of computer geeks as feature film material and I'm still surprised that it ever got made, much less sold on Amazon. Kudos to Moore and his team for giving us a very watchable film as well as a historic document.",1170720000,,691,4.348837209302325
1903991,3,B0000A9GLO,"This movie is mostly interviews about free software philosophy, open source philosophy, and the rise of linux in the business world. I found the film dull, and I am a linux geek. I do give it three stars because I can see where some may be entertained or informed by the discussions the interviewer had with Stallman, Torvalds, etc. My wife now better understands why I wear a tux hat :) I also enjoyed watching Stallman's manerisms and listening to him speak, since I've heard that he may have Asperger's Syndrome (as does my son, which is why that interested me).",1138320000,,565,4.603960396039604
1903992,4,B0000A9GLO,"This documentary uses interviews to trace the origins of Linux, and in the process, it provides an interesting insight into the open source movement and its philosophy.

Richard Stallman, founder of the GNU project, is featured prominently throughout the film. (GNU is a set of applications that provide a UNIX-compatible framework.) He explains how GNU was developed through the open source environment, an environment where code can be taken, modified, and shared, but it cannot be made proprietary. He also explains the development of the GNU General Public License which prohibits developers from making the code proprietary.

During GNU's development, Linus Torvalde, was developing a kernel--which was just the piece that was missing from the open source environment. (A kernel is use to allocate resources to other applications.) This kernel became Linux. As Stallman said, it would take years to get GNU and Linux to work together smoothly, but eventually things would take off. Although Linux started in 1991 with 10,000 lines of code, it might have remained a hobbyist's OS, if it had not been for the Apache web server. Apache became the 'killer app,' the business case for buying Linux. (There is an interview shown with Brian Behlendorf, president of the Apache project.) By 1998, Linux had 7.5 million users and companies like Red Hat were contributing to its growth by selling distribution and support.

This film also shows the tug-of-war between Microsoft and open source proponents. Eric S. Raymond, author of The Cathedral and the Bazaar, describes some differences between the proprietary and open source environments, and he explains how his book was one of many influences on Netscape's decision to release their source code.

You will see interviews with Michael Tieman (co-founder of Cygnus Technology) and Larry Augustin (co-founder of VA Linux). The interview with Bruce Perens, author of Open Source Definition, is interesting. It is used throughout the film to frame the GNU and Linux development stories within the open source context. Also, as Perens lists the 'rights' of open software, one senses that the open source philosophy is one that has been seriously thought out.

Overall, this was an interesting documentary. However, I'm giving it only 4 stars because I found the segment at the end (where Torvalde and Augustin were speaking) to be very tedious. It didn't add to the content and it seemed more like personal 'grand-standing.' Still, I'd recommend this film to anyone who is interested in computer history or is looking to get a better understanding of what the open source movement is about.",1129939200,22,2636,5.2075471698113205
1903993,3,B0000A9GLO,"One of the sidestories of this movie is pitting the open source guys (Torvalds, Raymond, etc) against the Free software guys (Stallman,Tiemann).  In the movie, the open source guys always seem to be coming out on top--bigger IPOs, more money, more prestige.  A typical scene: Stallman is onstage trying to explain why ""free software"" is the preferred nomenclature, when one of Torvald's kids comes out and totally steals the scene by toddling across the stage, all cute and cuddly.  All eyes on Torvalds--while Stallman valiently presses on, talking to a roomful of people who are too busy cooing over the toddler to listen to him.

However, after re-watching this movie after several years, what stuck me is how subsequent events turned out.  All the free software guys are basically doing better than ever, whereas the Open sourcers have all had to reinvent themselves several times.  Perens has wandered from company to company.  Larry Augustine's VA linux was the biggest boom an the bigest flameout.  Poor Eric Raymond can only watch his influence slip away bit by bit, as he issues ever more bizzare screeds in some desperate search for relevance.

Its fashionable in certain circles to dismiss Richard Stallman as being some sort of ideological nut-job, but lets please give him the respect due:  Richard Stallman created our world.",1120435200,23,1339,5.073059360730594
1903994,4,B0000A9GLO,"So you've heard about Linux and maybe BSD and you're wondering . . .  What is it?  Who thought of it?  Who makes it?  Why do I care?

All of these questions are answered by some of the biggest names in the open source and free software movement.

The documentary begins by looking at the philosophy of those who started the free software movement and how it produced the ethos behind the GNU license.  It then looks at the creation and expansion of Linux and Linux software, the renaming of the movement by most to ""open source"" as opposed to ""free software,"" the development of applications by masses of programmers and the delivery of open source software to the average joe.

The subjects are allowed to be themselves.  Sometimes that means they are arrogant and preachy, but if that element had been taken out of the story it wouldn't have been genuine.

Far from downplaying the role of the unknown programmers, the main argument between the participants concerned who should get the credit for making this type of collaborative programming possible and what that effort should be called.

The documentary also discusses the effect of open source software on people's daily lives.  Most don't know how the Apache web server helped ISPs economically provide web pages that were not available from ""commercial"" software, nor do they realize the changes the movement has forced on Microsoft and other large commercial software companies.

It's everything a good documentary should be:  informative, interesting and entertaining . . . even if you don't agree with those interviewed or the open source movement.",1118793600,6,1611,4.962686567164179
1903995,5,B0000A9GLO,"Like it or not, hackers have been part of the profile of the computer age since its dawn. Mainstream non-insiders that don't code know little more about what programmers and hackers are thinking, formulating or from which perspective their reasoning comes. This documentary goes a far ways to bridge that gap and I felt very engaged while watching it. It's well produced (something I feel I can talk about with authority from having studied and from working within Video) does indeed incorporate a comfortable editorial logic and flow and includes well-photographed, well-cast, articulate and succint interviews that work with this documentary's focus. Bravo for the solid work.",1110412800,3,678,5.345794392523365
1903996,5,B0000A9GLO,"This is a well put together retrospective detailing the motives, methods, and history of the free software movement and the open source movement. Best of all, it is entirely told through interviews with the community leaders who have been directly involved in it (namely Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Bruce Perens, Linus Torvalds, and several others). It is straightforward, interesting, and very well edited, with an excellent soundtrack. It makes a great follow-up to Robert Cringley's ""Triumph of the Nerds"" and ""Nerds 2.01."" It is also notably apolitical, painting a very factual, unbiased, orderly picture of events (and certainly one that will anger those who like to rewrite history). It does get a bit thick towards the end, focusing on the business aspect, but not enough to jump the shark.

This film is a very good at getting across the principles of open software, in a way even a non-technical person can understand. Highly recommended.",1097020800,12,951,5.175324675324675
1903997,1,B0000A9GLO,"A stupid, propogandistic and self indulgant documentary about Richard Stallman and Eric Raymond.  Linus is a good guy, but these other folks are just demagogues of the computer age.  I particularly find their hacker interpretation of history insulting.  It ignores all the hardworking professional engineers and programmers who really did invent computers and operating sytsems, and makes us think that scruffy hackers at MIT did anything that mattered.",1085443200,20,453,5.632352941176471
1903998,4,B0000A9GLO,"It comes with 2 DVDs, the first one is the Revolution OS movie and the second one contains interviews and bios of those well known anti-microsoft gangs like Richard Stallman, Eric Raymond, Linus Trovalds, etc. In the first DVD, it's not really a movie but a kind documentary film. No subtitle but closed caption is supported. Unlike Starup.com movie, this film gets a bunch of well-known gangs who devote themselves to the free & open software revolution to talk about 'how' the free software and open source evolve and 'why' it is getting more & more attention from industrial leaders. It also highlights some companies betting on Linux and open source getting rich at IPO during the Internet bubble, but not forgets to conveying audiences the message that most of those instant millionaires were broke overnight after the bubble busted.
If you're not familiar with open source or free software, I recommend you should put on the disc#2 and watch the Bios section first. Since the movie in disc#1 embeds a lot of people talking and comments, you may find confusion of who & what. In disc#2, besides the bios and some interviews, interestingly, it also includes the first version of the famous well-known paper written by Eric Raymond, 'Cathedral and Bazaar'. This paper actually played a very critical role on Netscape's direction to the open source world.  You can read it from your TV screen, and press your remote `back' and `fore' to flipping pages. Although this is convenience for people who do not have computer and read the paper on TV screen, you may find it's quite annoying to flipping and reading twenty something screen pages on your TV. After a while you may feel dizzy. Unfortunately, the DVD does not come with a PDF or other softcopy version of this famous paper in the open source world. If you are interested on how Netscape went to the open source path, there's another good documentary film called 'Code Rush' from PBS, you may also want to check out.
Overall, this is quite informative, knowing how the free/open software revolution begins and the reasons behind it. If you want to have a good intro of this open source communities, this is a pretty good choice.",1079481600,26,2185,4.8111702127659575

Also, the mood of all these movies is similar.  They belong together for a great summary of the development of personal computing since the 1970s, and all are full of interviews with the key players.",1066003200,24,465,4.8734177215189876

Everything is so well done, from the interviews, to the cinematography, and even to the research that went into the movie.

So you will derive from this film software has started out open source and when companies started to button it up the people just moved on to other forms of creating and maintaining open systems.

The film is fun in its self as it lets those there were in the movement see themselves in retrospect and those that missed the boat to catch up.

The people interviewed explain it in such a way that it really drives the point home.

I've since moved away from ""free software"" and instead into a true Public Domain license, but one conveys a message of each receiver's personal one-on-one accountability to God in honoring my request to keep the software libre/free.

Famously it is the basis for the original Google and Amazon servers (and other services), and used on the major stock exchanges of the world for its reliability vs the Win/Apple alternatives.
It is also the vital kernel inside the globally dominant  Android OS - and now Google Chrome OS which is set fair to repeat the success of Android on laptops (Chromebooks) desktops (Chromeboxen) and varii ubiquitous USB sticks.
You have to see this movie to appreciate what a monumental U-turn has been made by Microsoft when Satya Nadella (Who? - the latest MS boss) declared publicly ""I love LInux"".
He pretty much has to now.
This story covers the early days - from the first tentative steps by a confident young student (Linus) who argued with the professor of computing - and went on to prove his point - all against the solid background of RM Stallman's long-term GNU project that made everything possible by providing the tools and other software for Linux to thrive.
The credits say:  Linus Torvalds (Actor), Richard M. Stallman (Actor)
And there are many, many others involved - Bruce Perens, Eric S. Raymond of ""Cathedral and Bazaar"" fame, but they are none of them actors.
All of them are participants in this story that affects everyone from the owner of the simplest of 'smart' phones or tablets to the head of CompSci at any University.  They truly changed the world of computing, for free.
No wonder Ballmer hated them so vocally!

Interviews from Richard Stallman, Linus Torvalds, and Bruce Perens (among others) are very insightful. The movie ties together many different topics into one movie though. The movie switches around many topics in a way that makes sense, but requires the viewer to take a deeper look on their own to more fully understand the many topics.",1398211200,,456,5.093333333333334
7996250,5,B0000A9GLO,"Given up front that no single documentary-style video can do justice to the subject, Revolution OS nevertheless captures the flavor of an important period in computing history. It provides a first-hand look at some of the people who helped change the world that can get only more meaningful with the passing of time.

Perfect or complete? No. For example, Revolution OS makes no attempt to tell the larger story of the microcomputer revolution; it's important to remember, I think, that Linux didn't happen in a vacuum. Critics of Revolution OS have made some useful observations. Still, whatever shortcomings Revolution OS might actually be guilty of, it's worth buying and viewing if for just one reason: We get to see a glimpse of the real people who in their own lifetimes became legendary.",1397952000,,794,5.015151515151516
