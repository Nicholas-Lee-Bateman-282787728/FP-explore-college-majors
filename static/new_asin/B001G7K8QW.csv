3715076,5,B001G7K8QW,I've seen this movie twice on the plane last year and it's easily one of the funiest movies i've ever seen.,1261180800,,107,4.142857142857143
3715077,5,B001G7K8QW,"If you're into French culture (with a small ""c""), this is a funny, funny movie. All of our friends in France recommended it to us.",1256688000,2,130,4.24
3715078,5,B001G7K8QW,"Excellent French comedy about a man transfered from the south of France to the furthest northern town in France.  He and his family think the place is so cold that they're almost afraid of polar bears.  A cop is so sympathetic when he's stopped for driving too slow on his way there, that he doesn't get a ticket.  They even speak a funny sort of French there which they call ""Ch'tis.""",1255219200,,385,4.394366197183099
3715079,5,B001G7K8QW,"Thoroughly enjoyed this brilliant French comedy when I went to see it at a cinema in NZ. Tracking down a Region 2 copy to watch in the UK, however, proved much more difficult and I was thrilled when I managed to source this one from the US no less. Everything worked superbly and friends were much amused by the crazy antics of the mad men in . . . le Nord!",1244073600,2,357,4.042253521126761
3715080,5,B001G7K8QW,"This film has become the most-seen (among the French themselves) film in the history of French film. In fact, has been seen by more French than any other film - period. It's funny, warm, and inclusive, and holds a mirror up to French viewers to allow them to laugh at their own clichs about regional differences. The fun ranges from slapstick to very sophisticated verbal punning, based on the more-or-less incomprehensible (even to most native French speakers) regional dialect of the North of France. The puns and misunderstandings are legion, and have Francophone audiences howling with laughter in the theaters. What about non-French-speaking viewers? Well, in fact, the English-language subtitles are superb, and succeed in capturing the flavor of the humor, at times choosing an analogous joke which works well in English, rather than a direct word-for-word translation which would fall flat. (Dany Boon, the film's writer and director - and one of its lead actors - is reported to have stayed involved with the production of the subtitles, indicating his desire to have the film's communication with Anglophone viewers be as rich as possible.)

To be brief, the humor succeeds both in revealing regional cultural differences very particular to the French, and also in playing with the basic idea of strangeness in a culturally neutral fashion. Evidence to that last assertion is the fact that the rights to re-make the film in the USA - and, presumably, to reset the action in an American frame - have been bought by Will Smith's production company.

There are several other emotionally deeper subplots which make the film richer than just an exercise of the smiling muscles. The relation between the two male leads moves from initial bias, awkwardness, and distrust to a genuine emotional (not sexual) intimacy, which allows both men to find the tools to resolve fundamental relationship issues with their respective female partners. Those three stories are somewhat predictable in their trajectories, which doesn't mean at all that they lack emotional power. Classical plot devices have become classics because they work; these plots have a germ of truth within them that allows us to remain interested in the particulars of how these individual people are going to fix their broken communications, to allow the resolution of the difficulties which are the motors of these plots.

Although it's been nonsensically claimed that ""20 million Frenchmen can't be wrong,"" in this case, they're not, and the film invites you to participate whether you're a French-speaker or not. (Yes, I know: ""50,"" not ""20."" But 20 million is the box in France as of this writing.) Very highly recommended.",1235347200,86,2693,5.157894736842105

3715108,5,B001G7K8QW,"I do not speak French but am becoming a fan of Dany Boon and have purchased more movies he has starred in and/or directed.  This movie is hilarious and extremely well written with great acting.  Even though I read the subtitles I had the volume turned up.

The movie is about Philippe (Kad Merad) who is as a manager in a post office and his difficult wife pressures him constantly to get a transfer down south to the French Rivera which he tries but it is impossible for him as they give those positions to handicapped people.  After unsuccessfully trying to get a transfer he pretends he is handicapped but is caught out.  As punishment Philippe is transferred to Bergues, the very top of the north, for two years - to the ""sticks"".  Everyone thinks the north is always extremely cold and raining, and the people are unsophisticated and speak their own language.  He leaves his wife and son behind as he does not think they would survive living in the north after hearing all the stories and goes alone returning every second weekend.

When Philippe drives to the north he is miserable believing all he has heard.  Dany Boon plays Antoine, a postal delivery man, working under Philipe.  The chemistry between them is fantastic along with the other actors and the humour is great.  It just gets better and better from here.  A real delightful film!!!",1423008000,2,1351,4.654008438818566

3715113,3,B001G7K8QW,"While many Great French films have been unjustly overlooked by the anglophone market (cur en hiver, Le placard, l'homme du train etc), I'm tempted to suggest that this film works best for French speakers as the humour depends on the viewers' knowledge of language, and to some extent even geography. Having said this, however, there is much to enjoy. Not least, the dangers of lying are graphically demonstrated! A strange paradox is to be noted, in that some of the fast quips and asides fall flat while the elaborate reception arranged for the main character's visiting wife is a truly hilarious high point. One of the most-seen films in France in recent years, it may make you want to learn sh'tie French!",1415404800,,708,4.811475409836065

I don't think you have to be from France to love this movie or to 'get' the funny stereotypes the southerners have against the northerners.

Just a very delightful movie to watch with the family if they don't mind sub titles. Our favorite part was when the wife came and husband and friends tried to fool her.

3715133,4,B001G7K8QW,"Screened in an effort to have a balanced perspective - and hopefully discover another Dany Boon gem.

Having watched the incredibly enjoyable '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rien-agrave-D-eacute-clarer/dp/B005DUNPUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rien &agrave; D&eacute;clarer</a>' - remarks by others suggesting that the ""first version"" of writer/director Boon was the funnier and more enjoyable predecessor caught my eye. Of course, completely ignoring the fact that ""La Maison du Bonheur"" was his first large scale film production.

A red flag for me when people begin their reviews with absolutes that are not based on facts.

Now, having completed the movie, I'm curious what kind of humor passes for hilarity in those reviewer's lives?

That's not to say that 'Bienvenue chez les Ch'timi' wasn't enjoyable. It was.

Tells the story of Philippe Abrams, director of a mid-sized postal station looking to ""move south"" - a reference to the enviable sunny coasts of France. A transition prompted by an ever-demanding and emotionally draining wife. But despite years of requests, all he receives are the generic form letters thanking him for his interest. Until a single position is suddenly available - the perfect position. It's in a coastal town that his wife Julie loves and comes with perks that are the envy of every station manager. He'll do anything to be the one chosen. Anything. Up to and including cheating.

Having already been passed over for several such plumb assignments - he needs an edge. So Philippe alters his application to indicate he's wheelchair bound, has been since childhood.

A profound mistake.

Soon after being selected - he's caught red-handed with his ... legs in the proverbial cookie jar. Beyond shamed, he's now a pariah in the postal service. And he's about to get his punishment.

No sunny coasts with beaches. No year-round sun. No winters free of snow. For his transgression, he has been ordered to take up a station in the dreaded Nord Pas de Calais - the mythical ""North"". Director Boon plays on the theme that Americans would understand as the directional opposite - going South; forced to live and work in a region that has the reputation for being culturally primitive, morally vulgar, and socially inferior.

As he arrives - it seems that every fear he had is validated. The weather is atrocious, the people uncivilized, their twists on the classic French language an abomination. Essentially the same thing a Northerner or Westerner would feel going to Alabama or Mississippi.

Yet, as he sadly settles into his new home and job - things aren't nearly as bad as he had feared. In fact, the people turn out to be funny, warm and welcoming. The weather, at least during the Spring, extremely pleasant; the Summer promising even more tempered beauty. He's shocked to discover that he's happy. Really happy.

Julie, who refused to travel with her husband, believes he suffers greatly for the family - an unexpected falsehood which he has to foster. Fearful to admit that he's quickly becoming one of them - the horrible 'Ch'timi' - a northerner. A transition made more challenging as he returns home every two weeks and lives a lie - confirming the hell of his new environs. Why not tell her the truth? Philippe recognized years ago that his lovely bride has been struggling with depression, explaining why he worked so hard for a new position; a relocation for her emotional health. The irony is that she's getting better the more he ""suffers"" - her inner strength and resolve repairing her damaged soul.

All is well as Philippe begins to balance out his two lives - until Julie decides to join her embattled husband in the dreary North. He realizes that if she learns the truth - it could destroy their marriage, and worse, possibly destroy her.

So a plan is concocted.

A sweet film which had some amusing moments. The script was cleverly written, the acting performances excellent, and the tempo delivered a consistent stream of smiles.

But uproarious laughter? No.

As implied by complaining reviewers: Where were the moments of gut-busting, tear-inducing laughs? Something 'D&eacute;clarer' delivered in spades is found only toward the end of this warm and subtle movie.

I'm trying hard to chalk this up to people having different perspectives. But, in truth, my sense is that reviewers trying to dismiss ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rien-agrave-D-eacute-clarer/dp/B005DUNPUE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rien &agrave; D&eacute;clarer</a>"" as a second-rate Johnny-Come-Lately are actually pretentious tools desperate to cling to some imagined cinematic superiority. Typical film snobs.

Again, a decent lighthearted 4-star film. A precursor to Boon's later work, among which is 'Rien a D&eacute;clarer'', which, in my opinion, is a  genuine laugh out loud and superior comedy.",1394755200,,4905,5.35370611183355

The story lets our admiration and enjoyment thrive along with him.

Some people from Canada speak French with such twist. It makes us revisit History and learn about people's origins before their countries became unified like in France which is so culturally rich because of the diversity of its multiple regions.

If this is one of the most popular films in France, I am extremely dismayed not to mention shocked to current French taste.

3715152,5,B001G7K8QW,"This is a delightful movie from start to finish.  My husband and I had seen it several years ago on an international flight.  I couldn't remember the title, and contacted the airline to help with that.  They didn't seem to know what they aired on their flights.  This May we were in Paris and I asked a tour guide if she knew the plot and she said ""oh yes, it is my favorite movie!""  She wrote down the title and as soon as I got home I searched on Amazon and there it was.  It is subtitled, easy to understand and enjoy.",1371945600,2,521,4.0588235294117645

more.",1370476800,,271,3.962962962962963

3715155,5,B001G7K8QW,"This was a gift and enjoyed by all who watched. The story is indeed funny.  The relationship of the wife, husband and family life is unifying and amazingly solid in a humorous way.  The humor is about France culture:  the north versus the south and, of course, about family and friends.

The one aspect I did not expect was that in the North the French accent is quite different.  For one that is just learning French, this accent, exaggerated, makes it more difficult to pick up.  The objective in buying this movie was to practice listening to French.  The movie was so funny that we did not even care if the listening aspect was a bit difficult.",1368144000,,648,4.487179487179487

You've got to watch the Ch'ti movie!""  Finally, we were able to borrow a copy of it!  We watched it with the English subtitles and my husband and I agreed that even the French might have to watch it with French subtitles because of the Ch'ti dialect that is used throughout the story.

This is a great story, very funny, but true to the prejudices that do exist regarding one region or another.  And the scene that made me laugh the hardest was when he crosses into Nord-Pas-de-Calais and it starts pouring rain!  To fully appreciate that scene, you need to understand that this is a rainy region.  You need to be prepared to deal with rain at any moment, regardless of whether it is sunny or cloudy when you go outside!

In particular, the woman post office employee and the postmaster from the South were charming.  Like ""Amelie"", it gives Americans a view of French people as ""just working folks"", whereas in the stereotype, the French are often shown in movies as a snobbish elite.  The subtitles adequately supplied a translation for all the dialect jokes, not an easy thing to do.  Lots of fun.",1357257600,,554,4.71875

I'll have to say that some of the humor would have been a little hard to translate, but the translation was admirable, and captured the wordplay in the movie very well. Even though it has a lot to do with French cultural references and bias, that was not a deterrent to someone from another country ""getting it"". The acting was superb, and the slapstick humor was well balanced by a universal human-experience theme - that of being thrust into an unknown place with grave misgivings about the outcome, and finding that there can be joy in all kinds of circumstances.",1344297600,,595,4.570093457943925

We are still longing for the carbonnade (stew) and maroilles (incredible stinky cheese)!  Take a holiday from the stereotypical ""French"" culture and embrace honest down-to-earth friendship and values of French Flanders.

If I were to watch a foreign film other than German, I am usually more interested in the Eastern European and Asian video world; But lately I have been watching more western movies and seeing this movie on the side bar brought back a lot of fun memories.

3715172,2,B001G7K8QW,"I watched this film in the company of some friends who told me in advance what a treat I was in for, and then fell asleep before the opening credits finished rolling (the friends did, not me!). Grossly over-caricatured stereotypes, horribly overacted rles, impenetrable Ch'timi accents all made for a yawn-generating experience. There wasn't even a decent bit of eye-candy of either sex.

My mother-in-law is Ch'ti (complete with usually impenetrable accent), and she is vastly more entertaining than this pathetic attempt at humour. Heck, it even makes Woody Allen look funny! I can take most of the shortcomings of French cinema - the atrocious self conscious introspection, the endings that resolve nothing, the art for art's sake camera work, the wooden acting and ponderous plots - but not in something that's supposed to be comedy, for heaven's sake! For the first time ever, I found myself nostalgic for an Australian attempt at humour.

Give this one a miss unless you are (a) an extreme masochist or (b) doing doctoral research on moribund French patois.",1322179200,6,1063,5.0685714285714285

3715175,4,B001G7K8QW,"Our experience with French films has been one of extremes.  French sensibilities do not always align with American, with the result that we either love them or hate them.  This mismatch sometimes extends to the decision making on what movies should be released here or not.  This movie suffered from this miscalculation.  It is our understanding that Bienvenue Chez Les Ch'tis was one of the biggest hits in recent years in France.  Yet, the decision was made not to release this film in the U.S., not even on DVD.  You will not find this movie on cable or on Netflix.  What a shame!  We had to track the film down on Amazon to buy a copy released in Quebec.  Our copy is now making its way through friends and family for them to enjoy.

Danny Boon has created a sweet, comic fish out of water story in which a post office manager is transferred, against his will, to the far north of France.  This is the french version of the boonies, the Appalachians or the deep south.  Much to his surprise he discovers that it is not what everyone assumes it to be.  Yet to maintain his credibility with his family and friends back home he must maintain the fiction of a man suffering when he visits them.  There is much humor in both places and in watching him go to greater extremes to maintain the lie as the story progresses.

The odds are the only way you will see this film is to buy the DVD. The cost is less than what you will waste taking someone to most movies.  My advice is to spring for the film, make some popcorn and curl up with family or friends and enjoy.",1290124800,34,1562,4.316151202749141

It is too bad that the aversion to seeing a subtitled movie means the majority of Americans will never see this joyous comedy.  What we do for love can often leads to strange, ill thought out decisions that lead to unintended consequences, but nevertheless end up making us better people and enhance our lives.  Allow the plot to develop and the true character of the people that we encounter to unfold and the beauty of this movie becomes apparent.",1289606400,20,549,4.639175257731959
3715177,4,B001G7K8QW,"Dany Boon's Bienvenue chez les Ch'tis/Welcome to the Sticks became France's biggest box-office hit in record time when it pulled in over $184m in France alone, although it's made barely a ripple in the English-speaking world - a shame, because this good natured culture clash comedy is a lot of fun. Kad Merad is the post office manager who gets caught pretending to be disabled to secure a transfer to the South of France only to be given the worst punishment in the post office's power: a transfer to the cold north of France, the Toxteth or Detroit of France. Once there he quickly discovers that (unlike Toxteth) it's not the backward disease-ridden inbred peasant slum of popular ridicule, but finds that comforting his imagined suffering cheers up his depressed wife back home, so ends up persuading his new friends to live down to all the horror stories when she comes to visit...

It's not the most original plot or treatment in the world, with much of the wordplay built around the local accent that adds chti to every other word straight out of Abbott and Costello's Who's On First routine, but while predictable it's still very funny more often than not. The early scenes are among the funniest, be it Michel Galabru's Dickensian (or should that be Hugoian?) horror stories of a childhood in the north to the sympathetic traffic cop who tears up a ticket when he finds out the condemned man's destination, and the end is rather abrupt, but it's a confident feelgood comedy that delivers the goods. Kudos to Michael Katims' excellent subtitle adaptation that manages to pull off the tricky alliteration, puns and wordplay that a lesser translator might decide were simply untranslatable.

The French PAL 2-disc set offers a wealth of unsubtitled extras, from a few deleted scenes and outtakes to lengthy documentaries and a themed French episode of Who Wants to Be a Millionare, but the film itself boasts both optional English subtitles and a very good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer.",1284076800,2,1991,4.905044510385757
