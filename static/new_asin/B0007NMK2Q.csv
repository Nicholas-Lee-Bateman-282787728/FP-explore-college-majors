2223261,5,B0007NMK2Q,"Finally got kid #4 into college but have forgotten all those high school/college dance lessons? Same here and all left feet. To keep embarrassment to a minimum and get coordinated together, we tried some DVDs from Netflix and found time with Vicki to be the most productive and fun. We started with Foxtrot, as it is similar to walking - we remember how to do that! It allowed us to dance a few at the next dance and even made us look great at lessons, lucky the first dance they taught was ....foxtrot, with only a new step or two added (but left out the underarm turn Vicki showed us). Well, it did take a week of after work nights to get up to speed.

So when we tried the waltz, we were so used to being coordinated and to Vicki's teaching style, I do believe we picked up the essence in a single weekend night ... and still have a week or so until the next dance class!

I'm getting the whole set to have in case we forget something, but can't say which are important to get in DVD format so it's easy to flip back & forth. Only seen 2 thus far, so would say Foxtrot should be a DVD but waltz - VHS is OK, save the money.

If anyone knows of equally good videos that show the advanced steps, let me know, but please ... not Cal's - too many footprints!",1129680000,12,1257,4.1016260162601625

2223267,2,B0007NMK2Q,"They do not teach much in this DVD. Just the box, balance and one underarm turn. It's a true waste of my money",1289260800,4,110,3.8260869565217392

My parents wanted to dance a waltz on their 50th anniversary,but they needed instructions. I found this video and bought it for them. They said it was amazing! It is very easy to follow along and learn to waltz. They love it. I would reccomend it to anyone.",1285891200,,414,6.410714285714286
2223269,4,B0007NMK2Q,There was one mistake when Ron counts the waltz as quick-quick-slow (it is always an even 1-2-3). They should have caught and edited that out. Otherwise a good starter dance video.,1182124800,3,180,4.838709677419355
2223270,4,B0007NMK2Q,"Easy to learn the first steps and to follow the instructions.

The producers should make other dvd-s for more advanced steps.",1143417600,7,125,4.9523809523809526
2223271,2,B0007NMK2Q,"I bought several of Vicki Regon's tapes. She seems to be a very fun teacher and very good dancer. But the instructions are too slow-paced. There are a lot of repeats which are not necessary for DVDs and video tapes. With only 4 or 5 steps taught in each tape, if you are a beginner, I doubt ""you can dance"" comfortbly on the floor after you've learned from those tapes. In terms of steps per dollar, you can find much better deals on market than this series.",1131667200,18,458,4.275862068965517

8049301,4,B0007NMK2Q,"You can learn the basic steps for waltz in this easy-to-follow DVD. The couple is not glamorous, but they really know how to teach dance. We got all six DVDs for the standard ballroom dances. I took ballroom lessons at a studio, and that's expensive. My husband learned at home these and knows enough to get on the dance floor.",1482192000,2,327,4.466666666666667
