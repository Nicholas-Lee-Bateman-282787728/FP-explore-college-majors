5957229,5,B00EYPJHDI,"I love Faulkner but ""As I Lay Dying"" has been my least favorite of his novels. Franco had me glued to the screen. He did a magnificent job. I'm looking forward to  ""The Sound and the Fury"", but really wish Franco would take on the Snopes trilogy.",1383955200,6,246,4.23404255319149

5957231,5,B00EYPJHDI,"Cinematography, actors, being a fan of period drama, camera lens work, story-telling are all reasons why I'd recommend this movie.  If you're a fan of Faulkner literature or a serious laureate you might be inclined to see some more specific things that I'm leaving out but when talking about movies I'd highly recommend this on because in today's and yesteryear's film society this is a comparative gem which I thoroughly enjoyed.",1383868800,12,430,5.056338028169014
5957232,5,B00EYPJHDI,"in my opinion, this was a surprisingly excellent adaptation of the novel.

franco delivers the worst acting performance of the cast, but it certainly isn't a bad performance and the rest of the cast are excellent in their roles. the film uses some art house devices to capture the unique nature of the novel, which may be off-putting to some, but franco's directorial methods are not overly heavy-handed or obtuse.

truthfully, if you have not read as i lay dying (or have an interest in southern gothic/lit fiction) than this film is probably not for you. if you are ""in"" to this kind of literature and are intrigued by an art house interpretation of one of the greatest english language novels, then it is definitely worth the price of the rental.",1383696000,13,749,4.709923664122138
5957233,5,B00EYPJHDI,"James Franco has encouraged me to do what William Faulkner did not, namely, to read the book.  I tried twice but abandoned the reading after a few chapters.  I was interested in seeing what Franco had done with filming this difficult-to-get-into novel.  The result is intriguing, possibly brilliant, and left me wanting to know more.  The cinematography and the score underline the terrific acting and the unforgettable writing of Faulkner.  The movie closes not with a bang, but with a subtle fading out, just like Addie.  This is good film-making and the end result far exceeded my expectations.",1383436800,,597,5.040816326530612
5957234,4,B00EYPJHDI,"This film actually does justice to the work of William Faulkner.  Every item was authentic, definitely got the feel of the characters.  It didn't particularly bother me, but I was watching the film with two other people that did not appreciate the split screen effects.  Thank goodness that did not go on throughout the movie - or did it?  Perhaps I became so enthralled in the stories of each person that I no longer noticed.  Very glad I purchased this movie - I must have a blu-ray disc for my collection.",1383177600,4,508,4.538461538461538
5957235,5,B00EYPJHDI,James Franco is in this movie......Hello.  He's amazing and so is anything he touches.  The cover photo almost makes you not want to watch it though.,1383091200,2,149,4.6923076923076925
5957236,3,B00EYPJHDI,"James Franco has made a valiant attempt at clarifying an opaque novel. However, there is a reason this story has not been adapted to film in the past: Faulkner's South belongs in print.

The movie tries a little too hard, over-utilizing split screen shots to convey the novel's multiple narrator roles. It made me feel like I was watching an olde-tymey version of 24. The extreme close-up monologues were intense and haunting, staying true to the Faulkner's voice, if not adding clarity to the storyline. The film is beautifully shot and well-acted, but felt as much like homework as my initial high school reading of this book (I enjoyed the re-read much more when I was all growsed up).

Overall, ""As I Lay Dying"" is a solid (if slightly off-the-mark) homage to a great literary work.",1382400000,43,786,4.772058823529412

It captures the book's multiple viewpoints of each circumstance and conveys the tone of the book brilliantly.  I didn't like the book all that much. It had its moments, but it just wasn't a fun read. Challenging and interesting for analysis, sure, but not fun.

For someone who hasn't read it I could understand the bad reviews. But I read the book and the next day watched the movie. The way Franco did this movie is as good as it would ever get. It sticks to the book! He didn't make a Hellywood rendition, he made the movie based on the book. Its filmed with the different perspectives like the book reads, it actually quotes the book throughout the whole movie. I applaud Franco on his work. Good job.",1461801600,,566,4.25

5957250,5,B00EYPJHDI,"I think James Franco is a genius.  This is a beautiful movie, well shot, well acted, and is true to the novel.  I got more insight to the main character played by Franco than I did from the book I read a week earlier.  The story is still relevant today for the majority of us who don't see active combat in wars, fought by those from low income levels.  Unfortunately I can only take so much William Faulkner pathos in a year, setting his other novels (and movies) aside for a couple of months.",1456617600,2,494,4.223404255319149

5957252,4,B00EYPJHDI,"This classic novel was long thought to be an impossible challenge for film makers, but James Franco did a credible job on it.  It is a must see just to watch Tim Nelson play the hapless, yet cunning father of the clan who has to travel 40 miles with their mother's body to bury it where she wished.  Reading the novel, and then watching the film has stirred deep thinking about family ties and betrayals.  While it is not a flattering portrayal of Mississippi folk, I see now why William Faulkner was awarded a Nobel Prize for his works.",1445040000,3,537,4.404040404040404
5957253,3,B00EYPJHDI,"A most amazingly faithful adaptation of one of William Faulkenr's most complex inner-voiced novels.  I give it three stars only on account of if one hasn't read the novel, one may certainly miss the motives of the characters which drives the plot through nuanced narrative, brought to live action via split screen and voice over.  The Mississippi back-woods accents are thick and, for one not accustomed to the vernacular, one will be in sore want of subtitles.  Beautifully shot and photographed.  An ambitious work on the part of James Franco whom I applaud for endeavoring and executing such an undertaking.  A Faulkner-lover's extreme treat.  Dramatic tension could have been sustained a bit longer by postponing Addie Bundren's monologue, as is in the novel itself, and I missed the dark humor fo' sho'.  I always think of it as such a funny morbid epic farce.  It was dark and lovely and very Faulknerian.  Bravo Franco!",1443398400,5,926,4.961038961038961

I live now in Oxford, MS,  the ""Jefferson"" city in the novel, and only now I can say that I understand the myriad of levels in the novel. I believe Faulkner intended to tell us a tale of domination and abuse, the exploitation of humans upon humans, with no mention of race.

5957265,5,B00EYPJHDI,"This is not an action packed movie, for the thrill seekers. You have to put yourself in the secluded living in those times. How hard it was to bury their mother in the town she wanted be laid to rest was not an easy task. It takes days by wagon, the barriers they had to break through to get to the destination is something we take for granted. The simplicity of this movie is more than moving and entertaining. The conversations between the characters keeps you very much in touch with this family. The split screen during the film was an incredible plus, I think it really captures more of the viewers interest, to be able to see two points of view on one subject. This is by far one of the best movies I have seen James Franco do. This movie has proven to the world how creative and intelligent a man he really is. The actors Franco chose were remarkable!

5957267,4,B00EYPJHDI,"A nice interpretation for screen of one of my favorite novels.  It is obvious that Franco has a passion for Faulkner.  A couple things only bothered me:  Vardaman was underused, Darl was unlikeable as a fleshed out character, and Jewel was the opposite (felt a lot of compassion for him unlike when I read his sections in print).  But I did appreciate a new take on the classic.",1422662400,,378,4.514705882352941
5957268,5,B00EYPJHDI,"Great rendition of the novel with phenomenal accuracy. This film was not created to be a blockbuster hit, it was made to put Faulkner's novel on the screen. Franco did a wonderful job of creating the feel of Faulkner's writing in this film.",1420588800,,240,4.604651162790698

5957270,5,B00EYPJHDI,EXCELLENT MOVIE! Sort of dark but excellent drama. Just real life. Franco is getting better and better as he ages. Be sure to see his play on Broadway---OF MICE & MEN...also excellent.,1417305600,,184,4.78125

5957272,2,B00EYPJHDI,"I toyed with the idea of giving this one star, but the idea behind it and Logan Marshall-Green bumped it up to two stars. Logan Marshall-Green was brilliant and is probably one of the best actors of our generation. Make no mistake, this movie, however fails and just about deserves one star. The extra star comes from the idea that the movie is a cool idea (adapting a Faulkner book), but the execution of this movie falls seriously flat and the lyricism of the book seems like it was lost (I didn't read the book myself, but this movie adaptation was not entertaining). I think the the lyricism of the written form of this book is lost in translation to the screen. This story, format, and stable of characters, along with their dialogue doesn't work in this format. The movie plays off as boring and uneventful. I think there was a deep, underlying philosophical tone to the book that was lost here on the screen. I'm scared for James Franco, because this movie just doesn't resonate, is pretty bad, and I think from the looks of it, he's directed a few movies this bad. Uh oh. James was genius in ""James Dean,"" the TV movie, and he can be brooding and brilliant, but the quality of his direction (and acting) need to pick back up for us to remember why he is famous. Sorry, James!

What do I think went wrong on a technical plane here? I think the sound might have been totally off (it needed to be re-dubbed and sounded amateur), and the photography and production design needed to be way more professional (that's a tall order, as that is a huge chunk of a film). Another million  dollars needed to be pumped into this movie along with a rewrite of the script. At the end of the day, this movie really just didn't work, and falls flat. I also didn't like the few moments of socialist propaganda in there. I'd skip this one, but if you must, you'll probably want to watch it with the subtitles, Tim Blake Nelson is unintelligible.",1416009600,,1934,4.46045197740113
5957273,5,B00EYPJHDI,"A great attempt to film something deemed to be unfilmable. No one else tries to bring things like this, Child of God and The Sound and the Fury to the screen, so full marks to James Franco.",1415923200,,189,4.135135135135135
5957274,3,B00EYPJHDI,"I have to give credit to Franco for his ambition but I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish here.  The brooding novel carries with it such an oppressive weight, but in this film, As I Lay Dying comes across as a dark comedy.  It also didn't help filming it in high definition in bright sunlight, as it lost the tonality of the novel.  Nevertheless, it was interesting to watch in its own right, as Franco arguably did his best to capture the theme of the novel.

Probably the most annoying character was Tim Blake Nelson.  It was virtually impossible to understand a single word he was saying as he garbled a Southern drawl through his hollow mouth.  The brothers were well played.  I have to hand it to Jim Parrack for a memorable performance as Cash.  Ahna O'Reilly was perhaps a little too fetching for a country girl at that time.

I think Franco should have taken more time with the film, get into the characters a little deeper and give the setting better visual authenticity.  The novel had multiple points of view, beyond the Bundren family, but Franco tried to keep it to the family itself.  The dying mother didn't figure as strongly in the film as she did in the novel.  Franco also skims over a number of important items in the novel, such as Anse taking Dewey Dell's money to buy himself a new set of teeth.  It wasn't the ""new Mrs. Bundren"" who bankrolled his choppers.  Anse was also the one responsible for the cement cast on Cash's leg.  I suppose you could see Anse as a kind of Depression-era Homer Simpson, which is the way he came across in the movie, but for whatever reason Franco chose to spread Anse's poor decisions around.",1413244800,2,1656,4.473333333333334

the pictorial compositions, it brings to mind the depression era photographs by dorothea white and the imagery captured by james agee in ""lets us now praise famous men"". much of the split-screen imagery could not be visible to the naked eye and thus brings the viewer into a new way of looking at cinema. it's a damn shame that a film like this doesn't get a chance at the dodecaplex and have to be ferreted out by the true lover of cinema. franco's skill in overcoming faulkner's  multi-narrative voices through the artful use of film's voice-over technique accompanied by brilliant photographic images to create an almost-poetic ambience. see it. relish it. savor the  experience.",1412121600,8,1327,4.990950226244344
5957277,4,B00EYPJHDI,"The novel is a masterpiece . Lovers of great literature fully realize that. It is rich in philosophical insight as well as unique humor. The brilliance of the writing leaves even repeating readers in awe. That someone would dare to make a film of what many have insisted was not  suited to stage or screen is in itself , let's say gutsy. Franco's efforts are worth the viewing clearly if one has read the work. For the newcomer, hang in there and be patient. Matters of plot and psychological  explorations will gel as you continue . It is remarkably faithful considering how much of the written work deals with inner thought------ not easy to reveal in cinema . The actors all are excellent . If the young boy's thinking that his mother is a fish leaves you scratching your head , consider his age , his environment, his other family members, and his lack of understanding death,and of course the mental and emotional connection he has made between cutting up the fish and the closeness of his mother's passing. Each family member has individual goals, fears, sufferings , loves, needs. Expect irony at the conclusion . This film production is worth your careful viewing unless you don't enjoy thinking and prefer action and fantasy that happens to be simplistic --- some obviously is not.

It's not surprising that many will not like this movie...they probably wouldn't like the novel either.  But Franco has done a really fine job I believe...the split screen is effective...I get why he did it I think, and it works.  (The novel is itself in split screen if you will...plus we only ever see a small piece of life, and we move in and out of other peoples perceptions and consciousnesses constantly.  I understand and applaud what he was going for there.). The performances are rock solid, especially Tim Blake Nelson who just plain steals the picture.  In short, many here are James Franco fans but don't read Faulkner.  Others here are Faulkner fans and no movie could ever measure up to their ideal.  I am both I suppose, and it think Franco has done a fine and honest job of bringing this gorgeous story to the screen with intensity and love.

5957285,5,B00EYPJHDI,"Nine Things about the Movie As I Lay Dying [USA, 2013]

1. I was in college the first time I read Faulkners mysterious, profound, stream-of-consciousness novel As I Lay Dying. It blew my mind. I didn't know people could write like that. I also agreed with the general consensus that it was one of those books that could never be made into a movie.

2. James Franco took on the challenge to make it into a movie. So with a fellow student, Matt Rager, he turned the book into a script. Then he directed it and starred in it, as well.

3. Its about a Mississippi family in 1930 that is nearly destroyed - mentally, physically, and emotionally - while on a trek to bury their dead mother.

4. In order to capture the unique and difficult style of the book, the film often breaks up into a split-screen form, with the same scene playing from different angles or different times. Sometimes there are two separate scenes playing simultaneously. There are a lot of voiceovers. It uses a lot of Faulkners actual writing.

5. Yes, the coffin is built on a bevel. Vardaman's mother is a fish.

6. While Franco is technically the star, and plays Darl (probably the biggest character in the book), this is truly an ensemble cast. The most memorable performance is from Tim Blake Nelson, who plays Anse, the hopeless, luckless, toothless father. His performance is mesmerising.

7. Even though the movie is American, you will probably need to turn the subtitles on, since the dialogue is spoken in an uneducated Southern drawl.

8. The studio that made the movie decided not to release it in theaters. Well, technically it was released in one theater.

9. I don't use the word masterpiece very often, but this is one. In its own way, it is as mysterious and profound as the novel itself, while also making it (slightly) more accessible.

And you can say what you want about James Franco, but he continues to be one of the only true artists around that can bring unique visions to cinematic reality.",1403827200,2,1984,4.594900849858357

Dark comedy, but comedy nonetheless.  Second, Franco's attempt at a Southern accent.  Being from MS, not far from this fictional site, I can say with confidence that his accent is a poor caricature at best.  This would be fine if my first point was not utterly lost on him.  I cannot speak to the cinematic effect or rather whether the experiment of split screen to represent the different narratives is innovative or clever.  But as a viewer I found it disconcerting and it reminded me of ""Blair Witch.""  I wanted to like the film, but he has a made a movie as an undergraduate would write a term paper.

5957307,4,B00EYPJHDI,"I was very pleasantly surprised by this film, especially given the overall critical reception. To me, it feels like a great homage to the book, one that personifies and embodies the distortedness of the story, yet  also manages to illustrate the dysfunction of the Bundren family.  I think having some understanding of the book and the way it is formatted, as well as the story itself, is pretty important prior to watching; otherwise, I can understand why one would think the film a ""jumbled mess.""

James Franco does seem to have a grasp of what Faulkner should  look like on the big screen. The split screen helps to create that feeling of multiple perspectives and monologues from several characters' vantage point. I also think Franco handled several themes aptly, especially how key characters struggle to identify with Addie's death and their own demons. He also gives the feeling of family dysfunction within the Bundrens. The scenes with the journey to bury Addie were well-thought out, and several of the actors personified their characters perfectly (Tim Blake Nelson as Anse, James Franco as Darl, Ahna O'Reilley as Dewey Dell).

This is a very ambitious attempt from James Franco, and I give him kudos for his initiative in trying to make the film with the vision of the book's narrative in mind, and not selling out just to make a standard ""Hollywood"" rendition. And, doing this even at the expense of unfavorable reviews. In the end, I feel like Franco did have a great vision for this book. This is a film that really felt like a Faulkner novel, and it makes me want to go back and read the novel again, which is what I think a film version of a book should accomplish.

The ones who are as haunted and compelled by what they saw here as I was will certainly get around to Faulkner and be better prepared to sort out his more cryptic zig zagging narrative passages.",1391472000,3,607,4.635514018691588

Without Faulkner's prose, the story seemed very simple and almost uninteresting. The almost avant-garde style was  interesting, and it helped to hold the viewer's attention where the story itself (minus Faulkner's writing) may have not. However, Franco's use of split screen was sometimes very effective, and sometimes very distracting. The performances of the main characters (not so much the minor ones) were great, and I liked how sometimes the characters would deliver their monologues directly to the camera. I didn't like that the dark humor of the novel was completely absent from the film, except for maybe the last scene. Even then, I think I only laughed at that scene because I had read the novel.

5957321,2,B00EYPJHDI,"The book upon which this is based is one of Faulkner's very best, but it is complex, modernist, and difficult upon first read.  The greatness of the novel is primarily based on its structure and methods - it is a series of internal monologues of each of the characters, who are all poor, isolated, uneducated, and often seriously mentally ill; the ""action"" of the novel is nearly irrelevant. (The most famous of the chapter/monologues is made up entirely of a child's utterance: ""My mother is a fish."")

The ""action"" of the book exists merely to give the author a canvas upon which to lay out his damaged, helpless and hopeless people.  This works brilliantly in the novel, but presents a perhaps insuperable challenge to the screenwriter and director, who comes across as a precocious English major at an elite university, who happens to have the money and clout to get this movie made and distributed, though not at all widely.

Those who know and love/admire the novel may want to give this ambitious and honorable attempt to make a movie out of it a try.  It is worth at least that.

5957324,4,B00EYPJHDI,"As this film demonstrates, Faulkner's books that utilize shifting points of view/interior monologues are not easy, most likely impossible, to fully translate into screen format. The biggest dilemma is that those who have read the novel or are at least familiar with Faulkner-in-general are bound to be a little dissatisfied while most non-Faulknerites will probably raise eyebrows and ask ""Huh?""

Nevertheless, the makers of this film did about the best job possible of condensing AS I LAY DYING into such a short length. It's expertly filmed, and the personalities of the individual family members come out very well. Specific nuances and key quotes are also effectively captured. Though this AILD may not come close to doing justice to the book, it's still helpful in elucidating Faulkner's novel and should be especially valuable for those teaching it to show to their classes. Yes, it is VERY dark and depressing, but I don't see how you can make the story of a poor 1920s Mississippi farm family transporting their deceased mother 40 miles for burial by rickety wagon anything otherwise. The grosser aspects are not emphasized any more than they have to be, and the vivid cinematography and Faulknerianingly maudlin bits of comic relief help make it palatable.

As one who's always found Faulkner's work rewarding though seldom much fun to read, I must say that I really enjoyed this film and that it made me eager to reread AILD.",1389052800,5,1435,5.025210084033613
5957325,4,B00EYPJHDI,"I'm not going to waste everyone's time debating whether or not this film should have been made. It's been made.

First of all, this was so much better than I expected. On paper, some of the casting decisions look atrocious, but no one turns in a bad performance. Franco, as Darl, is (unsurprisingly) unable to explore Darl's mind the way Faulkner did in the original novel, and much of the ""who"" and the ""why"" of the character is left for the viewer to interpret. Of course, the novel itself relied heavily on the interpretation of the reader, so I'm not going to be too hard on Franco for that. As for the actors that looked terrible on paper...well, for me, they were Danny McBride as Vernon Tull and Logan Marshall-Green as Jewel. The latter, I have to say, BLEW ME AWAY. I can honestly say he stole the show for me. In the novel, my favorite character was always Darl, but Marshall-Green's performance had me focusing more on Jewel throughout the course of the film. Interestingly, Franco frames Jewel like a saint in some of the film's more beautiful camerawork, leading me to wonder whether the director saw Jewel as more of a protagonist than I did. Now, to McBride. What, you say? Danny McBride in a role like this? Favoritism on Franco's part, perhaps? These were the things I thought before seeing the film. Fortunately, it doesn't matter either way, because Vernon Tull's character is significantly downplayed in the film, and his wife Cora is cut out almost entirely. Still, McBride doesn't do anything he shouldn't, and while I still can't say I understand the casting, there isn't really enough for his character to do for me to judge his performance.
Also, Tim Blake Nelson. If you only see this film for one reason, let it be Tim Blake Nelson. His immersion into the character of Anse, patriarch of the Bundren family is complete; he manages to walk that rare line where if he'd have hammed it up a bit more, it would have been caricature, and if he'd have downplayed it just a tad, the character would have been ineffectual. As he is, Nelson nails the character. His accent, hampered by the character's abominable dentistry, is suitably garbled, and the truth of his words suitably ambiguous.
For the sake of completion, Ahna O'Reilly, Jim Parrack, and Brady Permenter were spot-on as Dewey Dell, Cash, and the intriguing Vardaman, respectively, but seriously. Tim Blake Nelson.

Now, on to the film itself. Franco attempts to bring Faulkner's kaleidoscopic narrative to film with the use of split screens, and I can't say I can think of a better way. However, his use of this technique varies from inspired to meaningless to confused. The chief issue I had was when two versions of the same event were presented side by side (a fantastic idea) but one of them was quite obviously not from anyone's point of view. I would have appreciated seeing these scenes through the eyes of two different characters, but instead I get X's view, and then another extraneous camera angle. It's like watching a deleted scene (I can almost hear Franco saying, ""We COULD have shot it this way...). At other times, though, the technique works brilliantly, as when we see Dewey Dell hearing Darl's words, yet we see that Darl's lips are not moving. Is Darl actually saying anything? Is Dewey Dell reading his body language? Or could they have a telepathic connection? This is the kind of scene that justifies bringing the book to film.

Many will be pleased that the story survives in pretty much its complete form. In many cases the characters are speaking right out the book. Speaking of which, I'm sure you've noticed how hearing dialogue straight from a book can sound very fake and affected? Surprisingly, I didn't feel that way while watching this one. The actors become their characters to such an extent that words belong to the characters, not to Faulkner and his novel. Unfortunately, towards the end, the story becomes incredibly confusing to anyone who hasn't read the book. This is mostly due to Franco's inability to show what's going on in Darl's head. In the book, there is enough there for readers to form all sorts of interpretations about what happens. In the film, Franco hasn't given us enough of Darl to allow for complete understanding of the event itself, let alone interpretations as to the motivations behind it.

Overall, I was very pleased that the film was not atrocious (which I was expecting) and overjoyed that it turned out to be a very good film. While it may not accomplish anything that the book did not, it gives the characters a face. Tim Blake Nelson turns in an outstanding performance as Anse Bundren, Logan Marshall-Green is just as good as Jewel, and we even get a surprisingly nuanced sequence pertaining to Vardaman that lends the film a sense of sympathy the book did not possess. All in all, it is certainly a worthwhile experience. Here's the but: read the book first. Not only because the book is always better (in this case, it's one of the greatest literary achievements of all time), but because knowledge of the book is necessary for an understanding of the ending, and for a deeper understanding of the characters and story as a whole (Darl especially). See it, people! Complaining about the vile, satanic Franco and his unending blasphemous attacks on the bronzed giants of literature just serves to cement popular opinion about the literary establishment being an old men's club.

It was such an interesting experience (with such an interesting ending) that as soon as I finished, I immediately started rereading it, feeling that I had finally achieved enough of an insight to enjoy it again from the beginning.  The reread was much better than the original reading.

The novel was a bit difficult and I found Franco's movie to be the same.  And just like the book, I want to experience it again.  I have been a fan of Tim Blake Nelson since Oh Brother Where Art Thou and I am even more of a fan now.  He was outstanding in As I Lay Dying.  Just watching him recreate the family patriarch is worth viewing the whole movie.  Many of the other characters were excellent, but Nelson is a step above everyone else.

5957337,3,B00EYPJHDI,"First, I give James Franco and his backers a huge amount of credit for doing this movie.  It's nice to see an actor with an interest in American literature and I believe that Faulkner was the greatest American writer of the 20th century.  When I heard Franco wanted to bring As I Lay Dying to the screen I was fascinated but I also did not see how he would translate the book to film.  With that said, I think he did about as good a job as possible.  I also have a feeling that he was working with a limited budget.  Perhaps a longer, more detailed script would have resulted in a better movie.  It looks as if the movie was filmed in Mississippi.  I thought the actors were a little too pretty (plus a little too old) and to be honest I thought Franco was wrong for the Darl character.  (Darl was a little different and he did capture that on screen.)  The actor playing Jewel did a great job.  It certainly seemed to me that all the actors were trying to make it work.  Blake's portrayal of Anse did not work for me.  Some of the split screen work was interesting.  I always thought the central character of the book was Addie and I understand that it would be difficult to make her central in the film.  The genius of the book (to me) is that Faulkner portrays these simple hill people as human beings.  (1930 New Yorkers would dismiss the Bundrens as a bunch of monkeys.)  They were backward and unsophisticated people but Faulkner does not mock them, there is dignity in them.

The family packs up and takes off. Anse believes that God will find a way for them to complete their task. As it turns out, it was the worse possible decision.

The film, like the book utilizes excessive narration. It was annoying as was the split screen effect. The split screen was overdone. It was used to show the two angles of the same event; two simultaneous events; the same event past and present; an event with narration; plus dead people talking. Faulkner captures the struggles of uneducated folk during the Great Depression, almost in a Monty Pythonesque dark comedy fashion. Tim Blake Nelson gave us an Oscar worthy performance in a sea of great performances. Not since ""Winter Bone"" have I witnessed such great country portrayals.

This was a difficult film to stay the course. I almost ejected the disc on two occasions. However, to say I didn't like it, wouldn't be correct either. I think the adaptation stayed too close to the annoying features book. A more creative screen play, ""inspired"" by the book might have made a better film. Anse has no teeth, chews tobacco, is uneducated, and speaks with a thick accent. About 10 minutes into the film I turned on the English subscripts.

This film is not for everyone. I can't imagine watching it again.

I always perceived it  as something very difficult to pull off as a movie.  The stories brilliance lies in Faulkner's use of language and clever undertones, particularly concerning Darl (James Franco).  Anybody watching would have to wonder about some of the approaches the movie takes to incorporate these deeper layers.  Voice over narratives, some of which the character narrates directly to the camera, don't always feel right.  The split screens are too numerous.  There's no question they casted the mother appropriately, but the actress playing Dewey Dell doesn't seem to correspond with the mold of the book's young female character.  What I did like were the male characters, including Cash and Jewel.  Tim Blake Nelson as Anse is absolutely perfect, given the qualities Faulkner imbued into his famous ""partriarch.""

5957356,2,B00EYPJHDI,"Lets get it out of the way first, some of the book's best scenes are missing. Why doesn't Vardamin bore holes in Addie's face? Why is Peabody thin, allowing the filmmakers to avoid comically pulling him up the hill via a pulley system? Why doesn't (spoiler) Darl narrate himself on the train in the end? And why, for cement, is water used instead of some more...organic? These are only a few flaws in Franco's film. Another is the omnipresent split screen that works well occasionally but mostly seems at once somehow both lavish and dull. Scenes that would work far better filmed normally are subjected to this treatment and come off as fake. Disorienting? Sure. Good. But fake. In fact, I'm not sure if its the split screen or budgetary concerns but many scenes in the film that involve characters other than our leads feel less like a movie and more like people standing around in someone's back yard pretending to act. Elsewhere, however, the film does a few things right. Cash is represented most faithfully. So is Macgown, the sinister ""pharmacist"". And Anse, though that gape-mouth Tim Nelson does gets annoying after a while. Franco himself is fine as Darl, but again, where is the scene of he and Vardamin listening to mother's corpse bubbling in the sun? In avoiding these grotesque moments in lieu of vapid stylistic choices, Franco reduces the spirit of an undeniable classic to half-cocked lampoonery.

5957360,4,B00EYPJHDI,"Franco's adaptation uses a split screen to represent the many narratives of the Faulkner original. While another movie maker could have taken an ""easier"" approach by presenting one clear story line from one third-person perspective, Franco preserves the experimental character of the source material- its vague chronology, stream-of -consciousness monologues, and its multiple perspectives. For most people, it will be very helpful to have the book available for comparison. Casual viewers who are unfamiliar with the novel will see how Franco's unconventional story telling captures Faulkner's style. Some will be intrigued, some will still think it to be an egg-head's nonsensical vanity project. Others who have read Faulkner will enjoy re-reading the novel in bits that parallel the scenes in the movie in order to see how Franco's evident love of both movies and books is put to use translating this American classic to the screen.",1384819200,2,936,5.417808219178082
5957361,4,B00EYPJHDI,"Let me preface this review by stating that I have never read Faulkner's novel.  I also am not the biggest James Franco fan.  However, I do love classic novels and 127 Hours is a favorite of mine so it wasn't a stretch for me to give up two hours of my time to give the  movie a chance.  I imagine this movie will only attract fans who for the most part know what they are getting themselves into so keeping that in mind, this movie is not for everyone.  If you are sitting around on a Saturday night and your wife says, ""Ooh this looks interesting. I love James Franco,""  you are better off passing.  If however you are of the ""indie"" film ilk and/or an avid reader of famous novels you should consider lending this movie your time.  Franco does well as director of the film and the acting is top notch.  The plot of the movie is just short of tragic and certainly not uplifting so don't expect any sunshine.  All of Faulkner's characters are flawed and everyone in the film loses more than just their mother ""Addie.""  The movie begins with the matriarch of the family passing and continues with the family embarking on an oddesy to bury her.  The movie can be a little slow and overly artistic, but it is not enough to condemn Franco's direction.  My only complaint is that Franco employs too many split-screen shots ala Danny Boyle (the director of 127 hours).

5957364,3,B00EYPJHDI,"I have waited all my adult life for this film and it is a major disappointment. James Franco seemed to have been trying too hard to give us an intellectual film; instead, he gave us one that is indecipherable. I've taught this novel many times to both high school and college students; it's just not that hard to understand. Franco put in split screens for no apparent reasons (who knows what was going on inside that head of his?) and left out anything that could be considered even remotely amusing. Humor is one of the book's dominant characteristics. The good news is that the acting was, for the most part, good. Franco himself did a good job as Darl, and Tim Blake Nelson would have been perfect as Anse except that Franco gave him, inscrutably, additional dialogue that was not characteristic of Anse. The actor who played Dewey Dell did a nice job, but she was far too pretty to be a member of the Bundren family, as Jewel looked far too much like Anse to be the preacher's son. I could go on, but suffice it to say that this is not the movie anyone who loves the novel has been waiting for.",1384646400,,1099,4.392156862745098
5957365,5,B00EYPJHDI,"James Franco's As I Lay Dying inevitably differs from Faulkner's.  In the novel, the Bundren home and farm lie on a hill, hard to reach, where Doc Peabody has to be hauled up by a rope.  Cash limps from an earlier fall, but his leg at the end is not amputated.  Jewel is a whole head taller than the others.

  An important section in the novel, Darl being transported to Jackson by train, is left out of the film. Except for Anse's and perhaps Jewel's, the faces in the movie belong too much to our time and not the `twenties in Mississippi.  Some of the clothing is too contemporary as well.  In the film, Dewey Dell is too much a girl of our own day, more a woman, and much too beautiful.  The landscape is too unvaried; the novel moves from Mississippi hill country toward (without actually entering into) the delta.

  Such variations could be expanded.  But they do not matter.  If you want to read Faulkner, read him.  Franco's movie is not a substitute for that nor does it mean to be.  It is a work of translation.  I think one has to see the film in and for itself, though  I do not know how someone who has not read the novel might respond to it.  In a sense, it is a work of the grandest plagiarism, since so much of the language is Faulkner's, shifted about, cut hugely, altered, and, at times, even changed, beginning as the novelist's language and then becoming Franco's.  Toward the end of the movie, Darl speaks words that are found in the novel in Addie's monologue.  But the  film requires its own place and dress and faces.  What I have just noted, and the differences could proliferate, does not matter because the movie is a different sort of experience, bound  to a different sort of watchfulness.

  For example, the scene of the crossing of the flooded river, though in detail not Faulkner's scene, is brilliant, moving, astonishing to see.  So, too, is  the whole sequence when Darl sets fire to Gillespie's barn.  Addie was extraordinary, her look, her speech, her placement in the frame.  The language of the book is often powerfully visualized.  In that translation, too, the novel is turned into film, albeit a different, and distinct, work of art.

  If Faulkner's novel has an ontological depth the film lacks, so be it.  Faulkner was obsessed with a religious sense of the person in the absence of any belief he could muster in God or anything like a god.  Darl's anguish is, to make use of another fancy word, existential.  (There is no mention in the movie of his having fought in France, an intriguing omission.)  Darl confronts the world in his and its absence.  He is words, words, words as Jewel is deeds, doing, action, impulse.  I will not go on.  Faulkner remains an artist of an historical moment when the fundamental, the oldest questions remained not only worth asking, but demanding to be asked.  Perhaps that is still so for some.  I'd like to think so, but the film seems to be more bound to a sense of an absurd fatality, the journey itself therefore intensified because of the way it ends, in disaster.  The end in the novel is disastrous, too, but only for some, not for all.  Cash is changed, after all, and his new complexity is not nothing.  The sensibilities of novel and film, therefore, are different.  One might say they adhere to different beliefs, to different ways of seeing the world, views that often intersect, as in translation, but which cannot be the same.  The two works, book and film,  the two artists, Faulkner and Franco, exist, through Franco's intervention, in a dialogue with one another.  This is the essence of translation, its necessary, inevitable transpositions.

  Franco's use of the split screen cannot give a sense of interiority of Faulkner's monologues, of course,  but it can offer instead the doubleness, even better the plurality of perspective that is the film's obsession, even to the moment (wonderful) when the muddy river itself is twice seen.  This ""doubling"" is necessarily more restrictive than Faulkner's use of multiple narrations.  Film in some ways is always more limited, imaginatively limited, than literature.  That is, it is so if it is seen as a substitute art.  Bresson, of course, would have none of that.  Theater was one thing; ""cinematography,"" by which he meant a film, is another.  The split screen, then, eliminates over and over again the possibility of a single and therefore stable vision.

  It is this instability that strikes me as part of Franco's vision.  Look at how much time he spends on people's looking, just looking or staring and, occasionally, seeing.  No one sees what anyone else sees.  That is Faulknerian enough, of course.  Narrative in Faulkner is almost always at least doubly bound.  But we are often, in his As I Lay Dying, always, within a character.  It is a matter of plurality rather than of doubling.  In the movie, not even in the voiceovers, are you in them, in the characters.  The split screen is distancing.  You are always outside, listening in, as the language spoken combines and clashes with what is seen.  It is a wholly different way of viewing the world, in short.  What is fine about the film for me, then, is how much of Faulkner's ""poetry"" remains within it even though it is transposed.  Faulkner's novel might be in part about the anguish of meaning; Franco's is more about its impossibility.  That is much too glibly said.  But I hope it might intimate some of what I see.

  The movie is undoubtedly the finest translation of a Faulkner novel to film.  The few others are worthless or ludicrous.  Franco's film on Hart Crance, The Broken Tower, may be the best movie ever made about a poet.  His As I Lay Dying, seen for itself, in its subtle greens and browns and yellows, in its recurrently stunning and provocative vision, is one of the best re-imaginings of a novel into film.  It is also one of the few genuinely serious movies directed by an American that I have seen during the last few years, as original and accomplished as Kelly Reichardt's work, for example.",1384646400,13,6032,4.653992395437262

5957367,2,B00EYPJHDI,"So I have never read the book.  I can only assume those who have read the novel by Faulkner would absolutely hate the movie. On, the other hand, the experience of reading the novel may compensate for the suicidal side effects of the movie.  Dark is an understatement. This is a pure strain of misery that does not and can not reflect the contextual art embodying the content, like the novel. The entire family cast needs makeup and special effects to deform their appearance as with the father character (Anse - chronic tooth decay). As inbred as they behave, their appearance of each is incongruent and gives one a false hope that there might be at least one with whom to relate.  There is hint of one soul seeking to resist the ""drink the from the family vomit bucket"" in the character of Darl.

depicted in a format that would reflect it as the apex of the telling of the story.  It exceeds the account I remember my grandfather

The father in the story, with his mouth almost always in the open position as if he needed to breathe that way, was really excellent in his role. Sometimes the accents got in the way of the clarity of understanding, but having lived in the deep south, I do understand that many remote families did (and still do) talk that way, even though this was a period piece. I wish the mother had been more active in her role, but the point was well made, even though her appearance did not change drastically as one might expect.
