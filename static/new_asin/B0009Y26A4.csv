2336721,5,B0009Y26A4,"This has got to be the best ballet DVD I've ever seen. Sound, image quality, costuming, sets, lighting, dancing, musicality, expression...all are as good as it gets. Svetlana Zakharova is a brilliant choice for Aspicia. She has an almost unearthly degree of extension and control in her movements, yet always retains the graceful fluidity to make it look effortless and never loses the human quality of a young woman in love. Her perfomance in the wedding pas de deux is breathtaking! Sergei Filin is powerful as Taor, and easily conveys his sense of wonder at the strange ancient world he's fallen into. He has incredible ballon and brilliant entrechats (he doesn't cheat them like many dancers do when they start to get tired). And on a shallow note, both Zakharova and Filin are physically beautiful to watch. I was also tremendously impressed by Maria Alexandrova as Ramze; her chaine turns in the pas d'action and the degree of lightness she has to her extensions are impeccable. The Three Rivers soloists also each gave standout performances.

The behind-the-scenes bonus feature was a nice treat. Not too many ballet DVDs have bonus features at all, so it's a lovely inclusion when they do. Nice montages of the dancers in rehearsals or waiting in the wings to go on stage; gave the performance a more intimate feel (which you'll realize is quite a feat in itself considering how massive the stage sets are). It was also interesting to hear just how Pierre Lacotte developed the idea to restage this ballet. My only complaint (if such it can be called) is that I would like to have heard from the dancers themselves, rather than just a couple sentences about the two stars from Lacotte. But the lack of this certainly didn't detract from the DVD as a whole.

If you're trying to decide which of a few handful of ballet DVDs to purchase, I'd definitely recommend buying this one. I'm sorry I kept it in the ""Saved for Later"" section of my shopping cart for so long!",1170288000,13,1971,4.743440233236152
2336722,5,B0009Y26A4,"This is one exhilarating ballet!  It is packed with choreography of gorgeous, aggressive, and brilliant intensity.  Lacotte has attempted to reconstruct this ballet from first hand accounts of dancers who actually remembered when they had danced it long ago, before it fell into obscurity.  But he did much more than reconstruct it--he modernized it to reflect the contemporary intensity of classical ballet technique and modern staging techniques.  There are an enormous number of solo petit and grand allegri, as well as other types of dances.  Lacotte's use of the corps de ballet is wonderful, with a masterful use of angle and space.  The costumes are also very well done, and it is amusing to see some ballerinas dancing in Egyptian pencil skirts--not an easy feat!

There is a definite comic undertone to this ballet, including, in fact, some comic solos.  If that is not enough to establish the comic mood, there is also a Spanish dance, accompanied by castanets!  I'm still trying to figure that one out, but I loved it.

There is one very serious aspect to this ballet, and that is the whole concept of having such a dream in the first place.  What does this dream of intense love of someone never encountered in reality mean?  Was it really only a dream, or was it beyond that?  Could a dream include an entire lifetime of experience?  And finally, we are left wondering why doesn't love transcend the confines of the dream?  Perhaps I have an overactive imagination and am an incurable romantic, but I felt these issues strongly.

I enjoyed watching this dvd many times over.  The intensity always captures my attention.  The musical score by Cesare Pugni is also enchanting and romantic, and never fails to inspire.

The dancing itself is of the highest standard, and the acting is very convincing and charming.  Zakharova is so sweet and endearing in the use of her mime.  I especially loved the way she told her father that she was almost murdered.

The image and sound are at the highest quality level, and the inclusion of half an hour of interviews and rehearsal clips makes this a real keeper!",1162512000,20,2112,4.808333333333334
2336723,5,B0009Y26A4,"Sound and image quality of this DVD are excellent.

The ballet was unknown to us. We bought it after reading the reviews on Amazon. We are delighted as the dancing by S Zakharova and her partner Filin is superb while set and costumes are magnificent.

Highly recommended",1136678400,15,270,4.723404255319149
2336724,5,B0009Y26A4,"Finally, this DVD became available at AMAZON, just before the Bolshoi's US tour in July. Filmed on 31st, October 2003 at the Bolshoi Theatre in Moscow, with dream cast: Serguei Filin, Svetlena Zakharova, Maria Alexandrova. The Pharoah's daughter was the first full-length ballet Petipa created in St Petersburg, in 1862, seven years earlier than his DQ. But unlike most of his work, such as DQ, la Bayadere, which are still performed in Russia and many other countries nowadays, Pharaoh's daughter was last seen at Moscow in 1928. Nureyev had an idea of restage this Petipa's classic for Paris Opera Ballet, but his early death ended his dream. In 1999, Vasiliev, the director of Bolshoi ballet at that time, commissioned Pierre Lacotte this project, re-construct this ballet for Bolshoi ballet. In this DVD, there is a 13 min documentary film and a 16 min interview with Pierre Lacotte. What I have is the European Pal version DVD. It contains a 32 page illustrated booklet in different languages. I guess this NTSC version will do the same, at least including English booklet that is enough for most of us. So lucky! this disc was not released by KULTUR, who never accompany its DVD with any readable booklet.

Story is a little bit simple. An English man, Lord Wilson, traveled in Egypt, while taking shelter in the Pyramid, he smoked opium, which made him into the dream world. He met and fell in love with Pharaoh's daughter, Aspicia. After adventure and adventure, united with his love before weak up. If you've watched Paris Opera Ballet's Paquita and La Sylphide, which are reconstructed by Pierre Lacotte as well, you will find the choreography is similar in some way. The dancing are so brilliant and disciplined, both principal dancers and corps. Zakharova's fouette is probably the most beautiful Russian fouette I've ever seen. The male part has lots of tour en air and beating (six), very physical demanding. I think the male variations are mainly Pierre's own choreography, since it is beyond the male technique level of 19 century. Let's go back to Petipa, all his original full length ballets have a vision scene, so this one wouldn't miss. It is in Act II, kingdom of river Nile. In fact, the entire ballet seems to be a larger vision.

This is one of the few great performances in recent years released on DVD. I used to have negative view toward Bolshoi ballet more or less because all my impression of this company is from the video series Bolshoi at the Bolshoi, made in 1989-90. Some dances, especially male part, are not so elegant in those old films. But this Pharaoh's daughter is definitely different. The whole company almost reaches Paris opera ballet's level. In the interview, Pierre mentioned he wished to restore the classical Petipa style to Bolshoi ballet by restage Pharaoh's daughter. He's done it. Bravo!

No hesitation! This DVD is a must have by all the ballet fans. Terrific dancing, beautiful costume. You can hear some of Drigo's insertion for other ballets, i.e. Esmeralda, Talisman male variation.

2336766,3,B0009Y26A4,"I loved the dancing and production but, the music not so much. But, what do I know? I have to add three words",1373328000,,109,3.782608695652174
2336767,5,B0009Y26A4,"The Pharaoh's Daughter, premiered in 1862, was the first big success for choreographer extraordinaire Marius Petipa. He even danced in it. The story from the exotic poet-painter Theophile Gautier was in keeping with the Egyptian rage in Europe at that time. Starting with the Nepoleon expedition in Egypt followed by serious Egyptian studies by English and French scientists and at the time of the ballet's premier, the opening of the Suez Canal, Egypt was the talk of the times. The libretto from Gautier's story ""Le Roman de la Momie"" was made by Jules-Henri Vernov de Saint-Georges, an accomplished artist. For the music, the ""at your quick service"" Italian composer Cesare Pugni whose record of some three hundred ballet scores at a week or so each surely is a world record. He had written a score for Petipa earlier (The Blue Dahlia) and it was well received. However Petipa and Pugni had great disagreements and Petipa choreographed without music and the music was fitted in later. The final score had many many dances and went on for some four hours. The sets and costumes were grandiose and the whole thing was a tremendous success. For many years it was revived and revived again and was very popular. But the Soviets condemned it as ""negligible artistic value"" and was last seen in 1928. It was the French ballet master Pierre Lacotte that began the excavation of the huge score and old time choreography notes of Petipa in order to make a usable score. He made many revisions, cuts and changes and finally presented the Bolshoi with a usable score that retains the flavor and spirit of the original. The Bolshoi has done itself proud in its presentation of the revised work.
The corps here is absolutely superb. With upwards of thirty to fifty people on stage at any one time doing a variety of things they are all together and the complicated choreography looks effortless.
The two principals are Svetlana Zakharova and Serguei Filin. They are both extraordinary artists. She is beauty in motion , her fouettes are breathtaking. He is all over the stage in perfect motion. He is a thrill to watch.
Filin later became artistic director of the Bolshoi and was the victim of an acid attack by a disguntled colleague. I hope he has recovered",1365984000,3,2249,4.813953488372093
2336768,5,B0009Y26A4,"Marius Petipa, one of the greatest ballet choreographers of the century, met his first success with the ballet The Pharaoh's daughter. Did everything to please the public romantismo. Lugar exotic (Ancient Egypt), impressive figures, scenes of large groups, pantomimes, pas de deux and solos at will. Smash everything that was in that ballet fell in love the wagon.

  Choreographer Pierre Lacote accepted the mission to rebuild the daughter of Pharaoh, ballet has been lost in the twentieth century. Music Cesare Pugni there is a reduction for piano, already the choreography was more complicated. The focus was on the memories of dancers who danced the ballet in the first decades of the twentieth century and used his creativity in several parts.
  The ballet The Pharaoh's Daughter has 204 shows between 1864 to 1904 on stage in Czarist Russia. These figures attest to its popularity. But for reasons unknown and unexplained, it fell into oblivion. His last appearance was in the distant year of 1926.
  The choreography Lacote follows the tradition of the great Russian ballets. Keep the spirit and style of Petipa. Variations and soils of difficulty attached to numbers with group scenes. All this aims to show the technical mastery of the dancers. Technique not only excites and Lacote know it. His dance is smooth and balanced. Alterna moments of lightness with strength, thrilling the viewer. The numbers follow the tradition of the nineteenth century, Lacote not invent fashion, runs away from the modern choreography. He knows he is facing a romantic ballet and fits him. Your work is brilliant, riding a century ballet in his face the date of his debut. Everything is great: scenarios, number of dancers and colors. Make a single concession reduces the time the ballet of four for just over two hours.
  The scenery is magnificent, convey the mood and magic of ancient Egypt. His golden colors fit with the smooth sands of the Sahara desert. Remember the tales of Thousand and One Nights. The costumes are stunning in beauty, adapt to the libretto. The lighting is correct, but sometimes static: it could be better worked, helping the progress of the plot.
  Svetlana Zakharova is the first dancer of the Bolshoi and one of the big news. It has all the requirements for it. Technique, charisma, safe steps, trust. But its beauty is highlighted, makes grown men drool and women die of envy. Dance lightly, floating in slow steps, defies the laws of gravity in the pas de deux.
  The dancer Sergei Filin in the tradition of the Russian school. Pure strength, high heels. Leads Zakharova in pas de deux with refined technique. But he lacks the charisma of a Roberto Bolle or Russian Korsuntsev of Kirov.
  The corps de ballet is exceptional, the great dance steps simultaneously tuned to near perfection. Standard Bolshoi quality.
  Daughter of Pharaoh is a grand ballet in all directions, and do not understand why he left the repertoire of the great Russian opera. His music and choreography in love, this re-recorded in 2003 comes in handy.

Marius Petipa, um dos maiores coreografos de bal do sculo XIX, conheceu seu primeiro sucesso com o bal A filha do Fara. Fez tudo para agradar o pblico do romantismo. Lugar extico (Egito Antigo) , nmeros grandiosos, grandes cenas de grupos, pantomimas, pas de deux e solos  vontade. Sucesso estrondoso, tudo que estava nesse bal caiu no gosto da galera.

  O coregrafo Pierre Lacote aceitou a misso de reconstruir A Filha do Fara, bal que se perdeu no sculo XX. Da msica de Cesare Pugni existe uma reduo para piano; j a coreografia foi mais complicada. Ateve-se a lembranas de bailarinas que danaram o bal nas primeiras dcadas do sculo XX  e usou sua criatividade em diversas partes.
  O bal A Filha do Fara teve 204 apresentaes entre 1864 at 1904 nos palcos da Rssia Czarista. Esses nmeros atestam sua popularidade. Mas, por motivos desconhecidos e inexplicveis, ele caiu no esquecimento. Sua ltima apresentao ocorreu no longnquo ano de 1926.
  A coreografia de Lacote segue a tradio dos grandes bals russos. Mantm o esprito e o estlo de Petipa. Variaes e solos de grande dificuldade unidos a nmeros com cenas de grupo. Tudo isso visa mostrar a maestria tcnica dos bailarinos. Tcnica somente no emociona e Lacote sabe disso. Sua dana  harmoniosa e equilibrada. Alterna momentos de leveza com fora, emocionando o espectador. Os nmeros seguem a tradio do sculo XIX, Lacote no inventa moda, foge das coreografias modernas. Sabe que est diante de um bal romntico e se adequa a ele. Seu trabalho  brilhante, monta um bal no sculo XXI com a cara da data de sua estria. Tudo  grandioso: cenrios, nmero de bailarinos e cores. Faz uma nica concesso: reduz o tempo do bal de quatro para pouco mais de duas horas.
  Os cenrios so grandiosos, transmitem o clima e a magia do Egito antigo. Suas cores douradas se encaixam com a fluidez das areias do deserto do Saara. Lembram os contos das Mil e Uma Noites. Os figurinos so estonteantes na beleza, adaptam-se ao libreto. A iluminao  correta, mas s vezes esttica: poderia ser melhor trabalhada, auxiliando o desenrolar da trama.
  Svetlana Zakharova  a primeira bailarina do Bolshoi e uma das grandes da atualidade. Tem todos os requisitos para isso. Tcnica apurada, carisma, passos seguros, confiana. Mas sua beleza  destaque, faz os marmanjos babarem e as mulheres morrerem de inveja. Dana com leveza, flutua nos passos lentos, desafia as leis da gravidade nos pas de deux.
  O bailarino Sergei Filin segue a tradio da escola russa. Pura fora, saltos altos. Conduz Zakharova nos pas de deux com tcnica refinada. Mas lhe falta o carisma de um Roberto Bolle ou do russo Korsuntsev, do Kirov.
  O corpo de baile  excepcional, dana os grandes passos simultneos com sintonia que beira a perfeio. Padro Bolshoi de qualidade.
  A Filha do Fara  um bal grandioso em todos os sentidos, e no entendo porque ele saiu do repertrio dos grandes teatros russos. Sua msica  e coreografia apaixonam, essa recriao gravada em 2003 vem em boa hora.

Her exaggerated hand and arm gestures are beautiful, but a little bit ""over the top"" for me.  Also, she acts as though she deserves accolades that last for a long time.  Her legs and feet are very pretty.  Her extensions are unbelievable.  They go beyond the classical positions, though, and are too exaggerated for me.  It is almost as though she has been trained as a rhythmic gymnast, bringing her foot so close to her ear on that side.  Her dancing is enjoyable, but very formal.

Take with a pinch of salt and enjoy the fabulous choreography and technical brilliance of the dancers. Not to mention Pugni's lovely music. Fabulous to see Filin pre acid attack, and Zhakarova is amazing as always, but also Alexandrova (whom I would have liked to see without the darker body colour that didn't go with her pale face!).
