7812366,4,6301412990,"Before purchasing this video....Please, please contact the seller and have them check the box to see if there is any indication on it that states it covers the application of vinyl siding!!  I have a customer who purchased this video from me...Brand New...Factory Sealed...and he is upset with the purchase.  He thought because the picture shown has vinyl siding in the picture that the tape would have vinyl siding.  You cannot assume this!!  You need to have the seller check the box to determine if it does or not.  However I haven't received the tape back...he is returning it....so I am not sure what the back of the box says.  Just be aware...this tape may NOT have vinyl siding application in it.

BEST ADVICE>>>BEFORE ANY PURCHASE...if you are not sure....EMAIL THE SELLER and ask them to check it.  It may save you alot of frustration and anger.  Sellers try hard to make your experience positive....but we are limited to the same information you are at times.

Thank You
