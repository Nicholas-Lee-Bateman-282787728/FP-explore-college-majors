8390592,3,B0037HERNO,I'd prefer to see more fish-centric stuff and less about the story of each fisherman. Some good footage from remote areas.,1392163200,,122,4.857142857142857
8390593,5,B0037HERNO,"Haven't seen a fishing video this entertaining since the Kodiak Custom Fishing Tackle Vol. 1 DVD came out! The guys in Fish Bum 2 are for real, they're hard hitting and will flat out make you laugh! The sport fishing film industry needs a crew like these guys.",1383523200,,260,4.4375
8390594,5,B0037HERNO,"I think reviewer Adam saw a different movie than I did--there was plenty of fishing in this video. These are travel videos as well as fishing, and I like the fact that they show some of what goes on when you travel and when you go remote. It's not all easy going and people need to see that. Heck, I enjoy seeing it!

This one was way better than the Patagonia one; film quality better for one thing. Adventure aspect greater, too.

I liked it.",1335312000,,444,4.211764705882353
8390595,5,B0037HERNO,"If you are a steelheader, or thinking about becoming one, you must see this movie! I read the reviews here and was not overly excited. I then checked out the trailer and ordered it. Is it 100% fishing? No...but most fishing shows are not exciting to me. This is five trout bums having an adventure of a lifetime. Steelhead are like no other fish on Earth! These guys manage to capture that for you. It almost makes me shake myself thinking about the next time I am fortunate enough to do battle with one of these amazing creatures! Oh and it takes place in British Columbia, so the scenery is kinda ok too...lol enjoy it! Please catch and release wild Steelhead for future generations to relish.",1327536000,,695,4.523809523809524
8390596,1,B0037HERNO,"The vast majority of this movie shows the guys driving in a car, talking around a tent site, hanging out at a bar, or traveling in a boat. Very little fly fishing in this movie. If you are into watching a bunch of guys sit around and talk, by all means buy this video immediately. The actual steelheading footage in this movie looks like it was pieced together last minute. Short 5 second clips of them holding steelheads. The longest sustained fly fishing footage in the video (20 seconds) was showing a guy tangled up in his line who had never spey casted before. Borderline unwatchable.",1321401600,2,589,4.566037735849057
8390597,5,B0037HERNO,"Utterly worth its price. This is an epic film.

The only shame is that AEG broke-up after this was released and the Trout-Bums went their separate ways. Not sure why, but that sucks.",1313280000,,182,4.515151515151516
8390598,5,B0037HERNO,I was very happy with the speed with which the DVD came. I will definitely use this seller in the future.,1300492800,,105,4.0476190476190474
