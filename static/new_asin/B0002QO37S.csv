8030675,5,B0002QO37S,"This DVD is really entertaining & also provides some insight into Elie's past throughout episodes 10 - 12. I wathced the whole series when it was on t.v & really enjoyed it so I was disappointed to discover that only the first 12 episodes were released onto DVD. This series was really good & gets better the further into it that you get.

This DVD contains episodes 09 - 12
Episode 09: A Bite to Eat
Episode 10: Sound of Thunder, Part 1
Episode 11: Sound of Thunder, Part 2
Episode 12: Sound of Thunder, Part 3",1382572800,,511,4.268041237113402

8030677,3,B0002QO37S,"Rave Master Volume 3 - The Sound of Thunder is a single disc DVD release that contains four episodes of the anime series, Rave Master.  The episodes included on this DVD are: ""A Bite to Eat,"" ""The Sound of Thunder Part 1,"" ""The Sound of Thunder Part 2,"" and ""The Sound of Thunder Part 3.""  This disc is the third and final DVD that Tokyopop released for Rave Master.

This DVD is a dub only release.  There are also no bonus features on the set, and no trailers of any kind are included.  Tokyopop definitely put this disc together as a ""bare bones"" set, and seemed to only put a very minimal effort into the content of the disc.  When it comes to the episodes themselves, there are no chapter marks included on the set.  If you try to skip ahead, you'll be taken straight to the beginning of the next episode of the disc.  However, I do have to give Tokyopop some credit for including the episode previews at the end of each episode.

The DVDs that Tokyopop released for Rave Master are now out of print, although used copies can still be found and purchased.  In March of 2010, Tokyopop had made the entire series available ""on demand"" as CD-Rs through CreateSpace; however, it appears this only lasted for a short time, because six months later, the CreateSpace listing was gone.  So, Rave Master fans who want to legally own any episodes of the series on DVD have to track down the three DVDs released by Tokyopop that contain the first twelve episodes.  While I wouldn't normally recommend such a ""bare bones"" and incomplete release, this is a case where I have to, since this is the only way that any episodes of Rave Master can be obtained legally.

I wrote this review after watching a copy of this DVD that I was given as a gift.",1290470400,2,1738,4.410658307210031
