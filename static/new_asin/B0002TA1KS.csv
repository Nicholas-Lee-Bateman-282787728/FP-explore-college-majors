8031609,5,B0002TA1KS,"La Inocente(1972) is an underrated drama starring Mercedes Carreno and Lilia Michel. Let's get the flaws out of the way. The film is corny and over the top. It does have a bizarre, corny surface. Mercedes Carreno plays Constancia, an adult woman with a low IQ and a childlike innocence. Carreno does give a sincere performance as a sensual, simple minded woman. In La Inocente(1972), a young man rapes Constancia and she's forced to bring his baby into the world after he commits suicide!
Meche Carreno is famous...or infamous for playing sexy women in Mexican movies.  This is like watching Stella Stevens or Barbara Parkins play Nell! Lilia Michel plays Constancia's mother. Michel played a Jorge Negrete fangirl in one of his 1940's films. Maricruz Olivier and Lilia Michel looked similar in 1972! Raul Lavista's music score is very good. It reaches a crescendo in the first three minutes of the film. Lavista added some hard rock music in some scenes. It feels like Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, and Iron Butterfly at a concert. Constancia's theme sounds a little like 1950's rock/pop. Lorena Velazquez is delightfully good as an evil stepmother living next door. She's dressed only in a bra, panties and a robe. She even yells ""HA HA"" Nelson-style! La Inocente transports you to 1972. There's green paint on walls. People are dressed in garish clothes. Constancia watches reruns of Speed Racer. La Inocente has its share of tear jerking scenes. A woman yells at Constancia after she steals a bicycle. Constancia tells her mother that a young man ""tore her yellow dress"". The script for the film was written by Patricia Kennedy. The film was directed by filmmaking veteran Rogelio A. Gonzalez Jr. Sara Garcia and Alicia Montoya co-star. La Inocente(1972) is a solid film from 1970's Mexico.",1361491200,,1789,4.963333333333333
8031610,3,B0002TA1KS,The movie is OK.  I saw it when I was very young and I really liked it then . Now that I grew older I don't think it is one of the best movies Meche Carreno acted on.,1356134400,,166,3.3684210526315788
8031611,5,B0002TA1KS,"Este es un film bastante emocional y muy bien actuado. Es una pelcula que trata sobre la vida de una inocente, una muchacha adulta que tiene la mentalidad de una nia y como su madre tiene que protegerla de la salvaje sociedad en la que viven.

Recomiendo esta pelcula por el bueno guin, la actuacin, y el gran trabajo del director (en especial la maniobra con las cmaras). Es una pelcula excelente y es una lastima que ya no este en produccin. Tienen que comprarla antes de que se termine y despus alguien la venda en 40 o ms dlares. Tienen que verla!",1232323200,2,551,4.349514563106796
