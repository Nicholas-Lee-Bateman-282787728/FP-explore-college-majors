I'm so pleased with how my first realistic drawing came out.  I am SO anxious to do some more tomorrow evening.  I just know this is going to greatly improve my attempts at portrait drawing.  Also, important, the instructor, Ethan speaks with a very clear, well-modulated tone - at a good pace! Simple, easy to follow.  Makes sense.  It's just what I needed at this stage in developing a talent.  Thank you!!!",1385424000,2,558,4.680412371134021
