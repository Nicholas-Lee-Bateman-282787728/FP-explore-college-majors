7682813,3,B01CGLZLQI,"Although ""What We Have"" is in both French and English (with optional subtitles), it is very much a French film stylistically. Maurice is a French ex-patriot relocated to Northern Ontario. He apparently has had a troubled past, told in bits and pieces of flashbacks throughout. I have serious reservations with the director's choice of the opening scene, which suggests that Maurice's mysterious past begins with his being released from jail since we first see him in handcuffs being led down a hallway by a police officer. Cut to his driving down a road to the Northern Ontario city that is to become his home. We see him get involved in several quickie sex encounters with other adults, one involving a nice guy that he practically kicks out of his bed the following morning. Later it turns out that the nice guy is the manager of a French theater company, which hires Maurice to star as Harpagon in their new production of Moliere's ""The Miser."" Due to the low pay, Maurice must moonlight as a French tutor and soon acquires his one and only student, Allan. The teenage boy has no friends and is being persecuted by other boys who call him a ""f----t"" and even urinate on him in a locker room used for swimming practice. The swimming pool is also a public pool, where Maurice himself swims regularly. (Talk about coincidence!) Maurice is on hand to come to the boy's rescue on more than one occasion. The boy's French improves as he falls in love with his tutor. How the tutor responds is the crux of the movie. Among other things, we learn that Maurice was sexually abused by his stepfather, who apparently married Maurice's mother to get his hands of her child. Thus, the writer and/or director plays games with the audience, suggesting that due to Maurice's abused childhood, he himself might be a pedophile seducer. The opening scene actually details the aftermath of an event that comes late in the film when Maurice comes to Allan's defense when he is attacked by another boy. Because Maurice has become a sympathetic father figure for a gay teen, he is quickly blamed by others as being a pedophile, which he definitely is not. This is why the opening scene is so dishonest as to suggest to the audience that he is. While Maurice's past may have fractured him in many ways, he does have boundaries and keeps within them.",1480032000,2,2328,4.680487804878049
7682814,4,B01CGLZLQI,"This film is filled with attractive characters whom you may wish to know better, a wish that will be only partially fulfilled.  The scenes and action that we experience along the way -- some occurring in artful flashbacks  -- will keep you interested and involved (though sometimes disapproving of our protagonists' choices), but leave you wondering just what destination we've arrived at in the end.  The setting is a scenic town in northern Canada, but this emotional journey could take place just about anywhere. It is a story of self discovery and self deception and maybe self destruction.  Still, you can't help rooting for these guys.",1478476800,,641,5.018867924528302

7682816,5,B01CGLZLQI,"Most of us who identify ourselves as gay knew very early on that we are. The passages through fear and prejudice may have arrived at something akin to more acceptance by those who think it is something we did to ourselves, but we're not there yet. In far too many places, even in the so-called developed world, gay is still considered to be a perversion, to be stamped out. This film looks into the heart just how needy younger people are for love and acceptance.",1473984000,9,463,4.458823529411765

7682819,1,B01CGLZLQI,"Empty.  This movie went no where.  It had potential, but the producers and writers dropped the ball.  I am disappointed.  The French guy, migrated from France to Canada, obviously with a troubled past, meets a gay director of plays interested in him, but he shuns him away, then meets a 15 year old who admits he is gay and comes on to him, but in the end, nothing happens between the two.  What a trip.  I feel like I just got into my car, turned on the ignition, shifted into drive, and drove the car around the parking lot, but in the end, I am parking in the same spot I started from.  So where did I go?  nowhere.  Where did the movie take me.  Nowhere!",1471564800,8,658,4.150793650793651

7682821,4,B01CGLZLQI,"Maurice (Maxime Desmons) has relocated from Paris to a small North Canadian town. He is running away from a past that he can not face and decides to get a job acting as that is his profession. The pay though is basic so he advertises to tutor in French. His advert is answered by the mother of Alan  a withdrawn but talented teenager.

Maurice seems to alienate all around him despite his abilities but Alan finds him to be inspirational. Meanwhile Maurice is trying to fit in at the theatre but even as his acting is excellent the disaffected youth whom he is tutoring starts to get to him through the boys overt needs.

Now this is a really well made and intentioned film. Alex Ozerov as Alan is superb (actually from Russia originally) and the story line is original and engaging, some of the back story is told in flashback and that is done with real style too. This is a film that is gay themed but would be easily for a wider audience as the themes are universal and I have to see I appreciated this very much indeed.",1462752000,14,1023,4.345549738219895
