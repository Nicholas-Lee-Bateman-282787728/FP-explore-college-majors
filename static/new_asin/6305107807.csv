967487,3,6305107807,"I've been a Family Practice Clinician for 5 years and a yoga practioner for more than 25 years.  One thing holds true for both medicine and yoga: everyone's needs are different.  This tape is perfect for the woman who  wants to relax and get more comfortable with the changes in her body before  she brings her baby into the world.  Though neither the classic Hatha nor  physically demanding Astanga styles, the Kundalini practices in this video  are quite challenging, both physically and mentally.  It is a bit ""New  Age"" oriented, which some viewers may not care for-try to get get past  the turbans and the chanting.  The breathing techniques and the  encouragement to ""let yourself be uninhibited"" are quite valuable  to help prepare for the labor and delivery process.",955065600,26,774,4.906976744186046
967488,4,6305107807,"I was looking for something VERY relaxing & this was just the thing.  The chanting takes some getting used to, but I'm relaxed yet energized every time I do this video.  This video is just right for beginners &  very uplifting during what can be an uncomfortable & stressful time.  This video is helping me enjoy my pregnancy more--well worth the $$.  My 2  year old is even starting to mimic some of the poses!",952905600,6,411,4.413333333333333
967489,5,6305107807,I don't quite understand the turban thing but the content of the video was great.  I've done yoga on/off for the past couple of years and I can honestly say that the postures and relaxing atmosphere were a great benefit  to me.  I really found time in my day to do this for myself and I know I've  felt calmer and centered because of it.  I look forward to having my baby  so I can use her other one available.,950572800,4,410,4.0625
967490,5,6305107807,"I'll admit that the instructor was a little airy, but I'm into new things, so I gave it a try.  I would be embarassed to ""get caught"" by my husband with the video on, but I am that way with any exercise video.  The  visualization and dancing really did help me feel strong, which as she  said, did help me feel able to survive labor.  When I felt tired and achy  working with the video RENEWED me, taking away the pains, and making me  smile, smile at everyone.  Really!  I had energy, if I did it in the a.m. I  could work a full day.  Anyone who thought it ""too goofy"" just  didn't have an open mind.  Try it for a few days, you'll see.  I just wish  all of my friends were as open minded as me.  The program could have made  preg & labor much easier for them.",948758400,25,762,3.973333333333333
967491,5,6305107807,"I got this video in my fifth month. I was very hesitant at first, like many of you I was unsure of how I felt about the chanting and new age feel that this video has.  BUT, after I got over that I loved this video.  I am more  flexible, strong and relaxed than I have ever been.  I have 5 weeks left in  my pregnancy and I have yet to have any of the pain, swelling, headaches,  or general grouchiness that so many of the women in my childbirth class  have been complaining about. I was the least active person in the world  before I started doing yoga, now if I don't do it I feel like I am missing  something all day.  I will do this untill I have the baby and after.  I  highly reccomend it.",947462400,,694,3.9136690647482015
967492,5,6305107807,"Not only is this a great yoga workout it is all around fabulous!  The chanting at first, (which only lasts the first 2 minutes and very little in between) can strike you funny, but can be very releasing.  I tried and sure  I laughed the first time but before I knew it I was chanting right along  with the group.  We are just not used to this in our culture.  With an open  mind and open spirit the chanting can be very soothing once you accept it.  I found the instructor to be wonderful.  I loved all the talking she does  and the affirmations she has to say about pregnancy.  She really made me  feel very femine, in touch with my baby and in touch with my own feelings  about pregnancy.  Since this is my first pregnancy I found her guidance to  be very helpful and loving.  I actually felt great about my body as I was  doing the poses.  There was also a chance to release fears through  breathing to a one word chant that really released me.  I am also a very  active person and have a hard time finding exercise video's challenging  enough for me and this one was.  Not difficult in the content but difficult  because I am not used to stretching my hips and pelvis the way she guides  you.  By the way, the hip and pelvis poses took away my lower back ache.  I  was invigorating after this video.  This video may not be for everyone  because of the chanting as some reveiws before me have stated.  If you have  an open mind and are looking for a video that will get you in touch with  your ever changing pregnant body while doing something good for it this is  for you.  I highly recommend it!  The breathing techniques and endurance  exercise she has in there I plan on taking to the delivery room with me.  Please try this video even if you are skeptical.  I was skeptical because  of the reviews before mine and bought it anyway and I am so glad I did!  This is truly a video I will treasure throughout my pregnancy.  By the way,  do not be intimidated by her turbon.  She is a beautiful women that has her  own style.  There are days I would rather wear a turbon on my head instead  of dealing with it.  Plus it keeps me curious as to what her hair looks  like under that thing.  If you want to do something nice for yourself  during pregnancy, wait no more and get this video!  Happy chanting, posing  and relaxing to all!",947116800,39,2334,4.210045662100456
967493,1,6305107807,"I have done yoga with previous video tapes but was not sure what stretches I should and should not do once I became pregnant. That is why I bought this video specifically for moms to be.  I should have known when the  instructor appeared wearing a turban that this video was going to be  ""out there"". I wanted structured stretching and relaxation. This  video included foreign chanting and free style stretching. You are  instructed to just let your body move freely to the music.  I felt I was  doing some kind of tribal dance.  After my first viewing and attempt at  participating, I immediately went for Amazon's return policy on videos. I  was disappointed to learn that for videos, once opened, can not be  returned. I think I will donate this one to the local library. My husband  still comments on what a waste of money this purchase was.",945388800,47,845,4.597315436241611
967494,3,6305107807,"I've been doing yoga for over 5 years now and I've found it to be really helpful for strength, toning, and relaxation.  When I suddenly found myself pregnant (at 39), I wanted to continue with my yoga practice, but wanted to  be sure the poses were compatible to pregnancy.  So, I bought this video,  hoping for guidance since I don't have a teacher right now. While the  philosophy of yoga has always interested me, I was hoping for more work  with postures and less talk about how wonderful yoga is for me and for my  baby.  At this point, I'm hoping to find either another video with more  poses or a teacher who can give me a safe program.  I'm really disappointed  with this video.",941760000,48,686,4.408
967495,4,6305107807,"I love this video! The class of women on the tape are in all stages of pregnancy, and they are not the usual models and actresses we often see on exercise videos, but instead, real people.  The female yogi(also noticeably  pregnant) leads a very relaxing series of movements with some spiritual  visualization and a small amount of yoga chanting--which is all nice  without being too much. The accompanying music is played live in the back  of the class (flutes and strings) and many of the movements are extrememly  natural, not difficult at all.  You can do this tape right up to labor  because the movements are geared towards opening up the body and joints  with torso stretching and lots of arm reaches, plus repetitive squating to  train the legs and pelvis to open up easily in preparation for birth. I was  completely out of shape when I started, but I could finish the video with a  little bit of effort and didn't feel overwhelmed. There's also some small  isometric squeezes to strengthen the legs and arms and a small amount of  semi-aerobic movements that are so gentle they get your heart moving ever  so easily.  Plus, the yogi uses the calming sound of her voice to get you  to imagine wonderful things about having your baby and calming images about  the labor process. All this is done without too much syrup or new-age  religious connotations, which I appreciate very much.  I'd highly recommend  this to any pregnant woman, especially one who can't get herself going in  more traditional types of exercise and wants to do a minimalist physical  program to get her body warmed and loose and feeling great.",928886400,136,1624,4.741935483870968
967585,5,6305107807,"I love this dvd.  You can read all the other reviews about how the instructor wears a turban, chants, etc. Keep in mind that unlike most of the polished western produced yoga dvds, this one actually honors the heart of yoga.  Yoga isn't just about exercise!

A little about me; I'm in my third trimester, have been working out regularly throughout my pregnancy, do low cardio several times a week and prenatal swim class.  I wanted to find a yoga dvd to round me out, and this is it for me.

This dvd is a solid workout for the end of your second and all of your third trimesters.  I tried it in my first and early second tri and it was way too easy.  It incorporates a lot of flowing yoga movement and breathing.  Lots of exercises that will really prepare you for birth; squats, kegels, pelvic floor work.  There is also chanting to connect with your baby and to honor yourself in your pregnancy.  And there is an interesting endurance section that has you do simple, repetitive (but eventually challenging) movements that help you prepare to emotionally deal with labor.

Best of all!  There are NONE of the typical, overdone yoga postures!!  No downward dog, no triangle pose, etc!

If you are tired of the typical Gaiam boring dvds or obvious hollywood yoga sets, then try this one.  It really honors the spirit of yoga, and honors what pregnancy is all about - connecting with your baby, and really getting in tune with your body.",1245024000,6,1436,4.533073929961089
967586,2,6305107807,"I love going to prenatal Yoga classes and thought this DVD would be nice to have for days I can't make it to class.  At first I didn't think it was all that terrible.  But the more I do it, the less and less I like it.  One of the main reasons I do prenatal Yoga is for the emphasis on breathing, inward focus, and mental relaxation in preparation for birth.  This lady DOES NOT STOP TALKING throughout the entire DVD!  And it's not even constructive talking..it's downright annoying!  It's hard to focus and relax when a twangy voice is droning on and on about how your womb is a carriage for your baby and how you should imagine squatting and giving birth in a jungle.  I have to do the entire thing on mute.  Some of the stretches aren't that bad, but nothing I can't do on my own.  There are none of your traditional Yoga poses.  And, if sources which say that arching your back during pregnancy can be harmful, this DVD is dangerous as well.  I should've known by the overwhelming amount of 1 star ratings it received.  I only gave 2 stars because it's better to do some stretching than none at all, but only on mute :)",1244246400,,1124,4.25
967587,5,6305107807,"This was a great way to relax during pregnancy and to prepare for natural childbirth. The workout is moderately paced and the instructor offers many encouraging, soothing words. I LOVE THIS DVD!!! I've used it for two pregnancies and let my friends borrow it for theirs. Everyone enjoyed it!!!",1240963200,,293,5.0
967588,1,6305107807,"I watched for 10 minutes and I had to stop. They make you chant at the beginning as a part of the workout and it's really creepy. I was looking for a nice workout, not an introduction to a new religion.",1227139200,,202,3.951219512195122
967589,3,6305107807,"I was at my 16 weeks when I started to use this DVD. This is my first pregnancy. I enjoy exercising and before I got pregnant, I go to the gym at least once a week. I enjoy challenging lower-body toning exercises, bodycombat (high-cardio) classes, machine-weights to tone my upper body. I have done beginner to intermediate yoga classes and do not have a very flexible body. I now swim twice a week (20 minutes) and exercise to this DVD every other day.

The instructor is not pregnant in this video and looks very ""zen-ish"" with her head dress (a white turban looking thing). The video starts out with a 10-15 minute clip of her talking about how yoga is good for the mother and the baby.

During the next 5 minutes or so, she instructs the class to sit in an upright cross-legged position, with eyes closed and chant to a language I do not understand. Apparently, it means ""I bow to the divine power in myself"" or something to that effect. I find this section disturbing and do not like the sound of it at all, so I typically fast forward to the point where the lesson proper begins.

The class has a live band playing at the back of the room. Music is okay. The venue looks rather old-fashioned. However, lighting was okay. You will see some camera man moving behind the flowers and pillars once in a while. The women were dressed in big T-shirts and tights, others in full body suits. They have make-up on, and some look quite pretty and attractive. Nothing fanciful or appealing about the set, in general.

The next 30-minute section has very good exercises to help a pregnant woman stretch and relax her body. Gentle stretches and exercises that are only enough to get my heartbeat up by a little. However, even though the exercises are simple, I feel very good after at the end of it. I feel good to have stretched the thighs, arms, toes, calves, lower and upper back, neck, kegel muscle. All in all, if you are looking for a non-strenuous and gentle stretching exercise to help you to remain flexible and to relief stiff joints and aches, this would be the DVD. One thing to note, the instructor in this video emphasizes a lot on ""feeling"" the movements in the body and to release all inhibitions.

This is not the DVD if you are looking to tone those hips, butts and thighs and sweat it all out.

The video ends with another session of chanting (which I skip). Apparently, the words are supposed to heal and give you strength or something like that. And after that, we all lie down and close our eyes to relax, as with all yoga classes.

I am still waiting for two DVDs to arrive:
1) The Perfect Pregnancy Workout
2) Shiva Rea Prenatal Yoga",1208217600,,2649,4.449484536082474
967590,4,6305107807,"Kinda silly looking as I guess it's ""look"" is quite outdated now.  But this video is wonderful.  It's very gentle and easy but felt great when I was 7 months and beyond during my pregnancy.  I feel it's focus is much more towards preparing and opening a woman's body for birth rather than a typical yoga workout.

Retrospectively, it was this video and all the yogic philosophy that goes along with it that allowed me to birth naturally.",1205884800,2,437,4.564102564102564
967591,1,6305107807,"I have been practicing yoga for over seven years now with a studio, through various classes, and using home DVDs when my schedule is hectic.  I did a fair bit of reading about prenatal yoga once I found out we were pregnant, and I knew my body would be very happy to have the yoga continue to help my back and my poor sciatic wonky-hip pain.  My yoga studio has a prenatal class, but the schedule does not work with mine so I thought I would get a DVD to supplement until I could make it to classes again.

This was not the right video for me.  There was too much discussion, too much commentary, and not enough actual yoga going on for my taste.  I did not appreciate this woman attempting to facilitate my relationship with my ""bay-bay"" (hug your bay-bay, dance with your bay-bay, your bay-bay loves it when you do this move, etc).  I have my own special time 24/7 with this beeb in my belly, and I did not get this dvd to inform me of the fact that I'm supposed to hug and love my belly.  I needed some quiet time (she never stops talking) with some gentle moves to keep my back happy, my body moving, and my mind at ease.  This DVD is currently sitting by the door as I will not use it again.

I'm not sure why I didn't just go with the Gaiam dvd... it is now on order.",1199404800,,1273,4.080321285140562
967592,1,6305107807,The music was very distracting it was hard to hear or think over it. I guess I could have turned down the volume and just watched... :) I would not recommend this to a friend though.. :( :(,1198800000,,189,4.0
967593,3,6305107807,"I am seven and a half months pregnant, and I've been using this DVD since the start of my pregnancy. While I enjoy much of it (including the new-agey parts!), it is really best suited for those who enjoy a flowing, vinyasa or ashtanga style practice.

I personally prefer hatha-style yoga, so this is not my favorite prental yoga DVD (see my review for ""Prenatal Yoga with Shiva Rea""). But overall, this DVD provides a nice way to relax and move around a bit in your pregnancy.",1192406400,,477,4.482758620689655
967594,1,6305107807,"I am pregnant with my first and bought this dvd along with Leslie Hartt's Fit Mama while looking for an exercise routine.  I started out with Fit Mama and was having so much fun, that I didn't try this one for several weeks.  Well I finally opened it and was surpised in a very bad way.  The instructor is just rediculous. I skipped her intro, so I could be wrong, but she certainly doesn't appear pregnant (although most of the audience looks to be near 8 months).  I will admit that I broke a sweat doing her exercises, but her ridiculous chantting and new age comments are extremely annoying. Also, I think she is probably pushing pregnant women who did not work out regularly before pregnancy a little too hard without suggestion on how they could still use her video. (Leslie recommends only doing certain chapters for instance).",1186358400,,834,4.614864864864865
967692,1,6305107807,"I was extremely disappointed in this DVD. I've done yoga from DVDs before and have never been so annoyed at the instructor as to actually stop what I was doing and fast forward through. The instructor is too out there for me...Telling me to imagine squatting in a forest to give birth while I'm squatting on the mat? Asking me to chant her name? I enjoy connecting with my body and baby but this is just too over-the-top. I can't believe this was ever marketed to the mainstream - even the editing is bad. The primal dance scene is pretty funny, though.",1182384000,,553,4.431372549019608
967693,1,6305107807,"This DVD didn't play, either in my DVD player, or my computer. Returning it was a hassle, and I was still charged for shipping. These DVDs should really be tested at the factory, or wherever they are burned, to make sure they function properly!",1178928000,,244,4.568181818181818
967694,5,6305107807,"Wow, I would really recommend this dvd to all pregnant women.  Don't let the other reviewers scare you away when they talk about the ""New Ageness"" of the workout and the (gasp!) primal dancing.  It's yoga, for crying out loud, not jazzercise!  I loved all of the exercises, and I'd especially recommend it for women that intend to give birth naturally.

As for getting into the spiritual aspect of it -- I'm not exactly spiritual in my daily life, but it's nice to go along for the ride when the yoga instructor tells you that God is in control.  I just translate it to mean that I can trust my body to know what to do, and that I'm not in charge, and my big brain isn't going to be much help during labor.  I hope that moms-to-be will consider being open to the possibility that this dvd will be good for them, and for their babies, too!",1177200000,2,838,4.272151898734177
967695,5,6305107807,"I absolutely have feelings of gratitude for this prenatal yoga workout. It seems the exercises designed in this tape are mysteriously targeted towards easing the exact pains I'm experiencing as a pregnant woman.

I have been a yoga instructor for several years and stopped teaching after becoming pregnant. I was feeling so nauseous and suffering from such tightness in my legs that I could not maintain my traditional rigorous workout. Seeking a good tape, I found this to be excellent.

Granted, this workout would be quite dull for an un-pregnant woman; but my pregnant body seems to respond so well to the exercises, particularly stiffness in the joints and low back pain.

As for New Age, I generally like that type of teaching (more or less depending on my mood at the time) but I am really digging it during pregnancy. I like the talk of ""nature"" and allowing your body to embrace its natural rhythm. During this uncertain time in life where your body and mind are doing things you have no control over, it feels good to calm down and simply embrace that natural method which allows you to be who you are.",1163030400,,1112,4.6923076923076925
967696,1,6305107807,"I did not even make it through this tape, as the instructor began the New-Age-speak right away.  I am interested in relaxation and execution, not locating my ""third eye"".  If you are like me, skip it.",1161043200,,200,4.527777777777778

967698,5,6305107807,"I used this program through both of my pregnancies.  I have to admit, the chanting is a little strange at first, but if you approach it with an open mind and relax into it...it isn't that bad.  I actually started to like it, and am picking up the postnatal tape because I grew so fond of it.  I do have to say, if you are chanting and your husband or 6 year old walk in--you will start to giggle and so will they.  My 6 year old actually liked to do the tape with me. The only part I didn't like was the free-form dance section, so I would just sway and watch the ladies on the tape at that point.",1151625600,,597,3.909090909090909
967699,3,6305107807,"This workout is very meditative.  I am not a meditative type, so maybe that is why I didn't benefit from it like others might have.  I was looking for a prenatal yoga workout that would help stretch my body and get my circulation going.  Since I am used to more advanced yoga moves, I was a bit bored with this workout.  It made my back feel good, but that was it.

I felt funny doing it.  My husband walked in when I was doing the ""imagine you are a swaying tree"" move and was laughing.  Gets you ""in tune"" with your baby, but didn't feel like a good workout for me.",1142899200,2,567,4.054054054054054

Even if you only have time once a week to pop this DVD in, you will still feel the many benefits this method has to offer.  I personally love the live ""band"" playing and the soothing voice of the instructor on this DVD.  But, I can see where someone not familiar with yoga might think it's corny.  This DVD is not for someone who is just deciding to try yoga because they are pregnant.  For me it provided a smooth transition from regular Hatha practice to a prenatal program.  I have taken various prenatal yoga classes, but have still found this DVD to be the most enriching and challenging.  There is a lot of dancing and movement which feels so much better than some of the ""stand and pose"" types of classes I've had. My best advice is to sample different prenatal classes and come up with a program you feel comfortable with.  One DVD program is not the end-all-be-all of your prenatal yoga practice.",1140134400,3,1001,4.4021739130434785

967792,4,6305107807,"Yes, she wears a turban.  Yes, she talks new-agey - my personal favorite is telling us to get back in touch with the ancient women who used to head into the woods, squat down and pop that kid out on a bed of pine needles - LOL.

As comedy it works, but as workout it excels.  Turban lady created a workout I enjoyed doing and did throughout my entire pregnancy.  No one could get over how flexible and engergized I was right up to delivery day.  Mother nature dealt me a good hand for sure, but I give a lot of credit to this tape.

Aerobics queens may be thrown at first by the mellower than mellow vibe, and the goal here is certainly not to ""feel the burn"".  This is a safe and totally appropriate workout for women who want to make the most of thier constantly changing body.

I loved it.",1136419200,4,792,4.130718954248366
967793,4,6305107807,"Of the four prenatal yoga videos/dvd's I've been using, this is my favorite as a workout. The emphasis on lower body and, especially, squatting is very compatible with Bradley Method exercises if you are preparing for natural childbirth. The ""New Age"" overtones don't particularly bother me--it's easy enough to tune them out, if you wish, by the third or fourth time of doing the workout. My only complaint is the production values. The VHS version that I am using has poor sound quality--I have to keep the remote nearby to constantly turn the sound up, then down again--and the camera crew has a tendency to focus on the participants instead of the instructor as she is demonstrating moves. This can make it difficult to figure out what, exactly, you're supposed to be doing. And, as others have noted, the instructor tends to philosophize rather than offering detailed descriptions of the best way to do the moves. However, if you already have some yoga experience and know how to do these poses correctly, you'll find this to be one of the better pre-natal yoga workouts out there.",1123027200,5,1086,4.844086021505376

Lead by the original pre-natal yoga teacher,  her technique of exercise, breathing and vocalization really helps you get physically and emotionally ready for having a baby.  It helped me be strong, relaxed and unafraid of the experience so I didn't fight the contractions; I rode them out.  Your baby will thank you for using this video to prepare yourselves.

967796,3,6305107807,"I actually liked the ""workout"".  I even got sweaty, which I did not expect (especially since I'm used to tougher pilates and yoga, and cardio/weights), but that's because I really tried to ""work"" while I was drowning out the crazy guru lady.  I really thought she was a nut job.

Still, I enjoyed the stretching and the thinking about things she was saying once in awhile.  I kept thinking they looked a little cultish following their preguru.  There was one part where I got kind of emotional and weepy, but I think that's just because I'm at 10 weeks.  I could also see this being a pretty easy/comfortable workout at 30 weeks.

I did not chant at all.  No way. Not my thing.  Although I could see myself setting this up (in the privacy of my own home!) with some dim lights or candles and really getting into it (there is a lot of eyes closed balancing and swaying).  I'm emo that way these days.

I'd do this again, it was incredibly relaxing to do after a long work day and to get right into bed afterwards, while I was so super relaxed, was just heavenly.",1107302400,,1061,4.362244897959184

The teacher also has you do movements that I disagree with, movements that I think if you have a bad back can injure you.  Also it is a little too 'New Agey"" for me.  The teacher is dressed in a turban and long white robe which would have been fine if there was actual yoga moves involved.",1097798400,2,427,3.976470588235294
967799,2,6305107807,"This workout helped alleviate my back pain, but I still wouldn't recommend it, mainly because the wacky instructor is so distracting! She talks incessantly in a breathy voice (think Julie Hegarty in ""Airplane"") about the goofiest things. When she asked viewers to ""imagine squatting in the forest 1,000 years ago"" I had to stop exercising and laugh for a bit. Really ridiculous stuff.

Plus I was disappointed that she didn't concentrate on form at all. I think a responsible instructor would give more attention to breathing techniques, alignment,and proper form to help prevent knee and back injury. Luckily, I had already taken classes with a more conventional instructor, so I knew a bit about this. Other viewers might not be so lucky.

As long as I've already paid for this, I'll probably continue to use it. But I'll turn on the mute and fast forward through the goofy chanting from now on.",1094083200,,897,4.894736842105263

Although I believe in meditation it's not something I practice regularly, so I enjoy the spiritual component of this video.  The biggest benefit is the relief from my lower back and hip pain in part due to the pregnancy, but also from some slight scoliosis.  I rotate this video with other workouts, but if my back and hips are acting up then I automatically select this workout for the relief it brings.  Also, I tend to hold a lot of tension in my muscles and have found that I am much more relaxed and loose after completing this video.

967892,1,6305107807,"Gurmukh takes her ""yoga"" VERY seriously. Indeed, her intense relaxation is made even less relaxing by her grating voice. She seems to be pleading and whining for your admiration (but in a very ""relaxed"" way, of course.) If you're looking for a California guru, she might be just what the Maharishi ordered (she's got a turban to prove it). But if you're looking to bond with your baby, take private, mindful breathes, and find a ""yoga-mind"" for your pregnancy then look elsewhere. We sent this tape right back and got YogaMama, the Crunch DVD. Surprisingly, although Crunch has a rep as a powerhouse NY workout, YogaMama has all the true reverence, mindfullness, and spirit that this one lacks.

It's unclear whether this is actually yoga. Don't let the turban fool you, underneath it is a California New Age girl who just talks incessantly. It's not suprising that they don't show the star of this video on the cover.

So if I am not in the mood to participate through the entire workout I can pick one section at at time. I personally found the chanting to be very invigorating. Also, the free form dance, which is meant to help you move and expand your hips, made me feel very emotional and connected to my baby--so much so that I actually started to cry. This video is, obviously by the other reviewers comments, not for women who favor generic workouts like Fit Mama, etc. If you like real yoga, the kind that allows and assists you to get in touch with your body and emotions, this will be your favorite video.",1080604800,10,914,4.446428571428571

I don't have any yoga experiance and found the moves to be relaxing and calming.
The instructor has a calming voice that i found relaxing as well.

This was the first time I tried Yoga, but it has got me hooked.  It was easy to learn, and remained a challenge throughout.  Great for people who view birth as a beautiful experience - not only a great workout, but also a great birthing preparation video.  She speaks a lot about the birthing experience and how spiritual it is.
After viewing, I feel very bonded with my baby and I feel energized,  yet relaxed.  Helps relieve my back pain and uncomfort due to growing tummy.  I'm currently in my seventh month and its working great.  Has helped me to be more flexible, coordinated and able to move freely with my big tummy :).
There are ten women in the class on the video so you get to see a range of women performing each exercise.  This video was a great challenge for me my first time and as I practice more it gets much easier.  The perfect workout for pregnancy.  You can take it very easy or you can try to challenge yourself.  I had reviewed ALL of the other prenatal videos out there and this is my favorite. Some do not like the chanting on this video, but was a great release for me and made me feel closer to the baby.

It helped me to forget the stress and totally relax and enjoy my pregnancy. I always felt very connected to my baby and this video gave me time to focus on just her. Everything was smooth and easy, nothing painful, but the stretches were invigorating and carefully focused on preparation for labor and delivery. I had a relatively quick and easy l&d and I believe the physical exercises combined with the encouraging messages in this video contributed to that. I enjoyed the peaceful tone of this video. The background music (played by live musicians) was soothing yet energetic enough to inspire movement.

Please note, however, that this is not what you might expect if you're used to hatha yoga.  I was an avid practitioner of hatha yoga prior to pregancy, but these poses are much better geared toward pregnant women (especially in the 2nd and 3rd trimesters) than the traditional poses in a video like Power Yoga.  Also, there is a great deal of focus on the meditative side of yoga.  This focus has been a turn-off for many reviewers.  I admit that the chanting may make you feel silly at first, but it is very relaxing if you give it a chance.  If you don't like it, don't chant!

Some of the sentences include:""Imagine you are in a forest 1,000 years ago giving birth"". ""Your baby loves to dance"" etc. I wanted to turn it on mute but unfortunately would not have been able to hear the instructions.
The other missing gap in this video are the actual exercises, there is an overemphasis on doing squats (this was a problem for me as I have a bad knee). The instructor (women with a turban talking continously) is so busy talking about her view of the world that she misses the exercise descriptions. Unlike my in person classes where the instructor says ""inhale and exhale"" and explains how you can get the most benefit, the guru talks and talks.
I got nothing from this video. I tried to keep an open mind and just exercise but she was very annoying and the exercises are not well thought out. It's funny since the video is so spiritually based I really think they ought to put the guru's photo on the front rather than a normal pregnant woman.

This, actually, is not one of my favorite prenatal yoga videos. I prefer Rocki's Prental Yoga.
You enter a room full of about 20 moms - most of them look like good, wholesome midwest gals. That was a bit odd to me. I'd rather see a variety of women than a roomful of women who look similar. There's a string quartet in the back of the room and the yoga teacher sits in the front in a flowy white dress and white turban.
She explains the moves very well. However, you have to get through a lot of yoga meditation stuff in order to get to most of the moves. Even though you may be in the privacy of your own home, it quickly feels like you're sitting in a crowd of yoga wanna-bes who are all doing the ohmming and the chanting to reach an exalted state. I don't think it's that easy. And none of the class participants really look like they've achieved a higher state of being. They all look like they're trying very hard to succeed, though.
However, if you already meditate, you might really enjoy the video. Again, she does explain the moves well and they tend to be useful strengthening and stretching exercises.

The woman in the sleek leotard pictured on the front of the case is not the woman leading the video - she's not even in the class.  Instead of a streamlined workout, as is suggested by the picture, the teacher is dressed in a swami turban and weirdly swami-like outfit.  My husband (who does these videos with me) and I tried to get past that.  The angles the video is shot from shifts continually, making it difficult to follow moves.  Half the video or more she speaks in the new-age equivalent of psycho-babble in terms of new-age visualizations instead of focusing on the moves, or even meditation.  I was so bored long before this video ended that when this video ended I felt like a joyous kid at recess.  Neither I or my husband wish to run this video a second time.
My other yoga video, Yoga Zone, is better.  Actually, all of my other videos are better.  Kathy Smith is the best so far.

I like the imagry the yogi presents, but her methods are very bad for pegnant bodies ... arching your back when pregnant can cause all sorts of problems (see the book Essential Exercises for the Childbearing Year, by Elizabeth Noble for more details about why arching the baby is bad during pregnancy).

I did get a good sweat going, but it was hard to modify the movement not to arch my back, so I want to return the video.",1031875200,13,854,4.420382165605096

I have done many maternity yoga classes and this one is the clear leader! Most importantly, you can actually USE the tecniques and information given by the teacher DURING your delivery and labor! I used them with my first child and they made a BIG difference in the long but beautiful labor and delivery experience that I had (and I believe they are what saved me from having a C-Section after 72 hours of labor and delivering a 9lb plus baby). This is the one thing during pregnancy that you can really do for YOU. Also, you don't have to do this every day!  Even just once a week will provide you with the physical and emotional benefits offered.

So, that said, this was just not for me.  I watched it through before doing anything, as suggested.  The music, chanting and tone of the instructor was a bit distracting, since I need a more direct approach to communication.  I'm not a dancey kind of person, and that portion of the video was blah.  I was also not always exactly sure of the correct positions, and since all of the women did it a little differently, they were more confusing than helpful.  I did appreciate that all of the women were real-life people (read-normal).

There was a long primal dance section in the workout that made me feel downright silly to try, so instead I watched the women in the video writhe to new age music and the instructor's commentary.

This is for pregnant women who want to feel grounded and centered in their bodies, geared toward birth preparation. The video starts with floor ""stretches"" which really incorporate a lot of core strength work. Next you move to your feet and maintain a wide stance throughout most of the workout. After a few endurance exercises for the arms and legs, the program moves into a guided meditation to cool down and relax with, after more than 45 minutes of sweaty exercise. It is kundalini style yoga, which means most of the emphasis is on getting the spine nice and flexible to bring energy throughout the body, energy that is expressed more internally rather than in challenging poses. The instructor talks a lot to guide your mind through the exercises, which I found helpful, because it made me think less about giving up and more about why I need to do this. It is a nice video if you like a more aerobic workout, with the stretching built-in right along with fluid, repetitious, toning movements. Its nice for people who don't like traditional yoga or holding a tough pose, but for people who like to keep moving. Besides the 5 minutes of repetitive squatting, which may bother people who have pelvic issues, it is in all-level, work-at-your-own-pace program. All it takes to intensify the workout is focus on bringing more energy into each movement. Yoga advancement isn't all about achieving impressive postures. There are, however, many traditional postures that are good for pregnancy that this video did not include, such as warrior I & II and downward dog.

I am preparing for a natural birth, and believe that postures, stretches, endurance exercises, and dance movements taught in this program give you an ability to get comfortable with your body, learn how to ""feel on the inside"" and connect with your inner self and your baby. A calm, soothing voice of the instructor explains that we have been giving birth for thousands of years, until someone wrote a book on ""how to"". She makes you believe once again that birth is a natural, powerful, beautiful experience. Finally, the emphasis is placed on the magic power of breath and sounds, my favorite being ""Sat-nam"" - ""I am truth"", and ""Whah"" - the sound that releases your fears.
