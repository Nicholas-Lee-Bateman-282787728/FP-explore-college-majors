I bought this movie due to the post apocalyptic scenario, That's my Jam, End of the world, No more life, and Zombies.
I figured after seeing the trailer and having a shaun of the dead / 28 Days later start you would see something grand, or at least good and well you simply watch on to wait and see what happens, which is really nothing much, really nothing at all but movie bore!
One by one the characters see flashbacks that seem to tie them together, or so it seems, but it isn't until the end you figure out why.
Let's cut to the chase, This is the movie in a nutshell.  Something Bad happens to the place they all wind up in together and that place gets blown up, Kablooey... And the post apocalyptic scenario is some kind of heaven or hell slash terminal to go to either of the two (heaven or hell).
The person chasing them around the city is some sort of angel of death, soul collector.
Bam there I said it, thats the movie.
The characters are all dead and souls waiting in an abandoned London to be collected by the Grim Reaper, minus the sickle of course, and looking very much human.

Movie plot, ehhh ok.
Bore Factor - 10
Scare Factor - 5 ( there are a couple of ""Jump"" scenes)
Would I suggest you watch - If there's nothing on!
Would I buy again - Hell NO!",1422835200,4,1321,4.15234375
