8403502,4,B003RCJF8Q,"The film opens with the mass murder of seven children fourteen years ago. Claire (Meghan Ory) who was at the house has a mental blackout about the event. She suffers from nightmares and is prescribed medication. As an actress, she is part of a group that is going to work at a newly opened haunted house at said address with realistic holograms.

The haunted house holograms was the fun part of the film. The script had some decent dialogue by ""The Merchant of Adrenaline"". Bevin Prince provided the cleavage shots. Diane Salinger was our ghost horror. The ending has a slight twist. It has everything I want from a horror film except a shower scene.

Parental Guide: F-bomb. No sex. Fake torso nudity. Shelly Cole bra/panties.",1401840000,,727,4.761904761904762
8403503,3,B003RCJF8Q,"This is a direct to dvd movie I believe (or was mid 00's flick?), and it has the always excellent jeffery combs in it which is a big plus. This has the last decades low budget cgi effects to provide some good looking  special effects (mostly) , although some use of real effects , like on the exploding head scene would have actually been more effective. I agree with the one star reviewer that 80's movies were often better than todays. The reason being this that they used the good old human made effects in which they built  a head and then exploded it. cgi can really work in alot of cases, but at a budget it's best to mix effects probably. The cast is fine here and they do what they are supposed to. most of them had a least some acting experience and the lead actress really does a great job! However the ending is a bit nonsensical to be sure. But that's low budget horror for you. The picture looks fine. This like all most low budget horror isn't going amaze most people and at this point it's all been done before so the chills can't ever be new, and yet I still love HORROR movies. This is a decent average LOW BUDGET one and that's about it. But it could be worse for sure.",1310601600,,1187,4.201754385964913

Not scared in the least, sadly made in 2006 ...horror movies from the 80's are way better than this garbage!!",1298764800,,214,4.944444444444445
8403505,4,B003RCJF8Q,Very enjoyable B horror flick. Jeffrey Combs is about the only known actor of the bunch. Special effects were pretty good and the premise is pretty original. The ending is somewhat predictable but very good. Well worth the price of the rental....,1298764800,2,246,4.880952380952381
