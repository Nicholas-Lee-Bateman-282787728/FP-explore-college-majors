7563103,5,B0195N58RW,"Not since suffering through Robot Monster have I had such a great time disliking a film.  Are the effects are cheesy, the dialogue is trite, the story complete non-sense? Yes, yes, and hell yes.  All of these forces work together to create a long, rigid erection of terrible that vigorously attacks the senses and finishes off on your face, neck and chest.

The story concerns a reluctant group of would-be heroes, thrown together against their wishes - and their wills - to save the planet, and humanity itself, from certain annihilation at the hands of ruthless robot overlords. There's Stoner - a limp-wristed mama's boy pot-head who, in addition to dressing like Don Johnson from ""Harley Davidson and the Marlboro Man"", holds the secret to a Christ-like power to save humanity from itself.  Then there's Lottie - a hottie with daddy issues and a bitchy attitude. And who can forget, Bubba (I know I didn't) - the kind-hearted republican redneck that's full of snappy one-liners and more down home racist anachronisms than Paula Deen can shake a stick at. This motley crew is rounded out with the incomparable Dr. Beowolf - the tough-as-nails-no-nonsense-college-professor-father-figure who leads the two innocent college students and pro-succession hillbilly in this fight for the ages.

I can go on and get into the mind-bending plot, supply some spoilers (the robots did it...) but i'll just suffice with this.  Give the filmmakers of this masterpiece your money now! Buy this film NOW, watch it NOW, make it Christmas any day of the week by choosing the convenient one-click buying option.  Unwrap the joy, pop this baby in your VCR, settle down on your couch with a jug of Jergens and some Gatorade, and prepare to paint the ceiling....The Rise of the Robots is coming!!!",1451606400,,1779,4.96969696969697

It's a film that you'll want to watch over and over with a great group of friends.  They don't even have to be a great group of friends honestly, but it would be more fun if they were.  You could even watch this movie alone and still love it.  I bought five copies and play them on 5 separate TVs in one room just to spice things up.  By the time the credits roll, I have such a huge smile on my face I have to take a selfie.  There's nothing I hate more than a fake smile, and we're all guilty of them.

One day people will be dressing up as transvestites and showing up at movie theaters in droves for midnight showings of this cult classic. Bring your own squirt gun.

The best part was having Amazon deliver this with their new drone delivery agents. Being a light weight product and a classic Sci-Fi movie made it the perfect winner for the first drone deliveries.  (it was definitely them or USPS).

No. Wait. Is it the Zombie apocalypse? The Mayan's watch battery runs out?

Join ""Stoner"" in saving the world and bring plenty of snacks for afterwards.

If you attended Stephen F. Austin or live in East Texas, you are required to buy this film now. One day, you will look back and wish you had this film to show your children (you know, when corporal punishment is completely outlawed.) (Just kidding...)

It evokes nostalgic feelings for badly done FMV games and shoestring scifi, but despite being artificially aged to that gritty drive in grindhouse aesthetic... is set in cellphone era time.

If that bothers you, a mashup of styles and effects, consider yourself forewarned.  To expect things like logic or silly things like plot or... pfftt... production values... just go.  This is not your cup of motor oil.  This is a fun, silly, and brilliantly homage to a lot of cool things someone put in the blender.  There's a lot of love in it, and not much in the way of quality.

Two stars (as opposed to one star which means ""I hate it"") for effort I guess. I did think that the professor actually had some believable moments and the scenes of kids on their phones is pretty much exactly what I saw when Pokemon Go first came out.

You tried too hard. The contrived film-making makes me feel like I'm watching you rub your navel hairs into the camera lens instead of watching your movie, which is a horrific visual that I will have to repress in my memory for years to come.

7563187,1,B0195N58RW,"Be warned:  the 87% 5-star and 4.6 overall rating this movie got on amazon.com probably doesn't apply to you.  And maybe nobody else.

First, this is a low-budget, badly written, badly acted, and overall BAD movie.  It is boring.  It is tedious.  You will like it only if you like low-budget, badly written, badly acted, and overall BAD movies, such as the low-budget science-fiction movies of the 1950's, as do many of the people who gave it five stars.

Second, many of the five-star reviews are facetious, claiming the movie got the viewer a raise, or it's the greatest movie ever, or the greatest story ever told, or they got it only after watching it 17,000 times.  The authors appear to have chosen self-indulgent humor over serious criticism and public service.

Third, many of the five-star reviews appear suspect to me, such as
- those who have rated ONLY this movie and no other amazon product
- a ""film critic"" who has given five stars to every movie reviewed (granted, some of them are good)
- reviewers whose names are ""amazon customer""
- reviewers who rate almost every product and movie five stars
- the reviewer who claimed the movie was delivered by drone prior to December 14, 2015 when amazon was still testing a prototype in January of 2016 and today describes Amazon Prime Air (its drone program) as ""a future delivery service.""

Together what this means for you is this

THE 87% 5-STAR RATING AND 4.6 OVERALL ARE A GROSS OVERSTATEMENT OF THIS MOVIE'S QUALITY.  YOU MOST PROBABLY WON'T LIKE IT (exceptions:  see paragraph First).",1467504000,5,1550,4.760299625468165

Every time I watch this incredible film I weep. I weep for joy at seeing that man can overcome the hold of technology. I weep in deep sadness for the millennias worth of people who were unable to see this film because they are already dead. I weep with even more joy for the future generations not yet born that will see this film. This film by the great Herbert Midgley is a powerful one that all must see. Please watch it multiple times on Amazon Prime video, you will need to watch it at least 7 times to fully grasp its power but you will willingly watch it many times more:",1466553600,,723,4.171428571428572

What do you get when you pit a stoner, a pretentious scholar, a local yokel, and a young student hot for teacher against the onslaught of a robot invasion? A movie that does camp in all the right ways. Rise of the Robots parodies the conventions of sci-fi, criticizing the one-dimensional characters, narrative arc, and dramatic tensions that undergird this popular genre. We see sci-fi stripped down to the bones or, perhaps more precisely, its cogs, wheels, and pulleys. But while this film renders explicit the pitfalls of its genre, it also aims to reach its philosophical heights. Rise of the Robots asks us to consider the distinction between (wo)man and machine, examining the threat our technological dependence poses to our identities as humans and moral agents. Perhaps the film's only fault is that it could achieve in 50 minutes what it does in an hour and 15. Still, a fun film well worth a watch.",1464134400,,933,4.8375

It really is laugh-out-loud funny throughout thanks to dialogue (mostly Bubba's - sweet googly moogly!). The special effects and the perpetual red coloring (maybe it was just the TV I used?) make you feel a little out-of-this-world... If you are low on supply like Stoner, just watch this movie and it'll make you feel like you just smoked a fat one.

8744083,3,B0195N58RW,"In THE RISE OF THE ROBOTS, our mindless enslavement to technology is explained! We brought it all on ourselves, by launching the VOYAGER space probe back in 1977! It crashed on the planet Robotus, causing the robot inhabitants to unleash technological addiction upon us! Now, only Professor Beowulf, and two of his students, Stoner and Lottie, seem to see what's going on. Will they be able to stop an approaching robot invasion?  An insidious attack, predicted by the ancient Mayans? Joined by the lovable hillbilly, Bubba, our heroes set out to save the world from techno-apocalypse! THE RISE OF THE ROBOTS is a sub-zero-budget satire that takes aim at our obvious dependence on gadgets, especially ""smart phones"".  The clunky, garbage can robots and other intentional cheeeze, are -somewhat- fun, along w/ the semi-intermittent humor. No, this isn't STAR WARS, so don't expect anything overly, or even remotely spectacular. Instead, it's best to just go w/ it, and enjoy the utter cheapness of it all. Yes, at 84 minutes, it does go on eternally, but the good news is, you'll know within 10 seconds whether or not you can tolerate this sort of thing... P.S.- If boredom threatens to petrify your brain, see if you can count the number of times Stoner says, ""dude"" (for added fun, multiply this by pi)...",1498694400,2,1306,4.931818181818182
