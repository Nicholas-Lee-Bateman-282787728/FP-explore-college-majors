7924562,3,B00004W1ZR,"Somehow I was under the impression that this movie was based on ""Nathan's Run"" by John Gilstrap, but it's not.
However I enjoyed it and can recommend it to other Tim Matheson fans.",1397606400,,180,4.484848484848484
7924563,4,B00004W1ZR,"""Deadly Game"", also know as ""Hide and Seek"" and ""Catch Me If You Can"", is about a 12 year old boy, Nathan Thomas (listed in the credits simply as ""kid""), who witnesses a gangland murder and is taken into protective custody by down-and-out police detective Norm (Tim Matheson).  But street-smart and mischievous Nathan proves too much for Norm as he makes this a game of hide and seek.  It soon turns out to be a deadly game of cat-and-mouse phone-tag as Nathan retrieves a bag of cash that was hidden by the murdered gangster before he got rubbed out.  While Nathan lives high on the hog, Norm tries to find Nathan and protect him.  Because the gangsters want to find the kid, too.  They want their money back - and they want to eliminate the witness to their dirty deeds.  Families can enjoy this movie together.  The movie is fun and Ryan DeBoer makes it all worth watching.  I recommend it!",986169600,2,893,4.503105590062112
