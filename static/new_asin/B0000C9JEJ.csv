1916106,3,B0000C9JEJ,"When I first heard that there was a Final Fantasy series that was to be introduced as a DVD series in the US I was quite excited.  Certainly, as a game series, Final Fantasy has consistenly hit high marks in both story and graphics.  It seemed reasonalble to expect that the series, coming out at the same time as other series that have shown landmark levels of quality would be something to watch.  Alas, that is not the case.
A great tower of light suddenly plunges into the modern world, and titanic monsters appear in epic battles.  The world changes subtly as a darker presence begins to take possession of the shadows.  A pair of research scientists start an investigation, but disappear right after they publish a book about a strange underground world that seems to have appeared right under our feet.  Now it falls to Yu and Ai Hayakawa to try and find their parents.  The board an odd subway train, and are transported to...Wonderland.
In this DVD we take our first tour of wonderland, as the young children discover the mysteries and threats that surround then and acquire new companions like Lisa, who has her own special variety of 'martial arts,' and Kaze who uses a magical gun to carry out his role as a summoner (remember FF8 and FFX).  At present the story stays focussed at this level, a bit more fight and adventure oriented, although I expect that the serious story arcs will gradually become more important.
While the work is acceptible as standard Saturday morning cartoon fareit really lakes the flair that marks most Final Fanasty work.  In fact, other than some creatures like Chocobos, it really has very little in common with the Final Fantasy game series.  Scripting and character development are minimal, aimed at an audience that isn't quite ready for the complex relationship building which marks the show's namesakes.  And the artwork is interesting in spots, but more cartoon-like, reminiscent of  than the originals.
A quick glance at the credits shows that there is very little cross over between the game creators and the series staff.  This explains many of the little gaps that make the show confusing for a long time fan.  If one approaches this as an independent work rather than as an heir to one of gaming's greatest lineages, then it is an acceptable and entertaining series.  Buy if you are looking for the world of Gaia, peopled with Yuna's, Strife's, and Vivi's you are going to be disappointed, as I was.",1067472000,30,2452,4.763593380614657

7998306,5,B0000C9JEJ,"Oh, wow. I can't complain much about this. Although some things I didn't notice explained and the ending was a little rushed, this was still very effective on me. It may've been better as a game or not, I don't know. There were several times where this made me so emotional I wanted to cry for the characters. The silent and melancholy Kaze, the hilarious and deranged Cid or the hyperactive and cheerful twins. Even for the short time you know them, they grow on you and what becomes of some of them is just extremely heartwrenching. I know some people may not be satisfied with this, but I was. I recommend it!",1118880000,2,612,4.424778761061947
7998307,1,B0000C9JEJ,"I have not heard much good about Final Fantasy Unlimited, but I decided to give the show a chance since I am a Final Fantasy fan. The show did bring in many bits and pieces from the game series such as Chocobos, the character Cid, many summon creatures, and did a pretty good job with the fantasy setting. Another positive for the show is the voice acting is overall, very good. The voices fits with the characters and the dubbing is well done. Unfortunatley, these are only good remarks I have about the show.

What is wrong with the show- quite a few things. First of all, the animation is odd. The combination of 3D graphics and 2D graphics did not fit together. Also, many different animation sequences were used over and over again through the entire show. The show would have been better if all their time was spent on the 2D animation- adding shading, looking to see if characters looked proportional, and definitely better character design. Of all the anime shows I have seen, this series takes the cake for the worst looking characters. I'm not talking about the main characters for they are fine, but the secondary characters and enemys look like they belong in a kiddy show. Because of this horrible character design, it was difficult for me to get into the show. Here is an example- the army of good guys are dressed in gray body suits with bulky black gloves, boots, and hoods; they have no muscle or facial definition at all and some of them appear fat; worst of all were their weapons- long pipes with which they blow darts out of. I often found myself laughing at the characters since they looked too ridiculous to be menacing or realistic.

Another big problem with the show was it became very predictable. In every single show, an enemy attacks the good guys and Kaze uses his weapon, the magon, to save the day. The show quickly became boring. What annoyed me the most was the overkill with the chocobo pulling the little heroine girl's piggy tails. It wasn't funny the first time and it was dang annoying by the tenth time. Another predictable thing was each time the show showed the evil emperor, he was eating some odd meal and loosely going over their evil plans. The writers had plenty of things to go more deeply into such as the conflict with Makenshi and his brother, Kaze's past and romance. I have seen tid bits of the manga and I believe a lot was left out.

Speaking of leaving things out, this is the last problem I had with Final Fantasy Unlimited. At the end, there are many things I wanted to find out, mostly who died and who survived the final battle. It is left unknown if the kids, their parents, and the other main characters survived the ordeal and return home. Also, the show never tells if the destroyed planets are restored. Then there is the whole thing about the horrible monster Omega and how his crystal fragments are scattered about Wonderland. The show needed an extra episode or two to tie up these loose ends.

I came with low expectations for the show and even then I was still disappointed. I highly suggest you don't waste your money on buying the dvd set or renting it.",1116201600,9,3125,4.525663716814159
7998308,1,B0000C9JEJ,"The only other FF material I've see is the movie and I didn't play any of the games yet so I'm not basing this review on that. After watching the first 3 dvdsand about 1/2 through the show i can say for me this show sucked.

 The animation was bland and ugly looking. The C.G animation which was produced by GONZO was poor and didn't blend in at all.  (If you want good works by GONZO check out Full Metal Panic, Vandread, Hellsing, Gatekeepers and a few others).

 The plot was seemed to aimed at kids under 12. 2 kids and an adult woman get on a train in an abandoned train station that leads them to a different world. There they meet a strange man(strong silent type). Each episode goes something like this. The kids and woman get off the magic train at a strange place. The bad guy(kid??) sends his minions to where they 3 are. The man in black shows up(approx 7 min left in ep) and does nothing until the kids are in real danger then a light on his gun(attached to arm)turns on and he says ""IT HAS MOVED??"" yells ""SOIL IS MY POWER"" (cue in 2 minute transformation sequence where he puts 3 different colored shells in it and shoots ) a creature pops out of the smoke and defeats the bad guy, then he goes away. The kids and woman then get back on train and the show is over.

 That happens every single episode and there is very little plot development. Come on at least Pokemon has more of a plot.

 This show is clearly aimed for kids 10 and younger which from what I understand is not a big ""Final Fantasy"" demographic.

 Strongly recommend a rental to see if you like it.",1100044800,2,1580,4.21594684385382
7998309,4,B0000C9JEJ,"Final Fantasy Unlimited has great qualities one may look for in an animated series.  First of all, the story is pretty decent and captivating.  It starts off a little slow, but once things pick up, it really is hard to be pulled from.
The story is basically about two children looking for their parents who have mysteriously disappeared in the world of Wonderland.  The two find their way into Wonderland, beginning their adventure of mystery and exotic lands.
There is a combination of animations.  One animation type looks hand drawn and simplistic.  The artwork is not very detailed, but still done nice.  The second type of animation is 3D computer generated.  It sounds like the two and two wouldn't work together, but they blend well nicely.
It's a great series to watch for a Final Fantasy fan because it has qualities from the games.
1.) There are summons such as Phoenix.
2.) Fanfare Victory music is played: just like the games.  (maybe cheesy, but it's there)
3.) There are chocobos.  (chocobo music is even played)
4.) In all Final Fantasy games, there's a man named Cid.  In FF: Unlimited, there is also a man named Cid.
For a start, FF: Unlimited (Phase 1) is well done.  The first episode may be a little slow, but it's great when it picks up.  The lead characters have great personalities.  However, I find the little girl a little obnoxious at times.  The chocobo is cute, as it likes to yank on the little girl's hair and yell out, ""KWEH!"" from time to time.  The enemies in this series are a little corny, but all in all not bad.
I give Phase 1 a 4 stars because of the slow start.  I also didn't like feeling like FF: Unlimited was a rip from Alice in Wonderland.  I wish they would've named the world something a little more creative, but that's just me being picky.",1082764800,,1787,4.534375
7998310,1,B0000C9JEJ,"Three episodes into the DVD I put it away, never to watch again.  There's absolutely no plot development at all; the ""party"" walks around, they're attacked by something or other, and a dude with a gun saves them for no damn reason.  Too much CG (and lame CG at best).  Maybe it'd work out better if the main characters weren't completely helpless, but as it stands it's an awful awful series.",1078185600,3,392,4.492957746478873
7998311,3,B0000C9JEJ,"I'm a big fan of the Final Fantasy games and also of anime, so when I saw this series available on DVD I rushed out and got the first phrase.  It's not a bad series, but it's not for everyone - and it's certainly not something I would recommand to most people.  It has interesting characters, amazing music (some straight from the games), and some nicely done animation...  But one main thing stops me from liking it, is that it seems to be aimed at kids.  The voice acting is afterschool-cartoon-grade, the art direction is cutesy and immature, and the same goes for the plot, which again is cutesy, immature and thin as rice paper.
If you're after a Pokemon or Digimon type cartoon show, then this is for you.  However if you're after mature Miyazaki-grade anime then look elsewhere.",1077235200,4,785,4.578571428571428
7998312,5,B0000C9JEJ,"I am really caught up in this series! GREAT storyline like in all Final Fantasies. I don't like the mixing hand drawn animation with the CGI but it's not that annoying. I really like the hand drawn stuff much more. Seeing the Summons animated this way is a real treat and a lot of the characters resemble those in FF games. There's a character that looks like Squall from FF8, a character who looks like Cloud (Who is actually Cid in this) from FF7, and there's a cute chocobo thrown in. And fans of the games will recognize classic music being used in the background. I love it.",1073865600,,579,4.37037037037037
