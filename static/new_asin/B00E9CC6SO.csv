5897931,4,B00E9CC6SO,I like how this doc goes more into the damage to victims and meditates on the aftermath is for victims of abuse.  It plays half like cold case file with a matter-of-fact presentation style and half like a personal therapy project.,1445558400,,230,4.609756097560975

5897935,5,B00E9CC6SO,"This was a difficult film to watch but I feel it is an important film and one that focuses on the children as they were and the adults that they became. It speaks of the evil that dwells in some human beings but that is far outshined by the courage, honesty, pain, determination and hope that his victims project. I applaud the young man who made this film with all my heart and I am grateful for those who opened up about their pain and the damage done by this horrible excuse for a man. I think it also speaks to the fact that we need harsher laws and more awareness of the effects of the offenders. It is unthinkable for a person so depraved to go unpunished and never to be made accountable. The film is one I am glad I took the time to view--because we need more people like the ones who opened up and dared to speak against this evil.",1436918400,19,840,4.128048780487805
5897936,4,B00E9CC6SO,"This is the true story of a child molester who had the perfect job for himself. He was a pediatrician!

I had a personal interest in the story, as I went to high school with the perpetrator and knew him fairly well. He got away with his molestation for years, because no child was going to rat on his beloved doctor. The film maker had a personal interest in the case, as he had been molested as a child and wanted to call attention to the crime. A difficult film to watch, but it is very well done and makes the case that a person that you like and trust could very well be a child molester.",1400630400,24,592,4.05982905982906

5897940,5,B00E9CC6SO,"Great job by Patrick Brown. I grew up and live in Bartlesville so it really hit close to the heart. I praise all the people who came forward with their stories. If we can change one thing it would be changing the statue of limitations laws for minors against this type of predator. As a father now and someone who experienced the same lewd acts against myself I can say for sure I might be behind bars now if this had happened to my kid.
God bless the victims and good luck to Dr Bill when its time for him to meet his maker.",1485475200,,525,4.0576923076923075

5897942,5,B00E9CC6SO,"We ALL need to fight for the statute of limitations to be eliminated for all sexual crimes. There are thousands of rape cases, with DNA, that have sat untested for over 15 years, because there aren't any funds. Funds for everything else, but that! Most victims don't speak of their abuse, or are too ashamed to tell anyone, until WELL into their adult lives. If there were no statute of limitations, documentary films like this, would be proof beyond any reasonable doubt. Also, if an adult came forward, and could identify any mark, mole, scar, etc., that also could be evidence. Write or call your state Senators, as I have, to drop the statute of limitations on sexual abuse. I can't believe that disgusting pedophile has the nerve to continue living in that town. What gall. TOGETHER we CAN make a difference!",1482796800,4,813,4.732394366197183
5897943,5,B00E9CC6SO,"There are thousands of people like Dr Bill living in the US alone.
Multiply that by the number of victims and you get a picture.
A further documentary could  be made about how the victims go on to
commit further abusive and self abusive behavior, though some of this was covered in this film

While many predators hunt in more high risk populations, and their crimes are thereby more obscured,
Dr Bill operated from a position of power similar to the clergy.  Because the victims were children,
Dr Bill was able to victimize for years without detection.  This made for a large group to interview.

Because these crimes occurred in a more stable and confined population, there was a unique opportunity for
disclosure here which combined with the insight of the film's author to create a surprisingly detailed look
into the life's work of a sexual predator, and the failure of every adult to discover and prosecute.

This is a courageous piece of work, and could have only been better if more of the victims would come
forward for the record.

It is the continued silence and a poor system of laws that allows this behavior to continue unchallenged.

This documentary meets the challenge.
The intention of the film is clear and unpretentious, and very valuable.

I really did not think I would continue to watch this but found every clip of film very relate-able.
I know of many people who unfortunately know someone like Dr Bill and would relate to this film.

The interviews are good and I like the editing and general form of the film.
No glitz, just the facts here.

Unfortunately, you could make thousands of documentaries interviewing the victims of sex crimes,
but we will never get to hear from the predators themselves...They, by nature, hide in the shadows
and thrive on the dark.

This film is a little light in the right direction.",1479340800,6,1841,4.736677115987461

5897949,5,B00E9CC6SO,"This documentary is extremely educational.  There are scenes where a very skilled psychologist gives very clear explanations of how this pediatrician pedophile ruined lives. I want to emphasize SKILLED because most run of the mill psychologists can not do this.  Will not do this...due to total lack of understanding the victim. I was struck by one victims statement that ""they didn't want to upset their parents"".  A whole new doc could be done just about this.  An important film that was very well done.  If you were held hostage by any kind of monster in your life you owe it to yourself to get plenty of validation and this film could help.  I loved how the focus was mostly on the damage that was done and the remorse of the parents who could not see what was plainly right in front of their noses because they were um ......too busy with other more important matters .......  ahem.",1473206400,,888,4.617834394904459

5897964,5,B00E9CC6SO,"Very well done. Sensitive documentary, on a sensitive subject. This stuff happened years ago, but serves as a reminder that pedophiles are very hard to pick out,  if you don't know. If you are a parent, you need to watch this.  Patrick Brown did a fantastic job with this film. My hat is off to you sir. As a survivor myself, I do know a thing or two about this subject. I felt Mr. Brown did a wonderful job putting people at ease and drawing their story out,  in an articulate and touching way. He was able to speak to them as one survivor to another. This was part of his process of healing and we, as an audience, are privileged to be a witness and to be able to learn from this most awful crime. The man that perpetrated this decades long abuse should have been imprisoned for life. You will be shocked at what he got away with. You will be amazed at the strength of his victims. This could be happening in your town right now. You owe it to your children to watch this and learn how to make sure it doesn't happen to your family.

5897975,4,B00E9CC6SO,Had the perpetrator been a different color and social background he would not have been treated with the complacency that seemed to come over these parents who dismissed childhood complaints as nothing and didn't know their children well enough to sense something was wrong...especially the child who cried to get from going to see the doctor! The victims were amazing to get on with their lives despite the double trauma of the doctor and parents who put them in unprotected situations because they didn't want to be thought of as helicopter parents. The filmmaker was particularly brave. The last comment of one parent talking about the doctor going to church with a lady with 2 boys was incredibly remiss to not take that woman aside and warn her. Single women with children are BIG targets. They seemed as if they did something in just writing him a letter! Seriously?,1452902400,,872,4.859060402684563

I was impressed that, although we have changed socially--by being more open in our discussion of child molestation--the complex damage inflicted on the entire family is deep and difficult to heal.  The consequences on the Dr. Bill are so minimal.  It angers me deeply that our legal system is so inadequate in protecting the most vulnerable, our children!",1448150400,2,434,5.171428571428572
