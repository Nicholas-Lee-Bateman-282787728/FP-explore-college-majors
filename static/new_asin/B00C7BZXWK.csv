5693126,1,B00C7BZXWK,"""At Any Price"" is the most abhorrent amoral movie I have ever watched.  My opinion is that the movie completely spits in the face of the Christians everywhere.  The movie pits the beloved farmers of our great country as shysters.  The movie portrays Christians as sinning hypocrites that commit murder and then cover it up.  ""At Any Price"" is an abhorrent piece of trash designed to bring down the United States of America.  It seems to me that this movie was written and directed by enemies of the United States of America.  ""At Any Price"" has no redeeming quality whatsoever!  This movie deserves a rating of negative five stars.",1377216000,5,631,4.73394495412844
5693127,4,B00C7BZXWK,"""At Any Price"" (2013  release; 105 min.) brings the story of Henry (played by Dennis Quaid) and his farm family in Iowa. Henry owns a big farm and sells genetically-modified seeds, and is struggling to keep this 4th generation farm going. His oldest son Grant has left the family for adventures abroad (mountain climbing in Argentina) and his youngest son Dean (played by Zac Efron) is a dirt track racer dreaming to break into the big times (ARCA, then NASCAR). Henry is losing customers to a rival, but is unexpectedly getting some help from Dean's girlfriend Cadence (played by Maika Monroe). Henry also has a girlfriend on the side, Meredith (played by Heather Graham), who in turn has her eyes on Dean. Then one day, Henry gets investigated by Liberty, the company from which Henry gets his seeds, for possibly cleaning/re-using the seeds for more than one crop. To tell you more of this plot-heavy movie would surely ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first, the plot at times seens contrived, almost soap-like, but somehow it all works out well as the movie progresses. Of more interest are the performances. Zac Efron continues to try and evolve away from his early Disney days, building on his most recent role in ""The Paperboy"" (where ho co-starred with Nicole Kidman). I am a huge fan of Heather Graham, but she is under-used, and type-cast, as the sexy siren. Dennis Quaid gets the better of the deal as he gets to show his chops as the tormented and frustrated farmer/dad/lover. But the breakout role is from Maika Monroe, a new-comer for me, as the girlfriend of Dean, I am looking forward to seeing her in future roles! Bottom line: this is an entertaining family farm drama, warts and all. As a complete aside, there was a recent Supreme Court case on this very issue of farmers re-using genetically modified seeds for a second or third crop without paying the seeds manufacturers (the farmer lost the case).

This movie showed up unannounced in the art-house theatre here in Cincinnati on a single screen and when I went to see it this weekend, I got a private showing, literally, as I was the only person in the theatre. I figure this won't play long here, but glad I saw it. If you have a chance to see ""At Any Price"", be it in the theatre or on DVD, go for it!",1369440000,14,2353,4.624401913875598
5693128,4,B00C7BZXWK,"A rebellious, tough teenager played by Efron, would prefer to race cars anytime, rather than being responsible enough to take over the family farming business. However, his father, played by Dennis Quaid, has an entirely different opinion as he worries about the weak economy and changing farming climate. Acting Performance was good, and the story grabs your attention, with a thought-provoking ending. The theme of this movie is based on the economic crisis, and how it affects the American dream. The story also reflects that business comes before pleasure, especially in today's world. The drama becomes intense with an impressive ending, which makes you think about how serious the economic crisis can be in our lives. This movie makes you think about what happened to the land of opportunity, a once promised land, and the cost of the American dream. Engaging, moving, entertaining. Highly recommended!",1366934400,14,908,5.268965517241379

5693151,3,B00C7BZXWK,"The trailer for this film made it look pretty decent.  Unfortunately the film itself cannot live up to the promise.  This beautifully shot film has a solid (though oft-used) premise.  But the dialogue is amateurishly written and as a result you have good actors (Quaid, Dickens, Graham, Ross) spouting ridiculous dialogue thus making their acting seem stiff and wooden.

The film's Director of Photography should easily get hired again after this movie, but the screenwriter should find another calling.

As proof of the latter, the plot takes a ludicrously dark turn near the end and then glosses over it as if it were of no consequence.  Shamefully weak writing.

5693177,2,B00C7BZXWK,"I agree with the majority of reviewers about this movie.  It WAS AWFUL!  The trailers didn't give much sense of what this movie was about.  I got that it was about farming and race car driving, but beyond that I had no idea what the movie wanted to convey.  And after watching it, I still have no idea.  Dennis Quad's character came across greedy and self-serving.  Zac Efron's character was hot headed and nothing was done to make the audience have any sympathy for either character.  Nothing improves your opinion of them given Dean just walks away from racing because he loses his first major race.  Dennis Quad only attempts to make nice with the other characters after he's threatened with legal trouble, that he caused, and the possibility of losing his land.

5693182,2,B00C7BZXWK,I expected more father/son drama - coming of age stuff not a drama about the farm business.  Zac Efron's character gives up his dream rather quickly and soon after indulges in other poor decisions regarding women.  Ends with a serious crime that appears to go unpunished.  Not sure what to make of this other than maybe a lot was lost in editing?  Might like if you're into farming but I think it's an insult to the farm industry as well. Two stars only because the acting was good and had potential.,1392940800,,500,4.461538461538462
5693183,5,B00C7BZXWK,"What a movie. I like Dennis Quaid is why I ordered this movie. He is a great actor and deserves more credit or a better made movie for him. He was in Vegas as a TV show, loved it.",1391817600,,179,3.6153846153846154
5693184,4,B00C7BZXWK,"I think a lot of people had different expectations for this movie than what the director was ultimately trying to deliver.  It's not a fun romp with cute Zac Efron racing cars and clashing with dear old dad Dennis Quaid.  It's a fairly dark look at the decline of the American family farm, the rise of agriculture as a cut-throat business ruled by big corporations and genetically modified seeds, and what this does to a family still trying to make a living in the heartland.  None of the characters are really likeable, outside Maika Monroe as Dean's girlfriend and maybe Kim Dickins as the put-upon wife.  Though (except Heather Graham, who's a non-entity playing exactly the part you expect Heather Graham to be playing), all the performances are very good.  The ending is intentionally open-ended and lacking in resolution and I'm not convinced it overall worked for me, but it at least left me thinking.

This is a small indie movie that I'd recommend it if you're a fan of Ramin Bahrani's other work.  It was never meant to be a huge audience crowd-pleaser like you might expect given the stars top-lining it, but it's a fine little film for what it is.",1390780800,4,1159,4.679802955665025

5693234,2,B00C7BZXWK,"To use a NASCAR metaphor, this movie never gets out of low gear.  Low as in depressed.  The musical score seems to be one long violin note.  It's hard to care about the characters, particularly the brat son.  One reviewer questioned the need for the auto store robbery scene.  I disagree.  It shows, early on, just how much of a self centered brat the younger son is.

I may I'm biased, having grown up trailer-trash like the brat's girlfriend, against farm kids who complain about inhereting multi-million dollar businesses (around $3M in just the land).  I rode to school on the bus, not in a tax-deductible pickup truck filled with tax-free gas.

I have to commend the makeup department.  The Joker-like smile plastered on Dennis Quaid's face for most of the movie was almost life-like.",1383523200,,789,4.777777777777778

Bad script with weak characters. What's with the spineless wife in this film? And the moronic kids shooting the windows out of a store to swipe something?

Finally, pitching someone down a well is a lot less artistic than the Fargo technique of feeding them into a wood chipper.

This is an awful movie whose only purpose seems to be slandering rural people.  The hero of the plot is a sleazy immoral character who cheats everyone, from his business partners and his neighbors to his wife.  Great hero.  Great role model.

If you are an idiot urban dweller who has never lived in rural America, you will probably like this awful movie, especially if you think farmers have sex on desktops and in grain elevators standing up.

* The Sick & Stupid Score ranks movies from zero to ten in each category.  For example, a Sick & Stupid Score of 5/5 indicates the movie is about average Sick and about average Stupid.  A Score of 10/10 indicates the movie is so gross and idiotic no one should watch it; whereas a Score of 0/0 is a perfect movie.",1382313600,2,822,4.620689655172414

5693276,2,B00C7BZXWK,"I had great hope for this movie, Dennis Quaid is likable, can usually rise above mediocre material and be believable as a midwestern grain farmer/seed salesman.  Heather Graham would be pleasant to look at for 105 minutes.  This was filmed in the area I live and in full disclosure, I own one of the vehicles that appears in a supporting role.  Heather Graham may have less than 5 minutes screen time and is of little consequence to the plot, Dennis Quaid was only sporadically convincing and I learned that Zac Efron must be one of the worst big name actors of his generation.  Disney can make young actors/singers and they seem compelling under the Disney umbrella, but it doesn't guarantee they'll be any good as adults.  But on the positive side, Kim Dickens was excellent as the wife and in the future we'll see more of Maika Monroe, who plays the young, discarded girlfriend, owning the screen in all of her scenes. The plot veers into the immoral/unbelievable along the way and by the time you realize how awful most of the main characters are, you no longer care.  I'm giving At Any Price 2 stars instead of 1 because of the good female performances and, after all, my pickup is in it.",1380931200,,1193,4.577464788732394
5693277,5,B00C7BZXWK,Good cast and good story.  Both Efron and Quad delivered a stellar performance.  It was quite different than what you are used for Zac Efron,1380844800,,140,4.56
5693278,3,B00C7BZXWK,"In one of his best performances, Dennis Quaid plays a midsized corporate farmer named Henry Whipple (wasn't he the Charmin salesman?).  While he has his own farm in Iowa he is also a seed salesman for a big company called Liberty (think Monsanto).  To be honest I don't know how all this works but from what I gather, the  way of washing old (natural) seed and replanting has been supplanted by genetically modified seed that must be purchased new each year.  That really is just the backdrop in any case.

Henry and his wife, Irene (Kim Dickens) have two sons.  Grant, the high school star quarterback heads off to a successful career at Iowa State but doesn't return to the farming empire he was expected to inherit.  Instead he goes off to climb mountains.  The younger son, isn't the high school star that his brother was.  He is however an up-and-coming stock car racer and has been highly successful at the local figure 8 track.  This ""hobby"" has never gotten the attention of his parents as his older brother's sports did and it has been a bone of contention.

It seems that the film was going to go in one of two directions.  One was to get more into the intricacies of how and why genetically modified seed is used and sold.  Perhaps an expose on how large corporations are impacting smaller farmers.  The other avenue is to expand the relationship between Henry and his stock-car driving son who like his brother, wants no part of the business.  The story heads in that direction but is constantly sidetracked by heightened melodrama involving secondary characters.

For example, Henry is having an affair from an old high school sweetheart (Heather Graham).  You know, he was the stud QB, she was the head cheerleader (yawn).  When she is eventually spurned, she turns her attention to young son and car racer Dean (Zac Efron).  Then there is the whole wannabe NASCAR thing.  And the contractual subterfuge Henry was trying to pull off.

I do give credit for the secondary relationship between Henry and Dean's high school girlfriend Cadence (Maika Monroe).  Her dad is in prison so the family has kind of taken her under their collective wing.  There are some nice scenes between Cadence and Henry.  Ms. Monroe does a fine job in her limited role.  Overall the film just seems to meander about before its somewhat shocking conclusion.  Still it isn't terrible and may be worth a look for many viewers.",1380758400,,2413,4.712918660287081

Farming, sex, adultery, murder, car racing, mountain climbing, guns, robbery, alcohol, suicide, F-bombs, kidnapping/missing person, death, fist fighting.......

Spoilers: I have been around farmers my whole life and they certainly do not behave they way this movie portrays them. Yes, they do sit in air conditioned, GPS guided equipment. No, they do not commit murder in corn fields and toss the body into their well (water is precious you know). Yes, GMO seeds are highly regulated and watched by seed goons who WILL come after you. No, farmers are not going to have an adulterous affair out in the middle of the day in public. No gun blasted robbery would go unnoticed and never investigated (sort of like the murder above). Sex in a corn silo is unsafe and should probably not be attempted (with protection or otherwise). Yes, seed cleaners have all been put out of business. No, farmers do not drive around in gold Chevy Impalas!

For such a ""star studded"" cast, this movie falls short by miles. It is slow, boring, long, drawn out, and just plain not entertaining. There is no back story to any of it. Why is the oldest son leaving the farm to go climb Mt Everest or whatever mountain it is he climbs? Why does the other son freak out while racing? It's his life dream and he's good at it.

5693340,3,B00C7BZXWK,"Henry Whipple (Dennis Quaid) has it all, a loving family, a successful business, and a mistress (Heather Graham). He is an aggressive seed salesman and farmer. His oldest son would rather travel the world and his younger son Dean (Zac Efron) is cynical and doesn't want to be around his father. He wants to race cars and have a good time with his ""feral"" girlfriend (Maika Monroe).

Henry doesn't always abide by the rules. Dean has anger management issues. Things come to a head as Henry has to choose to make things right or face dire consequences.

The film is an okay drama, that perhaps plays out better in Iowa. The characters nicely evolved in the film, although they didn't grab me. Might make for a drama rental at a low price.

OMG what a waste of time, if I could I would pay you Not to watch it I would. Please do not waste your time.
His character never develops,(it's never explained WHY both sons hate the dad and don't want to be on the  farm)

The story seems to be the ""family farm"" - looking for one of two sons to take it over.
One son is only seen leaving and never returns, the other wants to race cars - the son commits manslaughter & the father
hides the body to protect him - the mother finds out and says, ""...we're a team..."" movie ends with no resolution.

The takes away is:
if you can't get your son to stay and work on the farm help him cover-up a murder
and then he'll feel obligated for the rest of his life to stay. Moral is if you cover up a murder
and get away with it, you be the biggest farmer in the state have a son to inherit your business and live

Dennis Quaid is a portrait of tension and angst, trying to maintain a veneer of ethics while he dabbles in dubious practices under economic pressures. He's easy to dislike, but his character is hard to write off, and scarily easy to identify with. Definitely enough intrigue to keep things rolling, and some beautiful imagery (love the turbines alongside the corn) and powerful, realistic dialogue.

SPOILER ALERT: The film is short on moral value as the father (Dennis Quaid) covers up (literally) the son's murder ostensibly to compensate for his harshness to his (least favorite) son and to transcend his own father's harshness.

Outstanding performances by Dennis Quaid and Maika Monroe as Cadence Farrow, girl friend to Dean Whipple (Zac Efron).

5693442,2,B00C7BZXWK,"Note: possible Spoiler Alert

Yes, this quote actually comes out of the mouth of one of the more irresponsible self-serving egocentric characters created for a film - one Henry Whipple. And that is only for starters. This mess of a film (written by Hallie Newton and adapted for the screen by writer/director Ramin Bahrani) is an American Midwest epic about crime down on the farm, but no one seems to notice that is the topic.  It reminds us of that old Midwest saying `He's so dumb he couldn't pour pee out of a side-laced boot with the directions written on the heel'.

Henry Whipple (Dennis Quaid) inherited a family corn farm and continues the long family tradition of making it a success in Iowa - even to the point of becoming involved in a criminal malfeasance that has to do with seed. He has two sons - All American athlete Grant (Patrick W. Stevens), who has wisely left this station to climb mountains in Argentina, and Dean (Zac Efron), who hates the farm and loves destruction derby car racing and glibly tells his father he will have nothing to do with the `family farm inheritance' - and a wife (Kim Dickens) who is so passive that her only positive gesture, other than serving lemonade to the annual customer appreciation crowd, is to give Dean $15,000 to join the racing industry - a waste because Dean is unprepared to cope with his dream. Henry womanizes with Meredith (Heather Graham)  - so does Dean - but that's OK. Dean robs and murders, but that's OK. And when the Whipple farm faces a possible end, Henry lies his way out of it with some wimpy reparation and more lemonade and dancing at the customer appreciation picnic. Even Dean's abused well-meaning girlfriend (Maika Monroe) is able to just smile and move on. The only character who seems to have some respect is our mountain climbing Grant who has left this weakened family. End.

It might be possible to simple label this flimsy little film as boring, but it is so meaningless and mean-spirited that it likely will cause a mix of anger and disgust in the viewer. Have we really dropped this low in the lack of decency? Grady Harp, August 13",1377820800,4,2123,4.605820105820106
