8656486,1,B00K7A1DMW,"Buyer Beware! This is NOT a movie. It is a collection of still pictures strung together in a PowerPoint-like presentation; and, the audio/narration sounds like the woman on your GPS reading a written transcript (probably done by the DVD producer). It is very unnatural, and lifeless as you would expect from something like a computer generated audio narration track. We turned this off in less than 30 seconds. We are returning our ""DVD"". Also, the ""new"" disk in the jacket was also scratched up in several places when it arrived. Definitely not worth the price they are asking!!! The description should/could have been more precise to give detailed information about what you get if you buy this.

Oh, yeah, should have caught this before... The run time also says 19 minutes. That should tell you something. I'm not discrediting this person's time and experience in Alaska, or saying the pictures are not nice. The product is not as expected or worth it in my opinion, though.",1487721600,,978,4.891566265060241
