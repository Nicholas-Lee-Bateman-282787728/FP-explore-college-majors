7881019,3,6305029423,"The Product Description on this page says this VHS of GIRL FROM TOBACCO ROW was manufactured by the SIMITAR company. It may indeed be a rarity, but this VHS is surely also of very low quality. SIMITAR issued tapes dubbed at SLP speed (the slowest) and audio was often overmodulated.

THE GIRL FROM TOBACCO ROW is one of singing cowboy Tex Ritter's last films. Shot in Tennessee, it's a typically low-budget Ron Ormond work originally targeted for Southern drive-in theater audiences.

Ritter stars as a preacher. Also in the cast is Johnny Russell (Buddy Holly's replacement with the Crickets and the composer of ""Act Naturally""). The delighful soundtrack is filled with vintage mountain and pickin' tunes. Also, keep a look out for that humongous harmonica!

THE STORY:  A man-on-the-run takes refuge with a preacher, hs son and two daughters. As the 50th Annual Tobacco Festival nears, the fugitive (who's being trailed by more than one fellow wanting to see him dead) ingratiates himself with the family. Meanwhile, Nadine (the preacher's daughter) has to fight off the affectionate advances of several local yokels.

Parenthetical number preceding title is a 1 to 10 imdb viewer poll rating.

7881021,1,6305029423,"Why does Amazon keep stocking this company's junk quality, bootleg wares? Everything produced by Jef Films is extremely dubious and almost always horrible quality. They're like these sellers on eBay who claim that the pirated DVD-R's they're selling are in ""the public domain."" Yeah, right! All that means is that the actual rights-owners aren't aware of what these sellers (and, by extension, Jef Films) are doing. If Jef Films is a legit outfit, why don't they have a website? Just try tracking down any information about them online. Total fly-by-night operation, clearly. Boo, Jef Films! Do the right thing and dump them now, Amazon!",1210377600,7,637,5.134615384615385
7881022,4,6305029423,"This video is very entertaining. It's what you expect in a movie (one that entertains and keeps you on the edge of your seat until the credits roll). I wasn't disappointed in the least with this video.
It has comedy, suspense, mystery, action, and most of all, a believable storyline. I won't even go into the plot because it will give the whole story away. And this won't make much sense, but when you get the video, you will understand what I am saying... this movie is what you want it to be. TRUST ME.
It will be the best movie you haven't seen. A major newspaper reviewer said it was the greatest movie hardly anyone has seen, and the paper is starting to launch a campaign to get it remade in 2002.",976492800,6,704,4.3007518796992485
