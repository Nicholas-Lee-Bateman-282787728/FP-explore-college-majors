8167875,4,B000MCH1MG,"Arjun Verma (Fardeen Khan) is a con man and a darn good one. For years and years he and his best friend Rohit have been living by their wits, running small-time scam after scam. And they've always gotten away with 'em. But, unbeknownst to Arjun and Rohit, the victim of their latest trick turns out to be an underling of the ruthless, powerful crime boss Sikander, who then retaliates very harshly. Now Sikander insists that the money lost to him from the con job be recouped, and plus interest. Arjun has 10 days to do this. As an added incentive, Sikander assigns his stubble-faced gunman Kaif to Arjun to keep him honest.

The 2005 film EK KHILADI EK HASEENA (""One Player One Beauty"") is one of the slickest looking products I've seen coming out of Bollywood, and there's a decidedly modern, contemporary feel to the story. I'm sure folks were thrown off a bit when this one released in India. Seemingly more suited to a Western mindset, EK KHILADI EK HASEENA foregoes most of the traditional (and, frankly, sometimes exasperating) Bollywood elements. This one actually challenges the viewer to pay attention and keep up with the intricate on-screen shenanigans.

Just so you'd get a sense of how convoluted this caper film is, the above plot description covers only the first half of the picture. Yup, EK KHILADI EK HASEENA is 2 and a half hours long, but it moves fast, thanks in part to all the intricate shifts and twists. It helps too that the cons which Arjun undertakes are actually complex and fascinating stuff (excepting the initial con, which takes place at a bank and is just plain lame). The way the Lottery ticket con and the engagement ring con smoothly went down, they actually followed a natural and logical path and one can see how the marks give up their hard-earned rupees. Arjun cooly claims that he uses his insights into human nature to pull off his shady enterprises. And, indeed, much of his success relies on his familiarity with the psychology of his targets.

There's romance, of course (there's always romance in Bollywood), but the powers-that-be actually allow the lovebirds to more physically demonstrate their affections. What I mean is that there's actually kissing and even a sex scene in here, and a pretty damn steamy sex scene at that, even if it's still rated PG stuff. That Koena Mitra, she's a bonafide hottie.

Some folks to look out for: The lead actor is Fardeen Khan, and he makes his presence felt as the clever Arjun, who gets a shot at his biggest score yet. Sultry Koena Mitra plays the beautiful psychiatrist Natasha Kapoor who becomes fascinated with Arjun and his unconventional lifestyle. Feroz Khan, who is Fardeen's dad in real life, has a showcase role in the second half of the film, playing a lucrative but highly dangerous mark (whether he pulls off the role is another thing altogether). My favorite character here turns out to be the gunsel Kaif, acted out with slovenly charm by Kay Kay Menon.

A bit now on the music (there's always music in Bollywood). The six musical numbers are eye- and ear-catching. But there are three I really like. The sleek first number (don't know the song title), staged during the opening credits, sets the tone, while the provocative ""Jal Jal Ke Dhuan"" is sure to fog up your senses. Meanwhile, ""Ishq Hai Jhoota"" is a high energy reggae-tinged jam I was bobbin' my head to.

But let's not get it twisted. EK KHILADI EK HASEENA isn't as slick or clever or as well-realized as, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Score/dp/B00003CY5J/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Score</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sting/dp/0783225873/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sting</a>, or both versions of THE THOMAS CROWN AFFAIR. Certainly it's not as entertaining as the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ocean-s-Eleven-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000062XHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ocean's Eleven (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;remake or even&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Italian-Job-Special-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B0000B1OFL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Italian Job (Special Collector's Edition)</a>&nbsp;remake. In fact, much of this movie's first half is, well, let's call it ""inspired"" by David Mamet's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/House-of-Games/dp/B00004ZBVL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">House of Games</a>. The second half then patterns itself after the 2003 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Confidence/dp/B0000AGQ2E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Confidence</a>. Oh, Bollywood.

In spite of this, the film is watchable fare, due to the actors' credible performances (although Feroz Khan may have strayed too deeply into the area of caricature). True, several scenes in the film's second half wallowed a while in inertia, dragging the pace a bit. But they weren't enough to turn me off. I don't know what the budget was, but it was sizable enough to produce glossy production values. There's a sheen and an energy to EK KHILADI EK HASEENA, which ends up being a decent flick about unforgotten revenge, dangerous romance, uncertain friendships, treachery at every turn, and the heist. Three and a half stars from me.",1194825600,6,5368,5.77020202020202
