This play is outstanding and funny it has some wonderful singers.

Tyler keeps doing his thing time and time again.

Keep making us laugh.

If you don't have this play go get it now it is worth every penny and more.

8011611,4,B0001FBTHW,"So far I've seen 3 of his plays including this one.  The things I don't like about them are that they are over the top, full of stereo types about Black people and kind of long.  What I do like about them are that the actors are tremendous singers and there is always a very good message to these stories.  I've seen a lot of bootleg Tyler Perry DVD's out there ... since this is a Black man trying to build an empire, please support him by buying his plays from his website and not from black market resources.",1110931200,5,511,4.141414141414141
8011612,5,B0001FBTHW,"Madea's Family Reunion is, without a doubt, the funniest and most wonderful of Tyler Perry's works.  I have all of the DVD's, but this is the one I just can't get enough of - even after having watched it for two years!  The entire cast is truly excellent, and it becomes apparent just WHY at the end when they are all introduced.  Most of the key players are high-powered professionals in the entertainment field.  That's what I like about Tyler Perry - his ability to write, direct, and star in a play and pick fantastic talent to complement the  work.  In particular, the performances of David Mann and Tamela, D'Atra Hicks, and Gary Jenkins really soar. What voices! What songs!  But the real delight is Madea herself. Tyler Perry is a true comic genius.  Madea's lines are delivered with such sincerity and wit that you almost forget Madea is really Perry.  The verbal battles between Madea and Brown will have you rolling on the floor, holding your sides from laughter.  Be Prepared to laugh - A LOT ! ! ! !",1105315200,7,1012,4.541436464088398
