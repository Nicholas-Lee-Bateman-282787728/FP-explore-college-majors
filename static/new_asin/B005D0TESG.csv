4655423,4,B005D0TESG,"An absolute must for Temptation fans. Sure its dated, hell they have been around for Fifty years, but they are the Temptations. Viewing this DVD, one comes to the realization about how young they were yet they were as polished and professional as any group you've ever seen. All of these men were originally from the deep south and migrated to Motown where they became the R & B standard for vocal groups. Their voices and harmonies are simply exquisite, their legendary trademark steps speak for themselves. They were having a ball, they were good and they knew it. I see where Amazon is advertising this set as 21 of their performances....not really, more like twelve several are the same performance but medleys of songs.  This DVD set is great as an historical record of time past and find the Tempts in rare form.

This would have been an exemplary set if we had film of them rehearsing for the show, sound checks and interviews during the same time frame but I guess we'll have to settle for this truncated version of the many events. Although there were some personally disturbing moments like when Ed Sullivan continually referred to them as boys and Smokey Robinson who doesn't appear in the videos but sings a voice over from one of his performances on Ed Sullivan...tacky. I remember these performances well and they reflect a lot of what the world was like then and now. One of the most telling things about this video is that sharp eyed Temptation fans can see the deterioration of Temptation Paul Williams. They'll also get to see the Temptations transition from David Ruffin to Dennis Edwards without missing a beat. Often imitated but never duplicated Motown's Mighty Men The ""Temptin Temptations"".",1316563200,25,1714,4.806779661016949
4655424,5,B005D0TESG,"There are no liner notes so here are the original air dates for each of the 12 full length performances included on this excellent DVD.  All of the performances are in chronological order (except for the two Bonus performances) with no edits or narration.  Most include Ed's original intro as well as his shaking hands with the group afterwards.

1. June 28, 1967: Medley: Girl (Why You Wanna Make Me Blue)/All I Need/My Girl/ (I Know) I'm Losing You.  First appearance of the group on the Sullivan show.  Previously only an edit was available on DVD/VHS which cut the first half of the medley out.
2. November 19, 1967: Don't Look Back.  With Paul Williams singing lead.
3. November 19, 1967: Medley: Get Ready/Stop! In The Name Of Love/My Girl/Baby Love/ (I Know) I'm Losing You.  The Supremes and Tempts take turns singing each others' hits with the Supremes starting off.  My Girl becomes My Guy (but not the Mary Wells hit) when the Supremes sing it.  Previously an edit of just the final song was available on DVD/VHS.
4. February 2, 1969: Runaway Child, Running Wild.  Dennis Edwards replaces David Ruffin.  Each of the five members gets to sing lead.
5. September 28, 1969: I Can't Get Next To You.
6. April 5, 1970: You've Made Me So Very Happy.  The group turns this song into a dance number with five female dancers paired up with each member.
7. April 5, 1970: Psychedelic Shack.
8. January 31, 1971: Get Ready.  From their final appearance on the Sullivan show.
9. January 31, 1971: Medley: Ain't No Mountain/I'll Be There/My Sweet Lord.  Medley of recent chart hits by other artists. First time ever on DVD.
10. January 31, 1971: Just My Imagination (Running Away With Me).  Eddie's swan song.
Bonus:
11. November 19, 1967: Hello Young Lovers. First time ever on DVD.
12. September 28, 1969: Autumn Leaves. First time ever on DVD.

Eight of these performances are also included in the companion disc Motown Gold on the Ed Sullivan Show.  They did not include a couple of other performances that have appeared previously on one of the volumes of Ed Sullivan's Rock 'N' Roll Classics.  These are I'm Gonna Make You Love Me and September In The Rain.  Still most of the songs the group performed in their six appearances are included.  Improved sound and picture.  Highly recommended.",1316304000,55,2295,4.71608040201005
4655425,5,B005D0TESG,"The Temptations were one of a kind. I've been waiting for this DVD for years.  The Temptations, along with other Motown artists, contributed to the world of music immensely!
To this day, they continue to captivate millions of people around the world with their voices, unique attire and their dance choreographies.  ""Just My Imagination"" is an all-time classic and their medley with the Supremes was unforgettable! Now that is worth the cost of the DVD alone!",1315872000,14,459,5.026315789473684

4655429,5,B005D0TESG,Watching these DVD's brought back lots of memories of my teenage years.  The temptations along with other groups were almost made famous through the Ed Sullivan Show.  I spent countless Sunday nights watching Ed Sullivan.,1422921600,,221,5.285714285714286

4655451,5,B005D0TESG,"LOVE, LOVE,LOVE IT!  The price is right for the quality and entertainment I received on this dvd. It was well put together for a Temptation lover such as myself. I see why my sisters use to fight over the tv  back in the day to watch the
Ed Sullivan show vs cartoons.  Need I say more? (: Thank you for the sweet memories.",1382745600,2,322,4.079365079365079
4655452,4,B005D0TESG,"I liked it because I like the Temptations and it was nice to see the Original group performing; Some of it was a bit too ""outdated"" but that is not anyone's fault...",1375056000,,165,4.1875
4655453,4,B005D0TESG,Over all this was a good collection. I thought there were more appearances than this collection offered. However it was a good collection. One of the best performances involves the temptations and supremes together. This is worth the time and money,1366502400,,248,5.073170731707317
4655454,5,B005D0TESG,I  was overjoyed to get my copy of this excellent cd featuring The Mighty Temptations. This is truly a collector's item!,1363564800,,120,4.714285714285714
4655455,5,B005D0TESG,Rare footage especially the one where the Primes (Supremes) are singing with the Temps.  Interesting watching Ed's change towards the Temps as they gained popularity.  By the time the 70's rolled along he was like one of their long lost brothers. :),1362268800,,249,4.904761904761905
4655456,3,B005D0TESG,"This collection was okay, but The Temptations have another DVD collection of their performances that I think is much better. It's called Get Ready: Definitive Performances 1965-1972 [DVD] and it pretty much includes all the performances on this DVD, plus more.",1358553600,,260,5.365853658536586

4655458,3,B005D0TESG,"The best thing about this video, it has the original artist that first started the Temptations group. It has a good collection of the greatest songs sung by the group. This is a must to have if you are a Temptations fan.",1349308800,,220,4.261904761904762
4655459,5,B005D0TESG,"I'm a big Temptation fan so this was a no brainer.  I really enjoy this one, picture quality was good, the sound quality wasn't bad, had to pump up the surround sound to get the full effect.  Enjoyed all the songs and the medleys with the Supremes.  Otis even leads a song!!!  Costumes, harmonies, and choreography was great.  This one's a must for any Temptation collector.",1347840000,,374,4.606060606060606
4655460,5,B005D0TESG,"I thought the quality of the disk was great very clear very colorful and the black and white video of the supremes was excellent.  I know one person said the quality was bad but not the one I received.  I luv the Jackson 5 video because I wanted the memories because I saw them all when they first aired, this is where I fell in love with the Jackson 5 and Michael, just a wonderful piece of history I wanted for my collection a true fans gem to have just great, great, great.",1345420800,,476,4.10752688172043
4655461,5,B005D0TESG,Love Motown at the best of times but this is great and the quality is good.  Always a little hesitant with buying overseas dvd but the quality is very good.,1334707200,,156,4.2
4655462,5,B005D0TESG,"I grew up listening to the Temptations and imitating every voice until I found my own.  I didn't always get to see them on TV, though.  This video gives me and anyone a chance to see this iconic group in the days when they were pioneering music that still  moves us today!",1333756800,,272,4.1923076923076925
4655463,5,B005D0TESG,"Purchasing the Best of the Temptations on the Ed Sullivan Show was a great experience. Seeing these performances, some of which for the first time, in such fantastic sound and video quality was more than a joy. Even though I love The Temptations, I have to say that one of the main reasons I bought the DVD was for the appearance of the duet with Diana Ross and The Supremes. I believe this was the first time that performance was released on DVD unedited, so I had to have it!",1327449600,,477,4.311111111111111
4655464,5,B005D0TESG,"If you're a huge Temptations fan, you can't lose with this one.  My husband asked for this and has watched it almost daily since he got it.  There's nothing like the visual you get from seeing them perform.  Video does a great job of chronologing their growth as a group.  While it doesn't show all their songs, it shows quite a few of their more famous songs.",1326931200,,360,4.3283582089552235
4655465,5,B005D0TESG,"If you like David Ruffin, this is a good one. Having watched Ed Sullivan as a child for years waiting primarily for the Temptations to appear, this was very enjoyable. I'd heard of, but never saw them with the Supremes with David as lead, singing together. I'd also never saw them sing Hello Young Lovers on TV. Now, find the Sonny and Cher, Hollywood Palace,Smothers Brothers, and Mike Douglas show appearances and I'll be sated. Oh, and January 18 is David's birthday. Excellent!",1326758400,,481,4.807228915662651
4655466,5,B005D0TESG,"I've never seen a Temptations video that has disappointed, and this one is surely no exception.  Buyers remember; these are original recordings (meaning no touchups) so don't be disappointed to see less than 3D quality.  This DVD contains most of my favorites.  I play it all the time.",1326672000,,285,4.895833333333333
4655477,5,B005D0TESG,"If you saw or never saw the original ""Temptations"" live then this is a must. Even with the lip synched singing, the moves that they had will make the hair in the back of your neck stand up. There is also a few songs that Motown were able to drop the instruments out of the mix and you can hear David Ruffin, Eddie Kendricks, Paul Wiliams, Melvin Flanklin and Otis Williams sing accapella, that's worth the price in itself. Even when David Ruffin left the band and was replaced with Dennis Edwards you have a few songs here with Dennis Edwards. It was what I called Temps phase 2, that started with Cloud 9.
These men lived hard and Otis Williams is the last original man standing and is still touring with a bunch of guys that call themselves ""The Temptations"" but it's a sin as the original 3 lead singers have passed and a bass singer with a smile like like Melvin will never ever be replaced.
It is worth 10 times what I paid for it as there is not much live Temptations on DVD out there.
Buy and enjoy
The Temps""",1325289600,,1016,4.242268041237113
4655478,5,B005D0TESG,"I saw these performances back when they first aired.
I must say this was well worth the wait. The only problem
with this disc is you need more space for more performances.
I hope there is a part 2.",1322611200,,197,4.076923076923077
4655479,5,B005D0TESG,"Love, love, loving this!  It's so much fun to re-live those special moments of the past.  I am a true Motown baby and I'm rocking these oldies.  Thanks so much for some clean fun.",1322179200,,179,4.205882352941177

4655481,5,B005D0TESG,"The Tempts were one of the greatest groups of all time.  Wonderful quality of the DVD.  I absolutely love this! Great performances, their music and vocals are amazing.  Such precision.  Love it!",1321660800,,194,4.96875
4655482,5,B005D0TESG,"Ed Sullivan was always noted for putting on great acts. The Temptations were one of the groups that were a main stay on his show. This DVD bring back fond memories of a time when artist put their heart and soul into their songs. The Temptations were always dressed to impress and their songs had real meaning. One thing I admired about them, anyone of the members could have been a lead singer. Thats how talented they are. For those who are thinking about getting this dvd, GET IT !! I'm giving it a THUMBS UP and adding another great classic to my growing collections. ""Temptations forever""",1320451200,8,592,4.542056074766355
4655483,5,B005D0TESG,"The greatest vocal group of all-time! Whatever ""it"" is they have it. These guys are the definition of cool. I am a huge fan of David Ruffin, so I like all of his performances. The only performance on here I had only seen once or twice was ""Hello Young Lovers"". To me it is like a glimpse of how the group would have been if David would have remained with the group through the psychedelic era. They had a perfect harmony.",1318896000,2,421,4.209876543209877
4655484,5,B005D0TESG,"Wow, I've watched this, yet I was more amazed with the performance of ""You Make Me So Very Happy""! I laughed at the poor 'lip sync' of Paul & Otis, but I still loved it! This is in my collection for sure and if you're a big fan, you will purchase it!",1318809600,3,250,3.826923076923077
4655485,5,B005D0TESG,A really nice collection of performances by The Temptations when they truly were at their peak with Ruffin and Kendricks.  Highlight of the collection would have to be the performance alongside the Supremes in which each group plays the other's hits.  A special DVD that brings back a lot of memories.  Really glad I got it.,1317340800,2,324,4.75
4655486,5,B005D0TESG,"At last!  We get a great set of The Temptations classic performances.
