8461412,4,B0058E675U,"I thought I was going crazy but ""Water Tower"" episode is not on the actual DVD. They include the pilot though among the best of ""That 70's Show"" episodes. Actually, ""Water Tower,"" is perhaps my favorite episode of all so I'm a bit disappointed but I bought two of the same DVD anyway so I'm really a fan of the show.

Even without ""Water Tower,"" the ten episodes are from the first four of the eight seasons. They should have included the mooning episode from the first season which was pure genius. The other episodes here are ""Keg"" with ""Brady Bunch"" actress Eve Plumb playing Jackie's realtor mother; ""Prom Night"" features Gloria Gaynor as the music teacher; ""The First Time"" is about Eric and Donna's first time during her parents' renewal ceremony; ""Radio Daze"" includes ""WKRP in Cincinatti"" Howard Hesseman and ""Moonlighting's"" Curtis Armstrong; ""Canadian Road Trip"" has the gang trying to buy beer across the border; and ""It's a Wonderful Life"" recalls what would have happened if Eric and Donna never kissed that fateful night with Wayne Knight as Eric's guardian angel.",1475107200,,1078,4.890710382513661

8461414,3,B0058E675U,"Good dvd, but I thought it was a dvd of their 'special musical shows'. My mistake,  I saw it in a catalog once, will keep on looking for it.",1462924800,,140,3.8275862068965516

8461416,4,B0058E675U,"Some of the shows best episodes on one disc. We enjoy these 10 episodes, but it does leave you wanting more. Not the best show though if there are little kids around. So perfect for after they are in bed and you need some time for yourself and can laugh.",1411689600,,254,4.1

8461420,4,B0058E675U,"this dvd has great episodes from seasons 1-4. it's fun to watch all these episodes without commercial interruption.  the series has so many great moments, it's hard to say which ones should be collected in a collection of ""hits"".  not a weak one here.",1324771200,2,251,4.681818181818182
8461421,5,B0058E675U,"We've watched these episodes dozens of times on TV, but they're still funny. Plus the DVD is good for when there is nothing worth watching on our 200 plus cable channels, which happens quite often.",1324425600,3,197,4.6571428571428575
