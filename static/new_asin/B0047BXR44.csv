4284606,5,B0047BXR44,"Can you say FINALLY?  The network have released on dvd one of the best shows that television had to offer.  I began watching the show very late in the game, but luckily they ran it late every week night for from the beginning where I was able to catch it from act one scene one.  When I watched all 5 seasons and the network began to run it again, they stopped showing it in between seasons where I started taping the show for my collection.  The chemistry between Michael and Nikita were so intense you felt like you were drugged into seeing what was going to happen next. Every single episode was great, Season Five didn't end the way it should have, but having being rushed to complete it, is probably the reason.  BUT, if you want to watch a show that has action, emotion, very little comedy and just a great overall 96 hours of stay on your couch till it is all done show, this is the one to watch...Believe, me, you will fall in love with every character at Section one whether you want to or not...You will see the bad and good side of each of them and that makes you realize they are human after all...",1050019200,21,1110,4.241706161137441
4284607,5,B0047BXR44,"For all of us loyal fans, this DVD has been long awaited!
If you have NOT caught La Femme Nikita before, you're missing out on something intense.  Are you looking for a multilayered show that will leave you on the edge of your seat wanting more?  This one will hook you and take you for a ride...
Complex characters, ongoing mystery, psychological games, international action, and constant plot twists will leave you wondering who the good guys are.
Michael and Nikita have perfect chemistry!  Though love is ""off-limits"" they manage to keep their interactions tauntingly sensuous.
(This show is not for the passionless, nor the seeker of humor.)  Despite the emotional intensity, there are moments of light-heartedness, and plenty of entertainment for the ""action-junkie.""
This show appeals most to the ""deep tortured soul,"" and the ""covert action"" fan.
Music lovers--The music in the episodes of La Femme Nikita is amazing as well!",1049760000,,933,5.118421052631579
4284608,4,B0047BXR44,"OK .. Still not sure how good a transfer to disc this will be but La Femme Nikita is a great series that was very losely based on Luc Bessons film of the same name (Remade as The Assassin in the USA with Bridget Fonda - far inferior to the original).
The series takes a new slant on the film and ran for 4 full series and a 5th mini series. The series is of mixed writing quality but generally good fun - although the mixed writers can cause some lack of continuity ..
The series was very unfairly treated in its 5th series - which seemed to have been purely comisioned to kill it off. However still well worth collecting the whole lot.",1049587200,3,636,4.137096774193548
4284609,5,B0047BXR44,"Each show begins with stunning Nikita's (Peta Wilson) raspy, mild Aussie accent: ""I was falsely accused of a hideous crime and sentenced to life in prison. One night, I was taken from my cell to a place called, Section One, the most covert anti-terrorist organization on the planet. Their ends are just but their means are ruthless and if I don't play by their rules, I DIE.""
This 1st season is addicting, unstoppably intense, bullets fly, plots twist in a ways that leave you giddy, jaws dropped, & completely in LOVE with the ultra perfect cast and sincerely unpredictable and intense storylines. It's very realistic, intelligent, moving, tragic, tearjerking, heroic, and unmistakably unique. (Four more seasons bravely followed!) It's a smoldering show with it's own personality- there's very little comedy but rightfully so, in my opinion. It's not like Buffy or Alias or anything else.
Supermodel-like blond haired and blue eyed, Nikita, is a street kid in her 20's tossed out by her mom and recruited into The Section b/c ""a woman with her looks who can kill in cold blood"" is a quite an asset. The problem is- the Section is a place where the good guys are just as carnal or far worse than than the terrorists they fight. The only thing that keeps operatives alive is their willingness is to kill, obey, and abandon emotion. Most live in constant ""fear"" of being canceled.
Nikita, however, is truly a diamond in the rough. Her warmth, innocence & beauty are just so obvious & raw; her noble sense of justice is nearly unbreakable so you fall in love with her immediately. From the very 1st ep, she begins illuminating the dark and monstrous Section where compassion and sentimentality are considered liabilites that will get you tortured and killed by the tough, mature, raven-haired Madeline (Alberta Watson)& her goons or her partner - the cunning godlike man in charge- Operations. Upon their first encounter, Madeline forces Nikita to look in the mirror and explains, ""See your beauty? You can learn to shoot. You can learn to fight. But there is no weapon more powerful than your feminity."" Nikita is naturally defiant from the beginning so you're constantly cheering her on at the edge of your seat.
A soft spoken but gorgeous high leveled operative, Michael, (Roy Dupuis) who outwardly lacks emotion but possesses the most fantastically expressive eyes I've ever seen, is ordered to mentor/train Nikita but the two form a connection that both melts and breaks your heart many times over and leaves you guessing and craving more. Of the 21 eps of this season, my top 5 favorite were:
""NIKITA"" - pilot. Nikita enters Section after the world thinks she's dead- suicide in prison. She must comply or be canceled.
""VOICES"" - Nikita beats a scumbag who tries to abduct her. She later finds out he's wanted by police for a string of heinous crimes & the detective on the case is in relenteless pursuit of finding ""that woman"" to testify. But knowing the truth about her would mean his cancellation (death).
""WAR"" - The Directory is stolen by powerful terrorists, Red Cell, & so operatives are being identified and targeted forcing Section to relocate. Michael & Nikita are sent in to get a counterpart but are captured & brutually tortured for info. This one is a emotional rollercoaster.
""BRAINWASH"" - Nikita tests a device that stimulates tramatic memories and is thought to be used for brainwashing. She becomes curiously endangered physically and emotionally.
""Mercy"" - Nikita refuses to carry out an order that goes against her nature; after a chit-chat with Madeline, Nikita seriously contemplates the worth of her life. ""A fake obituary claimed I died in prison. In the end, that statement is true,"" she writes. Michael recieves knowledge of her fate and is sworn to secrecy and ordered to do the unthinkable.",1049500800,8,3823,4.910355486862442
4284610,5,B0047BXR44,Hello if you are looking for a show that will be around for many years then this is it. I watched this show from day one and once you watch the first show you have to keep seeing the next one and so on. But lucky you there is no commercials so get this DVD!!!

4284611,5,B0047BXR44,"After years of waiting they're finally releasing this great show on DVD. It's one of the main reasons I have Digital Cable--to watch this show on Oxygen network. I became a fan late in the game so I always had questions about so many things. I just hope they won't take too long to get the remaining seasons out, even the not-so-great final episodes.
Apparently I'm one of the few people who enjoy this show AND ""Alias""--another great DVD set coming out in September.",1049414400,2,467,4.571428571428571

4284620,5,B0047BXR44,"Now on its way to being twenty years old, this series boasts the best of old-time thriller series values: tense, twisty plotlines, engaging characterizations, international intrigue, pyrotechnic deployment of weaponry, and so on. Oh, and I should have added an elongated sexual longing between the lead female and male characters, stifled (at least temporarily) by circumstance. Add to that one of the most alluring, magnetic personae the camera has ever had the opportunity to fall in love with: Australian (I think) Peta Wilson, as the titular Nikita, long-haired, long-legged, and large-eyed. Which now compels me to compliment the wardrobe department: even within the space of a single episode, Wilson goes through a fascinating and alluring array of costumes, showcased effectively by the show's lighting and production design. I hadn't seen this series since its original run, and am now glad I revived it.",1478217600,3,912,5.384615384615385

4284633,5,B0047BXR44,"I love this show. It is a little citchy but it is an overall good show. I've watched each season many times and it is always entertaining. Each character has his or her own charms that are easy to love or hate (based on intention). There is a good amount of drama and action in each episode and although the series is generally episodic, there are several long-term relationships that change throughout and learned personal stories so its a good idea to watch in sequence (so you don't miss anything).
I just wish they would remaster it onto bluray or 4K so it would be a clearer picture.",1468972800,2,588,4.453703703703703

I like the characters and concepts, person falsely accused of murder granted a release if they join a covert team and are forced to do things they don't necessarily agree with, while trying to figure out how to get out of that situation.

Peta Wilson (Extrodinary Gentelmen), Alberta Watson (she also appears in the Maggie Q Nikita), Don Francs (remember him from that 1965 show ""Jericho"" from UNCLE producer Norman Felton?  I did!) Eugene Robert Glazer as Control the man you love to hate.  The opening theme song (Mark Snow) and titles were outstanding for the era (1990s).  I love to pull these out and look at them.  Square screen and 480p resolution but the production quality is something you rarely find on TV.  Joel Surnow and Maurice Hurley wrote scipts for this show.

But as watched more of the first season the cast and story line got much better.  Still could have made Nikita's adapting to life as an assassin more believable if shown making the adjustment as more of a build up in this the first season.

4284693,5,B0047BXR44,This is one excellent show. I just recently came on board with the show but I am already  a big fan. The show is from the late 90s and though aged the stories are not dated. Good combination of solid action and character developement. The cast and writers do an excellent job of entertaining the viewer and did a solid job on season one. If you have not seen this show but enjoy spy thrillers definitely give this show a look.,1423785600,,426,4.2592592592592595

Operations and Madeline are dependent on each other and it shows in every episode. They seem to show no interest in human life.

Madeline is obsessive-compulsive and a sadomasocist. Operations at times shows a borderline personality, The other characters show how people feel closed and depressed, unless they improve according to how operations view them. Nikita doesn't follow the rules of section 1. She shows an autonomous view of life which helps her survive. My five star rating is for acting by all characters.",1400198400,,693,5.178571428571429

Finally we began to feel weighted down near the very last of it all.  The last few episodes were a big disappointment, because of the script writers.  The first 2/3 or more kept us well occupied during the winter months a few years back. It has held its monetary value over a long period of time.

(Maggie Q is pretty decent for the more recent version, but Peta is my fav). When watching the newer version, I thought some characters were familiar. Low & behold Madeline plays the senator (Sean's mom in the newer version) and Ari played Roger in an early episode with Peta. Just a great show!",1373932800,,411,4.282051282051282

The casting was uneven, as well (Glazer shouldn't even be in a school play, let alone a network show); Carlo Rota changed parts more often than old Jaguar.

Superbly written, outstandingly cast, Peta Wilson, and Roy Dupuis literally set the screen on fire. The rest of the cast were also absolutely excellent.

Now that I am older, wiser and married I half expected to be viewing the show with more cynical eyes.  But no, again I found myself totally enthralled by the chemistry between Roy Dupuis and Peta Wilson.  At times the show does look a little dated but overall it stands up fairly well.  My husband attempted to watch it with me but he gave up, commenting that in the 90s, tv shows were short on action.  It's true that there may only be two or three action sequences per show which was fairly normal in those days, but that doesn't bother me as I'm not an action junkie.

4284742,1,B0047BXR44,"Okay.  I must admit I only watched this series because I had watched the first season of the current Nikita starring Maggie Q.  I also was ordering something on Amazon and added this DVD to get to $25 and free shipping.  The series--or the first few episodes--were watchable but that's about it.  The writing and story lines were less than compelling and the main character so obviously miscast as to be laughable.  Other than the fact that she is blond and thin what exactly is the attraction of the actress?  Many times she simply stares into space as if trying to either remember her lines or remember how she should react--or act--in a given situation.  Also, is she supposed to be Aussie or American?  Half the time her accent slips up and she sounds like the Australian that she is.  Surely there are hundreds of blond, blue-eyed, anorexic looking American actresses with little acting talent who could have had this part.

I tried to give the show the benefit of the doubt and vowed to watch the entire first season.  Unfortunately I could not get pass the third episode.  Save the time and watch the current series with Maggie Q.  At least she has more acting ability to go with her visual appeal--which is also considerably more than Peta Wilson's.",1349136000,3,1257,4.659090909090909

LOVED  the  original  version  to  the  point  the  family  stopped  watching  cable  for  a  week  and  just  tuned  into  Nikita.  I  think  the  greatest  attraction  is  the  use  of  psychology  to  understand  and  predict  people's  motives.  Understanding  and  controlling  your  emotions  - instead of  the  other  way  around -  is  one  of  the  greatest  asset  you  can  have  in  business  and  politics  and  this  series  really  can  be  used  as  an  excellent  training  tool.  However,  for  those  viewers  just  wanting  to  escape  in  action  and  glamour  -  this  series  has  that  in  abundance  as  well.  The  scenes  are  smooth  and  classy.

4284746,5,B0047BXR44,"The first season of La Femme Nikita stands up after 14 years. I adore the spy genre. Books, T.V. shows, films, spy stories are oozing with conflict and dramatic possibility. I adored this show when it originally aired, but after all this time I wasn't really expecting much more from it than a rush of 90's nostalgia. I remember being a little bit embarrassed of liking the show when it aired. There is always a cheesy aspect to spy shows that is unavoidable. This is not a gritty, dark, ""real life"" kind of show that is generally favored today. You know your watching a fictional show that is happening in a fantastic and over-the-top world of make-believe. It's an escapist show, not a realistic one. If you like it more 'realistic' then this isn't the spy show for you.

I was astonished at how much I genuinely enjoyed re-watching this show. There are a few issues which date the show and a few episodes that completely fall flat, but by and large Season one was a success.

It still looks stylish. A lot of the 'hi-tech' items still look believable (like the holographic tv used at the briefings). Naturally there are some things which date it like giant cell phones and old cars. The plot, writing, and direction of the show is super solid.

This show was inspired by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/La-Femme-Nikita-Blu-ray/dp/B001GF8WP8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">La Femme Nikita [Blu-ray</a>]. The T.V. show takes a different tact where Nikita is innocent of her initial crime that gets her imprisoned and conscripted as a spy. There is a plot and writing weakness in the choice to make her a goody-two-shoes that was pure and innocent. But it was 90's television and complicated lead characters did not exist in television. Yet this choice also gives the character of Nikita a chance to darken and develop wisdom when confronted with the morally ambiguous governmental agency she works for. Nikita constantly finds herself knee deep in the murky waters of what she had thought was black and white moral territory. She is repeatedly outwitted and outplayed by all her contemporaries in Section-one. Nikita is out of her depth, facing a constant onslaught of adrenaline packed adventures that take a heavy moral toll on her psychological well-being and you get to go along for the ride.

With advancing age and the advent of superior technology, the quality of the discs is low. If your running 1080p and a blu-ray you're going to notice a substantial amount of grain and fuzziness on this set. I reduced to 480p and still found them very grainy. I ended up watching most of these on my laptop which is not so finicky with DVDS.

The concept for the show is the only good thing about it. The acting is terrible.  I believe the sets are supposed to look futuristic, but they actually look silly.  The director loves to use a great deal of close-up shots that really show the actors' lack of emotional range.  The songs and musical score actually detract from the scenes rather than compliment them.  The plots are fairly linear and when there are twists, they are so riduculous that it is comical.  I purchased this set to watch at work when I'm bored.  It's not even good enough for that.

The acting.....well, I kept expecting to see some, but did not (except for Cassar's episodes, which were somewhat less offensive than the rest). The writing was juvenile, at best. The costumes were.....well.....atrocious. Who dressed these people?

I made it through two disks of the first season, and elected to abandon this series.

Upon further reflection, I'm downgrading this review to ONE STAR. Relative to other series on DVD, it is Just That Bad. The first few episodes, the lead ""actress"" couldn't even speak with a consistent accent, for crying out loud. The ""plots"" were contrived, amateurish gruel. Old Dr. Who episodes were written better, and they were written for CHILDREN.

4284754,5,B0047BXR44,"I first saw the previews in 1997 for this breakout show on USA Network. In the past, they'd tried for serious and gotten a mite flaky (ie. Silk Stalkings, Pacific Blue etc.) and don't get me wrong, I liked those shows, but LFN had *something* from the beginning. Maybe it was Peta's striking looks or Roy's melt-you-into-a-puddle eyes/lips/voice/hair... but it was magic. Season One is a brutal introduction into the world of anti-terrorism and ghosts, where the operatives don't exist outside of Section and things are dealt with brutally if anything from the outside affects work. LFN is an amazing series that had incredible music, especially during first season with beauties such as the band Rhea's Obsession and Beverly Klass's Temple, iconic music for which much of it is no longer sold today (see Beverly Klass).

With a less than favorable budget, writers, directors, producers, and the rest of the cast and crew produced edge-of-the-seat story-lines and grabbed your attention. If you weren't lured by the premiere 'Nikita' then you were abducted by S1's episodes Escape and War in which Michael pulls brutal tricks on Nikita to meet his objectives.

The DVDs are great quality, if you have a large tv (46 inch and above) you will get a bit of graininess because it's not 1080p definition and I don't think the episodes were remastered for the releases. These sets were originally produced in 2003 - 2004 for Seasons 1-5. No blu-ray back then... :( However, the extras make up for it, including deleted scenes with commentary and written tracks and hilarious bloopers and outtakes at the end of the last disk. All in all, a great buy, especially considering the retail price is $100 and rarely do they go on sale like this. $13.99! I wish I'd waited eight years to buy them...

4284756,5,B0047BXR44,"La Femme Nikta is an extraordinary accomplishment; the finest psychological drama in television history.

If made in post 9/11 the production would have been clich.  The series, made prior to 9/11 was prescience.

The original French movie by the same name and ""Point of No Return"" were excellent seeds for the television series.  Television as a series plumed the depths of the implications established by the movies and writers of the series brilliantly explored those very murky depths.

Part of the wonderful flavor of the whole series, movies and TV is the French cinematic choreography, contributing vital feeling in the perception of the viewer.

The TV series is not for the faint of heart.  While graphically the presentation is intense, combined with the psychological conundrums, the viewer is left with an ambiguous moral sensibility after each episode and an associated anxiety.

4284758,2,B0047BXR44,"This show has the feel of a porn, except the porn.

There's very little story in a single episode with almost no twists or thrills. The characters are trying hard to be who they obviously are not. It's painfully clear that the main actress is there for her looks. Arguably the only unexpectedly pleasant part is that all girl-girl interaction has sexual undertones, but then it doesn't go anywhere ;)

The story of a street girl, framed for murder and forced to train as an anti-terrorist agent was gripping to watch. Excellently acted with intelligent plots and multi-faceted characters, the series delved into a world where no-one was as they seemed.

Nikita: Innocent victim, who despite doing what she has to in order to survive, manages to retain her humanity.

Michael: Apparently cold hearted and manipulative yet he hides his true nature as he knows that playing the game affords him greater chances of survival.

Walter: Aging weapons specialist with a fun sense of humour. Survives in the Section due to his value.

Madeline: Cold, perceptive and tactical. Madeline is the psychologist and torturer of the section. She has skeletons in her past, but she buries it in work.

Operations: Ambitious, Ruthless and cruel. Operations runs section efficiently, yet chafes at the eyes on his operation.

Birkhoff: Barely out of his teens, Birkhoff is the intelligent computer whiz kid responsible for all of sections computers. How this sweet guy ended up in section is left blank, yet we get the feeling that he had been too curious on the outside.

If you are bored by typical spoonfed fare on television, always anticipating the next move, the next line, and feel like everything is ""over-explained"" or overly simplistic, then you'll like this series. The first season is not my favorite, but it was enough to get me hooked on the show and is still better than most television shows today. I didn't watch the series when it was on television, but have watched and rewatched the DVD's at home. The series is a little dark, and gets progressively more so, but there's so much going on with the characters and their relationships are so interesting, particularly Michael and Nikita's... After watching the whole series all the way through you finally get answers to certain things and it makes you want to start watching them all over again now ""knowing"" the final outcome.

(Warning, the show has it's sexual moments, lots of violence and torture scenes and as such it is not appropriate for children. I have let my 13 year old watch ""certain episodes"" but not others, of course everyone draws the line in a different place, but be warned...)

Ironically, the producers of the show went on to create the hit series 24 which I just can't get into. La Femme Nikita is so stylish, unique and sexy with the amazing chemistry between the actors.

Since it had been a few years since I had seen any of the episodes, I was happy to see that many of the memorable episodes (and a couple of favorites) were in the first season.

The show was very unique when it was on air and I see a lot of what Nikita had (as a show) in contemporary shows now.  Some may disagree, especially since the first series aired in 1997.  There is a level of corniness to the show (very 90's), but the show evolved into what the original fans could see it had potential for.

This first season set is a decent set.  I'm a little worried about the disc book.  I feel like I need to barely open the book and take out a disc or I might wear the spine of it and the book case fall a part.  I guess this is an example of early DVD sets compared to how a lot of DVD sets are now (individual cases for each disc).

Since there are so many episodes, the lack of extra features is forgivable but one would think there would be more since these sets are pricey.  Deleted scenes, commentary, and a featurette are included on most of the discs.

Overall, this is a must have for anyone that enjoys action, love/romance, female leads, espionage, and TV drama.",1230422400,3,1384,4.044117647058823

4284778,4,B0047BXR44,"I have to admit that when I first started watching the first episode, I was pretty turned off by the flashy, razzle-dazzle jump-cutty style of the show. But once the story line took over I was definitely hooked. This is a supremely seductive show--not merely because the lead actress, Peta Wilson, is hot, but because the stories fuse enough exaggerated/fantasy stuff with real-world terrorist activities, a number of which have actually occurred. The show sticks in my head; it's adhesive. OK, so the Operations guy's acting is basically stiff as a board, and Michael (Roy Dupuis)'s nickname should really be ""Mister Whisper"" since that's basically how he talks all the time. But the guys who play Birkoff (the IT geek) and Walter (the weapons master) are both decent actors, and Alberta Watson as Madeline is an old pro, so she's fine. And Peta Wilson herself is also a more than decent actress; she does a great job as the main character.

But it's the plotting that carries the show; it's great. Yes, sometimes there are some logical inconsistencies, and sometimes there are some truly grisly moments (a father bites his daughter to death in the neck). But you can tell that the primary focus of the writers, producers and directors is to entertain--and that they do manage to accomplish. Along with ""Nowhere Man"" and ""Profit"" I count this as one of the best TV series ever made.",1227916800,,1383,4.8354430379746836
4284779,4,B0047BXR44,"i have to say they seemed to pay a little more attention to the music in the first series, especially the first episode they ever made which actually is on disk 2 called 'true love'.

disk 2 series are probably some of my favorite episodes on season 1 as well. im not into film directing so i don't know all the lingo, but the opening scene in 'obsessed' was very well done. nice little camera & editing tricks along with great timing with the music ( i think known as film scoring).

they have different directors and you can kind of tell which ones did which episodes as some of them seem to have certain 'styles'. as i said im no film expert or even amateur.

i do have to say peta is very very good with this character, alot of her character and emotions comes out through her eyes. if you can look at the first episode of series 1 compared to the first episode in series 3, you'll notice just how far developed nikita & most likely peta's character familiarization really comes into play.

roy on the other hand delivers just ok, he's great when he playing real cool & slightly ruthless  but some times his acting just doesn't deliver. the other actors seem to fit in their characters pretty well, no real complaints.

madeline & nikita seem to have slightly more mutual affection for each other in the first series. you don't get to learn too much about the other characters but in the next few series you do. i think the first & last series are probably my favorites, altho there are other episodes i liked in the other middle series.",1215993600,,1541,4.389473684210526

4284781,5,B0047BXR44,"First, I want to state that I did not watch Nikita on television, so my comments are limited to my viewing the Season One box set.  Second, I find it sad, but not surprising, that recent reviews have panned the show or the dvd quality.  In an entertainment world over 10 years later, Nikita lacks the ""luster,"" the ""non-stop explosives,"" and the ""mindless CGI effects"" that viewers today take for granted.  Moreover, since Nikita has a more ""cold war"" feel to it, I am sure those who didn't live during the cold war or did not learn their history lessons, may find it hard to understand that ""terrorism"" existed in abundance prior to our country's current activities.  Third, like many, I wish the show was in wide screen formate, but if reviewers and buyers read the description (and do a little research), they will learn that the show was not filmed in that formate.  Fourth, and most important to me, I take exception to reviews that pan the show for ""poor storylines, poor acting, poor production.""

Sadly, I purchased the Alias series--which I really like--first, so I found myself dismayed at the ""copy cat"" nature of Alias.  Nikita is truly a much superior show: the writing is tighter; the directing and editing excellent; the themes and story lines are fuller and more realistic; and, perhaps most importantly, the look is genuine--the producers utilized Toronto very convincingly; (I almost always felt like they were really on location, having lived in Europe for three years).  Peta Wilson was perfect for the show, her performances were generally outstanding, and over-all, award worthy.  While I personally did not care for Roy Dupuis' character, the actor's portrayals should not be confused with the character.  And Roy's portrayals are very commendable.  Together, Roy and Peta had great ""chemistry""--as they say.  Thus, I can state, with all due respect, that in my opinion the show does in fact have great story lines, superb acting, and amazing production (which was on a ""shoe string"" budget, even for the time).

All of that said, what really distinguishes Nikita is the fact that I find the episodes to be about relationships, not spies, sci-fi, terrorism, theoretical ""ultra-secret"" governmental agencies (albeit, I am sure the Bush administration would really enjoy the freedom of Section One), or any thing else.  It is a microscopic look at the way people interact (both in 1995 and today).  That is, through the established structure of the fictional Section One, relationships between people are highly controlled and well defined.  One wrong move and you are ""dead;"" figuratively or (from the view point of the show) literally.  One misunderstanding between two people can cascade into all sorts of outcomes.  Lies and truths are intertwined (granted, in exaggerated excesses), driving the various relationships.  Trust is a commodity that is elusive and even harder to maintain; games are habitually used.  And POWER is the key to all relationships, interactions/actions, and motivations--either directly or indirectly; with or with out awareness.

Watch Nikita, and look for yourself in the mirror that it holds up for us to look at our own lives.  I truly doubt that the creators and staff of Nikita intended to create a reflection of how relationships work, and I am not one to claim I know how they work.  However, having a Ph. D. in both Sociology and Anthropology, it is my opinion that this is the strength of the series, Le Femme Nikita.  For those interested in readings that influence my professional position, I recommend the following books in particular: The Homeless Mind: Modernization and Consciousness by Peter Berger, et al; Valuing the Self by Dorthy Lee (not available from Amazon); From Max Weber: Essays in Sociology by Max Weber (or any of his other works); Mind, Self, and Society by George Herbert Mead; and The Power Elite by C. Wright Mills.

As one final note, I would like to present MY personal opinion and position concerning the topic of Nikita: terrorism.  As a former military officer with considerable experience in security, intelligence, and anti-terrorism in mid 1970s, I believe that Nikita's portrayal of how terrorism must be dealt with is much more realistic than our so called ""War on Terrorism.""  Terrorists must be fought with terrorists: not hard working, patriotic soldiers of our fine military.  Terrorism is NOT war; and rhetoric cannot change that.",1204675200,4,4430,5.039780521262003

I'm assuming most of these reviews are from people with different tastes than mine. Don't watch alot of tv shows in this genre. TV shows i enjoy are Carnivale, Dexter, Six Feet Under, Lost, 24, Californication, Dead Like Me, Nip/Tuck, etc... Now you have an idea for my tastes and how this review might pertain to you.

As for the show.... the production was horrible. This is of course because of the low budget they had when making this show, but there are ways to make it look better than it comes out. The acting is not believable and the reactions and the way characters handle certain situations is laughable. The clothes are ridiculous for the most part (i'll blame that on the 90's) and the casting is off for almost every part. The action is short and too is laughable at times. The storylines may have some relevance but the way they are handled make you scratch your head. Not my cup of tea and the set is WAY overpriced. I suggest renting before you buy if you want to try it out. I couldn't get past 2 episodes so maybe it gets better... but i had no desire to find out. Thank god the best buy i brought it back to didn't have another copy so i was able to exchange my opened item and get store credit!

To think these things are really happening on an international scale may not be to presumptuous. Many of our movies today are based on this kind of intrigue. I guess being surprised at most of the maffiatic activities in Nakita's world is a bit naive, because even in many of the historical secular and religious writings, are tales of the same subversive and martial behaviors. The idea this kind of plot is part of the intelligence gathering world can only be justified by its plausible necessity which make viewing these plots more eye-opening to us of protected and secluded environments.

4284793,5,B0047BXR44,"I loved this show as a kid/teen (Peta Wilson, need I say more?). What am I saying? I'm still a fan of this show as an adult!

The thing I love about this show is just how atemporal, yet future-looking it is. It's basically set in its own world. It makes very few specific historical / temporal allusions. In that regard, it could be taking place anywhere, any time.

It really does stand the test of time. The special effects are on par with or even better than comparable effects in shows today. I still love the scenes with ubiquitous holography (even today it still looks futuristic / high tech).

Most of all, it's a high drama. This was really the show that MADE the high tech spy thriller show possible. It has led to such shows as Alias, 24, etc. But more than being about glitz and effect, it's about character, and personality. It's a very personal show. We really get inside the heads of the people of Section. And watching the show in its entirety, season-by-season, there is definitely a long-term story arc that develops as it goes.

I was sad when the show ended, but at the same time I was joyful that it ever happened at all. It was a beautiful thing.

The DVD's definitely do the show justice with excellent video quality, decent bonus features. Heck, even the packaging is slick. Love the book-in-case design! Love the episode guide that's included, like the deleted scenes and prefaces on how/why they were shot and why they were cut (usually to enhance suspense, or to keep with the grim reality of Section life, or with the characters as presented in the show).",1155254400,7,1582,4.536842105263158

4284798,5,B0047BXR44,"Nominated for 18 Gemini Awards (which honor the English language achievements of Canadian television), La Femme Nikita established itself as a stalwart on the USA Network in the late-1990s. Based on the 1990 motion picture of the same name, La Femme Nikita changed its cast, but not its edgy characters and exciting underworld setting. A forerunner to the successful hit series Alias, the show features all the intrigue of its successor coupled with the fast-paced action of 24. An hour-long action/adventure drama series, La Femme Nikita premiered on the first day of 1997 and quickly built a loyal fan base that followed the series for five stellar seasons before its premature cancellation in Spring 2001...

La Femme Nikita follows the life of Nikita (Peta Wilson), a woman wrongfully convicted of a brutal murder. Sentenced to life in prison, a top-secret government agency known only as Section One sets its sights on the woman it believes to be a ruthless killer. Faking Nikita's suicide, they usher her out of prison to train and program her into a willing and obedient assassin. But the conspirators at Section One didn't bank on Nikita's innocence. Now, they're stuck with a bloodthirsty felon who's not as bloodthirsty as they thought. Nevertheless, Nikita (now code-named 'Josephine') must carry out the orders of her superiors or else face her own death at the hands of an organization intent on keeping its secrets from the outside world. La Femme Nikita boasts an excellent cast to compliment Nikita's numerous adventures, among them are Michael Samuelle (Roy Dupuis), Davenport (Lawrence Bayne), Seymour Birkoff (Matthew Ferguson), Walter (Don Francks), and Paul ""Operations"" Wolfe (Eugene Robert Glazer). Together, they create an intriguing atmosphere of mysterious identities, ruthless assassins, and government conspiracies that is certain to entertain even the most discriminating of viewers...

The La Femme Nikita (Season 1) DVD features a number of exciting episodes including the series premiere ""Nikita"" in which Nikita, a lone girl living on the streets, is wrongfully convicted of a murder she did not commit. When the government fakes her prison cell suicide, Nikita awakes in the care of Section One, a super secret government entity with the goal of turning Nikita into an anti-terrorist assassin. But Nikita, who is innocent, initially resists the brainwashing techniques before finally submitting to the organization in order to stay alive... Other notable episodes from Season 1 include ""Gray"" in which a hacker compromises the employee database of Section One, and ""Noise"" in which Birkoff's fear of dying while on a mission threatens to end his career with Section One...

The DVD set is characterized by lively commentary from the show's Executive Consultant Joel Surnow and recurring director Jon Cassar.  Producer Robert Cochran and Executive Story Consultant Michael Loceff also occasionally narrate other episodes of the series DVD sets.

Though this set offers less deleted scenes and no bonus gag reels the purchase is definitely worth it for die hard fans.

4284812,5,B0047BXR44,"You could have bowled me over with a feather when USA Network took La Femme Nikita off the air. I was livid and suffering from assorted phases of shock and mourning at once. This show became my hands down favorite TV series off ALL TIME. I scrambled to the website for reason but found little I could live with. I felt like I recieved a fix when I learned that, because of overwhelming protest, they brought the cast back to film an additional nine final episodes. This indeed helped me with closure at the end of the last episode seeing Nikita as Operations.

 Not to sound like an obsessed fan or anything, but LFN and I just plain clicked. The writing was exemplary. The casting was outstanding. I don't believe anybody could have played Michael as good as Roy Dupuis or Peta Wilson as Nikita. It was like watching an excellent movie that lasted for 5 years. The stories always had great endings and the show, to me at least, was sometimes difficult if impossible to predict, as is not the case with most other TV shows and movie making. That alone was a huge plus. Sunday night became my TV night (and in reality I do not watch that much television).

 I took delivery of the DVD set of Season 1 and I'm in hog heaven, once again, after a difficult two and 1/2 year hiatus. I understand Season 2 is available and the first opportunity I get, I'm ordering.

4284813,5,B0047BXR44,"La Femme Nikita is truly an art form in regard to its brilliant and provocative portrayal of the human psyche.  Never has such a television series captured and cleverly displayed emotions so vividly through characters.  We can clearly emphasize, applaud, and dream of having Nikita's laurels.  We feel we grow as she does!  We love witnessing Michael's struggle of the man he must be in the Section and the man he really is.  We despise and at the same time, find ourselves attracted to both Madeline's and Operation's cold and ruthless behaviors.  The first season, although it was made in 1997, is still ahead of its time!  While the characters grapple with Section obstacles, their struggles with their own issues of humanity reminds us of our own.  Its exotic settings, great soundtrack (Depeche Mode, Morcheeba, Mono, Enigma, and much more), stylish and modern fashion make this series a real gem.

For me, this set meant no longer searching through my pile of VHS tapes to find an episode (which was often blurry and littered with commercial breaks anyway). It's the possibility to escape to section one for as long as you like, though watching one episode usually leads to watching 3 or 4 more (they seem much more intense without commercials).
The deleted scenes and commentary are truly appreciated, especially those that offer insight into character relations (I personally enjoy when Nikita offers Michael a drink of water...).  There is no doubt in my mind that I am satisfied with my purchase (I'm quite tempted to buy a second set in case something goes wrong with this one).

The makers have been quite dissappointed with sales and last i heard were very unsure if they would release the rest of the seasons.
I think were this priced more reasonable they would have more sales. But at nearly $80 dollars and roughly 8 seasons. (sorry i dont' remember the exact number) that is a lot of money. This is a cult series from a cable channel. It had a wide following but it wasn't Seinfeld in its popularity or the number of households it reached, therefore the potential dvd market is a bit smaller.

The four ""3-star"" reviews basically lament that this isn't Luc Besson's soulless movie Nikita.  There are five(5) 4-star reviews, and 161 out of 170 reviews give FIVE stars.  How many Amazon products do you think have those stats?
There is a reason.
This is the most intelligent spy-adventure series ever done, TV or movies.  It does not play dumb at *any* time.  Watch Alias after this, and you will wonder what you ever saw in Jennifer Garner.  And I loved Alias Season One.
BUT ... THIS ... STUNS!!!
The most remarkable thing is that all of Nikita was done before 9/11.  When you see what's going on, this will become more and more remarkable.
One small problem: The studio can't seem to get out seasons 2, 3, 4 and the short 5th season.  What dummys!!!  They'll probably whine when the bootlegs show up, too.",1068854400,15,920,4.5212121212121215
4284831,5,B0047BXR44,"If anyone has any doubts about buying a box set of television episodes on DVD (and I had mine), they have been put to rest.  This was my first such purchase and this show was a favorite of mine so I am glad I bought this DVD set.
I have all the episodes on tape and have seen them many times but the DVD package is outstanding.  I have seen details and nuances of the episodes I didn't see on first viewing.  Kudos to those who brought these episodes to DVD.

You don't have to be a fan of the show.  This show was buried on the USA Network and didn't receive the recognition it deserved but I believe that added to its charm.  It wasn't mainstream and this opened the door for it to develop the cult following it enjoys today.  I enjoyed the French movie of the same name but if you expect there to be similarities between the show and the movie, forget it!  The world of Section One is more ruthless and deadly.
The comparisons to Alias and ""24"" aren't valid.  The heroine in Alias isn't a strong enough female action hero and the world she lives in is too black and white.  La Femme Nikita also had a harder edge to it than Alias.  Alias is too lightweight.  Nikita's world was colored in shades of gray and the superiors in Section One were just as ruthless as the terrorists they fought every week!  In ""24"" the terrorism seems more like a ""B"" story than the main plotline.  The main plotlines of ""24"" deal with political intrigue.  Terrorist storylines are interwoven into the political intrigue in ""24"" but it isn't the main storyline as it was in La Femme Nikita.
It also isn't fair to compare Nikita to other kick-ass heroines, i.e., Buffy, Xena or Sydney in Alias.  Buffy fights in a world populated by fictional vampires, Xena is a warrior princess and Sydney was recruited for the secret organization she works for.  Nikita was not recruited she was forced to join Section One. She was largely a soldier fighting the war against terrorism.
Amazingly enough, this show came out before 9/11 and the theme largely running through the show is fighting the terrorists just as ruthlessly as the terrorist wages war on the unprotected population.  In Nikita's world, the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few, or the one.  A few must be sacrificed sometimes in the war against terrorism.
As with many DVD sets, there were a number of extras.  Strangely enough, as interesting as it was to hear from the creators Joel Surnow (Executive Consultant), Robert Cochran and Jon Cassar, the audio commentary they all provided during the first episode ""Nikita"" was distracting.  This feature however, can be turned off so that you can enjoy the episode.  I turned it on just to hear the commentary and it drove me crazy!  They talked incessantly throughout the episode.
Also, during the final episode ""Mercy"" Joel Surnow alone did commentary for that episode and he even put in a plug for his then new series he was working on ""24""!  I thought this was a tiny bit tacky but then both shows were his creation so perhaps it wasn't so much a shameless plug but maybe pride that he had another creative project on the horizon.  Whatever...
The deleted scenes were very interesting and only three of the actors (Peta Wilson, Roy Dupuis and Eugene Robert Glazer) were interviewed for this box set.  It certainly will be nice to hear from the others for the future seasons, that will hopefully also be released.",1068163200,7,3410,4.540098199672668
4284832,5,B0047BXR44,"I'm not sure if there are enough words to describe this incredible show. The cast is superb and I couldn't imagine any other actor in each of the character roles. They were all the perfect actors in the perfect roles, especially the two leads: Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis. Peta is gorgeous, stunning, emotional, and completely believable. Her talent is raw. She accurately illustrates her character Nikita's angst, desperation, and frustration about being forced to live in section one - the agency that supposedly enforces the greater good in an uncivilized and evil world. Roy's character Michael as Nikita's mentor and possibly something more, is handsome, sexy, and very mysterious. We never know what he's thinking or what his motives are. Roy is the perfect actor to play this role - his character is very laconic, yet he compensates for it in his eyes. His eyes say more than words ever could. He literally says so much while saying so little, yet he still remains an enigma. That is incredible acting! The entire cast is outstanding, attractive, and provocative and all their hard work really shows through in the show. This is the type of show that draws you in so much you almost forget you are watching tv - it seems very real at times. And it is extremely provocative. It vicariously addresses many moral issues, while appearing to be only about terrorism, espionage, and almost non-stop action and drama. There are many moral issues hiding underneath each show's plot, which really make you think. For example, is it right to kill 10 people to save the lives of 11? This show covertly addresses many such issues while still remaining entertaining and dramatic. The costumes are also excellent and show an eclectic assortment of attire and hairstyles, most notably in the show's star, Peta Wilson. She has a plethora of various styles throughout the season, yet they all coincide with who her character is. Whoever chose the costuming for this show did an excellent job. Not only is the show thrilling, but the extras are as well. There are nine deleted scenes, a behind-the-scenes look at La Femme Nikita with interviews of the cast and crew, two commentaries overlapping the very first and last episodes of the season (of course, you can also watch those episodes without the commentaries), and an Easter egg. As if the show wasn't superb enough on its own (which it is), the extras only make it even better, which I didn't believe was possible! I highly recommend this boxed set, with its unique blend of magnetism, drama, provocation, and thought provoking plots to anyone who appreciates a spectacular, invoking performance.",1067817600,7,2640,4.92152466367713

4284835,3,B0047BXR44,"It was the knowledge that this show was made by the creators of the groundbreaking 24 show that drew me to this DVD set.  Right away, something felt wrong.
The Joel Surnow/Robert Cochran signature of dark story lines, ruthless characters and violent plots is there, but the pilot had me gagging.  It was a fatal error to copy the first half of the original French film into the restrictive 50-minute TV format; events happen with almost no impact, and the whole setup seems wrong.  An agent with an Australian accent, a quaint oh-so-French name, mixed in with a mostly Canadian cast, set in Toronto locations but passing for an undisclosed U.S. location?  The Canadian locales wouldn't be so noticeable if they hadn't cast Peta Wilson as Nikita.  While she's hugely attractive and has a to-die-for figure, Wilson's Australian accent throws Nikita's character hopelessly off-balance with everything else.  Also, being an ex-model, Wilson's acting ability is somewhat shaky.  She improves about halfway through the show and grows more and more watchable, but she is highly self-conscious in the beginning third of the season.  This problem is nothing compared to whom they'd cast as her love interest...Roy Dupuis is simply horrible, horrible as Nikita's mentor and action man Michael.  Dupuis's Fabio-style mullet, baby-soft eyes and perpetual pout reduce him to a boy-toy character without an ounce of strength.  It's a little more bearable to watch him play sadder scenes, but to see him try to take command in the field is simply painful.  What this character needed was an actor with a steely core such as Kiefer Sutherland (Jack Bauer in 24) or Michael Weatherly (Logan Cale in Dark Angel).  Where Dark Angel succeeded in generating a rich, complex, and fascinating relationship between its main characters in one episode, it took me about 15 episodes of this show until I began to even care what Michael does.
There are also some unnecessarily cheesy touches to this show that serve to cheapen its value.  The cinematography, for example; some reviewers have called this show noir and not without reason (thanks to the insidious plotting), but the look of this show is all bright, almost kindergarten colours.  Add that to the directors' fondness for overusing that post-production slow-motion technique (which looks like a shutter-speed effect) especially in action scenes, and you got one low-budget-looking show.
Luckily, the scripts are pretty interesting, and Surnow and co. are never afraid to make the worst happen -- always a good thing when it comes to action-suspense stories.  And the supporting cast holds a few gems:  Matthew Ferguson is entirely engaging as tech nerd Birkoff, and Alberta Watson is fine as the matronly Madeline.  Some terrific guest spots as well, such as Peter Outerbridge (Kissed).  You may know him as the sadistic Ronnie Stark from 24's Season Two, but his sensitive guest turn here is highly moving.  Felicity Waterman is also great as enigmatic new recruit Karyn, and Surnow favourites Harris Yulin and Tobin Bell (Roger Stanton and Peter Kingsley in 24) show up to lend a touch of class to the acting department, almost successfully offsetting the big black hole that is Roy Dupuis.  Surprisingly, veteran Canadian actor Maury Chaykin does a sub-par job playing a Rain Man ripoff character; Chaykin is usually quite good at making unusual choices, but here he's all cliche.
La Femme Nikita, the series, obviously doesn't have the budget or innovation of 24.  Still, I think most of its problems aren't related to budget, but to choices -- Dupuis being the most glaring mistake.  As it is, it's a watchable series, but far from great.",1065657600,15,3677,5.06301824212272

The tension between the characters, and the environment keeps you gripped the whole time.  An entire series fraught with surprise endings, and plot twists, but you never get tired of it and only hunger for more.  Season One sets the ground work, and quickly scuplts the characters that you love to love (or love to hate depending).  I'm anxiously waiting for subsequent seasons.  One interesting thing about the series that I noticed after it was all over (both times...) is the titles.  Each season titles their episodes with the same number of words as the season itself.

Roy Dupuis (Michael), Walter, Madeline, and the rest are the silver lining.  This show was years before its time and takes Luc Besson's idea to a higher level.  If someone had been far-looking enough to see its potential there would never have been an Alias, a great show in its own right.  The acting is both raw and finessing, the actors can surprise the watcher and it appears sometimes each other with the scene development.  More money and studio support would have extended LFMs life, but the characters were already far beyond what passes for award winning performances.
If you want to see character development and an introspection into what is now obviously real world 'reality' then buy this and the following DVDs.  Peta Wilson and Roy Dupuis are two actors to watch for in the future - and you should really check Roy's past work - some of it 'campy' (not his fault about the writers) but you can see the talent.

Take a stylish and influential action film by a top French director. Remove all things French -- except for the title. Transform lead character from cold-blooded killer to spunky innocent. Pump up babe and hunk factor. Add stock characters such as computer whiz kid. Boil it all down to an hour and serve weekly on U.S. cable for five years. Mon dieu!
But things are never as they seem in the shadowy world of ""La Femme Nikita."" The TV series was, in fact, far better than it had to be, maintaining a loyal and highly interactive fan base during its 1997-2001 run on USA Network. Warner Home Video delivers the evidence in ""La Femme Nikita: The Complete First Season,"" a slick and sexy six-disc set.
The show's look was more John Woo than Luc Besson -- slow-motion violence and clandestine doings set in shadows and dramatic lights. Close-ups tended toward the extreme, the better to catch all those meaningful glances. On the DVD, the visuals look fine, with little grain and lots of high-tech colors on all those old-school computer screens.
The soundtrack -- full of under-the-radar indie music collected by Blaine Johnson -- has aged well. Composer Sean Callery's work anticipated the call of techno. Audio on the DVD set proves lively, with the stereo mix capably delivering the beeps, chirps and explosions.
The show's creators, who went on to make ""24,"" have a good time providing gang commentary for the first episode; producer Joel Surnow goes it alone for the season's cliffhanger ending.
A new making-of featurette checks in with the actors, who don't have a lot to add, but the piece will be fun for fans.

She brings Nikita to life with such compassion, spirit and vulnerability like I've never seen.
The chemistry between Nikita and Michael are something that I haven't seen in a long time with a series.

4284858,5,B0047BXR44,"The other reviews of LFN are right on and written by people who, like me,
became transfixed by the world it depicted. This television series had a bright
and thoughtful fanbase. As I relived Season One watching my copy of
the new release, I came up with the three aspects of LFN that I would bring to
a newcomer's attention as reasons to own this great collection, and things to ponder:
1. Interrogations - The bottom dropped out of my stomach whenever a scene cut to
 the ""clamp chair"" room. The portrayal of interrogation and torture as a daily,
routine part of  Section 1was fascinating. I've never been in the world of espionage,
but it seems quite plausible that extracting information from unwilling prisoners
has advanced to near the high-tech level portrayed. Madelline and co., to their credit, seem
to always try scare tactics first, but failing that, there are no heroes in that room.
No other TV series has ever dared tread this disturbing territory so regularly, or
so competently. You thought Zhora in Blade Runner was ""Beauty AND the Beast""-
consider Madelline to be Zhora's mentor. But, like Hitchcock, the horror is more
suggested than actually shown. . .
2. Nikita - thru Section 1 training, Nikita's street cunning was turned into a
 sophisticated tactical awareness. She became a superlatively trained human
being, carrying out orders with professional grace and efficiency (consistent
with her constant moral rebellion against Section ruthlessness). Off-duty,
all of this cooled and mellowed to a vibrant charisma that broadcast even more strongly
than her drop-dead gorgeous looks. Every episode, Wilson brilliantly (or perhaps-
just naturally) portrayed a fusion of strength, intelligence and compassion unique
to females, and before which even the most capable of male ""Class 5"" operatives
must bow. Her struggle to complete missions without the ruthlessness demanded
by Operations, and the ways she finds to do just that, is the central ""addictive"" component
of LFN.
3. Section One as Negative Utopia - As an ""employee"" of Section 1, you had a lot
of ""freedom from choice"". When you were finally allowed out of Section, to walk
among regular folks, either on or off duty, you had become a trained and focused
person - a lion among sheep. The dangers that operatives and support personnel like
Birkoff faced on a daily or weekly basis, the training and unlimited-budget technology
at their disposal, the heavily-armed assaults, the deceptions and role-playing to gain
access to guarded bad guys, etc, all constitute, even under the watchful gaze of Section,
a kind of freedom and intense living that the rest of us can only dream of. Section 1
was a prison because of the exclusive and extreme focus it demanded, but that focus created
dynamic and capable (though generally unhappy!) human beings.",1058918400,3,2821,5.06236559139785
4284859,5,B0047BXR44,"I believe the first four seasons of this series may indeed be the best TV has ever produced.  I will buy them all but I will NOT buy the fifth season.  The fifth season (last eight episodes) are pure garbage and almose ruined the entire run for me.  I swear that the episodes must have been written and directed by someone else.  I would like to know.  They were so bad and so out of character that it wasn't even the same show.  One star for the last season and five stars for the first four.  The show really has a legitimate ending with the end of the fourth season when Madeline bites it.  It was great!  To appease fans on some level they sold their souls and the soul of the show.  I recommend buying only the first four seasons and if the producers of these dvds are smart, they will include the last eight episodes in with the fourth season release so they can sell them.  If anyone tries to defend the last season, I wouldn't take their positive comments on the other seasons too seriously either.  Nothing is perfect in the tv world.

I watched every episode when it was on the air and was very sad to see it go. This show got everything: intrigue, romance, action, secret organization that does not exist in the world, psychological stuff, and also fun.

Suspencful and exhilirating should be the opening tag lines to this hugely anticipated and much awaited box set from the cult hit series on from the USA network, La Femme Nikita. Fresh faces from actors like Peta Wilson, Roy DuPuis, and Matthew Ferguson are pitted against veteran actors like Eugene Robert Glazer and Alberta Watson, which adds to the series unique flavor. Where other series get lost in the same repetative formula, La Femme Nikita kept it simple, adding new plot twists and character developments continously, which gave the series its vitality and eventually longitivity! The show was a psychological chiller and action packed thriller that kept its cult fan base tuned in every Sunday night like faithful addicts. The cover design and layout of the DVD set itself actually look the like the mission profile templates in the show, which is cool. It also lists which episodes are on each disk, with a disc by disc breakdown of extra footage and commentaries (which by the way, are awesome), so the viewer can view the episodes however they choose. Lots of extras and a low price are the icing on the cake for this long anticipated box set for a series that helped define the USA networks noteriety.",1058054400,41,1236,4.890476190476191

 Nothing less than perfect, the set is beautiful. When you open it you see the care taken in the execution of this wonderful product. A great tribute to a great show. Justice is given to the actors and writers that gave this show its place in television history. Not to mention the special place it will have in our hearts forever. To all Nikita fans, you will truly enjoy shelving this right next to all of your DVD favorites. The overall quality of the picture and sound are very good. You may notice some compression in the gray lit areas such as cloudy skies, low lit reflections but still even this could not lower my rating to a 4. We must remember the media used and the year it was made, but overall the quality is fine. The additional extras are wonderful and ""the making of Nikita"" will give you a glimpse at the cast and crews present state and their thoughts on the show.

as the original TV show plus contains some very special extras.  Seeing LFN again reminds me how far ahead of its' time this production was.  The actors are perfectly cast, the plots are addictive, the action is hot, the dialogue is sleek, the clothes are cool and the soundtrack is worthy of separate purchase.  I know I have to be patient but I am anxiously looking forward to Season 2 !!",1057795200,2,513,4.483870967741935

I was hooked after the first episode...and never missed a one. Watched every re-run.  When the show was cancelled I was literally heart-broken. If you have never experience what La Femme Nikita has to offer you definitely need this DVD set.  You'll watch them over and over.  When are Seasons 2 through 5 going to be available???,1057795200,2,450,4.6455696202531644

I *loved* this show, and watched it quite religiously in college.  Way too late now, I'm sure, but BRING IT BACK, USA!
The acting is very impressive, the plot lines are in depth and the shows all tie together, which always makes for a great series.
I am looking forward to watching this in order for once.  The reruns on USA always seemed to jump around randomly.",1057795200,,570,4.461538461538462
4284871,4,B0047BXR44,"4.5 , At last a TV show, with a dedicated fan base gets the treatment it deserves. Not only is the show respected by its presentation on the stated set, the above-average intelligent fan base get extras that matter i.e deleted(cancelled) scenes and commentaries. I backed off a 1/2 star for the bit fluffy ""Making Of"" included on disc 6. Still worth a peak though, but has that promo feel and of course, these type of ""promos"" never fully satisfy the true devotee.
 Picture: The picture quality is quite nice, very sharp. The blacks are very crisp and void of the heavy grain, that BTVS Seasons 1 and 2  suffered in some scenes.
 Audio: A 2.0 surround, with not much action from the surrounds. Still dialogue is nice and clear. For this show I just use an old PL receiver with ""Phantom"" to beef up the ambience. Still, for a TV show, not bad and passable.
 Extras: With us ""geeks"", ""cultists"", whatever you want to call us. When these underground shows like BTVS, LFN etc. come out. Us loyalists deserve the treatment this disc received. Although not perfect, the effort is apparent.
 Overall, this cult series need not praised for the content. We all know who we are and why we love the show so much. ""Ahead of its time"" as stated by an earlier reviewer is an understatement. This show had layers of characterization. For the ""newbie"", a bit tough to digest at first. The payoff is immeasurable. WB did a fine job on this set. I'd day 1/2 below ""Pristine"" is fair. A definite winner that I will visit often. A ""no-brainer"" purchase for fans of the show. A nice ""blind-buy"" for fans of Alias, BTVS, or any other film/tv that sports such a strong female lead.",1057795200,,1658,4.531772575250836
4284872,5,B0047BXR44,"I think all the positive responses regarding this highly anticipated DVD release speaks for itself.  This was truly one amazing series and definitely the best drama series ever to hit television.  Section 1 and everything in it was way ahead of its time.  The choice of music was excellent and fit each and every episode quite nicely.  It had an excellent cast of characters, most of which were so good at playing their roles that it made it difficult for the viewer to distinguish their true personalities. (Especially the case with ""Michael"")  Excellent acting, directing & storylines.  An equally exciting and entertaining series from beginning to end.  For those folks at WB...this overwhelming positive response should be enough to see just how many dedicated fans there are and should indicate just how important it is to release this entire series on DVD.  For those not familiar with the series, you'll be hooked after just the first episode.  Don't miss out on this DVD set.  It is worth every penny.",1057622400,3,1009,4.9171597633136095

La Femme Nikita has everything you could ever want from a TV show - great sets, fabulous costumes, music that rocks, and outstanding acting. This cast works so well with one another, it is easy to forget that you are watching a TV show. Peta Wilson has more sex appeal than the law allows; Rot Dupuis says more with a glance than the most eloquent speakers; Don, Matthew, Alberta, and Gene all come together to create the most perfect of casts.
The departure of having Nikita as a drug addict (as in the movie) to a homeless street kid in the show gives it something extra special. Nikita is an innocent in a world filled with evil. She keeps her morals while saving the world and finds love with sexy Michael, even if they can't admit it right away. ;o)

Each episode features its own story with many twists, turns, secrets and of course REALISTIC action. And all episodes connect together to tell a much bigger story/secret. All the characters in the movie progresses dramatically with the story as well.
It's so sad this series did not get the attention it deserves because it's on USA and not one of the major tv networks, while other [bad] tv series continues on.

All I can say is that I was blown away from episode one.  The fact that this was a television series on a cable network, working on a next-to-nothing budget never really made a difference because the cast and the amazing writing kept you on the edge of your seat.  It was an unforgettable five-season ride for the viewers.
Many times I wonder if a network like Fox (""24"") or ABC (""Alias"") had run the series would LFN have gotten the attention and awards it deserved?
Now with the release of season one on DVD everyone who missed it will be able to see why LFN was too good to last.

Even some of the people we hate throughout the story you kind of start to like them.  The stories are unpredictable which is just another reason I liked the series so much.  This is well done TV it's too bad most of TV land doesn't have a clue otherwise there would be more shows that display the genious of Nikita.
Hell even women like this show which is uncommon with ""cool"" shows that have guns and killing.  Can't say enough great things about this series.  The only bad thing with this series is THEY STOPPED MAKING IT!!",1053561600,5,845,4.365384615384615

La Femme Nikita is the only television show that ever seeped into my soul.  I'm not a big television watcher.  I just don't have the time.  Perhaps it was the time slot?  It started slowly, with an occasional Sunday evening viewing on USA Network.  Without realizing, I was starting to look forward to the second airing late at night on Sunday.  I then discovered reruns during the week and was addicted.  For those of us honest enough to admit that we like violence, intrigue, mental cruelty and danger mixed in with a hopelessly romantic, angst ridden, sexually charged storyline, LFN is perfection.
I won't even get into how ahead of its time it was.  You can read the other reviews.
Although it is now gone, it is certainly not forgotten! (I don't get Oxygen) All around the world there are many of us who, much to the concern of our loved ones, obsess with all things Michael Samuelle (Roy Dupuis ~ a la vie!) and Nikita (Peta Wilson ~ starring in The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen with Sean Connery this July).  Search the World Wide Web for LFN fan fiction.  There is enough of it out there to keep you busy reading for at least a year or longer!
The release of Season One on DVD's is an answer to our prays (and email!).
If La Femme Nikita holds a special place in your heart, I beg you to purchase Season One.  We need it to be successful if there are to be DVD's for seasons two, three, four and five!",1052956800,14,1475,4.358974358974359

This series is unique, and well worth owning on DVD. Unlike the banal witty dialog in all of today's action series...this one was quite different and pleasing. Finely emotionally nuanced so that communication takes place by a glance or a turn of the head. Astonishing use of silence, and mood, and music. This series is the antidote for all other series where everything is conveyed via dialog and nothing by character development. An organization dedicated to public good, but using evil techniques. Are its principals evil themselves or simply amoral? Characters have everything money can buy, but freedom or individual destiny. Nikita herself flourishes at Section, and is redeemed from a meaningless life on the streets..but is this redemption worth it? Does she lose herself or find herself? The moral contradictions alone are spellbinding. I recommend following director Joel Surnow's work (""24"") for similar production values.

So many innovative things were done, successfully,  that it's a game to count direct influences in post-Nikita shows. It was probably ahead of its time...or maybe it helped raise the bar for the rest of TV.
Most importantly, it is entertaining. Few other shows are worth watching more than once for nuance. But what they have in common is multiple layers of relationship going on, things that you don't need to catch the first time you see it but illuminate and enhance the story line when you do.",1052611200,3,588,4.6

The USA network took a big risk with this show and it payed off.  For three years the show did great but the numbers dwindled and the studio cancelled the show after the fourth season finale aired.  Because of the fans, LFN was brought back.  The fans of the show campaigned and succeeded for the show to be brought back for eight more episodes.

Quite frankly, the TV series is vastly superior to that cheap budgetted movie. The actors are much better, and the whole thing has much more polish, class, and intelligence to it (though you still have to give credit to the original director, since it was his idea).
The series is much more serious and caustic than the movie. It is amazing, because in every episode, huge ranges of emotion and mood are set by the subtlest of voice tones or facial expressions. It's like forcing all the water from Niagra falls through a drinking straw. The actors playing Nikita and Michael vastly exceed their French counterpart in acting, and the characters also exceed their French counterparts from the original. Likewise with Madeline and Operations, both of who's counterparts were card-board cutout characters in the original movie.

Inconsistencies in story line
Plot twists that are ridiculous
