5147354,5,B008CFZQQS,"I caught this show for the first time when HBO was running a marathon of every episode. I ended up staying up until 3am to get through them all and within a week had re-watched it all with my friends. This show is brilliant. I can totally understand the other reviews saying this is a love/hate show. Do I love everything these people do? No. But that's what makes me love the show. All of these people have their issues, and it's part of being human. There are more scenes with someone on a toilet in this show than I can count, which just adds to its realness. Sometimes important conversations can happen when you're having a p*ss. :) This show does a great job of NOT following a formula and also showing you that relationships are not cookie-cutter, they can be volatile and unpredictable and still be satisfying.

You won't be able to predict what will happen next on this show. I absolutely love it. Can't wait for Season 2! Several of my girlfriends are getting this for Christmas!!",1354406400,5,990,4.5

5147356,2,B008CFZQQS,"I'm 20, slightly younger than the ""Girls"" on this show, but close enough in age that plenty of their problems are relate-able for me. I was really excited for this show - it was like Sex and the City but with younger characters; characters who didn't have great jobs and were NOT yet in a place where they would be really looking for husbands or ready to have children.

Sadly, the first episode left kind of a bad taste in my mouth and so did the following ones until I let the series go about 3/4 the way into the season.

I think my main problem is the central character, Hannah. I really just couldn't bring myself to like her, which is odd because I think the actress who plays her (also the creator of the show!) Lena Dunham is lovely, and I'm taking a leap by assuming she based a lot of Hannah's personality off of herself.

You see, in the first episode she tries to convince her parents to keep financially supporting her by claiming she ""feels that she is to voice of her generation...or something (yes, that was heavily paraphrased). I have nothing against aiming big, that's not it. It's just I feel that you can change the world and hold down a paying job at the same time. Also, with the job market still so rocky, wouldn't a better argument be ""I just really don't know when I'm going to be able to find a paying job?""

Then later on she blows a huge job interview by making, and I am not kidding, a rape joke. Okay, I must admit that I am absolutely not the master of small talk or impressive job interviews but I feel that you would have to be ABSOLUTELY INCOMPETENT to make a rape joke (!) during a freaking JOB INTERVIEW, even with a friendly, like-minded interviewer. I doubt somebody in middle school would ever make that joke - much less a 25 year old woman. I realize it's just a TV show and it was put in there to make for a ""fun"" (and really, when are rape jokes ever appropriate?) awkward moment, but seriously?

There are other things that bothered me, for example the (LE GASP!) 22 year old virgin who the others are shocked to discover has not done the deed. Oh, by the way, this is while they are with Hannah who is getting an STD test (guess how it comes out you guyzzz!). Maybe it's just the bitter teen mother in me talking but is it really that odd to find a 22 year old virgin? Not that I believe there is ANYTHING wrong with premarital sex, but why be unflattering shocked when someone hasn't partaken in it yet? Especially when she is only a college student?

I do get that this is just a satire of young womanhood, and this fact has to be taken into thought. Being a girl myself I just don't believe this is how ""girls"" really are. Maybe it's a New York thing?

EDIT: Haha! Okay judging by the fact that somebody went through my profile and disliked everything I've ever reviewed within a half hour I'm going to assume that somebody REALLY likes this show. I really didn't mean to offend, I'm just being honest about not really liking the show!",1341878400,367,2983,4.306595365418895
5147357,5,B008CFZQQS,"A lot of people seem to vehemently hate this show without ever having watched it before. I admit that I was pretty skeptical about ""Girls,"" but after watching just one episode, I found that I absolutely loved it. The entire first season is fantastic. The best thing about the show is the writing, which is incredible. Lena Dunham is incredibly talented. It's hard to believe that she wrote, directed, produced, and starred in this series at such a young age and with very little experience. ""Girls"" follows the trials and tribulations of four young women who have been out of college for a couple of years and are trying to determine what kind of lives they want to build for themselves in New York City. The show is funny, poignant, honest, and heartwarming, and I can't get enough of it. (It kind of sucks that there are only 10 episodes.) I think the acting is wonderful, and a lot of these characters are much more realistic than the people you typically see portrayed on television. The one character I never really warmed up to at all is Shoshanna, who I think is super annoying (I'm glad she doesn't get nearly as much screen time as the other three girls). Hopefully she will grow on me in Season 2, which I can't wait to see.",1340928000,9,1234,4.513392857142857
5147358,1,B008CFZQQS,"Omg! It might have been a good show if I could've gotten over Hannahs awkwardness, it made it painful to watch, she's one of those people that you go out of your way to avoid because they make you feel so uncomfortable it was like looking at a stab wound, not to mention it was hard to see her in a girl role because she looked so much like a guy",1516579200,,346,3.887323943661972
5147359,3,B008CFZQQS,"I thought the writing was great and I like the characters. However, it is filled with gratuitous sex scenes! Yuck. Can't we have a great sitcom that doesn't get so close to pornography? It seems lazily provocative.",1515715200,2,214,4.8108108108108105
5147360,1,B008CFZQQS,"I must be one of the few 20-somethings of this generation that cannot identify with any aspect of the show. I did not find it funny in its strange brand of awkward humor. Even giving it the allowance of television-reality disconnect, nothing seemed to be believable. Maybe it is just a disconnect from the city Girls and me, but this attempt at the next generation of Sex in the City did not land well with me. Although part of the demographic, I am not part of their target audience.",1515369600,9,484,4.449438202247191

5147363,5,B008CFZQQS,"Leah Dunham is full of it. Talent, that is. She can write her away around any illogical setup or self-absorbed unlikable characters who just have a way of looking at life that's a little different from us normal people. They're cooler than us and they're sexually liberated that's for sure and they'll even take it in the out door if you know what I am saying if they really like the guy or girl. They're like some sort of human USB port.

There's a lot of great material in here yearning to get out though it's not easy to see the first 6-7 times you watch. I haven't had the time to watch for an eighth time but it has to be in there with the way the media lauds this ground-breaking show that's really shedding new light on something.

There is a lot of eye-rolling and some raw talk about people's bodies and their bathing suit zones. And it does not hurt that Adam Diver is a gigantic hunk of sunshine.",1512172800,,907,4.267441860465116
5147364,1,B008CFZQQS,"This was so difficult to watch. the characters are whiny and It's just not good. Lena Dunham is a racist and a rape apologist, and it comes out in her work quite obviously. The show doesn't even make sense. There's no way the characters can afford to live in the city like that.  There are no marginalized people in the show, it is all centered on snotty white people. If you like the fact that the male writer (miller) of the show is a rapist, and that Lena and another female writer defended him vehemently, then I guess this is for you. But even before that incident, the show has been problematic and tinged with racism, classism, and anti-LGBTQIAP+ attitudes (having a gay character doesn't cancel that out). Gross all around. And an annoying show to begin with.",1511740800,,767,4.557971014492754

5147372,5,B008CFZQQS,"THIS SHOW IS EFFING BRILLIANT!!!
I had to stop watching this show to write a review, which I have never done for a show or movie...ever. I find myself laughing, yelling, and being emotionally torn all at the same time and I love it. Plus, there are some powerful messages in this show: ""I don't like women telling other women, what to do, when to do it, or how to do it."" The girls are all so brilliant together and I can feel their raw friendship. Usually, Im really picky on what shows I watch on here, usually only shows with 4 stars and up... but I decided to give this show a try bc I heard Malia Obama was an intern for Lena during the last season (ridiculous, I know, but I love Malia). And to be honest, I am disappointed about the rating of this show on here, I think it is because some people don't quite understand/see the brilliance of the message behind it all! If you want to watch REAL life (hilarious) women put unfair female stigmas to rest all while flaunting their NOT size 0 body, this is the show for you!

It's a waste of time, and I regret ever watching all 6 seasons. Besides season 5, the story is all meaningless, and the sex scenes are good if you wanna fap to some thick Jewish ass (Not that there's anything wrong with that). Otherwise, it's all a bunch of post college grads, barely, making it in New York City, while getting nude and drugged up in the mean time. The last season doesn't do anything for the characters. There is literally no ending worth watch. All it shows is Hannah her half Middle-eastern (Muslim) baby. That's it. Save your money, or better yet: buy HBO NOW for a month, watch the series, if you really want to, and then watch Game of Thrones to wash everything out. You're welcome",1504310400,,835,4.5

5147376,2,B008CFZQQS,"I forced myself to watch more than one episode to save others from wasting their time through this review.
Girls is not awkward-cute (from my So-called life to any number of movies where the male or female protagonist is so clueless yet somehow muddles through); it's just disfunctional-pathetic. How did Lena Dunham win awards for this dribble?  Is it because they admired her courage for being naked on her own show?

The two stars are because it is occasionally interesting.  Also, if you're a woman, and your daddy (and/or mommy) never loved you, this show will make you feel better about yourself.",1502323200,3,602,4.882352941176471

5147379,2,B008CFZQQS,"I made it through the whole first episode, started the second, and just couldn't take it anymore. It's both too realistic and unrealistic at the same time. The realism is in the non-existent acting, and the awkward sex scenes, and the unrealistic parts are in how the girls interact. They are just awful with each other. I don't believe that they are friends at all. There is no chemistry or sparkle at all, just whiny, bitchy 20-something women.",1500508800,,446,4.730769230769231

Lena Dunham's character is an odd , reflective, obsessive compulsive ,  often nude and confused with life character. Jessa is a spunky, bisexual whose spontaneous and quite the rule breaking friend. Shoshanna is whiney, sensitive  but sweet over bubbly friend that won't stop talking . Lastly, is Marnie who is the often self obsessed and relationshipholic.  She tends to draw the attention on herself whenever possible .The first season explains each character and the difficulties of being in your early 20 somethings. Many laughs and many cringes~ I highly recommend this to anyone who also likes odd humor .",1496102400,,783,4.9541984732824424

5147410,2,B008CFZQQS,"I am open-minded, and a fan of HBO's talent pool and style of shows. The Wire, True Detective S1, Sopranos, and Game of Thrones, and Curb are among my favorite shows of all time. Also, I'm not in this show's demographics as a straight man living in the suburbs of the Deep South.

I did not like this show, yet I can see its appeal. I watched 3 episodes entirely and skimmed the rest of Season One through Season Five. The camera work, dialogue, NYC setting, and theme of finding yourself in your mid to late 20s after the Great Recession were the positives. What I couldn't stand is how vapid, superficial, and (intentionally?) mistake-prone these characters were. I didn't care for them or their hedonism or their privileged outlook. By the end of Season Five, it seemed the writers made a diagram of all the characters and made them sleep with one another. I have a need to finish stories so I was forced to skim the rest of the show, but in the end nothing really changed.

New York City is one of my favorite travel destinations. I visit it 2-3 times a year, and often overheard people similar to the characters while eating dinner or drinking coffee. Think mostly white, upper middle-class people who attended liberal arts colleges or art schools. This show gave a glimpse of those social circles, but the novelty wore off 3 episodes in.

The friendships and different personalities mixing make for what I consider an entertaining series. I can't say it's my favorite due to my age probably but it's in its tenth season so they're doing a lot right! I find definite similarities between Girls and Sex & The City which I loved!

5147528,3,B008CFZQQS,"Based on other reviews I had expected this to be a bunch of young girls walking around naked all the time.  No such luck! That would have been a redeeming factor for this series. I only watched a few episodes, but there nowhere near enough nudity to hold the guy's interest.  The first episode does open up with a guy and gal going through various humping positions, borderline porn, but only tits were exposed. Sadly, most of the series is boring dialogue from a bunch of young women trying to find there purpose in this world and that pretty much defines the series.

Obviously, the target audience is the twenty-something's of which I am not one.  Perhaps I gave up too soon.  I've given it three stars because there maybe some redemption in the later episodes.",1482192000,,764,4.588235294117647

To me, this is realistic and totally relatable to some extent",1481673600,,347,4.898305084745763
5147539,3,B008CFZQQS,"Mixed bag- and I'm not sure that I'm their target demographic-  stuff that's not great:  scripts seem contrived sometimes.  Virtually every female character is rudderless, is racked by extreme self-doubt or over-compensation, and chose their parents wisely enough to receive > $10K/year walkin-around $.  I realize that it's not a Census survey, but when you combine Money from Mommy w/ the young woman flailing emotionally, well, they take a bunch of poetic license.  Every 20-something main character is also very self-centered.  They show little awareness of others; even their emotional intimates.  For me, this limited my interest level to a couple of shows in any ""mini binge.""

Good stuff:  Lena is a gifted actress.  Wicked sense of humor and ability to laugh at how she beats herself up worse than anyone else can.  Reminds me of Woody Allen's early stuff. Her character is relaxed w/ her uneven vocational skill set, sexual appetite, body image stuff, etc.  The other characters either don't get as much help from the script, or I'm too dense to see the nuanced artistry.  I'm not much for characters' names, but the woman who is the Brooke Shields look-alike has some great material, but drops into Stepford Wife.  Maybe that's her role.  Dunno.  The obligatory gay guy, (closely linked to Lena's character, but I don't want to ruin it...), acts like a cardboard cut-out.  No complexity or layers.  Just shows some stereotype affectations.

Lena's parents, esp her mother, are excellent.  Mom REALLY nails it, but doesn't get much face time,at least thru episode 9.",1481673600,,1576,5.058365758754864

I can't waste any more precious brain cells or minutes with a character so absolutely unsympathetic. I know plenty of people with actual tough breaks, and to watch a bunch of spoiled brats whine about their lack of direction (""because Mom and Dad spoiled me!"") is disgusting, not funny. Yes, everyone's problems are important and real to them, but these are not problems that are interesting to me....the characters seem mostly tortured by the lack of engagement that comes with mommy and daddy providing everything and expecting nothing more than your utter happiness.",1478131200,2,808,4.948529411764706

""Girls just wanna have fun"" as I type this review this song coincidentally is on the radio.  Great series.  It does have explicit nudity, sexual scenes, experimentation with drugs, so definetly not meant for children.  It's one of those series a Girl wants to sit and enjoy an afternoon of fun watching TV before the kids and husbands are home.  Or for watching after the little ones are asleep.

Zosia Mamet is mesmerizing - almost like watching Tom Hanks do Forrest Gump... the show is hilarious at times, painful at times, sad at times, gripping at times, but always believable - it is simply a slice of reality... and the sparks really begin to fly near the end of the first season - i'm sold on Lena... and regarding the many comments about Lena's courageousness for her nude scenes and Gaby Hoffman's feeling that the notion of nudity as bravery is something of an insult: When I hear people say that about Lena I cringe, because I find it predicated on the notion that she somehow wouldnt feel comfortable with her body. That the bravery is coming from a place that shes doing it in spite of something. in spite of Gaby Hoffman's take that it is an insult to believe Lena was courageous for doing the nude scenes - it does take courage to swim against the current of this deranged culture and its incessant conditioning about body-image...

5147770,3,B008CFZQQS,"The first time I watched this, I hated it.  I'm glad I gave it a second shot.

The bad: The show reeks of privileged white Northeasterner girls.  It covers every type within that demographic, but it doesn't drift anywhere past that.  As a male Asian-Canadian (expat), it's not just really hard to relate, and at worst it's a bit tone deaf (i.e. white privilege).  I can't watch this show with my white friends, which was the mistake I made the first time. We enjoy the show differently.  1-star on this measure.

The good: Being in my early 30's, it's awesome to see a show about all the awkwardness of growing up during your 20's in today's world.  5-stars by this measure.  I love that a lot of new shows are addressing our generation.",1474156800,5,737,4.481203007518797

5147783,1,B008CFZQQS,"I really didn't want or need to see Lena Dunham naked. I could tell she didn't have the standard definition of a perfect body with her cloths on. How about give your audience a little credit for knowing what's going one between two naked/half naked adults and don't show it all--it's just distracting. I don't watch porn because I feel sorry for the people performing. Why do what all the male directors do? Why does Hollywood and NYC all need so much soft porn. It's just feeding a sickness and often actresses (and actors) feel obligated to get ahead. Only people with no decent values want to have sex in front of an audience.

If Lena was trying to prove something personally or make it okay for girls with imperfections to feel better about their bodies then there are other ways. The actresses and the whole story is a little too self absorbed. I felt sorry for all of the characters; so little depth to any of them. If Lena is the voice of her generations then the world is worse then I thought. And abortion as birth control is something that will haunt those that do it for the rest of their lives.",1473638400,,1107,4.426470588235294

I tried to at least see all of season one to be fair and I ended up skipping episodes after a while because I really didn't care about any of these selfish people and I just wanted to know how it ended. I hope that no one calls this a show that defines a generation or anything like that because the people portrayed in this show are the sort of people that I would totally avoid in real life. They're selfish, shallow, and idiotic. The writing is bad, the story is slow, and If this is supposed to represent feminist then I never want to be called one again.

I was binge watching ""Shameless"" & I was so sad when the series ended & I didn't think I could find another show that I would be just as excited about to watch. A few days later, I stumbled upon ""Girls"" which has an amazingly talented cast & the writing is absolutely superb. Lena really shows her character's true authentic self & isn't afraid to show any emotions or hold back in her acting. You can definitely relate to any character's storyline. Even 8 years after a really bad breakup, I was bawling at the breakup of Hannah & Adam (***SPOILER ALERT)*** after watching season 4. I vastly related to both emotions between man & woman which I never understood before until now.

OK I'm sure we'll be fine actually, but still. There's a profound lack of wisdom, integrity or character here. And I'm sure (if I watch further) that these girls are great about progressive values like tolerance and inclusion, but I'm reminded of a great passage from the Screwtape Letters (a work of fiction in which an experienced demon gives lessons to a newbie):

""The use of Fashions in thought is to distract the attention of men from their real dangers. We direct the fashionable outcry of each generation against those vices of which it is least in danger and fix its approval on the virtue nearest to that vice which we are trying to make endemic. The game is to have them running about with fire extinguishers whenever there is a flood, and all crowding to that side of the boat which is already nearly gunwale under. Thus we make it fashionable to expose the dangers of enthusiasm at the very moment when they are all really becoming worldly and lukewarm; a century later, when we are really making them all Byronic and drunk with emotion, the fashionable outcry is directed against the dangers of the mere ""understanding"".

""Cruel ages are put on their guard against Sentimentality, feckless and idle ones against Respectability, lecherous ones against Puritansm; and whenever all men are really hastening to be slaves or tyrants we make Liberalism the prime bogey.""

The problems these girls are most against (e.g. being judgmental) are probably the extremes of the directions they most need to move (e.g. more discernment). ...a lesson for us all I guess.",1470873600,,1747,4.852348993288591

These are women and they could even be described as somewhat intelligent women (in an academic sense)...but these are NOT women who think and behave like feminists. Strong, emotionally intelligent women don't allow themselves to be denigrated, used, and abused. There is no liberation or strength in begging for attention or clinging to scraps of affection. The only character I remotely liked is Marnie's boyfriend. His friend (I don't even remember his name) is one of the most annoying, appalling characters I have ever come across. Just repulsive.

There are funny moments, but they don't compensate for the rest of it. I hope young women don't watch this and think it's healthy behavior. This could have been such an amazing platform to display strong female characters. Wasted opportunity.",1469923200,2,883,5.0479452054794525

I have never had any intention of watching this, but caved because it came up free to watch on Amazon Prime and I hoped to connect with the other characters. I will say outright that the only character in the first 2 seasons worth anything is Marnie's boy friend. He is likable and impressive. All of the female characters are self-serving, self-centered, and self-destructive. None are worth liking or giving a s*** about. The Adam character is nasty and at first I thought they hired a mentally challenged character, which I thought was awesome. He looks like he is disabled and acts it too.

5148116,2,B008CFZQQS,"I want to go on record as saying the only reason I watch this show is because of Adam Driver he's like a young Keanu Reeves so any scene he's in is 5 stars the rest of them are just sleazy pieces of street trash. Although, I did get to where I liked Ray better (especially after he cried in season 2) - I've seen the first 4 seasons So, of the shows I've seen The last episode of the first season is it's best - Adam getting hit by the truck. The second episode of the second season is it's best - Adam getting arrested after Hannah calls the cops. The Third season is a tough one to get through and I can't think of anything positive to say about it. And, finally the 4th season Adam ""walking a mile in mud"" and also the episode where Ray has to go down and bail Adam & Jessa out of jail. That is basically all I really remember that I feel are seasons to watch and buy this show.",1466121600,,881,3.9273743016759775

However, was I in for a fantastic surprise - the lines are exactly what my girlfriends and I would say to each other years ago (when we were in our 20's) --- I could relate with few characters' personalities, the constant changing of minds which had me roaring with laughter remembering how we used to SWEAR we'd ""mean it"" and end up doing the very opposite. I loved all the characters which is so rare as I tend to be very finicky with characters' personalities - but all the actors did an AMAZING job of portraying honest real life like tendencies young adults are learning, discovering, exploring, experimenting.  What also delighted me was of some of the surprising slap-stick (Slapstick is a style of humor involving exaggerated physical activity which exceeds the boundaries of normal physical comedy) which artfully and skillfully punctuated endings magnificently.

The main character is played by Lena Dunham who said she created this show because she couldn't find any shows that she could relate to. Who wants to relate to a narcissistic, self-absorbed loser. She made this character to be someone nobody in my reality can relate to. The other characters are interesting and can be dynamic...but not enough energy is focused on the whole cast. The first season starts out interesting, then you spend the rest of your time trying to figure out why you are watching this show. Lena Dunham is writer, director, and main character. The other characters have a fashion sense, but Lena wears these awful clothes that nobody should have let her on screen with.

If you have a choice don't watch this train wreck. You will never get that time back.",1464220800,2,900,4.590062111801243

There were a couple of episodes where ""Hanna"" had to deal with an STD, which was good to show that sex isn't all just fun and games.  There are real consequences to sex. The F bomb gets overused but maybe that's really the way 20 somethings talk these days.

But if watching a handful of deeply flawed young adults trying to navigate careers and relationships and life in general sounds interesting to you, then you might just like Girls.

For people who do like this particular flavor of TV, the quality of Girls is top notch.  The acting is completely engrossing, maybe more so that anything else on TV right now.  This is enhanced by the brilliant script, which is at the same time innovative and completely natural.  Visually it's as cool and urban as you would expect for a show set in Manhattan.

5148596,3,B008CFZQQS,The first episode was tough to get through but it got slowly more entertaining though continued to be unrealistic.  There was too much nudity (for my taste) since it's a show that seems it's meant to appeal to women.  I inevitably enjoyed it enough to watch the second season but there were a few times that the characters were either so annoying or the dynamic was so unrealistic that I wanted to turn it off.  There were also a few story lines that I would have liked to see played out more.  The biggest thing about it that sticks with me is the main character's clothes.

5148638,1,B008CFZQQS,"I kept seeing the posters for this show in the subway so I thought I'd check it out since it's on Amazon Prime.  Obviously, I'm not the correct target demographic and it shows.  I finished the 10 episodes of Season 1 but in all honesty, I ""hate"" watched it.  Characters are selfish and want their every whim and desire just handed to them (the very first scene at the restaurant tells you basically all you need to know about character motivation) but for me, that's not entertainment.  I live in Manhattan and run into these characters far too often.  I thought Hannah and her friends would evolve a little by the 10th episode but no; perhaps in later seasons but I doubt I'll watch any further episodes.",1461024000,5,705,4.519685039370079

5148659,5,B008CFZQQS,"A few months ago I was going to be out of town for a few weeks in an area with no internet. So, I downloaded Girls onto my iPad because I saw that the first two seasons were available for free through Amazon prime. I had no prior impression of this show besides a few gifs I saw floating around the Internet.

At first I found this show overwhelmingly annoying. I felt like I could not relate to any of the main characters' personalities at all. HOWEVER, with no internet to provide me with other shows, I eventually continued watching. AND I WEIRDLY CAME TO LOVE THIS SHOW AND ACTUALLY CARE ABOUT THE CHARACTERS.

Although the characters are hard to take at times, they are entertaining and (most of) the situations they go through are 100% relatable. After season two the show really comes into its own and ends up being addictive. Also, the main guy characters in the show are amazing (although I saw the new Star Wars before seeing this show and so that was weird at first).

Overall, this show is great and I have binge-watched all the episodes up to the most recent episode in season five. I have no regrets. Give this show a shot, it may seem just ok at first but it gets much, much better. This show is a wonderful mix a comedy and drama.",1459814400,,1246,4.339055793991417

Overall I disliked the season, mainly because all the ridiculously self-centered and ignorant characters are just so petty and annoying. Kept hoping it'd get better. Gave season 2 a try and it's even worse. Main character is so hard to watch, so completely blind to the world and reality.

Maybe it's my age of 46 that prevented me from embracing it but I swear that from the opening scene I just absolutely despised the main character.  Her entitlement and self-centeredness was so off-putting!!  Maybe it's just easier for me to relate to her parents' characters but I found myself hating them too for raising such a loser.  Scene two, she is sleeping with her friend or roommate and they are physically entwined (but not sexually).  As a teenager I either spent the night with friends or had friends sleepover at my house almost every weekend and that kind of stuff just does not happen in real life, and quite thankfully.  Seeing Lena Dunham having sex with her boyfriend was nauseating because she is so unlikeable in every way.  I feel like the cast of characters are just a bunch of whiny millennials who are totally clueless but want to come off like they are so wise and witty.  I made it through about three episodes before calling it quits.

What I found was a sweet, laugh out loud at times series of young souls trying to find where they fit in a country that has kept them young and then suddenly expects them to grow up.  Lena Dunham has created an amazing look at her generations struggles to grow up and find their voice.  Its a universal, really ageless experience since the post Vietnam generations have come of age.  Nicely cast, Dunham and Adam Driver have a great chemistry and awkwardness and the balance of the cast is excellent as well.  Well worth a binge night!",1458518400,,601,4.427272727272728

5148770,1,B008CFZQQS,"I decided to watch an episode to see what everyone was raving about and I wish I hadn't and could go back and scrub my brain and eyes!! The show is stupid, lacks any substance, Hannah's ""boyfriend"" is completely wack and her desperation for sex or ""love"" is pathetic and the ""jokes"", and I used the term loosely, are NOT funny and some are downright AWFUL like the one about rapes on campus! I don't understand how there could be SO many people that like the show and the fact that she gets awards for it is preposterous!!!!!!! Maybe alot of the good reviews are fake or too many people watch it while being stoned or some other reason but this show is just garbage, plain and simple. The situation with her roommate and her boyfriend is based in reality and I've known people like that but Lena being the writer and then portraying the lead actress and that guy she is with is just horrid and I just want to go back and unsee everything that had to do with Lena. The only worthwhile part was the stuff with her roommate and her boyfriend storyline, but that made up VERY little of what I watched. CANNOT believe this garbage was renewed for 6 seasons, but there is smtg VERY wrong with viewers these days! They wouldn't know a good show if it bit them in the ass, but would enjoy the biting and TOTALLY miss the point of the bite!!",1458432000,2,1332,4.3107569721115535

And sometimes it's AMAZING and totally encapsulates what I perceive to be our collective experience as a demographic. But sometimes it's just too cringey in its characterizations, which sure, are part of what it's going for, but which also don't feel real even in a ""truth is stranger than fiction"" way.

Maybe this will come in later seasons, but the show doesn't have a working, driven, successful character. It doesn't even have to be a main character, just someone who maybe has a real job, is in their early 20s, who has challenges (even if they're not explored by the show) that resemble those faced by someone who is actually directly in a position to ""be successful"" or (god forbid) earn a living. There are no contemporary foils to the characters the show follows that get an iota of screen time.

That said, liked the show. Will probably watch season 2.",1458086400,7,977,4.775147928994083

I've only watched a few episodes so far but they do not feel very complex or real. The male supporting cast seems even shallower, though I suppose that could be intentional.

I think of myself as a pretty liberal, open minded woman. I see the value add in the struggle young people face with life challenges and how sex has its role in helping you find your place in this world.  I tried to accept seeing it on screen and really wanted to be able to accept the value add but it was hard.  I guess I still have the illusion that a young, maturing young woman can have a value system that gives a woman the option to choose value add relationships.  I just saw too much loss in meaningless relationships that can be costly to a young woman's ego and self esteem.  I thought the character development was great.  I love the concept and wish there was more depth in the decisions these young women are making.  I hope that I am not sounding like a critical grandmother.  I fully acknowledge where I am coming from and have the greatest respect for the writing, directing and development of these characters.

Some of the reviews just do not give it justice, nor did the reviewer watch enough to get a good feel for the show. Adam Driver (Adam, Hannah's boyfriend) is a little hard to take at first but slowly evolves into the greatest character in the entire show, chances are he will become your favorite.

This show isn't really for everyone. It's smart, witty, and organic. It's not overly glamorized like many shows on TV and the main character doesn't have the perfect body or the perfect look. There is also a lot of nudity and depictions of odd sexual behaviors, but it is charming and funny and I cannot wait to watch more of it!",1456099200,,720,4.333333333333333

The girls themselves are, yes, definitely, annoyingly self-involved and entitled, but that's the object of the satire, I think. It's meant to be funny, and often really is. The real reason to watch, though, is Adam Driver. It's an amazing, weird, intentionally awkward, deeply felt performance that is riveting even in moments when the character is appalling. (And so many times, he's wonderful and sensual and much more emotionally complicated than most men on TV are ever allowed to be. At this point, I'm basically obsessed.)

First, I understand it's not a biography. But based on the buzz, I expected to be able to relate to or cheer for at least one of the characters in the show, but I couldn't.  Second, I don't know how to adequately discribe how disturbing one of the male characters is, and the other men are bad representation as well. The writer(s) seems to hate men, as I did not recognize one solid male character 'of character'.  All of them are jerks or worse.  Third, the four primary female characters are so vapidly shallow and unrealisticly stupid that you can't cheer for any of them either.  I shudder to think that this show has run as long as it has, based on what I saw, or that anyone could possibly relate to any one of the characters in it.

I'm exactly the target audience (a 20-something female), but I couldn't relate to anything in this show. It's just a group of white upper-middle class girls refusing to grow up or take responsible for their own actions, and drowning in self-pity while making stupid decisions. I couldn't feel any empathy for any of the characters other than Shoshanna and Adam, and I'm pretty sure that was just thanks to the charm and talent of those two actors.",1453248000,,543,4.849462365591398

None of the show is believable; there is no explanation for how the characters afford their apartments, wardrobes and relatively lavish lifestyles in NYC while paying off student debt and constantly being in between jobs.  The glorification of alcoholism is also off-putting.  This show seeks to cash in on stereotypes about millennial age women, all the while making them out to be the absolute worst representations of this generation of women.  Anything but feminist.

I hate the characters and all that they stand for, yet I'm completely drawn to them in a very twisted sort of way. But maybe that's the catch.  Lena Dunham has managed to create a show that is controversial, clearly successful, and yet the characters are ""hated"" by some (if not many). But I guess that hate at least evokes some emotion that keeps viewers interested. I'd like to say that I can just stop watching one episode, but I continue to watch it in hopes that one, if not all of the characters will get out of their own ass, take financial security of their lives, stop being so selfish and entitled, and become a grown up.  But alas, I'm disappointed every episode. I can only find little joys in moments when someone refreshes their memory of the things that prevent them from becoming fully functioning responsible, independent women.  There are tender moments in the episode that remind you that these women are human, but again (I guess as in reality), they fall back to their entitled ways.",1449100800,2,1084,4.606217616580311

I watched the first season on Amazon Prime, and was totally excited that it goes on for four more seasons.

5149628,5,B008CFZQQS,"The quirky girls on GIRLS remind me of my college friends.  And what the show does so well is to show them in several dimensions, something most shows lack.  Yes Jessa is harebrained and mercurial, but she is also deeply loyal. Yes Shoshana is superficial, at first, and too concerned about looks and fashion, but we also find out she has a puritan moral code.

If you don't like GIRLS, then it is probably because you are a GUY!  But guys would understand girls better if they'd watch the show.  The show depicts young women in all their growing pains toward becoming mature, self-actualized women. What I like best is that the girls are shown warts and all. None are perfectly beautiful or glorious model-like creatures. Each is shown with all her flaws, both physical and emotional, and I've come to love each of them, well except Shoshana, but I'm working on loving her too.",1448064000,,878,4.638709677419355

5149737,1,B008CFZQQS,"Good grief. What an irresponsible child Lena Dunham's character is. I suppose it's never truly the fault of the child but of the parents who taught their daughter it was reasonable top expect to be supported well into adulthood.

First episode begins with her parents cutting her off and telling her to get a job. I think the mom was supposed to be the antagonist, at least from the main character's perspective, but I was cheering her on. I thought, ""so this is going to be a show about her really embracing independence and adulthood and getting her life together, great!"" Alas, I was too optimistic. It was in fact a half hour of whining about how unfair her parents were to expect her to support herself, and her friends encouraging her to try to persuade her parents to change their minds.

Great tv shows have characters that are challenged and grow, that have depth of character that informs their struggles with life issues..... by contrast, Girls is a show about immature children who don't want to face reality, much less grow up, because working to pay bills and being a responsible person just is no fun.

5149747,1,B008CFZQQS,"To those who disagree with me, feel free because I don't care. This was effing terrible! The characters were just like everybody else described them--rude, selfish, arrogant, conceited, unrealistic sluts! I couldn't get past three episodes and those three episodes were literally about one girl getting pregnant, thinking about murdering her child with an abortion and then abandoning that idea while leaving her friends in the clinic to wonder why she never showed, another girl who has absolutely no self respect or class and sleeps around with some POS because her parents told her to put her college education to work and start paying her own bills and then gets high, acts like an idiot, and finds out she has an STD, a different girl who is bossy, unappreciative of her boyfriend treating her like the queen she is and wants him to treat her like she's worth less than dirt, and one last girl who talks too much, has like no friends, and makes a big deal out of the fact that she's embarrassed (not proud) of the fact that she waited for someone who was worth her time, love, attention, and affection.

They prance around and slut around and act like idiots and expect the viewers to somehow identify with them or have sympathy for them, and I just can't do it. The pathetic attempts at humor are dry and stupid and this is just not worth my time. Or money, but you know, thank God it was free.",1446076800,5,1400,4.577689243027889

The characters are relatable, but you will want to strangle or call one their mothers during each episode to try to get a grasp on why they act like an idiot raised in a foxhole. Unapologetically gratuitous nudity/utterly awkward sexual situations that very rarely put the women in control and very rarely further the plot. Feminism my rear end.

No can't-get-it-together Hannahs...just some soon-regretted risk-seeking Jessa moments and Shoshanna freakouts.  So every Girls episode left me marveling that Hannah could attract (much less keep) anyone's positive attention and friendship.

I must confess that I only managed to watch the first twenty minutes of season 1, and then gave up, finding much better things to do with my spare time. I was initially curious about the program having heard an interview with Lena Dunham and references to her part in the series, but I hope she doesn't consider this as the high point in her career.

The contrived lunch with parents who cut her off their financial support did not ring true, was it because of the indifferent acting, or poor dialog that turned me off so quickly - I don't know, I'm not a professional critic and obviously not very articulate, but I suspect that the series is aimed at very young adults.",1443139200,4,744,4.463235294117647

with her motly group of girl and guy-friends, focused on the real and often immature things that many, even fairly
bright ""transition-age youths 18-25 are doing and thinking about these days with in the real world. In bringing this to the screen,
as writer and producer, Lena Dunham has made a marvelous contribution giving us a fairly realistic window into young womanhood.

The writing attempts to be diverse and ""hip"" but falls quite flat when trying illustrate these young girls lives. The show makes it clear that it is primarily focused on the theme of sex, you will constantly be bombarded with sexual pretense and awkward scenes that are attempting to make sex less of a polarizing subject in the context of women but ends up making itself look unnecessary and gross. This show has a bit of an agenda and that is something that needs to be stressed, having an agenda when writing fiction is to this day one of the most polar topics of debate with writers. As for the agenda itself: expect an EXTREMELY left winged take on daily life and conflict, uncomfortably so in my opinion. Overall the show takes managed to keep me interested for about 3-4 episodes and then I sort of lost interest. Some might enjoy this show, some may not.",1440460800,,955,4.558139534883721

I read that Lena Dunham wanted to create something that better reflected her and her friends lives, but this was a very different, and frankly sad, perspective for me.  I didn't even finish watching the first season - there wasn't enough depth as to the ""whys"" of the female characters and the males all seemed completely one-dimensional.  I just couldn't find one character I could sympathize with.  Maybe if I continued watching I would have gotten more insight, but it was too depressing for me to continue.

It's funny, but can be very emotional. But most importantly, it's smart and realistic. Although not all of us live in NYC and live the luxurious lives of women, they struggle with the same problems that real women do. The women face insecurities, relationship problems, jealousy, money issues, etc. just as all women do. Most importantly, the show focuses on the point that these women seem to have it all, yet still find problems with every situation...as a woman, I can 100% vouch for this. It doesn't portray the girls as pretentious (because they really aren't), they are just naive. I'm so glad Girls is such a hit, because it filled a void that needed a new kind of (dark??) comedy.

At least they are not destroying a child's life with being lousy moms. You take away the listless pathetic sexual encounters with her chubby body and you don't have much to watch.

Girls falls into the dramedy genre of comedy so the personalities and situations are exaggerated just enough. The cast is great, the guys too, and her Hannah gets away with being painfully neurotic because she's truly endearing. The low-rent environment depicts Brooklyn as expected when you're fresh out of school and willing to survive in New York for a yet unknown purpose. New York attracts all kinds of interesting and weird people that get into all kinds of situations. I love how the characters evolve with each experience, ridiculous at times, funny, intelligent, uncertain, and laughably gross, too, brutally honest.",1437523200,,761,5.0476190476190474

5150518,5,B008CFZQQS,"This is actually pretty funny and very quick humor so you have to listen so you don't miss anything.  It reminds me (sort of) of a Sex In The City with four good friends, but these friends aren't well established and don't care about hair, makeup, clothes, or shoes.  They fight among themselves and lose job regularly.  It's actually total opposite of the girls on Sex In The City but similar in that it's about four girls and their experiences with men.  I enjoyed the first season and am looking forward to watching the other three seasons.  The thing that annoys me a lot is that Prime ONLY lets us view Season 1, and then we ""have"" to pay to watch the other seasons.  Not right!!

5150520,3,B008CFZQQS,I only side-watched a small part of the episode when two people moved up and down on top of each other and talked incessantly about the problems of poverty affecting 3rd world countries. Or maybe that what I thought they talked about. My immediate reaction was that the tempo was a bit unrealistic and the voice over wasn't synchronized with the physical movement. I thought how it must have been tough to be a cameraman on a set and perhaps all this explains why the conversation wasn't on par with depth and intelligence one would always expect from Lena Dunham.,1437264000,,564,4.65

5150531,1,B008CFZQQS,"By the time I got through the third episode, I was over it! It's boring and lackluster. The characters are self serving and two dimensional. No depth or meat to them. While I applaud any show that promotes women's sexuality in a positive way, by the third episode all I could think was that this show is just mild porn with no real plot. The Hannah character is especially pathetic, constantly crawling back to a boy who cannot give her what she needs, emotionally or sexually. How is that a positive role model? In fact they all act sexually immature, like twelve year old girls who are looking at an anatomy book. I had to stop watching or my eyes would have been stuck permanently rolling.

If you're looking for something steamy and sensual involving two consenting adults, you should skip this.  If you're looking for a lighthearted chick show about young women having sexy fun where they are 100% in control of their bodies, you should skip this.  If seeing the sort of ""gray area"" date rape that law enforcement doesn't take seriously on screen in excruciating detail is going to upset you, don't watch this show.

Hannah's boyfriend doesn't care about consent, and I'm not sure she even qualifies as an adult who can give consent anyways given that she's not competent to support herself.  He rapes her on screen halfway through the first episode because ""you're over my house, so you better give me something"" (quote verbatim) and for some godforsaken reason, the screenwriter, episode guide, show promotion, and even consumer reviews seem to concur that being bullied into sex by your sleazy boyfriend is healthy for a sexually active young woman.  She automatically owes him sex because she's in his apartment?  Seriously???  The fact that women gave this five star reviews ""because it's sexually empowering for women"" is concerning.  Ladies, that is literally rape by definition and I strongly urge reviewers who wrote ""this is sexually empowering for women"" to research date rape, marital rape, etc and evaluate your own relationships.  That's not empowering AT ALL.  It's disempowering, dehumanizing, and just plain disgraceful that any women have anything positive to say about the sexual situations in this show.",1436745600,2,1571,5.145669291338582

5150613,5,B008CFZQQS,"I've read the negative reviews, but luckily I took them with a grain of salt. This show would appeal to a somewhat narrow demographic, and a male in his mid-40's is nowhere near the target audience here. It's unsurprising that people outside of this range would be immediately turned off. It doesn't speak to you, but that doesn't mean it isn't done well. To millennials, ""GIRLS"" speaks the subtleties and distinctions that have permeated our language and the increasingly complex ways that we communicate. No generation before us can relate to having lived through this explosion of media and communication technology, the removal of personal interaction in favor of hundreds of ever-growing and changing media, and the confusion that stems from our immense and ever-increasing scope of technological presence, and how this new reality contends with our efforts to ground ourselves into a stable adulthood. That said, this is not at all a realistic show in the sense of the characters' mindsets. It's raw in every facet and over-the-top brutally honest, but it doesn't represent a typical mid-20's female (at least no one I've ever known), but the beauty of it is how imaginable and realistically it's portrayed, despite the ridiculousness of their circumstances and terrible choices. Truthfully, this show makes me grateful I have never sunk so low in my life. But as much as it makes me cringe, the humanity and depth, the increasingly poor decisions, the open ridicule they give and receive, I find it all so compelling. I wouldn't watch a show that mimics my existence. In this case, I enjoy the hyperbolic, excessive, self-indulgent, impulsive, total clustermess of the character's lives and decisions. I've never seen or read anything quite like this.
I've read negative reviews that a lot of young women my age can't ""relate"" to the characters. But a show about completely typical, well-rounded individuals wouldn't make it to HBO. If you DO feel like these people are completely just like you, well... I'm sorry... I hope you're doing okay.
As I said, it's not for everyone. I indulged in watching it alone, figuring my fiance wouldn't appreciate it, so I wouldn't subject him to it. But yesterday I craved it, apologized in advance in case he hated it, and then he sat through a few episodes, ending up mildly impressed, laughing a few times, and asking questions about the characters' backgrounds. ""GIRLS"" definitely isn't going to attract most typical straight males in general (probably, no judgment at all), but as a media director, editor, and movie buff, my fiance commented that it was objectively well done and he appreciated the humor and artistic style. But he's probably not going to request it again, and that's fine. It really isn't for everybody.",1436745600,,2770,5.037037037037037

5150709,1,B008CFZQQS,"It's always hilariously insane and 100% hypocritical that shows about moronic, slutty women are touted as brilliant while the same exact show with horndog, moronic men gets panned and called garbage. It's hilarious that Hollywood wants to hold up the morbidly obese laugh at me for no other reason than I'm fat Melissa McCarthy and say she and plain fat women like Lena Dunham are ""beautiful"" at the same time Michelle Obama is out telling kids to eat healthy and nobody figures out why we have an obesity problem in the USA. They hold these cows up as role models, these never met 8 meals a day they didn't like women and call their shows ""groundbreaking"" and they are if by groundbreaking they mean the ground breaks when these women walk. On top of that, Lena Dunham created this self-serving show for herself because nobody else but Lena is going to make a show about Lena having sex. NOBODY! On top of that, they constantly have sex with their clothes on, which rarely happens in real life. On top of that, this show only seems like a ""smart"" show if you're also one of the people who went to school in this country with an obesity problem AND an education problem. Fat isn't beautiful and it certainly isn't healthy and saying it's OK to both over eat and be so lazy that you can't walk around the block at least to lose a few pounds isn't a liberal message. It's a hypocritical and dangerous message. Same goes for Chris Farley when he was alive and lots of other men if you think this is just a sexist review. So to recap, I Love Lucy is a ""classic"" to the hypocrites while The Three Stooges doing the same exact thing is moronic to most. This show is award worthy to the hypocrites at the same time nearly all the shows about groups of men are called moronic. The only thing smart about this show is how Lena Dunham fleeced the Hollywood liberals in name only into putting this show on in the first place. These ""girls"" are fairly stupid and like most shows on TV today none of you would want to be friends with all these characters in real life and yet you rate it a 7.6 and call it ""realistic"". It's as realistic as Lord of the Rings and if you want to watch something entertaining and smart watch that, not this awful, awful, awful, totally unrealistic show.",1436054400,6,2270,4.420047732696897

Every single one is either whiny, mean, arrogant, entitled, dismissive, selfish, air-headed, or a fun combination of several of these.

5150743,2,B008CFZQQS,"it's kind of boring, but in a watching-a-train-wreck way. They're a bunch of self-entitled, vapid oxygen thieves. On the other hand, if the actors and actresses are actually acting and not really like this, they do a terrific job portraying no-talent. I can't honestly say I like it; two episodes (in case the first was an aberration) and I'm done. No point, not much plot, just sort of a Seinfeld-like bunch of 20-somethings plodding through their pointless lives, but without the Seinfeld comedy, insight, or much anything else. Perhaps it should die after one season. If, in the unlikely event someone actually liked it, they could just watch season 1 for a second time, there's nothing much memorable so it would be newly-dull all over again.

If this is a reasonably accurate reflection of Millennials, their parents should have been a bit more attentive to birth control.",1435968000,4,877,4.965986394557823

It's odd -- there seems to be no real point to the show, just following the lives of these four girls in NYC. Despite my apparent disinterest in the show or its plot, I still find myself watching it, so it must be all right, right? It seems to be aimed at taking the place of Sex and the City for the next generation, however in Girls, I do not see an actual reason for the show, there are no lessons learned, the characters are slightly less likeable than those of SATC, and it just seems more average in every respect. From what I gather, that's the point of the show, it's just an account of modern-day life for 20 somethings, and that's not really of interest to me, personally.",1435363200,,767,4.260273972602739

5150910,4,B008CFZQQS,"This series clearly is of the love / hate variety, as the reviews indicate. As a 64 y/o male, I'm light years away from the intended  audience demographic, as I was also for Sex in the City, to which it must inevitably be compared (4 women dating and surviving in NYC). I refer to it as ""Sex in the City- the Next Generation."" Female characters younger and less affluent than the precursor, but to my mind equally as interesting, if contrived. I do not understand the vitriol common to so many of the negative reviews. I find the show well written and entertaining as depictions of a generation I know nothing about, other than from the point of view of a parent - i.e. an outsider. If the characters are self absorbed and vapid, they reflect reality. Who at that age isn't a tad narcissistic?  I don't believe that I found the characters of Sex and the City likable either, but that didn't keep me from watching and enjoying  those shows. Lena Dunham appears to have less collaborators writing this show than the group which authored Sex and the City, and for that she should be commended.

I will have no hesitation, and look forward to, renting and watching the remaining seasons.",1434758400,,1183,4.566037735849057

and are seldom noticed in entertainment.
No glamour, no stereotypes, the protagonist is a sort of ""anti star"".  A woman in difficult
circumstances, living like a student after college even though she is privileged.
She strips off in a matter of fact way and has sex that may or may not be
enjoyable.  She says she hates herself, which must be ruinous.  She doesn't show
a 'film star body', it is a body, treated as a generic woman's. She has ambition and grit.
She is plain spoken and intelligent and fearless, all in a quiet matter of fact way.

down the street which turns out to be more interesting than expected.",1434412800,,772,4.572463768115942

This show depicts 20-somethings' characteristics so well, you'll relate to each of the protagonists in your own way and be rooting for them to succeed (to dump that terrible boyfriend, to quit that underpaying job, or to yell at deliverers of bad advice). It's brilliant. Lena Dunham brings up things NO ONE talks about, that no one ever WANTS to talk about. You suddenly feel vindicated for the struggle you put up against the ugly things we faced growing up. You're suddenly not haunted by embarrassing high school memories because someone else is saying it happened to them, too.

5151298,4,B008CFZQQS,"Sometimes awkward for awkward's sake, GIRLS is an unflinching look at the lives of millennials trying to make it in The Big Apple. As such, it's both the anti-SEX & THE CITY and entirely beholden to SEX & THE CITY, and it reveals some moments of truth that have seldom if ever been examined on screen. GIRLS is raw and unflinching in its depiction of navigating friendship, careers, identity, and most of all sex. I watched the first season years after it made its HBO debut. At times I was annoyed by protagonist Hannah Horvath and her completely self-absorbed, self-delusional, shlumpadinka behavior, particularly in regard to her parents and the roommate who let her crash rent-free. But at other times, I totally identified with her -- and I'm old enough to be her mother. The season ender, in which her boyfriend accuses her of being a ""monster"" for seeming to reject his sudden commitment to their relationship just wrecked me. I thought, if she had nagged at him to make their relationship more permanent or insisted that he move in, he probably would have thought she was clingy and would been the first to break and run. But Hannah's low self-esteem has been a running theme of the show, so his accusations rang true.  Kudos to series creator, director, and star Lena Dunham.

The only reason I kept the painful, illogical and hedonistic misadventures of Lena Dunham's questionably fiction character ""Hannah"" is that I thought perhaps the next episode will satisfy my need for substance. Alas, there was none, and honestly I wanted to like her character but I couldn't. I felt like every time I was suppose to cheer for her I was glad someone else was pointing out how terribly narcissistic, hypocritical and in-compassionate she was being. As for the story I felt like many episodes left so much open too, no really closure throughout. I don't think I could relate to any girls in the show but then again I don't have many girl friends anyway. I believe in TMI, tact, and conciseness within my social interaction. How can a self-proclaimed feminist be making rape jokes and asking guys to abuse her??

Check out the award nominations for this show and see the quality.  Yes, it can be a lkittle crude, but that is part of the draw.

5151440,1,B008CFZQQS,"I really wish this show would be removed. I am upset that Amazon is endorsing a show written and produced by a self-admitted child molester. Lena Dunham has said and done despicable things. She is currently making money off her ""tell all"" book, titled ""Not That Kind of Girl"" in which she writes:

""As she grew, I took to bribing her for her time and affection: one dollar in quarters if I could do her makeup like a motorcycle chick. Three pieces of candy if I could kiss her on the lips for five seconds. Whatever she wanted to watch on TV if she would just relax on me. Basically, anything a sexual predator might do to woo a small suburban girl I was trying.""

and

""I shared a bed with my sister, Grace, until I was seventeen years old. She was afraid to sleep alone and would begin asking me around 5:00 P.M. every day whether she could sleep with me. I put on a big show of saying no, taking pleasure in watching her beg and sulk, but eventually I always relented. Her sticky, muscly little body thrashed beside me every night as I read Anne Sexton, watched reruns of SNL, sometimes even as I slipped my hand into my underwear to figure some stuff out.""

She even outed her sister as a lesbian to their parents before she was ready because she was mad that her sister was an independent person as an adult.

Please do not support this terrible human being who treats child abuse as a ""quirky thing"" she did as a 17 year old that should have known better.",1433289600,4,1461,4.298181818181818

Maybe it's a millennial vs baby boomer thing, but I don't think so. I'm also annoyed by shows based in NYC that are all or mostly lily white.

They are all supposedly college educated, but they have no class and even less sense - not to mention being totally self-absorbed. And I'm sorry, but people are just not that crude - even 20-somethings in NYC.  It's a slightly more sophisticated version of 2-Broke-Girls-type humor, based almost entirely on shocking the audience with crude sexual dialogue/situations (and it takes a lot these days to shock HBO watchers). These shows like to fancy themselves as ""edgy"" and ""pushing the envelope"" but they are certainly nothing new. It's in the realm of the bawdy limerick or Howard Stern - dressed up as young adults in NYC. It's humor that aims for the lowest common denominator.

5151651,5,B008CFZQQS,"When I first started watching Girls I  wasn't sure how I'd feel about it after the first or second episode. But as the characters developed,  I really got into it in a big way.

The female characters play nicely off of each other at the beginning - all long time friends who have come to live in New York one way or another.  As time goes on the dynamic of those ffrienships change,  as fights,  bitterness,  men,  and life happens.  Initially, the twenty-somethings start off with ideals as most of us do,  searching for that great job,  trying to write the next great novel,their through the written word trying to be  voice  their generation. All the young women and men are trying,  each in their own way to find some semblance of a relationship - to relate to another with some meaningfulness.  Unfortunately, just like in the real world,  some are given better skills at maneuvering the real world than others.

Where others found the show detestible or disgusting,  I  found it pretty true to life. We're all functioning at different levels of socials capability.  You can see very clearly who has good boundaries and who doesn't,  who's screaming out for their partner to wake the hell up and get real, and who's hiding behind any number of things - from avoidance/TV, bring a people pleaser, to various  substances , to hiding behind a personality to see if you'll push someone away.

The series also explores sexual issues like sexually transmitted diseases,  the use of condoms,  abortion, gay relationshIps to what appears to be a very confusing, abusive,  sadistic,  victimizing relationship - which I saw as a man who grew up as a hurt,  damaged child,  who needed to know he was wanted,  loved,  and accepted for who he was,  but felt be was with someone who was only interested in herself - not in getting to know him.  From her perspective,  it seemed she was a very insecure young woman, who sought constant reassurance from a partner who felt she was all take with little give,  and was constantly testing her to see how far she was willing to be debased before she'd fight back, and they could break throughe the crap,  and get on to  the business of having a relationship - which neither of them has natural skills for.  At first I  really hated this guy,  and hated the girl for sticking around to be a victim.  But that's the reality for done people - the hope is,  they see how crazy the behaviors are,  and not want to  be that person.

I was So bummed when I got to season 2 and realized I'd have pay to watch the following seasons because we don't have HBO.  This is the type of show I'd want my kids to watch if I were worried about their boundaries.  We have 3 kids in that age range or just a bit younger,  and our daughter 'so have more self worth than most of the characters - female anyway.

Yes,  there is some stereotyping -esp of the female characters of  being weak,  not good role models,  not having much sense at all.  I'd like to see them  present these 20 something's as being far more mature.  They represent these girls as fresh out of high school or college And yet they're in their mid-twenties, without much sense,  without good jobs...  or not working at all and yet living in decent places - which just isn't realistic.

The one issue which was dealt with in a really irresponsible way,  although I don't think altogether unrealistic,  was the situation where the one young woman was touched inappropriately at work,  and did nothing about it,  as a matter of fact,  she told her boss he could F@@K her.  I understood that some  women initially would freeze  - it would come as such a shock to be touched in that manner,  but once the shock wears off,  you don't seek  out the opinions of others in the office and let them talk you into putting up with being touched.  You either confront the issue head stay and if it happens again be prepared to get proof if you intend to stay,  and of course if you aren't in fear of your safety.  A boss who's touchy is no excuse for invading someone's personal space.

I like it and would recommend it!  Can't wait for season 2 on Amazon!",1432512000,,4126,4.4535666218035

I don't get how a girl getting naked counts as a premise for an entire show. It is mad boring. It's supposed to be sex in the city for young English majors? I hate that show because it is about as vapid as Cosmo and I'd say Girls is only marginally less vapid. She lives in New York, she mooches off of her parents, and relationships with men are basically unfulfilling. She hangs out in the bathtub and all of her girlfriends are always naked together and sleeping in the same bed while having pillow fights (practically).  I am trying to find the deepness or the hilarity and I am not seeing it BECAUSE IT IS NOT DEEP! I can't like a main character who is too good to work but lives in NYC.  Do Girls really relate to her?

I don't know how this show got so much praise. I don't find it realistic or relatable, and I'm 22. I wasted my money buying the episodes.

In my opinion, the show has too much swearing and it's actually distracting. Also, there are a lot of awkward sex scenes. And I know I sound uptight right now(I feel the need to point out I watch a lot of adult shows like OITNB, American Horror Story, etc.), but seriously it's like the show is trying too hard. I would never recommend Girls to anyone. I'm usually not too critical of shows, but this show is nothing like people say it is. Just a waste of time.

5151756,5,B008CFZQQS,I really enjoyed this show.

5151757,5,B008CFZQQS,"My husband and I do not watch TV very much, we don't have Netflix or cable/satellite and we do not even bother accessing local channels.  Needless to say, we are not up on the latest and greatest television.  After reading about Girls and Lena Dunham in countless magazines and online, we were both a little curious about this show.  I found it here (used) for a good price and decided we would give it a shot, fully expecting to hate it.  We both absolutely loved it and it's become my new favorite show.  It does not get in the way of itself trying to be hip.  It's quirky and honest and a little out-there.  I am probably a bit immature for being in my 30's especially since I'm not having children, but I continually forgot this show was about people much younger than I am.  We get the biggest kick out of the character Adam Sackler, but truly find every character in the show to be interesting and fun to watch.  We blew through Season 1 in two evenings and were straight on to Season 2 (also fantastic).  I am seriously impressed by Girls.",1398902400,,1046,4.345360824742268

5151759,4,B008CFZQQS,"I find this series interesting and amusing because it captures the Me generation of my daughter and her friends like a hidden camera.  The measure of success for this generation is to spend your life doing the one thing you were born to do.  I think Dunham accurately captures the pitfalls of doing that when you don't really have a clear picture of who you are. There has a lot of criticism of her unflattering costumes, nudity and constant assertion that she is just ""15 pounds overweight,"" but I think these things are a non-verbal portrayal of how she doesn't have a clear picture of herself.  When she looks in the mirror, she sees someone other than who we see.  Most of the sometimes hilarious and sometimes heartbreakingly dreadful choices she makes result from this lacking in personal perspective.",1398643200,,807,4.784172661870503
5151760,5,B008CFZQQS,"Great show! I didn't know what to expect or what the theme/direction was but I definitely did NOT expect this.
It isn't comparable to sex in the city or gossip girls. It's definitely it's own show with it's own personality & theme.  It's much more relatable. (At least for me). I also appreciate that it doesn't over glamorize what females should look like, dress or behave.
 It can be bold and vulgar at times but it's honest & I find that refreshing.
I really love the characters.  Each character has their own distinct personality & I find each one extremely like able.
I don't watch much tv but I'm glad I found this one.",1398643200,4,625,4.464912280701754
5151761,5,B008CFZQQS,"My favorite type of shows, especially comedies, is when you cannot guess what is going to happen next. Girls avoids a lot of your typical clich&eacute;s which make it refreshing. Especially for a ""female"" series; there is a sorry lack of smart programming. So many shows/movies are almost insulting. Even though the Girls are meant to make mistakes and when watching sometimes you will think ""What is she doing?"" the characters have complexity which is usually reserved for television's male characters.
Much of this has to do with Lena Dunham, who stars, directs, and created this series. I was very impressed with her talent. Do I think Girls defines my generation? No - but the show definitely offers a different perspective than previously seen and I do find it relatable. It represents the time in your life when you have the education, and maybe even your intelligence has made you successful in school, but now you have to figure out what's next and how to survive in the adult world. The attitude shift in relationships is also interesting - the transition of the casual relationship that was typical in college to navigating serious, mature relationships.
My ""Not for Everyone"" comment is that this show has a quirky humor that you will probably love or hate. You will not see broad, sitcom-like setup humor. For me, I was laughing out loud (hard) through the whole first season. But I also have a weird sense of humor so I am on the same wavelength. Lena's Hannah is for me the most interesting. Lena is brave in that she lets her character do and experience things that aren't the most glamorous. She has flaws, but not in the silly cutesy way where the romcom heroine is just a little klutzy. She seems like one of your real girlfriends. Jemima is a charismatic actress, and her Jessa is a force that is fun to watch. Marnie is a foil for Hannah. She is gorgeous but also has her flaws. For me, Shoshanna is the weakest part of the show, but she is also the least featured so I didn't mind her too much. The up-speaking delivery I find annoying and the character is one-note (at least for this first season). Hannah's sometimes-boyfriend Adam is a gem.",1398038400,,2164,4.667539267015707

5151763,5,B008CFZQQS,"The best thing about Girls is watching how these 20 something people make clearly bad decisions, and being happy to know that you were not that ego-centric or stupid when you were that age.  These girls are filled with drama they create themselves, demonstrate that they do not understand friendships, and make you doubt if they will pull themselves together.  All the while, it is hysterical to watch them screw up their lives. Girls is supposed to be satirical, those that get that will enjoy the show immensely.",1397520000,,514,4.829545454545454

5151771,5,B008CFZQQS,"I assumed that a TV show called GIRLS would be superficial and boring.  I only watched the pilot to confirm my suspicions and move on, but was immediately enthralled.  It's been nearly 40 years since i started college in the midwest, but these situations and conversations ring true for my cohort.  It's selling dunham short to assume that she'll only appeal to her generation.  If you graduated with a liberal arts degree and no specific job skills, if you engaged in college partying and sex, if you hyper analyzed your relationships, you may see yourself in Dunham's characters.  At 28 years old she's already demonstrated her gifts as a director.  Critics who view her story lines as harsh and unromantic might be consoled to consider that, if your adolescent kids are watching, they're seeing sex WITH condoms and hearing down to earth conversations about STDs....and unless you've thoroughly covered those topics already, this subject matter may educate and inform their own decision making.",1395878400,,997,5.085889570552148

5151775,5,B008CFZQQS,Very real. This show really holds up a mirror to modern dating practices. There is no prescribed path for young people anymore which is both exciting and scary as hell.

5151781,5,B008CFZQQS,Love! Love! Love! This series. I first saw it on HBO when it came out. I am hooked!! Can't wait for another season. Lena Dunham is genius!!!,1394928000,,140,4.222222222222222
5151782,3,B008CFZQQS,I watched the first episode in a sampler I got of HBO sows when I purchased a season of a series - Game of Thrones or maybe True Blood.  After hearing about this show for over year and see Lena Dunham praised so much I finally sat down and watched it.  It was a head scratcher - especially the whole Adam thing and even though I was not sure I really liked the show I was intrigued enough to rent the first disc.  After suffering through the next four episodes I  agree with that doctor that you could not pay me to be 24 again.  I would have stopped then but I forgot to take the show off my rental list and on a long weekend I found myself with nothing to watch but the remainder of the series.  Good news: I actually almost like two episodes: Episode 7  Crackcident and Episode 10  She Did  the season finale.  It is interesting that these two episodes feature all the cast at a big event instead of little vignettes with one or two characters.  I also was surprised that Adam (still a little strange and creepy) turned out to be the most interesting thing about the show. I think my biggest problem is the character of Hannah.  Like many reviewers I am having hard time trying to figure out if she is parody or are we supposed to take her serious.  That whole plot line with the Boss was painful to watch on so many levels and frankly I think the actions that the two closest people to her took in the 9th and 10th episodes where the smartest things then did.  But having said all that there is something brave and occasionally appealing about just how brave Lena Dunham is to show herself in such an unappealing manner both emotionally and literally that I do applaud her for that.  Will I watch the second season?  Before watching the finale I would have said no but gosh darn it she did make me a little curious as to where everything was heading and if we might see some growth (finally) in our leading lady's character.,1394841600,,1928,4.2699724517906334
5151783,4,B008CFZQQS,"Lena Dunham could quite possibly be the ""voice of her generation"". A little help from Judd Apatow doesn't hurt either. The story lines are great. The dialogue is witty and interesting without being forced. The boys shine too here - great performances all around. The only thing that keeps me from giving it five stars is that the crying is not terribly convincing. :)",1394582400,,367,4.75

5151787,5,B008CFZQQS,"I never knew they are now on Season Four.  I started watching this last year during Season Three on cable network, and I fell in love with this show.  Very edgy, very creative, and Hannah, the main star is so awesome, she tells it like it is, she is not inhibited in any way, very much a free spirit, and oh so witty!  I was very hesitant to watch this show due to the title ""GIRLS"", I am not one to favor chick flicks, but this show is not only daily trials and tribulations of four very close yet different friends, but also includes their boyfriends, their families, and other exes, so it is not just for the ladies.  I make my boyfriend watch it with me, he says he doesnt like it, but he does (especially due to all the nudity or partial nudity present.....) Can't wait to get caught up with all the seasons!

5151798,1,B008CFZQQS,"I didn't understand he entertainment value here for anyone over about 14 or 15 years old.  I think it might be an educational series for young girls on how and where not to place trust for your emotional and physical needs, the consequences of bad choices, and basic sexual issues like the HPV that was the topic of one of the episodes.  Too much emphasis on a woman sexual escapades, which would typically be one very small aspect of a woman's life, certainly not all consuming as depicted in this series. The girls don't seem to have any goals or direction for their lives, professionally or personally, and seem completely frazzled and lost.",1390867200,2,644,4.6902654867256635

5151804,5,B008CFZQQS,"I heard on someone talk about this show on Ellen the other day and so I realized that the third season was about to start. So, I got into bed and turned on HBO Go on my Xbox. Over the next week, I found myself needed to see the next episode, although the newest episodes are already came out... And I realized I have to wait another week for the next episode...

In this season, you find Hannah needing to find a job as she is writing a memoir about her life. This revolves around four girls, Hannah, Shoshanna, Jessa, and Marnie who all have to deal with their issues together. I'm not going to spoiler everything, but these issues include unexpected pregnancy, break-ups, parental issues, and all other kinds of crazy things.

I bought this DVD package from Best Buy because it was on sale, but I would definitely recommend it to anyone. The first five episodes are on the first DVD and the last five are on the second disc, making up a two-disc season of 10 episodes.

Now, there's a reason why this is on HBO and when I say that, I mean, this is not for the kids. Hell, I'm 16, myself, but this show shouldn't be shown to anyone younger. There's a lot of sex scenes and nudity, so if you're not comfortable with your kids seeing that, then yeah... I couldn't even buy this, I had to have my 17 year-old friend buy it for me and he got carded, so that just tells you something...

Anyway, I would definitely recommend this to anyone. I loved it and you know what would be fun? Get a group of friends over and watch it together. That would be really cool.",1390003200,,1557,4.2677966101694915

That being said, I've watched a few episodes of the show and while it has some cute moments, I'm really uncomfortable seeing so many sex scenes being played out by these young people.

5151836,4,B008CFZQQS,"Lena Dunham is a terrible actress.  She has very little personality, and very flat to watch on screen.  But she's a decent director and a very good writer writing about a trend that has become so pervasive as to be a cliche:  rich white girls in urban centres who are too busy discovering who they are to actually grow up and take responsibility for their lives.

The dialogue in ""Girls"" is very good, but what's even better is its amorality.  The show's protagonist Hannah is both hero and anti-hero, a young women so at odds with herself that she just has no time to bother with anyone else.  If she's not mooching off her parents then she's mooching off her roommate.  And if she's not complaining about her friend with benefits then she's sleeping with him -- and often at the same time.  And if she's not at home loafing around then she's quitting her job.  When her boss rebuffs her sexual advances she accuses him of sexual harassment and threatens to sue, and when her boss laughs and tells her to forget it all she becomes angry at his lack of anger, and quits.

""Girls"" is so good because it's so raw, unforgiving, and often at times so damn amateurish.  But when it's good it can be very good.",1383609600,,1204,4.427272727272728

The chemistry with her boyfriend Adam was a little weird and hard to believe..especially in season 2. The character Jessa was funny and refreshing. The other two main characters - Marnie and Shoshanna were hard to watch..and downright annoying. Overall this show is watchable but I wouldn't say it's amazing. As other reviewers have said, and I agree - it's basically a watered down version of Sex in the City for Generation Y. The acting and comedic timing is no where as solid as the original Sex in the City..but the show is definitely better than some of the other crap on TV today.",1378252800,,757,4.5661764705882355

Coming from a 25 yr old girl who moved from a tiny town to the big city a few years ago after graduating from college, this show is EXTREMELY accurate and relatable. Unlike Sex & the City (which I should note is still one of my absolute favorites) the girls in this show are not glamorized and its not made to look like its easy to start out a life in NYC. Its exactly the kind of humor I love (which I understand isn't for everyone considering some of the previous reviews) and it has just enough drama.

5151894,5,B008CFZQQS,"""Girls: The Complete First Season""
(HBO, 2012)

My wife and I burned through Season One of ""Girls"" in a three-night binge, and we laughed and cringed through Lena Dunham's brilliant and honest portrayal of these flawed but likeable twentysomethings. The painful agonies and sharp learning curves of young adulthood that have rarely been presented as accurately or with as much unflinching honesty as in this series. Dunham's scripts are intelligent and sly, showing attractive, articulate young people making complete messes out of their lives, stumbling through their not-glamorous lives in modern-day New York City, a hard town that seems surprisingly welcoming and warm through the lens of these young and brash characters.

There's a lot to like about this show - most of all it's how Dunham and company present people as they really are - inherently flawed, not easy to read, changing as they grow and have new experiences, appealing despite their shortcomings. The casting is brilliant: like Richard Linklatter (and her patron, Judd Apatow), Dunham gathers together unusual, goofy-looking actors, people who look like people you know, with big ears and crooked noses, body fat and funny faces, as well as young people who actually look like the ages they are supposed to be playing. Like Apatow's ""Freaks And Geeks"" or Linklatter's ""Dazed And Confused,"" this show rings true because it defiantly gives voice to the people we really know and are, rather than a bunch of blow-dried, silicon-boobed thirty year-olds pretending to be teenagers on some generic WB/CW/network soap opera.  And the plot matches the look: the sharp wit and poor judgement these characters display will remind you of your own post-college life, and is particularly good at showing the kind of experiences and relationships that real ""girls"" really have.

Although Dunham gives a nod to ""Sex And The City"" (a show I could never get into), there's clearly a fair amount of pushback and satire intended in the comparison. These aren't oh-so-glamorous, oh-so-outrageous post-feminist stereotypes, these are realistic characters whose dreams and desires are bordered by mundane reality. The graphic, purposefully clumsy sex scenes do have a slightly gratuitous air to them, yet they invariably serve a direct dramatic purpose, adding new layers to the characters involved and their relationships with others. In short: well done. Bring on Season Two! (DJ Joe Sixpack, Slipcue film reviews)",1370563200,2,2464,5.31025641025641

5151919,1,B008CFZQQS,"Here's what I got out of this show:

1. 20 somethings like to have sex - Duh!!

2. There's a whole generation out there that believes EVERYONE should help them achieve the success that they so rightfully deserve - sad but true

3. The thinnest of writing passes for great entertainment/art these days

The main character, Hannah, is completely self-centered and selfish as are all of her friends. They just can't understand why the world doesn't want to help them & give them everything they need (Food, rent, success, etc.) all the while barely lifting a finger to help themselves. Hannah seems to spend very little time on her writing and most of her time having sex and then hanging with her friends to complain how someone else has got it better than her. The show seems to lack any self awareness of either itself or it's characters or even display any irony in the lack there of. Unfortunately the Entitled Generation portrayed in this show does exist and apparently is flourishing. Enabled by parents and sometimes older friends who A) Either buy their BS reasons why they should be unconditionally supported (with money and of course no negative criticism) or B) Desperately want them (as in the parent's case) to love them for their own selfish reasons. The few voices of reason that pop up occasionally are given short shrift by Dunham's writing as though her character's room full of mirrors view of the world (To quote Hendrix ""All I could see was me"") is somehow valid and reasonable. As for me, the last thing I want to see is an episodic love letter to this pathetic generation of delusional cry babies. I would love to root for Hannah and her quest if only she had the slightest shred of self awareness & heart. What tries to pass itself off as self awareness (""I hate myself more than you hate me"") is just another way for Hannah to manipulate and hang onto a benefactor. I really tried to give this show a chance (watched 3 season 1 episodes) with the hope that it would develop into something more but alas it seems not. Maybe a unique real female/woman's voice is out there waiting to be heard. And hopefully will be. But ""Girls"" ain't it.",1366761600,23,2159,4.6

5151937,1,B008CFZQQS,"There are some great female writer/directors out there, Lena Dunham falls closer to the mediocre side of every occasion.

5151938,4,B008CFZQQS,"Girl power is a female preoccupation. It has always been that way. The girls in this show have varying quantities of it, and understanding about its effect on their world. Hanna doesn't have a lot of it on a physical level. There are  lots of camera shots of how lacking she is, but the show explores how Hanna deals with the lack,  the compromises and assumptions that stem from it. Lena Dunham takes the issue on full bore in a way Hollywood, assumed we didn't want to acknowledge. Women read magazines. go to the movies  are usually not interested in dealing with the lack, instead fantasizing the right medication, or the right make over or the right fairy godmother will give us the power to bend men to our will.
At the end of the series Hanna seems to own more of this girl power than she thought, or is she in the end deciding the guy in her life that she put so far above herself and therefore she was powerless in the relationship was actually much weaker than she thought? I'm concentrating on Hanna but the issue plays out for all of the other girls, typically for women it is the preoccupation of their lives.

At one point in the series Hanna goes home to see her parents, they too are put under the Lena Dunham scope, and they fair poorly in those ratings. Seemingly they hold or withhold the purse strings but, Hanna in this at least, can win that contest.

I like this show, but I  can't think men or boys are going to be that interested in it. In all of these types of entertainments, they are the prey. Helplessly they become ensnared and weakly they loose their independence, even their lives to a tractor beam of female power. They have always been made powerless in the fantasy and they usually hate to see it re- enacted. Men in their fantasies usually prefer to see themselves as physically powerful, independent and immortal.",1364428800,,1850,4.474777448071217

Watching this whole season on my day off, affected all my personal relationships. Though its affect is wearing off, I'm reluctant to jump into Season 2, though I know I will.

Hannah and her friends...not very likeable...BUT - I watched a few more episodes and got into the stories.  The writing is good.  The characters immensly flawed, but interesting.  The graphic sexual scenes pretty awkward and uncomfortable, like I'd imagine watching real people have actual sex to be like (at least for me).  One of my favorite scenes is when Hannah tells Elija she got HPV from him and he comes out to her.  Could these people be more awkward and mean to one another?

There are many scenes that are so awkward, they are difficult to watch.  But it's also strangely compelling.  Between episodes, I wonder what these characters are up to.  I recognize a number of these characters as myself at that age or people I knew, but I spend my early 20s living in a big city on the east coast.

While it's not the ""high art"" critical acclaim would have you believe, it's an honest and uneven and interesting show.  It's flaws are what make it interesting.

They seem to have no real emotions except to be clever or taken care of by their rich parents. I hear it was 'risky' but all I saw was a bunch of low stakes plot points-- girls looking to get laid and make a lot of money without doing any work. Sex in the series is a total bore, devoid of sweat and fun. Why bother? Why bother watching this at all?",1363737600,25,523,4.038461538461538

Okay, its true everyone is white, privileged and at least a few continue to receive financial support from their parents while they flounder about. But notice not one character wastes their time. Not all are aspiring artists but, with the exception of the ditzy Shoshanna, all are thinkers. So what I love most is the least obvious to the characters themselves who are busy living: despite the ups and downs and frightening uncertainties of young adulthood, what other version of heaven could be more exciting?",1363651200,,783,5.030769230769231

5151951,5,B008CFZQQS,"Having heard much critical acclaim for this new HBO series, supposedly combining elements of ""Friends"" and ""Sex and the City,"" yet not having cable, I was most anxious to see it when it entered syndication. But when I saw the complete first season available on a reasonably priced DVD set, I said, ""Why wait?"" When it arrived, we - my wife and I - somehow found time to watch an episode a day until we'd seen them all; early on, it became a daily ritual we both looked forward to, so much so we've wanted to see all the extra features (we've only worked our way through a few of them yet) and, if we can find the time, watch the episodes again. That alone speaks volumes because we rarely watch anything twice. It is gritty, funny, poignant, touching, and - above all - highly entertaining. One thing emerged in the first episode: the show takes full advantage of what they can show (and say) on cable that they can't show (or say) on broadcast TV. Yet the dominant theme that lingers in your mind is one of pathos and not profanity or porn. Exceptionally well conceived, executed, and put together, it is, indeed, a real micro-capsule of a slice of one portion of life, while we're all feeling our way, learning, making mistakes, and hoping, through it all, that we're managing to learn and grow.

It was only after, to my surprise, watching the two main characters get it on jailhouse nazi style in the opening minutes of the episode I selected to watch that i decided, nah, if I wanted to watch porn and boyfriends masturbating over the supine bodies of their f--buddies as they choked them and said they only had permission to cum if they asked for it that I decided, hey- if I wanna watch porn, at least I know what I'm getting. Not that I watch porn. But the person I know says the rest of the show is pretty good. I never stuck around to find out.",1362614400,2,687,4.021897810218978
5151969,3,B008CFZQQS,"It's good, not great. The show is good enough to suck you in and make you want to show another, but after the season is over you wonder why you watched the whole thing.",1362441600,4,168,3.9705882352941178
5151970,3,B008CFZQQS,"The show itself is awesome - the plotting is thick, the dialogue solid. But there are few outstanding issues that must be addressed. Number 1 - why no blonde villains? The absence of blonde haired, blue eyed villains was quite disturbing to me as an Israeli citizen, if in future seasons one cannot be found by Hollywood execs (they usually seem to be able to) then a teen, perhaps with a penchant for non-consensual intercourse, would suffice. The second quibble is - why is there no sassy Afro-American friend - the streetwise straight talker, raised on the mean streets of Brooklyn, underprivileged but in possession of great intellectual potential - this kind of portrayal is conspicuously absent in television and film. Clearly every Jewish (or half chosen) liberal Obama voter, living in an expensive neighborhood with low crime would constantly be surrounded by colored companions of quality, so why aren't they included in this show? Women are portrayed as rational and hard-working - Hannah, a 25 year old English major, only asks her parents for assistance half a dozen times - displaying great personal responsibility, the other characters are likewise dedicated to their travails - forging a new America with their efforts, be it through part-time unpaid internship, babysitting children or answering phones at a gallery. Other characters only infrequently talk about their sex lives or other banal topics - their conversations are weighty and philosophical. Your shekels will be well spent on his DVD.",1362441600,11,1514,5.183673469387755
5151971,5,B008CFZQQS,"Heard about this show on the radio and I was having withdraws from Dexter. I thought I would
give it a try and I absolutely love it, the writer Lena Dunham is so witty. 2 thumbs up!!!!",1362441600,,184,4.0
5151972,5,B008CFZQQS,"I avoided watching this show for sometime.  My girlfriend is a big fan, and I assumed it wouldn't appeal to a male viewer.  I was surprised when I gave it a shot and found it laugh out-loud funny, and not to mention, an accurate description of life in Brooklyn.  I've met people like all of the cast members during my 8 trips to Williamsburg in the past year.",1362355200,,359,4.25
5151973,2,B008CFZQQS,"I bought this as a result of all the hype surrounding this show, and was completely disappointed.  I forced myself to finish it out, thinking surely it would get better/more interesting as the episodes went on, but no such luck.  I am a huge fan of Lena Dunham & loved her film Tiny Furniture, so I thought this would be in the same vein. As much I love Lena, I've got no love for this show.",1362355200,16,391,4.131578947368421
5151974,5,B008CFZQQS,I was hooked on the first episode. I am the same age as the charachters in this coming of age story about 4 friends in New York City. It sounds a lot like it will play out like Sex and the City but it is so much more realistic than that. I'm able to relate to the characters like I never have before in a tv series. Its somewhat hilarious and somewhat embarrassing how many of the situations these girls have been in that I have been in myself.,1362355200,,444,4.0
5151975,3,B008CFZQQS,I've heard so much about this show and it's won so many awards that I was hoping this would be a great show. The pilot was okay at best. I will try another few episodes in case it takes a while for it to hit its stride.,1362355200,,219,3.6808510638297873
5151976,3,B008CFZQQS,"This show requires some patience, as it took the whole first season for the characters to develop some depth and some heart.

Hannah is the struggling writer with weight and self-esteem issues.  Marnie is the ""uptight"" one who is perfectly put together but questioning her relationship with her sweet college boyfriend.  Jessa is that friend everyone seems to have in their twenties, who seems cool and confident and lives a wild, unconventional life.  Shoshanna is the perky college student who thinks her life is supposed to resemble Sex and the City - she panics about the fact that she hasn't had sex yet.

It's possible to find actress/writer/director Lena Dunham inherently likeable, but find her character Hannah frustrating.  One of the more interesting themes is how Hannah's insecurities actually make her judgmental and oblivious to others' feelings.  She also sabotages herself quite a bit.  When you realize the show understands this about her, and it isn't trying to excuse or garner sympathy for her - well, she's easier to take.

The acting and dialogue are quite good, although the more extreme language and weird sex scenes seem gimmicky and unnecessary to me.  This show will entertain you if you can find humor in the dingy apartments, career malaise, weird relationships and general dysfunction of being a twentysomething in today's world of texting and extended adolescence.  Not to say that all, or even most twentysomethings act like these characters.  But I think it likely highlights (in an extreme and funny way) the challenges of being that age.

However, if you don't enjoy self-involved characters or crude humor, this show isn't for you.  If you didn't like Sex and the City, you will probably hate this - Girls is a similar show, with less money, dirtier language, weirder sex and the main characters making even worse decisions.",1362268800,,1861,5.059016393442623
5151977,5,B008CFZQQS,"HAHAHA!  Watch this by yourself and indulge in the fantasy world that is ""Girls"".  Nobody lives like this in NYC, but I don't care.  Looking forward to season 2",1362268800,,160,4.448275862068965
5151978,4,B008CFZQQS,"So - I was really surprised when I heard people were comparing this to Sex and the City. I have to admit I did like Sex in the City but in a guilty pleasure kind of way.  The show was brilliant and entertaining but I did not feel like I was watching a show that really said much and it was certainly a complete estrogen fest.
I was not sure how I felt about Girls when I first saw it - there are scenes that are mildly disturbing and at times mildly depressing.  But I found myself sucked in and watched episode after episode until the end realizing I was totally hooked.
The premise of the show is following the tough time between college and adulthood - the dreaded phase of finding yourself - for a group of girls in New York City.  I never lived in New York but I am not far removed from this struggle to find out who you are and your place in the world after going through the obvious laid out steps of school and college.  I think this show has a lot to say and says it well.  It is relatable and interesting.  It does have its dark moments and can be on the depressing side but I think they created something great here.",1362268800,,1127,4.076923076923077
5151979,2,B008CFZQQS,"This series got a lot of publicity because of the Emmys, so I thought I'd give it a try.  I really enjoyed the first scene, where the main character is trying to talk her parents into continuing to pay her expenses while she is an unpaid intern, but it went downhill after that.  It wasn't because it's pretty crude; I watch plenty of HBO shows along the same lines, but I didn't find it to be funny.  After two episodes, I was done, and I was mad at myself for purchasing the entire season when I should have only invested in it episode by episode.  There's not a lot of shows that I download that I don't end up watching the entire season of, this was one of them.",1362182400,3,666,4.1395348837209305
5151980,4,B008CFZQQS,"I'm a woman in my mid forties and I really like the show. I love the absurdist humor, weird character studies and clever writing. The  strong sexual content was a bit surprising at first, but it's mostly hilarious and I'm cool with it. When I watch the show I may occasionally cringe, but mostly I just laugh hard, think ""I wish I had said/thought/wrote that"", and appreciate the talented actors who weave in and out of the stories. As a comedy nerd, I recognize many great guests who are excellent improvisers; such as Donald Glover, Jon Glaser, Jenny Slate, Bobby Moynihan...well, there are many. The soundtrack is good, too. I can see that it really pushes people's buttons and you can't take a lukewarm position about it apparently, it's so visceral. I would just suggest giving it a try and if you don't like it then don't watch it. Simple. No need to rant and even more ridiculously compare it to real life. It's not meant to be taken so seriously, but it is meant to entertain and possibly to make you feel something. And judging by the reviews, it seems to be working.",1362096000,,1076,4.546391752577319
5151981,5,B008CFZQQS,"Highly recommend this show if you want to laugh out loud. The characters are great, the acting flows and they really represent a generation that is struggling to find its identity while trying to get a stable job in this crappy economy.",1362009600,,236,4.642857142857143

5151984,5,B008CFZQQS,I was surprised by how much I enjoyed watching GIRLS.  Lena Dunham's writing is spot-on; her understanding of what it means to be a 20-something living in the city couldn't be funnier or more accurate.  Well worth watching.,1361923200,,223,4.842105263157895

5151988,5,B008CFZQQS,"Girls is amazing, hands down. Don't compare it to Sex and the City because though they may be able four girls in NYC, they are very different. Lena Dunham is a very talented writer and director, and her characters are both relateable and hateable at the same time. Each one can be seen as one whole girl together, as each one has a part of them that comes out in a woman's life, but they work perfectly as single characters with awesome antics and awkward sex scenes mixed in.",1361491200,,476,4.359550561797753
5151989,1,B008CFZQQS,"Thought it is a great show.

After watching the 1st episode, I changed my mind.

It is rather boring with lots of small talks and sex scenes.

Some spoilers:

The dull chubby girl keeps talking throughout the first episode.

Very poor acting, just cannot stop talking through work, life, meal, sex....

At the end of this episode, she oded herself and finally closed her mouth.

The other girls also love chatting.  It appears that the functioning bathroom is a nice place for a good catch up chat.",1361404800,4,498,4.64367816091954

I tried to get through the first disk in hopes that it would improve and when it did not I mailed it to our daughter. But then I felt like I was sending pornography through the mail. At 69 years of age I found this film totally degrading of females and hated the message it sends to young women. Then I asked what my 37 year old daughter thought of it. She too did not get too far into it before she turned it off in disgust. I think the best idea for this movie would be to destroy it rather than subjecting another viewer to this low class idea of entertainment.

I was expecting a younger version of Sex in the City, but this seemed raunchier and with the sole intent to push all social buttons.

5152002,3,B008CFZQQS,"Some of the writing is brilliant, and there are some clever plot themes. But, depending on your view or reaction, some of the scenes are painfully realistic (and some are over the top ridiculous), and the nudity and blunt, graphic language make me uncomfortable at times. I was a huge Sex and the City fan, but they played most of the sex and blunt language for laughs very effectively. This feels more real (and also depicts much younger women - early 20's), and actually much more like softcore porn at times. It is strangely addicting, though, so perhaps that's my final word. I must say that the Hannah character's nudity may have positive affects for women and their self images though. She does not have a typical Hollywood hard body, is a bit plump, etc. It's about time that more mainstream women's bodies are portrayed on film and tv. I do not think the show is appropriate for teenagers. I'd say it's definitely for the college-age crowd and over.",1360713600,,957,4.668639053254438

""Sex and the City"", come back, all is forgiven - I mean, the men in that series were more gorgeous than the womyn. And I'm a straight male, OK?

I had heard so much about the show from awards, news, etc. that I don't think it would have been possible to live up to it.

I think this show is dark and funny, as two side of the same coin. It's really awesome to see the main character be so far from the typical cute girl - and for her to put herself in such compromising positions. A lot of girls really do this, it's just not so obviously self-sabotaging as it is here.

5152029,1,B008CFZQQS,"From the positive reviews I thought there was some hope for this program. Unfortunately there seems to be no morals or positive personality traits in any of the main characters. If this is what the new generation (I admit I am old now) believes and stands for I am very disappointed. From the episodes I have seen not one characters has earned any empathy or sympathy. Every character is self-centered and very unlikable. They all back-stab and bitch about the people that are supposed to be their best friends. No emotional support, no morals and no thought for anyone but themselves. Overall a very poor display of humanity. Too bad this is type of program that earns awards. I feel very sorry for the writer and creator. She must have had a very sad and painful life to create such heartless and unfeeling characters. None of her so called friends are really friends. If this is an accurate portrayal of the way real people in the US now view their friends it paints a very dark and painful picture. Doesn't give much hope for the future. I just hope this Hollywood lack of morals and caring for your fellow man really doesn't influence the younger generation. Overall a very sad view of how uncaring and self absorbed people can be. Still not sure if this program is trying to be a parody of life or if it is just plain sad. If it is trying to be funny it fails miserably. It is a very visual depiction of very shallow and self-centered people making very stupid life choices. They all then seem to try to cover their own mistakes by insulting and belittling their friends behind their backs when they can't defend themselves. Always a very Hollywood practice but hopefully not a habit the youth of the US have adapted.",1359158400,14,1723,4.561290322580645

Are the actors just inexperienced, is this just the characters persona or the person portraying really this weird? But i find the awkwardness extremely funny and relatable. I don't see any issues about the true light of life in this show. To me, its like any show that has a plot, i could care less if there's a gay guy, a black dude, a fat girl or pretty girl. I think considering its pretty much an independent drama, to be on HBO says a lot. Ever since episode one, i had to keep watching. It may seem like a flat show, but you have to give it a chance and see the whole picture. i hope it goes very far.",1359158400,,738,3.9932432432432434

The same people would fault 1984 for not showing a more balanced view of totalitarianism. The show is not supposed to be edifying or heroic. It is hysterical because it shows us glimpses of foibles up close that we've never consciously considered but that we recognize instantly. There is no glorification here of anybody. To seek role models out of this show is to completely miss the point. If you enjoy it for what it is - and are under 40, I suppose - you'll love this show.",1359072000,2,611,4.614678899082569

The depiction of modern educated women as so paralyzed in their lives is a trend that I would like to see reversed.
I know many young women who are sure footed and secure about their identity, sexuality and future.  What is depicted
here is anti feminist and silly not funny. At times some of the action is alarming making me think that young women are
being objectified in ways that are dangerous because they are going to injure their sense of self and they seem to be
aware and unaware of what is happening to them.  Men are still in control although also depicted as dumb.",1358985600,5,698,4.320610687022901

Once again Hollywood shows us how to be self-centered, engage in ridiculous sexual situations, and promote permissiveness and unrealistic lifestyles in today's society.  Bad stuff. By the way, I have raised 4 daughters and they have never acted like these girls do.  Not even close.  This show is much like the Emperor's New Clothes story, there is really nothing there but because Hollywood has to embrace anything that is out of the norm, it is getting lots of attention.

My daughter urged me to watch with her, and I was reluctant, but it turns out she was correct.  There is a lot of nudity, and a lot of sex - a lot of very unromantic sex, in my opinion. Not only is it unromantic, but in many cases it just looked like not very much fun.  Having coming of age in the ""peace and love"" era, this bothers me.  Why are they having so much sex, if they're not seeming to enjoy it?  Haven't we learned anything?

As an older mom,  who moved to NYC in the late '70s when I was 18,  I am somewhat abashed to find I recognize aspects of many of the characters and situations.  The story line revolves around a group of 4 friends who are new to adulthhood in the big city.  Yes,  it is often raunchy & cringe-worthy,  and the characters are sometimes unlikeable... but,  BE HONEST, weren't there times when you were their age that you were totally self involved & found yourself in situations (sexual & otherwise) that induce a mental and spiritual shudder now (now that you are grown up,  that is).  Hopefully, people evolve... but the process is often messy & painful.  I would like to especially note the nuanced & intriguing performance of Adam Driver as Hannah's booty call/boyfriend.  Breakout performance...his character is weird, animalistic, sad, intuitive, raw, truthful, & cruel...ALL AT THE SAME TIME.  I watch to see where he goes with this character as the layers peel away.

This ideal that 20 somethings have that their parents are supposed to support them until they are making bank is just crazy.  Then the scene where she visits with her guy and they have sex on the couch- soooo depressing!  Not in a funny way, either.

* No, it does not represent real life in many facets. No, no one can live in anything halfway decent in New York without a job. So, the alleged assertion by the show's creator that it reflects ""girls"" of today is wrong on this count. BUT this is a TV show, folks. It's not real.

* What it does reflect is all the angst, insecurity, and mixed emotions of life in your early 20s. The show NAILS THIS completely.

* No, there is not diversity on the show. Sad, but true.

* Yes, the characters are not particularly endearing in the beginning, but SOME of then grow on you. They ARE very flawed... which I like.

* I LOVE the unrehearsed feel of the show. The actors' lines run over each other... and they talk in a way with their volume, tone, and mannerisms that's so genuine and practically unheard of on other shows.

* This is a dirty show for adults. No way around it. If you are easily offended, do not watch.

5152094,2,B008CFZQQS,"I've always approached shows on cable networks with a sense of caution. For some reason it seems that most of the critics in the world fall all over themselves to discuss how wonderful each and every program on cable networks like HBO and SHOWTIME are cutting edge and worth watching. For the most part the one thing these shows have in common that is missing from network shows is the inclusion of sex and nudity. When the cable networks started original programming that seemed to be their biggest concern. Unfortunately that hasn't changed all that much.

I've never understood why that was all it took to make a show a hit. Surely this world is not so shallow that a few naked bodies are all it takes to make a hit series? Then again look at the offerings we've had. THE SOPRANOS, BOARDWALK EMPIRE, DEADWOOD and more have all offered some great story telling but at the same time felt the need to go after that base person tuning in by offering enough T&A to keep them watching. Would the shows have been as good if they didn't include it? I think so. It's too bad that these networks don't want to take the chance to find out. Which brings us to GIRLS.

Critically praised and already garnering Emmy nominations, GIRLS is the story of Hannah Horvath (Lena Dunham, the shows creator/writer/sometime director), a woman in her early 20s out of college for 2 years whose parents in the opening of the series tell her that they've decided to cut her off. They will no longer pay her bills while she finds out what it is in life she wants. Instead they expect her to get a job like everyone else. Of course Hannah doesn't take this well and blames them for all of her problems expecting them to finance her until she decides what to do or until she gets her book of essays published. Their response? Too bad, get that job.

The series, while focusing on Hannah, includes her three best friends as well. Marnie (Allison Williams) is Hannah's best friend and roommate. Her long time boyfriend also spends most of his time there and is oblivious to the fact that Marnie isn't quite so sure she wants to stay with him. He adores her, dotes on her, does everything he can for her and yet she feels there is something missing. Marnie works at an art gallery, something you would think nearly everyone living in New York does since most New York set shows have at least one person with this job description.

Shoshanna (Zosia Mamet) is a friend to both girls. What she does exactly I wasn't quite sure, but it's enough that she can pay rent and live fairly well. As the series begins she's something the rest of her friends are not which is a virgin. Shoshanna isn't sexually active which the rest of these girls are almost all the time.

Lastly we come to Jessa (Jemima Kirke), the free spirit who roams the world where ever she wants to go without a care in the world. Jessa is the Bohemian of the bunch, not caring what anyone thinks of her or her lifestyle. Jessa smokes even though she thinks she's pregnant, considers an abortion without thinking about it and dresses in outfits that only someone on either coast would find normal.

So what do these girls talk about, what predicaments do they find themselves in? First off they need to work. Hannah has the most problem finding a job. It seems she lacks the skills necessary to find employment in the big apple. Even Jessa finds a job baby sitting two young girls.

The other big focus in their lives seems to be sex. One would think in an enlightened world where the sexual revolution changed the way women were observed that they would hold the upper hand at all times. Instead these women crave sex and constantly seek it out. The bad thing is that in all their choices for partners only one seems to actually care about the other and he's the one who could get dumped any moment. Men in this series rarely care about the women they have sex with and act as if it's just something to be expected. It shows a lot of what the writers of this show think about men. Then again what does it say about women when their only interest in men is sex?

A huge number of reviews for this show have compared it to SEX AND THE CITY because of the fact that there are 4 friends who live in New York and who seem interested in sex. That's about the only way they compare. Where as SEX AND THE CITY displayed successful career women living out the fantasy lives that seemed prevalent at the time, GIRLS offers the grittier side of the same coin, showing a world where women struggle to make rent and instead of wealthy, handsome men find themselves in bed with whoever can make it there. Not meant as an insult but the women in this series are also more realistic than in SATC. No glamour girls here but rather women that you see every day.

I've noticed another common comment in nearly every review written about this series. The word ""quirky"" comes up in almost every one I've read. I guess the easiest way to gather an audience is to do something ""quirky"" and off the wall and you can stick critics into your back pocket. Then again perhaps ""quirky"" is a lazy way for writers to appear to be in touch with their subject matter and not appear to be unhip.

So with all that said do I really hate this series? Actually not quite. I mean it does seem more interested in playing to two simple crowds: those who watch for the vicarious thrill of seeing people having sex on TV and those who think they are so hip and in the know that this series reflects the lives of most everyone living in New York. I belong to neither group so the series isn't a must see on my radar. Occasionally it did offer a few laughs but those were few and far between. It also showed some heart in the fears and struggles of these characters, one scene in particular after Hannah has quit a job and found her ""boyfriend"" took her seriously when she said she wanted to break up. But this is not a show that I would set a DVR to record or rush home to watch an episode of.

It is nice to see the world as seen through real life eyes rather than the rose colored glasses everyone wants to use when depicting life in New York, lives filled with glamour and paparazzi everywhere rather than the low rent apartments and pasty white boyfriends. For people who love shows that reflect a more realistic approach to the world you'll probably enjoy this series. I tend to watch shows that give me the opportunity to get away from that world rather than roll around in it. I think most of us have enough problems in our day to day lives that we don't quite find someone else going through problems as entertainment. But as long as you know what you're going into before watching that first episode, perhaps you'll find this one you'll like but then again maybe not.",1357776000,3,6766,4.400479616306955

5152120,3,B008CFZQQS,"I'm a 27 years old (28 in 3 weeks) African-American male. I'm obviously not the target demographic of the show. However, for some reason, I like these girly shows (and before you ask, I'm straight). I was a fan of Gossip Girl until it became stupid towards the end. Initially, I wasn't planning on watching this series, but I saw about a million advertisements for Girls in the NYC Subway. I finally decided to succumb to peer pressure. I bought the season 1 DVD from Target and watched the entire season in 3 days.

I can definitely see why some people dislike this show, but most of the episodes are entertaining. Watching this show requires some suspension of disbelief. The protagonist of the series is Hannah, a self-conscious and slightly overweight (but definitely not fat) girl in her mid-20's. Although she is book smart, she is completely dense. She once made a joke about date rape during a job interview. She quit another job she had after her ~60 year old boss refused to have sex with her. She reminds me of a female version of George Constanza. Hannah's frenemy is Marnie (sp?), an attractive but insecure girl. Hannah and Marnie have their cat fights and usually make up in the next episode.

Jessa is a hot British girl. She's an eccentric, pot-smoking party girl, like a raunchier Phoebe Buffay. Shoshanna (sp?) is the innocent virgin (SPOILER: she loses her virginity in the season finale).

What I didn't like about this series is that all of the male characters are douches. Adam, Hannah's borderline abusive boyfriend, is the dumb jock type. He rarely has a shirt on. He reminds me of Kelso from That 70's Show. Elijah is a recurring guest star. He's Hannah's ex-boyfriend who turned gay. He is the gay stereotype. Charlie is Marnie's boyfriend. They split up and 2 weeks later, he met someone else. Jessa got hit on by the father of the kids she babysits.

This show is a caricature of life in New York City. I don't think it's meant for people to take seriously. No one can be as dense as Hannah. Furthermore, in real life, I find it hard to believe that a guy like Adam would be attracted to an average looking girl like Hannah. The funniest episode of the series was when they went to the party in Bushwick. The show started off realistic- Hannah had to survive in the city after being cut off by her parents. Then, the show became less realistic as it progressed. SPOILER: in the season finale, Jessa marries a guy she knew for 2 weeks.

There isn't a single character who I like. I found myself laughing AT Hannah instead of cheering for her. Nevertheless, the show is funny. Many people have complained about the lack of minorities on the show. I don't have an issue with this. There are blacks and Asians on the show, but they appear mostly as extras. In New York City, there are all-white cliques, but that doesn't necessarily mean that they're racist or exclude minorities. I'd rather the show reflect reality than to have a token black character (Donald Glover is going to appear in season 2).",1356998400,110,3026,4.606679035250464

I think he was the quirky yuppie from Newhart and his part was very disappointing. It was like watching a train wreck, except it wasn't a train wreck. It was like watching an empty train track with no landscape and a girl would say and do some pretty disgusting, yet boring things, and you would be so glad that you didn't pay 19.99 to be there, and you would drive away.

5152139,5,B008CFZQQS,"A Quick Retort to the Haters:

As a film-maker and a 20 something male, there is little to criticize about this show. Though many have indeed taken a stab at it, their indignation is usually directed toward the ontology of the characters in the show. Many of these critics shout their contempt for the ""rich white girl"" status of the characters, yet forget to define their concept of wealth or what it means to be spoiled. These individuals compare their own existential existence to those of fictional characters. Which only proves one thing, and this is that Girls is pretty damn good. Because if you pull away the girls wealth, race and location your still left with 4 crazy girls. Not women, girls. And that is truly why the show is so dang good. Because being in your early 20s is a ride of pure narcissism and ignorance. It's a time of mistakes and growth, denial and pride. And this show illustrates that so incredibly well.

 Why You Should Watch Girls:

Prior to my rant above, I wanted to discuss why the show is worth buying, renting, or pirating. Like I said above, the show show is what its like to be in your 20s. Though the philosophy or experience might not include everyones ideology, I find it to have many truths. People in their 20s are selfish, ignorante and prideful. Sex, friendship and perennial relationshops are consistently defined and redefined. Such realizations we hold dear and ultimately true, only to be tweaked a year or so later. Girls illustrates this nature of man. The writing and cinematography is reminiscent of older Woody Allen films, yet done through the eyes of a women. Lena does this not through a radicle feminist agenda, but from an hernest and humain place. Both sexes are equal, and its about damn time. So pick it up and watch. If you don't like it give it to a young girl. After all the show is called girls, because thats what many 20 somethings are, children.",1354838400,4,1913,4.617647058823529

5152141,1,B008CFZQQS,"Have I gone crazy watching this show? I would have to admit that it seems to have affected my sanity.  I absolutely loathe this series.  If you want to watch stories about rich whiny white girls deal with obstacles such as working for a living then this is your show.  I watched the pilot and it actually felt painful to get through the whole thing.  Some people love it, but then it only has an HBO sized audience which is tiny in comparison to a show on Network television.  Girls is definitely a love it or hate it show.  Since I have lived, worked and supported myself in New York City for the past 11 years, and I worked my way through college I simply cannot relate to these four annoying cliches - The exotic foreigner, the hyper idealistic girl from Long Island, the pretty girl, and the self-deprecating nerd.  The show also takes place in Brooklyn, where white people happen to be the minority only taking up about 30% of the population, yet in Dunham's universe anyone important is white.  It is Sex in the City minus the campy fun and designer labels.  If you are over 25 I wouldn't bother, you will simply lose your mind watching this drivel.",1354492800,33,1155,4.436018957345971

I am not an avid watcher of Sex and the City, but needed something to keep me entertained over the winter holiday. This plots of this show are pretty much the cliche of what I keep hearing about millennials, or that generation with the title of millennial. It's not a bad show, but maybe the ideas are a little overplayed. I was able to binge-watch two seasons before the WiFi died and will definitely check out the other three when I am in an area of the world where Internet isn't blocked, so I find the show worth the watch. While the girls in the show don't really stand out all that much, I did like the male characters. They kind of made the girls a little more tolerable.",1519862400,,785,4.3108108108108105
