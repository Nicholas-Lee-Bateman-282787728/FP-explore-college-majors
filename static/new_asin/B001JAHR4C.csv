3654199,5,B001JAHR4C,"Mod Squad (1968-1973) is a great and timeless show.  The issues that this show depicted is still going on today, ""war,drugs, etc.""  I hope that someday, Paramount will realize this and release the remaining seasons.",1321142400,3,215,5.114285714285714
3654200,5,B001JAHR4C,I agree with all of the others.  I recently purchased The Mod Squad Seasons 1 and 2 and would love to get Seasons 3 through 5.

3654202,5,B001JAHR4C,"I agree with all that have written in.  Where is Season 3?  Can anyone at Amazon ask the question with the appropriate Distributor?  Apparently there is a demand; we are not going away without an explanation.  As a courtesy, please look into this matter for your customers.",1309824000,4,273,4.74468085106383
3654203,1,B001JAHR4C,"I CONTACTED, PARAMOUNT,/ C.B.S. ABOUT THE NEW RELEASE DATE, FOR ''THE MOD SQUAD'' SEASON 3, AND WAS TOLD THERE ARE NO PLANS IN THE WORKS FOR SEASON 3, OR ANY OF THE REST OF THE SERIE TOO BE RELEASE IN THE NEAR FURTHER. AND WAS TOLD THAT THEY LOST MONEY ON BOTH SEASON's,ONE AND SEASON TWO, WHICH I FAIL TO BELIEVE, BECAUSE, EACH HALF OF A SEASON THAT THEY PUT OUT, CAME OUT EVRY SIX MONTHS, AND TO PROVE THAT, JUST LOOK UP THE RELEASE DATE, THAT IS STATED WHEN EACH INSTALLMENT OF THE SERIE WAS RELEASED. SO THERE WILL NOT BE ANYMORE SEASON, RELEASED ON DVD, AND FINALLY WAS TOLD THAT ''AMAZON.COM'' WAS THEN GOING TO PUT THE REST OF THE SERIE ON DVD ? IS THAT TRUE ?

3654204,3,B001JAHR4C,"CBS is terrible about releasing these series and I have tried to get a response from them to no avail. As fans we have all expressed our displeasure with CBS for many slow releases such as Perry Mason, Mannix and others but with Mod Squad it seems like they have totally discontinued any releases what so ever!
If anyone knows of a way we can get through to CBS Entertainment, please post it here so that we can all let them know how unhappy we are with them.",1308268800,7,459,4.2272727272727275
3654205,5,B001JAHR4C,"Season 3 hasn't been released in the time that the ENTIRE show, ALL FIVE SEASONS, should've been released on dvd. I read Michael Cole said this was Aaron Spellings' favourite show just before the much belated release of the first dvds came out. I also read from Peggy Liptons' memoir that Spelling didn't produce the later seasons. Maybe this is the reason, maybe not. I'm trying to make up a reason because it's so frustrating not having any reasons.",1296086400,9,451,4.7215189873417724
3654206,1,B001JAHR4C,"Have been waiting for over two years for Season 3, and I don't understand why it's not out. It's not fair to tease us with the first two seasons and then leave us hanging.",1296000000,10,171,4.0588235294117645
3654207,5,B001JAHR4C,"Enough already...It's been almost two years....When is the Mod Squad season three finally going to be released ?

3654347,4,B001JAHR4C,The quality on this DVD is much better than the other two. You can actually watch it without the disc skipping. There still is a slight skip on one of the shows. I didn't return it because of the other ones. Read the other reviews,1390435200,,230,4.133333333333334

Ive read that these were not remastered,so I had my doubts, but these will be a great addition to collectors wanting to fill out the run. Plan to get season 4 and 5 soon.",1386460800,2,295,4.103448275862069

3654395,3,B001JAHR4C,"Fans of the show, this is what you have been waiting for-although not as you would expect. CBS failed to re-master and release the remaining three seasons and have farmed this out to VEI.  No blame lies with VEI, but CBS should be damned for not completing what they started. Do not expect Re-Mastered episodes, in fact these are complete with anomalies, scratches and graininess at times. This is CBS's fault not VEI's. So why after this many years CBS did you wait to release these and give it your less than earnest efforts. Nevertheless, it is good to finally complete the collection I started and that CBS abruptly halted for no known reason. Warner Bros. has MOD or Manufactured On Demand to offer and is releasing volumes more TV content than CBS has offered in the last decade. They even offer Warner Instant and stream vintage TV and Movies from their own on-line service. So why CBS have you not stepped up to the plate and served your customer base?  Get on board or stay bush-league the choice is yours. Fans, don't let these issues stop you completing your collection--just remember who places YOU on a pedestal!",1380067200,6,1125,4.6767676767676765
3654396,5,B001JAHR4C,"Kudos to VEI for finally resurrecting THE MOD SQUAD on DVD. After two seasons/four volumes were released in 2007-2009, CBS abandoned this iconic psychadelic relic and left us hanging with some of the best MOD moments yet to come.

While the picture quality isn't as stellar here as it was on the CBS releases, the show has never looked this good on television before despite the presence of minor dirt and debris here and there. They even included the original opening bumpers ""The Mod Squad: In Color"", so purists will be delighted.

My only complaint is that the actual cover art is different from what is shown here on Amazon--and it isn't as nice IMO and looks rather low-res compared to the CBS releases. But who am I kidding? I'd buy this in a plain brown wrapper because the shows are what I want! Thank you VEI!",1379721600,4,819,4.5646258503401365
3654397,5,B001JAHR4C,"Is there a current update on whether or not season three, four and five are ever going to be released? If nothing else why can't they make the rest of the seasons a Burn On Demand type of situation like they did with The Man From Atlantis TV series. Some other TV shows they have been made availiable by Burn On Demand as well.  Right now, I'll settle for this although it's not my first choice.  The Mod Squad is one of the greatest TV shows ever and it deserves better than this. How about giving the fans of this show what we want!",1345161600,2,534,4.125
3654398,5,B001JAHR4C,"Enough already.  How many frigging times are we going to be stuck with partial series?  I am getting so sick of this.  If they wonder why sales will be bad for a new release, it's because we're all terrified of being saddled with one more show that isn't complete.  So far, I have the following incomplete shows (that I can remember off the top of my head)

Mod Squad
Once and Again
Third Watch
Early Edition
Night Court
Outer Limits (80's version)

And these are just the ones I can remember without looking at my shelves.  I'm sure many of you have the same sort of unfinished collection.  It's SOOOOOOOOOOOO frustrating.

Studios complain about bootlegs.  If they would actually release the products, we would buy them.",1344297600,2,722,4.658730158730159
8312416,5,B001JAHR4C,Just as described,1503619200,,17,5.0
8312417,4,B001JAHR4C,Great show.  Some discs didn't play in one DVD player but played in another; one only played in the computer.,1490227200,,109,4.45
8312418,3,B001JAHR4C,"Initially, I was having a lot of issues with pixelating and chapter skips on multiple episodes on every disc I checked.  I got a replacement set and same thing.  Some episodes would play fine all the way through but about 3/5 would not.  Well I read another review on here that said these discs won't play properly on older DVD players because of the way VEI encoded them.  I decided to buy a new Bluray player to use in conjunction with my 10+ year old DVD/VHS combo unit and voila, it works and the picture quality looks great!  The picture looks pretty well the same as what was originally released by Paramount/CBS years ago.  Now that I can play them, I'm happy, I knocked off a star because I had to go to the trouble and expense of getting a new player, but at least I can watch these now.  I also have Seasons 4 and 5 of this series as well as Seasons 2-6 of McMillan and Wife and Seasons 4-8 plus the movie collection of Diagnosis Murder from VEI so those would probably of had the same issue on my older player too.  UPDATE: I did experience 1 more defective episode even playing them on the Bluray player.  I got a second replacement set and the replacement disc from that set worked.  I am concerned that defective discs may be pretty widespread with VEI and some of the releases I have are going OOP and I haven't had the chance to watch them yet.  I have a pretty large collection and I only watch about 1 Season per month and I like to switch up the Series I am watching after completing a Season so it will probably be years before I have all my VEI sets watched.  Looks like I may have to start watching them more quickly and trying to go through the entire set series at once.  UGH, way to ruin an enjoyable recreation VEI!",1469836800,2,1741,4.239393939393939
