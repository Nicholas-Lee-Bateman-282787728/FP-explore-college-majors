7889543,3,6305470324,"Joanna Coles, played by Wendy Schumacher, likes to show off. She likes to perform too, but that's not all. Possessed of a great figure, she likes to be observed while doing intimate things. To spread her intimacy around, taking the intimacy out of intimacy. Enter Alex Savage. Alex played by James Matthew, is the perfect foil for Joanna's exhibitionist tendencies, being a voyeur and a game player. The foremast game in Alex's repertoire is pretending to be blind. You'd be surprised what people will do in front of you if they think you can't see them.

The Plot

I must admit, I cannot ascertain a discernable plot. The plot seems to center around Alex Savage, his penchant for game playing. As things proceed, the viewer may wonder just how far he can go, without someone being hurt or killed.

The Story

Well known rock promoter Alex Savage is rich and kinky. He first comes across the equally kinky Joanna Coles in a bar. Mostly undressed, she looks up and smiles at Alex, while getting laid on a pool table by an anonymous bar patron, as he and a gaggle of spectators goggle the spectacle. Shortly thereafter, Joanna who purports to be an author, in the throes of writer's block, between her other throes, receives an invitation to party at a party at Alex's mansion.

Not one to shrink from a challenge, she attends the party, where she succumbs to Alex's charms, or maybe he succumbs to Joanna's charms, it's difficult to tell. In any event they go to bed (actually couch) and ostensibly seal some unspoken agreement. Joanna moves in to Alex's pad and proceeds to seduce Alex's clients in front of the deceptively blind record producer while he maneuvers his new housemate into these situations, intently watching the results. It's like he's Joanna's fairy god pimp, arranging and setting in motion her interludes.

Conclusion

By now, you may have decided that this movie sounds interesting. Let me assure you my description sounds far more interesting than it actually is. While the directing and acting is decent, after a while I got a little tired of the story. While it my sound scintillating, for me it started to get lame. But that's not the worst of it. In an erotic softcore movie the two most important things are the attractiveness of the cast and quality of the sex scenes. Admittedly the cast was attractive but the sex scenes were passionless, lacking emotion and wooden.

I also found a couple scenes between Joanna and Alex's recording artist clients to be disingenuous. Even if Alex was truly blind, he wasn't deaf, yet Joanna and her partner de jour would always make love in front of Alex. One time when he was having a conversation with his client, the conversation just died while Joanna seduced him. Alex kept talking even though nobody answered him. All things considered. I felt the good and bad features of the movie canceled each other out, therefore I gave the film an average rating. 3 stars.

7889544,5,6305470324,This review is for the full uncut version which lasts about 90 minutes. I've recently purchased this movie again and I received the 82 minute version which removes a lot from the sex scenes. The long version is great and I would like to get my hands on it.,1139184000,6,256,4.244897959183674
7889545,4,6305470324,"This is the last (so far) installment in the ""Animal Instincts"" series (again, interested persons are recommended to get the uncut/unrated version).  It's also one of the last softcores directed by Gregory Hippolyte (a/k/a pornmeister Greg Dark of the Dark Brothers), and in fact is one of his best.  Wendy Schumacher is no Shannon Whirry, who _owns_ the role of Joanna, but she does her best and turns in some quite hot scenes (especially her first sex scene with the male lead; she's aroused beforehand by watching a threesome which is another of the erotic high points).

Good softcore can often be more erotically exciting than hardcore, and this movie is a case in point.",1104278400,4,676,4.860869565217391
7889546,4,6305470324,"Wendy Schumaker does an adequate job replacing the lucious Shannon Whirry in the starring role.  Shannnon, however, is amazingly beautiful and sexy in Animal Instincts.  Besides an unbelievalbe body, Shannon Whirry also possesses an incredibly long tongue which she readily uses on no less than six different actors.  The first Animal Instincts is Shannon's film debut, and oh my, it's quite a treat to see her use that long tongue time and time again.  Aminal Instincts 3 is worthwhile, but, hey, where is Shannon Whirry?",989884800,6,522,5.105882352941176
7889547,2,6305470324,"And I don't mean that in a good way. The acting in this movie is awful. Even the sex. About the only thing actress Wendy Schumacher has going for her is her gravity-defying chest. And the whole plot with the blind music producer and the exhibitionist? Give me a break. This movie is bad, even for a skin flick. 2 stars.",970876800,4,319,4.245901639344262
7889548,4,6305470324,"Well Wendy goes all out for this one.  She plays the part of an exhibitionist, who can't seem to keep her clothes on despite performing for a blind character?.  That about sums it up.  If you like large chunks of  silicone filling your tv screen get this movie.  Otherwise you may just  have fun laughing at the absurdity of it all.",961027200,2,332,4.360655737704918
