8162397,5,6304475918,"I remember taping this off of PBS years ago, and I still enjoy watching it to this day.

The ""modern"" QE2 footage was actually shot on a voyage in 1979; my mother was embarking on a Holland America cruise the exact same day the QE2 was arriving in New York.

It's great to see how cruising and ships were 30 years ago. Although it's a transatlantic crossing, you can see passengers learning how to dance ""The Hustle,"" non-digital casino games, REAL food, and people dancing to big-band jazz.

The rest of the documentary really shows the beauty of the gigantic and graceful liners of the past. It really stirs up the yearning to take a trip on an elegant, luxurious ship.",1251158400,,671,4.528925619834711
