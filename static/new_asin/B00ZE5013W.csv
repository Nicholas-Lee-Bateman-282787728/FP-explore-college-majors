7276850,4,B00ZE5013W,"""The Connection"" is a terrific ""French"" version of the the 1971's best picture ""The French Connection.""  In this case, Jean Dujardin, best known for the oscar-winning ""The Artist"", plays a tough french cop trying to bring down the same criminal that Gene Hackman went after in the 1971 film.  A great 70's vibe and tough-as-nails tone makes this a great half of a classic double bill...here is a more detailed look at the filmL

7276851,5,B00ZE5013W,"Two things: 1) I never saw the original ""French Connection"" with Gene Hackman, so I'm a ""Connection"" virgin. 2) If you thought the many awards including Jean Dujardin's Best Actor Oscar in 2012 for ""The Artist"" was a fluke, you must see ""La French"" (English captions). Don't let the movie-star looks fool you, this guy can act!

This Action/Thiller is loosely based on actual events when drug kingpins from Marseilles moved into power. I hesitate to call it a remake of the American version because I understand there are significant differences, but if you wish to do so, please be my guest. By the way, ""La French"" is slang for what we might call ""The Mafia.""

Writer-Director Cdric Jimenez takes us to the mid-70s, where we see children playing with an Etch-a-Sketch and hear a vocalist sing (in French) These Boots Were Made for Walkin'. He shows us two powerful men, one a law-enforcement officer and the other his arch rival, a drug lord, locked in a powerful conflict between good and evil. Both are devoted family men, with wives they adore and children they indulge. Neither man will budge.

The cast includes:
  * Jean Dujardin (""The Monuments Men"") is Pierre Michel, recently promoted to Magistrate in the Organized Crime division, highly motivated because he had previously worked with drug-addicted youth. He has a wife and two darling daughters. The stakes are higher now than they were when he was a gambler.
  * Gilles Lellouche (""Tell No One"") is Gatan 'Tany' Zampa, who holds himself above the chaos his enterprise has created, he leaves the dirty work to his henchmen. This handsome fellow prefers to stay at home with his beloved family; he has never been arrested.

There are assorted wives, sidekicks, associates, hit men and drug dealers; we watch cocaine being produced, packaged and concealed for export. We also see it distributed on American streets to the addicts it has created.

This is a well-crafted movie with a complicated R-rated plot that never confuses. We have people to loathe, even while we understand them; and we have people to root for, even while we fear for them. It has cold-blooded murders, betrayals and brutal beatings. I'm not a fan of this genre, but I was so impressed by Dujardin, I became totally engrossed.",1437782400,4,2261,4.8671875
7276852,4,B00ZE5013W,"""The Connection"" (2014 release from France and Belgium; 135 min. original title ""La French"") is an action crime drama, ""loosely based on real events"" we are reminded at the beginning of the movie. Those real events are the role the southern French city of Marseille played in supplying (some might say: overwhelming) the US with hard drugs in the 1970s. As the movie opens, it says ""Marseille, 1975"", and as we follow a motor scooter, the biker all of the sudden stops, and shoots someone in cold blood in a nearby car. We then get to know Pierre Michel, a magistrate who is just being transferred from Juvenile to Organized Crime. Michel throws himself with gusto into the mob-fighting, and along the way bruises with his colleagues at work too. At this point we're about 15 min. into the movie, but to tell you more would spoil your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Couple of comments: first, when a movie puts up a disclaimer that says ""loosely based"" on real events, you can bet your last dollar that the movie departs significantly from what really happened. How is it that ""The French Connection"", surrounding similar facts from the US perspective, was made in 1971, yet this movie plays out from 1975 into the early 80s? If you set aside historical concerns, this movie does quite well, actually. The story is solid and takes its time to play out. No, there isn't a singular scene as memorable as the car/elevated train chase as in ""The French Connection"", but there is enough tension in ""The Connection"" that it kept me interested from start to finish. Second, a major plus is the historical accuracy in the decors and scenery. Right away from the opening scene on the motor scooter, I was marveling at all the 1970s French cars (Renault, Simca, Citroen, you name, they're all there, and plentiful), which I loved growing up in Belgium during that era. Likewise with attention to clothing and such. Third, the movie is technically a French-Belgian co-production, and the Belgian investors required some scenes shot in Belgium. The Krypton night club scenes were shot in Antwerp, Belgium (my original home town), and the prison scenes were shot in Charleroi, Belgium. Fourth, Jean Dujardin has a meaty character and role here, and he gives a fine performance as Magistrate Michel. Last but certainly not least, there is a very nice collection of songs in the movie from that era, both French (Serge Gainsbourg, Mike Brant, Sheila, etc.) and English (Blondie, Velvet Underground, Venus Ganga, Kim Wilde, etc.). It's available on Amazon France.

""The Connection"" opened last weekend at my local art house theater here in Cincinnati, and I finally had a chance to see it. The early evening screening where I saw this at was attended so-so, and that's a shame. I found ""The Connection"" always entertaining, never boring and at times outright riveting. If you are in the mood for a quality foreign movie, or perhaps just curious how ""la French"" (as the term 'French Connection' was referred to in France) is portrayed by this French interpretation of it, you cannot go wrong with this movie. ""The Connection"" is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!",1433980800,10,3180,4.85451197053407
7276855,5,B00ZE5013W,"A gritty look at the Marseille underworld of the 70s, centering on a magistrate and the mobsters he pursues.  It's more than a police drama or mobster movie as it touchingly delves into the family lives of the protagonists.

But in this opportunity from a very careful perspective with total attention to the minimum details. Jean Duardin (Judge Pierre) is assigned to ride the investigation of the Maresella connection. The formidable script invites us to this universe of double crossing, greed, ambitions and the well known bureaucratic obstacles all the way through. Febrile tension and a very soild script make this film one of the best of the year.

Dujardin's performance is outstanding -as always- as well the rest of the crew (specially Zampa). Don't miss it!!!",1465776000,,658,5.266666666666667

7277076,5,B00ZE5013W,"Masterpiece of a movie from storyline, to acting, all the way to the soundtrack. The Connection (2014) is the French version of the French Connection by William Friedkin from the early 70's...which was the highlight decade of the French Connection's existence.  The film starts the French star, now internationally known, Jean Dujardin as Pierre Michel (a police magistrate/judge) who gets reassigned to a Marseille Police department specializing in fighting organized crime and drug trafficking.  Marseille was in the 70's and early 80's a port city from which shipments of heroin were transported to world wide destinations, specifically New York City.  The French Connection (name of the organized group composed of Italians, Corsicans, and French citizens) was led by Gaetan Zampa in the film played by Gilles Lellouche.  The film opens up in the year 1975.  Michel, who has an incorruptible character,  gets promoted to a department that fights organized crime.  From day one at his new job he masters a plan to get rid off the French Connection, which is responsible for the sell of heroin that ruins lives of people he sworn-in to protect.

7277079,4,B00ZE5013W,"Most movie-goers of a certain age will likely remember the 1971 classic, The French Connection starring Gene Hackman.  Best known for its exhilarating car chase in NYC, the film dealt with 2 police detectives trying to corral an invasive drug cartel coming out of Marseille, France.  More than 40 years later Cedric Jimenez, a Marseille native tells the story from the French side of the Atlantic.

The drug trade there was run by a mob called La French (also the original title of the film) and its leader Tany Zampa (Gilles Lellouche).  With the infestation of drugs unabated, a magistrate in the juvenile court is assigned to bring the criminals to justice.  A magistrate in the French system is more like an investigative and independent prosecutor than a judge.  Pierre Michel (Jean Dujardin) seems a bit over his head early on but picks up the pace quickly and eventually begins to haul in the lower level crooks.  Unfortunately this has an adverse effect on this wife, Jacqueline (Celine Sallette) and their children.

The film also focuses heavily on Zampa who loves his wife, Christiane (Melanie Doutey) so much he buys her disco clubs to give her something to do.  He doesnt do drugs or drink booze, but hes ruthless and determined to stay in power.  Thus the struggle between the good guys and the bad guys weve seen numerous times in film.  But Jimenez and his co-scripter, Audrey Diwan tell the story beautifully with crisp dialog and involving subplots.  Equally good is the photography, shot on film by Laurent Tangy.  This is an interesting if long (2 hrs. 15 min.) crime drama.  Excellent performances by Lellouche and Oscar winner, Dujardin make the film easy to recommend.

The Blu ray disc comes in a 1080p video transfer with a 2.39:1 aspect ratio.  The disc is well done with sparkling images, well defined and detailed.  The scope is wide-ranging, with scenes of nightclubs, government offices and sunny beaches equally well done.  Excellent black levels and fine grain are consistent throughout.  The audio comes from a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and is equally well done.  Unlike many films the sonic tones of the film are refined and rarely stand out.  Gunshots sound real rather than exaggerated.  Surrounds are somewhat limited, most heavily used in the Krypton night club.  The dialog heavy film is easily heard, although the film is in French with easy to read English subtitles.  English SDH is also available.  Extras include a 51 minute Making of piece, 7 deleted scenes, several trailers and a booklet.",1448409600,,2539,4.903755868544601

7277081,5,B00ZE5013W,"From my Inquirer review.
It's hard to dispute the status of William Friedkin's 1971 true-crime classic The French Connection as one of the greatest crime thrillers ever made.

Yet, the events that inspired the film - the investigation into a multimillion-dollar heroin trade route that spanned Turkey, France, Canada, and America - continue to fascinate and have found their way into several other gangster pics, including the John Frankenheimer-helmed sequel, French Connection II and Ridley Scott's American Gangster.

French filmmaker Cdric Jimenez revisits the story in his brilliant thriller The Connection, which tells the story from the point of view of the French cops and prosecutors who were involved in the case.

The film was released Tuesday by Cinedigm's Drafthouse Films label.

Featuring unsurpassed photography and action sequences, Jimenez's film also boasts great acting from its two leads. Jean Dujardin, who won an Oscar for his remarkable turn in 2011's The Artist, stars as police magistrate Pierre Michel, while Gilles Lellouche ( Tell No One) plays his adversary, Marseille drug kingpin Gatan ""Tany"" Zampa.

Watch Friedkin's film again. Then sit back and revel in this brilliant Gallic reimagination.",1447891200,,1225,5.49468085106383
7277082,5,B00ZE5013W,"This is the other half of the story of seventies classic - The French Connection. Jean Dujardin (The Artist) plays Magistrate Pierre Michel who in 1974 gets promoted to deal with organised crime in Marseilles. Gilles Lellouche (Mea Culpa and Mesrine) plays the drugs uber lord Tany  who rules with an iron fist and any other implement that can come to hand. He runs a crime network that includes night clubs, casinos and restaurants and will do anything to keep what he has and make tons more cash

This is one of those times when crims made so much money that they could buy their way out of trouble  even before they were in it. So inevitably Michel has more than the crooks to do battle with. It follows the story from the mid seventies and into the eighties and it is one helluva ride.

The period detail is excellent, the cars, fashions and the music are all spot one  even the decor. There is violence and plenty of potty mouth goings on, but it is all in context. It is also a stylish film that means that most shots are great to look at as well as being intensely entertaining. This is a film that should get a lot more attention and if you are a stranger to French cinema it may be a good one to start with to see just how well they can make them.",1447804800,3,1256,4.2384937238493725
