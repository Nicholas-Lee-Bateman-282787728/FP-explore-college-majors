8132280,4,B000GH3Q44,"From infamous Director, Ruggero Deodato (CANNIBAL HOLOCAUST) comes CONCORDE AFFAIR! After a Concorde super-sonic jet crashes into the Atlantic ocean, reporter, Moses Brody (James Franciscus- BENEATH THE PLANET OF THE APES, THE CAT O' NINE TAILS) is after the story. Meanwhile, two fishermen, who saved the plane's sole survivor (Mimsy Farmer- THE BLACK CAT) , are murdered at sea! As for the survivor herself, she's abducted! Next, Brody's ex-wife tells him that she's got big news for him, but before he can meet w/ her, she has fatal ""heart failure""! Brody soon realizes that something more than a simple plane crash is going on. Sure enough, his life is in danger almost immediately. Simultaneously, a cabal of aviation magnates, including Milland (Joseph Cotten) plot the end of the Concorde. Can Brody solve this mystery before he gets himself killed? This movie, while mild in comparison to Deodato's more notorious work, is actually quite engaging. The underwater scenes are particularly well-done. Franciscus is in top form here, in one of his better roles. Two thirds of the way in, the movie switches into an airline disaster film, w/ Van Johnson as the Concorde's histrionic pilot! Well worth watching, even more than once...",1421452800,,1236,5.154228855721393
8132281,2,B000GH3Q44,"In hindsight, ""the Concorde Affair"" doesn't seem like a project that fits into Ruggero Deodatto's filmography. This was, after all, the guy that would unleash ""Cannibal Holocaust"" and ""the House on the Edge of the Park""--two of the most brutal exploitation film ever made--on to the public. Of course, he hadn't made those film when he sat in the director's chair for this film, but he had made ""Last Cannibal World"", so this bloated hanger-on to the American disaster film still seems like an oddity.

Most people argue that the ""Airport"" series symbolized the rise and fall of the disaster film, yet I would argue that this film truly signaled the trend's impending death; until the 1990s, no film sub-genre was truly dead until the Italians had taken a few shots at it, even if was already in the doldrums.

Deodatto's film is over flowing with intrigue, plot twists, chases, murder and EVEN MORE intrigue. James Franciscus and Mimsy Farmer do their best and manage to imbue the various suspense scenes with some tension; unfortunately, there's simply way too much plot for a movie striving to be a bit of dumb fun. The film is competent, though hardly essential viewing.

What really hurts this movie is the cruddy DVD given to us by Substance Video. The print is washed out and has constant imperfections, ghosting, and pixilation issues. What would be a perfect viewing for a lazy evening is rendered nearly unwatchable. I can't recommend this DVD, which is too bad since ""The Concorde Affair"" would be a great find for Italian film aficionados like myself.",1405641600,,1563,4.868421052631579
8132282,3,B000GH3Q44,"The movie is great but the picture quality is inexcusably bad. The price is also way to hight for a movie of this quality. The VHS version, which I have viewed, is far superior to this. I would've given this movie 5 stars if the quality had been better.",1244073600,4,253,4.183673469387755
8132283,5,B000GH3Q44,"But $22.95? Really??? How stupid you think people ARE? Who's gonna buy it? In Europe, it's less than $2.00!!! NTSC or PAL.
Good luck with selling it, you morons!",1229472000,4,161,4.586206896551724
8132284,2,B000GH3Q44,"I bought this product merely to add to a DVD collection of Air Disaster flicks.

I have to say that despite it beeing described as ""Digitally remastered"" the video quality is very dissapointing. In fact a VHS tape I already own is far superior. The story line is nothing exceptional but nevertheless Telavista ought to be ashamed for such low standards, worthy of boycott",1176681600,4,371,4.796875
