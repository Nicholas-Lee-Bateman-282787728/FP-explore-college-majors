I really enjoyed this movie.  If you love Christmas and want a deeper understanding of Christmas,  and laugh at the same time then i highly recommend this movie. If you're concerned that Santa is made to not be real for your kids in this movie, don't worry.

Get a bunch of friends together to watch this spiritual successor to The Room, Troll 2, Birdemic, etc. because it's just as hilarious! The behind the scenes of this movie are even more fascinating, from Kirk Cameron trying to rig the Rotten Tomatoes ratings to him asking his fans to give this movie a good rating on IMDB. His attempts to boost the movie's reviews failed and it still won a ton of Razzie's and became IMDB's worst rated movie ever. I'm sure none of that stuff will be mentioned in the special features.

Thanks for the explanation of the ""True Meaning of Christmas,"" but Christ was likely born in July and December 25th was chosen because it was a popular pagan holiday-so easy to remember for the illiterate at the time. Not insulting Christianity at all-or Kirk's beliefs. For those who chose to honor His birthday, then great, but we should be honoring it everyday, right? And PS if Kirk was was concerned about commercialism-this movie would be given away for free.. But I am assuming Kirk wanted to make a profit, or at least cover his costs. Translation:commercialism.

Kirk's brother-in-law avoids Christmas and he hides out in his car.  ""Repeatedly drinking from an empty cup of cocoa sets the tone of this movie right out of the gate"" - a YouTube commenter.

Short synopsis: Kirk tries to talk sense into Christian (Kirk's Brother-in-Law) about loving Christmas again.  How all the Christmas stuff you see IS a celebration of Christ.  Christian eventually returns to the Christmas party for a Hip Hop dance celebration.

Everything about this film is bad; Dialogue, Acting, Direction, cinematography.
Pointless dialogue, the dialogue in this film is like a truck being stuck in the mud. Tires spinning throwing mud everywhere and going nowhere.
Slow panning shots of Christmas plates and decorations, total waste & misuse of the screen time.  Kirk's acting looked forced.  Christian looked like he didn't care.  Seems like he just wanted the scenes to end and get to filming the next.

7444046,1,B015N8JCK2,"This movie should have been shown only television and only on a religious network. But even then, the ratings would have been terrible. Only the most die-hard fundamentalist trying to squeeze a Christian meaning out of every Christmas symbol would have liked this movie. The only Xmas show I've seen that's worse than this is the Star Wars Holiday Special (on YouTube), which has never been re-broadcast since 1978 or released on home video.

Christian, Kirk's brother-in-law, is complaining about how so many of the symbols of Christmas, most notably Christmas trees, are not biblical in origin. Kirk, in his revisionism, goes way out on a limb to deny the pagan origins of the symbols and traditions of Christmas. He tells Christian that Christmas trees were God's idea, since he made the trees. He also says that each tree represents a Christian cross. Christian then starts complaining about Santa Claus. He sees Santa as replacing Jesus, and notices that ""Santa"" and ""Satan"" have the same letters -- what a stretch. But Kirk tells him that the original Santa Claus was actually Saint Nicholas -- who in actuality was one of several sources for the character. Kirk ends his lecture be saying that the presents under the tree represent the buildings of New Jerusalem. The last 15-20 minutes are partying, eating, and bloopers.

A conspiracy theorist as the party, meanwhile, is complaining about the removal of public manger scenes, and says they're be removed to Area 52, which he says is similar to Area 51.

Kirk's brother-in-law's real name, by the way, is John Ridenour. His name Christian in the movie is probably meant to represent Christians disappointed about the non-religious symbols of Christmas. Christian at one point says, ""It's like a car-jacking of our religion!"" This is probably a hint that Kirk, along with some Christians (but not all), doesn't like the loss of Christian dominance over the holiday season.

The truth, Kirk and Christian, is that late December was a time of celebration long before the rise of Christianity, with the focus being on the Winter Solstice. Since the early Christian leaders knew they couldn't suppress the celebrations, they adopted them as their own. The rebirth of the Sun during the Solstice became the birth of the Son. So, it was actually the early Christians who ""car-jacked"" the ancient pagan symbols of the Winter Solstice and turned them into celebrations about their mythical savior.

The bible actually provides no information on time of the year Jesus was born. However, if ""shepherds were in the field keeping watch over their flocks by night"", it probably wasn't in the dead of winter. Thus, the celebration of Christmas itself in December, like the non-religious Christmas symbols Christian is complaining about, is not biblical in origin.

Until a few centuries ago, Christmas seemed more like Mardi Gras rather than a quiet time to be with family and friends. The 17th century Puritans, who didn't like the rowdiness, banned Christmas (party poopers) in England under Cromwell and in New England.

Kirk's response to the failure of his movie was to blame it on a massive atheist conspiracy. Some people just don't like criticism. When they can't debate their opponents, they demonize them.

If you want a good show about Christmas, I highly recommend History Channel's ""Christmas Unwrapped: The History of Christmas."" It provides an excellent history of the symbols and traditions of the holiday, and shows the different views of it. ""Saving Christmas"" is intellectually insulting.",1502236800,,3552,5.09106529209622

7444052,1,B015N8JCK2,"Kirk Cameron really likes Christmas and expects the viewer, if he or she wants to be considered a devout Christian, to like it too. Pointing out any sort of materialism or commercialism connected to the season is, according to Kirk-logic, anti-Christian. Anybody suggesting the idea that materialism may be an itty-bitty bit of a problem is some sort of instrument of the devil. (I'm looking at you, Charlie Brown. Stop whining about aluminum Christmas trees and drink your hot chocolate!) He does give a disclaimer that you should not get into debt (Otherwise you may expect him and his right-wing peeps to bail-out your sorry heathen ass because if Jesus truly loved you, you could afford Christmas.), but puts an almost Gordon Gekko ""Greed is good!"" spin on the holidays. In the Christian tradition I was raised in, this MIGHT be considered blasphemy, but clearly we lacked leadership that could spin the story of the nativity into the theology of ""Prosperity Christianity"". Cameron's theology is so corrupt, it's almost entertaining. Cameron thinks he is deep and profound, but is swimming in the shallow end of the kiddie pool. He is smugger than thou and the dance sequence at the end was just ridiculous. It was far more entertaining than I anticipated and was so bad it was almost good.

7444057,1,B015N8JCK2,"So I struggled with whether or not to give this 5 stars or 1 star.  This is one of the worst movies that has ever been made.  Ever.  It's STAGGERING how bad this movie is.

It doesn't mean you won't enjoy it.  With some funny friends and a case of beer, this could make for a pretty hilarious evening.  The only reason I watched some of it on YouTube (not all of it) was because I read a review that has tragically been taken down.  The review made me giggle uncontrollably about how bad the movie was and pointed out that the un-answered question of Crazy Shirt Friday was a cinematic question for our time.  This lost review was an American Treasure.  Actually, the only reason I decided to review it today was because the 1-star reviews made me laugh and I wanted to revisit that delight today.  What I found was something interesting...there's a bunch of short 5 star reviews that have bumped up the rating that have been added over this past Christmas season.

Anyways, I decided on one star because the message of the movie becomes incredibly dangerous if left to it's own devices.  Kirk, on more than one occasion, advocates for materialism and seems to want to steer his brother-in-law away from worry about those who are less fortunate and towards glitzy holiday parties.  When Kirk is talking to his brother in the car, I am reminded of Senator Palpatine trying to give Anakin a bunch of reasons to join the Dark Side.  Eventually, after a bunch of really weird vignettes, the brother-in-law gives in to the Dark Side but instead of executing order 66, the brother-in-law executes an apocalyptically un-cool hip-hop dance sequence.

(Yes, I went first three on the Star Wars reference on purpose...I won't besmirch the IV-VI with a ""Saving Christmas"" comparison)

Another ridiculous (and potentially incredibly offensive) aspect to this movie was the Token Black Guy De'Andre.  As a white guy, I'm really not allowed to pass judgment on how offensive this is.  Maybe it's not.  Maybe a majority of black people find De'Andre's character to be whimsical and amusing.  What I would point out is that a script that has a black man talking about removal of Crazy Shirt Friday as marked oppression in the same terms and with the same passion as the oppression the civil rights movement attempted to unshackle is jarringly tone deaf.

Look, you can save yourself some severe embarrassment in the eyes of your family if you watch the first 15 minutes of this on YouTube first.  Honestly, Amazon should embed the first 15 minutes in your shopping cart and make you watch it before you check out, so as to avoid recklessly subjecting anybody else to this movie.

Watching this movie is a decision you can never take back.  The hip-hop sequence is something you can never un-see.  You've been warned...",1494374400,3,2802,4.716049382716049

This however gets lost in the poor presentation which feels nothing like a movie and more like a bad lecture that went on for way too long. The movie portion could have been about the length of a Growing Pains episode and the thinking out loud sections could have been much shorter. You never get drawn into the characters or the story and I was left with the feeling that the script was written in haste on the back of a napkin. Very disappointed Kirk and I am a believer.

7444096,1,B015N8JCK2,"You tried to warn me, internet, but I just wouldnt listen.  We were having a family Christmas night and thought it might be nice to rent a movie.  Against the overwhelming advice to the contrary we went out and rented Saving Christmas.

Now I know that Christian films can behow can I put this delicatelylame.  But I figured Kirk Cameron is a professional entertainer.  He has been in several productions and knows how to tell a story.  Besides my expectations were so low  I figured wed at least be able to enjoy this a little bit.  Right?  Am I right?  No.  I was wrong.

So so wrong.

Now I cant possibly offer a long review on this wholesome holiday offering because we turned it off after about 15 minutes.  The kids were groaning after 5 minutes.  It was sheer endurance that got us to the 15 minute part.

The premise of the story centers around Kirk Cameron.  He loves Christmas and laments about the fact that there are Christmas haters out there.  To be honest I haven't met many, but Ill take his word for it.  Im sure they are out there and perhaps this film was made for them.  He then intrusively narrates a story about his sister who is married to a Christian Grinch.  He hates Christmas because its so pretentious and the money we spend on presents could be used to feed starving children and theres no reference in the Bible to a tree and wasn't Jesus born in July or something?

Lucky for him that Kirk Cameron is his brother in law.  Cameron plants himself next to his brother in law, hears his thoughtful questions and then has all the answers for him.  Its great!  Honestly, some of the stuff that Kirk points out is pretty interesting  the fact that the baby was born in a sort of cave and wrapped in cloths, given frankincense and myrrh and that he was buried in a cave wrapped in cloths and treated with those same spices.  Good insight really.  The brother in law was posing questions that maybe a small minority of tightly wound Bible students might have.  If the audience was tightly wound Bible Grinches  then Bravo.  You nailed them.

I think the problem was this  show us don't tell us!  We want to get involved in a story, not  sit through a lecture.  The kids felt like it was a lecture.  I felt like Kirk Cameron set himself up as the all knowing savior who has arrived at a flawless and pure view of Christmas.  We turned it off and thats it for my impression.  We watched Elf instead.

I think Buddy the Elf gets Christmas too.  At least he gets the magical and childlike fun of Christmas.  And hes cute and not annoying about it.",1487289600,2,2565,4.370212765957447

7444110,1,B015N8JCK2,"Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas is a Christian movie with an outspoken Christian actor's name in the title. So of course it's going to preach to the choir. That's not the worst problem with this movie.

Nor are the ham-fisted actors, the awkward script, the home-movie aesthetic. All this I can accept - there's a certain charm to them, especially if you aren't spending money on it. Nobody fires up this movie expecting The Ten Commandments. Or even God's Not Dead. (C Me Dance? Maybe.)

The biggest problem is this: the movie doesn't make a damn bit of sense. None of it. Not even the title.

Here's the situation: Kirk's brother-in-law is annoyed that the secular trappings of Christmas are distracting everyone from celebrating the birth of Christ. He's been on the internet (his first mistake!), reading about druids, the winter solstice, how Jesus wasn't even born in December, and he's so depressed he can't even enjoy the ""hot chocolate"" Kirk ""drinks"" in his endless intro. It's up to Kirk to set Christian (yep, that's his name) straight by delivering a set of origin stories that recast all the great things about the holiday, from Christmas trees to cookies to Santa Claus, in a pro-Jesus, pro-Christian, this-is-OUR-holiday light.

Fair enough. Though I'm an atheist. I love Christmas and all the trappings and traditions - and I know a fair amount about them (and not from Wikipedia - like many atheists, I grew up going to church and Sunday school), including the controversies surrounding some of them.

But Kirk's lectures, brought to ""life"" in painfully slow, poorly lit, dreadfully staged vignettes, are so bizarre, confusing, and nonsensical they don't even effectively preach to the choir. His logic is circular, inane, and even self-contradictory - the bit about Christmas trees, which somehow combines the death of BABY Jesus with Adam's munching fruit from the Tree of Knowledge, is entirely baffling. And are we supposed to believe that ""Christian,"" a grown husband and father who ""loves the Lord"" (actual dialogue), doesn't know that ""Santa"" means ""Saint,"" much less know \St. Nicholas was, in fact, a saint? Not that it matters - Cameron never addresses what should be Christian's biggest concern: the Norse pagan solstice celebrations and traditions pre-date Christianity by thousands of years. Rather than address this, Cameron just sort of mocks the concept of ""druids"" and moves on. (A bit more on that later.) If the rest of the movie were any good, I'd say these bits sink the movie - they're leaden, laughingly staged and written, and - most importantly - incomprehensible.

The party scenes feature forced interactions with bland actors (the only memorable character is an uncomfortably pandering, sassy but ""comically"" non-threatening black man named Diondre) and geeky, sitcommy, intentionally (?) hokey humor. Maybe you'll find it amusing, or at least warm. I genuinely wanted to, as the actors all seem like nice people. Director Darren Doane, who plays Christian, tries to create the perfect Upper-Middle Class Christmas Dinner Party - there are weird moments (I swear the creepy, disheveled Santa gets too handsy with the kids - and do Christmas house parties really have full-time Santas?). And, of course, there's the notoriously awful dance number that pads the scant running time - I guess Doane thinks he still has some breakdancing moves to show off, but it's one of the cringiest ""fun"" moments ever caught on film, digital or otherwise.

But it's those in-the-car lectures that really make this movie dishearteningly awful. They are so incoherent, unconvincing, and weird that they turn what could have been fun camp into deeply unlikable camp. At one point, Cameron's v/o, exasperated that Christian keeps bringing up Pagans and the Winter Solstice, says something like ""Besides, who created the winter solstice in the first plcae? GOD!""

And y'know what? That's the message of the movie. ""We don't believe in that stuff - we believe in this stuff."" Why Christmas trees? Because God made them. Why ornaments, Santa, reindeer, and hot chocolate? God. Why should we spend an hour watching rich white people (and their black friends) gorge on turkey, ham, and chocolate in between horrid bits of theater? God, that's why. For a movie that claims to supply ammo to Christians who want to argue with their atheist, Jewish, Muslim, or even reasonable Christians, it's pure bait and switch. You'll exit the theater in a sea of confusion, wondering why that handsome man told you a Christmas Tree was a symbol of the baby Jesus dying on the cross, and we decorate it with balls that look like the fruit Adam ate.

The worst crime of the film? It doesn't save Christmas, because it never puts Christmas in peril. There's simply no need to save Christmas.

I'm not sure I can say the same about Kirk Cameron and Darren Doane, though.",1484179200,8,4871,5.024783147459727

7444137,2,B015N8JCK2,"I was was disappointed that the film had slim to no bible verses to backup Cameron's statements. The movie description says it's bible based so I, being much more like the character of Cameron's bro-in-law in as much that although I do celebrate Christmas and enjoy it, was waiting to be educated while entertained via the cutesy plot. Alas, this was not the case. I wanted to like this film, but it failed miserably. I didn't expect four or five star acting nor a sophisticated plot but it was filled with Cameron's views, opinions and by the end he's really reaching when he's describing the nutcracker as a soldier guarding the manger and Christmas presents representing a sparkling city. He goes on to explain it's perfectly fine to go bonkers buying everyone a plethora of toys and gifts yet, he says nothing about feeding or clothing, or caring the less fortunate, or the elderly. However, to be fair, Cameron offers the sage advise that all that spending on our friends and family is fine provided you only spend up to your credit limit and not a penny over, lol!
So if this film is available to you with no rental fee, you are a Kirk Cameron fan, you're Not interested in seeking out biblical understanding and just want to find something on roku to fall asleep to - go for it.

Hold your family close as you watch this movie in their warm embrace.  Saving Christmas puts into perspective the history of Christmas and reconciles it with our modern traditions.  The war on Christmas isn't a hopeless battle of idealism versus nihilism...it's more of a struggle to get our heads out of the clouds and see the Truth all around us, and that truth is Jesus Christ.

The history of Jesus Christ and the present are tied together:

The tree as a representation of the garden of Eden and the cross

The teenie tiny little baby Jesus, born to die, but only at the appointed time!

Santa Clause (one BAD dude, in a good way)...St. Nicholas was no joke, he was both a fierce 'warrior', and a bringer of joy and light for children and adults alike.

On Metacritic, it managed a rating of 18, on a scale of 0-100. IMDB - 1.5 out of 10. So no, it isn't just me.

This ""film"" is an incredibly banal, insipid, dreary and lifeless vanity project by an equally talentless hack. The plot - and that's being very generous -  sets up Mr. Cameron, the Savior of Christmas As He Sees It, to bring a lost little sheep back from the brink of lost faith. The lost sheep (his brother-in-law) hasn't lost faith in God or Jesus; no he simply feels that Christmas, as celebrated with gifts and trees and Santa, has lost sight of the true meaning of the holy day. Cameron, being much more holy and knowledgeable than anyone, proceeds to educate this poor lost soul with a variety of insipid and outlandish ""proofs"". Proof that Christmas trees weren't co-opted from pagans? God has a tree in His House, and even has lights on it. Proof that the date of Christmas Day itself wasn't appropriated from earlier religions? God made the planets move in their paths, so He created the winter solstice. Santa Claus? Well, he defended the unity of God and Christ, so he belongs too. Funny, I have yet to see a shopping mall Santa discuss the Nicean Creed with a single child; in fact, Mr. Cameron even has Santa at his house, and not once does the jolly old elf mention Christ.

Technically...sheesh. Three openings,horrendous acting... the framework is mainly Cameron browbeating his victim into believing exactly as he *should* believe...Cameron pops back up after the climax to drill it into the viewers' skulls again that he's right and you're wrong, in case you somehow managed to hold onto your sanity. If for some reason you actually decide to punish yourself with a viewing  - I watched specifically to review this lump of cinders in another venue, if you were wondering - stay for the credits. The first three screens have only three last names among the 20-odd ""actors"". Vanity project, anyone, when only friends and family will take anything approaching a credit in your crapfest?

The attempted warmth of this dreck left me as cold as the remnants of a 2014 Yule log. Mr. Cameron either isn't intelligent enough, or lacks the tolerance, to accept that his view of Christmas isn't the only valid belief. How dare someone wish there was more focus on Christ during Christmas! But then, that would require an understanding of the concept of tolerance.

All in all, stay away from this film. If you want to watch a movie with a good Christian message, just watch Ben Hur with Charlton Heston or It's a Wonderful Life.

7444313,5,B015N8JCK2,"I have read many negative reviews and after seeing this movie for myself felt compelled to share some pros about this movie.  I actually did some research on the origin of the Christmas tree and St Nicholas after watching this movie.  What Cameron says about these things you can find stated on christianitytoday.com (""Why Do We Have Christmas Trees?""  and ""The Real Saint Nicholas"" and Bible.org (about Christmas trees).  I think, however, Cameron states it as absolute truth, whereas the sources states ""could"" have occurred - especially in regards to St. Nicholas.  (many stories about this man, but there is a Christian-rooted one as well).

I think what I loved about this movie is that it does make me think and consider where these traditions came from.  Cameron does a very good job in relating the current Christmas symbols today and tying it into Christianity.  I must say I will not look at Santa Claus nor a Christmas tree the same again, even if Christmas trees were a part of pagan celebrations before they became a Christmas tradition (this seems to be one of the arguments), I can truly see and make the connections - that the first tree was in the Garden of Eden, and Jesus died on a tree.  (Adam sinned taking from the tree of life (well actually Eve did, but Adam took it from her- so symbolic) and Jesus took back that sin on the tree/cross).  The gifts under the tree can be representative of Jesus's gift of life, His sacrifice for us all - He has saved us by grace - the absolute, most precious gift of all.  All we have to do is accept it and ask Him to forgive us!  What a beautiful gift!

While, some caution should be taken claiming story for fact, especially in regards to St. Nicholas, this movie encourages us to think about all of this more.  I, for one, have been for quite some time, one of the nay-sayers for Santa Claus and all things Christmas that didn't include a manger and Jesus.  But this did actually lighten the mood.  Thank you, Kirk Cameron, for showing the connections - weaving the current Christmas traditions (though perhaps more symbolic than literal) into the Christian faith.  Thank you for encouraging me to look up these issues as well.  I am not a Santa hater anymore!  Just knowing that he possibly was a defender of the Christian faith gives me a new perspective, a fresh look, on an old tradition.

Ever since I have become a Christian, I tend to find meaning in even secular stories and compare them to Biblical ones and the word of God. I think that is what ""renewing of the mind"" means.  Seeing things in this world and wrapping that view around what God's word says about it.  It appears to me that Cameron may be doing this as well with some of the histories of Christmas, but to me there  is not one thing wrong with seeing Santa Claus and thinking of one of the stories about St. Nicholas as a Christ defender, and looking at a Christmas tree and seeing first the Garden of Eden and then Christ on the cross.

To top this all off - the movie is actually hilarious, a dry sense of humor style.  Get past the first 15 minutes and you will see what I mean!",1482624000,,3118,4.45679012345679

7444315,4,B015N8JCK2,"When something draws so much ugly human response -- in time the after shock hits 10x the opposite.

I'll be the first to admit when I saw the trailer I though good Lord that's got to be the cheesiest movie ever made and it's an embarrassment to Christendom.

I didn't go see it and I refused to spend money on it and I thought to myself these cheesesy Christians going to support it are being made a laughing stock by the culture.

But I didn't actually ever watch it.

A few weeks ago I watched it while I was injured and bored out of my mind and was watching all the crappy Christmas movies on Prime -- I started to actually watch the movie and while at many parts it is very cheesy, it had some points I had never heard before.

It actually did change the way I saw some things and I sure didn't expect that.

Then I began to this year actually start to encounter some of the things Kirk shares in the movie and I was shocked as I had never encountered them and I began to see some of the impacts of them and I thought wow this movie actually has some real world application. So I shared the movie and thought to myself what unusual series of events.

Then I got on here and I started to read the reviews and well anyone can read them and see this movie seems to have primarily triggered the two groups it addresses in the movie -- who else is writing the reviews on here?

Not people like me who have not seen any of the things happen in real life -- we didn't write reviews but primarily laughed at it and went on with our lives.

There are three groups of people reviewing this -- the secular who just hate religion or Christendom in general (some are honest and admit it and that's respectable), the religious folks who either know it and are proud or who don't know they are, and the group that in some way found something of benefit in the message.

Sure different degrees and such on those, but not many others outside those groups would even watch this or take the time to write a review.

This movie bombed at the box office I think and in culture and like many movies that did the same it then in time for what ever reason starts to have the after effect and it is generally much larger than the initial impression.

It will always be cheesy, but this is now years later starting to have the impact it was made to have, but seemed to have failed to do and it's because of Amazon Prime and or Netflix.

On those platforms it gets watched by the audience that would never watch it any other way and then starts to have the effects as I've shared.

How well researched is the video? Maybe it's not the most researched, maybe it is.

What it does do it start dialogs that wouldn't start or be hard to start without the movie to watch and it does plant ideas that over time we think about and thinking isn't a bad thing.

I think all the reviewers would agree that there's a lot of noise and ideas and views all bashing heads in all this and that translates to a bunch of crap that isn't doing anyone any good.

I have found a lot of crap cleared out in what was before me and I see a lot clearer now.

Christ the center of Christmas doesn't bring fog -- He brings clarity, peace and joy -- if that's not abounding in our life -- there's crap to clear.

It's that simple.

The religious of Jesus's day had the Torah memorized and yet were blind to what God had given them.

The secular folks didn't want their ways being changed by Jesus, the same is true today.

The diligent who were observing and knew they had need of a Savior found clarity, peace and joy.

The same is true today.",1482537600,3,3593,4.167872648335745

There are many lengthy scenes of Cameron and a friend sitting in a car talking; simply not interesting to watch.

The worst part, though, is his mangling and twisting of the Bible. He misquotes the book of Matthew by claiming Joseph and Mary were hiding from Herod's soldiers who were sent to kill any baby being born. However, the Bible states that Herod's order didn't go out until AFTER Jesus was born, and was visited by the Magi, whereupon Joseph took his family and fled into Egypt. How could ANY Christian misquote and misrepresent one of the great Bible stories ever?

He creates convoluted justifications for various Christmas traditions. He insists Jesus was indeed born on the 25th of December, ignoring evidence in the Bible that suggests otherwise. He justifies Christmas trees, ignoring the parts of Jeremiah that some say forbid such things. He presents tales of Saint Nicholas as fact when in truth almost nothing is known for sure about him, other than his name. (Almost everything Cameron states about Nicholas is based purely on legend, and he exaggerates. Nicholas supposedly slapped another bishop in the face, but Cameron depicts Nicholas as savagely beating him and brutally pummeling the guy with a shepherd's crook, a scene many objected to.)

Cameron even says stacks of presents are OK by the Bible because ""they represent the skyline of Jerusalem."" That is utter nonsense; they could also represent the skyline of Babylon, Rome, or Beijing for that matter. It's grasping at straws.

At the end, he encourages Christians to go ahead and be materialistic at Christmas, and ""buy the biggest ham and richest butter"" and stuff yourselves silly. What about all the parts of the Bible that condemn materialism? At no point does he address such things as helping the poor, feeding the hungry, etc. When his friend frets about all the people their party could have fed, Cameron insists his friend ""doesn't get it"" but never really explains why his friend shouldn't be concerned for the poor. He just goes into other silly and bizarre rationalizations, and never addresses the issue.

This is definitely NOT about putting Christ back in Christmas. It's simply an exercise of using Biblical ideas to rationalize and justify worldly practices, and shaping your spiritual ideas around the life you already lead, rather than shaping your life around your spiritual ideas. Cameron needs to take time to actually read the Bible instead of pontificating and lecturing.",1482105600,,2710,5.013333333333334

7444398,3,B015N8JCK2,"I thought this movie wasn't that bad as everyone is making it out to be 'the worst movie of all time'. I think its because Kirk Cameron is very vocal about his faith and has said things that aren't not exactly inline with the Christian faith and the media has given him bad publicity and Hollywood dislikes him in general. Anyway, about the movie. I would state this movie as more a documentary about Christmas, yes the acting isn't that great and the title is little misleading as looks it suppose to be a 'fun' adventure movie. It's basically about his brother in law doesn't want to join in the Christmas party because he thinks its all pagan holiday festivals and he believes God wouldn't approve of it all. Kirk starts to explain on how your own perspectives on Christmas affect your Holiday spirit and also from a Christian view point where all the Holiday traditions came from, aka, the Christmas tree, Santa, Gift giving and the Nativity. Eventually his brother in law begins to see things differently and really starts to enjoy Christmas. Kirk makes a good point that all the excitement, lights, feasting, gift giving,  kindness, joy, cheer, and sounds of Christmas are just a tiny- tiny glimpse of what Heaven would be like with Jesus one day. For those about Santa part, yes that was weird and didn't explain well, I don't think St. Nick killed or beat Arius over heretic , according to most history St. Nick only stuck Arius in the face as he was very angry with him.

There are some funny parts in the movie and with the Holiday guests, the dance scene is pretty bad but funny to and that's the point. I watched On Amazon Prime as Netflix doesn't have this movie. I think its good for churches movie night.  Its just okay, movie lacks a spark, but it wasn't so so horrible.

My kids finished it just to see how much worse it was going to get. Thankfully it was free through Prime, or I would have been really mad to have wasted money on that.

As a believer, I have to say I have NEVER in my life heard another Christian say we need to make Christmas MORE materialistic because Jesus took on a material form....What the???? It got worse and worse..

And as a mother of special needs kids with Sensory Processing Disorder, I found it offensive  his whole reasoning that his brother in law (who turned out to be the bad guy) was WRONG and somehow ruining the very overly decorated, sensory overloaded party because he chose to go outside and take a break in the car. We have had to leave far less sensorily overloaded places...there are some people (especially those with Autism Spectrum Disorder, like one of my sons) who do not like or enjoy noisy parties with lots of glitter, people and chaos. ""Temple Grandin"", the eponymous movie,  has a wonderful scene where she as an adult home from college completely melted down at a Christmas party. This is typical for many on the Spectrum. Since when does attending Christmas parties make someone a true believer?

When he actually attempts to explain the meanings of various traditions, he really stretches logic in bizarre ways. Apparently, Christmas trees are supposed to remind you of both the cross and the Garden of Eden, with the ornaments being fruit, presents stacked are supposed to look like the skyline of the New Jerusalem, and toy soliders are Herod's soldiers. He then proceeds to act as if these are the actual origins, and claims you have been fooled by ""pagans"" when they say otherwise.
One especially strange scene was when he explained the origin of Santa Claus. Rather than focusing on Saint Nick's good deeds, he talks about how he was a real ""defender of the faith"", which apparently means continually beating a heretic with his staff.
Also of note was the highly stereotypical African American comic relief character, who for some reason spends his time comparing his office's ban on ""Crazy Shirt Friday"" to the previous oppression of his people, even at one point singing ""We Shall Overcome"".

The camera work is also atrocious, with lingering shots on characters for no apparent reasons and scenes where it continues to focus on where a character was standing, even when he leaves the room. I'm also not sure that they got permission to use the Piano Guys version of O Come O Come Emmanuel , which was certainly not mentioned in the credits.
We watched his Mercy Rules movie...another painful movie. I don't know what it is with him and Slo Mo, but he over uses it. Poor acting, poor dialogue.",1481500800,10,2818,4.705882352941177

7444574,2,B015N8JCK2,"I had read some really scathing reviews of this movie. And many drifted into Cameron bashing, some never referencing the movie and leading  me to think they hadn't even seen it. After watching it for myself I have to agree overall it's pretty bad.

First, it's not even really a movie. There isn't a story or a narrative here. Kirk is talking to his brother in law in a car about not hating on Christmas for all the right reasons. He challenges Christian to look for God in the material things to make Christmas more enjoyable. That's the whole movie. There's some weird non sequitur with two guys talking behind their mugs in the middle of the movie for no reason, and a group hip hop dance scene that goes way too long at the end. You read that correctly.

The acting is bad. Kirk is fine. The director, who plays his brother, is quite boring and not funny, made worse because his performance comes off like he thinks he's hilarious. His ranting about how bad aspects of Christmas are is tedious and make you uncomfortable with how unfunny they are. The flashback characters are pretty sub par as well.

Technically it's not terrible, but the director beats to death some techniques that are distracting. These include rack focus, slow motion, bright back-lighting and straight on photography. The slow motion is most overdone and it is mostly of director himself, which created this backstory in my mind that this guy is in love with himself.

The ""lesson"" was palatable until the last scene. To this point it seemed Kirk was simply saying ""Christmas and its tropes can mean what you choose, not what others tell you."" They should have stopped there. But he goes a step too far when he specifically advocates that to celebrate Christmas we need to be materialistic because Christmas was about God the spirit becoming material here on Earth. This infers very non-material Christmas observers aren't doing it right. And it's weird stance to hear from a Christian.

I have no idea how this script got greenlit in the first place. I'm guessing the dialogue that is too long, slow motion scenes and lengthy dance number was all to fill time to make this a feature.

It's an incomplete thought. And strangely,  manages to unite believers and non-believers by taking up the sword for something both sides could agree we need less of: materialism. Talk about ironic. Maybe that was secretly the point all along and Cameron is just trolling us. If only...",1481068800,,2449,4.7189695550351285

7444582,1,B015N8JCK2,"People who take a legalistic stance on what Christmas is and isn't, just like Kirk does in this movie, will never understand Christmas. His arguments are weak, at best. He makes some nice symbolic connections to Christmas trees and Santa, but the fact remains that the holiday is mostly contrived for the purposes of converting pagans in the Roman Empire to Christianity. And that doesn't matter. Christmas is about families and traditions that YOU make up yourself. If you want it to be about Jesus, then by all means, make it about Jesus. If you want it to be anything else, that's fine too. No one is ""stealing"" Christmas. It's different things to different people. If you find some meaning in the symbolism that Kirk Cameron creates in this movie, it's totally fine too. But do realize that he, and others who think like him, made all that symbolism up about Christmas trees, swaddling cloths, Santa Claus, etc. Those things are true to him because he wants them to be true. They are not facts. Trees were lit up and worshiped by Druids. So, the Romans created ""Christmas Trees"" to get them on board. The Europeans adopted the tradition that you now enjoy. It's OK! Santa Claus has almost NOTHING to do with the original St. Nicholas, he is more of an amalgamation of various traditions and characters from various cultures. The imagery of the red and white suit are from Coca Cola ads and the description of him in the ""Night Before Christmas"". The Jolly Old Fat Guy we all love borrows his name from St. Nicholas, who punched heretics and is the patron saint of prostitutes, but there is little else that they have in common. Don't try to make a connection. It isn't there. Santa is OUR creation, and is just another tradition that has evolved over the last couple thousand years. If any of this upsets you, again, you are not understanding Christmas at all. You want it to fit into a nice little box, just like the presents you give and receive on December 25. Very little of reality fits into a box, I'm afraid. Just enjoy the holiday for what it means to you. Watch all of the cartoons and create your own version of Santa from your favorite stories, then share them with your kids. Or, just sit around the house and enjoy the day off. It's up to you. It all has meaning, if you want it to. It's all valid.",1480982400,8,2315,4.52744630071599

Many find Kirk Cameron to be ""likable,"" but he's insufferable and pompous in this movie, with his condescension and verse-picking, not to mention the twisting of Scripture to push his agenda. My husband and I were really giving each other the side-eye, and we finally gave up without finishing the movie (which I guess is good, since the dance sequence at the end is supposedly unbearable).

7444658,3,B015N8JCK2,"Let's start with the good thing...something I'd never thought of. Believers who tend to dis Christmas because it's a pagan holiday, etc. site that the druids celebrated the winter solstice. Cameron points out that they were doing a twist on what God had done already. Had to think about that one. His analogy of the cave, swaddling clothes, etc. was quite good. The down side of this is that the dialogue is v.e.r.y..s.l.o.w. It is almost like a church play with non-actors doing their best. Surprisingly, coming from someone who is a professional actor, he's too slow in his delivery and makes it for a very slow start...and everyone in the ""play"" talks the same way. The dancing at the end is just campy-over-the-top...again, it's like the church got together and did a play and you sit through it and applaud their efforts at the end...not so much because it's good but because they worked hard on it. So if you can get past that, it offers up some points to ponder.",1479772800,,969,4.6395348837209305
7444659,1,B015N8JCK2,"This is an embarrassment to the Christian faith. Both Cameron and his brother in-law were wrong. The Scriptures tell us about the Law of Liberty:
""4Who are you to judge someone elses servant? To his own master he stands or falls. And he will stand, for the Lord is able to make him stand. 5One man regards a certain day above the others, while someone else considers every day alike. Each one should be fully convinced in his own mind. 6He who observes a special day does so to the Lord; he who eats does so to the Lord, for he gives thanks to God; and he who abstains does so to the Lord and gives thanks to God."" Romans 14
Cameron should not be trying to get a brother to violate his conscience and the brother in-law should not be trying to stifle the wife in the freedom she has in Christ. HOWEVER, it is incumbent upon the wife (or the husband if turned around) to not cause a brother (or sister) to stumble, but to honor the weaker brother (or sister).",1479772800,5,958,4.240437158469946

7444661,1,B015N8JCK2,"I am a Christian, I love Christmas and I celebrate. My Christmas centers around Christ and the Nativity,with Santa Claus no where in sight. Christmas does need saving from the commercial enterprise it has become, and does need to remember Jesus is the reason for the season. The movie Saving Christmas is a bad movie and is lacking in research on the Christmas traditions. Weak Christians often try to embrace everything about Christmas in an attempt to say they include Jesus, when strong Christian can celebrate Christmas without hanging on the bad things of the world. Christmas traditions and the Bible need to be studied to understand Christmas. For example, non-christians say Christ could not have been born in winter because the shepherds were in the cold fields. Weak Christians say nothing or say that the day doesn't matter. Christian scholars realize that people were going to there birth towns for a census and the towns were crowded. What greedy inn keeper with a full inn would not have thrown out the shepherds who kept his own flocks, out of his own stable into the cold fields in pursuit of cold hard money from a young couple about to have a baby? Maybe the way it happened? We need Christians to think deeper than this movie, which would have been bad in style no matter the topic it was about.",1479600000,8,1314,4.717391304347826

Kirk is a great storyteller, and is equally well versed as a producer - which comes through in this movie's execution.  The story of trying to get his brother-in-law to see (by Kirk's definition) the meaning of the Nativity, Santa Claus and the Christmas tree is entertaining - and the humor throughout is as well.  The real plus is the concept Kirk tries to convey that we are all in a story - and we are all part of the writing.

7444798,1,B015N8JCK2,"This is not a film, it's a boring sermon filled with a bunch of nonsense to justify all the symbols of Christmas that have absolutely nothing to do with Jesus. Not only are the stories just made up, there are times in the film where it feels like Cameron is making them up while being filmed. And then after be goes through his long drawn out stories, we must suffer through countless repetitive vignettes of Cameron and his brother-in-law sitting in a car, as the brother-in-law actually makes very good points as to why Christmas has nothing to do with Jesus. Of course, Cameron has an explanation for everything. Did you know, the Christmas tree is actually a symbol for the Cross, and the ornaments we hang on it symbolize Jesus on the Cross? And, of course, brother-in-law accepts it all as gospel (pun intended). This is not one of those movies that's so bad, it's good. No. It's so bad, I couldn't finish watching it. Up to a point it's like a train wreck you can't take your eyes off. But then it just gets unbearably boring.",1458432000,23,1033,4.5

7444829,2,B015N8JCK2,"Anybody that reads the bible constantly would know that alot of stuff he was saying about the bible was being twisted.  For example the bible does give clues that Jesus was born in spring time. Shepherds were out at night with their flock when Jesus was born Luke 2:8.  Plus the angel Gabriel came to Mary IN THE SIXTH MONTH and not six months later and told Mary she would have a son and told Mary that her cousin Elizabeth was six months pregnant so look up the sixth month of the Jewish calender and add nine months for pregnancy and you will get around our march or april time when Jesus was born. Luke 1:26 - 37  Also Joseph and Mary wouldn't have traveled to Bethlahem from Marys home town Nazareth in the cold winter time much less other people wouldn't be traveling to Bethlehem to be taxed in the winter time because they didn't have heated cars Luke 2:1-7...thats why there was no room for them at the inn at Bethlehem because of all the out of town visitors for the taxation.  The wise men came into the HOUSE Matt 2:11 and offered thier gifts gold frankincense myrrh so the wise men didn't visit Jesus when he was born.  Once the wise men left, Joseph  was told to take Jesus and Mary to Egypt and everybody knows that it cost money to up and move so I bet Joseph and Mary used the Gold, Frankinsense, and Mryhh to pay for the cost to up and move to Egypt.  Once Herod saw that he was tricked by the wisemen, Herod wanted to keep his job as king and assumed that the King of the Jews would challenge him so Herod calculated when the star appeared to the wisemen and had to slay all the children from 2 yrs old and younger so no cave and no roman soldiers running around a cave when Jesus was born looking to kill him.  Mathew 2:16  Jospeh and Mary were poor because Mary could not afford to offer Sheep for her sin Luke 2:21-24  ....yes folks Mary was a sinner too...did you know Mary and Joseph lost Jesus for three days Luke 2:41-51....if a parent did that today Child Protection Services would be called on them.  The children of Israel gave honor and glory to the virgin who would give birth to the Christ Isaiah 7:14 but at the time they didn't know what her name was so that called her the Queen of Heaven and this made God very angry. Jer 44:15-23  Joseph and Mary were poor because instead offering sheep they offered two turtle doves for her sin offering after Jesus was born.  And the bible does talk about xmas trees as a heathen tradition Jer 10:1-5  So when the Lord ask me why I don't celebrate the rebirth of the sun...I'm going to point to the bible and not some man, church or corny movie and say its from what I read in the bible.",1454198400,10,2660,4.241584158415842

I expected a somewhat cheesy family Christmas movie produced by Christians trying to provide an alterative to worldly secular crap that grows increasingly more perverse as time goes on...oh... and this is exactly why I watched it. I am one of those Christians seeking ""critical"" entertainment. But this Christian Christmas movie was not a movie at all really. I don't know what to call it...a mocumentary maybe? (Movie+documentary) Anyway, parts of it were inspired and parts were derived and parts were awful! I guess you have to watch it to understand. I suggest parents watch it first to decide if they think this would be something they want to expose young children to. I'm glad that people are standing up to the powers that be and who are trying to create decent entertainment, so hats off to Liberty University and Kirk Cameron!

WITH my lowered expectations, it was easy for the movie to rise above them.  I usually dislike Kirk Cameron movies and typically have nothing but contempt for anything that can be branded as ""feel good"", but this one was alright.  Mind you I didn't say it was super great and everyone should watch it, but for me, the Santa Claus sequence was what made the movie.  So, is it worth buying?  That depends on you.

From the opening where Kirk addresses the audience directly while sitting next to a roaring fire, in front of a Christmas tree, pretending to drink cocoa out of an empty mug, all the way to the three hour Hip-hop dance sequence (I know, three hours in an 80 minute movie?  This proves that time is relative) the makers of this movie talk down to the audience and twist the bible to justify the way the Kirk Cameron celebrates Christmas.  (The Christmas tree is wood.  Do you know what else is wood?  Jesus' cross!  If you mind isn't blown, then you're clearly.... a rational human being.)

I love Christmas and I love my Christmas tree and decorations, but I recognize what traditions come from pagan rites and accept that.  Kirk will have none of that.  According to him, every modern tradition is straight out of the bible.  Kirk Cameron seems to use scripture the way that ISIS uses the Koran: twisting it to justify something.  Thankfully, he is not twisting it for evil... just stupidity as Cameron takes on his brother-in-law's Christmas cynicism armed only with his lack of charm and his talent for rationalization.

When fast-forwarding over the uber-long dance sequence (and you WILL want to fast-forward) you will still be able marvel at how gratingly long it is!

And the padding... this movie is padded so terribly, with some lines repeated 20 times (""I'm gonna be that guy...""), the token black man complaining about his boss getting rid of crazy-shirt Fridays (a story line that remains unresolved to this day), the never-ending dance sequence, and the long, pregnant pauses...

This movie could have been a half an hour.

And it's refreshing to be able to watch a movie with your family without cringing, wondering what's going to be said or done next.  Keep up the good work, Kirk.

As long as Jesus is put first, it doesn't matter what your traditions are. I love all the stuff that goes along with Christmas, but that is not what brings me joy.

The movie also mixes some exceedingly disparate components.

In terms of a film it is better than all the notoriously bad movies it is being compared to; the film has quality audio, editing, lighting and is generally fine in these aspects, I didn't much care for the acting in this film but it's a Christmas movie and cheesy dialogue goes with the territory.  As for the story; this is where I think that people give this movie most of the bad reviews, I didn't really care for the story all that much but I am also not the target audience of this film.  If your not religious and do not enjoy religious entertainment to reaffirm your religious beliefs then this movie is probably not for you.

7444927,5,B015N8JCK2,"Boy, oh boy, where do we begin?

You know a movie is going to be bad when the DVD pull quote is from Dr. Ben Carson.

Last year, former Growing Pains lead and current crocoduck/banana expert Kirk Cameron executive produced and starred in Saving Christmas, a film that will surely go down in history as the worst Christmas movie ever made. While profiting in its theatrical release ($2 million against a $500,000 budget), Saving Christmas gained notoriety for its insipid reception - a 0% Rotten Tomatoes rating that Cameron famously protested on Facebook and four Razzie Awards that director Darren Doane refuted on Twitter.

Cut to this year. Saving Christmas has finally made its way to home video, this time without the possessive ""Kirk Cameron's"" leading the title. Upon watching the film, I can see why Cameron no longer wants to possess it.

Out of the 80 minute runtime, only 50 minutes are dedicated to the actual storyline. Cameron (playing himself) needs less than an hour to condescendingly prove the benefits of holiday materialism to his brother-in-law Christian White (played by Doane).

So how does the film reach feature length?

Enter rotoscoped scenes of infanticide, hip-hop dance sequences, and the appearance of a Zack Synder-esque Santa Claus.

Not to be outdone, the film's grand finale arrives in the form of post-film outtakes that would make The Master of Disguise embarrassed. Highlights include one of the actors accusing Doane of secretly being a Jew and a crew member clapping his hands in front of Cameron's face because the crew did not have a slate for sync sound.

Kirk Cameron's Saving Christmas is destined to become the holiday season's go-to midnight cult movie. Check out the Cinema Snob's review for more information on this masterpiece (preferably while drinking hot chocolate).",1448496000,12,1819,5.080536912751678
7444928,4,B015N8JCK2,"I'd rather give this 2 or 3 stars, but I know people will down rate it just because it's Christian, so I figured 4 was fair.

I love Kirk Cameron. I appreciate what he's trying to do here, I really do. However, I found this movie extremely condescending to my point of view. I grew up with big Christmases. Santa was huge. We did LOTS of shopping. Christmas music, cinnamon candles, decorations, big tree, etc etc. If asked, we'd say ""Jesus is the reason for the season"". But I wasn't excited about Jesus being born, I was excited about all the other stuff. The presents I was giving and getting, the treats, the anticipation, etc. Jesus was more something we talked about a little so we could get to the good stuff.

As an adult, after my husband and I were saved, we had a big argument over Santa. He didn't believe in distracting our kids with the myth of Santa, and lying to them. After much debate, I lost. And I am so glad I did. After that, I started learning about the pagan roots for all the other Christmas traditions. I happen to feel like if I'm going to participate in a tradition, I need to believe in it 100%. So we gave up the trees, and everything else. We stopped the commercialism and materialism that controlled our Christmases of the past. Instead, on Thanksgiving we would give out homemade gifts, sharing our bounty. Canned jam from apricots, or whatever, we grew. Or crocheted items, homemade hot cocoa mix, etc. Some years we give these out on Dec 6th, St. Nicholas Day. We look up to the man and appreciate his contribution to our church history, so we honor him. We will not let the character Santa (who St. Nicholas would be appalled to learn he is associated with, btw) be the focus of our Christmas, however.

After a few years of being what some people may consider a Scrooge, simply because I want my Christmas to be all about Jesus, we started to let up. After all, Christ looks at our heart. We can still keep the focus on Christ and still own a Christmas tree, for instance. So, this will be the third year that we will have a tree again.  I am not trying to ruin anyone's Christmas. However, I still get extremely depressed this time of year seeing what ""Jesus' birthday"" has turned in to. The commercials, for instance, APPALLING. It's all about getting getting getting. It makes me sick. I do not contribute to the Christmas industry, that's just a choice I've made to vote with my wallet.

Then I go to watch this movie, thinking you were going to show some good reasons why we should just live and let live, and not get so upset about all the pagan stuff, materialism, etc, that has completely taken over Christmas. Instead, in this film Kirk is completely arrogant. Totally patronizing any of us who dare to choose not to celebrate Christmas the way he thinks we should. The ""skeptic character"" his brother in law, comes off as totally irrational, judgemental, grumpy- and Kirk just gives him this smirk during the entire film that says ""oh you silly little boy, you're so wrong about everything and I'm right and I'll prove it to you in two simple anecdotes!"". And of course, after learning how bad a** the real St. Nick was, suddenly the skeptic doesn't care about all the distractions taking away from Jesus and he's THE MOST yuletide-filled person in the whole wide world!!!!

I guess as much as I wanted to like this movie, I just couldn't get past the condescension from Kirk. For instance, the Christmas story is simply a foreshadowing of the Resurrection story. Jesus comes wrapped in swaddling cloth (the cloth that Joseph and Mary would have worn on them during a journey, because in case they died they'd need to be wrapped. That was customary back then), and born in a cave, laying in a stone manger. Just as Jesus is buried in swaddling cloth, in a tomb, upon a rock. Anyone who does their homework would probably figure that out. However, Kirk says to the viewer about the Nativity scene (to paraphrase) 'I don't think you even know why this scene is so special, you think it's important because baby Jesus is in it. You're wrong'  because apparently if we disagree with Kirk about Christmas, we don't know as much about it as he does...? Patronizing much?

I am disappointed. This movie could have looked at both views and reconciled them, and maybe said that it's okay no matter what your views are on Christmas. The most important thing is we celebrate Christ's incarnation. But no. The movie ends with the skeptic character telling his wife he's so so so sorry, he's really ruined everything, and to make it up to her he will be the most pro-Christmas guy ever. Basically he was the bad guy, until he changed his opinion to match Kirk's. Now he's a good guy.",1448409600,2,4717,4.528169014084507

7444970,4,B015N8JCK2,"This movie has so many fake review both on both sides which honestly is lame.

Before I wrote a review I wanted to make sure that I had seen it since I live in Utah and am LDS, a movie like this gets little attention here in Utah so I had to wait until it came out on DVD. The makers clearly don't like my faith (based on interviews I have seen) but I can look past that because of all of the good that they do and wish them all well in their mission to bring people to the Savior. I happen to love Christian cinema even though they may not my like my faith. However nothing in it was said in contrary to my faith.

When I decided to write this review I wanted to write it from the heart and not from the propaganda and garbage spread by others.

When my wife and I watched it she said ""Feels to me more like a Sunday school lesson, more than a Christmas movie"" this reminds me of many of the religion videos that I watched growing up.

The only thing I did not like was the weird rant in the middle about conspiracy theories. Which was totally dumb not funny, and just got kind of corny at the end with the party.

Symbolism is a dead language and they do a really good job at showing various symbolism. I loved his comparison of the trees and how they relate to what would be done for us by the Savior. Funny thing is that in Jeremiah 10:3 - 5 warns against worshiping trees decked with silver and gold that are nailed to the floor. (which was not mentioned in the movie) I think what was meant by these verses is that we should not worship the trees as an idol, don't worry I still like Christmas trees. The people of ancient Israel were very disobedient and had come from an idol worshiping nation, Egypt. They had to be told everything they could or could not do and they probably were worshiping trees instead of using them in any symbolic way. If you recall in the Bible the staff with the serpent that Moses raised up in the wilderness eventually had to be destroyed by the prophet because the people were worshiping the serpent as an idol even thought that was a representation of Christ. There really is symbolism in the trees and how they relate to my beliefs. There is also symbolism in ancient temples as was discussed in the movies in regards to trees and decorating trees as in the Garden of Eden.

As for the St. Nicholas thing, I don't personally believe in the Nicene Creed, however, it was the hand of God in preserving Christianity through the centuries, so it was kind of eye opener when it was said that St. Nicholas fought to save the doctrine of the deity of Christ.

As for a movie it is not very good, as for a documentary helping us understand beliefs it is a decent movie. The non religious stuff with the rap in the middle about conspiracy theories and the dance at the end were too silly and were lame. If those were different it would have received 5 stars. So the movie is not as bad as was said.

I can see it being a great movie to watch at home but can see where watching in the theater might leave something to be desired.
