8177025,4,B000NDFI5G,"I have to add this review since my impression is that the other reviewers here were expecting something much more mainstream and polished - perhaps a  Hollywood product - than the items on offer here.  Two of the three movies here would be perfect fits in any 70's and 80's inner city grindhouse, while the third truly is useless filler.

The first film, ""Naked Amazon"", was a 50's style shockumentary about a group of overly coiffed white folks heading deep into the Amazon jungle.  While the film is neither shocking nor entirely true, as a historical document it's worth a watch.  This was one of the precursors to Mondo (along with ""Of the Dead"") which certainly makes it worthy of addition to any completist's collection.  I could see this playing a triple bill with ""Savage Man, Savage Beast"" and ""Kwaheri"" as the third feature - not as good as the other two, but on the same bill anyway.

In fact, the second feature here - ""White Slave"" - is directed by none other than Prospieri himself, one half of the Giacopetti / Prospieri team behind the Mondo craze (collected on Blue Underground's Mondo Cane Collection).  Originally released as ""Cannibal Holocaust 2"" (that should give you some idea of the content and context) it features lots of blood and cannibal hijinks, with plenty of Italo-sleaze toplessness.  What's not to like?  Honestly, if you like cannibal films, or if you like bad movies, you'll like this picture.  I did.  It's not a very good transfer, full screen and with some artifacts, but this is probably the only DVD release it'll see.  Cannibal Holocaust 2?  It's nowhere as good as the Deodato original, but it still delivers a few blunt shocks and ridiculously overacted adventure.  This is the best movie in the collection.  (EDIT:  I found this as a single disc edition, under a different title&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/here/dp/B0009S2KJW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">here</a>, but as of this writing it's more expensive than this three-pack, albeit in widescreen, if that justifies the price difference to you.)

The third feature is a student film and an absolute waste of time, not a theatrical release, not even shot on film but on hand held video cam.  It's too bad it was even included here, since the collection, odd as it sounds, would be stronger with just the two old features.  This is an utterly unwatchable dollar-store item which apparently never even got distribution - I don't know why it's included here.

But getting the other two movies for the price is worth it.  If you collect grindhouse or shockumantries, this is worth a spot in your collection.

That being said, if this review made no sense to you (""Who's Prospieri?  Isn't 'grindhouse' the name of a movie by Tarantino?""), you'll probably agree with the other two reviews...",1193788800,29,2828,5.006423982869379
