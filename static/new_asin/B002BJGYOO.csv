8361484,3,B002BJGYOO,"If you want to know about the Stone Age, this is your disc--right down to the stones themselves! Hugh Newman covers everything from how stones were moved to how they figure into the science of earth energy. There are also references for several books you can follow up with if you want to go even further.",1252368000,2,305,4.464285714285714
8361485,4,B002BJGYOO,"A well thought out documentary of the many aspects of crop circles and ancients stones.  The uses and affects of these items are interesting and vast. Possible?  Maybe.  Interesting?  Definitely!  The tie-ins to fertility, poison and many aspects of earth's energies are described in appropriate detail.  It was a little far reaching for me at times and not enough scientific backup but entertaining none the less.  Recommended movie and well worth an hour of your time.",1250121600,3,470,5.105263157894737
