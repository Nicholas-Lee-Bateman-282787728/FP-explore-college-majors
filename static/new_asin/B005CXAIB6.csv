8466002,4,B005CXAIB6,"I found this to be an excellent training reference. The information is presented in a straightforward and consistent manner. The video production quality is no-frills, with the focus on the content. There is a DVD chapter for the start of each set for easy access. Each of the ten sets is presented on its own, followed by its applications and interpretations to put it in perspective. Everything is demonstrated and presented by Sifu Rick, whose expertise is highly evident and inspirational. The video format allowed me to control the pace of instruction and analyze details, often by watching a segment over and over until I could see some aspect the way I needed to. This is not always easy to do in a live class environment. It's also great when you're just trying to remember how the third move in the first half of set #4 goes.

After learning the first set I immediately experienced some of the benefits of training on the dummy. Specifically, I saw a benefit in my footwork (split triangle), which might seem surprising (it was to me), but as one learns in the training, effective body movement and positioning are incredibly important foundations. Of course, there's a lot more than just footwork in these JKD dummy sets. The dummy training has definitely improved my trapping game in a number of ways, and it's great to have a wide range of useful and interesting drills I can practice when a partner is not available.",1311724800,,1429,4.762096774193548
