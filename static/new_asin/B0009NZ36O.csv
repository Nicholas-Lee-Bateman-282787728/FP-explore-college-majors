2303619,4,B0009NZ36O,A very enyoyable series. The Bad.... Double sided DVDs are prone to damage while handling.. The Good....a bonus MRS Columbo..which is really fun to watch. I wonder how many were produced and if more are on the way. Worth the money,1123804800,3,230,4.634146341463414
2303620,3,B0009NZ36O,"I could not agree with ""MarxBrothers3"" more...Universal is capitalizing on the adoration and willingness of Columbo fans to cough up the bucks for any episode we can get our hands on. But where are the interviews with Peter Falk? Where are all the extras we can expect in almost any DVD collection? Every DVD I've purchased has trailers, promos, out takes, bloopers, interviews, some even have commentary from the stars, which I believe all Columbo fans would love! Even the packaging is sub-par...one gets the feeling Universal is taking the ""bare-minimum"" approach, to minimize costs and maximize profits. Please, this review is meant to get back to the corporate decision makers at Universal: START OFFERING THE FANS WHAT WE EXPECT AND DESERVE! I am deliberately giving this only 3 stars, but thats because of Universal...Peter Falk, Richard Levinson and William Link get 3 million stars in my book.",1123632000,13,902,5.101351351351352
2303621,2,B0009NZ36O,"Beware that Universal is out to fleece fans of ""Columbo"".  I have seasons 1-5 and seasons 2-5 are cheaply produced. No frills, no extras. Just the episodes. You will also see characters later in an episode that you should have met earlier, but that meeting is cut out. There is the classic episode with Janet Leigh in which she and her butler are beating on the door of the bedroom where her husband lies dead. However, they never enter the room, that part is cut out. The scene cuts to the arrival of homocide detective Columbo...with no dead body in sight yet because it was cut out. Universal also did this with the classic Burt Lancaster Western ""Valdez is Coming"" in which they cut out nearly 20 minutes.  The series guest stars are a who's who of a Hollywood long passed. You will see Janet Leigh, Jack Cassidy, John Payne, Forrest Tucker, Dick Van Dyke, William Shatner, Robert Culp and so many more great old stars. But...be warned...Universal is all about getting your money out of your pocket and into their hands. They could care less what they give you in return. The Columbo episodes they have released as ""complete and uncut"" are actually syndication cut episodes. I contacted Universal, the FTC, and several other governmental consumer protection departments; no one cares what the giant Universal releases.
This show is worth so much more than the cheap treatment it is being given by Universal.  The price for the set is still as high priced as most of the other shows being offered season by season, yet it is produced terribly 'on the cheap'.  Reason? Because the studio knows it can get by with it.",1123459200,13,1618,4.686619718309859
2303622,5,B0009NZ36O,"Peter Falk returns in his four-time Emmy-winning role as the understated and rumpled police lieutenant in Columbo Season Three. This collection includes all 15 TV hours of the third season plus a bonus episode of the TV show Mrs. Columbo.

We love watching Columbo on TV when we can catch it, but better yet we can have them to watch anytime now. There are a variety of guest stars that you'll recognize (Martin Sheen, Vincent Price, Deidre Hall, Jackie Cooper and more).

Hours of entertainment!",1123372800,,496,4.823529411764706
2303623,5,B0009NZ36O,"The third season of columbo is arguably the best season. Columbo really got big and the stories get so much suspense build up, but the way columbo solves the cases is just classic. I was real happy that they are finally going to release it come August. I can't wait to get a hold of mine. Nothing beats watching the third season on a big screen while eating popcorn. If you like Columbo but don't know what season to get, this is the one to get. Any Old Port In A Storm is undoubtley one of the top two episodes. A Friend In Deed, Canidate for Crime, Swan Song with the other J.C., the beloved Johnny Cash, and Double Exposure make this season worth getting just for those episodes.",1122422400,7,682,4.294573643410852
2303624,5,B0009NZ36O,"What can be said of Season 3? Let's break it down, shall we?

3.1 Lovely But Lethal

Not my favorite episode, but still features some great moments. And who can deny Vera Miles her beauty, charm, and sophistication? Did you know that Miles was Alfred Hitchcock's first choice to play Madeline in Vertigo?

3.2 Any Old Port In A Storm

This is held by many Columbo fans - including those who frequent the Ultimate Columbo Site - as the all time best Columbo episode ever. While its not my personal favorite, it is within my top 3 and I can easily see why this would get top ranking by some. It is a masterpiece. Falk is absolutely amazing, Donald Pleasence is just as good. And the story makes you want to go out and pick up a bottle of port!

3.3 Candidate For Crime

Ah, Nelson Hayward and his camel hair sports coat. Jackie Cooper makes an excellent Columbo killer, as well as a great politician! He schmoozes everyone, including his wife and girlfriend, like a pro. As usual, Columbo is great in this, and his pestering gets under the skin of Hayward like no one else, pushing Hayward to tell him that he likes Columbo a lot, but that he's a busy man and doesn't have time to fool around. Great moments are when Columbo goes to the shop to get fitted for a coat and later when, during the taping of a political commercial, Columbo absent-mindedly makes too much noise by clanging the victim's watch against an umbrella poll to prove how indestructible it is. Classic!

3.4 Double Exposure

Can you say, double your pleasure? This is definitely one of my top favorite 3 episodes. Robert Culp is back as Doctor Kepple, a highly organized and anal retentive research scientist specializing in cognitive science, and gives a stellar performance. But aside from the top knotch acting and tense character relationships (which includes one of the relatively few times where Columbo comes right out and tells the killer he believes they're guilty of homicide) is the story itself: subliminal cuts, mind games, and beating the killer at his own game make for some intriguing story here. Top knotch all the way. The ending is second to none, perhaps the best one yet. Doctor Kepple is so proud of his abilities, he is almost proud of having gotten caught by his own method! This is a must see episode.

3.5 Publish Or Perish

Jack Cassidy is back! The second victim (who is the first killer) is creepy with a capital ""c"", but it adds to the nature of his character. Cassidy himself is on fire the whole time, playing a great drunk in one scene and a charming gentleman caller in another. The ending is pretty good, not my favorite, but good.

3.6 Mind Over Mayhem

This isn't my favorite story but the cast boasts of a favorite of mine from my childhood - Robert Walker, the little guy who played the ""bad"" Hulk twin in the Incredible Hulk TV series. The victim's wife is a knock-out, which isn't a bad deal, either. I do like the killer's method though... very good alliby!

3.7 Swan Song

Ahh, the one and only Johnny Cash, God rest his soul. If there was ever a killer for whom you could feel bad, it is Cash's Tommy Brown. Cash plays music, wears black, and kicks back as a killer who was caught in a corner and gave it to a woman who deserved it! This is one episode I know a lot of people treasure.

3.8 A Friend In Deed

This is perhaps my all time favorite episode. Columbo nabs his boss! It happens to be the first episode I ever saw. Richard Kiley is fantastic as Commissioner Halperin, John Finnegan is top knotch as Lt. Dryer, Michael McGuire is chilling as Hugh Caldwell, and Val Avery is second to none (not even Falk) as Artie Jessup. The characters in this are so well developed, it makes for great TV right there. But the story itself is great and the ending... I can't give it away. He nabs him SO BAD its not even funny! Fantastic! Classic lines: ""Are you crazy, I ain't goin' to no roller derby"" - Artie Jessup.

Season 3 is worth adding to your collection.",1121644800,125,3970,4.453793103448276
2303625,5,B0009NZ36O,"I have been a Columbo fan since I was a wee lil lad and jumped at the first two seasons when they came out on DVD.  And I expect I will when season three comes out as well.  However I 'cringe' at the notice that season three contains only two discs.  The run time is actually longer than season two (which has four discs) so I can only imagine that they are releasing these as double sided discs... which I can definately live with (I mean, hey, it's still Columbo one way or another).. but it doesn't mean I have to like it.  Universal: please respect fans of these great TV shows that you are releasing.

2303626,5,B0009NZ36O,"The original run of Columbo, staring Peter Falk, ran on NBC as part of the Sunday Mystery Movie. Columbo was one of four programs that aired on alternating weeks along with McCloud and McMillan and Wife. Unlike many of the cop shows from the 70's that are now showing up on DVD box sets, like S.W.A.T. or Baretta, Columbo holds up. The writing, by the likes of Steven Bochco, and the direction, which includes early efforts from Steven Spielberg were among the best television has produced. The guest stars regularly included Oscar winning greats. Best of all is Peter Falk as a man who appears to be less than he is. Columbo is one of the finest shows in the history of televison.",1117065600,46,681,4.544715447154472

The guest stars are all top notch and all play great opposite Peter Falk as the unorthodox, cheap cigar-smoking police lieutenant in the iconic trench coat, driving the battered jalopy. One of the more notable episodes in season three is ""Candidate for Crime"" ( directed by Boris Sagal) with Jackie Cooper as a senatorial candidate who kills his campaign manager and tries to make it look like a case of mistaken identity. A young Katey Sagal (Boris' daughter and the future Mrs. Peg Bundy from Married... with Children) has a small part in that one. Another notable episode here is ""A Friend in Deed"" with Richard Kiley as a police commissioner who covers up for a friend who killed his wife and then has the friend return the favor by aiding him an alibi for a murder of his own. If you're going to own just one season of Columbo, the third season is my pick as the one that best captures the essence of this classic series.",1461542400,,1040,4.537234042553192

Columbo is the finest and most entertaining series of this genre, and it has certainly stood the test of time. Although the fashions have changed, and police work has become more scientific, I prefer watching a true detective solve the crime by using his brain. Portraying an air of disorganization and incompetence, Columbo successfully lures the criminals into a false sense of superiority and security. Meanwhile, as they let their guard down, the Lieutenant skilfully ties up any loose ends and brings the hammer down when least expected. A master of the game, Peter Falk is superb and I dare say we will never see the likes of him again.

2303750,5,B0009NZ36O,"I didn't like the double sided discs, but it's worth putting up with because this is one of the best seasons of Columbo,. I think early Columbo showed more of the detective setting up a surprise for the killer than latter ones did. One of my favorites  ""A Friend In Deed"" is one of those set-ups--also one with some excellent acting, not only Richard Kiley as the arrogant police commissioner, but also  Val Avery, the character actor who plays Artie Jessup. Another one where Columbo sets a clever trap for the killer is fan-favorite, ""Any Old Port In A Storm"", with Donald Pleasance about a vintner, with Columbo proving a quick study in wine, a natural  oenophile,

This is also the season with  ""Swan Song"" starring Johnny Cash as a sympathetic ""man in black"" country singer who kills his overbearing wife.(Added bonus: Cash sings and plays guitar).  Falk has some nice moments here where he just looks at Cash and you can see his heart isn't in apprehending this guy, but he has to do his job.

Some of my favorite actors appear in this season. In addition to Kiley, there's Jackie Cooper, perfectly cast as a politician (""Candidate for Crime"");  Robert Walker Jr. in a complex father-son story ""Mind Over Mayhem"" with Jose Ferrer,  and Robert Culp playing a less forceful-than-usual, intelligent but soft spoken scientist in ""Double Exposure""--perfect cat and mouse with Columbo.

Other good episodes include Jack Cassidy in ""Publish or Perish"" as his usual cold, ruthless charmer--with a cameo by real-life crime novelist Mickey Spillane and Vera Miles as the head of a beauty empire.  For my money, this is one of the best seasons.",1433808000,4,1639,4.838709677419355

2303783,5,B0009NZ36O,"Recently, I enjoyed watching a few Columbo episodes and I believe I understand why the television series is still considered good television viewing.  Although, Lt. Columbo (starring Peter Falk) deliberately practiced unhurried questioning, appeared in a crumpled raincoat and worn shoes, smoked a day old cigar, and consistently squinted his eyes (i.e. Peter Falk actually possessed one glass eye), which all of the noted facets attributed to his character, I contend many of us also cherished the noted series due to his non-coerced kindness.  Despite investigating homicides cases, Lieutenant Columbo was consistently pleasant, personable, and respectful (i.e. Thank you, maam, Sorry to bother you sir, etc.) when questioning suspects.
In the 70s, prior to the age of heavily relying on computers, texting, folks demanding immediate gratification, and continuously advocating the right to live in a boundary less society, most of us actually enjoyed lowering the volume and demonstrating proper social etiquettes (as abovementioned).  The described pleasantries predictably indicated an exchange of wellness, goodwill to everyone concern, and considered mutually beneficial for a myriad of reasons.  Specifically, despite Lt. Columbo questioning a possible murder suspect or an accomplice, he routinely engaged in good natured chit chat, which undoubtedly made all of his suspects at least feel like a human being.  Needless to say, besides the described politeness, the entire Columbo series comes across as smooth, cleverly acted, and relatively easy on the eyes and ears (you never see any of the victims blood, virtually no cursing, and he does not carry a weapon).
Notably, if you are a Vincent Price, Vera Miles, Donald Pleasance or even a young Martin Sheen fan, you will enjoy viewing Season 3.  Although, Price does not specifically play a villain, it was a pleasure watching his performance.  My favorite Columbo episode is featured on Season 5, which is entitled, Now You See Him.  Besides Peter Falk, the noted episode also features respectively Bob Dishy (Sgt. John J. Wilson) and Jack Cassidy (The Great Santini).  Without giving away the plot, Cassidy plays an intriguing and devilish character.  Admittedly, I have viewed the noted episode several times and it never disappoints.
Lastly, throughout my life, when I would chit chat with my grandmother she would frequently conclude our discussion by stating, Remember, its nice to be nice.  When developing the Columbo role, I am truly convinced that Peter Falk provided his input on what type of image he desired to project on television.  Needless to say, in my opinion, he adopted the appropriate persona and attitude for his impressive and long lasting character.  Moreover, after four decades, the Columbo television series continues to greatly entertain his fans.  Thus, based on his decision to significantly attribute to the viewing public, the actor Peter Falks body of work is always welcomed into my abode.",1423353600,2,2985,5.405172413793103

Child sex abuse,groupies, adultery and domestic violence are handled with tact and class. The points are made without being vulgar. The episodes aired on network TV in the 70's.  Both are very well written. Did the writers win any Emmys? I must admit, I was hoping Johnny Cash got away. You see why celebreties and people of prominence feel they can get away with murder.
Now, the bad news. Universal Studios should be ashamed for putting out bargain bin quality discs. There is no inner leaflet describing each episode. No pictures or anything on the discs.

2304182,5,B0009NZ36O,"Columbo's third season is the mid-point of the original series.  Not surprisingly one of the most enduring characters in TV history reaches his peak.  There are still the elements of the series intact.  His clever methods are basically the same, and the murderers showcase a variety of deceptive genius.  It is the quality of this harvest that makes Season Three so special:  Every episode is intricate and expertly honed; the developments are more edgy and tightly woven; and the resolutions are more suspenseful than before or since.  Palpably, the craftsmanship makes the audience feel caught in every caper.  Arguably, the performances and writing overall are the strongest of the whole series.

Jack Cassidy and Robert Culp* renew their appearances in episodes that keep us guessing.  Particularly, the one with Cassidy, has edgy editing--more like today's movies and shows--that keeps us on our toes.  (He co-stars with Mickey Spillane about a washed-up co-writer in ""Publish or Perish"".)  Similarly, Culp's meticulous and cantankerous character outshines his previous efforts in 'Double Exposure,' where he commits a seemingly insurmountable subliminal crime.  Jose' Ferrar also guest stars as a protective father who kills a colleague who will expose his son's prize winning plagiarism in ""Mind over Mayhem"".

Columbo's legwork is more clever and multi-faceted in ""Lovely but Lethal,"" where Vera Miles (of 'Psycho' fame) plays a cosmetics entreprenuer who must squelch an inventor employee blackmailing her fortune for his expertise.  Both the actress's and characters nervous brilliance keep up the caliber of the season.  (Oddly, yet likably, Vincent Price makes a guest appearance, drawing from the debonair roles he mastered rather than the villains.)  Less complicated is the murder of one brother of a family wine business in ""Any Old Port in a Storm"".  Starring Donald Pleasance as wine conoisseur and purveyor, Cossantini, we get so lost in his character, we easily forget the plot has less strings attached.  (This episode understandably plays one of the most in syndication.)

Nearly as likable is Johnny Cash's appearance as a country music star, Tommy Brown, who has more more baggage than Cash:  Besides trading in June Carter for an insufferably domineering wife (played effectively enough by Ida Lupino who blackmails him for her ministry projects), he is also a clever murderer.  (He smiles in concert and is boorish backstage, creating a natural performance with key distances between himself and his character.  Still, his musical abilities are intact.)  Columbo's investigation this episode is particularly sharp.  Jackie Cooper is superbly slick in ""Candidate in Crime,"" where a politician faces a would-be informant with killer information.

Probably his most difficult case, ""Mind over Mayhem,"" finds Columbo solving a crime he knows the Police Commissioner committed.  Played with toughness by Richard Kiley, and including a key performance by gangsters, we get a ""rat race"" episode before Scorsese did ""The Departed"".  An admirably rougher atmosphere is presented this time.

Viewing Season Three of 'Columbo' is a real joy.  The variety of circumstances, the suspense, and craftsmanship, make this set of episodes particularly consistent and compelling.  While blackmail is a key thread with most of the motives, the crimes and cover-ups are expertly defined.

(*Did they get out on parole?  Seriously, they play new murderers this time.)

(As sweet as Kate Mulgrew is, the tacked on episode of 'Mrs. Columbo' is lamer than any other presented.  They make two connections: She actually mentions her lieutenant husband and Donald Pleasance guest stars.  His purposely bumbling performance only underscores wasted resources.)",1179014400,7,3756,5.461805555555555

This should be like a recall with no questions asked.  If I had to do it over I would not buy the third season.

With all that said, the episodes are just great.",1161388800,18,448,3.7127659574468086
2304201,4,B0009NZ36O,"The one thing that I always liked about the series is that the murderous culprits were always ""uber-successful"" and had much to lose by NOT committing the crime. Of course, the statement is not my endorsement of murder as a means to an end; it was just cool to see those people that we think ""have it all"" resort to doing away with their fellow man (or woman).

This third season DVD compilation shares the same double-sided disc format of the previous second season's collection. Unfortunately, it includes an installment of Kate Mulgrew's lamentable ""Mrs. Columbo."" Though the show came after these ""Columbo"" episodes, it looks more dated, with the filming techniques, as well as the awful scoring and writing.

Fortunately, for the actress, she would achieve greater success as ""Captain Janeway"" on ""Star Trek: Voyager.""

The ""Columbo"" episodes, on the other hand, are some of the best of the show's entire run. Vera Miles, an actress that I have long admired, gets to glamorously chew scenery with the likes of Vincent Price and young Martin Sheen in the wickedly delicious ""Lovely but Lethal"". Film veteran Donald Pleasance hams it up marvelously as a snooty winemaker that ""liquidates"" his younger half-brother (Gary Conway of ""Land of the Giants"") in the cleverly titled ""Any Old Port in a Storm"". This episode also features Vito Scotti, a friend of star Peter Falk that has appeared in many ""Columbo's"" over the years, including ""Swan Song"", also among this compilation.

In ""Candidate for Crime"" former child star Jackie Cooper plays a politician saddled with a less-than-desirable campaign manager that decides to put a permanent end to their political relationship. Robert Culp, one of television's best actors, returns for a THIRD time as a perpetrator in ""Double Exposure,"" also featuring Robert Middleton and Louise Latham.

Oscar winner Jose Ferrer stars in possibly the ""weakest"" of the episodes, ""Mind Over Mayhem,"" though it features a sly tribute to Steven Spielberg, the director of the first episode of the show.  Also, the guest star roster includes screen veteran Lew Ayres (the theatrical ""Dr. Kildare"" series) and a young Jessica Walter (""Arrested Development"").

But the most ingenious use of guest stars and writing belong to ""Publish or Perish,"" the previously mentioned ""Swan Song,"" and ""A Friend in Deed"". Jack Cassidy, another fine actor that appeared in several episodes, is in the first, again playing someone in the publishing field, as he had in the Spielberg-directed ""Murder by the Book."" ""Swan Song"" stars the underrated ACTOR Johnny Cash as a COUNTRY gospel singer. Film star and television directing legend Ida Lupino plays his shrewish wife. Finally, Broadway veteran Richard Kiley gets the most inspired role of all, playing Columbo's police commissioner boss that murders his wife.

And composer Billy Goldenberg would provide most of the brilliant scores for the third season.

This is a stellar season, marred by Universal's decision to include ""Mrs. Columbo"" and failure to offer any other extras that DVD buyers have come to expect.",1158364800,8,3079,5.154308617234469
2304202,4,B0009NZ36O,"The series was really hitting its stride, here. Great villains like Jose Ferrer and Jack Cassidy, who are delightfully condescending, Johnny Cash in one of my favorites, and Donald Pleasance at his snobbiest. The episode with Robert Culp is another all time favorite, and shows clearly how well Columbo can set a trap. From the vantage point of the foresic fan, the level of police work is startling; Columbo is always dragging evidence out of his coat pockets wrapped in a newspaper. Low marks for procedure.

But that was never the main draw, anyway; the delight in is in the cat and mouse games. Peter Falk is nearly perfect as the humble detective with the keen eye for discrepancies and his extensive knowledge of human nature. The villains plan the perfect crime, and rarely see what has tripped them up until too late.

The DVD package is where it loses a star. The chapter settings are very skimpy, and the menus are basic. Our mid-level DVD player sometimes stutters, and once, so far, froze outright. But they have been transferred with some care, not too dark unless it was meant to be, and the soundtrack is well leveled. All the glory that was '70's era decorating comes through in deep greens and vivid oranges. Talk about a crime!

In sum, a nice, if basic, package for Columbo fans.",1156809600,12,1298,4.684210526315789

That said, however, it's nothing short of criminal that several of these episodes are NOT presented in their original full length. From the first season DVD set, actress Barbara Rhodes is missing from ""A Lady In Waiting"". Even worse, a key scene in a recording studio with Columbo and an engineer is missing from the famous ""Swan Song"" episode with Johnny Cash, from the third season. And I've found large scene deletions in at least two other favorite episodes on other season DVDs. These shameful practices are characteristic of most American conglomerates like GE-NBC-Universal that consistently show that their regard for their customers is even lower than that of their own substandard merchandise.

I had absolutely NO problem viewing the double sided discs. There were no skips or freezes. Maybe the problem has been corrected by the manufacturer of the dvd's but I really think that you can buy with confidence. My second ""bad rap"" is the episode of Mrs. Columbo that is a bonus feature on the set. Any episode with ventriloquist dummies freaks me out (since I watched Twilight Zone and ""Dead Of Night"". I think that this episode (although probably misplaced on this set) is well worth a watch. All in all, the collection is well worth the purchase and no collection would be complete without it.

Too many times when I buy or rent a DVD movie with two sided disks I tend to have skips. I'd suspect my DVD player but I have three of them and there is major skipping on any of my hardware I use.

There is only one episode called ""Double Exposure"" where Columbo was talking with the murderer in his office that the screen ""frozed up"" for 2-3 min.  That's the only reason I deducted one star from the ratings.  Otherwise, the other 8 episodes including bonus ran great with no faults.  As for the music or others, I can't comment on that.  The picture quality was great just like the old shows.  Having English subtitle as closed captioned on all episodes is the main thing that I care about which I sorely missed from the old shows on television.

However, when watching episodes clustered together like this, I find the series a little predictable now. A murder is committed, the murderer makes a mistake and leaves a clue, Columbo arrives and spots the clue -- all of this in the first 15 minutes -- and then spends the rest of the show proving his theory in conjunction with the guest star and the usual bevy of Universal Studios contract players. It would have been nice for a little more variety. And by now, things were edging towards the silly, like the use of a robot to program a computer in one of the eps on this set. But I don't mean to be too hard on the series, since it remains very entertaining and fun to watch.

I gave it four stars instead of five for a few reasons: the formula plot structure, and the fact that Universal released these on double-sided discs. The opinions of the reviewer below advising people to stop whining and buy a quality DVD player aside, Universal's double-sided discs have some serious quality issues and the best player in the world won't solve those. I have nothing against the media in theory, but if you're a major studio releasing product then the media better work for most people. Sometimes these just don't, and that's a problem. Plus the relative lack of extras on the entire series -- this set does contain an episode of the gawdawful spinoff series ""Mrs. Columbo"", though why they chose to include that I don't know; it is atrociously bad -- continues to detract from these releases.

Anyway, if you're a Columbo fan, settle in and enjoy. There are plenty of worse ways to spend your time on a winter's night.",1139097600,13,1867,4.537091988130563

The guest stars this season are among the best and include such luminaries as Vincent Price, Jackie Cooper, Robert Culp, and in my favorite episode of all, Johnny Cash. The interaction between Falk and Cash in ""Swan Song"" is some of the most perfect cinema ever filmed.

Columbo is amazing for its ability to show the audience the crime being committed and make the suspenseful element of the plot be how exactly he will figure out the homicide; I think this concept is exclusive to the series, and if it has been revisited elsewhere it could never rival Peter Falk as the bedraggled genius Lieutenant.

I gave the set five stars for the content of the episodes. I agree with others that some extras would be most welcome, and hope that in the future new releases will have a modicum of interesting material for the true Columbophile.",1132876800,6,1011,4.771428571428571

Now, it is wonderful that these shows appear on DVD, and best of all, you do not have to put up with commercials! Season 3 is by far the best one, containing some excellent episodes! ""Lovely But Lethal"" examines the cut-throat world of cosmetics, in which a beautiful seductress will stop at nothing to be number one. My favorite episode: ""Any Old Port In a Storm,"" concerns Columbo matching wits with a charming but obsessed wine connisuer. Columbo is very clever in concocting a trap for the killer in this one! My other favorite episode is ""Swan Song,"" which features the late Johnny Cash as a greedy Gospel singer determined to rid himself of his overbearing wife. And, finally, ""A Friend Indeed"" pits Columbo against his boss in a double murder mystery. The four other episodes are just as excellent, and as usual Peter Falk delivers an exceptional performance. This set also includes a bonus pilot episode of ""Mrs. Columbo,"" which I have not seen yet, but I am sure will be good.)

Overall the picture quality is excellent compared to what was on VHS and TV. The biggest headache is Universal's complex method of allowing you to access the episode. I am disappointed that Universal continues to add advertising that is very difficult to bypass once it starts up. What is insulting is that a lot of this advertising becomes outdated rather quickly and you are stuck with it. Another sad feature is the use of double sided disks. Side 1 and 2 are hard to see since the wording is so small allowing you to put the wrong side on.

In this series he delves into the worlds of publishing,politics, the cosmetics industry, country and western (an episode featuring Johnny Cash),and science, and always gets his man (or woman).

This series includes my all-time favourite episode 'any Old Port in a Storm' featuring wonderful Donald Pleasance as a wine producer who murders his half-brother to stop him selling off the family vinyards.  His battle of wits with Columbo is a delight to watch, espeically the climax in the restaurant, when Pleasance goes ballistic when he's served a bottle of port that has been ruined by overheating.  And it also features the best line in the whole series, when Pleasance realises that he is going to prison, but won't have to marry his blackmailing secretary ""freedom is relative"" he observes as Columbo pours him a glass of wine.

There is a bonus episode of the spin-off series 'Mrs Columbo', which I had never seen before, and if you haven't seen it before either I'm here to tell you that you haven't missed much.  I simply did not believe in this Mrs Columbo at all, she was nothing like I'd imagined her being, it's my belief she's an imposter.

He was a natural for this part usually playing against some big stars of the time. Why the perpetrators keep talking to Columbo every time he shows up is silly but then there would be no show if they all lawyered up.  In season three he has a line that almost made fall on the floor with laughter when he tells a NTSB agent he hates heights, ""I don't like being this tall"", Mr. Falk is a short man. Why double sided discs? They play fine but are they too cheap to use one or two more dics? This has been done with The Bob Newhart Show also. Classic shows as these deserve better treatment. To all dvd manufactures the best way to release these shows is to use the thin plastic cases put in a box like Lost In Space or Taxi or That Seventies Show. If there is a defect in the packaging it is easy to replace the cases. Everybody Loves Raymond uses a system that looks like a book that opens up using hard plastic.

First off - the packaging.  The S1 Columbo episode used a higher gauge cardboard with higher gloss.  The S3 set's outer package feels thin and flimsy.  It is very obvious that they have cut back in quality.  This extends to the plastic hardshell cases that the discs are in.  They feel thinner and cheaper.  The paper insert is also sort of plain and uninteresting.  It really does seem like some super-cheap set that some guy pressed in his basement with generic plastic cases and printouts from Photoshop on an Inkjet.

Sadly, this lack of quality spills over into the actual DVDs.  Firstly, these are double sided discs.  I'm no fan of this kind of disc.  It always seems that the quality of a double sided disc is iffy at best.  For this production it definitely hurt because I have had 3 different DVD players balk on 2 different sets (I returned the first set because the disc just would not play).

And - worst of all - the actual mastering of the shows have some definite problems.  In almost every episode there are points where the picture quality will go all 'fuzzy' and it looks like they are showing a grimy tape from the 1970s.  Then 5 second later the picture snaps clean again.  I have no idea what happened here, but it looks like they didn't bother cleaning up some scenes.  It happens often enough that it gets distracting and the audio quality rises and falls as well sometimes.

I'm happy to have the shows, but I sure hope Universal cleans house a bit on Season 4.  Season 3's quality is (at best) spotty and in some areas is downright poor.  Caveat emptor.",1124236800,73,1751,4.451104100946372

Kind of a slow start for Season Three. Vera Miles is quite good but the plot is quite ""wordy"" and doesn't seem to hit the mark. I missed the opening scenes when it was on local TV and actually couldn't follow the plot, and now that I HAVE seen the opening scenes I see why; there seems to be a lot of dialogue later on surrounding participants that aren't actually in the episode very much which makes this a bit confusing. Lastly, the concept of the ""poison ivy"" wasn't really the big ""gotcha"" we as Columbo fans generally receive. Martin Sheen shines though, as does Falk (naturally). 3/5

Any Old Port In A Storm/96 min.

You could throw around words like ""masterful"" and ""stunning"" and many people would think you are talking about Oscar quality movies, but they really need not look further than the onscreen brilliance of Peter Falk and Donald Pleasance. Their dialogue and chemistry here are some of the, if not the very best of what this show has to offer. Donald Pleasance literally becomes this wine tasting connoisseur right before your very eyes. Though the episode is a bit on the slow side that only adds to the elegance and the ultimate ending. While so many other cop shows were trying to find new ways to blow up cars and have high powered shoot outs, only Peter Falk could sit in a car sipping wine with the perp and have it be far more rewarding. The soundtrack, the pacing, the locations are just as memorable as the performances. How many other TV shows can you say THAT about? This is REAL must see TV of which I'm not just proud to own, but actually honored as well. 5/5

Candidate For Crime/96 min.

------------

Sometimes it can be therapeutic to write these reviews because it allows you to write the wrongs (pun!) of the uniformed and the unenlightened. I am fairly outraged that Katey Sagal was given the guest starring credits over the marvelous performance of Joanne Linville on the back of the DVD case. Katey was totally unrecognizable and was in this episode for what had to be less than a minute and on top of that contributed nothing. Sure, it provides an eye catcher and is of some small interest but it is FAR from being noteworthy. While Joanne was in there doing what she does best; being one of the better lesser known journeyman actresses of the late sixties and early seventies. She played a great guest starring role as a Romulan Commander on Star Trek and showing her complete versatility plays the odd-woman-out in this Columbo episode. How a person could write that Katey Sagal was a guest ""star"" was obviously reading the credits and not watching the content, but for what it's worth I love you Joanne!

Ok. Now that that's out of the way, this episode has never been a favorite of mine but it does hold its own. As much as I love and prefer the 96-minute format because it means more Columbo, this story would have benefited from the abridged 74-minute run time. Columbo shines in so many moments in this it's just a bit sad that the story line doesn't quite keep up. I particularly like the on-scene investigation when he kept telling the Capt., time and again, ""he'd be there in a moment."" 3.5/5

Double Exposure/74 min.

Robert Culp happens to be my favorite Columbo culprit and while this is my least favorite of the three he has starred in up until this point I still must give it a maximum score. Culp just seems to embody what I think of when I think of Columbo; a master at what he does, it just happens to be coming from the other side of the spectrum. If only this episode could have been of the 96 minute variety. You can feel the thumb screws tighten as truth and lie weave throughout the dialogue and while I find the premise to be a bit ""out there"" I feel I could give this episode five stars if only based on the conversation at the golf course! There is quite a bit of memorable innuendo in such rapid fire it truly is a delight. 5/5

Jack's Back! Chances are if you looked up the term ""swagger"" in a dictionary there would be at least one reference to Jack Cassidy. Jack is definitely in my top five of favorite Columbo villains and this episode is a great example of what can be accomplished with the right cast. Cassidy's antics are the stuff of legend as he takes no prisoners. About the only thing I do not like about this episode is the ""actor"" for the writer that is the target, the Allen Mallory role is almost unmatchable, fortunately he isn't around long enough to bring this five star episode down and the added insane grit of ""Eddy"" the demolition expert make for a well rounded cast. This also happens to be one of the most intriguing murders in the series when you factor in that the accused actually frames himself for the crime!5/5

Mind Over Mayhem/74 min.

------------

I've seen this one quite a few and while it has some very endearing moments, like Columbo and his ""tape recorder"", it isn't one of my favorites. No particular reason. I even look past the technology of the time being portrayed and yet come away with a hunt that isn't all that interesting and find that really isn't too thrilling. Solid performances all around, though. 3.5/5

Swan Song/96 min.

-----------

I saw the light. I had never seen this episode during reruns or especially during the original run (I was only 5!) but have heard about it and was cautiously curious. Knowing most singers can't act and visa versa I actually feared the worst. Talk about your unnecessary feelings! While Johnny, excuse me Tommy Brown, may not be the greatest actor around he has such a genuine nature it is really uncanny. He practically steals every scene, even from the C man himself. My only regret here is that Cash was ever caught, he was such a sympathetic character. I thought it would have been a nice change-up for the show if it could have ended more ambiguously, plus the parachute was so well hidden I wonder if those boy scouts would have ever found it? Somehow, I doubt it. 5/5

A Friend in Deed

------------

While this may be lacking that final blow or a Johnny Cash persona to make this a five star classic it still is a very good episode. I had never seen this on my local TV so it is actually a bit shocking to see this ep (like Swan Song) come from out of nowhere only to make me wonder how many more unseen gems there are out there? Probably quite a few since I've only been watching Columbo for a couple of years, and honestly almost nothing makes me happier. 4/5

Sound/Picture/Extras: 3/5

I'm generally quite pleased with this area in so far as Classic Television is concerned. I do not expect a lot and I am understanding in so far as the age of the print and the audio limitations of the time. Still, it is sad that there are no commentaries or any bonus's here to speak of. Even if Falk could give one commentary of his favorite episode in every season this could be a 5/5! I would like to add that while I'm generally against companies plugging other DVD sets within my purchased DVD set, it is worth a mention that another of my favorite shows was revealed to be on the way with a brief advertisement found on Disc 1; The Rockford Files is finally coming to DVD!! This news was almost as good as the news of my purchasing this set! Like I said, almost.

Packaging: 2/5 stars

Now, for the bad.

Hate to be so negative and leave this review on a low note but whoever it is at Universal who puts these sets together care little about ""the collector.""

:Exhibit A: The cover photos (for each of these seasons) are simply random shots and are not from the season being purchased. While I like the city backdrop and the color scheme, the picture is just not a representation of THIS season. The back photo would have been more apt.

:Exhibit B: a small nit for sure but the ""Columbo"" logo on the top spine now faces the opposite direction than both Seasons 1 and 2.

I have at least 3 other nits along these lines (cheap cases, no liner notes, MRS. COLUMBO) but I guess, like Universal knows, we are happy to have this no matter HOW it looks... a lot like Columbo himself I guess.",1123977600,10,8165,4.462726662189389
2304379,5,B0009NZ36O,"I am different from some of the other Columbo fans. I can do without the extras on my DVDs. I don't want to see the trailers, interviews, or bloopers etc... I just want to see the Columbo episodes uncut with quality sound and pictures. I love the episodes in this set. I can watch these episodes over and over again. Some episodes of course are better than others i.e A Friend indeed vs Lovely but Lethal. But all in all this set is wonderful, especially for the price.",1123977600,2,469,4.340909090909091
2304380,5,B0009NZ36O,"Because so many companies are catering to die-hard fans and collectors, purchaseres of DVDs have gotten spoiled. They expect all sorts of cool extras and are bitterly disappointed when there are none. While extras are very effective for new shows such as Smallville, they are not essential for the older shows. Producers of current TV shows are doing things from the beginning with the DVD in mind, so they have great things to add to a DVD. Not so with the old classics. Most likely there are no deleted sceens or alternate endings from Columbo lying around as such footage was most likely destroyed many years ago. So I can see why some TV shows are issued on DVD without the extras.

That said, I agree Universal could have done a better job with the packaging, but it does not upset me to the point where I did not thoroughly enjoy watching all of the episodes of Season 3. I was very satisfied with the video and audio transfers and it was great having the complete unedited episodes.

I rate this five stars based on the content from Season 3, which has some of my favorite episodes. In fact, there isn't a loser in the bunch. ""Any Old Port in a Storm"" and ""Double Exposure"" are classics with ""Lovely But Lethal"" and ""Candidate for Crime"" not far behind. My personal favorite is ""Swan Song"" with Johhny Cash. Seeing the Man in Black sing ""I Saw The Light"" sends chills down my spine. And what's really cool is that Columbo knows that the singer is guilty of the crime because of his musical arrangement of the song.

So if you're upset about the lack of extras, complain to Universal, but don't give the DVD a low rating and don't hesitate to buy it. I loved these shows when I first saw them my Freshman year in college back in 1973-74, and I still love them. This is TV at its finest.",1123804800,3,1792,4.424242424242424

8063758,5,B0009NZ36O,"I absolutely love Columbo. One of television's finest programs ever. I ordered Season 3, for my favorite episodes, ""A Friend in Need"" and ""A Candidate for Crime"".  So enjoyable watching the oh so arrogant murderer brought down by detective Columbo. That's especially true in the former episode. Also in this Season is Swan Song with Johnny Cash. Does anyone but me sympathize with the murderer in this one? Lol. His wife was so horrible. I like to watch Columbo's expressions, to try and figure out just when it is that he begins to suspect the real culprit. So far, I'm not successful but who cares? I enjoy just watching him work. Plan to order more seasons, as I have already watched each episode 2wice and I just received this dvd!!  Lol  My pkg came on time as expected. Also, I ordered a ""used"" dvd, as the price was better and even tho the pkg showed a little wear, the dvd's were in excellent condition. A few fingerprints....no big deal. Very satisfied.",1512604800,,962,4.614035087719298
