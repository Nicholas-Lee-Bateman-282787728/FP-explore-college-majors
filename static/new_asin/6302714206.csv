496513,5,6302714206,"this video is a must for bon jovi fans. it not only shows their early talent, but some of their humor as well. the songs are not all of their famous ones, but still worth having. i could hardly sit still with some of the songs. their is also a kind of blues sound in some that strikes a chord. this is a video worth watching whenever you feel the need for a pick me up.",1002758400,3,369,3.8684210526315788
496514,5,6302714206,"If you ever saw an episode of MTV Unplugged this is the pilot.  For all the flack Bon Jovi got as a '80's hair band' these guys can turn the electric off and still have so much emotion and depth into songs that critics call bubble gum fluff. Several years earlier at the MTV VMA's Jon and Richie preformed acostically, blowing the minds of the fans as well as some critics, this preformance brings in the rest of the band, and allows them to show that they can still bring an audience to it's feet, unplugged.  Some really great Bon Jovi tunes, as well as the Animals 'House of the Rising Sun', and the old ever covered tune 'fever'. I've had this tape since it was released, and hope they re-release it on DVD, remastered.  Along with Access All Areas.  It's well worth the price if you can get your hands on it.",996537600,6,813,4.294117647058823
496515,5,6302714206,"This video is wonderful!  I especially liked the unplugged versions of ""Lay Your Hands on Me"", ""Living On A Prayer"", ""Love For Sale"", and ""Wanted Dead or Alive"". The cover  versions of ""We Got To Get Out of This Place,"" and ""It's My  Life"" were almost as good as the originals. If You're a Bon Jovi fan  then this video is a must!",964137600,13,330,4.190476190476191

7829678,5,6302714206,"I have had this VHS for years. I can't count how many times I have watched it. All of the songs are perfect from the classics we all know to some amazing covers.

If you are a BJ fan and you haven't seen it then you simply MUST buy it, it's imperative. If you are not so much of a fan but are just curious to see how this band can really outdo themselves in a live setting then I really think you should give it a go.

It's not cheesy or try-hard. It's from a time in the bands' career when they were trying to head out of the glam 80's stuff and into a very different decade.

I cannot fault this video, yeah, I'm a little bias beause I am a bit of a die-hard but, still, ther's no denying it is money well spent.",1285113600,,714,3.8435374149659864
