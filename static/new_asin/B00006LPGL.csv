8157071,2,B00006LPGL,"I can't say that I would recommend this movie unless you've watched every other Hong Kong, crime drama available already. It's not the worst movie I have ever seen but not the best by a long shot. Daniel Wu plays a man with a serious deformity of his face who is a sniper for a gangster . His brother played by Lam Suet also works for the gangster. It's basically a cliched, Hong Kong, crime thriller with not much plot and not much dialogue and were Daniel Wu and Lam Suet not in the film it would have fallen by the wayside even more than it has. Basically a wasted 87 minutes for me watching it until the end. If you must watch it find a rental or a bagain bin it might be sold in.",1335139200,,684,4.036764705882353
