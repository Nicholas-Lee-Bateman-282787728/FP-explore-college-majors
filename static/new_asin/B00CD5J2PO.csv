8580435,4,B00CD5J2PO,"In my judgment, the performances here leave little to be desired, nor can I fault the conducting of Maestro Gergiev--he is extolled as an expert on the music of Prokofiev, and my ears tell me, rightly so. Prokofiev's setting conveys the essence of Dostoyevsky's short novel very well, but it is not excerptable, alas. No arias or set instrumental pieces as such in the work. One should not condemn it for this, but the result is that I will not be rewatching it often. If I want to relive this story, I had rather reread Dostoyevsky's story than watch this opera. The fault is not even with Prokofiev, who has executed his design well, but rather with the present production itself.

To say that the staging is minimalist would be an understatement. This is not objectionable in itself if what is minimally there does not clash with the libretto. However, it is a bit jarring when Polina tells Alexei to light a candle in his garret and he turns on the electric light. Alexei, by the way, is referred to at some point as being in his twenties, and it is a trifle disconcerting to see that Galuzin is rather long in the tooth for the role. but let that pass. I can't fault his performance or the other principals, but will only observe that the female leads clearly seem to me to outshine their male counterparts--especially Diadkova, who,in my view, steals the show. Finally, the scene where Alexei wins at the roulette tables is undone by the minimalist lack of an actual table. We have to be content with watching the operator of the table going through the motions. Up to this point, I had believed that the production designer had flirted with Eurotrash without actually succumbing to that foul disease. I will confess that this scene and the aforementioned ""light the candle"" request, coming, as they both do, late in the opera, did much to mar my enjoyment. Surely, Mr. Gergiev has enough power at the Mariinsky that he does not have to put up with such nonsense. One can only conclude that he is comfortable with it, I wonder if Prokofiev would have felt the same way.

Opera is a combination of several arts. When one of its constituent parts detracts from the total effect achieved by the constituents, it is not opera, but a misbegotten mess. The only thing that arguably saves this production is that it doesn't go too far down the road to Eurotrash, but we can only wonder what lies in the future for the Mariinsky. To see what Gergiev could do with a Prokofiev opera in his younger days, check out DVD of ""Betrothal in a Monastery"" with a very young Netrebko in very good standard definition.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prokofiev-Betrothal-in-a-Monastery/dp/B000A0XS18/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prokofiev - Betrothal in a Monastery</a>. As for ""The Gambler"" (""Igrok"" in Russian), its picture and sound are very much up to blu ray standards.

 As a recording, ""The Gambler"" is excellent; as an opera, this visual incarnation is a missed opportunity. This blu ray  is expensive, and by its purchase, I feel that I have at least made a contribution to the future well-being of the Mariinsky, however small. By the way, I am a great admirer of Gergiev and the Mariinsky as well as of the Bolshoi in Moscow, so I do not feel that anything I have said is poisoned by bias. I have simply stated my feelings with considerable disappointment and sadness.",1376611200,11,3401,4.826758147512865
