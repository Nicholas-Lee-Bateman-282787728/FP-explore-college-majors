8525687,3,B0085QLROY,"There are four movies on this disk.  Kidnapped is magnificent (5 stars)-- by far the best movie adaptation of this classic book.  The Prince and Pauper is good (3 stars) -- I don't thing there are any fabulous versions of this famous Twain tale.  20,000 Leagues under the Sea is weak (2 stars) and inferior to the more famous Disney version.  The Dinosaur Hunter is awful (1 star)--particularly as it goes out of its way in a completely unnecessary fashion to make Bible-believing Christians look foolish.  Overall, the collection is a good value, if only for the 1st two films.  If you don't want The Prince and the Pauper, though, I'd just buy the single disk version of Kidnapped and be done with it.",1347580800,7,703,4.629032258064516
