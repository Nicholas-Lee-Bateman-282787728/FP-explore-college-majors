8628725,4,B00GYHDSB6,"This is a well written, directed and acted out by a great cast that brings so much to the characters they play. This is a pilot for a series that may or may not be continuing but the viewer is never told. The story revolves around a relationship guru named Clare who alongwith her intersting staff run a speed dating service where one hopes to find love with the start of a bell and its off for 5 minutes or more of hilarious results with varying degree of success. The story is broken into 4 vignettes whos chracters new relationships propel the story with hilarious results. The DVD is continuous play and has no start or chapter menues but clocking in under a half hour and a reasonable price is not a big dissapointment but not having more features like some behind the scene footage or some commentary into the making would have been welcomed by the viewer. With that said if you want to have fun at a party, or you are hanging out on a Weekend its a good view for some. Laughs. This is how to do something making a whole lot more for less. I would highly recommend it.",1395964800,2,1074,4.295566502463054
