Edmond O'Brien is on the beat as a ""prowl car cop"" with his partner.  It starts out good then delves into personal relationships and avoids anymore gritty noir.  There's a decent car chase scene, some bad script continuity like the cops finding the car that shot up one of the main cop protagonists with ease and no stand out villains (think Lee Van Cleef in Kansas City Confidential (1952), Neville Brand in D.O.A. (1950) or The Mob (1951), William Conrad in The Killers (1946) and Richard Widmark in Kiss of Death (1947).)

The ending is ridiculous as well, since one lousy main bad guy (Donald Buka) takes a young girl hostage and one hundred cops show up with searchlights.

Edmond O'Brien is his usual big-mouthed self, annoying us plenty; he's better as a villain.

Still, worth a look for the old city view (Pacific Electric Building, Los Angeles, California (1905)) and lovely Black and White Film.

City That Never Sleeps (1953), a Republic Pictures noir with Gig Young as a prowl car cop on the beat, is a lot better.

This is the first movie, the others are listed individually (if available).

So Dark the Night, 1946 film

This story is set in France after the war. A man goes on a vacation in the country; he is a police detective. He is not there on business. He is unmarried, an eligible bachelor (the war created a deficit in men and a surplus in women). People are born, grow up, live, and then die. In small towns as in Paris. Are clothes the most important thing in a person's life? Are some marriage arranged in childhood? [In isolated areas there isn't much of a choice. Just be sure of parentage.] Geese swim in the river. Henri talks about the Big City to Nanette. Should a young woman consider a man twice her age? Leon sees them kissing and complains. M. Carsein talks about ""a silly old fool"". He has no plans to retire. Doctor Boncoeur talks to him. Nanette's mother has plans for her, she will get all the things she missed.

Those platters of meat say rationing has ended after the war. Should a man of his age consider marriage to an 18-year old? Leon objects to these plans. He is a sore loser, he will continue to love Nanette and follow her no matter where they go! [Readers of True Crime know about these matches.] The next morning Nanette is found dead by the river, strangled not drowned! She was last seen with Leon, his farm is upstream. Carsein and the gendarmes go there to investigate. They find the body of Leon, a small bottle in his hand. It was meant to look like a suicide! No footprints, the murderer brushed them away. But they find one shoe print. [Locard's Principle of Exchange.] This will identify the killer. A letter was placed by Carsein's room, it has a warning. That paper is very common in the village, the handwriting can't be identified. No fingerprints either. What was the motive? There is anger about these killings in the village of St. Margot.

Pierre also got a threatening note too. Then another body is found! Pierre is heartbroken and will close the inn. Does a lonesome woman brood and become unhappy? Yes. She too wants to leave her small town. She can't have written those notes, she is illiterate! The detective deduces a description from the one footprint. [Like Sherlock Holmes.] What about the handwriting? Does the circumstantial evidence point to one suspect? Doctor Manet will analyze the evidence, it is conjecture. Carsein writes his notes on the case. Should a suspect be tested by an alienist for schizophrenia? Carsein leaves the office to return to the inn at St. Margot. Pierre at the inn talks to a visitor, there is a struggle. There is a shot. The police arrive to tie up the loose ends.

This is an average murder mystery with a surprising ending. There were hints to the solution earlier. The exotic locale is a plus. [Note the water pump handle in the kitchen.] Did you find it worth watching? Mary Roberts Rinehart's mystery ""The Bat"" had a pioneering story with a similar plot. So too Agatha Christie's ""The Murder of Roger Ackroyd"".",1402012800,,3039,4.599630996309963

5979414,3,B00FE7LVZC,"Sony and TCM have included a mixed bag of film noir titles for this year's edition(Volume IV)of their ""COLUMBIA FILM NOIR CLASSICS"" series from the vaults of Columbia Pictures. One thing that hasn't changed is the video and audio qualities which like the first three volumes is superb to say the least. All five films have been restored and re-mastered and anyone viewing them will be more than pleased with the results considering that most of the films presented are over sixty years old. The restorers at SONY are to be commended for making these films look brand new. That being said, only ""JOHNNY O'CLOCK""(1947) seems to have all the  ingredients when it comes to being labeled a true film noir due in no part to a terrific performance by Dick Powell. It's a complicated love triangle involving murder, deceit, betrayals, etc. that really holds the viewers interest throughout due in no small part by the acting talents of Powell, Evelyn Keyes, Nina Foch, Thomas Gomez and Lee J. Cobb. This was the first film written and directed by Robert Rossen(""Body and Soul"", ""The Hustler"") and he gets the most out of his cast and crew. ""JOHNNY O'CLOCK"" is 96 minutes and is the second film in this new collection. The first film, ""SO DARK THE NIGHT""(1946) is a strange film indeed. Directed by Joseph H. Lewis(""Gun Crazy"") whose ""My Name is Julia Ross"" was included in Volume III of this series, it is more of a Freudian murder mystery than a true film noir and takes a long time to get started(Spoiler alert: the first murder doesn't happened until 30 minutes in) and is the shortest of the five at only 70 minutes. You could say it's film noir French style as the entire story takes place in Paris and the French countryside(actually Canoga Park, Calif.) and there are no name actors. It has a surprise ending which I won't reveal. The third film, ""WALK A CROOKED MILE""(1948) is the first of two films in this new volume that was directed by Gordon Douglas and is a Cold War espionage thriller involving agents from the FBI and one from Scotland Yard who are trying to crack a spy ring. There is a voice-over narration that makes it seem more like a documentary than actual film. Fans of Raymond Burr will enjoy his role as the brutal henchman of the spy ring. ""WALK A CROOKED MILE"" is 91 minutes. The fourth film, ""BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN""(1950) is one of those cop buddy films that starts out as a comedy-drama with some film noir elements thrown in that makes it hard to take seriously. Again directed by Gordon Douglas, the acting is good with cop Edmond O'Brien and bad guy Donald Buka getting top honors. Singer Gale Storm is the love interest of both cops. The  ending of the film is a nail bitter and it's a wonder it got past the censors. ""BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND DAWN"" is 89 minutes. The fifth and last film in this volume is called 'WALK EAST ON BEACON""(1952) and is another narrated film that plays more like a documentary than actual film story. Suggested by a story from J. Edgar Hoover it's another espionage tale about FBI agents trying to crack a nest of spies trying to steal secrets. That's all I'm going to say about the plot. ""WALK EAST ON BEACON"" is 97 minutes. Those are the five films from Volume IV in this series. Like the previous three volumes the bonus features include publicity stills, behind-the-scenes photos, movie posters, and lobby cards. Whether or not this collection sells enough to warrant a ""Volume V"" next year remains to be seen. If you're planning on purchasing this new set from SONY and TCM, I would not pay the price some sellers are asking. I purchased this directly from TCM for a lot less. As far as Sony's packaging regarding the disc holders, previous reviewers have complained(justifiably) that the discs are very hard to remove from the holders. Having purchased many of the TCM box sets in the past you must first press the disc from the top until you see the two plastic levers located at the bottom of the holder give away and then you can easily remove it and the other disc underneath. Failure to do this will result in you damaging the disc trying to get it out. I hope this is helpful.  I'm looking forward to other Sony and TCM releases in the future.",1380758400,67,4210,4.5809018567639255

They spoke clearly and loud enough for us to hear them.  No mush mouth or leaving us guessing at the plot.  These are some of the best movies ever make in my opinion and they did it with out blowing up a bunch of stuff.  It is no wonder that people went to the movies.

8614739,2,B00FE7LVZC,"THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE SET AS A WHOLE --- 4 STAR STARS  FOR JOHNNY O'CLOCK ... All Day Long ! ! !..... Johnny O'clock is really good ... I Think its his best Noir Ever. --- 5 Star performance & good performances from all -- You've got John Hustons  real life wife at one time ""Evelyn Keys"" , Lee J. Cobb, Tomas Gomez the first Mexican actor to receive an academy award for his portrayal in "" Ride the pink horse"" which I reviewed and has faily recently been done by Criterion after being unavailable on Disc for an eternity.---- Back to Johnny O'Clock .....You have to really strain your brain to try & think of ANY Actor who wasn't good to great in ""Johnny O'. --- . I really like it  because in ""Johnny"" Dick Powell is portraying a character that IMO just fits him to a T.  He displays all the qualities he's known for in the numerous other Noirs he appears in.  He's smart, He's Witty He's tough He's likeable & He lays all these qualities down in all the perfect doses at the perfect times. -- Thus he's believable as the character he plays. --- Although I think "" Murder My Sweet is very good & definetly  a must for any serious Noir Collection IMO Johnny O is better by a notch the only shortcoming being the film editing &/or the short camera shots the director decided to use. If some of the scene transition editing etc. was smoother it would have been complete silk. -- I certainly  liked it that much better. --- As for the set --- IMO Take ""Johnny O'clock"" out & give the rest of the set to somebody who doesn't mind a lot of other mediocre Crime / mystery stuff a a few noir aspects  or who just has to see EVERY crime/ mystery flick ever made.  Of course that would only be applicable to first paying a fortune for the set  Just to get Johnny O'Clock. ---- I'LL BUY JOHNNY O' CLOCK IN A HEARTBEAT WHEN Columbia, Criterion or Olive etc. puts it out on a great print as a stand alone disc  & Not a  -R burn copy ( MOD ). either AND/ OR  For a ridiculous price. ---  Read the other reviews here --- Johnny O' Clock is the only real winner in this set. --- "" While not a perfect flick ( How many flicks Are ? ) JOHNNY O'CLOCK ROCKS ! ! ! ... So put it in your wish list on high priority so we can all buy a Disc of it for our collections & one for your Noir Friends / Family etc. . ---",1439337600,3,2295,4.048672566371682

8614742,3,B00FE7LVZC,"This lesser known noir suffers from a certain choppiness but still packs a punch in entertainment value. Lots of the usual shadows, off-kilter angles and shady characters. By now Dick Powell was at the peak of his tough guy persona (did any other actor ever look so good in a fedora?). He does a good job here in the title role that seems a good fit: a streetwise casino manager who walks a fine line between the legal and illegal. Lots of familiar faces spice up the proceedings: Tomas Gomez, Lee J. Cobb, Jim Bannon, and an especially fetching Ellen Drew. But the two standout performances are by Powel and noir regular Evelyn Keyes, who's her usual intense self, here as a character half way between femme fatale and good girl. Powell's and Keyes' chemistry goes a long way to ensuring the film's mild success.
Johnny O'Clock is no Murder, My Sweet, but is still pretty darn good. Just short of four stars but a solid three.",1423353600,8,927,4.5568862275449105
