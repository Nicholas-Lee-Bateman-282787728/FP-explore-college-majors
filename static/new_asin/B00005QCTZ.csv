1647620,1,B00005QCTZ,"It's painfully unfunny, whether you get a glimpse of Streisand's bosom or not. The homophobic dialogue in the opening scenes is embarassingly dated and offensive, and Streisand is at her most phony and irritating. I thought it was a turkey when it was released and I still do. George Segal was a good comic, but her shrill, totally unconvincing performance derails it totally. It's like watching a bad play. Which is exactly what it originally was.

1647655,5,B00005QCTZ,"Bought this on Amazon, not thrilled of course that it's apparently a censored/edited
edition, plus the DVD is no frills/no extras to speak of re: the film, which is disappointing,
and no commentaries.  It looks and sounds reasonably good.  We used to sit and howl over
this film on TV (so we saw it censored then anyway, whatever)
back in the 70s where it seemingly ran constantly for a decade or two
post-release.  This is basically the sleazier, weirder flipside to What's Up Doc? and
a total romantically dysfunctional NYC tale of mismatched oddballs as compared
to the former film.  Based on a play but it manages to not seem too ""stagey""
and being filmed mainly on location helps. The chase near the end around
Lincoln Center or whatever with the creeps running after Babs and George Segal never fails to just slay me.
I think Owl is funnier than Where's Poppa? and less morbid, but no less anarchic.
But still not quite as great as What's Up, Doc?, but comes close, at least.

Robert Klein is in this for all of 5 min. but he's funny as can be, too, even in such a tiny cameo role
as ""Felix""'s put-upon buddy.  ""The sun does NOT SPIT!"" is an all-time classic line from this
here comedic perennial favorite.  Also functions as yet another invaluable time capsule
of early '70s turning-point gritty/grotty/dangerous New York City.  Just seeing Doubleday Bookstore
(whether a set or not) again is reason enough, almost, to watch this, but it's just a plain funny movie,
great screenplay, some classic one-liners, and it's as un-PC as possible, given the times, so be prepared.
Still, this movie needs to be restored and uncensored and extras and some commentaries
added, hopefully, at some point.  Many don't know or remember this film, and it deserves
to be rediscovered.

But please, not REMADE!!  Any film featuring Babs in a film within a film charming 42nd St. Super 16mm ""instructional
film"" entitled ""Cycle Sluts"" (and dig that street teaser poster!)
(George Segal bellowing into half-deaf box office guy's face and the rest
of the Upper West/East Side or whatever, ""I WANNA SEE
CYCLE SLUTS WHAT TIME DOES IT START!????"" worth price of admission, too)
is one you need to see if you're a comedy fan of any kind, even though of course
this film is going to be a bit dated by now.  And ponder how does George Segal
afford his studio apt. on a failed writer/book sales clerk's salary, anyway?",1417219200,,2398,4.7105263157894735

1647685,4,B00005QCTZ,I recall when this movie came out - seems it was was late 50s or early 60s. I think it was considered racy and had an R rating. Some women in my neighborhood were going and invited me. I was about 30 and didn't go - I worried about Catholic Church ratings - I did not see Duel in the Sun because it was banned! This is just dumb and funny and wouldn't raise an eyebrow today. Streisand's early acting method to express emotion was to yell louder and sound more Bronx Jewish. I will leave the quality of the DVD and the sound to all your experts who comment with whines about spending $6.47 and not getting surroundsound. It was quick and funny and went in the PARCA charity bag when it was finished.,1403308800,,699,4.185185185185185

1647714,4,B00005QCTZ,"Funny how movies from years ago differ from today's.  Case in point, our subject here, The Owl and the Pussycat. The movie opens with all of the technical credits....'costumes by Ann Roth'...'cars by the Chrysler Corporation', that nowadays would be bringing up the rear. Speaking of rears, Miss Streisand is in fine form, complimenting a series of sexy costumes by the aforementioned Miss Roth. But I digress. What took me so long to revisit this fun film after my only previous viewing of it at the Forest Theater with my sister a-WAY back in the moth-balled year of 1970? Decided to give it another whirl so order I did from the netflix boys. The disc is widescreen and comes with trailers for The Mirror Has Two Faces, Roxanne and For Pete's Sake. You also can choose a number of subtitles from French to Thai! There is also a cast and director credit list, which is nice.
Again with the digression! Our film opens with a green moon hanging over a New York skyline that ever so slowly ascends into view during which time we get to read all those juicy credits alluded to previously. We learn The Owl and the Pussycat was presented on the New York Stage by so and so. And that the music accompanying our green moon and glittering ascending New York skyline is provided by Blood, Sweat and Tears. A word about this. Not only did the opening theme music set the mood quite perfectly, but, the horns, organ,piano, flute, bass and drums of B,S and T are wonderful to listen to all during the movie.
As our New York skyline comes into full view and rain begins to mix in with the lights, we are wisked down to street level and a woman in a fur coat and newspaper for cover, trying to catch a city bus in the downpour. Thus begins our story. Woman meets man who has just been delivered another rejection slip for his latest novel. The woman (pussycat) is of course played by Barbra Steisand and the rejected and dejected writer (owl) played by George Segal, one of my favorite late 1960's/early 1970's actors along with Elliott Gould and Michael Sarrazin. Triple bill Owl and the Pussycat along with  Goulds' ""Move"" and Sarrazins' ""The Sweet Ride"" and you're in early '70's heaven. But the digressions continue don't they.
My major revelation upon re-watching this vintage piece of cinema is the screenplay by Buck Henry.  The movie does not let up from start to finish with zippy and witty dialogue, perfectly executed by our two stars. Just a taste of some of the exchanges....When Felix(our dejected rejected writer) is confronted by landord Mr. Rapshinski in the hallway of his building for tossing his rejection slip on the hallway floor, he apologizes by saying ""I know how hard you work keeping the building on the House and Gardens All-Time Ten Best List.""  When Barbras' Doris is questioning her new acquaintance Felix, asking ""Did you ever write for TV?"", he answers ""No I have never written for the lobotomy box."" When Felix explains to Doris that his concert pianist fiance's ""whole life is music"" she flips back ""well, where ya gonna honeymoon...Sam Goody?!""  I realize you have to be of a certain age to appreciate some of these references.  But there you go and if you are of that certain age, you will laugh many times throughout this movie.
The English subtitles come in handy if you miss a word or two during the course of the film. Very easy to read in bold yellow letters. I thought Doris was saying her ""planet burst"" until I accessed the subtitles to learn it was her bladder that burst!
Also, I would like to mention the many New York locations that co-star in the movie, one of which is the Doubleday bookstore(on 51st street?)where Felix and his friend Barney (Robert Klein) work as book clerks, much to Doris' derision. This bright and colorful establishment no longer exists needless to say but looks so inviting in this film. And then there is the grande finale in New York's own Central Park.
In conlusion, I am going to seek this out and buy it on DVD, that's how much I enjoyed it.  It doesn't bother me the DVD version may not include the much beloved F word that's been cut, upsetting a good many other reviewers. Trust me...The Owl and the Pussycat is the opposite of enervating!",1369267200,2,4210,4.612817089452603

You give zero extras and you ignore the theatrical R version (that is easily available!)  and release the sanitized later PG version? you got it!

1647742,2,B00005QCTZ,"Much of what's left in my collection to review are the movies I didn't much like. Here's an example. This was Barbra Streisand's first non-singing role, and it's just stupid. I mean the role is stupid; Doris, the character she plays is stupid, and the movie is stupid.

It all starts when Felix (George Segal), a frustrated writer, notices the girl across the air shaft accepting money from a gentleman caller. He's mad because she is apparently the one who complained that his typewriter made too much noise late at night. But she plays her TV, with a big bang-bang shoot-em-up movie, with the window open because her apartment is too hot.

When Felix tells the landlord that he saw her taking money from a man, the landlord kicks her out of her apartment. She shows up at Felix's door carrying her TV and a small tote containing her night clothes. She is loud, rude, irrational, uneducated, wears the most ridiculous pajama outfit, and has nothing to recommend her except a reasonably nice body. She causes Felix an enormous amount of trouble, so of course he falls in love with her.

Of course. I suppose if you have a good body, and know how to look as pretty as possible (there's a scene about that), you don't have to have any other redeeming qualities.",1336953600,,1259,4.611607142857143

1647746,1,B00005QCTZ,"I echo the sentiments of previous reviews. I saw this movie at a sneak preview at Loews' State Theater in New York, and George Segal attended. I later saw it again after its official release, and there were no cuts. Barbra's bare bosom had already been shadowed out, but the funniest line in the movie, when Barbra uttered the ""F"" word, was there. It was still there when Cinemax aired the movie in the 90s. With all of the blood, gore, horror, and sexual aberration that we've been exposed to on the screen, what is offensive about Ms. Streisand using the vernacular for copulation? Some reviewers have blamed Streisand for the current emasculated version that I was suckered into buying, after being mislead. Not true; Barbra has no power over this particular film. It was produced by Ray Stark for Columbia, and Columbia is the villain of this story. At least give potential buyers the choice of which version they'd like to see! My advice is do NOT buy the castrated edition of The Owl and the Pussycat.",1250985600,9,1007,4.662921348314606

Soon they come to understand each other. More important Felix learns more of himself; Doris learns more of herself. They move from co-dependents to individuals with no pretenses.

In the process of watching the film I learned that there can be more exciting costumes without leather. However I never fingered out the psychology of rolling eggs. Guess I will have to watch it again.

One day we may get a Blu-ray uncut demonstrative version.

It was the first time we'd ever heard it used on the big screen and were indeed shcoked.  I was more shocked when it didn't appear in the DVD version and had apparently been cut... however, the movie was just as good and as funny as when I first saw it and Barbra Streisand and George Segal have a great on-sceen chemistry and the story line is funny.

1647751,4,B00005QCTZ,"After three big-budget Broadway-based period musicals in a row, Barbra Streisand obviously made a conscious career decision to convey a more contemporary image onscreen. She succeeds in spades in this often hilarious 1970 comedy adapted by Buck Henry from a hit Bill Manhoff play and directed by Herbert Ross. Streisand plays Doris, a loud-mouthed fetish hooker who claims to be a model and an actress. She gets thrown out of her apartment when her neighbor, a nebbish bookstore clerk and aspiring writer named Felix Sherman, reports her clandestine activities to the landlord. This causes a confrontation in which she is convinced he's gay and seduces him in a surprisingly graphic scene (at least surprising for Streisand). Another fight ensues causing them to get kicked out of his apartment. The rest of the film is mostly their bickering as they travel from one apartment to the next and carry out their improbable, Pygmalion-like opposites-attract romance.

In the same year he made two greatly underrated films, the mature ""Loving"" and the manic ""Where's Poppa?"", George Segal makes Felix a lovably insecure schlub and provides great chemistry with Streisand in her first non-singing role. They have a great scene in the bathtub where both are completely stoned as his fianc&eacute;e and her parents walk in, and he has a funny scene where he pretends to be the TV to help Doris get to sleep. For Streisand's part, she wears a hysterically tacky negligee, dances in a go-go cage, appears in a soft-porn flick called ""Cycle Sluts"" (we only hear the riotous audio - ""Where are you putting THAT?"") and says the ""F"" word (unfortunately cut out of the DVD version though it's obvious when she says it). It's not her best screen performance, but it's one of her funniest. Henry's sharp dialogue and Ross' quick pacing help considerably in making this an enjoyably vulgar romantic comedy. The 2001 DVD had no extras other than three trailers, none for this movie.",1158192000,3,1963,5.003058103975535

I'm encouraging people NOT to buy or rent these DVD's and to write the studios and complain... it's bad enough that Columbia and Paramount have ruined their own product, but they didn't even have the courtesy to notify buyers that they weren't purchasing the original films.

That means we saw Babs nude and we heard the ""F"" word that had everyone talking, as she tells off a bunch of moochers.  More than a few of us need to give Columbia a piece of our minds.  This is unconscionable.  The nude scene was NOT destroyed, it was BLOCKED from the collar bone down (she was laying in Barney's bed, asking ""Whatdaya think?"" just before Felix joined her.

Is it because Streisand is a democrat? All kidding aside, I'm very disappointed due to this small but very important omission-mainly because it ruins a very funny moment in the film, but also because the ""bleep"" was so unnecessary. Is the ""F"" word really such a big deal? Graphic violence gets a green light everytime, but a little swear word might cause little Johnny to grow up up to be a serial killer.

1647789,5,B00005QCTZ,"One of the most hilarious films ever made, THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT has more laughs than ten of today's so-called ""comedies"" combined.  Even though a few set changes and a couple of new supporting characters are added to ""open up"" the storyline, director Herbert Ross and writer Buck Henry manage to keep the same spirit of the original one-act, two-character play intact.  There's a lot of verbal warfare in Henry's screenplay, and he seems to have a gift for penning wickedly funny dialogue.  Some viewers could argue that THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT is little more than two characters insulting each other for 95 minutes, but - when those insults are so rigorously funny - who cares?

In the female lead, Barbra Streisand gives a refreshingly unsentimental performance as Doris, the semi-literate hooker who (for once) does not have a heart of gold.  George Segal was primarily known as a dramatic actor before he was cast as Felix, the snotty book clerk/writer-wannabe.  His performance is so convincing that he has been known as an expert comic ever since.  The chemistry between Streisand and Segal ignites from the beginning, and it stays aflame throughout their relationship's many ups and downs.  Robert Klien has a funny supporting role - and plays it expertly - but THE OWL AND THE PUSSYCAT remains a showcase for the chemistry between Streisand and Segal.  I think well-respected film critic Pauline Kael said it best when she wrote, ""Were Tracy and Hepburn ever this good. . . maybe, but they were never better.""  High praise indeed!

About the DVD:  This relatively featureless DVD has excellent picture quality (I wish all films from the seventies looked this good), but I am very disappointed that Columbia chose to use the PG edit of the film for this release.  Though only one scene was edited, that particular scene no longer makes any apparent sense with Streisand's foul-mouthed phrase deleted.  Hopefully the original theatrical cut will someday make it's way to DVD",1081123200,12,1985,4.9397590361445785

1647825,3,B00005QCTZ,"Way back in 1970, Barbra Streisand paired with George Segal in this sleazier than Neil Simon,opposites attract, romantic comedy, written by Buck Henry based on a play by Bill Manhoff..  While Owl and the Pussycat is far better than your average romantic comedy (just try the 'Touch of Class' movies today for instance), the film is little more than an unrealistic, though entertaining sit-com.
Barbra Streisand  risked a lot by playing Doris, a slutty, gutter talking (more rude than crude) part-time prostitute who is 'an actress with three, well two commercials' to her name.  This was a far cry from the beloved Funny Girl or Broadway Diva who starred on T.V. specials the audiences accepted.  George Segal is Felix, the overly nervous intellectual struggling writer.  They live in the same apartment building. [...] About halfway through the film, the film gets a bit more serious and we learn a little more about the characters.  This is not a utter fantasy type film like say Pretty Woman, but the characters are clearly not particularly realistic either.
The film is a relic of its era and perhaps a bit more interesting now because of that.  Streisand appearing as a prostitute in skimpy outfits (you'll perhaps remember the lingerie with the strategically placed pink hand silhouettes when you see it from the old poster for this film). Streisand proved with her thicker than usual Bronx accent, and her portrayal of a risqu character that she had talent as an actress/comedian and there was more to her than Funny Girl. George Segal is at his best.  His reactions, comic timing and slow burn frustrations are amusing and very entertaining to watch.
Robert Klein pops up as Barney, a friend of Segal's Felix (and his girlfriend is none other than former Ivory Soap star turn porn star Marilyn Chambers), and there's Allan Garfield as a manager of a dress shop  and  Jacques Sandulescu  as the cranky apartment manager/super, but this is almost entirely a two character film and the charisma and talent of Segal and Streisand carry the picture easily.  Don't expect Streisand to break out singing--she doesn't warble a note in character here in this movie.
PC WARNING:  When Doris first meets Felix she insists he's gay and continually taunts him for being a weak gay man.  The sensitive among you may find the dated, insensitive and not politically correct references more insulting than funny.
NOTE:  This is the re-released PG rated film which is two minutes shorter then the original R rated film that was released in 1970.  Barbra says the F word in the original, but does not do so here and there was also a few other cuts for language (and one peek-a-boo revealing shot of
Bab's anatomy now excised).  A bit of a cheat to release the re-release of the film without a note or explanation about it.
In the end of course the film doesn't stray very far from the formula of your typical Doris Day/ Rock Hudson film.  Eventually the characters reveal their softer sides to each other but the film doesn't let itself get too soppy.
If you like the stars at all you'll want to see the film, but even if you aren't a fan of Streisand, she's playing an interesting bigger than life character here worth taking a look at , particularly if you like plays and films like  Barefoot in the Park or The Odd Couple.
DVD STUFF
The film is presented in 1:85:1 Anamorphic widescreen of you can watch a pan and scan version as well (don't).  The film has been digitally remastered from an excellent print that has only occasional specks of grain and a few scratches.  The colors look good, the black levels are strong and very little edge enhancement is visible.
The Audio is Dolby Digital Mono, (in both English and French.).  The over-lapping dialogue is easy to hear and the dialogue, sparse sound effects and background music is sharp and free from distortion or signs of age.
EXTRAS:
The only extra feature on the DVD are three theatrical trailers for  The Mirror has Two Faces (a bad Streisand film), For Pete's Sake (a forced dated Streisand comedy) and Roxanne (the Steve Martin romantic comedy).  No trailer for Owl and the Pussycat however.
There are the not quite complete filmographies of the director and stars, and lots of different subtitle choices.
This is a no frills DVD.
bottom line:
Here's a slightly risqu and racy romantic comedy sit-com feature film relic from 1970.  It's dated but if you have any affection for either one of the stars or have forgotten that Diva Barbra is actually a pretty impressive actress when she wants to be, there's a lot to encourage you to give this film a try.  The film boasts many funny one-liners and director Herb Ross never lets things get too soppy.  The DVD looks and sounds very good but there are no extras..

1647827,1,B00005QCTZ,"This is Barbra Striesand's best comedy!
Columbia Home Video has finely introduced this classic onto DVD but they forgot a few major key DVD laws!
1 . If no extras can be included then at least add the theatrical trailer!
and the biggest DVD law! 2. Include an UNCUT version of a film as it was originally intended by the film maker!
When this film was originally released back in 1970 it was stamped with an 'R' rating then in it's re-release in 1972 they had re-cut the film down to a 'PG' rating.

This DVD contains the 'PG' version! while watching this version you'll notice where the cuts were made.
This DVD includes a two page booklet that states how the film was cut in the 70's including language and a scene revealing a topless ""Funny Girl"". It then states how the profanity was restored in 1999 for a re-release but without the nude Barbra because it was destroyed in the 70's. Well I hate to tell Columbia but this film isn't restored and is lacking a very funny moment in the original film.
 One scene is when Streisand and Segal are walking down a city street talking and a car of guys starts following them yelling out insults, then Streisand walks over to them to tell them to
""F@&# OFF!""(cut out dialog) followed by these guys chasing them. This scene was so badly edited that it ends up making no sense.
There was a television version of the film that contained the whole scene intact with muting out the four letter word.
As far as the picture quality it is very good but if you're a fan of the movie i'm sure you'll be upset as well as i am with this hacked up verson.
Why did columbia home video do this??

UPDATE

3-06
Amazon has this DVD listed as being rated 'R' this is incorrect and this needs to be corrected so it doesn't confuse people or Amazon will be receiving a lot of returns.

7-30-07

Now Amazon has this movie listed as being unrated? This is a PG version of an original ""R"" rated movie!

*Update 10-12-10

I can't believe It's been about 10 years since this butchered version had been in circulation and STILL! hasn't been pulled or properly restored and released! Are Sony kidding us? really disgraceful!
I really think they owe all that bought this a replacement....10 years late but still. I want to see the version I remember and love before I drop dead from old age.

The first red flag is the cover art that strays from the classic original. Upon playing, I was shocked that two of the highlights of the film: Streisand telling a group of sexist pigs to ""f--- of-"" and her topless scene are both missing. In an era when the ""Boogie Nights"" DVD goes so far as to show Mark Wahlberg's fake member, I am dismayed that this film has been edited to a PG tv version.  C'mon, when they are able to dig up old takes from the MGM vault, someone could have found those two pieces of film. The Streisand curse is on the soundtrack album and the topless scene was revealed in ""High Society.""  One of the trailers included on this DVD is for the movie ""Roxanne"" which bears no relation to any of the players in this film. There are no fun special extras.

This part is interesting to me: I noticed that comedy is a social activity. I recall a couple of lines in the movie that had the theater absolutely rollicking back in 1972(?). I didn't even crack a smile this time. Was it because I already knew the lines were coming? Certainly, surprise is an important aspect of comedy but I also think it must need to be shared. Kind of like a really nice meal; it is better with company.
