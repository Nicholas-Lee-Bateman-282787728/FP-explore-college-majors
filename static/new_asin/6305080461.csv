964363,5,6305080461,"I have heard so much about these 4 girls but never knew ""their story."" As we all know, they are deceased and cannot speak for themselves. However, Lee does such a beautiful, tasteful and dignified job  in allowing the individual families speak. My heart was shattered after  learning the full story. To see personal pictures of those  ""babies"" growing up. Wondering what might have become of them if  fate had been different. The images stayed with me long after viewing this  film. Being a small child myself when these event occured--I just had no  idea.... A must for all to see!",953164800,10,582,4.712871287128713
964364,5,6305080461,"When this documentary first aired on HBO, I was very moved by the severity of the subject.  When I had learned later on what had happened to these four innocent girls, it affected me.  How can a mean-spirited and  cold-hearted racist like the man responsible for this tragedy, Robert  Chambliss, think that just because he's a white man in the South in the  late 50s to early 60s means that he can get away with whatever he wants,  including the murder of these girls. I applaud his terrific effort and  encourage him to produce and direct another video of similar nature.  I  enjoy watching this video and also enjoy showing it to my professors and  fellow students who are advocates and believe in equal rights for everyone  of every race.",952732800,4,741,4.623076923076923
964365,5,6305080461,school children being killed? this film's subjects died during the civil rights marches but the killing of youth still continues to this day.this film deals with hate at it's ugliest and the film will rip you in  pieces.it's a must see but also so hard to handle and deal with.cuz the  girls died for reasons of hate by others and how do you explain that to  anyone? even yourself? a great job of bringing this tragedy to light by  spike lee.,947289600,8,442,4.419753086419753
964366,5,6305080461,"In my college writing classes, I cover issues of diversity, and I'm amazed at my students' ignorance of the civil rights movement. All they know is that they get Dr. King's birthday off. This film leaves them shattered,  opens their eyes like nothing else I have tried. I would highly recommend  it to teachers at the high school and college level if you want to expand  your students' appreciation of how we got where we are today and the heroes  (and monsters) who lived through it all. Lee's film, which should have won  the Oscar, will leave you changed. I recommend it to anyone.",937440000,24,584,4.576923076923077

964483,5,6305080461,"Friends and family of the four girls murdered in the 1963 bombing of the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church remember their lost daughters, sisters and friends with grief that resonates as strong 50 years later as when it happened.  The quest for justice took far too long, and was incomplete when ""achieved.""

Their story is all the more powerful in this century, when certain politicians are actively trying to roll back the Civil Rights Act of 1963, gerrymander voting districts and prevent certain demographic groups from exercising their constitutional rights.  Hate groups have come out of  hiding to endorse their agenda of hatred and domestic terrorism. The legacy of Denise, Addie, Carole and Cynthia cannot, must not, be lost yet again.  They paid for our civil rights in blood.  Don't let their sacrifice be in vain.

Spike Lee has left us a powerful memoir to the four children who were murdered, and the wounded who survived.  This film should be required viewing for every government, Social Studies and American history class. Five stars aren't enough.",1483401600,,1063,5.068965517241379

This documentary chronicles the lives of the 4 little girls killed in the Birmingham church bombing. It contains some heart-wrenching first account of events by people who were there at the time that this tragedy took place.

Pros:
- Historically accurate information about the Birmingham events
- Provides insights into who the girls were prior to the tragedy

I would have became a vigilante. I would of made it my aim in life to go visit this town, and do away with Bob Chambliss very quickly, and police commissioner Bull Conner and dispose of their
remains. They would be erased from this world and I would put the fear of God in them.
I would see to it, that no would be able to find them or me and systematically kill off these racist and Klansman, one by one until there was no more left of them and would stop at nothing to end the racist behavior that had taken place in Alabama and throughout the south.

965221,5,6305080461,"On the eve of the 50th anniversary of the 16th Street Baptist Church Bombing in Birmingham, Alabama, I deposit my two-cents' worth on Spike Lee's well-composed depiction of this tragedy, which came only two weeks after the March on Washington.
  We are ushered into this powerful piece with the sound of Joan Baez's ""Birmingham Sunday"", an old folk tune turned into a tribute to each of the victims as four young faces brimming with potential flash before us.
Through the interviews with the parents of the youngest victim, 11-year-old Denise McNair ,Chris and Maxine, as well as Denise's aunt, Helen Pegues, the mother of 14-year-old victim, Carole Robinson, Alpha Robertson, along with friends and relatives of Addie Mae Collins, and Cynthia Wellesley, who were both also 14, we relive the memories of the days of Bull Connor's turning fireman's hoses on peaceful Civil Rights demonstrators, and learn how even young children who had nothing to lose after being brutalized by Jim Crow laws from birth, engaged in acts of moral and certainly physical courage in order to help achieve justice for all under the American system. Chris McNair relates that having to tell his daughter why she couldn't enjoy patronage of certain places due to her race and seeing her hurt by that revelation was no worse than having to remove an embedded piece of mortar from her skull after the blast.
  It was the belief of villainous Ku Klux Klansmen Robert Chambliss, and Bobby Frank Cherry that their terrorist act would make blacks beg for segregation again. Decades would pass before they were brought to justice, by which time, a third Klansman also involved in the bombing, Herman Cash, had died.
 One aspect featured in this documentary is the impact it had on the Court of World Opinion. This incident made headlines around the world, and an interviewee relates that members of the International Rotary Club who were from Birmingham were attending a meeting in Tokyo, Japan at the time, were repeatedly asked about this incident to the point where it drove them crazy and made them state, ""We can't take much more of this!"". Omitted from this documentary is the fact that the new hobby of people in many non-white nations was throwing Americans out of their countries as  a result of this incident. If that is what Americans could do to  four young girls worshipping God and preparing for a church pageant simply because of their race, America's credibility as far as its human rights record was definitely lax! The ""Yankee Go Home"" posters were abound in many quarters!
  We learn why only three of the girls had joint funerals, and what it was like for some of the mourners to have their loved ones eulogized by Dr. Martin Luther King. King's widow, Coretta relates that her husband wrote letters of condolence to the victim's families the following Christmas.--Expressions of love in sharp contrast to footage of the bombing's aftermath, as well as quickly flashed coroner's photos of each of the young girls. Addie Mae's younger sister, Sarah Collins, was injured in the bombing, but survived.
  The Reverend Jessie Jackson and comedian Bill Cosby also reflect upon this tragedy. In contrast former Governor George Wallace, whose segregationist stance led him to stand defiantly in the doorway of the registry office of the University of Alabama to oppose Federally enacted desegregation laws the previous June is also interviewed. Wheelchair bound and barely able to speak due to a 1972 shooting during that year's Presidential campaign by one Arthur Brenner(a white man, ironically), the once charismatic arch segregationist is now cowed and pathetic looking in his final years with a black aide by his side trying to convince the world that he's changed. Sadly, he had the chance to tell Alabama to turn things around at that crucial moment, and failed.
 While Alpha Robertson has expressed forgiveness towards her daughter's killers, and the accompanying strains of ""Birmingham Sunday"" create a sad sense of resignation and having to move on as she speaks, there is still something hopeful and determined about this piece, as America has vastly improved.
 The final footage of the victims dressed up for Easter, a celebration of resurrection, with their loved ones around them should create a sense of renewal and purpose in all of us.....And may the choir keep singing of freedom!",1379116800,,4380,5.008253094910591

965382,5,6305080461,"BRAVO SPIKE LEE!

The friends and family of the litte girls speak out to, put a face & personality to the 4 little girls that lost their innocent lives in that church that TRAGIC DAY! So often in documenteries during the time of the civil rights movement you hear this story ""BRIEFLY"". 4 little girls went to Sunday School...and suddenly the church is bombed. But this film gives the viewer a closer look at who these 4 little girls were, their parents, & siblings & neighborhood friends share memories of these young ladies with the viewer. And that is the LIGHT in this film.

The DARK side to this film is when you learn a BOMB has went off inside the church. You learn that the girls was in the basement of the church or close to where this bomb goes off at. And when the images, of those gilrs bodies later flash across that TV screen it paints the UGLY FACE of just how EVIL the SOUTHERN WHITE PEOPLE (& KKK) were during this time particular time period. It emotionally UPSETS you to see the damage to these girls bodies after that bombing.

The worse part about most of the cases in the south where civil rights activists or innocent people and children were killed was that none of these MURDERERS were brought to JUSTICE (JAILED for MURDER) because the ""all WHITE"" Jury always found them ""NOT GUILTY"", or would dismiss all the charges. The judges were white, the jury was always ""all white"". The police department was always all ""WHITE"". Now fast foward to more recent times or say the 1990's, most of these same EVIL, KKK white people are now DEAD or EXTREMEMLY OLD. But in some cases they were re trialed (anyway) & sentenced these same murderers to a sentence they should have been sentenced to back when they commited these terrible crimes in the 50's & 60's. But they are so old that they'd DIE shortly after the new sentence. All those years they were FREE & should have been locked up or even sentenced to the electric chair.

What gives any person the RIGHT to kill anybody? Just shoot them like dogs in the street, or hang them from trees, or burn/bomb their houses & churches- Simply because they just want to be treated equally like the ""human beings"" they are?  Its just so SAD & SICK.",1266019200,4,2206,4.464019851116626

965389,5,6305080461,"September 15, 1963 is a date that remains imprinted in the minds of many--particularly, those from Birmingham, Alabama.  This was the day that four innocent young girls died in a racially motivated bombing at an African American Baptist church.  Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Cynthia Wesley and Addie Mae Collins were innocent casualties in a race war that raged on in the Southern United States, as well as the rest of the country.  This was a time when people of all ages were getting involved in the civil rights movement.  This included young children as young as twelve years old (the same age, relatively as the four young girls who were murdered).  This horrific crime motivated people to become more involved in activism, out of a sense of obligation, also to speak out against racially motivated violence, such as the bombing.  Director Spike Lee does a beautiful job of integrating film reel footage from the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, along with segments featuring family, friends, and religious leaders connected with the victims, recalling the events that lead up to the tragedy.  What's more, Coretta Scott King (late widow of Martin Luther King, Jr.), Rev. Jesse Jackson and Bill Cosby add their perspective  to the mix.  One of the most chilling parts of the film, for me, was an unsettling clip of the late Governor George Wallace, a notorious advocate for segregation.  When the elderly politician presents his African American ""right hand man"" as his best friend, a chill ran up my spine.

This is a really important documentary to see for several reasons.  For starters, I believe everyone should be aware of what took place on that fateful day in Birmingham.  Secondly, the film presents this tragic event in a very beautiful and respectful way.  Spike Lee is a tremendous storyteller and this piece is very understated, and, yet profound.  It's great to see that Lee knows how to make a great statement without resulting in exploitative tactics or manipulation of his audience.  The story speaks for itself and this is not an ego trip on the part of the filmmaker in any way.  It is a tribute to a tragedy that became a catalyst in the Civil Rights Movement, as well as the eventual prosecution of Robert Chambliss, one of three racists responsible for the bombing.

965414,5,6305080461,"Having spent time in Mississippi researching a documentary and reading just about every book about the history of the Delta (I recommend The Most Southern Place on Earth, The 1927 Flood and Worse Than Slavery about Parchman Farm) this is a story that shows both the end of segregation and the beginning of the civil rights era. I have always felt that the turning point was when the Black population realized that they grossly outnumbered the Whites and capitalized on naive but touching events like Rosa Parks' story to exercise their economic power. Certainly the story of Emmitt Till and the subsequent publication of his open coffin funeral in The Chicago Defender, the nation's most important Black newspaper at the time.
Since this time, Blacks have demonstrated their power in numbers, won the Civil Rights Act (ironically signed by Texan President Lyndon Johnson) and saw the Delta economy shift away from Agriculture with the arrival of the cotton picking machine, and economically to Tunica MS (the third most popular gambling destination in America)leaving the Blacks who won the civil right movement to work as dealers, maids and fish cleaners on the Catfish farms which dot the southern delta. The political gains (as with rights granted during Reconstruction) lost to mechanization, share cropping and the recommendations of government committees studying ""the Negro Problem"" and never speaking to one. Why Clinton is so respected by Blacks escapes me. As late as 1999, the president was from Arkansas, the vice president from Tennessee and the speaker of the house from Mississippi. Civil rights and Delta Blacks had lost their economic power after sacreficing these 4 Little Girls, Emmitt Till and so many lynching victim, free but living in poverty in a land where they grossly out-number the While population. It's a story worth studying and this is a video worth watching along with the stories of Rosa Parks, Emmitt Till, and Miss Evers Boys. Think it through; it's not changed much since those days. The Delta goes on forever; it gives new meaning to ""You Can Run But You Can't Hide.""
In its wake, it has given us John Lee Hooker, Sam Cooke, David Ruffin, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Muddy Waters, Pine Top Perkins, Al Green (from Arkansas), Robert Johnson, James Cotton, Robert Lockwood, Jr, Rev.

965503,5,6305080461,"I finally got round to watching this on the History channel last night. It was being screened as part of Black History month, which is in October here in the UK. It's a powerful piece of filmmaking. The movie had barely started and I was already feeling its power. The scenes of the brutality and injustice that black people had to endure during the civil rights movement, combined with the mournful voice of Joan Baez singing ""Birmingham Sunday"" were just too much. The tears came easily. I immediately knew I just have to have it on DVD.

Spike Lee earned an Oscar nomination for this documentary in 1997. I think he should have won, (the statue went to Mark Jonathan Harris's ""The Long Way Home""), as I think this is possibly one of the most significant movies he's ever made. He surprises by avoiding the firebrand rhetoric he is known for and he tells this story of how four young African American girls were murdered by white supremacist bombers back in 1963, without voice-over narration, opting instead for the story to be told by those who were there; namely the girls' friends and families, and civil rights activists who were in Birmingham at the time.

Using these interviews, some of which are joyful (those who prefer to remember the girls the way they lived), some which are excruciatingly painful (those still grieving for their loss) and some of which verge on the ridiculous (namely, that of former Alabama Governor George Wallace - you have to see it to believe it) and interlacing them with archive footage, Lee firmly establishes the segregational fervour and hysteria that existed in Birmingham, Alabama in 1963. The bomb went off on September 15th of that year and we are given a run up of the significant events that preceded the act and the devastating consequences that followed it. It is made very clear how Denise McNair, Cynthia Wesley, Addie Mae Collins and Carole Rosamund Robertson died and while it is made equally clear (by the comments from Bill Cosby, for instance), how the world is a much poorer place without them. More significantly - although this will probably never give the girls' families and friends any solace - it is strongly suggested that their deaths acted as the catalyst that led to the upward surge of the civil rights movement in the south, the black vote and the end of segregation. One man was eventually convicted for the murders but his co-conspirators have never been caught.

Critics and denialists often question the point of looking back, raking over the past, opening up healed wounds, blah, blah, blah, but I'm one of those that firmly believes that regardless of our skin colour, we cannot possibly know where we're headed if we don't have a full picture and clear understanding of where we've come from. I felt sadness, bewilderment and anger watching this but I also felt a lot of pride. This is an important history lesson. Let all those who have ears listen.",1161388800,14,2928,4.77120315581854
965504,5,6305080461,"As I viewed the 4 Little Girls documentary,  I was reminded of a time when I went to the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church to see where this horrible tragedy took place. A myriad of thoughts came through my mind-- anger, confusion, sadness. The video brought this sadness back.  I also felt sad for the white men responsible for killing the four girls.  Sometimes I wonder if they understood that on the day they murdered the four precious girls, they took a piece of heaven out of the consiousness of the sky, and indeed, lost a piece of their own humanity.  4 Little Girls taught me that--to hate causes one to lose his or her own ability to experience the gift of humanity.

965505,5,6305080461,"This powerful documentary is a wonderful tribute to the four young girls whose lives were cut short in the Sixteenth Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama on 15 September 1963.  First and foremost, it focuses on their lives, those who knew them, and the events going on in Birmingham while they were growing up.  It doesn't put the entire or primary focus on how they tragically were murdered, although naturally the bombing, the funerals, and the (rather belated) trials of the sick excuses for life who carried out the bombing are covered.  It's a celebration of life, not death.  (There are some brief graphic shots of the post-mortem photos, but as disturbing as these images might be, they carry home the impact of what really happened.)  It really is amazing that their friends, neighbors, and family members were able to retain such dignity and composure even when talking about such sad events and calling to mind people who had such short lives and who died in such an unnatural way.  While they'll be mourning for the rest of their lives, they haven't let the racist murderers destroy their lives.  They've bravely carried on as best they can.

For many young people today, be they white or African-American, the events of the Civil Rights Movement are ancient history.  This documentary brings that struggle to life, using great archival footage and making clear how long these injustices had been going on, showing how the authorities let people get away with discrimination and often even cracked down on nonviolent protests themselves.  They would even turn on people who came to these events as observers, like one photographer who wanted to take pictures of the Freedom Riders getting off of the bus.  We're also treated to footage of an old and decrepit George Wallace claiming he wasn't a racist, that he's changed, that his best friend in the world, whom he's travelled all over with, is African-American.  (This guy, Ed, did not look or act like someone who were Wallace's best friend when he was coaxed on-camera; the footage of Wallace claiming he'd changed was pretty unconvincing and seemed as though he were patting himself on the back and rewriting history.)  It really makes the struggle these brave people went through seem real, significant, meaningful, not just something that happened in the distant past and which is no longer relevant.  It's hard to believe that these things were going on only a few decades ago.

The opening and closing segments are very, very moving and powerful, and really give the viewer a sense of all that was lost that September day.  These were beautiful promising young girls who were loved by all and who loved everybody, and they were caught up in the middle of a racist society that hated and wanted to kill those who were different, murdered by people who were so filled with hate that they would even murder children.  They could have been doctors, lawyers, human rights advocates, teachers, writers, scientists, or just ordinary people who made a difference in their communities and who lived fine upstanding lives.  Instead they're remembered as civil rights martyrs, and people are left to ponder what might have been.",1144195200,12,3202,4.942164179104478
965506,5,6305080461,"This is one of the saddest, most gripping documentaries i have ever seen.  Four little girls is about the death of four young black girls who died in a KKK church bombing in birmingham, alabama and about racism & segregation.  Though not a thriller, it will keep you on the edge of your seat for its entirety.  Sympathy, empathy, tears, anger...you name it, and you'll feel it while viewing this film.

The personal interviews are powerful beyond words, and the interviewed can relate to anyone, causing even more empathy.  Once you reach the end, after the interviews (of the good and the bad), the autopsy shots and other images, plus effective music, that's it.  You feel like you could start a revolt against racism and segregation.  This could move a racist or any member of a hateful clan.  Experience this movie.",1138665600,11,819,4.75886524822695

I actually could not believe how incredibly exquisite that song is! I had never heard it before and sat completely riveted to the tv.  I actually called my husband in, started it over, and both of us just reveled in it's poignant beauty.

Spike Lee sets the stage of this documentary wonderfully  depicting the violent history of Birmingham and one of the reasons why those 4 little Angels died.

It's also striking how the tragedy accelerated the progress of civil rights by thrusting the race issue onto the world stage. Ultimately, these four promising, innocent girls are seen as martyrs to the age-old struggle for racial equality. A touching, insightful film from Lee.",1125878400,11,436,5.426470588235294
965509,5,6305080461,"This movie was just as chilling and gripping as other reviewers said it would be.. I was recently at the 16th Street Baptist Church where Addie Mae, Cynthia, Carole and Denise died. I also spent time across the street in Kelly Ingram Park which is a memorial to the battle for freedom the schoolchildren and adults of Birmingham fought through.  In the middle of that park are four reflecting pools that I think symbolize the lives of the four girls depicted in Spike Lee's documentary.  There are also four pillars with broken tops - one for each of those young lives.  I saw parts of Birmingham that I visited in this movie and it was chilling knowing I'd stood there weeks earlier, and that those girls must have walked through that same park on their way to church.  The only consolation in the face of such tragedy is that those girls have long been happy in the presence of God while we're still here trying to make sense of hatred so strong it would celebrate killing children... I think Spike Lee presented a tasteful account of history that also makes someone like me appreciate the freedoms so many lost their lives to secure for me..",1114128000,20,1144,4.565853658536585
965510,4,6305080461,"Having been to Birmingham numerous occasions and having met Mr. Chris McNair (who is now a county commissioner) as well as Carolyn McKinstrey, who also appears in this film (she was a survivor of the church bombing), I pretty much knew the story, but was pleased with the way it was told. A really fascinating segment for me was seeing the actual home movie of Denise Mc Nair and a couple of the other girls. Good job Spike. This is by far his best film.
The DVD extras are very good, particularly the pathetic interview with the notorious George Wallace uncut. Poor Ed (see the film and you'll understand that last statement).
Only minor complaint is that there isn't a scene selection on the DVD. You'll have to watch it all the way through. Also, it would be nice if some mention was made of Johnny Robinson and Virgil Ware (the two little boys who were also killed on that fateful Sunday, which is another story waiting to be told).
But that aside, it's great that Spike did this while so many of those who were around to remember all this are still alive. This is history that needs to be seen.",1075420800,43,1099,4.445544554455446

This is a powerful and moving film about people before, during, and after a great tradedy.  The stars of this film are the parents and friends of these children.
One of the most startling things is an interview with violent segregationist George Wallace.  Much like Micheal Moore handing the mike to Charleton Heston, the rope is handed over, and Wallace just hangs himself with it.  Like Heston, he is old and outdated, illogical and mostly just old.  You look at this old old man and you feel a strange pity, because he is so old and small and insignificant.",1071100800,12,685,4.581967213114754
965584,5,6305080461,"Spike Lee's _Four Little Girls_ is a masterpiece of continuous stream interview documentary of a period that Birmingham would like to forget, but with which it has yet to come to terms.  No holds are barred in the recounting of the 1963 Sixteenth Street Church bombing, which forever changed the face of the Civil Rights struggle in the U. S.  By interviewing the remaining family members, Lee brought home not only the human suffering of the surviving families, but made the world wonder what universal loss we all experienced in the deaths of these 4 little girls.
I had the honor of attending the world premiere of this film in 1997 at the invitation of the McNair family at the historical Carver Theatre in Birmingham, Alabama.  Seeing the historical film footage of places I knew myself as a child in that city, seeing the anguish again on the face of dear friends as they recount identifying their dead daughter, and knowing the effects this tragedy has had in Birmingham and elsewhere in the 40 years since it occurred made this much more than a historical documentary for me.
Its effect will be the same for you as well, I think, and well worth having this film as part of an American non-fiction collection.",1061683200,18,1216,4.699530516431925
965585,5,6305080461,"When I first saw this on HBO, I found it to be quite devastating.  It's a shame what happened to these children.  If I can say this, I cosider myself very blessed to have not been alive in those times.  I sometimes wonder if I, or anybody I know would have survived.  My parents were kids in that time, but where they lived (Northwest DC), I don't think they were affected like others.  Or at least, they haven't told me anything.
What happened to these girls as well as Emmit Tille disturbs me beyond control.  I got a library book about him, and I could not get past the page where they described his condition after his death.  I took the book back.
I am glad that this movie was not a dramatization b/c the realism of it just made it hit home harder.

965586,5,6305080461,"I've just watched this powerful film for the second time, and was just as devestated as on first viewing. I'm an avid viewer of good documentaries, and this is one of the most moving, disturbing I've ever seen. Spike Lee's film of the 1963 bombing of The 16th Street Church in Birmingham, Alabama, which took the lives of four little girls, and became a symbol of the civil rights movement, is not a film that will make you feel comfortable, and it shouldn't. Told through the recollections of their family members and friends, the sense of loss is overwhelming. The fact that all those interviewed, especially the little girls parents, display such eloquent dignity only makes it all the more moving. Though I have none of the ""attributes"" of the hateful leaders of prejudice shown in this film, such as George Wallace and the repulsive ""Bull"", as a caucasian male, my sense of shame, and, my outrage, only increased as the story forebodingly unfolds to the inevitable event itself. The segment where a modern day, supposedly repentant Wallace fumbles witlessly and unconvincingly is especially poignant. Spike Lee has not only crafted a work of art, but allowed the tragic story to tell itself. An unbelievably moving film that will leave you deeply saddened at the irrational, hateful taking of the lives of four beautiful little girls, whose futures, if they can be compared to any one of their family members or friends, held such undoubted promise.

The movie over all was a good movie and it is ashame after so many years it had to take Spike Lee to get the picture of the story of the girls out for the world to understand and make a mental note of it,1041033600,7,489,4.051546391752577
965588,5,6305080461,"Spike Lee's 4 Little Girls was briefly released to theaters in 1997 to qualify for Oscar contention as Best Documentary. It was first broadcast nationwide on Home Box Office. It is a remarkably clear-eyed telling of an incendiary tale--how four young black girls, ages 11 to 14, were killed in a 1963 bombing in Birmingham, Alabama.
I hesitate to compare 4 Little Girls to Schindler's List, and yet it has that same quality of being a restrained, dignified recounting of an emotional incident. Spike Lee had been wanting to tell this story since before he became a noted filmmaker, and Lee brings all of his remarkable talents to bear. The movie is not flashy, just quietly gripping.
Lee frames the incident within the bigger picture of the Southern civil rights movement, particularly as it took place within an inflamed Birmingham. We see the town's police commissioner, Bull Connor--described by one interviewee as ""the dark spirit of Birmingham""--keeping order in town while driving a tank painted white, an image that is sure to bring gasps to those who aren't familiar with the full story (which, I humbly admit, included me). And we see a repentant Gov. George Wallace, dragging a reluctant black colleague on camera so that Wallace can introduce him as ""my best friend in the world."" (Notably, the ""friend"" looks quite unconvinced.)
It is that Wallace footage that might seem the most showy in a documentary otherwise bereft of editorializing. But it seems right to include the footage after seeing how the segregationist tactics of Wallace and others led indirectly to the deaths of Denise McNair, Carole Robertson, Addie Mae Collins, and Cynthia Wesley. Using little more than home movies and interviews with surviving family members, Lee brings the dead girls back to life and shows us that, when racial stereotypes are accepted and even honored, individual tragedies are the result.
Mostly, the story is told through simple, heartbreaking facts. Chris McNair tells us of the day he had to explain to his daughter Denise how she was taken by the aroma of a cooking hamburger at a lunch counter but could not eat there because she was black. And the film comes full circle by pointing out the inexplicable resurgence of black church bombings in the 1990's.
Most of the victims' relatives, understandably, become quite emotional on-camera. It can't have been easy to reopen these old wounds, but 4 Little Girls makes you grateful that they endured their pain to do it. I only wish the movie had been up for Best Picture, as it is worth a dozen L.A. Confidential's.
4 Little Girls is rated TV-14 for violence, brief nudity, and racial epithets.",1009411200,125,2652,4.948430493273543

But, because I already had an inkling of what I would see I won't say I was stunned by anything I saw.  I was left with a slow, lingering, disturbing, gnawing feeling--perhaps like a hole. This is the type of movie whose scenes will replay in your mind when you can't sleep at night.  I think Spike Lee produced in me just the feelings he was trying to evoke.  I found the interview with former governor of Alabama, George Wallace, particularly chilling and masterfully crafted by Mr. Lee. The interviews with the parents and siblings of the victims were heart-wrenching without being melodramatic or sensationalistic. This movie is not only about the girls but the Civil Rights struggle in Birmingham.  As a history teacher, I can hardly imagine a movie which would be more effective in covering the issues, the sacrifices and the legacy of the Civil Rights movement.",1003190400,52,988,4.857142857142857

I also remember the dread sometimes of reading Jet Magazine for you could count on pictures of dead African-Americans who were victims of racism.  But this was the way of the world then.  I am a grown man and I rarely cry at movies but it is quite impossible to hold back the tears looking at this.  It is just as vivid to the parents, relatives, and friends of the four little girls involved in this horrific crime today as if it happened yesterday. Say what you will about Spike...HE WILL MAKE YOU CONFRONT IT WHETHER YOU LIKE IT OR NOT!

Sometimes this is the only way to get the point across that we have simply got to do better.  The movie is quite intense because the memories of the people most intimately involved have not faded in 38 years.  One mother even admitted that she doesn't even harbor any hate anymore and has resigned herself to the fact that that would simply not do any good at this point; at the same time this is something that she STILL has to work on daily through the grace of her religious convictions.

An even more chilling scene was where George Wallace, segregationist EXTRAORDINAIRE who supposedly modified his beliefs in his later years, was insisting that he and this black man were and always had been the best of friends!!!...it is obvious to the naked black eye, that the man in question most certainly did NOT think that but knew it best to let senile old George Wallace believe that if he must. (forgive my lack of objectivity here, but this one scene really got on my nerves!!!)

965592,5,6305080461,"I personally feel that this film, despite it being a documentary, is Spike's finest work to date.  As far as a feature film is concerned I would reserve that honor for the epic 'X'.
I really don't know where to begin  because this film is so involving and emotional for the viewer.  The  primary reason for this is because Spike does a masterful job of weaving  the historical retelling of the events in question with the numerous  personal recollections of the girls' friends and relatives in addition to  putting the incomparable ignorance, haughtiness, and stupidity of southern  racists on display.  But perhaps most importantly the film brings life to a  period of overt bigotry and violence that many people may consider to be  long past but are sadly mistaken.
I am always in awe of the phenomenal  courage exhibited by black people during that time period.  Well in  practically any time period in America for that matter.
Running through  it all is just a tremendous sense of humanity.  For me it's hard to  describe in words.
To truly understand and appreciate is a right that I  think is reserved only for those who were actually there enduring the  horror of these events.
