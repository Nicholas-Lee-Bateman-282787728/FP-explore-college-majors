4221355,1,B003Y5H5GU,"This film was rubbish!  It ripped off other films left right and center to the point where it was more of a casserole than a motion picture.  The plot consists of a group of 20 something Hollywood types getting caught up in a Los Angeles based alien invasion.  First off, the cardinal rule of making this work gets broken: You will care absolutely nothing for the well being of the characters in the film; they're the type of Film People that make you long for Turner Classic Movies.  They throw a party, crash around the apt., and spend the rest of the film looking through the closed blinds trying to avoid getting spotted by the creatures on the other side that are causing the end of the world. In this case there actual is an alien invasion going on, but usually this just happens because someone brought meth to the party...  I was waiting for one character to start looking for strange entities polluting his body-oh wait, he did! However, he didn't clean the bathroom with a toothbrush afterwards or even try to take the microwave apart. I never give away the ending of a good movie so at the end they wind up being eaten by the alien and his brain allows him to become one of the creatures.  I just sat around watching this tripe ripping off other films and wishing the good folks at Asylum pictures could pop over to clean this up.  For a film that relied on heavy special effects setpieces, the seams showed when  there were no human characters inserted into the CGI backdrops, I could've used Peter Graves running from a giant gila monster a couple of times.  Usually I suffer these things gladly- I love a good ""bad"" movie, but I do not tolerate insincerity... I feel like I just got duped out of 15 dollars to watch a special effects reel.  Oh, and ye gotta love a character who objects to another one smoking near her because she's pregnant and she doesn't seem to care a whit that a nuke just went off a few miles down the road- (which didn't seem to cause any ground damage by the way).  This film is the Ishtar of scifi (with apologies to Ishtar).  I had hoped the best for Eric Balfour, but the rumors are coming true: he is the new Ted McGinley...",1289606400,21,2167,4.39
4221356,1,B003Y5H5GU,"How this movie made it to the theatre is a matter for the Criminal Division of the MPA {If only one existed}. The short version is that ""Skyline"" will go down as 1 of the 10 Worst SciFi Movies ever,  with the added tag of having 1 of the top 3 WORST MOVIE ENDINGS OF ALL TIME. The longer version is the movie starts off with a flash of special effect & Oh no. Then rewinds 15 hours with the intent to give some back ground to what you just saw. Unfortunately the replayed 15 hours only gives slight insight into our uncomplicated, shallow characters with absolutely zero information about the attack when it happens again. The mediocre story has few moments of ooh & awe in it & drags along to the Horrific ""only in writing that is"" brainsucking end of the film,  yes I said they've apparently come to suck our brains. Which is by the way the only tiny thing we learn about the aliens in the entire movie. Which leaves me forced to use the cliche' >> 90 minutes of my life I'll never get back !
  Amazon I recommend you order only 100 copies for the entire country !",1289606400,3,1066,4.21078431372549
4221357,2,B003Y5H5GU,"Judging by the trailers, Skyline looked pretty good, but I should have listened to the critics. The story, dialogue, acting and even the SFX were boring. Could the aliens be any less interesting? I will admit that the first 30 minutes were entertaining and the final 5 minutes or so got a little better, but when you have to suffer through the other 60, it's not worth your precious time.

The cast features supporting actors from shows like Dexter, Six Feet Under and Scrubs, but no big name stars. That normally wouldn't bother me, but it was desperately in need of a strong central performance.

The CGI wasn't too bad, but the overall scale was just not grand enough. Most of the time is spent inside a building with a handful of survivors as they watch the destruction that is going on outside. When the military finally shows up, it's a rather pathetic attempt. A dozen drone fighters, a helicopter carrying a whopping three soldiers, and a few fighter jets thrown in for good measure. Wow, don't mess with us, right? I know it was just one of many cities, but it still seemed weak.

Overall, Skyline was one of worst movies I've seen all year. Nothing about it is worth recommending other than some decent FX and a semi-unique (that I still don't quite understand) last couple of minutes. Let me put this way. Next to Skyline, Independence Day is a modern cinematic masterpiece. Ouch, it hurt just typing that.",1289606400,4,1417,4.637450199203188
4221358,3,B003Y5H5GU,"I just saw this last night at the theater. I wanted Resident Evil 4 but had missed it. I'm telling you this to let you know I had absolutely no preconceived notions about SKYLINE. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even sure what it was about. It's gets right to business without a whole lot of background, which when it comes to action movies, is what I want.  I liked the characters. Neither Eric Balfour nor Donald Faison are your typical hero hunks, but look like normal guys and react in much the same way. The special effects here are totally awesome. If you're a special effects freak, then this is the movie for you - you'll love it. On the other hand...I'll get to that in a bit.

By now I'm not giving anything away by saying this is an invasion movie. Bad guys show up, some really original ideas and some not so original. I was reminded a few times of the 'floaters' in MATRIX, and occasionally another movie would come to mind, but it was still fun. At least one moment literally had me jump completely off my seat. (MOVIE SPOILER ALERT! I can't help but mention this, but what kind of freakin' idiot trys to escape FLYING, incredibly fast spacecraft in a convertable? Seriously! You know there ain't gonna be a good ending here!)

Basic plot: East Coaster and his pregant girlfriend show up in LA to visit his old buddy on his birthday. They party big, enjoy the good life for about a day, then mysterious lights begin falling from the sky and things start to go wrong. Also wrong, in my opinion, was the amount of time that passed before all hell broke loose via the US Air Force and LA gangs.  I would have thought the retaliations would have been damn near instantaneous. (Really, I live in a small town and I guarentee every redneck here would have been out blasting with everything but missiles!)  Then there is the escape when they're in a perfectly good penthouse. Only one of the 5 people in the apartment seems to have a grasp of common sense but they all finally agree to give it a shot.

I don't know what happens at the end. Nobody does. After a really good time the writers just decided 'to heck with finishing this thing. Let's go out and get a beer or two, maybe a pizza. Let the copyboy end the movie' and so, apparently that's what happened. This was without doubt the worst, crappiest, loser ending I've seen in ages.  Normally, when 3/4 of a movie is this entertaining then I'll give 'em a 'go ahead and try it' review just cuz I was fairly impressed with the rest of it. Not this time. It got 3 stars for good acting, great special effects, and some jump out of the seat moments. I do not recommend seeing it, though, because the ending is just awful. No, the LACK OF ENDING is just awful. I'm not real sure what they thought they were doing in the last 10 - 15 minutes of this movie, but writing an ending sure wasn't one of them.",1289606400,2,2860,4.324626865671642
4221359,5,B003Y5H5GU,"My son and I loved this movie. The FX are awesome and Eric Balfour delivers a great performance. This movie has action, suspense, explosions and a seriously hot star. It's worth the watch if you want to be entertained by a movie.",1289520000,10,229,4.476190476190476
4221360,2,B003Y5H5GU,"You no longer need a screenplay to make an alien invasion movie. All you need is a special effects studio, a lot of computers, and creature designers that go for all the reliable hallmarks, like flailing tentacles. You also need plenty of death and destruction, and it must all be contained within the borders of a major city - say Los Angeles or New York, because God knows an alien species prefers them to cities like Pittsburg or Chicago or Seattle or Cleveland. Scenes like that serve as a nice counterpoint to hilariously unconvincing lines like, ""Everything's under control!"" Convention dictates that whoever says something like this is acting out of desperation, not determination, and this is why we already know that the character will bite it within the next ten to twenty minutes, if not sooner.

There was a time when we could rely on an alien invasion movie to tell us a story, no matter how shoddy the special effects, no matter how embarrassing the performances, no matter how weak the premise. Even the lowliest B-movies of the 1950s had actual writers attached to them. They depended on science fiction to send allegorical messages about social issues, nuclear war, the horrors of technology, or political corruption. ""Skyline"" takes the exact opposite approach; it's a technical achievement trapped in a narrative so incompetent, it doesn't even earn the distinction of a B-movie. There is no story. There is no theme. It makes not the slightest effort to be consistent, plausible, or understandable. It provides us with no resolution, apart from the possibility of a sequel. Not bloody likely, if I may quote George Bernard Shaw.

It's sad to think of all the talent that went into the special effects, knowing their efforts were wasted on a film undeserving of them. We are provided with a few genuinely good looking shots; one of my favorites was of the aliens sucking hundreds of people up into their mother ship like bugs in a vacuum cleaner. I also liked the aliens themselves, even if tentacles stopped being original long before the release of ""Independence Day."" They were designed by Alec Gillis and Tom Woodruff, Jr., best known for their contributions to the ""Alien"" franchise. I've watched interviews with them. They seem like nice guys. Sometimes, though, I wonder if they go into a film project without really knowing what the director has in mind. Did they realize that their designs would be featured in a film that makes no attempt to explain them?

For a movie with no plot, there is an awful lot of setup. It begins with couple Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and Elaine (Scottie Thompson) flying into Los Angeles from Brooklyn to visit their old friend, Terry (Donald Faison), who struck it big as a Hollywood special effects producer. Their inconsequential human drama is rudely interrupted when, at 4:30 the following morning, the city is attacked by extraterrestrial forces. Their weapon of choice isn't a laser beam or a death ray, but a brilliant blue light; once you look into it, you're hopelessly drawn in, like a moth is drawn to a flame. Your eyes cloud over. Dark tendrils spread across your skin like bruises. What they want with us is left hopelessly obscure, although we are treated to a number of shots of glowing blue brains being sucked out of people's heads - with the spinal cords still attached, no less.

Every movie like this deserves at least one glaring technicality. ""Skyline"" provides us with several. Immediately after everyone wakes up at 4:30, for example, both Jarrod and Terry head to the roof of the apartment complex to get a better view; they emerge in full sunlight, which must mean that it took them at least three hours to climb a few flights of stairs. Later on, when the television is turned on, it's discovered that every local news broadcast is missing their anchors. This begs two questions: (1) Why are the cameras still on, pointed at empty desks, and (2) if no one is there to operate the cameras, then who's capturing live footage of the military as they attack the alien ship? It can't just be some yahoo with a camcorder. How would this person know how to patch into the local satellite feed?

There are many instances of little alien scout ships and even the aliens themselves getting blown to bits in an explosion, only for them to repair themselves, get back up, and continue attacking. At what point should it become clear that fireballs and missiles have absolutely no effect? After the third attempt? The fourth? Perhaps the characters in this film are firm believers that if at first you don't succeed, try, try again.

At a certain point, perhaps because I was desperate to find some angle of approach, I thought of all the ways that ""Skyline"" was a veiled commentary about the dangers of Los Angeles celebrity culture. It seemed to work: It takes place in the apartment complex of a special effects producer, who surrounds himself with high tech gadgets and young, gorgeous women; when the aliens appear, they use a beautiful light to suck people in and eat their brains, just as the promise of fame and fortune can lure you in and turn you into a drone. Scottie Thompson is even supplied the line, ""I hate L.A."" Alas, shots near the end of the film made it clear that no message was being sent, that the film's only aim was to be a shiftless CGI extravaganza. I had, in short, wasted nearly 100 minutes trying to apply reason to an unreasonable film. Don't make the same mistake I made.",1289520000,13,5473,4.761854583772392
4221361,1,B003Y5H5GU,"Holy cow....where to begin? Is this what Hollywood has stooped to? This by far is THE WORST FILM of 2010. Talk about bad Sci-Fi. This is what I get for seeing a movie with nobody actors in it. They might as well have shown this P.O.S on the Sci-Fi channel on Mystery 2000,that's where it belongs. To be merclessly heckled and picked apart from start to finish. I swear people must have been *high* to give this script ""the green light"". I mean...really? This film plays like a rough draft from start to finish. The screen writers must have  written this dribbleb when they were in film school. I can tell you the grade I'd give them...a ""D"".In all honesty, I would have flunked them.

Skyline is a chaotic film that makes little to no sense with characters that you don't care about. Who gives a damn about a bunch of L.A D-Bags who are being kidnapped by aliens and consumed for unknow reasons? I was more or less confused throughout half the film,the only thing you could follow was that this was a hostel take over,thats it. You know the film is set up to be a bad one when the brther eats it before the first half  of the film.

Oh! lets not forget the oscar winning ending. Quite possibly the worst,unclear ending on screen in years. It more or less set itself up for a continuation/sequel. Really?Aren't there enough bad sequels out there?Why the urge to continue an already horible film? I have to admit, I did not want to see this film, but did so to appease a friend of mine who suprisingly liked it. Well,to each his own. This makes ""District 9"" look like ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"".

Do yourselves a favor. BOYCOTT THIS LOUSY FILM. It doesn't deserve a penny,and watching it only wastes an hour and fourty minutes of your time. I wanted to leave and get my money back. I wish I had. You will regret paying to see this film in any venue. I wouldn't even rent it if it were free. You have been WARNED.",1289520000,32,1920,4.366946778711484
4221362,1,B003Y5H5GU,"I just got back from watching the premiere showing of Skyline, the alien invasion film with a bunch of no-name actors by Rogue Productions.

The film starts out pretty poorly and goes downhill from there.

A friend and his girl are visiting from the East Coast and they meet a rocker friend of theirs who has been offered a job at the rocker's place of business. What the business is exactly and who the people are at this party they end up in is fuzzy at best. Character development is not the strong point of this film.

And then it gets worse. The main guy's girl admits she's pregnant and they are both tearful. The guy is unsympathetic and she spots some unethical behavior from the guy's friend and wonders out loud that their life will be that way.

The film unnecessarily started out with blue lights and Jarrod (the guy friend) gets zonked by the blue light and grows veins on his face. Flashback 15 hours earlier. Why? What was the point of that? Usually a flashback is intended for further expostulation but not in this case. There was no reason for it.

So we see the blue bombs falling across Los Angeles. The lights are so bright that the drunken four people that we really have zero sympathy for these cardboard characters to even care, wake up. One gets sucked up along with hundreds of others.

There is much struggling for doors that won't open or unexpectedly close. This happens during most of the film. Closed doors. Locked doors. Doors that won't open fast enough. Blocking doors with a refrigerator. Stuff like that. Sigh.

The army finally shows up after two days and nukes Los Angeles and the ship. With very little actual damage to the buildings and the people all survive the nuke. The creatures however are just mad and continue the rampage.

Will nothing stop them? Will nothing stop the mind-numbing dialogue and overacting?!?!

The creatures were the only saving grace in this film. With the large claws and glowing blue heads, they were quite formidable. I think they stole the design from Cloverfield since a lot of the creatures looked like the monsters in that film.

Jarrod somehow develops super-strength which doesn't last long. The couple that we don't care about eventually get sucked up into the ship. And the film ends with a hint of a sequel. Let's hope not!

Bottom Line:

The bottom line is don't waste your time on this dreck. I mean, the slow motion running as the monster looms overhead went out with the Six Million Dollar Man! And showing the passage of time with people running really fast was quite bad too. The dialogue was right out of One Life to Live (apologies to fans of that show).

Put on Independence Day or rent Cloverfield. Superior films to this piece of blue sky! A colossal disappointment!",1289520000,,2755,4.632443531827516
4221363,3,B003Y5H5GU,"""Skyline,"" for me, is a case of expectations getting dashed, but in a good way.  When I first saw the trailer for the film I thought, ""Oh wow, this looks awesome!""  And then I learned that the guys who directed ""Alien vs Predator:  Requiem"" were making it, and then I thought, ""F***.""  I had very low expectations for ""Skyline,"" and when going in, basically hoped that it would be at least tolerable, and not an incoherent mess of dark, murky shots where you couldn't tell what the hell was going on.  Imagine my surprise then, when I was surprised to find myself not only enjoying Skyline, but actually liking it.

The best way to describe the plot is:  ""Cloverfield, but with aliens from outer space.""  Several attractive, snotty young people party like crazy, only to have their totally awesome lives interrupted when giant vacuum cleaners from space descend onto Los Angeles and start sucking up all the humans in sight, and start hunting down all the others who are in hiding.

""Skyline"" has all the elements of your standard B grade Sci-Fi film, including characters who's names you can't remember, giant monsters, lots of explosions and gooey, icky stuff.  But what makes it work for me is that for 80% of the film, we're with the main characters, and only know as much as they know.  With no phone, no internet, and no television, we're in the dark as much as they are, and the film has an intimacy that works really well.  Coupled with the brisk pace, the film moves along nicely from one event to the other and constantly has new things to show us, including the invaders themselves, who, thanks to some excellent visuals, are suitably creepy and menacing (especially when we find out exactly what they're after).  But what really stands out about the film is the menacing tone, of tiny humans struggling to survive against an overwhelmingly powerful foe, which leads to an ending that, while feeling half finished, makes me have to give the filmmakers credit for trying something different.

Overall, ""Skyline"" is a solid B movie.  It has thin characters (one of which, the building manager, for some reason, gave me the impression that he desperately wanted to rape the main character the first chance he got), and a thin plot, but it makes up for it with lots of action, a real sense of ""being there"", and a sense of meance that I really liked.  If you go in expecting a sci-fi adventure film that's essentially a blend of ""Cloverfield"" and ""Independence Day"", you'll probably like it.",1289520000,91,2498,4.708045977011494

SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT
This is one of those movies that look so good from trailers, but when seen in its entirety, reality sets in.  This movie looks like an intelligent, well made, alien invasion film.  It is not intelligent, and it is not well made.  The film quite simply is a cheap  sci-fi flick we call ""B-movies"".  Complete with over the top shrieking women, and macho men who bite off more than they can chew, this film is a total disaster.  The story begins nowhere, goes nowhere, and winds up in a mucky & grotesque startling turn for an ending which makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.
The film wastes  about a half an hour on senseless back story about the unlikable characters, and it does it in such a way that it has absolutely no impact on the story itself.  When you take out the senseless and worthless backstory/setup, the film has approximately an hour of actual time to do everything else with the alien invasion.
Even the alien invasion is a HUGE letdown, showing us nothing more than what the trailer already had.  The majority of the storyline is the unlikable characters holed up in a single building.  There were 3 things that kept popping into my mind during the movie:
1>This is exactly like a cheap B-movie with unknown actors, bad acting, and crappy special effects.
2>I was bored, and wanted the film to end
3>Aside from the crappy backstory that wastes the first 30 minutes of the film, the rest of it is a badly done space invaders version of Cloverfield.  A giant monster savages LA, while the unlikable characters struggle to avoid its minions which get deployed into the high rise apartment building, looking for humans to eat/abduct/decapitate.
I am thinking for the words to express how bad this movie is, but I just can't think of words which would express it.  I LOVE Sci-Fi films having anything to do with space, aliens, futuristic battles/weaponry.  This film satisfies none of those desires.  It leaves you wondering how the director fooled us all with a cool trailer.  This movie will officially be recognized as one of the biggest flops in modern sci-fi history.  I have a feeling this film had a decent budget, but the movie comes off like a bad B-movie with no plot.
Let's talk about the plot. There is none.  Simply idiots who we don't care about anyway trying to avoid being taken by the Octopus creatures with 18 Kmart blue light special light bulbs for eyes.  Yes, all the aliens seem to have the appearance of a giant Octopus and blue light bulbs for eyes.
In short, if you see this movie, you will agree with everything I have said unless you are an idiot who is entertained by bad sci-fi flicks with bad special effects, and a total lack of anything resembling a plot, or likable characters.",1289433600,13,2789,4.620689655172414

The residents of Los Angeles are awakened in the dead of night by an eerie light beaming through the window. Like moths to a flame, the light source is drawing people outside before they suddenly vanish into thin air.

As the world unravels around them, our band of survivors soon discovers they must fight for their lives against the onslaught of a mysterious alien horde. Who or what are these extra-terrestrials and how long before mankind succumbs to their overwhelming power?

SKYLINE is a high velocity special effects bonanza in the tradition of the films Cloverfield and 2012.

On November 11, 2010, producer Brett Ratner said on the Opie and Anthony Show that the film cost $10 million to make. The Brothers Strause insisted that at the time of their first foray into Sci-Fi films, they were at the time in the process of putting into action a sequel Sci-Fi film with their own money and try to find another distributor to release it.

Andrews Blu-ray Review: SKYLINE [2010] stars Jarrod [Eric Balfour] and Elaine [Scottie Thompson] who fly to Los Angeles to visit Jarrod's old friend, Terry [Donald Faison], who works as a special effects man in the film business. They throw a wild birthday party for Terry, who cheats on his girlfriend [Brittany Daniel] with his assistant [Crystal Reed]. That night, huge alien spaceships attack the city of Los Angeles and begin abducting humans by literally sucking them up into the sky. Smaller alien probes then begin scouring the city, using special lights to hypnotize their victims. Can the five heroes survive by hiding out in Terry's apartment, or should they try to make a run for it? Better still, can they eventually discover the reason for the attack?

Directed by The Brothers Strause, who are Colin Strause and Greg Strause. SKYLINE has an immediate low-budget feel to it, since the story takes place in a big city of Los Angeles and has a small cast of unknown actors. Things get more interesting when the aliens attack, but I was shocked when I read a load of criticism of the CGI, well I thought they were awesome, as the Visual Effects were by Hydraulx, which is a company based in Santa Monica, California, known for their work in films such as Captain America: The First Avenger and The Avengers, which shows you how good they are. The SKYLINE Sci-Fi film tries to keep you guessing until we are into about 45 minutes into the film, and things really hot up, especially with the aliens behaviour who start to rampage and take control of especially the humans, who feel at the time they will not defeat these grotesque aliens. Still, the combination of giant monster attacks and the characters may ultimately earn the Sci-Fi film the cult/camp following it so rightly deserves.

Directors Colin Strause and Greg Strause include some excellent and brilliant sweeping overhead shots. The film circumvents a really refreshing viewpoint and this time told solely through the eyes of the resident apartments experiences with the invasion by focusing on the main events in what is happening to this main group of desperate people. After Neil Hopkins is sucked away the inevitable bickering and explosions ensue until the final scene in the film.

Despite some flaws, I really enjoyed the film, despite all the negative comments I have read about this film and especially by the ending, which gave a hint of a follow up film, then you see the credits roll, interspersing names of the cast and crew with images of the fight scenes with a renegade human turned into an alien via his rebel brain fighting again the invading aliens. Best bit was seeing several hundred people getting sucked into the sky are very impressive. Anyway, here is something to make you think and that is, is SKYLINE the worst film of 2010, well not for me, as it has some real edge of your seat action throughout the film. But of course there is still something to ponder about with the Blu-ray release of the follow up film to see what new angle they can produce. Still, if it does happen, that will be an achievement to dwarf all other low budget Sci-Fi films ever released. But of course everyone who have really given this film a hard time, well you are out of order, as I really enjoyed it and of course is a modern version of The War of The Worlds and far more impressive and exciting than that of the turkey that Steven Spielberg produced and especially the pint size bad actor Tom Cruise, who is definitely up for the Raspberry Award.

Blu-ray Image Quality  Momentum Pictures brings us this Sci-Fi Blu-ray with a very good 1080p image presentation and is of course enhanced with the 2.40:1 aspect ratio that really shows off the special effects really well. The computer generated images mesh extremely well with the live action for the most part and especially in HD, the alien space ships look spectacular and especially in one scene, where the characters are attacked by the alien arm that looked really good and very scary. The drama of the film SKYLINE does unfold in lots of different locations, especially at night and during the day.  All of the interior shots looked really good and great contrasts, especially with the alien light that takes place inside the apartment building. The image is equally good when the action moves. But overall, I have to say, the Sci-Fi film looks totally incredible. Thats not all that hard to pull off when you are shooting on RED, but the amount of effects work they pulled off in-camera is intuitive and.

Blu-ray Audio Quality  Momentum Pictures gives us this Blu-ray disc with a decent 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio experience, and is the best thing about this film and it is very impressive at times. You also get an amazing constant presence here with big monsters stomping around, planes flying overhead and gun fire from down below.  This is a very immersive and impressive sound mix and they did a very good job with panning the sound effects around all the channels to really good effect. Dialogue is very clear and intelligible sound-wise and it is not overwhelmed by the sound effects, especially as these sound effects are very realistic and do a lot to help this film. But again, overall the sound design was 100% ace and they did a brilliant job via this brilliant Blu-ray disc.

Blu-ray Special Features and Extras:

Feature Audio Commentary with Directors Greg Strause and Colin Strause: Here we are introduce to both Greg and Colin who directed the film SKYLINE, and informs us that this was their first foray into independent filmmaking world, and were totally involved in all departments relating to making the film. They also inform us that the interior shots of the different condors were their own apartments, which they were slightly reluctant to allow the film crews in, as usually when filming has finished, usually the apartments get trashed. Also all the specific music used was offered to the brothers without any problems. A lots of the time the brothers talk endlessly about all the technical problems that occurred and how using the RED digital cameras, they were able to film in very low light, but again all the technical talk would only be of much more interest to people involved in the film industry. Also they talk about stuff that I found very tedious, boring and totally pointless, especially always stating the obvious what we are viewing that we can work out for ourselves. I have viewed some dumb lame audio commentaries. But this takes the biscuit, as The Brothers Srause must be the most boring people I have ever heard in a very long time and should again get the No. 1 Raspberry Award for the most dumb down audio commentary to insult us the public and I am so glad I am not the only one who had to endure the most cringe worthy comments of people who amaze me who was ever able to direct the film SKYLINE. But what also galls me, is that these two brothers have the most boring droning voices I have ever had to endure a whole audio commentary, and at times I nearly dropped off to sleep a few times.

Audio Commentary with Co-Writer/Producer Liam O'Donnell and Co-Writer Joshua Cordes: Here we are personally introduced to Liam O'Donnell and Joshua Cordes and are here to talk through the film SKYLINE. They also inform us that the whole process from start to finish took only 11 months and was a very intense process, and feels very surreal that with this recording they are not involved with the film, but again at the time of this recording, they were in the process of final preparations for the follow up film. They say they did not have a huge budget, but were really blessed with the Groups who produced the songs in allowing their music to be used in the film. Once again, like the previous audio commentary, these two people just ramble on about nothing in general or of interest, and eventually starts to get tedious and boring information, and would be more interesting informing of information we do not know about the film and behind-the-scene information, instead of just constantly the obvious what we are viewing in the film that we can work out for ourselves. So once again, this audio commentary was after 10 minutes onward got totally boring and again did not inform us of anything new and the film and like the previous audio commentary, the best thing they could of done was to have someone make the recordings disappear and not able to add them to this Blu-ray disc, then we would not have to endure such garbage and I cannot understand how the executives at Momentum Pictures and IM GLOBAL approved the inclusion of these two audio commentaries as an extra, then is would of improved this Blu-ray disc 100%.

Special Feature: Deleted and Extended Scenes [2010] [1080p] [2.40:1] [6:35] Here we get to view seven different scenes, which consist of the following: Oliver in Lobby; Tom & Candice in Closet; Jarrod & Elaine Paintings; Extended Cache; Ray Extended Party Scene; Painting Scene and Candice & Oliver in Kitchen. When viewing these scenes, you have the optional audio commentary from Director Greg Strause and Colin Strause, Co-Writer/Producer Liam ODonnell and Co-Writer Joshua Cordes. Plus, you have the choice of watching these scenes either separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Alternate Scenes [2010] [1080p] [2.40:1] [2:29] Here get to view two alternate scenes, which consist of Candice Sorry and Oliver's Backstory. Once again, when viewing these scenes, you have the optional audio commentary from Director Greg Strause and Colin Strause, Co-Writer/Producer Liam ODonnell and Co-Writer Joshua Cordes. Plus, you have the choice of watching these scenes either separately or Play All.

Special Feature: Pre-Visualization [2011] [1080p] [2.40:1] [9:59] Here get to view two alternate scenes, which consist of Pool Escapee and Rooftop Rescue, which are basically CGI rough drafts of the two scenes, where most of the special effects were needed. Once again, when viewing these scenes, you have the optional audio commentary from Co-Director Colin Strause, Co-Writer/Producer Liam ODonnell and Co-Writer Joshua Cordes. Plus, you have the choice of watching these scenes either separately or Play All.

Theatrical Trailers [2010] [1080p] [2.40:1] [3:45] Here we get to view two original Theatrical Trailers for the film SKYLINE, that consist of Teaser Trailer and Theatrical Trailer and as usual you can either view them separately of Play All. You also have the optional extra of viewing these trailers with the audio commentary by Co-Director Colin Strause, Co-Writer/Producer Liam ODonnell and Co-Writer Joshua Cordes. But please be warned, as this audio commentary is a totally mindless joke, as these people are not fit to make any comments, because they are so arrogant in their over the top blatant attitude and their comments makes me wonder how they ever was able to ever produce the film SKYLINE and should have been voted THE No. 1 most annoying people on Planet Earth and also should have been voted the No. 1 Raspberry Award for the most annoying idiots ever to be allowed to voice their obnoxious comments towards us the public who put money into their bank account.

Sneak Previews: MONSTERS [2010] [1080p] [1.85:1] [1:27]; SEASON OF THE WITCH [2010] [1080p] [1.85:1] [2:20] and SNICKERS [TV Advert] [2010] [1080p] [1.78:1] [00:32].

Finally, with the film SKYLINE one of our heroes gets flattened by a giant marauding bug-beast, a supporting character gets his brain sucked out, the US air cavalry pitch in to the join the fight, and things start to look up. By the time one of the leading actors takes it upon himself to batter a flying squid-creature to death with a brick, its becoming clear that resistance is indeed futile and its just easier to submit to the Sci-Fi films increasingly berserk parade of B-movie thrills, but for a good twenty minutes SKYLINE fulfils its B-movie remit. Imagine its 1953 and you are watching a Sci-Fi film called Brain Suckers from Planet X will over time get a cult following like all past low budget films of this genre. You pay your money; now it is up to you to decide whether it is a good film or not, I personally cannot comment, whereas I leave that in your capable hands.

4221652,5,B003Y5H5GU,"The most immediate difference between Skyline and other alien invasion movies is the way the viewer witnesses the invasion: you see it playing out from the viewpoint of normal people inhabiting large upscale apartment buildings in Los Angeles.  There are no scientist characters to delve into what's happening, no live tv reports showing the situation around the globe, and no one discovers any piece of alien technology that they're able to decode and thus learn the secrets of the invaders.  Early one morning the ships simply come, with their mesmerising blue lights and their technology that raises people up by the thousands and delivers them into the waiting mothership.  Those not immediately taken try to run or hide or fight.  You do see, a little ways in, the military response, but again you see it from the viewpoint of civilians and you don't get inside the soldiers's heads and know what they know, leaving the whole thing both mysterious.  At this point the levels of the aliens's powers may start to seem unrealistic to some, although I myself am more of the mind that IF an alien species was ever so advanced as to easily travel the distances between stars, we really can't predict what else they'd be able to do.  Some people have found the cast of characters unlikable or unrelatable.  This one I can see the point without really agreeing 100%.  Yes, a few of the characters aren't necesarily the most lovable, but you've got either characters who come off better, and a few somewhere in the middle.  The main couple, for instance, was worth rooting for.  When it comes to visuals and special effects the film is simply amazing, particularly with what you see once you're a way into the movie.  It's only at the end that Skyline starts dealing out hints at what exactly the aliens's objective is, and there again you see it from the vantage point of regular people and sort of get to interpret it on your own.  I found it definately to be one of the more eerily believable of the 'full scale alien invasion' genre as well as one of the best, and I hope the rumors of an upcoming sequel turn out to be correct.",1474416000,2,2128,4.645333333333333
4221723,2,B003Y5H5GU,"""Skyline"" is a deeply-flawed movie made worse by its wasted potential. It's a movie with a solid cast, extraordinary special effects, and a unique alien invasion that proceeds to make all of them boring.

The movie is about a handful of people, mostly a group of partying young people, who end up trapped in a high-rise condo during an alien invasion. Eric Balfour plays a New York artist lured by his best friend Donald Faison to L.A. for a birthday party, and a chance to work in the movie business. After a wild party, the two (and their significant others) are plunged into chaos when a mysterious blue light begins pulling people out of the building. It turns out that alien ships have invaded Earth, and the group struggle to survive.

While the alien attack is meant to drive the film, this movie is really a bottle story. Most of the movie is set inside the best friend's condo, which in real life is the home of the co-director Greg Strause. Seriously. And that's the biggest problem with this movie. What you need to know and was most hyped is that the co-writers and co-directors Greg Strause and Colin Strause run their own SFX company, and it shows. All the effort was spent on the special effects, and everything else was rushed and on the cheap. That's not my opinion - it's a matter of record that they spent about a million on the actual filming, and ten million on the special effects. Unfortunately, what the Strause brothers didn't realize is that movies are about more than special effects.

The alien-invasion story is depressingly thin. Other than the fact that the aliens use a blue light to coax people out of hiding for their capture, there's not much to make them feel unique. We don't find out anything about them, such as why they would travel across space just for human brains, why they want to suck out human brains, and how their society functions besides brain-sucking. Also, the aliens look like swirling masses of tentacles and blue lights, so you never get a sense of what they're like.

In a story like this, it's all about the characters. You need characters that are likable, so that you want them to escape and fear for their safety. The characters need to be in conflict so there's enough tension between them to provide another layer to the story. The characters are the biggest failure of ""Skyline."" The opening where we first meet them makes them look like a bunch of party-obsessed losers. Not much else in the movie takes that impression away. As a result, I didn't care what happened to them, and was kind of glad when some of them got killed.

Skyline is a classic ""idiot plot,"" where the characters act like idiots, because if they didn't the story wouldn't work. Most of the movie is spent with the characters arguing over whether they should leave the safety of the condo. Some say they should try to escape, others say they should hold out in the condo. Frankly, the characters really have no good reason to leave the condo, except ""We have to try."" There is a vague goal of wanting to get onto the ocean, because they believe the aliens won't follow them there. No real reason given for why they believe this so strongly, so it doesn't feel like a goal at all. So most of the movie is spent with the characters running out of the condo, getting attacked and occasionally killed, and running back into the condo again. Rinse and repeat.

That's not to say the movie is useless. The special effects are really good, and occasionally incredible. You have the usual scenes of alien motherships hovering over the city, and jet fighters fighting the aliens. But we also see floating alien probes, humans being sucked into the alien ships, alien gorilla-like monsters, and an entire scene set inside the slimy, creepy, Gieger-esque alien mothership. The problem is these scenes often have little to do with the actual characters. They spend more time looking out of the window at the alien attack than they do actually involved in the attacks. That gives the whole invasion a distance that made me wish we followed someone else who got to do something besides whine.

Really, that's the worst part about ""Skyline."" It's not that it's a terrible movie all the way through. It's that there are moments when you really enjoy the movie, followed by other moments when you're bored silly, followed by moments that make you want to grind your teeth, followed by another moment when you find yourself enjoying it. The result of bad decisions, laziness, and a lack of focus turn a great movie into an awful one. In the end, it just wasn't worth the effort to sit through it.",1474416000,2,4613,4.638922888616891

The characters were so annoying that I almost stopped the film after 15 minutes.  But eventually the real aliens come - full sized, full bodied, fully crushing and killing.  The US nukes them, American soldiers fight back, and the main characters - those who are still alive - run around trying to survive.

I love Independence Day, War of the Worlds, and other alien invasion films. This film has no big-name actors, and there is a minimal storyline. But the aliens are actually more believable, and the ending is more believable as well.  Not to ruin the ending - but in this case the aliens don't travel across the galaxy but forget their one fatal flaw (water, computer viruses, earth microbes, etc).

I liked the use of the AT-4, drones, including stealth drones, and F-22's.

The creatures themselves looked a lot like ones that have been in other movies (I guess they're union employees), and the ending of the story was impractical.
But who knows? Maybe there could be one man, who just happens to be young and good looking, who would be able to resist the influence of the alien creatures. Love can have strange and unpredictable powers.",1461024000,4,798,4.510344827586207

The video and audio were good, but I just finished watching my Blu-ray copy, and the sound and video are outstanding, the NF copy appeared murky which I accepted because of the type of film and the audio was good.  On Blu-ray, the video is terrific, its murkiness is there for the all the smoke and fog, etc. but the colors, especially the skin tones are beautiful, quite natural and appealing.  The murky fog comes in beautifully when the aliens are first shown, coming out of a shroud-like cloud, and there are so many scenes which are mind-blowing, suspenseful and scary.  And the sound, so omni-directional -- and my subs got a good workout, I think they need a rest after that!

Who cares about special effects. We have just about seen it all anyway.

Any good movie needs good dialog, not ridiculous ""oh my god"" over and over again. Scriptwriter needs to be fired.

I agree with one reviewer ... the gf finds out about him and all he has to say to the girl he was having an affair with is ""get in the car"" in a tone that suggests she was the bad one in that caper.

While impossible to say how relevant any alien invader movie is there is no terrestrial biological correlation relative to intelligence & benevolence except among a very small percentage of people.  Again, using terrestrial organisms for comparison typically the most intelligent species are predatory ones b/c of the learning curve & strategy, collective strategy to continue catching, ambushing, etc the prey.  Arguably, the apex predator, humans, @ least until we collapse under the weight of our numbers, intelligence often translates into technology, technology to instruments of war, therein lies ""more intelligent' people to oppress lesser so populations.

Presuming Aliens on our doorstep have malevolent intentions then it seems unlikely they would bother w/communications.  So, very plausible we'd not know their intentions, strength, numbers, etc.  Further ""food for thought"" is if we think about it a little bit most resources found on earth in relatively scare supple are far more abundant elsewhere & much easier to obtain.  The most unique ""resource"" specific to Earth & thus far has not been found anywhere else is protein & biomass more generally.

What I find curious is given the limitations human senses, (there is arguably more we're unaware of in our own natural world that exists all around us to which we're oblivious) that it's extremely plausible if, indeed aliens exist & their intentions were malevolent I think there is a good chance we may not even be aware they're here.

Anyway, good sci-fi... I've found that often times the casual viewer doesn't appreciate, has a different set of expectations, etc. & so these movies often get panned.

This sad excuse for a movie was directed by the Brothers Strause, who also brought you the equally bad Alien vs Predator: Requiem. Basically, they're a pair of guys who specialize in making commercials and doing special effects work for other, better directors. At some point, they apparently got the idea they could make movies themselves. They really can't.

Aside from some decent special effects, this whole thing is at a direct-to-DVD level of quality.... lifeless acting from some second-string TV stars, weak script, no plot development... and literally, NO ending. The film just STOPS in the middle. I'm not kidding.

I guess I could write 1000 words explaining in detail just how lame this trainwreck is, but I think it'd be more effort than the filmmakers actually put into making it. Not worth my time or yours. It's not even bad in a funny way, it's just bad.",1402185600,5,901,4.837662337662338

For the most part I liked the movie.  The acting wasn't bad, everyone was fairly believable, but the dialog wasn't great.  I didn't like how the movie started, they start with a scene then jump back in time to set it up.  It isn't like we're going to walk out at the very beginning if we don't see any action....  That said, the beginning was way too long.  A bunch of that could have been cut, and the film would have been better for it.  It just dragged.

The middle of the movie, people ran around like they usually do in an emergency and made things worse.  It just wasn't interesting to watch them doing it.

Some bad things:

The whole ""We'll escape on a boat"" plan.  Who would ever go with this plan?  They're aliens and they have aircraft, it isn't going to be all that hard to catch a boat.

Oliver's death didn't make any sense.  He was so set on living a couple minutes before that, so what's with killing himself suddenly?  There just wasn't any justification.

The alien science was way too unbelievable.  The blue light that does everything... captures people, sucks them up, repairs anything.  If they have that why do they need anything human???

The ""ending"", the movie just stops... This lost a whole star all by itself.  It looks like just ran out of budget and decided to take what they had to theater anyway.  It just screams give us a sequel, but given what they did make, I sure wouldn't.  Would it have been so hard to have some sort of conclusion?",1374364800,,1513,4.4021739130434785

4222891,2,B003Y5H5GU,"I have the feeling that the Brothers Strause wanted to create an alien invasion movie that was more realistic, focusing on ""ordinary"" people.

And that isn't a bad idea. But clearly it takes a lot more talent than those brothers have, because ""Skyline"" is a frustrating mass of ""could have beens"" and ""if onlys."" The actors do good jobs and the special effects are absolutely spectacular, but most of the movie is just a bunch of people hanging around an apartment building, bickering with each other.

Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) are visiting his best friend Terry (Donald Faison) in Los Angeles, where they party in Terry's skyscraper apartment building. But the fun is interrupted when Terry offers Jarrod a job that would require moving to L.A., which Elaine is not happy about because she has just found out that she is pregnant.

Then giant blue lights fall from the sky -- followed by alien ships that can mesmerize and abduct people. Along with the building manager Oliver (David Zayas), the little group hides in Terry's apartment, and occasionally makes a doomed effort to escape the building. That... pretty much takes up the entire plot except for the last fifteen minutes.

""Skyline"" might have been a great story if it had only been forty minutes, maximum. Instead we get a ""middle section"" that is so dull that you might end up tearing out your OWN brain -- people bicker, cower in fear, bicker again, try to escape, fail to escape, scuttle back into the apartment, et cetera. Eventually you just want the characters to do ANYTHING other than scuttle around the apartment building like beetles.

And yes, it is painfully boring. Even worse, we are given glimpses of much more interesting events here and there, before switching the action back to people hiding in an apartment. Hello, fighter jets! Why are we not following your pilots instead of the people who are gawping open-mouthed at the window? Things do become more dramatic and action-packed in the last fifteen minutes... only to serve up a non-ending that leaves the whole story hanging.

One thing I will say is that the special effects are glorious -- the ships are giant biomechanical monstrosities like flying squids. Too bad the aliens' reason for coming to Earth makes NO sense, and is never explored.

However the actors aren't to blame. Balfour and Thompson give excellent performances as a pair who are truly in love, and Zayas is pretty fun as a hard-nosed guy whose take-no-prisoners attitude applies to everyone. However, few of the actors are ever given much to do, and most of the characters aren't really fleshed out much.

""Skyline"" has a lot of promise, but it's wasted with dull, repetitive storytelling and a frustrating non-ending. Even the glorious special effects can't save this.",1367193600,,2817,4.928270042194093

So we're once again plugged into the life of Los Angeles, where a party is happening and one friend named Jarrod (Eric Balfour, TV's ""Haven"") and his wife are expecting their first child, so what's better than to enjoy the party life with Jarrod's long time friend Terry (Donald Faison, TV's ""Scrubs"") and a few other people. Well during the night one of the party guests sees a mysterious blue shining light and is taken by it, Jarrod also looks at this light but isn't taken just knocked for a loop. The next morning the city seems awfully quiet and after a trip to the roof of the apartment building it becomes obvious why, aliens have invaded, they shine the blue light to attract the people, like moths to a flame, then the ships suck the people up.

Jarrod, Terry and the few survivors decide to try to escape, well that doesn't go so well, a giant alien foot just crushes Terry's car at one point. The invaders aren't exactly the smartest after the initial attacks as they can't seem to capture Jarrod and his pregnant wife for the longest time. The locations also don't change for a good while after the party is finished, in fact besides a trip to the roof to see said sucking up of people the movie doesn't leave the apartment for a while which really drags the movie down.

Unfortunately the movie gets far, far more ridiculous as the flick advances, the conclusion is just terrible and with no characters to root for why try to give an emotional pull towards the end out of nowhere. I will say one thing in defense of this movie, for the small budget the special effects are remarkably well done, very detailed in parts and they're easily the one highlight of the movie. Sadly the rest from the script, dialogue, characters to the acting is just plain bad, it really seemed like a thrown together film and it ends up being very bland and hokey. * out of 4 stars",1367107200,,1894,4.484057971014493

Even if an alien is killed by being struck in the brain they are using, they can grab someone close by & use the brain to keep moving again.

HE is almost taken at the beginning and saved by his friend, who he fails to save. HE then though a series of events looks at the light 5 more times. This only starts to strengthen his mind against the mind control. his body and force of will grows stronger as does his reasons to survive (Elaine and the unborn child).

IF you watch it you will understand what i mean by Making of a Hero, not going to spoil it. But I believe this is an EPIC ending. The Effects worked, I felt it was artistically done.

the beginning didn't seem promising but that was just background on the characters.

The problem is with most people watching this movie, they don't want to wonder. They Probably don't read science Fiction and don't see how this a is better written then others. science fiction artistry goes over most peoples head. Heck most people only like star wars because of Han solo and the Light sabers, or Star Trek because James T. Kirk like to sleep with every alien chic. I give you the acting could have been better, but I believe Eric Balfour was amazing for this role.

How they had the brains to make it to earth in the first place is unknown,  Humans are mesmerized by a bright light and sucked up to the hovering space ships by the tens of thousands. While our small band of survivors try to hide out in an apartment building, the military bravely takes on the aliens.  Scores of planes are knocked out of the sky but one still manages to make a direct hit on a ship with a nuke.  Maybe the military needed to check the expiration date on the nuclear material.  There is a big blast, the ship goes down in pieces but then slowly reassembles itself.  The creatures and their equipment survive the nuclear furnace without so much as a scorce mark.  Meanwhile, a few ground troops manage to take out a creature with a shoulder fired missle.

With a memorable cast including Blonde girl, Pregnant girl, Who's that guy and Guy from Scrubs, this masterfully written script was truly brought to life. It really challenges the viewer, forcing them to ask difficult and meaningful questions like ""Did I actually pay real money to see this?""; ""Why didn't I use monopoly money?""; ""Was that the guy from scrubs?""; ""What job do these people have that allow them to live a life of luxury?""; ""Special effects?""; ""Why do I believe in brain sucking aliens more than that?"" and ""How does someone get paid for less effort than any one of my bowel movements?""

4223031,1,B003Y5H5GU,"I'm a big sci-fi fan, and not particularly snobbish in my tastes. So I went to see Skyline, with my wife, on the opening weekend. And like most of the audience, I didn't leave the theater saying, ""that was awesome"" but rather ""what a piece of crap.""

Skyline stars Eric Balfour (the big jawed guy from Haven) as Jarrod, a graffiti artist (just what the world needs) who's going to LA to party with his rap mogul buddy played by Donald Faison(Turk from Scrubs). Their partying is interrupted by the invasion of aliens who can hypnotize any human who looks at them or their machines. Why did the aliens invade? They came to steal human brains. They strip the brains from the dead humans they collect and use them as biological computers to run future death machines. I think the movie would have been much better if the aliens actually ate the brains as a delicacy rather than used them as bio-tech.

I don't know what the budget was for Skyline, but it looked cheap on the screen. The best of the special effects are indistinguishable from those of Battle: Los Angeles. The Directors of Skyline were responsible for the visual effects for Battle: Los Angeles, and failed to inform SONY Pictures of this conflict of interest. If you see the two movies side-by-side it looks like the Skyline producers, picked every special effect left-over on Battle: Los Angeles' cutting room floor and stuck it in their movie. Now, Battle: Los Angeles came out four months after Skyline, looking almost identical. So visually the movies are very similar, but Battle: Los Angeles was a far, far better movie with better acting and much better screenplay. Unfortunately, because it was associated with the crapfest that was Skyline, Battle LA didn't do very well.

I just want to reiterate that the weakness of Skyline was in its writing and casting. The idea that a superior alien force would come to Earth to harvest human brains pushes me a couple steps too far over suspension of disbelief. Eric Belflour is a great supporting actor. I've enjoyed his work on Haven and Six Feet Under. But he simply doesn't have the presence to be a big screen leading man. Donald Faison was unconvincing as a street-wise hip-hop mogul.

If you want to see a better alien invasion movie I'd reccomend either Battle: Los Angeles - a much better movie - or Battleship - a far, far better movie. If you just happen to be into brain harvesting then order yourself some cervelle de veau take-out from a French bistro and stick a copy of Skyline in the DVD player.",1356393600,,2526,4.669662921348315

4223064,3,B003Y5H5GU,"Skyline(released Nov/10)is a so so Sci Fi thriller,minus the thrills and chills. In an industry which has seen an amazing rise in the phenom of directing/producing brothers,comes this one directed by the Brothers Strause. Known mostly for their music video works and their first directed disappointment Alien Vs Predator:Requiem,the Strause Brothers make the same mistake here as in the AVP movie;their inability to gain little to no empathy from the audience for their characters/and or situations. If the audience has no stake in it then the film will fail to deliver no matter what.
The plot involves a couple of friends who come together;one Jarrod and Elaine from New York go to L.A. to visit friend Terry and his fiance Candice. Elaine gets sick twice during travel which of course seems to indicate she may be pregnant,which is later confirmed at Terry's apartment. Terry throws a party for the arriving couple and at about 4:30am the morning after a strange but very bright light source and sound emanating from outside their high rise building,slowly wakes them all. One of the first to peep out from behind the blinds to see what is going on starts to turn;first the eyes a milky white,then the skin becomes veined and blackened. In a short time he gets sucked out of the apartment. Jarrod comes in to find the mans girlfriend crying and he stares at the light and also starts to turn,while walking towards the balcony. Just in the nick of time his friend Terry intervenes and saves him.
When they step back for a moment they realize that there are groups of strange lights throughout L.A.,and it is a city under siege from some unknown force. After a while the lights ascend into the sky and all seems to be peaceful until there are noises heard and dust clouds seen. Something was left behind. Then the lights return and this time it is with spacecraft. The spacecraft can be seen literally sucking hundreds of people at a time up to their craft,through the lights. From here on out it is a matter of survival as the group try to get out of the building,which is being swept from the outside by flying bio-mechanical beings,probing for survivors/victims. They try an escape from the underground garage in two cars but get stopped immediately by a huge Godzilla like bio-mech,which kills Terry. They flee inside and back up to their apartment.
The building security man joins the now smaller group. From the window they observe a huge mothership which is now under attack by the US Air Force. One Stealth fighter manages to hit the thing with a nuclear missile and it brings it down,but it is not out,as a host of smaller bio-mechs emerge to again terrorize the populace. Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof only to be sucked up into one of the ships. And inside we go. Here we find the aliens need,like the reanimated corpses of Return of the Living Dead.....brains,and lots of them! They use the human brains to run their bio-mechs. They get Jarrod's brain and Jarrod is actually able to take control of himself/the bio-mech and saves Elaine from a fate worse than death. The film ends as bio-mech Jarrod stands alone against the aliens in the ship.
This film,along with a lack of good characterization,also has some pretty glaring script/plot flaws. More than half way through the movie Jarrod asks the security man what he thinks those things are out there. Now a four year old could tell you that they were under attack from aliens,but that word is never used in this film. So that makes the characters stupid,therefore there's no empathy. How stupid?....very stupid,and that is stranger than the movie itself. The security guy also gets on Jarrods back as soon as they get back up to his friend Terry's apartment. Jarrod is grieving over his best friends very recent death,and he has this guy,for no reason,playing macho man,on his case and telling him to snap out of it. The normal reaction from anyone would be to deck the guy. But Jarrod just seems to say to himself""yeah,you're right,I should suck it up"".Then we have that Stealth fighter jet that nukes the mothership. Now if you have a CGI sequence like that,the whole idea is to make it seem real,is it not?If you have not seen the film,that pilot must have been on speed because he was doing flip overs and maneuvers right out of a cartoon show;avoiding almost everything the mothership was throwing at it. That made the entire good guys coming to the rescue thingy,all too fake and totally unrealistic. Obviously the Brothers Strause had a plot thread they wanted sewn up and that Stealth jet was going to do what they wanted it to do,no matter how it looked.
Technically speaking the movie is in its w/s a/r of 2:40:1 and is clear and crisp. Extras include commentary,some alternate and deleted scenes,and more.
All in all a disappointing Sci Fi romp. The idea was certainly a good one,but its execution failed miserably,as the film lacks any empathy for its characters and/or situations,which are at times unrealistic and phony. One to avoid.",1351468800,,5017,4.767816091954023

Even though they're a machine they still have romantic feelings for the female lead character. Not exactly the same scenario but close enough to make me think how cool the ending was.

The rest of the movie is just action sequence after action sequence and it never stops. You actually forget the cheesy actors and get distracted by everything else that's happening in the movie.

4223068,4,B003Y5H5GU,"I'm going to say what might be obvious if one actually pays attention during this movie.

Although the character interplay tends to be typical Hollywood cliche characters dramatizing how shallow their personal lives are when the characters who are not committed to a long term relationship,(unlike the main surviving couple at the end of the movie) end up being more concerned with how mad they are at another character, than they ""should"" be about the fragility of life in a totally surrounded by flying alien machines high-rise apartment/condo complex.

What this does is detract away from the tension somewhat of the lurking alien menace waiting just about everywhere outside every window.

The ending pretty much gave away the main plot behind why all the humans were being harvested in the first place.

Given the visual cues, it's apparent that the alien machines decapitate the head from each body, reprogram the organic brain with some blue energy as they extract the grey matter from inside the skull, then it's placed into a waiting machine like cyborg of various functions, usually tasked with harvesting yet more humans.

The odd twist at the end has the guy being decapitated, yet somehow, perhaps because he survived the blue light trance that was used to disable any resistance to being abducted, his brain did not react the same way to the blue energy and it's attempt to reprogram his mind apparently failed as his mind was deliberately colored bright orange, then placed inside a tall cyborg body where he resisted the transfer at first, then grew angry and fought off the machines when it attempted to remove his girlfriend's mind.

I can't recall if like in predator 2 if the machine knew or realized the girl was pregnant and whether or not it mattered if removing the brain of the mother would immediately kill the embryo, again there's got to be an easier way to make the plot-line more accessible to people with short attention spans who apparently really hated this movie because maybe it was too complex and that didn't sit well with a lot of reviewers.",1343260800,,2079,4.875354107648725

4223142,2,B003Y5H5GU,"NOTE:  THIS REVIEW HAS NO SPOILERS!

I really wanted to like this film.  I love sci-fi, I love alien invasions, I'm a fan of Donald Faison..especially if he dances.  Well, he doesn't dance.  Nor does this movie.

I wanted to give it a chance.  I saw it took an original approach to a War-of-the-Worlds-type of alien invasion: when the attack occurs, what if we situate almost the entire movie in an apartment, and have the characters WATCH most of what's going on?  That, and having only a couple of B list actors in it probably saved the producers a crate load of money so they could ramp up the special effects a bit.

But the problem is there's no real plot, either.  Just people running around.  While, yes, I'm sure that some people might indeed act that way in a situation like this, I don't think it was wise to make it comprise the whole plot line.  It was extremely thin, repetitive, and frustrating.

And, as for characterization, I really found it difficult to like ANYONE in this movie.  As the opening scene begins with the drunks left over from a party at a Hollywood special effects director's house, you don't find them at their finest.  And they just get worse: one's bitchy, another's grouchy, and our star has just found out his girlfriend is pregnant.  Ouch.

All in all, the writers never gave us a reason to root for anyone in the movie, especially when the hotel concierge shows up.  At first I thought Ah!, a guy with some sense.  But then he turned out to be perhaps the most unlikeable of all...a tough thing to accomplish in this film.

And a word about Eric Balfour, our star.  Does anyone find the guy attractive?  He looks like someone beefed up Adrien Brody and then squished his face in an elevator door.  I don't get why he's a star, here or in shows like ""24,"" or anything, in fact, that isn't about circus freaks.

The special effects were pretty good, and I have to admit I liked the approach that the characters could only watch sporadic military involvement.  I would guess that would mimic real life: why would the average person know what the military was planning?

I also liked that the TV was no help at first...that seemed clever and possible.  But a few minutes later the TV was displaying great camera shots of a military assault against the aliens, complete with zoom lens shots and steady cam and great editing...pretty contradictory.

The film was directed and co-produced by the Brothers Strauss, who are mostly special-effects guys, cutting their teeth in the X-Files movie, the iceberg sequence in ""Titanic,"" and a bunch of other films like ""The Fantastic Four"" and ""The Day After Tomorrow.""  So, good effects: check.  Actors and story: Nope.

So, overall, the film was weak.  If you want to see a good film with a similar premise, see ""The Darkest Hour.""",1337385600,,2807,4.608080808080808

Given certain fantastic capacities of the aliens, who aren't really interested in explaining themselves, what would the attack be like? How would people react?

It's hard to identify with anyone. Some SFX mistakes are noticeable, and some juicy potential shots are missed. The plot is hollow and predictable up to the very last scene, which delivers an ""Oh, BROTHER"" moment. The ending is a slap-in-the-face fizzle.

4223212,3,B003Y5H5GU,"Skyline has been almost universally panned for its poor acting, lack of coherent plot, and an unsatisfying ending.  But old school science fiction fans know better; there was a time when ""to steal our brains"" was a perfectly reasonable explanation for an alien invasion.

Don't believe me?  There's another work of fiction about an alien invasion that strikes without provocation, use massive cephalopod-like machines to harvest humans as raw material, and features no characterization to speak of - none of the principal characters are even given names.  If Skyline's plot sounds familiar, it's because I just described H.G. Wells' War of the Worlds.

The film takes place primarily in one penthouse flat in Los Angeles.  Artist Jarrod (Eric Balfour from 24) brings along his girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) for Jarrod's best friend's birthday party, Terry (Donald Faison looking considerably more cut than his Scrubs days).  Terry, who runs a special effects shop, is wildly successful enough to fool around with both his girlfriend Candice (Brittany Daniel) and his live-in assistant Denise (Crystal Reed). The invitation to the party is just a pretense to lure Jarrod into moving to L.A. to work for him, news Elaine doesn't take well since she has a surprise of her own - she's pregnant.

That's the full extent of Skyline's character development.  Denise and Terry are unsympathetic because of their infidelity; Elaine's pregnancy demands sympathy; Jarrod's unhappy reaction to Elaine's pregnancy means he has an opportunity to grow emotionally as the invasion progresses. There is nothing subtle in Skyline.

The attack begins with a blue light, which acts much like the green light left by the Martian viridigen gas.  The blue light lures humans like moths to a flame, long enough so that they can be vacuumed up by giant floating ships to be collected for more sinister purposes.  Though the protagonists manage to escape this fate they soon discover that the invaders have other tools at their disposal, including a Matrix-esque octopoid entity and huge semi-humanoid walkers.  Both are focused on retrieving live humans to extract their brains, just like Wells' Martians and their penchant for human blood.

The survivors witness the American military's response, featuring flying MQ-9 Reaper drones and a X-47B launching a nuclear warhead at the opposition.  The desperate battle is reminiscent of the HMS Thunder Child taking down two Martian tripods in The War of the Worlds.

The survivors quibble about fleeing to the coast and then, when they finally decide to run for it, are herded back into the building.  With the exception of large shots of the skyline, the movie takes place entirely in this one set, which is how it kept such a tight budget.  The money was obviously spent on the alien machinery, which are terrifying to behold.

Skyline is relentlessly paced, debuting one horror after another.  It features iconic imagery meant to create an impression, from screaming humans sucked up into the sky to giant walkers slurping people into their clawed palms.  There's not much room for explanations or even a plot.  This is to the film's detriment; it takes lazy shortcuts, the most egregious being an impossible gas stove explosion.

But to criticize Skyline for having murderous aliens with no discernible motivation is a disservice to the genre. If anything, Skyline is far too slavishly devoted to its source material.  There isn't much of an ending so much as a setup for a sequel, but I fully expect the second installment to conclude with the aliens dying from ""the putrefactive and disease bacteria.""",1327190400,3,3636,5.134125636672326

4223214,1,B003Y5H5GU,"If you're laughing through most of what is supposed to be a serious movie, that's not a good sign.
When a group of friends meet up in LA for a birthday celebration, their partying is interrupted by the descent of some hungry aliens looking to harvest the human race.
Skyline is another alien movie that retells the same, old story of aliens taking over the earth. They tried to make it different, but failed to successfully do so. They also failed to capture our interest. They also failed in making a good movie.
To begin with, the movie did not make the characters engaging enough and while they attempted to make us feel emotionally involved by making one of the main characters pregnant, it did not work at all. Most of the characters dropped like flies, and you didn't really care. The acting was okay, but really suffered from a lack of good dialogue. The movie was painful to listen to whenever the characters had to speak more than a few words at a time.
While attempting to be a different kind of alien film, the movie had too many likenesses to other more popular alien films such as Independence Day and War of the Worlds. The music was overdone and tried to make you feel more emotional at certain parts, but it only ended up adding to the predictability of the movie. If the music starts getting triumphant, you know it won't last. And to sum up the rest of the film: The slow motion parts were ineffective, the action was ridiculous, the scares were clich and predictable, the ""redshirt"" extras were obvious, but the special effects were good.

**Spoiler Alert**
As the movie was getting close to ending, I couldn't help myself from laughing out loud. The jet crashing over Jarrod and Elaine and then smashing into the giant alien harvester was so over the top that it made the stunts in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Live-Free-or-Die-Hard/dp/B000VNMMR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Live Free or Die Hard</a>&nbsp;believable.
The emotional ""I love you"" moment as Jarrod and Elaine were getting sucked into the spaceship was so ridiculous that I was rolling on the ground from laughing so hard.
But Jarrod becoming an alien and then saving his wife as the ending of the film had me guffawing away on the steamship of hilarity.
**End Spoiler Alert**

4223215,1,B003Y5H5GU,"SPOILERS - Thin plot, hate-able characters, bad acting and just plain noisy.  So...if those appeal to you, then you're in luck.  The cliche-filled chased-by-aliens scenes got me hitting fast forward after they just seemed to keep repeating themselves, with slight variations.

Here's how it goes: Gravity-defying jelly-fish looking alien lurks outside (with equally gravity-defying mother ship in the distance), peaks in, victims hide...end up making some sort of noise to attract alien, alien schloomps some sticky-tounge thing out and grabs them and chomps them (this happens continuously). Those that live, get to repeat that cycle time after time, each repeat getting noisier than the previous. I actually chuckled when the one car left the parking garage tried to leave, only to get instantly stomped on by a (as-of-then unseen, but not unexpected) giant one of the buggers the instant it past the garage door. Next up: Enter the Air Force to fly some nifty stunts (a direct rip-off of Independence Day's similar scene) with some stealth planes to nuke one of the biggies...BOOM...it works...oh, wait...no, it doesn't work. It reminded me of the Monty Python scenes in Life of Brian - ""He's not quite dead yet."" The laws of physics break (again), somehow protecting the mothership from being vaporized by heat hotter than the sun...and the leftover little aliens start rebuilding immediately and rapidly and seem ""pissed.""

The enitre scene is like a direct rip-off of Independence Day...except at first we were supposed to breath a sigh of relief that they'd really been killed. But then the movie would be over then, so on we go. So after what seems to be one endless chase after another, our heroes finally end up getting captured and our hero Jay (grossly and stickily) gets converted into an alien who's conversion foreshadows (by the wiggly brain action) who he really is and that he isn't on board with the aliens.

There's no scientist who figures it out at some point.  It's just chaos, terror, and something of a study of what it might be like with aggressive beings who traveled light years just to come to Earth.

Skyline is about a group of yuppies in Southern California trying to survive a massive alien invasion. Another reviewer commented that this was basically ""watching people watch the movie Independence Day""; and that is surprisingly accurate.

The aliens unleash a blue light that alters your face and puts you in some kind of hypnosis for them to suck you up into their machines.

Most of the dialogue consists of, ""go...GO!"" and ""Hurry, get down. Shhhh"" But who was really expecting anything other than a mindless alien-destruction movie?

It came out around the same time as Battle: Los Angeles so the comparisons are everywhere. This one isn't as boring, it's not as long and it plays as more comic-booky than realistic.

4223332,2,B003Y5H5GU,"I rarely watch SciFi movies because in general they can be counted on to be trite, unimaginative, and deathly dull. This movie is no exception save for the special effects, which are really good CGI. But the plot is, well, entirely vacant and the acting is wooden and the script was apparently written by an eight-year-old who clearly enjoyed highly caffeinated soda more than literature of any kind. Pretty much no cliche is left unturned, but the funniest moment for me was when the terrifying alien invader - that has resisted all manner of hi-tech weaponry so far - is vanquished by one angry young dude's fists of fury. This is very much a case of ""use the farce, Luke, use the farce"" and if you're a fan of time-wasting empty trash then this is absolutely the movie for you.",1318982400,,780,4.578571428571428

Some hot young people party all night, then wake up in the morning to a really bright light shining through the windows which sucks people out the windows.  Yep, it's alien abductions...  The light goes away pretty quickly, and then the hot young people are stuck in the sky scraper they partied in.  Most of their neighbors are gone, the ones who remain are boring/old and cultural differences hamper cooperation, and aliens of different varieties troll the city for surviving people to capture.

Execution can make that a good premise or a bad one.  In this case, there wasn't anything that made this movie special.  The hot young people have various little problems to make you care about them:  cheating couple, pregnant chick, etc.  It doesn't matter.  There is no reason to care about them, becaues they pretty much look hot and scream while occasionally running or driving a car or shooting a gun or whatever.

In summary, you should watch a different movie.",1318896000,,1015,4.843023255813954
4223334,1,B003Y5H5GU,"Good grief, where to begin? I thought it would be fun to see the neighborhood torn-up by some aliens. I wasn't expecting much and i'm often content to suspend my disbelief for a the sake of a couple of hours of eye candy.
But this movie sucks the Big One mosly because it's too violent for kids and too stupid for adults.
I can forgive cliches because cliches are the hammer and nails of storytelling - sadly there's no lumber to apply them to here and even the charming Donald Faison is unable to do anything with his crappy lines.
Short list of the most jarringly awful moments in no particular order:

1: Aliens who can cross interstellar space in mighty biomechanoid ships are here. Why? to harvest OUR BRAINS for their mighty biomechanoid war fleet. Seriously. All that tech and they need our brains to run it? GTFOOH.

2: The same aliens, who aside from crossing interstellar distances are also capable of suppressing the will of terrestrial life forms in seconds with a blue beam are apparently totally unable to detect you if you hang a bedsheet over the window. Maybe it had a high thread-count or something but i'm betting that not even the best Egyptian cotton possesses those masking properties.

3: The film takes place almost entirely inside an residential complex in Marina Del Ray. (Was this location was used because it's the the director's home? Hmmmm...) Our characters retreat to this hellishly dull, cramped location AND THEN STAY THERE for pretty much the whole movie delivering flaccid, uninspiring cliches to each other. I wanted them all to die after just a few minutes but many of them survive for what feels like *much* too long.

4: Some characters are introduced simply so we can see what the aliens will do to our protagonists if they are caught- yes they will be hypnotized and then have their BRAAAAINS removed and kept for later. Yucky noises are likely.

5: There's one moment where our group looks like they might leave the apartment building in search of a less doomed location and maybe find the audience some adventure on the way, but our vain hopes are crushed like a digitally-generated Ferrari as we learn the block has a 40-foot tall biomechanoid guard prowling around outside. It's then you realize you'll be stuck in the stairwells and service areas of this miserable f-ing condo building with these loathsome cardboard characters for the rest of the movie.

6: Apparently if your topless, lighter than carbon-fiber Ferrari is violently stomped flat by a 40' biomech war machine with you in it you can expect to walk away with little more than mussed hair, but ONLY so that the thing can dispatch you in a more gruesome way seconds later in slo-mo. Stupid, stupid, stupid.

7: When you're finally captured and have your brain harvested remember to just focus on your family. Once you're implanted into a new biomechanoid body the righteous indignation you feel at being assimilated in this manner will give you the strength you require to fully recall your identity and launch a solo revolt from within the indestructible alien mothership. Oh G*d have mercy that's the final insult.

Jeezis, at least Independence Day had jokes.

If your brain has ALREADY been removed by aliens you might enjoy this sad, crippled excuse for a sci-fi flick. Otherwise it's comparable to paying 15 dollars to bang your own head against a wall for a couple of hours with some blue lighting on you and you might enjoy and benefit from the latter option more.",1318723200,2,3482,4.7611940298507465
4223335,4,B003Y5H5GU,"Skyline is a victim of a poor title to start with. Yes, it's yet another alien invasion. The cast has no big names and we have probably seen most of them somewhere, but there is nothing wrong with the acting. Other than that, there is a solid story line and plot. There is just enough use of special effects to move the action along and what is seen is very well done. I like productions like this that set up the frame for the story and then get it done without a lot of thrashing around with side plots. This story is laser focused on the aliens and what happens to the people without getting lost in excessive character development. Unfortunately, the story is not very original until the very end. Part of the plot is a hyper-active clone of the 1998 British TV mini-series Invasion:Earth that somehow starred Fred Ward.

The characters are so vapid and low that it's heartening when they are serially slurped up by the aliens.  Thankfully everyone eventually was consumed so they had to ""end"" it, if you can call the last scene an ending.  Sometimes special effects are enough to at least make for good escape, but the plot in this case is so awful that you will regret allowing the images into your memory.  If there is a subliminal message it is that the human race is so hopeless that the studio thinks people will pay to watch a movie that illustrates their hopelessness.  Don't enable them to insult you.  Something positive?  The poor actors did a good job trying to make something positive out of the hopeless screenplay.  Hope some of them catch a break next time!",1317686400,,875,4.6
4223337,3,B003Y5H5GU,"I'm giving it three stars for the effects and the general entertainment value. It was entertaining indeed... Until the last half hour or so. First of all, to all the snobs who say we ""American Idol watching idiots"" (quote/unquote) want everything spoonfed to us: come again? Anyone with half a brain can figure out what's going on in this movie without really trying (and it's pretty ridiculous, but OK, I suspended my disbelief). That's not why this movie was a downer.

Yes, it's interesting and refreshing to see an alien invasion through the eyes of regular people who aren't heroes... But who on earth wants to watch a movie about those people struggling, overcoming unimaginable dangers, fighting back, showing bravery and resilience of the human spirit, only to FAIL miserably in the end? This is one of the reasons people go to the movies: to escape reality! Yes, we need heroes, not because we're ""stupid"" but because, after seeing on the 10 o'clock news how scores of people got massacred someplace or how two dozen people died in a fire or how a little boy got strangled by a serial killer, the last thing we need is a depressing, hopeless, pointless movie like this.

The ending? Please, it was a joke. The movie seems to end at one point (making you think, ""well, that was sad""), fades to black... Then it comes back! You sit there thinking, ""all right, I like surprises like this! Let's see what happens now!"" Just as you get all hyped up, the movie ENDS. Just. Like. That. It's like watching Star Wars and having the movie end just as the Rebels get ready to attack the Death Star.

Look, I don't need everything explained to me, nor do I need a happy ending every time. But there must be something to be taken out of a sad ending. Look at the tragic ending in Twelve Monkeys, or Butterfly Effect, or The Green Mile... Granted, those aren't films about alien invasion, but who cares? Fiction is fiction.

The computer effects were very well done so there's really no complaint from that department; the storyline was the familiar alien invasion by a technologically superior force.

Most of the component elements of the story were pretty much of an ""off-the-shelf"" variety so there were few, if any surprises. The genre of this movie is a blend of sci-fi and horror with the horror part taking the lead most of the movie. Did I mention that there is no ending, the movie just picks a point and stops on a very downer note. I've seen other movies and books that did this and I must confess this approach is rather annoying to me.

The dialogue could have been more clever, and most importantly, there could have been a solid story line. But all that aside, the special effects were awesome!!! I can only imagine what the filmmakers could have done with a great script. Yes, Skyline isn't anything close to original. It rips off other movies like The Matrix, War Of The Worlds, Independence Day, Cloverfield, The Mist, and an episode of The Outer Limits whose title I can't remember right now.

I seriously applaud the filmmakers because they have obviously made the film that they wanted to make and they have done it on a relatively cheap budget (apparently the budget was somewhere between 10 and 20m). The film looks great in hi def and as for the special effects I will use the film GI Joe for reference: GI Joe cost $175 ,000 ,000 and the special effects in that film are so ugly that I was utterly distracted by them as early as 5 minutes into the flick. Skyline's effects were better than acceptable and at times - especially towards the ending - they were excellent.

4223444,2,B003Y5H5GU,"Considering the low budget (estimated 10 million US dollars) of the indie sci-fi action, the special effects of ""Skyline,"" directed by the Brothers Strause, are pretty impressive. But the movie feels long and drawn out, at times even boring. The ""no escape"" situation surrounding the main characters may remind us of some of the George A. Romero classics, but the thrill-free alien invasion movie fails to generate anything in the way of tension or suspense due to the weak story and lackluster performers.

The story of ""Skyline"" mostly takes place in and around a high-rise condominium in LA (a cost saving scheme for filmmakers), where characters including an artist Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson) witnesses the alien invasion. To stay alive, the humans have to hide from the invaders from outer space (and the strange blue-colored light showering from up above).

It must be admitted that independent filmmakers Greg and Colin Strause (""Aliens vs. Predator: Requiem"") have good ideas. Unlike the invaders from outer space in ""Independence Day"" (my favorite sci-fi action) for example, the aliens' purpose is not blowing up buildings. The setting may not be visually appealing with much less explosions, but provides a more plausible scenario for the alien invasion, which would be catastrophic to the human beings.

However, it hardly exciting to watch those one-dimensional (and some unlikable) characters running around in a condo, trying to escape from the clutches of the invaders while repeatedly making illogical decisions as if to prolong the running time. The opening flashback introducing the main characters and their background is just dull, though the jaw-dropping conclusion is certainly something you've never seen before.",1313884800,,1776,5.404332129963899
4223475,1,B003Y5H5GU,"*SPOILERS*

I am a fan of science fiction, and I especially like BAD science fiction, by which I mean movies like ""Plan 9"", which is a laugh riot (unintentionally) no matter how many times you see it. I did a little research on this movie after watching it, and discovered that the entire budget for physical production (live actors and the crew to film them) came to only $500,000, and the special effects budget was $20 million. That explains a lot.

So, the main reason I hate this movie is that it wasn't bad enough. The acting is awful, and the script is one of those where you'll be saying the next line before the actor does. But the special effects are impressive.

The ending, where the main character (Eric Balfour) and his girlfriend (Scottie Thompson) are being sucked up into the spaceship to have their brains removed, is really finger-down-the-throat time. As they fly up into the ship, they manage to embrace and kiss. It would have been all right if it ended there... but what happens in the ship after that is one of the most hilariously maudlin, oh-no-they-didn't scenes I've witnessed in any movie of whatever genre.

I'm very much a fan of Sci-Fi, but sadly, there's so much crap in the genre, I'm often disappointed.  Obviously, such was not the case here.  It was executed very well, and I thought that the acting was good.  For that reason, I'm not sure why apparently so many folks didn't like this movie.

Without giving any spoilers, essentially the premise is that the Aliens have come, and they are harvesting us.  An interesting twist is that they don't eat us... they use us as raw material ( or more specifically, a certain part of us ).  We follow the two main characters (as well as extras), a couple, through three days of the invasion.  I had seen at least one review complaining that it is never brought out why they want to use our material for their nefarious purposes... really?  It's pretty obvious.  It also had an interesting twist at the end, that I thought was very nice.  And, it's one of those that continues the ending a bit as quasi-stills into the credits.  I thought that also worked well.

Yes, there are some aspects that were a bit detracting from the movie.  I saw what one reviewer meant by saying the movie was something like Cloverfield meets Independence Day.  Certainly, it's not that simple, but I can see elements in the movie that sort of back that up.  For my part, though, the comparison is tenuous at best.  But, I will say that the aspect of the movie that was Cloverfield-esque, though somewhat disappointing, does not completely ruin the movie.  For my part, though, it would have been better if they had re-thought that aspect.

The bottom line for me is, it was definitely worth the rental.  I enjoyed it, and consider it to be one of the better Sci-Fi movies to have been released in the last several years ( in the Invasion Genre ).  I also thought the ending was good.  Yes, it does leave things up to you, but if you follow it through the credits, it leaves your imagination to wander a bit.  It's not satisfying in the sense that everything turns out just fine, or necessarily even that there is a lot of hope ( which may be why so many people didn't like it ), but it does work with the rest of the story.

4223517,4,B003Y5H5GU,"I read a LOT of hateful and negative reviews of this film before I finally got around to seeing it.  I don't understand why so many people had so many negative things to say about ""Skyline"".  It was a solid (though fairly standard) alien-invasion movie.

Sure, it contains some two-dimensional characters.  But pretty much EVERY movie like this does too.

I think this film was infinitely better than ""Independence Day"", a film I absolutely loathed.  As spiffy as ""Independence Day"" looked with its expensive and neat-o effects, it had an insultingly lame script and was filled with absolutely preposterous situations and one-dimensional characters.  ""Skyline"" is ""Citizen Kane"" compared to ""Independence Day"".

What brought Spielberg's ""War of the Worlds"" down was his over-emphasis on ""the family"".  Spielberg tends to be too heavy-handed on that sometimes.  It lessened the fun of ""War of the Worlds"" and it was one of the things that turned ""The Lost World: Jurassic Park"" into total crap.  In ""Skyline"", you have a certain amount of bickering between the characters and some genre tropes as well, but they aren't oversold.  The dosage isn't too heavy and doesn't derail the story's momentum like it did in those two Spielberg films.

As much as I wanted to like ""Independence Day"", when Will Smith's character hopped into one of the alien spacecraft to fly it up into the mothership the film went from stupid-fun to just stupid.  It was the point in the story when the filmmakers stopped taking the premise seriously (if they ever did).  At least in ""Skyline"" the filmmakers take the premise seriously -- the five or six characters we see are dealing with an unknown and unimaginable terror.  They cannot possibly make totally rational decisions in an unrational situation.  And I loved the conceit of them watching the activity in Marina del Ray through the telescope --- they only get to see bits and pieces of the social nightmare.

The last few minutes of the film left me scratching my head, for sure, but any logical ending to this kind of story would be downbeat and Hollywood typically stays away from those endings.  It's a sacrifice we viewers make at the altar of Hollywood commerce.

My only real complaint with the film was the opening titles sequence.  Visually it looked more in keeping with a TV movie than a feature film.  Can't quite articulate why, but it did.

""Skyline"" didn't deserve the awful reviews it got, and this is coming from a self-confessed movie snob who tends to look down his nose a bit at genre films.  I'd be interested to know exactly which alien-invasion films the people who hated ""Skyline"" actually DID like.  Chances are, they are the same mindless, dumbed-down garbage like ""Independence Day"" that I feel do a disservice to the genre and movies in general.",1311724800,2,2804,4.889830508474576

4223520,3,B003Y5H5GU,"Skyline (2011)  Tooo Funnyyyyy!!!!!! Not Scary....

The plot is simple enough: Some partiers in a hotel wake up to find Los Angeles under attack by various monsters and bright lights that hypnotize and levitate humans to the main ships, or sucked into the maws of two sizes of smaller creatures and scout-type crafts. The remaining humans are split as to whether to flee the hotel or hide out in it; either option is pretty worthless, as it turns out.

The military retaliates against the invaders and does some damage, but it appears that mankind is doomed. This also seems to be an underlying reason why so many critics are so upset: There appears to be no save-the-day allies on the aliens, unlike Independence Day, Battle: Los Angeles, War of the Worlds. The combat sequences are reasonably well-done and not cheap looking at all.

It's not a bad plot; action sci-fi movies almost always concentrate on a small group which is often cut off or a sole survivor. In fact, the only major flaw is the unexplained super-strength and eventual different-colored brain the main character gets which appear to set the stage for a sequel. This development comes out of nowhere with no explanation and is a serious discrepancy. There are indeed reasons why I give this movie only three stars.",1311465600,,1284,4.822727272727272
4223521,4,B003Y5H5GU,"LA has been invaded.  Some may cheer, and others may pout.

Skyline's story revolves around a small group of friends in a high-rise apartment who witness this invasion.  Balls of blue light strike all over the city of angels. When you stare at the light, your mind goes blank, lines of tattoo-like pigment start coursing through your skin, and you are driven to head into the light.  This process, by the way, is not recommended by humans as a process to reach Nirvana.

This is, in general, an ""escape the aliens"" movie.  However, as a sci-fi fan, what I really liked was just how ""alien"" the aliens were.  The technologies were baffling.  The psychologies of the aliens were unreadable. The use or need of the aliens for humans was unfathomable.

You can read into any of this as you wish.  Me?  I was envisioning nanotechnology, earlier visits to Earth and experiments on people, and the recognition of the aliens that the human brain was a spectacular, albeit underused, processing device.

I've enjoyed Eric Balfour in Haven and other appearances, but this movie was not his friend.

4223524,1,B003Y5H5GU,"It's difficult to make a sci-fi movie without treading on some clichs, and without using technology borrowed from other movies; there are more than a few alien invasion and robot takeover movies. As an audience, we've seen it all before, we like it, and we're happy to pay for some fresh material. Where a movie in this genre sets itself apart is in storytelling.

This movie feels like a poorly written sister movie to Battle Los Angeles, told from the perspective of civilians trapped in an apartment building. It's as if the producers heard about Battle Los Angeles, decided to make a competing movie, then rushed it to market so they could get their piece of the pie (this movie released 4 months before Battle Los Angeles). The two movies even begin with the same ""flash forward, flash back"" storytelling.

I don't care about these characters. They are vague, clichd, and most of them are jerks. There are no character arcs. The characters are little more than ""fresh meat.""

There is no buildup of tension in the storytelling, and there are no emotional arcs; just some distractions to prolong the movie while the plot treads towards the inevitable end.

There are a few good things I can say about the movie. The ""moths to a flame"" / ""anglerfish"" concept is unique. The movie is a tragedy, which is rare in the entertainment industry (humans do not prevail; there are no cute little pink bows on everything at the end). The movie is only 1 hour and 30 minutes long. Otherwise this movie is a poorly executed collection of bits from other sci-fi movies and video games. Even the ending is a ""hint of Stanley Kubrik"" rip-off: The main character's brain is possessed within an alien robot body, standing over his pregnant girlfriend with an expression of, ""Well, now I'm an alien robot. Wonder what that will do to my rap career.""

Many movies give everything up in previews. This movie gives us little more than what we get from the movie posters. If you must, then fast forward through the drama and focus on the special effects.

There are way too many holes in this film.  When a nuclear bomb is detonated on one of the spaceships, it does not vaporize.  It gets damaged, but somehow it proceeds to repair itself back to the original shape and form.

This was a really good film. infact I would easily list it as my fav out of the alien invasion films.

They have no way of knowing what is going on and no idea what is the best way to save themselves. This is a far more frighting concept then say Independance Day which takes its story from the point of view of politicians and the military. I Hated that film. Skyline is more similar to War Of The Worlds. But is far more frighting becouse the people whose story we are following have no place to run too. The whole feeling of the film is apocaliptic and you know while watcing the film, the human race will not survive this. I guess a lot of people cant handle this which is part of the reason for so many negative reviews. But the fact is more mature minded people know if something like this was to ever happen, this is prety much how it would go down, no last minute heroics would save the day like in crapfests like ID4. Other people seem to dislike the fact that no explanation is given to the reason for the invasion. well its an invasion people, which part of invasion do you not understand. what more reason do you need.

Military helicopters come in and insert squads of marines. Jarrod and Elaine go to the roof hoping to ride a helicopter to safety. Oliver and Candice still hide in the penthouse, but they are found. Candice accidentally exposes herself to the blue light and absorbed; Oliver sacrifices himself in an attempt to kill a machine, but does not succeed. The army is thrown off the roof by the aliens and one of the small machine / lifeforms attacks Jarrod and Elaine. Together, they kill it, but with Jarrod badly hurt, both are hopelessly trapped when the aliens have defeated the military and begin approaching them. Resigned to their fate, they look up into the blue light, embrace and are sucked up.

The ending - Animating the alien body, Jarrod seems to retain control, and comes to the aid of Elaine and their unborn child.

I'm not going to waste my time wading through many of them because it looks like they basically say the same things which I don't agree with.  I think this is one of those cases where certain people started saying bad things and other people who let those people do the thinking just followed in step and repeated it.  Hmmm--maybe it's the result of an alien invasion that zombified the people who left reviews.

In my opinion this is a pretty high quality film.  Visually it's spectacular with sweeping city views of L.A. and very fine special effects.  I had no problem at all with the acting--I wasn't distracted by any of it and found the characters believable.

The story concept is what grabbed me the most.  The story is fine.  There are indeed similarities to other invasion films of the genre, but, heck, what do you expect?  The thing that I think worked best was the tension created by the uncertainty of the situation and then the action of the characters trying to save themselves. My wife and I were riveted throughout the film.

I found the ending to be rather unique, thought-provoking, and definitely disturbing.  Maybe that's what colored the negative opinions of so many reviewers.  Okay, so this isn't the way you wanted the movie to end?  Well that's tough!  Maybe we Earthlings don't win every battle against the aliens.

For me, this was action packed science fiction at it's pulpy slimy best. I went into the movie expecting something really bad after hearing the bad reviews.  Instead I was surprised.  My wife and I both liked it and had a darn good time watching SKYLINE.",1308355200,,1665,4.705882352941177
4223645,4,B003Y5H5GU,"Perhaps I should be ashamed that I enjoyed watching this movie.  Perhaps it's because I went in with low expectations and had no idea in advance what the movie was about.  Perhaps I was just in the mood for some fluff?

This movie was panned by the critics, getting somewhere in the vicinity of 15% at Rotten Tomatoes, but I've seen far worse movies than Skyline.  If I had to describe it to someone, I'd tell them to imagine Independence Day without the feel good ending, and mix in some Cloverfield without the nauseating camera shaking.  That's Skyline in a nutshell.  No, Skyline didn't have interesting characters, and yes the plot was a little (a lot) derivative.  In fact, this movie doesn't have so much of a plot as it has a situation.  And yeah, I thought the ending was a bit silly.  So why the four star (actually 3.5 - why can't we do half stars here?) rating?

First, because the movie is shot completely from the perspective of people who have no idea what's going on, even through the end of the movie, Skyline successfully maintains its narrative tension.  The downside to the movie's myopic perspective is that even when the credits roll, the viewer doesn't have many answers because he/she can't place the events in a broader context.  The upside however is that even though the viewer doesn't really care about any of the throwaway characters, the film does still manage to retain its unsettling atmosphere all the way through the last reel.  While many monster movies like this suffer because they drop the ""What the heck is going on?"" atmosphere at about the halfway point in favor of an expansion of the narrative to include army leaders, the president of the US, news reporters and other unassociated characters, Skyline makes a wise decision and keeps its storyline narrowly focused.  Things never feel wholly in control, which makes the movie exciting despite some of the silliness that's going on.  It felt a lot more personal than most giant monster movies, which are usually content to just have some big creatures destroy a lot of famous buildings.  Cloverfield was written in this way as well, much to its credit.

Second, the special effects are really top notch - not surprising given who made the film.  I liked the creature designs as well, and the sense of scale was pretty convincing.  The sets could have used a bit more variety, but with all the explosions and destruction going on, the sets and costumes don't really make much of a difference.

The biggest disappointment to me was the ending, which I won't reveal.  It was admittedly kind of silly, but then again I'm watching this to see explosions and special effects so I guess what happens to the characters ultimately isn't that important.

Anyway, this isn't the best movie ever made by any stretch of the imagination, but I do think it was one of the better ""giant monster movies"" I've seen.  It's a solid B-movie experience, a nice popcorn flick that you're not going to remember in a year but which will provide you with a 100 minutes of entertainment today.  Certainly didn't deserve the horrible reviews it received.  Watch on a big screen with surround sound.  I wouldn't personally buy it, but there are far worse movies you could rent for an evening.

One final note: this movie was rated PG-13.  While there wasn't much overt gore or blood being splattered around, and no sexual content really to speak of, I'd still call this a ""hard PG-13"".  Particularly the scenes at the end of the movie (think heads being ripped off and brains being extracted) would likely be disturbing to kids younger than 10.  13 is probably the right cut-off, but I wouldn't push it too much younger than that unless you like the idea of consoling your little one(s) in the middle of the night.

the alien's looked great, teh space ships looked great, overal the SFX effects were  definatly a A+ worth.

And the fact that aliens that are so evolved need human brains to power all there equipment is a bit far fetched, what did they start with in the first place ?
Did the first brains grow on trees or something like that? since i cant imagine they had all that technolegy at the start they needed to get them from somewhere.

The acting was very poorly done with the victims cursing and fighting among there selfs.
Witch made the movie very boring.

It reminded me of the Video game (Left 4 death) in witch zombies take over the planet, there the survivers  had the same problems.
But atleast they did something instead of staying in 1 place the hole game, and got resqued in the end.
And not to forget teh  nice and funny 1 liners they had.

When the movie  suddenly ended with the the brains taking over the alien body when it was planted inside it, was abit to much to cliche to handle.

will be filmed in the same style then i definatly wil safe teh money to see someting else, or better yet put it in a blender that is probebly more interesting :).

Ho hum, this has all been done so many times before.  I saw this movie on DVD after I had already seen Battle: Los Angeles.  The two movies almost seemed to be telling different parts of the same story, both being alien invasions of Los Angeles.

There have been a great number of these sorts of movies lately.  ""Independance Day"" was the big blockbuster in 1996 that started this recent trend.

There was a hint of ""Cloverfield"" in this movie, with the tight camera focus on a small group of young and hip people trying to get away from an invading monster.  Cloverfield was much better though, mainly because I remember that I actually cared somewhat about the people and wished well for them and felt sad when some of them died.

In this movie, I just wanted all of the characters to die, they were so obnoxious, so typically ""LA beautiful people"" - self centered, impulsive, live for the day.  And no, most real LA people are not like that, I lived there once...

These people were just plain stupid, and they didn't even seem to like each other.

Make a break for it?  Great! Just drive out there in your open top Ferrari with the booming exhaust pipes!  That will surely hide your presence from any lurking monsters!

Hide inside the glass enclosed high rise apartment?  Better make sure your windows stay covered!

Run out to the roof top expecting to be rescued by helicopters?  Fools!  Don't you know by now what happens to helicopters in alien/monster invasion movies?

All in all, I was sort of rooting for the aliens in this one to finish them all off, except for Susan ""Scottie"" Thompson, who was really cute.

4223716,4,B003Y5H5GU,"*** KIND-OF spoilers included ***

Every possible angle on this movie has been covered by now.  It's not ""Independence Day"".  It's not ""District 9"".  In some ways it may be closer to the 50's versions of ""Invasion of the Body Snatchers"", and ""War of the Worlds"".

In reality, it's probably the most realistic setup for an Alien Invasion movie I have seen.  You start with a bunch of young, and somewhat (to very) immature young people, who are just getting started in real life.  An Alien Invasion has started, but they have no clue what is going on.  The buildup is quite realistic as they probe and learn, the hard way, what is really going on.  There are very few omniscient viewpoints.  You get an occasional gods-eye view of goings on.  But for the most part, you learn as the characters do, and you see what the characters see.

The characters are clueless, just like real people.  All they have is their experience, essentially none, their training, again essentially none, and the equipment they bring to the war, which is basically whatever they happen to have in their apartment and their luggage.  They have no idea what to do, which is realistic.  They do not even know how to decide what to do.

There is no Will Smith wisecracking his way through the invasion and whooping alien butt. There are no former spec-ops dudes trying to escape their dark pasts who just happen to experience the invasion.  And they do not have serious spec-ops hardware, including experimental anti-alien weaponry in the upper shelf of the closet.  There is no martial arts queen, or prince, who can kill the aliens with a well placed ""Five Point Palm Exploding Heart Technique"" adapted to alien physiology.

It's not the science fiction equivalent of ""The Lion in Winter"".  But, then again.  I've seen ""Independence Day"", and I've seen ""District 9"".  I enjoyed both mightily.  I really can't say that the acting  per se in ""Skyline"" was any better or any worse than either of those.  Nothing against Will Smith.  I have enjoyed his movies, but can you really call what he did in ""Independence Day"" acting? Well, maybe a little.  Now that I think of it, his acting in ""I-Robot"" was a great deal better.  And perhaps even better in Hancock... but the topic is not Will Smith.

Overall, I enjoyed every minute of ""Skyline"".  'Nuff said.",1305936000,,2324,4.694789081885856
4223717,1,B003Y5H5GU,"I knew going in this was going to be a bad movie based on the majority of reviews. I really wanted to see just HOW bad it really was. ....and..... When I looked at the disc it said it was only and hour and a half. I thought to myself ""piece of cake""... Sadly that was the most painful hour and a half I can remember in a long time. War of the Worlds. Independence Day. It's a blatant rip off of both movies. Both of them were leagues better than this. The only thing new this one brought to the table are strange blue LED lights that hypnotize people and turn them funny colors.
Otherwise...

The good? The FX were good...that's it.

The bad? Everything else. Story, acting, pacing,you name it. This film suffers from the same thing that plagued ""Cloverfield"". Mainly...a cast of 20 something's that wouldn't stop saying the word ""dude"". UUGH!!! I was glad when the monsters ate most of them. ""But duuuuude.....""......""GULP""....bye bye. :) Good riddance. When your audience hates the cast and roots for the monster you've pretty much made the worst mistake any filmmaker can make.

I honestly had a hard time making it all the way to the end of the movie. Very few films can bore and annoy me this much but in this regard ""Skyline"" is a triumph.

Tragic, that is the only area where the film is victorious. I've also come to have other problems with the whole ""aliens invading Earth to harvest us"" kind of movies. If these beings exist...they can travel light years in the blink of an eye. They're so much more technologically advanced than us and yet...they can't find a way to make food??? And the last time I checked the majority of us were fat (myself included)...why would they even want to eat us in the first place? When's the last time you ate a steak that was all fat and gristle and you enjoyed it? Chances are, you didn't. Poor aliens. If you want food, I suggest you skip humans and get a Big Mac, a Coke and some fries instead.

Well crafted drama, the core of any story, really doesn't play into their enjoyment. Bigger, faster, louder, more gruesome deaths, and a dose of playground politics to make them feel all grown up - is the formula for their versions of success. Cue James Cameron to the podium please.

Skyline isn't about that. What it is - equal parts intriguing and terrifying.

I enjoyed how the film played out: A couple of buds hanging out on a normal day, very quietly having that ordinary day end with the violent invasion by an alien species.

Said invaders are intent on our destruction and, as a horrifying byproduct, tearing  the brains out of our bodies, consuming the electrical energy/life force as food. Yikes! And perhaps even worse, some are selectively implanted into cybernetic bodies as new soldiers in their slave army. Yikes deux!

Scary fun!

The big knock that so many seem uncomfortable with is where this takes place - a high rise condominium. But I would argue this makes sense in the ""real world"". A great many people, who are unaware of what's occurring, and even shell-shocked that it is indeed happening, will often hunker down hoping that an official response will be forthcoming, possibly even a rescue or resolution. It's not an uncommon reaction seen in many actual disasters - residents who decide that staying is better than venturing out into the unknown, even if it's against their own best interests. Not just stubbornness or arrogance, but fear.

And the essence of that fear, showcasing the reality of average people in an unnatural situation, that rings true. Carefully avoiding the pitfalls of the all too familiar smartass characters that regularly populate such films; scripts that are nothing but one-liners and snarky comebacks.

I want to thank the Directors' Strause for choosing Eric Balfour for their lead. Been impressed with this young actor since the much missed '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/24/dp/B0044E9JU0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">24</a>' television series finished its run a few years back. This guy has all the raw talent for the next generation of action heroes. Seriously, he's tall, masculine, handsome, ripped muscles and possesses the rare ability to display both fearsome aggression and empathic caring. Have to admit at being slightly surprised he hasn't yet been 'discovered' by mainstream fans.

Finally, obviously ending the movie with such ambiguity will leave some dissatisfied, even angered. But I enjoyed it nonetheless. Hopefully 'Skyline' will generate enough income to justify a sequel. I know I'd queue up.",1305331200,,2792,5.339407744874715

4223755,3,B003Y5H5GU,"I had mixed feelings watching this due to all the bad reviews. However, I found myself with a free evening and streamed this to my TV. The quality of the SD stream was very good though it was only in stereo. I have Uverse with 3megs down and 1 meg up. The purchase and viewing though went flawlessly with no hiccups, stutters, pauses or issues.

As to the film.. It has some good visuals but I like my scifi with a little more meat on the bone. I prefer to know more about what is going on. This took me more as a teen horror/zombie movie with a alien theme. And really that's all this is.. Alien zombies come for our brains...The only thing missing was random shots of bare skin. They could have used the telescope in the room to carry the movie so much but didn't. It would have been nice to see shots of what was going on outside while the actors guessed at the aliens motive.

the effects were very good, excellent character animation of the aliens and ships. I'm not sure I liked that they were nearly industructable, but the twist was kind of cool when their ship regenerated. The ending was as other have said kind of a double edge let down. On the good side it was not your standard ending.. Hell, we lost.. aliens win.. everything is burning and being harvested. The bad side is that the last really good shots of the film were a half dozen near stills. It would have been much better to have added another 2 dozen of those shots storyboarding what was happening during their escape.

Overall I give it 3 out of 5 stars for my personal taste that this was a classic thin horror film than an alien invasion sci fi film. I'd watch Battle LA over this.",1305331200,2,1658,4.273885350318471

The gals are nice looking, and even the ""hero"" who starts out as someone who is just hateable, maybe because he just looks like a freak, transforms into into someone (something) sympathetic by the time he comes out though the other side of the blender. Yes, there are some scientific errors (maybe that was a new type of nuke that you can watch explode through the window?), but come on, this is a movie that some guys made while working on other movies (and probably billing gazillions of dollars to those other movies while goofing off making this one); they must have been laughing like crazy much of the time, not least at how cool the FX were coming out, and how dismally the story unfolds for the hapless characters(look no further than their AVP2 for an almost identical tone).

There's almost no story here at all, proving once again that you just can't make a decent movie based on special effects alone (and, in my opinion, Skyline's special effects really aren't all that great to begin with).  Some dude takes his girlfriend out to visit his now fabulously successful best bud in L.A., they throw a lame party in their penthouse apartment, and then alien ships swoop down during the night and start snatching people left and right.  First there's a blue light which seems to give anyone who sees it instant leprosy, then the body is sucked up into an alien ship.  Since that only yields so much excitement, some of the humongous aliens then come down to earth and start acting like King Kong on a rampage.  All this time, our cast of characters whine and fight among themselves over the best course of action - make a run for it or just stay where they are.  That's pretty much the entire story - except for a lame and less than conclusive ending that somehow manages to make a lousy movie even worse.

Did you know that a nuclear explosion won't even shatter windows less than a mile away?  Not only that, it's possible to view said explosion through a freakin' telescope and come away completely unharmed.  It has to be true because I saw it in Skyline.  Oh, the fun you'll have compiling dozens of ""fun facts"" like these from your Skyline viewing experience.  And don't miss the riveting scene where the pregnant lady asks someone to snuff out a cigarette because she's worried about second hand smoke affecting the baby.  Apparently, second hand smoke is more dangerous that gigantic aliens turning L.A. into their own private mosh pit right outside your window.

For the life of me, I can't see how anyone could possibly enjoy this disaster of a film.  The barely-developed characters seem to be taking part in a competition to see who can be the most annoying, making you root fervently for their deaths; there's virtually no storyline to be found; the special effects are much more about quantity than quality; and the ending makes you want to smash your fists against the wall for at least five minutes.

People are right when they say that this movie has great special effects- the special effects are amazing, and even pretty!!! But that script...

...THAT DAMN SCRIPT.

Excuse me for sounding vague in this review but it's been a long time since a movie left me feeling as cold as Skyline did.

I was able to tolerate the dumb character choices and inconsistencies. I was able to tolerate such stupid things like the woman getting angry about the photo of her boyfriend cheating on her when there's an alien attack.

But the dialogue is AWFUL. Seriously. I think I laughed at pretty much every line spoken in this movie. It's like they hired a fanfiction writer to write this movie. I can't remember the last time. time I've laughed so much at someone pinning someone else to the wall and yelling ""You're disgusting!!!""

And the ending. What the hell was that??? Despite the dumb dialog and inconsistencies this was a cheesy fun movie and then THAT comes?!?!?!?!?! Oh dear.

I'm actually really stumped. And lost for words. This movie is that bad. I would give a movie this disappointing one star, but it gets two for the fact that it had a lot of potential for the most part.

The only thing that seems to vary is perhaps the human victims (and most cases, just a particular group of people), and the age group of the human victims arguing and fighting with each other (sometimes over inconsequential issues about their relationship with each other) while all the while, trying to stay alive.

Here you have what is again, another movie when doomsday is eminent, but yet some girl wants to be all jealous over another girl in the room making herself unintentionally appealing to her boyfriend.  The girl seems to be more concerned about her threatened relationship with her boyfriend, than she is about the big gross alien outside knocking on the door. That's so ridiculous!

And the typical cliches are here in this movie too.  While running from the alien less than 100 feet away, they are waiting for an elevator door to open, or the car won't start, or the cigarette lighter won't work, or insignificant people get picked up and consumed by the alien rather quickly while the more important cast actors seem to get stuck under the hungry alien fighting upward and yet they manage to free themselves from the alien and never so much as break a fingernail.

An alien invasion descends on Los Angeles and starts zapping everyone. Our intrepid heroes hide out in an apartment building as the hydra-like alien robot-thing icky bugs hunt them down. Ignoring any physics/plot holes, I had a great time right until the end. I hate it when the heroes die, or in this case, get assimilated/partially eaten by the icky bugs.

I have never seen a more pitiful excuse for a movie. It's the standard invasion movie you know like ""War of the Worlds"" without the pathos. Even Stephen King would barf. As you know even a Stephen King formula is to keep it almost believable, not inconceivable. A better duffus film like this would be ""Independence Day"" (1996) with a better actor Bill Pullman.

I suggest you do not waste your time with this ridicules thing and if you must watch something that has aliens walking the streets and peaking in windows watch Target Earth (1954).

This movie is a near total rip-off of Steven Speilberg's remake of ""War of the Worlds.""  The writing is incredibly bad, especially when characters are actually speaking to one another (as opposed to screaming or grunting).

I was especially offended by a brief scene where party goers use a telescope to spy on other condo tenants.  See, they have a camera hooked up to their telescope so they can watch their peepshow on a big screen TV.  Anyway, they spot a male neighbor who appears to be receiving sexual gratification.  Well, surprise!  It turns out that he's with another guy.  The film's editor then goes out of the way to show multiple looks of disgust on the faces of the crowd.

So, this is a PG-13 film, but I wonder if it would have been if the gay men were here for more than a fast, cheap laugh that has absolutely NOTHING to do with the rest of the film.

""Skyline"" was written (and I use the word very loosely) by Joshua Cordes & Liam O'Donnell.  And I'd like to thank them because there was a very real danger that I might have made it through my day without remembering to despise myself.

Best advice I could give you is to somehow track the movie and stop it 5 minutes before it ends.  Stop it right there, and the movie is actually fairly decent.  But the last 5 minutes turns a fairly decent film into stir-fried dog crap movie that pisses you off completely.

4223880,2,B003Y5H5GU,"The best I can say about this movie is that the sound, action, and special effects were WONDERFUL!! Oh, and there were a few parts that almost made me jump out of my seat.  But, honestly, I really wish I could just have those three hours back.

The film opened up with what I thought was the best opening ever.  Right from the beginning the aliens attack and I'm thinking, ""This is awesome, right into the action!"" and then, boom!  Fade-to-black and then flashback.  ARGH!!!  I should have known!  Please, Hollywood, don't flash back.  Start at the beginning of the story and don't get my hopes so high and leave such cheap tricks to the television shows.

The problem from there is that things just got so unrealistic.  For instance, (**WARNING: small spoilers, nothing plot specific**) there is a scene were the main character is taking some pictures.  He's standing there, no tripod, bouncing all over the place just hitting the shutter button.  When they review the pictures later they come out beautifully.  The color is perfect, there is no blur despite taking pictures of things from miles away, and the focus is spot on.  Then they turn on the TV and all they show is an empty studio.  Several empty studios.  Right.  There was NOBODY in all of America commenting on the events at hand.  Some of the action shots are near-misses just leave you flabbergasted and annoyed.  Something akin to ""they hit everything except that one small spot that would have ended the movie.""

And then you reach the jarring ending.  Setup for a sequel?  Oh, I hope not.  Please don't make another one of these.  Start there story where it beings, end it when the story stops.

Oh, I did like the actors.  As a computer geek I've always like Eric Balfour who basically played me on 24 (though he shows off a whole lot more muscle here).  Donald Faison is very comfortable in front of the camera and he cracks me up on Scrubs.  It was even nice to see David Zayas, who masterfully plays Batista on Dexter, though he plays the exact same person in this movie.

Anyways, if you are into special effects and stuff blowing up, get this movie.  If you are into plot and story, avoid this like the plague.",1303344000,,2185,4.556701030927835
4223881,2,B003Y5H5GU,"I thought this movie had potental to be a great sci fi movie. It had awesome visual affects, creepy looking aliens and characters that....ok forget about the characters. Lets get to the story.

A young couple arrive in LA to visit their friends when all hell breaks loose. The next day aliens invade and draw humans to them using this bright blue light. They stake out in the appartment waiting for help.

Ok one of the major problems with the movie was....not enough aliens...well not until the last 20 or so minutes we get some really cool action. For some reason, the producers felt we should see the human experience of all this. So basically instead of a sci fi horror...it becomes more of a survival horror. Trying not to be taken while watching all of the action from a windown.

The whole reason why the aliens were invading reminded me of those chessey 1950s sci fi B film, that no one remembers. I won't get into detail but if you see it, you'll know what I mean.

The driving force of one of the main characters was so unessary. You learn of it from the begining. Then we don't hear about it again until much later in the movie. Then never again.

Another big problem was....THE ENDING...It just ends out of no where. Just when the plot gets very interesting...it ends. I doubt there will be a sequel since this movie was panned by practically every single person who saw this...critics included. So we will never know what happens afterwards.

Overall despite the potental this movie had, it was all in all a bad...I mean bad sci fi movie.

SKIP!

Pros:
-The special affects
-Creeping looking aliens

Cons:
-The ending
-How can they make this into a survival horror
-Not enough aliens until near the end of the movie.
-Main focus reminds me a B movie from the 50s

4223929,4,B003Y5H5GU,"I saw this movie referenced in a review of Battle: Los Angeles, and then looked it up. I had seen no previews or heard any other reviews. I was basically going into it blind other than a quick plot synopsis and the idea that it was some kind of alien/disaster movie. Admittedly this is my sort of thing, I am a sci-fi fan, the more creepy aliens the better. 10 minutes into the movie I was about to turn it off. The too good looking cast, hip unlikely rich carachters and score that went from one too trendy song blindly into the next had me feeling like maybe I was watching Jersey Shore ( which I have never seen, just a guess). However, being too lazy to get up from bed I let it roll. What I got was a reasonably good take on the genre. Yes the acting wasn't particularly great, and the dialogue wasn't genious. However the tempo of the movie was right. The plot unfolded at the right pace. We lost and gained characters in a way that kept it interesting. As another reviewer mentioned, with no outside information we were kept in the dark with our characters in an interesting way. The special effects were a real surprise too. With the low quality acting I was counting on low quality CG aliens that looked like they could have been done on a home PC. However, all of the visual effects were top notch. There were some stunning images of landscape as well as creative and frightening monsters. There is plenty of intense action and thrilling sequences to keep the movie going. The ending struck me as a bit of a stretch, but again, kudos for them for not wrapping it up with some similarly unlikely happy hollywood ending. All in all, if you are after this sort of movie then it delivers it well. If you want classic dialogue and top notch acting, watch ""Hamlet"" or ""Like Water for Chocolate"" or ""Beaches"" or some other sissy crap.",1303084800,,1837,4.390029325513196

Skyline is NOT a bad movie. I not sure why the reviews for it are so mixed. My only complaint . . . how the end of the movie was done. I think they could have easily added 10-15 minutes of additional footage to wrap the the story up a bit better. Other than that, this is a very traditional 'alien invasion' story. Predictable? Maybe.

One of the things that may annoy some viewers, but I found  effective, is the constant state and mood of confusion.  Suspense between action scenes isn't built from dark shots and mood music.  It was done by feelings of despair and confusion among the characters.  They don't know what is going on.  They don't know if it is over.  They are afraid they might be dead no matter what they do.  The ending, meh.  It might not have been in line with the rest of the movie, but it didn't make the entire movie unwatchable as other reviewers have suggested.

At the end of watching this movie on dvd, I was initially disappointed with it, but as my mind slowly digested and analyzed it, I realized that it was a brilliant movie. After the celebration of a birthday party came a struggle for human life. The characters are harshly thrown off balance with a new world that they are presented. The blue light projected by the aliens allowed the attack to be indirect, and kept the characters in suspense from what was really going to be a day of hell.  As one main character and all the other humans are pulled like a moth to light to the aliens' collectors ships, the birthday boy saved his best friend from being another victim of the light. Some of the main characters realized that something weird was going on. Two characters decided to go out side on the rooftop to discover heavily armed military personnel. As they looked around and discovered large thunderous black cloud, and blue spheres of light suddenly falling from the sky straight down to the ground, they realized that they should have stayed in the building as the spheres levitated all the people close to the blue light of the spheres, and the thunderous black clouds opened up to reveal multiple alien spaceships. The alien spaceships released blue sentinel ships which flew directly at the rooftop occupants to collect them. The characters barely escaped with their lives after being saved by the main character's girlfriend. A large alien monkey walker beast thwarted the characters' attempt to escape in vehicles. As the aliens absorbed character after characters, the remaining characters found themselves in a desperate situation. As the character's hope was fading, the U.S. Military unleashed a brutal nuclear attack with a lucky unmanned stealth aircraft which barely penetrated through to through to one of the larger mother ships. The Atomic weapon slammed into the mother-ship with the typical loud, super-bright flash of light(no blast rings! How strange?). The force of the impact of the weapon sent the mother ship crashing to the earth in a scorched ball of flames, and the main characters began to celebrate. The military finally defeated the aliens, and saved the world. The End! Not, minutes later the surviving aliens on the scorched ship rejuvenated it, and unleashed a counter attack against the military and defeated it. It absorbed all the humans. The end! The humans lost, and the aliens won. Yes, it is more to it at the end, but watched the movie. I have a final question. Why do the aliens collect humans, and instead of killing them out right.

That's fair. And I could have lived with that. But ""Skyline"" has one of the most poorly scripted story-lines, with some of the ABSOLUTE WORST ACTING that I have ever seen.

Huh? What? No shock? No horror? No frantic scrambling around and screaming as they realized that earth had been invaded by aliens, while trying to figure out how they were going to escape and survive?

And actually, the general incongruity between the film's title and its subject matter, should have told me that the writers hadn't put any effort at all into creating and formulating even a semblance of an intelligent plot.

As a writer and a creative person myself, I hate to trash anyone else's creative endeavors. But this was bad. The story was just dumb. Plain and simple. I actually got to the point where I began to count the stupid comments and the mindless actions of the actors as a way to entertain myself. And the fact that they kept speaking of getting to a boat in a harbor which had a dozen monstrous spaceships hovering over it, and using that boat to escape the city, while the aliens were vacuuming up everything in that vicinity, just really made no sense at all.

Considering that this movie was out and out stupid, and the aliens liked to eat brains, the writers should have named this movie ""BRAINLESS"".

But! It does have some really cool monsters and some decent special effects: which account for about ten minutes worth of the 90 minutes that the film runs.",1301961600,,2208,4.588832487309645
4224116,1,B003Y5H5GU,"Skyline was the worst movie seen in 2010.  The acting was average at best, and the directing and the F/X were good, but the writing was terrible.  A buddy and I went thinking it would be an average sci-fi/ action film and were both disappointed and wanted the two hours of our lives back.

The writers took the standard writing formula and it started out well:
Take a protagonist and give him the worst day of his life (having to choose between his dream job and his pregnant girlfriend on the day of an alien invasion).  Check.
The hero's attempts to escape or fight off the aliens left him in a worse situation than earlier.  Check.
The world's military is also powerless against the invaders.  Okay, so far, so good.

How can the hero prevail?  What to do?  Good question, and unfortunately one the writers couldn't answer either, so they ended the story.  SPOILER ALERT:  The entire planet is assimilated.  Roll credits.  END SPOILER ALERT.

My chief criticism is that no one really felt emotionally invested with the characters.  There was also no rhyme or reason to the plot - I get that we ""inferior life forms"" may not understand the motives behind aliens, but what was it about the protagonist that made him resistant to the aliens' assimilation techniques?  Why was the hero able to retain his will when the rest of the planet could not?

At the end of the day, there were no new concepts nor new solutions offered that were different than the many sci-fi movies of the past seventy years.  Skyline lacks the essence that made ""Alien,"" ""Bladerunner,"" and even ""Independence Day"" successful:  Characters that make an emotional connection with the audience and a plausible, well-crafted story.",1301961600,,1701,4.763698630136986
4224117,2,B003Y5H5GU,"SPOILERS FROM THE OUTSET...TRUST ME YOU'LL THANK ME LATER.

""Skyline"" reminded me of a big budget Sy-Fy original TV movie--lots of meaningless but impressive action and not much of a script. It's entertaining enough for what it is and you have to take the film for that--it's NOT trying to be anything original but, instead, trying to create a terrifying sense of life spiraling out of control. It's an example of style over substance of the experience being justification enough and on that level the film IS entertaining just not all that original.

Terry and Jarrod (Eric Balfour)friends who aspired to become world class rappers meet up in Marina Del Rey for Terry's birthday party at his cool pad. Jarrod brings his girlfriend Elaine with him. Terry has become a player while Jarrod struggles to stay afloat as a photographer. While celebrating with Terry's friends the invasion unfolds. They try to escape but take refuge back in Terry's place when it's clear they are trapped within the confines of the city.

Unfortunately for our heroes the aliens have this mysterious blue light that hynotizes humans and they then get sucked away and so does their brains.

The story behind-the-scenes is more interesting than the movie itself.

END OF SPOILERS:

Directed by Greg and Colin Strause (their visual effects production company worked on the visuals for ""Battle: Los Angeles"" strangely enough...)""Skyline"" got knocked in the press as a knock off of a film that hadn't even been released yet--""Battle: Los Angeles"". Both however are a knock off of ""War of the Worlds"" both the original film from the 50's as well as Spielberg's remake, throw in some ""District 9"" AND ""Independence Day"" (which was, itself, a rip-off of ""War of the Worlds"")as well as a half dozen other big and low budget science fiction flicks and we have ""Skyline"".

It's entertaining and diverting for what it is.

The script isn't all that well written although it does have a number of clever ideas in it. It's the execution that's lacking but the film manages to sometimes succeed often in spite of itself at being a visceral experience.

The Blu-ray looks spectacular but it's like looking at a bowl of specatuclar plastic fruit; the temptation to eat it is there but, well, there's nothing TO EAT but it sure looks good.

Extras include two commentary tracks featuring the directors and writers/producers of the film. We get deleted/extended/alternative scenes and some other minor special features.

MORE SPOILERS BELOW:

Although ""Skyline"" is impressive looking, it's the victory of style over substance. I have the feeling that those that saw ""Skyline"" were pulled in by that hypnotic blue light and then their brains were taken. It would explain so much.

Obviously the movie appealed to someone because there are plenty of four and five star reviews here. If you're one of the lucky few that loved the movie write a review.

4224152,1,B003Y5H5GU,"Quite simply put, Skyline was one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Let's start with the characters. The main character is an absolute cretin, who wants to run out on his gf the moment he finds out he got her pregnant. Yes. This is supposed to be the movie's hero. But going beyond that, the characters were 1 dimensional cliche's at best. I actually cheered a couple times when one of the supporting cast died.

Now the plot and story. I imagine the writing of this film must have been something like this: A bunch of board members say ""we need a new movie, let's do one about aliens invading."" The next three hours they pull everything that 'worked"" from every sci-fi film ever written, through all their ""suggestions"" on some poor writer's desk, and called it a day. Seriously - there was NO originality in this movie. Every single aspect of this movie was taken from another movie. Every line, every theme, every graphic - it's all unoriginal and regurgitated.

In short, don't see this movie. You're IQ will suffer and you'll never get that hour and a half back.",1301702400,,1069,4.5625
4224153,5,B003Y5H5GU,"I think this movie, and all movies generally, need to be viewed in their own context. So in the example of Skyline it is a science fiction movie which plays like a B movie reminiscent from the 50s of that genre. The difference is that 1950s B sci-fi movies had cheap special effects. The special effects are pretty top notch in this film and the story is suspenseful with an easy to follow and understandable plot. We don't know who these aliens are but we do learn why they are here.

The acting is up to standard for this type of film. Although there are no Academy award winning performances in this film the acting is authentic and believable for people under the type of emotional stress these characters are experiencing. The film centers around one apartment complex and when I had heard that I thought that would be a limiting experience. But it is not. It adds to the tension of the movie and gives the viewer a sense of claustrophobia.

The ending of the movie surely sets up a sequel and I hope there is one to this film. It is a fun mindless action oriented science fiction film from the alien invasion genre.",1301616000,6,1121,4.436893203883495
4224154,3,B003Y5H5GU,"After watching Skyline I felt more moved to review the negative reviewers than the movie.  It's a passable sci-fi action flick with barely adequate acting and undistinguished writing.  It also has excellent special effects, which makes the criticism on this count inexplicable.  Well, almost inexplicable.

My guess on the hostile reviews this movie has gotten is that a good many people are upset about the ending, and with some justification.  It's unforeseen, abrupt, and leaves too many threads dangling.  But that hardly makes this a one star movie.  My wife reacted just like the critics have, but I couldn't find a real reason why for the antagonism, from her or the critics.

The plot is simple enough: Some partiers in a hotel wake up to find Los Angeles under attack by various monsters and bright lights that hypnotize and levitate humans to the main ships, or sucked into the maws of two sizes of smaller creatures and scout-type crafts.  (The monsters appear to be mostly organic.)  The remaining humans are split as to whether to flee the hotel or hide out in it; either option is pretty worthless, as it turns out.

The military retaliates against the invaders and does some damage, but it appears that mankind is doomed.  This also seems to be an underlying reason why so many critics are so upset: There appears to be no save-the-day Achilles heel on the aliens, unlike Independence Day, Battle: Los Angeles, War of the Worlds, etc.  The combat sequences are reasonably well-done and not cheap looking at all.

It's not a bad plot; action sci-fi movies almost always concentrate on a small group which is often cut off or a sole survivor.  In fact, the only major flaw (possible spoiler here)is the unexplained super-strength and eventual different-colored brain the main character gets which appear to set the stage for a sequel.  This development comes out of nowhere with no explanation and is a serious discrepancy.  There are indeed reasons why I give this movie only three stars.

And although I enjoyed Battle: Los Angeles, I found that movie to be absurd even without having to dig deep into it.  Imagine aliens taking over earth's six and a half billion people by doing a painstaking, block by block, urban warfare routine.  Skyline is much more what one would expect in an alien invasion.  The aliens are creepier, smarter, and far more effective in Skyline.

Don't sweat the negative reviews.  Although they make valid points, in their wrath and disappointment at a non-Hollywood script they go too far in their remarks and scores.  Skyline hovers between the classics and the garbage, and is worth a view.",1301616000,8,2634,4.88063063063063
4224155,1,B003Y5H5GU,"So, what does scrap waste and recycling squid crabs have to do with Skyline you ask?  Well, they happen to be the main characters and even better at acting and doing their job than their human counterparts including script and storyline writers and director.

For example: How is it that the flying erector set scrap yards can fly through an atmosphere without burning up or move at some speed approaching, let's say, 180,00 miles per second through interstellar dust without also disintegrating requires a definitive fifth grade education that's beyond me.
And, how the flying squid-crabs move as if they're in a viscous medium such as water, but it's not, is also beyond my fifth grade education.

Why so picky? Well if the movie is based on stealing ideas from other C-scify movies at least they should get the good stuff and provide some educative fantasy so that I'm not hastening my evolutionary regression by an hour and a half.

I won't mention the heavy reliance upon cheap props, cheap sets, cheap laser effects, really cheap model airplanes and an ending that besides going nowhere seems more an after thought than a proper burial.",1301529600,2,1142,4.871134020618556

4224157,5,B003Y5H5GU,"Not sure if the movie is for everyone, but there is a bit of geek/cult appeal to this movie.  Expect your viewing experience to be that of a lower budget movie.  Having watched Battle of Los Angeles in the theatres I felt this was a much much better movie and really I don't see that many similarities with Skyline except for having taken place in Los Angeles.  What was really horrible about Battle LA was that the aliens were barely a bit more advance than us that there was a glimmer of hope that we can beat it.  You can see this in the background as the droids were giving military signals/hand gestures to the other aliens.  Kinda dumb.  Weapons were just a bit better etc.  Clearly Battle LA was made to be a port over to TV with seasons after seasons of figuring out if we'll ever beat them.

With Skyline, there's no doubt that we'd get our butts kicked.  There is a level of dislike to some of the characters.  I had my moments of man ""this guy is such a wussy"", but it's all part of the plan as there's character transformations taking place that will catch you off guard.

All in all, good entertainment is hard to come by and I'm hoping for a part Two to this movie as they took it well over the top in this movie towards the end.  I'm buying this movie and with enough cult following hoping for a part Two.",1301529600,3,1320,4.2151394422310755

I will admit that the trailers for this sorry excuse of a Sci-Fi movie entangled me to view it.

Beaches, exotic drinks with fruit and little umbrellas, local customs, disappearances, human trafficking, torture, sacrifices...and so much more to make you never want to leave. So how mundane and boring would a vacation in Los Angles with your movie mogul friend be?

The invasion in Skyline takes place just after Jarrod (Eric Balfour - Haven), and girlfriend Elaine (Scottie Thompson - NCIS) come to L.A. to visit Jarrod's boyhood friend, Terry (Donald Faison - Scrubs), and his girlfriend Candice (Brittany Daniel - It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia) and celebrate Terry's birthday. After the party winds down and everyone is asleep, the city of angels is woken up by mysterious blue lights and objects smashing into downtown. As associate Ray (Neil Hopkins - Lost) finds out, if you stare at the lights you become mesmerized, your skin begins to change, and then you disappear into thin air. If you look away in time you just go a bit crazy. But wait, it gets worse. When the ships arrive, our survivors see people being sucked, screaming, into the ships. Or maybe watching someone get stuffed into an opening in the alien's appendages is worse? How about when the aliens take the brain out of a person to replace the dead organ in one of the smaller aliens? Add in building manager, and fellow survivor, Oliver (David Zayas - Dexter), escape attempts, fighting back by survivors and the military, and some serious effects of looking into the light and not being sucked away.

Skyline is a good movie. A very, very good movie that portrays how people would probably act in an invasion, with none of the calm, cool heroics that takes place in most movies of this genre. We experience fear, panic, frustration, differences of opinions, and no clear leadership. But, with all this you also get some of the finest effects in Blu-ray.

When I first watched this film I made comparisons to some other weak, but visually appealing movies, even seeing a resemblance between the aliens in Independence Day and Skyline, down to the little guy in one of the creatures' heads. There is no time to develop characters, and no way for the aliens to make their intentions know, except through domination, and destruction. Then I realized the perceived realism of the situation. If an invasion were to happen like this one, the general population wouldn't know what is happening, or why. Tempers would flare from anger and fear, and fights over survival and power would erupt. Meanwhile the aliens will be kicking our butts till the cows come home. If there are any cows left, that is.
This flick draws you in emotionally, and has fantastic special effects, so don't pass this one up.",1301356800,8,3187,4.87985212569316

When the trailers for Skyline started coming out I thought, ""That looks cool!"", but the reviews were generally negative from both critics and moviegoers.  I generally buy DVDs of movies I want to see.  Since the reviews were so bad and I just got burnt with the ""The Last Airbender"" (one of the worst movies I have seen in a long time) I decided to rent Skyline instead of buying it, now I am sorry I did.  The movie was really good.  I won't go into a long review of the movie, there are plenty of those.  I watched in bed, a few times I found myself moving up to the edge of the bed during the action scenes.  I read several times that the movie has no plot, I call shenanigans!!!  The movie has a good, although not necessarily original, plot.  The movie leaves a lot of things unexplained, but to be honest, it makes more sense us to not to know the information, than for us to know it since it is aliens who do what invading aliens should do, they invade.  While I enjoyed ""Independence Day"" I always thought it was really stupid that even the world's smartest cable guy could write a computer virus that could cripple an alien armadas' computers, even for a few minutes.  Also that we could fly 20 year old crashed spaceship into their mothership without some alarm saying, ""Hey isn't that the ship we lost contact with 20 years ago, let's make sure the humans aren't using it now?""

To me, the problem with this movie is that some important movie elements---character development, storyline logic, realism, and the ending---are all lacking.  I don't think any particular one of those elements are especially terrible, it's just that none of them really work all that well here and all these sub par elements combined make this a sub par movie that had lots of unfulfilled potential.

Nevertheless, it kept me entertained, and I honestly don't think it's as bad as everyone else seems to think it is.  If you decide to watch it, my advice is don't set your expectations too high and don't take it too seriously, and you might enjoy it despite its flaws.

Weak script, weak acting, weakness in general. But, wonderful special effects, especially the blue light things, and the CGI monsters.

Highlight was the insanely annoying screaming woman getting jammed into a monster's giant slavering maw. Now that was true cinematic satisfaction! Too bad she had to be so irritating for five minutes to make it happen. The Brothers Strause clearly want to be the Wachowski Brothers in every way, yet lack the requisite talent and imagination. The monsters here are so much like the probes in The Matrix, they oughta be sued.

Skyline is a b-movie with A-1 special effects. If you like eye candy (I do), you'll find plenty of fun here. If you hate bad acting, stay far away. Extra star for a truly hilariously stupid yet satisfyingly non-Hollywood ending. When nobody is ""good"" (or at least can act well), it's nice to see everyone get turned into alien monsters.

Their careless self absorption usually manifests itself in two ways. They do something extremely stupid and get themselves and others killed, or they steal something that the group needs to survive and wander off and get killed. It used to be that they were portrayed , but today they are heroes.

this movie is a rip-off of other alien invasion movies and i don't want to spoil the ""great ending"" but come on ! really !?!?!?

i do have to say there were a couple good things: 1) graphics were amazing, especially all the people being brought up by the ""light."" seeing all them float in mid-air, helpless adds to the movie... a little bit

4224220,2,B003Y5H5GU,"I gotta say, I am a huge sci-fi fan and can get sucked in pretty easily, which says an awful lot about Skyline. I was waiting for the 1 hour and 23 minutes to pass so I could go do something, anything else. Let's start with what isn't too bad, the story. It's lacking, it has no depth and won't get any but it is what it is. You're stuck in a building while an alien, or whatever, race invades for whatever reasons they have. Ok I can go with that. I prefer to not be lead around by the nose being told they're here for water or salt or whatever. The effects aren't bad either, not ground breaking but not bad. The problems come with reality, even the little bit I'd expect from an invasion movie, never happening. We've got four story gorilla squids wandering around LA but the power grid stays on for two days. They loose water, but until, and I'm not sure it even went out then, we launch a nuke, they never loose power...in LA, the home of the rolling blackout. I could go on and on here, really, the whole let's go to the marina plan, the let's not plan, why the main characters girlfriend doesn't want to go to the marina, the almost complete lack of reasoning for any plan, sitting in a car with a four story gorilla squid behind you waiting for a gate to open instead of running, etc. etc. But the biggest disappointment is the acting. It's bad. The sad thing is I know, from Dexter, that David Zayas can act, pretty well really, so it's gotta be the directors. Bottom line, if you are like me and can't pass a sci-fi film up, watch it, but just don't expect much of anything. That said, at least in the end *SPOLIER* we don't beat the invaders... which are here for brains...which they need because that's how they live I guess...which were created to need brains by ? A very rare and difficult to find resource I would think but ok. Depending if the directors learned anything a Skyline 2 could be decent and has obviously been planned but I doubt it.

This is the first of about six ""Sci-fi"" movies coming down the pike. I would rate this movie about three and a half stars. The thing that bothers me about this kind of movie is the lack of ""dirty sticky dirt"". The overwhelming amount of dirt and devastation that would be caused by an atomic explosion. If you notice in this movie things are never dirty. Even the things that are dirty are ""clean dirty"". The acting is ""cheesy"" and situations (locations) are unreal. This is the first movie I have seen that have used Red Cameras. You can not hide a thing from these cameras. The special effects are so amazingly real that they make the real actors look dull and boring.

The movie begins and immediately there is questions about the aliens, the blue light virus, and characters at the party that just never get addressed. Then there is that awful ending. Unlike most movies that have a happy ending or at least a satifactory conclusion, Skyline seems to just stop with no real ending.

It seems that either there has to be a Part 2 to finish the story or there was alot of film cutting to shorten the movie.

The Skyline Blu-ray has a few extras but offers no additional answers about the aliens or the main chararacters.

The Blu-ray is bright and sharp with great CGI FX. It has an A movie audio/video quality that makes the movie much more enjoyable than any low budget B movie.

What you do see in Skyline is an awesome Alien Invasion. If you enjoyed sci-fi movies like Cloverfield (without camera shake), Independence Day (without the humor), and War of the Worlds (without an A list actor) you will enjoy the roller coaster ride that Skyline takes you on.",1300838400,5,1078,4.512820512820513

I really enjoyed this movie and believe me I have 100's of science fiction movies in my lifetime and this movie was more realistic than most.  There was no super American to save the day or not micro organisms to attach their immune systems.  The only reason I did not give this movie 5 stars is that I didn't care for the ending.

Some criticize the characters as being young and self centered.  Who else would be caught off guard and not have a clue of how to survive?

Someone stated that any living being that can travel to another galaxy and function would definately be more advanced than humans so what would make anyone think that we could win a war against such advanced technology??????

For those who harshly criticize this movie as being unoriginal you are obviously not well informed about movies in general. At least 80% of all movies especially the horror and science fiction movies are remakes of old American versions or foreign films.

INDEPENDENCE DAY was a take off of ""War of the Worlds"", INVASION was one remake of ""INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS"" even ""TWILIGHT"" is just an updated version of Dracula and the Wolfman.  The ""TIME MACHINE"" has been remade several times.  In the romantic comedy genre ""YOU'VE GOT MAIL"" was a remake of ""LITTLE SHOP AROUND THE CORNER.""

So you see there is finite number of scenarios that screen writers have to work with.  The older movies provide the foundation and the new writers must possess the skills to provide an amicable re-presentation.",1300838400,,1577,4.694545454545454
4224255,1,B003Y5H5GU,"One star probably is rather harsh, but a movie with any kind of budget certainly should have done better than this. The idea of an alien invasion is nothing new, and it has been done far better. In this incarnation, we are given a sad lot of characters who somehow survive the onslaught of invaders by partying all night and sleeping in as to avoid the bright lights that attract humans like bugs to the zapper (literally). They spend the rest of the movie trying to figure out how to get out of the apartment builing in which they are stranded. At the same time, our intrepid invaders, appearing as superintellingent reptilian creatures, can storm across the vastness of space but cannot figure out how to enter a building. Most of our time is spent with nonsensical conversation with caricatures rather than characters while watching what is happening in the city block that surrounds the apartment building. Therein lies a real issue. The world is being overtaken and we're stuck with a few people in an apartment. There is no real drama inside, and the ruckus outside never seems to rise to apocolyptic prportions. It just seems to be a nuisance.

I do give credit to some of the special effects, though War of the Worlds should sue for copyright infringement. I can't halp but think this would have been a more exciting picture had there been more tension or urgency. As it stands, this is arguably the dullest apocalypse on record.",1300838400,18,1437,4.7023809523809526

4224258,4,B003Y5H5GU,I think what's cool about this film is they literally shot it in their own apartment building with a handful of actors.  The major studios have shown us they can take 100 million+ and make a crappy action film.  The Strause brothers took 10 million and did it all themselves.  So it's not AVATAR (overrated much?).  It IS a great example of independent filmmaking taken to the extreme.  The digital tools to make blockbusters cheaply are becoming more and more available.  They made a fun alien flick for half of what Cameron Diaz usually gets paid.  Hollywood can keep making crappy remakes of movies that don't need to remade.

4224259,5,B003Y5H5GU,"So the aliens come to earth in search of brains.  I guess brains are good computer processors.  Just remove brain from human, and insert into special brain CPU Socket on alien and viola! the alien gets more memory capacity -- like replacing that old Core 2 Duo with a Quad core.

I guess it makes sense.  In 2011 humans number nearly 7 billion.  That's a fairly good bumper crop of human brains (kindof like a cornfield or wheatfield).  It's good timing for the aliens to show up and start a little harvesting process; particularly if they've been doing human abductions and experimentation for a while (which I assume they had to do in order to get the brain interface to work).  But I guess it doesn't make sense in so many ways either -- human brains are pretty delicate, why bother.  I'm sure super advanced aliens have figured out a better way.
.
It is clearly evident that the aliens have much better use for human BRAINs than our cast of characters who appear to be intellectually deficient -- which really makes me wonder why aliens would want the brains of our protagonists.  I couldn't get to like the main characters.  In fact, I kindof wanted them to get eaten....except for Faison and Zayas.

Donald Faison & David Zayas made this film.  They were about the only two characters that had any B R A I N S and that were likable.....although their roles were a bit stereotypical.  I was just waiting for the other characters to be picked off and I was comfortably rewarded when they were.

Decent Special effects but you can tell that it's a cheaply made movie.  A lot of the effects are very limited and short duration shots with the majority of the film shot in some high rise, bland, uber contemporary, minimalist condo complex.  The alien ship shots you can just tell were recycled sets from the Matrix and the movie Aliens.  The brain-reuse concept isn't new either - it was the premise behind Robocop.  But hey A for effort and A+ for sound effects even though the vast majority of humanity will hate this movie, not understand it, or both.  And yes there are plot holes that you could drive a freight train through like ""hey let's leave the building and head for the ocean because we haven't seen any bad nasty ships over the ocean""......UHM, there are no nasty ships over the ocean because all the humans that they came for are in the giant CITY!!!!  That's why the ships are over the city and not over the desert, mountains, oceans etc!  And yes, the aliens are going to be on the lookout for humans trying to escape.  But I guess there has to be a reason for Balfour to act the way he does.

Great Sound.  Seriously, if you have HD and a good sound system with a decent sub, this movie will rattle the floors and the special effects scenes are pretty if the rest is just so so.

Overall, a mess of a movie.  I won't kid you.  This could easily be a D- movie if it weren't for the good editing, great sound, special effects.

Is there a happy ending?  I'll let you watch the movie to figure it out but what do you think would happen if aliens came from outter space looking for our brains and all that stood between you and salvation was Balfour who is not sure if he wants to be a dad?  Just never ever understimate the indominable human spirit for life, liberty, the pursuit of happiness and yes L O V E. AND the fact that the Balfour brain is incapable of running the advanced programs that the aliens intended it for :-)

Definitely get the blu ray version, watch it at night in the 70"" LED, turn down the lights, and crank up the subwoofer!

If you're a fan of Lovecraft Mythos horror, you'll absolutely see virtue in this extravaganza of alien planetary assault. They have attacked, don't care one bit for humanity except as a resource, and are seeking something quite specific that their advanced nano-technology apparently has some difficulty manufacturing. That's the only reason they've arrived, and it's nasty.

None of the characters inspire particular affection, but that is just as well and doesn't detract from the fun. It's Los Angeles, after all.

They pretty much sat in an apartment the entire time while aliens destroyed everybody and everything. Their efforts to escape were lame, and they didn't really try very hard. The ending was when the movie finally got interesting and grabbed my attention, but then the credits rolled and I was left wondering why I spent $10 to see it. It seemed open for a sequel, but they really should have gotten to what happened at the end much quicker and continued the movie from there. They would have had a much more interesting movie.

But oh well sometimes that is a good deal 'cause it is almost like a private screening.  The special effects were amazing!!!!  The story was incomplete lacking Substance.  It was if they just couldn't give you any tid bits of info as to what was going on and why this was happening.  The lone building security guard that seemed to a little too much at times. Just a documentry like production about a bumbling guy and his g-friend from out of town visiting a friend in Cali who made it big.  But how did he make it, what did he do?  What was his friend going to do for him?  The questions kept going on in my mind.  Then there is the reality style twists of cheating on your g-friend, your g-frind being pregnant.  Then blam-o Alien invasion!  Once again I can't express how cool the CG was.  I think the movie would have been better if you could cut all the cg alien stuff out compile that and then watch it.  I would then give it 3 stars.  I think it would have been better if you saw what the military was doing about the invasion.  More like Independance Day.

Any civilization that is capable of Faster Then Light travel would undoubtly have the ability stop these pesky ape descended bipeds in their tracks with a minimal of fuss.

A young couple flies into LA for a friend's birthday party. There is a small amount of drama when the woman, Elaine, reveals that she is pregnant to her boy friend, Jarrod, who was asked to move to LA to assist his friend's company.

However their personal problems are rendered moot when techno-biological aliens invade, a mix-mash of H.R. Gigers Biomechanical style of art work and old fashion Lovecraftian type monsters.  These invaders only want one thing. Brains. And they will eat up every last human to get as many as they can.

""Skyline"" falters in really only one spot, the male lead. He's arrogant and not very bright. He thinks he can escape the alien invasion by making it out into open ocean. You got drones sweeping over the city and goliath tankers stomping around; all of whom are full capable of rebuilding themselves if heavily damage. The apartment manager knows what the score is.

I didn't like Alien movies where they come here and then guys like Will Smith would punch the alien in the head and knock him out in ""Independence Day""!! This kind of childish humor makes the movie lose all its power. Or other movies where humans are able to defend themselves from aliens, but birds save humans by defeating the aliens themselves in ""War Of The Worlds"". If aliens were checking on and studying humans all these years and decided to come and occupy their planet, they would be well prepared.

This movie was good because the aliens actually kicked our butts. Humans were no match to them, and they actually lost the war fair and square. The only thing I didn't like was that we never got to see the actual aliens. We saw their vehicles but not the aliens themselves.

4224479,5,B003Y5H5GU,"I don't know why so many people are writing bad reviews about this movie.  I saw the same movie and I thought it was very entertaining all the way through.  Wow, I was scared!

The special effects were great!  Fantastic. The special effects alone deserve 5-stars.

The main characters were basically just 5 people. I thought their acting was very good.  During the movie, the aliens were overhead -- the characters were scared and running for cover --- I was scared and trying to hide under my chair. I don't have any complaints about their acting.

The plot was this --- alien space ships were hovering above. They pointed their blue-light guns down at the ground. People looked at the light, fell into a trance and were sucked up and into the space ships.  The aliens sent out smaller, scout crafts to look for people that were hiding.  The scout crafts had tentacles just like in the War of the Worlds movie so they could stretch those tentacles around corners, grab people, and stuff their bodies inside the craft.

The military showed up but they were no match for the alien's technology. F-14s and Blackhawks were wiped out immediately.

During all of this, the space ships sucking up bodies, the military shooting at the hoovering alien mother ships, our cast of 5 people are looking out the windows of their Los Angeles high rise apartment, trying to figure out what to do.  The movie follows this group of people as they try to figure out what to do, where to go and if they are going to be rescued. Among the group is a couple; earlier in the movie, the girl had just told the guy that she's pregnant. So as the aliens pick off the cast members one by one, this pregnant couple quickly become the focus of the movie.

I was really hoping this couple would survive, however logic told me this would be impossible.  Here's how the movie ends.  (look away if you don't want to know)  The alien mothership shines the blue light down on the couple. They are sucked up, kissing as they float upwards and into the space ship. We see them inside the spaceship, laying amongst a pile of bodies.  Alien robots are grabbing the heads off of the lifeless bodies, one by one, and stuffing the brains into freshly manufactured alien robot bodies.  With each implanted human brain, the new alien robot would jump up and start working to stuff a human brain into the next robot body creating an army of alien robots. It looked like an alien robot manufacturing assembly line process. We see an alien robot grab the guy's head from our couple, throwing his body into a pool of water, and stuffing his brain into a new alien robot body. This new alien robot now with our guy's brain inside, jumps up and looks around.  He sees an alien robot grabbing for his girl friend. He intervenes and the movie closes with her realizing that this robot is her boyfriend and she says his name. [The End]

I would have preferred the movie end with our military shooting down the alien spacecraft and winning.  However, that seems highly unlikely because in reality, the aliens had the technology that was necessary to transverse space,time and gravity in order to come to Earth in the first place.  We do not have this technology.  The movie makes me wonder if something like this could be scheduled for December 21, 2012.  The Cassiopaeans speak of similar events in the transcripts from 1994 to 2002.  To see what I'm talking about google search The Cassiopaeans transcripts from 1994 to 2002.  The information was received by Laura Knight-Jadczyk from extraterrestrials through a ouija board.",1293926400,2,3574,4.633333333333334
4224519,1,B003Y5H5GU,"In the Cincinnati area, there is a chain of chilidog restaurants called SKYLINE Chili. In Ohio, and surrounding areas, these restaurants are something of a mecca; people travel for hours for just a taste of SKYLINE Chili.  However, my husband, a Texan, can't stand the stuff. He's not sure exactly what's in it (and the Internet tells us that perhaps chocolate, peanut butter, cinnamon, and nutmeg might be involved), but he knows what chili is supposed to taste like, and SKYLINE ain't it.

Similarly, the movie SKYLINE is supposed to be a science fiction thriller. Sadly, it ain't what it's supposed to be, either.

Summary of SKYLINE (the movie, not the chili): Insipid people (who do nothing to make you care about them) wake up to see aliens landing in LA, sucking humans into the air, and ripping their brains out to use in alien equipment. That's it.  Period.  Done.

As with the chili, the ingredients in SKYLINE are there for all to see in the final product, but divining them individually is a problem. At first, SKYLINE seems to be like the movie Cloverfield, with its immediacy of events. Then it's like a summer camp horror flick with everyone hiding in the cabin so Jason or Freddie won't get them.  Then it's a lot like War of the Worlds, in some places almost exactly like the original version. We also have scenes from Independence Day. Did I mention District 9? How about the Matrix? They're mushed up in there, too.

On top of that, I simply couldn't care about the any of the characters in SKYLINE; not even the pregnant one. I kinda cared about the cute little doggie, but I knew he was a gonner the moment I saw him, so I didn't get invested. My husband teared up when the F-22 got whacked, but he was already complaining that it shouldn't have been worrying about ground targets when we didn't have air superiority. He thinks that way. I just wanted it to blow up bad guys.  That is what is supposed to happen in movies like this:  the military blows up the bad alien monsters, and we all live happily ever after.  However, in SKYLINE, there is not a single ounce of happily, and definitely no ever after...

Which brings us to the ""ending"" of SKYLINE. Telling you about the ""ending"" would be bad form, so I wont't do it. But to put quotes around the word should give you a clue. First, it's bizarre and looks like they swerved from science fiction into comic book.  Thinking about it, the ""ending"" reminded me very much of District 9. Second, it's an ending only by virtue of the fact that the credits stared rolling. It doesn't end anything. In fact, it makes it pretty clear that there's more coming, but let us all hope it's not SKYLINE 2: The Baby.

SKYLINE isn't even a good B-movie monster flick.  I enjoyed movies like the The Blob, the original Invation of the Body Snatchers, The Day of the Triffids, and Plan 9 from Outerspace infinitely more than SKYLINE. Those are classics, to be enjoyed for the corny camp that they are.  SKYLINE feels more like the background to a movie that hasn't started yet.  Two hours of introduction that goes absolutely nowhere and generates absolutely no interest.

As the credits rolled, my husband harrumphed and said, ""The chili is better."" Coming from him, that is saying quite a lot.",1293926400,6,3252,4.587219343696027

You could say it was the whole movie like that. However I don't regret anymore that I watched it. It was nice to see another yet original and not bad budgeted movie.

4224522,3,B003Y5H5GU,"The movie ""Skyline"" has received reviews from both positive and negative extremes, as should be expected from the risks the director chooses to take.

Background: Jarrod (Eric Balfour) and Elaine (Scottie Thompson) fly from New York to visit an old friend, Terry (Donald Faison), for the birthday in Los Angeles. The party ends and the main casts wake up by the blue light piercing through the blinds of Terry's apartment. It happens to be coming from the alien's spaceships coming down to vacuum human for their purpose.

Casts: There are not many casts in the movie. Besides the main characters, there are Terry's colleague, the wife of Terry, photographer/Terry's affair, penthouse neighbour and his dog, apartment manager, and two more victims. The building has so many stories but only 3 others residing. Maybe this movie happens after the US subprime crisis. After the invasion on the first day, it seems the apartment manager is really doing his job - managing and controlling the situation, better and wiser than Jarrod himself, it seems. For such a big catastrophic end-of-the-world situation like this, Skyline seems to isolate the group while not many people around them are having troubles, just waiting to be vacuumed up the sky.

Story: Skyline seems to be trying too hard to deviate from the mainstream Alien invasion movies by making it spontaneous - no warning, no explanation, no immediate solutions, no hope, and ultimately no happy feel-good patriotic ending. This is more realistic. However, some shots are so unrealistic or illogical:
- when people are getting drawn by the blue light shining at them and their veins almost popping, the body will heal itself under 1-2 minutes after being rescued. This is so strange.
- one of the victim gets sucked by the alien, who is crashed by the driving manager. The victim is still alive and able to walk, only slimy. That alien must be able to accommodate 2-3 people, too inefficient.
- the ship is destroyed by the missile from stealth jet. It explodes and falls to the ground with fire everywhere. However, it reconstructs itself out of the ashes and remains. This is too impossible.
- the main goal of these aliens only concern humans, not a single animal (except one poor dog). Probably there is a human filter technology that vacuums only the human and some dust, no cars, no trees, nothing else gets sucked up.
- etc.

The list goes on a lot longer but one thing is sure - the special effects are amazing. They are realistic and looks so great. Therefore, if you want to see how today's advancement in visual effects in a sci-fi movie, regardless of unpolished scripts and some illogical parts, Skyline might serve you alright. It is truly a movie to watch when friends get together on a weekend and do not have anything else to do.",1293148800,,2802,4.83125

- independence day
- close encounters
- fire in the sky

I don't think it ended up in alot of theaters and it probably made less then half of what it cost. The ending seems up to debate but I really didn't have a problem with it and of course it was left open for a sequel. They might release a sequel straight to dvd in a few years but the speical effects probably won't be nearly as good as this.

4224525,4,B003Y5H5GU,"The Review:

Skyline is the new alien invasion disaster movie and it's been dinged pretty hard by some mainstream reviewers.  I saw it opening day and I think that it's actually one of the better alien invasion movies, emphasis on the word alien.  It's Independence Day done right.

Skyline is set in modern day LA and chronicles 3 days in the life of a small group trying to survive a close encounter of the worst kind.  Overnight a massive alien invasion force appears in the skies over LA and begin abducting Los Angelinos by the millions.  What's impressive about this movie beyond stellar special effects is that the aliens are actually alien as opposed to typical Hollywood aliens. You see, aliens are seldom very alien in pop culture.  Think about it.  Vulcans, Klingons, Kryptonians look a lot like us.  Ten fingers, ten toes, one mouth. That's awfully unlikely, right? The best alien movies like Alien, The Thing, have the most memorable, truly alien life forms.  Skyline's aliens fall into that category. They are relentless, powerful and genocidal.  And there is NO explanation of what they are, where they come from and why they are making mincemeat of humanity.  This, I think, is where the film takes its biggest risk that I feel paid off but likely alienated some audiences (pun intended).

But consider how ridiculous it would be to have an alien species explain its motivations to you in some contrived monologue or have some scientist decipher their intentions in a matter of hours or days.  Or even how we'd have any basis by which to surmise their motivations, language or technology.  Consider whether other species even have motivations.

SPOILER ALERT: The film also eschews the Hollywood ending somewhat because there isn't any deus ex machina to save the day.  Aliens capable of interstellar travel can almost certainly kick humanity's butt.  No contest.  There's no McGuffin a la Independence Day that let's us pull a Hail Mary at the end to save the day.  The movie ends abruptly and sets itself up for a sequel.  END SPOILER.

Aside from the abrubt ending, Skyline gets it right.  The aliens are frightening, the story well told and the parts well played.  If you like everything explained to you though, then this movie might be a little jarring, but keep in mind truly alien antogonists are unlikely to tell you their motivations or have easily exploitable weaknesses.

4224526,3,B003Y5H5GU,"I wasn't crazy about this movie. I was in between War of the Worlds and Independence Day and had one of the worst endings ever. I love the special effects, but it kinda sucked a little, but, I will still buy it.",1291766400,,211,4.0476190476190474
4224527,5,B003Y5H5GU,"Being a lover of sci fi Alien films, (not the star trek or stargate stuff) i really was psyched about seeing this release. It didn't surprise me that critics hated it and fans loved it that usually how it works with these types of films. Well i tend to steer towards listening to the fans. On Rotten Tomatoes, they gave it a super low 15% which i thought was really harsh, while the fans gave it a 77%, which was more reasonable. Sure the acting is bland and the story thin, as with most Alien films, what do you want them to have, a deep story like Shawshank Redemption? The special effects are top notch and the action is non stop from beginning to end, with some occasional emotion in between. I must add the acting isn't bad, its just they don't have much dialogue. I mean ""lets get out of here"", ""do you wanna stay and die?"", ""look out"" and ""holy S$%t what's happening?"" are all part of disaster and sci fi films today, when the world is about to end. I love movies like Deep Impact, Twister, War Of The Worlds and even 2012(which did poorly) but lets face it, none of them had the best acting(maybe Deep Impact) or the best story line, but that's what it's suppose to be. Entertainment. Also the music is awesome and really adds to the intensity of the action sequences.

So yes i think people are being very harsh on this film just because it's not some creative overwhelming hard to understand film like Inception, which i disliked anyways. Sometimes people just want good intense action packed eye candy. And thats what you find here. Also one thing that i noticed is something really plausible in this film, yeah imagine that. There is a scene where two of the main characters are stuck on top of the building because they let the door shut behind them, one has a gun. Well when they go to escape he tries shooting off the door handle, or at it so the door will open. Thank GOD, it didn't work the first time or second, and as they try to pry it open someone opens it from the inside. How many movies do you see someone shoot a door handle and BAM they open it or crush in the door!! So at least something in an unlikely film that is realistic. As i mentioned the acting, its cardboardish because of the dialogue, but they do show emotion, get scared, cry, worry and run. They don't just laugh or make jokes and say ""wow that was close"" or make cheesy one line comic anecdotes like in a movie such as Independence Day. There is nothing funny about the situation and they don't make it that way. So enjoy this film for what it is and quit complaining, its been a long time since a good Alien film has been release, and this one is the best in years. (My opinion, don't be so picky).

Btw-If you liked War Of The Worlds(emotion wise), Independence Day(special effects wise), and parts of the second Aliens(gruesome wise), you'll love this. Also the movie is pretty graphic for PG-13 for you squemish people out there.",1291680000,124,2925,4.375
4224528,5,B003Y5H5GU,"Despite the negative reviews I have read on this blog, I & my companions found this a solid little movie. From my observations, the thing most people want when going to this type of movie is for there to emerge a hero (however unlikely at the start)& for that person or group to find some magic way to save earth.

In this movie, the aliens win & even though there is some vestige of the original human left in one of the aliens, it may or may not be enough to withstand the totality of the alien invasion. The ending is very different & does make sense if you do not look at it from a standard perspective.

The action is somewhat claustrophobic as it takes place in one main building---but if this were a real attack, chances are that is exactly what would happen. If an alien life form is smart enough to devise a way to come to our planet bent on destruction, I doubt we (earth) has any way to counteract them or give them chase over an  entire city.

As for the acting...first of all ,even the so called better known names have very few original acting expressions--part of why people go to watch them is simply that they like them & these people are playing heroic parts....the way we would all like to see ourselves when faced with an alien invasion. I found the acting in this film believable---ordinary people caught in a surrealistic situation--panic, little logic, downright terror. That's how many would deal with this. Why do people always feel that bigger names would be so much better...they bring their own baggage to any movie--& without the right director & script --not in a good way.

The movie overall is a fun diversion for a snowy day.",1291680000,7,1658,4.458745874587459
4224569,1,B003Y5H5GU,"I read several reviews. Didn't look at the rushes, trailers, or videos, but read reviews from career film critics, musings from Internet pundits, and a few Tweets. Gathered the information, pondered seeing the movie, and decided against it.

And then my favorite go-see-a-movie-with friend suggested we have dinner and a movie. But what movie? He had seen the latest Harry Potter (""The Deathly Hallows: Pt. 1""), the latest Disney (Tangled""), the latest Dreamworks (""Megamind""), the latest Denzel (""Unstoppable""), and the latest Girl Who Kicked (""The Girl Who Kicked the Hornet's Nest"") offerings. Anyway, the only film of these current releases I cared to attend was Harry Potter #7 and he didn't want to ""sit through *that* again.""

We had previously discussed ""Skyline"" and decided Absolutely Not. No Way. Uh-Uh. So, we had a nice dinner... and ran to catch the last showing for the evening of ""Skyline"". Of course we did. Hope runs deep for the desperate.

You know how - if a movie is good - you can ignore that your bottom is getting numb from sitting in the same position for many minutes? Or perhaps you're shifting your weight quickly so as not miss anything?

While I squirmed and fidgeted like a worm in hot ashes, my movie-going pal fell asleep - and he never falls asleep at a movie. Never, ever.

Someone here mentioned that ""Skyline"" has no beginning, no center, and no end.

In all fairness, the movie actually does begin - with a group of Marina Del Mar high-rise residents and their guests celebrating some sort of success a few of them have acquired but no one (including us) seems very happy about it. I actually got the impression that everyone at the party disliked each other at least as much as I did.

Then rude bright blue lights rudely awaken our bleary-eyed partiers and loud things happen. Remote-controlled black-out Roman shades couldn't keep out the intrusive alien beams, so our heroes open the shades for more punishment.

Now we go into the center of the movie for more success-related ostentation: the star-studded entry of a beautiful getaway car... a Ferrari.

Does Ferrari escape from the monsters' evil grasp? I'll never tell. One doesn't give away the fate of a beloved character in a movie.

Then we have some shots of very tall buildings from the air. This is scary - if you're afraid of heights or suffer from vertigo. There are tentacles and flying and stomping things, too.

We are now headed towards the end. More loud and bright stuff happens during this time. People are collected. One of the major characters is expecting (Spoiler: not the Ferrari). All forms of happiness are denied, and ""Skyline"" ends.

I apologize. This has been a very shallow non-review. I will watch anything remotely Sci-Fi, Horror, or Catastrophic to the bitter end, but ""Skyline"" has been the occasion for me to never again doubt my gut feelings about a movie. I am so sorry.",1291248000,4,2900,4.812877263581489
4224570,4,B003Y5H5GU,"Skyline worked for me. It is action packed. The performance by David Zayas was good. Real good. If our planet were invaded by a civilization thousands of years more technologically advanced than our present level, there would be one scenario-survive as best you can when all is lost. Los Angeles is the setting/template for a global invasion of all major metro areas on Earth.

Skyline is an insight into the end of the world, up close and personal. Skyline is cool. Want a sequel. Signed up for the DVD release notification on amazon.com.

This alien technology may be just some kind of insect invasion from the stars that is basically invincible and immortal. The invasion force may be a combination of symbiotic life forms. The invasion force may be living machines that can not be destroyed no matter how severe the force against them perhaps even a hydrogen bomb detonated directly on a mother ship would not kill or destroy it even after complete annihilation because the invasion force can rebuild/regenerate itself like the WTC rising from the ashes within a few hours of it razing and being pristine like it never was mowed down.

Looking forward to the commentary to learn about the technology/insects. And am interested in the rapture concept. Did Earth's rural population survive? It would be more cost effective for the aliens to harvest populations from major urban areas than the country side. Cost considerations must be factors even with super civilizations.

Zayas, character was a take charge, leadership man. The dialogue was from the lips of a handful of desperate people looking at death. Tension. Desperation. Flight. Run. We are here. We are alive. OK boss, I'll bite, I am dying to hear your plan (to survive).

They could have had some discourse on the alien invasion force but alack there was none from our cast. Where do yo think these things came from?

They must be far beyond that of our Solar System. More at light years from Earth. We can't survive against this kind of force, man. They are immortal.

If they were in the confines of the Solar System our technology would have detected them by now. Jesus. We are all going to die.

The ending was baffling and incredulous. Call it dumb.

Am buying the DVD ASAP.

4224571,1,B003Y5H5GU,"Let's start with the good parts of this movie: the invasion of space monsters has some great effects, including evil electro-squid that don't quite reach the level of 'hackneyed'. And who doesn't think that LA could use a certain amount of devastation?

That's about it. The body-countdown, where the little band grows littler one horror at a time, hardly counts as a plot. And the reason for the alien invasion? Well, a viewer's suspension of disbelief requires a little help from the movie-makers, but we as viewers never get the help we need. If you can blot out all attempts to understand the action in any rational way, you might enjoy the mayhem and  the effects. I need a bit more, even in an action/effects flick. The worst thing, though, might be that hint of sequel-bait suggesting that there might be another on the way

4224572,1,B003Y5H5GU,"Skyline is easily one of the worst movies of the year, and it's an absolutely terrible film overall. This movie took one of the most entertaining subject matters - an alien invasion - and made it one of the most boring exercises in film-making I've seen in quite some time. I don't understand how a group of filmmakers could make something this bad and have it released into theaters as opposed to on television.  This is to science-fiction what MacGruber was to comedy.

There are no big name actors and it shows through the horrible acting displayed in one horrible scene after another. The movie starts with a pointless glimpse of the future before flashing back 15 hours and then quickly jumping back to where we began. There isn't a single memorable character, and I can only remember one character's name due to the abysmal yet comedic last scene. There is no character development and very little drama considering the fact that the world has started to be invaded by an all powerful galactic force. The aliens don't talk, are barely seen outside of their ships, and in the end, aren't explained at all. They have the depth of a bad video game villain, and only want one thing - brains. Basically if you look at the aliens odd blue light ""weapon"", your body is taken over and you are taken into the sky.

As I mentioned, the ending is so ridiculous that it's unintentionally one of the funniest scenes I've seen all year. It's so bad that it's worth renting when released on DVD just to fast-forward and see.  I would avoid this film though, because getting sucked into this is pure punishment.",1290211200,12,1601,4.626760563380282
4224573,3,B003Y5H5GU,"It wasn't that bad! Geeeez! Did you really go to the theater expecting to see an oscar winning alien invasion movie? I knew it was going to be super-campy going in but I was pleasently surprised to find that it was only slightly campy. In fact I thought it was a more realistic invasion than any invasion flick I've seen in a long time.

The only thing that I had a problem with was the hotel worker/owner/whatever. That dude was trippin. I was hoping he would get killed off quick. Or mabey die a really gruesome death. Sound cruel? Wait until you see that guy.

The ending was perfect! By that I mean the way the aliens' technology works and the way they ran their military campaign. Im glad it didn't end in the typical American way with the ""good guys"" comming out on top with little or no damage to themselves. It was brutal and unforgiving and that's the way I like it.",1290038400,3,875,4.329268292682927
4224574,1,B003Y5H5GU,"This movie started off very well. It had the right amount of action, suspense, and great special effects, but the ending was just borderline ridiculous. The movie itself was like a mix of Cloverfield, and War of the Worlds, but the ending was like a very cheesy 60's sci-fi ending. Jarrod and his wife, Elaine go to L.A. for his friend Terry's Birthday. Early the next morning, bright blue lights come from the sky and huge alien spaceships appear. If anybody looks directly into the light, they become entranced and burn their blood vessels. The aliens are stealing humans. Jarrod, Elaine, Terry and their friends try to survive. I would not recommend SKYLINE!!!",1289952000,,663,4.876106194690266
4224575,4,B003Y5H5GU,"Aliens descend on Los Angeles out of the blue, surround the young casts condo, and prepare to finish them off, then the movie switches to ""15 hours earlier"". What more import information could we possibly need to know, what the characters exchanged for birthday presents? The switch-up kind of made me want to leave the theater. Instead of wondering, who got what as a housewarming present, I was wondering if the theater would give out a refund 10 minutes into a movie. Guess I'm OK with skipping character development. Skyline picks up quick enough after the reset, I did like the movie. In other films, such as the recent District 9, character isn't really developed - the heroes character is revealed as he's exposed to greater and greater stress.

Some of the dialogue is a little bit off, but at least it's not safe, politically correct or predictable. At times the dialogue is off on purpose. When one of the characters says something like, ""we're OK now"" you just know something really bad is about to happen. It's almost a cue.

For some Skyline will conjure up images of 9/11. Other's have already taken parts of the movie as a metaphor for rampant consumerism. I felt the attack was a metaphor for the 'illegal alien' invasion of the present day. More specifically, I guess, a replay of the phenomenon of black guys sleeping with a lot (I assume) of white girls. Tragedy after tragedy befall our young heroes and in the end one of the young girls sums it all up by saying, ""I hate Los Angeles"". In no way is it funny.

There was some infighting among the groups of survivors, perhaps less than in some movies but I felt there was still a bit too much of it. The sympathetic adult our cast befriend has to keep telling one of the young men something like, ""Don't bury your head and hope this goes away"", ""It's real"". When the alien machines turn out to be powered by human brains the guy beside me at the theater cringed. He had a valid reaction. White people aren't That smart. The evidence isn't looking too good on that. Besides, brains don't really seem to be what they are after.

At times the movie switches into the mode of fantasy. Some of the American aircraft appear to be models we've never seen before and they have odd sizes and shapes (not sure I've ever rooted for American airplanes this much before). At other times the cast remain remarkably unaffected by the action on screen. It's not even just narrow escapes. Skyline is such an intense movie, and frightening, the fantasy element may help cut down on the tension. I wonder if the disjointed beginning also keeps the movie from being too frightening. When it's revealed we're sort of fighting ourselves it adds even more creepiness and perhaps provides some afterthoughts (of hopelessness) to the experience.

Do we ever actually see the aliens? Did they even bother to land on Earth, or just send army sucking probes here? Why didn't the aliens use robot brains instead of harvesting zombies. Are they tapping into some kind of unknown 'life force'. Is it a matter of invading on a budget? We'll never know unless there's a sequel. Maybe instead of Alien vs Predator, Cloverfield vs Skyline. Both movies are very similar, actually. Maybe both attacks come from the same intelligence. A sequel seems unlikely, though, this movie can be summed up with 'we lose'. The main thing going for Skyline (aside from the fear, action and horror) is the ending. The ending is atypical: bleak, realistic, frightening, with again just a touch of fantasy to ease it through.",1289779200,3,3541,4.686495176848875

I find that when critics who often say a movie is excellent, it turns out to be the most boring- over-talkative, over-long production of crap.  When in turn if they say the movie sucks, it usually turns out to be an interesting piece of cinema.  I for one can hardly wait to buy it.

It's like they advanced as a species, discovered committees . . . and immediately scrapped solar and / or nuclear powered AI for cheaper outsourced (organically grown!) processors.  I suspect one of the committee's aliens had an relative who owned a vacuum technology company that was about to crumble.
