7955708,3,B00005V118,"I was really eager to enjoy the telling of these tales in their native German language and made the assumption that they would be told in an animated ""cartoon"" form. Seems obvious...right? Wrong! This dvd is nothing more than a narration of the stories accompanied by still pictures. Yes, I said STILL pictures that only change about every 30 to 90 seconds. What a bore.

If what you want is to simply hear the stories read to you in German then you'll be thrilled. Otherwise just buy a copy of the book containing the original illustrations (which I think all do) and read it to yourself.",1400284800,,589,4.556603773584905
