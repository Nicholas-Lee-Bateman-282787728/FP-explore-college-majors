7951367,5,B00005QY95,"This rating is for the movie Sore Losers.

It may be the packaging that sells this DVD set, but the only movie worth watching on it is Sore Losers, and that movie has nothing to do with the front/back cover art.

While the Witchcraft movies sounded somewhat intriguing, with names like Witchcraft 10 and Witchcraft 11 I knew they'd be lame straight-to-video crap.  This description of Sore Losers on the back of the box is what sold me on this, and the movie is even better than the description!

""They wanted meat, so they ate the flower children!  Hot rod juvenile delinquents and amazons from outer space have come to Memphis to kill hippies!  As if it were drained directly from the big throbbing vein of super 60's sexploitation movies, Sore Losers is an acid flashback thrill ride!  Move over Quentin Tarantino, they don't make 'em like this anymore!""

I don't know what their beef is with hippies, but have no fear, only 1 ""hippie"" gets killed, and it's done in a humourously satirical way.  The main character has died in the past, and has been given a directive by aliens to come back to earth and kill 10 hippies.  He must kill exactly 10, no more and no less, and if he fails this, he will never get back to his current afterlife.  When the movie starts, he has already killed around 8, and so only has a couple left.  He enlists the help of an overweight and overbearing redhead (Kerine Elkins), who despite that description is actually an enjoyable and humourous character in the movie.  She's hoping to help him out by offering to kill her parents, who I suppose are aged hippies, but really just look and act like rednecks.  Naturally, he goes over his allotment of 10, and bad things start to happen.

I had never heard of any of the ""underground"" actors in this movie, who are apparently musicians in real life, but I will say that their acting is perfectly fine for a movie of this calibre.  If you are used to watching campy B (or worse) horror movies, you will have no problem with the acting and plot here.

This movie is a gem of a find, and I'm so glad I found this ""box set"" for $10 back in the early days of DVD in the late 90s. As another reviewer stated, this movie alone is worth more than the price of the box set!  Because this movie is so rare and unknown among horror fans, I classify this as a must-see.  If you are a fan of shlocky cult cinema, you will not be dissappointed!  This is not a slasher film at all.  It is a surreal cult classic along the lines of Repo Man and Doom Generation, although much less offensive than the latter.

I really wish there was a proper release of this movie that would do it justice.  Having a remastered version on Blu-Ray would be awesome (as if that even needed to be said).  I hear the version on the ""Hotter Than Hell"" box set is better quality than the single DVD version of this, but can't say for sure since I've only seen the box set version.

To the reviewer that stated that you can get all these movies on the 50-pack called ""Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares"", that is WRONG!  Sore Losers is not available on that.

Although I would consider this movie 4 stars, I'm rating it 5 to offset the losers who are disenchanted with the bad soft-porn on the rest of this box set.",1364083200,2,3248,4.3610648918469215
7951368,2,B00005QY95,"The seller was perfect, item arrived ahead of schedule in perfect condition, and I will buy from them again. However, the movies are NO BUGET films shot in somebody's house with their friends trying to be actors (Some of them are trying, some not), and all films are available in a 50 pack called ""Decrepit Crypt of Nightmares"". Do not buy this or any Pendulum product! Some will like them because thery are full of nudity & adult language.",1363824000,,440,4.582278481012659
7951369,4,B00005QY95,"The other three films (only two of which I was able to watch due there being a defect on the side of the last film) are poor exploitation films that may be more or less titilating to those who haven't seen the female anatomy before.  Their barebones plots have little in common with each other even those they're supposedly sequels in the same series.  Sore losers however, is an interesting idea that makes an interesting film.  It's not the best film in history, but it keeps the interest and is funny, entertaining, has great music etc.  It totally comes off as a modern entry in the Something Weird catalog on the good to better side. Jack Oblivian, Mike Maker, D'lana Tunnel, and David Friedman are in this film and if you caught the significance of these people (underground legends in their own right), I'm impressed.  If you do know them and haven't heard of this film, I'd be surprised. Ultimately, it doesn't fit together as a narrative story like a lot of lower budget films, however, it's always interesting and with better cinematography and writing than others in its genre and budget.  I suggest you get it in this package (if you can) because it apparently has a better transfer than the other release out there.  Just forget the other movies and enjoy it.  Besides, you have to have a dvd hack to play them anyway because they have different region codes.",1255392000,,1372,4.640495867768595
