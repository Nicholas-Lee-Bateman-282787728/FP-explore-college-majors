8195030,5,B0001EFTT2,just one funny movie I worked for the railroad for many years but I if I did some of the things which were done in the movies they would have buried me long ago.

8195033,5,B0001EFTT2,"In THE GENERAL, Buster Keaton portrays a loyal Southerner during the Civil War who is also engineer of the entitled steam locomotive. When Union soldiers make off with his beloved engine, Keaton pursues them in a second and eventually manages to steal the General back.

The plot is a set-up for two superb train chase sequences that climax with one's plunge into a river after a wooden bridge the train is crossing collapses. Re-creation of Civil War uniforms and equipage is remarkably accurate, the Tennessee and Georgia scenery (which is really rural Oregon) looks perfect. Keaton's effortless and amazing stunt abilities make this a most unforgettable film-- a classic in every sense of the word and a must-see for all!
