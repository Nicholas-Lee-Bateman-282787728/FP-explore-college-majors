8653599,5,B00JRKZNRE,My son liked Prehysteria! Since he was very young. Only that was when it & the other two Prehysteria! Movies were on VHS. He's tired of VHSES these days. He prefers DVDS better. Region 1 & All Region aka Region Free. We were about to get 1 or 2 copies of this $35.68 Prime. But he was shocked to see that they're gone. We were just trying to save enough to buy later. I hope there's more of these $35.68 Prime Prehysteria! 1 DVDS on the way.,1511222400,,441,4.080459770114943

8653601,5,B00JRKZNRE,"Finally! A DVD release of this full moon films, Charles Band classic!  While it is in full screen let me assure you image qaulity is great and I own a vhs print as well of Prehysteria so I did a comparison check.  I was a bit sketchy about ordering this thinking it may be a bootleg but its an official release,only released in Germany by Paragon Films.  With that being said it is a PAL DVD so if your like me in the United States be aware of that as it will not play in your DVD player. Your pc will play it just fine though,and ya just hdmi it to your HDTV or can just use software to convert to NTSC like I did.  Anyway if you grew up in the 90's and loved this one, here it is finally on DVD in nice qaulity",1453161600,2,712,3.856164383561644
