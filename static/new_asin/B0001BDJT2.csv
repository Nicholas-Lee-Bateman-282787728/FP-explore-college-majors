8009767,5,B0001BDJT2,"Four 1-1/2-hour episodes plus one disc of extras (featurettes and documentaries). Great color, and sound. This copy has optional subtitles where necessary. The actual show's total running time is approximately 6 hours. There are several different releases of Shogun available (VHS, DVD, Blue Ray), but their actual running times are seldom distinguished from the total length of all the featurettes, documentaries, and show combined. The total running time of the original series as it was broadcasted is stated as 547 minutes, but I believe that number includes approximately 3 hours of commercials added to stretch the show out to five 2-hour nights. I picked my copy of this video up about 10 years ago. It was fairly priced then. The prices currently listed here on Amazon (as of 8/20/2017) are grossly over-inflated, possibly because of the scarcity of this particular copy, and because all of the sellers are currently in Japan. I haven't seen any other copies or releases, so I can only compare it to what I remember of the original television release. This version (the 5-DVD box set), in my opinion, is as close to being in your living room in 1980 and watching it as it originally aired, but without the commercials.",1503187200,,1226,4.985365853658537
