8106892,5,B000E7AZD6,"This is a great DVD both for the quality of sound and video as for the great show (lot's of songs!!!). I think it is much better than the 'official' KR-Winos DVD from 1988. If you like the music of Keith Richards (and The Stones, and just rock & roll) just go ahead and buy this, I am sure that you will love it. Please do ENJOY and rock on!!!",1145750400,2,343,3.914285714285714
