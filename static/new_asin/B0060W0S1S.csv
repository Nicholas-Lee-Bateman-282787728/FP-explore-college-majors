8490707,5,B0060W0S1S,"This is an enjoyable hunting video. The hunters within the video are well-balanced, professional, and respectful. This is not a video filled with a bunch of blood thirsty killers. Rather, this video features a group of men who are harvesting animals in a human way, surrounded by beautiful country. The quality of the video is very good, and is edited in a way that makes for an enjoyable video. I would suggest it to anyone interested in hunting Alaskan game.",1507852800,,460,4.7625
