The VHS was in very good condition. I am very pleased with my purchase",1412380800,,199,3.8780487804878048
7879045,5,6304880189,These videos are very well done. They weave the story from the great book into the author's biography. The narration is the best part of the series.,1362355200,,148,4.518518518518518
7879046,4,6304880189,"I purchased this set to use within my department at school. It is appropriate viewing for older high school students. The narration by Donald Sutherland is excellent, and there is a good variety of critical interpretation. Each tape offers an overview of the book under discussion, critical commentary, reenactments, and movie clips. The only thing that would make this series better is if Discovery would sell the set at a reasonable price on DVD. I'd love to see another series with world lit, too.",1351728000,,500,4.964285714285714
7879047,5,6304880189,This series is wonderful! If anyone knows how I can get it on DVD please let me know. I watched this back in high school and it gave me a deeper appreciation for many of the books I read for school.  It would be great for anyone who enjoys the great books of our time or who teaches classes and wants students to get excited about the materials they read.,1343865600,,355,4.071428571428571
7879048,5,6304880189,"As rodney91 has (already) provided a solid overview of TLC's GREAT BOOKS series of programs and as several of the tapes included in this VHS 10 pack have (already) been reviewed on the individual tape's Amazon page, I'll circumscribe my comments to noting that:

1) the price of this 10 pack is often LESS than what some of the Marketplace Sellers are asking for just ONE of the individual/""stand alone"" tapes (at this moment, four sellers are asking for less than $20 for this set);

 2) there are private sellers offering ""burned"" dvd copies of this set and other GREAT BOOKS programs on various buy and sell websites, but one should be very wary about purchasing these dvds becuz dvds burned on one person's computer will not necessarily play well on someone else's (there's often the problem of ""rubber lips"" i.e. poor audio-video sync and ""skips"" in the playback), becuz many burned disks cannot be played well - if at all - on some dvd players (esp older models), becuz the transfer from VHS to dvd (before it is then burned on a computer) are often pretty poor (for ex, the master VHS tapes could be very ""worn"" or, when dubbed to dvd, the recording mode chosen may be ""SP"" or ""LP"" rather than ""HQ""), and becuz, unlike the case with Amazon purchases, one has little recourse when buying defective items from sellers on buy and sell websites (i.e. most don't give refunds).

Do yourself a favour and buy this great set here (assuming that the prices haven't gone sky high again).",1319587200,4,1485,4.656488549618321
7879049,5,6304880189,"Like the other programs from this entertaining and insightful series from The Learning Channel (TLC), GREAT BOOKS: THE SCARLET LETTER (1995) provides an excellent review of the book in question (including its plot, use of symbolism, etc), skilfully weaving together the opinions of various Nathaniel Hawthorne (b. 1804, d. 1864) scholars and admirers with clips from the 1926 (silent) film adaptation of the 1850 novel, scenes dramatized by TLC, and illustrations of many imp scenes from the book.  However, what is noteworthy about this program, written and produced by Eugenie Vink, is what ISN'T revealed.

Although, in illustrating the influences on the author's choice of subject matter, its themes, etc, the show explains a) that Hawthorne lived several years in the Transcendentalist community at Brook Farm, b) that among his colleagues there was Margaret Fuller, who wrote the first American womens feminist treatise, c) that ""women's emancipation"" had become a much talked about issue of that era, and d) that the author's great-great-grandfather John Hathorne (Hawthorne added the ""w"" to the family name)not only was a Puritan, but also a magistrate who conducted preliminary hearings of around 100 persons accused of witchcraft during the infamous Salem Witch Trials, the question as to why Hawthorne ended the novel in such an ""unsatisfying"" - if not peculiar - manner isn't adequetely answered, nor is it mentioned i) that John Hathorne's father, William - Hawthorne's great-great-great-grandfather and his first ancestor in America - was also a Salem magistrate and one that mercilessly persecuted Quakers who emigrated to that colony, nor ii) that, more importantly and interestingly, Hawthorne's maternal great-great-grandfather's siblings, brother Nicholas Manning and sisters Anstiss Manning and Margaret Palfray, had been charged in Salem with incest, with Nicholas fleeing into the woods to escape arrest and the sisters being found guilty at trial and made to wear signs bearing the word INCEST pinned to their caps.  Nevertheless, the program does, on the whole, a very good job with the material that IS covered, particularly the elucidation of Puritan life and beliefs (including the fact that, in setting such high standards for piety, Puritans were a guilt-ridden and repressed lot who sometimes displaced and externalized their guilt onto others, which goes a long way to explaining their quickness in accusing others of sin and their zealousness in their persecution of fellow citizens).

For the above reasons, I recommend that one seriously consider buying this VHS tape or, even better, to purchase the TLC GREAT BOOKS VHS 10 Pack, which includes this tape and is also sold here on Amazon, sometimes for even less than the price of one of the (single) tapes included in the set",1317600000,2,2809,5.334085778781039
7879050,5,6304880189,"This is a wonderful series for students, scholars, or those just curious about literature. Originally created for The Learning Channel during the 90s, each episode blends interviews from experts, reenactments and archival footage, along with Donald Sutherland's wonderful narration, to give the viewer an understanding, not just of what the book is about but of who wrote it and why. Unfortunately, the series has yet to be made available on DVD. It is also no longer possible to buy the complete series in it's original form. While box sets of key episodes can be found here and from other booksellers, the full catalogue of episodes is now in the domain of educators and can only be purchased from sites devoted to teaching aides. Although technically a version of the series, the viewer will find the episode have been edited and their runtime shorted from 50 minutes to 25. In it's initial run, the program received high marks and won several awards so hopefully, it will eventually emerge on DVD.",1315958400,8,1001,4.928994082840236
7879051,5,6304880189,"This series from TLC is a real winner...could never persevere through 'Moby Dick' in high school but the synopsis (even with the movie excerpts form old movies) really gave me a feel for the book. The scholars interviewed are understandable and give many ideas about the books I'm sure I would have missed. The one for Huck Finn is particularly good and does not shy away from addressing much of the controversy surrounding the book. All in all, a good series and well worth the money.",1309564800,4,485,4.651162790697675
7879052,5,6304880189,This film is fantastic! I have an old copy that was recorded from television and is about to die. I am so happy that I found this. A must-have for teachers of The Scarlet Letter.,1293926400,,178,4.114285714285714
