New Orleans is such an amazing town!

I have purchased about 10-12 of the various videos in this series (on DVD) directly from WYES.  Most are about $20 for either 30 or 60 minutes.  The production values improve significantly with later ones.  The one on Jews of New Orleans (made post-Katrina) is fantastic.  Most do NOT have ""The New Orleans That Was"" in their title.",1252281600,,646,5.057142857142857
