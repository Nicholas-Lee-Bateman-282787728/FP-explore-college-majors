Remember, pigs root up truffles from underground and will not even touch touch the stuff! Creepy and slow paced as the"" fungi grows"", but ick!  Next time you order steak you may find yourself saying "" Hold the mushrooms"". ""PLEASE""!",1479600000,,375,5.098360655737705

8716444,5,B00XPTBDZ4,"Bought this used.  Came without a case and in a plain white envelope with no padding.  The DVD was dirty so I cleaned it and watched it with no problem.  Scope format, mono sound and dubbed in English.  I would have liked to watch it in Japanese just for fun -- but its not on the disc.
For a 50+ year old movie, this was fun.  Special effects (for the time) are fine and the production values are good.  If you are a Toho fan, I would urge you to check it out.",1439078400,4,461,3.903225806451613
