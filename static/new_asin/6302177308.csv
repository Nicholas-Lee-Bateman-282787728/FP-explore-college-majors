7822161,5,6302177308,Free Ride is a pretty funny teenage versus the Mafia film. The fabulous  Mamie Van Doren is hilarious as  flashy blonde nurse Debbie Stockwell . Made in 1985 this still works as a good comedy. A B-film but keeps your attention. I have met Mamie in person and she is very nice to her fans. A living legend of the Golden Age of Hollywood. I also admire her for her stand on women's and gay rights.,1343433600,,395,4.184210526315789
7822162,4,6302177308,"This was actually the first movie I bought after the power came back on. And I have to say, it was $15 well spent. I happen to like some 80s comedies. Now onto the movie. Apologies for the rather short intro.

On the eve of his first day at Monroe Prep, Dan Garten (Played by Gary Hershberger) decides to try his luck one more time at a prestigious nightclub.  Failing to pique a most attractive woman's interest with all of his once-popular lines, he finally wins her attention after pretending to own a red sports car parked in the valet parking lot. When the mob realizes that their car as well as $250,000 which is stuffed under the driver's seat of the car have just disappeared off the lot, an outrageous pursuit begins.

Overall, this film was pretty funny and had some funny jokes such as the penis enlarger lotion gag. This movie has yet to receive an official DVD release, so if you can find a copy, I think you should get it.",1223683200,5,936,4.367816091954023
7822163,3,6302177308,"Movie not to be taken seriously, but if you watched movies from the 80's such as Porky's, Last American Virgin, Hardbodies, give this one a try.",1180656000,,144,4.576923076923077
7822164,3,6302177308,"Although campy and apparently filmed with a shoulder mounted vhs recorder, this movie does have a few laughs and some nice T & A shots. For those who enjoy ""private school for girls"" this is a step down yet watchable.",1135987200,,217,4.45
