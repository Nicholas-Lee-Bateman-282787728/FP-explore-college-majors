6030587,5,B00FRQ0L2O,This was a great series. Anyone who is interested with mediums and afterlife will enjoy this! I look forward to the next series.,1402185600,,128,4.608695652173913
6030588,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"All I can do is jump on the pile of viewers who love this series! Forget all of the UK crime dramas PBS likes to flog off on US audiences, PBS needs to pickup THIS series YESTERDAY!  Actually, they could probably use this to make some serious cash during pledge weeks, considering that Andrew Lincoln is currently starring one of the highest rated television series in the history of cable television'  I have it on good authority that his scenes in the final episode of the series (series 2) that were on his show reel were instrumental in his getting the job on WALKING DEAD.

You won't intend to binge watch the entire series all at once but good luck trying to turn off the TV and step away from it once you've started. Just to be safe, you might want to notify your job, family, friends, etc. that they might not see much of you for the next day or two.

You've been warned AND encouraged!",1401753600,13,894,4.335329341317365

6030590,5,B00FRQ0L2O,So I am a big Andrew Lincoln fan and found out about this show It looked awesome so I got it and oh my god this show did not let me down so creative so emotional and such a great new fresh story Lesley Sharp and Andrew Lincoln play off each other perfectly for one of the most creative and interesting shows I've ever seen people who love Andrew Lincoln in the walking dead or like shows like supernatural will love this show can't wait for Series Two,1400630400,,451,4.136363636363637
6030591,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"This is a awesome TV series. Picked it up on a whim, and was definitely not disappointed. The only down side is that the series wasn't long enough, lol. It is only 6 episodes long, but each one is great, I was absolutely hooked from episode one. The finale was incredible, you go from being creeped out, to almost in tears, to shocked in a matter of minutes. It was a incredible roller coaster ride. It was also cool to see Andrew Lincoln, pre walking dead, and he is in top form here, everything you come to expect from him in The Walking Dead, you will get from him here also. This is a must see series and I really hope they release the second season.",1400371200,,654,4.198412698412699

Lesley Sharp was brilliant in the Alison Monday character and who would have guessed Andrew Lincoln would be where he is today on the Walking Dead. Afterlife was a great series with so much heart and touching moments. I highly recommend it.
Now, when will season 2 be released? Please don't make me wait another almost 10 years.",1400284800,4,503,4.478260869565218

6030594,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"I was very late in catching up with this series, when it aired here in the UK, but when I did, I devoured it within days (it was impossible just to watch a single episode at a time). As well as being thoroughly creepy in places, the central characters were so well developed, beautifully conceived, scripted and performed, that I genuinely felt for them, and may have got a bit choked up at a few points throughout the series (I'm sure it was just something in my eye, m'lud). It's not just the central characters though, I should add, as all the characters felt real and sometimes their situations and fates were just heartbreakingly shown. I can't remember now why it took so long to getting round to viewing, but very glad I finally did.",1396483200,33,740,4.488888888888889

6030596,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"Afterlife is one of the best TV series I've ever watched.  Lesley Sharp is amazing and it's very interesting to watch a pre-Walking Dead Andrew Lincoln.
I've turned 2 friends on to this show and they both loved it.  I'm so grateful BBC decided to release this on Region 1 DVD.  Can't wait for the final season.",1385942400,31,310,4.4035087719298245
6030597,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"Every time I watch another film or show with Andrew Lincoln in it I am blown away by the range this actor has.  The show itself is stimulating and makes you think about what comes next in many ways.  The quality of the show is really extraordinary and the cast is perfect for their roles.  Andrew Lincoln brings an outstanding performance to a complex character and each episode you see the layers gently pealed back into the things that truly torment the character.  This is a unique program that plays in front of the viewer like a look into someone's soul.  Bravo to the writers, directors, cast and especially Andrew Lincoln!",1476144000,2,629,4.63063063063063

6030599,1,B00FRQ0L2O,"I can only think that the rave reviews some have given here, for this decidedly modest effort, can be because they were given free copies AND paid  to sing its praises.  I ordered series one and two on the strength of the views here and my interest in BBC TV-drama. Well, let me just say to like-minded people, If you don't like endless stares into each others faces by two of the most boring actors in serial television avoid this sleep-inducing turkey! The two central characters fight and make up, fight and make-up, and fight and makeup again so that with each fight usually over trivia, and each make up you know its opposite is just seconds away.  One or two episodes were good enough to keep me coming back. I suspect the producers were planning to make a future deadly duo of them,, but it seems they won't be coming back. There was soooo much irrelevant filler footage in this series, that I took to guessing what the characters would say next, they were so predictable.  (I was right about 85% of the time). Now, I don't need car chases every five minutes  or gore-fests of the type the kids seem to love but I can say that this is the only serioes of its kind in which I NEVER got a chill, or was ever surprised by an episode's ending- and I have yet to decided which character by whomr I was less moved , the dipsy medium or the handsome snore-inducing foil I will gladly turn these over to anyone who will send the postage costs - ONLY.

It is so sad that, unless you watch the BBC regularly, you have probably not heard of this show.  What's even sadder is that it only lasted two seasons.  It's a beautiful show that is heart-rending at times, moderately spooky, but in no way scary.  The relationship between Robert and Alison  is so riveting to watch, and the breakthrough for them both at the end is just amazing.  I really wish more shows of this nature were done.  If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.  I have to give a round of applause to Lesley Sharp and Andrew Lincoln both.  Just excellent!",1459987200,3,696,4.409448818897638

I had missed the first two episodes on public television and couldn't watch them on OnDemand so I purchased Eps. 1 & 2, then the 6th episode of season 1. From that point I just decided to purchase Season 2.  I felt Lesley Sharp and Andrew Lincoln's acting were brilliant.  I'm a fan of Andrew Lincoln from my favorite show, The Walking Dead, and this was a far different role he acted. He is a phenomenol actor indeed.

6030623,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"This is the British version of the TV show called Medium. For those who did not care for the gore of the TV show Medium, this has all the suspense and far fewer of those negative graphic images. Personally, even though I did enjoyed the American version, I felt that the dynamic between the Collage Professor and Allison in this series was far more intriguing than the family life dynamic portrayed in Medium. The first season of Afterlife is better than the first, as Allison's character starts to have a nervous breakdown in the second, which only serves to end the series all too quickly. Of course, both series do probe some interesting questions about psychic ability and are very artfully crafted.  If you enjoy a series that has a single-episode plot along with an overall series plot, this may be your cup of tea. The DVD cover seems to suggest that this is a horror series; however, I would say that it only dips into horror at times and would probably place this in the suspense/paranormal genres. If someone wants to classify this as horror, all I can tell you that it certainly is not the slasher type horror and most episodes probably won't give you nightmares.",1448668800,8,1174,4.644230769230769

One thing I found curious and odd. The woman has four locks on her front door but no peephole. In fact in one episode this results in her opening her door to a man she's accused of murder - and boy is he pissed and threatening. Jeez louweez!

I think this a great series with solid acting and intelligent story lines why can't more American shows be produced and as well written as most BBC series. I am not the kind of person who has had any paranormal experiences and maybe I'm just making things up cause of the drama of the series and getting into it but now it's just getting too coincidental with these odd things happening.

6030641,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"I grew up in a genuinely haunted house, and appreciate this fine series, set in the haunted seaside city of Bristol, U.K. I don't understand why ""Afterlife"" is not better known, considering the quality of the actors, stories, and care with the sets. In Series 1, we meet the tattered and battered by life Alison Mundy (Lesley Sharp), washed-up in Bristol. Sharp inhabits her role impeccably, with such depth and conviction that she makes even less credible stories more believable. With emotional and physical scars, Alison survived a horrific train crash, and sees apparitions of her fellow travelers. She must come to terms with her psychic sensitivity, living with one foot in this world, the other the cold side of the grave. When Alison walks the hilly streets of Bristol, she is often unsure if the people she sees are really alive, or if they are restless spirits. Alison's narrow town-home is an artifact, marking her oddness, out of step with time, stuck in a previous period; 1970's avocado green looms in patterned wallpaper that is beyond retro, its dank hideousness dominates; vinyl records are stacked on the floor; even her phone is old-fashioned.

Alison confronts professor Robert Bridge (Andrew Lincoln), a psychology lecturer grieving the loss of his young son Josh. Robert feels responsible for his son's death, since he was driving the car in the accident that killed Josh three years ago. His marriage subsequently collapsed, and his wife has moved on with her own life. Robert is a complete skeptic about psychic mediums like Alison, but she is no fraud. His interactions with Alison constantly challenge his assumptions, but she must face him, since his son is one of her perpetual haunts. Josh's lost spirit keeps trying to make contact with his unwilling father. Alison must also cope with the damage to her body and spirit from the train wreck, and face her fear of fellow survivors who, like her, carry a burden of grief and guilt. Phyllida Law adds depth as a woman widowed by the crash, who organizes a seance in a scary old house, enlisting Alison against Robert's advice, in the magnificent closure of Series 1, with ""The 7:59 Club."" The painful journeys of the train crash survivors ultimately defy gloom with transcendence. But the consequences are dire for Alison.

""Afterlife"" is rife with troubled, damaged souls, whose terrible, violent ends and unresolved issues haunt Alison. Some of these spirits even have deadly agendas towards the living. Overall, this is an interesting, experimental series that deserves a wider audience. Don't watch this by yourself if you are easily spooked...",1428883200,8,2625,5.032183908045977
6030642,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"I really enjoyed this series, although I have to say it was somewhat dark and depressing in my opinion - so beware - it is not light and uplipting.  I love Andrew Lincoln from the Walking Dead, and I knew he was British from seeing him in a previous interview, so I was curious to see what his acting was like prior to his now signature character ""Rick.""  I have concluded that he is a very talented actor who I enjoy watching.  But the real star here is Lesley Sharp, who plays the lead ""Allison.""

6030650,4,B00FRQ0L2O,"Unlike some shows that deal with spiritual hauntings, Afterlife is consistently character-driven.

Robert, a college professor, decides to help his students debunk local mediums. However, he is drawn to reluctant medium Alison, who tries to help one of his students deal with a ghost.

That ends badly and the professor decides to ""cure"" Alison of her delusions. It turns into a journey of his own grief and loss, some belief in the afterlife - and a creepy seance brilliantly executed by actress Leslie Sharp.

I devoured this season in a day. I couldn't help it. It was very addictive. It was... deeper, somehow, than shows like Ghost Whisperer. The stories weren't the normal hauntings. There were twists that you didn't always see coming. That was quite refreshing.

If you like shows about hauntings that aren't gory and have some heart, definitely check out Afterlife.",1423699200,,874,5.048611111111111

Then a young woman moves into a house (theirs? I don't know) and hears a ghost baby crying and then is terrified as she is tormented in her sleep waking up to ghosts moving things in her room and begs them to leave her alone. I then shut it off.

Each episode features an original ghost story and its effect upon the unlikely duo. The end of the second series is powerful and deeply moving.

6030674,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"One of the most captivating, well done series about this subject I've seen. The skepticism matched well with the possibility and need to believe. Is it fear or denial that confuses our lives? What happens to our belief systems if ""afterlife"" actually occurs? How bittersweet would it be if there was NO afterlife & it was all in vain? Watch the series, be entertained but, most of all, think about it.",1417219200,,401,4.661971830985915

6030677,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"GREAT British series with tremendous storyline, acting and a thoughtful  intelligent script.  I was drawn to the premise of a psychic/spiritualist and a skeptical psychologist working together.  i bought Season 1 and binge-watched it over 1 weekend.  I immediately purchased the 2nd - and final - season but held off a couple days before watching.  i wanted to mull over the first season before diving into season 2.  The two seasons are a complete story arc, all is resolved and, be assured, you are not left hanging with unanswered questions.  But, oh, how I wish there were more episodes, I would love to have journeyed further with the characters.  I'm glad that I purchased it, I know I'll enjoy watching it again (which is unusual for me).",1416441600,3,745,4.811023622047244
6030678,4,B00FRQ0L2O,"I like this show, but I don't understand why we only received the first show and would have to pay for each segment separately.  When family ordered it from another location, they received the entire first season!  That is my negative about the show's review and the purchasing experience.",1416441600,,289,4.877551020408164

6030693,5,B00FRQ0L2O,"I read about this series in a BBC DVD magazine and decided to order it when I saw Amazon had it.
I love Andrew Lincoln (The Walking Dead's Rick) and I was very curious about this series.  I am so
glad I ordered it now.  It is an excellent paranormal series.  His character (Professor Robert Bridge) tries to debunk the psychic's
gift of seeing ghosts (Allison Monday) and trying to help the ghosts/families find peace.  Allison now just needs to convince
Professor Bridge of the same thing as he needs to lay his own ghost to rest.  I have already seen 3 episodes and will
finish the final episodes tonight.  It is an addictive series.

Andrew Lincoln and Lesley Sharpe are excellent as Professor Bridge & Allison Monday.  I highly recommend the series
and I can hardly wait for Season 2 to come out this October.  I'm just sorry that there were only 2 seasons.",1410739200,5,861,4.503225806451613

6030699,5,B00FRQ0L2O,definitely different than that of horror films. a female that is haunted by the ability to see dead spirits attempts to set them at ease so they can move on and then she attempts to protect the living from the evil spirits that desire what the living has: LIFE. definitely a good series if there is more to come.,1403654400,,312,4.305084745762712

6030701,3,B00FRQ0L2O,"If you read the editorial review this is about a psychic who receives messages from dead
people who want them to convey something to the living.  A university psychologist
wants to study her and write a book about her.  He starts out believing all psychics
are frauds.  Another twist in the tale--he still blames himself for the death of his son
in an auto accident--which ended up destroying his first marriage.  Naturally, his son
is talking to the psychic (or medium or whatever you call her).

The acting was OK but the characters were a bit stereotyped and it wasn't quite as
good as I had hoped.  I think one season is enough for me.",1403395200,5,639,4.51304347826087
