8591293,4,B00DBGLEX2,"Written and directed by Byeong-gil Jeong (his feature debut), a Korena thriller ""Confession of Murder"" starts off with an unusual premise: a handsome and clean-cut man named Lee Du-sok (Shi-hoo Park) confesses to the media that he committed serial murders that took place more than 25 years ago. The case having passed the statute of limitations, the police detective Choi (Jae-yeong Jeong), who was in charge of the case, can do nothing about it.

As a ""proof"" that he is really responsible for the deaths of ten women, Lee Du-sok has written a confessional book about what he did, which becomes an instant bestseller. Lee Du-sok is now a media sensation, but some people just don't like it, and they have their own plans for the seemingly repentant murderer.

The subject matter is considerably serious (reminiscent of a real-life case of Hwaseong serial murders that inspired Bong Joon-ho's ""Memories of Murder""), but ""Confession of Murder"" is in fact surprisingly action-packed, with the thrilling street/rooftop chase sequence at the opening and some over-the-top action involving a crossbow and snakes (yes, you heard it right, ""snakes"").

As is the case with thrillers with twisty plots, ""Confession of Murder"" is a potboiler full of forced contrivances and plot holes, but the well-acted thriller keeps a brisk pace and is never boring.",1374364800,3,1344,5.155963302752293
