7845414,1,630334111X,"The reason that this film lacks cohesion between the animation and live action, is that the creator did not create any of the animated segments. All of this film's animated sequences are taken directly from Mamoru Oshii's brilliant yet obscure film, Tenshi no Tamago (Angel's Egg), and justice is certainly not done to it. Many people (including myself) consider the original film to be Oshii's best work, and it is without a doubt, a masterpiece. This film degrades it by cutting parts of it together with footage (live action) of a much lower standard.

I advise anyone who finds this film interesting to track down ""Tenshi no Tamago"". It is generally hard to find, but if you can get a hold of a copy (preferably an original widescreen DVD) it's well worth it - Tenshi no Tamago is certainly a film worthy of a five star rating.",1097625600,12,831,4.653061224489796
7845415,4,630334111X,"Set in an apocalyptic future the earth is slowly dying from a poisoned atmosphere. The fragile remnants of humanity wander the scared and broken land in search of a better tomorrow and finally when all hope seems to be lost one of earth's few survivors is ""found"" by an angel who just might hold the key to a new and better future for the last of the human race...
This is a curious little film, partly animated, partly real actors. I think the Director must have got the idea from Ralph Bakhi's film ""Lord of the Rings"" which came out in the late 1970s.  This film however lack's some of Bakshi's definition and neatness of blending scenes. Whilst Bakshi took real people and combined them with the animated characters in his film the Director of ""In the Aftermath"" jumps between anime and real actors, never combining the two so you think you are are watching two films instead of one. I have since found out that this film is a remake of a Japanese film called ""Tenshi no Tamago"" (made in 1985) and some of the sequences were cut from this film and grafted into ""In the Aftermath.""
Despite the obvious lack of budget for special effects, the rather flimsy acting from a group of unknowns, the obvious Australian accents, and rather cheesy wardrobe on offer there is something decidedly watchable about this remake. I have a real love for quirky little known (or watched) films of all genres and this one is quite at the top of my list. There's something to be said for ""B"" movies that don't quite make the grade despite what many critics say to the contrary.",1047600000,3,1561,4.535460992907802
