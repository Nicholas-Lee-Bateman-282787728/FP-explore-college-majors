2423727,5,B000BM7YVA,"Danny Gatton was 'THE' most accomplished all around guitarist that has ever graced our planet. Not only could Danny 'humble' most other pickers; he was also very adept in genres such as jazz, rockabilly, slide guitar, bluegrass, and well... anything he wanted to play he could play with seeming effortlessness.

Not only do I own his second Hot Licks tape, Strictly Rhythm Guitar (required for ALL guitarists), I also play a Telecaster. Mr. Gatton was certainly not the first player to wrap his hands around a Telecaster (aka The Plank)but he certainly ranks high up on that short list of 'Telemasters'.

In my further study of this wonderful gentleman I ordered his first Hot Licks video titled accordingly 'Telemaster'. I highly recommend this video because Danny explains in full his many different and varied playing techinques. The split camera work is excellent. PLUS...not only is Danny Gatton a virtuoso, he is also a master teacher. Even though he confesses to be a self proclaimed 'ear player' his ability to communicate on a friendly basis is outstanding. Not all great guitarists can teach and not all great teachers are virtuoso guitarists. But Danny Gatton has that rare ability to teach with intelligence without being condesending to the student. Now all of this is enough, but I love Danny's sense of humor! He comes across as very down to earth and not at all full of himself. The only bummer is that Danny's lapel mike (on his shirt) does not pick up his voice too well. While the guitar sounds fine, the explanations are somewhat hard to decipher as the volume level is so much lower on his voice. I'm wondering why this could not have been 'tweaked' when it was mastered from VHS tape to DVD. On the positive side the DVD makes great use of chapters and going directly to what you want to view. Similar to 'Strictly Rhythm Guitar' Danny Gatton's 'Telemaster' is something that you can view 100 times and get something out of it every time. Buy this DVD and learn from one of the best!

We miss you Danny!",1158537600,9,2025,4.730878186968838
2423728,5,B000BM7YVA,"Danny starts by stating ""I'm really an un-educated ear player who doesn't know much theory"" Holy crap! This man had a sense of humour! Then he proceeds to blaze through the most complex chordal/single string passages without a blink of an eyelid whilst reaching for the volume pot to create the most alarming ""crying"" swells. This man was GIFTED..i would even go so far to say he was a genius. The cascading harmonics are among the most difficult aspects to learn. I tried  to keep up with Danny at certain points and i nearly ended up in traction!!  Gatton displayed the harmonics more impressively than Lenny Breau could, and that's saying something.  What also is a striking feature is the tone that Danny gets from his weather beaten 1952 Fender Telecaster. The tone is rich and mellow but also snarls like a tiger when he switches to lead pickup.
 I find it hard to grasp his technique because this man was a naturally endowed musician who didn't have to think about what he's playing. It's difficult for him to explain something that is, to him, a natural reflex but he goes about it well. His style went far beyond just country picking although lap steel harmonies figure alot in his repertoire.
  But all said and done the whole film is worth 10 stars just to catch a rare glimpse of one of the most underrated and talented guitarists since the days of Django Reinhardt & Les Paul.
 I just wish he could come back and teach us the rest of it.",1146700800,33,1450,4.532567049808429
2423729,5,B000BM7YVA,"Who best to show different guitar techniques than the man who knew them all??!!

Danny was an outstanding player who through all his Jazz knowledge and musical background had many tools to his advantage;

and he used them all so well...

Who knows what could have been....RIP Danny...we all miss you.",1138752000,5,300,4.8431372549019605
2423730,4,B000BM7YVA,"Danny Gatton was one of the greatest guitarists this planet has ever known.  Few would argue that.  And watching Danny in this DVD is an incredible experience for anyone who is a fan of his music.  It is awe-inspiring to watch Danny lay down some of the licks we've listened to so many times.  It is at the same time a little intimidating; the man was on another stratosphere with his understanding of the fretboard and virtually every kind of music in general.

I had this on VHS years ago and have lost it since.  But I'm glad I did, because this DVD is far superior to that VHS format, though the overall setting does seem just a little dated.  Not only are the sound and picture much better and more consistent, but some of the DVD features make it much easier to navigate and to study certain portions.  The entire DVD is divided into ""lessons"", which can be accessed directly through a main menu.  Each lesson can also be played back at a slower speed (half, I think) which makes it much easier to figure out how Danny did what he did.  The split screen is also wonderful for watching Danny's wonderful right hand fingering techniques.  Also included is most of the music (in Tab as well) as a study aid.  Again, be warned.  Even the tabulatures of Danny's playing are like nothing I've seen.  Amazing!

This was a master of his instrument at his peak.  This DVD is a must-have for Danny Gatton fans or any aspiring guitarist.",1136851200,29,1432,4.45
2423731,5,B000BM7YVA,Man This Guy Is Talented!!!!! a lot of skills to share on Arlen Roth's production re-released for DVD with extra material,1357689600,,121,4.809523809523809
2423732,4,B000BM7YVA,"If you want to see Danny Gatton play, this is a great video. Seeing his fingers fly accross the frets is amazing.
If you want to see him slow down and teach, well good luck. A great video to have as a keepsake. Too bad he ended it all.",1354233600,,235,3.816326530612245
2423733,1,B000BM7YVA,"There's no question that Danny Gatton is one of the greatest guitarists that has ever graced the planet, but it's pretty tough to follow what's going on if you're trying to learn how he does it.  It's a whole lot of playing, which of course is mind boggling and wonderful.  But when there is instruction, there's not enough explanation to exactly what's going on and then he just starts playing again -- really fast.  Even the slowed down examples are hard to follow as the camera angles miss what he's doing in the left hand.  I bought a Redd Volkaert DVD called Stolen Licks and it was about 10-15 ""riffs"" that he clearly explains, not to mention how clear the video is.

I'm sure I'll learn a couple of things from the Gatton video, but, really, shame on Arlen Roth for not making sure it was much clearer.",1349913600,3,809,4.4391891891891895
2423734,4,B000BM7YVA,"Danny Gatton is easily one of the most under appreciated talents to have ever played the guitar. His talent is spell-binding. Danny can make a telecaster do things no mere mortal would dream of. Yet, as an instructional DVD, I don't know... The art of making instructional course has advanced immensely since Danny made this and his untimely death. He breezes through his vast skills with barely a pause to catch up. But, I would suggest, don't buy this so much as to learn techniques, but to sit silently at the footstool of a master. It's worth it to watch in awe. It's great entertainment. If you pick up a trick or two along the way, all the better.",1301961600,,653,4.495798319327731
2423735,5,B000BM7YVA,"Just watching Danny play makes you better. No joke.

The only short-coming is in the production. His voice ducks behind the guitar which makes it hard to hear some of his explanations but he's clear if you listen.

Danny stresses the ear a lot, sometimes at the expense of musical training. While it's true that a musical education doesn't guarantee greatness, it has never diminished a musician who is great and also educated. Still, his message is spot on: You have to hear what you want to play. It's about building a vocabulary, not just knowing how to spell.

I'll watch this again and again and only catch an atom of Danny's universe.",1272931200,2,640,4.646017699115045
2423736,5,B000BM7YVA,I would recommend this CD for anyone interested in playing guitar or just listening to a great talent. I surely wish he was still with us. He was one of the best.,1248480000,,162,4.09375
2423737,5,B000BM7YVA,... and I listen... again and again. What a great video of a true master of his craft.,1201564800,,86,3.8333333333333335
2423738,4,B000BM7YVA,If you go to get guitar lessons you'll more than likely have a guitar teacher that loves to show his chops on your time. While he's wackin' away on his guitar you're paying per hour and they usually charge more than $20.00 a guitar lesson. I've got a solution to those horrible guitar teachers... this series of videos. Why not watch a pro play guitar. Much better than traditional lessons.,1177632000,3,390,4.585714285714285
2423739,5,B000BM7YVA,"For any guitar player the ""Telemaster"" by Danny Gatton is a must-see. Now finally on DVD format, this educational piece of jewel reveals how to play some of the finest licks of the late Telecaster legend. Regardless of your current skills, you will learn more with Telemaster.",1167868800,2,276,4.8936170212765955
2423740,2,B000BM7YVA,"Danny Gatton is an amazing guitar player, but this dvd is not that great. Its cool to see him up close doing his thing, but the tablature print in the accompanying booklet is microscopic and there aren't too many examples of his famous techniques. He spends more time on his jazzier side than he should, and gives too little focus to his use of double stops and barely speaks of his chicken' picken' and use of his fingers, perhaps his best technique. The ability to watch the examples in real time and in slo-motion is nice, but unless you are a big fan (and even then) this is not the best product to get to play like Gatton.",1162512000,7,627,4.322033898305085
8088803,5,B000BM7YVA,"I've been playing for over 50 years. I know a lot of tricks and licks, but watching this video there's still more to lean. This is a great disc  for anybody who wants to expand their playing.",1519948800,,191,4.162162162162162

8088807,3,B000BM7YVA,"My guess is, back when this was recorded it was Top Notch.  But compared to today's video lessons, it's  ""OK at best"".  For a great example of how these guys have learned better how to make instructional guitar videos, HotLicks is superb.  A great series is  Steve Trovato's  ""Country Guitar in Six Weeks"".  The title (SIX weeks?!!!!!!!!!!!!) is a bit ambitious, but the content and delivery is the best I've seen.",1456704000,,414,4.746478873239437
8088808,3,B000BM7YVA,"This is mostly Danny showing off his nonchalantly self-absorbed attitude and a few licks and tricks. I found his attitude to be rather condescending and note, with no joy, that he ultimately was unhappy with himself and ended his life. A lot has changed in the years since this video was made, and there are many good instrumental lessons of YouTube that are free. But if you want to learn to play an instrument in depth, Hot Licks is definitely not the label to choose: go to Homespun and get properly thought-out, sequentially developing lessons that will really help you understand what your instrument and how to make it you own.",1411430400,,633,4.711711711711712

8088810,5,B000BM7YVA,"I've had this DVD for a long time and I enjoy watching and attempting to learn Danny's licks.  However, the sound mix is horrible as you're always trying to listen to Danny over the guitar.  Still, I gave it five stars because it, like the follow-up DVD, ""Strictly Rhythm Guitar"", is like having Danny in your living room teaching you personally one-on-one.",1394928000,,357,4.741935483870968
8088811,4,B000BM7YVA,"I would never give five stars as there is always room for improvement.
However I find the reviews of any purchase of any musical knoweldge from someone at this level to be funny.
Music lessons are 25 to 50 dollars an hour anywhere in the country.

If I only get one Danny lick for 20 bucks it is a steal...Get it!",1388275200,2,313,4.131147540983607
