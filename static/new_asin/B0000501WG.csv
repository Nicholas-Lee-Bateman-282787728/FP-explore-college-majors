How this film has eluded an english-friendly DVD release for so long is beyond me.  I would think the Kurosawa connection alone would command more interest from western audiences and at least merit a VHS (VHS was still the main release format when this film came out) release if not a DVD or Blu-ray by now.
I would strongly recommend Criterion Collection consider this film for a fancy DVD/Blu-Ray release. It certainly meets all their criteria. Please add a comment to this post if you know where a DVD release with English sub's can be found. -Thanks",1280188800,4,795,4.559440559440559
7928662,2,B0000501WG,"To be honest, I'm disappointed after watching the movie. Clearly this is an artist's piece, or exhibit, but not in any way a samurai movie, or a good Japanese movie.

The plot is very simple.  An aimless ronin (Misawa) traveled with his tender wife and was stuck at the local inn by the rain. The movie does not say where they want to go. Even with his wife's disapproval/displeasure, he dueled at the local joint (dojo) and arranged a feast for the other travellers stuck at the same inn. Later, he was courted by the local lord as its master of arms, but offended the lord instead (not his fault). After waiting day or days at the inn for the job he really wanted, he reluctantly got on the road at the urging of his wife.

This movie is in stark contrast to the other movie ""When the Last Sword is Drawn"" (Kanichiro). Kanichiro left his confortable clan job (fencing instructor) and served the Tokugawa shogun, because of his strong belief. He was torn between his belief and his obligation to his wife and family. In this movie, Misawa was mostly emotionless and did not show any desire to fight, to win. He left three former feudal lords, just because he could not serve under any master. This defeats the very meaning of being a samurai: to serve and be loyal to his master. Also, Misawa did not seem concerned to support his wife.

This movie is mostly an artist's imagination, or a pacifist's movie. The script was written for the 20th century and beyond, but the settings are about 200 years ago.

Also, the pace of the movie was very slow, particularly with the long cheering/celebration by the poors at the inn, and Misawa's sword waving/self practice.",1276473600,4,1663,4.567114093959732
7928663,5,B0000501WG,"This is a quietly deep film about a ronin - a samuria without a master - on the road with his wife.  This is a difficult state for a Japanese, who feels most comfortable as part of a larger group; indeed, it is shameful that he is not under a loyalty oath to a prince.  In addition, there is an elegant tension with his wife, who appears disappointed or angry with him.  Because of the rain, they are stuck in an auberge with many poor people, whom the charismatic samurai brings together in a act of generosity, even to the local prostitute.  They all feel renewed and included.

As the weather clears, the ronin goes for  walk, only to break up a silly fight between neophyte samurai, which is observed by a local prince.  The ronin is invited to his palace, where he is interrogated about his skills and eventually challenged to prove his skill in order to become his weapons master.  It becomes clear that the ronin is highly skilled, yet has some character flaws.  He returns to his wife, forlorn but they arrive at greater insight into each other.  It is a truly beautiful and understated story about redemption, challenging many notions we have of Japanese culture, which is a sign of the innumerable layers in this masterpiece.  Of course, there is also some violence, but it is minimal and graphically realistic.  The story ends without much resolution, and the viewer is left to imagine what will happen.  (I love that aspect of many non-American films.)

Warmly recommended.",1262563200,11,1485,4.661538461538462

This admirable statement comes from Bushido, the Code of the Samurai, that prescribes rigorous military training and practice, severe self-discipline, personal honor, and loyalty to superiors and country.

A consecrated Samurai without Feudal Master, becomes a Ronin, according ancestral codes. His anti conventional behavior brings him many problems of insertion inside the establishment. He even asks himself the sense of your existence at the same beginning of the film. Gradually-as a soft spring breeze- we will know about more and more about his little secrets, his way of living and his very calmed temperament. His ambitions go far beyond the dead letter, it seems to be in the way of redemption and expand this purpose to major areas, he enjoys bringing a little bit of happiness to the rest of the village.

Soon he will meet a Feudal master who wishes to hire him as arms master of his feud. And he will have to prove the origin of his title and his abilities as warrior.

The script is simply breathtaking, with that admirable and serene rhythm of Kurosawa, its screenwriter. You will be invited as special guest to presence one of the most admirable and artistic films ever made. The sumptuous photography,  the paradisiacal landscapes and the script are a true feast for your eyes and spirit too.

Gadadhar Chatterji stated once. "" Men, even ignore it, do what they do, follow the roads who follow, unavoidably the day will come in which they will be trap within the red circle.""  And the red circle means the literal translation of Hinomaru, the word that appoints the solar symbol of the Japanese flag.

An admirable film, that proves once more the artistic possibilities of the author cinema are so far to be exhausted.",1134432000,11,1845,4.872204472843451
