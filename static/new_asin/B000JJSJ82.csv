this is a brutal and unflinching work of ART.

consider this:

When a reviewer of J.G. Ballard's novel Crash suggested that the author was ""beyond psychiatric health,"" Ballard replied ""I took it to mean complete artistic success.""

I can think of no movie that I have seen that will prepare the viewer for CANNIBAL; however, in my case, two novels did help a little:

Zombie by Joyce Carol Oates

&

Exquisite Corpse by Poppy Z. Brite.

This movie is so effective that I GUARANTEE it will inspire future ""cannibal romances.""

2673151,5,B000JJSJ82,"It has taken me awhile to write this review because I was so shocked by this movie after I saw it. It has stuck with me for the past week and it is probably a movie that I will never forget. What makes it so scarey is that it is based on a true story and is very factual. Be warned: this is a very gory movie and some of the scenes are very graphic for the gore. This movie also doesn't have much for dialog, but it really doesn't need dialog for the story being told. If you want a truely scarey horror flick, then see this movie. I do highly recommend it.",1174780800,18,557,3.8947368421052633
2673152,5,B000JJSJ82,"I watched this film with a few friends,

i have regretted that day since then.

i should have watched it myself first and decide whether or no i should show it to my freind audience.

boy did i screw up.

This first and foremost is not a work of fiction, it is based on fact. gruesome hideous fact. it spares no shot, it leaves nothing to the mind. it has you cringing deeply and honestly. you have a hollywood version of cannibalism, this is not that. it has penis removal, it has intense gay intercourse, it has uncontrollable bowel movements, it is not for fans of conventional horror. only the die hard jaded audience need apply. you feel dirty after watching this, wash it off with some hollywood crap.

even that feels good after the reality this puts on the screeen before you.

2673153,5,B000JJSJ82,"Firsly, let me just say that I think it helps, when watching this film, if you are already familiar with the story behind the true events that happened in Germany.

There is very little dialogue in this film (which is one of the reasons why it helps if you already know what's going on, at least for the first half).  When the 'Flesh' is introduced to the story, the pace begins to pick up and the film starts to take it's, sometimes hard to watch, shape.  Let me just say that if you are homophobic you may struggle with some of the scenes in this film, but let me just say, get past that because it's worth it.

Although it starts off a little slow, when it does pick it, it takes off at lightspeed and the gore is intense, and one or two scenes will have you squirming in your seat!  From what I have read on several news web sites, and can remember of this being in the news, it stays true to the main facts quite well and for that reason alone can be difficult to watch.

This film isn't really meant to be enjoyed, not in the typical meaning of the word, but I highly recommend this for anyone who is into the more extreme and exploitation genres, but for anyone else, be warned - this film truly isn't for everyone!",1173657600,13,1222,4.178723404255319
2673154,4,B000JJSJ82,"There are hardly any spoken lines in this movie because it's more based on their actions more so than verbal.  The movie portrays the story of how two male individuals meet, bond, make love, and then kill and eat each other.  In my opinion, you must have a tough stomache in order to endure the extreme gruesome scenes in the movie because there will be scenes where you'll see the man cutting another man like a person would to a deer hanging from a hook.  So, if you can handle watching cannibalism and watch them chomp on each other then THIS movie is a major extreme emphasis on cannibalism.  Do not expect a Texas Chainsaw Massacre type scarey scenario, or ghosts popping out, or people with sharp teeth eating other humans.  NO...this is by far nothing near close to being a horror or a thriller.  It's more of a psychological exploration of how far humans will go in fulfilling their desires, need, and imagination by making it come to real life, etc.  I will honestly say that I could hardly eat for a few days after watching this movie.  Certain scenes had to be fast forward because it was that disturbing and disgusting!  I am a major horror fan and can normally handle gory scenes, BUT this was just straight stomach churning, vomit inducing gross!  After watching this movie, it made me wonder how a human being can survive in this modern day society with desires of wanting to eat another human being and then enacting it in real life.  Even the guy who wanted to be eaten made no sense to me.  But eh, those people do exist and live miserably in society.  I strongly suggest for you to have a strong stomache in order to watch this movie.

2673156,5,B000JJSJ82,"""Cannibal"" has to be the most macabre thing I ever viewed.  It goes beyond gross, vile and stupid.  It explores every twist and ""kink"" of a sick obsession of the human cannibal and his all to willing prey.  As my partner Eddie said:  ""That movie strips the soul out of man and proves he is nothing but a bunch of MEAT!  I feel disgusted that all I am is slabs of meat!""",1168128000,9,369,4.069444444444445

 The actors were wonderful, the dubbing worked quite well, and in certain parts it even look like they've used slide film.

 I am by far one of the biggest horror/ gore junkies I know, and I have to say this is the best film i've seen yet, from unearth films.

 The director did an amazing job, and I can't understand why the last person would give such a bad review other than ignorance and perhaps feeling uncomfortable during the homosexual parts.",1167264000,13,583,4.611650485436893
2673158,1,B000JJSJ82,"The majority of the times I go into these films with no intention whatsoever.  I'm not a gorehound, but I'm willing to give mindless horror films a chance; it just so happens that more often so than not they fail horribly, this is just another example, one more title to put among the ""Reasons modern horror does nothing for me.""

I GUESS I can appreciate the attempt to keep it to true to life as possible, but it just got SO redudant so fast, HEY LOOK MANJUNK, MORE MANJUNK HOW SHOCKING AND OUT OF THE ORDINARY, OH NO HE'S CUTTING OFF HIS JOHNSON, OOO, GROSS, that I had to fight from slamming my head against the wall.

The acting, what little there was, was truly terrible.

I guess with the vast majority of the film being a, more or less, ""silent"" film, in the sense that Dr. Caligari is silent, but with accompanying music, they were trying to create SOME sort of atmosphere, added with the dusty rooms and the unshaved bodies of the lead roles, but again, it failed totally.

The gore wasn't impressive, human beings do not bleed bright red, I thought we learned this in the 70's.  I mean, I love the Italian horror films that are soaked in bright red blood, but when trying to present a serious, realistic film do not go in that direction.

The golden age of German film making is dead, gone, it's only survivor being Werner Herzog, just as the Russian film making scene is empty, and I can see why with schlock like this being shoved out of it's bowels that no one in their right mind cares anymore about anything that leaves it's immediate borders.",1165795200,8,1559,4.43006993006993

2673180,1,B000JJSJ82,"I would have given this film 5 stars in the departments of gore and uneasiness, but i hate this movie. I own a copy and feel like i need to get rid of it as soon as possible.(watched it twice to get a full spectrum of it) Ive watched alot of EFFED up films from plain gore to psychological terror (ex: Flower of Flesh and Blood, Tumbling Doll of Flesh, Serbian Film, Men Behind the Sun...many others), but this one ABSOLUTELY takes the cake in making you feel guilty for even watching it. Its a german film with VERY little dialogue at all (oddly enough they speak english). But the special effects (at least i THINK they are FX)...are very very convincing in terms of looking realistic. The castration scene is the crescendo of NASTY in this movie. I urge you not to even bother picking this one up, but if you want a SICK and cheap thrill for your own twisted, guilty pleasures....BON APETITE...and oh yeah...its based on a true story. yuck",1329609600,2,942,4.4508670520231215
2673181,1,B000JJSJ82,"Honestly, I rented this because the description was interesting, and I don't mind gory films. I read that there was a gay romance between the killer and victim, but I figured that would be tolerable. I was wrong. This movie has more gay sex than Brokeback Mountain. Prepare for tons of wang. I mean seriously. Whatever amount of male nudity you think you're expecting, you're wrong. This may seem like the worst part of the film to some, but everything about this film is equally awful.
The film stock is cheap and blurry, almost like old VHS quality. I can overlook that in a low-budget or indie film, but here it's just one more thing to complain about. What I can't overlook is the piece-of-crap cinematography. Zooming in for an extreme close up of EVERYTHING does not make you an artistic filmmaker, nor does holding the camera at an angle. Gah.
I love piano music, which can often stand alone in the background just fine. Here, however, the trite little melodies lack the character of John Carpenter's Halloween theme.  Also, the music sounds like it was recorded on the tape deck I had in 1986, rather than professional equipment.
The sound mix is bad, with inappropriately loud sound effects throughout the film. When the camera is pulled away from the actors, we shouldn't hear them like they have microphones in front of their faces. Oh, and I could have done without the horse noises during the gay sex scene.
The English dubbed voice actors are atrocious. I tried to switch the audio to the original German, but did not see an option to do so. It doesn't matter, I guess. Even in the scenes without words, you can tell how bad the actors are. In fact, the first twenty minutes don't really contain any talk. We're subjected to watching the main character's failed attempts at dating / meeting a potential victim, which are acted out with horrible over-acted pantomime. I hate you, movie. I wish you were never born.
If you want to see bloody male private parts and lots of body hair, you've found a real treasure. If you're a horror fan, this movie isn't good enough for you. I will admit the gore IS quite realistic.  I suspect that animal entrails were used toward the end, as the viscera was far too well done to match the budget of the film. This is unfortunate, because this level of gore will lure some of you into watching one of the crappiest movies ever made.",1310342400,,2380,4.597647058823529

2673183,1,B000JJSJ82,"I was under the impression that this is a horror movie; but it isn't.  This movie is actually a love story.  The men meet when one places an ad looking for someone to be his victim so to speak.  The two men meet and discover that one wants to eat and the other wants to be eaten.  The first part of the movie is about the men getting to know eachother then having sex.  The other half is about the one man trying to eat the other.  I am not offended by the gore or nature of the film....the reason for the sad review is that this film is BORING!!  There is only a few minutes of dialogue in the entire film so you don't get a feel for the characters, the few words that are spoken seem rather cardboard and it would have been nice for the film to include a few facts about the court case considering this is German's first case of cannibalism and since the victim was willing the courts could not charge him with murder.",1291593600,3,920,4.0777777777777775
2673184,5,B000JJSJ82,"Cannibal- A film by Marian Dora, starring Carsten Frank, Tobias Sickert and Victor Brandl. Run time: 89 min. Language: English. This film documents the events that took place in 2003 when an ad was placed via the internet for a subject willing to be voluntarily consumed. The ad received a response and all the shocking events were captured on video tape, which were actually used for evidence at the trial. There are warnings on the front and the reverse of this DVD case cautioning viewers of it's extreme content and graphic violence and now, believe me I know, a lot of films have done the same thing, but let me assure you that this one delivers.
This film allows the viewers to emotionally connect with the demented storyline, the mentally unstable actors and then absolutely disgusts them at the same time (Very well done!). The GRAPHIC imagery is unforgettable, brutal and absolutely mesmerizing. This film is NOT easy to watch and will certainly have the viewers very, very uneasy, repulsed, sickened and even possibly wishing that they had not sat through the entirety of this picture. There are far few too many films that leave and aftershock like this one does and the thing that will really haunt you is that this was based on actual events, not a group of writers trying to create the next gross-out flick of the year.
This film documents the lives and deaths of two of the most depraved individuals to ever walk the face of the earth and like my title says, if you think you can handle it you are in for a real treat. Just be very aware that the images set forth in this film will linger inside you for a long time to come and to the fragile few who might attempt to view this out of pure curiosity, you will surely regret it!
5 stars for turning acts so utterly vile into something almost beautiful and I must say that I was extremely impressed, shocked and quiet caught off guard with this film and still find myself thinking about it from time to time (aftershocks!). Definitely view this film with caution (graphic scenes of cannibalism, violence, gore, male intercourse and brutality) and yes, the sour feeling in your stomach and in between your legs will eventually fade away!",1278374400,3,2199,4.641025641025641
2673185,5,B000JJSJ82,"You heard about the real story, right? A movie about it couldn't possibly not be disturbing, right? Well, It's insanely disturbing! Hell, it's probably (I can't tell for sure because I was really tired when I watched it) the most disturbing movie I have ever seen and I've seen all of the movies that people consider disturbing! The fact that someone was crazy enough to want to eat someone alive and that someone was crazy enough to want to be eaten alive is *beep* scary! What makes someone THAT crazy? I'd really like to know. I know that most of the times it's something that happened when they were young, but what could make someone feel like eating his own dick and sharing it with someone? Those events just prove that (some) humans are way worse than any animal... Anyway, this movie shows EVERYTHING! It's very graphic, realistic and disgusting! There's almost no dialogue (a good thing because the dubbing is so bad that it's funny), the soundtrack is really weird and it just makes everything even more disturbing! I felt sick even when there was nothing sick to see! It feels a bit like Schramm, but it's way more disturbing! You want to be entertained? DON'T watch this movie! You want to feel sick? WATCH this movie! I give it 5/5, but I'm pretty sure that I won't watch it again.",1257638400,3,1295,4.586206896551724
2673186,3,B000JJSJ82,"Cannibal is a cinematic interpretation of the true story of two insane German men who met on the internet and then allowed one to cannibalize the other on film. The film depicts these two men as very lonely and mysterious men who act generally very normal in public. When they are alone together, they are like mad dogs who are obsessed with each other. They are constantly having sex and they grope each other almost nonstop. The entire first hour of the film consists of these two men meeting each other, having sex, and doing weird stuff. The last part of the film shows the long and drawn out process of one cannibalizing the other. As you can probably tell by my description, this film may or may not be your cup of tea. I personally found it to be a very effectively done piece with some really good ideas and some truly unique visuals. However, the film is not without it's flaws. The problems I have with this film mostly have to do with the technical quality of the film. I liked the way that this was shot. Much of the film is dimly lit, and I liked this approach to the violent scenes in particular. However, I despised the way it was edited. The constant fade-outs and the weird zooms made it feel too much like a Nine Inch Nails music video. It gave the film an unneeded sense of style that I felt took away from the dark mood of the picture. In addition to that, the film is really really badly dubbed into English and it comes off incredibly distracting during some of the more dramatic scenes. One of the character's voices sounds way too high pitched and it's unintentionally funny and weird. I also wasn't a big fan of the mid-section of the film where the characters were just frolicking around. After a while it feels somewhat trite and redundant. Approximately 85% of the shots in this film show either penises or asscheeks, so if you're uncomfortable with watching male nudity, do not watch this film. The one major problem I have with the film is the way it opens. I liked it, but it goes on far too long. Basically the opening depicts the childhood of the main character who cannibalizes the other man. It shows him having a story read to him by his mom, but it's so slow and it just hammers it's implied symbolism too hard. I think that Marian Dora, if he is going to make another film, needs to try and be more subtle with his symbolism. Cannibal is still an effective film, however, and it has a lot to do with the way the story is presented. The man who ends up being digested is depicted as being rather sinister and sneering. At times, he comes off incredibly vampiric. This helps the audience grow more accustomed to the situation and allows us to identify more with the man who cannibalizes him, which was an interesting direction for the film to go in. I especially liked the scenes where they are driving on the road, which allows the exposition to not get in the way of the situation that these two men put themselves in. They are normal looking people, which I also appreciated being emphasized. It made the film a lot more scary to show more of the normal behavior of the characters. They look like two random men you would see out on the street in everyday life. I can understand how this would make viewers uncomfortable, but I found it an admirable path for the film to take. When the cannibalism does happen, it's some of the goriest violence you will ever see. To call this film gory as hell wouldn't nearly be doing it justice. This is, no doubt, one of the goriest films ever made. This not only contains the blood and the gore and the guts and the bones, but also all the other bodily fluids that nobody would ever take into account. The urine, the cum, the feces, the vomit, and the pus are all put on display and shoved into the faces of the audience. This is a disgusting, rotten, horrible film, but it is also one of the more fearless true crime exploration films I've seen and I admire it for that alone.",1257120000,10,3954,4.395634379263302

2673192,4,B000JJSJ82,"Watching this film is quite an odd experience. On the one hand, ""Cannibal"" is a very amateur affair.
From a technical point of view, it appears to be shot on DV and transferred to 24fps.
The storytelling at the beginning is frustrating. Blandly sophomoric with overly long takes, overuse of close ups, forcefully lingering on irrelevant details - the cumulative effect of which points to poor writing. The play of events is a by-the-numbers copy of the reported facts, verbatim. In fact, reading Lois Jones' ""Cannibal,"" seems to bear this out since it mirrors the movie very accurately. The movie places moody bridges between the reported moments where we see the protagonist struggling or reveling with feelings or wandering around town, looking for love. All of this is shown with no sense of filmic structure and almost entirely without dialogue. All of this sounds terrible and, to be blunt, the beginning of the film, while accurate, is not worth mentioning.

But what the film lacks in storytelling flair, it more than makes up for in its depiction of the key events, which are ghastly in the extreme and quite explicit. The attention to gore and detail is stomach-turningly impressive. It should be added that the performance of how these two men actually went about killing and being killed has the desperate, awkward stamp of authenticity to it; the actors achieve a haunting, passionate fervor. Also, the sexual nature of their relationship is captured in a way that the news reports could not approach. A good deal of screen time in the second half of the film is given to the complex texture of their very physical relationship, sexual and otherwise. It seems perverse and insane, yet resonates as true somehow. While there is no exploration as to the nature of either men's internal cues, the film displays the horrifying aftermath in detail. There is real curiosity given to the ambivalence that the protagonist has about flesh, organs and blood.

What I found most impressive about ""Cannibal"" was perhaps unintended - it looked simply awful, in every way.
Had a more accomplished crew made this film, it may have achieved glossy or professional sheen (like Hostel, for example) and reduced Messrs Miewes and Brandes' appalling ordeal into commercial horror. As it is, the aesthetic result translates into art quite well. i.e., It is difficult/contradictory/message-less - easier than a commercial film to read as metaphor, as well as its effective display of pathological attachment/need since there is no ""character-arc"" grafted on to it.  It also shuns overt commercial appeal while remaining compelling.
Thankfully, it also seems impossible to imagine a sequel.",1185321600,3,2679,5.097949886104783
2673193,5,B000JJSJ82,"I'm a horror fan who will be the first to admit that I am a little desenitized to violence of any kind. Watching Cannibal reminded me how real violence can be, but at the same time it showed me that in certain circumstances violence is merely part of a bigger picture. This film does indeed play out like a love story of sorts. The two men frolic together for a couple days, drinking wine, playing outdoors, sex etc. They are not monsters, just two people with deeply morbid desires. While there is no question that what the two men wanted was morally corrupt to the modern world, to them it was passionate. Sometimes love can be grotesque, and Cannibal confirms this I think. Yes, I was grossed out, but when the film ended I sympathized with both men. Do I agree with their urges? No way. But I'm human and can recognize that we are all flawed creatures regardless of blaming nature OR nurture. Normally I have a ball watching a bloody horror film, but I watched Cannibal with a very open mind, and delt with the uncomfortable scenes to get the bigger picture. I watched this movie as if I was trying to learn something from it, instead of just taking it for what it is and reveling in the gore/violence like I usually do. So yeah, I guess I'm saying all this b/c I wonder if anyone else saw where I was coming from. Regardless, this case study on Armin Meiwes is very graphic, heavy on homosexual content, but is a very riveting film. I recommend it to someone with an open mind AND a strong stomache. Viewing this film will require both. Recommended.",1184457600,9,1554,4.437062937062937
2673194,2,B000JJSJ82,"Well, this is one hard movie to review, especially in light of all the praise heaped upon it in other reviews.  But here I go, because this one just BEGS to be reviewed.

This film basically tells the story of two men, one a cannibal, one his willing meal(s).  It's a character study, not a suspense or thriller film, so don't expect a lot of action or edge-of-your-seat excitement.  Don't expect much dialogue, either, as almost nothing is spoken through the entire film.

Maybe more should have been said, because despite the subject matter, the generous frontal nudity, the horrifying 3rd act, and a minimalist overall approach that can work wonders in better hands, Cannibal is ultimately just a bore.  Rarely do I look at the clock during a movie, but at the 30 minute mark I was talking to the screen (""Will someone please DO something!"") and checking the time (""Man, another 50 minutes left?"").

The actual cannibalism is disgusting, especially the entire sequence from where the cannibal begins sawing off a part of the ""meat's"" anatomy to when they both eat it.

Yet when the cannibalism does finally kick in, it's completely inconsistent with dialogue earlier in the film.  The ""meat"" says early on that ""I don't want to suffer"", yet he's clearly in agony during and after that first bit of him is cut off and consumed.  With barely a dozen lines of dialogue, you'd expect one of the film's most important lines to carry some weight.  And when they eat, the cannibal guy can't do it.  What gives?  He ends up looking like a cannibal wannabe.

The camera work is annoying, unless you're a fan of painful closeups where the camera is so close to the actor's face that you can see to the bottom of his pores.  And these closeups are sprinkled throughout, not just gross-out closeups of chewing.  It's done for art's sake, and fails.  This trick almost never works, and I don't want to see an unattractive man's cheeks from one inch away.

To try to sum this up, I'd have to say this:  Cannibal is an atmospheric, unsettling, and brave film.  It's also dull as dishwater and inconsistent.  Maybe that's how it really happened, but this isn't a documentary, it's a film and therefore needs to be internally consistent.  If you're in it just for the gross-out last 1/2 hour, then by all means buy it and fast forward through the first 50 minutes.  You won't miss much.",1183939200,4,2372,4.649038461538462
2673195,5,B000JJSJ82,"Starts off with a kid being red a fairy tale whereas the WITCH wants to commit cannibalism (well, that's what it is!). Guy gets obsessed with every aspect of the human body. Sicko puts out an ad-another sicko answers it; they meet and says ""I am your flesh"". He really wanted to be eaten!  He got his wish. And it was brutal.

When you think about it, muscle tissue is muscle tissue-just another species when you eat that steak and like it red and juicy which is simply blood and dripping fat.  The death of the animals is incredibly painful and full of terror just before getting shot or their throat sliced. Yet tons of people just see the pretty package in the store and eat their blood and guts like the pigs they are.  Why do you think I'm vegetarian.

This shows the reality of meat. What it really is. And in the end with all of the horrendous gore, pain, and bleeding and cutting and sawing and slicing...there is a pretty dinner table with candle light and wine.

How more realistic can one get, you meat eaters. What gives the right for one species to exploit another just because they happen not to be the dominant species. Humans are just another animal on this earth. Don't forget that.  Reminds me of a TWILIGHT ZONE show about these beings from outer space...and their book, TO SERVE MAN...well, they served them all right :-) If we were not the dominant species...think about it. Would we end up on the dinner plate? Meat is meat...muscle tissue is muscle tissue.

Go eat your steak and burgers. Red and juicy.

I'll stick with vegeburgers.",1181606400,7,1556,4.5088967971530245
2673196,5,B000JJSJ82,"I watch movies to see something I haven't seen before. That's rare these days.  Hollywood is a 'business' and they're only interested in making movies that sell - hence a flooded market of mindless movies to satisfy the popcorn masses.  That being said, this is one of the most beautifully done, well filmed, intense movies I've ever seen.  It depicts the extremes of human behaviour and holds NOTHING back.  Yes, there are parts that are hard to take, but it's the same in real life. In fact, although most will disagree, this is a love story - albeit an odd one.  I think the director knew that and filmed it that way as well.

Visually the film is flawless.  In one scene we see the back of the man's head sitting in a chair.  We can see the other man standing in the darkened room.  They are talking while a large spider crawls into the opened window.  FANTASTIC!

If you want to see a film you won't soon forget, then I would challenge you to watch this movie.",1179273600,8,965,4.365168539325842

Apparently, ""the two made a videotape when they met on 9 March 2001 in Meiwes' home, in the small town of Rotenburg, showcasing Meiwes..."" Since those tapes are not for public viewing, this is meant to be as close as we'll get. It's very, very low budget and slow. And, oh my god, it is vomit inducing. I literally ran from the room to puke. However, the whole disturbing thing is fascinating, and so I say watch it if you're interested in the more disturbing side of humanity, and you can stomach it.",1509321600,,641,4.305785123966942

8151236,1,B000JJSJ82,"I knew going in that this was an indie film and being an Unearthed release, I didn't expect high quality film. That being said, this film is slow. The music is phenomenal with some good names oddly enough. But the acting is terrible, dialogue is sparse with little insight. There is proper gore at the end but you have to sit through a lot of the two guys being naked and sexual with one another first. There's even a scene of them frolicking naked in a field. The movie did a good job of making me feel uncomfortable but mostly because the two lead actors look like sex criminals. So watching these two unattractive, creepy men have sex is not something I wanted to sit through to get to the gore. This movie is usually very expensive due to its rarity. I'm lucky I only paid around 19 dollars. The Horror collector in me wants to keep it for its rarity but I know I'll never watch it again and I wouldn't recommend it.

If you wanna watch a messed up cannibal movie watch Cannibal Holocaust or Cannibal Ferox. If you want to watch something indie and made within the last 10 years, check out A Serbian Film or Dead Girl. They are both great films and totally messed up. If you want to stick with Unearthed films for the gore and super indieness of it, watch American Guinea Pig: The Bouquet of Guts and Gore. It's written and directed by the creator of Unearthed, Stephen Biro with fx by Marcus Koch. It's far better for your fill of gore.",1486339200,,1441,4.337037037037037

8151238,4,B000JJSJ82,"Lately I feel I have come across some of the most shocking and vile pictures to grace cinema. I find myself shocking my nerves over and over again and now I have done it again in the department of gore and sexual perversity once again.

Cannibal is based on actual facts yet the picture does change and alter some of the facts but in reality it keeps the most important parts. Flesh, human flesh has always been a subject throughout history and time. From the taboo to the normality of the daily bath to clean oneself. What is that human animalistic desire hidden deep inside the evolutionary makeup of the human body to eat meat?

The twisted sick taboo of consuming human flesh has been a subject of myths, legends, countless books and movies and in true reality the basic truth of everyday life. From the Christian communion of drinking and eating Jesus flesh to researching the tribes of ancients and even modern people's, who consumed their enemies to gain there strength and power.

How far can one go to be one with human flesh? Not just to lay with another but to become it in every way possible. To devour it, so that the one you possess will always be a part of you. The movie I am reviewing today is Cannibal the true story of human flesh obsession that left one man dead and another famous in criminal human history.

Inspired"" by the real life story of the ""Cannibal of Rotenburg"", Armin Meiwes. Armin on Christmas Day in 2001 visited his favorite chat site The Cannibal Cafe there he met Bernd Brandes they both had an obsession and that was human flesh. One wanted to eat it, the other wanted to be eaten. Armin would go on to eat Bernd for the next 10 months. Amazingly Armin only got 8 and a half years in jail, why you say because Bernd was a willing partner and both of them filmed the whole ordeal from beginning to end. The aftermath though would change because they decided to not charge him with manslaughter but with murder. He then received a life imprisonment after another long trial.

Now in the movie the two main characters do not have names they are known as the man and the flesh. The man searches the chat rooms. Not just any chat rooms but chat dedicated to human flesh eating. A chat room devoted to the desire of eating humans. It glorified cannibals and the meat of humans. The flesh searched and searched for one who would fill his most important and most wonderful desire. The man wished to eat another human. The Flesh was that desire. The flesh answered his call. The flesh desire was to be eaten where the man's desire was to consume.

8151239,4,B000JJSJ82,"FIRST, SPOILER ALERT, AND SECOND, I GET A LITTLE GRAPHIC ABOUT THE FILM, SO DO NOT READ IF YOU ARE UNDER THE AGE OF 21, OR HAVE A WEEK STOMACH FOR GORE. THANK YOU
(1) I KNOW that many people refer to this as a horror movie/it's classified as one. However, I would label it more as a drama (to the extreme). Personally, when I hear horror I picture killers chasing their victims down, cutting them up, and a lot of hunting and escaping, ect (like Friday the 13th, Nightmare on Elm St. and Hostel). However, in this film there is no chase, yes there is a killer, but the victim is willing to be killed. It is a movie I would classify as a disturbing romance drama. But it's up to you how you classify this movie. IT IS NOT A MOVIE FOR CHILDREN, AND NOT FOR THE WEEK OF HEART.
(2) I can't say that I stayed focus throughout the entire film. Initially first seeing it (knowing the story) I was intense/ waiting for the shock. After watching the film for a while, I realized that most of it revolved around two (un-attractive) gay men talking/ having relations. It wasn't until the end that the gore kicked on (which lasted for about 19 minutes). This movie has a lot of gore to it, but not until the very end.
(3) I have seen horror/ drama movies my whole life, and this was the worst for gore. Not that it was that amazingly done, but at the end it just went on and on and on. You see everything from the time the one man cuts the other one's privates off, all the way through until he had devoured his partner. By the end of the film I was feeling sick (due to all the on going gore). However, initially I thought ""it's about time,"" when the gore began (waiting for it to start since the movie's beginning). After the first 5 minutes of the gore scenes I thought it was a little gross, but no different then most gory films (like the gore in Hostel). However, by the end, as I had mentioned, the whole 19 minutes of watching a man cutting/ eating up his boyfriend (no breaks from this moment) I was grossed out....
Do not watch this film with high expectations, of amazing special effects, or a wonderful story, or that there will be a killer running around chopping people up, because if you do, you will be disappointed. Walk into this film, expecting an interesting story line (especially knowing that it was true), and an ending with a lot of on-going gore. Also, initially when I watched the one man cut the other man's privates off, and tried to feed it to him, I thought ""bull-s--t. No way did that happen."" However, I later discovered that it was true. In fact, the man supposedly couldn't chew threw his boyfriends privates, and he tried cooking it to soften it, then he gave up, and fed it to his dog....at least that is what I have read.",1407888000,,2746,4.282692307692308

8151243,5,B000JJSJ82,"I had heard, several years ago, that soldiers in a violent Arabic subgroup were capturing such American people as they could, and beheading them.  Bad enough.  And then they released a video of the procedure.  I watched it as they cut an American citizen's head off with what looked like a serrated blade knife while he was alive and trying to scream.  I felt guilty as hell for watching this, like I should have been trying to help, though in reality, he was dead before I ever watched the video.  But it was so morbidly fascinating, I couldn't look away.  I had already read about the true events on which cannibal was based before I saw the movie, so I knew what to expect sort of.  But Cannibal made me feel that same kind of guilt I'd felt watching the beheading.  It was a great movie for what it was, but it made me feel guilty and just horrible to watch this, as though I should have done something to stop these fools from committing this act of cannibalism.  If you think you can stand the gore, watch this movie, it is horrifying and may make you feel guilty and just dirty for even having watched it.  It does exactly what movies of this type are supposed to do and does it well.",1362009600,,1191,4.300448430493273
