The Sheriff acknowledges this is nothing he's seen befoer and seeks help. A pleasant change from the ""Super Sheriff"" who does it all at the cost of many lives.
Ian D. Clark is a wonderful surprise as an experienced tiger hunter,trying to do what he does best and save face after being kicked out of his home whan the Queen mum gave India back to the Punjabs. You feel for him as a character in many ways. And many of his words are profound.

2987151,1,B000WMFZII,"Where do I start? I'll do this while I watch the movie and try to not include any major spoilers.
-The very first scene and the director resorts to a cliche' jump-scare. Sad beginning.
-Mother says, ""Now go home and study the bible. And no playing make-believe."" Was this intentionally ironic?
-Gary Busey's jacket is a size too small....very funny. Apparently a costume designer was not in the budget.
-Also cliche'; Child makes incredible claim. No one believes him. *yawwwwwnnnnn* Going to be a long movie.
-Bite mark measurement...LOL...OMG...where have we seen that before? Just waiting for someone to say, ""This was no camping accident!""
-Sheriff in a small town under pressure from the mayor because an upcoming public event (corn and apple fest?LOL) is threatened. Outside expert is called in. Wow....getting the feeling that screenwriter phoned this in while on a beach somewhere..
- ""...make an announcement to the students telling them to not go into the woods"" (maybe put up some signs that say, ""Beach closed by order of the Amity Police Department"" ? That might help)
- Weird that the first two victims didn't even scream while they were mauled to death by a tiger while other people were just yards away. Dat Tigger got some serious juju! Starting to feel some real pain here. I wish Mystery Science Theater was still on. Maybe RiffTraxx will get ahold of this lemon.
- ""You can't just walk into the woods and kill a tiger."" Really? So they are endangered because of ...fatal apathy? Gas? Bad kibbles?

Not sure I can finish this movie ... if someone sticks a barrel into the tiger, I'll puke.
-Waiting for the mayor to wear a sports coat with anchors on it.
-Waiting for the tiger's tail to show up cutting through the underbrush like a shark's fin.
-Oh no!....someone posts a reward for the tiger! Are we going to change the movie title to ""CLAWS""? No. That was 1977. Darn!
- Yokels all go out after the tiger, greedy for the reward money. Seriously, they should have had Matt Hooper appear during this scene.
- Oh no! A shark cage...errr...a tiger cage!
- Ever hear of a movie called Ben? Really bad sequel to Willard. Think of that when you watch the scenes of the boy.
- Cocky inept National Guard cliche'. Let's give these guys a break!
- A stroke of pure genius! The expert isn't a young hipster. He's a caricature of the 19th century great white hunter from England. Complete with a wonderful proper English accent, tea set and long-stemmed pipe. I hope he quotes Kipling alot! Oh! And he's a colonel! All English hunters were colonels, ya know. Note to costume designer; Should have included a pith helmet for him. Would have been comedy genius to have him hire a bunch of native porters...picture a bunch of local yokels hauling his gear over their heads. My interest in the movie has been renewed.
- The National Guards sergeant's accent changes about four time in a single sentence. Now THAT's quality directing!
-Another screamless death. This tiger apparently engulfs the entire head first, then eats his way down. Look, I know a wild cat likes to go for the neck alot, but there is still time for a scream, No. seriously.
-""No no. The tiger is just hungry."". Holy crap, kid! He's chowed down on about five or six people at this point...in like three or four days! That's like 250 pounds of meat at least. This cat is either  bulimic or has an off-the-scale metabolism.
- Not sure i can make it. Another screamless kill. This tiger is not just hungry, he's totally blood-thirsty. Yep. Tigers are like that.
-Blood thirsty tiger ignores running, screaming little boy. At least the tiger has the sense to not totally alienate the audience. That or he's just too darned good to pluck such low-hanging fruit.
Okay....can't do this any more. Going to fast forward to the end. If they blow the tiger up, I will have lost faith in humanity completely.

Major spoiler...I have lost faith in humanity. Going to go sit on the porch and watch the birds.
Verdict: I'm in the wrong business. This movie proves that anyone with some connections can write screenplays or direct. It apparently takes no talent of originality or intelligence. My cat could have yakked up a better script.",1437523200,,4199,4.710204081632653

2987159,5,B000WMFZII,"MANEATER

The Maneater series is a pretty crazy one as it pits natures beats [real and not so much] against man. Usually they kill off man easily until the end where the lead takes them on and some how comes out on top. This movie starring Gary Busey was based on the novel ""Shikar"" by Jack Warner, and the movie also has a cool cover. I don't know why I needed to say that but I like the cover for this one.

An escaped Bengal tiger terrorizes a small town by hunting and killing of the townsfolk and the authorities that are after him. Turns out that some kid has a weird connection to the tiger as it comes by his house at night and watches him from the window, never attacks but just watches. The Sheriff of the town played by Busey is on the hunt and calls in the National Guard to help out. But as the body count rises and pieces are found every where it seems only a pro tiger hunter can make things right.

I have to say this is actually one of the better films in the series with Busey's eccentric facial expressions and a pretty good story. It is still your usual SyFy low budget movie but it is just done well in my opinion. Ty Wood is really good as the kid obsessed with the tiger, you may remember him from ""A Haunting in Connecticut"". Ian D. Clark as well is good here as the big game hunter looking to make up for a mistake in the past. There is also a super funny moment in which Busey answers a reporters question, you will know it when you see it.

The writer here and the director did a pretty good job here as the film always is entertaining. Also I kinda liked that they shot the movie with a real tiger instead of a CGI one. Sure that may take away from the kills a little but for me it worked so I applaud them for doing it. I think this was a really good movie and better than most of the made for TV SyFy stuff we normally see. I say check it out because it may surprise you, I am not saying you will like it as much as me but still.",1318550400,,1959,3.989795918367347
2987160,3,B000WMFZII,"If you are a fan of ""arrogant human gets comeuppance"" this is for you!

Perhaps because I had the lowest of expectations, I found myself cracking up at all the unintentional humor.

The ending blows the build up though - you don't really see what happened to the tiger. There was no justice, nor was there a cynical ending.  It's like the screenplay writers ran out of ideas or time.",1310169600,,383,4.442857142857143

2987163,2,B000WMFZII,"It's easy to become jaded about monster-of-the-week movies when you watch as many as I have as quickly as I have (sometimes, two a night). The routine is so familiar that I can plot the film out without watching: recluse disappears, mutilated corpse appears, innocents somehow blunder through without being eaten, military types arrogantly blunder in and get eaten, a professional monster-killer arrives, the beast's weakness is discovered, and then the monster is blown up in a climactic showdown.

Maneater hits every one of these notes without skipping a beat.  It throws in Gary Busey as a sheriff (Grady Barnes) in an ill-fitting suit, a British hunter out of a 1850s novel complete with victrola and tent (Ian D. Clark as Colonel Graham), and a God-fearing kid (Ty Wood as Roy Satterly) who has some bizarre connection to the beast in question.

In a Rubegoldbergian series of events, Roy blunders out into the street while sleepwalking, which causes a truck to flip, releasing its contents. And those contents are a black market tiger. Director Gary Yates is quite fond of this very first blue lit encounter, with a sleepwalking boy staring down at the reclining tiger, the shattered truck between them. He likes it so much he plays it a few times.

What is supposed to be a thriller turns into a heartwarming tale of a boy and his tiger. Roy keeps equating the tiger with Biblical tales told by his provincial mother, who forbids him from watching television. Soon he's talking to it, convinced that the tiger is his friend.

Fortunately, Maneater isn't going to let him off the hook so easily. What's refreshing about the film is that it has no easy gore shots to fall back on, just a real-life tiger.  The actors have to act and the writer has to actually write dialogue, because the majority of the kills take place off camera. Colonel Graham narrates each kill in a flashback, explaining how the tiger outwits its foes. The tiger has no supernatural abilities to get it out of a jam.  It's just a cunning beast.

With its austere setup, unobtrusive score, and meandering dialogue, Maneater is surprisingly pedestrian. But that's still a cut above some of the awful tripe that comes out of RHI Entertainment.",1287446400,,2219,4.821052631578947

Many lives are lost, including a national guard unit! MANEATER has some bloody body parts in it, but actual violence is mostly offscreen.

2987165,1,B000WMFZII,"The original book Shikar/Maneater by Jack Warner is an absolute masterpiece and is superbly and skilfully executed.  Every single episode in the book is riveting.  The movie unfortunately is a total flop - and who is Philip Norton?  A top flight actor  like Gary Busey is lost in the movie - in maneater territory, he walks around in a too tight suit and no firearms.  His hairpiece is a mess and distracting.  COL Graham's part could have been so much better done - he comes off as a somewhat supercilious fuddy-duddy completely lacking in common sense.  Again, no one with an iota of  common sense in maneater territory pitches their tent in the middle of a clearing while brewing tea and listening to classical music (a la Out of Africa) and having laundry hung out to dry.  The back ground music is awful.  The relationship between Roy and the tiger, as well as that between Roy and the Colonel is not explored at all.
I suggest a remake more along the lines of Ghost and the Darkness.

Poor Jack Warner must cringe when he watches this movie.  At least he can take comfort with the fact that his name is not associated with this travesty.",1275782400,,1143,4.521951219512195
2987166,4,B000WMFZII,"""Maneater"" is a made for TV movie about a tiger loose in the woods of Appalachia. The film is highly derivative of earlier films in the genre (notably ""Jaws"") but is actually better than most of the other comparable films. Understand that this isn't Academy Award fodder, but for a low budget horror movie, it works and is enjoyable to watch.

The film begins with several gruesome killings in the woods surrounding a small town. A local vet quickly examines the bite radius of the cast made from a victim's torso as being from a Bengal tiger. If that wasn't enough of a homage to ""Jaws"", the mayor also pleads that the sheriff not interrupt the ""Corn and Apple Fest"" due to concerns about the ravenous tiger. Gary Busey plays the sheriff, and exceeded my expectations, though he still has that kooky patina that makes him so interesting to watch. The tiger likes one boy (Ty Wood) who lives in a trailer, and therein begins the weird, mystical tiger-whisperer subplot that runs throughout the movie. Also making a peculiar entrance is Ian D. Clark as a Punjab tiger hunter. This at first struck me as utterly pointless, but actually his performance was one of the true highlights of the movie.

Needless to say, the carnage must continue for the film to work, and feeding grist into the mill is the Army National Guard, who show up with an arrogant smirk on their faces that doesn't last long. Aaron Hughes plays Sgt. Howe, and has a terrible accent that detracts from the generally good performances surrounding him. Fear not, his contingent is not part of the story for long. Throughout the film there are numerous confrontations with the press, and by the end I was praying that the Channel 8 Action News reporter could be eaten, preferably in slow motion, two or three times. Like the actual media, she was that annoying.

The film concludes with its final homage to ""Jaws"", an impossible gunshot to a tank of compressed gas. I was extremely amused despite the obvious derivation of the scene. The end of the film ties up several loose ends in a predictable, yet improbable manner, but seeing Gary Busey getting chased by a tiger was worth the price of the DVD by itself!

The film is a fine examle of contemporary B-cinema, and is one of the better made for TV creature-run-amok films I have seen; the cat is beautiful, the acting is good, the story is well-paced, and the price is right. What else could you want?",1258156800,6,2420,4.634032634032634
2987167,1,B000WMFZII,"A verry disapointing movie, almost no blood, and more disapointing, we see the tiger about 2 minutes. No suspense, don't worth buying.",1223683200,,134,5.136363636363637
2987168,4,B000WMFZII,"Here's an enjoyable piece of nonsense from the Sci-Fi Channel's ""Maneater"" series, a modern updating of the classic ""Nature Strikes Back"" subgenre of horror films.  In Maneater, a tiger is loose in the woods surrounding a small community where Gary Busey is sheriff.  It goes about hunting and killing and making the townspeople dreadfully uneasy.  What's even worse is that the damn tiger is a threat to the success of the annual Apple and Corn Fest.  There's also a boy who lives with his religious zealot of a mother that seems to have a kind of friendship with the tiger.  It's even hinted that he might have some slight psychic connection with the beast.  A British tiger hunter and the National Guard show up to kill the tiger, but since Busey is the star of the film, we're all pretty sure that in the end it'll be him in the final face off with the tiger.
I gave this movie a high rating of four stars.  It might be a tad too much, but three seemed too low.  It's not one you'll be wanting to watch frequently or purchase, but it's good popcorn entertainment.  It's got a bit of gore, but this is mostly aftermath stuff like big pools of blood, body parts and eviscerated corpses lying around.  Not much as far as actual animal attack scenes go.  And they use a real tiger!!  No CGI junk here, no sir!  It actually looks like an animal instead of a friggin' video game!  The cast is decent enough, though the script doesn't ask a lot from them.  Busey is his cool, kooky self.  He's a bit more ""normal"", but has a few funny lines here and there.  I will say the guy gets creepier looking as he gets older.  It's a performance on par with his portrayal of the Gingerdead Man(that was an attempt at humor, but it probably just sounds dumb).
No real complaints about the film coz it is what you'd expect a film like this to be, and as long as it meets expectations, it can't really disappoint.  My only complaint would be the tiger/child connection.  It's unnecessary, cliched and lame.  Thankfully is isn't expanded on too much.
All in all, a good waste of time.  I just bought a puppy tonight and he watched it with me(then peed on my chest), so I guess it'll hold some sentimental value for me.",1219190400,4,2202,4.398514851485149

2987170,5,B000WMFZII,"Part of a series of low budget films of animals gone amok that aired on the Sci Fi channel, this film is surprisingly good. For me, the main selling point was that we have an escaped Bengal tiger running amok in Appalachia and fighting with Gary Busey. What more do you need right there, I mean really?

Okay, so the plot really isn't all that complicated, essentially being yet another variant on every other 'animals run amok' movie since Jaws. Nonetheless, its quite enjoyable for such a cheesy flick (and they have a real tiger in it!). Ummm... you've got a Bengal tiger. And he escapes and starts picking off people in rural Appalachia. Gary Busey is the sheriff trying to stop it. Media frenzy ensues (complete with some reporter chick named 'Casey Couric,' lol). The army comes to hunt down the tiger, only to get eaten one by one (as highly trained and heavily armed soldiers are appearantly won't to do if movie logic teaches us anything). And a random British big game hunter, inspired by Jim Corbett, shows up to save the day.

Overall, its much better than you'd expect from a made for TV 'animal attack of the week' type movie. Sure, its kind of goofy at times. I mean, you could expect as much from the description on the box. But its also a fun movie, especially if its late at night or your just hanging out with your friends and want a straight out animal/monster attack movie. No complex plot, no surpise endings, just a regular animal going on a rampage. And the best part? Its actually the first in a series of such movies... with names like 'Grizzly Rage,' 'Eye of the Beast,' 'Shark Swarm,' and 'Swamp Devil' how can we go wrong?",1211587200,,1651,4.518394648829432

Most of these low budget animal-gone-wild-killing-people movies are very predictable, and much of this movie is highly derivative of Jaws. However, Gary Busey is plays the sheriff in a wonderfully understated way. The movie also injects humor at exactly the  right times.  An example was when the mayor gets upset about possibly losing the next election because of what was going on and one of the deputies deadpans that two of the dead weren't voters. And Ian Clark is superb as the experienced British tiger hunter. But what makes the movie different from so many others of the genre is the role played by Ty Wood.  While Tony the Tiger seems intent on eating everyone else, Roy seems to connect with the tiger.  There is a wonderful scene with Col. Jim and Roy discussing tigers. The action scenes were very well done and the ending is very exciting.  All in all, one of the best and unknown movies of this type.

-The very first scene and the director resorts to a cliche' jump-scare. Sad beginning.
-Mother says, ""Now go home and study the bible. And no playing make-believe."" Was this intentionally ironic?
-Gary Busey's jacket is a size too small....very funny. Apparently a costume designer was not in the budget.
-Also cliche'; Child makes incredible claim. No one believes him. *yawwwwwnnnnn* Going to be a long movie.
-Bite mark measurement...LOL...OMG...where have we seen that before? Just waiting for someone to say, ""This was no camping accident!""
-Sheriff in a small town under pressure from the mayor because an upcoming public event (corn and apple fest?LOL) is threatened. Outside expert is called in. Wow....getting the feeling that screenwriter phoned this in while on a beach somewhere..
- ""...make an announcement to the students telling them to not go into the woods"" (maybe put up some signs that say, ""Beach closed by order of the Amity Police Department"" ? That might help)
- Weird that the first two victims didn't even scream while they were mauled to death by a tiger while other people were just yards away. Dat Tigger got some serious juju! Starting to feel some real pain here. I wish Mystery Science Theater was still on. Maybe RiffTraxx will get ahold of this lemon.
- ""You can't just walk into the woods and kill a tiger."" Really? So they are endangered because of ...fatal apathy? Gas? Bad kibbles?

Not sure I can finish this movie ... if someone sticks a barrel into the tiger, I'll puke.
-Waiting for the mayor to wear a sports coat with anchors on it.
-Waiting for the tiger's tail to show up cutting through the underbrush like a shark's fin.
-Oh no!....someone posts a reward for the tiger! Are we going to change the movie title to ""CLAWS""? No. That was 1977. Darn!
- Yokels all go out after the tiger, greedy for the reward money. Seriously, they should have had Matt Hooper appear during this scene.
- Oh no! A shark cage...errr...a tiger cage!
- Ever hear of a movie called Ben? Really bad sequel to Willard. Think of that when you watch the scenes of the boy.
- Cocky inept National Guard cliche'. Let's give these guys a break!
- A stroke of pure genius! The expert isn't a young hipster. He's a caricature of the 19th century great white hunter from England. Complete with a wonderful proper English accent, tea set and long-stemmed pipe. I hope he quotes Kipling alot! Oh! And he's a colonel! All English hunters were colonels, ya know. Note to costume designer; Should have included a pith helmet for him. Would have been comedy genius to have him hire a bunch of native porters...picture a bunch of local yokels hauling his gear over their heads. My interest in the movie has been renewed.
- The National Guards sergeant's accent changes about four time in a single sentence. Now THAT's quality directing!
-Another screamless death. This tiger apparently engulfs the entire head first, then eats his way down. Look, I know a wild cat likes to go for the neck alot, but there is still time for a scream, No. seriously.
-""No no. The tiger is just hungry."". Holy crap, kid! He's chowed down on about five or six people at this point...in like three or four days! That's like 250 pounds of meat at least. This cat is either  bulimic or has an off-the-scale metabolism.
- Not sure i can make it. Another screamless kill. This tiger is not just hungry, he's totally blood-thirsty. Yep. Tigers are like that.
-Blood thirsty tiger ignores running, screaming little boy. At least the tiger has the sense to not totally alienate the audience. That or he's just too darned good to pluck such low-hanging fruit.
Okay....can't do this any more. Going to fast forward to the end. If they blow the tiger up, I will have lost faith in humanity completely.

Major spoiler...I have lost faith in humanity. Going to go sit on the porch and watch the birds.

The Maneater series is a pretty crazy one as it pits natures beats [real and not so much] against man. Usually they kill off man easily until the end where the lead takes them on and some how comes out on top. This movie starring Gary Busey was based on the novel ""Shikar"" by Jack Warner, and the movie also has a cool cover. I don't know why I needed to say that but I like the cover for this one.

An escaped Bengal tiger terrorizes a small town by hunting and killing of the townsfolk and the authorities that are after him. Turns out that some kid has a weird connection to the tiger as it comes by his house at night and watches him from the window, never attacks but just watches. The Sheriff of the town played by Busey is on the hunt and calls in the National Guard to help out. But as the body count rises and pieces are found every where it seems only a pro tiger hunter can make things right.

I have to say this is actually one of the better films in the series with Busey's eccentric facial expressions and a pretty good story. It is still your usual SyFy low budget movie but it is just done well in my opinion. Ty Wood is really good as the kid obsessed with the tiger, you may remember him from ""A Haunting in Connecticut"". Ian D. Clark as well is good here as the big game hunter looking to make up for a mistake in the past. There is also a super funny moment in which Busey answers a reporters question, you will know it when you see it.

The writer here and the director did a pretty good job here as the film always is entertaining. Also I kinda liked that they shot the movie with a real tiger instead of a CGI one. Sure that may take away from the kills a little but for me it worked so I applaud them for doing it. I think this was a really good movie and better than most of the made for TV SyFy stuff we normally see. I say check it out because it may surprise you, I am not saying you will like it as much as me but still.",1318550400,,1959,3.989795918367347

3221660,2,B000WMFZII,"It's easy to become jaded about monster-of-the-week movies when you watch as many as I have as quickly as I have (sometimes, two a night). The routine is so familiar that I can plot the film out without watching: recluse disappears, mutilated corpse appears, innocents somehow blunder through without being eaten, military types arrogantly blunder in and get eaten, a professional monster-killer arrives, the beast's weakness is discovered, and then the monster is blown up in a climactic showdown.

Maneater hits every one of these notes without skipping a beat.  It throws in Gary Busey as a sheriff (Grady Barnes) in an ill-fitting suit, a British hunter out of a 1850s novel complete with victrola and tent (Ian D. Clark as Colonel Graham), and a God-fearing kid (Ty Wood as Roy Satterly) who has some bizarre connection to the beast in question.

In a Rubegoldbergian series of events, Roy blunders out into the street while sleepwalking, which causes a truck to flip, releasing its contents. And those contents are a black market tiger. Director Gary Yates is quite fond of this very first blue lit encounter, with a sleepwalking boy staring down at the reclining tiger, the shattered truck between them. He likes it so much he plays it a few times.

What is supposed to be a thriller turns into a heartwarming tale of a boy and his tiger. Roy keeps equating the tiger with Biblical tales told by his provincial mother, who forbids him from watching television. Soon he's talking to it, convinced that the tiger is his friend.

Fortunately, Maneater isn't going to let him off the hook so easily. What's refreshing about the film is that it has no easy gore shots to fall back on, just a real-life tiger.  The actors have to act and the writer has to actually write dialogue, because the majority of the kills take place off camera. Colonel Graham narrates each kill in a flashback, explaining how the tiger outwits its foes. The tiger has no supernatural abilities to get it out of a jam.  It's just a cunning beast.

With its austere setup, unobtrusive score, and meandering dialogue, Maneater is surprisingly pedestrian. But that's still a cut above some of the awful tripe that comes out of RHI Entertainment.",1287446400,,2219,4.821052631578947

A top flight actor  like Gary Busey is lost in the movie - in maneater territory, he walks around in a too tight suit and no firearms.  His hairpiece is a mess and distracting.  COL Graham's part could have been so much better done - he comes off as a somewhat supercilious fuddy-duddy completely lacking in common sense.  Again, no one with an iota of  common sense in maneater territory pitches their tent in the middle of a clearing while brewing tea and listening to classical music (a la Out of Africa) and having laundry hung out to dry.  The back ground music is awful.  The relationship between Roy and the tiger, as well as that between Roy and the Colonel is not explored at all.
I suggest a remake more along the lines of Ghost and the Darkness.

3221663,4,B000WMFZII,"""Maneater"" is a made for TV movie about a tiger loose in the woods of Appalachia. The film is highly derivative of earlier films in the genre (notably ""Jaws"") but is actually better than most of the other comparable films. Understand that this isn't Academy Award fodder, but for a low budget horror movie, it works and is enjoyable to watch.

The film begins with several gruesome killings in the woods surrounding a small town. A local vet quickly examines the bite radius of the cast made from a victim's torso as being from a Bengal tiger. If that wasn't enough of a homage to ""Jaws"", the mayor also pleads that the sheriff not interrupt the ""Corn and Apple Fest"" due to concerns about the ravenous tiger. Gary Busey plays the sheriff, and exceeded my expectations, though he still has that kooky patina that makes him so interesting to watch. The tiger likes one boy (Ty Wood) who lives in a trailer, and therein begins the weird, mystical tiger-whisperer subplot that runs throughout the movie. Also making a peculiar entrance is Ian D. Clark as a Punjab tiger hunter. This at first struck me as utterly pointless, but actually his performance was one of the true highlights of the movie.

Needless to say, the carnage must continue for the film to work, and feeding grist into the mill is the Army National Guard, who show up with an arrogant smirk on their faces that doesn't last long. Aaron Hughes plays Sgt. Howe, and has a terrible accent that detracts from the generally good performances surrounding him. Fear not, his contingent is not part of the story for long. Throughout the film there are numerous confrontations with the press, and by the end I was praying that the Channel 8 Action News reporter could be eaten, preferably in slow motion, two or three times. Like the actual media, she was that annoying.

The film concludes with its final homage to ""Jaws"", an impossible gunshot to a tank of compressed gas. I was extremely amused despite the obvious derivation of the scene. The end of the film ties up several loose ends in a predictable, yet improbable manner, but seeing Gary Busey getting chased by a tiger was worth the price of the DVD by itself!

The film is a fine examle of contemporary B-cinema, and is one of the better made for TV creature-run-amok films I have seen; the cat is beautiful, the acting is good, the story is well-paced, and the price is right. What else could you want?",1258156800,6,2420,4.634032634032634

3221665,4,B000WMFZII,"Here's an enjoyable piece of nonsense from the Sci-Fi Channel's ""Maneater"" series, a modern updating of the classic ""Nature Strikes Back"" subgenre of horror films.  In Maneater, a tiger is loose in the woods surrounding a small community where Gary Busey is sheriff.  It goes about hunting and killing and making the townspeople dreadfully uneasy.  What's even worse is that the damn tiger is a threat to the success of the annual Apple and Corn Fest.  There's also a boy who lives with his religious zealot of a mother that seems to have a kind of friendship with the tiger.  It's even hinted that he might have some slight psychic connection with the beast.  A British tiger hunter and the National Guard show up to kill the tiger, but since Busey is the star of the film, we're all pretty sure that in the end it'll be him in the final face off with the tiger.
I gave this movie a high rating of four stars.  It might be a tad too much, but three seemed too low.  It's not one you'll be wanting to watch frequently or purchase, but it's good popcorn entertainment.  It's got a bit of gore, but this is mostly aftermath stuff like big pools of blood, body parts and eviscerated corpses lying around.  Not much as far as actual animal attack scenes go.  And they use a real tiger!!  No CGI junk here, no sir!  It actually looks like an animal instead of a friggin' video game!  The cast is decent enough, though the script doesn't ask a lot from them.  Busey is his cool, kooky self.  He's a bit more ""normal"", but has a few funny lines here and there.  I will say the guy gets creepier looking as he gets older.  It's a performance on par with his portrayal of the Gingerdead Man(that was an attempt at humor, but it probably just sounds dumb).
No real complaints about the film coz it is what you'd expect a film like this to be, and as long as it meets expectations, it can't really disappoint.  My only complaint would be the tiger/child connection.  It's unnecessary, cliched and lame.  Thankfully is isn't expanded on too much.

3221667,5,B000WMFZII,"Part of a series of low budget films of animals gone amok that aired on the Sci Fi channel, this film is surprisingly good. For me, the main selling point was that we have an escaped Bengal tiger running amok in Appalachia and fighting with Gary Busey. What more do you need right there, I mean really?

Okay, so the plot really isn't all that complicated, essentially being yet another variant on every other 'animals run amok' movie since Jaws. Nonetheless, its quite enjoyable for such a cheesy flick (and they have a real tiger in it!). Ummm... you've got a Bengal tiger. And he escapes and starts picking off people in rural Appalachia. Gary Busey is the sheriff trying to stop it. Media frenzy ensues (complete with some reporter chick named 'Casey Couric,' lol). The army comes to hunt down the tiger, only to get eaten one by one (as highly trained and heavily armed soldiers are appearantly won't to do if movie logic teaches us anything). And a random British big game hunter, inspired by Jim Corbett, shows up to save the day.

Overall, its much better than you'd expect from a made for TV 'animal attack of the week' type movie. Sure, its kind of goofy at times. I mean, you could expect as much from the description on the box. But its also a fun movie, especially if its late at night or your just hanging out with your friends and want a straight out animal/monster attack movie. No complex plot, no surpise endings, just a regular animal going on a rampage. And the best part?

Most of these low budget animal-gone-wild-killing-people movies are very predictable, and much of this movie is highly derivative of Jaws.

An example was when the mayor gets upset about possibly losing the next election because of what was going on and one of the deputies deadpans that two of the dead weren't voters. And Ian Clark is superb as the experienced British tiger hunter. But what makes the movie different from so many others of the genre is the role played by Ty Wood.  While Tony the Tiger seems intent on eating everyone else, Roy seems to connect with the tiger.  There is a wonderful scene with Col. Jim and Roy discussing tigers.
