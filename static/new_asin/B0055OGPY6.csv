8458509,5,B0055OGPY6,"I bought this DVD for my brother-in-law for Christmas who is a combination of Tim the Tool Man and MacGyver.  He and his adult sons (also handymen) watched it so many times that my sister now calls the DVD ""Seseme Street for Big Boys.""  I highly recommend this DVD for everyone--men and women because it is very informative and makes you think about all the gadgets that have made our lives easier and made me wonder why I didn't patent some of those ideas.",1326067200,3,457,4.428571428571429
