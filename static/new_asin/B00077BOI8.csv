8045515,5,B00077BOI8,"Traci Lords is a female cop acting as a prey in catching a serial killer of beautiful women after office hours.  This movie reminds me two things at once.  Firstly, the New York news of a postman caught in the 1970's as a serial killer. Sam 44 in jail because State of  New York offers no death penalty.  Secondly, she was a porn-star best known for starting it underage.

Well, she certainly left her hard core film career.  This movie is fit for family watching.",1496016000,,464,4.4

8045518,1,B00077BOI8,"The only reason to watch ""Laser Moon"" is to see Traci Lords in a traditional movie. I admire that she had the internal drive to put her past behind her and try to make it in mainstream films, and she is far from the worst actor or actress here, but she cannot save this predictable and tawdry mess. Perhaps the worst thing you can ever say about a suspense movie is that it's boring, but ""Laser Moon"" made me wonder exactly when anything was going to happen. The film opens with a shower scene while talk show host Zane Wolf (Harrison Le Duke) drones on and on (and on and on) about relationships in the middle of the night. This makes up a huge percentage of the running time of this film, and watching an audible medium does not make for suspense, but for tedium. Wolf is pretentious and annoying, but is also not the worst actor in the film.

To the dulcet sounds of Wolf blathering on, a crazed lunatic kills the showering woman (the first of his victims) with a precision surgical laser weapon to the head. You'd think with an MO like that this would be a fast crime spree to solve. You'd, of course, be wrong. During an episode of ""Zane All Night"" (""Folks, we're talking about fantasies tonight...we're talking about panties!"") a guy calls in to discuss his murder fantasy and the cops take notice. It turns out that Traci Lords is Barbara Fleck, rookie cop, whose vacation was interrupted to partner up with a misogynistic screamer of a partner, Detective Musso (Bruce Carter in his only credited role, and who is the worst actor in the film), who acts as an annoying and unnecessary foil whose only real purpose is to prove that Barbara is overcoming all odds despite having relatives in high places. Whatever. The best actor and most likeable character in the film is Bob, Zane's cat (played by Bob the Cat), who ends up being significant to the story. Of course the killer begins calling Zane and the police tell him to elicit information on the air, which he tries to do, the one problem being that Zane is an absolutely terrible interviewer.

Late in the running time there is a tacked on subplot introduced about Zane's divorce and his wife being a general naughty person. There's a ridiculous last minute plot twist and I bet you can never guess where the final showdown occurs. Obviously Barbara is the heroine and saves the day as the cleverest of the characters (despite her apparent inability to fry eggs...don't ask).

The biggest downfall of this film is in no way Traci Lords, it's the ponderous story and direction from writer and director Douglas K. Grimm. The dialogue is stunningly leaden; my favorite is a pointless and atrocious monologue about grocery bags that just boggles the mind (""Paper or plastic? I just don't know anymore...."")

""Laser Moon"" is a film to avoid unless you are a severe insomniac, at which point it can be considered palliative care.",1445644800,3,2884,4.615984405458089

She is the only former porn star to have crossed over into doing regular movies.  She is only going to get better believe me!  This movie is only the beginning, her beauty and her drive to be better will bring her the success that she truly deserves, I love you Traci!  hang in there, I am a true fan!",1030060800,11,399,4.076923076923077
8045521,1,B00077BOI8,"Everyone who puts down Anna Nicole Smith as a bad actress should check out this dismal attempt at entertainment. The infamous Traci Lords was a celebrity overnight when it was discovered she was an underaged porn queen. Since then she's made albums, movies, and oh yeah one more porn flick, 'Traci I love you'.
The only good thing one can say about Laser Moon is that it does end. Traci looks like she's on downers throughout the entire movie. Her eyes are never more than three quarters open, she....talks....so .....slow, and without a hint of what's going on, in the movie or in her life. The dialog is so forced, you'd swear she crams every scene to memorize lines that mean nothing to her. In the 'chase' scene, she's on foot chasing the sex offender. It's so cut up that anyone can tell that Traci never took more than two steps at a time. Plus her gun keeps changing hands, she couldn't even get that right between takes. This movie is the result of another no talent bimbo who refuses to get a real job, and milk her waning popularity for all it's worth.",1010966400,,1062,4.479381443298969
