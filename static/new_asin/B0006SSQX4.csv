8042773,5,B0006SSQX4,"In episode 5 on the Hanaukyo Maid Team, Vol. 2: Lost in Kamakura DVD, Mariel cosplaying, or dressing up in costume, as Chii (Chi) from Chobits is an inside joke regarding Rie Tanaka, the Japanese voice actor (seiyuu) who voices both Mariel in Hanaukyo Maid Team and Chii in Chobits. Rie Tanaka shows off her range and versatility by playing some of the nicest, sweetest, gentlest, kindest characters in animation (Mariel, Chii, Lacus Clyne in Gundam Seed & Gundam Seed Destiny, Ren Mikihara in Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu, Hikari Kujou / Shiny Luminous in Futari wa Pretty Cure Max Heart, etc.) to some of the meanest, nastiest, angriest, bitchiest characters in animation (Suigintou in Rozen Maiden & Rozen Maiden Traumend, Tomoe Marguerite in Mai-Otome / My-Otome, Morganna in .hack//SIGN, Hiroko Matsukata in Hataraki Man / Hatarakiman, Isabella in Soukou no Strain, etc.), and by playing lead heroines to arch villains.",1164153600,,921,5.1466666666666665
