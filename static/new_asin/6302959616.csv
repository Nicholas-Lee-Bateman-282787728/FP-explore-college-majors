7833399,4,6302959616,"Both of these films are good early Hitchcock, but Saboteur is a slower, more character-driven drama in the same vein as The 39 Steps, with just a touch of Suspicion thrown in. Sylvia Sidney turns in a great performance as a woman who only thought she knew her husband.  The Man Who Knew Too Much (1935) is a fast-paced, witty film with an emphasis on action and suspense, and for my money (not much in this particular case) is miles ahead of the 50's remake in every way except for the cast. Still, any movie with Peter Lorre as a primary villain is going to hold my interest. If you enjoy The Lady Vanishes by Hitch, you'll love this movie, too.  From a technical standpoint, the quality of these tapes is not very good, so deduct a star if you are demanding in viewing public domain-style VHS. But they are watchable, and hey, you'll save some ching.",988848000,,852,4.420382165605096
