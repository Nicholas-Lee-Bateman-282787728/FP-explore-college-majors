1995702,5,B0001F6KLC,"ITs about time that Queer life is celebrated!  I own ""Queer As Folk Seasons 1-3"" and its the best showtime series I have ever seen!  All 3 seasons so far have drama, romance, lust; and each season makes you want more!  I became hooked instantly; having watched every season atleast five times!
At first, I was worried, seeing that I never watched the series before buying them.  I jumped with both feet and bought all three at once.  I Definitely, 100% not disappointed!  The drama and the complications in the series between queer friendship, love, devotion, pride and honor is the best I have ever seen in any gay portrayed series!
Queer as folk shows all aspects of Queer life!  The love between Justin and Brian, Mikey and Ben, Ted and Emmett, Lindsay and Melanie; and many other characters brings this series to a new level.  Showing the honest view of gay life. I feel for every character, and care for each person and their lives, as it unfolds.  Words can't express this series other than its a must see and definitely MUST OWN collection!
At times, this series will show sex and nudity, so its not for the faint at heart.  But thats what makes this series even more special.  The fact that nothings held back; in your face truthfulness of gay relationships!  Its awesome!
If you never watched Queer as folk, I recommend to everyone they should!  I cant wait to own Season four!",1086998400,9,1386,4.585365853658536
1995703,5,B0001F6KLC,"When ""Queer As Folk"" debuted on Showtime in 2000, it immediately sparked controversy, raising many eyebrows.  Its unique graphic visionaries of sexuality has kept many talking.  Not because of the sexual theme itself; it's the sexuality between two members of the same sex.  The ""in-your-face"" effect earns the brave cast and crew tremendous respect for doing what no other has successfully done before.  Before its debut, only two sitcoms have explored sexual orientation extensively: ""Ellen"" and ""Will And Grace"".  The brilliance and the success of ""Queer As Folk"" has since earned rave reviews by many critics and still is today.  Since its debut, the show has won and been nominated for several awards, including three, and counting, consecutive GLAAD Award nominations for Outstanding TV Drama.
The variey of character personalities offers great plot variety.  Brian's frequent sexual activity, Michael's homelike presence, Emmitt's flamboyance, and Ted's shyness are only some traits that offer such joy to audiences.  Justin, Debbie, Mel, Lindsay, and Ben also offer their own unique presence.  The acting offers more great additional entertainment value.  New and interesting ideas always keep audiences awaiting for the next episode.  The combination of realism, drama, and slight comedy offers issues that some viewers can relate, including the straight/ ally community.  Besides GLBT issues and struggles, it explores drug use, HIV/ AIDS, hate crimes, pornography, and many others.  The shock value offers a great unforgettable experience.  As the seasons progress, the plot and the characters follow.
Season one, the season always to be watched first, explores the coming out process, struggles in high school, struggles in the workplace, same sex couples raising a child, and others.  Those who haven't watched the show will witness Justin meeting Brian for the first time, Lindsay giving birth to Gus (Brian is the father), Justin coming out for the first time, and of course Brian being Brian.  Such deep chain of events and many others lead to a surprising and shocking season finale that keeps audiences awaiting for the second season premiere episode.
Season two starts with the result of the traumatic event on last season's finale.  The characters begin evolving more throughout this season.  Some surprising turn of events keep audiences interested in every detail.  New viewers will witness Michael and Ted beginning their dream jobs, Michael meeting Ben who is HIV-positive, the birth of ""Rage"", Justin beginning college, Brian admitting more of his love for Justin, and of course Brian still being Brian.  Viewers will be shocked when they learn Debbie's weak spot, despite being a strong GLBT ally.  Robert Gant makes a wonderful debut as Ben.  The acting from everyong shows great improvement throughout this season.  Everyone creates their own tactics to keep audience watching.  The chain of events, and many others, lead to a great season finale, leading to season three.
Season three answers questions that were cliffhanged in the second season finale.  This season shows a greater variey of expressed issues, some which have not been expressed before, including politics, hustling, drug abuse, and others.  This shows a greater emphasis on HIV/ AIDS issues, especially when Ben and Michael help a young hustler and when Ben's ex-boyfriend/friend dies of AIDS.  This season shows surprising revolutions of some characters: an unlikely town hero arises to prevent a town from being run by a homophobic mayor candidate, an unlikely person becomes a crystal meth addict, and others.  The chain of events and others lead to a shocking season finale that keeps audiences awaiting for season four.
This ""Queer As Folk"" set is a great collecion item for fans.  This is sure to keep audiences entertained for a long time.  First time viewers must watch this edition in order.  Otherwise, the chain of events will be confusing.
Cast: Gale Howard (Brian), Hal Sparks (Michael), Randy Harrison (Justin), Peter Paige (Emmitt), Scott Lowell (Ted), Robert Gant (Ben), Michelle Clunie (Mel), Thea Gill (Lindsay), and Sharon Gless (Debbie).",1084665600,11,4154,5.334869431643625
1995704,5,B0001F6KLC,"Queer As Folk is one of the most amazing TV Shows ever and is a landmark as the show for the new millennium. This amazing Box Set has Season 1,2, and 3. After three seasons I am still amazed at how honest this show is on dealing with gay life. Not every gay person lives a life like these guys, but that is not what this show is about. Queer As Folk ia about the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. Queer As Folk makes no apologies and thats what is so great about this series. From the graphic sex scenes to the drama of dealing with the prejudice that still haunts America, this show is so brave and I give Showtime a big thumbs up for having the balls to take on such a big risk as Queer As Folk. This show is as close as it gets to real life. This is not a show just for gay people, but for ALL people. It deals with human emotion and thats something that we can all relate to whether we be straight, gay, bisexual, black, white, brown or in between. I encourage anyone who has a open mind and a open heart to BUY this amazing DVD collection as it will inspire you and if nothing else open your mind to a lifestyle not as uncommon as you may think. Watch more than one episode before you judge this amazing series. With season 1, 2, and 3 you will be entertained with this awesome show for more than a few days!
Queer As Folk The Complete First Season - The first Queer As Folk DVD Box Set has all 22 episodes of the first season of the most controversial and bravest series in the history of television. The total running time of all 6 DVD's is approx: 1,205 minutes which includes Bonus features such as: behind the scenes outtakes, deleted scenes, special edition episodes, a Photo Gallery, DVD rom extras, A 6 minute Season 2 Sneek Peek, and much more. Queer As Folk shows the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh and all the dramas that go on in each of their lives.
Queer As Folk The Complete Second Season -  The DVD Box Set is over 900 minutes and has all 20 episodes of the second season of one of the most controversial television shows today. The BOX SET includes over 3 hours of Bonus features such as: behind the scenes outtakes, deleted scenes, special edition episodes, a Photo Gallery, DVD rom extras, and much more. Queer As Folk shows the life of a group of gay guys and a lesbian couple living in Pittsburgh. I feel the first season of QUEER AS FOLK is better, but this second season is very good as well and shows the growth of the characters. I have seen all 20 episodes of Season 2 and it is slower paced than the first season, and I sometimes find myself looking at my watch which rarely ever happened with season 1.
Queer As Folk The Complete Third Season - This New Queer As Folk Season 3 DVD Box Set is over 673 minutes and has all 14 episodes of the third season, which is still one of the most controversial and bravest series on television today. This BOX SET like the seasons before include over 3 hours of Bonus features such as: Behind-the-camera, Hot Summer Days, Wrap Party Reel, Enter Babylon LA, Meet the Folks, Animated Photo Gallery, Season Four Sneak Preview, Weblink, Music Videos, and a few other surprises. I have seen all 14 episodes of Season 3 and it is another great season with some major twists. Season 3 is also a step above season 2 which was a little drawn out when compared to season 1. I do have to say I am a little upset that this season is very short when compared to season 1 and 2, which both had about 7 or 8 more episodes, but either way it is still a good season. Can't wait till the new Season 4 starts on Showtime soon.",1077148800,61,3654,4.190340909090909
8011686,5,B0001F6KLC,"This show is amazingly outstanding. It's definitely ""in-your-face"" and not for the weak-of-heart or close-minded. It's a series based on the queer community living in Pittsburgh mixed with humor, emotion, and enough eye candy that would make even Wonka's Oompa Loompa's hard. The actors on this show are completely amazing. Each one of them is superbly cast for the roles they take on. Two of my favorite actors on the show are actually both females. Michelle Clunie, who plays a lesbian lawyer (in a 8-year relationship with her partner, Lindsay) outstandingly. And the second, Sharon Gless, the heterosexual mother who can be seen as wanting to be a gay man herself. The show makes no apologies (most notably in Brian Kinney played by Gale Harold) to anyone for the contents of the show and its portrayal of gay life.

SEASON ONE:

This season lays all the groundwork for the seasons to follow. It doesn't truly explain where the characters came from but it does enough that you can guess, and you'd guess correctly. The bonus materials are truly awesome to watch and these episodes are much more than a ""one time"" view. Each are so good in their own right that you'll keep watching them over and over again. The show is based around 8 people, four queers, two dykes, and a partridge in a pear tree...I mean, and a loving mother.

So, that's Michael (shy, coy, boy-next-door type who has an insatiable crush on his best friend, Brian), Brian (no regrets, no remorse, no emotion club boy who sleeps around with everyone because, well, everyone wants to sleep with him), Ted (the depressed-Eeyore-type of the group who's always feeling sorry for himself; also the oldest of the group), and Emmett (the flamboyant and proud queen). There's also Melanie and Lindsay (two loveable lesbians who've been together since before the internet was invented) and Debbie (Michael's mother who works at the Liberty Diner where everyone eats, a proud and loud mother of a gay son and gay brother). Lastly, there's Justin, Brian's one-night-stand who just so happens to be a minor and a virgin who latches on to him like a leech. But Justin knows how to work Brian and soon the pair become, well, a pair (though Brian will forever deny it).

SEASON TWO:

After Justin's bashing in last season's finale, a lot has changed. Brian has to cope with the fact that he's actually having some emotions for Justin, while Justin has to cope with the fact that he may never be able to draw again. After leaving everyone to go live with Dr. David, Michael breaks things off and has to come back to Pittsburgh feeling left out and in last place. Everyone's moved on with their lives and Michael seems he's been left behind. The rest, I'll leave for you to watch the show...

SEASON THREE:

The first of the last seasons to feature almost half of the episodes of what the prior seasons had this season featured the continuance of Brian and Justin's ""break up"" and ""make up,"" Ben and Michael's love story, Ted and Emmett's romance, and much more.",1119830400,2,3016,4.733333333333333
8011687,3,B0001F6KLC,"Hi. I love QAF. I bought seasons 1 - 4 on eBay. Unfortunately, I'm hearing impaired and the shows aren't closed captioned. I get so frustrated when the powers that be who release DVDs, don't take their hard-of-hearing and deaf viewers into consideration. I use a headphone when watching, but I still miss a lot of what is said, especially during the Babylon scenes.

QAF's going off the air will leave a big gaping hole in my heart.

I will miss so many great characters.

Brian - who wouldn't love him? Yes, he is a control freak who tries to run -- and sometimes inadvertently ruins -- his friends' lives (esp. Mikie, Lindsay, and Justin)and conform them to his way of thinking. Yes, he can be a heartless bitch of a slut who treats Justin and Michael so callously. But, as with many other seemingly cruel characters, he has a heart of gold that he hides with a ferocity. Make no mistake - he loves his friends and is like a lioness protecting the cubs.

Michael - forever in love with the unattainable Brian. Ironically, Brian feels Michael is ""off limits"" as well, so there is always that sexual tension between them. During the course of the show he grows up and stops whining so darn much. I loved how he rushed to the hospital and silently supported the devastated Brian after Justin was almost killed. It shows he is maturing -- after all, he was at the airport when Brian called and immediately canceled his frantic, last-minute trip to Portland for him. The scene where he rescues Justin having a panic attack (during his first venture outside after being bashed) is just indicative of what a loving and caring person he is.

Justin - while his good looks pretty much left me cold at first, I grew to love his bravado and perseverance. It's so fitting that he becomes one of Deb's favorite people. He's so ""in your face"" about demanding common courtesy and respect for gay people. Yeah, he's a fictional character, but the world could use a lot more REAL Justins, Brians, Mels, Daphnes, and Debs. It's also heartbreaking watching him unable to remember the bashing incident, yet reacting predictably with fear to people touching him. It's also sweet that despite the fact that he's the one who received the head injury, he accurately perceives it was Brian who suffered the most damage by the incident.

Emmett - so worldly, yet naive and so adorable. He is just as protective of his friends as Brian. He is a caregiver in need of one of his own. I loved how he fell in love with George despite the great age difference.

Mel - I just love the combo of her vulnerability and toughness. She is one of Brian's worst critics (like Deb). On the other hand, she loves him for his fierce loyalty (esp. to her, Lindsay, Justin, & Michael) and like him, she exacts swift judgement and/or justice upon their friends' enemies. I thought it was so touching how she and Lindsay took Justin under their sweet, angelic wings and defended him against Brian, while trying to convince Brian he really loves Justin.

Daphne - what a little sweetheart. I just love her. She is everything a best friend should be to someone like Justin. I felt so bad for her when she fell in love with Justin, knowing full well she would never have him.

Ben - I would fall in love with someone like him in a heartbeat. He is just so manly, handsome, and vulnerable. (And, the guy who plays him is gay in real life.) I really liked Mikie's doctor boyfriend, too, but not nearly as much as Ben.

The crazy Deb (how could someone not love her). Much as I love my Mom, Sharon Gless' Deb is my ideal of a mom. Brian and Mel pale in comparison when it comes to this fierce She-Beast. Despite wanting to protect her son and her ""Sunshine"" from Brian, she wants to protect HIM as well -- frustrated as she is by the big, protective wall he's constructed around himself over the years.

My silly sentimental heart will heal and I will have the memories (not to mention reruns). After all, my heart has been broken by ""Sex and the City,"" ""The Golden Girls,"" ""The X Files,"" ""Friends,"" ""Seinfeld,"" ""Soap,"" ""The Carol Burnett Show"" and ""Dark Shadows"". Another shock to my poor long-suffering heart was ""Everybody Loves Raymond"" also went to rerun heaven, along with the late Peter Boyle [Frank ""Holy Crap"" Barone].  :(

The reason I gave this 3 stars as opposed to 5 is that 1) it's not closed-captioned and 2) as others have complained there is a tracking problem with several of the disks -- several of the episodes end abruptly or freeze in the middle and nothing I do will get the !@#$% things to completely play.",1115942400,2,4579,4.5290556900726395
8011688,5,B0001F6KLC,"Wow! What more can you say about this show? Wow its so shocking, wow its so different, wow its so addictive and wow Brian and Justin are so hot.

Queer as folk has quickly become my new favourite show...and im guessing it will remain so for a long time. So far no show has been able to reach me and intrigue me as much as this one. Whether im crying over the injustice in some storylines, feeling proud of the characters in others....or down right frustrated at where Brian and Justin's ""relationship"" is headed - there is nothing more fascinatingly brilliant that i would want to watch.

I own the box sets for the first three seasons and i have already ordered season 4. The show isn't very well advertised here in Australia...in fact it isn't advertised at all. So i cant believe how lucky i was to be channel surfing one night recently. I only saw the last 2 episodes of season 4 on tv and i knew i had to buy the boxsets for all the seasons. Never regretted it for a second...best buy of my life. The episodes are all amazing...and the incredible special features are just an added bonus. There are cast commentaries and all sorts of ""behind the scenes"" features.

This is a box set for everyone both gay and straight.

BRING ON SEASON 5!!!",1112140800,6,1245,4.4
8011689,5,B0001F6KLC,"I only have the first season on DVD (due to lack of funds) but have watched EVERY episode on Showtime.  It's not the usual type of show I watch but the stories and characters are soooo captivating; I've laughed and cried so many times watching. Sharon Gless, ""Debbie"", should win some type of award every year--her character is brilliant and she plays it so well.  On occasion, I can even get my husband to watch and he thinks the story lines are good too. (He gets a kick out of Emmit)  This, by far, is my favorite show and I will continue saving my pennies to get all the seasons :)",1106870400,8,585,4.252252252252252

Watch this show -- you will laugh, you will cry, you will scream, and you will smile (at least once per episode) guarunteed. If you want to be entertained indefinately, buy the best show on television. Queer as Folk is the most fun you've had in years",1105660800,9,383,4.565217391304348
8011691,5,B0001F6KLC,"I have only recently acquired this 3-season set (in Nov 2004) after reading much about it (solely) in the web. Based on the mixed reviews QAF123 received, I decided to order it to watch it for myself. Did not know whether or not it was a good idea at the time since it would cost me quite a sum. I hesitated for months before I eventually gave in to temptation and just bought it. It did not matter anymore how much (financial) damage it would cost me.

But guess what, I was not disappointed at all. QAF123 was a pleasure to watch and I immediately fell in love with it. The characters were very well-played, they can be sometimes funny, sometimes sad, the soundtrack was great, the directing, very adventurous. Overall, QAF123 is well worth watching. Although I cannot really relate to the characters, I find QAF123 really entertaining and well... very addictive.

I must also confess that Gale Harold is absolutely beautiful... cannot seem to get enough of him. His Brian Kinney character is really complex and intense but he pulled it off with flying colours. Gale's performance is really top notch, nuff said. In fact, all the other casts were terrific too.

I cannot wait for QAF4's official DVD release and I cannot  wait for Season 5 as well. Hopefully, QAF will continue for many more seasons to come although that may well be just wishful thinking on my part. Nothing goes on forever but I will make sure I acquire every available QAF season there is. It's a real collector's item.

For your info, I am a straight female and I love Queer As Folk... totally. If you are into something queer, both funny and dramatic at the same time, excellent soundtrack, great acting and directing, then you should consider getting the QAF DVDs... you won't regret it. I am gonna purchase the QAF soundtrack on CD next. Cannot wait to get it!

8011692,5,B0001F6KLC,"Brian Kinney is one of four or five main characters in Queer As Folk. Another character...a psychiatrist...tells Brian: ""For someone with enough disorders to merit your own classification in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual, you are one of the most well-adjusted and high functioning bastards I know.""

Can you resist that? I can't.

I haven't been as obsessed with a work of fiction since I started reading about Francis Crawford of Lymond et Sevigny 'way back in 1969, and for much the same reasons. Brian Kinney, like Lymond, often does the right thing in the cruelest way possible and, like Lymond, is most dangerous when he feels most. Like Lymond, I find him endlessly fascinating...proving that you don't have to be young and/or homosexual to be seduced by this show.

Besides Brian, the overall level of writing and plot is generally high although, as I suppose is inevitable, not every episode strikes home. Enough do, though, to put Queer As Folk on a level by itself. njs",1093305600,17,987,4.8982035928143715
