2817365,3,B000PE0GXM,"PANDEMIC is a timely reminder of how one case of a highly infectious disease can spread with rapidity through our highly mobile world.  Director Armand Mastroani pulls the viewer into the byzantine world of how the Center for Disease Control would confront a nightmare come true. A teenage boy returns from Australia carrying a fatal illness and gets sick on a plane headed for Los Angeles.  He dies en route so the plane's passengers are immediately quarrantined.  Up to this point, we feel both sympathy and empathy for the stricken.  But then the plot takes the first in a series of detours solely to generate what the director feels might be lacking should the film depend solely on the plague to retain audience involvement. When the plane's passengers disembark, one might think that the CDC in conjunction with the federal government would ensure that all the passengers are accounted for.  All too easily, one of them slips away to wreak havoc on the general population. A further incredible plot complication lies in that one of the passengers is a big time criminal handcuffed to an FBI agent.  A paramilitary squad of terrorists attack the hospital where their boss is being held and they free him. Such digressions dilute the impact of what should be sufficiently involving. Still, the action moves quickly and all too often tragically from scene to scene.  There are vignettes of truckloads of wrapped bodies being dumped into communal graves for incineration. It is entirely believable that except for the digressions a plague just like this one could escape to decimate an urban population.  We are scared as we watch it and that I think was the point.",1244851200,2,1667,4.907473309608541
2817366,4,B000PE0GXM,Not too bad.... Was entertaining - but some of the subplots were just a tad too improbable for me. I think there should have been more focus on the public's panic.,1187136000,7,163,4.290322580645161
2817407,3,B000PE0GXM,"Rather Soap Opera-y.  I really feel that if your going to make a movie that includes lots of medical people; doctors, nurses, etc., you need to have a good medical consultant on board.  As a nurse I almost choked watching some of the medical scenes.  Watching the attaching of the IV made me squirm with total discomfort (and I am an ICU nurse), intubating a man with the pillow under his head, and this is just basic stuff.  If you can afford to pay those exorbitant salaries to actors  and actresses, cough up a few dollars to get the medical scenes right.",1522886400,,558,4.431372549019608

2817414,5,B000PE0GXM,Arrived on time and in excellent condition. The movie shows just how fast and susceptible we would and are ill prepared we are as a nation. It starts out two friends live all the time a surfers life style one seems to be a little under the weather with a pronounced cough and dies before his friend  dies with what seemed on boarding the plane and is under the weather as well with similar symptoms and shortly into the flight dies as well unpleasantly to. The story progresses into a new strian of a known virus but takes them some time to determine it. In interim becomes spread very quickly into a extremely wide breakout caused in great part a individual sneaking past authorities barriers. In the interim by coughing and the expelleing mucus mainly who what it spreads initially. The story continues and in the process shows you in this production how fast something like this cold happen. Great movie really can endorse this on its based on as acting and over all story line. The seller I also recommend.,1448755200,,1010,4.580110497237569

2817435,4,B000PE0GXM,"The motion picture ""Pandemic"" is a useful look at an effort made to first to detect,diagnose and subsequently contain a outbreak of a virus named ""riptide"".This particular viral attack is something of a mutation of a bird flu. It is potentially a very dangerous and deadly virus. There are some intelligent scenes as when a young man dies on the plane with the pilot  communicating to Los Angeles International the death of this young man. The pilot requests a secure location with then Ground Sources reveal CDC personnel will meet the plane. It is very clear that the entire focus is on how dangerous this disease is. It is at this time when information is now available coming from Australia whereby this young man is now identified with details being provided by Australian health officials. Like I said there are some intelligent scenes which do get your attention. The necessity to be very upfront with the passengers once the CDC boards the plane was useful however everyone should of remained seated through out the entire  time that the young mans body was on board the plane and then and I might repeat myself and only once so ordered by CDC get up from there assigned seats under the CDC's direction. There is a logistical problem which developes and the passengers not being in there seats was a contributing factor. This is how careful this picture attempts to convey a very dangerous situation. It is useful and as stated earlier these scenes get your attention. There is much more to say with the attempt made by first responders being part of a solution that an answer would be less certain than if these men and women were not such an essential element to our peace of mind. The science matters in this film,diagnostic tests and subsequent results matter. When it counts this picture has a responsible story line that will last the picture through. The 4 is indicated because it is here that we take our everyday lives for granted when in fact we really should not. This picture may very well be something of a comment on the everyday and the terrifying evolution of this Viral Outbreak. These scenes as such do not surface as a rule until or unless some rather serious circumstances meet and we as the viewing audience are very much party to the strain and the passing of life extinguished by this disease. It is a phenomena that when death comes upon the living we lose touch with nature. This dreaded encounter with ""riptide"" allows us to know the victims and to know further that it is life that we love and truly know that we must go as ""reptide"" can not wait. The picture can appeal to a sense of faith that if observed not a soul will be lost to the darkness,though every single body will be ultimately be extinguished in the flames of eternity. This  folks does not end anytime soon nor is it planned for it to end anytime soon. The picture makes the effort required  with perhaps only that this time we have been spared a more dangerous encounter with the unknown.""Pandemic"" can be favorably compared to a similar film in ""Contagion"",both films are worthy and both films make for compelling viewing.",1416700800,,3125,4.666061705989111
2817436,5,B000PE0GXM,Great movie. This could really happen.,1415577600,,38,5.5
2817447,5,B000PE0GXM,"Similar to the film ""Outbreak"" in what could be a panic situation regarding a disease where there is no known cure. A good movie to watch to ensure that cleanliness and carefulness prevails with spreading viruses and germs by bodily fluids and airborne microbes.  Great movie.",1407542400,,276,5.0
2817448,5,B000PE0GXM,"This is a good movie, and besides the ""plague"", puts forth the theory of how much politics are involved in any decision affecting

THAT,
and the fact that I just LOVE a-n-y kind of disaster
movie.
I love 'em ALL:
Hurricanes
Tornadoes
Apocalypses
Monsters
Ghouls
Zombies
Aliens
Ex-wives with rabies...
Natural disasters like earthquakes...
Un-natural disasters like marrying a monster from Mars.
Love 'em all... pestilence is ALWAYS a draw with ME...
love a good PLAGUE... a bad one is better!

Yeah buddy (can you tell I just got laid-off?)!

Oh, I like the ones where Jesus shows up and saves the day too...
with --- or without --- Santa Claus!

This one makes you think about washing your hands BEFORE... and
AFTER you, er, uh... urinate.

THIS'll scare IT out of ya!

2817450,4,B000PE0GXM,It's a mixture of a disease epidemic and some bad guys.  It's different because the bad guys are not responsible for the disease or trying a cover-up.  But they do make a creditable threat.,1377216000,,189,4.529411764705882

2817452,4,B000PE0GXM,Really enjoyed watching this movie.  Well made and well acted out.  Shows how easily and quickly a pandemic can occur.,1366156800,,118,4.85
2817453,1,B000PE0GXM,"Based on the mostly positive reviews here on Amazon, I went ahead and purchased this movie.  Unfortunately, this was one of the worst movies I have ever seen.  The premise was really quite promising:  a young man contracts a highly lethal and contagious virus while on a trip to Australia and dies on the flight home to Los Angeles.  The CDC is notified by the pilots and immediate action is taken to quarantine all the other passengers until the CDC can figure out what killed the young man.  During the confusion of offloading the passengers, one eludes the quarantine procedures and gets out into LA to spread the virus to many other people -- and the pandemic quickly becomes unmanageable.

Where the movie really fell apart was in the numerous ridiculous subplots (one involving a drug kingpin, who was also on the flight, and who also escapes quarantine and finds ways to make millions of dollars while the pandemic rages); one involves the son and ex-wife of an FBI agent; and one involves the lead CDC doctor (Tiffani Thiessen) and her beloved niece, who gets infected by the virus (but amazingly recovers, thanks to the brilliance of her aunt).  Some of the acting was just terrible, too, and the solution to the pandemic that is finally achieved is laughable.

I can't believe Faye Dunaway took a role in this lame movie.  She was the best thing about it, but even a pro like her, saddled with clunky dialogue and horrible actors to deal with, couldn't elevate this move above a one-star rating.

Contagion is a vastly superior movie to this in every way (though it was not perfect, it was more believable and intelligent than this).  If you want to see a decent movie about a pandemic, skip this and get Contagion instead.",1325376000,4,1733,4.686468646864687
2817454,5,B000PE0GXM,"First my credentials:
I have degrees in chemistry, biomedical engineering, environmental management, combating WMD's, and have worked in the Army's Chemical, Biological, Radiological, and Nuclear response department for 5 years.

The acting is a bit lacking.  There was nothing that made me cringe outright, but if you hire B+ actors, you get a B+ result.
The science of it, however, was very good.
There are some technical aspects to take issue with: The timeline for the disease got sped up, and they mingled people's jobs somewhat (virologists, epidemiologists, pathologists, and emergency management personnel are distinct jobs, but some of the characters tend to blur the lines).  The military units did not know how to construct a roadblock/checkpoint.
For the most part, however, the movie does an excellent job in describing the difficult decisions and hurdles that would be faced in such a pandemic, and is good debate fodder for discussions on these issues.

For example:
Is it morally acceptable to shoot civilians attempting to break quarantine?
If you have two antiviral drugs, should you give everyone both in hopes that one will work, or should you give one group drug A and another drug B so that you can learn what works?
How much information should the public be told and when? Where is the line between limiting panic and public disclosure?

There is very little out-of character stupidity in the movie.  Yes there are some selfish/paranoid idiots, but I know several people at least as idiotic as anyone in this movie.  The technical inaccuracies are not distracting, and can be attributed to simply making the movie appealing to lay people.

If this is an interest of yours (as it is to me), I suggest watching and taking notes on things you need to decide or wish you knew (for instance, how long does an airplane's oxygen mask supply last?) to respond to these types of things.",1325289600,13,1900,4.971608832807571
2817455,3,B000PE0GXM,"You knew it had to be schlock when the chic from Saved By the Bell and French Stewart are slated to play doctors from the CDC.  Basically a kid returning on a flight from Australia carries a horrible virus on the plane home and dies.  The plane and everyone on it is put into quarantine.  One rogue passenger escapes the quarantine and runs around yapping on his cell phone and spreading the virus to a bunch of other people.  This in turn causes Los Angeles to be quarantined.  There are also some subplots including a drug kingpin prisoner whose crew breaks him out of the quarantine, competing political candidates, and the family drama between agent Vincent Spano, his ex-wife and their son.  The fake virus hilariously named ""riptide"" (in lieu of the fact that the first victim on the plane was a surfer) kills people alot like the avian flu.  There were funny elements to this movie.  The acting is terrible.  It has an ""after school special"" vibe that is totally laughable.  Some of the characters are completely stereotypical and nuts (like the militia guy that keeps b**ching about the government and conspiracy type stuff and riles up a group of his cronies to do something about the whole thing after some people break free from the quarantine).  I did find the idea of taking the dead bodies to the hockey rink kind of clever since it was like mass refrigeration.  I also think as chocked full o' schlock as the movie was, it did try to get its message out about what might happen if a pandemic exploded.  All in all, I watched it for the so bad it's cool to watch reason.  Be sure not to miss Tiffany - Amber Thiessen telling a nurse that ""panic"" is ""pandemic"" with three missing letters - oooohhh geez - totally funny.",1317772800,24,1732,4.54516129032258

8190843,4,B000PE0GXM,"Enjoyable movie. Casting and acting were good. The plot was fairly believable. The pace of the movie was pretty well set. And (shock) we have a happy ending. I recommend it as a way to kill a few hours. My only problem was with the way the writer seemed to throw in every crisis that could be imagined. SPOILER ALERT! Examples: like the FBI agent's son robbing the guy at the ATM, the thing with the alt-right guys, the hijacking the trucks bringing in the medicine and the selling the stolen medicine on the street. Possibly all those things would happen in a real crisis but it stretched credibility a little bit. But like I said it is an enjoyable movie.",1523750400,,657,4.43801652892562
