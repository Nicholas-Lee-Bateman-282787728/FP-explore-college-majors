5752651,5,B00CYQXGMW,"I still have moments where I see Alicia's husband as ""Big"" from Sex and the City...there even tend to be characteristics about his new role that are similar. The show has a great plot line and keeps you guessing what will happen next. An excellent use of each of the characters to keep you from growing bored with the same 4 stars repeating the same drama with only minor changes. I hope it continues to be a great program!",1381363200,,423,4.367088607594937
5752652,5,B00CYQXGMW,"The writers on this show never disappoint!  There is always a twist or two leading to another twist or two. . . . They have set up Season 5 for us--we will have to wait to see what happens. When I think I have it figured out, something unexpected happens.  The new twist with the NSA is a good commentary about what's going on with our phone and email conversations; you just never know who's listening and what will be interpreted!  Did Diane really rat out Will?  Is Alicia rethinking her decision (again!) to go with the others to the new firm?

If you haven't been a rabid fan for the last 4 seasons, stream them or buy the complete seasons and get caught up!  We've been fans since the first season when a friend told us about the series!  We haven't missed a single episode since!  (Thank goodness for DVR!)  These writers are first class!",1381190400,,845,4.365384615384615
5752653,5,B00CYQXGMW,Another amazing season of The Good Wife. Great premiere with an excellent mix of acting and music. Sets up the season well.,1381190400,,123,4.636363636363637
5752654,5,B00CYQXGMW,"I have never enjoyed any of the courtroom or police dramas but this show is interesting and actually exciting. Very intelligently written with characters of some depth. The writers do the continuous background story very well and with each episode a self-contained story with a beginning and usually climactic ending.

This season's first two episodes looks like the show is actually getting better.

In general what I like about the show is its' exploration of liberalism. I mean REAL liberalism and not the Orwellian double-speak of today in which authoritarianism, intolerance, and love of the State is referred to as being ""liberal"". Whether it is feminism, guns, or religion it is presented through the lens of American liberalism. Instead of ""sides"" winning out it seems it is the Individual that is considered the most relevant entity - a complex Human that doesn't just swallow tribal rhetoric then spits out singular agendas. Much self-interest prevents such a thing and the show is unapologetic about this.

It is also fascinating to observe extreme objectivity, I mean ""cut-throat"" at times, and of course the Law is a perfect place to explore this.

It's sort of like the show ""House"" except it is a team of lawyers instead of doctors.",1381104000,5,1247,5.038834951456311
5752655,5,B00CYQXGMW,"Please, review the product, not the delivery.  There is a chance that your computer is at fault and what we all look for is how is the drama, how do you like the show, the performances, the storyline, not whether your computer worked with it!  It is unfair to TGW to give it one star because your volume didn't work.  My opinion of the show is that it is excellent, been looking so forward to it, and was not disappointed!  It is very rare that one program is so consistently enjoyable.",1380758400,45,486,4.3076923076923075
5752656,5,B00CYQXGMW,"The inaugural episode of this season of The Good Wife is worth a play and a re-play for its tightly wound acting and action.  The dramatics are flawless and the script spares not a single word.  Even if you have never seen this series before, I recommend you seeing this episode because it is television drama at its best.  That includes the synchronization of music, so well chosen, as well as the light humor in the robotic tele-commuter.  Kudos all around.",1380499200,66,459,4.62962962962963

5752660,3,B00CYQXGMW,Never seen this show until I started watching it on my Amazon Prime account. I have been binge watching every weekend. The show has been really good until I got to season 5. I can't believe what Alicia did after Will took a chance and hired her.  It may have been explained later in the season why she did it. I just could not stomach watching after a few episodes in season 5.,1517184000,,377,4.164383561643835

Even worse than the loss of Will is the apparent addition of Canning as a full time cast member. Canning is annoying to say the least. Growing tired of the same old thing with Eli, Jackie, Peter and others. Hope to see vast improvements in S6.",1500422400,,377,4.5588235294117645

5752705,5,B00CYQXGMW,"I love this show. I have binge watched the entire series prob 4x over the course of a couple years. The newest season just ended last year, and a lot of times as a show gets age, it begins winding down, but not The Good Wife. It ends just as powerful as it began, and once you watch the series finale, go back and watch the pilot episode again. The first 10 min sequence  of the pilot and the final 10 min of the series, are essentially the same, although the characters have changed. We see the journey that Alicia makes, as the wife of a scandalous politician, from the background to the spotlight and how she learns to use the truth to her advantage. The series is totally believable as so many politicians have been caught up in sexual scandals, had to admit their wrongdoing to the public as their wives stand beside them to protect that ""family"" image so as not to commit career suicide, and if you look at the backgrounds of so many of those wives, they themselves are lawyers. Just look at Bill and Hillary Clinton and John and Elizabeth Edwards. It's sad that in American culture, the ""image"" of the scandalous husband and the educated wife standing by his side, this has become cliche'. Having said all of that, season 5 is not my favorite, but they had to do something to kinda change things up a bit. Alicia decides to join Cary Agos and the other 4th years and open their own firm, Diane and Will are out for blood in revenge, Peter becomes Governor of Illinois, Will is killed by his own client, Alicia starts a friendship with the new A.S.A, Finn Polmar, who tried to save Will's life, and against Diane's wishes, Louis Canning becomes the newest name partner at Lockhart, Gardner, and Canning.  The firm, Florence, Agos and Associates has to open in an old t-shirt factory and is far from the prestigious look of Lockhart Gardner. Some of our favorite guest stars return, but season 5 just doesn't have the cases or momentum of the previous 4 seasons. It fits along with the story lines, and isn't terrible, but isn't as great either. It's definitely worth watching and is necessary to continue to season 6. All in all, The Good Wife is one of my most favorite TV shows.",1486166400,,2186,4.4625

And what a stroke of genius to represent ""Dexter"" in the season finale and to get him off free of all; charges - except for the stolen bubble gum rapper from the bodega in Harlem - wow!

5752817,3,B00CYQXGMW,Now the show is starting to get old. Every episode the attorneys are arguing over each other in a courtroom and a judge has to discipline them like children.

5752920,3,B00CYQXGMW,"This season feels uneven. Perhaps it's because I binged the first third and was slow to watch the rest, but the first third of the season had a rapid pace and kept me hooked. Then things slowed down considerably until a major event in the plot line, after which things evened out. Sadly, this season also had an anti-government storyline that appeared from time to time and was quite offbase and annoying. Without that storyline I might be able to give four stars. The writing is still pretty good this season but I don't think it's quite up to previous seasons.",1483056000,,562,4.574257425742574

5753245,5,B00CYQXGMW,"One of the very best seasons in the Good Wife, with rich character development and compelling narrative arch. Unfortunately, the show went downhill after Season 5, due to the departure of Josh Charles as Will Gardner, who was the central pillar of the show. My most favorite episode in this season was ""Last Call"", which was so beautiful, poignant, and powerful -- this is where you get to see the main actors at their finest, from Julianna Margulies as Alicia, Christine Baranski as Dianne Lockhart, to Archie Punjabi as Kalinda and Zach Grenier as David Lee (note his brief yet incredibly moving scene after hearing about Will's death).",1477612800,,638,4.916666666666667

  To those who claim that the story lines are not ""true-to-life"" - go watch Survivor or Big Brother if you want reality TV! This is fiction and as such should be allowed literary license.  If you don't like fiction, don't watch the show.

The only time I've done that was for Prison Break and all the seasons of 24. I've loved Julianna Margulies since her days on ER.,1468886400,,295,4.267857142857143

5754966,4,B00CYQXGMW,"I began to watch The Good Wife, in 2016 the year that it went of the air, as I usually avoid network shows. The quality of the storytelling and acting captivated me and I was hooked. Sometimes, I found that too many guest stars cameo's were a little pat and even silly. However, it was wonderful to have the opportunity to see great New York actors on a series. The relationships between the characters, were well developed and the subject matter some now dated-appropriate for the times. I like many viewers was sorry when Josh Charles left the show, and it does not seem as if he has done any comparable work since. Thanks to Amazon Prime, I am able to see the entire 7 year series when convenient.",1468022400,,700,4.434108527131783

After this season, I felt a little less interested in the vicissitudes of LG law firm, as one of the key elements of tension and suspense was lost by the end of the season. However, it made this season super exciting. I also like how the climax is mid-season and the denouement is given the time it needs for both the characters and the viewers to process it. I'm a little sick of other TV shows where everything builds up to a climax at the end of the season because the cliff hanger effect is more likely to get people to see the next season.",1467590400,,600,4.31858407079646

What kind of man people would elect as a governor whose sex video with a whore had gone viral and who had spent time in jail. You've to suspend all your believes to watch this show. The verdict of the judges seems more suited to the agenda of the screen writers than what the believability would show, The show has too many characters whom I find obnoxious, the worst one being the Eli Gold, the campaign manager of Florrick. Within three season the tarnished man not only becomes attorney general but also the governor. What seemed to be a promising court room drama is nothing but play of dirty duplicitous characters.",1467244800,,954,4.617647058823529

5755680,5,B00CYQXGMW,"WTF was my first reaction to Will's death in the courtroom shooting, shocking to say the least. Couldn't go on watching anymore, had to take a break to mourn. Then I realized I am binge watching and this happened like two years ago, still had to find out what happened for the writers to get rid of him. I googled and read everything I could find on The Good Wife, Josh Charles, Julianna Margulies and all the other fine actors. Watched Paley Center for Media (this was also years ago) was great to see the actors being themselves. Also read the letter ""Life Goes On"" from Robert and Michelle King to the fans, which helped to ease the pain of losing Will. Thank you for that. Then I read another interview where it was Josh Charles decision to leave the show and how Julianna Margulies talked him into another 15 shows (16 since this is where he meets his demise), thank you Julianna!!. Still was so hard to see him go, I wish him the best in his future endeavors. I see where he is married and have welcomed a little one into their family. Funny since one of the reasons Julianna gave for him to stay with the show was the high cost of schooling for children. Now it won't be long before that will become a reality for him. I just completed Season 6 (binge watching again) and have enjoyed watching, although I did miss Will, it was nice they kept referring to him in some of the episodes. I'm looking forward to watching the 7th and last season. It has been a great ride, I will miss it when it is over. Love all the actors and the characters they portray. Aloha to you all, a big fan of The Good Wife.",1465430400,,1605,4.2655737704918035

Always entertaining and unfortunately, I believe, an all too accurate depiction of how our legal system has devolved into a moneymaker for lawyers who truly seem to not care about right and wrong but about who can out maneuver the other for the most money!  A bit of a rant, but still thoroughly enjoy the show and personalities it has created in the story it tells.",1464739200,,396,4.563380281690141

5755910,2,B00CYQXGMW,"Mostly liked it, but it got a little boring, and I don't think they should have killed Will off because it makes this season pretty dry. I would have given it 4 stars except they kept up with the lesbian sex scenes that don't help the show at all. I honestly only watch this show because I am home and bored most of the day and we got rid of Netflix (such a bad decision!) and there doesn't seem to be anything else I would like to watch on Prime.",1464652800,,447,3.977777777777778
5755911,5,B00CYQXGMW,"An exciting drama about a law firm based in Chicago. Excellent plots with outstanding writers.
Sometimes I get lost with too many for me to follow without supplemental research.
Well written and acted characters. I am interested in some characters home life and how work and home life clash at times.
Enough plot twists and surprises to keep me engaged.
This show should give you pause about becoming a high-powered lawyer; too much stress. I couldn't handle that much stress.",1464652800,,476,4.9625

5756065,4,B00CYQXGMW,Just keeps getting better,1464307200,,25,5.5
5756066,5,B00CYQXGMW,The fact that she betrayed Will and went out and started her own firm. The angst Alicia has dealing with how she hurt him.,1464307200,,122,4.125
5756067,2,B00CYQXGMW,"While I enjoyed Alicia successfully making it back from the depths her husband had left her in, the main pull to binge-watch this series was my deep hope that Alicia and Will would get back together (I loved Season 2 & 3). It is a good series with interesting characters (although some are clichd) but I really loved seeing Will's (Josh Charles') smile and the rhythm and draw between Alicia and Will. Josh Charles (actor playing Will) was a master of the very small expressions that showed Will's underlying emotions beyond his tough lawyer persona. Like a look in his eyes when he regretted saying something harsh or the slightest smile when things were going their way in court or Alicia made a good lawyer move. I watched all of this series after it was done (this year) from the beginning over about 3 weeks, but am now unsure if I will finish Season 6 and 7. My interest has gone way down...I hope studio staff still read reviews and take note and I hope they got flooded with emails and tweets when this actually happened.

TV execs seem to have forgotten why people watch TV. It is not to experience real life, it is not for shock value, or to educate (although there are some informational programs on PBS and Discovery etc).  The reason we watch TV shows is to feel better afterward!  Most of us have enough ups and downs in our real life and enough routine blech that we really don't need to see a bunch of failures or sadness.  We like to see likable characters succeed most of the time - it feels good at the end of the show if they triumphed over the bad guys (who ever those are). Or if they are happy with a relationship that is going well. Obviously there needs to be some downs, some difficulties but we don't want to feel unhappy or down or disappointed at the end of most episodes. We like to triumph or succeed with them!  As others have noted by the 5th year or so, they seem to look for things to do and often choose to irreparably change the product in the process. It is so strange with such a successful, award winning ensemble they choice to make such a decisive and disappointing change.  Like Ziva leaving NCIS, the Good Wife will never be the same without Will Gardner!",1464307200,,2199,4.403940886699507

5756403,4,B00CYQXGMW,"Just finished the last episode in this season. I enjoy it--it is undemanding and goes down easy--unlike many top-notch scripted shows. But here's what I wish for in seasons 6 and 7: Less Jackie; more Grace and Zach; less Eli; more Peter; fewer law-firm takeover dramatics; more courtroom dramatics; the demise of Mr Canning; the resurrection of Will Gardner. Ah, well. I have committed to watching the entire run of shows, but I will be glad when I'm through them all and can move on to the second seasons of Catastrophe and Bosch.",1462665600,,531,4.720430107526882

Then of course, the cherry on top is Kalinda, everyone's fantasy because, well, she does us all! Yes, she is a flamb! The men are easy on the eyes, and, one imagines, not bad on the lips, either. Good actors all, and easy to eat for dessert.

5756476,5,B00CYQXGMW,"This show is amazing. I was a total skeptic, but now I'm addicted. Little background I'm a 29 year old male Army captain. I like nerdy comic tv shows and movies. I have a gi Joe and a punisher and an American flag tattoo that says liberty or death, my mindset going into this show was what the heck am I going to enjoy about a show about a ""disgraced"" politicians wife who becomes a practicing attorney again and then all the awesomeness that is the good wife took me by storm.

I'm convinced this is one of the best shows that's ever been on television. The character development is genuine and emotional. The guest stars as well as series stars are a real treat for viewers of all types. And any Alan cumming fans should be totally on board. From ""I am invincible"" to ""are you kidding me!"" Also this is probably my only favorite show that I feel like my mom would really like too.

All around awesomeness. I can't decide which season is my favorite so far but I love the chemistry between carry and Alicia early and on.

Anyway, everyone should watch this. And disclaimer: as my college short story professor used to tell me ""I like where you're going with this, but it's a grammatical train wreck.""",1462406400,,1201,4.400900900900901

5756670,5,B00CYQXGMW,"I simply cannot get enough of this show! I love that it has strong female leads and they do so unapologetically. With great writing and great story lines you are introduced to a host of characters (some that come and go) that are intricate. I like that NONE of the characters are perfect, they are all horribly flawed, but redeemed by their innate kindness and goodness.

The show as of late has began to be redundant in the a portion of the plot line, without giving too much away, the main character is in a constant revolving door professionally and that is getting old. That being said, I have still given this show five stars because it is worth it to watch. I know that I will definitely be a fan till the end!

If you want to know more about this show, this is a synopsis from the Amazon page: THE GOOD WIFE is a drama starring Emmy Award winner Julianna Margulies as a wife and mother who boldly assumes full responsibility for her family and re-enters the workforce after her husband's very public sex and political corruption scandal lands him in jail.",1461628800,,1062,4.469072164948454

The dance between the various players can be intense at times while also being light and playful at others..  I used to watch the West Wing for its pace, content, and the fact it was provocative.  The Good Wife is not as fast paced but it does have intelligent story lines.  I recently discovered this show through Amazon Prime and have watched all the seasons in the past few months.  Very captivating.  I highly recommend especially if you like ethical questions and how they sometimes play out in a court room.",1456617600,,666,4.689655172413793

5757211,5,B00CYQXGMW,"I stopped watching The Good Wife at the end of Season 2 so I could watch Downton Abbey.  That was before I had a DVR.  So I've been binge watching starting with Season 3 on AMZ Prime and am reminded why I like the show so much.  It's been fascinating to see how Alicia has come into her own.  Zach and Grace are great too.  Eli is horrid, but he's supposed to be.  When Will died, I actually got kind of emotional.  I knew it was going to happen but had made sure not to find out how.  My guess was that Eli arranged it to help in some way with Peter's campaign.  The courtroom shooting was a complete surprise to me.  Anyway, for network TV, this is pretty darn good stuff.  Acting is great.  The women's clothing is just over the top beautiful, Christina Baranski is amazing, the music is incredible, especially during the open and closing credits.  What else to expect from Ridley Scott, right?",1456531200,,897,4.299401197604791

5757346,5,B00CYQXGMW,"I love this lawyer-y political drama! I have made it through 6 seasons on Prime in a little over a month. Each season has over 20 episodes, so just know it is not a weekend binge type of a show. I usually watch after my kids are in bed or if my 2 month old is keeping me up at night. It is definitely not something I would watch with my kids around (the oldest is 6) because of some of the subjects discussed. Overall, it is not too heavy on profanity or sex scenes but there are quite a few scenes with characters dialoguing in a bed after hookingup. Just want other parents out there to know what to expect. I will say the interoffice drama gets a little tiresome. But everything else keeps me hooked. Now I am seriously contemplating buying season 7 to catch up to where they are on TV. I don't usually buy something if I think I will only watch it once, but I might make an exception for this show.",1455580800,,902,4.101694915254237

5757446,3,B00CYQXGMW,"While season 5 is better than season 4, the show continues to trend downwards. I understand why Josh Charles wanted to leave the series - its decline is obvious - but why kill off his character? Let me say here, that I'm not a fan of killing off characters in a TV series. For me, it shows a lack of imagination. But seriously, having a client shoot Will in the court room by grabbing the gun of a careless guard was a real stretch, and it's been done before on TV. And now the series has to keep exploring Alicia's grief - not just in season 5 but beyond. Enough already. This truly is pure soap opera material, and when The Good Wife began, it was much better than a night time soap drama. Unfortunately, the soap opera aspect is taking over more and more of the show. I'll still watch for the few episodes that are actually good, but I can see why the show is coming to an end. And, for me, the beginning of the end started with the writers taking Kalinda's character in the wrong direction in season 4. It's all over but the shouting.",1455321600,,1038,4.221105527638191

5758889,5,B00CYQXGMW,"Even though I came to this series late and binge watched them all on DVD in less than a week, I knew going in to this season that it was going to be a sad one because I had remembered back when the episode with the courtroom shooting aired that people had talked about it and articles had been written online about it but I was unprepared for the magnitude of feelings this season and this series inspires. First of all, kudos to Alicia for going with Cary. I'm not saying I liked the decision when I first watched because I really like Diane and Will and their relationships with Alicia and if it had been me being Alicia, I would have taken their offer and been with Will on the side. I like to think that even though it wasn't implicitly said that she went with Cary so that one day Will and her could be together, without threats of sexual harassment or people saying she used her relationship with Will to get ahead in the company. Although if she would've taken managing partner deal at LG, she kind of would have been his equal, well minus seniority and the fact that he started the firm so maybe they could've had the relationship in the open there too. Anyways, wills last episode was heartbreaking and I felt like they wrote the grief real. As one who has grieved people that have unexpectedly died, you do feel like that. I liked how Alicia was able to lean on Diane and Kalinda and even her family and Finn in her time of need. I'm really glad she didn't finish walking in the door to the bar when the business man juror was waiting for her because it was just too soon and would've cheapened her feelings for Will. I really wanted to smack Peter upside the head though when everyone was being nice to her and she missed something politically due to her grief being so strong she couldn't get out of bed and Peter being like well at least it wasn't your husband that had died. I get that but come on Peter, where was that love and respect for your wife when you cheated on her in the first place? I loved the scene where they were discussing their affairs and he was like mine didn't matter and she was like too bad because mine did. That was the closest she really came to admitting to anyone the depth of her feelings for Will. I was really sad that she couldn't even admit to Diane that she loved him. I really liked the flashbacks with Will and Kalinda about why Alicia's firm was going to fire her for not having a backbone because I think it showed that will would probably forgive her eventually if he had lived because somewhere between her husbands scandals, will being her boss, and all the other ups and downs, this season proved that Alicia does have a backbone and that she's not being pushed around by anyone anymore whether she loves them or not. I think the other female characters such as Diane and Kalinda gained a bit more of that this season as well. I really enjoy the fact that this show has such strong woman characters, both as career woman, girlfriends and wives, mothers, and a combination of them all. Although if it was up to me, I would've had will Gardner on their for every single episode of this series and a happily ever after ending, I really can't see this season playing out any other way now that I've watched all of it, but I'm still hoping will and Alicia will be back together sometimes in flashbacks and dream sequences.",1444953600,,3373,4.347068145800317

So much better than some of these phony, so-caled ""reality"" garbage television shows,  that are all around the networks.  Those are produced to get your emotions rising by manipulating the stories and your mind.  If you watch those reality shows, you aren't there to be amused; you are there to be manipulated long enough to see the commercials.

5759328,5,B00CYQXGMW,"So, I was pretty angry when Will left the show. Heartbroken, really. I stopped watching Season 5 a few episodes afterward. I always hoped Will and Alicia would get together, and I just couldn't bear to watch the show without that chemistry I'd really fallen for. I took some time off. No matter how many people said, ""You have to watch again"" (people I'd gotten hooked), I couldn't do it for more than six months. And then, I finally started watching again. The show's writers did SUCH an amazing job moving beyond Will's character. I needed some time, but when I finally watched again, I couldn't stop until I was all caught up. Julianne Marguilies is so great at being vulnerable and powerful, all at once.",1441670400,,708,4.626984126984127

5760153,4,B00CYQXGMW,"One of my favorites. The show likes to structure many episodes around hot-topic current events, which I love. They like to show both the downside and more altruistic sides of the law and lawyers in general with probably a bias towards the downside of greed and revenge. Plots and dialogue are savvy and fast paced. Their depiction of the ins and outs of the business of a law firm can be far fetched and improbable, though, but that's where the fun is.",1436745600,,452,4.524390243902439

5760341,5,B00CYQXGMW,"This is a show that even though I had heard good things about it before hand constantly surprises me with how well written it is. Legal dramas are usually centered around court cases but the ""inside baseball"" aspect to how a law firm operates and strengths and flaws of the people that make it up I find really fascinating. Not to mention the way they portray judges and their individual biases and how lawyers either play to or fall victim to. All this and I haven't even got to the love triangle made up of the main character and the two flawed men she is involved with, she is not perfect either and that makes her very believable. Great show.",1435276800,,646,4.391666666666667

5760453,4,B00CYQXGMW,"In the first few seasons, the show was very much about the law and courtrooms. It was pretty accurate and the law buff in me was excited to see the debates between prosecutors and defense attorneys. And, it was nice to see the other side of the fence. Usually defense attorney's are portrayed poorly, but we get to see how the prosecutors can be conniving as well. I must say that in more recent seasons, the show has become less about the law and more about the drama. It slowly turning into a Soap Opera.",1434412800,,506,4.336842105263158

5760490,2,B00CYQXGMW,"The concept of the main character has become stupidly consistent.  She is very intelligent but does not seem to learn about the people around her.  I am very tired of the back and forth solvency of the law firm.  Perhaps this is the real way things go in a law firm but at this point it has been overdone.  Yes, lawyers are very competitive and natural back stabbers but only Alicia stays true??  Come on.
I would like to see Alicia wake up and smell the coffee about her family, her law partners, and especially her husband.

New stories about real law cases would keep this series interesting to me.  Wise up Alicia, she would seem more true to life.",1433808000,,652,4.383333333333334

The highlight of the whole year was the unexpected death of a main character -- not because I was glad to see this character die, but because it injected some real emotion into the storyline.

I won't give anything away but I will tell you I talk about these characters like I am gossiping about my friends.  Yup, they are my good friends.

People want to move on and let go of heartbreak and devastation, why not let her after 5 seasons??? either that or take a loisville slugger and just start smashing stuff up and ruin everyone's lives on the show..... because the balance has gotta tilt one way or the other especially if there's gonna be another season after this one (i don't know if there already is or not.. )",1429833600,,574,4.4245283018867925

The title turned me off for years and I wouldn't watch it but it really has me sold-- Not too sure why the hell they killed the character they did (that was me trying NOT to be a spoiler) but perhaps it will open up potential for more interesting drama rather than regurgitating old drama from past seasons.,1429574400,,365,4.304347826086956

Sometimes it's preempted two and three weeks in a row with different specials.  Unacceptable.  The long wait interrupts the flow and the time slot is soon converted and anger results in a decision to wait for the season to end to purchase a bootleg version of the season so as not to reward CBS for its flawed decision making process that attempts to exploit the hardcore fans attachment to the show by delaying the release and then charging a steep bounty for what is normally a ""free show"".",1429574400,,646,4.68141592920354

5761221,3,B00CYQXGMW,"Both my wife and I enjoyed thoroughly Seasons 1 through 4, however Season 5 was a major letdown to us. The rhythm of the story line has become hectic, leaving little time for the character development and story telling that was so well controlled before. Then teh story line has gone downhill. Separation of the 4th year associates from the main law firm was messy - very poorly handled, unethical, morally questionable, and mostly ridiculous - as the 4th year associates have no more wisdom than a squirrel.... This set up a very low expectation for the new law firm of Florrick-Agos, putting Alicia's character on shaky ground. To top this, the producers killed off the most likeable character in the series, Will Gardner - which effectively pulled the carpet from under the entire series. What we're left with is a very narrow focus on personal vendettas and minor squabbles played over the heads of their clients. Very little of the magic from the first seasons is left standing.... no more interesting (and intelligent) trial strategies, character development is frozen (poor Cary Agos's character was never developed, he continues to be portrayed as a fresh graduate, with minor roles), and the moral bearings of Alicia & team is consistently questionable. Not to mention, has anyone noticed that every time instead of going home to spend some time with her kids, she prefers a casual late evening drink at an upscale bar... It looks like the show script was hijacked by some insecure, frustrated late developer... What a shame.",1428883200,,1534,4.949612403100775

5761229,5,B00CYQXGMW,I started watching this series with show #1 of the first season on the Prime service. I never saw it on TV but now I am really hooked. I did find that there are multiple times in each program that prime disconnects or stops. I found that annoying but I persisted since I loved the program. I like the way it wove character through different episodes and seasons. I loved the development of the main characters. I think Ms Baransky is a great actress as well. I will continue to wait for the new season in the fall.,1428796800,,514,4.255102040816326

5761355,5,B00CYQXGMW,"An excellent acting ensemble, headed by Juliana Marguiles. After a few seasons--no matter  how well presented--boredom sometimes sets in. Not so with, ""The Good Wife"". The viewer is rewarded each season, with the very best T.V. has to offer. Always fresh concepts, nothing stale. This could be the longest running  show in the history of television. Who says that a female can't carry a show? A show that's blessed to have excellent writers, showing the realities of life. You'll get bits of humor, suspense, tear-jerking moments, heroes, odd characters/ odd-balls, etc. Like I said, ""the realities of life"".",1427328000,,608,5.1938775510204085

5761546,5,B00CYQXGMW,Season 5 continues with great writing and a great cast.  It seems as though every season has an interesting storyline with lots of good courtroom (and bedroom) drama tossed in.  The court cases are very interesting even without all the back stories.  I'm glad its still on the air - means more episodes to watch in the future!,1425945600,,326,4.586206896551724

5761559,3,B00CYQXGMW,"For me, Will and Alicia's relationship was the driving force behind this show- the big story that held all the little stories in place and made them feel meaningful. Technically, the show can continue after Will's death, but it won't be the same show. This show was never about Alicia's personal growth- she has been supernaturally capable and intelligent from the beginning- it was about the battle between love and duty, passion and ambition, emotion and dry efficiency, played out between Will and Alicia.

After the show's great investment in this relationship, Will's sudden and meaningless death leaves a bitter and nihilistic taste in my mouth. What if Mr. Roger's Neighborhood featured Mr. Rogers choking to death on a cracker and the show continuing without him? What if Carrie and Miranda from Sex and the City had gotten blown up in the middle of a season?.

The only bright side is that Will's death has ended my addiction to this show. It did feel a bit ironic at times to spend hours curled up on the couch watching super-efficient characters run around accomplishing things.",1425772800,18,1089,4.913043478260869

8587595,4,B00CYQXGMW,"Not crazy about all the liberalism and not a fan of the star, didn't really like her in ER but the show is still better than most of the other primetime out now. Could have done without Michael J Fox. Ridley Scott's touch of magic to the show was promising.",1530489600,,257,4.16

8587597,5,B00CYQXGMW,Season 5 got a bit drama and ridiculous.,1530230400,,40,4.125
8587598,5,B00CYQXGMW,Decent acting with some cool cameos of old Hollywood stars. Alicia walks like she's got a 2x4 stuck up her behind which is normal for Liberals and Lawyers alike though. The audio (music) is horrible during the show. Grandma Jackie needs to be run over by a truck. Installed is one homo and the ugliest of uglies is definitely Channing. It's bad enough that Alicia is such a naive idiot then there's a villainous drug dealer that looks like he couldn't kill a bug. But beyond the bad casting and very Libtard attitudes it's one of the better shows to watch simply because it sucks less than the rest of the shows available.,1527984000,,622,4.513274336283186

8587603,5,B00CYQXGMW,Engaging show.  A ton of educational values about the law.  It is disheartening to learn that the law is lot less black and white than I had hoped.  The series shows over and over again how a lawyer can successfully argue both sides of the equation.  And the rich can get away with a lot simply because they can afford expensive legal representations.  It is also disheartening to learn how corrupt the Cook County IL (and probably the other large IL counties) is.,1519516800,,464,4.542168674698795
8587604,3,B00CYQXGMW,I loved the first three seasons of the show and the fourth one still not as bad but season 5 is when the plot starts unraveling and you can easily see there's a change in writing or direction. All the characters behave in a way that is not true to how they have been all along. It's disappointing how such a great show just lost steam and was redundant with so many of its plot lines in the last 3 seasons.,1519516800,,406,4.0246913580246915
