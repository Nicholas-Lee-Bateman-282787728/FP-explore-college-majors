5710273,5,B00CAYSBZ0,I love this show!  Great characters and fun medical mysteries.  It was fun seeing the real personalities of the celebrities. This was made after the 2nd season so all of the plots they talked about had already happened.  Enjoyable!,1402099200,,231,4.871794871794871
5710274,1,B00CAYSBZ0,"Not only rather boring, but so outdated...at least 4yrs old !  Very disappointing , I  really love the series, which makes this ""interview"" that much more a bummer!",1401494400,,164,4.821428571428571
5710275,4,B00CAYSBZ0,"I've enjoyed the show, and enjoyed this behind the scenes conversation with the cast and crew.  Hope they add the show to Prime soon.",1392508800,,133,4.541666666666667
5710276,5,B00CAYSBZ0,I have always liked this show and now that I know the mechanics of this show I like it even more.  The evening told us how the show is written and why the actors act the way they do with the characters.  Great behind the scenes knowledge,1390867200,,237,4.0212765957446805
5710277,2,B00CAYSBZ0,"Why is it everytime I like a TV show and they do a Paley Center interview, all the actors come off as boring and uninteresting. The Lady who questions them never seems to ask a intelligent question. None of the actors seems particularly bright or quick witted. They all have charisma but none of them come off as quick witted, funny or intelligent. About half way through the boredom got to me and I turned it off.",1382400000,4,414,4.3896103896103895
5710283,1,B00CAYSBZ0,"Not enough interaction with all the actors and they all seemed bored and aloof and not good with audience interaction, except for the star, Mark F. Very disappointed. The person asking the questions wasn't too good either and steering through the awkward pauses or asking interesting questions. I've enjoyed all the other PaleyCenter productions, except this one.",1432944000,,363,5.385964912280702
5710284,5,B00CAYSBZ0,Great time with the stars.,1432944000,,26,4.4
5710285,3,B00CAYSBZ0,"I love Royal Pains! Having binge-watched the seven seasons, I enjoyed watching the actors who played my favorite characters talk about the show.",1432080000,,144,5.304347826086956
5710286,5,B00CAYSBZ0,"I love the series, I just wish they would get the rest of the seasons on Amazon Prime",1431648000,,85,3.7777777777777777
5710287,5,B00CAYSBZ0,"I love Royal Pains and all the actors. I especially like Ben Shankman.
An Evening With Royal Pains was fun to watch.",1430784000,,116,4.318181818181818
5710288,5,B00CAYSBZ0,Very enjoyable conversation for fans of the show,1426377600,,48,5.125
5710289,3,B00CAYSBZ0,It was alright.,1417910400,,15,4.333333333333333
5710290,5,B00CAYSBZ0,The Disc is great . I enjoyed it very much . Thank you . ART,1416873600,,60,3.066666666666667
5710291,4,B00CAYSBZ0,"Unfortunately, I had to take a star off of this one not because of the stars but because of the host. She is certainly not a star and did not make the stars shine. The chemistry between the cast and writers was pretty great, but the questions were drab. It felt like the host was insecure, unprepared and not well-dressed for the session. One could sum up the evening with the word: awkward. Still, I think it's worth a listen.",1409443200,,427,4.35
5710292,2,B00CAYSBZ0,kind of boring,1408579200,,14,4.0
8579429,4,B00CAYSBZ0,"I loved this show, so sorry that it ended. It was fun to see all the actors as themselves.",1475625600,,90,3.789473684210526
8579430,4,B00CAYSBZ0,It was good,1466726400,,11,3.0
8579431,4,B00CAYSBZ0,The show is such great fun.  My only complaint is that the constant shift from storyline to storyline gets tiresome...a bit more time on each would make for much better viewing.,1466467200,,177,4.709677419354839
8579432,5,B00CAYSBZ0,"Good,need to get the more recent stars on board.",1463443200,,48,4.444444444444445
8579433,4,B00CAYSBZ0,"Started watching this show a few months ago and have to admit, it really grew on me. Its light comedy, McGiver-medical techniques and unique characters kept me coming back episode after episode. So, when I saw this special presentation of An Evening with the cast, I was thrilled to learn more. It was entertaining, showed a glimps of the process, and even gave some insight to the actors and characters. It's pretty dated since the show is now in its 7th season and this was made after the 2nd, but it's a quick watch and fun to see if you are a loyal Royal Pains fan.",1440892800,,569,4.377358490566038
8579434,1,B00CAYSBZ0,Forced and contrived- a waste of time...,1437350400,,40,4.857142857142857
8579435,3,B00CAYSBZ0,Too long and rather boring,1436918400,,26,4.4
8579436,1,B00CAYSBZ0,Show is great. This was not. Moderator was a little too in love with the show to ask good questions.,1436486400,,100,4.05
8579437,5,B00CAYSBZ0,This is one of my favorite shows.  The cast is excellent.  The acting is believable.  It's also interesting.  The many medical problems Hank & his staff handle are not your everyday medical problems.  It's worth watching just to learn what medical issue they are going to tackle & how it's going to get solved!  I love Royal Pains!,1434326400,,331,4.620689655172414
8579438,1,B00CAYSBZ0,"oh dear.  This proves that the writers should have been up there!  Ha ha!  They are the witty funny ones! I love this show, but the actors are just that.  Actors.  And they all act really well.  This also proves that most actors are not good at NOT acting.  Stilted. Awkward.  The host was embarrassing.  She didn't help matters at all.",1433548800,,336,4.377049180327869
