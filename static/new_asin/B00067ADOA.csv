Jacob Marley died on Christmas Eve seven years ago. Today Ebenezer Scrooge displays his pessimism when his nephew wishes him a Merry Christmas. Scrooge is rich and unhappy. [Such emotions can result in a shorter life. Being happy correlates to a longer life. Its proved by statistics.] Two businessmen ask Scrooge for a donation to feed the poor and destitute. Scrooge rejects them. Bob Cratchit asks for a day off for Christmas Day. [Do you see some personal problem causing Scrooges problems?] At home he sees things. Indigestion he says. Has his food gone bad? The ghost of Marley visits him, complains about his fate, and warns Ebenezer about a visit from three ghosts. The Ghost of Christmas Past visits to review the past. One boy was rejected by his father. He remembers his apprenticeship at Fezziwigs business and a friend. She releases Ebenezer because of his belief that wealth is the only good in life.

The Ghost of Christmas Present arrives to take him away to visit Bob Cratchits home and see his family. They live simply and happily. Tiny Tim has a health problem. God Bless us, everyone! Scrooge is shown other places. His nephew has good words about him. In a jail prisoners sing. Beware of ignorance and want! Then a hooded spirit arrives to show the future. Businessmen talk and joke about a recent death. A rag and bone man will buy the used clothes from a dead man. Who is he? A young child has also died but the family accepts it. Can mens actions affect their future? Scrooge has a change of heart now. Then he awakes from this nightmare! It is Christmas Day. Scrooge orders a big turkey to send to Bob Cratchits family, then visits his nephew Fred at his home. They are feasting at Christmas Dinner. The next day Cratchit arrives late and gets a surprise! Scrooge will help his family.  God Bless us, everyone!

This was produced by Hallmark Entertainment for TV viewing by the whole family. What was left out from the novel? Read the original novel to see for yourself. I wonder what kind of business was Scrooge in? Was he a stock broker? A money lender? He doesnt create a product or perform a service, unless its an accounting business. Does anyone else care? Note how Christmas was different in the early 19th century. No Christmas trees until later after Queen Victoria married Prince Albert. No gift giving either, that came at the end of the 19th century. Trees were worshipped by pagan Germans before they were converted to Christianity; remember the story of St. Boniface? This is a story about one mans redemption and rehabilitation.",1449273600,,2627,4.716775599128541
