6203042,5,B00HS3PGF6,Best quality I've ever seen Josey Wales in. I got tired of seeing Josey Wales edited over a 4 hour stretch on TNT or TBS a couple times a year so I figured why not get a double feature of two of the greatest Westerns of all time.

6203054,5,B00HS3PGF6,Great double feature! Josey Wales... Yea-ha!,1465516800,,44,6.5
6203055,5,B00HS3PGF6,"Two of Clint Eastwood's best films are on one Blu Ray and the result is stunning. The Outlaw Josey Wales is now obtaining cult status and can stand with the best of the great westerns.  Eastwood's renegade Confederate on a mission of revenge against the Northern Vigilantes who killed his family drives this movie as the hunted Josey Wales takes on other misfits searching for freedom and takes them to a classic finish.  Unforgiven is his masterpiece.  An aging retired killer takes on one last job from a town's ""girls""  to exact revenge for cowboys that cut one of them up badly. Eastwood contrasts the harsh law of an autocratic sheriff played by Gene Hackman in an Oscar winning performance with the stumbling attempt of a gunman far past his prime who finally enters the town and uses sheer unapologetic violence against dictatorial law.  The Blu Ray versions of these two films are the best they've ever been for home viewing.  An excellent two for one.",1461542400,4,960,4.753012048192771

6203061,5,B00HS3PGF6,"Been on a Clint Eastwood kick this week. This was part of the finale for me.  Unforgiven is one of the best films Eastwood did, if for nothing else than that he plays an even dirtier character than Dirty Harry, a significant achievement in my book. And somehow his callousness is entirely endearing.

Outlaw is good too, but not quite on par with Unforgiven, FYI.",1458432000,,363,4.569230769230769
6203062,5,B00HS3PGF6,Have had both of these movies on DVD and decided to buy the 2-pack and give them a watch on BluRay. Both look and sound great on on the BR player and large screen TV. Worth buying if you are an Eastwood fan. Josey Wales has always been one of my top western favorites.,1453593600,,268,3.9814814814814814

6203066,5,B00HS3PGF6,"What they did with the BR conversion of Josie Wales was absolutely incredible. I'm not a person to pore over pixels and such, but it literally looked like a movie that was just recently made. What more needs to be said.

The movie itself is simply one of the best Westerns every made, of course.",1443484800,3,295,4.363636363636363

6203074,5,B00HS3PGF6,"The BR copy of Josy Wales was stunning, absolutely blew me away.  I had to do a double take as the picture was sharp, true, and the sound mixing fantastic.  Truly one of the best copies to BR I've ever seen.  And Josy Wales is easily one of the best Westerns made and holds up very well today in terms of memorable scenes, lines, and plot.  Unforgiven is a movie that I didn't appreciate nearly enough when I first saw it.  The BR copy wasn't as stunning as Josy Wales, but that's probably because my expectations were higher for Unforgiven as it is a much newer film.",1429574400,10,568,4.271028037383178

The Unforgiven Blue Rayin the same pack, did work, however...  BUT I actually paid for both to work.
