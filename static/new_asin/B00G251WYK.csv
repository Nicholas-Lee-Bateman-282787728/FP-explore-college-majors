6044441,5,B00G251WYK,"When I realized this was a Jeunet movie, I knew why I was loving it. To me it is very much the American counterpart to ""Amelie"", many
themes (and actors) are shared as well as  the ""greenish"" tinge he uses in  his movies, making the Montana sequences extra-gorgeous.
The music adds so much to this film, just like the ""Valse d'Amelie"" did for that film, only this time the music is very much ""American"",
and very haunting in it's own way. The actors are perfectly cast, and Helena Bonham Carter is excellent as always.
 I'm not going to spoil it by trying to describe it, if you don't like this movie, there is something terribly wrong with you",1441929600,,644,4.440677966101695
6044442,5,B00G251WYK,"Caution: Several people have pointed out that they feel my review revealed so much of the plot, that they think their experience was not as enjoyable as it could have been.

A movie unlike any other movie I have seen' and I watch a lot. Charming and deep. Beautiful photography. A comedy. A love story. A sureal tragedy.
Written like the combination of fairy tale and cowboy story, told by Groucho Marx.

Deep in the beautiful West, with moutains in the background is a family of unique characters. The mother a naturalist. The father living out his dream of being a real cowboy, just like the strong and silent cowboys on the silver screen, an older sister who wants to be an actress and is doing a good job of being a drama queen, and the fraternal twins the two ten year old brothers TS, and Payton.

Thomas Sparrow, or T.S. for short, tells his story; and we see he is a brilliant child; who analyses everything, even interactions between his family members. While his mother studies bugs; he studies his family, himself and people in general.  His story gives a clear sighted view of each one; but being a child he does not have the experience to give the wisdom to help him when an experiment goes awry with his brother Payton.

Payton is a happy little guy, who knows his limitations (compared to the rest of his family) but finds his own star and enjoys life. At ten he wants to be just like his dad; and he is obviously his dad's favorite...because his dad ""gets"" him, and he ""gets"" his dad. Payton is simple and pure, and T.S. loves him and wants to connect with him. Payton loves shooting guns, so T.S. develops an experiment around shooting.  But...Payton's gun jams, and when T.S. touches it, he accidentally shoots and kills his brother.

No one says anything in the family, and T.S. though brilliant and able to evaluate others; is unable to sort what happened to him, or understand the guilt he feels, or his family's silence.  This is what the film is about.

He does this by putting himself through a trip by himself to D.C.  In his mind his family should not want him. In his mind he is upset at his family seeming not to love each other, or even talk about his brother who is gone.  To him, this silence is in part because they blame him. He sees his family's pain, not as pain but as rejection of himself. T.S. blames himself, though he knows it was an accident. So when T.S. wins a coveted award given by the Smithsonian, unknowingly to a child; T.S. decides to go get it.

It is this loss of T.S. that finally jolts the family out of their selfish misery. They finally see the pain their child is in, though this is not overtly expressed and spelled out for those with understanding below an 6th grade level. They get it together, go get T.S., finally talk about the accident, and reunite and heal.

The movie is written just as one thinks, when one is trying to sort out a difficult problem; with flash backs,what ifs, self-talk in the form of whimsical asides. The journey is symbolic for the journey we each take after a tragedy coming to terms with issues generated by the pain. Not simplistic pain in a unidirectional flow, but real pain that is spherical.  It does this with so much economy in the telling that it requires something from the viewer; but it is acted, directed and edited so well that nothing is left out that matters.

I would recommend this for any family that has lost a child. I would especially use it to help remaining children get in touch with some of their feelings.  It is enjoyable as a comedy, and drama.  It is quirky enough and unusual enough so you won't feel like you have watched this same story in a different form. And,  even though the film doesn't short sheet the very intelligent, it would still be as good to even young children.  Other than a few bit part characters saying ""s***"" there is no violence and no sexual content.

I can only guess that those that gave it a 3 stars just did not ""get"" it, or were not able to pay attention to the film. I am surprised it does not have a 5 star rating from everyone. Definitely one of the better movies I have seen in a long while. My spouse watching with me, agrees.",1441929600,3,4178,4.408322496749025

6044445,5,B00G251WYK,"Wonderfully creative film about a 10 yr old boy who already feels isolated by his intelligence, then is confronted by the fear that he might have been responsible for a family tragedy that leaves him feeling like an orphan. Each member of his family deals with the loss through a different means of internalizing. His mother, Dr Clair, (Helena Bonham Carter is perfectly cast for this role), buries herself in her entomology work. Contrasted by her opposite, the strong silent cowboy father, (Callum Keith Rennie), who only becomes more distant. Even his sister, Gracie, (Niamh Wilson), avoids the topic, and focuses on debutante dreams to escape the desolation of life on a ranch. The silence fuels T.S.'s pain with a desire to find a place where he is needed, and a phone call from the Smithsonian wanting to honor him for developing a perpetual motion machine seems like just the ticket to find where he fits in life. Little T.S. Spivet, (played by the adorable Kyle Catlett), embarks on a grand adventure traveling by train hopping from Wyoming to Washington, DC. There are some tall tales, accompanied by suspense, danger, and breathtaking landscapes along the tracks to his destination. However, once in DC, T.S. is finally able to voice his pain by telling his story of loss. Much like the Wizard of OZ, T.S. learns people are not always what they seem, and his mother assures him that he is not to blame, so he comes to understand the place he actually fits just right and is needed the most is at home with his family.

If you love quirky stories told in the tradition of ""Big Fish,"" then you are sure to LOVE this film!",1441929600,2,1629,4.695804195804196
6044446,1,B00G251WYK,It was ok. I really expected more from seeing the movie trailer.,1441756800,,64,4.416666666666667
6044447,5,B00G251WYK,"*Mild spoilers* The only other person who has reviewed this clearly doesn't know anything about what they set out for in the Young and Prodigious Spivet.  First of all, you have to realise that this is a film from Jean-Pierre Jeunet. His other credits include MicMacs, Delicatessen, A Very Long Engagement, and the ever so lovely Amelie.  Jeunet's films play out as whimsical, quirky, nuanced pastries--they're delights, but focus more on detail and style rather than story.  It's about the small moments over the big picture; the little asides that make us chuckle.

This film is no exception the Jeunet's style.  With his gorgeously saturated greens and yellows, Jeunet introduces us to the slightly over-polished version of a country farmhouse, intertwined with gorgeous train montages and ultimately ending up in the big city.  The film follows child prodigy TS Spivet, who despite his genius, never asks for attention: people just assume that he is a know-it-all.  In reality, TS just wants to invent, explore, and has a thirst for science that I hope many children these days will replicate.

TS and his family live on a farm in Montanta--his sister, a talkative teenager; his mother, a entomologist; and his father, a cowboy.  One day, the farmhouse gets a phone call from the Smithsonian Institute, telling TS that he won a prestigious award for his invention.  Because of his young age, TS fears the scientific community at large would discredit his work, so he poses as his father over the telephone to tell the Smithsonian he would accept the award. The rest of the story starts here: TS's secret journey to Washington D.C. to give an acceptance speech.

The film has and undercurrent of darkness and an air of sadness.  We slowly get told the story of TS's brother, who died during one of TS's science experiments. TS has since been mostly ignored by his parents: the death of their child (in TS's mind, their FAVOURITE child) plays a toll on them both, and mother and father grow apart from not only their son, but from each other.  TS carries the weight of his brother everywhere, and in those moments where he sees his brother's spirit on the train, in the museum, and out on the ranch, you can feel the looming sadness from the film.  The darkness isn't introduced all at once: it lurks in the background for a long time, until finally TS reveals the story of his brother's death and how he feels it is his fault.

While the movie may have sad moments, it's ultimately a tale of love and a story about family and how even though we may think we can do everything alone because we feel smart enough or big enough or wise enough, we all still need our family and friends to survive.  Friends that sit in train cars with us and talk by the fire, friends who pick us up at our most vulnerable moments, even if it's just to get a ride in their truck.  We all need someone, and I think TS Spivet does a good job of showing us a loving, if not slightly lost family, trying to pick up some broken pieces from their past.

I sincerely hope they release this on Blu Ray in the States sometime soon.  I'd very much like to have this film with the rest of my Jeunet films.  I definitely recommend this to anyone who loves French cinema, any of Jeunet's previous work, or just want to see a quirky movie about a little boy and a big adventure.",1441756800,46,3346,4.57286432160804
6044448,3,B00G251WYK,"The Young and Prodigious T.S Spivet follows the story of a highly intelligent ten year old boy who although shares a farm house in the middle of rural America with his parents and older sister, pretty much just lives a life of isolation with his own imagination.  T.S has invented all kinds of things, things that if his father paid attention would vastly make life on the farm easier, but T.S's interpretation of his father is that he loved his other son (T.S's deceased twin, because he was into cowboy stuff) but barely cares that he exists.  His mother is more interested in her bug collection, his sister interacts with him but treats him like a regular big sister does ie picks on him.  One day he gets a phone call from the Smithsonian in DC, they have awarded him some big prize for inventing the perpetual motion machine that he sent them the design for, they assume he is an adult and have invited him to give a speech.  T.S. decides to journey to DC and collect his award, since he isn't appreciated at home or by his not very bright teacher at school.  This movie covers his journey there and what happens once he gets to DC.

The movie never came across as being realistic at all, both in it's appearance on the screen, the bright colours of a very clean farm at the start to the simplification of everything he uses or visits along the way.  It sort of has a kids TV movie feel to it, such as dim witted cops who ask to put up a wanted poster when the person in the poster is standing right there. Although there is a bit of swearing towards the kid from a few different adult characters and a bit of violence between adults near the end.  We also see a cat having a tin can tied to it with that can being shot at as the animal flees in terror by the brother at the start.  The film does pass the time quite enjoyably though and is worth watching although you're constantly thinking to yourself as if that would happen or wouldn't that be the first you'd look, how would she have gotten into that room and things like this.

The Australian DVD version (I don't know what this version has as there are no details on the extras on this product page), has the most bizarre extras I've ever seen.  All such as the behind the scenes stuff, bringing the novel to the big screen and so on have the English speaking actors say something for a few seconds, than some guy just takes up the screen speaking in French for most of each feature. It's a movie filmed in English, I'm sure he has something to do with the film but if he can't speak English, why not find someone else to contribute to the special features? There aren't any subtitles on these features so they end up just being pointless.  Then you've got one about the movie being in 3D when the movie you see on the DVD is in normal 2D.",1428451200,4,2801,4.284090909090909
6044449,5,B00G251WYK,"This is a beautiful film, every scene is a gem... I can see why it may not have been widely distributed in the States: it is a caricature of America, made by a French director adapting a Scandinavian book. Foreign looks upon the US are not always well received, especially when they have several layers of profoundness and touch on delicate subjects like giving guns to children and exploiting child talent for your own fame and profit.

I can also see that many people do not appreciate Jeunet's storytelling style, which reminds me of Wes Anderson in Moonlight Kingdom. Still, I think this film deserves to be watched and appreciated for what it is: a deep look into America, a serious story underlying the frivolous storytelling style. A film to be watched and re-watched, savouring every scene.

And it does prove that it is possible to make a good quality film using 3D technology and not just some mindless super-hero blockbuster!",1412380800,28,936,4.807453416149069
6044450,1,B00G251WYK,"I didn't think very much of this movie.  It certainly wasn't worth re-watching

I was a little mystified that it seemed so little known in the United States.  The director, Jeunet, had a smash hit with Amelie, so, since this was a full-budget follow-up, I would have assumed it would have been heavily pushed in the U.S.

Alas.  Half an hour into it you realize why distributors never seemed to pick up on this.  (As of this writing, it's not even available in the U.S. except as an import).

A script that has nothing to say, whose quirkiness feels forced, whose resolutions are meaningless.  Spivet and his family are completely unbelievable (except maybe the teenage daughter), as are his adventures.  Worse than that, though, Jeunet apparently lacked any sense of direction for his script.

6044452,5,B00G251WYK,"Great to see a wholesome movie that honors Science. I enjoyed every minute of T.S.'s adventure and emotional journey. Thank God for the Smithsonian - at least there is still some structure in Washington that believes in Science. God help America get through this hopefully short-lived ""Reign of Ignorance"".

Instead of a 12 year old boy this is about a 10 year old, more precocious that way, genius who wants to escape from his family and their tragedy by accepting a prodigious award for his scientific findings. He has a cross country adventure and eventually comes to some understandings about his family. It deals with the difficult topic of accidental death so if you have young children you might want to view it first or talk about it with them afterwards. Visually it's a beautiful movie and the acting is superb. If you enjoy the movie, I recommend the book which has a whole other dimension of story in it.",1485648000,,749,4.434782608695652

6044481,4,B00G251WYK,"This latest film from French director Jean-Pierre Jeunet and 'Hugo' stereographer Demetri Portelli is an amazing thing to behold. It is based on  the 2010 book ""The Selected Works of T.S. Spivet"" written by Reif Larsen.

Jeunet intended for this film to be in 3D from get get-go, so every single frame of film is shot with 3D composition in mind. Captured with ARRI ALEXA Plus cameras, the visuals in this movie will leave you floored. It is, without a doubt, one of the finest 3D visual feasts ever offered up to the cinema. The rich color palate and use of HDR is absolutely striking.  Portelli and Jeunet's framing, composition, use of floating frames, hyper and standard stereo is expertly executed. It is a MUST SEE for any 3D enthusiast.

As for the story, 'Hugo,' which I would consider to be the next finest 3D film, has a much more solid story and fluidity. After watching Spivet, I started reading on-line reviews. It would seem that many critics could not decide if this film was a comedy or not. I would say that certainly, it isn't. I am not going to go into a full plot summary here as you can find that anywhere. What I found was the filmmaker trying to mix quirky whimsy with tragedy, and it left me with mixed feelings about how those two elements can mesh together to create understanding and satisfaction.

The morality play is ultimately about death, how individual family members cope with loss, and the negative effects it can have on a marriage, sibling, and parental relationships. This is all framed around T.S. Spivet, a 10 year old boy genius who has invented the world's first perpetual motion machine, which he always reminds people, will only last for 400 years, so it's not technically perpetual. It has it's fun and cute moments, and the PG rating is accurate. Being a parent who has lost a child, I can say from experience that movies that try to tackle this subject often focus on the horrifically negative effects this can have on a family that eventually tears them apart. At least, in this film, the family learns to deal with their loss and move on as a cohesive unit, which was a refreshing thing to see for the first time on film.

This movie was suppressed in US theaters because of an apparent editing feud between Jeunet and his distributor, the Weinsteins. It is a sad thing indeed. The movie ended up losing a great deal of money when it shouldn't have.

It is available on 3 Blu Ray, but if you are looking for region 1 Blu ray, you have very few options. My copy is a Chinese import that I picked up on Amazon for $40 with shipping. It is in English as well as the titles, but there are Chinese titles too, which is no big deal. Someone gave me a link to a site in Australia what is selling it as a region 2 for $25AU and claims it will plays on region 1 also, but I went ahead and got the Chinese import.

If you love stunning 3D visuals, you MUST see this film. I'm giving the 3D: 5 Stars
For the story, with it's quirky mix of whimsy and tragedy, and sometimes stilted dialog, I'd give it : 2 1/2 stars
To balance between the two ratings, I gave it 4 stars overall.",1467504000,2,3115,4.4052173913043475

That may, actually, be my own fault because normally, I don't like to see a film before reading the book it was made fromso I read it first. Had I watched the film first, I may well have given this a 5-star. As a former professor of Mass Media, I know it is nearly impossible to make a film that follows a book precisely. Though I could ramble on about what Jeunet could have or should have done, at the end of the day, he is the artist and the one with a vision of the film he wanted to make.
To be honest, the film is perfectly charming and, most likely, deserves a higher rating  than the three-stars that I gave it. If you are contemplating ordering this film, don't read the book first.",1461628800,,803,3.987577639751553

This supposedly quirky tale of a young Montana lad obsessed with maps began a while back when his brother died in a shooting accident. The boy who is still alive invents a perpetual motion machine and wins a Smithsonian scholarship. Without telling anyone, he hops aboard a freight train for his trip to Washington D.C. Along the way, he is a poster child for how to NOT run away from home by repeatedly put himself at risk fleeing railroad bulls, climbing into a freight car with a grizzled old bum hitching a ride with a trucker who takes polaroids of all his riders and posts them in his cab etc. etc.  The grief of losing their first child, and the sudden disappearance of their second, devastates the family and permeates the movie with too much grief and misery for young people (and older people) to enjoy it. The acceptance speech/confession in front of the scientists is so ridiculously tear-inducingit becomes farcical.

(must not have been enough for me to remember) , but other than that there was nothing objectionable. TS Spivet was so winsome and intelligent. It was like watching his adventures from a child's perspective, and maybe that's why  I thought the end was a bit 'off' as far as seeming reasonable. The message about the death of his twin brother was a good one, but might be upsetting to younger viewers and people who take a dim view of gun ownership. I was a bit hesitant to recommend this movie to my precocious and  adventurous 8 year old grandson because I could see him thinking with the typical nave perspective of youth,  that the journey of TS Spivet  was entirely doable.",1444867200,,759,4.478260869565218

The film had some nice scenery, the characters more or less developed as they progressed. The scenes of the Smithsonian did no one any favors; was totally out of character for the Institution or the intent of the story. The failure to follow the story line did put an ending on the tale but it was milky-toast compared to the original. I think the producers tried too hard to be cute...too commercial. Coincidentally, the whole concept of imagination and talent blossoming in a child was turned into a boy with freaky unbelievable tendencies.

The humor is quirky, much like in Coen brothers comedies. I also appreciate the uplifting family dynamics.

6044799,5,B00G251WYK,"I watched a version of this film that had a more explosive interaction at the end between TS' parents and the predatory talk show host (the original European release) . This film was edited so it could receive a PG rating by the MPAA. I am wondering why as it was playing on one screen in Los Angeles for its theatrical release 6 weeks ago, and I had to search the Internet weekly for almost a year to see it on the big screen. I wonder why they bothered as this movie is not a kid's film despite having a kid starring in it. It can't possibly be because they were searching for the widest possible audience because Weinstein sat on this thing for almost two years before ""fixing"" the ending and then gave it NO chance as far as promoting it.
That being said, the basic story is still intact, the beautiful cinematography and Jean Jeaunet use of color correction and subtle digital effects make this a feast for the eyes if you love road/travel movies.  The humor is quirky and very visual. Many say this film has made a departure from the director's usual style, but I see everything Jeunet about this film except the language and cast. Dominique Pinon makes his usual cameo appearance.
The editing and re-tooling of the ending was criticized by Jeunet (who likes having their art messed with? Anyone?) and although I enjoyed every minute of of the original version, it seems like the Weinstein company went out of its' way to piss of the director and to add insult to injury, make sure only a handful of die hard Jeunet fans got to see it in 3D.
At least Primers will get to see it but I encourage anyone in possession of the Euro release to please upload the cut scenes to YouTube so we Americans can see what the film should have been like.",1443484800,18,1744,4.3993808049535605

I found it touching to the point of tears at times.  The young star was flawless and backed up by several strong supporting actors.  It has some very painful subject matter at times but not so dark that I think young kids would be disturbed by it and at the same time light a humerus enough to leave with a warm glow at the end.  I hope no one is too old to enjoy such a sweet tale.",1443139200,2,556,3.8333333333333335

It features a 10 year old at the center of the story, but I'm not sure I would share it with a child that young. Perhaps 12 years on. The tragedy that emerges in the first quarter of the movie, then runs the rest of the way through doesn't feel like fare for a youngster.  But if you're looking for something light for yourself that has a feel good ending, not too heavy on the emotions, but witty and satisfying, this will fit the bill.  Also if you have secret unfulfilled desire to just take off and live on a ranch in the mid-west, you'll be encouraged there too. The photography is gorgeous.",1442188800,11,678,4.2890625

8620150,4,B00G251WYK,"I bought this movie because I love Jean-Pierre Jeunet's ""Micmacs"" and wanted to see more from him. Although I have not read the book on which it is based, the film adaptation of ""The Young and Prodigious T. S. Spivet"" is at once a melancholy film in which a young boy genius must come to grips with the realities of life and death, but is also an uplifting and imaginative envisioning of a life of scientific genius and adventure dexterously filmed in beautiful scenes that flow together perfectly. Jeunet is a brilliant visual storyteller, and here his craft is finely polished: everything from the beautiful vistas of the American west to the animated links between scenes is absolutely flawlessly executed.

I hesitate to reveal much of the plot, but I will say the entire cast does exceptionally well with their roles, although two of the main characters are intensely unlikeable (T. S.'s mother played by Helena Bonham Carter, and Judy Davis as a truly loathsome representative of the Smithsonian). It's worth singling out young Kyle Catlett who played T. S. for praise: rarely has a child actor been able to pull off such nuance and I expect him to have a shining career. Although filmed in Canada, the film is set on the Spivet farm in Butte, Montana, where T. S., his twin brother Layton (Jakob Davies), and self-absorbed sister Gracie (Niamh Wilson) are largely bored. Their mother is a kooky and annoying entomologist who is unable to use a toaster and their father (Callum Keith Rennie) is a strict cowboy who doesn't appreciate the brain T. S. has, but does appreciate Layton's skills with a gun. T. S. invents a perpetual motion machine and is invited to the Smithsonian as a guest of honor. He runs away from home and the adventure ensues. Ultimately T. S. has to face the crowd at the Smithsonian, and this was for me the only part of the film I didn't like. I didn't dislike it because of the dark turn the plot takes, but because I felt the entire scene was a tad too contrived and predictable, and Davis' characterization becomes almost too loathsome to tolerate; likewise the subsequent television interview (""This is better than science! This is cable TV!"") had the parents make a surprise appearance and mom comes across as off-base and rambling, which given her obvious academic accomplishments seems dubious. Fortunately the father's grand entrance (and exit) more than make up for this too cloying section of the film and the movie wraps up on a strong note.

The DVD contains three extras, two of which are largely about casting the film, and one of which concerns adapting Reif Larsen's story into the screenplay. They are all short and are worth watching. I liked this movie very much, largely because of the quality of acting and direction and the brilliant cinematography. Although there were a couple of places I felt the story slowed or allowed out of character developments, I still unreservedly recommend the movie, though be forewarned that some younger children may find its dark overtones to be difficult to deal with.",1513296000,,3054,4.826335877862595

8620153,5,B00G251WYK,"This is a very charming story...a bit of a cross between Home Alone, and (from a 3D standpoint) Disney's 1982 70mm 3D effort ""Magic Journey's"". The cinematography by Thomas Hardmeier, is without question the best use of 3D available on Blu-ray. Hardmeier cut his ""3D teeth"" on the beautifully filmed ""Hugo"" which also offers spectacular 3D imagery. In the pioneering ""Magic Journey's"" 70mm 3D film shown at EPCOT and Disneyland, director Murray Lerner used inner-occular manipulations to change perspective and scale in a way that has been mostly ignored until T.S.Spivet brought it to the screen in a film where virtually every shot has been designed for 3D effect. This is a very charming and quirky story that never received proper distribution in the United States. Aside from very brief questionable language, and a disturbing event that besets the family, everything pulls together as the story progresses through all the spectacular color enhanced 3D adventures contained in this film.",1489363200,,992,5.245283018867925
