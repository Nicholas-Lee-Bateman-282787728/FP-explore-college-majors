8651361,5,B00JJOY4ZA,"Ive been waiting years for The Final Option, also known in the UK as Who Dares Wins, to become available in US format. Its a classic military thriller that holds up well even now, and essentially builds up to a recreation of the SAS storming the Iranian embassy and freeing the hostages.  No idea why it was paired with an obscure second feature but no matter, the one film is worth the price.",1518393600,,393,4.383561643835616
8651362,4,B00JJOY4ZA,"Loved Final Option, didn't like Escape from Devils Island but Final Option was worth the price.",1476057600,,95,5.0
8651363,5,B00JJOY4ZA,The ONLY reason I gave this a 5 star is because of The Final Option. For some reason finding TFO is very hard to find here in the states- at a reasonable price anyway. I won't even bother saying anything about the other film included on this other than it's horrible. You'd think that something more comparable with either film would be part of this 2 movie disc and the only reason I can see this being done is to have people forced into buying Devils Island- a truly horrible film.,1464825600,,483,4.318681318681318

8651365,5,B00JJOY4ZA,"I saw this movie when it was at the theater and enjoyed it very much. It definitely is a very hard to find movie and I was glad to see it on a Blu-ray double bill. I give this one five stars

The Jim Brown movie was enjoyable to a point. Unfortunately the ending left you hanging. While watching this one I began to wonder if Brown, probably the most successful athlete to turn movie star, was at the start of his box office slide. All of this being said I think that this double feature was worth the money and time",1430438400,,516,4.0588235294117645

8651369,5,B00JJOY4ZA,"you finally can get 'The Final Option' not only on DVD but Blu Ray to boot. Classic anti-terrorism Cold War polemic with a lot of input from SAS operatives who served as advisors. Lot's of James Bond DNA in the production as well; right down to veteran stunt arranger Bob Simmons, and Roger Moore's double Martin Grace getting an actual role as a US Marine embassy guard.

Lewis Collins was on the short list to replace Moore if he didn't do 'Octopussy', and this was generally considered a dry run for him.

The rescue Op at the film's climax still serves as a training film for SpecOps people in both the UK and US. Good soundtrack from Roy Budd doesn't hurt, and this is a must have for fans of the genre. The film's take on left wing politics has made it unpopular with the major media and it rarely gets airplay, although MGM has shown it recently.

While having it's share of flaws- the US Ranger in the film was basically all wrong; bad hair, wrong uniform and such- ultimately it is a forgotten classic of a bygone era. One that might not have gone away, though.

Terrorism still exists, and the men who fight them are FAR more like these characters than you might think.

The Jim Brown flick is a forgettable B film hardly worth the effort to watch. But 'The Final Option'- known in the UK as 'Who Dares Wins'- the SAS motto- is a must have...",1414886400,8,1352,4.370517928286852
