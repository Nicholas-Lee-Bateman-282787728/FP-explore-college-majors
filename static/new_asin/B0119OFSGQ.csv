7330935,5,B0119OFSGQ,"Really good show, just watched the 90 min. On PBS . Fast moving, and will keep you thinking. Classic Sherlock. I do hope they make more episodes like this one.",1451606400,2,159,4.333333333333333
7330936,5,B0119OFSGQ,The show is excellent. This is one of the best shows in the world this special episode did not disappoint,1451606400,5,105,4.3
7330937,5,B0119OFSGQ,"I have it on impeccable authority that I can deduce with absolute clarity that once you have eliminated the impossible, whatever remains, however improbable, must be the truth.

Where have I heard that before? Someone who went by the name of Mr Holmes wasn't it? Perhaps he can explain how this 'Special' detailing the exploits of London's premier detective arrived at my doorstep this morning, hand delivered by a mysterious gentlemen in ill fitting garments and a waistcoat of lurid orange with stripes of fluorescent yellow, grunting in a guttural language I am unfamiliar in before disappearing into a carriage of blood red and departing through a smog bank.

The package handed to me had travelled a great distance of time... it was housed in a box of stiffened card, the like of which I had not seen before, for it opened along a perforated edge allowing it to reveal its contents in the manner of a puzzle box. I expected a book, but it was like no book I have ever seen. Tucked inside was a translucent cobalt jacket held shut by an invisible clasp, inside which I find two mirrored discs that reflect a mesmeric blue ray of light that struck at my temples like a poison dart before a small pamphlet fell from the case. A pamphlet which carried on it a miniature portrait of Sherlock Holmes himself, a photograph of such clarity that it appeared to jump from the paper. It carried with it the title SHERLOCK THE ABOMINABLE BRIDE.

A bill of sale also fell from the box from which I spied the particulars of the organisation behind this unexpected delivery. An organisation named after the unexplored wilderness of South America, a dark unchartered region of untamed land where the river AMAZON coils like a serpent through dense undergrowth.

And then I noticed the postal date..I felt a chill upon my spine..

I concealed this note inside the package, sealing it with string before writing in ink upon the box RETURN TO SENDER and posted it that evening into a pillar box. It would one day arrive back at my London address, of that I am certain.

I retired that night beside the fire, sherry glass in hand, speculating on what an Abominable Bride could possibly be, before I drew the curtains upon a snow clad London and under candle light returned to my page within The Strand Magazine, dated December 1895..",1449878400,22,2318,4.683046683046683
7330938,1,B0119OFSGQ,"I have not watching this particular movie but I really don't like the scripts these actors are given in particular the imitation episode of ""The Woman"". It was terrible. I was astounded that they wrote the play the way they did. I was ashamed of the script and the silliness of it. The original of, ""The Woman"" was elegant, classy and classic. The episode on PBS of, ""The Woman""  was just plain worthless. I don't fault the actors but I do fault PBS and the poor imitation of Sir Doyle's marvelous Sherlock Holmes episodes. After that episode I just didn't waste my time.  Basil Rathbone and Brett.....no comparison. Classy, well done and classic.  But not these episodes.",1448582400,12,672,4.726495726495727
7330939,5,B0119OFSGQ,"3 MINUTES, 55 SECONDS
""The Abominable Bride"" aired on PBS January 1, 2016.
I recorded it, but postponed viewing it for two weeks until the Blu-Ray arrived.
Turned out to be a good decision.
Not only is the picture on Blu-Ray worth the wait, but
The PBS broadcast was 1 hour, 28 minutes, 22 seconds (timed from ""So far on Sherlock"" to the start of the closing credits).
The Blu-Ray (and DVD) is 1 hour, 32 minutes, 17 seconds.

WHAT HAPPENED TO SEASON FOUR?
The first three seasons of ""Sherlock"" aired on the BBC at two year intervals -
Season One in 2010.
Season Two on New Year's Day 2012.
Season Three on New Years Day 2014.
Season Four was scheduled for New Years Day 2016, but is running late.
 We will have to wait until New Years Day 2017.

To tide us over until then, the BBC and PBS offered this interesting stand-alone experiment.
A single 90 minute adventure titled ""The Abominable Bride"".
The BBC series ""Sherlock"" is set in modern-day London.
The Abominable Bride was a traditional Sherlock Holmes adventure set in Victorian London
(any more would be a spoiler).
The title has a canonical connection.
""The Case of Ricoletti of the Club-foot and his Abominable Wife"" - mentioned in ""The Musgrave Ritual"" - was one of Dr. Watson's cases for which the public is not yet prepared.

You also get 90 minutes of bonus material.
Very well done.
Both the program and the bonus material have English SDH subtitles.
The costumes, sets, cinematography and special effects are absolutely gorgeous.
Typical for this series, the plotting is perhaps a bit too imaginative, but the quality of the writing is up to the usual high standard of ""Sherlock"".
The exchanges between Sherlock and Mycroft are especially witty and well-done.
Unlike his modern self, the Victorian Mycroft is depicted in a canonically correct manner (Mark Gatiss in a fat suit).

I hope the producers try this Victorian experiment again.
There are plenty more of Dr. Watson's stories for which the public is not yet prepared.

P.S. One problem I have with virtually every Sherlock Holmes film:
The street number on the front door should read ""221""
Not ""221B""
Mrs. Hudson lives on the first floor. Her mailing address is 221A.
Sherlock lives on the second floor. His mailing address is 221B.
If there was a third floor tenant, his address would be 221C.
The front door opens to Mrs. Hudson's parlor.
It's a communal entrance for all tenants, not a private entrance for the second floor tenant.

More Confusion:
In the United Kingdom, the first floor is referred to as the ""ground floor"".
The second floor is the ""first floor"".
The third floor is the ""second floor"".",1446595200,140,2631,4.743982494529541
7330940,5,B0119OFSGQ,"I am on pins and needles awaiting the return of ""Sherlock!""  I know both men are very busy in other acting performances (and they are Great!), but I and so many others need our ""fix"" of Sherlock and will accept just 4 episodes rather than none.  Everyone involved in this series get a 5 Star rating from me for all the work they have all done individually and as a group in putting out Sherlock for the public....thanks to you all!

7330941,5,B0119OFSGQ,"It's 1895 Victorian England. Inspector Lestrade, sporting muttonchops, visits Watson, Mrs. Watson and Holmes at Holmes' rooms at 221B Baker Street.  'Tis the season, and the unusually pensive Lestrade murmurs ""Merry Christmas."" Watson and Mrs. Watson respond in kind and the always impatient Holmes says, ""Thank god that's over.""  So why is Lestrade really there?

Because he's scared. Yesterday morning, a woman in a wedding dress, ""white as death, mouth like a crimson wound"", stood on a balcony and shot at people in the street with a pistol. Before each shot, she asked, ""You?"". Then she put the gun in her mouth and shot the back of her head off.

Sherlock, ""Really, Lestrade. A woman blows her brains out and you come to me?""

Yes. Because that evening, in Limehouse, the same bloody bride accosted her husband on the street, and shot him dead with a shotgun.
Or, as Lestrade puts it, ""Til death do us part. Twice in this case.""

Skip to several months later, and Lestrade visits again. There's been 5 men murdered in their homes. In each case, rice was scattered on the floor like in a wedding. And written in blood on the wall was ""You.""

What is at work here? Is it a ghost, as the newspapers speculate?

Not likely. Holmes tells Watson, ""Every great cause has martyrs. Every war has suicide missions. And make no mistake - this is war.""

""The Abominable Bride"" originally aired on 1/1/16. It is 86 minutes long (without commercials). It is a good show, a lot of eerie fun, with a bit of melodrama, action in two time periods, and more than one ending. I found it a joy to see Cumberbatch and Freeman in Victorian clothes and setting: ""You're Sherlock Holmes - wear the d%$#n hat.""

Trivia: In a 2015 RadioTimes interview, Steven Moffat makes this surprising statement (with which I admit I don't agree): ""As for Holmes's death, I don't believe that Conan Doyle ever really planned to kill him off. That's faithfully reported, but I don't believe it. The way he's killed off in ""The Final Problem""... well, there's no body, is there? So Sherlock is obviously not dead. Conan Doyle was a mystery writer, for goodness' sake! I'm sure the plan all along was to 'resurrect' him.""

In spring, 2016, they will begin filming the 3 episodes of ""Sherlock"" Series 4, also to be 90 minutes each.

Sherlock: ""Why aren't you dead?""
??? ""Because it's not the fall that kills you, Sherlock!""

The DVD/BluRay present the show in 16:9 anamorphic and Dolby Digital Surround sound. English subtitles are available on the show and all of the Bonus Features.

Bonus:
....1.  ""Mark Gatiss: Study in Sherlock"" (30 minutes) Gatiss (co-creator and co-writer) hosts this special. Other commentators include Benedict Cumberbatch (plays Sherlock), Martin Freeman (plays John Watson), Steven Moffat (co-creator and co-writer), Amanda Abbington (plays Mary Watson), Una Stubbs (plays Mrs. Hudson) and Andrew Scott (plays Moriarty).
Gatiss says, ""Steven and I were very keen on, from the beginning... to dramatize certain things which had not been done.""  Most Sherlock Holmes depictions start at a point where Sherlock and Holmes have been friends for a long time. For this special, we are shown the scene ""where young Stamford introduces his friend Dr. Watson to a mysterious stranger called Sherlock Holmes.""
....2.  ""Production Notes"" (6 minutes) Using his cell phone to record, Gatiss takes us along for a day of filming. It's February 4, 2015, the day they shoot the Reichenbach Falls scene. Commentators include Jean-Claudd (J.C.) Deuara (VFX Supervisor), Steven Moffat and Benedict Cumberbatch. At one point, Gatiss turns the camera on himself and says, ""It's twenty to 5:00, we finish at 8:00. We've got tons to do. We're in big trouble. The lens keeps foggiing up. Everything takes too long..."" and so on.
....3.  ""Writers Interview"" (4 minutes) Gatiss and Moffat talk with each other about the characters.
....4.  ""Creating the Look"" (32 minutes) Commentators include Danny Hargreaves (special effects supervisor), Mark Gatiss, Sue Vertue (executive producer), Natasha O'Keefe (plays The Bride), Lisa Heathcote (food stylist), Ben Mangham (locations manager) Steven Moffat, Sarah Arthur (costume designer), Amanda Abbington, Gordon Seed (stunt co-ordinator) and Jean-Clude Deguara.
Among other scenes, see an Afghanistan battlefield created in a serene English field. There's filming at the hedge maze at Longleat. And the fun of converting a modern London road into a Victorian outside scene. Per Mangham, it took 3 1/2 weeks of preparation for one morning of filming.
....5.  ""Sherlockology Q&A"" (21 minutes) Short Q&A sessions with Amanda Abbington, Una Stubbs, David Nellist (plays Mike Stamford), Sue Vertue and Steven Moffat. Per Vertue, it takes about 25 days to shoot each 86-minute episode. That explains why we have such long waits in between series. Freeman and Cumberbatch are busy actors.
To the people who don't like how ""Sherlock"" has messed with the Sherlock Holmes canon, these comments by Moffat are interesting: ""We have no desire, no interest, in doing anything that is totally wrong for Doyle.... We're not gonna massively contradict him. I mean, minor things, like what century it's set in, yes, but ... the canon... isn't a restriction. It's an amazing platform.... It's not a cage. It's a stage.""

Last, but not least, am I the only person bothered by the 221B on the outside of the boarding house? Shouldn't it be just 221?

I was pleasantly surprised that the soundtrack had an Dolby Atmos track for added High Fidelity and immersive, you are there feeling. The picture quality of this Blu Ray disc is outstanding. As of late, Amazon and Netflix have really come a long way with the picture quality of their streaming services. I wish they would upgrade the soundtracks to allow more immersive sound for our cinema. Again, the Blu Ray disc has outstanding picture quality. The colors pop and the picture is smooth and very sharp and detailed. Love this disc.. A great addition to our growing optical disc collection. One wall of our home cinema has Blu Ray and UHD 4K discs and two other walls are lined with racks that hold my very large vinyl record collection. Last count on the vinyl is around 5000 discs.

7330964,5,B0119OFSGQ,If you like Sherlock then you have to get this episode. If you haven't seen previous Sherlock episodes then a lot of this would be almost impossible to understand. It's a departure from previous shows as it's kind of a Christmas special. It's Sherlock in real time and at the time Conan-Doyle wrote the episodes. It switches back and forth so as usual you really have to think it through and keep up. I've watched it a few times and caught new things each time (plus the British accents make it necessary for me to watch these episodes at least twice). I've seen the other Sherlock episodes probably about 15 times so I'm a huge fan. Others may not be as insane as I am.,1500508800,2,670,4.368

7330982,4,B0119OFSGQ,"This story standing all by itself is original in a way because it shifts constantly from what happens in the modern world and what happened a century ago or more. It is nothing but the story of a wife killing her husband but the murderess knows about the stories of the old Sherlock Holmes and she is going to trap him in an old story indeed, that of the abominable bride.

Sherlock shifts from one period of time to another by using some drug, cocaine or heroin is not the point, to reach a state of consciousness that makes him cross centuries. And he is going to solve the case by this plying between the present and the past. He will be induced into believed Professor Moriarty is back and he will have to go back to that special event when he dies the first time in the water chute somewhere in Switzerland within a confrontation with Moriarty there.

This visit to the past event will give him the true answer to the question: Is Moriarty still alive? After all, why not since Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson are themselves still alive. Then the present crime is nothing but a simple riddle for primary school children that Sherlock Holmes solves in two seconds, maybe less.

This passing from the 21st century to the end of the 19th century and the beginning of the 20th century gives the story some dynamism and makes the suspense eventful and active. It even enables the film to give the possibility to suffragettes of the older time to speak their minds against the male dominated society they live in.

Thats good and entertaining. But from the outside, since we are the audience hence outside the plot itself, it is quite common place to suspect the wife of a murdered husband, and the situation is so simple that there is no other suspect and no other solution. That makes the whole film an attempt to wrap a very simplistic story into a complicated set of slips, underdresses and dresses, and we, like mice in a big wheel of Swiss cheese, get lost in the lace.

So this film works because we are such a good audience that we forget to remain critical and attentive. Just what Sherlock Holmes constantly says: keep awake, keep attentive, keep concentrated, don't scatter your brain power. But unluckily we do, and actually luckily for the film itself.

The story itself was pretty good - however, the feminist point of view was not in keeping with the times. It is in keeping with the 20th and 21st century - but really not the 19th Century England.  Please do not take that as a slam on the woman's POV - but if you study history, you will see that some liberties were taken.

7331021,4,B0119OFSGQ,"There were parts of the film - in fact most of it - that I thought were excellent; but there were other parts where I felt that the writers tried too hard to be clever. The film is about Sherlock dreaming that he is participating in a murder case that occurred over a century ago. The parts that I liked were the usual deductions that Sherlock made. I also liked the plot which focused on a woman who commits suicide and then supposedly returns from the dead to kill people. I also liked the humor, such as Watson saying that Sherlock always says something, Sherlock saying he never said it, and Watson saying you say it all the time  and Watson was right.
What I did not like was Sherlock's brother persuading Watson's wife to do something and she does it. People should not try to have one spouse deceive the other. What she does adds nothing to the story. Sherlock figures out where the perpetrator is without the wife's help. I also thought that the reason for the murders, to publicize a certain thing, made no sense. It certainly would not have helped the cause.",1483488000,,1068,4.448979591836735

7331052,1,B0119OFSGQ,"This was truly the worst Sherlock episode I've seen out of every Sherlock media including film and other episodes entirely. It was pedantic, dull and misogynistic.

Granted. How could I saw such a thing when the character took such pains to speak up for the 'invisible army'? That's because the episode was set in 1895. The suffrage movement didn't begin until just before the start of World War I, which was around 1910. And to those that argue this was a dream....Sherlock has demonstrated the ability to access a Mind Palace (loci) through the process of lucid dreaming. And using logic, given that he has an eidetic memory, he would know a movement like this one would be out of place and not in the context for the period of time, it represented.

Nevertheless, none of this seems to matter as the writers for the show had these women act in violent extremes and wear KKK hoods when Sherlock confronted them, which is an insult to those persecuted by the KKK....i.e. initially Irish Catholics and then black people. Sherlock also proceeded to tell these women precisely just how they were suffering because only a 'white male savior' could do that instead of the women themselves.

It's a demeaning insult towards women but I have come to expect nothing else from Steven Moffat for whom wrote Sherlock based on an idealized version of himself, while the writer has been quoted to say that women hunt for husbands, become grossly fat when women become pregnant and childbearing is a disgusting, smelly and tedious venture.

This show series has declined in quality this last series because Moffat cannot write more than two dimensional female characters and of course, his character can never be beaten.

Anyone reading this, do yourself a favor. Quit watching this series and any series Moffat creates. Stop listening to the messages that women are either trying to entangle men and have no purpose but finding a man to put a ring on their finger.

And please don't follow Sherlock's advice to trip on narcotics and a host of other drugs to dally along in the past. Have we not learned from Heath Ledger and Cory Monteith that mixing medication can lead to fatal consequences?

And as other reviewers have said, it does not advance the plot at all. You could skip this episode and be no worse for wear. Along with other reviewers, this is an hour I will never get back. Fortunately not ninety minutes since I skimmed out of sake of sheer boredom.",1474156800,4,2451,4.73943661971831

It's a confection, a valentine, an extended joke, a clever mystery, a riff on friendship, and a nod to classic ghost tales.... with a dollop of social conscience and a lot of laughs thrown in.  This show has been plagued by a vocal fandom which has grown to feel a kind of ownership about the series... and a desire for the creative to team to deliver only what they are expecting and wanting....personally.  Well, I for one take great delight in this genre bending, time traveling, creative tour de force of  great writing, acting and production values.  So much so that I watched it four times.

7331070,3,B0119OFSGQ,"Although not a fan of this series, I couldn't resist watching an episode in a true Victorian setting. Maybe this review would carry more weight if I'd watched the rest of the episodes, but it is what it is. Oh, and it contains SPOILERS, so be warned.

The first half was actually rather good, with an intriguing mystery, lush ambiance, and creditable performances. There were even a couple of downright chilling moments for the viewer. I enjoyed the trick of presenting the murders as a stage and the Baker Street rooms as the audience. I even forgave the intrusion of the orange-pips into a tale where they obviously didn't belong.

Then came the second half, and it all went to smash. I was treated to a surreal barrage of disconnected scenes that at first left me wondering what was going on, though before the end, I began to wonder why I should care. It was meant to tie the film to the series, but all that business with Moriarty (the least Moriarty-like Moriarty I have ever seen anywhere), had nothing whatever to do with the tale that was supposedly being told. I found it not the least bit entertaining. And the grave-digging scene seemed to be inserted for nothing more than a cheap, cheesy shock to the audience.

Even the primary plot, that of the Abominable Bride, was not quite resolved to my satisfaction. If I'm to sympathize with the murderer, as we were clearly meant to, I'd like to know what the two husbands did that deserved death. I'm all for Victorian reticence; I think it's a wonderful thing. But some hint would've been appreciated, such as a black eye or some such. Am I supposed to cheer the murder of a man as well-deserved when all he did was sneer at his wife's needlepoint?

So, the first half was worth watching, the second half was not, in my opinion. Hence my middle-of-the-road rating. The principles looked swell in their Victorian togs, but a coherent script would've been appreciated.",1470614400,2,1925,4.652941176470589

7331085,3,B0119OFSGQ,"I pre-ordered this DVD as soon as it became available but only just now sat down to watch it.  The reason is because I had heard such terrible things about it.  Well there is good news and bad.  The bad news is the The Abominable Bride is easily the worst of the 10 installments of the modern Sherlock franchise.  The good news is that it is not nearly as bad as some have said.

The episode is not perfect by any stretch of the imagination.  While the mystery itself is intriguing the execution is sloppy and at times confusing.  At its worst The Abominable Bride borders on self-parody. There is also, at times, a been there and done that vibe that pervades this installment.  It also trades in some of wit and humor of other episodes in favor of much darker, gloomy and eerie tone (which is not in and of itself a bad thing)

What you do get is all the faces you love to see although not exactly as you are used to see them.  In addition, you get top-notch performances, as youd expect,  from Messrs. Cumberbatch, Freeman, et. al. You also get a well-realized rendition of 19th century Victorian London and some extremely satisfying cameos.

There are two big reveals in this episode.  One I will mention briefly but the other only reference.  The first is of a bloodthirsty cult of radical suffragettes.  This seems silly, forced and its only purpose seems to be to give the characters the opportunity to sermonize on the chauvinistic mores of the Victorian England.  The other reveal is how The Abominable Bride acts as a bridge between series three and the upcoming series four of Sherlock and I will not say any more as not to spoil the surprise.

All in all this was a weak but serviceable entry in the modern tales of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson.  Its worth watching for th bridge to the fourth series and as a much needed fix as we all wait with baited breath for more Sherlock.  Ill give The Abominable Bride a 5.5 out of 10.",1467763200,,1939,4.426553672316384

7331097,5,B0119OFSGQ,"Absolutely brilliant ""time slippage"" for Sherlock.  It's not a true redo, putting Holmes and Watson into their original story period.  It's a constant time slippage going from present day to period and back more than once, covering Andew Scott's  ""Did you miss me"" tag at the end of the season, the Reichenbach Falls, the relationship between the two Holmes brothers and more, neatly wrapped up in the mystery of the Victorian bride who won't stay dead.  The series at top form.  One ends hoping this won't be the last time Holmes and Bilbo go back to visit their ""roots"".",1465344000,4,572,4.737373737373737

7331112,5,B0119OFSGQ,"An excellent production and one very difficult to successfully carry out a drama in two ""time"" periods, but successful, it was. The BBC Sherlock is by far the best of the modern day Sherlock Holmes series and that includes the current Holmes motion pictures.

That meant I didn't need to wait for months for the arrival of my Blu-ray. Okay bonus material, but I'd have liked to see more ""behind-the-scenes"" technical details regarding the Baker Street scenes.

7331161,3,B0119OFSGQ,I like several BBC series shows and Sherlock is one of them.  That being said I felt this DVD film jumped around a lot and the story was just OK.  It is certainly something that I will never watch again.  If you are a fan of the series you should see it but I didn't feel that it was that great.  The acting was good but the plot and the jumping around was overdone.,1458518400,2,366,3.9054054054054053

I wasn't sure what they were doing with the story line at first, and by the end you get the feeling that the writers had written themselves into a corner last season and wrote this one just trying to figure out how to get out of the mess they created. Its sad that what was promised in last season ending was just hype. What was even sadder was this is the entire season and we will have to wait another couple of years to see what really happened.",1456876800,7,649,4.118110236220472

This applies to important, quickly uttered lines that are hard to catch, the loss of which severely detracts from the episode and makes later moments confusing (for example, Sherlock murmuring ""Redbeard"" but the subtitles reading ""Made me""). It also applies to standard conversational lines. At one point, Moriarty refers to a gong as a gun according the to subtitles, changing his line into something that makes absolutely no sense.

This is completely unacceptable. Consider that any number of people depend on these subtitles, and, with this sorry excuse for captioning, the episode as it should be becomes inaccessible to them.

7331265,3,B0119OFSGQ,"Just as we have a TV series with Holmes and Watson brought into the modern world, the British have done the same thing.  However, in this special, they mix scenes of the Victorian Holmes with the modern Holmes in one of those situations in which you are never quite sure which version is real and which the result of a drug trip.  Does Victorian Holmes have visions of the future or is the modern Holmes dreaming of the past?
I am not a great fan of this sort of delusion, hence the three stars.  That said, it is well done, with most of the effort going into the well shot events in the Victorian era.  That and good performances saved this from being a complete waste, but I would much have preferred a complete Victorian movie, with a complete modern version acceptable.  The mix is distracting and not worthwhile.",1455408000,7,817,4.456375838926174
7331266,5,B0119OFSGQ,"Now, I must preface this with the caveat that I am a HUGE Sherlock fan (every iteration and adaptation, starting with the original stories) so that biases me a bit.
That being said, I have heard some complaints about the trite (and very obvious) gimmick they used to place this in the Victorian era.  I have also heard ridiculous theories about this possibly being the 'reality' while the modern adaptation is the 'fantastic' one.  I just roll my eyes at those.
Maybe I am just too much in love with symbolism, psychology, and the abstract, but the thing I love most about this special is that we see things NOT as they 'are,' but through the filter of Sherlock's perceptions.  So his opinions and observations of other characters are more pronounced, his flaws and fears given form, and things that he has been unconsciously observing are being worked out 'on the side,' providing what I feel is probably a lot of foreshadowing for season/series 4.  I came out of this not so much feeling like I had solved a case or been provided information of something 'real,' but that I knew his character so much better.",1455321600,6,1110,4.6479591836734695

7331271,1,B0119OFSGQ,"This was very poorly written and it reeked of trying to squeeze more money out of the fans, as it came to a conclusion that didn't need an entire episode to go over. They could have easily taken one of the old books and turned it into an episode, but instead they pandered to feminists (and failed to do so anyway, because feminists weren't happy with this as a whole) and wrote the characters terribly in order to do so.

The press surrounding this has them proudly boasting that this is ""proper gothic horror"", but it's not. It was slightly haunting at best, and that was over once there was an explanation of how it happened - SPOILERS AHEAD.

[SPOILERS: A bunch of women (feminists) decided to kill men to get some ""revenge"" on them that loses a lot of ground because there is no on-screen abuse (or hints towards it) whatsoever. Without their word, (which is made up because it's all in Sherlock's head) all you know is that a bunch of women killed some men. And that would be fine if they didn't try to act like it was a righteous act. I love me a cult group, but not when it tries to be more than it is.

Truthfully, a long while ago, I might have received this better, but considering the time that we're in and all of the conflicts concerning feminism and gender politics, this special cannot pretend to pass itself off as the story that it holds. It is the show and the people in it demonstrating where they stand, and it's just one other thing that has been tainted by this entirely. And regardless of what side I stood on, I would still be as disappointed as I am now. The writers seem to be entirely unable to keep their politics out of entertainment.

Sherlock Holmes is made to look just as bad as a guilty wife-beater himself for reasons beyond my comprehension. Because he used Janine? I know very well that he would do the same to a man - that is his character. Why they didn't have a man as a Janine-like character, we know already. The writers are too obsessed with finding a romantic partner for Sherlock Holmes and, never mind the fact that he doesn't NEED one, they do not have the balls to ever make that person a man even when most of the fanbase would not care. Either that or they themselves just so desperately want it to be a woman. I do not care either way, but I know that this show would never give Sherlock Holmes an appropriate life companion that could suit his character without changing it drastically. The companionship needn't even be romantic or sexual. In truth, I think that it's what the man himself would need/want if he were real.]

SPOILERS OVER.

Because of this special I will never watch this show again outside of the first two seasons. Thankfully I already own them and no more money will be paid to these utter idiots. The level of contradiction to their own plot is astounding, and it's ever-present in the third season as well.

I do not even know if I will ever be able to watch the first two seasons ever again, but I hope I will, because I happened to actually enjoy them.",1455235200,4,3029,4.369449378330373

7331291,5,B0119OFSGQ,"""Sherlock"" travels back in time to the London of Queen Victoria to solve a crime that seems to have been committed by a murderous ghost.
It wasn't, of course, but then it couldn't be: After all, if the solution were that simple this case wouldn't be worthy of the great detective.
Instead, ""The Abominable Bride"" is a fascinating examination not only of the famous detective's legendary deductive and observational skills but also a sharp commentary on Victorian attitudes that have a bearing on a 21st Century case.
Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are, as always, wonderful as Holmes and Watson; the costuming and scene setting are excellent and the pace of this episode is designed to keep viewers ""in the moment"" without rushing them through the story. The dialogue is witty with the normal give-and-take between Holmes and Watson and some equally interesting exchanges between Mary Watson and the doctor.

While I consider myself to be an educated person replete with nearly eight decades of life's experiences, this flick did not flick my switch.

Others have waxed on and on, some eloquently others giving it a go, regarding their collective disdain for the movie.  Suffice it to say, I am in their camp insofar as finding this production hard to follow, difficult to understand (English vs. American English) and as far fetched as that expression can go.

I suppose my disdain is more for those who put this production on the screen as opposed to the cast.  Having only been drug induced while undergoing surgery, I have absolutely no appreciation nor desire to be ""entertained"" by those who recreationally partake.  Not my thing.

Positives:  Beautifully filmed.  All the actors performances are really well done.  The core case of the the abominable bride would have been a really good episode on it's own.  Negatives:  Is it a parody, a pantomime, a hallucination, a procedural, or a drug induced dream.  As usual, with a Stephen Moffat production, 10 pounds of stuff in a 1 pound bag.

I honestly wish everyone who has it or has seen it, loved it as much as I did. I think it's rare that when an audience has to wait so long between seasons (Battlestar Gallactica was utterly unacceptable by the end) it's writers/producers show sympathy for the fans and then work their asses off to give us something so well-crafted to tide us over.

I found the ""bridge"" between the here and now and the story they were telling in the 1800's to be both well thought out and creatively constructed. So as to give us just enough information to tide us over without giving too much away. It's a tight line to have to walk and I thought they did it well.

The women involved actually have a cult with a gong, and an underground chamber where they chant and wear red Ku Klux Klan robes and hoods.  They do this when the aren't killing men via faux ghosts.  God help us.  Why are they screwing up this wonderful series?

7331347,4,B0119OFSGQ,"This is a difficult series for fans as all of the players have major responsibilities outside of Sherlock.
The result is that fans have long waits between seasons or we get a single episode that may not be what we are used to getting.

This is as much we need to keep the series alive and everyone under contract as it is a story.
In keeping everyone under contract, they do a great job as everyone appears at one point or another.
In terms of a story, the results are mixed.  This is definitely a bridge episode picking up where the last season left off and preparing us for the next season.
However, this takes place in the 1890s, not current times, which requires some sleight of hand to maintain the story line.
It might have been better to do a 1890s Sherlock without trying to link things.
The linkage produces something less than a complete story and made this less satisfying for me.

Now for the good things!
This episode is great fun, with some really good dialogue and interesting incidents.
Seeing the characters is like meeting old friends making this an enjoyable DVD for a fan.
London in the 1890s is well done and a period Sherlock Holmes is always worth seeing.

Is this worth buying?
If you are a fan, Yes!  This is enjoyable, fun to watch and can be viewed more than once.
However, this is not the place to start watching Sherlock nor can it be viewed as a standalone item.
If you are new to the series, start at season one and watch this after youve seen season three.",1452988800,6,1488,4.3963636363636365

7331349,4,B0119OFSGQ,"CAUTION. SPOILERS. NOT HORRIBLE SPOILERS BUT SPOILERS. THAT MIGHT ACTUALLY HELP YOU FIGURE OUT WHAT'S GOING ON. Sherlock and all his castmates are set in Victorian London. Sort of. Wait. This is confusing. Are they in Victorian London? This doesn't make much sense. I almost expect him to pull out his cellphone in Victorian London. No, he gets... Telegrams! Yeah, okay, that translated well. Oh, I get it. He's having a dream. It's set in present day. Back at the end of that last series. In the plane, remember? Exile? Something like that? He got in trouble at the end of that season, right? Can't remember exactly? Naw, me neither.  Oh. Wait. So he's... oh, right, he was an addict in one of the shows. and the book. Ok. But it's kind of a lame tool nonetheless.

In English? Not the strongest Sherlock ever, but it's still Sherlock. And it's got some clever moments, some references to the earliest episodes as well as the current season. It's a bit confusing to say the least, and a couple of the tricks and tools are weaker than usual, and I can't figure out why all the actors look so much older. Did they really age that much? Are they supposed to look so much older? Or are the cameras just better?

It's not the next season, fyi. It's a movie for the in-between seasons. (Next season comes out next year. Every other year. Yes. You have to wait.)

There are a few special features that I haven't gotten through just yet, but the first one didn't hold my attention as long as I wanted it to. I'm a special-features nut, but that's not to say that I want to hear Mark Gatiss interview the cast members in an uninteresting way. You could at least intersperse it with more footage. Or tell us--no, SHOW us--more about how the film was made, and instead of saying that the casting is perfect (DUH), tell us how you found the actors.",1452902400,,1837,4.474626865671642

7331352,3,B0119OFSGQ,SPOILERS FOLLOW. I feel bad giving this episode only three stars. My family and I are huge Sherlock fans. The 1895 mystery was introduced well; it was intriguing and even a little scary. Then it was wrapped up rather too easily by Holmes. The interplay between modern day and the 19th century was confusing and developed nothing in the way of the current series.,1452902400,8,362,4.671875
7331353,5,B0119OFSGQ,"I felt like a complete fool!  Everything I read and heard leading up to the premier of the show led me to believe that this was a complete one-off.  That you needed no prior knowledge of the show to enjoy and understand it.  So I talked my WHOLE family into watching it the night it premiered on TV.  Needless to say that wasn't quite right.  This episode is called a ""one-off,"" but if you haven't watched Seasons 1-3 you will be utterly confused.

Now, on to the show!  I really enjoyed it.  When I watched it the first time, when it premiered, I felt a bit confused as to what they were trying to accomplish, until the end of course.  Then I watched it a second time (I DVR'd it) and really got into it the second time around.  Then I watched it on Blu-ray the night I received this order to see if there were any big things cut-out, and I really didn't notice anything.

I think getting to see the characters in a setting that matches the world when the books were written was great.  They did an outstanding job putting it all together.

The special features were pretty nice too.  Seems to be more special features on this one special than the season discs.  But it was really cool to see how the pulled everything off to make this episode happen.

Also, I got the Season 1-3 collectors edition set for Christmas, so now I'm pretty much obligated to keep the collection current!",1452816000,3,1383,4.34375
7331354,4,B0119OFSGQ,"Sherlock: The Abominable Bride [Pay Per View]

Having completed two wildly successful seasons of Sherlock Holmes on British television, Benedict Cumberbatch [Holmes], Martin Freeman [Dr. Watson], Andrew Scott [Moriarty] and company take their show on the road to a feature length movie.

I assume everyone felt the need to somehow top the superb one-hour TV episodes.  Top them dramatically, in storytelling, and of course in length as well.  Some strains are seen under that demand.  The plot became quite elaborate and I found it a little hard to follow.  Other viewers might have the feeling theyd need to watch it a second time around to catch all the details, as I did.  The TV series started out posing the question: suppose there were a Sherlock Holmes in modern-day London, pretty much like the Holmes of Arthur Conan Doyle fame in a past century.  The movie kicks this up a notch, imagining, it seems, that both the 1800s Sherlock and a contemporary Sherlock are real, and shifting back and forth between the settings as it tells its story.

As for plot basics: the title comes from the nature of the murder(s).  A beautiful married woman, badly done by her husband, publicly appears with a gun to confront him.  She threatens to shoot him but ends up turning the gun on herself and blowing the back of her head off.  Shortly thereafter her GHOST appears to kill the wayward husband.  How can it be?  Holmes and Watson are drawn into solving the crime.  Along the way Watsons wife, Holmess mysterious older brother Mycroft, the hapless Scotland Yard investigator, the woman coroner with a crush on Holmes, the landlady, Moriarty and virtually everyone weve come to know in the TV series also are added to the plot.

If you don't mind an impossibly dense plot and cant get enough of the joy of watching superb acting and charming characters, you're going to like this movie.  B+.",1452816000,2,1887,4.792569659442725

his close friend and colleague 'Dr John Watson' (Martin Freeman) by his side.
The brilliant mind of the eccentric sleuth will be put to the test...
D.I Lestrade (Rupert Graves) tells 'Sherlock' of a bride 'Emilia Ricoletti' who'd committed suicide returning to kill her
husband who had wronged her.
Impossible, of course ? ....though 'Sherlock' had thought the case was now closed the mystery returns some time later
when it seems 'Emilia' has returned to kill again....but why ?
Now awake, 'Sherlock' has a need to go back to 1895 to complete his investigation....
Things will become more unexplainable when 'Moriarty' (Andrew Scott) becomes a part of the nightmare can it be that
his arch-enemy has returned ?
I did find this an unusual 'Sherlock' tale possibly falling short of the excellent BBC series's that had gone before, however
remaining very watchable.
Playing the role of the sleuth who's logic is second to none is in my mind a role 'Benedict Cumberbatch' was born to do,
i can think of no other modern-day actor who could portray 'Sherlock' better.

But in order to fully understand all the little hints and hidden meanings, one has to think about and observe what they hear and see, and probably even watch it more than once.
And I think if a show can make you do that, if it can encourage you to watch it not once, but twice or more times, that's when it's brilliant. Go and do that, come up with a plot that people watch and talk about long after it's aired, it's anything but easy.

The plot is the process of finding out key answers to questions that have been in play since the series two finale, and recently the third series finale. Plus, there was such great and painstaking insight into Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's works, and some of these things were given a quiet, delightful nod, for those who enjoy the novels that started this excellent adaptation that is what we know as the series, itself. Now, what I found particularly wonderful was the character development. We go deeper into each character, seeing what makes them tick (as well as what some characteristics might have been, during this show's era).

While many things are played for a laugh on the surface, they actually have a deeper purpose. The fandom has already been writing reams and reams of meta on this.

I know of no other show that has so much subtext and layering. How appropriate for a 'detective show', that the viewer is given so many clues, codes, and hints about things to come.

The first and second seasons, while not perfect, were very enjoyable and I really like Cumberbatch as a modern day Sherlock.  Sadly, with that said, I cant help but say that this episode was terrible.  It continued the downward spiral that began in season 3.  Mr. Moffat and Mr. Gatiss say that they love the character of Sherlock Holmes.  But although Cumberbatch has a lot of dialogue right out of Canon,  the similarities seem to end there.  The writers twist and turn Holmes into a drug addled looser who is only made great by Watsons imagination.  In fact, although Mycroft sometimes refers to Sherlock as the slow one, it turns out that both the Holmes boys are the slow ones, and Mary Watson, whether in the past or present is the smart one.  While the Holmes brothers wander around in circles, Mary is busy uncovering a dangerous pro-suffrage group in the past and in the present, on  her cell phone hacking into the governments most secure websites without working up a sweat.  Case closed.
 In truth, the first hour of the show was not too bad, with some clever dialogue.  But even there you could see the feminist propaganda emerging and by the last half hour it was pure feminist crap.
 How very disappointing it was to see Sherlock made out to be a buffoon and to emphasize his drug use to such an extent that it was the basis for the whole episode.
 Obviously this episode along with season 3 were all made to please new generation of fan boys and girls who are more interested in everyones relationships and who everyone including Sherlock might sleep with, then a true mystery that only Sherlock Holmes can solve.  I am sure that season 4 will only be more of the same.  Its sad to see this happening.",1452124800,13,1833,4.539634146341464

*It does affect the on-going story arc, as certain qualms are laid to rest going into Season 4
*It is set in the 19th century -- except when it isn't.

Setting all that aside, or maybe because of trying to do too much of it, this episode isn't up to the usual quality of this show, in my opinion.  I admire the concept, and some parts certainly are fun when you compare the 19th century characters to their 21st century counterparts.  But the ""abominable bride"" story wasn't particularly engaging, and Sherlock's mental exercises were frantic and confusing rather than riveting.  Maybe I'm just getting too old to keep up.

7331386,1,B0119OFSGQ,"An open letter to Mark Gatiss and Stephen Moffat:

When I first heard about a new Sherlock Holmes television show several years ago, to be produced by BBC Wales, I was thrilled. Ive been an avid reader and collector of literally thousands of stories about the original true Holmes since I was a boy in the 1970s. Soon, however, I was disappointed to see that it was going to be set in modern times. This has been done before in several films, so it was not a new or original idea. Additionally, there have been shows such as House that lift many Sherlockian aspects, giving us even more versions of a modern Holmes. The thing these modern versions have in common is that they are not actually about Sherlock Holmes, a character born in the 1850s, and working as a consulting detective in the Victorian and Edwardian ages. These modern takes are instead about a character that has the same name, a few personality quirks, and little else.

Of course, when I first saw Sherlock I was mightily disappointed. Still, Im just one voice, and it went on to be wildly popular, with many people arguing that it didn't matter if it was set in the correct era, as long as the characters had the correct names. I have to disagree with that. As Ive explained before elsewhere: Imagine a new movie re-make featuring a character named Luke Skywalker, who lives in a dusty desert Old West town and meets a crazy old prospector/ex-soldier named Ben Kenobi. They find out about a girl that needs to be rescued, and they hire a roguish wagon driver, Hans, and his big hairy unintelligible tobacco-chewing side-kick (named Chew Bacer) to take them somewhere. Then, there is some big-shot with a pun-like name similar to Darth Vader who has a Death Train  kind of like the one in the Lone Ranger movie  and so on. The character names are the same or very similar, and there are all sorts of winks and nods to the original fans, showing that the creators are very familiar with the original material  as the Bard said, The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose  but if its not actually set in the stars, then it isn't Star Wars anymore.

As the show Sherlock progressed, many people who had initially enjoyed it came to dislike it, as it wandered farther and farther from Sherlock Holmes, becoming a shrine to how clever Gatiss and Moffat think they are. As things currently stand following the end of Season 3, Holmes is a murderer and Mary Watson is a global assassin. How does that fit at all with the true Canon?

When it was first teased that there was going to be a stand-alone episode of the show, setting Holmes and Watson back in the correct Victorian era, I was cautiously optimistic. Gatiss and Moffat stated in interviews that they had the chance to film Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman as Holmes and Watson the way they were supposed to be, back to basics. Photos were released throughout the process showing the actors in period costume and on appropriate sets. Over and over, it was indicated that this was going to be a unique episode, wherein Holmes and Watson would be in the correct time period, with no explanation whatsoever. It would be completely separate from the modern-day version, which had concluded Season 3 by sending Sherlock, that modern-day alternate universe simulacrum of the true Holmes, into exile following his cold-blooded murder of a rich criminal.

On the night of the premiere, January 1st, 2016, the episode ran in England five hours before appearing in the U.S. Before the 9pm showing here in the U.S., I had four emails from friends warning me, including one that indicated there were some modern aspects. However, we settled in to watch. The first hour was okay. It was exceptionally well filmed, I didn't mind some of the snappy in-joke dialogue, and I didn't object to the film techniques of reenacting the crimes as seen from the sitting room, or having Holmes grab the floating newspaper articles in his mind. I thought that was the modern part that I had been told/warned about.

And then, at around the one hour mark, that exceptionally terrible actor  and I cant overstate that fact enough, hes simply awful  Andrew Scott, shows up as a Moriarty hallucination. The room starts to shake and rock, and suddenly were back on the airplane in modern times, where Season 3 left off. My blood pressure spiked in anger so much that my head hurt, and  to paraphrase a character in A Study in Scarlet   I believe I would have had a fit of some sort if the blood had not gushed from my nose and relieved me. Actually, I didn't have a nose bleed, but I probably needed to.

For it turned out that Gatiss and Moffat had  no surprise here  proven to be liars.

The next half hour devolved into a mess in which Holmes was drug-hallucinating the whole 1890s segment in order to figure out how Moriarty in the present had supposedly survived. It then went through a whole round-about of dreams within dreams  a concept blatantly stolen from Inception  and alternate realities wherein the modern version might be a story told by the 1890s Holmes or the 1890s version might be a drug hallucination from the present  a concept blatantly stolen from a Deep Space 9 episode, and probably a number of other things blatantly stolen that I don't even recognize.

In the end, I wasn't surprised, as Gatiss and Moffat just cant help themselves. I don't watch Doctor Who, but I can only imagine the pain felt by some of those true fans as these people ruin their character too. I do know that when Gatiss adapted the Poirot episode The Big Four, he stated that the novel that it was based on was an almost unadaptable mess. He certainly unadapted it, all right. In fact, he ruined it.  There were parts of it that should NOT have been changed or eliminated, but of course he did. Theres a reason certain books and characters are beloved across generations, and it constantly amazes me that script writers like Gatiss think that they can do better than the original authors when messing up original material that has millions of loyal followers for a reason.

When I rewatch this  and I will  I will only watch the 1890s segments that relate to the Ricoletti investigation  most of the first hour, and a very few pieces from the last half-hour  and ignore the modern dreck tacked on to it. Ive had to do this kind of thing before. For instance, Ive re-read several times the first two chapters of The Last Sherlock Holmes Story by Michael Dibdin, but I go no further, as the rest of the book is a spurious addition that only damages Holmes. The same is true for Sherlock  To paraphrase Doyle: It takes peoples minds from better things.

Im here for the true Sherlock Holmes, and not to see Mr. Cumberbatch say something snarky or cute while wearing a cool coat. I could not care less specifically about Benedict Cumberbatch, et al. Ive never in my life watched a film or TV show just because it had a certain actor in it. I watch for characters. It doesnt matter to me if Indiana Jones is played by Harrison Ford or Sean Patrick Flanery or River Phoenix, as long as they get the character of Indiana Jones right. Cumberbatchs Holmes was almost right for 2/3s of this film, as close as some other actors have come, and the whole thing could have been really great  the first time that Cumberbatch had actually played the true Holmes on screen  but then they went off in the weeds. And then they went off a cliff.

Gatiss and Moffat claim to love the Canon and be experts, so Im not sure why they make blatant Canonical mistakes in the tolerable 1890s portion. These include having The Blue Carbuncle being recently published, as it actually appeared during the time Holmes was presumed to have died at Reichenbach, and having Mary still around post-Hiatus. However, many Holmes films, novels, and stories also make these same errors, so this cant be held against them too much.

Ill admit that there are some wonderful visual images in this film that will fit in my own personal Virtual Reality Machine. Baker Street with snow falling, foggy manor house grounds, loads of atmosphere, screen shots reproducing Paget drawings, and so on. But even that cant save this film in the end. As a long-time reader of Tarzan, I can tell you that the character is extremely intelligent and well-spoken, a British lord who effortlessly moves between society and the jungle. He is nothing like the mealy-mouthed goof portrayed in the Johnny Weismuller films. Still, there are many visual shots from those films  alligator wrestling, elephant riding, travel through trees  that are useful in the aforementioned Virtual Reality Machine when I reread the original Tarzan books, and no doubt there is something salvageable from this film too in that regard.

Finally, I should mention that I optimistically bought tickets to see this film in the theatre on January 6th, 2016, Sherlock Holmess birthday. They were very expensive ($18.00 apiece) and as near as I can tell, that doesnt benefit any charity at all, but rather goes right to the pockets of Gatiss, Moffat, and their posse. My initial reaction was to stay home after seeing what they had done to it on television, but Ill probably go, just to enjoy what I can of the 1890s part of the film. But I may likely walk out after the first hour. Thats when the part thats actually about Sherlock Holmes will be over, and when they're showing the rest of that hallucinating mess set on the plane, I can be driving home.",1451692800,50,9464,4.641532016756433
7331387,3,B0119OFSGQ,"Leading up to tonights much anticipated Victorian episode I read an interview with Steven Moffat in EW where a reporter asked him how will Holmes function without a Smartphone? As Charlie Brown would have said  good grief. This reporter certainly demonstrated their ignorance of the source material. The original 4 novels & 56 short stories written by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle are set roughly between the years of 1880 to 1914. Telegram dispatches took the place of cell phones. Horse drawn dogcarts & trains were their automobiles.

(Phones & cars did eventually infiltrate the later stories and the mysteries lost some of their style as the Victoria era gave way to the 20th century.).

So, IMHO the Robert Downey action movies are fun but hollow interpretations. Should you look up the Rathbone/Bruce movies of the 1940's focus on the first two. The remaining installments jump forward in time and are laced with wartime propaganda. I end this opinion by imploring you, should this Abominable Bride stimulate your interest then by all means track down some Jeremy Brett. In terms of staying loyal to the original tales the quality of this (198494) ITV Granada series is unmatched.

Rating: A weak 3stars. Why? I feel this crossover episode had some truly inspiring components. But there were also some very chaotic ones as well. With no snub intended towards Mark Gatiss, I think sometimes Steven Moffat can fall victim to his own brilliance and these shows...Sherlock, Doctor Who...can run amok and become slightly disjointed.",1451606400,21,1528,5.075697211155378
7331388,2,B0119OFSGQ,"*** THIS REVIEW CONTAINS MAJOR SPOILERS ***

Having expected yet another trainwreck after the debacle that was much of series three, and despite some strong criticisms which I'll touch upon shortly, overall, my initial impression of 'The Abominable Bride' began as a positive one. In the program's first hour it showed a dose of humble pie had been consumed after the disastrous, almost soap opera-esque turn the writers were taking with the last few episodes, and marked a nice return to something vaguely resembling a plot. It wasn't a particularly strong one, mind, but there were too many elements that were enjoyable or showed an effort to tie up those loose ends that otherwise might have been left hanging in the air.

Moffat & Gatiss went out of their way to write an entertaining episode that would cater to BBC Sherlock fans and at the same time delight us Holmesians; on that account, I really have to tip my proverbial hat at a mission well accomplished. Not only that, but the last few moments were such a heartfelt tribute to Mr Sherlock Holmes and Dr Watson, and that world where it is always 1895, that personally speaking, those few minutes redeemed the entire episode.

Forget the fog and gaslight for a moment. The characterizations are what count, and there was a subtle change in this Holmes & Watson, though much of their modern BBC counterparts remained. 'The Abominable Bride' succeeded very well in blending book! canon with the events of their own modern version, with nods to both in a mostly not-over-the-top sort of way. Not to mention the ending, with Holmes at the Reichenbach Falls... in all seriousness, that gave me the shivers. Watson coming to the rescue was nothing less than glorious, and an excellently played hand that I honestly could have applauded. Actually, the modern scenes woven into this episode gave us some very nice character moments without making it too soppy, and undid some of the damage from the not quite up to par characterizations that plagued series three. This was certainly not the strongest Sherlock episode, but the improvement was impressive, and hopefully will set a trend for its becoming a serious, intelligent crime drama once more.

And yet, if my honest opinion is to be put forward, a good portion of it was ruined for me due to the particular direction in which they took the suffragette angle. Allow me to explain.

At the denouement, we learn of a secret order of suffragists/general women's rights supporters who were somehow co-conspirators in Ricoletti's murder spree, because they felt disenfranchised or had been wronged by men/society at large. Sherlock goes on to condone their actions because obviously, if one supports the suffragette movement, murder is acceptable if a woman commits it when she has been unfairly treated and begins killing for a ""cause"". I truly, to the core of my being, hope that was not the intended message; that if you feel society has done you a wrong, it's perfectly fine to take the lives of people who make your own life difficult. Not only is it the best example of moral relativism at its finest, it actually *undermines* any support for the Victorian era women's rights movement they may have started out with. IMHO, it's nothing for anyone who believes in egalitarianism to be proud of.

It also took what could have been a reasonably good episode and just made me utter an unenthusiastic ""meh"" when all was said and done. That being said, it was certainly a step in the right direction, worth a watch, and gives me hope this series will once again reach the high standards it set in the first season.",1451606400,8,3617,4.825806451612904
7331389,5,B0119OFSGQ,"Although set in the Victorian Era 1895 the story is recognisably modern with more dramatic and overt violence. The film also evokes the Gothic landscape and atmosphere, with the mysterious and ghostly bride partly paying homage to Conan Doyles spiritualist beliefs. The film is convincingly 19th century and Victorian both cinematically and with its use of dialogue. However, it is more action packed than a traditional Sherlock Holmes story. Holmes is inflected to appeal to a modern audience balancing Victorian and modern sensibilities. Hes more glamorous, sexually appealing and dynamic than the traditional cool and cerebral Holmes. The film makers get the balance right by ensuring that Holmes isn't anachronistically modern. The Abominable Bride is likely to have wide audience appeal from Conan Doyle fans to readers and viewers of detective fiction and those who enjoy Gothic tales.

In some ways you see this version of Holmes as fuller with Holmes portrayed and a more complex and resonant character than the original. The Abominable Bride is much more than a few unforgettable lines and an attitude as Raymond Chandler suggests. The modern Holmes is an even more interesting character than the original and the plot of this film bares comparison with the original tales. This incarnation of Holmes is much more than a thrilling visual spectacular steeped is mystery and suspense.",1451606400,7,1391,5.294117647058823
7331390,5,B0119OFSGQ,"After watching the episode, I still have to spend time unfolding everything I have just witnessed. Once again, Sherlock does not fail to impress as we are pulled into a Victorian adventure filled with twists and parallels to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's own writing. I could not resist my excitement hearing direct quotes taken from the mind and words of Doyle as Holmes solves a new case.
Once again, the writers do a wonderful job captivating the audience with a new tale built from the foundation of one of my favorite writers who did more than write words in a book. The Abominable Bride has great parallels to a story from Doyle's Adventures of Sherlock Holmes ""the Five Orange Pips"". Similar to most of the Sherlock episodes, the writers use an actual story from the writings of Doyle and rewrite the tale so that even those who have read Doyle's own words are left trying to solve the case with Holmes.

I cannot give any spoils, because of all the twists and turns but definitely worth watching. The story begins with a twist on a well known encounter between two people who will be the best of friends and then quickly shifts to a case that drove Holmes to the point of madness. We meet a young bride who ends up killing herself but comes back from the grave to kill and terrorize England. There are no such thing as Ghost so the logical explanation is the plausible explanation. I will admit, I felt that the beginning felt rushed, but I found myself quickly becoming immersed as Sherlock captivated my attention until the end as the case unfolded and plots were unraveling.

If you are a Sherlock fan this is one episode you definitely should not miss. Everyone else should enjoy the new time period for an episode and remember, things are not as they seem.

Sherlock Holmes is on the Case.",1451606400,10,1797,4.574534161490683
