8654934,5,B00K0Q08CY,"Cookies, Choices & Kids is more than just a presentation by one of the worlds foremost child therapy and parenting experts  Dr. Garry Landreth  it is a crucial resource for both parents and professionals who work with parents.  I have used this video with parents I work with as a counseling professional, with graduate students I train as therapists working with children and parents, and as a parent (& a new grandparent!). This video teaches parents about setting limits with children, and giving choices  as a foundation for teaching responsibility and behavior management. It is a fantastic resource, developed by a pioneer in the child therapy and parenting world. A must buy for parents and professionals.",1401840000,2,712,5.112068965517241
8654935,5,B00K0Q08CY,"This video is an easy watch. Very informative and simple instructions to help your children become good choice makers. I love that I no longer have to yell to try to get my point across to either my teenagers or my toddler.  Different size choices for different size children!  It makes sense to prepare our children to make difficult choices when we cannot be there to guide them by giving them practice at home with everyday life. ""It's not what we do, but what we do after what we do.""  Parenting is not easy and we are not perfect but this video helps us to be better and help our children to be better as a result!",1400630400,,619,4.273504273504273

My husband even thinks it's great and has easily picked up the techniques.  My kids are thinking through their decisions more and I have seen so much more self control in their behavior.  This DVD would be helpful for kids of any age.,1400457600,3,370,4.5606060606060606

My kids are six and ten and I would give almost anything to have had this DVD when I first became a parent and had a toddler!! Dr. Landreth's insight and perspective is beyond refreshing, and it gave me a whole new outlook about how to REALLY understand my children.  I can't thank Dr. Landreth enough for the changes I have seen in my kids in such a short time frame. The Choices, Cookies, and Kids DVD has made all the ""would have been temper tantrums"" so much easier.",1400371200,2,576,4.373831775700935

8654939,5,B00K0Q08CY,I have watched the Choices Cookies and Kids DVD several times now and have even shown it to other moms.  This technique empowers children to make decisions and learn how to control their own behavior.  It will also help parents keep their emotions out of the equation.  I have seen this work with my own children and have heard many stories from other parents who have found relief in an easy to apply method that yields immediate results.  Dr. Landreth is enjoyable to watch as he shares personal stories that teach practical parenting skills.  Every parent needs to see this!,1400025600,5,577,4.73
