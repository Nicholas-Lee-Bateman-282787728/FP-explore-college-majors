2314049,4,B0009RQSSW,"First thing I have to say is - wow. I can't believe I forgot how much I love the Fraggles! Ok, that's out of the way.

Henson/Disney have struck gold in the last few weeks, first releasing The Muppet Show (See Review) and now Fraggle Rock. Between the two of them, my time has been pretty much occupied by those lovable creatures known to the world as Muppets.

Fraggle Rock's first season consists of twenty-four episodes that deal with the issues of the five major Fraggles, Gobo, Red, Mokey, Wembley (my personal favorite), and Boober, ranging from working and chores all the way up to near-death experiences, nothing you would normally expect from a typical children's television programming. The Fraggles live day-to-day lives of singing, dancing, eating doozer sticks, stealing radishes, and asking the Trash Heap and her two guards, who look like anteaters, for usually very unhelpful advice. The songs they sing are original, catchy, and are things you probably would find me singing as I walk down the street listening to my iPod.

As for special features, this set delivers just what I was asking for in my review of The Muppet Show. You get interviews with the muppeteers, as well as a walkthrough documentary showing how they do it. There is also a CD-ROM that came with the set that had desktop themes, wallpapers and screen savers. It is worth it just to see the Doozers walk on my screen building things.",1126396800,10,1419,4.783673469387755
2314050,5,B0009RQSSW,"Well worth the wait, and I hope the other seasons will follow soon.

After years of having only slowly degrading tapes of a few episodes to look it, it is fantastic to have great quality picture and sound.  For the first time I can even see in detail the pictures on Uncle Matt's postcards.",1126396800,5,290,4.351851851851852
2314051,2,B0009RQSSW,"I got my first season of Fraggle Rock from Amazon.com today and I love it!!  The only thing I wanted to mention is that amazon.com's version does not include the cd rom with the fun fraggle stuff.  I'm still happy, just wish I had that too.",1126137600,6,240,4.195652173913044
2314052,5,B0009RQSSW,"Got my copy of Fraggle Rock season 1 today,and I'm realy pleased. The episodes look and sound great. I was enjoying the single DVD's,but what I realy wanted was season box sets and my wish came true! And this set has some nice special features-Behind the scenes documentary narrated by Jim Henson,New interviews with Fraggle Rock cast and creators,and plus a Replica of Jim Hensons's Notepad. A very great and welldone set! I cant wait for season 2!",1125446400,7,449,4.769230769230769
2314053,5,B0009RQSSW,"These little ones are so cute and funny.  I'm really glad they're finally coming to dvd.  They were such a hit in the 80's and I'm sure all ages will still find them great now.  I don't have a favourite, they're all cute, but this would be a good dvd for you to buy for the kids or to watch yourself.",1125187200,4,300,3.8852459016393444
2314054,5,B0009RQSSW,"From the wonderful world of puppet pioneer Jim Henson, creator of the ""Muppets"" comes his most successful TV work of the 1980s  ""Fraggle Rock"". This fantasy series that had huge mass appeal across cultural groups, started with a simple premise, a workshop where inventor named Doc spends his days coming up with new ideas and his Dog, Sprocket, as curious as his master, peering into a large hole in the baseboard - there is something that lives behind the wall I tell you! Sure enough there exists a beautiful land bound together by Magic called Fraggle Rock. Through the hole and down the tunnel are the brightly lit caves filled with wonderful creatures, far removed from the world as we know it, were reality ends & fantasy begins. Front and center are the Fraggles, furry, fun loving, brightly colored creatures spending their days having a whale of a time singing, playing games, telling jokes in their simple care-free existence where the entertainment never stops!
More than 20 years after the series first aired on HBO, the word on the street is that all 5 seasons are planned for release, starting with Season 1 - All 24 episodes is set to hit the shelves with this 5disc set loaded with extras (as announced & possibly more might be added)

2314055,5,B0009RQSSW,"We-Baa We-Baa, Wa-pa Wa-pa, Garbage, Gumbage, Whoo-Pee!!

We've been writing petitions, making noise, and basically begging for this for almost a decade. It looks like someone finally heard us, and understood.

We are not just shopping for an episode or two for our kids. We are a generation of ""Jim's Kids"". We grew up on these shows, and even as children some part of us knew that Henson's (creator of the Muppets) Genius was only outweighed by his Wisdom..... and Fraggle Rock is where both meet in an wondrous philosophical party for you brain and your heart! We *will* show them to our children, and our children's children, but we will be right there by their side reliving every moment of the laughter and warm glow we felt the first time we encountered Jim Henson's amazing perspective of the world, and knew that (if no where else) we were at home in Fraggle Rock.

I am pre-ordering this RIGHT NOW, to make sure my message gets sent loud and clear in the cooperate executive language... here's my money, take it, please!

...just keep them coming, every season!.. right up until the end when all the races of Fraggle Rock finally discover that we are all interdependent, and none of us are ""silly creatures""... or at least not too silly to look at each other and completely understand that ""you're a you!""

.... Or at the very least, can I just have the Mud Bunny episode? ;P

Even if you have never seen this series, if you have children and are struggling to communicate an open-minded, non-religious-but-very-spiritual, value based, ethical, soically aware, fun loving World View...This is a MUST Have!! Given that it is Henson, the production quality easily rivals what is produced today, and the content has no rivals.

If you have seen the series, make sure you check out the amazon customer review that lists the episodes included in the first season. Right now it's the last one in the list.",1121126400,33,1909,4.731927710843373
2314056,5,B0009RQSSW,"I will always remember ""Fraggle Rock.""  My dad recorded most of the episodes for me, and when the Disney Channel re-played many of them in the mid 90s I watched faithfully every day before school.  Now that they're on DVD, I couldn't be happier.  September 6 can not come soon enough.  I have the three DVD currently available, but a complete box-set will be awesome to have.

There are no other children's shows that teach morality that are as entertaining as ""Fraggle Rock.""  Red and Mokey have been my heroes ever since I can remember.  I remember thinking to myself, ""What would Red (or Mokey) do?""

Looking back ""Fraggle Rock,"" it is very weird, but that's what makes it so wonderful.  Jim Henson was one of the most imaginative storytellers ever, and the only creature I can think of as loveable as the Fraggles or Muppets is Yoda.  But even Yoda is from Jim Henson's Creature Shop and let's not forget that Frank Oz worked with Henson and the Muppets.

The Fraggles are a great treasure that has been returned to the world.  Horray!",1120262400,12,1039,4.586956521739131
2314057,5,B0009RQSSW,"It's about time!! I have never been so exited about DVD, I was a child of the 80's and Fraggle Rock was always there. My sister and I would watch the shows. We still joke to this day about wondering ""Where Gobo goes when Gobo goes away"" It is about time the TV world know that we are looking for those old shows, and FINALLY they are giving them back.  This was a great show for children, and I am so exited to now be able to share them with mine.",1119225600,7,447,3.912087912087912
2314058,5,B0009RQSSW,"Fraggle Rock has been one of my favorite shows since I first saw it on the Disney Channel back in the 1980s. I have seen most of the shows over the years and have watched them numerous times on video tape. I am thrilled that the first season is finally scheduled to come out on DVD. I have enjoyed the DVD releases of the Fraggles, but I prefer to have season collections. Hopefully this first season will sell well enough for all 5 seasons and 96 episodes to be released, as well as the various Fraggle Rock specials - such as Down At Fraggle Rock.

I love the fact that the stories are entertaining, but also have a good moral to each story. With the different worlds shown with different creatures, there's a world and creature for everyone - whatever their tastes. Since each episode usually contained at least 3 storylines about the different creatures, I'll concentrate on the Fraggles in my below description of the shows.

The first 3 shows have appeared on DVD under the title ""Where It All Began"" and show #11 (Catch The Tail By The Tiger) on the DVD ""Live By The Rule Of The Rock"", but the other 20 shows of the first year have not appeared on DVD as far as I know.

The 24 shows of season 1 are as follows:

1. Beginnings (or ""The Beginning"") - the different creatures of the show are introduced, beginning with the human inventor Doc and his dog Sprocket (a Muppet-type dog) discovering a large hole in the wall of an old room Doc is converting into a workshop. Gobo (one of the main Fraggles) has the scary task of entering the workshop in order to retrieve the postcards his Uncle Matt sends as Matt explores ""Outer Space"" (the human world).

2. Wembley and the Gorgs - Wembley causes trouble for himself when he agrees with everyone - especially the giant Gorgs, who decide to make Wembley their own personal loyal subject.

3. Let The Water Run - The Fraggles try to get the water running again when the pool goes dry due to Doc turning off the water while he's doing repairs.

4. You Can't Do That Without A Hat - Boober loses his lucky hat and loses his courage along with his hat.

5. The Thirty-Minute Work Week - Wembley has trouble making up his mind what job he wants to do.

6. The Preachification Of Convincing John - Mokey gets Convincing John to help her convince the other Fraggles that eating the Doozer constructions is wrong.

7. I Want To Be You - Because Mokey is so popular, Red decides to be just like Mokey.

8. The Terrible Tunnel - The Terrible Tunnel is just a legend ... until Wembley accidentally finds it.

9. Treasure Of The Fraggles - Red and Gobo find a map to the Treasure of the Fraggles.

10. Don't Cry Over Spilt Milk - Doc boards up the hole in the wall, trapping Gobo inside the workshop.

11. Catch The Tail By The Tiger - Gobo, although scared to death by the idea, decides to leave Fraggle Rock to look for his Uncle Matt when Gobo hasn't received a postcard for weeks.

12. The Finger Of Light - Mokey has lots of trouble being in charge when she is made Ruler of the Rock.

13. We Love You, Wembley - Everywhere Wembley turns, someone wants him to do something for them - except Lou, who likes Wembley without wanting something from him.

14. The Challenge - Red is tired of Gobo being the leader and challenges his leadership.

15. I Don't Care - No one respects Boober's feelings and he is sick of it.

16. Capture The Moon - During the Festival of the Moon, Gobo is the Moon Greeter, but Junior Gorg steals the moon!

17. Marooned - No surprise to Boober ... his birthday is interrupted by a disaster!

18. The Minstrels - Cantus and his wandering minstrels tells the Fraggles that everyone must find their own song, but Red is having a diffucult time finding her song.

19. The Great Radish Famine - The Trash Heap makes all the radishes disappear to teach everyone a lesson.

20. The Garden Plot - Fraggle Rock is being attacked from two sides - by Sprocket trying to smash his way in with a mallet and Junior Gorg trying to pulverize it from his side.

21. Gobo's Discovery - Gobo loses faith in himself and decides not to be an explorer anymore.

22. Mokey's Funeral - Mokey tries to deal with the Gorgs' trap by herself because everyone thinks she's no good at doing practical things.

23. The Beast Of Bluerock - Wembley is afraid to go with Gobo to Bluerock.

24. New Trash Heap In Town - Although the message is to think for yourselves, Mokey becomes the new Trash Heap due to a misunderstanding of the message.",1117324800,375,4479,4.371531966224366

When I was a kid, Fraggle Rock was the single greatest TV show on the planet. Now that I'm grown up and have my own kids it warms my heart to see that they still think Fraggle Rock is the single greatest show on the planet.

It holds up so well after all these years. Both for kids and adults. This was one of the only kids show my dad would watch with me. I totally get why. It's not just watchable for adults it's downright entertaining!

The lessons presented in each episode are so well done. And they hit on important topics for kids like not lying, sharing, caring about your friends, etc etc etc. It's fun. It's wholesome. Its just one of the all time great shows ever.",1439510400,3,701,4.177777777777778

I'm happy that it is now available on streaming video, since I'm always looking for appropriate content to play for my autistic son who has a streaming video capable TV especially for him.

The younger your children, the better chance they have of being entertained. Even if none of the kids had liked it, I still think it would have been worth it for the nostalgia it brought me.

2314969,5,B0009RQSSW,"What else can you say?!  It's the Fraggles!!!

I watched this show back in the early '80s as part of The Muppet craze.  The first season was by far the best.  I used to like the catchy songs -- ""Dance your cares away!  Worries for another day!"" -- and the quirky characters such as the crazy old guy who was always building gadgets ""in the outside world"".

I was sitting with my son one morning watching Thomas & Friends when the promo came on for Fraggle Rock Season One.  My son said, ""What's that?""  I said, ""Fraggles!""  He laughed at the cuts, and seemed more interested in the promo instead of Thomas, so I ordered the Season 1 set.

Talk about a time warp!  The videography is 1980s to be sure, but the songs and episodes have an innocence that's not tied down by 21st-Century political correctness, the ""Everybody is a Winner"" crap, and ""Let's all learn to be apologists"" that is pervasive in children's videos today.

Gobo and friends still make me laugh, especially when they do something stupid or dangerous -- such as jumping into the pool, or being chased by the Gorgs.  It's a fun show, and even though it's almost 30 years old, my kid loves it.  Every night since the DVDs arrived, he has asked to watch ""The Rock"".

Let's face it: Jim Henson was a genius.  Fraggle Rock definitely stands the test of time.",1281571200,10,1320,4.4375

2314973,5,B0009RQSSW,"I was the target audience for this when it originally aired.  When I 1st saw it was available I hesitated to buy it, b/c I thought it might be one of those shows that was awesome when I was young, and just dumb now that I'm an adult.  Not so.  If anything, I have a greater appreciation for Jim Henson.  The songs range from Okay to Excellent.  I would say there was maybe one moment that I had trouble watching as an adult.  Not b/c it was bad, but b/c it involved something that was obviously targeted towards children.  But one moment out of an entire season for a show that was meant for children is pretty good.  In this aspect the shows themselves ranged from good to excellent. ""The Minstrels"", especially has some good songs, and ironically I suppose, the lone moment I had trouble watching.  The specials on this set are pretty good as extras go.  It was good enough for me to find my Amazon account info, and buy the second and third seasons, and pre-order the 4th (and Final) season.

What I enjoyed as a kid, I can now appreciate as an adult.  The puppetry is wonderful, the stories exciting but innocent, and the music, the music.... some of those songs have been floating around in my head for two and a half decades...  a lot went into this show that just doesn't get done now.

2314999,4,B0009RQSSW,"I remember watching Fraggle Rock on HBO when it first aired.  As a kid I loved The Muppet Show, so I figured that a new show by Jim Henson would be worth watching.  I haven't seen the show in years, so when I saw it was out on DVD I had to add it to the collection.  The only drawback is when you watch this or The Muppet Show or even old Sesame Street (Old School rocks!) you really see how crappy kids TV has become and how bad the whole Muppet franchise has become after the death of Jim Henson.  Disney has ruined the magic that Henson created.  I plan on showing this and The Muppet show to my kids so they can experience good TV.  Sesame Street has become one big Elmo sales pitch and the educational aspects have been dumbed down.  Very sad.",1200787200,,748,4.082191780821918

2315015,5,B0009RQSSW,"I am a big fan of Muppets. And personally, right now I like Fraggle Rock more than the Muppet Show, as someone else said (sorry about stealing your line.) I received 364 days ago (last Christmas) as a Christmas present. I have 3 plush Fraggles (Red, Wembley, and Gobo) and I can't wait for the movie coming out sometime in late 2008 or early 2009. You may find this hard to believe but I like it and I'm 14 years old.
  Now, let's talk about what makes this show fantastic. It's colorful, they make the characters so real, they have good music, I like the idea of a show taking place underground (you can only see so many above ground shows and movies) and the fact it's got puppetry and the overall sillyness.
  I could tell you about the episodes and 5 main characters but I'd rather let you find this out for yourself. And I have an important question- Will Red and Gobo ever go out?
  In short, great DVD, great show! BUY IT!!!",1198454400,,931,4.291428571428572

2315019,5,B0009RQSSW,"Loveable characters too (like a Jim Henson version of those 1970s Saturday morning Sid & Marty Krofft shows), and great, ultracatchy powerpoppish tunes...what's NOT to love???  This show can really appeal to all ages because each episode is about universal things, not really school-related stuff...not that that's a bad thing.  The show looks like it could have been made 20 years ago OR today...it's not dated at all.  Here's the surprise: I wasn't sure I had seen it when it was on cable TV back in the early-to-mid 1980s, and I was older than its original target demographic...I was 15 in 1983, so I basically missed it...yet I recall certain bits and characters...

This show is completely fresh and colourful, with fun, touching stories, AMAZING sets, anarch-ish energy, and the characters are sorta punkish and hippyish.  If you have a child, or have never lost (or wish to regain) your own inner child (like myself), you simply NEED this DVD set!!!

I loved how ""Fraggle Rock"" is so intricate, but simple and understandable at the same time, and oh so interesting...I wish I was a Fraggle and lived in their world, really!!!  I love to eat radishes, swim and play music all day!!  It's neat the way the Fraggles (the main 5 are really swell characters...Gobo, Boober, Wembley, Mokey and Red, as well as Gobo's Uncle Traveling Matt and the awesome Pipe Bangers), the huge funny dopey Gords, the adorable Doozers (sort of a 1980s Bob The Builders), and the hilarious antics of the Irish inventor Doc and his sidekick dog Sprocket (another fun Muppet)...oh and can't forget the hilarious Trash Heap and her 2 ratty sidekicks, haha, with her unique brand of ""wisdom"" and advice.  I love how it's all about friendship, morality, that it shows how these ""cultures"" are interdependent, and worldly but innocent and oh so ORIGINAL!!!

This show is not only nutritious, but it really can lift your spirits if you're in a bad/sad mood.

I REALLY need all 5 seasons, a CD/CDs of all the Fraggle tunes...that opening theme is unbelievably great, and a shirt with the Fraggles on it...hard to pick a fave character, but I really like the hat-wearing, sensitive, eccentric hippy Boober...his voice sounds like Kermit/JIm Henson...and Mokey is really sweet too, and kinda serious.

This show simply RULES...I want to introduce the Fraggles to my young nephews and niece, they will be hooked...NOW I know why this show has a fervent cult and appeal to punkrock kids of all ages...why wouldn't it???",1183593600,,2490,4.888361045130641

It's a little to early for my 3 1/2 year old to appreciate it but I'm sure in another year or two he will watch it over and over.  The packaging is what concerns me, the booklike disk holding system I fear will not hold up to frequent use and abuse from kids. I'd hate to lose one of the disks.",1182988800,,424,3.8068181818181817

When you call them, they'll take your name and address and mail you the notebook when more arrive.  I guess they've been out of stock for a while, so they're just shipping the DVD's minus the book.  So you can get yours by calling.  But the DVD's themselves are great and bring back so many memories.  I liked TV more in those days when it wasn't political or obscene.

Both our 11 month old and our 3 1/2 year old will be entertained for as long as we keep the fraggles playing. The storyline and characters are interesting for a children's program and often teach about friendship and teamwork. All the characters do a lot of singing, with our 11 month old bopping and singing along. The 3 year old adds ""fraggle"" characters to all his creative play. I recommend this dvd to all parents who are looking for some entertaining and age appropriate television that they can also watch and interact with their child.",1179014400,3,622,4.513274336283186

However, the great quality means a very high price! I decided to sell some DVD's that I don't watch anymore for Amazon credit, and I used the credit to buy this. I highly reccomend this plan for others.

This was one of the best kids shows of the 1980's and it's still great today. Lots of great songs, very funny humor, cute puppets, interesting characters, and many great stories. I hope the entire set gets released.

The only kids show that I liked more than Fraggle Rock was the old Sesame Street.  While Sesame Street taught me a lot about letters, numbers, some science, etc., Fraggle Rock taught me about relationships, plain and simple.  Read what Henson wanted to accomplish with Fraggle Rock, and you'll see why it was so successful.  The Fraggles, Doozers, and Gorgs were interconnected in ways they were completely unaware of.  Any action by one of the groups affected the others in unforeseen ways.  This demonstrated the interconnected nature of society to me in ways that I could never have foreseen then, and it can teach your kids the same things today.

2315056,5,B0009RQSSW,Dance your cares away...what an intelligent and creative show! Very seldom did it feel the children were being talked down to...the writers put feeling into the various beings who made up Fraggle Rock.  Each was not a cartoon but a being who despite their quirks were acceptable as beliveable.  My oldest loved it...she is an adult and still has her collection...she would never part with her friends.  The lessons they taught were not force fed but were left out there for children to find as they explored the rock.

2315058,4,B0009RQSSW,"Fraggle Rock is probably Jim Henson's most complete work.  This cable TV series from the 1980s spanned several seasons and told the story of a world separate from humans; the world of fraggles.  Found behind the wall of Doc's workshop, these puppet creatures sing and dance all day long and have escapades among their own, and among other creatures.  The two central characters are Gobo and his uncle Matt.  Matt is an explorer and wonders out into the world of man, ""Outer Space"" for fraggles, and learns about the ways of our world.  He relays his observations back as postcards to Gobo.  Gobo in turn has his own adventures.

Each episode is 1/2 hour long, and self-contained; though all the episodes stream together.  Each episode is filled with music, dancing, singing, and simple and subtle insights into the intricacies of relationships, and how one views the ""other""; i.e. how we deal with new individuals and behaviors.  Overall, a good series that is entertaining for the whole family.  This reviewer bought this multi-disc set at Target for under $30.00, and the package with souvenirs such as notepad with reprints of notes Jim Henson wrote when developing the series.",1163289600,,1180,4.944162436548224

2315092,5,B0009RQSSW,"Although I am a little too young to have first watched the fraggles back in the 80s, I grew up watching the episodes on tape, and they will always have a special place in my heart. So finally owning all of the episodes from the first season (and hopefully all the box-sets after that) is brilliant.

Since there has already been a good summary of all the episodes posted, I'm going to do a general review of the series so far...

Fraggle rock is a wonderful, musical slice of fun for anyone, regardless of whether or not you're a fan of jim henson's muppets (although it probably helps if you are). Although its storylines and morals are technically aimed at under 10s, it rides along with a very witty, thoughtful script that adults should be alble to enjoy and relate to as much as kids. Nothing is ""dumbed-down"" the way things so often are in kids shows; the characters deal with some rather complicated issues and they themselves are deceptively complex. However, this is all played over a fuzzy, colourful, and downright cute fantasy underground world where everyone eats radishes and sings all day.

The story sets off with young Fraggle Gobo's uncle leaving the underground safety of Fraggle Rock to explore the human world (or ""outer space"" as it has been christened by the fearful Fraggle community), and he leaves Gobo with the task of collecting his postcards every week in order to learn more about the strange outside world. But in each episode the real action takes place not in our world, but the colourful fantasy world of the Fraggles, full of wonderful and terrible creatures, massive caves, and lots of music. And this action mostly revolves around five young fraggle friends and their relationships and adventures.

The main character, Gobo, never appealed to me at first, since at first glance he comes accross as the standard ""brave, does-everything-totally-right leader"" cutout type, but as the episodes progress, it becomes obvious that even he has doubts about himself and his abilities, and his difficulties with overcoming these problems give his character a great deal more depth. Gentle, thoughtful, and empathetic Mokey is the most mature of the fraggle characters, and usually acts as the parent/sister figure to the younger fraggles. Red, the other female fraggle, will probably prove alot more popular with younger veiwers because of her childish energy, and her brashness makes for some very entertaining episodes as well, as do her turbulent relationships with her fellow fraggles. These characters are all very likeable once you get to know them, and they are played with a great deal of energy and obvious enjoyment by their puppeteers (who also provide their voices with great skill), but the spotlight really has to go to the fraggles Wembley and Boober; if it wasn't for their respective ""wembling"" (Fraggle for ""indecisiveness"") and worrying, FR just wouldn't be the same. They provide the majority of the comic relief, and the episodes involving them usually prove the most absorbing. Other great recurring characters worth a mention are Marjorie the tash-heap-oracle-who-isn't-really-an-oracle and her two wisecracking shrew-like assistants, Gobo's Uncle Travelling Matt who wanders the human world outside Fraggle Rock in what seems to be a permenant state of confusion and wonder, and of course the human Doc and his amazingly human-like dog Sprocket, whose problems often mirror the problems faced by the Fraggles beneath them.

Since this is an episodic, Saturday kids show, with another four seasons to go, the characters don't develop a great deal across the episodes, but within each story they each learn important lessons about life and prove again and again just how close they are and how much they care for each other, and this makes for some sweet and even genuinely emotional moments such as in the episodes ""marooned"", ""I don't care"", and ""catch a tail by the tiger"". But it never becomes preachy or melodramatic, and there's always enough comedy, colour and music to keep the series very lighthearted.

Since Fraggles love to sing, the songs featured in the series are very important. Although sometimes I did feel the writers just shoved a song in rather awkwardly at the last minute, all the music is of a very high quality considering there's generally more than one song per EVER episode. This will delight younger kids, but older veiwers may find themselves skipping the songs so they can get on with the cute, funny storylines uninterrupted.

The Gorgs, the ""bad guys"" of the series, are also certainly very well-done (a mix of people in costumes and animatronics that can be seen the the later Jim Henson production DINOSAURS) but I found the episodes centered around them just weren't as fun or interesting, but thats just my opinion. Its ironic that the basic puppets managed to keep my attention far better than the technically advanced, more over-the-top gorgs, but thats just the way it is.

This DVD boxed set is of very good quality, with a few extra goodies such as an original Documentary, new interviews with the cast and writers (one of whom, Jerry Juhl, tragically died shortly after filming these interviews), which should please all the die hard fans that cult success has brought this excellent show.

Fraggle Rock is genuinely smart and funny, with wonderful, well-played, throughly likable characters, catchy music and a large, diverse world that both reflects and opposes our own. Okay, so it never really captures Jim Henson's original vision of being a show that ""creates world peace"", but lets face it, nothing could have done that really, and why complain when the end result is so good anyway?

Good bits:

+ A colourful puppet-world that is still showing very few signs of age over two decades on

+ Tons of songs that the little'uns will sing and dance along to

+ Surpisingly three-dimensional characters and a disarmingly sweet storyline that can be very moving at times.

+ Its just downright funny, more so than so many ""adult comedies"" out there

Bad bits:

- The gorgs probably just won't prove as interesting to older veiewers as the Fraggles and Doc will

- Could have done with a bit more character development across the whole series. I KNOW the writers could have done that if they'd tried.

- A few plot inconsistencies, but you'll spot them if you're careful

- A little too many songs, and not always at the right moments

Bear in mind all these bad points aren't particularly important at all, and Fraggle Rock definately adds up to more than the sum of its parts. I give it a very deserving 5/5.",1151884800,7,6602,4.93063063063063

Uh ...don't thinkg that is true.  Disney did not purchase the rights to Jim Hensons' muppets until after he died.  In the 80s, the Disney channel did not play Jim Henson shows, because they did not have a partnership.  Jim Henson died May 1990. RIP.

On other thing I wish they had on this set is the ""Muppet Morsels"" like they have on the Muppet Show set. I'd love to see the background stories ""close captioned"" while the episode is playing without something like voice overs that intrude on the dialogue.

I remember watching Fraggle Rock as a youngster back in the 80's & wanting so desperatley to live amongst the wonderful fantasy world that was Fraggle Rock.

Now, even though I am no longer a youngster, nor are my friends, we can take ourselves back to that awesome place. Jim Henson & his team had such an amazing vision for these characters, & watching it back again now, it is all still just as relevant.

Along with the DVD comes a special gift. A replica of Jim Henson's original notepad! What a Treat!

Reading it, I can feel the excitement Jim must have had writing it. Just to get a behind-the-scenes of how it all started & how Jim wanted it be produced is fantastic.

Thanks for the availability of the DVD, now all the new kids of the world can enjoy Jim & his amazing vision & talent. And all the ""old"" kids of the world can keep watching. Join Gobo, Wembley, Boober, Mokey & Red on their journey. It's so worth it!",1131235200,2,1064,4.278606965174129

I used to watch this show when I was very young, and I loved it then, but I think I love it even more now.  There's just nothing else like it.  The stories, the characters, and the music are all energetic, upbeat, and positive, but there are real messages about tolerance and empathy behind them (Jim Henson's goal, when creating the show, was to promote peace on earth).

And everywhere you look there's something new and fascinating to discover in this world.  The Lost Treasure of the Fraggles.  The Terrible Tunnel.  The Festival of the Fraggle Moon.  Fraggle Rock is a richly detailed and layered environment, and it's easy for me to lose myself in it, even twenty years later (and older).

And lastly, the music in this show was fabulous.  Beautifully written and performed, and it doesn't sound like ""children's music.""  I wish more of it had been released on CD.",1131062400,5,977,4.654970760233918

2315159,5,B0009RQSSW,"24 episodes filled with Fraggle sillines, great songs, themes worth considering and a whole lot of pure delight! Fraggle Rock has been one of my favorite shows since it first aired, and I was just a little kid. The inherent wisdom of the show can not only teach kids about important and complicated matters in life - yet in a simple way, but also learn adults to think twice every now and then. Fraggle Rock should be mandatory to watch for all of the worlds leaders, and earth would be a better place to live, for humans and animals together. :)

The video/audio quality is good considering the source. At first glance, the colors might seem a little too bright, but I've really come to appreciate this, somehow the bright colors fits the world of Fraggle Rock just perfect! The audio is also good, but of course, it's not THX-quality, and expect some noise. It's  really not a problem though, and ironically, the only times I noticed the noise was when the noise gate kicked in.

What's more to say? The box feels expensive, the bonuses is cool, although you should be aware that the CD-rom is not included with the box from amazon. And well, make sure to get your own copy, you won't regret it!",1128988800,3,1197,4.506912442396313
