Though watching these shows often make me wish my high school life could of been as interesting as this but oh well I still have it to watch! If you love comedy with a bit of romance and action this is definitely for you! Highly recommend!,1412208000,,332,4.442622950819672
8064744,5,B0009PLM9O,"For those of you that like FMP, you'll love Fumoffu. It is pretty much just a high school love comedy. It's FMP minus the mecha and evil dudes. It's pretty over the top, but way fun. The animation is just as good if not a bit better, and the soundtrack is also great. In Fumoffu there are also some new and colorful characters introduced. We also get the pleasure of seeing new sides to some of the old ones. I simply love FMP Fumoffu and I hope you do too.",1353888000,,457,4.088888888888889
8064745,4,B0009PLM9O,"Full Metal Panic Fumoffu is different from the main series,its more funnier than the main series and definitely worth it if you liked the first season.
This DVD comes with 3 episodes,episodes 4-6,creditless opening and ending and a little paper board game for fun.",1244851200,,264,5.0227272727272725
8064746,5,B0009PLM9O,"I love this series, and this particular DVD is probably my favourite. I was laughing so hard that I eventually haad to stifle my outbursts to avoid frightening the unsuspecting neighbors. Without knowing the background story (""Full Metal Panic!""), I began watching this series, and despite my lack of initial understanding it became easy to cheer for the romance of Sousuke and Chidori between fits of laughter. If you have seen the first DVD, get this one; it completely blows the first episodes away. And, knowing Seargent Sagara, that could be literal.",1156377600,2,555,5.043478260869565
8064747,5,B0009PLM9O,"To begin with, it is definitely a very good show, something that I will explain later on.

Let us start with the outline of the story.

As the rest of the DVDs, this one has three stories going on:

1) In the first episode, Kaname will get frustrated that Sousuke doesn't get her feelings for him. And old friend of Kaname's will show up who will ask for her heart. In this episode Sousuke will also realize his feelings for her. And the stage for the grand entrance of Bonta-Kun is set (a Teddy look alike thing that Sousuke wears for cover.... Anyway, you will laugh when you actually will se it in action).

2) In this episode Sousuke and Kaname will be assigned by the student's director to kick out from its room, the Karate club. Guess what, `fair fights' like fists against shotgun will be next followed in escaping a chainsaw-wielding janitor who turns nuts.

3) The third episode is when Kaname and Sousuke will pay a visit to a `hunted hospital' with unpredictable outcomes.

Overall, FMP Fumoffu concentrates more on the `ordinary school life' and on comedy, in contrast to FMP which balanced between comedy and action with Mechas. Nobody dies but it is funny as hell.

Additionally, the current series combine comedy, romance and action. As for the voices, either you hear it in Japanese or dubbed, both versions are very satisfying.

Last but not least, the price is the usual one that is charged for separated DVDs, in contrast to FMP 1st season that comes out in a box set and is much cheaper.

As a side note, the last FMP series that is out there is called FMP overload and currently available only on some other sides which for obvious reasons I cannot name here.

The final question:

Buying it or not?

Having watched all the series, my humble opinion would be: Yes and I highly recommend the shows.",1148428800,4,1819,4.563076923076923
8064748,5,B0009PLM9O,"Full Metal Panic? Fumoffu Volume 2 may very well be the greatest DVD ever created.  It is not however without competition.  Volumes 1, 3 and 4 all give this a run for it's money.  This series finds the perfect balance of humor, romance and action.  That perfect balance being 98% humor, 1.5% romance and .5% action.  I'm not sure if I have ever laughed harder than when military gun nut Sosuke Sagara disguises himself as Bonta-Kun (A big amusement park costume, just do a google image search to see it.) to conceal his identity from Kaname Chidori, the girl he is trying to protect, and then after completely blows his identity by firing a gun at the gangster with a knife at Chidori's throat.  Go and get Full Metal Panic? Funoffu episodes 1, 2, 3, and 4 as soon as you possibly can.  If you have a store that has them nearby, then get in your car right now and get them so you won't have to wait for Amazon to deliver.  Unless you don't find a gun nut stealing a Bonta-Kun suit and crotch stomping city gangsters amusing.",1138924800,4,1024,4.380952380952381
8064749,5,B0009PLM9O,"As a fan of Anime for almost 5 years, I like to think of myself as having very refined tastes - when I first saw this DVD on the rack at Best Buy, I thought to myself ""Well, this looks like a Do or Die show - either a smash hit, or a total flop. I was intrigued enough to buy both Volume 1 and Volume 2 at the same time, and I watched both that same night.

I really have to say, after the first volume, I was having trouble breathing because I was laughing so hard and so many times. But the Second Volume was absolutely brilliant - I have NEVER laughed so hard in my young life - not even at my favorite Marx Brothers film, or my favorite episode of Family Guy. This show is ABSOLUTELY HILARIOUS. It blends together that unreal comedy that can only come from Japan along with wacky action, fabulous characters, and great story development.

The episode 4 title ""Single-Minded Stakeout"" is an episode for the ages. It bears the typical resemblance to any romantic comedy, with the episode in which a jealous character follows his/her counterpart on a date with an old boyfriend/girlfriend, only to be forced to interrupt and save the day - revealing to the counterpart that the jealous character really has feelings for them - as has been seen in other Romantic Comedies (most notably: ""Please Teacher"" and ""Love Hina""). But with the surprise introduction of ""Bonta-kun"" (the cuddly bear whose seemingly Pokemon-esque dialogue of ""Fumoffu!"" is applied as the show's title), the episode takes a wonderful ride down a heart-warming trail of young love and die-hard laughter.

As most Anime stalls while trying to carry on it's plot with filler episodes, ""Full Metal Panic?: Fumoffu"" keeps the laughs coming with unexpected surprises - a quality investment and a real gem to have in a Collection. If you love Romantic Comedies such as ""Oh My Goddess!"", ""Love Hina"", or ""Please Teacher"", you'll ""panic"" to buy more of these great DVDs - just like me.",1122422400,16,1947,4.621387283236994
