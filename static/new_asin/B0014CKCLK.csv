8255074,4,B0014CKCLK,"I ordered this set to use during a cold war section in a high school history class.  There's a nice variety of videos to use and the students liked most of them.  They got a kick out of the black and white, old style, documentary and military productions.  I had a problem with the case that the dvd's came in, but the shipper took care of the issue.  It's worth buying...",1367020800,,372,4.197183098591549
8255075,1,B0014CKCLK,"A very bad old documentary. i wish I could give it zero.

8255076,5,B0014CKCLK,Good DVD for the money...Shows what America was like during the Cold War.  A must-have for anyone studying that era.,1318464000,3,116,4.8
8255077,5,B0014CKCLK,"This is a must have for those interested in the post WW II American Civil Defense programs. 1940s thru mid 1960s.

Great government films....many I saw as a youth, many are new to me....all are interesting.

This is a great collection. A must have for those interested in the topic.

Also a great value.",1274140800,5,303,4.574074074074074
8255078,2,B0014CKCLK,"I was not impressed by the quality of this item. Most of the vidoes seems of low quality. Interesting info but but looks like stuff I could have gotten off the internet for free. Plus, the information was useless for my high school students",1271462400,4,240,4.4772727272727275
8255079,4,B0014CKCLK,"Almost all of the movies contained on these three discs were made by the government during the early cold war.  If you are interested in either movies about nuclear tests, or survival after an attack, you will like this DVD.

It could have been organized a bit better, the movies could have been put in chronological order, for instance, so you aren't watching a movie about the H-bomb and then see something about the Hiroshima attack.

In fact, all the nuclear test videos could have been put on one disc, and another disc could have contained the movies concerning civil defense.

Some of the movies about the tests are detailed, but they tend to repeat themselves over time, and some have been edited, because- even 50 plus years after the fact- they contained some classified material.

The civil defense movies are a bit naive- everyone always survives- and if they are seperated from their family- they always turn up safe at another shelter.  However, a lot of what is presented about the dangers of fallout could still come in handy in today's ""dirty bomb"" environment.

A couple of the movies could have been excised entirely- one called ""This is not a test"" is a good example.  It's just a lousy movie with an A-Bomb attack as one of it's labored plot elements.

It takes 17 hours to watch all the discs, so stock up your fallout shelter and make sure you have enough batteries for your DVD player, and then enjoy.",1211328000,16,1425,4.645418326693227
