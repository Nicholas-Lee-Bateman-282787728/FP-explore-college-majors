4104598,5,B003ASLJLS,I haven't finished this book yet but I will be sad when I do. I feel like I am there throughout Clint's journey. It's written very well.,1301961600,,136,4.074074074074074
4104599,3,B003ASLJLS,"Documentary narrated by Morgan Freeman with Clint Eastwood commenting on his film career as an actor, a director and a song writer. He reviews his thirty-five plus year relationship with Warner Brothers studios and why he has always enjoyed working there. The film also focuses on his successes and personal favorites, including the Sergio Leone films, his role as Dirty Harry, the several successful westerns that he was in leading up to his masterpiece, The Uninvited. This leads to some of the more recent roles that he enjoyed and his second great film, Million Dollar Baby. With a tip of the hat to Invictus, Eastwood talks about what the future may hold.

The film presents a retrospective of much of Eastwood's career but there are notable holes in the material. Eastwood's non Warner Brothers material is skipped and we do not get a ton of personal information here. At times the film seems like a long promotional piece. That being said this was a good film that was done by Eastwood friend Richard Schickel as a promotion for the collection Clint Eastwood: 35 Films, 35 Years at Warner Brothers. The narration by Morgan Freeman was informative even though a little underwhelming.

As a free supplement to Hereafter  it was worth a look but unless you are a real fan its probably not worth a separate purchase.",1301529600,2,1319,4.827433628318584
4104600,5,B003ASLJLS,"Clint Eastwood is one of the few actors who can direct, produce and compose the music for his films. Many actors who try to do this fall flat on their face. However, Eastwood has proven himself time and time again through extraordinary films like ""Unforgiven"", Million Dollar Baby"", ""Letters from Iwo Jima"" and ""Gran Torino.""

""The Eastwood Factor"" is a documentary about Clint Eastwood's film career. While this documentary does not speak to Eastwood's personal life, it does a great job of describing Eastwood's notable films. The documentary also includes Eastwood himself speaking on what inspired him to make each film. Most appropriately Morgan Freeman who has co-stared in numerous Eastwood films narrates the documentary.

If you interested in documentaries or Clint Eastwood himself, you will find this documentary to be quiet interesting and entertaining.",1299369600,8,865,5.4
4104601,5,B003ASLJLS,This Eastwood Factor (Extended Version) DVD from the AMC Network is fantastic! Watched it when AMC aired it when they were honoring Clint's 80th birthday. This extendeed version is a must see and must buy!,1287446400,3,205,4.885714285714286

4104603,5,B003ASLJLS,"As soon as I heard the voice come from the screen I was mesmerized. That deep voice, thoughtful in its pauses, as if every word is well considered before delivery. One of the sexiest, and most easily recognized voices in the world. Not Clint Eastwood, although his low-pitched growl is still as recognizable as ever. Morgan Freeman. A voice that most of us would recognize immediately if he were speaking three aisles away in a crowded grocery store.

If the original Eastwood Factor was an intimate look at Clint Eastwood through the eyes of his friend and fellow filmmaker Richard Schickel, then the extended version, for all that remains the same, is a new and entirely different film. Morgan Freeman's deeply intellectual and slightly philosophical narration is driving the Eastwood Factor train this time. Freeman, a Hollywood icon in his own right, has worked closely with Eastwood on some of his most important films. Every project these two men have undertaken together has turned into Oscar gold.

In the extended Eastwood Factor Morgan Freeman and Clint Eastwood talk about the movie&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Invictus/dp/B002JCSWV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Invictus</a>, the 29th film that Eastwood has directed. Freeman says, in the omniscient voice of narrator, ""I developed the project and brought it to Clint""  the scene goes to Eastwood, sitting in his chair at home. ""He just calls me up one day and says 'I have a really good script I'd love you to direct'. Whenever somebody calls you up and says 'I have a really good script' you always go, 'Okay... We'll be the judge of that.' I read it. I called him back and said, 'It is a really good script. And yes. I'll do it.' This element of his history [Nelson Mandela] I don't think people are that familiar with.""

The combination of Eastwood and Freeman as storyteller is powerful. With Richard Schickel's insightful writing and unique documentary style they dig deeply into the heart of some of Eastwood's most complex movie characters like Dirty Harry and The Outlaw Josey Wales. They also cover films not included in the original Eastwood Factor: Invictus (2009),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gran-Torino-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B001KVZ6F2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gran Torino (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2008),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Flags-of-Our-Fathers-Widescreen-Edition/dp/B000M4RG42/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Flags of Our Fathers (Widescreen Edition)</a>&nbsp;(2006), along with an in-depth exploration into the 2006 film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Letters-from-Iwo-Jima-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JPKE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Letters from Iwo Jima (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>.

Based on the true story of Japanese General Kuribayashi Letters from Iwo Jima was filmed during an editing break for Flags of Our Fathers. ""The more preparation I did for that picture [Flags], the more I started thinking 'I wonder what it was like for the other side', especially after having traveled to Iwo Jima, and crawled through the tunnels of Iwo Jima, where the enemy was holed up."" It was Kuribayashi who built the tunnels that inspired Eastwood to tell the enemy's side of the story. ""He knew they were just holding out. He knew there was going to be no possibility that they would ever leave that island."" But there was one problem in telling this story, ""Actually, we don't know how Kuribayashi died... they never did find him."" Eastwood had to figure out his own ending, then work backwards editing in references to the pearl-handled Colt 45.

Between these two powerhouse actors the stories unfold, not only the stories behind the characters that Eastwood has portrayed and the movies he has directed, but the stories that have made him the director, and the man, that he is today.

On a personal level, Clint Eastwood discusses for the first time his life in Carmel, including Mission Ranch, the hotel/restaurant he owns and the Tehama Golf Course, which he built. This is where Eastwood has made his life, the community he calls home; a place where he doesn't feel encumbered by his celebrity. He also talks about his father, what he learned from him; that a man can be gentle and respectful and still be strong.

This type of temperament, a certain dignity, has long been a part of The Eastwood Factor as far as I can remember, that inner strength and assuredness is reflected in the characters that he portrays, as well as in the way he directs. It seems to be a part of his spirit, this confidence he seems to have in himself and in those around him. He is truly a man at peace with himself and with the decisions he makes.

Just after the release of the shorter Eastwood Factor documentary, filmed specifically for inclusion in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Clint-Eastwood-35-Films-35-Years-at-Warner-Bros/dp/B002Z7FN7Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Clint Eastwood: 35 Films 35 Years at Warner Bros.</a>, Richard Schickel touched upon this attribute in Eastwood also, ""He's not a man who I've ever seen acting as if he's under strain, do you know what I mean? I mean, he has evolved a way of making movies that is just a nice, steady pace. Unfrenzied. Unfrantic.""

I was reminded of those words whilst I watched the extended film, that easy-going attitude and absolute confidence, the humor, that has prompted actors like Angelina Jolie (whom Eastwood directed in 2008's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Changeling/dp/B001NFNFNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Changeling</a>) to say that Eastwood brings out the best in them. And I could not help but think, as I listened to the voices of Eastwood and Freeman deconstructing the characters in his movies, how true this seems to be of both of these men. Freeman and Eastwood both seem to be born of this caste, they both seem to have an understanding of their craft that goes beyond just being good at what they do, there is a sense that they understand the nature of people, a trait which cannot be learned, a wisdom that no age imparts. It is simply some 'thing' which lives inside them. A certain patience and peace that would prevent even the most neurotic actor from sabotaging a production.

It's little wonder that Richard Schickel and Clint Eastwood have had a deep and lasting friendship for so many years. Where on the surface Schickel, with his colorful humor and out-going personality, would appear to be the antithesis of Eastwood, there is actually a very strong symmetry in the way these two men think in terms of acting and filmmaking. Their philosophies, perspectives, ethics and appreciation for the art of filmmaking seem to be a simulacrum, one for the other.

The most compelling thing about The Eastwood Factor, the thing that makes you want to watch it again and again, is what I'd call 'The Schickel Factor'. When Richard Schickel sets out to tell the story of a Hollywood legend, whether it's on film, like his award nominated documentaries&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minnelli-on-Minnelli-VHS/dp/630292281X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minnelli on Minnelli [VHS</a>] (1987) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elia-Kazan-A-Director-s-Journey-VHS/dp/6304934394/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elia Kazan: A Director's Journey [VHS</a>] (1994) or in written form, like the highly acclaimed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Essential-Chaplin-Perspectives-on-the-Life-and-Art-of-the-Great-Comedian/dp/1566637015/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Essential Chaplin: Perspectives on the Life and Art of the Great Comedian</a>&nbsp;(2006), you can rest assured that no matter how many films you've seen on that person, no matter how familiar you may be with their history, Schickel is going to deliver something unexpected. A vivid, dynamic glimpse into their world; you'll see them as you never have before, you'll never see them the same way again.

With The Eastwood Factor (extended) Richard Schickel has proven once again his genius as historian, storyteller and documentary filmmaker. This is a film that promises to hold its position as the most enlightened and relevant introspective on Hollywood icon Clint Eastwood for years to come. It is a must-have for fans and should be requisite in the library of any young actor or director.",1275350400,41,8608,5.865814696485623
4104604,5,B003ASLJLS,Lots of clips from his iconic filmography.  And good interviews with this guy.  One of my favorite directors. V Good!,1400284800,,117,4.8
4104605,2,B003ASLJLS,This was a boring DVD. The life of Mr. Eastwood is far more interesting than this movie.  There was little insight into his personal philosophies on life and his mindset for success.,1399852800,,182,4.6875
4104606,5,B003ASLJLS,"35 films 35 years. There was jazz before Charlie Parker and after Bird. And there was a movie industry before Clint Eastwood and after him. He is a symbol of an era in showbusiness. He has become fame with his roles in the westerns rebelling with the cause, but even the westerns as a genre were not like they were after and with Eastwood. Telling the truth, he likes more the movies like The Bridges of The Madison County, Invictus, Gran Torino, Bird, Mystic River, Flags of Our Fathers and some other movies, focused on the relationships between humans, where the fate blows them to the unexpected situations. Which he loves. Some stories just were needed to be told. Including Letters from Iwo Jima. His number one according to his own words, ""His Cuishle"", is Million Dollar Baby, which is far more than just a boxing movie. And there is always some human factor in his movies. He likes the action as such, but he has shown through his movies, that there is no need for gun shooting and blood for to have the action.

 It is an intimate portrait of a legendary stormy career not just as an actor, director, producer, but also as an musician and composer, brought to  the spotlight by a historian Richard Schickel, who ventures beyond Eastwood`s tough, iconic screen personas to reveal the easygoing and thoughtful man behind the screen. An actor Morgan Freeman narrates this insightful profile that features memorable film clips and visits to movie locations and his hometown Carmel, where with humor, candor and intelligence, Eastwood illuminates the craft behind his legendary work on both sides of the camera to create a rare experience that is pure, unadultarated Clint. And we have the chance to step to the spotlight with him.",1389484800,2,1736,4.78

4104613,3,B003ASLJLS,"I bought this based on the reviews that suggested it gave lots of insight into Eastwood's directorial style; I was sorely disappointed.

This DVD is not well-written, and though the narration is voiced by the great Morgan Freeman, the dialogue sounds pretty-much forced.  So many of the clips seem to be headed somewhere and then, they simply fade to black and move on to the next clip.

Rent it or buy it used, but unless you absolutely must see some short clips of each of Clint Eastwood's films that are forced together in ways that don't entirely make sense, you'll be disappointed.",1331078400,4,586,4.7254901960784315
8393162,4,B003ASLJLS,"This is an enjoyable retrospective of many of Clint's movies but certainly not all of them. I would have included Play Misty for Me which certainly featured his best female co-star ever - Jessica Walter. Why he didn't hook up with her remains a mystery to me. But Morgan Freeman's narration is well done. There is nothing about Clint's private life and many wives and kids, just the movies. He describes how he was attracted to many of the scripts and that is interesting. Amazing that all of the movie costumes have been preserved which tells us just how much he means to Warner. What a loss for Universal!
Some insight into the financing and production of these would have been interesting. And I understand he is popular with Warner for coming in on time and on budget, hmm, Clint as a managerial accountant!",1527984000,,811,4.638888888888889
