It was written for kids, but I discovered it as an adult and it continues to be one of my favorite shows of all time.  It really captures the magic of being a child and growing up in the surreal world of the American suburb.

I encourage everybody that ever watched and loved these shows to buy them as soon as they are released because if they sell well, (according to TvShowsOnDvd.com) Nickelodeon is going to release other shows (beginning with Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Salute Your Shorts and You Can't Do That On Television). Other future releases I'm personally hoping for will be Welcome Freshmen, Hey Dude, The Secret World of Alex Mack, Doug, Rocko's Modern Life, All That (the original cast), Kenan & Kel, well, you Get The Picture (that show too!)

To put it simply, I would personally spend all of my life savings and risk not being able to go to work for a month because I have no gas from the money I spent on every show that ever aired on Nickelodeon (up to Figure It Out), after that, nothing does it for me.

Yep, Pete & Pete are coming to DVD. So, let's all wait until May 17th (which is now 2 very long months away) for this beautiful piece of angel exalted glory to be released.

2249048,5,B0007Y08LA,"I think I remember watching this on live TV as a baby but only remember bits and pieces of it though. Wasnt until I saw it mentioned on the Nostalgia Critics review of the NickComs I remembered it. Then I started watching bits of it on youtube because thats how they posted it I think. Also I got the first two seasons one Christmas and I heard theres another season but couldn't find it on amazon.

Anyway I heard this show started out as a bunch of shorts and then they made it into a show. It seems weird but not too weird to the point where it isn't relatable or bad. It also had both the overblown issues and views of kids and teenagers too which made it more relateable. It was also one the of the best shows they ever had at the time. Maybe even one of the the greatest they ever had. Had a lot of funny setups and good writing as well.

You can see this also on youtube in snippets just to see how amazing it is. I think they made 3 seasons and the final one might be on youtube probably because the DVDs didn't get many sales.",1434067200,,1035,4.04390243902439

So, while I loved watching Pete and Pete back in 1993 when I was 8 years old, I was skeptical again watching it as an adult. However, nostalgia got the best of me and I ordered these.

This show has stood the test of time.

It is every bit as enjoyable now as it was then. Additionally, I notice things now that were above me when I was younger. This show is insightful, full of amusing youthful angst, and funny. A great addition to my DVD collection. The episodes included in season 2 are:

1. King of the Road - Dad attempts to defend his reign of King of the Road while on a family roadtrip.
2. Day of the Dot - Ellen becomes obessed with being selected as the dot in the ""i"" of her marching band.
3. The Nightcrawlers - Little Pete and his friends attempt to break the world record for staying awake.
4. Rangeboy - Big Pete is embarassed to be working at Dad's driving range and dresses as a bear to hide his identity.
5. Tool and Die - Big Pete is put into shop class, much to his displeasure.
6. Don't Tread on Pete - Little Pete races the clock to study for a test while Big Pete takes part in an epic dodgeball game.
7. When Pete's Collide - The Pete's compete to inherit Dad's prized bowling ball, ""Rolling Thunder""
8. Hard Day's Pete - Little Pete goes on a journey to find who played his favorite song he only heard once.

2249068,5,B0007Y08LA,"I grew up on Pete & Pete, and based on those fond memories, I bought seasons one and two. Unlike some of my childhood and teen faves, this series has really held up. I've been showing them to my 9+7 year old nephews, who get interested in the episodes enough to look up from their gaming devices from time to time to watch the younger Pete's misadventures. Season one has one of my all-time favorite episodes ""King of the Road"", which makes my heart ache with nostalgia for summers off, ""Are we there yet?"" road-trips and the calm assurance that my mom and dad knew all there was to know in the world.",1388966400,3,601,4.327433628318584
2249069,5,B0007Y08LA,"What can you say about ""The Adventures of Pete & Pete?""
Well, nothing.  And everything.
It is by far the most important show of my youth, and adulthood.  It so perfectly presents the world as a kid views it from the way adults act to the way summer felt, that when watching it today I cannot help but feel that way again.  It tears down the barriers that we built as we grew up, and life is strange and beautiful again.  It reminds us to take silly things seriously and that serious things are often silly.  It's a perfect mantra to keep, and this show teaches us how.
And adding to the magic, it seems we all watched it.  In college, at the office, or even on a plane if the conversation shifts to television and ""Pete & Pete"" comes up, it's like ""You watched 'Pete & Pete'? I watched 'Pete & Pete', what's your favorite episode?"", and you have a new friend.  Across the country we all settled in to tune in to it as one.  It bonds us for life.",1388361600,3,945,4.153846153846154

2249084,5,B0007Y08LA,"If your on here with the thoughts of purchasing this DVD. 2 disc set. Then there's a 98% chance you already have watched The Adventures Of Pete & Pete! But for those who either only heard of this show. Or maybe stumbled across it on youtube. The Adventures Of Pete & Pete was a show which started out as just a short....It'd have like a little 2 minute bit between shows. And shortly there after, became it's own series! This DVD set is the first season. This show was awesome back in the early-mid 90's, & still holds up these days! My son has been hooked on watching these since I introduced him to the odd, yet funny characters. There's Big Pete, Little Pete, Ellen, Pete & Pete's mom & dad. And of course Artie, ""The strongest man.....In the world""! The quality of video & sound is aparently older quality. Not bad though in my opinion! They look & sound just like I remember back in the 90's. If you have a Blu-ray player w/ HDMI hook-up, & a LCD it'll look good! And if you still have a older TV &  DVD player....It looks fine too! This DVD set comes with bonus features. Which are the shorts I previously mentioned. And a few episodes. Including the long episodes, like where Pete, Little Pete, & Ellen attempt to become friends with Mr. Tasty. after trying...Mr. Tasty ends up dissapearing. Kids are going crazy, wishing Mr. Tasy would retuen with the awesome Blue Tornado Bars. Pete, Little Pete, & Ellen go into a searching frenzy for Mr. Tasty! It's a classic episode & one of my personal favorites. That, and the Nightcrawler episode. Where Little Pete takes a stand against his parnet's bed time set for him. He get's his friends to join him (Artie included). And they form a group that will stay up for days, playing flashlight tag, ect... They call themselves The Nightcrawlers! One by one, Little Pete's friends fall victim to being tired & pass out snoozing. If you watched this show back in the day you'll likely enjoy it just as you did before! And if your new to the series, you'll enjoy this the same! It's one of Nickelodeon's best shows from the 80's-current days.  I highly recommend this DVD! Also, if you remember this. You probably watched Are You Afriad Of The Dark? That DVD is also available on here. But the. One's you'll probably wanna get are on Canada's amazon. (Amazon.ca)",1339113600,,2307,4.516746411483253

This DVD release was unexpected but greatly appreciated! The slim DVD cases fit into a nicely designed card board slip cover. I love that they included some of the TV shorts from before the actual show aired and whenever a classic show has commentary... you've won me over!

2249117,5,B0007Y08LA,"It's obvious that anyone who has ever seen this show already knows how brilliant it is.  Even when one might think this perception is just the exagerations of nostalgia, one revisit will dismiss such notions.  I'm going to try my best to describe for anyone who isn't familiar w/it what makes this show so special and why I, like so many others, love it so much.
As much as I love many of the shows I watched growing up this one really stands out for me.  It is probably my all time favorite show.  This goes beyond the humor, wit, and entertainment it provides.  There are adult shows I watch now that have all those elements, but they don't have that extra something that this one has.  This series is, in a way, an embodiment of youth.  I think one other reviewer touched upon how it's life affirming, and it really is.  People mentioned getting misty, and that's exactly what I'm talking about. For me, just thinking about this show evokes a deep happiness and joy along w/ the massive nostalgia.  I can't really place what gives it this quality, but it probably has a bit to do w/ the quirkiness and eccentricity and that it was contributed to so much by so many artistic and creative people.  Who better to produce such a poignant and clever reflection of life than an artist let alone several?  Being that, over all, television is a creative medium (or at least should be) the production of more shows should be handed over to artistic/creative people.  If you have an appreciation for beauty in it's less recognizable forms and a sence of humor, you will love this show.",1186617600,3,1578,4.517605633802817

It is said that humor only works when it contains an element of truth.  And so Pete & Pete works as many levels, as it reflects on the experience of being young, and provides significant insights on the apparent comedy of the adult world.

2249132,5,B0007Y08LA,"I first began watching ""The Adventures of Pete and Pete"" as a kid growing up in the 90s.  The show instantly struck a chord (literally) with me.  The combination of narrative and whimsical tales that every kid ponders (International Parent Conspiracy, Outer Space, Independence, Love), to the great cameos (Michael Stipe, Iggy Pop, Steve Buscemi, Adam West, Kate Pierson), exposure to indie rock (which I still appreciate to this day), and endearing characters really made this show magical for me.

I'll never forget watching ""King of the Road"" and just giggling my head off while my dad watched next to me and laughed along.  There aren't many kids shows out there that can transcend generational gaps like that. I can still go back and enjoy these episodes at 24 as much if not more so than I did when I was a kid.  I think that says it all.  The commentary on the DVDs makes it just that much more special when you see how fresh this all was for the time.",1165622400,5,959,4.546511627906977

It's also got 2 Pete & Pete shorts ""The Burping Room"" and ""Mom's Plate."" I have yet to watch any of the special features, but I'm sure they're great.

In case you're wondering which episodes are on the dvd, they are:

- King of the Road

- Day of the Dot

- The Nightcrawlers <---my personal favorite

- Range Boy

- Tool and Die

- Don't Tread on Pete

- When Petes Collide

- Hard Day's Pete

2249151,2,B0007Y08LA,"This has to be the worst professional DVD set I've ever seen.

1. Every time I want to watch an episode, I have to skip through a bunch of previews.

2. The episodes aren't even in order - the ""Bonus Specials"" are placed at the end of disk two. ""The Valentine's Day Massacre"" is the premiere, why can't Nickelodeon just put it in the first disk? Instead, I tries to compensate the lack of extras on the DVD by calling these ""Bonus"" episodes. Come on.

3. Day of the Dot is messed up (I'm sure everyone knows that by now).

4. They can't even make chapters in the episodes? Not even one during commercials? The only chapters of the disks are the 6 chapters, one for each episode.  I paused the disk, then accidentally hit the wrong button so I had to restart the disk, skip through the insane previews, select the episode, and then fast foward to fifteen minutes in just to get back to the spot I was at.

This DVD set is a bare minimum product, made by Nickelodeon, who obviously don't give a crap about the amazing shows they put out so long ago. Would they do this to any of their new shows? Hell no.

My brother used to have a local television show. The DVD's he made for them had more special features (and scene selections!) than this set. How pathetic.

If you appreciate the humor of shows such as Malcolm in the Middle, you will love the Petes.  This show gets high marks for its originality and overall quirkiness.  Some of the early specials appear to be missing from this set and from the season 2 set as well.  Hopefully they will come out eventually.  There is no doubt this is a 5+ star show, but I'm giving the DVD set only 4 stars because of the lengthy preview sessions at the start of each disc...I bought this too see Pete & Pete, not a bunch of clips from other Nick shows!

2249153,5,B0007Y08LA,"The punkers and weirdo creatives from the late seventies started to do more ambitious underground work in the Eighties and then moved on to, of all things, kid's programming in the Nineties (the last place in this culture where fun was still appreciated). Elsewhere it's glowering rappers, rock stars who look like porn stars (and boy, has adult entertainment become seriously un-fun), film stars who look like body builders, and body builders running state governments. This is why you have Mark Mothersbaugh doing Rug Rats music or Iggy Pop in Pete and Pete--where else do people like that go? Also why you had the whole Pee-Wee schtick. (There's a full book in this for somebody ambitious). By the late Nineties, as the highly successful bean counters and Harvard jerks took over the reigns of big-profit businesses, they gradually moved the wacko creatives out. Wacko creatives do NEW things which do nothing but throw unpredictability into marketing-by-numbers. Wonder, whimsy, and wacky--never the province of most business zombies as the head of Disney has proven over and over--got lost and then stomped to death on a September morning by representatives of the most un-wondrous, un-wackiest, un-whimsicalist dreary-arsed world-view on Earth. Read Gibbon for insights on this phenomenon. Oh, and then there was Political Correctness, a social vampire sapping all the fun and irony out of everything. Toss in rockin' Fundamentalist Christians (as if this dead horse needed any more beating)...and joy-to-all militant feminists. Now look at the fine work this pack of jackasses has done to make this a better world and ask yourself why it just gets grayer and more joyless every year? Let's face it, none of these morons ever really wanted to make the world a better place for anyone, even themselves. They're all angy and nasty little sadists, they'd all take candy from a baby and pitilessly watch it cry. The more of us who accept this truth, the more chance there may be of doing something about it.

Pete and Pete was one of the last flowerings of an amazing era. Its lunacy was nothing short of inspired, it's joy for life resuscitating. The show is a clarion call for those of us who've just about had more than enough of everyone else's baloney. I fell in love with this show in my thirties. I think those of you out there who truly love this show and sorely miss what it represents will agree with my little rant.

Pete and Pete rocks. It's a very witty show that has MEANING to it, not like the dumb stuff that is on nickelodeon today. Take my advice and buy this DVD. Then you'll see why Nickelodeon has ""gone to the dogs"" without this and other ninties favorites on it.",1127001600,5,588,4.59047619047619

At first, I thought it would just be the nostalgia that made watching Pete and Pete so great. I watched Nick so much when I was a kid. Early ninties Nick was great! Pete and Pete, Clarissa, Are You Afraid of the Dark?, Salute Your Shorts, Rocko's Modern Life, etc!

But back to the Pete. Its not just the nostalgia that makes this a great DVD. Its a great show! The music is awesome, done by Polaris (if I'm not mistaken). The characters are just as great and colorful as I remembered - old Pete struggling with teendom and his pseudo girlfriend Ellen, young Pete's tattoos of a woman called Petunia and a ship, Mom and her plate, Artie! the strongest man in the world! Its all great! The storylines are unique and fun - young Pete's search for his favorite song, old Pete accidentally killing the school squid, old Pete's job as a rangeboy, the family trip to the Hooverdam which results in a competition for the liscence plate that says ""King of Road"" (the loser getting the less glorious plate ""King o frod."")

If you haven't seen this, its great to watch for the first time. Quirky and different. If you have seen it, then you already know how awesome it is!

Given how well Nick treats its classics (i.e. Like Dirt), I didn't know what to expect from this set that I had waited quite a long time for. However, it was a pleasant surprise to see that the Brothers Wrigley were taken very good care of, in both digital quality and packaging. The picture is in excellent quality for the 8 series episodes on the DVDs, and is in good quality for the older 4 special episodes and 2 shorts. The packaging was done well, with the exception of the giant Nick logo being stuck all over it.

The extras are very satisfying for Pete & Pete fans!! There are DVD commentaries on a few of the episodes and Polaris music to listen to, but the best thing is the inclusion of some of the original shorts and specials that ran on Nick in the very early years of the network! These are very funny and much more primitive than the series episodes were, and therefore had a unique hyper-paced style of storytelling (explained on the commentary by the creators, this was because they had no idea if the show would continue at the time, so they tried to fit as much story into 30 minutes as possible!) I'm assuming that all of the shorts were not included so that they could be added to later installments of the series on DVD, which I can only PRAY that Nick will bring to us!!",1120608000,3,1553,4.208053691275167

They have wacky adventures and a great cast of friends, like young Pete's personal superhero, Artie - 'the strongest man (dramatic pause) in the world, heh-heh!' I think my favorite episode is ""Don't Tread on Pete"", but ""The nightcrawlers"" is funny too. I laugh now at how they battled school and bedtimes like it was the end of the world, but at that time I felt the exact same way. Ah, simpler times.

THis was back when Nick had good shows, before the crap they have now like All Grown Up, Spongebob Squrepants, Rocket Power, and As Told By Ginger (which has the worst portrayal of highschool I have ever seen). What made Pete and Pete so great was how they characters were portrayed. The Pete'S are the kind of kids who are wise beyond their years, and other kids and even adults can relate to them. We can all relate to them because everyone knows how tough it can be being a kid and what it's like to grow up and seek exceptance from other. Although the town of Wellsville is fictitious, there are little things about it that are very close to home. The fact that the show is narrated by the oldest Pete makes it better because we get to see the world through the eyes of an adolescent, and it's in an intellegent way.

2249266,5,B0007Y08LA,"Contrary to other reviews posted on this page, the image quality is actually better than when it was shown on Nickelodeon. This is because the signal no longer has to bounce off of satellites to get to your local cable provider.

The reported glitch in the Day Of The Dot episode is there, but this is due to improper storage of the tapes in a salt mine in Kansas City, Missouri, where they were never to be seen again (or so they thought). This might be easily corrected by realigning the pixels, but this kind of restoration will have to wait for future pressings.

It is advised that one repeatedly press the chapter advance buttons immediately after inserting the disk to skip past the commercials and get to the main menu. The menu is simple, crude, and sluggish; perfectly fitting the style of the early Nickelodeon shows. The chapter stops are located at the beginning of each episode, rather than at each scene, requiring a little care when rewinding and fast forwarding. Ironically, though the release is called Nick Rewind, it is difficult to actually rewind the footage. One must go back to the start of the episode and fast forward to just before the point you wanted to rewind to, just like old eight track tape.

The series holds up well since not much has changed visually since the early 1990's. Children who watched the show long ago will now be able to appreciate the sly amusing references and humor that was not easily understood before. All in all, a minor miracle.

The quality of the shows is good. The absence of commercial breaks is a bit glaring, but that's to be expected in a recorded TV show. The most bothersome thing to me about the disc is that everytime I pop it in I have to fast forward through 4 ads for movies and Nick shows (Lemony Snickets, Sponge Bob, Brady Bunch...) I expect this when I rent, but when I purchase something I wish there was a way to skip to the menu.

The bonus material is good - commentaries don't interest me and I'm not the biggest polaris fan but I listened to the 6 or 7 songs they put on.

1.  Technical defects:  The Day Of The Dot episode has a part of it where there are lines and blurs out the wazoo

2.  The Polaris station has a weird stereo mix that differs from the album on the non musical intro (but its not really a problem)

Maybe I haven't seen them in awhile, but I don't remember that.  Yes I Know both Petes are red heads, but still, it was something that QC at the mixing board should have caught.  In addition, I would have wanted the episodes in order, which they don't seem to be, why?

In terms of the show, I'm waiting for season 2 and 3.  There are some great episodes here, and I may piss off ""true"" pete fans, but getting rid of Artie was a great move.  My favorite episodes ""Might Crawlers,"" ""Rangeboy,"" and ""Tool and Die"" don't include him (prominentley at least).

Another nit-picky thing--what is up with the bonus episodes?  They are regular length as far as I can tell, and nick played them as such, so why separate them on the DVD?

But the episodes are as great as ever, I was in college during the run of ths show, but never missed one. Except the fabled Halloweenie, which I'm hoping they put on the next series.

My friend and I who grew up on Nickelodeon in the early 90s (the acclaimed ""prime years"") had figured if shows were getting released on dvd, this one had to, and we were lucky because this was definitely our favorite show. Having digital cable and Noggin (which i use often thanks to Degrassi the next generation) i got to see some reruns of Pete and Pete about two years back. However, they stopped airing. luckily enough, if you were lucky enough, you could find an episode or two here and there on kaaza. now with this dvd release, nickelodeon is finally doing the right thing. this was easily the smartest program they ever showed. it didn't condescend to kids, talk down to them or try and preach to them. watching ""New Years Pete"", little pete even responds to Frank the crossing guard's new years resolution of smoking with ""you gonna smoke more or smoke less?"" when a 10 year old is able to ask someone if they are to smoke more on Nickelodeon, you are reminded of the lazy summer days and weekends of your youth with shows like this as the background. this show is forever implanted in my brain, and this dvd set could have earned 5 stars even if the quality was horrible and there were no extras besides the 4 ""special"" episodes (including my all time favorite episode of any tv show ever, ""what we did on our summer vacation"", in which the petes and ellen try and hunt down their awol ice cream man, mr tastee) and the show's ""house band"" polaris was exposed to me thru the listening station included on the set (im purchasing the soundtrack to the show this weekend) i reccomend this set to anyone who likes tv or just wants to have a good time, because that is the basis in this dvd set. you learn some great lessons without getting preached to, and you see the world for what it is...an adult conspiracy.",1116460800,,1877,4.427745664739884
2249313,5,B0007Y08LA,"Growing up, my whole family enjoyed crowding around the tube for our weekly installments of ""Pete and Pete"" on Nickelodeon.  Since much has been written about the show already, I'll focus on the DVD set alone.

Pros:

The series has held up extremely well over the past 10 years, which is rare for many kids shows.  All 12 installments are expertly written and executed, but the show definitely seems to have found its legs after ""Day of the Dot.""

The included commentaries, while few, offer a lot of great insight from the series creators and production designer into how they created a kids' show that didn't patronize kids or bore their older siblings and family members.  ""The Nightcrawlers"" offers the best combination of production details and creative insight.

The inclusion of the ""Polaris Audio Station"" feature is a nice touch.  ""Pete and Pete"" was greatly defined by its cutting-edge (at the time, at least) alt-rock soundtrack, and it's great to have access to the works of the show's official band.

The audio and video (with one notable exception) are on par with a cable rebroadcast.  Sometimes the picture becomes a bit grainy in dim shots, but this is a result of the source material.

Cons:

As mentioned earlier, ""Day of the Dot"" has a noticable defect: a red distortion line running through the middle of the screen for nearly 10 minutes.  It doesn't kill the experience, but it is quite distracting, and a bit of a disappointment that more care wasn't put into the DVD's post-production.

The absence of more of the wonderful short films that pre-date the series is something of a let-down.

Finally, each DVD comes with nearly seven(!) minutes worth of advertising prepended that can't be skipped.  I'm all for corporate synergy, but since much of this is repetitive (Two ads for Spongebob in a row?!), I'd suggest starting the DVD first, then chasing down a Mr. Tastee truck for some popsicles.  The main menu will be up when you return.

Final recommendation:

The weight of the material far outweighs the shortcomings of the package.  I went from Wellsville Fighting Squid to a member of the International Adult Conspiracy from the time this show left the air to the present, but this show is still as fresh and entertaining as it was in my headier days.  It's definitely worth the price and has a high rate of return on repeated viewings.",1116460800,14,2366,4.806930693069307

I found that most of them (Darkwing Duck, Goof Troop, Ren and Stimpy, etc.) were actually pretty horrible. I can't imagine why I ever liked them in the first place. But The Adventures of Pete and Pete was a VERY different story - it was far more profound and brilliant than I had remembered. Every episode seems random, whimsical, and wacky, but somehow ends in a way that leaves you thinking ""wow, what an awesome show"". Pete and Pete has more in common with The Tick or Strangers with Candy than with Nickelodeon's other shows. I only wish Nickelodeon would go faster with their other shows - Rocko's Modern Life was another brilliant show that deserves DVD immortality, and Space Cases will always have a special place in my heart.

2249320,5,B0007Y08LA,"I'm not here to critique the show ""The Adventures of Pete & Pete"" -- I could go on for a very long time and still not convey what it, as a show, means to me. It (like another review here wonderfully stated) still holds up, even when you have had it's importance build up in your mind after years of not being able to see it. Usually, your favorite childhood shows are incredibly underwhelming after a prolonged hiatus -- but in this case, the show is actually even weirder and more sophisticated than you remember.

I'd just like to respond to the review concerning the quality (as in visual) of this DVD set.

Someone else hinted that because of the bootlegs, this set is unnecessary. The quality of the bootlegs are not any better, and in many cases worse. For this DVD set, the actual quality of the episodes is what you'd see on TV if they were re-run on Nickelodeon.

The most glaring problem occurs in the episode ""Day of the Dot"" (the classic Big Pete and Ellen kiss on the football field) -- a noticable and slightly annoying tape error creates a constant line of red in the upper section of the screen, and it stays that way for about five to ten minutes.

But other than that, there's really not much else to complain about.

Nickelodeon obviously didn't know how to handle this show properly; if there are any other faults noticable on these episodes, it's just how they are now. There's no way to go back and reverse the damage done to the master tapes throughout the years.

That's not to say the quality is God-awful; far from that. If you have seen the recent and much lamented Noggin re-runs, you'll know what you're getting. Neither above-average or below-average quality, just good enough.

So leave quality out of your mind when you purchase -- these episodes look just fine, and we should be thankful that they are finally available. Buying this set may also help the future of other Nickeloden DVD releases (I personally would love some ""You Can't Do That on Television"") and more seasons of this classic show on DVD.

Final edit: the commentary tracks for this DVD set are from co-creators Will McRobb and Chris Viscardi and director Katherine Dieckmann on the episodes ""What We Did on Our Summer Vacation,"" ""Day of the Dot"" and ""The Nightcrawlers."" Also of note is the Polaris music station, which features seven songs that can also be found on the Polaris CD (aptly titled ""Music From The Adventures of Pete & Pete"").",1115769600,131,2441,4.5954022988505745

The Adventures Of Pete & Pete and Clarissa Explains It All are a great way to start. Let's hope they get to Doug, Salute Your Shorts, Hey Dude, The Secret World Of Alex Mack and Shelby Woo.

Green Room Radio features an interview with Will McRobb, one of the creators of the show on their website ([...] Will talks about the creation and the making of Pete & Pete with me, Erich Bergen, the host. Green Room Radio is also available as a podcast at ([...]",1115596800,3,549,4.382352941176471
2249322,5,B0007Y08LA,"Although I was only 6 or 7 when I saw my first episode of Pete and Pete on Nickelodeon, my whole family and I were instantly hooked. I'd totally forgotten about the series until I saw an old Clarissa Explains It All on late night tv and I remebered good old pete and pete, artie ""the strongest man in the world"" and mum with the steel plate in her head. I reminded my family and we've been searching for the dvd for almost a year. When we heard nickelodeon was releasing it, we were over-joyed. but we soon found out that they didn't ship to Australia and that there was no sset date for an Australian release. So thank you amazon for stocking The Adventures of Pete and Pete!",1115510400,3,676,4.248062015503876
2249343,3,B0007Y08LA,"Pete and Pete was one of my favorite shows on nickelodeon, and I'm very excited for this dvd. Unfortunatly, from the screen shots I've seen, and reviews on other websites, the video transfer is horrible, with tracking errors like you would get on a vhs tape, and horrible compression.",1115078400,4,284,4.816326530612245
2249344,5,B0007Y08LA,I grew up on Nick and The Adventures Of Pete & Pete was definately one of my favorites. I anxiously awaited Saturday nights for SNICK to watch all my favorite shows. This DVD has been anxiously awaited for a long time and anyone who ever loved the show should get this DVD. You should also check out this and the other DVDs in the new Rewind Collection if all you know from Nick are the new tv shows.,1115078400,2,400,4.141025641025641
2249345,5,B0007Y08LA,"Long have I been waiting for the release of the ADVENTURES OF PETE AND PETE on DVD, The greatest show to ever to grace Nick. The show was smart, and even edgy as far as it's casting was concerned. Casting Iggy Pop as Mona's dad was bloody brilliant. Several SNL cast members also drop by playing small, but memorable charactors. Then there is the music. The show featured bands that would now be played on INDIE 103.1. The show also featured a outstanding young cast, and supporting charactors like Artie the ""strongest man in the world"", and the evil school principal played by BATMAN's Adam West. All in all the show is great for kids, and adults.",1114992000,5,649,4.555555555555555

2249347,5,B0007Y08LA,"Another reviewer mentions that the complete Pete & Pete collection has been available elsewhere on the net for while a now.  True, and yet not true.  That other set is a bootleg, an unofficial release of the shows, put together by fans, and consisting of taped-off-TV quality video and sound.  Sometimes it takes bootleggers to show the studios that people really are interested in a TV show or movie, so I'm not putting down the bootleggers.  But be VERY happy that we can now purchase the first volume of the set with top-notch quality and, hopefully, some extra bits!",1114560000,3,570,4.7272727272727275
2249348,5,B0007Y08LA,"For the uninitiated, Pete and Pete was a surreal show about two strange brothers in an even stranger town. Think ""Twin Peaks"" for the elementary school-junior high crowd.

The show is silly and bizarre, but in a ""Cartoon Network Adult Swim"" or Will Ferrell way (demented to the point of nearly not being for children), not in the way newer Nick programming like ""All That"" is (kids acting like idiots and talking loudly).

Most of the best bits come from the neighborhood superhero Artie ""the strongest man... IN THE WORLD!"", who either has powers beyond our comprehension, or is a skinny, deranged lunatic who thinks he does.

Upon reviewing the shows of your youth, you usually find the animation/acting or the stories to be weak, or the jokes to be nowhere near as funny as you remember. Pete and Pete is the exception to the rule.",1114473600,29,834,4.698630136986301
