8005192,3,B00011V8H2,"I used to be a SUPER ADDICTED romance novel reader back when I was 12 years old. (I'm 26 now) Naturally, I've became cynical through the years so I don't really read romance novels anymore. HOWEVER, a week ago I found out that about this Harlequin romance novels turned into TV movies. I was like WHAAAATT???? Where there hell was I and why didn't I find out about this sooner?! Of course I just had to watch ^_^ I guess I still love my memories of Harlequin romance novels! So what's my review (POSSIBLE SPOILERS) The pacing of the movie was good. There were no boring parts. As I was watching it, I was trying to imagine if I was actually reading the book - you know when the main characters are saying their lines, etc. The female heroine, Hallie, is very pretty. The hero who Hallie ends up with, Steve I think is his name, is cute in an outsdoors rugged kinda way. All the actors were very good and acted well. Now as for the story, I didn't really like the story. I thought the hero, Steve, was pretty ordinary. I don't understand why Hallie didn't end up with her college crush and I agree with the other reviewer. Too many divorces. Ack! In my opinion, how they are able to go from one relationship to the other with a recent divorce is sorta ?? But overall, I'm glad I watched this movie. I don't know how similar the book and the movie is but if it is similar then obviously I just don't like the story and I probably wouldn't have bought the book. Now I plan to watch other Harlequin Romance turned to tv. I'm pretty excited because I liked the plot of Diamond Girl (which I bought) and I'm getting soon hopefully. I also got So hard to forget. As soon as I watch those two, I'll write a review.",1142985600,8,1706,4.252307692307692
8005193,4,B00011V8H2,"Women who have searched for ""Mr. Right"" and met many a ""Mr. Wrong"" will find this made for TV 1998 film entertaining, and though a little weak in certain areas of the script, a very strong cast holds the thread of the story together. Leslie Hope as Hallie and Rick Peters as her neighbor Steve are a delight to watch, as both go through the entanglements of relationships gone sour, and some that never get off the ground. Hallie is an architect, along with her friend Donnalee (well played by Sherry Miller), and both try to make a success of their business, as they listen to the clock ticking away in the marriage and children department. They even join a video dating service, with some amusing as well as disastrous results.

Directed by Brad Turner, the film is based on a novel by the prolific contemporary romance author Debbie Macomber. Despite the plot being totally predictable, it is charming and endearing because the characters are decent, warm people, who struggle with the bumps and bruises of life in a way we can understand. This is a ""woman's movie"" through and through, except I hope no other woman who lives alone has a front door like Hallie's, which doesn't have much in the way of locks or security. Perhaps Toronto, where this was filmed, is a very safe city! Others in the cast include Natasha Greenblatt, Carl Marotte, and Michelle Duquet, and the familiar face of Michael Nouri, who one will remember from as far back as ""Flashdance"" (1983), and who has the good fortune of becoming even better looking as time goes by. Total running time is 95 minutes.",1123027200,15,1581,4.666666666666667
