A bank manager (played superbly by Horst Bucholz) ends up being transferred to a bank branch located in the sticks after a recent divorce from his wife. Unhappy and desperate, he enlists the help of his new lover, whose guest house he resides in, to hatch a plan to rob the bank that he manages.

At first, things go as planned, and the couple think they're in the clear. However, emotions start to get the better of the female accomplice, having to do with the fact that during the heist, the bank manager's secretary had to be killed to avoid any ""loose strings"". Things begin to unravel quickly, and the ""perfect life"" the pair of criminals had envisioned begins to look less and less unlikely to come to fruition.

They are a couple of different versions of this film. The version released in the United States has a running time of 82 minutes, while the other, released in the UK, is 93 minutes in length...(Strangely enough, the 82 minute version is more appealing).

Thanks to the ""International Film Forum"" for releasing this wonderful ""Made On Demand"" DVD-R of ""The Catamount Killing"" here on Amazon...By the way, the version offered is the superior 82 minute version, although it is listed as the 93 minute one...This film is incredible !!!...Buy the DVD-R now before Amazon ceases production of it !!!
