7382944,2,B0145CBN68,"What a huge disappointment! I've been a Clapton fan forever. The 2005 Cream Reunion and the Clapton/Winwood Madison Square Garden show DVD's are tops in my collection, along with the most recent Crossroads benefit, and director Martyn Atkins and the teams that made them are true concert video artists. But this one is a complete mess. I watched this disaster on my local public broadcasting station last night (a fundraiser of course). I'm sure it was an inspirational experience for those lucky enough to be at RAH for the shows. The nonpareil musical lineup and set lists seemed perfect. But this looked as if some director gave flipcameras to a bunch of teenagers, got them back at the end of the evening, and proceeded to cobble together some mindless homage to the lousiest music videos of the 1980's! Jumping from shot to shot by the millisecond, with the directors/editors displaying zero sense of continuity or presentation of the fine musicianship that went into making this happen. And the idea that Clapton himself might have approved this mess boggles the mind. Thanks to PBS for saving me the thirty bucks....and you can thank me for doing the same for you. Cheers.",1445126400,95,1179,4.9
7382945,5,B0145CBN68,Ive been watching this on PBS tonight. Im placing my pre order momentairily. Eric CLapton is the best guitar player in my humble opinion.

I've seen him on almost every tour and every recorded production with every combination of accompanying players imaginable. In all due respect, this is the worse performance in memory. His tour with Derek Trucks and Doyle Bramhall II was by far the best stage performance because he could do the Derek and The Dominoes songs like ""Tell The Truth"" with a world class slide guitarist. Sorry, I am an avid fan and this is not the Eric to whom I've help on a pedestal for over 50 years.",1499385600,6,660,4.418032786885246

I attended his concert at Madison Square Garden on May 1st 2015 and this film is a good memory of that show.  The film contains good live versions of his songs.  The set list is good and interesting.  The bonus DVD is also very good and interesting.  It contains rare performances of Clapton and Cream songs.  This deluxe package also contains 2 live CD's of the film and they are very good.  I am sure that the regular package (1 DVD/2 CD) is good but I highly recommend this deluxe package.,1494633600,,599,4.381818181818182

I can jam like that on my own time. Clapton is going through the motions. No energy there. I own several Clapton DVDs. This is one of the worst.

Uninspired and boring performance. Audio recording and mixing are really bad. Loud and compressed, without sense of 3D even on acoustic part. Electric part is cacophony finest tube equipment cannot mask. Painfully vulgar background vocals. Camera framing and angles are probably worst I have ever seen. The only cure after this BD is to watch immediately good old DVD Unplugged with poor video quality but superb recording and inspired performance.

7383004,5,B0145CBN68,"First let me say that I was an Eric Clapton fan before I bought this concert on Blu-Ray and CDs. I owned 12 CDs by him before buying this. I listened to the CD's first, then watched the Blu-Ray concert. The CDs feature songs like; Somebody's Knocking on my door, Key to the Highway - a song he did with BB King before he passed, Tell the Truth, Pretending, Hoochie Coochie Man - one he also did with BB King, You Are So Beautiful - one may recognize from Joe Cocker's rendition, Can't Find My Way Back Home (Traffic days) and I Shot The Sheriff. That rounds out the first CD. He also does an acoustic set for the second CD and second half of the video. The concert was recorded live at The Royal Albert Hall in London. I believe they used about 12 video cameras for the concert and solos by the musicians are close up and personal - the producers did a fine job on the video. Eric also features singer/organist Paul Carrack on vocals as well as on keyboards on a few songs. I'm glad they went back to rockin' after the acoustic set, because that's how I'd like to see Eric Clapton close his show: with a more upbeat tempo. The price of this item is comparable to getting a Blu-ray, but includes a quality recording on CD's as well. Sure not to disappoint.",1483833600,5,1255,4.2552301255230125

There is nothing good about this performance.  Clapton's performance is mediocre.  The background singers are terrible and totally out of place, and out of tune. Steve Gadd's drumming is badly arranged.  The rest of the band is equally inadequate.  In a word, this performance is ""awful.""

My copy is going back to the store as ""used"" for whatever credit they will give me.

7383080,4,B0145CBN68,"Blues-Rock legend Eric Clapton celebrated turning 70 years old with his 17th appearance at Londons Royal Albert Hall.  The May 15, 2015 show is replicated here in this excellent Blu ray package.  It also includes 2 CDs which repeat the Blu ray version.  Clapton followers will not be surprised with the songs as they are all well-known even by casual listeners.  He does what he can to freshen them up with long guitar riffs and solo sharing with various members of his band.  Paul Carrack even gets a couple vocal solos and hes a standout on the keyboards.  The rest of the band are mostly regulars including Steve Gadd on drums, Chris Stainton on keys, and Nathan East on bass.  Backing vocals are handled by Sharon White and Michelle John in addition to East and Carrack.  Andy Fairweather Low joins in on High Time We Went.

I held off buying this concert for a while, primarily because of negative comments about the fast editing and quick cuts which I hate like many people.  When the price came down, I bit, if for no other reason than to get the CDs.  I have hundreds of video concerts in my library and I found that these fast cuts are less intrusive than many Ive seen.  Admittedly they are mostly with groups that attract a younger viewer than you might expect to watch a Clapton concert.  Yes, it was somewhat annoying but never got in the way of the music for me.

The Blu ray package includes CD's and the concert which runs about 2 hours if you include the long bonus song, Little Queen of Spades. Like many concerts adapted for Blu ray, it comes with a 1080i video resolution rather than the more frequent 1080p with a 1.78:1 aspect ratio.  It didn't matter to my eyes.  The show looks very good and very natural.  As you might expect, there isn't a lot of flash, either in the performance or in the lighting and staging. These guys just stand (or sit) there and play and play well.  Clapton rarely speaks between songs and when he does it is brief.  I don't know if the editing took care of that or if he just wanted to play.  For me I like it like that.  The music by the way comes with 2 options.  A terrific DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 track and an uncompressed (LPCM) 2.0 track.  I only listened to the 5.1 option but might engage the 2.0 the next time around.  In any case you won't be disappointed.  There are no extras, but for the bonus song.  Yeah, get it.",1460332800,,2378,4.372146118721461
7383081,4,B0145CBN68,"Basic Clapton, I was a bit disappointed in the whole production. I must say that Eric has set some very high standards prior to this, so this was just an evening with Eric so to speak.",1460073600,,184,4.138888888888889

Maybe some kind of Slowhand backlash after all this time?  I just don't get it.  Me, I'm totally thrilled with this latest cd/dvd live package.  The filmed show is excellent, both in game-plan and execution; the set list is just fine, if a bit predictable; Clapton's crack touring band offers sterling support throughout the proceedings, and the star himself is an engaging stage presence, nimble-fingered and in fine voice.  The dvd gets high marks for its beautiful visuals and crisp, clear audio; ditto the sound on the two-cd presentation.  And what about those naysayers among us?

7383113,3,B0145CBN68,"Let me start by saying this is another good looking & sounding Eric Clapton video release. I disagree with some of the reviews here that complained about the camera edits, I found no such issues. The audio mix is well balanced (I prefer the DTS-MA option) with Eric's guitar given prominence as it rightly should.

Moving to the concert itself, it's typical recent Clapton show where the music is more safe than exciting. You get to hear shades of guitar brilliance but as longtime fan, you can't help wish he would've crafted a more interesting event to celebrate such a landmark (afterall, he reformed Cream to celebrate his 60th). The set list is good mix of blues, JJ Cale and solo Clapton hits with the usual acoustic set in the middle. While its natural to play few of your hits, how many versions of blues standards like Driftin' and Key To The Highway do we need? Wish Eric was more ambitious in selection of these (endless options really).

My biggest complaint here is the removal of Liitle Queen Of Spades from concert film and being offered as ""bonus"" track. Bad decision Eagle Rock!

Being the fan, I had to have this and is good choice of casual fans who want a well shot solo concert from the Albert Hall. For more inspired recent Clapton, I suggest either the first Crossroads Guitar Festivals, the Cream reunion or the concerts with Steve Winwood.",1455062400,,1364,4.651452282157677

7383117,4,B0145CBN68,"and, he aint my brother, but I love him like a brother.
EC says he is retired. 300th concert at RAH.
It was OK, but because I love electric,  and as another said here, no Pilgrim, and so on, I was kind of unhappy with the last half of tbis 300th being all accoustic. This is probably my first 4 star vs. Normally 5.
I don't feel he brought some of his best blues, those that always get better than ever, year after year. Yes he did some new arrangements. But the second half was way too quiet for a birthday and supposed retirement at MSG..
His style, his voice, and his arrangements are impeccable, no matter what he does.
So, that is the consolation.
I like most of the USA, and all elsewhere, I missed MSG, but never thought he would pass over the Big Shy. Not when he repeatedly said he's retiring. Especially since he  broke his promise to return for the next Crossroads.. and switched it out for NYC. Bad. (!)
But, the 70th ..shock to the system is now almost a year ago..he may see no big-legged woman has sung yet..now.
I am so spoiled by so many great live concerts where he worked up the more roaring sound and we got more blown away. Like with Winwood, it went down hard ! Wow. +Seeing Ginger was a pure shock. And he, too,- still was great. Same for Steve. I almost had to cry. A sea of joy. Those times.. And early memories still here, in front of us..too much. Too great.

Yes, it is a pleasure to hear him, but he became part of the showbiz burgeoning scene. The only ""achievement"" he still misses but deserves, is to play at the SuperBowl. Clapton ""was"" God at a time.",1450396800,3,450,4.6375

7383144,2,B0145CBN68,"Huge dissapoinment.  I pre-orderd the 2 DVD + 2 CD set that came in a nice book and it arrived yesterday.  Wow was I disapointed.  The concert video jumped all over the place. and I agree with the commenter that the MSG DVD was so much better.  Next was the Bonus or should I say Bogus 2nd DVD.  Just a bunch of clips that could be found on youtube anytime.  Yeah the book looks good on the coffee table, but I am seriously considering sending it back for a 50+$ refund.  I wouldn't even buy the DVD for the price it is listed for here.

Wait 6 months, you will find this in the 99 cent bin at walmart.  And I say this as a huge Clapton fan as I grew up in the late 60's and even say him perform in a club in London 64.",1449273600,6,719,3.836734693877551
7383145,4,B0145CBN68,Eric does a solid performance.  Some songs have changed some over the years. Key to the hiway doesn't sound like the other versions I've heard. Hoochie  coohie  man is not in the true blues as Clapton is known for. I shot the Sheriff is not a reggae as I've heard. Eric pulls off a great strong solo. But his guitar is tuned brighter /thinner sound .Can't find my way home is done a little different.  Tears in Heaven is kinda brighter and funky.not the sad song it was. Layla is done acustic not a strong or solid as the original unplugged version. Kinda hurried. Nice to hear Let rain again. Nice. I was disappointed that this dvd didn't include and of the special guests that came up and played with him at through out the run of shows celebrating his 7th birthday. Still a very strong performance through out the show. If your a Clapton fan I would not leave this out of your collection.,1449187200,5,891,4.381818181818182

7383147,2,B0145CBN68,"Unfortunately this production was poorly edited, it's just a long series of short shots pieced together so you never really get a sense of the concert. And to be honest the band sucks, very mediocre for the most part, especially the keyboardist. You'd think Mr. Clapton could attract better talent than this. It's a gorgeous venue but, again, you don't get the sense of being there. Whoever directed this effort should have stuck to automobile commercials. That's about the artistic level of the production. If you are interested in Clapton live, try a DVD of one of the festivals he puts on every year.",1448928000,4,603,4.8076923076923075
7383148,3,B0145CBN68,"this could have been a nice document of a good show. It`s not the camera work that bothers me, it`s the mix. Let me think why do people go to Clapton concerts for? Oh yeah, to hear his guitar! Key to the highway, vocals nice and clear up front. oh wait Clapton is playing some great licks that I can barely hear, maybe the lead will be brought up to the vocal level, nope afraid not! same with many  songs on the cd. Now I know Clapton like any good guitar player sometimes keeps it in the backround when backing up the vocals. but his guitar is a voice and should be presented in the mix as such, especially when he`s wailing. The drum cymbals are mixed louder on Tell the truth. At times it sounds like it was recorded thru a cardboard box. No presence. Ok let`s see who mixed it, it says Simon Climie, Wow go figure. This guy has been the bane of Clapton listeners for over 15 years. Why Clapton uses this guy is beyond me. Well it is a good performance.

What I don't get is why he ,at this age, doesn't do the music in concert that HE wants to do, not what the fans want to hear. He's been doing some of these songs for decades. They should have been retired years ago .At this point Eric should pick a more eclectic playlist. True  fans would love it. Remember the strictly blues tour? A real treat!

Even though we were seated third row on the floor, the sound quality of the Blu-Ray and CD's seems to me a little better than being there live. The video captures the magnificent Albert Hall showcased with stunning light features.

Any true Clapton fan will enjoy having this in their collection.",1447977600,8,569,4.3584905660377355

7383158,5,B0145CBN68,"I almost didn't purchase this video because of several negative reviews regarding the frequent camera shot editing during this concert.  I didn't find the editing to be problematic.  In fact, the shifting perspectives provided during the performance were entertaining and added to the experience.

This was Eric Clapton at his best.  He was supported by a highly talented group of musicians who appeared to enjoy themselves throughout the concert.  The pianist had a wonderfully soulful voice and did an excellent version of ""You are so beautiful"" in the middle of the concert.  The bassist was stellar on ""Cocaine.""  The set list offered a nice variety of songs that engaged the audience from start to finish.

The quality of the blu ray video was superb and the 5.1 sound was better.  I will enjoy watching, and rewatching, this DVD many times.",1447891200,12,846,4.985714285714286

7383160,5,B0145CBN68,"Well, no one las seem interested in going near this so I will. This package is fantastic. Having read the liner notes and taken into consideration Clapton's decades long career and decades long relationship with this venue I think there is little or no chance he had nothing to do with the production of this video and I believe the final product is spot on. It is not meant to bring anyone into some intimate relationship with the people he is on stage with. It is about his relationship with this beautiful, historic venue and how they have enriched each other's lives and reputations. That's the reason for the number of wide shots and shots of the inside of Royal Albert Hall during the show. Why would Clapton bother to spend himself in blowing the house down as he did in this show then produce a shoddy video? No, I'm afraid this is exactly what was intended whether or not any of the detractors I have read like it or wish it had been otherwise. Sorry, but to use a somewhat tired  but apt phrase, this is not about you. Bravo Eric Clapton and company! You've done the Royal Albert proud!",1447804800,84,1096,4.45273631840796

7383165,2,B0145CBN68,"I absolutely love Eric Clapton.  I will buy the DVD just to have it, but I know I will rarely if ever watch it. :(  If you look at the 2008 MSG DVD of Clapton and Steve Winwood, which was an awesome show to have been in attendance, I could see that it was being filmed.  It was a thrill to be there, but to be honest, the DVD video was shot and produced so nearly perfect, it conveyed a deep sense of intimacy.  The angles often having Clapton and Winwood in the frame, the close-ups, and the lack of camera switching made the DVD an awesome memory!  I am thrilled I was there, but I got to see the show better on the DVD which shows Eric's deep focus while playing riffs, and his facial expressions that clearly said ""I am having a ball playing with Steve""!  You could FEEL IT!

Watching the PBS showing, sadly, so many of the shots are wide, and the alas the producer had to be on speed, as I don't think I saw a camera shot that didn't change every 5-7 seconds MAX!  Killed by another ""VH1 Era Producer""!  When are these God Awful video producers going to learn that ""LESS IS MORE""????

The video changes come so fast during play, that the video should likely open with a warning that ""Changes in camera shots produces wide variations in lighting, not unlike flickering, and those that are at risk for seizures, should be warned"".  I turned my theater room lights out completely, and to be honest, the variation in light intensity in the room due to camera switching was that bad.  I could watch the 2008 concert with Winwood in the dark anytime, as well as the 2001 concert, well shot.  Heck even the 1986 concert with Phil Collins on Drums was a bit dark, but still well produced, especially for 1980's!.  Audio quality is just always awesome.  The DTS encoding has always been thrilling.  We will have to wait for the DVD to hear DTS 5.1, as the PBS special was in LPCM 2CH Stereo.

What really angers me is this is his 70th Bday tour.  I don't know if we will get more from Eric??  I know he loves Asia, (Trains, Planes & Eric), and perhaps he will play there, and we will get another video???  I suspect this is more likely than hiring a producer that is not a speed freak and re-releasing this excellent concert.  There is NO BAD Clapton, but there is a way to ruin his concert.  We have been very lucky as many of Eric's DVD concerts are so well produced.  Not this one. :-((

BTW, I have to laugh because at least one of the PBS commentators showed his ignorance, or perhaps it was a writer.  One made the statement.. ""You know, the audience just loves Layla acoustically, I wonder if Clapton even bothers to play it electric at all anymore?"".  REALLY???  SERIOUSLY??",1445212800,130,2678,4.325301204819277
