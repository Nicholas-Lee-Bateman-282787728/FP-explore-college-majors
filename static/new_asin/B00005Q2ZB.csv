1643031,5,B00005Q2ZB,"I would like to comment that this volume of Sailor Moon S was the best out of the whole series.
One reason that this volume was the best is beacuse it features all of the Sailor Scouts, including one of my favorite scouts, Sailor Saturn. Another reason it was good is that the ending was concluded well and it didn't leave me questioning more (except about when the next season was coming). A third reason I liked it was because the second episode of the volume was very touching.
There are many other reasons I liked this this volume, but if I listed them all I'd run out of room. I hope that you will see this volume and find reasons of your own as to why you enjoyed it.",1019260800,2,673,4.184615384615385
1643032,5,B00005Q2ZB,"At last, Mistress 9 has be awakend!  If you are a big Hotaru/Sailor Saturn fan, this is the movie for you.  after stealing rini's pure heart, mistress 9 is awakend.  She is here on one mission, to get the purity force and bring pharoh 90 to earth and plunge it into chaos!  if you thought that the nega moon was bad enough, the death busters are ten times worse.  This is a great movie since you get a lot of mistress 9 and see Saturn's first appearence.  i recommend this for everyone.  Make sure you get the sub though.  It is a lot better than the dubb.",1013126400,,556,4.130841121495327
1643033,5,B00005Q2ZB,In my oppinon some of the best sm episoids ever made!!!They have lots of actoin and sailor saturn (^^ I think sailor saturn's cool!!!!)The uncut version is alot better!!,1013040000,,169,4.862068965517241
1643034,5,B00005Q2ZB,"I like the conclusion of this season so far. Particularly the showdown between Serena and Mistress 9 and Master Pharaoh 90.
If you never saw this episode. I suggest you buy the Sailor Moon S The Awakening Vol 12 any version. To find out what happens to the Sailor Scouts!",1010707200,,271,4.44
1643035,5,B00005Q2ZB,"Ne, minna, great movie.  I love it.  The subtitles are fairly good, and the storyline absolutely rocks.
And it is NOT Boujishi or Bishoji or whatever people have put down.  It is Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon S, or technically Bishjo Senshi Sailor Moon S.  If you try to get Japanese info, do it right!  I'm young too y'know.
Anyway, this movie was a great finale to BSSMS.  Only problem I have with it is that the coloring on the cover is kinda...messed up.  Ja ne, minna!  *blows kisses*

1643036,5,B00005Q2ZB,WHEN I GOT THIS MOVIE I THOUGHT IT WAS THE BEST MOVIE EVER. AFTER YOU FIRST SEE IT YOU CAN'T STOP WATCHING IT. YOU JUST HAVE TO SEE IT TO THE END.,1006992000,,146,3.59375
1643037,5,B00005Q2ZB,"This was the BEST! I dunno about you but, I loved it!!! This is the last episodes of the S series Bojishou Senshi Sailor Moon S! ( It's really called that ) The Messiah of silence is at her revenge! She'll do anything to get the Holy Grail now. The Sailor Senshi now have Mistress 9, Dr. Tomoe, Pharoh 90, and the Death busters to deal with! Can they make it? The end of this series is different and unpredictible! I thoght that Sailor Moon would use the ginhoushou (a.k.a. Imperium Silver Crystal) to destroy him, but she uses the Spiral Heart Moon Rod insted. ""Cozmic Moon...Power!!!"", The attack has really no affect, Pharoh 90 easily deflects it and attacks... Mistress 9?! Whats with the Death busters? They kill thier own team! This world is in Jepordy! The Senshi, without the Grail cannot destroy this monster! What to do!? Sailor Moon is not powerfull enough. The other Senshi are DEAD! What will happen? This, all excitment is Vol. 11-12! The best ones! Can the Sailor Senshi defeat them?! All in Vol. 12!",1002067200,8,1015,4.582417582417582
7949467,5,B00005Q2ZB,"Sometimes it doesn't matter how old you get, you can still enjoy stuff from your childhood. I loved Sailor Moon as a kid and have fallin in love with it again as a young adult. Great anime, amazing artists. I love the way Japan artists draw so real and believeable. Anyways this is a must have for any die hard fan. It's the epic conclusion with the Sailor Soldiers vs Sailor Saturn. Then SPOILER Sailor Uranus and Sailor Neptune have the nerve to challenge their future Queen Serena in a fight. I LOVED these episodes. Some of my favs outta the whole series.",1352505600,,559,4.436893203883495
7949468,5,B00005Q2ZB,"With Mistress 9 having possessed Hotaru Tomoe, and having taken Rini's Pure Heart Crystal, the fate of the Earth is at steak when the Sailor Scouts arrive at Mugen School to stop Mistress 9 from summoning Pharaoh 90 to the Earth! When Mistress 9 tricks Sailor Moon into handing over the Purity Chalice to her, is it too late to save the world from destruction? And why have Uranus and Neptune asked Serena to step down from being future queen of Crystal Tokyo? Can she prove them otherwise that she is their leader?

The only way to find out is to acquire the last VHS of Sailor Moon S!",1304553600,,586,4.376146788990826
7949469,5,B00005Q2ZB,Hotaru's sacrifice. The Scout  of the silent star Saturn saves the world with Sailor Moon's help. Uranus and Neptune are wrong. Sailor Moon is the most powerful Sailor Scout.,1032393600,2,174,5.0
7949470,3,B00005Q2ZB,"..I hate the dub, and I really don't recommend anything with the dub.. Go out and buy the subtitle.. Even if this is uncut, it doesn't mean that it's the same exact thing as the subtitles. So, if you wanna see the real Sailor Moon videos.. Buy the subtitles. Sure, some of the words are changed because of the translations/subtitles but it's all good. They got the name of it somewhat right. I don't feel like looking it up right now but I know it means ""Pretty Soldiers Sailor Moon,"" Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon is what I think it is, dont't remember. Hotaru kicks. I say this only as a loyal Sailor Moon watcher.. Buy this.",1030838400,,625,4.396551724137931
