Our kid wanted this one to go with the rest.
Good movie and he really seems to like it.",1445299200,,132,3.925925925925926
7324799,5,B01147YQKW,A fun movie. It's just what you would expect it to be. Slightly creepy - slightly dark. Classic R.L. Stein in a movie.,1445126400,,118,4.173913043478261
7324800,4,B01147YQKW,"This is a PG version of the R-rated Waxwork movie from the 1980's.  Waxwork was a better made movie (and Waxwork was made for $4,000,000 less).  If you see this movie before seeing Waxwork, then maybe you'd like it more then me.  The story and acting seemed low budget (It seemed like a made-for-tv movie).  It was fun watching the movie, but it was made for pre-teens/teens (aka R.L. Stine) but the subject matter is more for an adult audience.  I gave it 4 stars because it was entertaining and had a good story. Worth watching once.",1444262400,,535,4.474226804123711

7324802,4,B01147YQKW,"My ten-year-old daughter is a great fan of R.L. Stine's stories and has watched all of the Goosebumps and Haunting Hour shows, so when this popped up in her Netflix queue, she decided to view it and I sat and watched it with her. The story is nothing outstanding - the premise centers around two teenagers, Beth and Kellen who obviously have feelings for each other but remain platonic friends. Then the carnival comes to town for Halloween, and there's a Hall of Horrors exhibit that has everyone talking about it.

Just around this time, a new kid shows up in high school and is taken with Beth while Kellen attracts the attention of the mysterious Goth-dressed Lillith. Before long, some local kids start disappearing, and Beth begins to suspect that all is not well with the Hall of Horrors, but no one around her, including Kellen, believes her. The rest of the story focuses on Beth's efforts to save her friends from being lost to the evil in the Hall of Horrors before it is too late.

There is no bad language in this production and the scares are just right for pre-teens so it serves as a rather entertaining Halloween show for the family.",1443916800,2,1150,4.577669902912621

7324804,5,B01147YQKW,I Love the story. Dove Cameron really did good job & the others did to. I love the spooky vibe the movie has. This movie might be scary for kids who are not close to age 10. It's been long time since I've seen good Halloween movie. This is it :),1443657600,3,245,3.823529411764706
7324805,2,B01147YQKW,"While this movie is better than the atrocious 'Mostly Ghostly' series, it's definitely flawed. Dove Cameron is pretty and spunky as Beth. That's it for the positive. The characters are too annoying (even for a PG-rated movie). Lame rapping and ""yo mama"" jokes abound in this boring, made-for-television feature film.",1443484800,,316,5.34
7324806,5,B01147YQKW,"My grand'pa John [1865-1960], and my pop, Norman (1913-1995) would approve of their, fellow, disabled-veteran off-spring
SFC Michael John (1949-) USN & USA, Retired... who actually enjoys all of these, fine, Universal Studios FAMILY FILMS.
Suitable for children of all ages...though probably BEST enjoyed by those of us between 10 and 67. Join us for the fun!

By the way, all of the titles SOUND ominous, but this film franchise is all devoid of those four-letter-words; bloodiness;
and promisquity of any kind. Even granny would enjoy it. The THRILLS a-r-e there... you just imagined the rest of it.

HIGHLY recommended!",1441152000,22,622,5.21

7324829,5,B01147YQKW,Great movie for the whole family.  I actually had a role in this movie as one of the older witches and it was a pleasure to work with the director Peter Deluise and the whole cast and crew. Truly was a fun set and movie theme to work on. I would recommend to everyone. :),1453852800,4,271,3.9272727272727272
7324830,5,B01147YQKW,"The XL is perfect for my 75 lb male Doberman, there's room to grow under the belly, but I can get it snug and the length is perfect to cover his back. The fleece is warm and the vinyl cover keeps him dry and blocks out the wind. Before this arrived today, he was shivering within a minute in 18 degrees and wind, after we received it, I was out with him for 20 minutes without a single shiver. He didn't like getting it on at first and tried to pull it off a few times, but go used to it real quick. He can run, jump, and zip around like the maniac he is with no problem. Highly recommend.",1453075200,4,589,3.9166666666666665

7324835,4,B01147YQKW,"First of all i got this at walmart but still i wanted to write a reciew. R.L Stine is awesome!!!! I Love goosebumps,r.l stine haunting hour, and fear street books!!!!! He tells the most amazing stories that r sure to creep u out!!!! I can't wait to see what he comes up with nexti love all his shows and books!!! Anyway this movie was awesome creepy entertaining:) the movie didn't scare me too much but the clown totally creep me out because it almost look like the clown on that stepin king movie i think it calls the thing except in this movie he was mainly a doing funny things but still totally creepy i have a feeling they base the clown on the steping king movie i think the two of the scariest parts for me was when he first appear in the movie and in the end of the movie when the characters and monsters are dancing in the end he comes really close to the screen totally creepy!!!!! Then again the clown probually wouldn't be scary to me if i wasn't a little girl at the time and saw the thing and saw the clown open his mouth. Revealing his large teeth and eats the little boy so i guess i have clown issues anyway the movie was totally awesome it was creepy surprising and I'm glad there was a happy ending also that the two main characters finally end up together!!!! I love happy endings!!!",1449792000,,1304,4.240963855421687

7324841,5,B01147YQKW,"You can't go wrong with anything R.L. Stine writes.  This movie was no exception.  It is a great way to introduce kids to the horror genre without scaring them.  The characters and story are plausible enough to keep the kids interested, yet over done just enough to let kids draw the line between what is real and make believe on their own.  An in true R.L. Stine fashion, there is a happy ending.",1446422400,2,397,4.397260273972603

7324843,3,B01147YQKW,"This horror comedy for children and teens might as well be titled Something Wicked This Way Comes: A New Generation.  Both this film and the 1983 Ray Bradbury adaptation (and presumably the 1962 Bradbury book as well) are about a traveling carnival that comes to a small town and tempts people with glimpses of their darkest desires.  The main villain here even looks very much like Jonathan Pryce's sinister carnival barker from the 1983 film, there named Mr. Dark and here Dr. Hysteria, but the genuine danger of Ray Bradbury's take is replaced with the safety of silly camp here.  It's not likely even the smallest children will be scared by anything that happens in Cabinet of Souls.  The TV movie even breaks the fourth wall by having the actors who played heroes and villains alike all dancing together to a pop song about friendship over the closing credits--it really doesn't get much more safe than that.

The target audience of children and their tween siblings will probably like this a whole lot more than I did.  I kept wishing the movie would try at least a little to be scary or I found myself trying to ignore the bad habits that lead actress Dove Cameron, who is mostly likable, picked up from her extensive experience acting in Disney Channel TV programs--she sometimes overacts very broadly to the point of mugging, which can be a major distraction when you are trying to buy into her character.  The only other thing I've personally seen Dove Cameron in was Barely Lethal, but she was a lot more effective and believable there.

R.L. Stine's Monsterville: Cabinet of Souls is mostly watchable even if you happen to be an adult but it isn't particularly scary or funny and offers nothing to suggest that author R.L. Stine will be remembered with the same reverence as Ray Bradbury 50 years from now--it's disposable and silly and most definitely not the stuff of nightmares.  Unlike Ray Bradbury or Roald Dahl (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory) R.L. Stine seems to pander to his young audience, making his work easy to outgrow.",1446163200,,2047,4.776203966005665

7324845,5,B01147YQKW,"My daughter and I watched this movie for the first time on Netflix 2 weeks ago. We both loved it, I couldn't take my eyes off the screen. I thought there was some scary scenes that would possibly scare my 7 year old, she didn't seem to mind. But then again, she loves scary movies a lot more then kids her age. I would personally recommend ages 10 and up, but each parent to their own!  But all and it's it's a great little flick!",1445817600,,430,4.0588235294117645
