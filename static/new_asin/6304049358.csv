765187,5,6304049358,"I use this in a class on Women and Exercise for both high school and in a modified version for non-biology major entering college students.  They all find it fascinating and it leads to great discussions about anatomy, physiology and exercise.  Kudos to WGBH and PBS.",1183075200,,267,4.782608695652174
765188,2,6304049358,"(Please see my review of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/DVD-edition/dp/B0002ABU48/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">DVD edition</a>&nbsp;of this title.)",1172016000,,193,15.166666666666666
765189,2,6304049358,"I've purchased the DVD and seen a public library copy of the prerecorded VHS videocassette and can tell you that BOTH are missing the segment where they illustrate how the body's immune system works to fight infection using the case of ice climber Rob Taylor when he broke his ankle while climbing Mt. Kilimanjaro.  This, to me, was the most fascinating and important part of the originally 1.5 hour-long program (usually shown during PBS pledge drives) and they left it out completely!

I also noticed that the background music had been altered from that used in the original broadcast (perhaps because of copyright issues).  I'd have been willing to overlook that little detail had all of the informational material been kept intact.  This just compounded my frustration with the product.

If you have a taped copy of ""The Universe Within"" the way it was originally broadcast (even with the pledge breaks), consider yourself lucky.  Save your money and let WGBH Boston Video know they should know better than to sell its supporters less than what they deserve, expect, and especially PAY for.",1172016000,12,1094,4.983516483516484
765190,5,6304049358,"A great resource to help in the understanding of your body. It increased my appreciation of how miraculously we are made. This movie is a great tool to use in health education. Simple step by step explanation to the complex design of the human body.

Anatomy made simple.",1157155200,,271,4.645833333333333
765191,2,6304049358,"I purchased this DVD to use in one of my classes.  I fall asleep everytime I watch it...I don't think that is a very good omen.

The product arrived in perfect shape....., but the content was less than thrilling.",1127174400,2,212,4.410256410256411
765192,5,6304049358,"I teach middle school science and health in North Carolina.  This video supports the 7th grade science and 6th-8th grade health curriculums.  My students love this video and so do I.  They alternately gross out (their terminology) and are fascinated by the trip through the digestive tract.  We measure out on our classroom floor just how far a man can long jump, and we are in awe; I draw a diagram on the board of the climber's foot as he looked and saw the sole pointed the wrong way and we realize how badly broken and twisted his leg was.  We watch on video and then measure on paper how long a developing human is at different times inside its mother.  At the end of the year, they get to watch a movie of their choosing (within reason!).  Last year, my 7th grade science class chose this video over all other commercial movies or cartoons to watch, even though they had already seen it.  So we did!  Quite a feat to please a group of 7th graders, who generally cannot agree on anything except apparently on the value of this video.",1072656000,,1038,4.392670157068062
7859693,5,6304049358,Science department is happy we were able to find DVD version of this film.,1519171200,,74,4.357142857142857
7859694,1,6304049358,Very disappointed that the section that illustrates how the immune system works is not on this version. I think the jacket should be different from the original if the content is not going to be the same as the original. Pretty deceptive.,1476835200,,238,4.690476190476191
7859695,2,6304049358,"The video format is broken into four segments, all on human physiology and the immune system.  When I received my DVD, the immune section was omitted.  I have been showing that segment of the video to my biology students for the past 6 years and wanted an newer DVD copy.  With the immune segment gone, the DVD is worthless to me.  All segments of the video are fantastic, but I needed the part on the immune system.",1462579200,,416,4.363636363636363
7859696,3,6304049358,"I am a middle school health teacher and I purchased this DVD for my students. I previously had this on VHS and was looking for a replacement. The video itself is somewhat out-dated....my kids can tell it has some age to it, but it is still good information. Please note that the ""Immune System"" episode is not on the DVD, but I was not planning on using that one in my class",1455408000,,374,4.208333333333333
7859697,5,6304049358,"A great video I use in excerpts to relate human physiology to athletics, in a biology course for non majors.",1414972800,,108,4.45
7859698,5,6304049358,"This is by far my favorite video to use as a review or overview of the human body system.  It is appropriate for more advanced middle school through high school biology students.  The music and the video clips of the athletes are a little dated, but the content and presentation are wonderful.",1367107200,,293,4.615384615384615
7859699,5,6304049358,"This video includes incredible real footage of the stomach moving, an ovary releasing an egg, the inside of your small intestine, and so much more! I highly recommend this for any life science teacher. Personally, I teach high school biology and show it (or at least sections of it) every year. It makes anatomy and physiology come to life.",1364774400,,340,4.779661016949152
7859700,5,6304049358,I just wished it was all longer. The videography is tremendous. You see things that were done for the first time ever.,1361577600,,118,4.409090909090909
7859701,5,6304049358,"I think my title pretty much sums up my opinion. It is an older movie, some of the clothes people wear in it are funny, but there is still a lot of really great information that I found very useful.",1244073600,,198,3.975
7859702,2,6304049358,"I have vcr version of the video. I use the Immune System section showing climbing accident, and the related Immune Response to an injury. The DVD version does not have this episode, although the title, ""Universe Within"" from NOVA is the same. Kind of a ripoff. Thought DVD would be the same as VCR version......darn it.",1220313600,2,319,4.714285714285714
