I bought this ''' FAN FAVORITES COLLECTION ''', along with
Agatha Christie's ""POIROT"".
One of these, two, series had something like 14 seasons.
Maybe one of these samplers will convince me to buy MORE.
Believe it or not, I've NOT seen either of these BBC programs.
At this price, I'll be able to see what I've been missing...",1499212800,,393,4.7101449275362315

Well they are all good, but having watched about all there is of Agatha Christie that has been dramatized for TV, I agree these are top-notch. A fine choice for the beginning follower of Agatha and the film adaptations.

Miss Marple (Geraldine McEwan [`Vanity Fair', `The Magdalene Sisters'] and Julia McKenzie [`Cranford']) is an aging sleuth with a quick mind that eventually gets the bad guys. She's always a step ahead of the coppers. These originated on Masterpiece Mystery. You'll also get to see many major British guest stars, for example Derek Jacobi (Cadfael)  in episode 1. McKenzie's Marple takes the lead beginning in episode 4.
 It's a great start (set), in my opinion, even though I was not a voter. Better is to own them all, but that takes time to acquire. Check the list carefully and don't duplicate, there are too many excellent episodes to own.
