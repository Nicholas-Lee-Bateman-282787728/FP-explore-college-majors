These dvd's are a complete waste of your money. There are so many places and books available for AE that have taken the time to give you complete information written by professionals and supply you with footage to follow along. I purchased these dvd'd because of the 5 star rating written by obvious friends of the producer. If there was a lower rating than 1 star, believe me I would have given it.",1238457600,,538,4.233009708737864
8410328,5,B000I0QMV8,"This dvd is exactly what I was after.  The DVD only goes for 30 or so minutes BUT it demonstrates how easy it is to do stuff in After Effects - if you know how.

I have purchased Vol1 and 3 (and need to order 2) and love them both.  I highly recommend this dvd.  The production isn't professional but it doesnt need to be.  I just wanted to know how to things in AE without the smoke and mirrors.. and this DVD was straight to the point.

What I also liked about this particular volume was that it showed a number of ways to achieve the rain effect.",1215043200,,549,3.9908256880733943
