This movie needs to be watched because it educates and entertains at the same time.  I had no idea who Mr. Hodges was or what he did, but I sure found out and learned a lesson.  The lesson is this:  Heroes......real Heroes are just ordinary people doing extra-ordinary acts of courage.  If you think this is a military film then don't bother to watch it.  Instead, look to be inspired.",1407974400,,489,4.5

3566780,4,B001FB4Z0Y,"A poignant connection to a part of our history which should never be forgotten. It was an amazing opportunity to connect with real examples of our ""greatest generation"". I would like to think that all Americans would want the experience.",1406160000,,237,4.95
3566781,2,B001FB4Z0Y,"First of all, I want to say that I LOVE our veterans.  My father was in WWII and I hold a special place in my heart for all the WWII veterans.  My review has nothing to do with the great veterans in this film.  My review is strictly about the film itself.

I was expecting a real documentary.  But this film is shot at a dinner honoring a veteran and is more like a souvenir those attending the dinner would receive.  This is certainly not a commercial type of film.  I honestly cant believe it was ever a commercial release for public viewing.  If this were a high school film project, the student would . . . at best. . . receive a D.

I LOVE watching films where veterans tell their story in their own words.  One that comes to mind is Medal of Honor.  This is a GREAT film and I HIGHLY recommend it.  Its available for free with Amazon Prime.  If you don't have Amazon Prime, its worth the $2.99 to watch it.  Every man. . . woman. . . and child. . . should be required to watch this movie.

Thank You, Mr. Hodges has a little of that, but FAR too little.  The majority of the film is taken up with the host of the dinner introducing the twelve veterans in attendance to the dinner.

One of the worst parts of this film. . . . I have NO idea who Mr. Hodges is!!!  If the film is supposed to be about Mr. Hodges, then who is he???  Im kind of assuming he is someone who worked either for or through the Red Cross to negotiate the exchange of prisoners between the Germans and Allied Forces.  But I have NO idea about what makes him so special.  I was simply baffled by this.",1390608000,6,1577,4.055194805194805
3566782,5,B001FB4Z0Y,A true story of real heroes!  These are some of the ones who fought so gallantly to keep this great country free.  We all owe them a huge debt of gratitude!,1382227200,,156,4.0
3566783,5,B001FB4Z0Y,I loved the stories of the men that Mr. Hodges saved in a prisoner exchange he negotiated with the Germans.,1380240000,,107,4.4
3566784,3,B001FB4Z0Y,"This showcases veterans of WWII who were POWs in Europe, and who reconvened several years ago to honor the man who, working for the Red Cross, arranged their release through a prisoner exchange with the Germans.  Before watching this you should watch ""For One English Officer"", a more professional documentary, which explains the whole incident in detail.  That will give you the background for watching this film, basically a video of the reunion dinner of these men, and some information on their stories.  This is only for those who want to dig deeper or who, as I am, are suckers for patriotic stories of old vets!  Great for Memorial Day.",1369440000,3,643,4.818181818181818
3566785,4,B001FB4Z0Y,"This program includes a ceremony and interviews with several WWII veterans about a genuine World War II hero and events surrounding his heroism.  It's not a dramatically constructed documentary, but it is a fitting tribute and historically informative.  You'll find it valuable if you want to hear real veterans talking about their experience and related anecdotes -- with some pictures.",1366329600,7,387,5.433333333333334
3566786,5,B001FB4Z0Y,"This is a documentary primarily shown regionally on PBS (Alabama and surrounding areas).  It is about a WWII American POW, Andrew Gerow Hodges, who first worked to get needed food and supplies for his fellow prisoners, and then later initiated POW exchanges with the Germans, freeing about 150 prisoners for both sides.

Mr. Hodges, a graduate of then Howard College, now Samford University, went on to a distinguished civilian career. He was later named a lifetime trustee of Samford, located in Birmingham, Alabama.

The documentary is very well done and uses archival film. I recommend it not only to people interested in WWII history, but also to people interested in unusual acts of creative thinking, bravery, and human kindness amid difficult circumstances.
