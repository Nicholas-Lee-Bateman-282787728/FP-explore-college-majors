8218460,5,B000VED5QQ,"I watched this mini documentary on Youtube when it was first released and when I saw that it was going to be put on DVD, I knew that I just HAD to get it.

It's about 2 ""phroggers"" that live in someone's house for a week w/o getting caught. They eat their food, use their computer, smoke on the roof...and never get caught, (although they come close a few times).

This is a documentary that you'll want to watch with a group of friends. The reactions on your friends' faces will be priceless.",1275782400,,493,4.290322580645161
