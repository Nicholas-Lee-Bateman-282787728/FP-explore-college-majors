4670014,1,B005EXA86E,I saw this years ago and was it a let down. Steve Cochran was much better in the Untouchables version(The Purple Gang)as Eddie Fletcher. Its a shame they didn't consider using him. If you have the Untouchables set with this episode id stick with that.,1340409600,,251,4.6
4670015,3,B005EXA86E,"The Purple Gang was a bunch of Jewish gangsters who ruled Detroit during the Prohibition era. They were so crazy that the Mafia did not get a foothold in Detroit until after the Purples self-destructed. Rumor has it that Capone hired the Purples for the St. Valentine's Day Massacre. They were the most deadly gangsters America has ever seen and someday Hollywood will do a proper movie on them. Until then, we have this movie. It is not bad. Whoever wrote it knew the real story as some of the events and places are accurate. There was a""Honeyboy"" Miller in the Purple Gang but he was a minor figure and the character in the movie is more likely based on a couple of different members of the gang. Probably Eddie Fletcher and or Abe Axler. The 4 Bernstein Brothers were the brains behind the Purple Gang. This movie is a blend of fact and fiction. If you just want to see a gangster yarn, this isn't bad. Not as good as the old Cagney gangster films but as good or better than what they were turning out in the late 50s and early 60s. This is real similar to an extended Untouchables episode. Barry Sullivan even comes off a little like Robert Stack playing Elliot Ness. If you want the know the real story of the Purple Gang, there is an excellent book on the topic by Paul R. Kavieff titled ""The Purple Gang: Organized crime in Detroit 1910-1945"".",1336435200,4,1350,4.42570281124498
4670016,3,B005EXA86E,"Robert Blake has always been a dedicated actor and an outspoken personality.
He began acting in ""Our Gang"" comedies in 1939, and deserved an Oscar for
enacting real-life mass murderer Perry Smith in 1967's ""In Cold Blood.""  When
Blake would guest on The Tonight Show, Johnny Carson would just throw up his arms
and laugh helplessly at Blake's hilarious rantings and ravings about myriad topics.
And of course, he was the defendant in both criminal and civil murder trials for
the shooting death of his second wife.  Blake walked away freed but bankrupt.

In 1960, Blake had a good young adult role as Honeyboy Willard, the coldblooded,
ruthless, milk-drinking leader of Detroit's 1930's Purple Gang.  Honeyboy starts
his criminal career leading robberies of mom-and-pop grocery stores, then graduates
to muscling his way into the lucrative bootlegging of Canadian whiskey.  Along the
way are such sordid episodes as the rape and murder of a ""progressive do-gooder""
juvenile social worker; the physical terrorizing of a pregnant woman by masked
hoodlums; Willard's tommy-gun mowing down a trio of rival gangsters; and his callous
fitting of his mistrusted best friend with a ""cement overcoat.""  Between these evil
tidbits are screen montages of blazing guns, whirling gambling wheels, and model-T
car chases and crashes. Big. tough Barry Sullivan plays the honest police detective
who must endure a despicable attack on his own family and bring the jabbering and
claustrophobic Honeyboy to justice.

""The Purple Gang"" was one in a rash of gangster movies to appear in cinemas after
the huge T.V. success of ""The Untouchables.""  Such frequent ""gangster actors"" as
Joseph Turkel and Paul Dubov strut their stuff, uttering tough bromides to Blake.
It's not a world-beater, but should satisfy addicts of prohibition crime dramas,
where women are as likely as men to get blasted.",1321747200,10,1873,5.22
4670017,5,B005EXA86E,"This is a classic gangster movie that I saw when I was a kid. It is well worth watching and I certainly enjoyed watching it again, since it has been so many years since its debut in 1959.",1470873600,,187,3.9473684210526314

4670023,3,B005EXA86E,"This movie was released in 1960, but looks like a routine 1930's black and white gangster epic, complete with the usual hokey plot of the '30's. I wasn't surprised to read that some of the car chase scenes actually were lifted from '30's movies. I enjoyed watching it once, and then donated it to my local library.",1432339200,,314,4.526315789473684
4670024,5,B005EXA86E,"One of my favorite movies as a kid. It made a big impression on us as kids. This movie was about a youth gang who had ambition about getting into the big time in the adult world of crime. It takes place in Detroit.

There was a bunch of kids who saw this movie as kids in Italian Harlem. They wanted to do the same thing. They called themselves the NY Purple gang and did the exact same thing in real life. This movie was impossible to fine until relatively recently.",1429747200,,467,4.131868131868132

4670027,3,B005EXA86E,"The cast is the most interesting part of the movie. Blake chewed the scenery up but gave a decent performance. Barry Sullivan (The Bad and the Beautiful) and Joe Turkel (Paths of Glory, Blade Runner) are always a pleasure to watch. The direction of the movie was OK but the low budget production values brought the whole enterprise down. The script was weak and the voice over superfluous
( an obvious take on Walter Winchell's far better narration in the ""Untouchables""). "" Mad Dog Coll"" had even cheaper production costs but is a more effective film. "" The Rise and Fall of Legs Diamond"" is a much more entertaining movie.",1427068800,,624,4.681818181818182

4670030,4,B005EXA86E,"A pretty good old-school gangster film, with the usual superficial approach.  For some reason the film goes out of its way to avoid revealing that the Purple Gang was very much a Jewish gang. I don't know why they did that. Maybe names like Burnstein, Rosenburg, and Leebowitz (shudder...he was simply horrifying...) don't sound tough enough. The Purple Gang killed an average of 2 people per week for 5 years--that's 500 people in 5 years.

Although the film follows the Public Enemy/Scarface mold, the hero is not a tragic one like Cagney or Muni, he's a vicious lowlife who kills innocent women. There was no catharsis for me at the close, though at least one reviewer here was pulling for him. Still, he is a somewhat complex and interesting character. Freud might have something to say about his substituting power of violence for any sexual/romantic activity.

Kind of funny is the Public Service Announcement quality of the film, with the monologue intro and ""We will never give up..."" statements by Barry Sullivan throughout the dialogue.  This, along with the black-and-white (though the vast majority of movies were in color when this was made) makes it seem about 8 years older than it is, which is not a bad thing, necessarily.

I very much agree with one reviewer that Hollywood should get it right. These guys sat right in the oasis of Prohibition, with tons of liquor just across the bridge over the sometimes-frozen river.  Whereas guys like Luciano and Schultz and Capone had stills and breweries to supply their speaks, the Purple Gang were at the wholesale level. Probably, no one out-earned Capone, but I believe these guys at least rivaled the likes of Luciano or Dutch Schultz.  It would be a great movie.",1412899200,3,1727,4.85374149659864
4670031,4,B005EXA86E,Robert Blake was great even though the movie was far from the real story of Detroits infamous Purple Gang. Good DVD to add to collection.,1410307200,,137,4.52
4670032,4,B005EXA86E,This book/DVD is a part of a series of books we ordered to learn all about the original bad boys in America. Wow! Wow! Wow!,1389225600,,123,3.96
4670033,5,B005EXA86E,"Good, solid gangster movie from the black and white era. When you watch this you have to understand a few things. First, it is an anti-crime propaganda movie. Much like the anti-Hitler movies made just prior to WW2. The writers and director try and make Barry Sullivan out to be an anti-crime hero that gives up his personal life to stop the Purple Gang. Yeah right...like that would EVER happen. Secondly, this movie was made in the heydey of ""psychological explainations"" for EVERYTHING. So they blamed the members of the Purple Gang and especially the leader, Robert Blake's character, as being mentally unstable and having a poor upbringing. It was kinda cool to see the Purple Gang rub out the shrink that was trying to protect them with her psycho-babble.
Robert Blake was just plain AWESOME as the leader of the Purple Gang. You end up hoping he will beat the cops and not get caught. But since this is a message movie of ""crime doesn't pay"", you know in advance that will never happen. Blake is at his best playing the cold, cruel gangster shooting up the competition. The psycho scenes and a terrible ending that makes no sense are the worst parts of the movie. In one scene one of the gang members suggests they leave town for a while to let things cool off. Blake tells him ""and let the Mafia take over? Besides, that's what lawyers are for"". That is exactly what a gang member would say. But then at the ending, the propaganda takes over and Blake is a crying baby cowering in the corner after Sullivan slaps him. A more real ending would have been for Blake to say ""Forgetaboutit, see my lawyer"" and sneering in Sullivan's face.",1388534400,5,1641,4.585034013605442
