7913340,3,B00000JS8C,"The Punchy Pokemon-It's pretty good episode with 3 good fights and good reminder of pro wrestling. There's only one thing that bags me. It's the scene where Meowth went under the ring then placed some glue on the ring so that Hitmonchan can get stuck. I would've have mind so much but I know where that idea came from. It was the same idea that Hector used on Heathcliff from the 1980's episode: Boom Boom Pussini. Sparks Fly For Magnemite-A dumb love filler. The only thing that fans will remember that epsiode is the debut of Muk. Dig Those Diglett-Almost feels like a Captain Planet episode. The only thing that fans will remember this episode is the debut of Arbok & Weezing. Overall, It's not great but pretty good. I give this disc a 6 out of 10.",1314662400,2,752,4.456521739130435

7913342,4,B00000JS8C,"Pokemon fans new to the DVD side of things should probably start off with Poke Friends or Thundershock, but for what its worth, this is still a great trio of episodes from Pokemon's 'golden' era.
The first episode on the DVD features Pokemon like Primeape and Hitmonchan in a fighting tournament - very cool episode and virtually the only episode in the series to feature some of these Pokemon.  The Grimer/Magnemite episode is just kinda there...nothing too major aside from Ash catching a Muk.  The third episode is better than it sounds, featuring the Diglett and Dugtrio, as well as Team Rocket's Pokemon meeting their evolution.
I have most of the released Pokemon DVDs...like I said, I wouldn't reccomend this as the first choice, but you won't be dissapointed in it either way.",977788800,5,784,4.887218045112782
7913343,5,B00000JS8C,"I love Pokemon, and ""Pokemon Fighting Tournament""is one of my favorite videos. It contains 3 episodes,first in""The Punchy Pokemon""Ash enters Primeape in a tournament for fighting pokemon,next in ""Sparks Fly For Magnamite"" a group of Grimer and Muk cause a power shortage in Grindgy City and it up to Ash and his friends to save the sick pokemon at the pokemon center,then in ""Dig Those Digglet"" Ash and his friends run into his rival Gary,but theres no time for a pokemon battle they have to solve a problem with Digglet and Dugtrio first, and Team Rocket try to evolve Ekans and Koffings. I recomend this video to all Pokemon fans.",973296000,3,632,4.754545454545455
7913344,5,B00000JS8C,In  sparks  fly for magnimite  these grimer stop water in the power plant of gringy city  and ash catches a pokemon if you need too know .  then  in dig those digllet  the digllet and dugtrio destroy a dam  and  ekans  and  koffing evolve.,959299200,,239,4.204545454545454
