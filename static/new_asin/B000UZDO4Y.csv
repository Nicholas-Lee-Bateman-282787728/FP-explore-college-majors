8215824,1,B000UZDO4Y,"I heard that Chris Rock and Meaghan Good wer starring in a movie together and was so excited to see it.  Needless to say, after I got home and got the kids situated, my husband and I popped in the DVD and I hate to say this, but it really wasn't worth the time, effort or even the money we spend on the rental.  Chris Rock plays some sex-crazed madman that constantly obsesses over women's bodies, which kinda left me feeling like he shouldn't have gotten married in the first place.  He made it seeem like marriage was a farce and that you only had to be committed because of the kids. Later on in the movie you see that he was about to have an affair with Goode, but he thinks of his kid and rushed home to his wife. WOW, I thought the reason you wouldn't cheat on the person you suposedly loved was because of that reason alone, YOU LOVE THEM.  I felt this couldn've been better writtin and shouldn't have shown alot of REAL struggles that marriages REALLY go through, not this perverse side of things.",1197936000,,1005,4.273684210526316
