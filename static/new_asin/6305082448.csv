966359,5,6305082448,"This movie is, without a doubt, one of the best WWII movies.  Told from the German point of view, it is very graphic and depicts ""life"" on the Eastern Front.
James Coburn and Max Schell are great  protaganists.  The combat is very realistic.",915494400,2,241,4.558139534883721
966360,3,6305082448,"Although CROSS OF IRON approaches neither the level of other WWII films (DAS BOOT, STALINGRAD, THE WANNSEE CONFERENCE) nor the overall excellence of other Peckinpah works (RIDE THE HIGH COUNTRY, THE WILD BUNCH), it  remains a valuable film for one main reason: it is one of the few films to  deal with the WWII German-Russian front.  CROSS OF IRON convincingly  portrays the violence and savagery that drove German and Russian soldiers  in that theater of the war.  For that alone, the film is worth viewing.  After experiencing CROSS OF IRON, one can only feel that the German  soldiers in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and THE BIG RED ONE had it easy.",912124800,3,643,4.781818181818182
966361,4,6305082448,"I've been looking forward to buying this video since seeing it 20 years  ago.  As a war movie it compares highly with Saving Pvt Ryan in its  depiction of combat at the squad level.  However, it is unique in that it  is follows a German squad through battle on the Russian front.  Gripping,  violent, suspenseful and entertaining.  A sure hit for military buffs.

966632,3,6305082448,"I was really expecting more outta this film.  WWII made a strong comeback in the late 60's and 70's with epic films like Battle of Britain and Midway.  Even the smaller films like Eagle Has Landed felt cinematic.  Iron Cross both on scope and content really felt like a TV movie of the week w/ an inflated budget.  Right off the bat, James Colburn as a german sergeant is unbelievable.  Almost as bad as Chuck Conners as a Brit sub commander.  Colburn isn't bad, just really miscast.  Which is too bad, since the rest of the cast is very good, especially James Mason and Max Schell.  But the film just felt small while trying to look big.  Confined sets and locations that look like they're all on the same back lot.  Even  Pekinpah's signature violence looks stage-y and as if it were done on a time and budget crunch.  Nowhere near as good as the ending fight of Wild Bunch.  Lastly, being a film of it's era, poor David Warner is given nothing to do but sit around and comment on the absurdity of war.  Ugh.

It's an OK film but only for Peckinpah or 70s WWII film completists.",1508630400,,1080,4.35678391959799

The book which I read prior to seeing the movie was much better, but they did an outstanding job at showing how bad war is. The German Army was in total disaray and in retreat not fighting for the Fatherland, but to save their own lives and cursing their deranged leader. Acting was quite good and I thought James Coburn was perfect for his role. The action was great and this movie is worth every penny.

966756,5,6305082448,"Cross of Iron is the only war movie director Sam Peckinpah ever made, and it is a fantastic piece of cinema that will stay relevant for years to come. And the reason for that is because the battle scenes are all done with real actors and equipment. This film was made way before the development of CGI and it shows in the superb action sequences which are numerous. The film will also stand for generations to come because it depicts the greatest land conflict in history between two countries, Germany & Russia during WWII. Some will argue that the film has too many battle scenes but  I do not hold that view. While it's a story about the Germans slow retreat from Russia, it focuses on a small company of german troups led by war weary Cpl Steiner played by James Coburn. Maximillian Schell plays Coburn's new Captain, an aristocratic prussian officer who seeks the Iron Cross that Coburn already possesses. James Mason is also present as the Colonel in overall command, who overlooks Steiner's insubordination because he is such a superb soldier in battle. The story goes that Peckinpah ran out of money to finish the film and that the ending was largely improvised by Coburn & Schell so the picture could be finished. You'd never know that by seeing the finished product and this has to go down as one of the finest war films ever made in my view.",1500940800,9,1352,4.586776859504132

There is one battle, however, that makes it all worthwhile. When you see real Russian T-34 tanks attack the German lines. The story of the remnants of the German forces making their way is salvageable and the action is pretty good.

967079,5,6305082448,"This is just remarkable. The film quality is just great. I also have the 2006 wide screen speicial edition, that DVD is pretty good too, but there was too much motion blur on a high def tv.  The 2006 Henstooth version looks better on a standard analog tv. So I got the blue ray and I'm not disappointed, its so crystal clear but it still has the old 1977 saturated look to it, but just more clear. There is a very little slight motion blur at times but not nearly as bad as the 2006 DVD other wise the motion of the blu ray is tight and fluid. It looks so real it almost feels like you're there with Steiner, Brandt and Stransky, it feels like you could reach out touch them. When seeing blood and explosions it seems its gonna splatter in you're face.
  It's the Japanese studio  canal release I it plays in region A, in America which is where I live and its in english language. It plays in other regions too.",1481932800,8,911,4.188571428571429

The only drawback is it is its 132 minute run time. I compared it to my 143 minute RT VHS tape, and there are several scenes that are shortened.

967084,5,6305082448,"Great Movie!  It is not often that war movies succeed in showing us the true grit of war (Hollywood always wants to sneak in meta-messages!).  The character Steiner embodies the grizzled, experienced non-com, while the character Stransky embodies the haughty, superior Army Officer.  The relationships and interplay between the officers and the non-com (Steiner) are very well done (very accurate).  The movie doesn't get it done as well as the book, but it is a good movie nonetheless (I recommend both the book and this movie).",1474588800,,529,5.116279069767442
967085,4,6305082448,I had never heard of this movie and I had thought I watched every WW2 movie ever made. It was great. George Coburn stole the show as Steiner. There are very few Western movies made about the horror of the Eastern front. And it was nice to see German soldiers not portrayed as soulless beasts like in most movies. They were men serving each other and their country however wrong its politics and leadership were. This film definitely deserves more attention and a remake.,1473897600,,470,4.607142857142857

The video quality, according to those who have made this comparison, is roughly equal. The difference between the two versions, beside the obvious region coding, is the Japanese release has no ""extras"", which the UK release has and which are apparently above average. So, for now at least, if you are looking for a blu-ray version which will play on US BD players, this is the only choice and it is just the movie. For those with region free BD players, the choice would be the UK version. Hopefully this film will receive a US release, with extras, at some point but who knows.",1465344000,3,693,4.507936507936508
967195,5,6305082448,"Sam Peckinpah's only war movie, maybe a bit less bloody than one would expect, but kinetic and engaging all the same.  It's an anti-war movie really, and its focus is what modern combat does to people, quite apart from issues of the politics that lead to wars in the first place.  The soldiers here are German, retreating in 1943 from the ill-fated Russian campaign, and even at the level of the regimental command (Colonel Brandt [James Mason], in this case, and his disillusioned aide Kiesel, played by David Warner), survival with as few losses as possible is what's on their mind.  This is very different from the situation in a movie like Stanley Kubrick's ""Paths of Glory,"" set during World War 1, where the General Staff of the French forces, even though quite close to the front line trenches, act as though the civilized amenities of life still can be carried on.  The dramatic conflict in ""Cross of Iron"" focuses more on the conflict between Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell), a Prussian aristocrat whose sole reason for requesting a transfer to the Russian front is to get himself awarded an Iron Cross, and the highly competent Lance-Corporal Steiner (James Coburn), who immediately understands that Stransky is useless in active duty, even though he, Stransky, outranks him.  Stransky needs Steiner's letter of recommendation for the honor, and Steiner isn't about to give it.  (Stransky has managed to elicit one letter from another subordinate officer by blackmailing him with knowledge of his homosexuality).  The animosity between Steiner and Stransky is quite complicated: it's partly a matter of social class, and partly a matter of professional judgement on Steiner's part, and it's partly moral disgust, for Stransky shows himself to be arbitrarily cruel for cruelty's sake, even though he's obviously scared stiff when the shells start falling.  The texture of human interaction among Brandt, Kiesel, Stransky, and Steiner is consistently interesting, even if, finally, it isn't what the movie is about.

The movie is about what men are driven to in combat -- and the question of the extent to which their humanity or moral compass is compromised inevitably in such situations.  Steiner and his troop are the men who are actually doing the fighting, and Steiner's main aim is to protect them as best he can in a retreat.  That's a humane aim, but in order to succeed with it, even Steiner takes action that by any standards is ugly and morally compromised.  But the movie doesn't make the characters talk about this -- it puts them in situations where they have to talk of what they're going to do in the next five or ten minutes, and it's up to us to react to the moral issues that their actions raise.  The extended scene in which Steiner's troop gains control of a bridge guarded by Russian women soldiers manifests more moral complexity than most movies can manage (avoiding spoilers here!), and again, at the end, where Steiner comes to realize the full extent of Stransky's animosity, the audience has to wonder whether Steiner's own judgement has been warped by the stress of his experiences and whether he is or isn't really sane by that point.

There's no overt message, but the idea that war and something like insanity go together is as clear here as in, say, ""Catch-22,"" where the connection is more explicitly developed.  For this to be communicated without the discursive dimension of ""Catch-22,"" the combat scenes have to somehow convey the insanity and confusion in visual terms, and I think Peckinpah succeeds brilliantly in doing this.  The Russians advancing out of the mists, the difficulty, for the audience, in always being able to tell German from Russian, the great scene in which a Russian tank seems to be remorselessly pursuing Steiner's troop through the ruins of a factory, and even the details of the effects of shelling on the HQ posts where Brandt and Kiesel are trying to hold things together -- it's all superbly realized, with lots of local suspense to keep us engaged, even as we're horrified.  This is late Peckinpah -- 1977 -- and apparently he was in a downward spiral in his life then, but he pulled this movie off brilliantly.  I'm not sure I want to see it again, but I'll remember it!",1463616000,,4252,4.890125173852573

The gear and uniforms are pretty accurate except for the T-34/85 Tanks the Russians use ( too early in the war it is pre 1944) probably some other stuff thats pretty minor as well. And well it is Peckinpah. Not a happy flag-waving movie at all. Not too happy of an ending either. But what did you expect. When I first saw this film many years ago I was of the opinion that in a contest between 2 loathsome factions ( Nazi's and communists) not really sad to see either side perish ( lots of perishing going on here), some of the characters are played as unwilling villains/dupes and some are less overtly evil than the usual goose-stepping SS drones that are the expected fare.

967873,5,6305082448,"Amazingly, Sam Peckinpah's 1977 war film Cross of Iron is still not widely regarded as one of his finest works. Made at a time when the great director was waging personal battles against alcohol and cocaine and was considered by the Hollywood establishment unreliable to the extent that he was uninsurable and forced to go to Europe for funding, the film's nihilistic anti-war message failed to find audiences anywhere except in Germany. The lack of commercial success and support within the Hollywood industry consigned it to oblivion along with all Peckinpah films post-The Getaway (1972). Tales of the director's drunken and drug-fuelled escapades during a deeply troubled shoot made him all put unemployable thereafter. The following Convoy (1978) dbcle drove the nails deeper into the coffin of his Hollywood career and 12 years later the great man was dead, a drunk, drug-addled has-been in the eyes of many. Posterity has since resurrected his reputation. Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid (1973) and Bring Me the Head of Alfredo Garcia (1974) are now rightly acknowledged as masterpieces, but Cross of Iron continues to languish in obscurity. It did receive digitalization in 2011 and was shown in a few cinemas across the UK. Studio Canal has since released a Blu-ray version with a documentary about the film attached to it. And yet the silence rumbles on despite the championship of Orson Welles no less and the respected critic Ian Johnson. So let me lend my support to the handful of reviewers here and push the argument that Cross of Iron is one of the best war films ever made.

The film is an adaptation (by Julius J. Epstein, James Hamilton and Walter Kelley) of the Willi Heinrich 1956 novel, Willing Flesh. The action centers on a platoon of German soldiers fighting on the Russian front in late 1943 when they were consciously chasing a lost cause. Corporal Rolf Steiner (a superb James Coburn) is the inspirational leader of his group of loyal salt of the earth soldiers who will follow him into their graves if they have to. As the film progresses they realize that the enemy they are fighting is not Russia, but the upper classes within their own German army. Above Steiner there are Colonel Brandt (James Mason) and Captain Kiesel (David Warner) who recognize their man as one of the few who could make a difference in saving what's left of Germany. Into the losing situation on the front comes Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell), a cowardly member of a rich upper class Junker family for whom winning personal honor is more important than his country. He attempts to blackmail Steiner into recommending him for the iron cross, without which he will not be accepted back into his society after the war. Steiner hates all officers and stonewalls both Brandt and Stransky. The latter takes advantage of Steiner's rear-guard platoon who he arranges to have cut-off from the retreating army. Steiner and his men trapped within Russian-held territory, they attempt to fall back on their own line wearing Russian army uniforms. Stransky sees his chance - with Steiner dead the iron cross will be his...

Here are 5 things which support the film's claim to greatness:
1. A precise and original, if bleakly pessimistic philosophical framework offered by the use of the children's song `Hnschen klein' which we hear behind the opening and closing credits featuring b/w footage of Hitler Youth activities and war footage, the titles freeze-framed in the manner that had been Peckinpah's own since The Wild Bunch (1969). To ask why men fight each other in a war is the same as to ask why children fight each other in a playground. War is a natural thing which can be neither explained nor rationalized. It just happens - such is the dark nature of Mankind. The film presents the Eastern Front as a school playground where boys kill each other for no reason other than the nihilism of doing what they think they should do. Petty officer-rivalries and vanities take precedence over humane common sense while cynical negativity (articulated most clearly by the David Warner character Kiesel) pervades everything in a dull fug. Sadistic playground games are the order of the day as many soldiers die so that one can get a meaningless piece of metal to take home and show off to his social peers. It is perhaps precisely this cynical `children's playground' misanthropy that makes the film such a hard nut for audiences to crack, but it is undeniably honest, true and very powerful as a consequence. It is also eons more sophisticated than any other combat war film made up until this point - it even rivals Stanley Kubrick's Paths of Glory (1957) in its intellectual acuity. In 1977 the nihilistic bleakness was very original (how different was it from the gung-ho! heroics of stereotypical war films like Where Eagles Dare (1968)!). It wasn't until 1998 that Terrence Malick went even further in The Thin Red Line with his exploration of the idea of war lying deep at the heart of nature - war as both an inescapable and inevitable consequence of the human condition. For war films which rival Cross of Iron's philosophical insight one has to go to European art cinema and works such as Andrei Tarkovsky's Ivan's Childhood (1962) and Ingmar Bergman's Shame (1968) to find anything remotely comparable.

2. A precise depiction of the class system which made up wartime German society. Steiner and his men are the working classes, all committed to each other, but essentially resentful of all authority coming down on them from on high. Brandt and Stransky represent the old German aristocratic Junker tradition sold short in the Great War of 1914-18 and now ready to take revenge. Brandt shows the liberalism of a Hindenburg or a Ludendorff, but Stransky shows just raw careerism - a ruthless concern for self-advancement. Emanating from this rift is the spectre of the Nazi party which is represented by the character of Private Zoll (Arthur Brauss) who joins the company and whose Party membership leads to a rift between him and the rest of the platoon. It is a fact that the Nazi party was never popular throughout the whole of Germany and members of the Wehrmacht (the regular army) took pains to distinguish themselves from members of the SS and other Party members. The film presents Nazism as a cancer which grew out of the ruptured nature of the power structure as represented by Brandt and Stransky. This makes the German soldiers involved here (even Stransky) victims and thus worthy of sympathy as well as ridicule. This Marxian reading of explaining war in terms of class struggle no doubt clashed with the way mainstream Hollywood (and the critical fraternity) viewed the war in the 1970s and surely provides a clue in explaining the film's non-acceptance by people only used to seeing in war films tales of heroic endeavor with clearly delineated `goodies' and `baddies'. For Peckinpah all men are victims of human nature which creates the evil social class structure within which they are trapped and which causes so much hostility. All men are a murky mixture of both 'good' and 'bad'. The thing that rescues them from complete evil is loyal brotherhood shown to members of the class they belong to - Steiner to his fellow working class platoon members and Stransky to his Junker upper class cronies who await his return with the requisite iron cross as proof of his class entitlement.

3. A very astute understanding of the psychology behind the workings of a group of fighting men. As in The Wild Bunch, the explosions of violence are visceral and truly shocking, but what puts it into perspective are those scenes of macho camaraderie that punctuate the slow motion blood-spurting and mass carnage. Note especially the scene in the barracks after Lieutenant Meyer (Igor Galo) is killed. The reactions of the men through singing, drinking and weeping are extremely moving. Most war veterans will tell you that fighting for their comrades in arms mattered more to them than fighting for any kind of `higher cause'. Steiner's return to the platoon when he could easily have just gone home is deeply impressive in what the return means to both him and his men.

4. Superb cinematography from Peckinpah regular John Coquillon and razor-sharp editing from Michael Ellis, Murray Jordan and Tony Lawson. Much of the excitement of the film comes from the very exact editing of explosions and flying bodies which match conversations taking place to hugely ironic effect. Peckinpah was apparently drunk and stoned a lot of the time during the editing process and we don't really know how much of the excellent work came from him, and how much from his editors. I strongly suspect that Tony Lawson had a big hand here, as the dazzling kinetic style is similar to his editing on Nic Roeg's films such as Bad Timing (1980). Whoever was responsible, the end results compare well with the very best scenes of The Wild Bunch and if Peckinpah was zoned out a lot of the time, it certainly doesn't show.

5. Wonderful performances from a committed cast. Peckinpah is not credited enough for his skill in directing actors. OK, he had a problem with women and Senta Berger is here (as a nurse) simply long enough to display her beautiful breasts which both give admirable performances. Misogyny aside though, the men here (principally Coburn, Schell, Mason and Warner) all do wonders with their material, as do the actors in lesser roles. The actors making up Steiner's platoon are deeply believable, taking the film way beyond the standard `war is hell' statement. We care about these men because they only care about each other. Everything else is meaningless. The empty heroics of dumb fools like Stransky may form the main story of most war films, but this one focuses very tightly on men living and dying for each other rather than dying for tacked-on empty ideals. Steiner becomes a hero precisely because he never aims to be heroic. He couldn't care less for the tin stars hung on his uniform - he only cares about his men. For real `men' like him hero-seeking is laughable, and this is exactly how the film ends.

This is a review of the 2007 Studio Canal DVD, not the more recent 2011 Blu-ray. The quality of the visuals (aspect ratio 16:9) is fine and the mono sound acceptable. At this cheap price this is a film which should be in every war film collection worthy of the name. For Peckinpah lovers it is a mandatory purchase. At a time now when most Hollywood cinema seems to me tame and overly politically correct, Peckinpah offers that peck of nougat which seems all the more radical as time passes. Cross of Iron is a hard-hitting gut-churning wallow in machismo blood `n' guts which will always disturb, but for those prepared for the cynical misanthropy there is nothing else in the cinema quite like it. It's a great shame Peckinpah only ever made the one war film.",1411516800,3,10889,4.857373519913886
967874,5,6305082448,"Cross Of Iron is Peckinpah's only military-action film he directed. The thing is, if you're only going to do one such genre, then here the master director got it right from start to finish. For one thing, the narrative is unlike any war-time film. Any. It also sets the tone of something that reminded me of another epic German film: Das Boat. Hence, the antihero's voice is paramount (played by James Coburn). As a sergeant, he leads and inspires his men; he has the respect of his superior officers; he kills Russians and tries to save his men. But the Germans, at this point of that awful war, are rapidly losing ground in both senses. Men and officers know this, yet to their dubious credit, the Germans truly were tenacious in the Eastern Front engagement and they gave as good as they got. Filmed in 1977, Peckinpah does indeed live up to his reputation as one of the most graphic directors in the business (read, ""the more blood and guts spilled, the better""). However, this is not gratuitous wartime violence. It is the real stuff of war, and in this movie, the narrative is juxtaposed with the sobering and somber reality of brutal slaughter with a psychologically disarming motif that questions the insanity of war. Although it is customary to compare movies and narratives, mentioning this great (or lousy) film as contrast or complimentary. I think this movie stands on its own pinnacle. There is a constant transfusion of horror and humanity, and a dubious morality that shrines through the, otherwise, darkness that war ushers in with its vociferous complaint spoken through weapons and artillery. But the main focus of the movie centers on a very quizzical German reconnaissance unit (led by Coburn) and the Colonel in charge of the front lines regiment, James Mason, who begins to see a major flaw in his favorite sergeant: Coburn does not like officers in the least and only fights because he is ordered to fight. Meanwhile, Maximilan Schell, who is the reconnaissance unit's commanding officer, has his eyes on the prize: winning the prestigious Cross of Iron. And here is the flash point that sets the stage for the captain's wake-up call what it takes to win the decoration, and the envy that he feels for others, like the sergeant, who already have theirs.",1411171200,4,2277,4.811224489795919

968031,5,6305082448,"This movie goes beyond the ordinary WWII movies and it wants to explore another dimension of war: how people is willing to kill his own comrades to get promoted and obtain the highest war decoration: the Iron cross. For obvious reasons the writer and director avoided presenting the US army as having those kind of troubles and they have to select a different combatant. Of course they selected the Germans, the regular villains in all movies. But wait the movie is not about presenting the Germans as the idiotic and stupid monsters that we see in all movies but as real human beings good and bad. It brings a little more balance into WWII history and shows another reality that the Soviet troops were far from being angels. Let's avoid the argument about who killed more people if Stalin or Hitler. In fact in a war it is difficult to differentiate between good and bad guys because all have the same mission killing other humans beings. However the main character James Coburn rises above this awful environment and demonstrates by showing his humanity that is possible to transcend the degradation of war even if at the end he might died.",1385683200,2,1142,4.715

""Prepare for the next one!""

One of the greatest war movies on WWII, not only because of the great cast,
but because it is one of the few movies (I cannot think of another one) that all the
anti-war messages come out from the adventures and difficulties of the German
soldiers, who by the way are the good guys here.
This 1977 movie is a must see.
James Coburn plays  Sgt. Rolf Steiner, a great fighter that goes around the battle
grounds walking like an aristocrat, holding a PPSh-41 Russian made sub machine gun,
and despite all his opposition and his hatred for the German army never lets his
comrades down, even when he enjoyed the warmth of the hospital and the nurse he is
romantically involved in
The quest for the Iron Cross, a badge of bravery in the German army, that the aristocrat
Capt. Stransky (Maximilian Schell) wants, dominates the theme of the movie as a constant
reminder of the inequalities in war, the greed, the revenge, even the murder that occurs
within even the same ranks.
PS Please be really open minded about this movie, as I said once more that the
heroes are the Germans!",1385596800,,1141,4.480769230769231

968182,3,6305082448,"Sam Peckinpah's interpretation of Willi Heinrich's book of the same title.  If one loves almost non-stop action and wooden, two-dimensional acting then this movie is for you.  It's okay for an occasional watch on a rainy, boring weekend, but picking up Mr. Heinrich's book and reading it would be time better spent.
  It had been years since I'd seen this movie and so I bought it.  Now I remember why I let so much time go by before viewing it again.
  One of my bigger complaints would be that Sam Peckinpah could have followed the book a little closer, done a little more to develop the characters, and still gotten in the action that he is known for.  To his credit though, at the time this movie was made, it was considered to be one of the better ones, and it was.  For a military history buff the German armor is basically non-existent and while there is plenty of Soviet armor, it is a little bit ahead of the military action in the movie.  The uniforms and small arms of both sides was, and still is, excellent.
  For those who like older war movies I would recommend it for your DVD collection.  For those who have been brought up on WWII blockbuster movies like ""Saving Private Ryan"" or have seen ""Band of Brothers"" you will probably be greatly disappointed.",1371686400,,1269,4.489082969432315

968300,5,6305082448,"What is not to like about this movie?  With an ace director (Peckinpah), slow-mo arty violence that inspired every Tarantino movie made (true!), an A-list cast, and with a strong post-Vietnam anti-authoritarian theme, Cross of Iron provides a unique mix of biting social commentary, jaw-dropping action, and compelling character development.  This is one of a handful of films to portray WWII from the German point-of-view, avoiding the cliche of the monocle-rocking, preening d-bags portrayed in most other American WWII flicks--with the exception of Captain Stransky, played to Bond-villain perfection by Maximillian Schell.  Rounding out the cast is David Warner (Tron, Titanic) as burnt-out Capt. Kiesel, and James Mason as the empathetic Col. Brandt.  James Coburn plays Sgt. Steiner with a dash of his trademark Rat-Pack cool, yet manages to inject a sense of justice, fairness, irony, intelligence, and warmheartedness into a what could have been another crusty army NCO stereotype.  I would certainly put this up there with Full Metal Jacket and Das Boot as one of the most important anti-war statements in recent decades, especially in how it offers an unflinching glance into the gritty details of day-to-day life of troops unfortunate enough to be fighting for the wrong side of a war they know they are losing--from squalor and lice, to starvation, to the ever-present realization that one could, at any  moment, be blown to meaty chunks across the vast Russian landscape and forgotten. Finally, on a scholarly note, ""Cross of Iron"" was based on the book ""The Willing Flesh"" by Willi Heinrich, who himself participated in the withdrawal from the Taman peninsula; the character of Sgt. Steiner was loosely based on one Johann Schwerdfeger, who is still alive today in his late-90's.",1346025600,,1793,5.273684210526316
968301,2,6305082448,"A documentary that I saw mentioned Peckinpah had a problem with heavy cocaine use, so that may help to explain biizarre films like Pat Garrett And Billy The Kid, and Cross Of Iron. I'd been wanting to see to see this movie for a few years and finally bought it. James Mason is among my favorite actors, I'm also a big fan of James Coburn and David Warner. Unfortunately, they are all wasted in this muddled war flick.
  Corporal Steiner (James Coburn) is a decorated soldier who is loved and respected by his men. Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell) a Prussian aristocrat who wants an Iron Cross and doesn't care how he gets it. After a Russian attack, Stransky claims to have led the counter attack and puts himself in for an Iron Cross. Steiner and others know it was a different officer who led the counter attack.
  After being wounded during the attack, Steiner wakes up at an army hospital. At which, we see a general congratulate the wounded and then walk off with the meat and fruit ment for the soldiers. Then Pecinpah trys to make a bad Pink Floyd video of the men eating and playing with the vegetables. And a hot looking nurse decides to sleep with Steiner, who looks old enough to be her grandfather.
Another scene has Steiner and his men escaping Russian forces after being deserted by their own army, thanks to Captain Stransky. On the way to the new German lines they capture some Russian women, they decide to leave the youngest/newest guy to watch the prisoners while the others do who knows what. One of the girls plays up to the kid and then kills him, the Germans then force all the women into the barn and leave them with a nazi that forced one girl to give him head (big mistake), Steiner then tells the Russian leader ""now we're even"". Even how??? Then the Germans try to get back to their own army, thankfully the Russian women never get out of the barn and call for help.
 They make it back to their own lines to be shot at by their fellow Germans (on Stransky's orders), Steiner and 2 of his men survive. Steiner then finds Stransky and leads him to ""where the Iron Crosses grow"".
Mason and Warner are good in their supporting roles but overall, I thought the story progressed slowly and I often found myself loosing interest.",1333756800,5,2254,4.50122249388753
968302,4,6305082448,"Cross of Iron is a 1977 war film directed by Sam Peckinpah (his only war film which he made while mostly drunk . . . IMDB source), featuring James Coburn, Maximilian Schell, James Mason and David Warner. The film is set on the Eastern Front in World War II during the Soviet's Caucasus operations that forced the Wehrmacht to retreat from the Taman Peninsula on the Black Sea in late 1943 (Wiki source). Coburn's character is a cynical almost legendary front fighter NCO who has to listen to less competent aristocratic commanders, including one played by Schell (the defense attorney in JUDGMENT AT NUREMBERG), who covets the Iron Cross and is jealous of Coburn's character for already having it. War scenes are gritty and violent and random and helpless people bite it often. The ending is close to maniacal and confusing to some but typical of some 70s war films and this one is anti-war and anti-authoritarian to boot. Moviegoers and critics had mixed feelings about this film as it was considered too violent for the times. Today, however, it's just fine because we've watched Tarantino films and worse. Oh, there's also female nudity for those  who can't handle it or who are thinking of watching this old movie with their kids (bad move). The famous Orson Welles considered it the best war tale of the common man since ALL QUIET ON THE WESTERN FRONT. WWII buffs will appreciate authentic tanks being used in the movie but camera types won't like the grainy sections of the film. Veterans tend to be appreciative of the realistic front fighting though they may feel the director gets a bit too ""artsy"" at times.

I tell you a man's true destiny is not just breeding children, all this childbirth and chocolate, but to be free. To rule and to fight. In other words: to lead a man's existence. Women are no more than a nuisance. Sometimes necessary.  ///Captain Kiesel: They're rolling up both flanks, it's chaos. Colonel Brandt: That need no longer concern you. You are to report at once to general headquarters, you're being evacuated. Captain Kiesel: I can't leave the command, sir. Colonel Brandt: While I am still in a condition to issue orders those orders will be obeyed. Captain Kiesel: I'm prepared to disobey that order, sir. Colonel Brandt: You've been around Steiner too long. Come, listen to me for a moment... For many of us Germans the exterminator is long overdue, but I have decided that you are worth saving. Captain Kiesel: But I'm part of all this. There are better people than me. Most of them are being killed out there. Captain Kiesel: There's nothing wrong with you, except that you smoke too much. You're a brave man, braver than you think you are. One of these days there will be a need for brave civilians, had you thought of that?

I would like to see this film restored to full theater quality on Blu-Ray.

Sam Peckinpah's study of the Wehrmacht's war in the east displays a soldier's story from the unpopular point of view of the German Army's Front Line Combat troops.

There is a line Spoken by Colonel Brant (James Mason) to the fact that ""The German Soldier No Longer has any Ideals. He is not fighting for the stinking party, or the German culture. He is fighting for his life, God Save Him.""

If you served as a front line Soldier or Marine, this is not a new view. The message I get from watching this film is that soldiers are soldiers and only political leaders and the arm chair generals who would never willingly fight for your country, will criticize.

In the final analyses, soldiers at the Front only fight for each other. If by their efforts the Politico's vision is advanced, all to the good.

David Chute's text refers to the war as 'grinding to a close'. The action is in fact set on the Taman Peninsula in late 1943. The ghastliness of the Eastern Front was to rumble on for at least another year-and-a-half.  Also he refers to the German 'martinet' played by James Mason. This is quite wrong - Mason's role is that of world-weary, sympathetic and supportive commanding officer. The villain of the piece is Maximilian Schell's Captain Stransky.

I ran across the book by Willi Heinrich as my interest in holocaust films like ""Judgment at Nuremberg"" was being confirmed by reading the first chapter.  When I saw that Sam Peckinpah had directed the movie version, I immediately ordered the widescreen presentation while reading of poor transfer quality by Hen's Tooth in their full screen version.  Thankfully, the reviews of the widescreen version discredited the reviewers of the full screen as that Hen's Tooth presented an uncut and better presentation in their widescreen version.  I am glad as it was rather pricey.  I see the analogies reviewers drew to Peckinpah's ""The Wild Bunch.""  I had been a big fan of Peckinpah but knew little about his later work which did not get the same press.

I was not without huge apprehensions though. WWII hollywood productions from the 70's isn't exactly famed for quality. I had in mind the hedious ""Force 10 from Navarone"".
None the less, the reviews I had read were too intriguing not to buy.

I was hugely impressed with ""Cross of Iron"" on many different levels. The writers and director is taking the story very serious. Arms, uniforms, dialogue all carefully taken into account with respect for the era.
Even in small details such as a watercooled machine gun.

However, there are of course also a few grievances - only in detail. The soundtrack is typical 1970's war movie.
To be ignored - and easily as the story steals the enviroment.
The special effects are typical 1970's - huge balls of fire. Annoying, but still not ruining the movie.
The muzzle sound of the german LMG is way off - and much to slow.
While the russians speak their native tongue, the ""germans"" are unfortunately speaking english. Despite a few moments with german singing. I always find it silly in these WWII movies where the germans are speaking english.

968522,5,6305082448,"When the US Army started to participate in the war in Europe it was already over, to some extent.
The german army had received a gutshot on the eastern front in 1942/1943
from which it was bleeding out and bleeding out fast.
COI shows part of what happened on the eastern front, in all it's brutality and senselessness.

James Coburn briliantly portrays Sgt. Steiner, a wearied and disillusioned veteran, whose only goal it is to save as many of his squad as possible. He is no Nazi, in fact he despises the nazis, despises all the higher ups, who send him and his men out to die.

When Captain Stransky, the new company leader arrives, things change for the worse. Stransky needs the ""Iron Cross"", he'll do anything to obtain it. When Lt. Meyer leads a succesfull counter charge against the atacking soviets, dying in the process, Stransky quickly tells his commander, that he led the fighting action, so that he can obtain the Iron Cross as a reward.

There is but one problem, Steiner knows that Meyer led the charge and that Stransky was in fact hiding cowardly during the russian attack.
Knowing that Steiner would never lie for him, Stransky quickly decides to not inform Steiners squad of the general retreat.

Although Steiner manages to save his troops from the initial soviet attack, they are caught deep behind enemy lines and have to make their way back to their battalion.

Besides Coburn and a for once, great part by Maximilian Schell as Stransky, there are James Mason and David Warner as worn-out commanding officers, who both give great performances.
I also want to recommend the german actors portraying Steiners squad, they do a great job, especially Klaus Lwitsch as Cprl. Krger and Vadim Glovna as Private Kern.

It is a different war movie, because it depicts the german soldiers as actual living people, not the human targets for heroic americans.

I think more americans should watch movies like this, or ""Das Boot"" or ""Stalingrad"", so that they can overcome the dehumanizing portrayal of germans in Hollywood Movies.

He is a pompous jerk, who shows no sign of integrity. He destroys the lives of many good people in his wake. Eventually, he is found to be a coward. This merely serves to modify his methods. He attempts to steal the credit for a dead heroes actions, coersing others to act as his witnesses. The world hasn't changed much. There are still people like this; we call them democrats.

Unfortunately, one of those he chooses to push against is the wrong man.

Corporal Steiner, a real warrior, and a true hero. Not a political man, just a soldier doing his best to survive, and help his comrades do the same. When he refuses to comply, it is arranged for him to be left behind enemy lines. Miraculously, however, he manages to return and exact revenge.

EDIT: In fact the original ""standard"" DVD (I guess, US released version) was 125 minutes plus approx. 2 minutes of credits. This edition is 130 minutes plus the credits - so there is about 5 minutes of extra material.

This newer Region 1 Hen's Tooth disc, available since 2006, is widescreen and 132 minutes -- I think this is the uncut version now -- and has got to be the best transfer yet.  The picture quality was excellent -- definitely sharper, with more detail visible, than another disc I've seen, the one with (removable) Korean subtitles.  The all-region Korean-made disc isn't bad -- it's also in widescreen, runs 132 minutes -- but this new Hen's Tooth one is better, and includes an interesting commentary track by Stephen Prince.

Prince, author of a book on Sam Peckinpah, gives us production history -- including Peckinpah's struggles with the low-budget and European producers -- measures Cross of Iron against other Peckinpah films, compares and contrasts the film with the source novel, and also provides interesting historical information about the German & Russian conflict of WWII.

Cross of Iron is not as good as Peckinpah's masterpieces (The Wild Bunch, Ride the High Country), but it definitely ranks high in his filmography, especially when you consider that his next two films were Convoy and The Osterman Weekend (unfortunately his last).

The whole irony of this goes way beyond what we saw in The Blue Max - another tale of an office who wants a medal; just to impress others.  But in Cross of Iron, this officer finally ""gets it.""  Late - but he gets it.  Throughout this movie, we are privvy to the inside machinations of the Nazi war effort - and mindset.  It's interesting when it runs simultaneously with the children and their sing-song background.  Quite creepy, actually, knowing what we know now about the whole Nazi agenda.  Having James Coburn play the lead in this really is exceptional - shows that he was quite versatile.  It's gritty, depressing and scary - but also a must-watch if you like a different slant on certain aspects of the war.  Don't watch this if you want to see a happy ending - or even a happy start of middle.  It's left up to the viewer, whether or not this ever ends (you'll see).

968624,5,6305082448,"I first saw this many years ago, but was too young to appreciate this film as a whole.  Fortunately, the last 10 years have proven to be a cash-cow for almost anything associated with World War II (movies, documentaries, books and even video games).  There is myriad of ""stuff"" to keep any World War II enthusiast occupied, as well as providing material to create interest and educate younger generations.  This inundation of new movies regarding the war has rekindled my interest in older films ... one of those was ""Cross of Iron"".

""Cross of Iron"" is in a league of its own, mainly because I believe it to be the only Hollywood interpretation with mainstream actors that seems to create the miserable ambiance of the Eastern Front from the German point-of-view.  I find it amazing that in an era where technology and information flow like water, that I have to go back to a 1977 movie starring James Coburn and Maximilian Schell to visually create all the horrors of the Eastern Front that I've discovered in the many books I've read.  Coburn is superb as a wise and grizzled German non-com (Steiner), as was Schell in his role as an officer elitist (Stransky) who requested duty on the Eastern Front for no other reason than to prove himself a hero by being awarded the Iron Cross ... something Steiner has already earned (with relative indifference).

The basic plot of the movie is that Stransky knows he does not have the fortitude to earn such an honor and sees Steiner displaying his courage as if it is a second skin.  Steiner quickly sees through Stransky's charade, which includes the unnecessary sacrifice of his men for Stransky's coveted medal.  Stransky then seeks to rid himself of the man who sees him as weak and shallow ... and puts Steiner in a position to be killed.

What makes this movie great is that Stransky v Steiner is often overshadowed by Steiner actually participating in a greater conflict, the losing battle against the Red Army.  While Stransky's motives are to be a hero without actually being heroic, Steiner is continuously being put into situations where he must be heroic just to save his men.

This is an amazing film that really generates the desperation of the German Wehrmacht on the Eastern Front later in the war ... the misery and impending doom is always present.  The men doing the fighting are depicted as filthy, low-spirited men who are bonded together by their combat experience and Steiner's superb leadership skills.  In my opinion, this film does more to depict Germany's war on the Eastern Front that many modern movies ... more than ""Stalingrad"" and definitely more than Hollywood's trashing of the epic book ""Enemy at the Gates"".  I think ""Cross of Iron"" is a classic film and a worthy purchase.",1265760000,5,2754,4.768421052631579

You have to remember this movie was made in 1977 and doesn't have the special affects we see in todays movies.  The other reviews tend to look at this movie with a 2010 perspective.  It doesn't matter to me that the Russian soldiers in the movie are wearing the wrong helmets.  The movie is a classic made by Sam when most Americans thought of Germans as Colonel Klink, or Sgt. Shultz.  The movie caused me to become more interested in the Eastern Front in WWII.  The actors are fine and it doesn't matter to me that the Russians may not be Russians or that the woman are Slavic. I would venture to guess that most Americans didn't know Russian women served it the front lines.  This is one of the first war movies I saw that actually showed blood, dismemberment, etc.  I am not an expert on this war but have taken the time to watch these movies on Stalingrad.  The 2003 miniseries on Stalingrad(*****),Stalingrad(from the producers of DAS BOOT)(***), and Stalingrad, Dogs, Do You Want to Live Forever?(****). I would highly recommend them all.  I have also read the following books: In Deadly Combat: A German Soldier's Memoir of the Eastern Front, Black Eidelweiss, Blood Red Snow, and Hell's Gate; The Battle of the Cherkassy Pocket.

968626,2,6305082448,"I would like to preface my review by saying, PLEASE, read the OTHER REVIEWS of those who post reviews on Amazon.  Where war movies are concerned, more often than not, you'll find the glowing praise reviews issued by people who mostly buy Michael Jackson CDs and abdominal exercise gadgets.  Consider the person issuing the review before you take it too seriously.

Having said all that, I only write reviews about war flicks, military topic non-fiction books, and once-in-a-while, a big-screen period film epic - that's it.  I'm a serious history buff and primarily focus on military fields of study.

I went to see Cross of Iron back in 1977 at the theater, so that's how old I am.  Having read the book years before, I thought the movie was very abstract even then, but since it was the first ""mainstream"" movie to take a German point of view, I actually saw it twice.  I've had the DVD for years, and have watched it several times.  In short, it's a still a weird movie that doesn't do the original book justice.  This is a weird Peckinpah flick that's very avant garde.  It jumps around a lot, doesn't make sense in some places, and the beginning and ending are EXTREMELY WEAK.  This story deserved a MUCH better movie and perhaps one day it will still get it.

By today's standards, there are tons of problems with the movie that bug me.  Back in '77 it was difficult to get Russian helmets, so the Russians are wearing ITALIAN helmets - it looks dumb.  There are a LOT of errors with the German uniforms throughout the movie, there are a LOT of errors with equipment being used by the Germans, and in short, there are just a lot of historical bloopers in here.  It's an okay movie, but it's certainly not a ""masterpiece.""  Worth getting if you can catch one on sale or something.",1265241600,10,1785,4.53125
968627,4,6305082448,"There's little need to rehash the merits of this particular ""classic"" war film from the 1970's; I prefer to recommend this particular DVD to anyone looking for a reasonable and reasonably priced copy of it. I first saw this film on the awful Hen's Tooth Video pan-and-scan edited version; watching this has made me appreciate it far more. It's still an awful, cliched, appropriately anti-war tirade filled with ""the usual suspects"": the Noble Veteran NCO; his newly-appointed craven Hauptmann; the crusty, war-weary Oberst; his cynical and deferring Adjutant; a prissy closet homosexual staff officer; and a whole platoon of hard-boiled and shell-shocked Landsers you just KNOW will wind up so much cannon fodder. But to the credit of this DVD, at last they speak understandably for a change!

The reason has somewhat less to do with the vastly improved ( but still less-than-perfect ) Dolby stereo sound than the inclusion of the removeable English subtitles. Enough of the original dialog is mouthed, whispered or otherwise muddled or obscured by sound effects to render it largely inaudible. Of course the Korean-written English interpretations of some of the words are unintentionally hilliarious - like misunderstanding references to ""the Fuhrer"" - as well as certain place and other names. But all that aside, one can at least now understand what's being said in this dialog-important script.

As a history enthusiast, my main complaint with the script is the utter failure to convey exactly what ""the Iron Cross"" was and how it was awarded. Recieving it was NOT a one-shot ( literally! ) or clear-cut affair, like the U.S. Purple Heart medal. No one, not even Captain Stransky, would be unduly impressed with the FIRST step necessary, the Iron cross Second Class, which by 1943 was being handed out fairly liberally. ( It's the First Class medals Steiner casually tosses on the table and that the colonel wears on his tunic. ) These awards were CUMULATIVE, resulting finally in the highest levels, the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, worn around the neck on a ribbon. ( In fact you never even see one of these in the film! ) THIS is what Stransky would be aspiring to eventually. Still higher awards added an oak leaf, crossed swords, and diamond studs to the basic medal. Holders were touted in the German propaganda press and regarded as heroes by an admiring public.

As I indicated, there's little point now in criticizing this by-now 40 year-old film for things like historical and other inaccuracies and exaggerations, such as the stock footage of bombing done by American Corsair aircraft. It remains an interesting look at a little-known part of a lesser-known theatre of World War II, the German retreat through the Kerch Penninsula towards the Crimea in southern Russia in the summer of 1943 following their disaster at Stalingrad. As a collector of that period's militaria I particularly enjoyed all the details of uniforms and weaponry they got RIGHT or at least acceptable. Seeing the Russian tanks in action ( even if they were the wrong particular model ), hearing the peculliar ""ripping"" of the German machine guns, and practically ""living"" the abject misery of the common soldiery ( including the lice! ) made it all something well outside the ordinary, particularly considering the era in which it was made.",1265155200,2,3334,5.025316455696203

968737,2,6305082448,"What to say about this movie except that it's Sam Peckinpah, exploding blood bags, and death-in-slow-motion, a highly stylized movie fashion peculiar to the time period of the late 1960's and 1970's.

I bought this version of the DVD because the Netflix rental appeared to be the ""bad transfer"" version and this was the cheapest Korean version available online, and the Korean version is supposedly a better DVD transfer.  There is another Korean DVD version listed on Amazon that is 138 min. long, but unless that version has more of the scene of the naked Slavic woman in the hot tub, it probably isn't worth the extra money.

The movie is best described as Sam Peckinpah surreal.  It has definitely not held up well over time.

James Coburn, playing the role of Steiner, a hard bitten rebellious corporal in the German Wehrmacht, spends much of the movie speaking in monosyllables and switching back and forth from a truly awful German accent and his American accent.  James Mason as a German colonel goes in the other direction with his best Royal Shakespearean Theater Received Pronunciation English, while David Warner and several other characters choose the commoner varieties of British accents.  All of which made Maximilian Schell, a native German-speaking actor (born in Austria and a Swiss citizen), sound positively weird in his German accent.

Hollywood had first started using the technology of exploding blood bags (squibs) in the 1957 movie ""Run of the Arrow"", and in 1967, Arthur Penn first came up with the idea of doing slow motion death scenes combined with exploding blood bags in ""Bonnie and Clyde"".  Peckinpah would use this style to great effect in ""Wild Bunch"" and his movies would come to be strongly associated with this style of showing movie gun violence, even though he did not invent the idea.

Unfortunately, because this movie is about a war after all, with the large numbers of soldiers constantly getting killed and everyone dying in slow motion, the whole death-in-slow-motion concept rapidly becomes a parody of itself, just from the constant repetition.  Not again, you say, after the umpteenth shot of yet another soldier contorting in slow motion as blood explodes all over him.

Yes, that technique is so 1970s.  It does make one think and realize, though, that in about thirty years, the ""bullet time"" technique of the Matrix movies and all of its copycats will also probably look terribly silly.

Peckinpah filmed this movie in Yugoslavia, which was the best thing he did from the aspect of authenticity.  Yugoslavia gave him access to the large numbers of T-34/85 tanks that were still in the country,  and these tanks definitely put on a command performance, better than any of the human actors.  And so my two stars are for all the great shots of real live T-34/85 tanks in action.

Yugoslavia also gave Peckinpah access to all these beautiful high-cheek boned Yugoslavian women, who played the part of the women Russian soldiers in what has to be the most incongruous scene of all for this movie.  OK, it is sort of fun to see the semi-naked Slavic woman in the hot tub, but seriously, when you think about the probability of finding hot water, a large wooden tub, and a beautiful model-quality female all in one place in the middle of a forest in an active war zone.... well, it just seems so anachronistic and - again that word - SILLY, just a totally gratuitous scene for all the low forebrow Neanderthals watching this movie.  Something one might see if modern-day Southern California became a war zone, but surely not in the Eastern Front during WWII.

The second most incongruous scene is when two of Steiner's men get seriously injured by these women, and Steiner merely yells ""Stupid man!"" at one of them and walks away.  After shepherding all the women into the barn, I half expected Steiner to burn the barn down with the women inside, or just have them all machine-gunned to death, but, no...

Finally the ending - with Coburn/Steiner laughing hysterically, on and on, while the children sing their song in the background... yeah, yeah, the absurdity of war, juxtaposing the innocent voices of children against the horror of war....  again, so 1970s....  And oh, just what the heck were those photos at the end all about, from the My Lai massacre, from the Japanese invasion of China....?????

968738,5,6305082448,"CROSS OF IRON is one of the four or five best WW II movies ever made.  I have studied WW II for over 50 years and, having lived in Germany on two occasions, once as an army officer,  became friends with many of the German veterans who shared some of their stories with me.  I first saw Cross of Iron in Heidelberg, Germany, sitting next to a friend of mine who served in Russia in the Second Panzer Division as an enlisted infantryman.  When I asked him how like the real war in Russia was compared to the movie, he said it was much like it:  Long periods of boredom and moments of utter terror.  The cast for the movie was inspired.  James Coburn, Maximillian Schell and James Mason - and a great supporting cast including a cameo with Senta Berger.  It couldn't get any better.  It couldn't get any more authentic.

The movie was technically absolutely flawless and its message delivery was perfect without the PC bilge that modern Hollywood layers on its contemporary work.  (How I miss Peckinpah.)

968740,5,6305082448,"I first watched ""Cross of Iron"" over 20 years ago, and was blown away by the gritty depiction of war-weary German soldiers fighting a losing battle against the Soviets, fighting not so much for country but for each other.  At that time, it was perhaps the only film in English about the German-Soviet portion of World War II.

I recently decided to purchase the movie, and after doing some research, bought this version, as its 20 minutes longer than the ""Widescreen Special Edition"" and restores much of the movie cut out earlier, presumably because of the realistic depiction of wartime violence.  Be sure to get this version ... don't let the Korean lettering on the packaging scare you off.  The DVD played fine on my player, and this is the best (longest) version available.

Based on the novel of the same name by Willi Heinrich (a novel I very highly recommend), the movie captures the spirit of the novel and gives a good feel for the senselessness of war.  As the Germans continued to be pushed back and ground into dust, it was the ever-diminishing number of ""old-hands"" that held the German front together, the ones who through virtue of their earlier victories over the Russians, weren't afraid now that the Russians had the upper hand.

My only nit ... while James Coburn and Maximilian Schell both give outstanding performances (I think Coburn's performance is one of the best ... if not THE best ... of his long career), they both are a little long in the tooth for their characters.  Coburn, 49 at the time, plays Corporal (soon to be Sergeant) Steiner, while Schell, 47, plays a Captain, both relatively junior ranks.  In the book, Steiner is portrayed as being in his early-mid 20's.  But this doesn't detract from the movie, one of director Sam Peckinpah's best.",1255046400,9,1781,4.753246753246753

James Coburn is brilliant as Corporal (then Sargent) Rolf Steiner, who's convinced the war is lost for Germany, however he must keep his platoon alive or save as many as he can from his combat worn out men. The Russians are closing in and even though Steiner's commando and infiltration tactics are clever and effective, they're not enough to contain thousands of russian enemies coming at them. Upon capturing a young russian prisoner after a destruction of an enemy artillery nest, Steiner says to his young prisoner describing both nazism and communism: ""Neither extreme works nor will ever!"" War has made Steiner cynical and he absolutely hates his uniform as well as Hitler, his ideology and that of his Russian enemies.
This film is a realistic view of how grinding, bloody and cruel Russian front was. Also James Mason and Maximilian Schell portray convincing support roles.
I highly recommend this rare film about a rare and not often explored World War II subject or war theatre.",1250985600,3,1264,4.883720930232558
968744,5,6305082448,"This film is really Sam Peckinpah's last truly great work. I like his movies because films with guts aren't made a lot in Hollywood these days. His best films could be brutally honest and gut wrenching. I like this film because I like Peckinpah as a director and have studied for many years the Russian front and like watching World War II films. And the first time I watched 'Cross of Iron' I was kinda blown away. Are there flaws? Yes. But the film really captures a bit of the essence that was the Eastern front. The opening credits with footage and a children song playing in the background is great. The footage of Hitler, the Eastern Front, the cheering crowds is pretty overwhelming. One of my favorite opening credit sequences. The remarkable thing was that 'Cross of Iron' was accomplished with a budget of around 6 million dollars. In comparison from the same year, 'A Bridge Too Far', had a budget of 26 million dollars. 'Cross of Iron' truly has very good battle scenes including a very gripping sequence of a attack by Soviet T-34 tanks that is one of the highlights of the picture. Also, I love the detail of the scene with a water cooled machine gun. Really excellent military detail.

The film also has a scene that shows how death was so casual on the Eastern front where millions died. A dead German soldier has been ground into the road by trucks and other vehicles running over him and no one cares. This is a very strong but quick scene in the movie

James Coburn is very strong as Steiner and pretty much anchors the picture. Schell, Mason, and Warner are very good also. The uniforms and the equipment are pretty good representations and as mentioned before the scene where Steiner and his men try to hold off the T-34s seems to be a precursor to similar scenes in 'Saving Private Ryan.'

The Special Edition DVD while expensive is at least in the near proper aspect ratio and enhanced for widescreen TVs. It is a nice improvement over the previous DVD. The picture is good but the sound could be better. There is a informative commentary track by Stephen Prince who also did the commentary track for Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs'. The commentary track is quite good and manages to cover the real World War II history behind the film, differences with the novel, and the actual making of the film quite well. It is really worth a listen. The only other extras are viewable lobby cards and a hyperbolic trailer.

Fans should pick up the novel too by Willi Heinrich. It is interesting to compare the two and see how different they are.

One of my favorites films from one of my favorite directors! Highly recommended!

969000,4,6305082448,"Overview
Cross of Iron is director Sam Peckinpah's look at the German Army on the Eastern Front in 1943.  In this movie, Feldwebel Steiner (played by James Coburn) leads a Reconnaissance platoon (more like a squad) that has received a new company commander, Hauptmann Stransky who has arrived from a posting in France with the focus of winning the Iron Cross.  To gain the Iron Cross Hauptmann Stransky is prepared to do whatever is necessary.

The Good
The characters are great.  James Coburn is outstanding as the seasoned veteran leading his section and he does a great job in this role.  Maximilian Schell is also good playing Hauptmann Stransky; he's everything we want to hate in an officer that focuses on himself and not his men.  James Mason plays the regimental commander that is sympathetic to Steiner and does a good job in this role.

The action is fast and very nice.  While bloody at times, it fits with how war movies should be and captures what I've read about the actions on the Eastern Front from history books.

The story takes place on the Crimean Peninsula and is woven around the actual battles that took place there in that timeframe.  While the regiment is not directly mentioned, the dress and bearing is that of one of the many infantry regiments that would have fought there.

Showing Russian women in service.  For the time period this movie was made in that was something that many people in the West weren't aware of.  Since that time it's become more common knowledge but this would have been one of the earlier references to it.

I also loved the uniforms.  Mr. Peckinpah didn't make the mistake of using later war camouflage uniforms or SS uniforms.  Matter of fact, I love the fact that this is around a regular infantry unit rather than a SS or elite unit.

The Bad
Ignoring the minor things (use of F4U's for Russian aircraft and T-34/85's vs T-34/76's), I have an issue with James Coburn's age when this was filmed.  Coburn looks in his late 40's or early 50's.  You don't expect a Feldwebel leading a recon platoon to be that old (it can happen though).

I also had a problem with the fact that Hauptmann Stransky bounces in to get the Iron Cross and then is bouncing back to France.  I'm sorry, at that point in the war that would be highly unlikely, even for a member of the former aristocracy.  Something like that would have been more likely if Hauptmann Stransky had been assigned to Italy, but then we wouldn't have the story set in the Crimean.

The conflict between Feldwebel Steiner and Hauptmann Stransky was to close to a Vietnam thing.  I won't say that German officers wouldn't lie to get something they wanted, I will say though that Steiner would have been very out of character for a Feldwebel and probably sentenced to a Penal Battalion.

The alcohol flows a little freely for a unit on the Eastern Front.  If they were in France or Italy I could say yes, but there's a lot of it and it's not vodka they show (actually beer and wine).

The Rating
A Solid 4.5 stars!  The acting is solid, the story moves and has a purpose.  I love the interplay between Steiner and Stransky.  You see two men who are very different, one rich, one who's working class.  I also love the camaraderie between Steiner and his men.  This is something that occurs when people share tragic events and continue to live.  There is a little sexual content and the battle scenes are a little graphic (for when the film was made.  Since Amazon requires whole numbers, I'll have to give the nod to 4 stars because to much of the film reminded me of the strife between US officers and enlisted people in the early '70's rather than what we read about the German Army in 1943.  A very good movie thought that I'll highly recommend.",1208390400,4,3754,4.552238805970149
969001,2,6305082448,"I saw this movie originally back in the 1970s.  I received the movie the other day.  Cross of Iron was a pretty good movie back in 1977 but now - after spending a good bit of time studying the German Army - this movie has issues and just isn't that good.  ""A Bridge too Far"" is a far better movie and is from the same production time period.

First, Hen's tooth video does a poor job of transferring this video to DVD.  Indeed, it's terrible.  Names are cut off, parts are deleted, and the whole movie has a grainy quality to it.  I would go as far as to tell people that it ruins the movie.  Indeed, there is one important part where Captain Stansky is flailing around in a trench during the attack on Steiner's platoon and that is cut out.  That's a major part where it shows both the motivation of the characters.

Now to the major problems with the movie.

The plot is pretty good.  A new German Army Captain wants the highest award the military has: the Iron Cross.  So, he joins a line unit, claims credit heroics by a slain officer, Sergeant Steiner refutes his story and discredits the Captain.  As revenge the officer does not tell Steiner of the withdrawl and his unit is trapped behind enemy lines.

The movie does correctly show the Germans picking up and using Soviet weapons.  One soldier discards his K-98 and gets a sniper version of the Soviet M-91/30.  That is correct and the Germans had so much captured Soviet ammo that supply is never a problem.

Now to the many technical problems with this movie.  First, the Germans were clean shaven in WWII.  Oh, if there was hard fighting or lots of action they would grow stubble.  However, more than a few of these men have '70s' type facial hair.  Next, the actors are too old.  Jame Coburn is over 50 in this movie and it shows.  James Mason looks like a Grandfather, not a German Colonel.  Maximilian Schell plays the Prussian Captain.  Schell, an excellent actor, should have been given Mason's role.  Coburn was much too old for the part and some other younger actor for the time should have been used.  The same goes for Stansky's part.  When somebody is brutally killed the movie goes into slow motion gore.  Also, there is a major air attack where the director uses F-4U Cosair fighters in the movie.  I can ignore the T-34/85 being used in the movie but in 1943 the Cosairs were a Pacific aircraft and were never given to the Soviets.

This is a C grade movie.  The poor video transfer nearly wrecks the movie.  The problems with the old actors detract from an otherwise good story.  If any movie should be remade it's this movie.  With younger actors and better special effects it would be a fantastic movie for 2010.",1203033600,8,2690,4.4517453798767965
969002,4,6305082448,"First of all, it does not do the book justice... but then again, what movie ever does?

With that being said, this is a good war movie in its own right. It is intensely graphic and the imagery it is certainly intended to put lie to the idea of war as a noble crusade or a romantic adventure.

Cross of Iron revolves around the obsession a German captain has with being awarded the Iron Cross for valor, more as a trophy or vindication for his life as a soldier. One of his soldiers, Steiner, has already earned an Iron Cross, and other decorations, but he too has come to be defined by the war.

An excellent film, well worth trying out.",1195776000,,637,4.24793388429752
969003,5,6305082448,"I'm not really going to go into great detail in this review except to say if you are a fan of this movie already and have been looking for the UNCUT version THIS is the longest available cut on DVD or VHS. It's longer than either R1 or R2 copies that have been released. The picture quality is great and the subtitles ARE removable.
 But, having seen this brilliant film on it's original cinema release in the U.K. in 1977, I still think that there is material cut from the theatrical cut. Nothing major, just some more 'cutaways' to the real violence of war that struck me as so viceral and vivid when I was young. Or maybe my memory has been playing tricks on me. Or the effect of so much 'Rambo' rubbish and 'Gung Ho' action flicks has decreased the movie's impact on me.
 But I got the anti~war message then and it's still a strong statement today. Not really a review, more a personal observation.

Peckingpah's trademark slow motion is used to good effect in the battle scenes. Yes this being Peckinpah the battle scenes are very well done.
The cast give marvellous performances:
Maximilian Schell as Captain Stranszky perhaps steals the acting honours as a cowardly Prussian seeking the Iron Cross.
Coburn pushes him close as the officer hating Steiner.
In a supporting role an ageing James Mason gives a seemingly effortless demonstration of how doing very little can amount to a superb performance.
There are occasional lighter moments, but mostly this film is relentlessly grim. Even if you don't see their deaths, you know that all the characters will die.
Strangly though this is a film I want to watch again (and look forward to watching). This is because the main characters are so well drawn (and acted) and as I said above you don't see them all die.
In a typically perverse move Peckinpah ends the film on a moment of black comedy relating to Stranszky's incompetence; Steiner can't stop laughing. A great film.",1188172800,4,1171,4.86
969006,3,6305082448,"Sam Peckinpah's attempt to make a graphic, violent antiwar film has not aged well.  This is a story of a German recon platoon in the south of Russia in 1943 after the debacle at Stalingrad.  The platoon is lead by Cpl (later Sgt) Steiner, played by James Coburn (probably one of the best roles in his illustrious career).  After an opening action scene in which Steiner and his men eliminated a Soviet mortar battery, Steiner meets his new company commander, Capt Stransky (played by Maximillian Schell).  Stransky is a Prussian aristocrat who requested transfer to the Russian front so that he can earn the Iron Cross, but doesn't really want to risk his neck to earn it.  Steiner is the grizzled veteran who has received every award available, is sick of the war and the leadership, but continues to fight nonetheless.  In the mid-70s this film may have been considered cutting edge, but I think that to modern audiences, the violence and action seems will seem highly stylized.  As a war film, it carries little of the emotional impact of more recent films.  The slow motion camera shots really give this film a dated feel.  Some of the other reviewers state that this film is made from the `German perspective'.  This is not really true in my opinion, I think a better characterization would be to state that it is `not unsympathetic' to the Germans.  Steiner and his men are portrayed as soldiers simply doing their duty in a war they don't believe in.  This latter point is one of the strengths of the film, the German soldiers are not portrayed as mindless Nazis, but with more sympathy and complexity.  A second strength of this film is that it doesn't descend into simplistic rantings about Nazi racial policy in Russia, Nazi war crimes, etc.  This would have banished the film to cliched oblivion in my view.  There are some great shots of WWII era hardware (like T-34/85), even if everything is not entirely historically accurate.  This is a decent (anti)war film, but will, I believe, seem tame and not particularly meaningful to modern viewers.",1175644800,5,2057,4.768361581920904
969007,3,6305082448,"This is one of the strangest war movies I've ever seen. Peckinpaugh was famous for depicting violence in slow motion, with much blood and realism, and he does that here, in spades. Strangely, as has been commented elsewhere, this is the only war movie he made. It's an odd choice: Willi Heinrich's depressing World War II novel about German soldiers on the Eastern Front wasn't exactly a bestseller in the States. There's also the issue of whether American audiences would even know what that part of the war was about, or how hopeless the situation the characters are in is...the setting of the movie is the Taman peninsula, just to the east of the Crimean peninsula, and Crimea was about to fall, also. The soldiers in the movie are probably all doomed, trapped regardless of what they do.

The supporting characters in the movie are all portrayed by Germans, but the main actors are an international cast. Coburn of course was American, Mason and Warner English, and Schell is the lone German among the principal players. The equipment and uniforms look entirely appropriate and authentic. There's a particularly chilling scene where the German soldiers have to fight off a Soviet attack and the Soviets are led by several tanks, which are clearly T-34s.

No one's ever been able to explain the ending to me coherently. I'm not going to give it away here, but trust me, it's very very strange, and seems anti-climactic. There's an interesting side-note to this: a friend of mine, many years ago, went to the premiere or to a sneak preview in Hollywood, and he swears that the ending was different. Perhaps they had debates about how anti-war they wanted the movie to be, and couldn't agree, or even tested it with different endings before deciding on this one.

Nonetheless, I am glad I own the movie. I can't say I enjoyed watching it exactly (it's very bloody) but it was interesting to watch. Peckinpaugh has this strange habit of cutting between several different sequences, jumping from one point of view to another and then back after a second or two, and it's very interesting, if a bit unsettling until you get used to it. I do agree with the one reviewer though: the soundtrack is more than a little annoying: especially the opening title sequence (which is used for the ending too) has a musical number that's particularly annoying. All in all a good movie though.",1174262400,5,2377,4.778588807785888
969008,4,6305082448,"""Cross of Iron"" has always been one of my favorite movies. It was the first Peckinpah movie I ever saw, I was fifteen, and it forever convinced me of the futility of war. So a couple of years ago I bought the Hentooths's fullscreen version of this movie and I was absolutely apalled by the poor quality of the image and soundtrack: the DVD is so bad that you might not even finish watching the movie. Still, this being one of my favorite movies, I decided to run the risk of buying this widescreen special edition when it recently came out, since it promised to be better, and it was. Not great, I should say, but better. So if you're convinced, as I am, that this is the best war (or anti-war) movie ever made, I recommend you buy this DVD despite its technical limitations. If you have never seen this movie, you should see it a couple of times before making your mind of what you think of it. This is because, like all of Peckinpah's movies, it is full of subtleties that you will not get on just one run (I've seen this movie seven times and still find new new things in it), including a brilliant subplot on male camaraderie and (overt and repressed) homosexuality. But this is also the one Pekinpah movie where ultra-violence is handled mastefully: the first time you watch this movie, you will be in shock before long and unable to follow the nuances of the plot. So sleep it off for a couple of days and watch the movie again. In my opinion, in this movie you will also find the best performances ever by both James Coburn and Maximilian Schell.",1174089600,7,1553,4.377162629757786

Viewing this movie again reminded me just how tragic, futile, senseless and dehumanizing war can be.  James Coburn plays a powerful and very convincing lead in this movie as a German noncommissioned officer in the already lost cause for Germany on the Eastern Front during World War II.  James Mason plays an excellent role as the seasoned and philosophical senior officer who is also caught up in the futility of Germany's strategic situation, while Maximilian Schell plays the role of an arrogant Prussian aristocrat whose nefarious ambition for the undeserving glory of an Iron Cross is naked and disgusting to the point of selfishly disregarding the lives of his own men in his command.  The visual effects of the battle scenes are almost surreal at times, with soldiers being blow apart in slow motion, as Sam Peckinpah works his magic.

You have some strange choices in where the story goes and how it gets there - it lurches from the examination of homosexuality in the military, the horrors of war and the mental health of the survivors of war, into guys on patrol / trying to get home story.  The action scenes, as with almost any Peckinpah movie, are exciting and horrifying.  A ""Ballet of Violence"" as John Woo would say.  The acting and dialogue is all over the place- but Coburn and Schell love to chew the scenary and do it soooo well.

969105,5,6305082448,"This movie is loosely based on the novel by Willie Heinrich, which is titled ""The Willing Flesh"". This is also the only war film that Sam Peckinpah directs. Though the movie is not true to the book, it is basically an accurate portrayal of the violence of war on the Eastern Front. The movie shows the great German Wehrmacht reeling under pressure from the bigger Russian Army as it flees the Crimea after the fall of Stalingrad. Its focus is on war and not the politics that failed and caused them. It does not even show you that the German's were the aggressors.

The Russian T-34/85 tanks, though not actually available for this battle, and the infantry weapons we see are real. And the use by the Germans of the Russian guns and the waves upon waves of Russian soldiers sent into battle are accurate depictions. The historical fighting that took place was actually an air war with the ground forces almost fighting to a standstill. But the budget of this film would not allow the true strategic focus to be shown.

Steiner, played by James Coburn, is a battle hardened survivor who is challenged by an aristocratic Prussian officer, Captain Stransky, who got himself transferred to the front from France in order to win the Iron Cross. Captain Stransky is shown as almost an outright coward, and is willing to do anything for the coveted Iron Cross. Peckinpah uses this movie to shows that war is an eternal nature of war.

The movie looks as if shot in on a large scale, even though the budget did not allow it. And we see the directors' famous violent montages and great editing. With inserted slow motions scenes cut in and multiple cameras per scene. This is a true seventies movie classic.",1167177600,4,1698,4.634551495016611
969106,5,6305082448,"James Coburn and Maximilian Schell star as two German soldiers from diversely contrasting backgrounds in Sam Peckinpah's brutally graphic WWII drama ""Cross of Iron"".  Filmed in Yugoslavia, the movie depicts the 1943 Nazi retreat from the Soviet Taman peninsula during Hitler's disastrous strategic blunder, the invasion of Russia.

Coburn playing corporal and later sergeant Steiner is a disillusioned war weary veteran, highly respected by his reconnaissance platoon.  Schell is a newly transfered captain who is both inexperienced and cowardly.  He comes from a wealthy, aristocratic Prussian family for whom he must attain his rite of passage, the iron cross for valor.  During a skirmish in which Coburn was wounded and Schell's brave underling lieutenant Meyer was killed, Schell unjustly tries to take credit for the manuever which would bestow the prized iron cross on him.  Schell needs corroboration from Coburn to attain the honor.  When he refuses, he is forced to explain to their superior officer colonel Brandt played by James Mason.

The fierce fighting goes on and Coburn and his platoon get stuck behind enemy lines and fail to be notified of a general retreat by the actions of Schell.  Hoping to get them killed, Schell is shocked when he learns that Coburn and his platoon are attempting to work their way back across enemy lines.  He orders junior officer lieutenant Triebig played by Roger Fritz to shoot Coburn and his men to preserve the secret of his devious machinations to win the undeserved medal.

Peckinpah's penchant for gory portrayals of violence is never more apparent than in ""Cross of Iron"".  He also accurately displays the divergent mindset of the German people to the policies of Nazism in his two main characters.  Also appearing in a rare English speaking role is the sensuous flame haired German actress Senta Berger, who plays a nurse and Coburn love interest as he recuperates from his wounds.",1164153600,5,1937,5.130573248407643

 Worth it, October 19, 2006

This review is from: Cross of Iron (Widescreen Special Edition) (DVD)
Everything the reviewers say about this movie is true.
This is not Peckinpahs best film, this is not his most violent film, this is not a great war move and the acting is not going to win awards.
Movies are never as good as the book and this one proves that statement.
Now why would you want to buy this?

Cross of Iron is Peckinpahs only war movie and gives us a window into his thinking that you will not get anywhere else.

It is a good action move and one that will not have you checking the clock.

James Coburn is an excellent actor and this is one of his few starting roles.
It is also some of his best work.

It is an above average move from a great director and this is not something that will stay in print.
As a Peckinpah fan, I bought this at once and enjoy watching it more than once.",1161216000,,945,4.136612021857924
969109,5,6305082448,"Produced on a modest budget in Yugoslavia in 1976, Cross of Iron starring James Coburn is a tough, hardcore movie that holds up well. Even by today's standards, the sequence with a group of Russian female soldiers is truly horrific. Fine, vintage Peckinpah.",1161129600,5,257,5.0
969110,5,6305082448,"In a key scene in ""Cross of Iron,"" Senior Sgt. Steiner charges alone into No-Man's Land during a Soviet frontal assault.

His platoon, pulling out of position to retreat, watches in horror.  Then they stop their preparations to withdraw and give fire support to defend Steiner.  Then, a few charge into No-Man's Land to save him.  Others on their flanks renew firing.  Then more charge forward.  In so doing, they blunt, and stop, the Soviet attack.  The company commander is later credited with ""organzing a counterattack.""  But he was away, in his bunker, at the time, on the telephone, calling for help (airstrikes!).  He is to receive the Iron Cross First Class for his ""combat action.""

But it was Steiner, not Captain Stransky, who saved the position.  Did Steiner charge into apparent death, alone, knowing that his only chance to save the regimental position from a Soviet overun was to make a risky charge into the Soviet onslaught?

Or did he just go nuts-- did he just want to die a hero's death and walking into a Soviet infantry assault was the obvious way to do it?

What is leadership?  Charging alone, and hoping your people will follow?  In this case, apparently yes.  But did he expect his men to follow him?

Watch this film and attempt to analyze Steiner's small unit combat leadership.  Did he perform that action deliberately?  Or not?

I've seen it six times, and each time have puzzled over that scene.  Reading the Willi Heinrich book does not help with this scene, although it is an awesome read.

Highly recommended for those who ask the question, ""what is leadership?""

Also you will hear one of the great all-time film lines:  ""Let me show you where the Iron Crosses grow ...""",1158883200,7,1705,4.72108843537415

Heinrich's novel is a very well written account of warfare on the eastern front from the perspective of a German non-com.  Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" is unfortunately, is a low budget western with homo-erotic undertones.  The ""German"" characters look like participants at a bad reenactment.  Hell's Angels look more like real German Soldiers than the characters in this film.

The dialogue in the film makes me wonder whether Peckinpah was drunk while he was directing this film as the acting and dialogue is overly melodramatic and ludicous.

The creditable acting of Coburn, Schell and Mason are not enough to salvage this dreadful film.",1156464000,9,708,5.060344827586207

969221,5,6305082448,"Saw this one on televison. Having read the novel, I found a few things not in line but none the less I find this a superb piece of work. A far cry from the politically correct junk produced by hollywood today. Wish Hollywood would produce films like this again.

James Coburn is supurb in performance playing a German NCO on the Russian front who despite war's brutality and the regime he serves manages to preserve his own humanity both with the men under his command and even with his enemy. He exists in a world more in line with Bill Mauldin's Joe and Willy than the smart set image of Hitler's propoganda machine.

James Mason plays an officer one can admire.

Maxamillian Schell plays one readily despicable. Cowardly, arrogant, incompotent anda  real backstabber who uses his connections to get what he wants rather than merit. An 'Iron Cross Jackal' bent on obtaining rewards earned by others. (His aid is homosexual, both here in the movie and in the novel  which is more graphic about him which really aught to correct things put out by the left on this subject).

969222,3,6305082448,"First, this is not Sam Peckinpah's best effort.  Recent biographies have traced the difficulties he had with this production, mostly money issues, but also script issues (and the script is perhaps the weakest part of this movie).  By this point in his career, Peckinpah had already entered into the pitiful slide of addiction, and to some degree it shows in the pacing of this film: too long, a little slack, with his patented slow motion death scenes now becoming almost self-parody.  All this said, this is a film still worth seeing and owning (I certainly plan to own this edition, wide-screen, commentary, and all). It's worth owning because, one, it is a Sam Peckinpah film, and Sam Peckinpah is unarguably one of the great filmmakers of the  6os and 70s.  Hell, Convoy is even worth watching and owning, if just for one great shot of the trucks on the highway at night, a simply gorgeous image.  And Cross of Iron, for all its problems with length and coherence, is still a powerful war film and still at many times a gorgeous film.  Like all Peckinpah movies, this reeks of authenticity: the soldiers in their dishelved uniforms and bad teeth, the Germans (as they really did do) trading their Schmiesser machine pistols for the much better Russian submachine guns.  The battle scenes are impressively and disturbingly chaotic. The climax, with Steiner's men crossing no-man's land into their own lines, is heartbreaking, an image that has stuck with me for nearly 30 years since I saw the film when it first came out.  I don't know if in today's conservative climate one could make a movie about German soldiers in WWII; and Peckinpah takes perhaps an easy way out by making a clear distinction between the common Wermacht soldier and the evil SS troops (in the last decade or so there has been much scholarship about the atrocities committed by the regular, non SS,  German Army in the Soviet Union, which decisively undercuts Peckinpah's distinction). This said, the bigger point that Peckinpah makes in this film still is valid: simply, war is hell, and at a certain point, winning and losing become meaningless.  James Coburn, an always underrated actor, is excellent here as the weary and cynical squad leader Steiner, with able support by Maximillian Schell, James Mason, and David Warner.  The rest of the cast is an effective and talented group of European actors.  Despite what Orson Welles may have said, this is not the greatest anti-war movie ever made.  It's not even near Peckinpah's best.  But it's honest filmmaking by a master craftsman who still could drive a narrative with skill.  This is an essential part of any Peckinpah fans film library, and worth seeing for any serious film goer.",1147651200,13,2714,4.8673913043478265

Director Sam Peckinpah was probably ahead of his time and put together a very accurate and violent movie showing even the great German Wehrmacht (army) reeling under pressure from the bigger Russian Army.

The Russian T-34 tanks are real, the favored use by Germans of the Russian guns and the waves upon waves of Russian soldiers sent into battle are accurate depictions. Steiner, played by James Coburn, is a battle hardened survivor who is challenged by an aristocratic Prussian officer, Captain Stransky, trying to get an Iron Cross - at any cost! Needless to say the movie follows on those tracks and shows the senseless carnage and slaughter on the Russian Front and WWII. The movie is not about German Nazis nor the SS and the Wehrmacht shoud not be compared nor confused with the former. The focus is mainly on the remnants of the Wehrmacht and 6th Army around the time of Field Marshal Friedrich Paulus's surrender to the Russians (Hitler would not allow the 6th Army to withdraw nor surrender). An interesting scene is when a Nazi soldier is placed into Steiner's platoon and the show of hatred between Werhmacht soldiers and Nazis shows - as in all of Willie Heindrich's books. Guy Sajer's ""The Forgotten Soldier"" would also be a good book to get accurate perpectives of the Russian Front in WW2.",1142899200,23,1405,4.829875518672199

969227,4,6305082448,"1976 saw Sam Peckinpah release the only war film he ever made in the form of Cross of Iron. Peckinpah hadn't made any relevant films as the 1970's rolled around as his bouts with alcoholism and reputation as an impossible director to work with cut into the amount and type of projects he was allowed to make. But with Cross of Iron, we get to see once again what made Sam Peckinpah such a maverick director and the first true auteur of cinematic violence. Another thing that was surprising was the fact that despite all the westerns and other violent-laden films in his library of work, Peckinpah never made a war film. One would've thought that Peckinpah's penchant for creating innovative, almost balletic mayhem on the screen would've been a perfect marriage with a war film script. Cross of Iron might be his first and only war film, but Peckinpah brings to it his very own style that would help influence future directors such as John Woo, Quentin Tarantino, and Luc Besson.

A rarity amongst WW2-based films, Cross of Iron is told through the eyes of the Nazis as they try to survive their retreat from the Eastern Front of 1943. Rarely do Germans play the protagonists in WW2 films and Cross of Iron helps show that the German soldiers, beat-up and shellshocked, were not so dissimilar from the typical American and British soldier. All they want is to live another day as they try desperately to retreat from Russia. This theme is seen most evidently in the character of Sergeant Steiner (well-played by James Coburn who seemed born to play the tough, hardened veteran) who stoically, almost resignedly, lives day to day through the crucible of perpetual battle that was the Eastern Front. Steiner is well-loved and respected by the men he leads for they know that he would try to find a way to save them all. The fact that Steiner also has an antiauthoritarian streak in him makes him popular with the grunts. Finally, having won his own Iron Cross (German military's award for bravery above and beyond) from earlier engagements earns him the respect of his men. On the polar opposite is their new commanding officer, the high-blood Prussian Colonel Stransky (played with an aloofness that only Maximillian Schell seems perfect for) whose aristocratic upbringing ill-prepares him for the horrors of combat. But despite his lack of charisma with the men and for not being anything like Steiner, Stransky's still wants an Iron Cross of his own even if he has to resort to outright deception to get one. Caught between these two dynamic characters are the soldiers who bleed and die during these pair's struggles against each other.

It's these battle scenes where Peckinpah makes his stylistic mark. Using the same techniques he relied on for his seminal and best work, The Wild Bunch, Peckinpah shows the horror and brutality of war (especially that of the Eastern Front). Through slow-motion scenes of bullets ripping into flesh and bodies being blown into the air as explosions rip the earth. The effects work in Cross of Iron is abit more advanced than in The Wild Bunch and Peckinpah might've used it abit too much of it for the film. It sometimes felt as if ever quiet moment was broken up by a sequence of battle and violence just so Peckinpah could showcase his talent for creating beautiful violence. Maybe he did it on purpose to show the unending cycle of horror inflicts on even the toughest of men, but after awhile even I became somewhat numb to the violence on the screen.

Despite that little quibble, I still think that Cross of Iron shows Peckinpah at his best late in his tumultous career. Despite a string of forgettable films through most of the 1970's, Sam Peckinpah gets one more chance to work his cinematic magic in 1976. After Cross of Iron, Peckinpah's descent into obscurity continues right up until his death years later. While Cross of Iron might not be on the same level as The Wild Bunch and The Killer Elite, it does have in its execution everything that made Peckinpah great.",1141603200,52,4016,4.767241379310345
969228,2,6305082448,"Here's a brief synopsis:

People with German accents, hiding in a bunker in the woods.  Lots of talking.  Occasionally, they peek out and these random Hollywood explosions start happening.  A few slow motion shots of people dropping dead.

I rented this movie expecting a good depiction of some World War II battles.  I wanted to see strategy...I wanted to see different battle theatres...instead, I got hundreds of shots of a few guys in the same location with occasional explosions.  Boring.  The only people I think that truly enjoy this movie either liked it when it first came out or like it just because Sam Peckinpah directed it.  Truly forgettable.",1141430400,3,656,4.944954128440367

My only gripe is that I wish the commentary track were done by the same four Peckinpah scholars who did The Wild Bunch and The Getaway (among others); those guys are awesome!

969299,5,6305082448,"This is one of the most realisitcally put together war movies ever made about World War II. It is very contraversial because it was done from the point of view of German soldiers, but only a fool would see this thing as pro German or pro nazi. The poltiics of the movie are simply, if anything, anti war and anti authoritarian.

But what many reviewers miss, is the biting realism of this movie. The tanks (real T-34's) the fighting, the explosions, the confusion are all chillingly real, and frightening. You really get a sense of fear and danger from this which you just don't from Hollywood.

But perhaps what is most interesting, is the personal crisis of individuals caught in harms way, which is so often the focus of Pekinhpahs better movies, from ""Straw Dog's"" to ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"". This film focuses on the way different people react to emergencies, horror, and facing the ongoing threat of imminent death. If you have ever been in a life or death situation you will recognize the way some people think fast on their feet, some people rise to the occasions, some falter and hesitate, others drift into fantasy or insanity.... This is where it is most interesting psychologically.

I would also add, that this is one of the few movies I have ever seen on WW II in which the Soviet Army is portrayed as the immenssely powerful war machine which it was in the second half of the war.

Other than a general (small l) libertarian mood of distaste for all forms of authority, forget the politics. This movie has nothing to do with being for or aginst certain groups of people, or anything like that. It is simply a chillingly realistic war film, and as such, something many people more used to standard Hollywood fare just don't get. If you like war films but are disapointed by a lack of realism, if you liked Paths of Glory, Das Boot, When Trumpets Fade, (the original) Alls Quiet on the Western Front, Hamburger Hill, Apocolypse Now, The Longest Day, The Last Valley, and the Samurai -War films of Akira Kirosawa (such as Ron), to name a few, you will love this one. If you prefer bubblegum fantasy like ""pearl harbor"" and ""U571"" and the war films of John Wayne, or if you put some kind of political litmus test on all movies on who they can portray and who they can't, you may not...",1139961600,10,2310,4.545673076923077
969300,4,6305082448,"Sam Peckinpah was never one to make violence, death, and war fun for people to watch, though a lot of people have seen his films that way; he wanted the audience to experience it and come away with hard-hitting truths.  Such was the case with his 1977 World War II movie CROSS OF IRON, a terribly underappreciated war film that never got its proper due in the U.S., largely because of its point of view.

Rather than look from World War II from the American or British point of view, as so many films before and after would do, Peckinpah, in filming this adaptation of Willi Heinrich's novel ""The Iron Cross"", instead focused on looking at the war from the POV of German foot soldiers.  James Coburn is Sgt. Steiner, a soldier committed to the safety of his platoon as the Germans find themselves outmanned by the advancing Russian army, while Maximillian Schell is Stransky, his commandant and a much-despised man, for his ego is driving him to want to get the highest of all German war honors, the Iron Cross, while his autocratic behavior marks him as a coward.  The very meat of this story forces Peckinpah, who had already let drugs and booze interfere too much with the work he was capable of, to be at his best, which he does quite well, helped out by Coburn and Schell, as well as solid supporting performances from James Mason, David Warner, and Austrian actress Senta Berger (who had played a love interest in Peckinpah's 1965 Civil War western MAJOR DUNDEE).

There are flaws in this film, but they have very little to do with Peckinpah himself, though as mentioned before his drinking and drug usage were spinning out of control by the time of the film's making.  The director had considerable budgetary constraints to work with, the product of dealing with a small-time producer (Wolf Hartwig) of porno films in Germany who had raised the money to make this film based on Peckinpah's name but never had the money altogether at any time during the production of the movie.  With a crack crew that included production designer Ted Haworth, assistant director Newt Arnold, special effects man Sass Bedig, and cinematographer John Coquillon, however, CROSS OF IRON manages to avoid most of its budgetary pratfalls and emerges as a scathing look at the brutality of war.  Seeing the war through the eyes of German foot soldiers may not have sat well with U.S. audiences, but Peckinpah's choice to do it this way was the right one because it gets to the truth of war instead of opting for John Wayne jingoism and faux-patriotism.

The montage editing and the action scenes in CROSS OF IRON are Peckinpah at his best, and make this film comparable in quality and intensity to such great war films as PATHS OF GLORY, PLATOON, SAVING PRIVATE RYAN, and FULL METAL JACKET.  It is a hidden gem of its genre, and a clear example of why Peckinpah, as tough-assed a reprobate as Hollywood had ever seen, was a master of his craft.",1139788800,5,2928,4.667961165048544

969303,4,6305082448,"and before HBO's Band of Brothers there was Cross of Iron.  Spielberg's Saving Private Ryan was much-praised for its bloody, ultra-realistic opening twenty minute sequence. Band of Brothers was much praised for its realistic portrayal of the comraderie that, more than almost anything else, kept soldiers alive through death and deprivation.  Sam Peckinpah haunting Cross of Iron presaged both the film and the series by over twenty years.

Although perhaps lacking in some of Private Ryan's cinematic artistry and not long enough at 128 minutes to plumb the depths of individual characters as Band of Brothers, Cross of Iron is a compelling portrayal of the horrors of war as actually fought and not as imagined by those weaned on a diet of John Wayne war movies and Sgt. Rock comic books.

Cross of Iron centers on the lives of a small German army group on the Eastern Front in 1943.  If war generally is hell, the battles fought between the German and Soviet army represents is a level of hell that even Dante could not imagine.  Rolf Steiner, played adroitly by James Coburn, is a corporal. Both stoic and heroic, Coburn is admired by the men in his platoon and a legend among the German officers familiar with `his work'.  He is a recipient of the Iron Cross, the Wermacht's highest honor.  After an opening battle, one Captain Stransky (played by Maximillian Schell) arrives on the scene.  A member of the elite and elitist Prussian officer class, Stransky has had himself transferred from a cushy assignment in occupied France to the eastern front for the sole purpose of winning, by any means necessary, an Iron Cross.  His family honor demands it.

As might be expected, it doesn't take Steiner long to develop an intense loathing for Stransky.  Stransky quickly determine that if he can't co-opt Steiner he must do everything possible to eliminate him. The war between Stransky and Steiner that runs parallel to the war itself is the emotional core of the movie.  As one might expect the battle scenes are vivid and played out in the type of slow motion that one comes to expect from Peckinpah.

Cross of Iron has its flaws.  A few scenes, particularly the film's one romantic interlude seem strangely out of place, almost as if the producer ordered Peckinpah to bring introduce a few attractive women into the plot.  Romance was never Peckinpah's strong point.  Second, the quality of the DVD itself seems lacking.  I suppose this film isn't popular enough to put into a better format or include the type of extras one gets used to on most new DVD releases.  That isn't the film's fault per se but it did take a little enjoyment out of the viewing process.

Some have asserted that Cross of Iron is an antiwar movie.  I disagree.  The impression I got was that Peckinpah was more intent at looking at the horror that war brings out in the human condition.  As the film ends Peckinpah puts up the following quotation from Berthold Brecht's The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui: ""Do not rejoice, you men. For though the world stood up and stopped the bastard, the bitch that bore him is in heat again.""  I don't think it is war, per se, that Peckinpah loathes as much as he does those leaders who cry ""havoc"" and let slip the dogs of war so willingly.

Despite its flaws Cross of Iron is a film worth watching.",1131580800,11,3315,4.693771626297578

Stransky, a Prussian aristocrat, has transferred to the bloody front for the express purpose of acquiring a medal, the Iron Cross, awarded to those who display remarkable courage under fire.

 CROSS OF IRON is, in many ways, a typical Sam Peckinpah movie.  As usual, the frontiers of masculine identity are explored through a rough combination of camaraderie and violence. (Note to self: You've either seen too many Peckinpah movies or you've listened to too many commentary tracks on Criterion and Kino releases.)  In any event, Coburn is the natural hero, one who feels secure enough to contemptuously toss the coveted `hunk of metal' at the weak Schell, someone who outranks him only artificially, as a member of a higher class, both socially and militarily.

 I may have watched too many Peckinpah movies because I tend to like them quite a bit.  So I put this dvd in the player with high expectations, some of which were met, some not.  The battle sequences were well handled and the gritty and often desperate conditions on the front lines came across forcefully. Schell, playing the first movie character I've seen described as a `poltroon' on a dvd plot synopsis, is simultaneously craven and ambitious and the best thing in the movie.  James Mason, as Schell's immediate commander, is very good, too.  Coburn is an effective Peckinpah hero - he never calls retreat, runs toward the sound of fire, bonds with his comrades over a bottle, and spends a confusing scene or two with The Woman.  In this case she's named Eva and is played by Senta Berger in a starched nurse's uniform.

  With Peckinpah I always leave open the possibility that I missed something big and important, but after one viewing I thought the scenes with Berger impossibly slowed down the movie and were muddled beyond reason.  The other big problem I had with CROSS OF IRON was the last scene, which seemed a rushed improvisation that didn't quite fit. The final montage, which plays over the closing titles, seems to stamp the movie as an anti-war film, which seems a little disingenuous.  Coburn's character may be anti-authority - a prerequisite for a Peckinpah hero - but this isn't a `horrors of war' movie.  More like a `horrors of inept and inadequate commanders' movie.  Still, the lead characters were strong, the story iconoclastic, the acting and photography well above average.  I'd give it a stronger recommendation, but the Hen Tooth's version I watched was a full-screen presentation that apparently was edited down.",1131494400,7,2857,4.9600840336134455

969306,5,6305082448,"Cross of Iron is no doubt Sam Peckinpahs second greatest film, only being topped by The Wild Bunch.

The cast is excellently led by the late James Coburn. In supporting roles are James Mason, David Warner, Maximilian Schell and Senta Berger.

Although this film is oft praised for it's anti-war sentiment, I only watch Peckinpah for one thing, superb action scenes. In this respect Cross of Iron does not let the viewer down. The slow motion decimation Peckinpah is famous for, abounds throughout the film. Battle scenes are enhanced by the use of tanks and planes in addition to the usual small arms. Bodies are ripped asunder by artillery and grenade alike.

I never cease to be amazed by the attention to detail in Peckipah's films. Cross of Iron is no exception. Uniforms, weapons and the smallest insignia are accurately and faithfully reproduced. Peckinpah even managed to obtain original T-34 tanks from the Yugoslav army for several battle sequences.

The movies plot is simple, the German army is reeling under a major Russian offensive which will eventually drive the Germans out of the Crimea. Coburn leads a German infantry squad whose primary mission is covert action behind the Russian lines. We soon realize that this weary band is more concerned with survival than anything else. Cpl/Sgt Steiner (Coburn) has his hands full battling not only the Russians but the hierarchy of the German Army as well. He is not concerned with medals, uniforms or the fuehrers dreams of conquest, but simply living to see another day. He holds in contempt the Iron Cross grabbing glory hounds so pervasive in the German army and portrayed by Schell who arranges for Steiners squad to be abandoned during a major withdrawal. The forthcoming attempts at survival by the beleaguered squad lead to the main battle scenes.

My only complaint is the poor quality of the dvd transfer. Why bother to distribute a fine production such as this if it's not going to be done right?",1115337600,14,1967,4.912650602409639

  Firstly i'd like to concerntrate on the fight scenes. Although not as good as in other war films such as Hamburger Hill and Full Metal Jacket, they are pleasing to the eye, Peckinpah again using his unique style of slow motion whenever someone os killed, shot or even blow up. Gory as the gun shot wounds may be, it proved much less controversial as many of his other flicks, even though it contains a gruesome scene in which a woman bites of a soliders genitals, which you don't see in full, but leaves much to the imagination.

  The story is good and strong, it hangs a bit limp on some occasions however by the end gets much much better.",1114992000,9,861,4.383647798742138
969308,5,6305082448,"It is not enough to win a medal: It is precise also, to deserve it. Once more the monumental directorial work of Sam Peckinpah based on a memorable script, magnificent handle work, remarkable set up process, sharp cynicism and tension state all along this work make of this film one of my personal favorite movies in any age.

Russian Front War: 1943. The German troops are progressively confined to abandon their positions. An outlaw officer, Steiner superbly played by James Coburn who to my mind made the best acting of his career has his own ethic war with the Captain Maximilian Schell who wishes with frenetic obsession to win the Cross of Iron no matter how. After a sinister and brutal attack in which Andrews the real leader of the Group is killed in action, this nasty officer pretends to make a false report appearing as the head commander, but sooner the truth will be revealed when Steiner winner of the Cross, denies this wrong statement. So, as you can see, the war is not more than a simple frame in which the effective war will be placed in personal terms. Steiner will be sent to a secure death when he refuse to inform about an evacuation order.

There have been many films in which the delicate and candent issue of the moral, ethic and honor are used as smart device to get undeserved honors falsifying the reality, but really there are such a few that exhibit with all the required intensity and realism: Paths of glory, Bitter victory and this one among the most representatives in this sense.

Peckinpah' s  artistic commitment is -once more- carved in relief with astonishing fairness. Mason is solvent and expressive in his secondary role.

Watch for Berthold Brecht's statement after the final credits.

A must for you to acquire this outstanding film!",1114905600,7,1779,4.741100323624596
969437,4,6305082448,"Cross of Iron is director Sam Peckinpah's only attempt at a war movie, and it really hits the mark.  In 1943, the German Army is retreating across Russia after Hitler's failed attack into the Soviet Union.  Sergeant Rolf Steiner, a veteran who is tired of war, leads a reconnaisance platoon as the Germans retreat.  His battalion receives a new commander, Captain Stransky, who wants to get an Iron Cross no matter what it takes, even if that means sacrificing his own men.  Now, Steiner must try and protect his men not only from the Russians, but his own commander.  With Cross of Iron, Peckinpah presents a powerful anti-war message.  The battles, bloody but not overly gory, show the horror and chaos of fighting.  The German soldiers are not stereotypical ""evil"" Nazis; they are tired, lonely men who are fed up with the stupidity of war.  The whole movie builds up to a startling and moving climax.  Overall, a great anti-war movie.

  James Coburn is excellent as Sgt. Rolf Steiner, a platoon leader who must try and keep his men alive as they retreat across Russia.  Coburn did some of his best work for Peckinpah including this role, Pat Garrett and Billy the Kid, and Major Dundee.  Maximillian Schell stars as Capt. Stransky, the officer from Prussian aristocracy who wants an Iron Cross at all costs.  James Mason and David Warner are also very good as Major Brandt and Capt. Keisel, two officers in Steiner's battalion.  In a small part, Senta Berger plays Eva, a nurse who takes an interest in Steiner.  Cross of Iron also stars Klaus Lowitsch, Vadim Glowna, and Roger Fritz.  The DVD offers the movie in a washed-out standard presentation with sound that goes in and out.  This is an excellent movie, but try and find a better copy than this cruddy DVD.  For a powerful anti-war movie from Sam Peckinpah starring James Coburn, check out Cross of Iron!",1111276800,7,1866,4.736024844720497
969438,4,6305082448,"It is quite hard to fault this offering from director Sam Peckinpah even if some might argue that it was very much a case of ""miscasting"" when it came to two distinguished English actors playing a colonel and his arm-in-a-sling, chain-smoking, disillusioned adjutant, and an American actor playing the hard-bitten German army non-commissioned officer. Nevertheless, one should be able to credit James Coburn's very respectable performance as Sergeant Rolf Steiner, the man upon whose shoulders lies the burden of command of a reconnaissance platoon on the Eastern Front in 1943.

At this stage of the Second World War, Germany is retreating from the East and the images of war, with blood gushing from wounded and dying soldiers (using the slow-motion technique for which Peckinpah was famed) and debris from shell-hits flying in all directions, are quite powerful. The violent aspects of some of his films were something which Peckinpah received a lot of criticism for, yet war was war, and he was not going to sugarcoat it for any audience. This was, after all, a brutal, total war where more than 20 million citizens of the then USSR, most of them civilians, were killed by the Germans, something that Steiner was only too well aware of when he remarked that ""nobody will ever forgive or forget Germany for this"".

Steiner's nemesis is his new CO, an aristocratic Prussian, Captain Stransky (Maximilian Schell). Considering that all the German soldiers were scruffy, dirty, stinking, and so on, given their conditions, I was surprised that Stransky did not play the stereotypical spit-and-polish officer by ordering his men to clean themselves up, polish their boots, report for parade every morning at six, and so on. Perhaps, though, that is a comic book stereotype, and it was well that it was avoided.

Nevertheless, Stransky does not conceal his reason for volunteering for the front instead of staying in occupied France. He allegedly has family honor to maintain, something that Steiner could not give a hang for, especially when it seems that he is more than ready to take credit for leading a counter-attack when the real man who led it was killed. Stransky's sycophantic adjutant, Second Lieutenant Triebig (Roger Fritz), had attested to his blatent lies, but Colonel Brandt (James Mason) and his adjutant, Captain Kiesel (David Warner), doubted the veracity of the Prussian and called for both Triebig and Steiner to confirm or deny the report made by him.

Steiner uses this occasion to make his impassioned, albeit low-voiced condemnation of the war, the army and the Nazi regime, and leaves Brandt, who admires the veteran soldier greatly, in a quandary; unless Steiner refutes what Stransky said in his report, the Prussian would be awarded his coveted Iron Cross, yet the sergeant is way past caring.

One particularly memorable scene was the bizarre one at the hospital, where Steiner either witnesses or else imagines he is witnessing a gathering of people, including a high ranking German army general, who looks as if he has never even been to the front in his life. The moment, where a fellow wounded comrade shows the general what remains of his arms as stumps and then one of his legs as his equivalent of a ""handshake"", is a powerful reminder not just of what physical damage close-quarter combat can inflict on a soldier, but also of what psychological damage it can do. Steiner's rage at seeing rich food and spotlessly clean dinner plates boils over and he predictably lets everybody know what he thinks about it all.

Peckinpah's anti-war film, based on a novel by Willi Heinrich, shows how graphically the fighting between the Germans and the Soviets is conducted. Certainly, the use of old T-34 tanks adds to the authenticity of the hardware used - even Steiner's preferred weapon of choice was a Russian sub-machine gun, characterized by the distinctive round magazine. The director was also unafraid of showing the macabre and the gruesome, as witnessed by the scenes involving Steiner's platoon and the Russian army women, where two of the Germans, including a very young private recently arrived at the front, meet somewhat grislier than expected ends.

Ultimately, bullets, mortar shells, aerial bombs and tank shells rain down on the Germans and are no respecter of rank, status, orders or desires for decorations, as Stransky finds out, much to Steiner's amusement as he finds out that the Prussian is hopeless when it comes to his having a weapon in his hands. ""I'll show you where the Iron Crosses grow,"" says Steiner shortly before the end, although, given the images that were shown during the closing credits, one would have thought that it would have been appropriate to have shown row upon row of graves of German soldiers with their helmets planted on top of crosses. The action would have gone from cross of iron to cross of wood, in other words, a stark contrast from the pre-war images of idealistic Hitler Youth members bearing Nazi flags and crossing mountains, along with a children's song on the soundtrack, during the opening credits.",1106870400,6,5090,5.0165680473372785

969440,5,6305082448,"Cross of Iron can rightly stand along the sides of anti-war films like Paths of Glory and The Thin Red Line where it borrows from the former and has given to the latter. For this reason it forms a very important and integral part of the development of war films that where to precede it because of the chosen subject matter Nazis (the goods guys) versus the Russians (the bad guys). Cross of Iron was the closest thing that Hollywood could deliver on an anti-communist / anti-Russian theme at the time. Making Nazis heroes would somehow maybe seem like bad judgement but really the film is not about good vs. bad and the screenplay goes at length to get this point across. In fact it is the script that really green lights this project and supersedes any suspicion of being an anti-semitic film. Although this movie goes to great lengths to show the horrors of war, the corruption of leadership, and the desires of men, it does sometimes falter into melodrama now and again, however when Cross of Iron is on form the acting is unquestionably solid, by everybody, including the bit part cannon fodder cast members. Some of the dialogue is absolutely remarkable - ""God is a Sadist"" - ""I hate every officer"" - ""What will we do when we have lost the war?""... Captain Kiesel, ""Prepare for the next one.""

Any typical Hollywood clich moments in this movie can thus be forgiven and are entirely consumed by the weight of the plot, technical direction and the outstanding performances of all concerned. Part war film / part psychological assessment it is all about the wastes of war. Captains are ordered to go back to Berlin and hide, to try and save what is left of Germany's best men, to continue the line while lesser men are driven into the field by commanders who hide under tables with radios and then have witnesses falsify documents that can gain them the medal that they want - the iron cross.

It actually hard to describe the premise of this movie as there is much in it to comprehend and repeat viewing is absolutely a must. Sam Peckinpah directs the film entirely from the German view point - there is not a Brit or Yank in sight. Peckinpah, like Paul Verhoeven, has a certain violent style to most of their films. Here Peckinpah made the studio nervous, not because of the subject matter, but because of the violence on display. Cross of Iron is an extremely violent war film. Children and women are shot. Men loose their private parts to Russian women they abuse... quite graphically. The ending is not shy of what the director did for The Wild Bunch.

The story is set during the last days of the Reich with James Coburn playing the rebellious Steiner, who although has the backing of his commanders is also their bane for his insubordination. While trying to keep his squad alive during such bleak times he has to contend to an aristocratic commander, Stransky (Maximilian Schell) who lies to his superiors Brandt (James Mason) and Kiesel (David Warner) so he can get the Iron Cross. Steiner sees this as an act of a coward and focuses all of his hate on this man. The play between the two actors is interesting with many controversial military topics touched upon and many debates as to the nature of war.

Even though the Hollywood behind the strings appears at times there is no doubt that this film lacks the schmaltz element that detracts from war films (such as Saving Private Ryan) and Peckinpah really does bring out the lost feelings in soldiers, the depression, the claustrophobia of it all with a very bleak tone to the film stock itself. This is one of the darkest war films you will every likely see with some psychedelic flashback type editing that illustrates the post traumatic stress syndrome vividly.

This is Unquestionably, Most Excellent Cinema and one of Pekinpah's finest moments. I rate it up there with Straw Dogs and The Wild Bunch no problem. If you have not seen it then you should. This isn't your average war film by a long shot.",1103328000,6,3969,4.6321022727272725

He is invaluable in this role and his face and presentation embodies Steiner completely.  Steiner is the existentialist anti-hero, anti-authority and bearing the marks of a cynic, he nonetheless cares about the fate of his men in a war that is absurd.  From stupid and vain superior officers, to petty infighting amongst one's own ranks, this film embodies war not as something heroic, but as something solitary and individual. . . . .",1101859200,5,607,4.7075471698113205

969443,4,6305082448,"It takes guts for a film director to make a WWII film from the German perspective, but Peckinpah had plenty and pulled it off quite well. The setting is in Crimea during the 1943 Russian counter offensive against retreating German troops. German forces are demoralized after the 6th Army's collapse and complete surrender at Stalingrad. The German's main objective now is retreat and survival, not the expansion of the Aryan culture and master race.

Sgt. Steiner (James Coburn) is a complex character and the paradox of the ideal soldier. He hates the rigid hierarchy of military order but is the best fighting man on the field 'Do you know how much I hate this uniform and everything it stands for?' Keeping his men safe is his main concern and he could care less about the war or the party's ideology. In addition to worrying about the evermore certain Russian counter offensive, Steiner is under the command of Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell): a glory hunting Prussian 'Junker' aristocrat who will stop at nothing to get his share of glory before the war wraps up. Too cowardly to earn his Iron Cross in actual combat, Stransky tries to manipulate Steiner and others to vouch for his false claims of courageous deeds; when Steiner refuses, Stransky stops at nothing to make sure he disappears.

This is a typical blood and guts, man's world, do or die, Penckinpah movie (e.g. 'The Wild Bunch', 'Bring Me The Head of Alfredo Garcia). Although Peckinpah emphasizes on the horror and futility of war, the film's portrayal of the human condition is quite cynical. Peckinpah seems to suggest that war, as horrid as it is, is a fundamental part of human nature and that such a reality is unlikely to change any time soon. This theme is reflected in dialogue such as Q: 'What will we do when we lose this war?' A: 'Prepare for the next one' or Q: 'Do you love the war so much? Or are you afraid of what you will become without it?'. Another great line: Q: 'Do you think there's a god Steiner?' A: 'I think God is a sadist but probably just doesn't realize it.' The movie is older and has limitations in film quality but it is very well directed. The film is also extremely faithful to the armaments, uniforms, and tactics of WWII.  If you like action and good drama, this is a movie to watch.",1090540800,6,2295,4.6339066339066335
969444,3,6305082448,"I would rate it 3.5 stars, because it's better than average as compared to other ww2 films however there are a few small problems I have with this movie. First off, the opening minutes contain scenes of implied homosexulaity between the german soldiers. I'm not sure the accuracy of this, although no doubt it probably did happen, but seems to be a fairly important point thoughout parts of this movie. If this is supposed to further convince the audience of the depraved nature of the soldiers, it works in that regard but it is quite obvious that they are depraved anyway and that added nothing to the storyline nor to the plot.
The other problem I have is, although most of the battle scenes contain close to accurate german and russian weapons, the overhead bombing scenes contain shots of U.S. navy corsairs dropping bombs. These were probably stock footage taken from a navy film and look horribly out-of place here.
But despite those two issues, most of the rest of the movie is good and portrays an accurate, interesting and engaging portrait of battle in the russian theatre during ww2. I especially liked the use of light as most of the battle scenes were shot as daytime attacks and that indeed was the way it happened on the russian front. The sneak attack at the bridge by Steiner's platoon was filmed and sequenced to show all of the moves by the attackers, leaving nothing hidden or off camera. Certainly an interesting way to portray this kind of sequence and it came out quite effectively.
Sam Peckinpah uses the slow motion to good effect and has indeed changed the face of war films circa 1977. Every war movie that was released after this movie tends to show a more grimmer and graphic view of war and that is certainly how it should be done as there is nothing glorious or heroic about war. Those are the words used by the politicians that order people to fight each other to the death.
Great casting, excellent camera work and a good story combined with music that adds a sense of innocence lost and horror to the subject, all ad up to not quite a classic but a very good depiction of ww2 battle action in the Russian theatre.",1087776000,4,2148,4.581818181818182
969445,5,6305082448,"I would argue that this is the best war movie around, followed closely by Peter Weir's Gallipoli.
Peckinpah is such a brilliant director, and so much more subtle than is immediately obvious.
By chosing Germans and Russians as protagonists, classical bad guys, the viewer does not really root for any side. He also chooses Crimea 1943 as the setting. Therefore we enter the film with very few preconceptions.
To add gravity to his message he does not use typical war music in his score; he mixes it with children's rhymes!
The soldiers on both sides are just soldiers, not particularly bad, not particularly good. They are rather portrayed as beeing trapped in a game played by the people behind the front. Most just try to survive, the only exception is the German front line commander who still clings to the, more decent, values of a bygone era.
Even the ""bad guy"" is not really a typical film ""bad guy"". He is weak and egotistic, he does not want to be at the front, he does not want this war. In the end sergeant Steiner ackowledges that
and gives him a chance to redeem himself ('Take this submachine-gun and win your iron cross like a man.').
Where Peckinpah's other films are hyperrealistic this one has a more dreamlike (nightmarish!) character. The Russian tanks have a quality of angels of vengeance, and the devastation after the battles are more reminiscent of Brueghel's visions of hell than of the ""great day out for the lads"" type vision we have from the usual Hollywood fare.
This is great action, but it has a very strong anti-war message. I think that people who only want to see a war movie will feel oddly disturbed after watching it. I think that is the reason for some negative reviews.",1083888000,7,1708,4.658940397350993
969446,2,6305082448,"""Cross of Iron"" is a bad movie, made with preconcieved notions that do not fit history or reality. It makes the double mistake of A) cramming an American-style character (the lone wolf anti-hero) into a German uniform and B) tacking the director's well-known appetite for blood and graphic violence to a silly antiwar message.

The movie follows the conflict between an embittered and defiant combat soldier named Stiener (played by James Coburn) and his new CO, a glory-seeking martinet named Stransky (played by Maximillian Schell). From the git-go, the movie follows every stale antiwar convention in the book: the bitter, insubordinate sergeant with an unspoken love for his men vs. the bloodthirsty killer-officer who wants to win a medal and doesn't care how many men die in the process. We've seen this in numerous American war movies, but it never quite works in German unfiorm. This wasn't a democracy; discipline in the Wehrmacht, particularly during the period in questoon, was severe and the slightest defeatism or insubordination were ruthlessly punished. The scene, for example, where Stiener berates and threatens a replacement soldier who is a Party member would probably never have happened. By late 1943 even officers were being degraded and sent off to suicide-squad 'punishment battalions' for minor transgressions or seditious statements. In reality, a soldier like Stiener would have most likely been shot, sent to a military prison or killed off digging up land mines in a penal outfit. The ""lone wolf"" mentality was simply not tolerated in the German army of 1943 (in Sajer's  ""Forgotten Soldier"" a lieutenant is demoted to corporal and sent to the punishment squad for losing his field telephone when he swam the 900-yard Don River...what would have happened to Stiener for mouthing off to the colonel?).

Additionally, we have more sterotypes: the loveable but doomed men of Stiener's squad, including the ""I have dead meat written all over me"" teenage boy, the evil Party member, the cowardly lieutenant, the well-meaning but ultimately hapless senior officers (played by James Mason and David Warner) and the obligatory scene where we find out that the Russians are people too. Really, the film is very similar in structure to a Dirty Harry movie: the lone-wolf anti-hero who scorns medals and glory, the pencil-pushing politician/boss, and nice-guy dead-meat partner, the ultimate hollow victory....blah blah blah.

""Cross of Iron"" is undermined by the love of cruelty that Sam Peckinpah was rightly infamous for. Graphic violence certainly has its place in a war movie, but as usual, Peckinpah felt the need to cram the viewer nose-first into buckets of human gore. This cheapens the antiwar theme of the movie; viciousness is fine so long as it is committed by the hero, but dastardly if if perpetrated by the villain. Morally, the massage of the movie is unclear: Stiener does not avenge the death of the innocent young soldier by the Russian POW women, but later brutally kills his own lieutenant for shooting others of his squad. Then, when confronting Stransky, who actually gave the order by blackmailing the cowardly lieutenant, he does not kill him but gives him a chance to ""show that Prussians can fight."" Okay, Stiener is probably insane by the end of the film, but none of this made sense to me. In Peckinpah's mind, the trembling lieutenant deserves to die more than Stransky, because he's afraid and ""just wants to go home"" wheras Stransky, while evil, deserves to live because he is not a hypocrite: he is willing to kill and allow others to be killed for his Iron Cross, but is also willing to fight himself. Maybe Peckinpah's theme was that war is unfair. So it all balances out, I guess?

I guess not. ""Cross of Iron"" is a chronically over-rated war movie that bludgeons the viewer with Americanized themes, graphic violence, and a hypocritical antiwar message, brought to you by a director who idolized violent men. As entertainment it is a matter of taste, but as historical fiction, it is nonsense.

UPDATE 2/12/06

I knew this review would be pummeled when I wrote it (1/2/2004) but recently I came across something that I thought I'd share here, because I think it proves my point.

Major Georg Grossjohann served with the German army from 1928 to 1945. He was a Prussian, but not of the ""officer class"" or an aristocrat. The first 12 years of his military service were as an enlisted man and NCO; he did not get a commission until 1940. During the war he fought on four different fronts and racked up a bucketfull of medals including the Knight's Cross, the German Cross in Gold, the Iron Crosses First & Second Class, and the Wound Badge. His memiors are forewarded by a retired American general. In short: he was a brave, honorable, and credible man. In the introduction to his book, ""Five Years, Four Fronts"" he writes:

""The recipe for an antiofficer novel is simple. The cast of characters would typically include a brutal general, thirsy for glory at any price; stupid, incapable officers; a bunch of helpless, gentle, and sensitive soldiers; and some girls with whom the soldiers can engage in a bit of sex while on home leave. Now for the plot: during a surprise breakthrough by the enemy, the officers naturally fail completely. After having puked the stolen French wine, the drunken general is killed by brave Red Army soldiers. Only a young sergeant keeps a clear head. He gathers his scattered Landsers and leads them back to the saftey of his own lines. Throw in a hideous war crime or two and some anti-Hitler jokes by the enlisted men, and you've got a winner every time.""

Does any of this sound familiar?

Mind you, Grossjohan was writing about the ""Landser-hilfe"" -- the cheap anti-officer novels that abounded after the war, not a movie. But ""Cross of Iron"" was based on a novel of the same name, and it certainly fit in this category. Every character and every situation in the movie was scooped out of this cliched grab-bag. Grossjohan calls such novels ""cheap, trite, gushingly sentimental, and absolutely unrealistic trash written by entertainers."" He goes on to point out that during WWII, 287 German generals were killed in battle -- as opposed to about a half dozen American generals, for example -- and that casualty rates for officers were usually substantially higher than for enlisted men in German outfits, especially Russia. Finally, he adds that most German officers served as enlisted men first, and that cowardice and incompetence were not likely to get a man promoted to the officer ranks.

So, there you have it, from a guy who spent 13 years as a grunt and won even more medals than good ol' Sgt. Steiner. If you like ""Cross of Iron"" as a movie, that is, as I said before, a matter of taste; but as history, it's nonsense.",1073001600,10,6814,4.905381944444445

One of the most violent war epics before Full Metal Jacket and Private Ryan seems so weak and boring right now!!!...Do not get this edition because you will regret it and don't lsiten to does who have seen only the cut version of the film...someday they will also admire this masterpiece, when some wise distributor release the film in its correct way!

969518,4,6305082448,"Cross Of Iron is one war film that will take repeat viewings to truly absorb all the material. With that said, I won't elaborate on the film's strong points since they've already been mentioned by many before. And this DVD release from Hen's Tooth is not the one to view this film from. It is a shortened edited version and the transfer is Full-Frame, it doesn't even appear to be Pan & Scan...simply a dead shot down the middle of the film. The quality of this Hen's Tooth release is absolutely atrocious for the DVD format. It appears as though it's almost a VHS transfer, or a heavily worn film transfer at best. There are numerous scratches and dust artifacts, and the color saturation is very faded in many scenes. The sound on the DVD is equally terrible during the entire movie, it's very hard to understand much of the dialogue at times.
I've purchased bargain DVD's for $3 before that are 100% better in quality than this! Just by the sheer fact that the film is edited would have Peckinpah rolling in his grave. Hen's Tooth knows and have admitted that the transfer is horrible, yet they still charge $30 retail nearly 4 years after their DVD release?!?? There is no way that this disc is worth that much money. I would gladly pay the price if it was a Criterion edition, but not this poor edition.
If you have the technical capability I recommend ordering either the UK DVD or Japanese DVD of Cross Of Iron. It won't cost you much more (perhaps less) than this unworthy Region 1 DVD release. The imports both present the film in it's original anamorphic widescreen format, with vastly superior picture and sound. If you don't have the technical capability, then buy a VHS edition of Cross Of Iron.

He used it a lot in the much heralded ""The Wild Bunch"", but it seems much more appropriate for the war scenes here. The acting is mostly first rate, especially by Maximilian Schell, but the rumoured heavy editing for this flick is evident.
The DVD transfer is atrocious in all areas, but is most noticeable with the sound. This DVD deserves to be cleaned up and remastered. Some of those explosions just don't feel right with a hollow boom sound, especially since Peckinpah so wonderfully captured many of the explosions with debris flying toward the camera. You really want to feel the movie, but unfortunately cannot. Much of the fault lies in Hen's Tooth (the distrbutor), but who knows what condition the original film is in. It just might not be profitable to make the transfer which is regretable. It's everybody's loss as a result.",1061856000,3,1009,4.804597701149425

This was the most realistic I had never seen such a realistic movie about modern as this one until ""Saving Private Ryan"" came along and raised the bar.  The rear area scenes were a bit overdone with their anti-war message. But they show the pathos wounded soldiers endured as they healed and prepared to return to hellish Eastern front. That Nazi party members and high ranking officers lived well while the troops did not is true.  That the troops fought for each other and not ""crosses of iron"" was true then and is true today.  This movie captured the dirt, fear and blood of war like no other until ""Ryan"". It celebrates honor, courage, leadership under incredible circumstances and love of comrades.

969521,4,6305082448,"Film director Sam Peckinpah's career was winding down in 1977 when he shocked international critics with his primitive, unconventional anti-war epic ""Cross of Iron."" To this day, critics and authors alike don't really no what to make of this ferocious film. At times inspired, at others pretentious, Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" is kind of the black sheep of classic cinema war flicks - it is difficult to like, but equally deserving of respect.
I suppose the legend behind ""Cross of Iron"" has been told many times. Immediately after viewing this film, Orson Welles fired off a letter to Peckinpah calling it ""the greatest anti-war film ever made."" I agree with Welles' stance. One can never really relax while watching the muddy carnage of ""Cross of Iron."" Explosions constantly rattle the sets, dialogue is difficult to hear due to the cries of dying men in the background. Peckinpah's trademark rapid-fire editing, perhaps used a bit too much in this film (if not many of his post-""Wild Bunch"" films), will leave viewers shellshocked. Battlefield distractions reign supreme. As a viewer, we are living with these filthy soldiers in the rat and lice infested bunkers.
In Peckinpah's ""Cross of Iron"" universe, told from the viewpoint of German soliders on the Russian front in 1943, there is no glory in war. Cynical men are trying to survive poor leadership, dying German philosophies and the constant thunder of Russain bombs and bullets.
James Coburn gives the finest performance of his career as veteran sergeant Steiner. He leads his weary platoon from one skirmish to the next, knowing all is for a lost cause. He rebels against the German leadership, shown in the form of two opposite commanders - one seeking glory (Maximilian Schell), the other survival (James Mason). Due to politics and resentment, Coburn's men find themselves forgotten behind enemy lines. Left for dead, they have to fight their way back to the German front before being completely wiped out by advancing Russian soldiers. What they encounter along the way is unexpected, harsh and eventually tragic.
""Cross of Iron"" is a superior war film to such classics as ""Platoon,"" ""The Big Red One"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"" simply because there is never a moment of true heroism during it's 130-minute running time. Flowery ideals for such bloodshed never become clear. Most importantly, there is never an instant when viewers can relax with the smug comfort that war has purpose. In ""Cross of Iron,"" human life is worth a wooden nickel. There are no heroes. And most terrifying of all, the war which takes place in Peckinpah's unforgettable film is not a war anyone would ever want to be a part of.",1057276800,3,2670,4.988789237668161

Unfortunately, aside from all the mayhem, the movie offers nothing else.
There's really not much of a plot here.

969667,5,6305082448,"This is one of the most realisitcally put together war movies ever made about World War II.  It is very contraversial because it was done from the point of view of German soldiers, but only a fool would see this thing as pro German or pro nazi.  The poltiics of the movie are simply, if anything, anti war and anti authoritarian.
But what many reviewers miss, is the biting realism of this movie.  The tanks (real T-34's) the fighting, the explosions, the confusion are all chillingly real, and frightening.  You really get a sense of fear and danger from this which you just don't from Hollywood.
But perhaps what is most interesting, is the personal crisis of individuals caught in harms way, which is so often the focus of Pekinhpahs better movies, from ""Straw Dog's"" to ""Bring me the Head of Alfredo Garcia"".  This film focuses on the way different people react to emergencies, horror, and facing the ongoing threat of imminent death.  If you have ever been in a life or death situation you will recognize the way some people think fast on their feet, some people rise to the occasions, some falter and hesitate, others drift into fantasy or insanity.... This is where it is most interesting psychologically.
I would also add, that this is one of the few movies I have ever seen on WW II in which the Soviet Army is portrayed as the immenssely powerful war machine which it was in the second half of the war.
Other than a general (small l) libertarian mood of distaste for all forms of authority, forget the politics.  This movie has nothing to do with being for or aginst certain groups of people, or anything like that.  It is simply a chillingly realistic war film, and as such, something many people more used to standard Hollywood fare just don't get.

969669,5,6305082448,"Cross Of Iron is a masterpiece, one of the greatest anti-war, anti-authoritarian movies.  It is one of director Sam Peckinpah's two finest works -- the other being The Wild Bunch. It deserves to be ranked in the same great war movie company as Apocalypse Now, Das Boot, Full Metal Jacket, Paths Of Glory, Saving Private Ryan, Seven Samurai, and Zulu.  Its setting on the World War Two Eastern Front, its gruesomeness, and its risk-taking viewpoint on ugly combat from the German side, have tended to count against fair assessment of its considerable artistic achievements.  Viewers wary of the morality of its German viewpoint and its explicitness might find that it is fundamentally about humanity in general as a victim of war.  The film reflects on the humanity which may be found on all sides of conflict--including Russian humanity portrayed variously as relentless, innocent, brave, and feminine.

Cross Of Iron opens with an intense, chilling montage of children's song, propaganda vision, combat newsreel and atrocity.  By the end of the main title this montage subtly introduces the central characters, a German reconnaissance unit patrolling on the 1943 Russian front.

This 1977 film set rarely matched standards of cinematic mayhem.  Cross Of Iron explosions don't look merely like pretty fireballs -- they blast fragments, rocks and debris, leaving no doubt as to why blood gouts from stumps of limbs and shrapnel-shredded entrails... Amid the screams of wounded and dying, as dust subsides from a mortar barrage, an artillery piece shorn of its crew by a near hit swings across a pocked battlefield, its traversing wheel spinning under its own momentum.  The carnage occurs in the choreographed slow motion which Peckinpah made his signature.

James Coburn turns in one of his finest roles as Rolf Steiner, a highly decorated NCO who leads a German reconnaissance squad.  Steiner fights less for his country than for his comrades.  He has low opinions of class and rank distinctions.  He is contemptuous both of Nazism and the aristocratic Prussian arrogance of his new superior officer, Captain Stransky, played with great style by Maximilian Schell.  But there are hints of a dark side.  Although Steiner is articulate and philosophical he has no answer when his love interest during an enforced break from battle, nurse Eva (Senta Berger), bitterly accuses him of being afraid of what he would be without the war.

Among the many fine supporting performances, James Mason plays the war-weary Colonel Brandt.  He sees the immorality and futility of German war aims, but his sense of honour and duty about the prevailing struggle makes ceasing to fight unthinkable.  David Warner plays Brandt's out-of-place and out-of-time adjutant, Captain Kiesel, who represents to his colonel the hope that a more enlightened postwar Germany might arise from the ashes of inevitable defeat.

War movie buffs irritated by the technical inaccuracies common in many examples of the genre will find some satisfaction in attention to authenticity of weaponry.  A range of genuine WWII German and Russian small arms appears.  The T 34/85 tanks are real, although the very picky might argue that this is at least six months premature, and that for the summer of '43 they should be T 34/76.  Tactics at times deviate from the textbooks, but this is a drama, not a combat manual.

Cross Of Iron is a five-star movie.  The Hen's Tooth Video release was a two-star DVD, with sub-standard picture and sound.  It was worth owning only while this great film of a great American director lacked the high quality collectors' edition Zone 1 DVD release it deserves, or the far superior European DVD and Blu-ray releases it later received.

Update in September 2011: It appears that only the DVD and Blu-ray releases of this film for the European market - notably those published by Studio Canal - are good quality transfers, as well as being in the original widescreen aspect ratio. Studio Canal's Blu-ray release (encoded for Region B only) is significantly better even than their DVD. It shows so much more detail compared to the DVD releases, for example, that the lettering and designs of German military awards like the Krim and Kuban Shield shoulder insignia can be seen clearly on screen, and wine and beer bottle labels are easily read. The Blu-ray is available from Amazon.co.uk, but can be played only on Region B-capable Blu-ray decks. Extras on this Blu-ray include a gem, a documentary by Mike Siegel called ""Passion & Poetry - Sam Peckinpah's War"". This gives fascinating insight into the making of ""Cross of Iron"" and Peckinpah's directorial style through contemporary and later interviews with James Coburn, David Warner, Senta Berger, Maximilian Schell, Roger Fritz, Vadim Glowna, Katy Haber and Peckinpah himself. It includes a shot of Peckinpah reminiscing proudly about receiving a telegram from Orson Welles saying it was 'one of the finest war films ever made'.

I found the Cross of Iron to be an exceptional film in spite of the poor visual quality of the DVD compared to digitally remastered movies.

What I found most enjoyable about the film was that it avoided most of the Hollywood conventions that are expected in a war film.  No sappy odes to patriotism, no sentimental scenes or inappropriate romance.  Cross of Iron dealt with war in an honest, brutal and nasty way.  This movie bests the overrated Saving Private Ryan (even with the 20 minutes at Omaha Beach.)
Someone pointed out that this movie perpetuates the myth of the ""good"" Werchmacht and ""bad"" SS.  They're right and wrong.  They right by saying the Werchmacht were involved in a lot of massacres.  But they're wrong because not every German soldier (even SS) was a Non-Aryan hating, raper of women and eater of children.

Coburn is pretty good as Sgt Steiner, and there are plenty of great battle scenes and hordes of Russians and T-34 tanks galore. The squad of Germans under Coburn represent a good selection of crusty and tough-looking soldiers.

James Coburn is not unconvincing as a German army sergeant, but his antagonist, Maximillian Schell, who plays a German captain obsessed with earning the iron cross medal, seems to be a bit of a straw man. His only motive is to be awarded the medal regardless of the consequences and whether he actually earns it or not. There's little depth beyond that.
There are some scenes that seem to be shoehorned in just for the sake of having them there. The hospital scene and the Russian women's barracks scenes come to mind. Peckinpah has never done romance well. In fact, he doesn't do women well. Much as they are in The Wild Bunch, the women in Cross of Iron are little more than tramps, there to sexually entice, tempt or please our male protagonists.
As hard as the movie tries to show the desolation of the Eastern Front, from all accounts I've read it was much worse than this movie portrayed it. You never get a sense of what the Germans are trying to accomplish here until they begin their retreat.
The war scenes are passable, but it's hard to go back an enjoy a mediocre war movie once you've seen modern classics like Saving Private Ryan, Stalingrad, or Black Hawk Down. Peckinpah's use of slow motion and gratuitious gore has become passe compared with the in-your-face realism of today's war movies.",1012953600,4,1448,4.573076923076923

969750,4,6305082448,"Cross of Iron introduces the viewer to WW2 from a seldom seen perspective -- that of the German foot soldier. We in America are accustomed to seeing the noble G.I. as the hero, but here the protagonist is a German noncom. The scene is the Eastern Front, the enemy Russian.
The main thrust of the story is the conflict between the seasoned, no-nonsense veteran sergeant and the Prussian aristocrat captain who is placed in command of his company. The sergeant has previously distinguished himself in battle, thereby earning the coveted Iron Cross, an award which the captain likewise aspires to receive. The officer, however, instead of earning his medal through gallantry, seeks to obtain one through deceit, manipulation, betrayal and murder.
Sam Peckinpah does a fairly good job of portraying some of the ""grit"" of infantry combat. The characters in Sgt. Steiner's platoon are interesting and sometimes humorous, for example, Cpl. Kreuger, who genuinely believes that the benefit of all the accumulated filth on his skin is to make him waterproof. Several of the action sequences are particularly well done, including several instances where the director cuts to slow motion for additional dramatic effect.  The sight of a Russian ""human wave"" charge is unforgettable.
Although there are elements of the story line which have almost a ""soap opera"" feel to them, this is generally good story, if somewhat contrived. There are also some aspects which speak to the viewer on a very human emotional level.  Overall, if you're a fan of war movies, you will probably enjoy this movie.

Visually the film is a stunner, particularly when the Red Army attacks with waves of infantry supported by T34 tanks. The uniforms, equipment, entrenchments, etc. all look accurate. Unfortunately, there are a couple of things I can't get past that detract from the film. First and formost is James Coburn as Corporal Steiner. As an old, grey, wrinkled man he might be more convincing playing a soldier in the volkssturm (home guard)defending Berlin in 1945. Is this the only American star this Anglo-German production could get? Secondly is the hair. Most of the German soldiers look like former extras from the musical Hair. Yes, a lot of German soldiers in the field had longer hair on top but they kept it close-cropped on the sides. The ""defeatist"" Regimental Adjutant, Captain Keisler, looks like Shaggy from Scooby-Doo. The overgrown, unkempt hair just screams 1970's and has no ""period"" feel to it.

The acting is mostly first rate, especially by Maximilian Schell, but the rumoured heavy editing for this flick is evident.
The DVD transfer is atrocious in all areas, but is most noticeable with the sound.  This DVD deserves to be cleaned up and remastered.  Some of those explosions just don't feel right with a hollow boom sound, especially since Peckinpah so wonderfully captured many of the explosions with debris flying toward the camera.  You really want to feel the movie, but unfortunately cannot.  Much of the fault lies in Hen's Tooth (the distrbutor), but who knows what condition the original film is in.

I also think too much credit is given to the Russian Army in defeating Germany, you might as well say those on the western front just played bingo while the Russians won the war! Both the Germans and the Japanese were formidible opponents,they just didn't lay down easy. I am a peacetime military veteran, but today I think wars are waged to give people something to do, hold people down long enough,i.e.deny them food,heating oil,and other necessities and they will rise up and fight for it-wars!

969836,5,6305082448,"This movie is one of my favorites. Yes, it's little known, and yes, the DVD does nothing to improve the sound or image, but this is a great movie. Inevitably, this movie will be compared to Saving Private Ryan. Suprisingly, it holds up extremely favorably. The story, the plot of this movie is much much better. In this movie, death stalks soldiers all of the time, and you die a slow, agonizing, bloody death. Gone are the Saving Private Ryan's cliches (Such as the wimpy medic, the New Yorker, the Heroic Captain, the Jew, and so forth) and it's patriotism. This is war, war in it's most brutal tone. Sergeant Steiner, played by James Coburn, is a tough but disallusioned Sergeant who despises officers and simply wants to keep his men alive. His squad mates are instantly loveable, and they actually have real character. They are not flat cliches, these are real men. There is no way to call this movie a salute to Nazism or anything like that, in fact, it is extremely anti-nazi. The men in the squad are not thinking about Nazism or their great leader, they're trying to keep themselves and their friends alive, as was the actual case. In fact, the SS Special Squad reinforcement that the squad gets is eventually offered to the Russian women to kill. Since you grow so close to the characters, you really get emotional when you see them blown away in Peckinpah's typical balletic slow motion violence. The villan, Captain Stransky, is played brilliantly by Maximillian Schell. Although the slow motion violence is less realistic than Saving Private Ryan, it never the less evokes more emotions. This is one of the best movies about WWII and war in general, and is a must see even for people who think falsely that every German soldier was a horrible Nazi.",995587200,4,1761,4.702265372168285

969840,4,6305082448,"""Cross of Iron"" is a film that has all the makings of a classic war movie. However, it does have one big weakness--the editing! Still, the acting of James Coburn, Maxmillian Schell and James Mason help make this an enjoyable movie that's fun to watch over and over again. CoI has a lot of action and great pyrotechnics and the panzer battle scene in particular is really awesome. However, there are also some surreal scenes which, in my opinion, are a bit too bizarre.
But what really makes this film is the strength of the characters themselves. James Coburn plays the gritty Sgt. Rolf Steiner who has nothing but contempt for his government. Yet, he is intent on fighting and bolstering the spirits of his platoon.
James Mason is the enlightened Colonel Brandt who cuts Steiner a lot of slack. Although Brandt realizes the war is nothing but an effort in futility, he does what he can to keep his men motivated.
Maxmillian Schell is the arrogant and incompetent Captain Stransky who is long on bravado but short on substance. For all his posturing, Stransky is nothing more than a spit and polish aristocratic Prussian officer who wants all the glory of combat but doesn't have the guts to earn it on the battlefield. Stransky is also something of a strange if not comical character. For instance, in one scene, he chastizes his orderly for swatting his pet rat (""STOP THAT! Careful of my JJ...Have it treated correctly).
David Warner is the cynical Captain Keisel who has become numb to the world around him. Like Steiner, he is disenchanted with his government and even ridicules the very army he's fighting with. Although Keisel's senses have become dulled by the non-stop fighting and destruction, he still manages to be insightful. At one point Brandt asks Keisel a rhetorical question, ""What will we do when we lose the war?"" To which Keisel replies, ""Prepare for the next one.""
Though ""Cross of Iron"" does have a few  minor shortcomings, it's too good to pass up. There's a lot to this movie; you'll definitely want to add to your video/DVD collection.",984355200,7,2061,4.773109243697479
969841,5,6305082448,"An impressive film by one of Hollywood's greatest action directors, Sam Peckinpah. This movie is arguably the best war film to come out of the 1970s. The only other film of that decade that comes close in both grit and epic setting is Richard Attenborough's A Bridge Too Far, which was released the following year. Peckinpah deserves praise for being bold enough to tackle this Eastern Front story by author Willi Heinrich. The film is set in 1943 and finds the Germans in slow retreat before the Russians. The opening scene is riveting. A squad of veteran German soldiers led by Sgt. Steiner (James Coburn) infiltrates the Russian forward position and knocks out a fortified mortar battery.  When the squad returns to camp, Steiner meets his new commanding officer, Capt. Stransky (Maximilian Schell). In perhaps the most compelling performance of the film, Schell plays a dishonorable soldier who cares not at all for the safety of his men, but only for his personal glory. Stransky requested to be transferred to the Russian front from France so that he might earn the Iron Cross (medal of valor), which Steiner already has received. The task before Steiner from that point forward in the film is to do his job without getting killed by Stransky's orders.  Although there are some slow moments in the film that show what life was like in the trenches and the scheming of Stransky and his lackeys, there also are several long action sequences in which Steiner and his squad must stand their ground against Russian human-wave attacks and move with stealth behind enemy lines. Although Peckinpah's use of slow-motion action is not used quite as sparingly and with as great effect as director Akira Kurosawa in Seven Samurai, it is nevertheless a useful stylistic enhancement for this movie and war movies in general.  I believe this film ranks among the best war films ever made and can hold its own alongside Apocalypse Now, Platoon and Saving Private Ryan.

The Russian front was one of the most degrading, dehumanising conflagrations in the entire history of warfare. As with any campaign of racial extermination, the depridations and abominations perpetrated by both sides driven by equally uncompromising ideologies (the Germans had their SS, the Russians their NKVD battalians) resulted in unimaginable conditions of cruelty and savagery. Cross of Iron barely even scratches the surface. Far more accurate (though still flawed) is the German language film, 'Stalingrad'.

This film is an anti-war film and it shows us what a battle of attrition on the Eastern Front (about which only a handful were produced in the Western world)is really like. If you want to see and feel the horror of a battle, then this film is the perfect choice. The only film which can be comparable to it is ""Stalingrad""(1992 version).  However, what my comment is really about is that DVD should never have been released at all. I bought this DVD so as to replace my worn out Vhs version of the same film which I bought 13 years ago and, hopefully, to find some interesting special features from it. However,the picture quality of this DVD is a true disappointment, there is no question about that. It is no better than my worn out Vhs film. Besides, it is not the wide screen version as I expected.

As a WWII buff, I had read many books and seen many war films, and Cross of Iron (the movie) was one of the more satisfying (and horrifying!) accounts of the war.
Sam Peckinpah's directing is superb in this film. Coburn's Sergeant Steiner, who is just trying to survive and keep alive the men who follow him, versus the incompetent Captain Stransky (Maximillian Schell) who is on the Eastern Front only because he wants to win the Iron Cross, Germany's military award for valor in combat - makes for a very tense atmosphere throughout the movie. The viewer ultimately sides with Coburn's character, and can't help but feel outrage when Stransky deliberately tries to hang Steiner's men out to dry as the order to retreat is given, and Stransky does not pass along the order to Steiner.
The battle scenes were magnificent, the best I had seen until ""Saving Private Ryan"" came along. You got a glimpse of the sheer terror the German soldiers must have felt when facing one of the Russians' human wave charges. The T-34 tanks used by the Russians appear authentic, unlike the substitutes used in many war films (see: Battle of the Bulge). This film is a must-see for anyone interested in WW2. It is unfortunate that so few films were made about the Russian Front. The Soviet Union did more to bring down the Nazi regime than the rest of the Allies combined. 90 percent of all battle casualties suffered by the Germans in the war happened on the Russian Front.
The part of the movie that really grabbed me, however, was the beginning. While German children sing a song to the tune of ""Lightly Row, Sweetly Row"", images are shown of battle, death and the Holocaust - a wrenching juxtaposition of childhood innocence and the horrifying extents of man's inhumanity to man.",976665600,26,1908,4.64792899408284

969937,5,6305082448,"Sam Peckinpah's CROSS OF IRON is a masterpiece, in my opinion the last great movie of this american director. Set in 1943, during the retreat of Russia, the movie depicts the life of a german platoon led by James Coburn. Maximilian Schell is an aristocratic Prussian led by ambition into the russian hell ; he wants to obtain the cross of iron but hasn't the guts to deserve it. The camp is commanded by a disillusioned James Mason and an alcoholic David Warner.
The movie will not change Sam Peckinpah's reputation of misogyny, Senta Berger plays an anecdotical part only and the other women (russian) involved don't respect at all the code of honor so praised by Sam Peckinpah. CROSS OF IRON is a movie of men, celebrating the friendship born in the battlefields without distinction of classes. The wild bunch of James Coburn's comrades forms a group of men ready to die for each other.
The screenplay is very original and lets Sam Peckinpah develop his usual themes. The style of the movie is also remarkable. During the opening credits, Peckinpah, using a very smart editing, presents the usual black and white footage involving Hitler and the images we have already seen a million times in other movies, then mixing a documentary in color about Hitler and the beginning of CROSS OF IRON. The effect is guaranteed and gives to the action of the movie a kind of seal of authenticity.
You will also admire how Sam Peckinpah, with only two or three tanks, a lot of dynamite and an admirable editing, can create in the audience the feeling that he had a US$ 60 millions budget to spend.

When I first saw this film  in a theater, the effect of the battle scenes was quite shocking, leaving  me trembling as I left the building. James Coburn, a Peckinpah favorite, is  the center of the film - a hard, embittered veteran who sees only disaster  and collapse ahead for his Fatherland.  He is offset by Maximilian Schell,  playing an effete officer with deluded visions of glory for the Reich -  most particularly with personal decorations won in battle, the Iron Cross  being the most sought-after.  The Eastern Front was easily the most  thankless battleground for Wehrmacht forces - far from home, facing an  enemy without regard for individual hardship.  Any dreams of conquest were  quickly consumed by daily attrition - of materiel, of supplies, and, most  unimportant to Hitler, of fighting men.  Peckinpah relentlessly shows the  pounding shock of combat, the almost careless expense of human lives, and  the ultimate folly of war far more effectively than many more expensive and  publicized movies.

970040,5,6305082448,"Sam Peckinpah has done it again! This is a great movie in its genre. You should be warned, though,  it is as close to realistic war as you are likely to see on the screen, and  it is entirely from the German viewpoint. There are no allied heroes. And  it is entirely devoid of humor.

  James Coburn, as always, does a magnificent job in his role as  Sergeant Steiner, an anti-authoritarian iconoclast who has been awarded the  Iron Cross for heroism, but who could not care less. He is not motivated by  medals. Captain Stransky, however, is. He desperately wants the Iron Cross,  and tries to engineer one by leaning on his troops to lie for him,  including Steiner, who is contemptuous of him, and credit him with the  feats of the late Lieutenant Triebig.

The movie is mostly about  Steiner's attempt to hold his platoon together, and get them to relative  safety.

  James Mason  plays a German general who has a sense of honor, and who recognizes that  they are defeated, and he carries the part very well as might be  expected.

  This is a  movie that you will not soon forget. It is about mud, and death, and fear,  and the cynicism of beaten men struggling to stay alive, and the brutality  of a war fought on foreign soil when men lose their humanity.

I  personally prefer a good comedy, but if this is the kind of movie you  prefer as entertainment, then this is probably one of the best you will  ever see.

Coburn does a great job of playing the Wermacht NCO trying to  keep his men alive on the eastern front while dealing with a glory seeking  idiot. Brutal at times, this movie will grip you from the opening scene  till the closing scene. Great score at the begining of the film. I'd love  to get the soundtrack but I cannot find it. Strange seeing a film that has  German soldiers as ""The good guys"" alot like the film Das Boot in  that respect. Top notch, as must for all military film buffs.",954460800,6,647,4.35

970124,1,6305082448,"While I am a big fan of Peckinpah, and feel that this movie was unfairly overlooked for many years, it was almost painful to watch the Hen's Tooth Video DVD version of this film.  The interpositive used in the transfer is  scratched, pitted, and otherwise in very poor shape for much of the film.  The compression rate is terrible, resulting in the worst artifacting I have  yet seen on this format, and to top it all off the video does not even  preserve the film's aspect ratio.
To sum it up: Very compelling movie,  which does feel a bit ""dated"" in some of its techniques (but  funding was also pulled out from under Peckinpah during production, and  this film was made on a very low budget), but the film warrants viewing.  It's merely unfortunate that the video distributor did not give the film  the respect it deserved.

970125,4,6305082448,"This is one of the most powerful World War II movies made, probably because it was based on the fictional (though almost biographical) book of the same name by Willi Heinrich.  While the movie is not an exact retelling  of the book, it does remain truer to its source than most Hollywood  adaptations.  I compare ""Cross of Iron"" to ""All Quiet on the  Western Front"" in their similar message and powerful portrayal of war  being an extreme assault on the humanity of all involved.  I highly  recommend the movie itself but don't know that the DVD version is worth the  extra as it has no widescreen option and the audio on my copy is pretty  low.",950054400,6,645,4.482758620689655

I am not aware of what production problems Sam Peckinpah might have had to face, but he did not do the novel justice. The combat scenes are exciting and  gut-wrenching, as are the use of ""authentic"" weaponry by both  sides, but Peckinpah lost a great opportunity to portray combat on the  Eastern Front as the author intended. Instead, he sold out to Hollywood and  pandered to his film audience. Most ridiculous was the end sequence where  Coburn's Sgt. Steiner (Steiner in the novel was only 25!)banters with his  company commander, Captain Stranssky (Maximillian Schell) as they try to  escape a Russian attack.

970128,5,6305082448,"Most Americans have no idea what the level of ferocity of combat was like on the eastern front. Fully 3/4 of the German Army was kept decisively engaged by the Soviet Army.  This film very graphically displays what was  taking place at the squad and platoon level.  Coburn, and others, did such  a good job of portraying German Wehrmacht soldiers that, unfortunately,  neo-nazis and ultra-rightists in Germany have fastened onto Coburn and this  movie as what they would like to be like as Germans...never realizing most  of these actors were not German.  But this shouldn't be held against this  phenominal movie.  When you view this movie look for the most basic of  reasons as to why men fight when there's no hope of winning -- they depend  on one another simply to just stay alive.  That's the central theme of this  movie.  People in an impossible situation, which they don't believe in,  just trying to live to see tomorrow. This is the most accurate and awesome  movie on combat made.  Saving Private Ryan may be more patriotic and  appealing to Americans, and it is accurate to a degree. But it doesn't  equal Cross of Iron in terms of total accuracy of portrayal.  Definitely  not for children.  If you want to begin to get an idea of why the Russians  and Germans feel the way they do about WWII then most definitely see this  video.",936489600,17,1344,4.641025641025641

But instead of glory, there is fear, death, filth, and hopelesness.  This film clearly shows the true heros. The common foot soldiers that  fought not for Hitler, National Socialism, or Germany, but for each other.  You see them laugh, cry, fight, and die. Sam Peckinpah did great job  showing great detail to uniforms, equipment, weapons, etc. But I think the  best thing he did was NOT to show this as the Nazi army, but as a platoon  of wehrmacht (regular army) soldiers who don't want to be there and would  much rather be at home. There are several scenes where the soldiers show  obvious contempt for ""The Party"". The anti-war message is very  clear and put forth in an unique way.

7883041,3,6305082448,"There's nothing offensively bad about Cross of Iron, but there's a reason you don't hear people talk about it despite its obviously large budget and fairly famous cast.  Set during the Nazi retreat from Russia, James Coburn  as Sergeant Steiner and his war-weary  platoon try to get by despite the fact the Russians are seemingly always on the verge of another offensive, hindered constantly by his unwillingness to help a craven German captain who wants to get a medal without getting his hands dirty.

The film succeeds in a fairly taut, suspenseful story, constant artillery barrages managing to pass on some of the soldiers' stress to the audience by its end.  However, the strange editing leaves too much unsaid in places and lingers too long in others where it would be welcome to move on, like a severely uncomfortable scene involving Steiner's strung out survivors encountering camp full of female Russians.  It goes about like you'd expect.

Every battle is a loud and chaotic mess, where you really can't tell what's going on or who's winning until the movie decides it's time for wooden structures to stop exploding (that's where that big budget went).  It tries for the same kind of unspoken male camaraderie that was featured in the Wild Bunch and doesn't totally fail, but has a generally less memorable cast of characters and the need to ground the fighting in its historical context robs the film of its predecessor's stark simplicity.",1520035200,,1451,4.94238683127572
