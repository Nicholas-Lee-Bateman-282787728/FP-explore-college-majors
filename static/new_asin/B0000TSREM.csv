1945804,4,B0000TSREM,"I also received an advanced pre-order copy via Amazon.  While this set did have the DVD menu glitch on ""Girl Boss Guerilla"", the movie itself played fine. As many have noted, Panik House has really done an awesome job with this DVD box set. The DVD set comes in a bright ""shocking pink"" plastic gatefold style case and has both the linear notes and audio CD holder affixed inside. The  linear notes booklet design was pretty psychedelic but well layed out. The content inside was somewhat hard to read at times but the information was invaluable. I didn't really care much for the audio CD extra although some may find it pretty novel. The movies themselves are a mixed bag.  ""Girl Boss Guerilla"" is definitely the best of the set (it's also the most violent and outrageous of the lot). While ""Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless To Confess"" is my personal favorite, it is also the tamest movie of the bunch with  ""Terrifying Girls' High School: Lynch Law Classroom"" and ""Criminal Woman: Killing Melody"" falling in the middle. The audio commentaries by Chris D. (AKA Chris Desjardins) and the staff at Panik House are quite informative and very good. Fans of Toei Yakuza and 70's sexploitation cinema will find these movies a definite treat. Here's hoping that Panik House releases more great ""Sukeban"" DVD sets in the near future.",1133222400,22,1327,4.807017543859649
1945805,5,B0000TSREM,"there has been some delay with this package, which has been recalled due to errors with one of the discs. the new ship date is Dec 6. i managed to have received mine before this item was pulled from circulation by Panik House. yes, one of the discs does not play, but they will replace it. so, not a big problem.

for fans of this genre, this set is a must. the remastered films all look great. and there are lots of fun extras, and goodies, such as the additional fifth disc, a CD with songs of Reiko Ike.

the packaging is fantastic. definitely one of the cooler, funner designs of any box/multiple set i own.

highly recommended.",1132099200,12,632,4.338983050847458
8002853,5,B0000TSREM,Brilliant! The cd with the exclusive track by Makoto Kawabata (of Acid Mothers Temple) is a nice find.,1495670400,,102,4.722222222222222
8002854,5,B0000TSREM,The reviewers were correct! These movies are super boss! Quite a groovy boatload of charming entertainment for forty bucks! For such low budgets these filmmakers know how to show a panoramic sense of place and maintain a concise pacing. These 70's drive-in biker movies are executed better then most of U.S. movies that were their inspiration. In those females were mainly whores or damsels in distress- if they much screen-time at all. These movies are just damn fun!  And to these reviewers that have seen all of the pinky movies and say they're just trash orso so..get a life or a job or just stick with the inspiring  lessons of Tom Hanks movies.,1490140800,,650,4.743362831858407
8002855,3,B0000TSREM,"IT HAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH SEX, FOR A MOVIE LIKE THIS. MY YOUNG TEENAGER GOT IT FOR CHRISTMAS AND I WAS SURPRISED WHAT WAS ON THERE, SO I HID IT, UNTIL SHE GETS OLDER. SHE THINKS SHE JUST MISPLACED IT!!!",1451347200,,201,3.926829268292683

8002857,5,B0000TSREM,"I had read that Tarantino's films were derivative but never knew the source.  These are like watching slightly more crude Tarantino films.  To me they seem far ahead of their time.  Rather than being exploitative, as I expected, they seem to me all about female empowerment.  Yes, there are naked shots of women but there is context - this is not porn by any means.  The films vary in tone; the first seemed a bit silly, the second ha genuine drama, the third finally developed strong fight scenes (making me wonder if Bruce Lee was influenced by these films).  The bottom line is they were very entertaining and a gem to find.",1396656000,3,627,4.553571428571429
8002858,5,B0000TSREM,"I was really lucky to find this at a DVD exchange store, but after watching all of it I would easily shell out a C-note to buy it new. These films are uber-entertaining, particularly for fans of Quentin Tarintino - who stole a lot from these.

The violence and sexuality are presented in a context that is never grotesque. Compare Kill Bill Volume 1 to, say, Saw or Hostel. Although Kill Bill is gratuitously violent, especially in the final fight sequences, it is so over the top that it's more funny than thrilling. Saw and Hostel, on the other hand, are far from funny and are affecting because they are so grotesquely horrifying.

So if you liked Kill Bill, check these out. On top of being entertaining, they are also a very interesting reflection of the culture of the 60's and 70's which ultimately inspired the themes that are explored.",1345766400,2,844,4.62
8002859,3,B0000TSREM,"not sure about this page as the product description is for the 5 dvd set ""PINKY VIOLENCE"" and not for the film offered, so i'm guessing that is the reason for the crazy price...just in case anyone's confused out there & amazon should fix it...",1296345600,2,243,4.4222222222222225
8002860,5,B0000TSREM,"Panik House has done an outstanding job releasing ""The Pinky Violence Collection"" along with ""Sex & Fury"" and ""Female Yakuza Tale"". This has to be the best box set this year. You get great extra items like an awesome booklet, music cd with Ike Reiko singing, huge sticker and more. These films have been remastered and support anamorphic video for 16:9. There was an issue with my ""Girl Boss Guerrila"" disc, but Panik House replaced it immediately. If you love films like: ""Zero Woman: Red Handcuffs"" (the original), the ""Female Prisoner Scorpion"" films with Kaji Meiko, ""Lady Snowblood"", ""Gate of Flesh"", the ""Stray Cat Rock"" films and ""School of the Holy Beast"", then you will LOVE The Pinky Violence Collection. Ike Reiko and Sugimoto Miki are absolutely GORGEOUS and I bet they still are, just like Kaji Meiko still is. Not to mention, the over the top Yoko Mihara makes some appearences as well. It doesn't get any better than this, trust me. MUST BUY!!! MUST BUY!!! MUST BUY!!!",1153267200,11,983,4.822485207100592
8002861,5,B0000TSREM,"Wow,what a package Panik House put together for this release!

All four transfers look stunning,with eye-popping colors. The audio cd is a particularly ""fun"" supplemental one doesnt usually encounter with DVD's - my wife thought I had on a porno with all the moanin' & groanin' leaking outta the speakers! According to the liner notes,this recording is quite rare so this inclusion alone may be worth the price tag for some!

The enclosed notes/booklet is sharp,with many rare stills and a nice introduction to this particular film genre that I suspect many Westerners (like myself) have had very limited exposure too.

These films are pure trash (and i loved every single minute!) -

dont wait until it's too late!!",1137888000,14,716,4.991596638655462
8002862,5,B0000TSREM,"Just the packaging alone makes this box set worthwhile. I've never seen anything like it. The exterior is like a Trapper Keeper, slick plastic that's kind of puffy and soft to the touch. It then folds out into four DVD trays and has a really well designed booklet, talking about the films and the genre (Sukeban). I just got my copy and everyone that's been over and seen it has flipped out about the box, `cause it just looks so cool (and is so pink). The bonus CD of Reiko Ike singing is mounted in with the booklet and is weird and kind of a novelty. I put it on at a party a couple of weeks ago and people were way into it.

The movies are cool too. ""Criminal Woman: Killing Melody"" is my favorite, but the end of ""Delinquent Girl Boss: Worthless to Confess"" is amazing. There's no way that Quentin Tarintino didn't see it before he made ""Kill Bill"".

I just read on the website of the company that put out the set (Panik House) that they pre-sold 2/3 of the run of 10,000 and they think they're going to sell out soon, so if you're at all interested in getting a copy of this you should. Now. It was totally worth the money.",1134000000,15,1129,4.1981566820276495
