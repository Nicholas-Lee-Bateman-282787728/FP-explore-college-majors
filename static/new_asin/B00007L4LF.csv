7977689,4,B00007L4LF,"Bit Cloud is a wandering junk parts dealer. He collects parts to build the ultimate Zoid partner. One day he meets a group of Zoid warriors and a Zoid called Liger Zero. He joins their team and begins to fight with them in organized Zoid competitions. Even though these competitions are a friendly sport, there are dubious people that use Zoids to gain power and strike fear into others. Bit, Liger Zero, and his teammates are on the front lines of that battle.

This is a pretty good series. It's nowhere near as good as Zoids Chaotic Century, but it's a lot of sun and very entertaining. There are some very compelling characters and awesome battle scenes. The animation, and voice acting are a bit better than average. You should recognize Bit Cloud's voice actor as Richard Cox, the same guy that played Inuyasha. The story is a little weak and not very deep, but it's okay. The series is fun and is definitely worth watching. As I mentioned before, Chaotic Century is way better. The problem is that it's out of print and very rare. You could easily spend over $700 on the complete series. I suggest checking this one out first. If you like this series and don't mind opening your wallet, Chaotic Century will provide more enjoyment than this spinoff.",1354838400,,1256,4.632286995515695
7977690,4,B00007L4LF,"While I think the show overall is pretty lame the last volume has some good lasts eps. The Berserk Fury is just a great design. The battle with it and the Liger Zero is great.
The story is still pretty dull(a little better though), but the last battle has such a great mecha battle I have to reccomend those episodes.
Zoids Zero is pretty much like Star Wars: Attack of the Clones, the story sucks but the end is so fun to watch.
If you want a really good anime and don't care for brainless mecha battles go get the other Zoids called Chaotic Century.",1074038400,5,551,4.257142857142857
