8402549,3,B003QTDI6U,"My cat did not find this video entertaining.  The camera work is mediocre and very limited....it only focuses on a bird feeder.

Not much 'bird action' recorded.  As a human, I found it boring as well.

I prefer the Mewwie -- Backyard Buffet video....a much larger array of critters are showcased.",1477008000,,297,4.764705882352941
8402550,1,B003QTDI6U,"I love that my cat adores this series, so it pains me to say they really fell down on this one. It's one short clip of hummingbirds that they loop with different cheesy special effects (think when camcorders started offering special effects).",1468368000,,242,4.785714285714286
8402551,2,B003QTDI6U,"This holds our cat's attention for no more than a few minutes, then she gets agitated until we turn it off.  I'm guessing there isn't enough variation in the ""activity"" or ""setting"" to hold her attention, at least not compared to the ""Happy Cat TV"" DVD she likes.",1451088000,,263,4.479166666666667
8402552,1,B003QTDI6U,"The idea is sound and the noises certainly intrigued our cats, but the production quality is so bad you won't be able to stay within earshot of the TV. The two looped videos are reminiscent of computer screen savers from 20+ years ago. There was definitely a lot more time spent making the artwork for the dvd case then there was in producing the 'video'. I really cannot believe anyone associated with this would want their names credited, it's that bad.",1348531200,6,455,4.62962962962963
