5553589,5,B00B2TU5R6,This anime was just what I expected. Good.,1414800000,2,42,4.375
5553590,4,B00B2TU5R6,"I really love the manga and thought I'd give the anime a try. I did enjoy it a lot, but some of the background music was too sappy for what was going on.  And Haruka's pink hair and purple eyes seemed too cartoonish for the subject matter.  Should have stayed with her look in the manga.  The female villain was cheezy looking compared to manga version (which was more of a seductress), but it also gave her a more psycho vibe.

The animation was pretty good and the overall product was very enjoyable.  Yakumo is my main reason for liking this series, and Goto gave me some laughs as well.  I do wish they would have done more episodes, and expounded more on Yakumo's father.  This series had a lot of potential.",1408579200,2,713,4.356060606060606
5553591,4,B00B2TU5R6,I rather liked the show though I am finding that it is different from the manga. It's interesting and a little bit different from what I usually watch.,1403049600,,151,4.428571428571429
5553592,5,B00B2TU5R6,it was awesome  loved the art the music the story and it arrived quickly i would recomend it to anyone,1389657600,,102,4.1
5553593,5,B00B2TU5R6,this is one of the best animes I watched in a long time.please watch you will not be disappointed enjoy,1382486400,,103,4.2
5553594,4,B00B2TU5R6,I really wanted to like this anime. Great central character and intriguing plot but all feel apart in last episodes because the stakes weren't high enough and Yakumo figured everything out too easily. A wasted trip!,1372377600,,215,5.0
5553595,4,B00B2TU5R6,"There's nothing really hidden or ground breaking about this series.  It's pretty straight forward. Saito can see the spirits of the dead.  He can't purify them, but he can speak to them.  Overall, you think Ghost Hunt (Same idea with a protagonist, and young woman duo) and sprinkle in some more action.  There are actual antagonists instead of a vague ""fighting spirits"" or evil concepts.
However, the series doesn't have a streaming license and Sentai Filmworks is the only studio with a license for it in the states.  Which because of the limited nature of it, makes it one I would pick up.  Even if you try and get around not being a a supporter of companies importing great Anime, the fansubs have only been in 480 res for the most part, and it would behoove you to pick it up just for a decent 720 res.
Like the previous review states.  There is no English dub.  Most Anime purchasers in the States should be familiar with the market to know most of the companies in the business aren't producing English dubs unless on hugely successful series.
That said, if you're a collector, I'd pick up this series.",1368230400,9,1110,4.570707070707071
5553596,1,B00B2TU5R6,"I'm sure this was a great anime, but it wasn't what I purchased. It originally stated ""Audio: English"" and if you look at the audio information when you insert the DVDs it will offer ""Audio: English or None"" and ""Subtitles: English or None"". So I can see how this mistake was made. However, I made my purchase according to the information provided.",1367452800,3,348,4.629032258064516

8561736,5,B00B2TU5R6,"I was very impressed and surprised by how much I enjoy this series. A difficult genre from what I usually watch , but i'm glad I got it.",1495497600,,136,3.892857142857143
8561737,5,B00B2TU5R6,"Really enjoyable anime, I love the main character. He seems grumpy and surly but underneath is a kind person that doesn't want to see others get hurt so helps whenever he can. A tragic backstory of the childhood of Yakumo but he overcomes it in the end. Lots of other interesting characters, I've watched this numerous times and never get tired of it.",1493424000,,351,4.587301587301587
8561738,5,B00B2TU5R6,I love the anime and its really good I love listening to the Japanese voices with english subtitles.,1479772800,,100,4.611111111111111
8561739,3,B00B2TU5R6,"I picked this DVD collection up at my local library and rented it. If I'd paid for it I'd be mad. If you are looking for a horror anime with the psychological punch of a Death Note or Paranoia Agent this is not it. This is  more maudlin than thrilling, a limping detective narrative spiced with apparently unintentional elements of rom-com. The dialogue is awkward and melodramatic even by anime standards. And the plot despite it's initial promise is lame and predictable. Psychic Detective Yakumo is a psyhological thriller without any thrills. It's pretty clear who done it within 3 minutes of the opening song the rest of each episode is spent watching the rather dimwitted characters catch up.
On the bright side the art is fantastic. If only the writers had worked as hard. It's also probably also worth 1 star that the the Japanese VA's seem to be talking abnormally slowly, so if you're trying to pick up Japanese this series may have value for you for that reason.",1473206400,,973,4.690058479532164
8561740,5,B00B2TU5R6,Both the artwork and story was great. It show the journey of a young man who has a gift. And show how he deal with it.,1452729600,,118,3.576923076923077
