8146567,5,B000IOM0Q0,"You may of read one of my reviews for other Bull Riding Dvd's . I am kind of a new fan . I just started attending rodeos less than 3 years ago . ( I live in the burbs of Philly Pa.-- not too many chances to attend a bull riding event - or plain ol' rodeo 'round these parts ) . But I did find one -- located in New Jersey 'bout 30 minutes from where I live . It is called COWTOWN . They are only open on weekends beginning in May  , and runs till the end of September . I try to get out there as often as I can . --- Anyway - this dvd is great !! I don't want to get into it too much because I don't want to ruin the ending . ( hahahahaha )",1393372800,,640,3.4444444444444446
