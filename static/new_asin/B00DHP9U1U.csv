5813598,5,B00DHP9U1U,As an archery and Aikido instructor this is a fantastic video on the subject of Kyudo. This is a must watch for anyone that wants to know more about Kyudo.  The video is well rounded and covers the subject so that everyone will learn from watching even if you are already familiar with Kyudo.,1419897600,3,292,4.407407407407407
5813599,5,B00DHP9U1U,"A very unique documentary. Purchased from their web-page, no troubles with the downloads.",1405987200,,89,5.923076923076923
5813600,1,B00DHP9U1U,"This one-of-a-kind documentary looks very good. However, think twice about renting at the Empty Mind Films website. I have no trouble streaming HD videos from Amazon and other places, but their servers (apparently) are not powerful enough to allow realistic viewing. If you try to let the video pre-load (a process that, quite literally, takes all day) you receive an error message after two minutes of viewing which erases all that you have pre-loaded. I experienced this six times. When I wrote for assistant, I was told I was ""warned"" of this state of affairs--referring presumably to a one sentence blurb buried in the FAQ section that says slower connection speeds may experience some difficulties in buffering. Perhaps they mean well, but my experience was an exercise in frustration.",1404086400,,790,5.131782945736434
5813601,5,B00DHP9U1U,"As a lifelong archer and now professional coach, this was thoroughly enjoyable.  The film delivers an in-depth view inside the roots of traditional Japanese archery.  The film does a wonderful job of seeing the process from the archer's perspective. It may be a bit hard to follow as the narrative is in Japanese with English subtitles.  The subtitle text is white and hard to see in many scenes.  But, to my knowlege this is the only film of its kind.  Definitley worht viewing several times!  I am eager to buy the other titles from Empty Mind films!",1382054400,4,552,4.639175257731959

8593339,4,B00DHP9U1U,"It is a John Braely doco so as with all other martial arts DVD's is well worth the having.
Not a disc to learn how to fire a bow and arrow but the essential ingredient is to send the rest of your life philosophically 'shooting yourself'.
In other words hitting the bullseye is not important but just one of the factors in self improvement in posture, actions, stance and tradition as one 'Dances the ceremony"".
A good disc to go with Eugene Herrigel's book Zen and the Art of Archery.

8593342,5,B00DHP9U1U,An excellent documentary of the rewarding experience that can be realized by pursuing the true meaning of Kyudo - which involves more than just hitting a target.,1457049600,,161,5.0

8593344,5,B00DHP9U1U,This film reveals the deeper spiritual intentions of a school that teaches its students the art of archery. At first the students are trying to win the game and impress their teachers but through their practice they realize that their own heart is the target and love is the arrow. Beautiful!,1441670400,,292,4.745098039215686
8593345,5,B00DHP9U1U,"Presents its matter without compromise, and, I would think, honestly.  This is particularly well suited for those who may not know how deep their interest in this particular discipline is.  Well photographed.",1432598400,,208,5.46875
