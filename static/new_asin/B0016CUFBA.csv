8262196,5,B0016CUFBA,"Fans of New York City, the Empire State Building, Art Deco and early 20th century culture should put Manhattan Tower High on their list of movies to see.  It is a fascinating glimpse into big business and office politics as they existed in the early 1930's.  Also interesting are the many glimpses of the technology of the period as they apply to offices in a skyscraper.

The acting is extremely good, characters believable, and the sound-quality very acceptable!",1388448000,,464,4.923076923076923
8262197,3,B0016CUFBA,"Released in 1932, MANHATTAN TOWER came out only one year after completion of the Empire State Building, which is the setting for this film. The building figures prominently in the story and is showcased in several impressive shots, so that in effect, it becomes the major character. It is never referred to as ""The Empire State Building""; instead it is given the generalized term, ""Manhattan Tower"", most likely because the low budget studio couldn't get clearance to use the actual name, or they didn't want the identification to be so specific.

In a compact running time of 65 minutes, the film successfully puts across the story of an executive's corrupt business tactics and their effect on those in his sphere. Things become further complicated when a financial crisis causes a run on the tower's bank.

Directed by poverty row ace Frank Strayer, and starring an array of dependable, early '30's stars including Mary Brian and James Hall, MANHATTAN TOWER is a briskly paced, interesting look at what was then a very contemporary depiction of the goings on in a skyscraper during the Great Depression.

The print quality of this DVD-R is surprisingly good, given the obscurity of this title, with clear sound reproduction. An unjustly forgotten little gem, MANHATTAN TOWER is worth a look, both as fun pre-code entertainment as well as an historical tip of the hat to the Empire State Building.",1292457600,4,1399,4.9957081545064375
8262198,2,B0016CUFBA,"Print material used for this 1932 film was apparently fine but the digital transfer is full of shimmy and motion blur. I would not purchase any further DVDs from this distributor. As for the film itself, it is a grade-C production with very poor script/direction/acting and is of interest only for shots of newly-built Empire State Building.",1244678400,,341,5.0
