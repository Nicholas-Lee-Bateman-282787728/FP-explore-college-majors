8366215,5,B002DWW678,Kinda goofy and very low budget...but I loved it anyway!  Phil Lewis did pretty well for a first time actor.  I guess all those music videos were good practice.,1503360000,,160,4.482758620689655
8366216,3,B002DWW678,It was alright.  I really did expect more since Phil was in the movie.  I almost shut it off as the very beginning is more like someone took their own camera on a cell phone and shot a home video or something.  It is almost like a documentary - like film.  Seems very cheaply made.,1461628800,,281,4.054545454545455
8366217,5,B002DWW678,I heard of this movie so I found it bought it,1412380800,,45,3.1818181818181817
8366218,4,B002DWW678,"I enjoyed this movie.  I rented it solely because L.A. Guns singer Phil Lewis played the part of the evil Dr. Gorgon but ended up buying the dvd shortly thereafter.  Phil certainly stole the show and made his presence known just as he does on the stage!  The film as a whole has a very avante garde feel to it.  It's rather odd at times yet charming.  The production is not like you would expect with a Hollywood blockbuster, but that is part of the charm.  There is a lot of dark humor as well.  I enjoyed it and still watch it from time to time.",1353801600,,547,4.10377358490566
8366219,4,B002DWW678,"Jim Haggerty's Witchmaster General is a hugely entertaining film from the writer-director of The Slasher, I Dream of Dracula, and Grave Danger.  As with his previous films, Haggerty creates a satisfying blend of horror and comedy with witty dialogue and, yes, pleasant images of the female form.  Witchmaster focuses on evil witch doctor-for-hire Phineas Gorgon, who will grant his ""customers"" their darkest wishes but will extract a considerable price for doing so.  The movie features a street-smart detective (well-played by Vic Martino, who previously starred on The Sopranos) and an eccentric medical examiner who join forces to try and stop Gorgon's diabolical reign of terror.  While the acting is strong throughout, the standout performance belongs to LA Guns singer Phil Lewis as Dr. Gorgon, a case of truly inspired casting.  Lewis's Gorgon is a charismatic villain whom the viewer is simultaneously drawn to and terrified of, making him, perhaps, Haggerty's most interesting character.  Haggerty is an adept filmmaker and storyteller, and he clearly is in command of his material and keeps Witchmaster well-paced and unpredictable, cleverly avoiding standard horror-movie cliches.

I highly recommend this very entertaining movie.  Don't miss it!",1250121600,5,1257,5.578947368421052
8366220,5,B002DWW678,"Anyone that knows me knows that there are 2 things I love - schlocky B-movies and 80's metal. So when I learned that Phil Lewis - the original and BEST singer from 80's glam metal icons L.A. Guns was in a crazy low-budget B-movie...let's just say I got that 'special feeling'.

Phil is this weirdo witchdoctor who uses ordinary looking toys and trinkets to control people's destiny and put curses on them. It's all very tounge in cheek in an old haunted house sort of way, but this movie certainly has one or two creepy moments (the drowning scene stuck with me).

And hot on the trail is a cop played by Vic Marino of 'The Sopranos'. I never really watched 'The Sopranos' but this guy was great. He had enough snappy one-liners to keep me laughing throughout. And he's surrounded by some really hot babes - most notably the GREAT Suzi Lorraine who is always good in everything and Colleen Marie who's a Playboy Playmate. Colleen is really good too - I was kind of expecting the ditzy blonde bimbo but she has a real cool presence and she's a spunky brunette.

I have to say most of my interest was in Phil, but even without Phil I would have enjoyed it. And to prove that point I got the second movie these folks made (without Phil) which is called ""Grave Danger"" and I liked that too. It has a lot of the same people and the same writer/director (Jim Hagerty). Both movies are fun and are good as a Friday night double feature.

The only real drawback is I thought there would be some music from Phil or L.A. Guns on the soundtrack, but I guess Phil was trying to distance himself from the music stuff since it was his first movie.

This has been available for awhile (and actually cheaper) at the Yellow Ape website but I guess now it's being officially released. Don't know if there will be any new extras on this one. The disc I have has some funny bloopers and interviews and stuff and is pretty nice (some Hollywood movies don't even give you any extras).

Overall, thumbs up all around. I say Phil in ""Witchmaster General"" is worthy of other great rock star horror B-movies like Alice Cooper in ""Monster Dog,"" Ozzy Osbourne and Gene Simmons in ""Trick or Treat,"" Carmine Appice in ""Black Roses"" and - dare I say - ""KISS Meets the Phantom of the Park""!",1250035200,4,2258,4.415865384615385
8366221,5,B002DWW678,"I enjoyed this film.  It had all the fun of a romp.

Phil Lewis was very good for his first outing.  He played the sinister doctor with aplomb.  Vic Martino was also quite good.  I loved his scene chewing.

Good harmless fun for all.",1250035200,2,233,4.181818181818182
