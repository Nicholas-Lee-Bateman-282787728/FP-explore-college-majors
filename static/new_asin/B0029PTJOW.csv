8612410,4,B0029PTJOW,"Nice little documentary on vintage cars racing at Spa through the eyes of the Aston Martin team. Good behind the scenes action, although the on-board footage seems a bit brief. A fun look at some really great vintage cars and the viewpoints of the drivers and mechanics. Spawned the whole GT Racer series so if you love that, you need this one. Really enjoyed it.",1294012800,2,363,4.6

Witnessing an Aston from the 3rd person perspective is indeed exciting, but common; seeing one and hearing it from the inside is what you get in the new documentary by Alexander Davides, Shaken & Stirred: Racing Classic Astons at Spa.

Davidis's story starts with a bang: with an initial shot that places you firmly in the passenger seat of a green, 1960 DB4GT, racing on the famous Belgian track in September, 2006.  After this you'll experience a foot-through-the-living-room-carpet spinout, feel the tension of a team facing the prospect of not completing the race, only to leap into action to repair the crash damage-- and finally see the cars sink into night  pelted by rain before the vintage endurance race ends and the crowd cheers.

With no narration, and only a few superimposed titles, the racing-neophyte (or even Aston Martin greenhorn) will be entertained by thrilling visuals from the cockpit, and can marvel at the seemingly unworkable repairs that these classic cars endure in pit-lane.  The seasoned among us will of course see details ranging from the nuances of the track at Francorchamps, to the differences between how those cars first rolled around when they were brand-new, in comparison to the improved suspensions and other racing-modifications that are visible in both scenes as the cars zoom past on the start -finish straight, and with close-ups from the pit lane.

All the action in Shaken & Stirred takes place on a single day at the track and is completely focused on two tremendous cars, six drivers, and their crew - and the viewer gets to observe it all as if we had just been invited to come along with our ""hot pit"" passes and hang out. We overhear the teams discussing strategy, repairs-- and complaints of the driver's ears ringing after being in the car for hours. There's no artificial tension, no F1 commentary, and virtually no discussion about the other cars in the race. It's simply about the experience of racing this vintage Aston in the present day.

And as we watch it all, we hear both the electonica of the contemporary artist Depeche Mode and sixties-retro-samba cover songs from Nouvelle Vague bridging both modernity and a bygone era - which is precisely what happened on that race day.

Shaken & Stirred: Racing Classic Astons at Spa may provide racers (and will certainly provide non-racers) a fun way to quell the difficulty of, as Steve McQueen put it, ""waiting"".",1268265600,4,2680,4.859649122807017
