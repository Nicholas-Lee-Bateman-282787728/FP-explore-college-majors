984351,4,6305189382,"A long over-looked suspence thriller by the once highly esteemed Douglas Sirk  - his films of the fifties were better known - i.e. MAGNIFICENT OBSESSION & IMITATION OF LIFE, et. al.  I just recently viewed this film last week and now realise my previous review didn't do it justice. Lucy gave  a surprisingly good dramatic performance as an American taxi-dancer working in London.  La Ball helps the police catch a madman who's out on the loose by posing as a decoy!  Lucy co-stars with the elegantly sinister George Sanders and Charles Coburn is super in his offbeat role as Inspecter Temple.  George Sanders (as a trivia note, Lucy and Sanders supposedly had a brief affair during this time) is  exceedingly suave as Robert Fleming, Sandra's protective nightclub owner boyfriend.  Ball, who had already appeared in dozens of films by this time, displays the inimitable spark which she would ignite into dynamite four years later doing I LOVE LUCY.  The supporting cast is quite good : Boris Karloff, Sir Cedric Hardwicke and George Zucco. Our Lucyball even gets to sing! (alas, she is dubbed by Annette Warren).",958608000,4,1113,4.940860215053763
984352,5,6305189382,"In 1947 Lucille Ball didn't have a studio home from which to make movies. She had just left MGM due to the lackluster treatment she had been subjected to during her stay there. So during this period of her film  career she was forced to freelance in order to keep working. The lack of  studio influence on who and what she played allowed her the rare  opportunity to play way out of character from her standard movie roles  which had been dominated by chorus girls and wise-cracking, hard-nosed  secretaries.
First she starred opposite Mark Stevens in the little know  film noir classic ""The Dark Corner"" and after recieving excellent reviews  was given the lead role in ""Lured"" a Douglas Sirk directed murder mystery.  The top-notch cast including Boris Karloff, Cedric Hardwick, George Sanders  and George Zucco are all excellent in supporting roles but make no mistake  about it ""Lured"" is arguably the best film of Lucille Ball's movie career.
It's the story of a stranded American Taxi Dancer in London who helps  Scotland Yard trap a serial killer who lures his victims through the  personal columns. The movie features intricate plot twists, great  atmospheric sets, beautiful gowns and enough red herrings to satisfy the  most avid murder mystery buffs.
Finally, it is a real joy to see Lucille  Ball in a quality film with a real dramatic character to play, acting like  she should have been given these kinds of good roles all along. I highly  recommend this gem.",947635200,46,1473,4.85140562248996

984514,5,6305189382,"I have to admit that I'd never heard of this film until I saw it here on Amazon recently. Lucille Ball and George Sanders made a movie together? And it's directed by Douglas Sirk. This had to be something worth watching. Of course usually when I found a practically unknown film by a noted star there was usually a good reason it was unknown; just one of those occasional misfires. I'm happy to say that this film ranks more as a nice discovery. It never rises above being an evening's entertainment, but that is all it seeks to be. It's basically an English who-done-it and focuses more on mystery than atmosphere. There are enough light and comic moments to keep it from entering the frightening and bleak world of Film Noir. In those terms it's about as Noir as Laura, set mostly in opulent surroundings. (For Lucy in a darker Noir don't miss The Dark Corner).

Lucy is a taxi dancer pressed into service by Scotland Yard to lure a killer of young women out of hiding. One of the women was her best friend at the dance club where they worked. As Sandra Carpenter she is fully up to the task and is quite funny in her reactions to all the lines she gets from men. I love some of these early roles that treat her as the really beautiful woman she was, since later her zany television character erased all that from her character. Charles Coburn is Inspector Harley Temple and they are surrounded by a fine cast of British actors who include Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Alan Mobray, George Zucco (in a rare non-villainous role), Alan Napier and Boris Karloff (in a truly zany cameo as a demented designer). Mobray had appeared in three Sherlock Holmes films though never as Professor Moriarity. Then, of course there's Sanderswith all his charm and mellifluous voice and a true presence in any film.

One of my few complaints about the film is that Sanders is a bit under utilized. He isn't given enough too say, especially when one considers his expert delivery of wit and caustic comments a few years later as Addison DeWitt in All About Eve. Still, he's George Saunders and just being in a scene gives it an extra lift. There are some typical red herrings and it's not really hard to guess the killer, but it's still a very enjoyable film that gives you a number of minor characters and subplots to think about.",1480118400,,2308,4.532374100719425
984515,2,6305189382,"Uneven and overlong film has a miscast Lucille Ball starring as a taxi dancer whose best friend becomes the victim of a serial killer who sends poems to the police the night before he dispatches each of his young and beautiful female victims, although the police have yet to discover a single body.  Lucille Ball's character is recruited by Scotland Yard to try and trap the killer.  Along the way she is pursued by the charming and wealthy Robert Fleming (George Sanders), a nightclub owner who eventually becomes both her fiance and the prime suspect.

Lured would have worked as an hour long B-movie but at 102 minutes feels extremely bloated.  It also doesn't seem to have any idea tonally what kind of film it wants to be.  Lured isn't really a thriller until the last 15 minutes or so--there's very little attempt to generate any real tension until then.  Lured isn't a romantic comedy, although the banter between Lucille Ball and George Sanders occasionally suggests that it is.  Lured isn't a breezy crime film--for much of its length the movie seems completely disinterested in its own serial killer plot, abandoning it for a different criminal conspiracy that Ball's character stumbles upon, which is also ultimately discarded shortly after it is introduced.

It's possible I'm prejudiced against Lucille Ball because of her subsequent fame as a sitcom actress but I simply can't buy her as a serious or even halfway serious actress.  I also honestly don't think she was much of a looker, despite characters in the film frequently referring to how beautiful she is.  She isn't bad looking to be sure, but pretty much any bargain basement starlet working at Monogram studios was more beautiful than she was.  George Sanders, perhaps most famous for playing both The Saint and The Falcon in two different B-movie series is suitably smooth and charming, but his scenes generally drag Lured away from any mooring as a thriller or mystery.  Lucille Ball's character never suspects him until about a minute before he is arrested, and the identity of the real killer is telegraphed so obviously that Sanders' scenes in police custody seem completely pointless.

Director Douglas Sirk who would become famous for his 1950's melodramas clearly hadn't found his niche yet.  He seems to be trying a little bit of everything in Lured--crime drama, mystery, romantic comedy, melodrama--but none of the elements really mesh all that well, making this one a bit of a drag to sit through.

Also, for anyone thinking about watching Lured because of Boris Karloff--despite receiving pretty prominent billing (not to mention being pictured on the video cover) he is in the film for less than 10 minutes as a red herring murder suspect.  I'm not sure what the point of hiring him was if they weren't going to give him anything to do.",1462147200,,2824,4.913684210526315

984608,4,6305189382,"Even though Lucille Ball gets second billing in 1947's LURED behind George Sanders, she's the one who carries this neat little potboiler. As the film opens, a serial killer had already struck to the tune of seven victims. Keeping faith with cinematic tropes, the local constabulary is baffled. Not even those death poems sent to Scotland Yard by the taunting murderer provide a helpful clue. Chief Inspector Temple (Charles Coburn) does his methodical best. But he's been let down by his crew of cryptographers, fingerprint experts, and typewriter analysts. Inspector Temple, shoulders slumping, sums its up: ""There's a homicidal maniac loose somewhere in the vast honeycomb of London, a maniac with a weakness for young, pretty girls.""

Perhaps there's one promising lead. Scotland Yard has determined that the ""Poet Killer"" - so dubbed by the press - is preying on those sweet innocents who've responded to his classified ads in the paper's personal column. What's required is someone to work on the inside of this. The film makes it seem as if, in this era, Scotland Yard lacked female field operatives.

American taxi dancer Sandra Carpenter (Ball) gets involved when her cute dance hall friend abruptly vanishes. When Sandra files a missing persons report, she impresses Inspector Temple with her moxie, street savvy, and keen observational skills. In maybe the film's most preposterous scene, he promptly hires her as an undercover agent assigned specifically to the Poet Killer case. He casually slips her a tiny pistol for the purpose of ""moral support."" He tasks her with responding to a batch of advertisements. What's the stipend for playing bait for Scotland Yard?

LURED isn't quite an A-list picture, so I guess that means it's overchieved. It's a stylish, atmospheric whodunit, never mind that it does away with the source material's Parisian backdrop. Trivia-heads may or may not be keen to know that LURED adapts director Robert Siodmak's 1939 French film noir, PIEGES. And like PIEGES, LURED counterpoints the brooding suspense with lighthearted moments. Lucille Ball is quite excellent in playing the dancer turned sleuth. She brings her usual warm, down-to-earth sensibilities. We know she can wisecrack with the best of them. I mentioned the scene in which Inspector Temple hires Sandra on the spot and how preposterous it is. But there's also a smidge of gratification drawn from that same scene as Temple tests her acuity and Sandra passes with flying colors.

LURED reaps the benefit of a superb supporting cast. Charles Coburn has always been dependable, and he's that again as the Inspector who plods on patiently and, in fact, eventually arrives at an impressive psychological profile of the killer. Boris Karloff has an extended cameo as a psychopathic dress designer. But my favorite old workhorse here is George Zucco who's tapped for the part of the gruff but fatherly policeman dispatched to shadow and safeguard our intrepid taxi dancer.

George Sanders has raised sneery worldweariness to a fine art but, here, he tones down that air of urbane burnout, probably because he's set up as Lucy's romantic lead. He pops up periodically to devastate the ladies with his old world charm and to extend romantic advances towards Lucy. And also to keep him on our list of suspects. Because there's just something about him and that serpent-smooth delivery of dialogue.

In the pursuit of the Poet Killer, our plucky heroine unearths several nefarious plots that have nothing to do with her target. That's how badass she is. LURED demonstrates Lucille Ball's universal appeal, her knack for sliding into any sort of film genre and fitting in seamlessly. LURED won't come up in any discussion about the best movie mysteries. It can't possibly surmount its B-movie stamp or its lurid title. But it's about the craftsmanship and the execution. It's about the really good acting. It's about Lucille Ball's self-assured lead performance and Zucco's nicely playing against type and, shockingly, Sanders' pep in his step and sparkle in his eyes. It's also about Charles Baudelaire and how the killer taps into his works, except Baudelaire may not appreciate being referenced so. Then again, seeing as how the man never shied away from generating controversy, maybe he would've gotten a kick out of it.

But mostly it's about Lucy.",1372550400,2,4346,5.129943502824859

But this is a much better movie on the whole. Better characters you can sympathize with more, a better plot, and a lot of suspense to keep you interested. Nothing bad ever happens on screen. But you always wonder what is going to jump out at you next, even though you know nothing awful will! It is also interesting to watch the cops solve a baffling (at first) case without just sticking all their clues into a computer.

The Boris Karloff scene was fascinating! I am not too familiar with him, but I imagine the creepiness was pretty typical of what you would see in his other movies. It sure was a lot of fun!

I did not care for the love story that was the b-plot of this movie. But it is just as well. That was also pretty typical of what love stories consisted of during this era. Unless the entire movie was about the love story, there was not a lot of substance.

I have the VHS. I noticed many reviewers said the DVD was not a good quality. I converted the video to DVD on my own DVD player, so I suppose I am fine just keeping my own copy, especially if there are no special features.",1353974400,,1420,4.764227642276423
984614,3,6305189382,"Some melodramas try to double as thrillers while others just fall into the film noir melodrama trap and be done with it like the film under review, Douglas Sirk's Lured. Silk was well-known and respected in this melodrama genre but here his wit has failed him in the thriller department and so what he is left with is a so-so boy meets girl (okay man meets woman) drama that has solving some serial killings as a backdrop. In short the film never did decide whether it was serious about solving crime or was a mere send-up on British detective stories.

Here is the plot to give you an idea of why this one didn't work out. A London taxi-dancer (dime-a-dance girl, okay) goes missing, adding her name to a long list of unsolved pretty young and unattached young women who have gone missing and who have the authorities worried and perplexed. Her American friend Sandra, played by Lucille Ball, concerned, gets in touch with the peelers (okay, coppers) and is recruited to act as, well, a lure, as bait to bring out the dastardly guy who is committing all the murder.
And so we are on our way.

Well almost, because we all know when there are dastardly deeds afoot the butler or the chauffer or somebody like that is knee-deep in the action. All of this is to telegraph to you that you don't want to follow that path, look for more upscale villains.  And by all means don't get thrown off by some cuckoo ex-fashion designer or even by some white slavery guys. Look to a certain night club owner, played by George Sanders, a man about town who turns head over heels for our amateur detective Lucy. And she reciprocates. He however is also the prime fall guy. So without going further you can see what I mean when I can't figure out what this film wanted to be.

But maybe it is more that as a child of 1950s black and white television in America and devoted to the comedy shows like Ms. Ball's I Love Lucy I find it is hard to image back before that time to a time when she was considered something of a femme. And a femme that would catch the eye of a debonair Georges Sanders and have him swooning. Personally I don't see it. Yes, maybe it is just that, that snappy New York City working class girl meets London swell thing that doesn't work for me. If you check this one out keep that in mind.",1347148800,,2294,4.352803738317757
984615,4,6305189382,"A very enjoyable mystery which has an interesting twist to the plot.  I was surprised to find this old gem because I had never heard of it before.  Douglas Sirk is my favorite director of the 1950's era. He directed such classic films as: Written on the Wind, Magnificent Obsession, All that Heaven Allows, and Imitation of Life.  All melodramas done in unusally brilliant colors and shadows.  And always over the top in acting and background music.

This 1940's movie is in b/w and was done  before all of that and is more mystery than melodrama.  It stars Lucille Ball in a role where she shows her fine dramatic acting talent by playing the part of a hired hostess (no, not a prostitute) turned detective.  The story, which is set in London, revolves around a series of murders of young women.  Since one of the first missing and later found murdered girls was Sanda (that is, Ball's character in the film) friend, Sanda is hired by Police Inspector Temple (played so well by Charles Coburn) to set a trap for the killer in which, you guessed it, Sanda is the bait.

A young and handsome George Sanders is appealing as the obvious suspect and also Sanda's romantic interest.  Minor roles by the supporting cast contribute to making  this a fine film noir to watch, e.g. Charles Coburn, Boris Karloff, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, and whoever played Sanda's police bodyguard.  Considering the murders involved there are a couple comedic  scenes (not sure if intended or not);  but Lucille's character isn't the funny one in this flick.  Bottom line is that this is just a long forgotten but good movie with a somewhat surprising but nonetheless suspenseful ending.  Bought it for $2.99 and downloaded it here for my Amazon Video Library so I can watch it with my husband eventually too.",1321574400,2,1781,4.73051948051948
984616,4,6305189382,"A forgotten gem in the resumes of it's star and director, 1947's LURED is a delicious mystery-comedy set in London and filled with a gallery of shady characters.

When her best friend disappears after having met a mysterious gent through the personals column, Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball), a sparky American dancer stranded in London, is recruited by Scotland Yard's Inspector Harley Temple (Charles Coburn) to become a female detective.  By replying to every strange application in the personals column, Sandra aims to slowly close in on the madman who, as it turns out, is also connected with the unexplained disappearances of several more young ladies.

After a brush with Charles van Druten (Boris Karloff), a dress designer who is definitely unhinged but not the culprit that the authorities are looking for, Sandra applies for a job as the maid in a large household, where she meets suave, smooth-talking nightclub owner Robert Fleming (George Sanders).  Sparks fly and Sandra's detective mission falls by the wayside as their romance blooms...but when Sandra discovers startling evidence which labels Robert as the killer, she's thrown headlong into a thrilling new chapter of the mystery!

LURED is an overlooked gem in the early American career of it's director Douglas Sirk, best-remembered for his series of ripe, Technicolor-soaked melodramas in the 1950's (""All That Heaven Allows"", ""Written on the Wind"", ""Magnificent Obsession"", ""Imitation of Life"").

984617,3,6305189382,"When I first saw this film, I was a bit disappointed to find that Boris Karloff had only one scene, rather than being the main villain.

But I still liked the film...well enough that, when I accidentally messed-up the VHS copy I'd already bought some time ago (through Amazon.com I think), ...that I almost immediately shopped (at the same place;) for another.
(The least pricey version was a DVD...with Korean subtitles! --Funny!:) The audio, luckily for me, is in English though.)

Even though I was initially disappointed about Boris Karloff's limited time in it, I wound up liking it well enough, as I said.

It's a classic-looking and enjoyable old B&W flick about an American showgirl (Lucille Ball) residing in London, a rather fiendish ""mystery""-serial-killer who smugly informs Scotland Yard (and the Chief Inspector, played by Sir Cedric Hardwick(sp?)) of his plans through anonymously-sent poems, a ""naughty but basically goodhearted"" playboy (George Sanders) and a lot of other well-known old-time actors.

""Sandra Carpenter"" (Lucille Ball) is asked by Scotland Yard to help ""Lure"" the mystery killer into a trap (he only goes after young pretty women), and...well, let's just say she meets some rather interesting suspects (one is Boris Karloff, a demented fashion-designer-- hence, the outfit that Lucille is wearing on the front cover of the VHS and the DVD:).

Altogether, it's a rather neat atmospheric ""international-intrigue"" type of ""whodunit"" that I liked ... well enough to replace my older VHS copy with a DVD which couldn't so easily be partially demagnetized accidentally!

984710,4,6305189382,"Years before Douglas Sirk directed his masterpieces, he was earning his chops in low budget fare.  With LURED, he had William H. Daniels (Garbo's favourite) behind the camera, and the two produced some impressive imagery.  Not so much a noir, as I think of the term; it is dark, but moreso in a foggy London 'gaslight' style.

The beautiful images of wet cobblestone streets, gas street lamps, and of course fog, are wonderful. That is usually enough to keep me interested, but we also have a stellar cast of character actors:  George Sanders, Lucille Ball, Charles Coburn, Boris Karloff, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Joseph Calleia, Alan Mowbray, and George Zucco.

The DVD cover has both Lucille Ball and Boris Karloff featured, but Karloff's role is a short one.  It is probably best thought of as a Lucille Ball vehicle; she has plenty of screen time; probably my favourite of her feature film performances; brassy, and classy too.

It is a combination of murder mystery-thriller that doesn't take itself too seriously.  For example, Karloff takes a turn as a mad fashion designer who, long ago, had his dress pattern stolen by a rival fashion house(!).

The plot involves a Ripper-like serial killer who uses the personals to harvest his victims, and writes Baudelaire-styled poems to frustrate Scotland Yard. Sandra Carpenter (Lucille Ball) is recruited by Scotland Yard inspector Harley Temple (Charles Coburn), and shadowed by Officer Barrett (George Zucco), as she answers all of the personal adds; in  search of the killer. With a slightly more romantic turn for George Sanders, this is a fun Saturday Night popcorn film, indeed.

984714,4,6305189382,"Lured (Douglas Sirk, 1947)

Lucille Ball in a thriller? Believe it! Not only that, but co-starring Boris Karloff and directed by Douglas Sirk, the King of the Weepies? Everything about this (including the overseas title, The Poet-Killer) says ""six-cheese"", and oh, my does it ever deliver.

Ball plays Sandra Carpenter, an American dancer working in London at the same time as a serial killer who meets his victims through the personal ads. (The overseas title comes from the killer's habit of sending bits of verse to the police as clues.) When one of Carpenter's friends disappears, the police approach her to work undercover, as bait. (Karloff plays an insane artists who is, at the outset, one of the prime suspects.) All well and good, save Carpenter's budding romance with dashing dance fan Robert Fleming (George Sanders, soon to win an Oscar for his work in All About Eve). So, of course, we have the double-life thing going on.

What really struck me about this picture, which actually has nothing much to do with it, is how differently Sirk approached his color features. Color plays such an important part in movies like Imitation of Life and All that Heaven Allows that it's difficult to imagine Sirk working in the black and white medium. And many of the expressionist touches that makes Sirk's color films so fun are absent, it's true, but that just means Sirk plays it straight here, treating this as your basic thriller. That's what it is, though beefed up by a Leo Rosten script that plays to Ball's comedic talents and an obvious surfeit of acting chops among the cast, which also includes such luminaries as Cedric Hardwicke and Alan Mowbray. It's good old-fashioned noir, and is quite enjoyable as such. Recommended. *** ",1246233600,,1741,4.8915254237288135
984715,4,6305189382,"This is an entertaining film from 1947.  It was originally released through United Artists but it has the look of a quintessential product from the Universal lot.

Visually, about half the film has the appearance of film noir, full of dandy shadows and wet-looking streets (every frame shot on a sound stage, of course.)  The plot of ""Lured,"" however, is not noirish but a confection of plucky girl detective, woman in peril and outright romance.  With Lucille Ball as the star, you can count on both competent dramatics and a nice comic edge--one far more refined than you might expect if you know Ball only from her Lucy Ricardo persona.

""Lured"" was an independent production, but certainly not one from poverty row.  It is more than a B-picture, with its elaborate crowd scenes and often sumptuous-looking sets, but less than an A-picture as defined by MGM or Paramount.  Call it an A-.

Where the acting chops of the cast is concerned, though, this is very much an A-picture.  Think of it, in addition to the sui generis Ball, we are presented with George Sanders, Cedric Hardwick, Charles Coburn, Boris Karloff (admittedly in a short cameo that probably took no more than one or two days to shoot), George Zucco, Alan Mowbray and Joseph Calleia.  With the possible exception of Calleia, just think of the sheer resonance!  Actors had voices then, not the flattened sounds and comparative squeeks that we accept today.

This particular print is not bad, a little spotty, but pretty good as far as the visuals are concerned.  The soundtrack is a mess, though, forcing the viewer to make numerous adjustments in volume throughout the length of the film.  When you acquire this DVD, you get ""Lured,"" and that's all you get; there are no commentaries, trailers or extras of any sort.  And that's a pity, because I, for one, we be happy to know more about the circumstances of this film.

This is not a great picture and there are some fairly obvious faults, among them an excess of red herrings and diversions, a softening of Ball's character into what seems now to be a little too PG-acceptable, and the almost painfully obvious identity of the guy whodunit.  Nevertheless, ""Lured"" is an enjoyable piece of entertainment worth four solid stars.

Back in the late 1940s, before becoming America's favorite comedienne, Lucille Ball was a movie star, as can be seen in the film Lured.

I wanted to see this film because of Lucille and because Karloff appears in it.  Lucy plays Sandra Carpenter, a hired girl in Taxi Dancing.  I never heard of taxi dancing.  Apparently at this time girls could be hired in dance halls to dance with military and other guys who did not have a date but just wanted to dance.  Interesting.

The movie takes place in London and has our American taxi dancer get involved in a murder mystery.  The crime drama was a bit disappointing.  They built up the story well, but the killer was easy to spot half-way through the film.  I think this was done purposely as the director gave hints throughout.

The cops hire Sandra as their spy when Sandra's friend is one of the girls who disappears.  She uncovers a diamond smuggling ring through her efforts but the killer has yet to be found.  All suspicion falls on her boyfriend who actually is being set up.

Now, the Karloff scene.  Totally unnecessary.  Seems the director shoehorned him in to help sell the picture.

Sandra and other policewomen are answering personal ads and following them up as the killer uses this same method to lure in pretty women (thus the title).

Boris meets her, brings her to his apartment where he wants her to try on dresses and parade before an empty hall with a mannequin and a bulldog in attendance.  Karloff rolls his eyes dramatically, the dog growls menacingly and Sandra freaks out!

It's a cute sequence just to see the future comedienne's style and timing and Karloff's leering, menacing insanity, but totally unnecessary for the plot.  Oh well.

Not an Oscar winner, but an interesting bit of film history.",1242518400,,1780,4.674193548387096
984717,5,6305189382,"By the look of the cover one would think that Boris Karloff was the star of this film; he actually has one long scene but a memorable one.  Lured (1947) is a finely turned mystery that has some nice twists and turns to the story. The story takes place in London with Lucille Ball as an American who was in a show that went bust.  Very simply, a man is luring women through newspaper ads and also sends the police poems that boast about his exploits in the style of Charles Baudelaire.  Lucille Ball is a taxi dancer whose best friend falls victim to the murderer and agrees to become a detective in order to capture the killer.

Along the way, she falls in love with debonair George Sanders who is part-owner of a posh club with Cedric Hardwicke.  You will be able to guess who the murder is but one you do it is still a cat-and-mouse game as the killer could still slip through the hands of the police.  The film has some great character actors including Charles Coburn as a Scotland Yard Chief Inspector who recruits Ball, George Zucco as the avuncular detective assigned to watch over Lucille Ball, and Boris Karloff as a deranged clothing designer still showing his latest creations to the aristocracy.  George Sanders is his familiar suave and smooth self and Cedric Hardwicke is his down-to-earth partner.

The script is well-written and the production is very good, including some atmospheric scenes set in London fog.  It is a fun movie to watch even if you have seen it more than once.",1236816000,,1494,4.544776119402985

Still, this is one of the independent, low-budget films Douglas Sirk directed in the 1940s, before landing his contract with Universal, and elements of his style are readily apparent: the emphasis on decor and art direction to help create narrative continuity, the careful lighting, the emphasis on sets, costumes and props to augment the acting, the usage of mirrors. Here, Lucille Ball plays an American dance-hall girl stranded in London, who becomes a decoy for Scotland Yard. There are many genuinely creepy moments, as each person Ball encounters poses a potential threat, and the plot is enjoyably convoluted. Among the people she encounters are Charles Coburn, Boris Karloff (exceptionally sinister), George Sanders (very suave yet ambiguous; Sirk himself considered Sanders his quintessential actor), and Sir Cedric Hardwicke. The film is so entertaining that it's recommended because of the delightful story and the excellent treatment, but the DVD makes one yearn for a better edition one day.",1209859200,,1273,5.270935960591133

984800,5,6305189382,"German born director Douglas Sirk better known for melodrama crafted a slick, multi faceted thriller in the 1947 film, ""Lured"".  A demented serial killer has been lurking in the streets of London using personal ads to attract young women into fatal rendezvous.  The brash murderer had been sending Scotland Yard poems which both glorify death and announce his latest victim to the authorities.

A glamorous Lucille Ball playing American Sandra Carpenter is working as a dance hall girl.  When one of her friends goes missing, she fears that she's become the poet-killer's latest victim.  After going to the police she's recruited by Inspector Temple played by Charles Coburn to work for him and act as bait for the murderer.  While answering personal ads she meets George Sanders a London night club entrepreneur and playboy known as Robert Fleming.  They soon fall in love and she wins approval from his business partner and house mate mawkish Julian Wilde played by Sir Cedric Hardwicke.

On the eve of the wedding between Ball and Sanders she discovers evidence in his desk drawer tying him to the murders.  In her heart Ball can't believe that Sanders is the killer despite being taken into custody by the protective and trustworthy Inspector Temple.  The story turns into a cat and mouse pursuit as Coburn tries to trap the players in the film revealing the identity of the killer.

Boris Karloff has a bizarre cameo as deranged fashion designer Charles van Druten who placed a personal ad that Ball answered.  ""Lured"" contains all the trademarks of the film noir drama and the acting performances on the whole are quite good and tinged with the hint of melodrama, courtesy of Sirk's direction.",1168214400,2,1699,4.943661971830986
984801,4,6305189382,"The packaging of this delightful noirish thriller would have you believe it's a Boris Karloff film, but it's not by any means. On the back cover of the DVD box there are two photos and a poster reproduction, and George Zucco is in every one of them along with Lucille Ball, the actual star. Boris is prominently displayed on the front cover, though, thus leading to the misconception that he's one of the stars. He gets fourth billing, and that's generous. Lucy and George Sanders are the stars, with Charles Coburn, Cedric Hardwick and George Zucco getting far more screen time. A better title for the movie would be PARADE OF THE RED HERRINGS, one of which is old Boris, who has one scene as a somewhat demented dress designer who may or may not be a killer, but in any case is not the killer our heroes are searching for. Regardless, it's a stylish thriller and quite enjoyable.

Lucille Ball is known generally as wacky Lucy from TV, but prior to that she was a very glamourous, very beautiful actress in B pictures, mostly. This is one of her best roles, and it makes you wish someone had smacked her upside the head and convinced her to do more, especially as she aged beyond wacky Lucy. Had she allowed herself to mature, she could have had a whole different career. (Of course, she died a multimillionaire, so maybe I'm wrong!)

Anyway, this DVD is highly recommended. The picture quality is far superior to many 30s and 40s films making their way to DVD. I do wish, though, there were some bonus features. How about a retrospective of Lucy's pre-TV career? Or a trailer? Or...anything!",1144281600,6,1594,4.589473684210526

If you know Ball only through her most famous manifestation as zany Lucy Ricardo, this movie will reveal her ability to fulfill a dramatic/romantic role.

But right from the beginning of ""Lured"" you know that you are in the hands of a major director. Each frame is composed with the eye of an artist; the suspense is carefully built and maintained; and the atmosphere is sophisticated yet full of foreboding. In fact, if you showed this movie to a beginning student of cinema, I don't think it would take much to persuade them that they were watching a film directed by Alfred Hitchcock.
The experienced cast is a delight to watch with George Sanders as a charming, debonair cad (as usual); Charles Coburn as the methodical but fatherly detective (a bit of miscasting there, but he pulls it off); and Lucille Ball as the shrewd, captivating heroine of our tale in one of her non-comedic roles. I enjoyed watching everyone, including Boris Karloff who plays the odd part of an insane haute couture designer to the hilt, although he is on the screen for only about 10 minutes. (Why, pray tell, is Karloff's photo on the cover of the DVD, when his role in the movie is such a minor one?) Only Sir Cedric Hardwick appears to be dispassionately walking through his part, although the story's denouement may explain why.
The print of the film is sharp and crisp for the most part, although a few short scenes appear to have been taken from an inferior source and contain some distracting artifacts. The sound varies from reel to reel, but is generally good and always acceptable. Overall, this is a fine print of an engaging film, and especially interesting because of Lucille Ball who successfully (I think) pulls off a dramatic role with balance and assurance.",1056672000,17,1867,4.8193146417445485

984807,5,6305189382,"Lucille Ball starred in Hunt Stromberg's independent production of ""Lured"" in 1947, four years before she began her long and eminently successful run starring with husband Desi Arnez in the hilarious sitcom ""I Love Lucy,"" which broke TV records for longevity.  In ""Lured"" Lucille is cast as an undercover police decoy in London seeking to help capture a twentieth century ""Jack the Ripper"" serial killer of women.
On the surface it would appear highly unlikely that ""Lured"" would serve as a genesis or prelude to Lucy's comedy triumph which began four years later.  Ironically the similarities are paramount.  While the dramatic vehicle is devoid of the kind of hilarious slapstick that helped make ""I Love Lucy"" a big hit, one sees the same wisecracking lady in action.  In ""Lured"" using humor and delivering the proper one-liners enable her to survive.
At the story's beginning Lucy, an actress whose London show bombed early, gets a job at a taxi dancing establishment at night to survive.  When her closest friend and fellow dancer is killed, she visits detective Charles Coburn at Scotland Yard.  Coburn is impressed by her native intelligence coupled with her beauty.  He finds her the perfect lure to trap the brutal killer who has been terrorizing London women.
Leo Rosten, who later wrote the novel ""Captain Newman,"" which became a successful film starring Gregory Peck and Tony Curtis, penned a rapidly moving script while German emigre Douglas Sirk, who would later direct Rock Hudson in his two major dramatic triumphs at Universal, ""The Magnificent Obsession"" and ""Written on the Wind,"" directed deftly and provided the kind of moody  settings of nocturnal London that makes viewers feel a part of the scene.  The accomplishment is all the more remarkable in that the film was shot entirely in Hollywood on a frugal budget.
Lucy meets a fascinating band of characters before the mystery is ultimately resolved with the unmasking of the brutal killer.  Boris Karloff appears early.  Lucy is able to keep the emotionally disturbed Londoner at bay until help arrives.  She later is able to help crack a white slavery operation headed by Alan Mowbray.
The plot thickens when the man with whom Lucy falls in love,  suave and witty playboy George Sanders, emerges as a suspect, as does his lawyer, Sir Cedric Hardwicke.  When Lucy finally does manage to bring the killer into the open, she is compelled to use her wiles one last time to survive before Scotland Yard detectives arrive.  She is at her best using her intuition in cat-and-mouse games with dangerous men, culminating with the twentieth century Jack the Ripper.",1028678400,8,2630,5.0137931034482754

7884816,5,6305189382,"This is a review of the Cohen Film Collection blu-ray edition of Lured, currently released as half of TWO FILMS BY DOUGLAS SIRK DOUBLE FEATURE. I believe the Amazon Video version is similar in viewing quality.

Lured, the fourth Hollywood film to credit Douglas Sirk as a director, is a remake of the 1939 French film Pi&egrave;ges, directed by Robert Siodmak (released in the U.S. as Personal Column). In Siodmak's hands the story is dark and ends in suicide. With Sirk the story is told tongue-in-cheek, has a rich comic streak, and gives its heroine a well-deserved happy ending. That heroine is played by Lucille Ball, here ravishingly beautiful in her mid thirties. For many Ball will be reason to watch this film, so let it be said up front that this richly layered confection of comedy, romance, and suspense is tailor-made for her particular and considerable talents. She shines.

The Cohen blu-ray edition is flawless, like the best Criterions. You can count the threads in fabric if you've a mind to. Like everything else in this production, the cinematography is first class (by one of the all-time greats. William Daniels), drawing as needed on the vocabulary we call noir, but also providing many brighter scenes warmly lit to show off Ball's wardrobe and charms.

If like me you got to know George Sanders during the part of his career when he was providing the Disney voice for Shere Khan, Lucille Ball falling for him might seem a stretch. Not to worry. The 1947 edition of Sanders works well together with Ball in this film. Their chemistry is believable, and together with the outstanding work done by every major and minor character actor in the cast, they make the movie's 102 minutes pass very quickly indeed.

As with any genre film, the plot is characterized more by concoction than verisimilitude. But, as mentioned, Sirk is not content just to knock out a serviceable whodunit. This film is a mash-up, and the transitions between tender, humorous, charming, and tense scenes are handled masterfully -- never more so than in the funny-scary Boris Karloff set piece. Cohen provides a really good commentary track by TCM's Jeremy Arnold, whose insights have influenced this review.

So, five stars. Not because this is a great film but because it is a satisfying one, made with great care by some of the best in the business and preserved with great care in the Cohen edition.",1485734400,,2398,4.853300733496333
