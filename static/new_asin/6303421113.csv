7850110,4,6303421113,"Underrated 1990s indie comedy. Sure, some of the humor is timely and requires that you remember or have some knowledge of the early 1990s to understand what they are referring to. The final 20 minutes become a bit sentimental. But overall very good film.",1500681600,,254,4.795454545454546

7850112,5,6303421113,Great comedy flick from the 90's. The actor who plays Splick is hilarious.,1459209600,,74,4.769230769230769

MY LIFE'S IN TURNAROUND: Low-budget, independent movies about guys trying to make a low-budget, independent movie were a cottage industry around this time, but this one is much more: It's a buddy flick up, with a romantic comedy back--and a very funny, original film (subtitle: ""Based on a true story""). It's really about two American dreamers; lovable losers on a quest for success.

How funny you find this flick will depend entirely on how funny you find Schaeffer and Ward. I love `em: they're a Gen-X Abbott and Costello on speed, with machine gun delivery and a gift for wacky dialog and description. Besides, how can you not like guys who invented the ""self high-five,"" or who do a ""we have girlfriends now"" dance? They're sweet, nice and funny --and they've made one smart movie about two dumb guys.",1422230400,,1066,4.634920634920635
7850114,4,6303421113,"I watched this on Flix on long ago it was a friday night, not much on.  I saw the Madonna look a like and the caught my intrest.  WOW this is a good movie.  The two men are like albert and Coastello.  Only more funny.  I am a huge fan of Eric Schaeffer is genus hes the perfect wirter I am going to watch his ""If Lucy Fell"" I love this movie because it is filmed in New York I love most movies filmed in New York.",1324080000,,413,3.7011494252873565
7850115,3,6303421113,"Although ""Turnaround"" unsuprisingly doesn't have much to offer in terms of image/audio quality, the film itself is funny at worth checking out - especially for the low retail price of $9.99 - and less at most stores.",1307145600,,216,4.864864864864865
7850116,1,6303421113,Inane.  Sophomoric.  Phoebe Cates could not make up for the rest of the cast or plot (if there was one).  Don't waste your time or money.,1125532800,,137,4.1923076923076925
7850117,5,6303421113,"I find Eric Schaeffer is one of the best filmmakers to come on to the scene. My Life's in Turnaround is one of my favorite movies. If you enjoyed the Television series, New York Daze/Too Something then you should  definitly see this movie, along with If Lucy Fell.",955411200,2,264,4.5
