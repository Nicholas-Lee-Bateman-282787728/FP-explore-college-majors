8626996,3,B00GSTHDD4,"Not my favorite Autry movies.  I am a big fan and own all of his movies, either in VHS or now in DVD.  Some of his Columbia output is terrific.  About these:

""Loaded Pistols"" is about 20 minutes too long.  Not enough script to carry it.  The young guy is an obnoxious royal pain until the very end of the movie.  Gene does sing several good songs.

""Gene Autry and the Mounties"" is pretty good but this is another story where the young guy is annoying throughout the movie.  That seemed to be a characteristic in the B-westerns, with the girl's brother being an antagonist until the end of the story.  This was filmed on location at Big Bear in the mountains northeast of Los Angeles.

""Night Stage to Galveston"" is also pretty good but is marred by the silliness between the little girl and cranky old Thurston Hall.  Robert Livingston is the head of the bad guys, and Clayton Moore, unbilled, is a murderer who soon meets his own end.  Interesting to note that they were both the Lone Ranger.  Also, isn't it the least bit odd how much Galveston, Texas on the Gulf Coast, looks like the Lone Pine area of the Sierra Nevada mountains?

""Goldtown Ghost Riders"" is a fanciful story that is disjointed at times.  Still, there is a lot of fighting and shooting.  Nothing great here -- my opinion.

Gene is always excellent at being Gene Autry, but to me the stories need better writing.",1434326400,,1384,4.468

8626998,5,B00GSTHDD4,"These Autry DVDs from Timeless video are superb value for money. When they say restored they mean it. 4 excellent examples of Autry's later Columbia work (my personal favourite period of his work). If only Pat Buttram and S.Burnette weren't in them...but what's this? LOADED PISTOLS has neither, and it has a lovely Barbara Britton and Chill Wills as a sheriff. This is perhaps my favourite with a proviso. For the first 40 mins it's a straightforward good old fashioned western. Then the scene changes to a typical western town and suddenly there are cars and electricity and radios. Confusing as back on location it was back to stagecoaches and gunfights etc. Good film tho. The other 3 are all good and GOLDTOWN has Gail Davis. Forgive me if I don't write any more. Nuff said. Autry/Western fans...This is a must, and do check out the other DVDs on offer from Timeless. All excellent quality.",1424908800,,895,4.780645161290322

8627002,4,B00GSTHDD4,Several of Autry's productions when he left Republic and moved to Columbia Pictures. More story substance and less reliance on musical numbers. I enjoyed them more than most of his Republic westerns...and I am a Republic Pictures fan!,1400803200,,234,5.184210526315789
