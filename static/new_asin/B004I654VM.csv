4383984,5,B004I654VM,"i love british comedy and this series was maybe pretty close to the first one i viewed . hated when it ended . it is just perfect, just perfect. when i saw i could buy it ,as it seems to never be shown ,i even bought the dvd player to play it as it is a region 4  dvd set , but then i also was able to purchase 'touch of frost' which was region 2 with the dvd player . anyway kind of like ma and pa kettle go to england . if you enjoyed that old classic movie 'the egg and i' i am thinking you would enjoy this.",1335571200,,511,3.6036036036036037

4383986,5,B004I654VM,"One of my favorite Britcoms.  I think it and Yes Prime Minister are neck and neck.  Next would be Rumpole of the Bailey and Lovejoy.  I received the item most promptly and in excellent cond.  Most of the recent Britcoms I think are, as most american tv stuff, enamored with all things sexual and homo and I don't watch that crap.  This one is highly recommended.  No problem with giving it 5 stars in my estimation.",1316131200,8,415,4.394736842105263
4383987,5,B004I654VM,"I am a devout fan of British comedy and own many of them on DVD and VHS. I am gradually replacing the ones on VHS with the DVD format as they become available and was very happy to be able to purchase ""The Darling Buds of May"" on DVD. I am a great fan of David Jason. (Loved him in ""Open All Hours"", which I also have). The beautiful Catherine Zeta Jones is also a pleasure to watch and Pam Ferris was marvelous as the mother of that large brood. The great thing about having my favorite shows on DVD is that I can watch them again and again whenever if need a good laugh. Thanks for providing the British shows and keep them coming. There are many good ones that I would like to own on DVD.

4383988,4,B004I654VM,"I would have LOVED to have given this series a 5 star rating  if only it had indeed been the "" Complete Series"" that it is saying it is.  In fact it is only a "" selection"" from the series and as a result the continuity of the story has been negatively affected.  I am surprised that no review has mentioned the missing  episodes as there are several,  but perhaps no one else had watched the series when it was originally aired on public television.  Would have been worth the fairly high price if it was what it was supposed to be!",1430092800,8,532,4.166666666666667

4383994,4,B004I654VM,"This is an excellent series, but I gave it four stars only because there is a problem on American DVD players with the default resolution. Out of the box, the picture on the screen is too wide. I had to reset the HDMI resolution to 480i, and that solved the problem. If you're not using the HDMI port on the TV, I assume that the resolution for other ports can be reset also.

The show is very amusing, particularly if you enjoy a family of good natured rogues who live in the bucolic English countryside. I strongly recommend this series to anyone who likes good acting, convincing characters, and British TV production standards.",1416787200,4,631,4.584070796460177

Ma and Pa are so adorable that when each episode ends, you will have a HUGE smile on your face.  That is what entertainment's supposed to be.",1403049600,,380,4.309859154929577

Unfortunately, I was sent the wrong version from the UK, which I did not order and was unable to play it in my American DVD player. After many emails back and forth, I was told that they did not have the American version and the non refundable return postage amounted to the same cost as the DVD, so it was pointless to send it back so they could scam another American. I just wanted  to let others know before they, too, are scammed. In essence, I was stuck with an unusable product. Rare Waves Imports will never get any business from me again!

The ""Darling Buds of May"" is a 1991 TV series about a quite unconventional and flamboyant family in rural England in the 1950s.

While each episode is unique and fun to watch and actually picked up the series to see the early works of Catherine Zeta-Jones playing the part of Mariette the voluptuous daughter in the family. Little did I know that I would fall in love with all the characters.

I came to this series originally after watching ""The Mating Game"" starring Debbie Reynolds, Tony Randall, Paul Douglas, and Fred Clark, which is more of a PG comedy based on the same characters based on  first book of ""The Darling buds of May"" written by  H.E. BATES;  which was written and set in 1958.

8430170,5,B004I654VM,"This is such a wonderful, beautiful series. I have watched it twice all the way through and will watch it again. If I could have one wish it would be to be adopted by the Larkins. I simply love them. Even my husband thought this was great.

Don't miss this terrific series, one of the highest-rated shows in England.",1447632000,,316,4.3559322033898304
8430171,4,B004I654VM,"It's gentle, undemanding entertainment which is my favorite kind but really, folks, if this is farm life then I'm a monkey's aunt.  The Larkins have way too much money and wa-a-ay too much leisure time.  Still, the values are the old-fashioned, wholesome kind so hard to find in cinema these days, so I recommend the series as excellent family fare.",1435795200,,349,4.8
8430172,5,B004I654VM,"Everything - the stories, camerawork, music, and especially the performances - is in sync.  You'll feel better after spending an hour and a half at the Larkin's Kent farm in the late 1950s.

For those who first experienced Pam Ferris in Call the Midwife, this role is nearly 180 degrees opposite.  Here she's ""Ma,"" an unmarried farmwife raising (and cooking!) a small brood while taking care of her ""Pa"" - David Jason.  Catherine Zeta Jones plays their eldest daughter, and with Philip Franks are the younger couple whom Ma & Pa keep under their wing through minor misadventures.

As Pa would say, ""Perfick!""",1434844800,,608,4.864077669902913
