3851445,5,B00265T7JM,"Ichikawa Raizo is one of the few Japanese jidai geki actors to star in two successful and long-lasting series.  Katsu Shintaro was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zatoichi/dp/B00073K7JY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zatoichi</a>, and his brother Wakayama Tomisaburo was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lone-Wolf-and-Cub/dp/B000AYNFVC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lone Wolf and Cub</a>, but only Ichikawa was both the earnest ninja from the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shinobi-No-Mono/dp/B002CLKP0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shinobi No Mono</a>&nbsp;series, as well as the stone-faced nihilist known as Nemuri Kyoshiro, known in translation as ""The Sleepy Eyes of Death.""

Ichikawa's film series is actually the second attempt at creating films from Shibata Renzaburo's 1956 ""Nemuri Kyoshio"" (""Sleepy Kyoshiro"" in English) novels. The Toho-produced series staring Tsuruta Koji lasted only for three films from 1956-58.  The novels were later ""re-booted"" in 1963 with actor Ichikawa Raizo, and those are the sleepy eyes we know and love.

Although the character of the ""Super Samurai"" appears constantly in Japanese film, Ichikawa's Nemuri Kyoshio is cut from a distinctly different and darker cloth. Shintaro's Zatoichi is quick to deal out death to wrong-doers, but his kindly nature and inability to wind up with the girl at the end of the movie puts him more in the league of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tora-San/dp/B002LFPBGU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tora-San</a>&nbsp;that in Ichikawa's dark hero.  By contrast, in the third film in this boxset, ""Full Circle Killing"", Nemuri Kyoshiro cruely rapes a girl, and then spends some part of the film defending himself from her attempts to get revenge.  Definitely not one of the good guys.

The series grows with each adventure, with the first few films being enjoyable but not ground-breaking, and then with the fourth film literally all hell breaking loose.  Nemuri Kyoshiro's story is revealed, being born of a Christian priest who fell from grace and raped a Japanese woman during a Black Mass to Satan, he is a man who has been cursed from birth. The effects pump up a notch in number four as well, with his ""Full Circle Cut"" technique suddenly drawing psychedelic tracers in the air instead of the bland circle from the first three films.  Number four in this set will give you a good taste of what is to come.

Ichikawa's death from cancer at the young age of 37 cut short the ""Nemuri Kyoshiro"" series, although he still managed to make twelve films, the last of which was finished with the use of a stand in.  Daiei films tried to continue the series with a different actor, Matsukata Hiroki, but by then the sleepy-eyed killer had become permanently associated with Ichikawa Raizo, and no substitutes would be accepted.

The four films in this set are:

""The Chinese Jade"" (""Nemuri Kyoshiro: Sappocho"" or ""The Murder Scroll"") - Based on actual history, the smuggler Zeniya Gohei and Lord Maeda both attempt to recruit Nemuri Kyoshiro in a desperate battle to recover a statue of Chinese jade.  Inside the statue is a slip of paper showing the relationship between the Lord and the smuggler, which could spell the doom for Lord Maeda and his million-koku estate.  The Kyoshiro in this first is much more of an idealist than the cold-hearted killer of the later series, and it is interesting to watch his progression.  One a special note Wakayama Tomisaburo pops up here as a Chinese Shaolin monk Chen Sun who wants to pit his hand-to-hand skills against Kyoshiro's Full Moon Cut.

""Sword of Adventure"" (Nemuri Kyoshiro: Shobu"" or ""Match Game"") - The political theme of the series starts here, as Kyoshiro finds himself entangled with officers of the Shogun, specifically the Minister of Finance's attempts to reform the currency system, and the Princess Taka who sees those reforms as a threat to her extravagant lifestyle.  Kyoshiro befriends the old minister, which makes him a target to the Princesses plots.

""Full Circle Killing"" (""Nemuri Kyoshiro: Mangetsu Kiri"" or ""Full-Moon Cut"") - Kyoshiro is again at odds with the Shogun, specifically his illegitimate son Katagiri Takayuki, whose mother has slowly been killing off all of the Shogun's sons in order to assure Takayuki's ascension.  Takayuki desires Kyoshiro's rare Musou Masamune sword, and Kyoshiro desires Takayuki's pretty fianc&eacute;.  Both men are more than willing to take what they want by force.  Wakayama Tomisaburo reappears here as Chen Sun, although sporting a ridiculous pompadour for some reason.

""Sword of Seduction"" (""Nemuri Kyoshiro: Joyoken"" or ""Seducing Sword"") - This one is the best of the boxset, when Kyoshiro comes into contact with a group of Hidden Christians who have knowledge of his birth.  They beg him to protect a woman, known as the ""Virgin Shima,"" and who the group claims is a blood-relative of Kyoshiro.  From here, the idealistic Kyoshiro of the first series is dead, and the sleepy-eyed killer mercilessly beheads Christian priests and cuts down unarmed nuns in cold blood.

Animeigo has shepherded ""The Sleepy Eyes of Death"" series since the days of VHS and then Laserdisc.  The series appearance on DVD has been highly anticipated, and Animeigo has not let us down.  All four disks are conveniently packaged in a folding box, and it is hard to believe that this much awesomeness takes up so little room on your shelf.  As always, the subtitles are impeccable, with your choice of yellow or white, and a few other options such as ""expanded subtitles"" which offer cultural notes along with the dialog.  There are also an interactive map of Japan, extensive production notes and a booklet with excerpts by Patrick Galloway who wrote&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stray-Dogs-Lone-Wolves-The-Samurai-Film-Handbook/dp/1880656930/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves: The Samurai Film Handbook</a>.

3851446,5,B00265T7JM,"This is what you will hear a lot in this series. Mostly by women who either hate or love Nemuri Kyoshiro. Visually, these films don't look like they are pushing close to 50 years old. The image is beautiful. The sound also gets top marks. There is no English language track for these films, and I praise AnimEigo for not including it, if there ever was an English track. The sub-titles are glorious. If AnimEigo is known for anything other than their anime, it must be for their sub-titles. They are a joy to read, and produce quite a bit of chuckles and laughter. I have been waiting for this series to come out on DVD for over 10 years now. I really thought I would never see it. As usual, Animeigo also includes a booklet with a detailed history of the film, and its star, Ichikawa Raizo. Anyone who loves Japanese Cinema or Samurai films must get this box set. Please try some of the other films by AnimEigo, especially ""Lone Wolf and Cub"" and ""Zatoichi"", you will not be sorry.",1251590400,11,982,4.4010989010989015

3851448,4,B00265T7JM,"I own the laser disc versions of episodes 1-4 from Animeigo so am eagerly awaiting the price going down to 'upgrade' my collection of these great films into DVD format.  Raizo's character in this series just doesn't operate with a consistently moral deck - he is erratic (and thus the films are always surprising.  Great character.)  The middle period of these ""Son of Black Mass"" films (ep 5-8) have better production values than these four and the series gets more psychedelically baroque as it moves on (not to detriment.)  I find myself not really responding fully to the series (which I watch repeatedly) until episode three.  The bad princess in film three is great, and the somewhat slower/dark (by that I mean not very bright prints) episodes 1 & 2 are left behind.  From this point on the series becomes consistently exceptional, albeit a bit episodic with arbitrary plotting at times.  The Black Mass films have replaced the Lone Wolf and Cub flics (the six films) as my favorite all-time chambarra fix.",1248048000,8,1013,4.854651162790698
3851449,5,B00265T7JM,"from NIPPON CINEMA:
Taking some time to catch up on releases. US distributor AnimEigo will be releasing a Sleepy Eyes of Death box set in July which consists of the first 4 films of the classic 12-part series starring Raizo Ichikawa as a half-breed swordsman and master of the Full Moon Cut. Sleepy Eyes Of Death Collector's Set Vol. 1 includes ""The Chinese Jade"", ""Sword of Adventure"", ""Circle Killing"", and ""Sword of Seduction"".

In The Chinese Jade (Nemuri Kyoshiro: Sappch, 1963), Kyoshiro makes quick work of a group of ambushers, convincing their master Lord Maeda that this is a man that could be useful for his own purposes. Maeda sends his ward Chisa to seduce Kyoshiro in an attempt to convince him to attack a man who has evidence linking Maeda to an illegal smuggling ring. Blinded by love, Kyoshiro is eventually forced to face off against criminals and a Shorenji boxing master who's obsessed with finding out if his technique can beat the Full Moon Cut. [Watch trailer]

In Sword of Adventure (Nemuri Kyoshiro: Shbu, 1964), Kyoshiro is tasked with protecting the financial adviser of the Shogunate after he cuts off the allowance of the Shogun's spoiled, rebellious daughter. For revenge--not to mention her own perverse whims--Princess Taka drugs Kyoshiro and attempts to have him kidnapped. Kyoshiro is eventually challenged by various enemies looking to defeat his Full Moon Cut, leading to a final battle in which he takes them all on.

In Circle Killing (Nemuri Kyoshiro: Engetsu Giri, 1964), Kyoshiro shows off his skills by slicing the clothes off a female opponent before running afoul of the Shogun's illegitimate son and an obsessive sword collector.

In Sword of Seduction (Nemuri Kyoshiro: Onna Jyken, 1964), Kyoshiro gets caught up in a plot to kill an innocent girl who's posing as a washerwoman. After enlisting the help of a few unlikely allies, he must stop the fanatical mob that wants her dead before it's too late.

Region 1, NTSC, anamorphic widescreen, 4 discs. Japanese audio with selectable English subtitles. Features include audio commentary (Ric Meyers and Jeff Rovin), program notes, cast/crew info, stills gallery, and trailers. Also included: collector's booklet.

These films are wonderful and I would recommend them for anybody (over the age of 18) who loves ""Zatoichi"" or any other Samurai film or series such as ""Lone Wolf and Cub.""  Purposeful plots and fun fight scenes splatter across the screen in these first four films of Nemuri Kyoshiro, the Son of the Black Mass, as he roams the streets of Edo or the countryside of fuedal Japan.

I hated to see that struggle disappear from the series. That is my only complaint. Great series. Certainly worth getting all three volumes. Good action. Many different directors each with their own style. If you like Zatoichi or Lone Wolf and Cub then you will probably enjoy this.

8352069,4,B00265T7JM,"Very watchable samurai series.  I've seen a lot of Japanese cinema, a lot of samurai movies and a lot of Japanese cinema filmed in the 50s 60s 70s.  I think these are well-made, the lead, Raizo Ichikawa has that young outsider's rebel thing going on, the stories are all good, some better than others.  Based on all that film watching experience, I'd say these are a solid B+, very worth watching, but none of them is a must-watch classic.

The first four movies, out of a total of twelve in the Nemuri Kyoshiro series starring the great Raizo Ichikawa:

1. Sleepy Eyes of Death 1: The Chinese Jade (1963)
Dir: Tokuz Tanaka
Wri: Seiji Hoshikawa
2. Sleepy Eyes of Death 2: Sword of Adventure (1964)
Dir: Kenji Misumi
Wri: Seiji Hoshikawa
3. Sleepy Eyes of Death 3: Full Circle Killing (1964)
Dir: Kimiyoshi Yasuda
Wri: Seiji Hoshikawa
4. Sleepy Eyes of Death 4: Sword of Seduction (1964)
Dir: Kazuo Ikehiro
Wri: Kimiyoshi Hoshikawa

All in the original theatrical ratio (2.35:1) and with 16/9 enhancement. Remastered, clean, with vibrant colors. They really look gorgeous. Subtitles, in English, are the usual AnimEigo excellent, either in colors (yellow, plus others) or white, and with or without translation notes.

Extras:
* Program notes / interactive map of Tokyo(screen text.)
* Trailers
* Audio commentary in the first movie, that deals with all four films in the box set, and all things Nemuri Kyoshiro in general, plus some Gamera thrown in. By the way, AnimeEigo doesn't usually include commentaries, this is a welcome extra. Sadly, they did not do the same in box 2.
* 18-page booklet containing:
-- A brief history of the movie series
-- Historical background
-- Christianity: The forbidden religion
-- Short reviews of movies 1 & 4, taken from Patrick Galloway's book 'Stray Dogs & Lone Wolves'.
-- Short bios of author Renzaburo Shibata and star Raizo Ichikawa.

A no-brainer for any samurai / chambara film buff. The movies range from good (the first) to excellent (the others), Kyoshiro is really a fantastic character, no wonder the books and the movies were so popular. He's deadly and cynical, with a definite sympathy for the underdog, and for ladies of all social conditions. But also with a dark, bloodthirsty streak. A true antihero. And we also have Tomisaburo Wakayama in two of them movies, showing some dismal martial arts skills. He's great in his dialogue scenes, though.

My only complaint, $80 is a tad expensive. Of course, i bought it at $54 from amazon, which is a more reasonable price. Just shop around if the price goes up again. If you are in the US, AnimEigo normally sells them cheap from their own website.",1304035200,2,2224,4.873015873015873
