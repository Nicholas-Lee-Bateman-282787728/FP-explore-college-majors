5110014,5,B007TZOD16,"I watched the original  New Dragon Gate Inn a long time ago and that was a great film as well with excellent actors back then. Maggie Cheung, Brigitte Lin, Tony Leung, Donnie Yen...the original had an amazing cast with some solid actors that it'd be hard to outdo it.  I wasn't sure what to expect with this version going in but I figured it wouldn't be exactly the same. I much prefer the story line of this one.  It was similar in some areas but not really. There were characters in this version that wasn't present in the original but it was done well. The film was beautifully shot with some wonderful scenic views and was just pretty to watch. I had the Blu-ray so the movie was super crisp and clear. I didn't realize that this movie was filmed in 3d at first but the effects were still great in 2d. You can definitely tell how it will look in 3d in some areas but the CGI was done very well. I watched a ton of Asian cinema growing up since I'm Asian, and I love wuxia movies. I love face-paced sword fighting and there was a lot of that in this movie as well as a lot of knife throwing, which is my kind of movie . I watched pretty much all of Jet Li's movies and he does a great job as always in this one. He is probably the most recognized name, however, the supporting actors are all actors that i recognize In other movies from mainland China films so it was a great cast. This was directed by Tsui Hark so you know it's going to be a good film. It's definitely one of the better movies that have come out in 2011 and I was so excited to order it off Amazon. Definitely would recommend this as well as the original so you can compare the differences and enjoy them both!",1337904000,20,1682,4.137614678899083
5110015,5,B007TZOD16,"Dragon Inn is one of my favorite movies (Maggie Cheung!). This is a sequel of sorts with much of the action taking place in the same inn. References are made to the first film, and there are some similarities in the plots. I'm a great fan of HK martial arts films, and this one satisfied in every respect, story, cinematography (3D!), acting and action. Tsui Hark directed. Jet Li did much of the heavy lifting in the action department, but all of the actors and actresses made significant contributions. The ladies are very lovely and very lethal. (Would we want them any other way?) This is being billed as the first HK actioner in 3D, and the 3D is used very effectively. The same 3D cameras James Cameron uses were used filming this apparently. Another first I'm sure is a fight sequence inside a tornado. I don't think I've ever seen anything quite like that before. So, to sum up, the film is highly recommended if you're into this kind of movie or if you're looking for a good addition to your 3D collection.",1335312000,32,1015,4.521739130434782

5110018,5,B007TZOD16,"One of the best 3D titles available. Both subtitled and dubbed editions are included. Both have drawbacks. Reading the subtitles is sometimes a challenge with the visual, but the subtitled edition is flat and basic. Recommendation: watch once with the dubbing, then enjoy the better subtitled version knowing enough about the plot. Opening shot over the harbor is amazing, and a good idea of what is to come. If you are looking for a new disc to show off your 3D, this is an excellent choice. On a par with ""Life of Pi"" and ""Hugo.""",1501027200,3,531,4.6

People are flying all over the the place as if they were SuperMan, Superwoman. The 3D is real good. The story line is interesting but it plays in the background to daggers and swords flying through the air.

I bought this DVD based on a ""Top Ten 3D"" list I stumbled upon on-line.  I have no regrets.  The special effects (and, as these effects relate to 3D), are awesome.  I can't believe that such an ""unknown"" movie is this superior, as it related to 3D.",1439164800,3,493,4.867469879518072

5110072,3,B007TZOD16,"This is a new reimagining of the 1992 film Dragon Inn. First, the CGI in this is all over the place. Sometimes it looks good, other times really fake looking. I also feel it was a bit overused. The characters & acting aren't bad & Jet Li as usual is great. The fight scenes are well done when they're not too bogged down with CGI. The story is ok but its really nothing spectacular, just felt like more of a means to get to the next confrontation. I won't comment on the 3D as I only viewed the 2D version of the film. I guess I had really high hopes for this one being a huge fan of the 1992 film which was produced by Tsui Hark who directed this one. Its not a bad film & is enjoyable for what it is.

Very disappointed of  the director Tsui Hark on not paying attention to details. It may be small but still need attention [IMHO]. The storyline is weak and non-cohesive. Looks like Mr. Tsui is ONLY interested in the 3-D and all other digital effects, which are not very impressive [btw]. Nothing is new in this movie. No chemistry between Jet Li and Zhou Xun.",1419897600,,476,4.471264367816092

Overall the movie was definitely visually more stunning than the original that was made in the 90s.  My only complaint is that because I did watch the first Dragon Inn, I felt the actress that played the character Maggie Cheung played in the first, didn't do her justice.  I felt she was a little boring, Maggie played the character with a lot more wit.  Not sure if it was the actress or how the part was written in this sequel.

The Chinese directors and producers have moved beyond the ""flying"" abilities of kung-fu fighters, but no one can top their ability to create stunning visuals such as the sandstorm, the epic proportions and the deadly mayhem of wars as in this film. The book can be confusing, loosely based on the facts of a time when authority was stolen from the imperial overlords by the eunuchs, but it becomes entangled with stolen gold, mistaken identity, the introduction of a third force of tattooed Tartars (try saying THAT three times fast) and a band of men banded together to dispense justice.

CGI is good, except for the wire fu which in my opinion they go beyond the realm of realistic martial arts to martial arts where not only do the characters have the ability to fly but things like sword pieces behave as if the laws of physics don't exist.

5110128,4,B007TZOD16,"Flying Swords of Dragon Gate was a fun wuxia film. Tsui Hark has an expert eye for beautiful shots, and it's on display in this film as well. The whole thing looked gorgeous, and the action had good flow and impact.

The characters, though acted superbly, however felt a bit overpopulated until the end. The film in general has a feel as if its epic finale was written first, and everything else forced into place to make the ending work whether or not it left a functioning beginning and middle. The ending was fantastic with excellent action and good emotion from the characters.

Unfortunately, the beginning and the middle were a bit fuzzy, with too many characters just waiting for a sandstorm to arrive so that the last 40 minutes or so of action could unfold. The first half hour introduces too many characters for any of them to be really fleshed out and gets them as quickly as possible to the Dragon Gate Inn. After that, they sit tight and do next to nothing. They don't grow as characters much either, most of them never evolving any motivation beyond ""get the gold!"". There is a bit of intrigue as a character from one faction is a look-alike for the lead villain, but this in the end serves for nothing more than to thin out the villain's army so that the finale has our lead characters all on their own.

But, there is still plenty of action while the characters wait around to keep anyone awake, so it never drags. There's quite a bit of cgi, but it's all decent and adds to the style of action the film was going for. Traditional martial arts fans won't be impressed, but fans of physics-defying wuxia will feel right at home.

Overall, a strong ending, good action throughout, and well-acted, if not well-written characters leaves Flying Swords of Dragon Gate at a solid 4 stars.",1365379200,,1797,4.554179566563468

5110140,3,B007TZOD16,"Following the success of ""Detective Dee: Mystery of the Phantom Flame,"" Hark Tsui went on to make ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"" (""Long men fei jia""), a very loose sequel to a 1992 martial arts action film ""New Dragon Gate Inn"" (""Sun lung moon hak chan"") directed by Raymond Lee and written and produced by Hark Tsui. But the more important thing about the director's new film is Jet Li's return to Hark Tsui movie. I still remember the sensational action sequences of Li as Wong Fei-hung in ""Once Upon a Time in China"" (1991).

I know the comparison is unfair, but still cannot help feeling that ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"" is a disappointment. I tried to ignore the film's obvious flaw, a convoluted storyline, having seen so many Hark Tsui movies including ""Detective Dee"" and thinking I am pretty much accustomed to that. No, he went too far this time. With so many things going on at the same time, I just couldn't follow the story.

Set in the Ming Dynasty, ""New Dragon Gate Inn"" follows a group of characters, mostly warriors with swords, who arrive at the eponymous inn in the desert when a massive sandstorm is about to hit.

The story is often confusing with too many characters (with Kun Chen playing a double role), but what really disappointed me is action. First, after the impressive opening action set-piece opposite veteran Chia Hui Liu, Jet Li's swordsman Zhao (played by Tony Leung Ka Fai in the original) is practically absent from the story only to come back much later.

Besides the underused Jet Li, ""New Dragon Gate Inn,"" made with a 3D release in mind, suffers one major problem: overuse of visual effects. The production design is wonderful, and so is the costume, but if you want some creative and ingenious action sequence that occurs every few minutes, sorry, you just don't get that.

It seems Hark Tsui is more interested in computer graphics than martial arts choreography. It's his decision and I know I should respect that. I don't say the film is a letdown. It is just OK, but I just don't want an OK action film from Jet Li and Hark Tsui.",1359504000,5,2077,4.617886178861789
5110141,1,B007TZOD16,"Renown director Tsui Hark's the Flying Swords of Dragon Gate is a major milestone in Chinese cinema, not only is it the first wuxia movie to be filmed in 3-D, it is also the first to be exhibited in the IMAX format. Also it marks a reunion with Jet Li, the two previously made the staggering achievements of the Once Upon a Time in China trilogy, three remarkable films that if you haven't seen you should stop reading right now and go and find. So what a shame that it also happens to be one of the most mind numbingly awful pieces of junk this or any year.
 Vietnamese born, American educated, Chinese auteur Hark, who seemed to be on a comeback after the sharp and funny Detective Dee and the Mystery of the Phantom Flame, has made a movie that is all visual pizzazz, only it isn't that pizzazzy. The special effects are non-stop, however they all look phony, with characters moving like Spider-man and looking remarkably silly. The backgrounds, the martial arts action, it all looks like bad computer generation and will leave wuxia fans longing for the simple techniques used in the past.
 A sequel to Hark's 1992 production, Dragon Inn, which was directed by Raymond Lee, but Hark is said to have done some extensive directing uncredited on it. It was an awesome spectacle of wuxia (martial arts hero) action. It starred Maggie Cheung, Bridgette Lin and Donnie Yen. Even though it was a remake of a 1966 King Hu picture, it was full of thrills and imagination, which are both in sad abundance this time around.
 The cast, which this time around is also quite good, is lost in hard to follow situations, contrived developments and twists that would require me to watch this again to see if they make as little sense as I'm sure that they do. And no force on Earth could convince me to watch this again. The story is convoluted to the point of being incomprehensible to follow, there is an excess of characters and the movie takes over half of it's extensive two hour running time just setting things up.
 Taking place three years after the events of it's predecessor, it has to do with thieves and heroes all attempting to lay claim to a treasure inside a buried city. Nobody is who they claim to be, woman impersonate men unconvincingly while we have royal doubles and masked avengers. They all take refuge at the dragon gate inn to avoid a sandstorm, which of course, no one can resist going outside to fight in.
 Jet Li has little more to do than he did in his glorified cameo in the Expendables 2. He does have the first battle, with a sad looking cameoing Gordon Lui, and the last or at least next to last. I don't remember exactly because there are enough endings here to be the lost chapter of Lord of the Rings: Return of the King.
 The production design and art direction are great, the costumes, the sparse score and the wonderful cinematography aren't enough to overcome the recycled hackneyed nonsensical script by Hark. Towards the end one person declares ""well, it's hopeless."" He couldn't have been more correct. This is a bold, ambitious, tedious failure from a master filmmaker, it also stands as a landmark of missed opportunity.

5110146,4,B007TZOD16,"Forget the plot in this movie. I got this video mainly for its 3D effects. Most 3D videos are simply 2D to 3D convertibles and so are not much better than the 2D original. It's just another way for the studios to gouge the consumers by charging extra for them. This one is different and is comparable to Avatar. If you like 3D effects and action stuff, get this movie. Forget the plot. Extremely convoluted and confusing.

On a different note, I have a bone to pick with Amazon.com.  Bought this Bluray from Amazon.com, not a 3rd party seller, mind you. Amazon.com has dropped its price since initial purchase, but they won't refund me the difference because they only have a 7-day price match policy. Makes absolutely no sense to me. I'm still within the 30-day return period, so actually I can send the disc back and re-order it at a lower price. Amazon.com really dropped the ball on this one. They're collecting taxes now and only have a 7-day price match when most brick and mortar stores in my area (and probably every where else) have a 30-day price guarantee. Extremely disappointed with them. Probably never buy from them again. They're collecting taxes and have a shorter price guarantee. There's no advantage to buying from Amazon.com any more. Actually it's riskier now because of the shorter price match policy.",1357171200,4,1324,4.752173913043478
5110147,3,B007TZOD16,"Perhaps I was expecting too much from this film as I am 1) a huge Jet Li fan and 2) a huge Dragon Inn fan.  I didn't watch this film in 3D and perhaps if I had seen it in 3D it would have been better.  It seems like that is where they placed a lot of their focus.  That being said, the CGI in this film needs a lot of help...I find that a lot of Chinese movies are introducing more CGI but they are still a little behind the times.  I found the CGI quite distracting throughout the movie.  I'm okay with wire-fu, but with the ""help needed"" CGI, it just made the wire-fu seem off.

On to the good parts.  I like what they did with the story, a different take on the Dragon Inn with Donnie Yen, Maggie Cheung, Michelle Yeoh, etc.  The plot played out pretty good, the Eunuchs seemed particularly nefarious, the anti-hero proprietress was played very well, the barbarian gang wasn't as good as I would have liked, but they did OK.

5110155,3,B007TZOD16,"I gave the movie 3 stars which I feel is very fair.
First the bad ->
There is no story line, or I should say the story line changes about every 30 minutes and at the end of it all,
there really was no story whatsoever.
The sub titles go by way WAY too fast. Not only do they flash by too fast, but they are also written on light backgrounds
quite often and are very hard to read.
During some fights, they put some very cheesy music in the background that I found to be quite annoying.
During some of the fights, you could tell that the swords were just toys the way they bent all around.
The ending really concluded nothing at all. A very generic ending with no meaning to it.
Now the good ->
The fight scenes are choreographed very well.
The scenery is beautiful.
The women are very attractive.

5110156,5,B007TZOD16,"Viewing Equipment: Epson 3010 3D PJ on a 92"" Da-Lite screen. I just got done watching this and it blew my mind! The Chinese just schooled most American film makers and studios on how to really use 3D in a live-action movie. The only live action film that I have watched so far in 3D that this is comparable to is Avatar. Avatar has more jaw dropping visuals in 3D, but the action scenes in this film are truly spectacular and have to be seen to be believed. I would have loved to have watched this in Imax 3D. Holy smokes that must have been awesome!

The most negative thing about this movie is that the story telling is lacking at times leaving the viewer somewhat confused as to what is going on. The central premise of the plot remains the same throughout, so that helps. Unlike what the official Blu-ray.com reviewer alluded to; Jet Li has a solid supporting role in this film. He isn't the main star, but he is in a large portion of the film. This movie is very much an ensemble action piece. My big complaint with most 3D films is that they are conversions and aren't shot in native 3D. If you are going to charge a significant premium for 3D content than shoot the dang movies in native 3D, don't convert it! When I see Blu-Ray 3D conversions at retail stores and on-line being sold for $35-$40 I feel sick to my stomach. For every great conversion there are 10 that are just OK and nothing special. I have never understood professional reviewers who refer to pop-outs in 3D as gimmicky.  3D is all about utilizing the technology to tell your story and take it to a level that isn't otherwise possible and that includes scenes with objects that extend beyond the screen.  Films that use the technology to only display depth are missing a real opportunity in most cases.  Not taking advantage of what 3D is capable of is like having an exotic sports car and never testing its limits.

Once this movie got rolling I didn't want it to stop. Keep in mind that this movie is very much fantasy with characters flying around and doing things with super human strength very much like a comic book. Ghosting was an issue at times with the subtitles I was reading since the English dub just wasn't that great as usual so I left the English subtitles turned on for most of the film. The PQ, AQ, and 3D are an easy 5.0 on this release. If you own a 3D display, order this thing today! It's worth every penny and you will want to show it to your friends. It has a lot of replay value.

5110171,3,B007TZOD16,"It's been 23 years since Jet Li has worked with Tsui Hark and you'd expect something with better results or at least a final product that doesn't feel so cluttered. At times, it's difficult to distinguish the difference between the heroes and the villains. During the time of the Ming Dynasty, the emperor's eunuchs came into power and divided themselves into the East Bureau and the West Bureau. Eunuchs in both bureaus abused their power and were notorious for being some of the most corrupt individuals around, but the West Bureau was the more feared of the two. Stuck in the middle is a vigilante named Zhou Huai'an (Li), a skilled swordsman who rejects both Bureaus and desires order to be restored to the royal throne.

That summary doesn't sound all that complicated, but once Dragon Gate and its innkeepers are introduced along with Zhang Xiao Wen (Kwai Lun-mei) and her tribe and the wandering Gu Shaotang (Li Yuchun) and her traveling partner Wind Blade (Chen Kun) who looks exactly like the head of the West Bureau Yu Huatian (also played by Chen Kun) all while a mysterious woman named Ling Yanqiu (Zhou Xun) does her best to hide a former palace maid who's now pregnant and on the run named Su Huirong (Mavis Fan), things get more than a little convoluted very quickly.

The wuxia film isn't without its strengths though. The cinematography is stunning and is nearly as beautiful and as colorful as ""Hero"" at times. Colors, specifically reds, blues, and greens, leap off the screen and the extremely elaborate detail of the palace walls or the designs on someone's armor look only better in high definition. Wheat fields by the water, the sepia and dry tones of the desert, and its massive impressive landscapes are just a few examples of the film's incredibly absorbing camera work.

There are at least portions of the screenplay that are well-written; its best moments are in the first half of the film when someone is being threatened with their life. ""Give me some wine. Time to taste some pickled body parts,"" and Yu Huatian's speech about how he'll fix the East Bureau's botches are just a few examples.

All of the film's strengths are bogged down by its weaknesses though; the most guilty culprit being the wuxia itself. Most wuxia films are out of control as everyone is flying around with superhuman abilities that just leap over the line that divides the possible from the impossible. Many of the action sequences come off as goofy and extremely overzealous. If that isn't enough, the special effects will get to you.

Half the time, the people bouncing around the screen are completely computer generated and it's not even well done CG. Things like drops of blood and tables float in the air during the most heated battles. Add that along with everyone flying about and it's as if some weird anti-gravity setting was established for everyone but purposely left you in the dark about it. The entire second half of the film revolves around this massive sandstorm at Dragon Gate and these really bizarre looking yet menacing storm clouds. It sounds like it has potential, but nearly everything in the last hour is noticeably done in front of a green screen.

Having at least part of the final battle take place inside one of the several tornados caused by this sandstorm sounds pretty awesome, doesn't it? It turns out to be one of those ideas that sounds a hell of a lot better on paper as the execution comes off looking really cheap. The CG gets more and more heavy as the film progresses and it seems like things only get more and more ridiculous; not only visually but structurally as well.

In the middle of all this is this really bizarre, ""let's play hard to get for three years and act like we don't need each other"" love story between Zhou and Ling. Then the ending rolls around and just kind of leaves you hanging without much closure on most of the characters. Imagine hanging out with your best friend or significant other and your siblings, if you have any. The best friend tells you they're going to the store while your siblings say they're off to the park on the other side of town, but you never see any of them ever again. They're still at those locations and are still perfectly healthy. You just never bother seeing them ever again. Pretty crummy way to end a relationship, right?

""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"" looks spectacular during the scenes that were actually filmed traditionally, the screenplay at least seems to start off strong, and much of the action is extremely fast paced, so it's at least able to get your adrenaline pumping at times. Everything seems to crumble apart as soon as you try to compliment it though. The dodgy special effects really put a damper on everything as does the conclusion that doesn't really feel like it resolves much of anything. Although there is some enjoyment to be found in ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate,"" it's a wuxia film that is mostly very messy in every sense of the word.

Special features include Making of ""Flying Swords of Dragon Gate"" Part 1 (4:48) and Part 2 (9:16), Interviews with Cast and Filmmakers (20:21), Behind the Scenes (32:21), and the trailer. The only difference between the single-disc DVD and two-disc Blu-ray release of the film is the inclusion of the film in 3-D.",1349568000,10,5282,4.720173535791757

5110175,5,B007TZOD16,"This is labeled as region free. I am in the US. I have a Panasonic 3D player and a Toshiba 3D tv. The main feature played fine. Trailer #1 played fine. I did not try trailer #2.  When trying to play the other extras, such as behind the scenes/interviews, I got audio only, and the on screen message ""unsupported video signal"". Now I do have an Insignia player, a few years old, that I have been able to watch ""region free"" Dr Who and Torchwood blu rays on successfully. This did play the behind the scenes extras without any problems. So just be aware if you order this, there is a good chance that you may not be able to see the extras, depending upon your 3d player and tv.
As for the movie, it was great. The 3D effects were better than most US 3D movies I have watched, and I have seen dozens now. Looking forward to them making another one of these. Keep in mind that there is no English audio, however the show is just as watchable using the English subtitles, and I don't feel the subtitles detracted from the movie any anyway.",1339718400,7,1034,4.248730964467005
