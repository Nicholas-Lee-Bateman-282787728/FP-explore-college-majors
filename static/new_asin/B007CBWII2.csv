Don't confuse this JABBERWOCK with Terry Gilliam's 1977 cult classic JABBERWOCKY, although, okay, both films are loosely based on the nonsense poem from Lewis Carroll's THROUGH THE LOOKING-GLASS.

If you'd been wondering what's become of Tahmoh Penikett - he of BATTLESTAR GALACTICA and DOLLHOUSE notoriety - well, it got ugly. You can find him in this Syfy action fantasy from 2011. The film sets itself in medieval trappings, so go ahead and marvel at the contemporary diction.

- ""What's your weapon of choice?""
- ""My wits.""
- ""You're gonna need something sharper.""

Medieval banter. Awesome.

Penikett plays a blacksmith named Francis who eventually gets called to action when a dragon bedevils his village and carries away the sister of his unspoken crush. I say ""eventually"" because he's not one of them hot-blooded villagers who leaps at the chance to venture into the badlands and go dragonslaying. Francis has always been the stay-at-home type, unlike his older, more adventurous brother, Alec (Michael Worth). Anyway, brace yourself for a deluge of familiar declaratives like ""We ride at dawn,"" ""Follow your heart,"" and the ever-popular ""This ends now, now.""

Several sub-plots aim to tug at your heartstrings or at least lend character development: Francis and Alec's sibling rivalry, Francis' aforementioned yen for the village beauty (Kacey Barnfield), and Francis's reluctance to heed his dying father's last wish (something about finishing an impenetrable battle armor). But it's hard to buy into the sincerity of the film. Not when the script is poor like this. And the pace plods like this. The action is desultory. The CGI is crap. ""The jaws that bite, the claws that catch"" - the shoestring budget doesn't allow for such f/x-generated actions from this sketchily-rendered jabberwock. Characters make really dumb choices. The final showdown with the jabberwock is anticlimactic and over all too abruptly. The cast resembles the staff of a medieval theme park. And then there's Penikett's stiff acting. He is so wooden that cigar store Indians grow alarmed. He's more deadpan than a decapitated faun god. Beware the Jabberwock, my son! Beware the frumious Bandersnatch and also the Syfy made-for-television movie.

Tips on how to defeat the jabberwock as gleaned from these villagers:

- Nothing beats clinging to the cliffside as the ideal field condition when taking on the jabberwock.
- When safe behind a structure but freaked out by that jabberwock circling overhead, by all means, go ahead and try to run across open ground. That won't expose you.
- When stabbing all the jabberwock eggs to death, don't bother to poke around the nest. I'm sure you got them all at first try.
- It's always handy to have a village philosopher who can recite helpful passages from that poem.
- If you are brothers and would-be heroes, don't forget to get in a silly sword fight for the honor of who gets to lead the fight against the jabberwock.
- The jabberwock's archnemesis will always be an overgrown wooden mouse trap.

By the way, if you decide you're interested in this DVD anyway, be very aware of what Region format the DVD is in (if you're living in the U.S. of A., you'll want Region 1). Else, you risk incompatibility with your DVD player.",1390089600,,3428,4.991243432574431

It kept skipping and pausing. That interfered with dialogue, etc.  I was disappointed...the movie is hard to find.",1350345600,,272,4.211538461538462
