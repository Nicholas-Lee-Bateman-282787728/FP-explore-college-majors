8050050,2,B0007P0YBS,"The dialog of this film is hormonal, temperamental, skittish, erratic, and most of the time nonsensical. The Girls Room is written by a female and this may explain these things. The blocky, clunky, scene fade in and fade outs is very aggravating and amature. Low budget film with trendy wardrobe attire and artsy lighting for it's generation now in current times outdated but yet nostalgic. Soleil is the lead actor for which the story devolves around, no reason does the viewer get to be drawn to her character unless you are attracted to her physically and in that she has never looked better than in this film. She plays a floosie, a vapid, self indulged, i can do no wrong while everything and everyone else around me is always wrong. She is a foul-mouthed, sex-crazed, college student with no purpose than to just exist and get high. This seems all fine and dandy until there are no real sex scenes to speak of. A lot of sex talk and sex overtones is all we get here. This character is very confused as is the plot and meaning of this entire film. A try to be art house film which is not arty enough. A try to be deep-introspective, intellectual film, which is not near intellectual just a pseudo hipster english class of jumbled thesaurus phrases like a spoken word coffee house poetry jam for an hour and a half that is painful to endure to its end. I say avoid this over-inflated, big ego, big headed, flat film, unless you are absolutely hellbound to see Soleil look very attractive but very very fully dressed for the entire film. Moody and melancholy, with no depth or plot. As one amazon review here is quoted ""not a chic flick"" B.S.> MY FRIENDS THIS IS A TOTAL CHIC FLICK AND A BAD ONE. 2 Stars for Soleil looking her all time best and the early 00's generation hipster style's that are a pleasant throwback to a simpler time.",1483833600,,1839,4.492537313432836

8050052,5,B0007P0YBS,"I enjoyed watching this movie, really liked the storyline.  There is a scene when Grace is looking for her notebook where she had some notes for the test, and Casey is off at a club w/ her friends.  There is this really cool song playing, that Casey is dancing too.  I love that song!  Does anyone know what song that is?",1158192000,,321,4.213114754098361
8050053,5,B0007P0YBS,"I first heard about this film quite a while ago, and have wanted to see it for a very long time. I am a very big fan of Soleil Moon Frye, and she is the main reason I wanted to see it. When I saw that it was released on DVD I was extremely happy.

From the moment the film started, I was drawn in, and I stayed drawn in until the end. Casey's (Soleil Moon Frye) opening and ending monologue was great, and an awesome way to open and end the movie. The ending is very good, and it leaves you feeling complete. The movie is really about two college roomates who are very different. It is about one of them wanting revenge on the other. The movie is very real, and that, to me, is very refreshing.

The only problem I had with the film was the editing. It is very choppy, and isn't put together all that well, but it isn't a big problem. I only thought about it during a few scenes.

The two main characters are compelling. I have to say that Soleil gives the best performance in the film. The other lead, Cat Taber (who plays Grace), was good, but it felt like her performance was missing something. The other actors were all great as well (Notably Wil Wheaton as Grace's fiance, and Gary Wolf as Casey's friend).

The DVD has no extras at all, though. It only has the film and scene selections (a total of 8 chapters), and if you leave it on the main menu for too long, the movie starts by itself. The lack of extras doesn't bother me, though. It took the film long enough to get released.

While this movie isn't for everyone, I loved it, and will watch it more than once. The DVD doesn't seem to be a big release, so you may have a hard time finding a rental, but it is well worth the purchase price here! If you are a fan of one of the actors, this is a must have DVD!

In closing, I would like to say ""How nice, How very, very nice!""",1119484800,5,1836,4.058011049723757
8050054,4,B0007P0YBS,"College roomies Casey (Frye) and Grace (Taber) are a contempo odd couple. Casey, a quasi goth bohemian-esque performance artist with a penchant for bad boys,sex,profanity and pot, garbs herself in black and heavy mascara. Preppy good girl Grace just wants to ace her classes and wed her frat boy Romeo (Wil Wheaton). When Casey's obnoxious taunts and schemes put Grace's plans in jeopardy, she resolves to get even.

The Girls' Room"" nicely develops its characters, resisting the urge to limit them as easy stereotypes. Nor does Amanda Beall's script demonize either character. Casey, it turns out, knows she was dealt a bad hand from the start, whereas Grace subtly begins to question her sheltered Southern upbringing.

Girls room is way more than a chick flick.do to the fact that its verry understandable no matter what gender or race you are.its more or less implies that sheltered well off people have issues too and that their not always the antagonizers like in most mediums.though i don't belive people really denied that,we know that rich sheltered girls have issues aswell.though to be blunt i will say their not the same as everyday people problems but i digress.

Both women are flawed, to be sure, but despite their surface antagonism, each harbors a real desire to explore the other's life. Their mutual attraction-repulsion keeps the tension percolating and thankfully leaves some surprises for the final reel. The characters ultimately emerge in the script as wholly rounded and,as realized in Taber and Frye's empathetic performances, neither easy to like nor completely despicable",1116547200,,1599,5.189922480620155
8050055,5,B0007P0YBS,Punky Brrewster fans will love this film!  Soliel Moon Frye is so hot!  A funny and touching coming of age story about two college roommates who are complete opposties.  It's a story about friendship and figuring out who you are and where you want to go in life.  I bought this for my 20 year old sis in college and she loved it!  I thought it was well directed too.  I think this is the director's first film.  Well done!!,1116115200,2,423,4.2125
