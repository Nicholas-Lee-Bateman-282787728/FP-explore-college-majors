8594392,3,B000GY8ZBQ,"Bad Girls Series 8 the final of the series. This series which is completely filled with plot holes. Fans are left with answered questions. What happened with Di Barker? What happened to certain characters? Answers that we fans deserve to know.

This series focuses and introduces new characters. The doctor and the new manager. A storyline that was really borning. Some really great storylines like the final fight between Pat and Natalie. One truly touching story that involves Sylvia and Tina. Darlene Cake, a storyline that shows her vulnerablity.

The series ends on a good note.",1451433600,,583,5.0625
8594393,4,B000GY8ZBQ,"LAST SERIES, AND WAS DEFINITELY TIME TO END. WORTH WATCHING FOR ALL BAD GIRLS FANS, BUT THE SHOW DEFINITELY HAD CHANGED A LOT BY THIS TIME, AND WITH ONLY ORIGINAL CHARACTERS SYLVIA, AND THE TWO JULIE'S.. ALL NEW CHARACTURES IN THIS SEASON. VERY TOUCHING SCENES REVOLVING SYLIVA & TINA O'KANE REALLY MADE THIS SERIES SPECIAL, AND WAS A GREAT WAY TO END THE SHOW IN MY OPINION. I DID NOT LIKE HOW DI BARKER WAS NOT EVEN MENTIONED AFTER THE PREVIOUS SERIES ENDING WITH HER IN LARKHALL FOR SUPPOSEDLY KILLING JIM FENNER. SERIES 8 MOVES VERY VERY FASTLY IT WILL BE NOTICED AND THAT SHOWS THAT THE CREATORS, PRODUCERS, AND DIRECTORS WERE TRYING TO FIT TOO MUCH INTO AN HOUR SHOW, AND IT JUST FELT VERY PUSHED AND RUSHED IN MY OPINION. THE NEW DOCTOR WAS A NICE TOUCH, AND THE STORYLINES REVOLVING AROUND HIM ARE INTERESTING, BUT THE STORYLINES WITH SYLVIA (AGAIN GOING BACK TO THE ORIGINALITY OF THE SHOW) WERE DEFINITELY THE BEST IN MY OPINION. MY FAVE SERIES OF BAD GIRLS ARE 1-6 WITH SERIES 4 & 5 BEING MY FAVORITES, BUT ALL IN ALL THIS IS A MUST FOR A DIE HARD BAD GIRLS FAN TO OWN FOR THEIR COLLECTION. NOTE: THIS IS ONLY AVAILABLE IN PAL VERSION DVD, SO YOU MUST HAVE A MULTI REGION OR REGION FREE DVD PLAYER IN ORDER TO PLAY THESE. US ONLY RELEASED SERIES ONE.",1341360000,,1261,4.370212765957447
8594394,1,B000GY8ZBQ,"I was very disappointed in this, the last season of Bad Girls.  In season seven Jim Fenner was murdered
and his estranged wife was arrested for the crime.  Yet, at no time during season eight is anything said
about what the autopsy/toxicology reports might have revealed and Di is never season in any of the episodes.
During the first seven seasons there was Fenner, Di, Sylvia, and Dr. Nicholson, but by season eight only
Sylvia remains. The lack of that ensemble cast made season eight very bland and uninteresting.",1289001600,,517,4.797752808988764
