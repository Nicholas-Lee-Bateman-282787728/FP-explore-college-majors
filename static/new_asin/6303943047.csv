740593,5,6303943047,"I am a long-tim fan of power rangers, the whole idea of them. MMPR was good, Zeo was better, Turbo was below average. I was ready to give up on PR until Power Rangers in Space came out. To this day, keep in mind I am turning fifteen, and I still like Power Rangers in Space. The movie is awesome, but some parts are cut out. Power Rangers in space had everything that most current incarnations fail to reach.

Acting- Above Power Ranger average.

Action- Best before and hasn't been beat yet.

Storyline- Worthy of an award

I know Saban had a habit of chaning them every year, but they should start a PRIS 2",1112832000,6,608,4.260869565217392

I liked the megavoyager, athe astromegaship (WHich was destroyed in a future season) and the other one that zane had. I still watch the show and i am only 16. Know they finally brought back a good character back. I wounder if they will bring back the rest in future seasons?",1088208000,3,413,4.447368421052632

RANGERS GONE PSYCHO
Five imposters are wreaking havok throughout Angel Grove as Power Rangers. The real Rangers confront them, and they reveal themselves to be the Psycho Rangers, maniacal machines sent by Astronema. The Psychos read the Rangers' minds, and prove to be difficult to defeat with this knowledge of the Rangers' fighting techniques.
A RIFT IN THE RANGERS
Ashley and Cassie have a quarrel over doing chores on the Megaship. Psycho Yellow and Pink manage to capture Ashley.
FIVE OF A KIND
TJ comes up with a way to defeat the Psycho Rangers. Since they are designed to fight their respective Ranger color, the Rangers all disguise themselves as the Blue Ranger, and to confuse them even further, Zhane jumps in as Psycho Silver.
SILENCE IS GOLDEN
The Psycho Rangers scour the city in search of the civilian Rangers, using voice recognition. Cassie is in town, and must remain quiet to avoid being found.
THE ENEMY WITHIN
The Psycho Rangers have stolen the Mega Voyager. To get it back, the Power Rangers launch a surprise attack on the Psychos.",1045526400,16,1079,4.869565217391305
740596,3,6303943047,"Out of all the episodes from Power Rangers In Space, Saban had to pick the Psycho Ranger saga! I'm not saying the Psycho Ranger saga was bad, but it's not the best either. Countdown To Destruction should of been put on video or the Ninja Turtles/Space Rangers team up, ect... Countdown To Destruction was the best 2 part episode ever. This was the best team ever! And they deserved a great video, not a pretty good video.",1016064000,3,421,4.48051948051948
740597,3,6303943047,"Having gotten my copy of ""Power Rangers In Space: The Movie"" a couple of years ago, I am frankly surprised that they would actually edit the episodes (and even cut one whole episode out) and downsized them to fit a movie plotline.
I like the video, it's just it would have better if they had tried to at least make a miniseries on Fox or make it into a made-for-TV movie.
PRiS is actually a great series, it's just that the Psycho series isn't actually the episodes that would be worth editing and composing into a feature-length ""movie."" The plot itself is intriguing and semi-original, the acting is terrific, but actually, the first two to three episodes would be worth editing or even better, the last three episodes of ""Countdown to Destruction."" It wraps up things more fully and is a welcome relief to the usual end to a seasonal PR series.
If you like PRiS, this movie is for you. If you're a PRiS fan who actually thinks this is a full-length movie, better pass this up.",1012089600,4,979,4.50561797752809
740598,1,6303943047,This is a VERY bad video. The new Power Rangers don't get fame. The Mighy Morphin is STILL the best. SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,1005436800,,152,5.6521739130434785
740599,4,6303943047,"With the recovery of Power Rangers during Power Rangers in Space, a video release was obviously inevitable.  Looking at the various episodes they had to work with, Saban chose the saga of the Psycho Rangers, edited it to  flow, and released it on video.  All in all, the Psycho Saga was a pretty  good piece of Power Rangers in Space.  Unfortunately, they cut out a few  key scenes to save time and money, and they even stripped a full episode of  the saga because it wasn't important to the storyline.  The video just  doesn't do justice to the show, so if you have the Psycho Saga on tape  directly from its original airing, don't buy this tape.  If you don't like  Power Rangers, DEFINITELY DON'T BUY THIS TAPE!  It's not a bad tape, but I  wish we'd have gotten the original four-part ""Countdown to  Destruction"" series on tape instead.",963014400,,840,4.543624161073826
740600,5,6303943047,The Power Rangers are still at it. Still going strong and still fighting evil forces of the universe. The Power Rangers In Space series is much better than the other series. That's why I give it 5 stars!,952819200,,203,4.368421052631579
740639,1,6303943047,""" More Action... More Power...More Fun! "" The Power Rangers are back in this all-new feature-length made for home video movie release.  Power Rangers in Space trys to redeem its already waining popularity by  realeasing four TV episodes on video. And claiming that it's an ""  All-New Feature-Length Movie "".  Based on the 1997 popluar Japanese  live action show called "" Denji Sentai Mega Ranger "" The story  for the Power Rangers in Space trys to follow simliarly the story to Mega  Rangers.  In the original Mega Ranger episodes the evil Dr. Henila, of the  twisted dimension, creates a new group of soliders made from the cells of  his leader named Javilous. These new soldiers are called the Neiji Rangers.  Dr. Henilar trys to drain the power from Javilous by letting  each of his  Neiji Rangers be destryed by the Mega Rangers. Javilous will then become  weaker and weaker until finlay he is dead. After which the evil Dr. Henilar  will become the new ruler of the "" Twisted Dimension "". In this  adaption of Mega Rangers, Power Rangers in space follows the original  episode, almost, to the "" T "". But VERY waterd down. I think the  editers at Saban Entertainment used a fire house on the Mega Rangers show.  In one episode of the original Mega Rangers, Mega Pink was upset at Mega  Yellow for dating her sweet heart Mega Blue. In the adaption here for  video, Mega Pink was mad at Mega Yellow for being messy. Gee Wiz! The  producers at Saban asumes one thing, AMERICAN KIDS ARE STUPID. On thing I  have learned rising a kid is that "" Kids are smarter than you think  "". Parents! Don't but this video! Get a video that will educate your  kids like Carl Sagan's Cosmos Series. Not a dumped-down Japanes live aciton  show. Give kids a break.  Over all I give this made for home video release  F- to the negitive, negitive power. Poor dubbing and sloppy editing.",944352000,,1867,4.575757575757576
740640,1,6303943047,"It's JUST EPISODES FROM THE SHOW -- not a movie. Yes, they're wrapped up into a nice package without commercials, but anyone could do this with 2 VCRs, a play button, and a record button. I think it's cruel to call it  ""Power Rnagers in Space: The Movie"" when it's not even the BEST  episodes from PRiS (""Countdown to Destruction""). I mean, come on.  I recorded all these myself before when they were on the show. It's kind of  cruel to kids to label it a ""movie"", and it turns out to be the  same exact episodes they saw on TV.

But it played fine in my Blu-ray player with mostly clear picture and I was delighted.... until I noticed the sound. Interspersed throughout the DVD (usually during fight sequences), the sound would noticeably change from the English track to the German track. If the voice actors dubbing in German sounded like the American cast for Power Rangers in Space, it would not be so bad but... IT IS VERY NOTICEABLE. So take this into consideration when buying this particular DVD. I hope that Saban will release this DVD set for the United States soon.",1360800000,2,663,4.724137931034483

She still likes this movie although she admits that watching it now is kind of funny because computer animation has come such a long way since this movie was made. I also believe that age plays a big role because a young child will see the movie differently than a teenager. I think kids will still like this movie, especially if they are into Power Rangers.",1258848000,,572,4.153153153153153
