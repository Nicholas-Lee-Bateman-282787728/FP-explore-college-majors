7953665,4,B00005T7G0,"Modern music and NFL action are combined to great effect in this mostly enjoyable video. The Kurt Warner, Marshall Faulk, John Randle and Peyton Manning/Marvin Harrison videos were particularly good and my sons (ages 10 & 8) and I have watched them repeatedly.  ""Sounds of the Game"" and ""Announcer's Radio Rap"" are also a lot of fun. These videos are great to watch to get ""psyched-up"" before a game or workout.  Unfortunately, there is a fair amount of ""filler"" on the DVD. I think many of the interview sections are pretty worthless ( but can be quickly skipped on DVD!). A few more player videos would have put this over the top... but as is, definitely worth a look.",1024876800,2,670,4.621848739495798
