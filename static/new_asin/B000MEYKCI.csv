They made demand (for me at least) for the DVDs one of great proportion.  The movies themselves were very enjoyable.  Each one had a nice amount of gore and horror, and each was different in its own way.

2729394,4,B000MEYKCI,"Since there is a plot description already on the page I'm gonna skip the rehash and get into my thoughts on the movie.

Reincarnation is the 3rd part of the J-Horror Series, which follows Infection and Premonition. Each movie though is standalone with nothing to do with the previous.

But Reincarnation was released as part of the After Dark Horror Fest as one of the 8 films to die for.

Takashi Shimizu is at it again with another ghost movie. While the movie differs from his Ju-on movies they do have a similar tone. For fans of Asian horror you should know what to expect by now.

After seeing the South Korean flick The Red Shoes I decided to take a long break from these movies. While none of them have been terrible movies, my only thought was I already saw this. So after months of avoiding these types of movies I figured it was time to check them out again.

Reincarnation isn't a perfect movie and can be slow at times, but Director Shimizu does a good job at keeping the movie interesting. While not as suspenseful as Ju-on: The Grudge, Shimizu manages to get the best out of every scene, even if it lacks the atmosphere Ju-on had.

That's not to say Reincarnation doesn't have atmosphere, it does, but just plays out as little slower. Bottom line is you aren't getting anything you haven't seen before.

The style is your typical Asian horror movie; but where some of the other films failed with too many clich&eacute;s, Director Shimizu is able to take all of them and still make an entertaining movie.

There may not be a lot of creativity left, but with the right filmmaker they can still take it and make it something enjoyable. The highlight of the movie is Yuka who plays Nagisa Sugiura.

Not only is she really cute, but she plays her role to near perfection. When she supposed to be afraid Yuka looks absolutely terrified. And without a doubt she has one of the best screams in recent memory.

Some scenes that by right really shouldn't have worked play out creepy due to Yuka looking so terrified. While Director Shimizu crafted some excellent scenes with a lesser actress I don't think they would have worked as well.

Reincarnation has restored by faith in the Asian ghost flick, while no doubt we have seen this movie done a number of times and I have to say that scenes that would have worked well a couple of years ago don't work quite as well, but one thing showed is that an enjoyable and some what creepy movie can still be done even with the clich&eacute;s.

The pacing though can be slow; while Ju-on wasn't exactly fast paced it did have a lot of haunting and a lot of dread. Reincarnation while does have some of that can run a bit slower.

You'll either be intrigued like I was or you might find yourself a little bored, it really can go either way. The final act can be a bit confusing, but if you pay attention you can and will make sense out what just happened.

Fans of Asian horror might wanna check this out; assuming you liked Takashi Shimizu's Japanese horror you might like this one then as well.

In closing Reincarnation features the clich&eacute;s that have brought down these Asian flicks the past couple of years, but it's about how you handle it.

Director Shimizu handles it right and like I said makes an enjoyable and some what creepy movie despite the clich&eacute;s. And along with Yuka a lot of scenes really play out better than they might have with another actress.

Reincarnation doesn't reinvent the ghost sub-genre and doesn't really offer us anything we haven't seen, but when all is said and done it's a well crafted horror flick with some good atmosphere and a good scare or 2.",1175126400,33,3643,4.528963414634147
2729395,4,B000MEYKCI,"""Reincarnation"" (""Rinne"") begins with three people having strange and unsettling experiences, each of which is different.  Then a movie update on the radio informs us that the director Matsumara is making a new movie called ""Memories,"" based on ""the most brutal indiscriminating murders in Showa's history at a hotel in Gunma.""  In the 1970s a professor named Omori murdered 11 people at the hotel, including his two children.  Then we meet Ikuo Matsumura (Kippei Shiina) and learn that not only is he going to make a movie about this crime, he is going to film it at the hotel and recreate each of the murders on the spots where they actually happened.

For&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Cold-Blood/dp/B0000AN4JE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""In Cold Blood""</a>&nbsp;director Richard Brooks filmed in all of the original locations, including the Clutter House, so it is not like this is unprecedented. More recently (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bobby/dp/B000MEYJI8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Bobby"")</a>&nbsp;filmed a few scenes at the Ambassador Hotel where Robert Kennedy was assassinated during the hotel's demolition).  But there is something inherently unsettling about re-enacting murders at the actual locations and ""Reincarnation"" certainly taps into those emotions.  Even without out the ghostly encounters in the film's prologue, the director's announcement that they will be going to the actual hotel creeps you out long before they actually get there and he starts posing actors as corpses.  Of course after watching&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Odishon/dp/B0009WFEDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Odishon""</a>&nbsp;any audition scene in a Japanese horror film gives me the creeps.

Because we are dealing with the conception of reincarnation, albeit as some form of possession, the ""ghosts"" of this film are not really ""onryo,"" the Japanese ghost (""yurei"") bound to the physical world by a desire for vengeance, so this is significantly different from what we have seen in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ringu/dp/B000088NQR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Ringu""</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Honogurai-Mizu-No-Soko-Kara/dp/B0009KA2UO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Honogurai Mizu No Soko Kara""</a>, and of course director Takashi Shimizu's best known film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ju-on-The-Grudge/dp/B00005JNJR/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Ju-on (The Grudge).""</a>&nbsp;Except for the religious ceremony the cast and crew go through before they begin filming and the distinctive slanted tile roof of the hotel, there are not a lot of particularly Japanese elements to this movie and a more ""western"" approach might not be something fans want to see (you will probably be thinking&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Shining/dp/B00005ATQJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""The Shining""</a>&nbsp;more than anything else for most of this one).

The focal character in the story becomes Nagisa Sugiura (Yuka), who is picked to play the little girl who was the last to die at her father's hand.  The screenplay by Shimizu and Masaki Adachi does have some other elements to flesh out this horror story, like the creepy child's doll that likes to announce, ""We'll stay together, forever.""  But the fact that the original killer filmed the murders as he was committing them becomes a key ingredient in this movie's endgame and I like a lot of what Shimizu did in the film's climax, which cuts between both time and space as the movie crew films the murders, the cast becomes the victims, and a producer watches the original film of the murders.  This is a film where I found the payoff to be better than the setup, which is better than the other way around, a fact confirmed by dozens of less successful horror films.  I also liked the double-denouement, which was far and away the best ending of any of the Horrorfest 2006 films and on a par with that of ""Honogurai mizu no soko kara,"" so I actually consider ""Rinne"" to be far superior to ""Ju-On"" in terms of Shimizu's films even if it produces less actual scary moments.

One of the reasons I liked ""Reincarnation"" is as I was sitting in the theater watching it as the opening film for the After Dark Horrorfest I was thinking that clearly this film wants us to think ""A,"" but that what would be interesting would be if it were ""B"" instead.  The more I played out my hypothesis the more I was convinced that I was correct, a fact confirmed by the movie's endgame.  One of the fun parts of Horrorfest 2006 was doing a post mortem on each film when it finished, and nobody else said they had seen the ending coming so it should surprise you too, and even if it does not you should like the direction this film ends up taking.  ""Reincarnation"" is the third film in producer Takashige Ichise's six part J-Horror Theater series, following&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infection-Kansen/dp/B0007XBM8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Infection"" (""Kansen"")</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Premonition-Yogen/dp/B0009KQOZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">""Premonition"" (""Yogen"")</a>, which is proving to be well worth checking out.

DVD Special Features:  There is a brief introduction from the director and a pair of featurettes, ""The Making of 'Reincarnation'"" and ""Memories of 'Reincarnation,'"" to go along with the deleted scenes (which have commentary, although the movie itself does not).  This is an above average collection of bonus features for a Horrorfest 2006 DVD, but nothing stood out enough to justify rounding up on the DVD overall.  I never complain about having to read subtitles for a movie, but for some reason on these sorts of featurettes I get distracted.  Go figure",1175040000,11,6046,6.198327359617682
2729396,4,B000MEYKCI,"After reading several of the reviews posted for this product, I noticed that many people rate it simply because of the price, and fewer for the actual films contained in the set.  Since my wife manages the local Blockbuster, we were fortunate enough to be able to watch all seven of these films for free before they were released to the public.

And I have to say, even though I have already seen them for free, I still forked over the 100+ dollars to own the set.  Why?

Every fan of horror films knows the unfathomable despair one sinks into when they bring home the latest direct-to-video flick, slide it into their DVD player, curl up on the sofa with some popcorn and beer, only to be subjected to the worst piece of filth ever to call itself a film.  And Lion's Gate is guilty of producing such garbage on many occasions.

Not this time, however.  I thoroughly enjoyed each of the films in the set -- ranging from creepy ghost stories, to unique twists on the vampire and zombie genres, to a classic slasher/body-count flick.  All of the films exhibted a quality of filmmaking that is definitely a cut above the average low-budget fair.  Not one film, in my opinion, was plagued with unbelievable actors and horrible plot structures -- something that is all too common in the genre.  In fact, the only criticism I could muster about any of these is that most of them are a little too slow-paced for my liking.  They all have massive story build-ups that make you wonder how, exactly, there's going to be room for actual scares.

But eventually, each of the films delivers, in its own way.

""Unrest"" is the story of a med student who learns that the body her student group is supposed to dissect may actually be cursed.  The highlight of this one, according to the trailer, is that it is the first horror film ever to use real dead bodies.  Maybe this is where the ""too shocking for general audiences"" comes in?  I didn't know this when I first watched the film, and was in awe at how realistic the bodies actually were.

""Penny Dreadful"" is the tale of a young girl who has a phobia of cars.  Throw in a lunatic who learns this, and you have a film that takes place almost entirely in a car, where Penny is trapped by said loony and is subjected to his horrific games.  This film is higher on tension than scares, and fans of Hitchcock should get into it (if they can handle the blood, that is).

""The Hamiltons"" takes us into the home of a group of young adults who are trying to make it after the deaths of both parents.  Think of the old TV show ""Party of Five"".  Only, added to the five are the young girls these people have chained up under the house.  I don't know what else to say without giving the story away -- but the internal conflict with the one Hamilton son as he grapples with the twisted nature of his siblings makes for some refreshing drama that horror rarely explores.

""The Gravedancers"" follows along the same theme as ""Unrest"": that is, don't disrespect the dead.  When a group of old friends get together at the funeral of one of their departed comrades, they engage in a little drunken grave dancing -- which, of course, upsets the souls beneath.  Truly frightening ghosts and some neat special effects highlight this tale -- but, as I said before, it is a little slow-moving, and the main male character is oddly cast.  He's like an ex-body builder/deadpan surfer -- and we're supposed to believe he's an attorney?

""Wicked Little Things"" has us follow a family of three who, after the father passes away, inherits a house in the mountainous backwoods.  Unfortunately, the area is haunted by a group of flesh-eating kids whose deaths in a mining accident in the early 1900's were never resolved.  The setting is definitely creepy (old house in the woods near an older, abondoned haunted mansion?  Who could ask for more?), and the kids, with their blood-stained lips and beady, black eyes are -- well -- if you think kids are kind of spooky anyway, these will really mess with your head.

The slasher fare comes in with ""Dark Ride"".  It centers around an old horror ride, one where you get in the cart and ride along the tracks to see all the creepy attractions.  Only, this particular ride delivers what everyone secretly fears when getting on one of these things:  the ride stops, and you are hunted by some crazy killer.  Throw in a group of brainless college students, a killer whose face is actually quite disturbing, and let the good times roll.  There are some truly memorable scenes here, and the film is quite gory.  But, slashers aren't really my thing.  Even so, this is one of the better ones.

Finally, ""Reincarnation"" is another installment by Takashi Shimizu (creator of ""The Grudge"" series).  This film was my least favorite of the bunch.  I'm not really a fan of ""The Grudge"", basically because the plot jumps around so much and the story does little to help the viewer easily follow along.  ""Reincarnation"" is more of the same here.  Fans of J-Horror will find little that is new, and may actually be bored at how repetitive it is.  But, it has a neat ending -- one that actually makes up for how boring the beginning is.  I don't want to do a plot synopsis out of fear of giving something away (and revealing that I know very little about what actually happened in the movie!)  Basically, if you like J-Horror, you'll probably like this one.

Okay, that's it!  Hope this was helpful to some.  The 4-stars have nothing to do with the price.  I think you get a variety of decent films that are entertaining and unique enough to satisfy almost anyone.",1174953600,171,5599,4.532402791625125
2729397,1,B000MEYKCI,"After Dark's ""Horrorfest"" as they titled it was only a horror fest because almost every movie in this set was not at all what you were promised.

There really is no ""Too Shocking for general audiences""!

The shock actually comes from the fact that most of these lackluster movies actually made it on to the silver screen.

After Dark is Lion's Gate's red headed stepchild, it took a hell of a blow releasing these, Lion's gate saw opportunity to make money, it marketed these films completely under false pretense and cashed in while audience members we're left unhappy and ripped off.

the only good ones with any decent content we're The Gravedancers, and Reincarnation, every other one with the exception of the Abandoned (which i saw twice) was a true borefest.

Penney Dreadful being number one as far as bad filmmaking goes.

it has a good story, although it could be considered rehashed, it does it in a sorta original way. the ending did make the hairs on my arms stand and i was thankful for that. some parts are a bit disturbing, and it kept my interest the entire time.

Interesting.  Confusing.  The English subtitles that whiz by don't really help.  And while the visuals are suitably creepy, they're not particularly scary.

First, you should know this is a slow paced horror film that relies on its haunting atmosphere and creepy imagery. If you're watching this in the right setting/environment, the film can be very hypnotizing- very suspenseful and terrifying. There are many excellent, memorable scenes; I particularly can't get the creepy doll out of my head. The film has a few twists thanks to its use of reincarnation. There are a few moments where I felt a bit lost, but I eventually got back on track so it wasn't really a significant problem. The acting was great, and the music matched the tone of the film.

Overall, fans of slow, suspenseful, and creepy horror films shouldn't miss Reincarnation; I highly recommend a purchase for fans of type of horror, a rental otherwise because the pace may not be for everyone.

2729473,4,B000MEYKCI,"SPOILERS ALERT!  (I'm adding some light Spoilers in my review....but not the ending)

I have to confess that this movie absorbed me.  I truly hated it the first time
I viewed it on cable (free, on-demand).  I couldn't figure it out at all;  there were
so many things going on without any real understaning of why.

The movie seemed to first be a ""Haunting"";  then it was about people making a movie
about a mass murder:  then it flipped to people showing up in the actual hotel
and being haunted (they didn't drive there they simply showed up);  people died
without us actually seeing a killer;  The present and past victims morphed into each
other.  oh yeah, there was an evil doll.

After watching that, I was determined to watch again to figure it all out.  Then I
got hooked.  The visuals were unique to me because this is the first time I've watched
a Japanese Horror movie.  The subtitles weren't a problem on the DVD.

I have to say that this odd Japanese movie was fascinating to me.  It was also annoying
and distressing (we see two children being murdered).

The twist toward the end came as a complete surprise to me, especially since I was already
confused.  We see the murderer in reflection, and the present murderer is revealed.",1336521600,3,1243,4.542986425339366

2729475,4,B000MEYKCI,"some of these after dark filmfest things turn out pretty good, some not so much. it's still a craps-shoot. but this film is worth a look. i've been growing fond of japanese horror flicks. they definitely have a different perspective. and they still manage to deliver a few good scares. i was first drawn to this flick when i heard it was directed by the same guy who did 'the grudge', Takashi Shimizu. i liked the americanized version of that movie with sarah michelle gellar (whom i still have a bit of a crush on). my main problem with reincarnation is that there was no english voice-over. you had to watch it in japanese with english subtitles, which can be a bit distracting.  i had to watch it at least 3 times before i could piece it all together. (given the director, i expected it to be originally shot in japanese, but i was expecting a voice-over in english). once you figure it out, it's a pretty decent 4-star horror flick. the premise of a film director taking a fresh approach to reenacting a true mass-murder event and being interrupted by ghosts of the victims (that's not entirely how it works in the film, but you have to watch it to get it) was a respectable 4-star premise that was delivered in a fascinating series of events as the story unfolds. of course it's hard to rate the acting ability of actors who are speaking in a foreign language, but they seemed to be presenting themselves in reasonably believable form.....so the acting seemed fine, especially in the screaming-scary parts. Decent special effects....the japanese tend to be a bit behind us in this field, but they did a good, reasonable job of making things look real. there were a few good surprises and chilling moments and things to make you jump or give you the creeps.....like when the kid's doll comes to life. and that little 6-year-old girl was very good at being creepy......kudos to her on a supurb acting job. the general mood throughout this film was almost as eerie as the grudge...not quite, but almost. overall, this was an enjoyable 4-star horror movie. now that i gave it a chance, i understand it......it gives me a good scare with a japanese twist for flavor. it leaves me wanting to see more work from this director....and it feeds my growing interest in japanese horror films.",1315008000,,2285,4.6419753086419755

What about the present day people and their new lives? Do they come back and haunt someone else that's been reincarnated as them in the future?

I've kind of given up on Japanese horror for the time being. It's the most redundant. Like someone else said it's like the same person writes all of these movies. After seeing so many Japanese horror films I'd find it pretty much safe to say that the well has ran dry. These days I enjoy seeing out Korean horror films to watch. Always a new twist on horror and often not predictable (like Japanese horror has become).

2729477,5,B000MEYKCI,"Only in Asia does the practice of horror as a cinematic art form remain alive and well.  Reincarnation, as far as I'm concerned, is a simply masterful horror film that succeeds on levels Hollywood forgot many years ago.  Pulling double duty as the third (and apparently last) entry in Taka Ichise's J-Horror Theater series and one of the 8 Films to Die For from HorrorFest 2006, Reincarnation is in something of a unique position to offer American and other western audiences a gloriously juicy taste of what they're missing if they have yet to make the jump to Asian horror.  Of course, not everyone will agree with my five-star assessment of the film, but I am a little surprised by the range of responses to Reincarnation.  Those raised on a steady diet of Hollywood slashers may have trouble adjusting to the slower pace of this film's horror, while some may not like the fact that they have to think a little bit as the film goes along; some will balk at the necessity of reading subtitles; and I concede the fact that the ending of the film can be somewhat confusing - but how can you not be impressed at the atmosphere and nuance intricately woven into this production?  During the buildup to the conclusion, you actually have three aspects of the story running in perfect parallel to one another for at least ten minutes before being melded together brilliantly by director Takashi Shimizu.  On a more visceral level, the film generates some wonderfully creepy moments - I'll even admit that this film even got one little jump out of me, and that almost never happens to this experienced horror veteran.  As far as I'm concerned, Reincarnation is the type of film that can restore your faith in horror films.

Say whatever you'd like about the film, but I don't see how any can disagree that the lovely young actress Yka delivers a mesmerizing performance in the starring role of Nagisa Sugiura, a budding young actress chosen to play the pivotal role in horror movie director Matsumura's new film, which is based on a hotel massacre that took place in 1970.  A professor killed eleven people in the hotel, including his two young children.  After the audition - even before she's offered the role - Nagisa begins having unexplained sightings, mostly of a creepy little girl with an even creepier-looking doll, and nightly nightmares.  Oddly enough, a young psychology student also begins having disturbing visions involving the hotel.  It's initially unclear what this student has to do with Nagisa and Matsumura's movie, but rest assured that everything will be brought together beautifully in the end. One of the film's great strengths is the fact that it has you asking questions and surmising things all the way through it.  This ability to keep the viewer engaged for so long is what makes Reincarnation so special.  When, I ask you, is the last time you had an OMG moment in the final 10-15 minutes of a horror film?  The masterful ending of Reincarnation is quite full of surprises you may not have seen coming.

Reincarnation is completely unrelated to the two earlier entries in the J-Horror Theater series,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Infection/dp/B0007XBM8O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Infection</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Premonition/dp/B0009KQOZQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Premonition</a>, so don't think you need to see those before watching this one (although they are both great movies in their own right).  It's highly unfortunate that the remaining three films in this project are apparently not going to see the light of day.  If you only watch one of these three impressive films, though, Reincarnation is the one to see.

2729481,4,B000MEYKCI,"Well, I kept hearing all sorts of disappointing statements about Reincarnation. Needless to say, I was a bit reluctant to see it in my local theater. But then I remembered that I have never seen a Japanese film on the big screen, so I went mainly for the experience. Wasn't I surprised when I realized - after seeing the film - that it's pretty damn good.

I'll keep things vague, so as to not spoil anything for those who haven't seen it yet. I admire originality, and while Reincarnation is no Marebito or Tetsuo on the originality scale, it definitely scores high. Sure, there are a lot of horror elements used in this film that have been seen before, but they are not used in quite the same manner. Perhaps the most impressive thing is that the concept of reincarnation itself is used to bridge and interconnect all of these elements in a new and satisfying way. It's like a chef who takes a bunch of foods that you've eaten before, but uses a special ingredient to shake things up. In short, Takashi Shimizu works well as a movie chef here.

Some have complained that the ending is predictable, but this is a misleading assertion. There are essentially three twists that occur back to back to back. Surely, most viewers will probably be able to guess the first twist, but there is very little probability that they will be able to guess either of the other two.

Of course, you can be sure that incompetent, tasteless reviewers like LawrenceGriffin will criticize this film for lacking ""integrity and weight"" (as well as entertainment value), only to then recommend completely weightless trash like Friday the 13th in the same breath. For the rest of us who actually enjoy a quality horror film, we'll stick with our Japanese gems.

The pacing is very similar to Audition (although not nearly as violent in its culmination). The first 70 minutes is basically a slow paced set-up for the finale, with some dashes of formulaic scares. Fortunately, the final 25 minute finale is one of the most interesting, original, and compelling horror sequences in recent memory. So for those planning to see it, please be patient, and rest assured, the crap will hit the fan . . . hard. Quite frankly, the final series of events in Reincarnation had this viewer giggling with amazement. Just when I thought I had the next scene figured out, Takashi Shimizu would pull the rug from beneath my feet and turn the film in another direction.

I think that the reasoning behind some negative reactions to Reincarnation is the fact that it was marketed ineffectively. There is nothing extremely violent in this film, yet it was packaged within a Horrorfest of films that were allegedly very violent. I'm sure that the gorehounds entered the theater looking for lots of guts and blood, in which case they must have been greatly disappointed. In addition, no one knew the film was in subtitles. I watch East Asian films almost exclusively, so I prefer subtitles to dubbings any day of the week, but I must say that the audible groans and moans from the audience when the subtitles appeared was remarkably entertaining. Apparently, reading a few lines on a screen is too difficult for American audiences. :)

All in all, this was a classic horror film that scores relatively high in originality. I highly recommend it for those who can appreciate a slow-buring, plot-driven horror film with a fantastic finale.",1210118400,2,3391,4.768313458262351

2729495,4,B000MEYKCI,"At the risk of being thought of as a shill for J-Horror films, I really didn't want to like Reincarnation as the best entry into the After Dark Horrorfest, it just sort of worked out that way. Actually, I'd say it was pretty close between Reincarnation and Abandoned. The film is directed by Takashi Shimizu who directed all of the Ju-On films as well as the American versions, The Grudge 1 & 2. Reincarnation is not a copy of those films, however. In fact, in one of the DVD's special features, Shimizu comments that he wanted to get away from the Ju-On and Ringu type of horror films. He even takes the J-Horror scene to task somewhat for so much copying of those two noted films. He sought to make a ghost story that broke the mold of the curse-style of films. He was largely successful in his efforts although a few of those standard plot elements did creep into Reincarnation, whether it was intended or not.

Nagisa Sugiura is a young actress getting her first big break in a new horror film. From the very beginning, Nagisa keeps seeing a spectral little girl watching her and abruptly disappearing. The cast is told that the film is based on an actual event. Some forty years earlier, before Nagisa was born, Professor Omori went on a murder spree at a hotel, killing eleven people including his two children. The film is based on that event and Nagisa is told she will be playing the role of the little girl who was killed by her father, albeit in a more grown-up version. As part of their research, the director takes the cast and crew to the very hotel where the murders took place. The Hotel has been closed for years and Nagisa has never been there, but she immediately senses something wrong. She has visions of the murders and finds herself sucked into the past, seemingly fleeing from the killer and hiding in a closet.

While the movie is in production, several other cast members and others unrelated to the film, have their own encounters with the specters of that place and the film touches upon themes of reincarnation. Are these people reincarnations of the victims. Shimizu paces the film slowly, building both suspense and mystery. The story can be confusing at first as we don't really know what these other encounters have to do with the rest of the plot, but hang in there. This is like a puzzle that won't quite make sense until all the pieces are put together.

Of course there is the twist ending you've come to expect from most J-Horror films and I have to admit to being completely surprised after thinking I had the ending figured out. Shimizu does a masterful job in throwing out a lot of red herrings to keep viewers stumped. The last 15 minutes are truly among the creepiest moments in any of the After Dark Horrorfest films. The terror is palpable as it builds to a crescendo for its climax.

Reincarnation isn't completely original. Shimizu relates how he recently discovered films like The Shining and The Haunting, and certainly there are influences of both films. I also noted influences from the underrated film The Changeling.  Like those films, the horror in Reincarnation is subtle, as it grows and festers.

The film is not without its flaws, however. There was very little in the way of character development, even with the main character Nagisa Sugiura. We end up knowing very little about her and almost nothing about the other characters, but there IS a reason for that, I suppose.

The DVD comes with a number of special features including an hour-long making of documentary, a short Q&A with Shimizu which is very enlightening as he reveals his thoughts on the differences between J-Horror and American horror films. There are also some deleted scenes as well.

Subtle and atmospheric, Reincarnation definitely ranks as one of the best of the After Dark Horrorfest films.

2729496,3,B000MEYKCI,"Rinne (Takashi Shimizu, 2005)

News flash: Takashi Shimizu makes incoherent movie. Film at 11!

Like Marebito, Rinne is a movie that is head and shoulders above Takashi Shimizu's usual output, but never lives up to what it could easily have been. The story is great stuff (students of Japanese culture will recognize two or three blended fairytales in this one): a young actress, Nagisa Sugiura (single-named TV actress Yuka) lands a role in a movie about a mass murder at a secluded hotel thirty years before, and the odd flashes of memory that have always haunted her suddenly intensify. They have to do, of course, with a mass murder at a secluded hotel thirty years ago, and she soon discovers she's not the only one who has such memories...

Rinne is by far the best of Takashi Shimizu's films to date. To be honest, that's not saying a great deal, but it's a huge leap forward from the PG-13 potboiler pap (yes, even in the Japanese original) of The Grudge and the well-meant but deeply inconsistent Marebito. This one works as a straight mystery, something no Shimizu film to date has done, as well as operating on the ghost-story level. And the mystery is really an absorbing one, as we try to figure out who these characters really are and what their relation to the old story is. And perhaps others saw the ending coming, but wow. I was blindsided. All that said, the setup of the mystery could have been handled a lot better than it was (the first ten minutes of the movie will make no sense to you until you've almost made it through the entire film), and some of the actors probably could've used a bit more coaching. But that doesn't take away from the fact that Shimizu seems to have shown profound growth as a filmmaker here. Now if he'd ever stop directing Grudge sequels, we might get to see the results of this growth. *** ",1193875200,5,1842,4.555891238670695

Don't bother with this one either.",1188259200,4,366,4.484848484848484
2729498,5,B000MEYKCI,"These films were recently available for viewing on FearNet and other cable outlets (with the exception of ""Dark Ride,"" which I had to rent)...so it was easy--and free--to check them out prior to buying.  I've seen all seven of the films featured in this set, and I'm actually somewhat impressed (with notable exceptions).

""Dark Ride"" is a throwback to the wonderful slasher films of the 70's and 80's, and is virtually a remake of Tobe Hooper's 1981 film ""Funhouse.""  I say these films were ""wonderful"" because, at the time, they were not only frightening but also fresh and, in some instances, groundbreaking.  There is nothing fresh about this entry in the series, though ""Dark Ride"" does feature some really gnarly scenes of gore and a great opening sequence.  There are no real surprises here, however, and I'd recommend this as more of an homage to the aforementioned slasher pics, and mainly for fans of those films only.

""Gravedancers"" caught my attention immediately and never let go--even managing to actually creep me out a few times--I liked it a lot.  The lead actor is completely miscast, but otherwise this is certainly one of the better efforts in this collection.

""The Hamiltons"" is the obligatory tip-of-the-hat to the torture porn genre, generally awful films which are more sickening than actually frightening, managing to both revolt AND bore in equal measure.  This flips that sub-genre and manages to come up with thematic material which seems both classic and fresh.  Though not my favorite, it's still much better than so much of the junk actually getting released theatrically these days.

""Penny Dreadful"" is simply one of the most nasty, gripping films I've seen in a very long time, on or off the big screen.  Though there's plenty of blood in this one, it somehow rises above the genre to (as someone else mentioned here) achieve an almost Hitchcockian tone...much more suspense and tension than actual on-screen violence (though again, there's plenty of that here too).  Easily the best film in this collection, it manages to be claustrophic, sweat-inducing and seriously scary too.  This should have been released theatrically.

""Reincarnation"" is the J-horror entry which bored me to screaming tears.  There are only so many times I can be absolutely terrified by waiflike children with bad complexions and stringy, wet hair, and horrified by the ever so frightening and mysterious ""bouncing ball."" *yawn*

""Unrest"" is a featherheaded but not entirely unwatchable tale having something to do with medical students, a possessed cadaver and Aztec human sacrifice.  The mythology underpinning the story is somewhat muddled, though ultimately it just doesn't seem to matter as the film isn't frightening in the least.  Set in and around a hospital anatomy lab, expect a very high queasiness quotient which will test your ability to hold onto your dinner.  Buried in this strange brew is a rather sweet and sexy love story which is virtually lost in this diverting but vapid, and ultimately silly, effort.

Finally, ""Wicked Little Things"" starts out promisingly: a widowed woman and her daughters take up residence in an undeniably spooky house in the mountains left to her by her deceased husband.  Everything else that happens seems a bit overly familiar, and no real surprises (or scares) result from the ensuing, somewhat flabby ghost story.  This one involves the cannibalistic ghosts (though they're referred to as 'zombies') of children killed 100 years earlier in a mining disaster; their motivations seem a bit murky and the film just kind of trudges toward a predictable ending.  This one scores somewhere in the lower middle as far as this group of films is concerned, and is hampered mostly by a sense of deja vu (""Village of the Damned"" with cannibalism) and the issue of using children for the primary scare factor--which rarely, if ever, works for me.

So there are definitely a bad apple or two in this bunch, but several other films mentioned above definitely help make up for the duds.",1187913600,4,4033,5.046757164404223

2729502,1,B000MEYKCI,"I can't begin to explain how completely unscary, non-gory, and boring these movies are. I love almost all horror fimls, especially the corny older ones but these movies were on a whole new level. While some(but few) may have had a decent plot, they lacked anything even remotely scary. The blood and gore was almost non existent. These were honestly the worst movies that I've ever seen. I think that the directors had a contest to see who could make the worst movie on the lowest budget. I watched them one after another praying that they would get better but they actually got worse. I wouldn't watch them again if they were free.  I've watched films shot with a home video camera that were better. LONG AND DRAWN OUT, NOT SCARY, NOT GORY AT ALL!!! They should have called it crapfest.",1186185600,,787,4.581560283687943

2729504,4,B000MEYKCI,"Although it is not part of this set, with ""The Abandoned"" finally being released all of the ""8 Films 2 Die 4"" from last year's initial After Dark Horrorfest are now out on DVD.  I watched all of them in the theater back in November and now I have watched them all again on DVD and figured it was time to reconsider the whole experience.  Here are the eight films in the order I first saw them:

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reincarnation/dp/B000MEYKCI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reincarnation</a>"" is a Japanese ghost story from the director of ""Ju-On"" having to do with a film being made about a sensation mass murder at a hotel that took place a couple of decades earlier.  I really like the ending(s) of this film as past and present merge with film and reality.  I am so often disappointed by the way most horror films end that the artistry of this one stands out for me (Ranked #1, 4.5 stars).

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Unrest-After-Dark-Horror-Fest/dp/B000MEYKDM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Unrest - After Dark Horror Fest</a>"" reminds me why I never wanted to go to medical school, and that is without the joys of stripping down to my underwear to jump into a tank of formaldehyde filled with dissected corpses.  The back story gets a bit complicated and the plot requires a certain amount of stupidity on behalf of the characters, but a film that swears it has ""real dead bodies"" will have its moments (Ranked #6, 3.5 stars).

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dark-Ride-After-Dark-Horror-Fest/dp/B000MEYKBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dark Ride - After Dark Horror Fest</a>"" is the median for the Horrorfest because it is a solid example of a 1970s splatter flick.  There are a couple of familiar faces here and it sure looks a lot better than ""Fun House,"" its obvious cinematic ancestor.  It also has a memorable example of sex getting your killed in a horror film (Ranked #5, 3.8 stars).

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Gravedancers/dp/B000MEYKDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Gravedancers</a>"" is the film that most relies on special effects for the ghosts raised by the titular crime. It has the most familiar faces with Dominic Purcell, Clare Kramer, and Tchky Karyo and some of the best looking sequences.  But things get a bit out of hand at the end because usually in the end it is not the unbelievers who get really stupid (Ranked #4, 3.9).

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Abandoned/dp/B000OY9V9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Abandoned</a>"" is a ghost story that takes place in Russia and has a 40-year-old woman as the lead, so there are a couple of interesting differences from most horror films right there.  I suppose this film earned its release because it has the most disturbing images of any of these movies. (Ranked #3, 4.1).

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Penny-Dreadful/dp/B000MEYKE6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Penny Dreadful</a>"" is the film that I thought was the most ingenious simply because I did not think they could get as much out of trapping a terrified girl in a car wedged between two trees, so I was more impressed than most people.  It also does not end the way you would think it has to, although the victims lose points for refusing to drive to safety on one rim  (Ranked #2, 4.2).

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Wicked-Little-Things/dp/B000MEYKDC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Wicked Little Things</a>"" takes place in an abandoned coal mine is the mountains of Pennsylvania where a widow and her two daughters contend with a pack of children zombies killed in a mine explosion long ago.  That is right: this movie has minor miner zombies and Ben Cross wondering what happened to his film career.  At least the people in this movie are willing to drive on the rims (Ranked #7, 3.2).

""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Hamiltons/dp/B000MEYKCS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Hamiltons</a>"" is a low-budget film about a twisted little ""Party of Five""-type family with more than their share of dark secrets.  This film has the worst acting but the highest ""sicko"" factor of any of the films, even though we are talking a third-rate ""Hostel""-type film (Ranked #8, 3.1).

That means what I have ended up thinking was the best film of the bunch was actually the first one we saw on Friday afternoon.  But the big question is whether Horrorfest was a good deal and with six of the eight ending up with 4 star ratings (rounding up is a wonderful thing) and nothing below 3 stars, I would contend that qualifies as being pretty good.  Yes, the trailer for Horrorfest was cooler than any of the actual movies.  Yes, I could put together a better octet of horror films culled from that same period, and I am sure you could too, even without including the well-known flicks like ""The Hills Have Eyes"" and ""The Descent.""  Heck, there are lots of horror films that might be even better choices, such as ""Blood and Cuts, ""Dark Nigh"" and ""Desert of Blood,"" that might be better candidates, but they are not even available on DVD, so who knows?  But these films are out on DVD and are definitely above average rentals, ergo the 4-star rating.

These were all horror films that were going to go the direct-to-video route and were reprieved by Horrorfest.  So I decided to compare these eight films to the last eight horror films I checked out on DVD that were either direct-to-video or at least never showed up on a movie screen in my neck of the woods (we only have 20 screens at two theaters in the Zenith City and you can subtract from that title because ""big"" films end up at both theaters and sometimes on multiple screens).  Anyhow, the idea is that these are films that were out there at roughly the same time, although some might be a bit older.  Of the eight, six of them I rated three stars: ""Room 6,"" ""Dead Silence,"" ""In a Dark Place,"" ""Chicago Massacre: The Richard Speck Story,"" ""The Hunt,"" and ""The Tooth Faerie.""  I rated ""Wes Craven Presents The Breed"" 2-stars and was so offended by ""The Tomb"" purporting to be a H.P. Lovecraft story that I gave it one star, which rounds out to 2.6.  Consequently, I have no problem saying the Horrorfest films are at least a whole star better than those eight since they average 3.7.",1183334400,24,6494,5.359251968503937
2729505,5,B000MEYKCI,"Shimizu's After Dark horror contribution Rinne (Reincarnation) is probably closer in sensibility to Pulse or even the Shining than his earlier Ju-On/Grudge films (or most of the other After Dark entries, if the endless previews on my DVD are anything to go by).  None of the usual japanese horror tropes--the long haired ghost in a nightgown, the omnipresent water--are present, as Shimizu chooses to focus on the inevitability of repeating your past lives endlessly.

Briefly, the plot is as follows: in 1970, a professor staying at a small hotel went crazy and killed 8 strangers, his 2 children, and himself. 35 years later, a director decides to make a movie dramatizing the event, casting as the lead actress a woman who is haunted by the young victim she plays.  Various people throughout the movie, including some of the movie cast and crew, are inexorably drawn to the hotel as history repeats itself.

Part of the creepiness factor is the randomness of the doomed souls who were part of the killing in 1970, and Shimizu is very good about keeping everything moving along quickly and making the intersecting stories mesh.  He also uses CGI lavishly (unlike either Ju-On or Grudge) which I always like.  The only thing I didn't care for was the usual lack of explanation for why these events are happening at this particular point in time. I've now watched a zillion of these things, and that ALWAYS bothers me.

I see that some of the tag suggestions include ""crap"" and ""worst movie ever made"" which suggests that other reviewers were disappointed in their expectations. However, if you're looking for a thoughtful thriller rather than a straightforward J-horror flick, check it out.",1183248000,6,1691,4.954063604240282

Probably the best out of all the horrorfest movies...of course that wouldn't be to hard considering  most of the other ones sucked. It is subtitled so make sure you're willing to read before you buy it...but it will give you a scare. I actually would give it 4 1/2 stars because there were parts of the movie that were a little boring and some of it does move a little slow....but its really worth a watch, especially if you're into J-Horror.",1180483200,5,817,4.483221476510067

2729530,5,B000MEYKCI,"Let me first say, I like the J-Horror genre VERY much.  This one completed failed to disappoint me.  Yes, this is more psychological instead of guts and gore (like many American horror films are) which is just fine by me.  I don't get creeped out very easily and this film did it.  It was mild creepiness...most related to a doll. I won't give away why, but that doll was just plain ooky.

One thing to consider when watching one of Shimizu-san's films is that he does not keep to a linear story-telling method.  If you watched the Grudge, you see multiple stories that aren't in the usual chronological

order we're used to.  Yes, it's tricky to follow and keep the characters straight.  But I think it all worked rather well.

I liked that part of it reminded me of Carnival of Souls.  If you've seen both, you know what I mean.  So I have to say bravo!  I got creeped out a bit and just loved this movie even more than Ringu or Ju-On...and their remakes.",1176940800,3,957,4.369318181818182
2729531,5,B000MEYKCI,"The people who don't like this movie are expectinga tingly, shrill, ""Grudge""-like movie.  And they were dissapointed.  This movie is, however, an excellent phycho-thriller, it has twists and turns, and is truly an accomplishment for Shimizu, and is probably his only movie where everything actually works together as oppossed to leaving unanswered questions.

Yes, if you are dim-witted, you won't like this movie because it's not a horror movie, and you actually have to pay attention to it.

But, those of you intelligent enough to understand a complicated movie such as this one will find it terribly enjoyable.
