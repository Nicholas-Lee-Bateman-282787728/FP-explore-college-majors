3496061,5,B001BNFR26,"I just watched this program on the history channel, and will be ordering the DVD right away.  This is by far, one the best, if not the best accounts of Sept. 11, 2001 I have seen.  Told using video filmed by people who happened to be in the area at the time of the attacks, and shown in real time,  it is by far the most chilling I have seen.  The film makers obviously wanted the viewer to really feel as if they were there, instead of just making a straight forward documentary of the events.  Though portions of it are VERY hard to watch, I highly recommend this program to anyone looking for an EXCELLENT first hand account of the events on that terrible day.",1221091200,5,663,4.23015873015873

3496093,4,B001BNFR26,"Features a collection of footage filmed by a number of people in NYC on 9/11 as the tragic events unfold. People stand in stunned disbelief. One cameraman is in Times Square getting people's reactions as they watch on the jumbo tron.

When the second plane hits people get really angry and shot out what they think should happen as it is realized the situation is not an accident but rather an attack.

People begin jumping from the buildings. Includes  phone calls. Then the first tower collapse. The most unnerving scene for me was a group of fire fighters carrying hoses getting ready to enter the second tower which (unknown to them)  would soon collapse. Heartbreaking. While insightful, sickening. The sound and sight of the second plane going into the building is unforgettable. Horrific. Some shaky camera work at some points. Paper blows and the debris cloud appears to be evil itself. Dust and destruction. RIP.

On the day I write this the worst attack since 9/11 occurred. Why? Why? Why? In the United States of America the Constitution gives the right of freedom of religion to worship how a person wishes. Some choose the culture of death in hopes of a promised heaven.

In the extras people comment about the footage the footage they filmed. RIP",1465689600,2,1260,4.810185185185185

3496097,2,B001BNFR26,"I ordered this to use as a pre New York trip reminder of this tragedy.  I was very disappointed that it left out the most tragic part.  It showed bodies falling out of windows but it failed to show the second plane hitting the second tower.  This is the most tragic and graphic scene of the entire story.  Seeing that plane hit brings the entire situation to life and brings home how real and tragic it was.

We don't have television or Internet in our home, and I decided that it was past time for my now 18-year-old son to see this for himself.  I could not have chosen a better film!  I agree with the others that the lack of professional editing and commentary is what gives this film its ""you-are-there-as-it-happens"" feel!

3496150,5,B001BNFR26,"Incredible film. By far the best insight into the evolving terror, turmoil and ultimate realization of the catastrophe on the streets of New York. This should be mandatory viewing in our public schools from middle school on up.",1381708800,3,227,5.0
3496151,5,B001BNFR26,"I am not saying that this is the best film ever done on 9/11 - the original network broadcasts done by NBC, CBS, etc. are the best, period. Unfortunately these news networks will not sell their live film footage from Sept 11, 2001. Therefore, these spliced-together images taken by the general public are a second best alternative...sometimes the film quality is not that great, but for the most part it is surprisingly good - and often excellent. Anyhow, this event is so riveting & drama-filled, that almost everyone who sees this will stay glued to their television. And the(currently)low price on this dvd makes it a bargain.

Even though I saw everything live in 2001, just seeing this again made my chest pound...no work of fiction will ever have the impact of something REAL. I showed this to a friend who had not seen this footage before, & he was glad I showed it to him. I'm willing to bet your friends will want to see this too - there is nothing else out there to compare with this, period.",1375747200,5,1002,4.566666666666666

3496153,5,B001BNFR26,I highly recommend this for anyone who in interested in seeing what really happened on that awful day. A minute my minute account seen from the people who lived it and multiple broadcasts,1367798400,3,187,4.696969696969697
3496154,5,B001BNFR26,"At about the midpoint of the spellbinding documentary ""102 Minutes that Changed America"" as terrified and confused witnesses scramble to escape the dust cloud of a just collapsed Tower Two a newsman's voice announces ""Ladies and gentlemen there are times in our lives that are life changing...and this appears to be one of them"". Its a moment like so many others in this fine documentary, that genuinely captures the fear, confusion and terror of September 11, 2001 in a way that few other documentaries have succeeded in doing.

While there are many documentaries about September 11th, including some very well produced ones, few are as evocative as this program. Instead of repeating news broadcasts and footage of official reactions as the events of that terrible day unfolded, the producers instead chose to do away with familiar images and soundbites and instead edit together an amazing record of the events using only the video footage shot by average people. What unfolds is a minute by minute account, told from dozens of perspectives without a single line of narration or ""expert"" soundbite. If the intent was to give the viewer the sense that they've been transported back to that day to relive a host of emotions, then they have succeeded.

Its the kind of documentary that everyone should see at least once.",1366848000,4,1320,4.995454545454545

3496158,5,B001BNFR26,Being able to see 9/11 through the eyes of so many people gives you an experience like no other. I recommend this DVD.,1350172800,4,118,4.173913043478261
3496159,5,B001BNFR26,"Quite possibly the finest documentary ever made, this incredible movie puts the viewer right on the streets of New York City on that terrifying September morning of 2001 to experience the most shocking and tragic event in American history as it unfolds minute by minute. It creates the feeling that you are standing blocks away from the World Trade Center with a video camera in your hand while the chaos of 9-11 happens all around you.

This film provides an unbiased, up close and personal look at September 11th that you will never get from your preferred news channel of the day. I'm amazed at just how much video footage was shot by eyewitnesses on the streets of Manhatten that morning in such a short period of time. The raw, amateur video that makes up the entire movie captures so much detail of that morning and is edited together so masterfully it feels like you are watching a Hollywood movie instead of the real thing.

Shocked passersby with their jaws dropped open at Times Square while the towers burn before their eyes...firefighters marching into the area to save lives...screams of horror as the hijacked plane explodes into the south tower...trapped victims leaning out the windows of the towers as they wait for rescue...people running for their lives from the massive cloud of debris that covers the city as the two towers crumble to the ground...this documentary puts you right in the middle of all of it.

The attack of the second plane shot by a female college student from her apartment window is some of the most chilling, unforgettable video footage ever caught on camera! It is the most disturbing scene in the entire movie that will leave your jaw hanging open. Suprisingly and thankfully, there are no gory, violent scenes to make this completely unsuitable for younger viewers, although it is too intense for young children.

The History Channel has produced a masterpiece of documentary filmmaking thanks to the many ordinary people who grabbed their cameras that morning to record a historic tragedy that we will never forget. This is a must see movie for anyone who wants to know what it felt like to witness that tragic, unforgettable day on the streets of New York City. Perhaps best of all, this documentary presents the events of 9-11 with no liberal or conservative bias in the way to distort what really happened. This DVD is clearly not a CNN or Fox News production, and for that I am thankful. This documentary is the REAL DEAL that should be seen by everyone, especially those too young to remember a tragedy that changed America forever.

In our never-ending search for the ""real deal"", our primary collective goal as students in the school of modern life must be to immerse ourselves in a balanced and thought-provoking exploration of the American experience that is NOT distorted by the maddening...indeed blinding...liberal/conservative bias that saturates mainstream news media and serves only to bitterly divide the citizens of a suffering nation aching under the merciless weight and burden of chaos, greed, animosity, and intolerance. In these grim, bleak times of 21st century America, we must grasp with clenched fists now more than ever the immortal virtues of PEACE, LOVE, and KINDNESS that should provide the true purpose and meaning of our lives while directing our every move.

3496161,5,B001BNFR26,"Ten years on and it is still painful to watch anything related to 9/11. However, with the way people in general tend to ""forget"" or want to be revisionist about events, this is a good DVD to have.  It shows events as I can even now remember watching unfold on my television.  Work stopped in my office that day and everyone gathered around the few televisions available.  I held my breath in disbelief as first one and then the other Tower fell.
You could not ask for a more nearly minute-by-minute, on the screen presentation.  My heart still breaks when I watch the Two Towers crumble.  I recommend this DVD to everyone.  I didn't want it to happen to me, but 9/11 very definitely became the third personally defining moment in my life.

3496162,3,B001BNFR26,"1st, I will sayh there is great footage, much Ive never seen, but what I was hoping for in this dvd, was a sence of being there. Living on the west coast, there is a connection lost by just seeing everything on t.v/dvd It would seem they intentially left out key  visuals. Neither plane hitting the buildings, the 1st tower collapse was shown by a civilians shaky camera with almost no vantiage point. The secong collapse was at least a steady cam, but far away.

I wanted to kow what it SOUNDED like with a lot of these cameras when these things happened. Some of the cameras set up had PERFECT viewing of key elements, and they chose  cuts that were obstructed, or  unclear. It is not morbid to want to see these things. It is part of what happened.

I will say, that the scenes of people that had lept or fallen, was done tastefully. To this, they did a great job of calling attention, but not glorifying it.

Overall, decent viewing, well put together, but still does not satisfy my curiositys of that day.",1315440000,4,1010,4.403225806451613
3496163,5,B001BNFR26,"One of the main things about this DVD that stand out from the others is the simplicity of the footage. This footage was captured by different people from around the area at the time of the attacks. Only voices can be heard behind the camera, rarely a face. The raw human emotion is chilling. Most of this footage is rare and not often seen in other documentary's. The only thing added to this footage is some subtle music. A very well done score. Often these documentary's add awful over dramatic cheesy music that can take away from the real emotion we're seeing on the screen. What you get here is just enough and a perfect fit. This DVD along with : 9/11 - The Filmmakers' Commemorative Edition, and In Memoriam - New York City, 9/11/01 is a great DVD to have in your collection.

We're all affected by that day and these images. sometimes I see them and it feels like that day all over again. People I saw every week for work were on those planes. Standing on the porch of a woman who's husband was on that plane can be a humbling experience.",1315008000,6,1046,4.364102564102564
3496181,4,B001BNFR26,"This is really a great documentary. Very powerful original footage. The History Channel went with real primary source history on this one: eye-witness camcorder and cell phone video of the events unfolding and peoples' reactions to them in New York City. There is not so much as a frame of televised (e.g., cable news) footage: this is 9-11 through the eyes of citizens who were there. No narration, no interpretation. Just raw footage through the many different camcorders of people there, arranged into a chronological order. No interviews of survivors or witnesses, no factoids-you-didn't-know, in many cases not particularly good shots of important events, just the raw 102 minutes as they unfold through camcorders and phones.

An important caveat about a documentary containing almost 100% amateur video is that the video is very, very shaky. So much that my wife and I (she gets motion sick, but I practically never do) both got so motion sick that we had to stop part way through. I wish we had had some mints in the house. Motion sick people be advised: take some over-the-counter dramamine before watching this important documentary.

Nevertheless, this is a very moving documentary. For example, in some places it captures actual terror in peoples' eyes and voices during the events in New York in a way that now other documentary has or really could. Although, as 100% raw footage, it is very different from other 9-11 documentaries, and I would recommend it mostly as a wonderful complement to one or two more of the excellent 9-11 documentaries out there, rather than the sole 9-11 main-stay in your DVD library. The four-star (rather than five-star) rating reflects two aspects of this video. While it is very good, and certainly worth having in a collection of 9-11 documentaries, it is just plain not quite as good as some of the other profoundly moving documentaries on 9-11. Second, in some places the editing was not what it perhaps could have been. Imagine several consecutive seconds of a camcorder bouncing around wildly with audio that is also unintelligible because the camera shooter starts looking somewhere else while filming. My sensitivity to this might have been accentuated by the fact that almost the entire documentary is shaky, but there seemed to be many moments of this that could have been truncated and replaced with better footage.

Be advised also that this documentary is completely within New York, and does not really include the attack on the Pentagon or United Flight 32 in Pennsylvania (even though they overlapped with the 102 minutes in New York).",1314662400,9,2596,5.018561484918793

Also included in a 15-minute documentary with interviews from some of the people who filmed the video in the main piece.  It helps provide some context and understand how terrible event impacted so many ordinary people.

The most awe-inspiring moment is the video filmed by a female college student with her roommate. They are watching people leap to their death from the first tower, and then the second plane hits.

One plane hits and everyone is in shock and wonders what is going on.  When the second plane hits the panic level suddenly skyrockets.  The pure horror of people jumping from the buildings.  There is a conversation heard between a man and woman after the first tower collapse about whether or not it is gone or if there is just too much smoke to see it.  My husband and I had almost the same conversation at that time.

3496190,5,B001BNFR26,"All day today I have been watching documentaries on 9/11. This is one of the better ones, in  that it gathers footage from all different sources and perspectives,

To me, the question is not are these films any good. Anyone with a little skill and an editing machine can put the abundance of footage of 9/11 together and tell the story.

More interesting is WHY watch this. We all know what happened on that day, yet each year we see these films. Obviously people watch, or they would not air,

Does it help to remember that day? Do we heal from seeing it, regaining a visceral sense of 9/11? We have since become more polarized than we were before that day--right after which we all seemed united. Does watching this film remind us of some of what we are arguing about?

I still can't decide the exact function of a film like this, but as I watch this film, as I think of Afganestan and Iraq, Bush and Obama, I realize that this is very quickly becoming a long time ago.

But there are a whole bunch of fourth and fifth and sixth graders who  were just babies on 9/11. They won't remember that soon before this, we were worried why our tech stocks were swooning, if Bush or Gore got a dimpled chad or a hanging chad. If Gary Condit slept with Sandra Levy.

But this is the world 9/11 robbed us of, and this  is still impacting our culture, our laws, our politics, and our daily lives in a million subtle ways.

Pretty soon most young adults will not know a world before that day.  They will experience the what--having to have five documents to get a  driving license, a long wait at an airport. But they will need to see the why--how one day made the world they know.

Maybe these films are for them",1284163200,11,1701,4.311320754716981

(Actually, it shows a few minutes after that, too, as pedestrians flee the giant clouds of pulverized concrete.)

Some viewpoints are labelled with distance and direction from the towers, but many more are without labels, which can be confusing when scenes shift abruptly.

Some images are accompanied by audio which exactly meshes with the video, often with voices of witnesses actually at the scene, along with what can be heard from a radio or television broadcast in the background.  Other segments may have been recorded as video only, to which audio from other sources has been added.

Between the Introduction (1) and the Credits (28) are entry points labelled (2) thru (27) with times presented in hh:mm:ss:?? am format, where hh, mm, and ss can be recognized as hour, minute, and second, and I am guessing that the final ?? field could be frame number, since its tens digits show up only as 0, 1, or 2, and its units digits go by too fast for me to match up properly with the tens digits.

The beginning of the collapse of the South tower can be viewed near the end of segment 17 (9:55:50:12 am), and the collapse of the North tower at the beginning of segment 25 (10:28:12:03 am).",1266796800,2,1391,4.703703703703703

3496261,5,B001BNFR26,"The aftermath of the attacks on the Twin Towers was likely the most videotaped event in human history.  New Yorkers, New Jerseyites, other locals, and tourists started filming shortly after the first tower was hit and continued throughout the day, sometimes at their own peril.  ""102 Minutes That Changed America"" documents what they saw and what they filmed.  The film relies very little on video from reporters or the major networks, although at times you can hear the television or radio playing in the background as people film.  Instead, the filmmakers of this documentary from the History Channel have woven together skillfully dozens of amateur videos that more accurately capture how people reacted on this historic day.  The average person videotaping from her living room in a high rise apartment just blocks away the Twin Towers, and the average tourist recording reactions of people in Time Square.  In addition, the filmmakers wisely opted to forgo including narration, and rely on only minimal title cards to inform the audience where the video was being filmed, the time, and so forth.

Some of these amateur videographers provide running commentary for us, expressing their disbelief at what is unfolding.  Some of them talk to loved ones who are nearby or record people around them, including strangers.  Still others record in abject silence.  The videos at the beginning of the documentary reflect the initial confusion as people saw the first tower ablaze.  People speculate that it was just a small plane that got lost.  Eventually, the videographers and people in the streets realize that it was a terrorist act.  We hear the screams and panic as the second plane hits - these moments are among the most gut-wrenching and dramatic.  One group of people near the Twin Towers decide hastily to evacuate their apartment, and we witness as they frantically put on their shoes and pile into an elevator.

There is no filter here.  No Katie Couric to reassuringly tell us that the President is acting to neutralize the threat.  No CNN to analyze who may be responsible.  No buffer from the anguish and pain, including the horrifying realization people have when they finally understand that what they thought was debris falling from the towers is actually people jumping from the buildings.  The footage is raw and most people will find watching ""102 Minutes"" to be a draining experience.  However, it is important to recall what we all experienced that day.

I believe that the further one lived from NYC, the less importance this event had on the person.  You know that years from now they will be teaching kids in school sugarcoated versions of what happened on that day, and it is videos like this that sets the record straight.  The scariest part-was how no one knew exactly what was going on, and what to do about it.  There is no overly violent scenes in the video, but the sense of doom the viewer has from knowing the sequence of events is quite horrific since unlike a typical fictional horror film-everything is real.

3496263,5,B001BNFR26,"The History Channel aired this program several times in the wake of the anniversary of 9-11. I was able to catch two viewings of this show.

I live in San Diego, Ca. and like most people, I witnessed 9-11 through the lens of the collective (and individual) camera eyes. To say this is the ""best"" 9-11 documentary is, perhaps, inappropriate to say, but this particular program stands high above any of previous 9-11 shows I have seen as far as capturing what must have been a horrific event to witness first hand.
What makes this program stand out is it's lack of a produced narrative.  No Dan Rather telling me what I already know. No trite musings that have littered most of these types of programs. Instead the producers have allowed the viewer to see and hear the events as they happened. It is, for the most part, straight footage with no production elements added. If any narration IS heard it is from any given individual who happenes to be speaking within the video footage itself. As a viewer we are drawn into this presentation as we watch others watching the horror, and then watch it ourselves. There is a minimal amount of ambient soundtrack included but it is highly underscored and very consistant with much of the raw footage that fills this doucumentary.
As for the footage included, it is safe to say it has to be some of the most compelling news-type footage I have ever seen, in regards to anything. Much of this footage was done by amateurs but it does not detract form the experience one bit.
One particularly haunting shot that sticks out to me is a shot taken by an individual somewhere near the base of the WTC towers after both have been hit. THe camera is busy collecting visuals of a courtyard barren of any people...just papers and ashes drifting lazely with ominous whimzey. The sounds of distant panic accompanied by an outdoor speaker system playing a muzak version of Billy Joel's ""she's always a woman to me"". Truely erie.
I could not recommend this program enough. I would say order it direct from the History Channel, but Amazon has it for less, but no matter where or how you get, do get it. It's not easy to watch, but it's very difficult not to as well.",1222041600,113,2191,4.558375634517766

  This documentary also shows how rumors were rampant in the city at the time and the disinformation spread from person to person (such as the two women who said that someone else told them that the second plane was a British Airways).  This account of 911 is shocking, horrifying, disturbing, and heart wrenching.
