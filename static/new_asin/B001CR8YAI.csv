3517612,4,B001CR8YAI,"Being a lifelong Colts fan until that fateful night on 3-28-84, I was hoping that this DVD would bring back a flood of memories for the decade of the 60's that was totally agonizing for any Colts follower.  And yes, while this DVD was ""good"", it could've been way better.  NOTHING is touched on prior to Super Bowl 3 (well, a mention of the 34-0 win in the NFL championship game was there), but I felt that considering what this team went through during the entire decade of the 60's, all of the events leading up to 1970 would've been perfect background material for their Super Bowl run and what this championship in 1970 eventually meant to many of those players.  For instance, losing to Cleveland in the championship game 27-0 in 1964 after being huge pre-game favorites.  The '65 heartbreaking playoff game to the Packers with Matte as QB, and the one loss season in '67 where the final game vs. the Rams that year left them out of the playoffs nonetheless, and then Super Bowl 3, this would have been perfect as a lead in to the season as a whole.

As far as the season itself goes, it is a well produced documentary where Mike Curtis, Bill Curry, Bubba Smith and Ernie Acorsi are the primary interviewees reliving the details of that season (a quick game-by-game synopsis on the schedule).  And the extras at the end (mainly how the team as a whole feels that since moving to Indy, the Baltimore history of the club is entirely forgotten), are enjoyable and not just ""fluff"" material.  Again, this isn't meant to say that the DVD is not worth the money (to me it was), but much like to the Colts' players in the DVD, I felt that there was something missing that could've made it better.",1260144000,4,1694,4.48051948051948
3517613,5,B001CR8YAI,"This superbowl V I remember as a youth barely and it was great to re-live this moment on dvd!  I always loved Bubba Smith and the Baltimore Colts defense.  On this viewing, this Superbowl V was not a very exciting game, filled with turnovers and some sloppy playing on both Baltimore and Dallas but good viewing anyway.

I loved the commentary by Bubba Smith stating that since the organization left in 1983, the Baltimore Colts players have been shuned by the Indianapolis Colts, the present Colts have no history of their team during the Baltimore years or don't respect it, what a shame!!

This dvd is still a great view!",1225756800,6,624,4.6454545454545455

8288998,4,B001CR8YAI,"For those of us who were Colt fans in that period, this DVD is a great memory of that time.  The DVD reviews the whole season and cuts to more recent interviews with Mike Curtis, Bubba Smith, and Bill Curry.  Sure, I wish there were more, my only complaint is that it felt short on coverage of Super Bowl V itself -- I hear that may be in part due to NBC's inadvertently erasing their videotape coverage of the game.  Also, I kind of wished the three players were together in the same room for the interview and there could be some give and take between them.  But it is what it is.  For me, it is a nice souvenir and I enjoyed being taken back to that era.",1368403200,,657,4.062015503875969
8288999,5,B001CR8YAI,"I was a Baltimore Colts fan growing up, so it was great to get a look into the Colts' entire season leading up to Superbowl V. Hearing the perspective from guys who played on that team was entertaining, and at the same time enlightening. For instance, I didn't realize how Mike Curtis felt about John Unitas' 'do it my way or hit the highway' attitude. He certainly makes it clear in this video. Another tidbit that included Mike Curtis was the time he leveled a fan who ran onto the field, and the subsequent reactions by some of the Colts players. I enjoyed hearing those stories, because I'd never heard them before. Superbowl V is especially memorable for me because it was the first Superbowl I watched all the way through with my dad. What a memory! It's great that NFL films archived that game since NBC stupidly deleted or 'wiped' most of the game forever. All that having been said, whether you're a Colts fan or not, grab this one and add it to your collection. You'll be glad you did.",1364428800,,995,4.472527472527473
8289000,5,B001CR8YAI,"This is a great reflection of the 1970 Baltimore Colts.  The interviews are great and I was left wanting to see more of the interviews on the extra features.  The quality of the disc is great, too.",1363824000,,197,4.297297297297297
8289001,5,B001CR8YAI,"This excellent film from NFL Network/NFL Films, narrated by Ed Harris, chronicles the story of the only Super Bowl championship won by the REAL Colts - the BALTIMORE Colts, not to be confused with the franchise that Robert Irsay destroyed and moved to Indianapolis in the middle of the night in 1984, although that team would eventually win Super Bowl XLI, thanks to Peyton Manning.

The film begins with the heavily favored Colts' upset loss to the American Football League's New York Jets, 16-7, in Super Bowl III, on January 12, 1969.  That was the beginning of a lost year for Baltimore sports fans:  after the Colts' loss, the then-Baltimore Bullets, the NBA Eastern Division champions, led by Wes Unseld and Earl ""The Pearl"" Monroe, were upset in the NBA Playoffs by the New York Knicks. That was also the Bullets' last full season in Charm City; for the next four years, owner Abe Pollin moved about half the team's games to the University of Maryland's Cole Field House in College Park, until the Capital Centre opened in Largo, Maryland in 1973. Then in October 1969, came the unkindest cut of all:  Earl Weaver's mighty Orioles, winners of 109 regular-season games (still a club record), and coming off of a three-game sweep of the Minnesota Twins in the first-ever American League Championship Series, lost the 1969 World Series to the Amazin' New York Mets.

After losing the Super Bowl, the Colts did not make the playoffs in 1969, going 8-5-1, in their last year in the ""old"" NFL.  Colts owner Carroll Rosenbloom and head coach Don Shula had a falling-out; as a result, Shula left to coach the Miami Dolphins, which, given what happened to the Colts later on, was probably the best career move he ever made.

With the NFL-AFL merger in 1970, the Colts, along with the Pittsburgh Steelers and the original Cleveland Browns - who would eventually become the Baltimore Ravens - joined the ten former AFL teams in the new American Football Conference.  The late Don McCafferty was hired as the new head coach, and the Colts, despite several injuries and other assorted ups and downs, won the AFC East, going 11-2-1 in the regular season, defeated the Cincinnati Bengals at home in the first AFC playoff game (the second Cincy team to come to Baltimore and lose that year), and then defeated the Oakland Raiders in the AFC Championship Game, also at Memorial Stadium, to reach Super Bowl V.  One of McCafferty's assistants, John Sandusky, who would eventually replace McCafferty as Colts head coach, is the father of WBAL-TV sportscaster Gerry (no relation) Sandusky, now the Voice of the Baltimore Ravens.

While Super Bowl V was not the best-played game - there were a number of turnovers, several bizarre plays, and Hall of Famer John Unitas left the game early with an injury, enabling Earl Morrall - the ""goat"" of Super Bowl III - to come off the bench and lead the Colts to an amazing comeback, topped by Jim O'Brien's 32-yard field goal in the final seconds, defeating the Dallas Cowboys, 16-13, giving Baltimore its first Super Bowl title (and its last, for 30 years, until the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV, six years before the Indianapolis Colts won their first Super Bowl).  Morrall, who died in 2014, was also the starting QB for the undefeated 1972 Miami Dolphins; Bob Griese was hurt most of that year, although he did return for Super Bowl VII.

Baltimore was known as ""Flagtown, USA"" in those days, as the Orioles had avenged their loss to the Mets by defeating Cincinnati's Big Red Machine in the 1970 World Series only months before, and the Bullets finally got past their tormentors, the Knicks, to make it to the NBA Finals for the first time, in 1971.  The Bullets, as expected, lost the Finals to Lew Alcindor (later, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar) and the Milwaukee Bucks; in 1973, they moved to the since-demolished Capital Centre in Largo, Maryland, and would finally win their only NBA title in 1978, with a lot of help from the last Baltimore Bullet, Wes Unseld.  Now, they are the Wizards, playing in the Capital One Arena (originally the MCI Center, then the Verizon Center) in downtown DC since 1997, and who under former Coach Randy Wittman and All-Star John Wall, finally showed some improvement after decades of mediocrity before fading again. In 2017, things got even better for the Wiz; under first-year coach Scott Brooks, they won their first division title since Dick Motta's 1979 Bullets.

Oddly enough, although Baltimore won several titles in minor sports (the indoor-soccer Blast and Spirit, the 1985 Baltimore-in-name-only Stars, who played in College Park and won the last USFL title, and the 1995 Baltimore Stallions of the CFL, who became the first (and probably last) non-Canadian team to win the Grey Cup), since the double whammy of the 1970 Orioles and Colts, there have only been three Major League sports championships in Charm City - the 1983 Orioles, the 2000 Ravens, and the 2012 Ravens.

Former Colts Mike Curtis, Bill Curry, and the late Bubba Smith, along with Colts PR director (and future General Manager of both the Colts and the New York Giants) Ernie Accorsi, are interviewed.  The most surprising revelation is that Curtis and Johnny Unitas did not always get along.  I wish that Jim O'Brien had been interviewed as well; perhaps he was unavailable.  None of them looked upon the Super Bowl V win as redemption for the SB III loss, partially because the game was so sloppily played.  I'm sure that the 1970 Orioles felt the same; beating the Reds in the World Series did not make up for the loss to the Mets.

While NBC wiped the tape of Super Bowl V, there are plenty of game highlights, with then-Colts announcer Ted Moore (Rosenbloom, feuding with Orioles owner Jerry Hoffberger, fired Hall of Famer Chuck Thompson, Bill O'Donnell, and other Oriole announcers from the Colts broadcasting booth, and hired his own broadcaster.  Thompson would eventually return to the Colts, in 1973).  Of course, Rosenbloom would get the ultimate revenge on Baltimore by ""swapping"" the Colts to Robert Irsay for the Los Angeles Rams, then would move the Rams to Anaheim, which led to Al Davis moving the Raiders from Oakland to L.A., and then the Colts' middle-of-the-night move to Indy in 1984.  In 1988, the St. Louis Football Cardinals would move to Arizona; in 1995, Rosenbloom's widow, Georgia Frontiere, now also deceased, would move the Rams to her hometown of St. Louis, and the Raiders would return to Oakland, leaving L.A. without a team, and Art Modell would move the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore to become the Ravens in 1996.  But at least the Browns got their name, colors, and heritage back, and received a new team in only three years, which is a better deal than the Colts fans in Baltimore got.  In addition, the Houston Oilers would move to Tennessee in 1997 and eventually change their name to the Tennessee Titans; Houston would get an expansion club, the Texans, in 2002, unlike Baltimore, who was rejected for an expansion club, in favor of Jacksonville and Charlotte, before Modell moved the Browns.

UPDATE: On January 21, 2016, St. Louis Rams owner Stan Kroenke, who acquired the team in 2010, two years after Georgia Frontiere's death, received permission from the NFL to move the Rams back to Los Angeles; the Rams will play in the L.A. Coliseum until a new stadium is built in Inglewood, California, which is scheduled to open for the 2019 season. The San Diego Chargers, who returned to Los Angeles in 2017 (they played in L.A. in their inaugural year in 1960) after San Diegans rejected public funding for a new stadium (good for them!) played in the Los Angeles Galaxy's soccer stadium in Carson, California, and will share the new stadium with the Rams, once it is completed. The Oakland Raiders will eventually move to Las Vegas, but until that stadium is completed, will be a lame-duck franchise at the decrepit Oakland-Alameda County Coliseum.

It was a more innocent time then.  As much as the Ravens are loved in Baltimore, I don't know if they will ever replace the old Colts in the hearts of Baltimore football fans, especially the older ones.

Now, in honor of the old Colts, follow the bouncing football and sing the Baltimore Colts Fight Song (now used by the Ravens, with different lyrics):

""Let's go, you Baltimore Colts,
And put that ball across the line,
So, drive on you Baltimore Colts,
Go in and strike like lightning bolts,
FIGHT! FIGHT! FIGHT!
Rear up you Colts and let's fight,
Crash through and show them your might,
For Baltimore and Maryland,
You will march on to victory.""",1360972800,,8577,4.818243703199456
8289002,5,B001CR8YAI,"The NFL Film's America's Game is wonderful series.  This is the best episode.  The 1970 Colts were a team haunted by the failure of Super Bowl III.  As Bill Curry describes, the 1968 Colts were on the verge of being proclaimed the greatest team in NFL history.  The loss in Super Bowl III not only took that away from them, it forever branded them as the first team to lose to the AFL, to be constantly relived in NFL Films highlights and on ESPN classic.  The 1970 Colts used that failure as the catalyst for the 1970 season in attempt to redeem themselves.  However, it is only after winning Super Bowl V do they realize that even a Super Bowl victory can not make up for that loss.  Growing up a Baltimore Colts fan, I have always understood this.  As sports writer Bill Gildea put it, ""no one in Baltimore ever got over the loss in Super Bowl III.""  I am 50 years old and I still haven't gotten over Super Bowl III.  The shame of it is that the 1970 Colts should be celebrated for its remarkable character and determination.  They were not a great team, in fact, it was a team on the decline.  The defense was outstanding, but the offense was mediocre.  Tom Matte was injured, Jimmy Orr was done, and John Mackey was in decline.  Unitas had never really recovered from his 1968 arm injury.  However, they found ways to win. That their triumph did not result in the redemption that they players sought only adds to the charm and melancholy nature of the episode of this episode. That's what makes the episode great. This is real life, not some phony sports story.

BTW, it seems to me that a really great book could be written about the 1968 Colts.  I wonder why no one has attempted it?  A bizzillion books have been written about the Jets, but I would think that a book about that game from the Colts perspective and how they players have dealt with that defeat over the past 40 years would be far more interesting.",1292371200,7,1920,4.375706214689266
8289003,5,B001CR8YAI,"This film highlights the 1970 Season and features Bill Curry, Bubba Smith, Ernie Accorsi and Mike Curtis sharing there memories.

The NFL Films footage is amazing and well worth the price. Ed Harris does a great job with this video. I can see why he was chosen.

According to many accounts, Super Bowl V was seen as an embarrassment. NFL Films' famed John Facenda dubbed it ""The Blunder Bowl"". Even some of the former Colts players deemed it an ""empty win"". Bubba Smith to this day claims he never wore his Super Bowl ring. And to top it all off, the NFL made a ridiculous call awarding the MVP to a player on the losing team. I believe the decision to give the MVP to a loser, forever stamped this game as a disaster. You'll never see that mistake made again. (Sorry Chuck good game but no MVP.)

The emotion that comes out of Bubba Smith, Mike Curtis and Bill Curry is intense. It puzzles me that these guys are not happy about a game they won? OK, they lost to the Jets in Super Bowl III. Colt fans everywhere were crushed as well. I will never get over the Colts having the ball 6 times in the Red Zone and getting no points, in a 16-7 loss. In 1970 however the Colts beat the Jets convincingly twice.

I will take no shot's at Mike Curtis (one of my all-time favorite players) but his lack of respect for Unitas was disappointing at best. Sometimes locker room stuff should stay there. A 2006 poll of living Hall of Famers selected Unitas the NFL's #1 Quarterback of All-Time. Mike Curtis is also an all-time great player who belongs in the Hall of Fame. Why he took shots at Unitas is unclear. Maybe it's the natural LB/QB friction, but Curtis comes off as bitter.

I get the passion, but I don't get the disappontment...they won the Super Bowl! If these players thought it was an ""empty"" or ""bittersweet"" victory, think of the thousands of players and numerous Hall of Famers that never wore a Super Bowl ring. How about the Cowboys who lost the game? They all must shudder to hear the Colts complain about their Super Bowl Rings.

As a fan, Super Bowl V was a great win for the home team. Baltimore Colt fans still love to see Jim O'Brien kick that 32 yarder. I was 11 years old and I remember that Sunday afternoon watching with my dad, in our den, on an old Sylvania B&W TV. I remember Unitas throw the tipped ball to Mackey. I can still recall the relief and joy as Mike Curtis made that key interception that set up the winning kick, and then jumping up and down just like O'Brien when the kick went through. I can still hear the cars and trucks on the streets of Baltimore honking their horns. The radio stations played the Colts fight song and Jim Karvellas proclaimed, ""The Baltimore Colts are World Champs!"" on WFBR.

For the fans of Baltimore, the Orioles were also World Champs beating the Reds in the World Series just 3 months earlier. We were in seventh heaven. We finally answered for the humiliation of the Mets and the Jets.

Until the Ravens won Super Bowl XXXV, Baltimore wasn't really allowed to enjoy it's last Championship. The Colts were gone, the league, NFL Films, some disgruntled players, and most sport writers had negative things to say about Super Bowl V. To make matters worse NBC taped over the only videotaped copy of the entire game broadcast and this game is lost forever and can never be viewed again in it's entirity. All other Superbowls are avaialble to watch again except Superbowl V. (I'm still holding out hope that a home made bootleg copy will surface someday.)
**** UPDATE 2016....A copy of Superbowl V has been found! It is a fantastic copy made by someone in LA recorded from television. The bad part is it has 45 minutes of pregame, then runs out in the 4th quarter. It is  then nicely dubbed with TV audio and NFL film highlights to complete the broadcast. Fantastic find. Picture quality 10 of 10! I'm not sure if the NFL knows it exists.****

I still have yet to see or read anything about Super Bowl V that captures the elation we all felt in Baltimore to see our Colts crowned World Champs in 1971. This game can never be truly captured by a highlight reel. Yes there were many turnovers and while this makes for a sloppy looking highlight reel, it was an incredibly intense and exciting game. You dared not step out of the room. No highlight reel can ever capture the feel of this intense game and unfortunately it is lost forever.

All this said...this is a great Colts video and all Baltimore fans should add it to their Colts collection. For a bright-eyed 11 year old kid Super Bowl V will always be a true wonder. However when I heard NFL Films famed John Facenda, call it ""the blunder Bowl"" I have since felt alone in loving Super Bowl V. After watching this DVD I still do. I still love recalling this game and I say, thanks Jim O'Brien...wherever you are!",1262476800,14,4823,4.438418079096045
