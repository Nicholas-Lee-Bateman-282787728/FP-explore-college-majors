8625709,5,B00GOUYBPU,"I had the opportunity to watch the movie on a flight several months ago and the film describes what an average Japanese family endure during world war II, to make it more interesting, this family is catholic and shows with great picture and realism life in the 1940's and the story is great. In my opinion, it is an excellent movie and I am surprised for the fact that is not available to play in DVD's or Blue Rays US Region. I had been monitoring for months Amazon to try to buy one but with no success.
I hope one day, somebody realizes that this is a great movie that worth the attempt to to sell it in the US/Americas Market",1418860800,,629,4.206611570247934
