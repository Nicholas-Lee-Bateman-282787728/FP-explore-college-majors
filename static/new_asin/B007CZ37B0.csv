5078898,4,B007CZ37B0,"By Jim Clark, publisher, Lee County Courier, Tupelo, MS

I wasn't aware that there was such a thing as an aggression scale. There is. A list of common verbal and physical aggressive behaviors among middle school students was created.
The Aggression Scale is Home Alone  for adults.
While a mob boss (Ray Wise) was imprisoned, one of his associates took $500,000 from him. The associate and his new wife, each have a child from a previous marriage, and are looking to start a new life in a new town. They don't tell the kids about the money.
""We don't have to do this clean, you go down this list and kill them all, then you find my money. You got 48 hours,"" the mob boss says. He sends out four hitmen to get his cash back and kill anyone and everyone in the way.
But the hitmen, after killing the parents, at the Rutledge home aren't counting on having to deal with the emotionally unstable son Owen (Ryan Hartwig). He helps his new sister out of the house and sets up a variety of lethal booby-traps for anyone who comes after them.
Suddenly there are only two bad guys and they've found paperwork on the kid. Apparently, Owen's off the chart on his aggression scale. They begin to have second thoughts about going after the kids, but know they can't go back to the mob boss empty handed. Perhaps they could take the money and run. But, of course, they don't trust each other.
Now they've spent too much time going over their options.
Owen has become the hunter. This is a cool film.",1338249600,,1485,4.416058394160584
5078899,4,B007CZ37B0,"A mob boss (Ray Wise) wants his stolen money back and everyone who might be involved, killed. He also wants proof which requires the use of a Polaroid (seriously?). After 3 people are snuffed we switch to the subplot. A family of four...recently married move into a new home. The son Owen is creepy and silent. He is interested in things that kill. Lauren (Fabianne Therese) is his 17 year-old step sister who showers with her back to the camera...end of eye candy.

It isn't hard to figure out how this grindhouse plot and family drama come together. When Owen gets a chance to escape, rather than take it...cue heavy metal music as the quiet teen opts to fight 4 grown armed men. In this ""Home Alone"" tale, Macaulay Culkin is a psycho, who, like a cat, likes to play with its prey before the kill.

Derek Mears, one of the bad guys has that creepy Michael Berryman look to him, but acts more like a pansy. I found his character to be darkly comical as things happen to him. Dana Ashbrook comes across as George Cloony light. Good old fashion home break-in with some new twists. Excellent blood splatter. ""B"" movie fun. I would have given the film 5 stars had they played Talking Heads ""Psycho Killer.""

When a recently released criminal gets out of prison and returns to his life he notices that $500,000 of his money has been stolen. After finding out who took it he hires a group of hit men to get the money back. Things go fine until they reach a house with a boy who fights back. Based on the preview I was intrigued at this. It seemed like a movie I would like but thought it could go either way. I have to say this was a huge surprise to me. This is not a movie for everyone because it is very bloody and violent. The best (and only) way to describe this is that this is an over the top extreme violent version of ""Home Alone"". If that doesn't want to make you watch it then I don't know what else to say. To me this movie was very fun to watch and I really liked it, it a morbid way. These revenge movies like this are one of my favorite type of movies. Overall, a very over-the-top violent version of ""Home Alone"" that I loved but is not for everyone. I give it an A...I know but I really enjoyed it.",1335916800,6,1122,3.925438596491228
5078901,5,B007CZ37B0,"Home Alone meets Rambo.

Steven C. Miller's ""The Aggression Scale"" starts with ""bang!"" as hitman Lloyd (Dana Ashbrook) sends a message with his shotgun.

We quickly learn that Lloyd has been sent by mob boss Mr. Bellevance (Twin Peak's Ray Wise) to find a large sum of stolen money.  Lloyd and his fellow crew Chissolm (Derek Mears from Friday the 13th), Freddie (Jacob Reynolds from Gummo) and Wydofki (""the knife man"" played by Jospeh McKelheer from The Hamiltons) kill a handful of people before finally arriving on the new doorsteps of the Rutledge family.

Bill (Boyd Kestner) and Maggie Rutledge (Lisa Rotondi) are recently married, each with a teenager from a previous relationship.  Lauren (Fabianne Therese) is Maggie's troubled daughter, angry at having to move across the country to a new house with people she barely knows.  But it is silent Owen Rutledge (Ryan Hartwig) who has the bigger issues...a fact that Lloyd and his boys are soon to discover for themselves when they kick in the door.

Dread Central.com calls The Aggression Scale ""one of the more unusual and clever games of cat and mouse fans have ever experienced before.""",1335398400,12,1146,4.968586387434555

5078910,2,B007CZ37B0,"I really hate when they make movies like this one, because there is absolutely no point to the whole thing. If I wanted to see a bunch of people running around, shooting at each other, while hardly saying a word, I'd watch a John Wayne movie. The Aggression Scale is a pointless film about a mob boss, who sends his team to close some unfinished business. Mr. Bellavance (Ray Wise) doesn't want any witnesses and his team goes on a killing spree. Everything is going as planned, until they find a family whose children decide to fight back. This could have been a darker version of Home Alone or even something similar to Die Hard with kids, but it wasn't. The lead character, played by Ryan Hartwig, doesn't say a word through the entire film. No cute catch phrase, nothing special at the end, not a single word, but even that was preferable to the performance of Fabianne Therese. The whole movie this girl is whining, crying, and making weird noises, it really was enough to drive a person insane. As I said earlier, there really is no point to this film and there is no reason to watch it either. The story is thin and the film is basically an hour and a half of people running around shooting at each other. The Aggression Scale represents the worst Hollywood has to offer and it's mind boggling that a company would even agree to make something as bad as this.",1389744000,,1366,4.468
5078911,4,B007CZ37B0,"I watched this interesting, low budget movie last night.  Interesting to me because it was filmed in Rochester, NY & the surrounding areas (Finger Lakes, Macedon, Victor & Leroy).

In fact, the opening scene is an aerial shot from a helicopter flying over the old Kodak Building in downtown Rochester.  The movie itself is not bad - a violent blend of Rambo & Home Alone.  A psycho kid terrorizes four ""hit men"" who killed his father & step mother by laying booby traps all over their farm.  Not quite a 5 star movie, but fun to watch.  Anyone from Western NY will feel an affinity for the locations used in this movie",1385683200,,618,4.473214285714286
5078912,4,B007CZ37B0,"Surprisingly good for fairly unknown movie.  As others have said it is like a hardcore Home Alone.  A mob boss gets out of prison and wants bloody revenge on those that put him in prison and the people that took his money.  Little does he know one of the key culprits has a kid that is rated 99% on the aggression scale.  The best of the movie begins when the mob boss's henchmen tangle with this kid and his traps.  Well worth at least a rental.  I bought the Blu-ray based on reviews and the low price (under $10).

5078916,2,B007CZ37B0,"If Tarantino  did an R-rated spoof of Home Alone, it  would most likely bear a passing resemblance to Steven C. Miller`s The Aggression Scale.  The home-invasion thriller isn't owned by Chris Columbus' 1990 family comedy, but when you make a blond pre-teen kid the defender of the home, the comparison is inevitable.  While a darker Home Alone with R-rated violence may seem like a promising prospect, The Aggression Scale seems stuck at ""insane hard as nails  kid dishes out bloody vengeance.""  Although Miller opens his movie with a bravura opening sequence and manages to hold on to some semblance of tension, the thrills die down by giving Superboy all the power.

An unstoppable anti-hero taking down unambiguously bad guys in an R-rated setting is almost always done to indulge bloodlust.  We feel no remorse for those who have slaughtered the innocent, and we certainly don't feel it when the protagonist's actions are done in self-defense.  Miller does an excellent job of setting up  hitman Lloyd as a sadist who enjoys killing anytime, anyplace, anywhere, and who clearly deserves whatever violence will be visited upon him.  The intro sucks in the audience by opening with the definition of the ""Aggression Scale"" (a test to measure one's proclivity towards violence), the low hum of the soundtrack, Lloyd's toothy and psychotic smile, Ray Wise bringing the patented Ray Wise-menace, and then cutting to loud, angry, energetic opening titles.  We then move to meeting the family, and our curiosity is piqued by the silent, clearly disturbed Owen.  The elements are in place for an exciting collision course.

But the collision turns out to be more of a fender-bender.  The movie takes a little too long setting up the family dynamic, in particular Lauren's character.  Miller wants to keep Owen mysterious, and since Lauren will be his emotional anchor, we need to spend time with her and her emotional baggage.  However, her problems seem far too normal in a movie with a hit squad versus My Little Punisher.  The impact is further diminished when we see the attackers bust in, but then cut to Owen wearing all-black clothes, and double-lacing up his combat boots.  We know where the power lies, and it's not with the contract killers.  With so few characters and a clear indication of who's going to be taking the hurt, there's not much drama.  The audience simply waits to see how Owen will take out the people trying to kill him and his family.

It's never dull, but the characters are all one dimensional, and when it's over, there is an overwhelming feeling of so what?",1362441600,,2586,4.910138248847926
5078917,3,B007CZ37B0,I liked it but it could have been better. Ray Wise is one of my favorite actors. He plays the Mob boss in this movie.,1361404800,,117,3.72
5078918,3,B007CZ37B0,"Bill and his family think they have received a fresh start when they move out of the city, but Bill's past is about to catch up to him when his former employer is released from prison and has a group of men sent out to look for his stolen cash. What the men don't realize is that Bill's son is fresh out of a mental care facility, himself, for his tendency towards extreme violence whenever he is pushed over the edge! While the general premise offers nothing new in the way of crime thrillers, director Steven C. Miller only uses this as a platform for the unrelenting action that is to follow. THE AGGRESSION SCALE is almost comical in its Acme-like approach to graphic violence, and although it packs a number of intense moments along the way, the characters and situations are nothing short of contrived. That never takes away from the fun, however, as Derek Mears and the other hit men take an absolute beating from their teenage target. When it comes to the exploitation of raw, gritty violence and gore in an action flick, THE AGGRESSION SCALE definitely passes the test!

He sends 4 hitmen on a mission to kill all employees and get the money. A newly married couple and his deranged mute son and her troubled teenage daughter move into a new country house.

5078926,4,B007CZ37B0,"This is a stonking little film that really took me by surprise but in a rather good way. It is all about a mobster one Mr Bellavance, who is out on bail. He has decided to do a runner with half a million dollars that was the result of one of his deals, and take his son with him. The only problem is that someone has only gone and nicked it. So as all good mobsters do he decides to do some mediaeval retribution. He sends his hit men off to find the culprit, get the money back and kill anyone who might have simply been near it. Forgive and forget are not his motto.

The motley crew of hit men are led by Dana Ashbrook (the eagle eyed of you may remember him from `Twin Peaks') and he puts in a fine performance as the cold hearted and ruthless killer. Once he has `topped' somebody he has to take Polaroid's of them for the lovely Mr Bellavance's amusement.

Then we have the nice lawyer Bill, who has just got married to Maggie. He has a son who needs special medication and she has a teenage daughter who is into self harm, so this most certainly isn't The Brady Bunch. Anyway Lloyd and co come a calling and decide to exact some arbitrary slaughter. Only thing is that little Owen (Ryan Hartwig) has forgotten to take a pill or three and we soon find out that he has a bit of a temper and that coupled with an obsession for all things survivalist makes him a lot more lethal than Macaulay Culkin could ever dream of.

This is just brilliant fun, director Steven C. Miller has just got the best out of a little known cast and they all really deliver, Ryan Hartwig is great as the dangerous, and mute Owen but Fabianne Therese as Lauren is superb as the teenage sister and goes through the whole gamut of emotions during the course of the film which just shows how versatile she is.  There are some plot contrivances but I just didn't care this had me hooked almost from the start and just bounded along as all good action films should be.

Dana Ashbrook (Twin Peaks) relishes his villainous role and perennial bad-guy Ray Wise chews up the scenery in his brief appearances.  Ryan Westig evinces a chilling evil as Owen and Derek Mears' false bravado is almost comical.

You see, when they target this one family they think may be holding the money, they didn't reckon on their little disturbed son, fresh home from a psychiatric institution. You see, the little kid has had some issues with violence in his past ...

The movie is clearly low-budget, and the quality of the directing varies from abyssal to brilliant, and then back again. The acting is variable, with some actors clearly more skilled than others. Yet the ingenuity and sheer violent energy of the movie doesn't fail to delight.

5078938,3,B007CZ37B0,"As with the title here, some have called THE AGRESSION SCALE a version of HOME ALONE with the results of the traps seen on screen. That's an apt description. Does it make a good movie? When it comes to originality yes, but in follow through it heads to the mediocre level.

Ray Wise plays a mobster just released from jail. Before he heads out of the country and can stand trial he gives his top man Dana Ashbrook an order: find the person who took $500,000 of his money and kill him and his entire family and do it in 48 hours. With few leads to follow Ashbrook and his team go down the list of names they've been given, each leading them closer to the suspect. Not wanting to leave witnesses, they also kill each person they come into contact with.

So where is this suspect? He's just remarried a woman who brings along with her late teens daughter, a girl who wants nothing to do with this family or with her new step brother. That stepbrother has a bit of a problem and was recently released from a mental hospital. It seems that he has a tendency towards extreme violence, something measured by what they call the aggression scale. His scores far exceed anything seen before but medication seems to be helping.

The bad guys follow their leads until they arrive at the just purchased home of the newly married couple. A combination of torture (not lengthy) and murder leave only the kids left to deal with. But as this team begins to search the house for them, the young boy turns the tables on them, leaving traps and wounding them as he helps his new sister escape.

The team tracks the kids down not just through the house but in the surrounding woods as well. Along the way they have serious wounds inflicted upon them by the resourceful kid, some going so far as to be killed in self defense. He may just be a pre-teen but these goons have no idea who they're up against.

The idea of having a troubled teen taking on tough guy gangsters sounds like an interesting one. The traps he makes for them are well thought out and vicious at times. When you add the touch of the aggression scale psychological make up to the mix it makes it even more interesting.

What stops the movie from being great though is the acting. It's not terrible but it's not quite that good either. Worst of all is the step sister who's screaming while attempting to hide from the bad guys makes her one of the stupidest victims of all time. Hint: when you're being chased, never scream to give away your location.

One interesting note among the cast is the coupling of Wise and Ashbrook. Both were part of the now famous series TWIN PEAKS. It's nice to see them reunited here.

As I said, the movie isn't that bad and actually has some decent moments in it. You can tell that this one is a low budget flick but in the end it seems better than several big budget films I've seen in the past few years. It may not be for everyone's taste, but if you're looking for something a little different and don't have a problem with low budget style and acting, then give this one a watch.",1339977600,,3064,4.363157894736842
5078939,5,B007CZ37B0,"Picked up this movie despite the lack of reviews for it, but I frequently grab the strait to DVD releases.  This movie is exactly why I take the risk of buying that type of movie... After watching this I can say it was worth the price.  This film grabs you right from the opening scene and takes it's time revealing insight into the characters as the plot develops.  I have to say my wife and i both enjoyed this thriller.  Great tale of a twisted little kid that has some serious issues, but you will find yourself cheering him on as he does what McCauley Culkin never had the balls to do in the Home Alone movies.  If you want a great thrill ride that is a little different, you gotta watch this one you won't be disappointed.  Some good gore and some scenes that will make you cringe.",1339891200,4,787,4.248322147651007

5078941,5,B007CZ37B0,"I had no idea I was going to love this movie so much ,I mean I really love it.
The story itself is great ,yes I read all the references about Home Alone and it's true, it's very Home Alone Meets Toy Soldiers but much much more brutal.
For the synopsis you can read the one given. It's unnecessary reading in a review if it's already given.

The characters of Owen and Lauren 'Ryan Hartwig'and 'Fabianne Therese' were so intriguing and their acting was amazing.
They played perfectly off one another as newly not yet adapted step brother and step sister.

I loved watching the chemistry between them and seeing how her trust in him grows and blossoms.
Owen's genius and raw ability to inflict violence was in itself perfectly paced and brilliant to watch.

The fact that the intruders walked into the house blind to the time bomb that is Owen let you know you were in for a great ride. It did not disappoint. Owen's methodical planning and execution of his traps and justice were like that of Home alone but done with the mind of a child that blows pins out of a straw to kill insects and hits the target dead on.

The violence is plentiful,it's not extremely gory but it is very bloody and brutal.
I watched it on demand and immediately bought the Blu Ray.
The ending is one that I had to rewind 3 times so I could revisit it again and again.",1338940800,5,1342,4.356
8514773,3,B007CZ37B0,"This is actually a 4* movie but drops a star right from the start got not having subtitles.  Sorry folks, but that's how it works for me.

As someone said, Home Alone meets Rambo.  My wife and I thought Home Alone with more blood.  You can't give this much for originally.  But you can for the kid, Owen, and his newly gained step sister, Lauren.  They were the primary characters of the film.

Yeah, we enjoyed it.  But it was very predictable.  Still, I'd watch it again.",1492819200,,473,4.344827586206897

Within the first minute of the film you see someone firing a shotgun and the sound effect they use is the pistol sound effect from the 1993 game DOOM. You can find infinitely better movies than this to waste your time with. I would suggest Blue Ruin if you are into revenge type stories.",1455580800,,363,4.515151515151516
8514778,5,B007CZ37B0,"Honestly, I watch a lot of movies. I really do mean a lot of movies. I watch real big budget films and some smaller budget films that peak my interest. The Aggression Scale, did just that, it peaked my interest. I read a review a little bit ago that described this movie as ""Home Alone"" grown up style, that peaked my interest. As I watched the movie, I was found myself wondering why is this kid the main actor? No lines spoken, minimal face reactions (except for the faces he makes to convince others), and some weirdness that I just can not figure out. When the movie did elaborate on the character, I was already fuel throttle in. The movie is slow at the beginning, but it definitely picks up here and there. It all just adds to the suspense. I loved the ending, and realistic harm on the characters (no one is going 13 rounds like a boxer or taking hits like a terminator). The ""new siblings"" characters are just the perfect part to this movie. I find myself watching this over and over again because it is what it is. It is a refresher from all of these whole CGI films, that is quite good and hard to turn away from until it ends.",1455408000,,1138,4.273148148148148

8514781,4,B007CZ37B0,"Between this and ""You're Next"" the highly played out ""trapped in a house"" storyline is in danger of being worthwhile after all. Here,it's saved by an exceptional cast, good pacing, and very skilled direction. The (justly) respected name of Ray Wise is all over this despite what is little more than a cameo, so don't get your hopes up, but this is definitely a worthwhile little sleeper of a movie.",1426896000,,398,4.7
