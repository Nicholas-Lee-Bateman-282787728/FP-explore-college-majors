There is no improvement on the already-sharp remastering, only a change in the packaging.  I can't imagine why anyone who has been buying Poirot series all along would buy this set, unless one wants all the numbers on the shelf lined up in order...like Poirot would!",1398729600,28,441,4.776315789473684
5723240,5,B00CJ318SE,"David Suchet's Poirot on TV films are adaptations of Agatha Christie's novels--but so well done, both books and TV shows/DVDs have proved modern classics in their own right. I avoid comparison of novel to screen. No need, both excellent.
The star casts and guest stars are too numerous to mention. One can't fault acting a ha'penny.
This set is the end of a re-issue series placing stories in original UK TV-airing order.
BUT . . .
It has been announced that the FINAL series 13 is new episodes, finally all Christie's Poirot stories adapted, and Suchet playing Poirot in all 70, a 25 year single-character career. He's unsurpassed.

SDH SUBTITLES FOR ALL 4 adapted feature length stories:
Three Act Tragedy
A lovely Cornwall coastal location for a Poirot murder case(s). A parson (Nigel Pegram) one of many at a dinner party drops dead of apparent natural cause. A 2nd Yorkshire party-same guest list-has a 2nd death, the host Tallie (Art Malik-`Upstairs Downstairs'). Hercule helps Sir Charles (Martin Shaw-`George Gently') investigate. Egg (Kimberly Nixon-`Cranford') helps too, or is she suspect? Poirot reenacts the complex and connected deaths under stage lights.
Other stars: Jane Asher (`Wish Me Luck' `Alfie'), Kate Ashfield (`Silent Witness'), Tony Maudsley (`Doc Martin' `Foyle's War'), Anna Carteret (`Mrs Palfrey at the Claremont'), plus.

Hallowe'en Party
A crime author friend (Zoe Wanamaker) asks Poirot to investigate the drowning of a child, participant at a Halloween party. She previously claimed to have witnessed a murder. All party guests & their lives are investigated to find this killer as well as the perpetrator of 4 more deaths. Beautiful fall scenes with spooky dark spots too. Amelia Bullmore (Mrs Dalloway), Timothy West (Edward the King), Deborah Findlay (Anglo Saxon Attitudes, Cranford), Sophie Thompson and Phyllida Law (Sis and Mom to Emma Thompson), Fenella Woolgar (Scoop), Julian Rhind-Tutt (Notting Hill, Stardust), are a few of the recognized cast.

MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS--
Perhaps the best of A. Christie's books. It was written in 1934 and the story begins Sep. 26, 1938.
Poirot is allowed to fill an unoccupied birth as the Orient Express moves out from Istanbul to England. The luxury car he rides includes American Samuel Ratchett (Toby Jones), a princess (Eileen Atkins of `Cold Mountain'), railroad director Bouc, a doctor,&...well a dozen travelers. The Orient Express gets stuck in a snowdrift (a true event that inspired A. Christie) and the group is also visited with a murder in the train car. There is proof the murderer is yet on the train and Poirot (with the help of the railroader and doctor) intends to find him/her. That's the plot, simple enough, but the deed, and the unveiling of the killer is what makes this story so exceptional, memorable, and emotional. You'll want to watch it a second and third time.
BONUS...47 min of Suchet hosted interesting tour of the present Orient Express, riding prior to filming this movie.

The Clocks
Five murders plus love at the White Cliffs of Dover, a wonderful backdrop. 1940s prior to WWII but Hitler threatens says Admiral Hamling (Goeffrey Palmer-`As Time Goes By""). The case erupts with the duel death of German mole Annie (Olivia Grant-`Lark Rise to Candleford') and Fiona (Anna Skellern-`Siren'). MI6 Lt. Race (Tom Burke-`Cheri') asks Poirot to help his naval investigation. Evidence implicates typist Sheila (Jamie Winstone) running from the murder site home of a blind lady (Anna Massey-`Darling Buds of May'). Evidence of 4 clocks stopped at 4:13, in flat #19 leads to a complex suspect list and more deaths. It's a wild and often funny neighborhood of characters you will enjoy. Cat Lady Hemmings (Beatie Edney) is a delight and has another best line while trying to encourage Poirot to set in a cat's ""damp"" favorite chair.
Favorite line after Hercule Poirot introduces himself to child Jenny; ""that's not a name, it's a noise.""
Also look for stars: Phil Daniels (Eastenders), Stephen Boxer (Garrows Law), Jason Watkins (`Little Dorrit' `Lark Rise to Candleford'), Lesley Sharp, Sven Hjerson (The King's Speech) and more.

It's hard to choose a favorite. Huge casts, excellent screenplay adaptations, delightful 1930s settings, sets, costumes, dialogue.",1396224000,8,4274,5.197387518142235

Gone are the White Haven Mansions, Miss Lemon, Captain Hastings. Gone is the wry humor and wit. Murder on the Orient Express in particular took a turn for a Poirot who was not really like able. judgemental and all of a sudden oh so Catholic. I wonder why David Suchet, who honed the character with impeccable timing agreed to this script. It was disappointing to see this beloved character turn into this sour, severe judge. My old friend who did not judge only wanted Justice was gone. This guy who he became, while a superb actor , wished to hear Hastings say ""Good God!"" And Miss Lemon interject her efficiency and motherly protection of Poirot. I like Zoe Wannamaker who I admit does add a bit of humor to the plot. That is at least that.

It seems the writer / producer / director (?) was trying to make each episode like an epic movie.  I enjoyed the crisp quality scenes of the English country side, the details in costume and setting, but still it doesn't seem to portray the real England of that time period like the earlier episodes do.  The actors seem to be just that actors; actors on a stage rather than real life portrayals. Also, Poirot himself has changed somewhat in character, more emotional, at times seemingly in a rage, screaming, which was a odd for me as a viewer.

The actors did a good job, but it just wasn't my cup of tea. ""Three Act Tragedy"" was so-so. I thought the one with Tony Curtis was better. Then there were ""Halloween Party"" and ""The Clocks.""

5723270,5,B00CJ318SE,"Before I purchased this DVD, specifically to watch ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" I read many of the ""less than stellar"" reviews. I noted, in many reviews, that this production was being compared to the 1974 feature length film of the same name. I am disappointed that so many viewers seek to make a comparison of two completely different interpretations of the novel by Dame Agatha Christie. In doing so, they are attempting to compare ""apples to oranges,"" to coin a very old phrase. Personally, I generally do not like to see films ""remade;"" particularly when the first version was done ""perfectly."" To name a couple of examples of this, I would name ""True Grit"" and ""The Pink Panther"" films. They were done right the first time and the attempt to ""modernize"" the original for a younger viewer is misguided, in my opinion. Show them the original. However, in the case of this story, I cannot honestly say that the 1974 film was perfectly done right the first time.

At this point, I will note that my further review may contain a few ""spoilers"" for those who have not seen either the 1974 film, this television feature length version, or read the novel as written by Dame Christie. If you have not done ALL of the above, please discontinue reading this review now and read the book, then watch BOTH versions. Only then would I request that you return to this review and read on. Thank you.

I have read all of the Agatha Christie ""Hercule Poirot"" novels and short stories, and have watched both film productions. To fully understand this review, you must have an understanding of the characters and plot AS WRITTEN by Dame Christie.in order to note the differences between both productions.

The 1974 film production of ""Murder on the Orient Express"" was cast with extremely well known, famous, and outstanding actors. Portraying the lead character was Albert Finney. The supporting cast included names such as Academy Award recipient for Best Supporting Actress (for her role in this film), Ingrid Bergman, Lauren Bacall, Sean Connery, Richard Widmark, Sir John Gilgud, et.al. The budget was a lavish 1.5 million BPS, considering the year of production. It was well received and is, in my opinion, a very good film; if you want to see performances of famous actors, expensive costumes, set design, and bright lights. That being said, this is not the story as written by Dame Christie. Finney's portrayal of Poirot was too tense, too tall, too loud, and too stiff. In my opinion, he was not right for the role (that is not to say that I think Mr. Finney is a bad actor...he's had some fine roles in which he was wonderful to watch; most recently ""Erin Brockovich""). The lighting was too bright and the costumes too perfect, even lovely gowns worn by the ""beneath the stairs"" class of character (lady's maid, missionary, personal secretary, etc). There was no real guesswork in this film because all of the clues necessary to solve the ""crime"" were given before the film ever started. Newspaper clippings of the kidnapping of the Armstrong baby, Daisy, pictures of key individuals, the ""route"" the getaway car took, and so forth, are flashed during the opening credits. When Sean Connery delivers the line, ""...by a jury of 12 good men...,"" even the sound level of the dialogue has been edited noticeably, like putting that line in bold type. The decision of Poirot to ""let them off of the hook"" shows no moral conflict for him. It was performed as what is often termed as a ""throwaway."" In other words, it was as if Poirot said, I don't care what you decide to tell the police...you can all go. This is contrary to the very soul of the Poirot character and did not ring true for me.

In the ITV production, contained on this DVD, the circumstances are much different. David Suchet has a very deep understanding of the Poirot character AS WRITTEN BY CHRISTIE. I bet those who have never touched an Agatha Christie novel with this character, but left a negative review of Suchet's performance, didn't know that Poirot was Catholic, did you? Once the climatic ""second solution"" is calmly, and brilliantly underplayed in its presentation to the passengers (and viewer), does Suchet allow Poirot to become verbally and physically frustrated; angry with the passengers who are trying to justify their actions, which are a violation of Poirot's firm conviction of upholding the law. His portrayal of Poirot's moral conflict is so true vs being contrived or overplayed. Christie writes that ""Poirot does not approve of murder."" That characteristic is emphasized throughout every story with Poirot, up to and including the final novel, ""Curtain."" Additional material is added, related to further moral choices, to show that the basic nature of the passengers as ""good people."" As Suchet makes his exit, after having a ""private"" discussion with the Yugoslavian authorities, he pulls his rosary from his pocket, and is holding back the tears as he prays for forgiveness for his ""choice."" THIS is the Poirot Dame Christie shows us in her novels; not a clown or buffoon, not a man who tends to yell and scream. He is eccentric, fussy, organized, always looking for proof and fact-order and method; yet he is a very moral character with a deep seated Catholic belief (regardless of anyone's personal views on religion) in God and the forgiveness of sin, through confession and prayer. Other characters do not share the Catholic view of ""absolution"" for certain sins. Addressing previous comments regarding the darkness of this production. It is winter in Yugoslavia, overcast...the train becomes unexpectedly stuck in a snowdrift...the power goes off. The very nature of the subject is dark. The train is a confined space (anyone who has actually been on one knows this). Why would anyone attempt (or expect) the train to be brightly lit? The darkness, cold, and confinement shown in this production is the only possible way to properly set the tone for the story. It's not a party, folks, it's a murder crime scene where the best laid plans have gone astray. The ""murderer(s)"" did not make alternative plans to account for the possibility of the train to become snowbound (delayed from reaching a destination where the ""perpetrator(s)"" could leave the train; it is stated in the dialogue that this train has been snowbound on previous occasions), or the presence of the master detective, Poirot. I cannot conclude my ""review"" without mentioning other notable actors in this production. Included in the cast are Toby Jones (whose credits include:""Hunger Games"", ""Harry Potter"" (voice of Dobby), ""Tinker, Taylor, Soldier, Spy"", ""The Painted Veil"") and Barbara Hershey (an Emmy, Golden Globe, and Academy Award nominated actress whose credits include: ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" and ""Portrait of a Lady""), both of whom are outstanding actors.  The entire cast for this production was extremely well chosen. My only criticism would be in some of the dialects effected by a couple of the actors, but that is very minor and does not detract from the overall excellence of the story.

In conclusion, for those of you who left poor reviews of the ITV version of ""Murder on the Orient Express,"" I would suggest that first, you read an Agatha Christie short story, or novel, with the Hercule Poirot character featured. Then, re-visit the DVD without trying to compare it to the 1974 movie. Watch it with an open mind, remembering the nature of Poirot (additional ""characteristics"" portrayed by David Suchet are noted in his novel, ""Poirot and me""), the setting for the story, and the moral conflicts every character must show us, the viewer. I think you may find it much more enjoyable if you give it another chance.",1445990400,,7701,4.910906298003072

5723283,5,B00CJ318SE,"I was born in the fifties and grew up in the 1960s and early 1970s.  Agatha Christie was quite well known to me, but was something the older generation read and seemed not quite fashionable or with it for the times.  Nor was it quite mature enough or serious enough to be considered must read classic literature like Dickens or even Hemingway and certainly Faulkner.  Let me say it, we were wrong to cheat ourselves of this wonderful stuff.  Not that I am obsessed with it as some are.  And I came to Christie the other way round.  That is, I got to know her works through these wonderful shows with David Suchets masterful incarnation of Poirot.  Then I started picking up the stories and books to enjoy the craft of her writing, the more intense detail, and the more intricate characterizations.

That being said, I want to praise these shows for the wonderful treasures they are.  I know that the purists complain with every cut, with every character change, with every plot rewrite.  It isn't the story.  It isn't the book.  They are correct.  It is different.

It might be different because in a movie or show the plot must be SHOWN rather than told.  You cant have Poirot sitting around endlessly discussing details with Japp or Hastings and others.  There has to be movement, action, and things must be shown rather than explained.  Then there is the time constraint of an hour or hour and a half show rather than a novel.  Even a short story has to be redone for the constraints of the stage or a show.  You might need a character change because of the actors available or to simplify the plot.  There are endless varieties of reasons for changes when you translate from one medium to another.

Simply said, I love these shows.  You may not.  It is perfectly fine, either way.

This series contains four of the 90 minute (or so) episodes.  The Three Act Tragedy where dinner party guests end up dying in rather inexplicable and seemingly unrelated ways.  But Poirot finds the thread.

Halloween Party requires Poirot to solve a cruel death of a child at a costume party.

Murder on the Orient Express is a very good telling of this novel.  Wikipedia explains the plot and character differences.  But I think the main thrust of the story is done quite well and is terrific.  There is also a 47 minute special on this disk as a bonus with David Suchet riding the actual Orient Express before, I think, they filmed this episode.  Quite nice.

And the disk concludes with The Clocks where a girl is sent to a house on a temp assignment and instead finds a body and the blind woman who lives there claims she never asked for a temp.  What is going on?  Poirot figures it out, of course.

These are all dark stories and told with real emotion and sentiment.  Great casts, fine acting, and good period sets.

I am delighted to have these disks.

Mular does a pretty good job explaining the differences between the Poirot ""Movie Collection"" set and the Poirot ""Series"" sets, which really confused me when I started buying the ""SERIES"" Blurays since many of the more recent episodes weren't available on Blu-Ray and I started finding the ""movie collection set"" DVDs, but they both contain the same movies/shows that were broadcast, just not in the same order. As long as you started with POIROT SERIES 1 and have continued in sequential order ending with ""SERIES 13"" you will have all of the episodes; there is no difference between the shows on the ""Poirot The Movie Collection"" and the ones on the ""Poirot Series.""

This is the second to the last set of AGATHA CHRISTIE'S POIROT: SERIES starring David Suchet as Hercule Poirot.

I had originally bought the stand alone Blu-Ray of POIROT: MURDER ON THE ORIENT EXPRESS (http://www.amazon.com/review/R3NPJE6U1T0O9W/ref=cm_cr_rdp_perm?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B003L80FLC - here's the link to my review for that disc) and was surprised by the different characterization of ""Poirot"" by Suchet, which was really dark and short tempered. I can't remember which ""Series"" I had finished I think 4 or 5, while waiting for the Blu-Ray release of the subsequent ones and maybe that's why I was taken aback. I've never watched the shows while they were on the air, so I had to wait for home viewing and would watch back-to-back. When I bought the stand alone ""Orient Express"" Poirot was very different from what I was used to. According to IMDb the show started in 1989 and ""Murder On The Orient Express"" aired in 2010, so the show has been on for quite some time with obvious breaks/gaps in between, and during that time the show morphed from a sequential type series to more feature length films.

Interestingly enough as I was able to go forward and watch the episodes in broadcast order, I was not as off-put by the change in character once I got to MOTOE. Perhaps as the show went on subtle changes in characterization was happening and so it wasn't so stark once you get to that episode, but when you watch from the earlier shows and jump to this one it's very different.

Anyway, this includes the special of Suchet on the real Orient Express.

Definitely pick this up if you don't already have the ""movie collection"" set. If you haven't started with any of the ""Poirot"" series, you don't need to have seen any of the previous ones to enjoy each of these episodes since they work as stand-alone shows. Also, I don't know if they follow the Christie stories to the letter so I can't comment on that but I enjoyed watching the entire series.

***  SPECIAL FEATURES  ***
 ""David Suchet on the Orient Express"" (2009) - 47-minutes:01-second

Suchet even gets to drive the Orient Express on one stretch of track. And you also get to see some beautiful scenes of Venice as David gets to spend some sightseeing time on a quick stop before heading off to Prague.

Halloween Party  Seriously, anyone who couldn't determine ""whodunnit"" within the first 15 minutes just wasn't paying attention.  The real mystery was the motive, of course, But don't blame the stupid story on the actors and producers of this version, which is well acted and nicely done.

Murder on the Orient ExpressI may be the only one who likes Finney best as Poirot, (I do love Suchet too) but this version of the story validates my opinion.  Suchet's version of this classic is dark, cold, foreboding,  unforgiving, and lacks the empathy of the 1974 version.  Despite good performances, I hated this version.  Also Poirot was not a Catholic and certainly not a religious man.

The Clocks -  Give me the divine Anna Massey any day and I'm there.  This is an interesting story, well told and well acted and doesn't deviate too far from the original.",1424649600,,1083,4.789189189189189

Hallowe'en Party was good and The Clocks, keep you guessing.  When he has the mystery writer, Ariadne Oliver, the story moves along more smoothly and interesting than when it is it is just Poirot.  In his later years, he is not the same person as when he started.  He has an edge to him that is not likable  and Adriadne picks it up and smoothes over the rough spots.  Blu-ray is beautiful and when there is outdoor scenery, it is lovely. As usual, Mr. Suchet is the consummate actor and a pure pleasure to watch him work.

In the meanwhile we can seek solace in this set which contains The Three Act Tragedy, The Clocks, The Hallowe'en Party and the much heralded and hotly debated Murder On The Orient Express (including the fascinating documentary with David Suchet taking us on a marvelous journey both enjoying and looking at the famous Orient Express itself).

Long term fans know that as Poirot grew on Christie she allowed him to become much more dark and brooding in the final books and yet retain his peccadilloes right up to the end.  True fans know this and applaud these last productions for keeping the atmosphere of the books intact (the great debate about Murder On The Orient Express aside).

I would unwaveringly recommend the entire series to any newbies or fans who wish to witness one of the great theatrical accomplishments of this or any other century...for David Suchet is indeed one of the greats and his  25 year characterization will be hard put to top for a long long time to come.  The productions are superb in cast, set design, and location shooting that evokes the time Poirot plied his trade flawlessly.  It is just a magnificent series all around.",1402012800,13,1717,4.829351535836177
5723373,5,B00CJ318SE,David Suchet and his portrayal of Christie's Poirot is just outstanding.  The plays in this series were very well done and just so enjoyable to watch.  Always a pleasure to watch this series and why I continue to seek out possible plays or series that I have not had the opportunity to see.,1401494400,,290,4.452830188679245
5723374,3,B00CJ318SE,"As you know by fitting two movies on one disk it has to be compressed more so you lose out on the color and sharpness even on the words like play and others. Even in the series 11 they did not even put in the bonus disk called super sleuths. So were is it? In series 12 it has been out for a year but they just sent it out, are they using your money for other things? The movies are great to watch and they will get 5 stars but the other side they only get 3 stars. It almost seems like they are bootlegged but put two movies on one disk saves money for them. It may be better to just watch it from the library at least you get all the disks.",1401148800,2,642,3.762962962962963

8582378,5,B00CJ318SE,These episodes are getting very close to the end of the series but are some of the very best - I especially love Murder on the Orient Express.  There are some characters which can only be played successfully and memorably by a single actor.  David Suchet is the ONLY Hercule!,1500422400,,275,4.48
