8461113,3,B0057RM1Y4,Overall its a pretty good video of  mostly really old {20'sand30's} cannibal and jungle style cartoons. If you're looking for mostly forgotten or little known toons this will be a good one for you.,1431302400,,197,4.794117647058823
8461114,5,B0057RM1Y4,Love the old cartoons. The way they were originally done.,1408233600,3,57,4.8
8461115,5,B0057RM1Y4,I've seen four of the Thunderbean cartoon DVD'S.  This one is by far the funniest of those I have seen.  At times I simply could not stop myself from laughing at the way the cannibals 'talked' in one of the cartoons. The big black pot for cooking the victims in seems to appear in all of the cartoons. This is classic cartoon making at it's best. To write these off as racist and not view them would be a mistake in my view.  I very much doubt that the average black person would take offense to these cartoons.  We are after all dealing here with South Sea island natives and not the American Negro.  I think Thunderbean must have searched out every cannibal cartoon they could lay their hands on as many of these go back to the late 20's and early 30's. This collection should not be missed by the fan of funny cartoons or those interested in the history of the medium.,1407196800,6,871,4.286585365853658
8461116,5,B0057RM1Y4,"Thunderbean has done another great collection of obscure cartoons, this one centered around cannibals.  Non-PC material at the least but a reflection of the time they were made.  Quality of the originals varies but all are worth watching.  These are not for the average viewer but more for the animation collector.",1386547200,4,314,5.117647058823529
8461117,4,B0057RM1Y4,"As a lifelong fan of classic animation, few things get me worked up quicker than the PC police telling me what's appropriate to watch.  Case in point: there are currently 11 acknowledged cartoons (the so-called ""Censored Eleven"") that have not been shown on television in unedited form since the late 1960's.  There are people who feel these shorts contain racist and/or violent gags that are no longer considered appropriate.  Certainly everyone is entitled to his or her opinion on this matter.  And here's mine: If a 70 year old cartoon upsets you to the point where you not only can no longer watch it, you want to ensure NO ONE ELSE ever gets to see it, you need therapy that no amount of censorship can provide.

Moving on. . .let me first say how delighted I am that Thunderbean Animation has not only given us an unaltered version of one of these cartoons, ""Jungle Jitters,"" but has provided a typically excellent print of the film as well.  And while the other 14 cartoons in this collection haven't been strictly banned from broadcast, many of them would no doubt raise some eyebrows among the easily offended.

The theme here, as the title indicates, is cannibals.  Cannibals and plenty of 'em.  Watch them square off against the likes of Porky Pig, Muff & Jeff, The Little King, Bosko and the original (human) Tom & Jerry.  And while the subject matter may to hard to swallow (ha!) for some, cartoons involving exotic locales and strange practices were common in the 20's and 30's.  The oldest short in this collection actually dates back to 1917.

Collectors might wish to note, however, that several of the cartoons here are available in previously-released collections.  The Tom & Jerry and Little King ones can be found on Thunderbean's own compilations featuring those characters; ""Molly Moo Cow & Robinson Crusoe"" is available on Image's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cartoons-That-Time-Forgot-The-Van-Beuren-Studios-Vol-1/dp/B000QYBQCQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cartoons That Time Forgot: The Van Beuren Studios Vol. 1</a>; ""Korn Plastered in Africa"" is on the company's weird and wonderful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Golden-Age-of-Cartoons-Cultoons-Ads-and-Oddities/dp/B000BQ7JVG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Golden Age of Cartoons: Cultoons! Ads and Oddities</a>; and the Superman short is available on a variety of DVD's.

As usual, the company has done a fine job of restoring these mostly-forgotten gems.  The only complaint I have is with the audio.  Quite often I found I had to adjust the volume on my t.v. between cartoons.  This would have been easy to fix in the mastering process--I do it all the time with consumer-level electronics in making ""mix"" DVD's of my favorite cartoons--so I deducted one star from the overall rating.

Still, if you're a fan of early animation, this is another no-brainer.  I know I'm starting to sound like a Thunderbean employee (I promise I'm not!), but true fans and collectors should seek out all their wonderful collections.  They are doing what the big studios are no longer willing to: Giving viewers credit for having enough intelligence to decide whether something is offensive or not.  In this case it's simple...if you're having cannibals over for dinner, just hide this DVD.  Although, if you ARE having cannibals over, maybe you should be more concerned about the MENU than the evening's entertainment :-)",1325894400,42,3478,5.461682242990654
