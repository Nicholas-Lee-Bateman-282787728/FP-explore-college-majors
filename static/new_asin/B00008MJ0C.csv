7985391,4,B00008MJ0C,"Having purchased this DVD four years ago, I recently viewed it again. Strangely, I liked it even more than the first time I watched it. Maybe it was the mood I was in? And mood is everything with this Japanese film: based on the manga by Junji Ito. The film centers on a small town where an evil, in the shape of a spiral, enters the town causing madness and eventually death. This is a very atmospheric film and may not appeal to all viewers.

What I found fascinating about the film was how the spirals are everywhere. I even began looking at spirals in my living room. Like I wrote earlier, I was in one of those moods. Anyway, the film is not a classic horror, per se, however, it is an interesting and entertaining film nonetheless.

The atmosphere of the film is what really drew me into the film initially. Especially as the viewer you begin to witness different spirals begining to form. Moreover, for a film on a low budget [as this one was] the director, Higuchinsky, did a very decent job. Also, I really liked the acting of the young girl Kirie (Eriko Hatsune) in the film, as you view her witnessing the bizarre creepiness enveloping her town and its residents. Recommended for certain audiences. Rent it first.",1166054400,2,1224,4.509009009009009
