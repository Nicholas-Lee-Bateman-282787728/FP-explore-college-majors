5580521,5,B00BD6KETC,"I love this show, I was worried I wasn't going to be able to watch this season since I don't have cable. I have a Roku. I was so happy to find that amazon has them available the day after they air! :-)",1362355200,,201,3.697674418604651
5580522,5,B00BD6KETC,"Psych is the best show on TV. If you're not watching, you should be. It's always funny, always entertaining. Shawn and Gus are the best duo out there.",1362355200,,150,4.392857142857143
5580523,5,B00BD6KETC,"I love psych very much, and was absolutely heart broken when Henry got shot. I am so happy there is a new season, and I cant wait to sit down and enjoy it with my family.",1362268800,,170,3.75
5580524,5,B00BD6KETC,"After a rather long hiatus I did not think the first episode of this season could live up to my escalating expectations.  Indeed, I could not have been more wrong.  Simplly put, if this episode is any reflection to the entertainment value of the coming season then we, the viewers, are in for a wonderful ride!  The subtle humor,  dramatic counterpoint(but not melodramatic), and inclusion of all the major  characters in this episode, as well as from preious episodes, made for a very entertaining experience.  I loved it!  Prepare for laughter and a few surprise!",1362182400,,565,4.88421052631579
5580525,5,B00BD6KETC,"I love psych! Shawn can make almost anything seem funny, and the creators really create good shows, full of witty comments and jokes. This show is good or anyone who loves solving mysteries and laughing a lot. I hope they make a million more seasons!",1362009600,14,250,4.5777777777777775
5580526,5,B00BD6KETC,"Psych has about four million viewers each week on the USA network.  For some reason, however, the program hasn't become the cultural institution it deserves to be, especially amongst young people.  I suspect that in time this will all be amended: when the wheat is separated from the chaff, Psych will always come out on top.

The narrative format of Psych is conventional, and the production design is generic.  Even so, every week Franks, Roday, et al., manage to draw water from a stone with an incredible cast, a quick humor, and a bright sincerity.  Within a comedy television landscape dominated by irony, sarcasm, banality, sadism, and satire -- Psych goes to show that it is still humor which effects the most authentic laughter of all.

The rapport between Shawn Spencer (James Roday) and his Watson, the ""super-sniffer"" Burton Guster (Dul&eacute; Hill), is without precedent in television: I defy anyone to name a comedic duo with better chemistry.  Roday's timing is as brilliant as it is surprising, and Hill's ""Gus"" is an original character altogether.  Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) delivers such a singular take on the lovable hardhead that you just can't stop rooting for him, while Juliet O'Hara (Maggie Lawson) provides the foil for these shenanigans and still shines in her own right.  Throw Woody the Coroner (Kurt Fuller) into the mix and then you have it: truly unique comedy arrived at through the conventional.  Anyone who gets to know these characters and their chemistry will be hooked, I promise.

The season seven premiere is great and I am excited for the rest of the episodes.  They've updated the special effects used for Shawn's ""visions,"" and it seems like they've even been given a little more dough for their basic cable production.  Roday's turn in the writer/director chair for episode three, ""Lassie Jerky,"" has been the season highlight so far; with Roday proving again that he is as clever on the page and behind the camera as he is at playing Shawn Spencer.  All in all, the quick humor is there, the great performances are there, the positive comedic genius is there -- Psych is truly phenomenal and refreshing show.",1362009600,117,2164,4.958448753462604
5580527,5,B00BD6KETC,Psych is a program that keeps a good sense of morals hidden between the fun and sometimes outright crazy antics of it`s story lines. Already into a 7th season and still this show has more fun and adventurous story lines and hidden life facts to play out.  It can simply PSYCH you out and hopefully NOT END!,1362009600,,306,4.368421052631579

5580531,5,B00BD6KETC,The title of this review pretty much sums it up. If you have enjoyed Psych for what it is and not what you wish it to be (and certainly not for its moral commentary one...anything) you'll probably arrive at the same conclusion I have but enjoy it anyway.,1521936000,,254,4.3125

5580629,4,B00BD6KETC,"The seventh season is really where the show started running out of steam, in large part because the bigger story arcs started to come to a conclusion.  This season includes the 100th episode which is an homage to clue.  It also was supposed to include the musical episode, which was a way to bring back the yang story line, but the musical was pushed back and was included on the season 8 DVD set and not this one.  The two very big episodes are the 7th and 8th of the season which involves a wedding and someone finding out about Shawn and the aftermath of that.  For those who have not seen the show I will not spoil it, but they are the two best episodes of the season, and two of the best in the series (in my opinion).

For those who get the DVDs, the extras are much like what came before.  A gag reel, deleted scenes for most episodes and commentary tracks for some of the episodes.  A lot of material for those who like to go through it.  While the show remained funny, you could definitely get the feeling that it was going to come to an end soon, which really happens to every show.  Still I think for a fan of the show it is worth adding to your collection.",1458086400,4,1168,4.155555555555556

5580651,5,B00BD6KETC,"Fantastic series and season seven is just as funny and entertaining as each of the previous seasons. This one has a new challenge though - the problem: how do the buttoned-down Lassie & his fiance move forward after she's released from prison.

I really enjoy the audio commentary and deleted scenes. But my favorite part is the video commentary performed by the creator Steve Franks and the executive producers and versatile writers. Franks is especially interesting as evinced by his obvious enjoyment with the behind-the-scenes workings of the series and each great episode.

The setting, Santa Barbara, although used in the openers, is actually beautiful Vancouver, B.C. with an occasional portable palm tree.",1439596800,,713,5.300884955752212

5580660,4,B00BD6KETC,"If a show stays on the air long enough, it eventually hits a season that isn't as strong as the others.  Such is the case with season seven of psych.  Yes, the show had some good episodes, but it just started out a little off.

By now the set up is familiar.  Shawn Spencer (James Roday) is a consultant to the Santa Barbara police department homicide division.  But instead of straight up admitting hes a brilliant detective as trained by his father Henry (Corbin Bernsen), he pretends to be a psychic, revealing the clues he has figured out as psychic visions.  In addition to Henry, his best friend Gus (Dule Hill) is also in on the secret.  No one at the police department knows, including Shawns girlfriend, Detective Juliet OHare (Maggie Lawson).  Head detective Carlton Lassiter (Timothy Omundson) is just upset that Shawn solves so many cases.  But Chief Vick (Kirsten Nelson) is just happy as long as the cases are being solved.

This show prides itself on pop culture references and spoofs, which shows itself in some of the episodes of the season.  For example, we get a shaky camera found footage type of story when a trip into the woods for Shawn and Gus to hunt a mythological creature turns up a dead body.  I cant leave out the 100th episode of the show, which not only pays homage to the movie Clue with a murder at a mansion and a fan picked ending but even includes some of the movies cast including name Martin Mull, Lesley Ann Warren, and Christopher Lloyd.

Of course, the season does start out resolving last seasons cliffhanger involving dirty cops and one cast member in mortal danger.  And as the season unfolds, someone else learns Shawns secret, and the unorthodox methods in the department come back to bite everyone in the cast.  Meanwhile, Lassiter gets married, Shawn and Juliet move in together, and their fathers' simple lunch turns into a bazaar case that takes everyone south of the boarder.

Many of these episodes work, and as the season gets rolling, I once again fell under the spell of the show.  But several of the early episodes feel like they are trying too hard to be funny when they really arent.  This is especially true of poor Gus who is reduced to someone constantly talking about food.

Then theres the bizarre parallel universe story.  I gave up trying to even follow that one, it just became too difficult.

However, most of these episodes work well.  The writing is still sharp and the banter between Shawn and Gus still make for great laughs.  Yes, there is a murder each week, but in my mind the comedy is the highlight.  And that is still true here.

The mysteries?  They continue to be good.  They aren't always the most surprising or cleverly plotted, but they always entertain and serve as a good excuse to revisit the characters each week.

The actors know the characters well, and it shows in the acting.  All the performances are top notch each week, sometimes rising above the poor material in the early episodes.  And when we get a more with some more serious issues late in the season, the cast does wonderfully then, too.

Season seven consisted of 14 episodes (the upcoming two hour music was filmed as part of season seven but hasn't aired yet), and they are included in this four disc set in widescreen and full surround.  Extras include the usual deleted scenes and bloopers.

So in the end, fans will still enjoy season seven of psych even if it isn't the strong one to date.  Even lesser episodes of the show still entertain.",1434067200,,3498,4.6158833063209075
5580661,5,B00BD6KETC,"What can I say about Psych? From the first episode to this season, it never fails to entertain me. I love this show so much that I wished it didn't end. Every time I miss Shawn and Gus, I spend the whole weekend watching the whole 8 season. Love everyone in that show.",1433635200,,268,4.0754716981132075
5580662,2,B00BD6KETC,Great until later seasons. The double entendre became insipidly juvenile. We stopped watching altogether. They seemed to get bored with real life and apparently became sex addicts off screen.,1433635200,,191,5.620689655172414

5580669,1,B00BD6KETC,"It looks like in season 7 new writers started writing the script: the show is unrecognizable. All characters act and talk as the same person, just with different voices. Everyone, including women (even sweet O'Hara), took up swearing and saying SOB every five minutes. Story lines became uncharacteristic for 'Psych', especially at the beginning of the season, when the setting was all over the place - from casino/bordello all the way to Mexico. Before buying it, I decided to check it out on Netflix. It was painful to watch great 'Psych' actors acting out someone's confused sick fantasies. It seemed to be written by a person with an imagination and a filthy mouth of a six-grader. The script did get better after the first several episodes, but the swearing did not go away. I decided not to buy seasons 7 and 8, even though I have (and love) all the previous seasons.",1429315200,,873,4.75
5580670,4,B00BD6KETC,"I ordered it all the way from India and the delivery speed was surprisingly good. However, the DVD starts to dysfunction after long use, or during fast forwarding. There aren't many bonus features in this season. And the stories don't have the typical Psych zing and wits, they border on serious and silly. Overall, this is a break from general Psych where both characters face all worldly trouble they could dance away from in the previous seasons.",1427932800,,449,4.8441558441558445

Saw some mixed reviews for season seven but went ahead and bought it anyway. Found that in the first half of the season, the stories were too wacky for my taste and there was too much emphasis on the juvenile humour with very little crime solving going on. The second half of the season was an improvement as the show stuck more to its traditional formula. Not sure if I'll bother adding season 8 to my collection.",1420070400,,559,4.384615384615385

Things seemed to just start going over the top and stupid - it really had run its course.  (again, obviously just my opinion and I know loads of people are going to disagree)

This season is okay, but there is some innuendo and references that I could have done without.",1395187200,,266,4.215686274509804

5580807,3,B00BD6KETC,"Psych was my favorite show ever!

It was so clever, yet grounded in facts and great observation. Sadly, it is turning into a joke. The characters are perverse (Woody) and the story lines are growing bizarre and X rated. I no longer feel comfortable viewing this with young adults because of the strange and bebased plots...

This is very disturbing to me because it was once such an interesting quirky show. It has seriously devolved.

Hopefully they will clean up their act.",1394755200,,475,4.7682926829268295

5580810,4,B00BD6KETC,There comes a point when a long-lasting TV show has to grow there characters more than they can do without materially effecting them. In other words people grow and tv characters should too. Or you retire the show and everyone moves on. That's what I see happening in this season. The writers and actors are up to the task and they're handling it well.,1394582400,,352,4.515625

5580813,4,B00BD6KETC,"Like many of us, I became a fan of this show because I was a fan of ""Monk.""  The writing is good and the acting is good too.  The only complaint I have about the show is that, like Monk and ""Murder She Wrote,"" almost every place these two go, someone dies.  Makes me want to avoid visiting Santa Barbara.  I'll keep watching until the show jumps the shark.  If you're a fan, go ahead and add this one to your library when the price is right.",1394582400,,441,4.022988505747127

5580815,5,B00BD6KETC,"I was always a big fan of this nonsense.  I loved the irreverence that Shawn felt and displayed for nearly everything and everyone especially the pompous, the wealthy, and the holier than thou. Pretentiousness could send into the wildest flights of fancy.  He could be nose to nose with a person looking eye to eye and in his way call them a fool with foolish thoughts and ideas.  His partner and life-long friend, gus, alternated between admiration and oft-times disgust but he always stuck by him even while telling him he is being unacceptably rude and probably wrong and/or a jerk.  Shawns observational and deductive abilities were unparalleled and on par with the likes of Sherlock Holmes.  But, Shawn had his lady-love, as smart and witty as she was beautiful (beauty is in the eye of the beholder) and I stand by my words.  He also had his foil and detractor the always critical and secret admirer head if detectives.  I must mention bis critical but always loving father the tough ex cop. All things considered this show even with its many defects was and still is one of my all-time favorites.  I wish it was still on.",1394409600,2,1128,4.661616161616162

Tons of bad language and sex making it just like all the other shows out there.  They have lost their special touch.  Parents - preview before family watching.  We need more shows like the old psych, not fewer.  Very sad.",1391817600,5,399,4.397260273972603

If you're a Psych fan, this season really stepped it up.  They started to lag for a bit, but I'm impressed with how the season rounded out (I admit the first couple episodes are weird, but if you think of what Shawn was dealing with,... well,... I think you could chalk it up to that).

5580852,3,B00BD6KETC,"After re-watching the earlier seasons, most of Psych season 7 came as a disappointment. There was less of Shawn's cleverness, fewer pop-culture references, more stupid catch phrases (suck it). On the positive side, there was some decent character development and some interesting new characters. Hopefully the production quality goes up in season 8; otherwise the show should just get a decent ending to kill it off.",1391731200,,416,5.318181818181818

Over the years I could see more and more on how there was a bit of a disconnect on the actors. They all seemed like they were ready to move on to something else and I think they will go far. This seventh season isn't one of the best (season 2 & 3 are!!) but it is still quirky, fast witted, and overall a good feel show. I would recommend this show if you just want to kick back and have a laugh. Only psych can make your sides hurt from laughing and there's dead guy in the scene!",1391644800,,628,3.765151515151515

We haven't completed viewing all the episodes yet, as we don't seem to look forward to watching this season as much as some of the earlier seasons.  We don't see much indication of any maturing of the various inter-relationships, at least in the episodes we have watched so far.  There are still flashes of the Psych that we have enjoyed in previous seasons, but there are also long periods where we are just scratching our heads and wondering what the writers were trying to do.  It's still Psych and generally still fun, but maybe the creative well is running dry a little, as we have noticed on other longer running sci-fi series.",1391040000,,698,4.69672131147541

Most episodes had a good concept but was executed poorly, not funny at all. Out of the 14 episodes I would say only 6 are on the level of excellence that Psych is known for. I think the show has new writers or is heading in a new direction- not cool. Usually I can watch Psych endlessly but not this season. In fact, I am thinking about trading this season in.",1390608000,4,496,4.071428571428571

The combination of Shawn and his lack of responsibility, along with Gus' reasonableness, him being the steady upright backbone to Shawn's general lack of discretion and maturity, make these 2 a prefect pair of opposites.

The writing was unique, sassy and unlike anything on the air at that time.
Seeing young-ish men act immature was , briefly, charming.

Unfortunately, the series does not age well.  Seeing a man well into his 30s act like a frat boy...is just very very sad.

Psych should have ended at the end of the fifth season.  And in a sense it did - because there has not be one truly original idea since then. Later episodes are increasingly embarrassing.  One boring ""retread"" after another.  What was initially cute is now just annoying.

If you want to enjoy the series, watch the first three seasons.",1390089600,9,651,4.560344827586207

But it looks as if I'm going to have purchase ""Psych the Musical"" separately; I mean yes the episode has been given good reviews, however I did think I was purchasing a completed series season. It's YOUNG JUSTICE all over again, but this time not only do you have wait FOREVER for the final episode, but you're stuck with an additional cost.  Having to purchase a separate DVD series with 14 episodes, and one with the two hour musical.  ""I'll take corporate greed for 2000, Alex.""  CUHM'ON SUHN!!

I hope I'm wrong about this as the season hasn't ended yet...AWWW YEEEAAAHH!!!

Just purchased Psych the Musical, it was a regular version and considering the episode is two hours, the price balances out.  Ok so maybe it's not $1.89 per hour, at $3.99 it comes pretty close. I no longer feel cheated.",1387584000,,950,4.585798816568047

Totally disjointed without a plot or even a proper ending. It was like an 'improv' drill at a third rate acting school.

How did the director not see this was going to be a wasted effort. Had this been in the first season the series would have not been picked up for a second season.

There is also a gag reel, podcasts, and other assorted bonus items. Although we have seen all the episodes when they aired originally and watched them a second time on our DVR, Pysch is sufficiently well written and hilarious that there is always a reward from repeating viewings. And not just because we are particularly dim witted. Among the many highlights of Season 7 are that Corbin Bernsen survived his shooting in Santabarbaratown, Jeffrey Tambor drags Corbin Bernsen to Mexico in No Country for Two Old Men, Dule Hill takes Rachel's son out for an eventful day at the circus in Cirque du Soul, Timothy Omundson does in fact find true love, James Roday runs for office, and Maggie Lawson remains with Sean even after she learns that he doesn't actually have psychic powers.

5580969,1,B00BD6KETC,"Wow. Did the show get new writers? After the first episode, which was good, the season went downhill- fast!

Shawn has become a rude, selfish, childish imbecile. His quirks in the first 6 seasons that were humorous and somewhat charming are now over the top. He is obnoxious and having him in a relationship with Juliette now seems absurd. No stretching of the imagination makes that work!

The character, Lassiter, was a great straight man to Shawn and Gus' antics. The audience could see him as uptight but could also see that he deserved respect which was his biggest asset as the foil and really made the humor work. Now he is a buffoon and his lines seem forced.

The ancillary characters are also overdone. Woody was weird but hilarious. Now it's just uncomfortable. The chief seems inept and incapable of standing up for herself never mind providing the leadership her position requires. As a woman I say, ""Thanks guys- another inept woman in a position of authority- because if she was in charge the story couldn't be fun. Right.""

The writers also seem to have made it more vulgar without helping the story line in any way. I feel like a fun show that I really enjoyed (I own the first 6 seasons) has been ruined. I am disappointed.",1381708800,7,1241,4.627272727272727

Despite opening with a few promising episodes, Season Seven has been a mixed bag of intriguing new developments, flashes of brilliance, good ideas poorly executed and just plain bad ideas.  The tone of the show feels slighty off at times, the actors almost going through the motions.  Lloyd is a most welcome addition, the Spencer family briefly living under the same roof again was hilarious, the Lassie-Marlowe relationship could have made for an interesting and ongoing conflict for Carlton but instead resulted in the most excruciatingly bad episode to date (""Deez Nups"") and Juliet figuring out that Shawn isn't psychic was anti-climatic and forced.  That said, there does seem to be enough gas left in the tank for an entertaining eighth and final season... after five nearly perfect seasons they've earned the loyalty of this viewer.",1381622400,2,884,5.118055555555555

Much of it I was fine with, but at times it did seem off putting. That and the bile for the transgendered prostitute was just strange for 2013.

Juliet continue to show she is the worst girlfriend ever. Please hook her up with Gus, which would actually work as a couple, and find Shawn a better love interest.

The Clue mini-reunion is nice, but does pale compared to that classic.

5580995,5,B00BD6KETC,"Shawn and Gus have an awesome dynamic.  I've loved this show and been a fan since the begining.  EVERY character is superb in their own role.

Shawn-goofy and fun
Gus-more serious but still hilarious and roles w/ whatever Shawn throws his way
Juliette-my daughter dressed like her for halloween...loves her
Lasiter-plays the serious guy to a T, perfect detective
Dad-seen it all, knows better than to have expectations for shawn any more
Chief-go chief, the working mom
tall goofy police guy-perfect guy for beingthe tall goofy police guy
morgue guy-a newer character and a fun (although a bit over the top occasionally) and funny addition to the show

fave moments:
Gus screaming and running away
shawn and gus run screaming from the sorority house
the super sniffer
the pineapples
princess bride guy as the art theif",1378684800,,818,4.992647058823529

5581019,3,B00BD6KETC,"First -- I'm not really a prude so for something to get my attention like this it has to be pretty strong. I've been a hard core Psych-O for all six seasons and noticed in Season 6 the sex jokes began to get out of hand.

Aside from the expected references Shawn makes about his and Juliet's sex life, in my opinion the show reached a low point when Shawn made the comment in a Season 6 episode about Gus, ""... anymore than Gus can control his bladder during intercourse"".

This line wasn't funny and was actually stupid - and stupid is something Psych has never been! Some viewers don't get that the show spoofs various movies from the past - it's not copying that style it's satire. So to me this is not a negative.

But the sex stuff needs to stop. I get it -- it's not a kid's show but that doesn't mean it has to be crude. So far Season 7 has continued with this line of trashy talk to the point that I may not buy it.

5581028,3,B00BD6KETC,"I've fallen in love with Psych over the past several seasons. It's been a wonderful ride of wit, cute immaturity and awesome detective work. This season, however has degraded some. The first few seasons were new and fresh, then we had the intense Yin and Yang killer laden seasons 3-6, and the budding romance between Shawn and Juliet that was meant to be but always so mistimed... and now?

Shawn and Gus have gone from witty but child-like to crude and adolescent/immature. It's not that they use adult language, it's that the adult language IS the joke, which makes it immensely less funny than it used to be, much like being on the 8th grade playground when it was ""cool"" to swear. Shawn has also... become complacent? It's no longer like he's fighting on the seat of his pants to get cases, to be recognized, hell even when his relationship with Juliet is tested he just acts stupidly immature and not at all like the guy who won her over in the first place(save for like 30 seconds in one episode). Juliet's character has shifted as well. She's a lot more playfully vocal with Shawn, but it seems so much more forced.

I miss the physical acting of the prior seasons too. I know the guys aren't as young as they used to be, but it never was something you had to be that young to do.

There's definitely room to step it up, to say the least.",1375747200,3,1346,4.419354838709677

5581049,2,B00BD6KETC,"I used to like Psych. Not too long ago I was introduced to the show by a friend whose sister happened to be watching it in a marathon format. I was quickly impressed by the quirky humor and wonderful chemistry between the characters. Since then I've watched over half of the episodes in the series and grown quite attached to the colorful cast. Anyways, I anxiously awaited Season 7 (especially after the events of Season 6's finale).

  Unfortunately, something went wrong in the transition to this shiny new season. Most of what made Psych one of my favorite TV shows vanished or at least suffered from severe butchering. Frankly, Psych has almost never had incredible and particularly compelling detective cases (with the exception of the horror themed episodes) so I never go into an episode expecting something amazing along the lines of say Monk or CSI from the plot, rather what defines the show are the hilarious jokes and excellent character interaction that weaves itself around each adventure. Sadly, Season 7 seems to be lacking in every way. Almost none of the episodes featured an interesting plot or memorable humor. There wasn't a spooky-type case and even the finale felt dull and dry, like it was just another typical episode, nothing special.

How about I just break everything else wrong with this Season down into simple bullet points:

-The lack of actually funny humor. Clearly the writers are out of ideas because most of the jokes (90%) were your standard trashy sitcom humor. Potty jokes and a far stronger abundance of sexual humor were the main reason this season fell flat and almost never made me laugh. Don't get me wrong, small amounts of this kind of humor have always been present in the series (and I've never previously been offended or irritated), but to place it front and center and to completely wipe out actual creative comicality burns away the series appeal.

-The annoying romances and the tensions that followed. Everybody seemed to be falling in love this Season of Psych. See, that isn't bad...Unless it hurts the show, which it does. Episodes felt concentrated on things like Gus and his new girlfriend and her kid, Shawn and Jules not getting along, Lassie and that one lady getting married, and even briefly Henry and Madeleine (Shawn's mom) ""doing it"" again. These plots take up most of the season. Most of them (besides the ones involving Shawn and Jules) drag on, sometimes hurting character interaction. For example, Gus is so busy with his girlfriend (and her son) that he and Shawn don't properly work together on cases again until the last several episodes of the season.

-The little things. No child Shawn at all. Over use of the ""Suck it"" song. Oh and did I mention this season has the worst episode of the series? ""Lassie Jerky"" is horrible.  It's an experimental episode gone wrong and I hope it NEVER happens again.

  However, some episodes were moderately enjoyable. ""Santabarbratown 2"", a Psych-take on Lethal Weapon 2 actually had me in stitches, probably because it was co-written by Steve Franks (the original guy behind Psych). ""Right Turn or Left for Dead"" was very compelling and memorable thanks to a creative gimmick involving Shawn imagining a case two different ways based on a key mistake at the end of the episode before. ""Office Space"" felt like classic Psych, with Gus accidently tampering with a murder scene, leaving him in danger of being accused of the crime. The chemistry between Shawn and Gus returned in this episode because Gus' girlfriend was away.

  Finally, season 7 is, unfortunately an important season for Psych fans. It moves the characters forward and even manages to bring up an important issue that's stayed hidden since season 1. This means that if you love the characters, you actually should see this season.
So that's it. I didn't like the season and honestly that's only my opinion. If you've seen season 7, feel free to express your opinion in the comments section. I'd love to get someone else's take on this.",1373932800,6,4016,4.8695014662756595

The characters have always been great, but Season 7 seems to be upping the ante on silliness and immaturity a notch.  While that may sound like a good thing in a comedy, it's a show that you expect the protagonist (Shawn) to mature at least a little bit over the years and to develop meaningful adult relationships.  Season 7 however, was more sophomoric than previous season and seemed more like an ad lib comedy sketch than a well written and directed show in its seventh season.  I'm not going to tell anyone not to watch it, but definitely watch seasons 1-6 first so you can appreciate the show before you jump into season 7 and get disappointed.",1372982400,,856,4.43312101910828

We (my family) like Psych for the Characters, the friendships of the characters, and the corny, but intelligent jokes. The sex jokes, and having them start drinking, mutilating Lassiter's character, and almost ruining Gus, adding too many characters, was too much. Shawn is just plain annoying now without Gus around as much. The Clue episode was their peak of this season. Hope they go back next season.",1370908800,4,524,4.965909090909091

Still unpredictable, with the awesome references to the 80's (my fave time in my life).  This show doesn't get old to me as I have watched all seasons well over 20x's each.  I love the comedy especially, but the chemistry between the actors and storylines are just as good.  These episodes can be seen by any age group yet still keep some of the adult content that only the adults could catch on to.  Truly awesome!

Ok so this season starts off really well, and though a little far fetched in some places, but much more down to earth versus season 6.  Overall I really enjoyed this season, but one thing irked me more than anything: the lie.  Midway through the season, Juliet finds a ticket stub in Shawn's coat jacket and becomes evident that Shawn is using detective skills/photographic memory versus psychic abilities.  Juliet gets all piss-y and breaks up with Shawn for lying to him.  Two problems I have with this 1) Juliet is purported to being a highly intelligent diligent detective and if she really believes that Shawn was a psychic, well I have issues with that 2) Shawn can't when he is cornered about the ticket, he cant come up with a justification of why he had the ticket.  Then in about 4 episodes everything is back to the way it was.  That was a let down, but still loved yet another great season!",1370390400,,925,4.603658536585366

I have particularly been removed from my reality and set into Psych world during this season 7- a very fun season.,1370131200,,375,4.222222222222222

Psych is ""campy fun"" with brilliant writing, acting, and character development like no other. I was weary of all the crime shows with graphic violence and depressing themes. Watching Psych has been a refreshing break that I looked forward to while in graduate school and now while teaching intense subjects in college. For anyone who is complaining about this show, please just go watch something else if you don't know how to have fun and appreciate the talent that goes into making this show. I love it just the way it is, and I don't want it to be like other shows. I was previously a fan of the talented Corbin Bernson and Dule Hill, and now with Psych I'm a fan of the entire cast and writers.

5581145,1,B00BD6KETC,"My family and I LOVED Psych.  We would look forward every week to a new episode and watched all the old ones when they'd come on tv.  We would buy each of the dvd seasons when they became available in the stores. Sure, Shawn is annoying and no one in real life would tolerate his immaturity and childish antics, if you think about it. He wouldn't even be funny in real life. But it used to be more amusing and fun to watch on tv. Now it's almost sad to watch.  Season 7 is like watching someone you know and love who was diagnosed with end-stage cancer and you know it's a matter of time for them now until it's all over. It's as if they fired a talented writer (or writers) and replaced them with some hyper-immature pubescent boys or wasted, drugged-up young 20 year olds. Henry and Gus used to balance Shawn's character out beautifully.  Gus was the respectable one in the duo.  However, season 7 has seen Gus and Shawn constantly telling each other to suck each others' penises.  We get so tired and disgusted hearing that. The show has really dumbed down all the way around. Our son can't watch the show anymore and we find we don't want to watch it either.  It's really gone downhill. Gus' character isn't as intelligent and respectable as he used to be. He has been significantly dumbed down to Shawn's level and acts more immature. Juliet has been ""dumbed down"" now that she and Sean are a ""couple"".  Everyone used to love the ""spark"" between Juliet and Shawn and the tension.  But what a let down now that they are together! She was a complete airhead twit and would do little airhead stereotypical Betty Boop-era ""ooo's"" as Sean would spank her on the bottom in the Clue-based episode.  Juliet's character was once respectable and she was once an intelligent female character that most women could identify with.  Now she is drooling over male strippers and fixating on what she gets to wear to a party (like a ditzy teenaged girl instead of a grown woman) as Sean dances around like a little idiot chanting over and over about how he is going to see other women's ""naked boobs"" at the party.  Then Gus comes over and they both dance around and sing about seeing female ""naked boobs"".  Gus has had some believable, interesting girlfriends in the past, but this current Season 7 girlfriend doesn't ""fit"" with Gus' character and it's hard to warm up to her character or her sulky, sullen son.  She's boring and her character ""deadlines"", which is sad, because the thought of Gus with a single mother is a good concept in itself.  But it's almost as if there is a serious disconnect between Gus's girlfriend and himself.  She is a serious adult single mother almost speaking down to Gus as if he is the babysitter she is giving instructions to.  Lassiter is a fun, warped, quirky, interesting character we enjoy.  We don't need or want to see him the bathtub with his girlfriend, however, just like we don't need to see geriatric Maddie rolling around in the sack in all her wrinkled glory with Henry (though I am proud of a woman for not caving in to plastic surgery pressure in Hollywood.  That takes strength of character and Cybill Shepherd deserves praise for that!  But let's keep things tasteful and less tacky.)  Among other things, these sack-rolling and bathtub scenes undermine characters and what you feel for the character as you watch the show.  The writers seem to be trying to ""soften"" Lassiter's character on the show.  That strips away his intrigue and makes him too much like everyone else.  We don't want a ""softer, gentler Lassie""!  We haven't even watched the last few episodes because the show has been such a let down all the way around.  Unless they can go back to the old formula of writing, Season 6's episodes were the last glory days of Psych.  Season 7 is the kiss of death for the series and a complete waste of time and money, unless you are a pubescent boy or a young, drugged up, wasted 20-something living in a dark, cheap little apartment somewhere. (Yes, they reportedly renewed the show for an 8th season, but that was early-on in the 7th season and we wouldn't be at all surprised to see that recanted/canked.) Whatever writer(s) they got rid of, they need to seriously beg to come back and they need to fire whomever is doing the writing now, because they are destroying the series.  And when less people watch the shows, less people watch the sponsor's ads and we all know where that leads.",1369180800,38,4438,4.562421185372005

They trailed off of that last season and have only intermittently brought it back. He is a mentalist, a cold reader, a super sleuth disguised as a psychic . . . and he is painting himself into a corner. Now that Jules knows his secret, how is he supposed to pull off the act?

5581165,5,B00BD6KETC,"I watched half of the season of psych, it is my favorite series, about a fake psychic detective with a photographic memory and his pharmaceutical rep pal Gus who moonlights as a Private Investigator with his best friend shawn spencer.  The only people who knew Shawn isn't a psychic was gus, his father and know Juliet.  She has tough times handling it, but she sees shawn as a true hero and an excellent detective.  That's one of the major reason why she broke up with him, she reminds me of Rachel Dawes of Batman Begins, when she finds out Bruce Wayne is Batman.  She is an assistant D.A., he is a vigilante and I never understood why she didn't expose him to the cops or arrest him herself.  Same thing with Juliet, she was hurt how come she didn't arrest him or expose him to O'hara or lassiter. Now she treats him like a vigilante. Half of the season, I watched Juliet being hurt when shawn being a fake, some episodes she understood that his fake psychic gave a lot of people hope and something to believe and the people that Shawn helped changed everything in the police department.  Unlike all the cops in here, the reason why Shawn chose to be a P.I. he wants to work his own hours, wear his own clothes and go outside the law catch the bad guys.  Even if he has to break rules to do it.  That why Shawn Spencer is my hero and he reminds me of four of my heros, like Chuck Bartowski, Ferris Bueller, Van Wilder and Xander Harris.

I have noticed the sexual innuendo and indelicate words increase quite a bit, though. I don't watch it with kids so I'm OK for myself. But, I used to enjoy watching this with my niece who is now an adult; so, I can imagine the disappointment of those who would want to share the experience with the whole family. I would have rated this a 5 if not for that aspect, and...

...the Sasquatch episode was pretty much 3/4 sexual innuendo, I just kept waiting for the girl to fall victim already so it would all stop. Unless ""Blair Witch..."" had a similar ""acting"" character, I don't get why she had to be so annoying. Or was she a bad actress, or did the director think it was OK, or ...

5581191,1,B00BD6KETC,"Thus far, Season 7 has taken a turn for the worse.  As a pretty big fan of the first 6 seasons (and as someone who also happens to live in Santa Barbara County), my wife and I have been very disappointed with Season 7 for several reasons thus far...here's why:

#1 - A constant stream of sexual innuendo.  It seems like the writers are running out of fresh ideas and so have resorted to a radical and very noticeable increase in cheap, unfunny innuendo.  Sean and Gus have gone from cute and amusingly immature to vulgar and crudely immature.  Please, get back to the Sean and Gus we enjoy so much. Also, Sean and Jules moving in together is not romantic.  I know this is considered acceptable in today's world, but it's frankly, offensive to others.

#2 - Sean has always been immature, like a grown up kid, who often handles difficult situations with a charming, but awkward childishness - with wit and odd humor, but he is becoming, quite honestly, more of a jerk. The charm is fast being replaced by grating and bizarre version of the old Sean who needs to just learn to shut up.

#3 - The first couple of episodes have transformed from the creativity of past Psych episodes into the bizarre and almost psychotic.  This is PSYCH guys, NOT PSYCHotic.

#4 - We miss the amusing convulsions or ""fits"" that Sean used to display when he had his Psychic visions in earlier seasons...and the more visual clues given by the camera showing us those unique observations which Sean picked up on that every one else missed.

If Season 7 continues along this line, my wife and I plan to stop watching. Now, in a world that is fast losing its discernment, and that is quickly embracing the irrational, the vulgar and the crude as being amusing and normal...these changes to Psyche's past formula may go unnoticed or they may even be welcomed by some...but not by others...even if we are in a minority.

Oh, and one quick note that has nothing to do with the declining quality of the show (IMHO), is an interesting tidbit about Santa Barbara.  The city where Lassy's girlfriend is imprisoned, Lompoc (pronounced ""Lom-poke"" and NOT ""Lom-pock"") does not have a prison for women.  There are many such inconsistencies between the real county of Santa Barbara and the fake Santa Barbara County of Psych.  NOTE:  This does not lessen my enjoyment of the show, but living in this area, we note that MOST of the overhead shots and a few street shots are from Santa Barbara and the surrounding area...but most ground level shots are clearly from Vancouver where the show is actually filmed).",1367539200,53,2571,4.629955947136564

These characters epitomize friendship, loyalty, love, and justice...what more could you ask for from art?

I just think this show is a classic and the writing has been great.  I love screw ball comedies and the writers and producers of this show are spot on with the genre.

(1) the film crew must be using some kind of light-eliminating filter because even daylight scenes have a hue of darkness to them,
(2) the coroner engages in increasingly disturbing behavior that is inappropriate for family viewing,
(3) Shawn lacks any true wittiness in his quips,
(4) for some awful reason Gus is in a legitimate relationship,
(5) the ""psych"" element is non-existent and shawn's photographic memory deduces things even a five-year-old could have picked up on,
(6) the show no longer opens with a flash-back to Shawn's youth where his father teaches him a valuable moralistic lesson that will bookend the episode, instead the show starts with a montage of re-caps that would give a cheap Spanish soap opera a run for its money, and
(7) the show has way too much drama in it.

Until this season, it has been mostly free of ""ugly mouth"" (entirely unnecessary use of profanity and ugly expressions that add nothing to the story).  We have been greatly disappointed that this season, there's been a noticeable shift, with several episodes full of just plain nasty words and attitudes.  It has gone from a show where our whole family could watch (we have 10 and 12 year old kids--they aren't preschoolers! and we used to happily all watch the new episode on Amazon on Thursday nights) to one where my husband and I have now decided we now have to pre-watch the episodes, which takes away from the shared experience and potentially causes riots (if we hit some episodes similar to a few that have been shown and have to say ""no, you can't watch"").

It's frustrating, because the huge uptick in verbal ugliness/nastiness is wholly unnecessary to the advancement of the plot.  Surely Gus and Sean could have a verbal duel without repetitive use of s*ck!  Just shows lack of creativity, which previously had been a hallmark of the show.  We bought all the episodes (and are hooked on finding out what happens to the characters) so we'll watch.

Next there will be a show about a detective who is a hoarder: ""Clutter"".

I gave this show a shot for a few episodes until:

1 - I realized that the black sidekick, whatshisname, I'll call him Rochester, was going to channel the spirits of Amos and Andy for the entire show.
2 - The white guy, er, I'll call him DrunkenFratBoy, slacker mannerisms was not very funny in the beginning and is nerve-janglingly annoying now.
3 - Everyone else on the show acts like lunatics or idiots.

This show is aimed at 14 year olds with ADD, I guess. Or maybe alchoholic shut-ins..

5581273,3,B00BD6KETC,"I have loved this show from the start, and every season has been clever and had me laughing out loud, and surprised me with twists.  I have been disappointed with several episodes from this season so far - it's hard to describe why except that the show has just gotten ""silly"" - like the bigfoot episode.  I am hoping it gets better as the season goes on - the last one I saw was a little better.",1365465600,13,396,4.12987012987013

5581277,5,B00BD6KETC,"Psych is incredible. It's just one of the best shows out there.
After 6 hilarious seasons, Psych has come to it's 7th Season.

- Santabarbaratown 2 - A disappointing start. Not high concept enough, not funny or original enough, though it has its moments, and they're incredibly funny!

- Juliet Takes a Luvvah - Funnier, higher-concept, and better then the first episode. Still, a little too much drama and not enough comedy (though certain parts are hilarious)

- No Country for Two Old Men - Good episode. Funny characters, funny comedy.

- Lassie Jerky - Hilarious, fast-paced, witty, and high concept, Lassie Jerky is a sure winner. James Roday never disappoints as a director. Psych is back on track.

- 100 Clues - One of the all-time funniest episodes, 100 Clues is by far the best that Season 7 has to offer yet! Great characters, non-stop jokes, engaging plot, and a fun spoof, 100 Clues holds it's place in the Psych pantheon.

As for me, I can't wait for the rest of the episodes...Juliet Wears the Pantsuit...Psych: The Musical...the future looks bright indeed! Watch Psych, you won't be disappointed!",1365379200,,1113,4.862433862433862

5581280,5,B00BD6KETC,I enjoy watching Psych after a long day at work.  It reminds me to not take myself so seriously.  Sean is silly and Gus is getting more gumption against Sean's mischievous vices.,1365206400,,178,4.53125
5581281,2,B00BD6KETC,"Unfortunately the characters this season are looking a little played out.  In fact, WHERE ARE the characters this season.  The Sean character seems to be hogging up a LOT
of screen time,followed by a REALLY wimpy Gus.  The 3rd screen hog is the girlfriend, played a little too seriously (now boring), Juliette.  Where's the father or the Chief?
Even Lassiter has been reduced to only a few small lines here and there.  The Sean character is great, in small doses.  When he's balanced by the other actors.  And everyone know a Series Jumps the shark when 2 of the lead characters sleep together in real life.  Now Sean and Jules are boring and honestly, not very well matched.  They don't really give a reason whey their even still together.  And Gus apparently has a vagina now....  I think I'm going to have to jump the shark with this series, as much as I really liked it.  It's kind of like True Blood...  They have too much press and popularity to realize that now....  they kind of suck as a series.  Oh well...",1365120000,6,1016,4.5054945054945055

5581288,2,B00BD6KETC,"Me and my boys loved Psych.  But I think the guys are getting tired of producing.  I felt it was more of the guys having fun but being bored at the same time, than a professional attitude. Not to mention that each episode of season 7 is lacking that closure that each episode of season 1-5 had. Now it is more like ""so what?"".  Actors are getting sloppier, writers are getting sloppier... Looks like a final season, even though they announced season 8.  I miss childhood flashbacks and moral of each episode. Now it looks more like a bunch of actors fooling around, with no clear directions.",1365033600,20,591,4.4953271028037385
5581289,4,B00BD6KETC,This show had to evolve and I think it has.  I was worried when romance began to flare up because that often can mean the end of a show... but this time it seems to be working.

5581311,5,B00BD6KETC,"I typically don't like comedy programs but this is probably the funniest and most entertaining TV show ever.  You fall in love with their mannerisms (you got that right!) and their low-key humor - with no idiot laugh tracks.  The synchronosity between Sean, Gus, Lassiter, Juliet, Henry is just beautifully amazing.  Sean and Gus (and Lassie) are always clever and often annoying  - but you gotta love them in spite of it.

Juliet - what's not to like?  Beautiful, down to earth, accepting of the flaws in her companions, probably the most mature of the group but goes with the flow. And none of if would be fun without grouchy, but wise and ""with it"" Henry and ""by-the-book"" cop Lassie.  Then there is Chief Vick who keeps everyone in line, while creating a family connection with the group.  Strong but willing to take a chance with Sean and Gus because they get results, no matter how insane the approach.

The twists and turns and unique crimes and mysteries that make up the plots of each show keeps you watching every minute and loving it.  This is the only program that I have thoroughly enjoyed re-watching old episodes 2,3 or 4 times. If you like a program where you can get to know the characters and appreciate the true connections that the cast has, this is one that will pull you in with its unique way of keeping you entertained every minute of the show.",1364515200,,1368,4.569672131147541

5581314,5,B00BD6KETC,"I love Psych. I rated this 5 stars because I love the pop culture references, the cast, most of the plot and especially -viewing something that really makes me laugh each and every episode.

Although, I didn't care much for the Bigfoot episode, shot (I think) using a single lens. I don't expect all episodes to be super-awesome, but I would've personally prefer this episode shot more traditionally. Not too crazy about 'family man' Gus, either. At least give him a quirkier girlfriend:)

If there were a way to give 4.5 stars I would, but I'd rather give 5 stars, than 4.",1364515200,3,573,4.607843137254902
5581315,2,B00BD6KETC,"I have avidly watched this series since season 1. Though I'm not a product of the 80s, I loved the jokes and references they made. I loved how they opened the episodes with flashbacks to the childhoods of Shawn and Gus. I loved how Shawn was silly and ridiculous and man-child on the outside but had more depth on the inside. The show was funny and original. My all-time favorite episode is the season 2 finale, Shawn (and Gus) of the Dead. It was so quotable and laugh-out-loud funny.

What changed?

I have to say that if the series started with the episodes of season 7, if this was the premiere season of Psych, I would not be a fan. It is one thing to have a show grow and change over time and develop, but Psych has not made this change for the better. Psych is now focusing too much on making parodies of shows and movies and culture of ""today"" (such as Finding Big Foot and online dating). It isn't as original as it used to be. It seems as though Psych has gone downhill into the TV trap of subliminal advertising (like for Snyders of Hanover pretzels), trying to get big stars into the episodes in some form or fashion, and over acting.

Am I the only Psych-O who thinks that the characters of Gus and Lassie have crossed the line into the realm of the over ridiculous? They don't balance Shawn's silliness anymore. To make up for it, Jules has become the generally ""serious"" one. I miss the classic Psych of the earlier seasons (with 2 being my absolute favorite season as a whole).

Will I still watch the show? Yes but only because I've been a fan for so long. I honestly don't believe that I would have been hooked by this series if the material they're putting out there now was exemplary of the classic Psych. I really hope it gets better because it's really taking a turn for the worst in my opinion. I want my laugh-out-loud funny, quotable Psych back. I want the witty, original comedy that is iconic of the earlier episodes.

I miss the small things like ""I've heard it both ways"" and even Shawn doing his hyperobservant thing and focusing on different clues. The ""C'mon, son"" catchphrase is ridiculous and not in a good way. Give me Psych back!

Sincerely,
A Disappointed Fan",1364515200,51,2196,4.423267326732673

5581319,5,B00BD6KETC,"I have a huge sense of humor, comedic timing and had thoughts of becoming a stand-up comedienne a while back, so keep that in mind when I say that, in my belief, Psych is in the top 2 of comedy tv shows (the other is Monk).

Now, let's be real, not every episode is going to bring guttural laughter, but this episode did. The writing, camera work, directing, sound effects, lighting and acting were superbly executed. All the ingredients of a who-done-it mystery were in the mansion, including the proper obedient butler, potential would-be killers, food, a chocolate room and a panther. Come on, what else could you ask for? Maybe a black cat - yeah, okay, the black cat was not there, but, I, for one, did not miss it and you won't either.

Two other thoughts, thru season 6 and thus far into season 7 the show has been somewhat lacking. The genius evident before is missing. But to be fair it is difficult maintaining fresh and original ideas when approaching your 100th episode. We will continue to watch in the hope they step it up. The other, we do not have cable or any other means of watching the USA network. Our access to previous seasons has been thru Hulu and Hulu Plus shortly after airing. This year the FIRST episode is on both with nothing since. The ONLY place we have been able to find additional episodes has been to pay for each on Amazon Instant Streaming and it seems they have exclusive rights, I have looked extensively!

Reps name is Lee S. great job

What gives? Audio works fine for first 3 episodes. Works fine on my iPad. Video fine no audio on episode 4.",1363996800,,332,4.15625
5581339,5,B00BD6KETC,I have liked Psych for a long time. This season is proving to be just as funny as the others have been. This show is great and I recommend it for people who want something that will make them laugh. It's great for those late nights when I wake up and can't go back to sleep. I might as well enjoy the time!,1363996800,,306,3.873015873015873
5581340,1,B00BD6KETC,The sound does not work on the HD versions.  I paid for these and have only been able to watch the SD versions due to this problem.  Amazon has been working on fixing this for a while now.,1363996800,2,188,3.9210526315789473
5581341,5,B00BD6KETC,"Season seven has started off just as good as the past six! Good episodes thus far, and the characters keep growing on you.",1363910400,,122,4.3478260869565215
5581342,3,B00BD6KETC,"These episodes are not the Pysch have grown to laugh and love! No belly laughs as with previous seasons!  Disappointed, but still hoping things get better!",1363910400,3,155,4.961538461538462
5581343,5,B00BD6KETC,"I love this show, it is so funny!  I love the fact that the picture was great and that there was no commertial!  It is a must see!",1363737600,,130,3.607142857142857
5581344,5,B00BD6KETC,"This is a fun, lighthearted detective comedy.  My wife loves this show. The repartee between Gus and Shawn is one of the best things about the show.  Lots of 1980's movie and tv references too.",1363737600,,193,4.485714285714286
5581345,5,B00BD6KETC,Quirky cookie and downright stupid but very pleasurable to watch. Great cast they work well togeather to solve crimes in Santa Barbara. If you like detective shows you will love this one.,1363737600,,187,4.875
5581346,4,B00BD6KETC,"There is definitely something different about this season. I give the past seasons a 5, but so far this one has a lot more ""sex"" humor, and the episode about Big Foot was markedly less funny than usual. Stick to the old school humor and 80s references we love, and concentrate more on the mystery/ plot aspect.",1363737600,,310,4.456140350877193
5581347,2,B00BD6KETC,"Having watched Psych from it's beginning we were looking forward to the new season but we are greatly dissapointed because Psych has become less family friendly.  The children just loved it but so far they have only been able to see the first episode, it's no longer a part of family night.",1363737600,7,290,4.576923076923077
5581348,5,B00BD6KETC,This season is the best yet.  I find myself laughing till I hurt almost every episode so far.  I don't know what the shakeup was with the writers but it worked.  It's great.,1363737600,,173,4.181818181818182
5581349,5,B00BD6KETC,"Psych is unbelievably funny, while dealing with serious investigations.  You get to try to figure out the crimes alongside the detectives while enjoying the zany antics of the characters.  My favorite part of the show is the way they create and evolve the characters and their relationships with each other.  It's truly some of the best writing on TV.",1363737600,,351,4.915254237288136
5581350,3,B00BD6KETC,"Subject matter has become too adult (sexual) to let any of my kids watch.

Its a shame, because we all enjoyed earlier seasons.

I won't be subscribing to any future episodes.",1363737600,12,175,4.612903225806452
5581351,5,B00BD6KETC,"Psych is just plain fun!  The characters are excellent, the stories are entertaining and just plain fun.  The premise of the show is innovative and leaves endless possibilities for story lines.  James Roday and Dule Hill do an amazing job leading this series, but the supporting characters played by Corbin Bernsen, Maggie Lawson, and Timothy Ombusdman are also first rate.

Every single episode is a pleasure.",1363737600,,410,5.166666666666667
5581352,5,B00BD6KETC,Hilariously witty.  It kept me laughing without ceasing.  I'm a fan of Psych.  It's super funny without being raunchy most of the time.,1363651200,,135,4.782608695652174
5581353,5,B00BD6KETC,"Now I might be a little bias only because I love this show but season 7 has been pretty good so far. I will say this, episode three of season 7 (I believe it is called ""Lassie Jerky"") was not very good. Very poor episode which kind of broke my heart because I usually love every episode. But honestly, so far season 7 has been quite good and I would definitely recommend this show to anyone and everyone.",1363651200,,404,4.1923076923076925
5581354,5,B00BD6KETC,So far this season has not dissappointed and that is hard to do with high expectations. I found this season funny as ever.,1363564800,,122,4.3478260869565215
5581355,5,B00BD6KETC,"I LOVE PSYCH!!! I Love Shawn and Gus, Juliet, Carlton, Karen, Henry, Madeleine and Buzz! I Loved Pierre and the other creatively cast guest stars, when they were there! I love its mysteries with their intriguing, ingenious and wacky, action and character driven plots! Shawn, played by James Roday, who also writes and directs some episodes, has a sense of humor probably only he and GOD truly understand, that can ""miraculously"" transform me into a happier individual ... for hours sometimes! THANK YOU to the entire cast and crew, for a wonderfully heartwarming, laugh out loud funny show! Please, PLEASE keep on ""psyching us out""... for many years to come!!!",1363219200,,661,5.0181818181818185
5581356,5,B00BD6KETC,It is a great show.  I just had to find out what happened to Henry.  The play back was wonderful.  Well worth the money.,1363219200,,120,3.9166666666666665
5581357,5,B00BD6KETC,"If you are looking for a show that has a whole lot of witt and humor, Psych is it. My husband and I love it and it is the only show he is willing to watch re-runs of! Even after watching certin episodes like 3 times, they still get that gut laugh from us :)",1363219200,,257,3.690909090909091
5581358,5,B00BD6KETC,Fantastic episode. Psych has never let me down in regards to making me burst out laughing at least once an episode. Well done.,1363219200,,126,4.521739130434782
5581359,5,B00BD6KETC,Only two episodes in and I am loving how this season started.  I most definitly can't wait to see how it ends!!,1363046400,2,111,4.045454545454546

5581362,5,B00BD6KETC,"Im a gamer and play alot of video games and have almost stopped watching TV. between work and video games i miss so many shows. I hear people at work talking about Walking Dead, Its Always Sunny in Philadelphia, All these Reality Shows and i didn't care. But the only show i make time for is PSYCH. This show is so funny and amazing in fact i started calling my blue honda civic the Blueberry too. I got Netflix a couple months ago and watch the entire 6 seasons. I couldn't wait for season 7 and was stoked that they picked up season 8. I love all the characters Gus is this best friend i never had and love the quirky names Shawn gives him. Fellatio del toro is my favorite hahaha , I wish i had a cool girlfriend like Jules that put up with my shenanigans. Ever since i started watching the show i was like when when are they gonna finally started dating. i wish i had a boss like Chief Vick. Lassie is this hardheaded guy that you cant help but love. Shawn and his love hate relationship with his dad so perfect i love the christmas episode when they had this tradition of guessing each others gifts it was hilarious. I love shawn but sometimes i just want to punch him in the face for not listen and he has a way of talking himself out of trouble. Every episode im like OMG Jules is gonna break up with you for not listening to her. I hope Despereaux the art thief makes a return him and Shawns little relationship is funny. Im hoping for more guest stars. 8 seasons for me is not enough i need 9 or 10. Can wait til i get all of the seasons on Blu Ray",1362960000,6,1557,4.091503267973856

5581364,5,B00BD6KETC,Psych never disappoints and season seven is off to a great start. Glad to hear that they got picked up for an 8th season already they deserve it the cast is just perfect and like always you can't make it through five minutes of any episode of this show without laughing. Highly recommend!!!,1362787200,20,290,4.490566037735849

8566611,1,B00BD6KETC,"My daughter is OBSESSED with this show, it makes me crazy. She doesn't even respond when her name is called, I think she doesn't remember it. She now goes by Gus. This show is called psych because it messes with your psyche. It changes your mind, heart, and human soul. This show is total TRASH and influences the minds of little children. Don't ever watch this. If you have children you will understand. It doesn't matter what people say, this show is worse than drugs. It gets children addicted, ruins their family lives, and their social lives. Please, please, please keep your children away. If not for you for them. You need to trust me! Now I must go reprimand my daughter for watching this CRAP. Belive me if you watch this you will regret it!",1527811200,,750,4.522058823529412
