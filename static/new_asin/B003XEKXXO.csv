4216371,4,B003XEKXXO,"This was our daughter's first Ni Hao Kai Lan DVD!  She enjoyed it very much, and we appreciated the story.  Some of the shows on this DVD we'd already seen, but good to have and pop in when needed.  Delivery was smooth, got right before Xmas.  Thanks!",1328572800,,251,4.276595744680851
4216372,4,B003XEKXXO,"We watched Kai-Lan on netflix until they stopped streaming it.  My 3 yr old missed it so I bought this one.  She's REALLY sensitive and is scared of the princess Kai-lan episode on the first one, I guess it's a little too suspenseful or dramatic or something.  She likes the other two episodes so we still watch it fairly frequently.",1309564800,,333,4.516666666666667
4216373,5,B003XEKXXO,Ni Hao Kai-Lan: Princess Kai-Lan is an excellent video. I purchased it for my 4 year old granddaughter's birthday. She absolutely loved it!! I received excellent service and speedy delivery with my order as well.,1307059200,2,212,5.085714285714285
4216374,5,B003XEKXXO,My little one loves Kai-Lan and we already owned one DVD but it was getting played way to much so I purchased this one and it's great. Good price for 3 episodes and some extra bonus features. Some DVDs were only offering 2 episodes for more than this one cost. Happy with this purchase. Would recommend to other parents!,1302825600,4,320,4.440677966101695
4216375,5,B003XEKXXO,My children love Kai Lan which I am very thankful for because I can not stand Dora.  Kai Lan teaches problem solving and how to get along with and share with others.,1300233600,,165,4.15625
4216376,5,B003XEKXXO,I ordered this for my 2 1/2 year old Kai-Lan fanatic.  It is very cute movie and kind of funny for adults to watch (the first 5 or so times).  My daughter loves and is all the more Kai-Lan obsessed.,1293148800,5,198,3.925
4216377,4,B003XEKXXO,"I bought a series of Ni Hao Kai Lan as a teaching aid to help my kids learn Chinese in a fun way. It has served its purpose as a good introduction, however parents should not rely on it to teach anything more than a few words here and there. One Chinese word is spoken for every 100 used in English, which is not ideal.",1399939200,,319,3.923076923076923
4216378,3,B003XEKXXO,The kids really love this DVD.  They love singing the songs on the Princess of Friends episode.  Kai-Lan was their first cartoon they liked.,1397692800,,140,4.791666666666667
4216379,5,B003XEKXXO,My grand daughter loves this show and bounces up an down to the music. My son is teaching her Chinese with the help of these DVD's. She already knows what several words mean and she hasn't even started talking yet. Would definitely by from his merchant again. AAAA++++,1397606400,,268,4.604166666666667
4216380,5,B003XEKXXO,"If my grandchild could spell she would say that Kai-Lan is her favorite. As the adult that usually watches it with the child, I am often impressed. There aren't many shows that can deal with emotional topics on the preschool level. Kai-Lan does it. The show explores emotions: how people express emotions; what may cause the particular emotion; how to understand and resolve emotional issues. Children will find the characters lovable and will be able to relate to them.",1391731200,,470,4.962025316455696
4216381,5,B003XEKXXO,This movie is good quality. Shipping was great. I ordered this for my granddaughter and she watches it over and over. We are very pleased with this product.,1389225600,,156,4.607142857142857
4216382,5,B003XEKXXO,I hunted for this in stores (several) and could not find it.  It was a Christmas present for my granddaughters and they love it!  A very good buy and arrived quickly and safely!,1388793600,,177,4.333333333333333
4216383,5,B003XEKXXO,This has good messages for children. One of the best they air. And a little of Mandarin teaching to boot.,1387929600,,105,4.3
4216384,5,B003XEKXXO,"Arrived on time.  This is the 5th set of DVD Princess Kai Lan that I brought,
I have been giving them away as gifts to all the little children in my family , they
are big Kai Lan fans and love her and her friends.  This DVD tell how Kai Lan became
a Princess , the 2nd one I buy is Kai Lan goes to China , these 2 are a perfect set
to give away and the price for these are good.",1385424000,,378,3.5421686746987953
4216385,5,B003XEKXXO,"My daughter loves Kai-lan!  She repeats all the words and even the chinese words which she uses when communicating with the family. Love that!  I wish they would make more episodes and put them on DVD.  We have purchased all of them and she loves them all.

I would recommend this to a friend - great learning tools and fun to watch.",1379289600,,333,4.32258064516129
4216386,4,B003XEKXXO,"Especially the episode on the Moon cake festival.. she will grin when they sing etc...

The episode where the gang go to Lulu's is good as well. In addition to my daughter liking it, it also teaches her to try new things.

Overall great DVD at an even better price!",1377129600,,265,4.28
4216387,5,B003XEKXXO,My wife is Chinese and my daughter showed little interest in speaking the language until now. Now she thinks it is pretty cool !,1374105600,,128,4.375
4216388,5,B003XEKXXO,my 4 yr old grandaughter loves these movies. I couldn't find any of them in the stores so I was very glad to be able to find them on the amazon. I like the fact that each one of these kinds of movies teaches  about different cultures and lifestyles in a way that is interesting for little kids.,1371427200,,294,4.068965517241379
4216389,5,B003XEKXXO,This was a gift for my granddaughter and she loves Kai-Lan so this was a great choice and she was very happy.,1366329600,,109,4.0
4216390,5,B003XEKXXO,"I have said it in previous reviews, my daughter loves Ni Hao Kai Lan. So I am always happy to find new DVDs to add to her collection. But I have to say, this is one of my favorites. :)",1366156800,,184,3.625
4216391,5,B003XEKXXO,"We adore Kai-Lan!  These shows are not cheesy and annoying like Dora.  Although the Chinese they teach is minimal and disjointed, it does introduce your children to cultural concepts emphasizing compassion and compromise.",1364947200,,221,5.666666666666667
4216392,4,B003XEKXXO,"The company that sent this dvd along w/other dvd packed in cardboard box that was study. The disc was clean, smooth & without any blur marking. There was no skipping while the disc was playing in my van and my kids loved the video. The cover looked new.",1364601600,,253,4.291666666666667
4216393,5,B003XEKXXO,My 2 year old love Ni Hao Kai Lan. The songs are so catchy and you learn so basic Chinese. Great show this is my favorite Dvd. If you like it check out the Going to China one as well. Each Dvd comes with 3 episodes so it's well worth the price.,1364083200,,244,3.7115384615384617
4216394,5,B003XEKXXO,"I had not seen this show before buying this dvd other than a promo in a Yo Gabba Gabba dvd so I was expecting something girly. I bought it thinking probably my son won't like this but it was at a great price so I figured I could pass on to my niece. Put it one one day when he was a little cranky and he instantly was liking this show. I also enjoyed watching it. Cute characters (my favorite is Ho Ho even thought he is a bit whiny about things being different and he doesn't want to try anything new and he is a bit dramatic about the moon being hid by the clouds at the festival) and good example for your kids to learn to get along with others, try new things, and to handle disappointment in a positive way. I am going to see about buying some more Ni Hao Kai-Lan dvds. You don't learn a ton of chinese but its fun to say the words and it is a good way to get kids interested in learning more. Best snacks to eat while watching this: Banana Crackers, Lychee fruit, and Steamed Dumplings! Hope this review is helpful to somebody.",1364083200,,1033,4.068627450980392
4216395,5,B003XEKXXO,"Great Movie!  Very good content, everything was great.  Yes it has met my expections.  You learn about China. Thank you.",1363132800,,120,4.9
4216396,3,B003XEKXXO,"The animation and story are cute, but like all the Kai-Lan videos, they need a lot more Mandarin if you intend for them to be for bi-lingual kids.",1360540800,,146,4.25
4216397,5,B003XEKXXO,Great dvd for the kids. They love watching it over and over so I definitely recommend buying it from Amazon along with the other Kai-Lan dvds.,1360195200,,142,4.5
4216398,5,B003XEKXXO,"We love Kai Lan.
Wish there were more of them.
There are only a couple of chinese phrases in each, similar to Dora.",1357516800,,115,4.043478260869565
4216399,3,B003XEKXXO,"This is a cute cartoon and my son loves it. The cartoon is helping him improve his English.

yes, English.

There is only very little Chinese, probably no more than what we all already know, e.g. ""Nee How"".

While there is a little bit about the Chinese wall and the monkey King (keyword here is ""about""), the dialogs are in English, the songs are in English, and the little there is about Chinese culture is a very American vision (""this is such a great wall!"") and the drawings are basically Japanese.

I am VERY disappointed because I was under the impression that it was a cartoon to teach kids about China and the Chinese language. I may have been wrong about my expectations, but I expect other parents here are also looking for a DVD for their child to learn some Chinese. There is only one audiotrack, not even a Chinese language version!

There doesn't seem to be any Chinese Hanzi characters either.

Besides that, I also think it's lame, but then I'm 40 so perhaps too old to appreciate it.

My son is currently learning Chinese thanks to a Mickey Mouse DVD with dual track English-Mandarin. But certainly not thanks to Princess Kai-lan.",1355788800,,1148,4.598039215686274

4216401,1,B003XEKXXO,"I just bought it new! But this DVD stopped working at the ""Moon Festival"" episode.  The quality of this product is bad/ poor. My kid is loving this DVD, but she is mad that she can't watch the whole story.",1350604800,,205,4.125
4216402,5,B003XEKXXO,"My 3 yr old daughter has loves watching the Princess Kai-Lan DVD. She asks to watch it very often. I love to watch Kai-Lan with her and was excited to see one of our favorite episodes,""Moon Festival"" We love the theme song and we sing it at night together when we look for the moon. :)",1349222400,,285,4.107142857142857

4216405,5,B003XEKXXO,My granddaughter loves Kai-Lan and she cannot watch Kai-lan in her area now.  It shows way after her bedtime.  I am buying her several of the dvds so she can watch it anytime she wants to.  She loves Princess Kai-Lan and all the videos I order from Amazon.  It's a really cute story and teaches some Chinese and some lessons about friends.,1335484800,,339,4.419354838709677
4216406,5,B003XEKXXO,My 1 1/2 year old loves Kai Lan. He dances to the bear and fox dance and really gets a kick out of the whole dvd. We've bought many Kai Lan dvds and I think this is his favorite.,1333843200,,178,3.58974358974359
