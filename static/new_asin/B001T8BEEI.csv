8340811,5,B001T8BEEI,"Love it! A classic old Russian folk tale translated into the movies. A favorite of mine since childhood, the struggle of Ilya Murametz against the Tatars is wonderfully exotic, right down to the absolutely marvelous knife dance of the beautiful Tatar woman. Great music. Excellent acting. Good direction. And best of all, no politically correct nonsense about loving the enemies of civilization; they beat the c**p out of the greedy evil Tatars and chase every last one of them out of Russia. Definitely worth watching.",1468195200,,519,5.117647058823529
