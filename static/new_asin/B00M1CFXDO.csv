6546386,3,B00M1CFXDO,"The 2 psychos were pretty convincing sadists.  Ms Easterbrook was good as usual, big fan of her work.  Kind of a twist ending I didn't quite expect.",1412812800,,148,4.444444444444445
6546387,5,B00M1CFXDO,"This film gets high marks for its homage to 70's films feel, but incorporates elements uniquely modern.  Those who are critical of the subdued Moseley and Easterbrook characters, miss the director's intent of  the 'cold evil' in this mild-mannered pair: living the life of a rich MD and wife while committing horrible acts 'for the good of the planet'.  (Reminds me of mega-corporations!)
I love the over the top performances of the 'bad guys'; Dave Willis, where have you been? Kudos to the totally believable performance of Callie, who transitions from heartbroken to ... well, a different kind of heartbroken..
Excellent  production quality and the unexpected elements of humor in this film; can't wait to see what Mikolas has in store for us next time.",1412035200,,756,5.024
6546388,3,B00M1CFXDO,"This movie is very Last House On The Left  Meets  House Of The Devil although both  aforementioned films are superior to (House Of The Witchdoctor).
While it's entertaining, it is nothing special, although much better than a lot of straight to DVD slashers this year. The best thing about it was the small roles by Leslie Easterbrook and Bill Moseley.

It held my interest because it jumped in head first and went straight into the action and mayhem as the Two main protaganists kill a drug dealer and rape his girlfriend. Not that I enjoy rape,I don't but it's part of the storyline.

Its  another film that morphs from one genre to another. In the beginning it's about two petty criminals strung out on ice that rape and murder their victims via home invasion. Then in the third act it becomes very House Of The Devil with human sacrifices and demons.

There was some gore but don't let anyone fool you into thinking its an all  out gore fest ,it wasn't but there was enough to satisfy a slasher fan and it was done well for what it was. There are three rapes a decapitation,some slit throats ,gunshot wounds and stabbings.",1412035200,7,1125,4.562189054726368
6546389,5,B00M1CFXDO,"As a horror movie aficionado I was excited but nervous to watch this. I can happily say I have a new addition to my top 10 list of favourites. HotWD has everything I look for in a good horror flick . The humour is perfectly irreverent, the nude crying shower scene is perfect, the twist is somewhat expected but beautifully executed. And even better .. there's a 2nd plot twist that's unexpected. And Bill Moseley .. ! What more do you need ?

To avoid being repetitive let me just say I agree wholeheartedly with the other (positive) reviewers and can't wait to see what Devon Mikolas brings us next .

BUY THIS NOW :)",1411430400,2,619,4.373913043478261
6546390,4,B00M1CFXDO,"Where the 70's left off 2014 begins anew with this film. In a genre long over due for a reboot House of the Witch Doctor does just that. It mashes gore and wit while enabling both established stars and the next wave to shine in this passing of the torch. With a salute to the classic films it firmly leads the charge ringing in the future of horror. I watched it with some friends who weren't horror fans and they enjoyed it, a tough thing to do for a film to be true to its fans while attracting new ones. Get the film, turn off the lights and break out the popcorn, House of the Witch Doctor is a winner!",1411257600,5,606,4.058333333333334
6546391,5,B00M1CFXDO,"Not a horror film fanatic, but thought it was absolutely AWESOME!  There certainly was gore, but the underlying humor kept me captivated from beginning to end.",1411084800,2,159,5.115384615384615
6546392,5,B00M1CFXDO,"OK, so normally I don't write reviews here. But I couldn't help myself...I LOVE this film. It's truly terrifying, and there's a real shape and story to it. I was invested in the characters, even the evil ones. Sitting on the edge of my seat, I shouted ""kill him!"" at the screen multiple times. There is plenty of sex and gore and violence; but it's all used incredibly well and helps develop the characters or further the storyline. As a writer and artist, I appreciate the script. It's believable but still totally thrilling, with a twist of dark magic. My boyfriend and I love it so much, we're going to use our at home projector for a Halloween screening of it.

I urge anyone who likes horror films, or anyone that's looking for a good film and can handle graphic images, to see House of the Witchdoctor.",1410998400,9,808,4.496598639455782
6546393,4,B00M1CFXDO,"If you love horror films as much as Wes Craven and Eli Roth, than this movie is for you! In fact, it's quite Alexander Aja-esque (re: ""The Hills Have Eyes"" reboot).

From start I finish I was on the edge of my seat feeling a plethora of emotions and experiencing a myriad of reactions. I laughed, squirmed, got caught off guard and even got spooked! This picture has it all; gore, demonic possession, hot coeds, jump scares and comedic reliefs for when the true terror that drives this production from filmmaker Devon Mikolas seems as if it will never end...

I saw the trailer for this hidden gem and torture porn fans' wet-dream while searching for Eli Roth's latest movie ""The Green Inferno"" that was supposed to be out this month in theaters. The trailer to ""House Of The Witchdoctor"" had me hooked! And so I watched it  and I HIGHLY recommend you do to if you want to live the visceral experience of a victim/s of a truly evil and menacing force.

Not for the faint of heart, but then again, if you are you wouldn't be reading this review. If you are reading this customer review however, then follow my advice and get this before it's sold out!

...Anyhow, who couldn't appreciate Bill Moseley and Leslie Easterbrook if you call yourself a TRUE blood and guts horror fan?

Hope you enjoy!

6546407,1,B00M1CFXDO,"First, let me just say the image of the movie is misleading as the main character is not even a victim (Spoiler). Second, the film jumps from genre to genre, going from raping women and murdering them and their lovers to a omen style theme towards the end. I got confused by this, the movie was going well until the last 30 minutes. The acting was as expected (putred, except for Summer Bills). The movie as a whole is not enjoyable unless you like rape/screaming movies.",1417478400,,471,4.488372093023256

6546410,1,B00M1CFXDO,"I really wanted to enjoy this horror film which had potential and has an interesting surprise ending but I was disgusted and offended throughout this mean-spirited crap fest! Basically, a recently released ex-con/coke head/all around sicko and his equally demented friend go on a drug induced crime spree until they end up in the wrong place at the wrong time. Now, I'm a child of the grindhouse film era but I didn't like rape scenes then and don't want to see THREE in a film today. One victim is a religious virgin saving herself for marriage. I find this repulsive. Also, two of the rape scenes go on forever while the creeps call the women every derogatory name you can or can't think of. The first woman gets it the worst and is murdered brutally in front of her black, drug dealer boyfriend. Oh, and the other token black person in the film is a homeless crackhead. The director is a sadist. By the time these two jerks get theirs, it's too little and too late. Bill Moseley and Leslie Easterbrook were never A-listers but this one is below their mediocre standards. A lot of today's horror is wannabe grindhouse crap but this evil turd has helped me make up my mind. I am officially done with indie horror films. Stay away from this trash unless you like this sort of thing. If this is the case, you should probably seek professional help.",1415664000,3,1347,4.5473251028806585

At least, those two guys are insane enough to be in one. Now, to continue might give too much information, but I will say that there are plenty of shockers, disgusting scenes, and a twist. I loved the very last seconds of the movie! Good script, great acting, and a really terrific viewing for horror fans. Be brave, and watch it.",1414800000,5,508,4.532608695652174

6546417,1,B00M1CFXDO,"This movie should be called acting 101......Don't let this happen to you. I do not understand the good reviews on this thing. The acting and sound were so bad I thought I was watching a college production. The story was ok but this was completely ruined by all the amateur bits. This includes the really bad and choppy (bad editing) so called special effects. I would blame the low budget, but I have seen others do more with less. So, overall I would pass on this unless you like torturing yourself. Written poorly too. Another prime example of a bad horror written and directed by one person. Too bad as after all the good reviews on this really thought I would at least be entertained. No such luck!",1414195200,3,702,4.4921875
6546418,1,B00M1CFXDO,So unbelievable and such bad acting that I couldn't bear it any longer and stopped it at 20 minutes in. Something I have never done before. I don't care if I did just pay $3.99 to watch it.,1414022400,2,189,4.0

6546421,2,B00M1CFXDO,"This was somewhat comical  [the acting], and not at all horrific.  I never write reviews, but I am for this one.  Basically I'm bummed that I can't get my money back.  Definitely low (read: ""no"") budget.  Then of course by the time you're halfway into it you have to finish it so you feel like you got some of your money's worth.  The only good part of this flick was the very last scene, and it was subtitled [only the last scene], and subitles drive me crazy.  That's the only reason I didn't give it one star.",1413676800,,512,4.216494845360825

6546423,5,B00M1CFXDO,"Best horror exploitation film in a long time...
No happy endings here just gritty violence, menace, perversion, rape, and some sinister turns and twists to keeps things from getting too predictable. Very violent affair with excellent villains and nice twists and a horror legend. What really makes this film special is the two actors playing the lead villains. They are really believable as two scumbag, drug addict, rapist parolees. I almost felt sorry for the young coeds who had the misfortune of crossing their path.",1413244800,4,520,5.129411764705883
6546424,4,B00M1CFXDO,"If you like an old fashion 80's style home break-in film with an easy foreseeable twist, that appears to have been inspired by an old David Hess movie, this is it.

In our opening scene John (Nick Bastounes) who just got engaged is killed. A year later, his surviving fiancee Leslie (Callie Stephens) invites four friends to her home for a pity party. There is one rule. No going into the basement, as dad, who has been to Haiti does his research work down there. You should be able to see where this is going...

Meanwhile two hooligans, high on crack break into the home and have their way with the girls until...

This is just one of those film whose highlight is the rape and nudity, but has enough of a story to hold our interest so it is not too gratuitous. wink wink nudge nudge. The film develops character, but doesn't create anyone who we care about, which is just as well.

Ilsa (Dyanne Thorne) in a small role. 4 stars for pervs

8669631,5,B00M1CFXDO,"Just meant Allan Kayser tonight, great guy. Extremely friendly. Anyway, he told me about his newest movie so,felt I owed it to him to watch it. Glad I did. Great cult classic! Kayser was great it it. Said he left his all in this movie, hurt himself pretty bad and needed help,getting back to the plane and home. Can really see it in his role too",1500076800,,345,4.242424242424242
8669632,3,B00M1CFXDO,"This starts off as a pretty dreadful Last House on the Left wannabe about two low life's who go on a rape and killing spree.  They start off on a drug dealer and his girlfriend and then turn their attention to a group of friends spending the weekend at an isolated house.  The characters are hard to root for because they are spectacularly stupid and have no survival instincts.  If you are dealing with rapist/murderers and you have the chance to attack them with a knife or a baseball bat or lamp why in God's name wouldn't you finish the scum bags off?  Why give them the opportunity to come after you again?

House of the Witchdoctor never quite seems to have its heart in the rape and torture scenes.  The violence and sex are both pretty tame compared with I Spit On Your Grave (either version) or Last House on the Left (original version).  But the film comes unexpectedly close to redeeming itself with a pretty amusing third act twist that transforms House of the Witchdoctor into a different movie entirely.  (The movie title is a bit of a spoiler, unfortunately).  Bill Moseley more than earns his paycheck when he is finally allowed some screen time.  He brings humor and good-natured hamminess to a movie that desperately needed both.

I can't really recommend House of the Witchdoctor but I will say if you stick with it to the end it gets a whole lot better than the earlier scenes suggest.",1486252800,,1405,4.557768924302789
