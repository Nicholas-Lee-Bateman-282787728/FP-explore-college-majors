8725477,5,B0125Q34FO,"Listening to Verdi's ""Falstaff"" on radio broadcasts and CDs, even following along with a translated libretto, I had never been able to understand why it is always referred to as a masterpiece.  Seeing the opera with subtitles, it became clear.  This opera, more than most, needs to be seen to be enjoyed - at least that is my experience of it.

The performance captured on Blu-Ray is satisfying on every count.  Updating it to mid-20th century didn't harm it for me.  The sets and costumes are excellent.  Since this is the only performance of ""Falstaff"" that I've seen, and cannot recall much from audio-only performances, I have no basis for comparison, but the performers are all thoroughly satisfying.",1501545600,4,705,4.932203389830509
8725478,5,B0125Q34FO,"Usually Verdi's Falstaff isn't much fun. It is made into a gloomy story about aging, living in the past and the futility of human existence, very much in line with Verdis 27 other operas. And the various attempts to modernize the settings fail because of the main character. Fat, drunken, lazy men simply aren't funny any more, rather they are seen as a sign of a failed social system. Today Falstaff would be placed on a job training program, attend AA meetings, and have a gastric bypass.

Carson's production seems to present one of the few viable solutions to this problem. Placing the action in postwar England makes it possible to underline the conflict between a fading noble world of clubs, sherry, cigars, tweed and hunting costumes, represented by Falstaff and an emerging middle class suburbia portrayed by the merry wives in their yellow 1950's General Electric kitchen. The great strength of the production is that the tedious moral superiority of the bourgeois women is eliminated. The constantly tipsy, overeating and sexually bored wives in their floral dresses are just as mercilessly exposed as Falstaff himself. Which for once makes his final statement credible that it is he, who has mede a fool of them. Verdis opera is finally made into the light comedy, it was intended to be with no heroes and no sinners.

The Metropolitan cast is strong with Ambrogio Maestri in his favorite role as the Sir John. Of course he has always had the vocal and physical stature for the role, but the lightheartedness of this production seems to fit him. He himself being a renowned gourmet and hedonist. And Stephanie Blythe as his comical counterpart equals him in vocal strength and acting skills. She doesn't need any cushions to resemble an obese middleclass housewife, a victim of the postwar agricultural revolution with easy acces to cheap empty calories. Paolo Vassallo as Mr. Ford disguises himself as a Texan Tycoon with long greasy hair when he pays Falstaff a visit as signore Fontana.

But still no one dares to throw Maestri anywhere at the end of act two. Apparently he sneaks out and hides, when the basket is dragged past the kitchen zink hidden from the audience's view. Instead we are presented with a giant splash of water several seconds later. According to the Newtonian rules a fall of 50-60 meters. Poor Falstaff!",1487721600,,2341,4.89168765743073

8725482,5,B0125Q34FO,"This is wonderful production of Verdi's great comedy (written when he was nearly 80!),  in which Shakespeare's ""fat knight"" moves from the time of  Henry IV to the England of the 1950s.  Falstaff is one of the great enemble operas, in which a large cast continously interacts with one another, usually with the orchestra skipping along underneath.  The updating works well and makes great sense, as Falstaff is not at a tavern at the start of the opera, but rather living well in a grand hotel, which like Falstaff has seen better days.  Carts full of dirty dishes and spent wine bottles are everywhere, and our Falstaff (Ambrogio Maestri) is in his large bed wearing dirty long johns. while  reading his paper.  The production is dominated by this huge (I read 6 foot 5) Falstaff,  who really takes on the part of this lovable rascal.  All the roles are sung well here, and singers react beautifully to one another.  The sets are gorgeous (including the technicolor 1950s kitchen in which Falstaff is stuffed into a laundry basket before being tossed out a window), and action very well staged.

  This really is a wonderful prodcution of a great opera - the DVD is a treasure (with some great intermission interviews by Renee Fleming, including one with our Falstaff who tells us in Italian how much he loves the role.

Very, very highly recommended!!!",1449187200,12,1354,4.780172413793103
8725483,5,B0125Q34FO,"This superb performance is on a Blu-Ray all region disk.  ( If you could see the back of the box, you could read this in the fine print).  The region warning is often wrong on Amazon.  James Levine and the luxury-cast singers bring out nuances you probably never heard before even in other equally excellent recordings available.",1446508800,7,329,4.7368421052631575
8725484,5,B0125Q34FO,"This is a very special performance of Verdi's last opera for several reasons. First, it is an exceptionally well staged and well sung rendition. Second, it is conducted by the beloved James Levine, albeit from a wheelchair, and finally, the disc is, as is the case with most Blu ray releases, technically stunning.

This Falstaff was an HD simulcast from 13 December 2013, and seems part of an outpouring of Met performances, such as Russalka, Macbeth and La Donna Del Lago, due out in mid November. Long overdue, this burst of releases is certainly good news for opera fans. The opera is atypical Verdi, if such a generalization can be made. It is a true ensemble work, with few arias and no cabalettas. It is an extremely high energy performance, executed to near perfection.

Ambrogio Maestri is the perfect Sir John: his size makes him perfect visually and his voice does the same musically. His dramatic skills are as substantial as his waist measurement, producing a characterization that would be a delight to both Shakespeare and Verdi.

Angela Meade takes a break from early Verdi to take on the role of Alice Ford, and she brings it off seamlessly, as does Stephanie Blythe as Mistress Quickly. Both these ladies are as much in the ""plus size"" area as Maestri, and it fits the characters they play quite well.

With ten principal singers, a lot of stage business is almost inescapable. Fortunately in director Robert Carson, the Met had someone who was not only able to manage the ""group of ten"", but to do an update to the 1950s which does perfect justice to the original Shakespeare works. Frankly, gentle reader, I almost passed this disc by: Falstaff is not my favorite Verdi opera (OK, I LIIKE cabalettas, as well as the melody lines of earlier works) and I am enough of an aficionado of the Bard to view tinkering with a jaundiced eye.

However, I am glad that I yielded to the temptation occasioned by a nice low price from a UK vendor to get this disc, because it was enjoyed here last night, with ""She Who Must Be Obeyed"" asking for a repeat showing soon

I would be remiss if I did not make special mention of the conducting of an obviously frail James Levine from a wheelchair. Being disabled myself, I have great respect for the Maestro for persevering in the face of poor health to bring us yet another beautifully executed and realized operatic performance. His many talents have been a driving force at the Met for decades, and he will be greatly missed when his final curtain comes down.

One last note on the disc. As with several new and forthcoming releases, Amazon has mislabelled them as ""Region B/2, playable only on European players. In reality, the back of these boxes and the labels on the discs themselves makes it clear that they are ""Region 0"", this playable anywhere. Amazon UK also does this but competitors like Presto Classical make it abundantly clear that they are all area releases.

This is a wonderfully entertaining release, and not to be missed!",1445299200,13,2994,4.700381679389313
