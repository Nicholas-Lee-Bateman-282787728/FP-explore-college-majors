8142742,5,B000I0QLK0,"This sitcom is quite corny, But in a cute way. Ann Baker and the rest of the cast have good comic timing, and the production values are good. In fact, It's quite a time capsule of the 50's. If you like other 50's sitcoms like ""I Married Joan"" and ""Ozzie and Harriet"", then you may enjoy this show. Now, When will Alpha Video release volume 4?",1170979200,3,342,4.196969696969697
