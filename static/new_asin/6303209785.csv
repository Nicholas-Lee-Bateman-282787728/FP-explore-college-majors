603321,3,6303209785,"This was a really great concert. I have watched it several times. Bryan Adams is one of my favorites.

When I bought this it said it was for the USA region, when I got the DVD it said it was region free. The DVD won't play in a DVD players though, says it is the wrong region. I can only watch it on my computer.",1285200000,2,312,3.8

603323,5,6303209785,"Bryan Adams really ROCKS and this DVD presents both his music AND live performance.  It doesn't get any better unless one could be there in person.  Although, IMO, his best CD of all time is still ""So Far, So Good"".",1269907200,4,215,4.35
603324,5,6303209785,"Not better, not worse, just different. Unfortunately, many American travelers fail to appreciate the difference and either omit Portugal from their travel itineraries or simply add on a day in Lisbon to a longer trip to Spain. It deserves more attention.
This video does a fine job of presenting Lisbon's many attractions, so much so that the viewer who has not visited that lovely city will be tempted to visit it as soon as possible. Utilizing the standard Super Cities combination of aerial views combined with street-level photography, it provides a fine overview of the structure of the city, interwoven with visits to specific attractions. Watch it with pen and paper in hand, so that you can write down the specific attractions that interest you most. Highly recommended.",969580800,2,778,5.0859375
7841481,4,6303209785,Love this DVD it is from his room service tour that I didn't get a CD at so this is even better than that the quality of the film is not as good as his other DVDs but I can live with that,1517529600,,187,3.372093023255814

7841488,3,6303209785,"This is a re-issue [or stand-alone] release of the live In Lisbon bonus DVD that was part of some Anthology 2CD packages. The difference is an extra live track, a few music videos and a photo gallery.

Warning: This may be in PAL format.",1372118400,2,237,4.386363636363637
7841489,1,6303209785,"Did not play on any of my 3 DVD players, and have contacted seller, so we'll see what they come back with. I did read other reviews before I ordered this DVD that this ""not playing"" was an issue. But, I took a chance on this DVD and lost!",1324512000,3,238,3.877551020408163
7841490,5,6303209785,"Unfortunatly I was not in Lisbon for the concert myself, but the DVD is absolutly phantastic, a must have for every Bryan Adams fan on the planet. My absolute favorites on the DVD are ""Back to You"", ""Summer of 69"", ""Cuts like a Knife"", ""Heaven"" and ""Run to You"". What such a concert needs though is fans like in Lisbon who really go with it.",1313798400,,341,4.2615384615384615
