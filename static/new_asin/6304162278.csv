7866120,5,6304162278,Wish this was on dvd!,1455494400,,21,3.4

Huge scam! Do not buy from this person. I have a feeling they are sending out blank tapes.",1450224000,,156,4.064516129032258
7866122,5,6304162278,I enjoy this movie because of all the ways this boy tries to get new toys(One being to write Santa a list of wants)and the only way his heart was turned was to find that his name was also the name of a town. I find it cute to see a kid who craved for toys to find it better that he didn't need toys after all.,1418256000,,309,3.626865671641791

7866124,4,6304162278,"Wish this came in DVD format but until then I will just keep watching the video each year!  Love the narrator, love the rhyme and love the message!",1214092800,,147,4.25
7866125,4,6304162278,"This special was on TV and I watched it, and it was better than I expected! The character (Jeremy) is a selfish spoiled little boy (hmmm remind you of any kids you know today?!) who only thinks about himself and the next toy he can get. Its perfect to watch with any kids who are a little too focused on the gift aspect of christmas, or even if you yourself feel like you just want everything for christmas. Its also narrated by someone famous (Im forget who, maybe Dick Van Dyke...) Its funny and the goes at a fairly fast pace (for kids with short attention spans) I would love it if the Cartoon Network would release this and some other Xmas Specials on DVD.",1037059200,4,661,4.296
