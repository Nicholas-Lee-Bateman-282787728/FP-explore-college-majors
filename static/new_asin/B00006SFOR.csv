8603253,5,B00006SFOR,"This is a great workout, this video is a complilation of all the great workouts put into one 40 minute workout. For several years now I have been taking my favorite videos and putting them together this way,so now I no longer need to stop my workout to pop in another tape, and now Billy made it easy for me. This is a great workout and you are always busy, never a minute to get bored. Not that any of the Tae Bo workouts are boring. I highly recommend and would love to see more workouts like this.",1043280000,16,500,4.112244897959184
