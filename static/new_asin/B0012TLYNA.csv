This particular Ghostwriter mystery introduced kids to modems, dial-up bulletin board systems (BBS), and the cyberpunk/hacker culture.  After watching these episodes I discovered that our computer had a 2400 bps internal modem and terminal software!  Then I found the local computer store ran a BBS... and so the journey began.  This was a time when NONE of my friends had a computer, and most kids were still using typewriters for  homework!  Later in 1994 the first Internet service providers started popping up in our area, and in 1995 the movie Hackers came out.  What a time, those days were amazing.
