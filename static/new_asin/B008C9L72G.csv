8709827,5,B008C9L72G,"The set of 5 VHS tapes was factory sealed, brand new.  I had hoped to get the entire 10 VHS tapes as was described in the product summary complete with pictures of the 10 VHS tape set..  (I had to double check the product details to see it was only the first five of the ten VHS tape set.)  I was getting the set to convert to DVD for my mother-in-law whose VCR does not play VHS tapes any more.  Tapes 6 and 10 (of the second set of 5) had been overwritten with cartoons from Nickelodian and Disney, so I sought everywhere to find replacements.  Note:  When you get factory VHS tapes, BREAK the protective record tab on the left of the cassette to prevent overwriting.  Does ANYONE know where I can find the SECOND set, tapes 6 through 10?  Thank you again for this speedy delivery.",1518220800,,783,4.243243243243243
