807539,5,6304203756,Excellent.  Season twos quality is much better than Season 1.  The picture and sounds have been significantly improved.  The Rifleman has always been my favoritie western from this area mainly because of the cast and the simple yet effective scripts.  Highly recommended.,1459036800,2,271,5.380952380952381

807544,3,6304203756,"The ""Product Details"" section curiously does not mention how many episodes per DVD. Call me crazy, but I like to know what I am getting when I make a purchase, including the names of the episodes.

I had to research other sites to figure out not only which episodes are listed, but how many.

Here is what I determined, for those still trying to figure it out:
A ""volume"" is one DVD with 5 episodes, usually from the same season, but not always.
A ""boxed set"" is made of 4 volumes, for a total of 20 episodes.

Episode lists by volume may be found on some other Rifleman websites.

There are 6 boxed sets currently in release, for a total of 120 episodes available for purchase. There are 48 episodes not currently released.

Also, I cannot believe that none of the other reviewers address the incredibly steep price! At $500 for a new set which includes only 20 episodes, that's $25 per episode! I love the show, but I can't justify that price...

For the producers of the DVD, it is absolutely ridiculous not to release the DVDs in broadcast order.",1337731200,,1050,4.471204188481676
807545,5,6304203756,"The Rifleman,in my opinion,was the best western tv series of the 50's and 60's. One of these day's I plan to purchase the entire series from Amazon. I have looked else where and have not found this series for less,even ebay. So thank you Amazon for putting me in touch with the past.

  Sincerely,

807546,3,6304203756,"The Rifleman Volume 2 contains five more episodes of the popular series, but the overall quality of the episodes is not as good as the Volume 1 collection.  If not for the presence of a couple of really nasty villains, and some hilarious outtakes, you could probably pass on this disc.  Here's a rundown of the episodes with my ratings from one to five.
The Angry Gun (5):  Vic Morrow stars as an escaped outlaw, who has stolen both Lucas McCain's money, and his precious Winchester.  Morrow is marvelous, exuding pure evil, and showing little feeling for either friend or foe.  He is about to finish off the Rifleman with his own gun, when Lucas's just in the nick of time ingenuity saves the day.
The Sheridan Story (2):  This one is aimed at the heart.  A disabled Confederate veteran turns up at the McCain ranch.  Later, General Sheridan, the man who wounded him also arrives at the McCain's.  Both men confront their past deeds, reflect on the tragedy of war, and then even begin to try to heal old wounds.  This one's short on action and long on words.
The Money Gun (2):  Jackford is a man with a lot of enemies.  One of them brings hired gun, Tom King (John Dehner) into town to kill Jackford.  King and McCain are old acquaintances who don't like each other.  Lucas and Micah must do what is necessary to keep the peace.  Too much posturing, and not much tension in this one.  The ending is weak.  Not one of Peckinpah's better efforts.
The Mind Reader (2):  A man is shot in the back on the streets of South Fork, and a young Michael Landon is held for the crime.  Lucas tries to find out who really did the deed.  John Carradine is a travelling mind reader who seems to know something about who committed the crime.  Though the identity of the real killer is a surprise, the episode really doesn't deliver much of a punch.
Bloodlines (4):  Three brothers take things a little too far in the town saloon, and one brother ends up dead when Lucas and Micah intervene.  Funnyman Buddy Hackett guest stars as Daniel Malakie, the father of the boys.  And Pa is in a mean and nasty mood.  First it's a jailbreak and then cold-blooded murder, as the Malakie's go on a rampage of revenge.  This one has plenty of action, with the scruffy Hackett even getting a much-needed bath.
Volume 2 has bonus features, the most notable is a four minute long clip of outtakes that gives you a real taste of what the set was probably like.  Very funny, with music track, and lots and lots of profanity.  The Rifleman set was probably one big ""boys club"", with too many guys cooped up together, for too long.  So we get Chuck Connors joking about kissing other men, and swearing up a storm.  Great fun, but definitely not for the kids.
I've said before, this is mainly for the guys.  Once again, almost no women are featured in these episodes.  Only one actress even has any lines!  Get this one only if you're a hardcore fan, otherwise wait for Volumes 3 and 4.",1008547200,13,2951,4.435754189944134

Because it is the best, I wish that they have cleaned it more completely from little white and black ""dust.""  From time to time there were some frames that had long white lines.

807742,5,6304203756,I loved watching these as a little girl with my dad. There is usually a valuable lesson in morals or integrity from Lucas McCain to his son Mark. It is refreshing.  The quality of the dvd's are nice. There is an easy option for subtitles for the hard of hearing.  They came very quickly and well protected.  Each of the seasons are divided into two volumes.  Starting with season 1 volume 1. I believe there are 20 episodes with each volume.,1462320000,4,441,4.407407407407407

A timeless, memorable show, I thought Chuck Connors and Johnny Crawford were simply superb, believable and perfect in playing their roles -- the chemistry was just there, period.  .  I like the quality and look forward to future releases (I believe another release is coming in May, if I'm not mistaken).  I would recommend purchasing this.",1461196800,5,468,4.961538461538462
