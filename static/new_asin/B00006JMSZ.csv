1781328,5,B00006JMSZ,"This is a superb collection of films by that great master of the dance; Gene Kelly. Words can't express how enjoyable these three musicals are! The documentary is a tasteful, insightful, entertaining, and informative study of the man and his career. Don't underestimate the power of a quintessential performer in a classic musical. What a glorious combination!",1053561600,18,360,5.333333333333333
1781329,5,B00006JMSZ,"Received this item on time, and although I purchased this DVD box set, used, it looked brand new. Thank you!",1325894400,,108,4.45
1781330,4,B00006JMSZ,"I bought it for a gift. It was perfect. FYI, only 2 movies have spanish subtitles (Singin'.. & American..) the other 2 have only english and french subtitles.",1288656000,,158,4.678571428571429
1781331,5,B00006JMSZ,"They simply don't, or can't, make them like this anymore. The DVD quality is great and much clearer than the old tapes.
Amazon's price was right and I like their practice of showing other sellers and their prices.
Very happy with this purchase.",1259539200,,244,4.6976744186046515
1781332,5,B00006JMSZ,"I bought this set for my sister's birthday, and she screamed when she opened it. She has been a big fan of Gene Kelly and loved all the titles this set includes. This collection contains 'Singin' in the Rain', 'An American in Paris', 'On the Town' and 'Anatiomy of a Dancer'. I am not a fan of musicals, but if you are, this is a set for you. My sister has watched all of these movies at least three times each already, and still loves them like she's never seen them before. Her whole family has grown to love Gene Kelly. She said she highly recommends this to all musical movie lovers!",1254873600,,587,4.25
1781333,5,B00006JMSZ,"Whether you love Gene Kelly or not....these are a must have.  My husband, who typically only watches sports, decided to watch one of the movies with me and really enjoyed it.  The following week, he watched a 2nd one with me.  Simple stories, great music and awesome dancing.....you can't go wrong.",1250553600,,298,4.803921568627451
1781334,5,B00006JMSZ,"I bought this as a Mother's Day gift for my mom.  She's a big fan of Gene Kelly and had needed a new Singin' In the Rain.  I saw this though, and since it was on sale decided to get her the set.  She absolutely loved it and started to cry when she opened it. :)  She almost immediately started watching all of them and really loves it.  I saw the packaging before I shipped it to her, and it arrived in good condition and looked to be good quality.",1243123200,,448,3.933333333333333
1781335,5,B00006JMSZ,This is a great collection of Gene Kelly's best loved movies. Great value for the product you receive.,1241395200,,102,4.722222222222222
1781336,5,B00006JMSZ,What more needs to be said than its Gene Kelly dancing.  That pretty much says it all.,1240790400,,86,4.0588235294117645
1781337,4,B00006JMSZ,I thought that this collection was fairly decent.  I admit the only reason that I bought it was to get singin' in the Rain a movie which I really enjoy.  American in Paris was ok and I have only watched part of On the Town.  I would say if you like Gene Kelly's movies you will probably enjoy them somewhat but except for Singin' in the rain I was not blown away.,1240099200,,363,4.013888888888889
1781338,5,B00006JMSZ,I love each and every one of these! Wonderful showcases of Gene Kelly's talent! It's just a shame that they aren't widescreen.,1235520000,,126,4.7727272727272725
1781339,5,B00006JMSZ,"This is the first set or actually any movie from Gene Kelly I have ever seen and what surprised me was how enjoyable it was.  The biggest reason I guess I like this set so much is the fact I say to myself that ""they don't make them like that anymore"" when I watch them.  Even though they are older films they are still very enjoyable and found myself liking the way the films were shot and I would have to say my favorite is between On the Town and Singin in the rain.  I know a lot of people love these films and I really didn't get them for me but for my kids for Christmas.  Though they are young kids I hope they will enjoy watching them as well and I have a good feeling they will.  My almost two year old daughter was watching it with me the other day and as she watched them dance I could see her little toes in her sleeper moving back and forth.  My almost four year old already gets a kick out of seeing people dancing in movies.  They don't really care much for the story but that's o.k. considering their ages but if they are like their mom they will enjoy musicals.  Overall though I really don't like musicals that much but I am very happy with this purchase of these classic Gene Kelly flicks.",1232841600,2,1207,4.084745762711864
1781340,5,B00006JMSZ,"I really enjoy this collection. Not only does it have some really great movies, but it also has a documentary on Gene Kelly, and and extra dvd with Singing in the Rain. It is a very good value for what you get.",1231200000,,210,4.023809523809524
1781341,5,B00006JMSZ,"What can you say about these three films? Every one is a classic, and ""Singing in the Rain"" is probably on a lot of ""Ten Greatest Ever"" lists. A lot of collections give you a masterpiece along with several minor works. This one should be in everybody's library. The documentary ""Anatomy of a Dancer"" recounts Gene Kelly's career, but of course most of the highlights are already on the other three DVD's.",1229904000,,404,4.625
1781342,4,B00006JMSZ,"I really enjoy Gene Kelly. These are among my favorite movies that he has been in. A joy to watch. His enthusiasm, his dancing, his singing. These movies raise your spirits. I highly recommend this collection.",1222905600,,209,4.833333333333333
1781343,5,B00006JMSZ,"This item has all of the movies that prove Gene Kelly's ability to dance and sing. A quadro of fun with On the Town, An American in Paris, Snigin in the Rain, and an Anatomy of dancer will keep you entertained and smiling for weeks. Each DVD has a quality picture and sound.",1221782400,2,274,4.188679245283019
1781344,5,B00006JMSZ,If you like Gene Kelly you will like this collection. I bought it for my daughter who is a big fan of his and she loved it.,1217376000,,123,3.5925925925925926
1781345,5,B00006JMSZ,"As a fan of music, dance and cinema from the 40s and 50s, I loved this collection. If you like musicals, this is a great collection of classics.",1211155200,2,144,4.178571428571429
1781346,5,B00006JMSZ,Singin' in the Rain is the excellent 2002 transfer. Bonus materials include a fine full-length documentary on MGM's Freed Unit; this is a must-see for all musical fans. For my money though the keepers here are the extensive clips of original film appearances of all these great songs. All pale in comparison to the SITR versions (though Andy Rooney and Judy Garland do an energetic version of Good Mornin') but offer a nice overview of film-musical history.,1207958400,2,457,4.9480519480519485
1781347,5,B00006JMSZ,The Gene Kelly collection is timelessly entertaining and it was a wonderful experience to watch these movies again.,1203724800,,115,5.444444444444445
1781348,5,B00006JMSZ,"A great addition to collection of dance DVDs for dance enthusiasts, dancers and dance historians.",1200182400,,97,5.533333333333333
1781349,5,B00006JMSZ,I purchased the set for my 14 year old daughter.  I contains our 3 favorite movies plus a biography about Gene Kelly.  It's a must see for anyone who loves dance!,1200096000,,162,4.193548387096774
1781350,5,B00006JMSZ,This is a wonderful collection of Gene Kelly's work. The only thing missing is Cover Girl and Brigadoon.,1198368000,,104,4.833333333333333
1781351,5,B00006JMSZ,"This is a great deal.  4 movies for way less than it would be to buy each individually.  That and each movie is a hit.  I love the ""Anatomy of a Dancer"" DVD.  I've watched it twice and would watch it more.",1193961600,,205,3.8095238095238093
1781352,5,B00006JMSZ,This product was exactly as advertised and in wonderful condition when received. Fast shipping!  Excellent seller.,1193788800,,114,6.125

1781355,5,B00006JMSZ,"For all Gene Kelly lovers, this is a great collection to watch and own.  He is one of the two masters of the dance/musical genre (Fred Astaire being the other).  The dance sequence in ""Singing in the Rain"" gives me goosebumps everytime I watch it.  They don't make 'em like that anymore.  Also the documentary On the Town/Anatomy of a Dancer was very interesting.  Enjoyed it thoroughly.",1169078400,5,387,4.7164179104477615
1781356,4,B00006JMSZ,"I grew up with Gene Kelly performances and so this box set is wonderful.  ""Singin' on the Rain"" is one of his classics, as well as one of his best performances.  ""On the Town"" and ""An American in Paris"" are suberb too, highlighting Kelly's different strengths.  I especially liked ""Anatomy of a Dancer"" though because it shed light on Kelly's life that I did not know. As such I grew to respect him and his work even more. I highly recommend it for Gene Kelly followers and musical lovers alike!",1152835200,6,495,4.477777777777778
1781357,3,B00006JMSZ,"The sound track for ""On The Town"" didn't work at all.  The sound track for the other two was very uneven.  Too loud, then too soft.  Apparently it was still at theater levels. That should be easily repaired.

  These wonderful movies are worth a re-do.",1127347200,20,252,4.488888888888889
