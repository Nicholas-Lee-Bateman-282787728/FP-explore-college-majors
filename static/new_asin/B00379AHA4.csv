8390401,3,B00379AHA4,"It is a good show I used to watch it on Disney channel before it stopped playing. I like it. The quality isn't very good when they are moving around. It can be fuzzy at times. But it isn't watchable. Just move back some and it should look better. I think If there are any more episodes they should make more, just better.",1334534400,2,321,4.111111111111111
8390402,1,B00379AHA4,When i got this dvd Naturally Sadie show some of the color quality was bad and the screen was a little messed up and really bad when i got it. the quality was so poor and the features sucked. this product was not very good and was made so bad. I wasted money and i think this seller grabs money from people and sells bad products along with a few other sellers. I like honest people who sell and who don't try to rip people off with money and sell bad products.,1293667200,3,461,4.021739130434782
