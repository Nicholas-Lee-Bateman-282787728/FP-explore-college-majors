8156175,5,B00005QW50,"I had this trilogy many years ago and it is good to have it again. The Street Fighter was way ahead of it's time as far as special effects go and it's mainly non-stop action laced with an intricate story line. This series is by far one of best martial arts movies that one can find. It's a little dated, as it was filmed in the 60's, but nevertheless a must for anyone who enjoys the martial arts genre. I rate Sonny Chiba's preformance right up there with Bruce Lee in this set. Sonny Chiba later had an accident that injured his spine and he couldn't move the way he does in the Street Fighter, so your seeing a true martial artist in his prime, dominating the screen in one of the best movie series in martial arts. A must buy.",1294531200,,730,4.184397163120567
8156176,5,B00005QW50,"The street fighter is a martial arts classic, as well of the two sequels included here. In one disc, you can choose all three movies plus some extras, the quality is very acceptable for these widescreen english dubbed versions, no greater defects on picture and sound quality and of course the greatest opportunity to kill three birds in one shot.

The street fighter greatest achievement is showing the damage inflicted by terry's fists, the cruelty of his fighting techniques upon the opponents bodies. The story is not the best you had seen, mediocre i say, but terry made legend in martial arts world. You wanna know why? just watch him in action.

Highly recomended for fans and curious first timers.",1158451200,2,705,4.866666666666666
