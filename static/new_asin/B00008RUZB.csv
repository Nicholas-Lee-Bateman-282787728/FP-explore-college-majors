1860726,1,B00008RUZB,"I am a very big fan of Denise Austin and was highly disappointed with this video. I thought it would round out my yoga/pilates workouts. Right. The only thing I'm more upset about is the fact that I can't get my money back.

And yes, the woman looks absolutely possessed in the video.",1125187200,3,284,4.3584905660377355
1860727,2,B00008RUZB,"As other reviewers stated this was extremely slow paced.  It was rather monotoned and boring.  It seems more of stretching video than helping to tone, firm the buns.  I'm a beginner to yoga and felt as if I'd not even worked out but rather took a stretching break.  It appeared this is more for strengthing and flexibility.",1120608000,6,323,4.614035087719298
1860728,2,B00008RUZB,"If you're looking for an instructional yoga session, focusing on the lower body, this is not it. If I had to hear one more ditzy phrase about my buns (""C'mon! Tight tushies here!""), I would have...well, you get the idea. Denise Austin teaching yoga is just too weird and I couldn't take her seriously. She never mentions how to breath properly (essential to yoga), let alone when. If you're a regular yoga practioner, be advised that all of these moves are found in your regular practice.

Basically, I really disliked this dvd. However, I gave it 2 stars because if you're into aerobics and pilates, you'd probably really like it and get a good workout.

 Someone mentioned that they didn't like the ""new age way"" that yoga was presented. News flash: Yoga is a spiritual practice that also involves the body. It's not an American workout that sometimes goes with meditation.",1106611200,7,875,4.781456953642384
1860729,5,B00008RUZB,I absolutely love this video. It really works. You feel results the first time you do it and the second time you actually see the results!  This is not a traditional yoga video- however some traditional yoga poses are done. I think my favorite part about this video is that not only the glutes get a thorough uplifting workout-but almost every exercise in this tape works the abs as well! Not to mention stretches you out completely. I can't say enough good things about it.,1069977600,11,474,4.576470588235294
1860730,4,B00008RUZB,I may be biased because I like yoga moves but I really don't like all the meditating and new age spiritual ways that is can be presented.  This tape doesn't do that.  Yoga is really just saying that the workout involves some yoga moves.  It totally can help your fannie area but it is up to the viewer to tighten and use that area.  If you are able to concentrate your efforts I think it is a worthwhile tape.  Thanks!,1045526400,,418,4.175
1860791,4,B00008RUZB,"As many have stated this is not a traditional yoga dvd, and is absent of any instruction. I highly recommend this product, though not as a core workout for your exercise regimen. Many people disregard stretching, but it is a very vital part of a good workout: it tones, even if you don't feel a burn, and it helps your muscles to be more flexible and discourages cramping. If you do keep your bum muscles clamped, the burn and the results are near immediate. Toning is also provided for the upper-body, abs, and especially the thighs. I become easily bored with workouts, and have to change things up to keep myself interested, and this product is a nice change to most typical pilates and yoga lower body workouts. A wonderful supplemental workout.",1201996800,3,749,4.681818181818182
1860792,4,B00008RUZB,"I really like the DVD but it skips and pauses through out the DVD.  Can I replace this, it was supposed to be new.  I don't have my receipt.

Thanks",1187827200,,148,3.8666666666666667
1860793,5,B00008RUZB,"If you like Denise's Power Yoga and Fat-Blasting Yoga dvds, you will also enjoy this one. Denise tweaks traditional yoga moves to put emphasis on the butt muscles. If you are tenacious in squeezing your buns while doing the poses, you will definitely feel the burn in your behind. Your shoulders and chest will also get a great workout. This dvd is exactly why I rely on Denise for my workouts: it is a no-nonsense, effective challenge that strengthens and stretches the whole body. Finish up with a pilates workout from another Denise dvd and you've targeted the whole body in less than 45 minutes! I find aerobic and weight workouts quite boring, so I am hoping for more yoga and pilates dvds from Denise in the near future.",1173916800,4,726,4.635658914728682
1860794,5,B00008RUZB,I bought this tape about 9 months ago. I had been doing Yoga and Pilates for about 2 years using Denise Austin videos and dvds.  This summer I joined a national gym and did Yoga and Pilates several times a week. Her tapes prepared me well for my hour long Yoga and Pilates clases.  I discontinued my gym membership 6 months later due to cost and feel very confident that I will continue my level of exercise using her tapes and DVDs. This tape has many of the Yoga exercises that we were doing in class. I do not feel this tape is best used by a person new to Yoga due to the pace. This tape is only 30 minutes long so the pace is pretty fast. I feel this tape is better used by someone who has been Yoga for a period of time. Good tape and good exercises.,1168041600,,756,4.0
1860795,3,B00008RUZB,"I really love Denise Austin, so I decided to give this one a try!

I have never done yoga, but this workout seems to move way too fast to be conisdered yoga.  Some of the poses are held literally for a few seconds.  Considerable flexibility and balance are required.  The cueing is not well done, leaving me rushing to catch up.  I found that the two girls working out with Denise looked much more natural in the yoga poses than Denise herself.

I will probably keep doing this workout from time to time, just to add some variety to my workouts.  It should help me improve my balance.  Will it strengthen and lengthen my lower body?  Only time will tell!",1167350400,,654,4.383333333333334
1860796,4,B00008RUZB,"It is true as other reviewers have mentioned that Denise fails in this video to maintaine the orthodox meditative nature of purist yoga in this video.  She is very perky, talks a lot, and looks a little crazy.  But...I love this video!  Why?  Because it provided me with a motivator to get back into exercising.  I have taken serious yoga classes before, and actually found myself a little turned off by the emphasis on breathing and meditation (I tended to fall asleep or not notice when we were transferring to another position) so for me Denise's chatter helps to keep me on track (and I have never experienced any success in any form with the breathing emphasis of orthodox yoga--I figure I'll let my body decide when and how fast to breathe).

The two criticisms I do have for this video are that Denise tends to work one side of the body longer than the other side (I think she just gets a little distracted).  My solution is to alternate which side I start with every other workout.  The only other criticism is that after having done this workout every morning and evening for two months I find that my muscles have ceased to feel the burn.  Is that Denise's fault?  No, it just means that it is time for me to move up into a more intense video (I am 24 years by the way, in case you were wondering).

My ultimate praise for this video...it provides some excellent stretching and strengthening which not only burns fat (I have lost 10 lbs. since starting two months ago), but provides the relaxation muscles and joints need to prevent injuries caused in more intense workouts and just in everyday life.  I will continue to make this video part of my routine because of the stretching benefits.  By the way, if you have bad knees (I do) this workout will challenge them, but if you respect your knees' limits (ie. if it hurts back off until it's just mildly uncomfortable, and gradually do more as time goes along), you will find that several of the exercises in this video will strengthen your knees and help relieve daily knee pain.

Happy Exercising Everyone.",1140998400,19,2069,4.556756756756757
1860797,5,B00008RUZB,"I never would have purchased this DVD if I had read the other reviews, so I am glad I didn't because this workout kicked my butt!

Contrary to what some of the other reviewers say, there is a LOT of yoga in this DVD.  It is NOT a traditional yoga video, true...and there is NO yoga instruction.  If you have never done yoga before, make sure to get an instructional video FIRST or you will not be able to follow along.  You might also consider getting one by Denise Austin (who I agree can be very annoying) because some of the names she uses for the poses are not consistant with traditional yoga you'll find on typical yoga videos.

Again, contrary to some other reviewers, I found that it worked my lower body considerably.  Sure... not as much as machines at the gym, but for a yoga tape ... YES!  I could see how someone who didn't put forth much effort might think that it doesn't, but if you keep your butt contracted throughout (and she reminds you on a regular basis) you WILL feel the burn.  You might not want to use this DVD as your sole workout, but it is definitely one I will use as an integral part of my overall weekly routine.

Finally, Denise Austin has some weird quirks that some other reviewers have noted.  Her eyes DO look possessed! And she has this bizarre way of talking that can be quite annoying.  However, I liked the workout SO much that I was able to look beyond her weirdness and get the most out of this DVD.

I gave this DVD 5 stars despite some of the negative things I have stated because I think a lot of the lower star reviews were grossly unfair.  I'm glad for the impulse purchase I made at the store.  I'll be using this several times a week as part of my overall exercise program.",1134432000,20,1723,4.2615384615384615
1860798,3,B00008RUZB,"Now, I'm not really bothered that this DVD isn't traditional Yoga; especially since I was a big fan of Denise's other Yoga DVD, 'Fat Blasting Yoga', but most of the workout on this DVD is a carbon copy from Fat Blasting Yoga, so I can't help but feel a bit cheated.

Also, I'm not totally convinced that this workout targets the lower body as it claims to.  It does a good job of stretching out the body, though intense lower body blast?  Hmmmm, I don't think so.

So if its not Yoga, and its not a lower body toning workout... then what is it?

What I reckon would be an accurate description of this DVD is an all-over stretching workout, with an infusion of pilates, ballet and mild (thats MILD, don't expect Billy Blanks here) cardio.  I have found that it does get the heart rate up, but I wouldn't recommend it as a sole source of cardio.  Call it a 'Jack of All Trades' workout, it does a bit of everything, but nothing is a speciality.

All in all, I think this workout is good... but not for the reasons that its advertised for.  For those of you that complain about Denise Austin's personality, then for goodness sake, DON'T buy her DVDs!  She will not transform her personality for the production of any single DVD, and there is no exception in this DVD.  She is her usual bright, bubbly self (though some of you will say hyper, annoying, ditzy, etc etc) - and this doesn't bother me, since I am able to look past the instructor and do a workout based on its merits (if you REALLY can't stand her voice but like her workouts, put the darn TV on mute!).

I'm glad I got this DVD, and will make great use of it, since even though I don't think it does what its advertised to do, there are benefits from the workout that I'll gladly receive regardless.  I'm not bothered that its not meditive, not well instructed, and not really Yoga.  If it makes me stop spending time writing reviews on Amazon to get up and exercise, its gotta be good for me in some way!",1131408000,25,1965,4.304347826086956
1860799,4,B00008RUZB,"I think many of the other reviews here are unfairly harsh. This is not pure yoga, but a mixture of yoga with pilates, ballet, and strength-training moves. It is not a ""killer"" workout; if you're looking to REALLY fry your butt, try one of The Firm's more sculpting-oriented videos. If you're looking for pure traditional yoga, this isn't for you.

I'm not sure that Yoga Buns quite rates a full 4 stars; maybe 3 and a half or three-quarters. This is a good video for someone with a bit of yoga experience rather than a pure beginner, who will need more detailed instructions. Denise IS rather wacky and over the top, but her style is within the motivational fitness instructor mode. This suits some people, but may annoy those looking for something more mellow and soothing.

I find this to be an invigorating workout that gets my heart rate up a bit and clears my head. I can feel the work in my legs, but I wouldn't (as an in advanced exercizer in strength-training) use it as my primary lower body workout. Those with bad wrists like me may want to avoid or modify some of the floor poses towards the end of the routine. Overall, this is a good workout for fitness-oriented exercizers at the advanced beginner to intermediate level with some yoga background, who'd like a bit of toning and mild cardio with their yoga.",1126569600,6,1321,4.569620253164557
7986682,5,B00008RUZB,Good Workout.,1470700800,,13,6.0
7986683,5,B00008RUZB,"This is one of my favorite at home Denise Austin workout videos. I have owned it since Denise was still showing on Lifetime (we need her back by the way). After just 3 days (skipping a day in between to rest), I always see results. This is the video I pop in when I want to start working out again, but I want to ease into it. Plus my hips and thighs are normally the areas that cause me to want to start working out again so this video is perfect.

I love Denise. Watching her on ESPN years ago helped me drop a ton of weight and kept it off for years. She is the one I turn to when I start to notice a chunk or two. Her positive energy keeps me focused.",1459641600,,655,3.8518518518518516
7986684,5,B00008RUZB,Feels So Good! Great workout and yet it's actually enjoyable! Makes me move in ways I usually don't!,1448668800,,100,4.611111111111111
7986685,5,B00008RUZB,this is a great dvd for lower body workout. good for balance exercises,1430006400,,70,4.461538461538462
7986686,5,B00008RUZB,Purchased for a Birthday gift.  My daughters love it. All Denise Austin's exercise DVD's are great and we all enjoy them.,1404086400,,121,4.761904761904762
7986687,5,B00008RUZB,I absolutely love Denise Austin! I have been doing lots of yoga lately and was looking for something more challenging and let me tell u this is it! It kicks buns! :),1344297600,,165,4.1875

7986689,5,B00008RUZB,"I felt that Denise Austin's Yoga for Buns DVD was fantastic. I was familiar with most yoga moves before trying this DVD, but if you are just starting out, you should always begin with a Yoga for Beginners DVD and not one that is focused on a particular body part.

Nonetheless, this is a great buy!",1241827200,,298,4.321428571428571
7986690,3,B00008RUZB,"I'm not sure the what level this DVD is classified as, but it's definitely not for a yoga beginner.  I have taken a few yoga classes, so I know a little bit, but the video lacked any instruction on the poses and proper form.  I've never done a Denise Austin video before, and I think this will be my last.  While I can appreciate a motivating instructor, she wouldn't stop talking!  So, as for the exercise itself, it was only okay.  The poses weren't held for very long, and because of the frequent changes I don't feel like it was really yoga . . . or a bun workout.  While I found her to be upbeat and supportive and the video instruction mediocre, I found her constant talking to be too distracting and stopped half way through.",1225670400,,732,4.306569343065694
