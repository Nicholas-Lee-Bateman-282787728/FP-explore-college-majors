8272073,5,B001957A30,"According to Cagepotato, due to the massive amounts of main event and undercard changes on this card, UFC 85 is the most cursed MMA event ever. However, the UFC delivers a smashing card for the British fans. There were a few controversial fights (Leites/Marquardt, Werdum/Vera). The total count of fight endings is: 6 KO/TKO, 2 SUB, and 3 decisions. The decisions are good, down-to-the-wire fights, almost like what you'd see at a WEC event. The card is well worth the money even with the absence of any championship bouts.",1281571200,,523,4.887640449438202

8272075,5,B001957A30,"UFC 85 was originally supposed to have Shogun vs Liddell as the main event, but Shogun had to pull out due to knee surgery. Rashad Evans went on to replace Shogun but Liddell later torn his hamstring and was replaced with James Irvin. Well what do you know, James Irvin ended up having to drop out due to injury and, well, the main event was totally trashed.

So leave it up to the 2 guys that took over the main event in such short time, former welterweight champ Matt Hughes and contender Thiago Alves to fill in! Whatever respect I didn't have for Alves before this fight I had after, win lose or draw. After coming off a very bad loss to GSP at UFC 79, Hughes was questioning his career knowing he still wanted to fight Matt Serra. When he took on Alves at this event, MMA fans watched closely to see a once again dominant Matt Hughes. Well, it was a letdown to say the least, but the winner was remarkable in victory and hopefully gets a title shot soon.

Brandon Vera also takes on Fabricio Werdum, who is coming off a huge win over Gabriel Gonzaga. Vera hasn't fought since UFC 77, where he lost to Tim Sylvia via decision. Braking his hand in the first round of the Sylvia fight, Vera is determined to get back on the winning track to the Heavyweight title. This fight doesnt make it past the first round and ends in a controversial stoppage.

Other fights include Michael Bisping vs Jason Day in a middleweight matchup, and Marcus Davis who on a 11 fight win streak taking on Mike Swick who wants to make up for his lackluster performance at FN13 against Josh Burkman. Martin Kampmann also makes his first appearance since UFC 68.

Fight of the night in my opinion was not from the main card but the preliminary card, Eddie Sanchez vs Antoni Hardonk. This fight was a war. Ive never seen so many knockout punches taken in such little time without one guy at least falling to a knee! Man this was a great fight.
