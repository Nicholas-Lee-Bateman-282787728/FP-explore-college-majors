8360389,4,B002ATVDG4,"I was able to watch this dvd on my computer, by changing the region. I like Joanna Lumley's travel stories very much.  It did have a lot of preliminaries until it finally got to the Lights.  For someone who is never going to see the Lights, this was a good substitute.

University of North Alaska has another dvd about the Northern Lights, which has more of the Lights and explains how the lights come about.",1404000000,3,408,4.413333333333333
