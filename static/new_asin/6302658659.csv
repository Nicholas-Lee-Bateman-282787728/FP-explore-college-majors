489516,5,6302658659,"I remember seeing this in theaters in Jan 80. I've always loved this movie. Am a child of the 70's, teen angst of the 80's. I totally related. I was into roller skating, satin jackets, everything. It was available on cable frequently in early 80's, then just sort of disappeared , as disco faded.

It's a beautiful movie . So innocent compared to today's comparable movies. If you want a taste of nostalgia or just want to revisit your childhood/ youth, this is s must have. Had the biggest crush on Jim Bray leading actor, first & only film. A pro skater out of Ontario, California. I grew up in a town 30 minutes away, so that was really a fun fact to learn. Jimmy Van Patten is supporting cast, along with 70's, 80's beach queen Kimberly Beck & of course the Infamous Linda Blair, aka Terri Barkley, a privileged teen from Beverly Hills, disillusioned with her excess, wants to be one of the crowd. It's a fast, fun, action filled movie, with a great soundtrack, too!",1492128000,,970,4.480225988700565

489636,5,6302658659,"Here's a copy of my write-up of Roller Boogie on blu-ray from Home Theater Forum.  Enjoy!
========================================================================
Brad's Briefs:  Roller Boogie (1979).

Opening Summary.  Well here it is, the first of, and I'll say it again (thank you so much YouTube genius deadenddrivein) "" the devil's unholy trilogy of godawful Eighties roller disco flicks meant to destroy mankind's collective sense of good taste once and for all"".

He continues on :  ""Naturally, I could not possibly recommend this movie any more highly""

I'll go one further;  Naturally, I could not possibly recommend this Blu-ray any more highly (in other words HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!).

The Movie:  Well when your flick contains Don Goddard (Major West from the original Lost In Space TV series), James Van Patten and a grown-up Linda Blair showing off, and I can't really put this any other way, a body that many women would die for, that alone would be worth purchasing a Blu-ray.  Even if some of the acting is pretty much second rate.  Jim Bray, a champion roller skater was cast because it was thought easier to teach a roller skater to act than a actor to roller skate.  Which is pretty much true as far as it goes in this film.  Jim Bray did a half decent job but his lack of acting experience kinda shows.  He never got another acting job after Roller Boogie.

Anyway though, this big glop of 70s era cheese, and the nostalgia, shines through on this Blu release.  Seems the film had several co-equal sub-plots (Theresa's relationship with her parents,  her new relationship with new boyfriend Bobby and the Major West Gang trying to acquire Jammers to replace it with a shopping mall) all mashed into one.

I've probably talked this film to death by now anyway.

Oh and of course wherever there's a swanky event near a swimming pool, three guesses where most of the well-dressed, well-heeled guests are going to end up (you'll only need one).

Technical Aspects:

Picture Quality:  4.5

A little grainy in opening scenes (seems to be par for the course on a lot of films from that era) but overall quite sharp and it appears no DNR was applied (those in the know, correct me if I'm wrong) to the delight of film purists everywhere.

Audio Quality:  4.7

Sound was excellent, even if I only recognized one (maybe two) songs from the soundtrack, only one I believe made the Top 40 on Casey Kasem's AT40 Countdown, in contrast to the hit-laden soundtracks from Skatetown USA and Xanadu.  Might explain why Roller Boogie is seeing the Light of Blu but the other two we still await.

Forgot to check the AVR to see what kind of soundtrack was used but I'll update this once I get a chance to look again.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!

Eagerly await RAH's ""A Few Words About"" for this one.",1436832000,,2792,4.7782426778242675
489637,4,6302658659,"While I really enjoy the cheese factor in ""Roller Boogie"", and the soundtrack is fantastic, I recommend waiting for the inevitable re-release of this movie on DVD (or see if you can catch it on cable, I've seen it both on TCM as well at RETRO), as it would be tough to justify laying out big money for this original DVD pressing.

If you were a child of the 70's/80's and can remember disco in all its sequined glory, then you'll remember the little off-shoot craze called roller disco, and it was basically people dressing up and hitting the local skating rink to break out their best moves on wheels. If you can't imagine such a thing...then here's an entire film dedicated to the flash-in-the-pan phenomenon.

Terry (Linda Blair) comes from a wealthy family, drives the coolest sports car and lives in a huge mansion, But she sometimes gets the feeling that she's unloved by her parents. When she and her friends head out for a day of skating on the boardwalk, they run into Bobby James, the premiere skater in Venice Beach. Bobby is immediately taken by Terry and despite laying on his best movies, Terry still refuses his advances. But it's not long before Terry succumbs to the Roller Disco bug and she asks Bobby to teach her how to dance on skates. As the two skaters begin to find love, they have to deal with Terry's family disapproving of Bobby, and to top it off, their favorite skating rink looks like it's going to be closed down because of some local mobsters.

This is pure, grade A cheese. The plot has all the depth of a Josie & The Pussycats cartoon, but you're not watching ""Roller Boogie"" for story. You want to see awesome dance routines on wheels.....you want to hear the hottest disco tunes of 1979...you want to see Linda Blair in spandex.

So yes, this film is awful. But it's a wonderful, entertaining kind of awful.",1431302400,,1843,4.5589123867069485

489691,4,6302658659,"If you love roller skating and disco music spiced up with a bit of romance, drama and conflict where the underdog wins, you will enjoy this film. Linda Blair stars as Terry Barkley who breaks away from the high expectations of her wealthy parents by roller skating at the Venice Beach in California. There she meets Bobby played by Jim Bray, a former competitive skater whose skill is astonishing. She needs a break from the social pressure placed on her by their plans for her future career as a music major and classical flutist. Her father is a lawyer with a lucrative career in financial law, her mother is a homemaker and socialite. Both seem to take her for granted, Terry breaks free from the social role they envision for her by pursuing her hobby of roller skating which expresses her freedom and individuality.

Terry surprises her upper class close friends by socializing with a different crowd and immensely enjoys her new found freedom where nothing matters but the talent and skills of roller dancing. Terry eventually breaks through the restrictive  social barriers and becomes accepted by the ""ace"" roller skater Bobby. There is a roller disco contest planned at Jammers,  the roller rink which runs into a major problem.  The owner is threatened by a big time businessman mobster and his strong arm men. They force him to sign a contract to sell the rink to the business developer of a mall which they plan to build. Unknown to them, one of the roller skaters inadvertently taped the threatening conversation. Terry tries to enlist her father's help to save Jammers but he refuses. When Terry is performing with the Barkley Musical Quartet at a garden party, her friends show up and recognize the mobster businesssman and his associates, all kind of havoc results. Terry is reprimanded by her father who fails to understand the problems with Jammers and worse, he represents the mobster businessman in the deal.

Most viewers will appreciate and enjoy the confusion and conflict which arises when the mobsters chase Terry and her roller disco friends who are trying on their own to save Jammers and hold the Roller Disco contest as planned. The manner in which they help solve this major problem and save Jammers is well executed. Especially satisfying is how Terry's father eventually recognizes and realizes the legal quandary into which his high paying client placed him.and  he had to concede his daughter and her friends were right. It is a pleasure to watch events unfold and how the matter is resolved in favor of the Jammers owner and the Roller Disco skaters. The viewer cheers as Terry and her friends triumph and the Jammers Roller Disco contest is held as planned. It becomes icing on the cake to learn that Terry was accepted into the world famous Julliard's School of music and she will pursue her plans to become a classical flutist.

489753,4,6302658659,"Put a little boogie in it.  It's only been 34 years since Roller Boogie graced the big screen and only one year since I last watched it (in the summer, of course) on DVD. It's somewhat odd that only now do I decide to review this nearly inconsequential film. Maybe it has something to do with my recent roller skate purchase. By now you've run down the plot elsewhere; if you haven't, well, the overall plot is not the point.  The point is: roller skating and romance and nostalgic innocence and there you have it. For some reason (and maybe the reason includes the nights my elderly babysitter let me stay up past my bed time to watch the Thunderbirds trounce the visiting  Lobo Losers), I will watch the occasional roller skating movie just as some surfer types watch surf movies. What this means is that I have to admit to watching: Xanadu, Whip It, Kansas City Bomber, parts of Roll Bounce, and Chained Heat. What, Chained Heat doesn't feature roller skating? Ok, you got me, but it does a fine job of presenting another dimension of Linda Blair's ""acting range"". So why watch Roller Boogie? Try some of these excuses on: 1) Linda Blair, 2) roller skating, 3) PG-rated non-threatening innocent romance, 4) disco-music-era nostalgia.  [Side note out of left field: Before everyone and their seven year old had a cell phone, it was a novel concept at the time that Linda Blair's character made a phone call with her ""car phone"".]  Overall, I liked Roller Boogie, and so did my wife (she was cajoled into watching it).

I knew I was in trouble 25 seconds into the film when the credit ""An Irwin Yablans Production"" rolled up the screen. (Feel free to check out his other work.) It turned out I was right: this film is basically ""Saturday Night Fever"" with worse music and much, much worse writing: compared to ""Roller Boogie,"" ""Saturday Night Fever"" is sedate and tasteful. The story is utterly predictable: pretentious Beverly Hills girl (Linda Blair) gets involved with a buffoon from the wrong side of the tracks (Jim Bray) who dreams of his future in roller disco at the next Olympic games. The writing is painful corny, so much so that it made me laugh out loud at several dramatically significant places. The film shows roller boogie uniting all parts of the socioeconomic spectrum; look for my favorite demonstration of this, which involves an enormous afro with headphones worn over it at all times.

Blair, whose horrible rich parents just don't understand her, want her to pursue her musical art at Juilliard and are dumbfounded when she yells things like ""I'm a musical genius! What a drag! What a bummer!"" Sadly, this is some of the better writing in the film. While Blair gallivants around with her seedy roller boogie boy toy, the film gets down to the plot (such as it is) involving a couple of mobsters who are also real estate developers who want to buy the roller disco from the owner, Jammer. He doesn't want to sell, but they threaten to burn the building down with the kids in it. Fortunately the kids have a plan to save the disco, which involves getting Blair's dad, a lawyer, to listen to their case at a formal flute recital at their palace. Unfortunately the two goons are there and are clients of Blair's dad, so the kids have to take matters into their own hands to keep the moguls from buying the roller disco. Mostly this plan involves turning the flute recital into a pool party, and Blair pouting.

Jammer decides to sell under the threats, which is so traumatizing to the kids that one of them becomes a Hare Krishna in one of the funniest scenes in film history. But wait! The kids discover that the afro headphones actually tape recorded the conversation threatening Jammer! What will happen? Only the funniest car chase in history. It's basically a couple of kids on skates versus a Cadillac. I especially enjoyed the part where our heroes decide to get towed by the very car containing the gun-toting thugs, but the use of a table to jump over the car in what must stand as the most pointless stunt of 1979 is my very favorite. Of course the kids win, Jammer keeps his valuable roller disco, and Blair and Bray go on to win a huge roller boogie contest. The ending is high on pathos, and is humorously staged around a large roller disco trophy. The whole last half of the movie made me think how happy Jammer must have been to keep his valuable roller disco, because that will never go out of style. He was obviously right to turn down millions offered by the real estate goons and live his dream.

This film is extremely difficult to rate, as I would actually rate it differently for different viewers: if you want to see a good movie, this is in sub-one star terrain, but if you want to see a camp classic in which every single frame has something to laugh at, this is off the charts at five plus stars. Since I have to make a choice, I settled on three stars as a kind of average. This film is truly dreadful, but nonetheless absolutely and ruthlessly entertaining.",1238112000,3,3503,4.555555555555555
489813,4,6302658659,"The roller disco craze was the polar opposite of what I was into in the seventies.  I kind of looked like Joey Ramone sporting a Wrangler jacket and an iron on decal Pink Floyd T-Shirt.  The one time I went to the rink was when my buddies wanted to pick up chicks.  None of us looked like the buff and bronzed skaters in ""Roller Boogie"".  I probably fell on my behind as the din of Blondie's ""Heart of Glass"" tortured my eardrums.  Needless to say I wasn't in the opening day crowd when this flick opened.  To be honest, I think the roller disco craze had pretty much petered out when this film was released in the holiday season of 1979.  Viewing this movie as a time capsule curio, though, it's not bad.  The makers were probably trying to cash in on the moment's craze, if roller disco was truly a phenomenon, but it is a sincere effort.  Granted, the skating scenes are not on par with the electricity of the dancing in ""Saturday Night Fever"".  For that matter the acting isn't first rate and the dialogue is oh so corny.  I give ""Roller Boogie"" the pass because the young cast seem to have an infectuous enthusiasm for what they're doing and it comes across as winning.  Linda Blair is cute in the girl-next-door mold but it is pretty obvious that she was doubled in her skating scenes.  ""Roller Boogie"" is cinematic ice cream and I don't mean that as a negative.",1236384000,,1368,4.380952380952381
489814,3,6302658659,"Yes, I admit it.  The ONLY reason I bought this DVD was to see Linda Blair in all her panty hosed/spandex glory.  Was I disappointed? NO!!!!!!!!
  Linda is fantastic as the young, nubile Theresa 'Terry' Barkley.  About to go to Julliard, Terry picks up a new fad-Roller skating.  She soon catches the eye of Robert ""Bobby"" James. (Played by Jim Bray, a real life champion skater, in his only film role)  After turning down his advances at first, soon, he is teaching her how to `dance skate', and they fall in love.  Mixed in the plot is a ""Roller Boogie"" contest which Terry wants to win, local mobsters who plan to close down the Boogie hall (and also have Terry's dad as their lawyer) and the young gang of skaters(Led by Bobbie and Terry) determined to stop them.
 This being a ""PG"" film, Linda Blair does get nude, as she did in a few others but I like the fun spirit of this one, as opposed to the meaner, harder feeling of her other films.

 He meets a young uperclass woman Terry (played by Linda Blair) who is destined to go to Juliard music acadamy becuase of her musical genius. But Terry is fed up with her boring life.
She doesn't like always having to be little miss perfect, and she is  looking to have some fun.
Terry loves to skate, so she asks Bobby (who is the best skater on the Venice Beach Boardwalk), if he would teach her all the moves on wheels. Of course they fall in love.
The story line itself is not the best part, but surely the skating and the funky disco music is.
I actually got to see Jim Bray skate in person, when he was promoting this movie, and he is one of the best Artistic skaters in the business.

One star is probably not too many for a movie that isn't really a ""movie"" in the sense of having a coherent plot, credible dialogue, minimal acting skills, etc. ""Roller Boogie"" would have made a perfect Charlie's Angels episode -- in fact, it did, when Jaclyn, Farrah and Kate (or their stunt doubles) donned their four-wheel, suede-booted skates and chased the bad guys down Venice Beach.

But the Angels were the Angels; everything they did was in the greater service of looking good, acting very little, and trying not to laugh their way through ridiculous plots. ""Roller Boogie"", on the other hand, offers us Queen of the B's Linda Blair surrounded by a bevy of nonactors, a raft of horrendous disco songs (this stuff makes the Bee Gees sound like great art), and endless choreographed disco-on-skates numbers.  Round, and round, round and round the kids skate.  And the bad guys lose at the end.

489861,3,6302658659,"Before the days of ""in-line"" skates there was a less forgiving variety that went in and out of fashion for a century with everyone but elementary school age children. ""Roller Boogie"" (1979) caught one of the periods when the activity had once again become trendy, especially with teenagers. Skate shops opened all over the place but the really trendy location was Venice, California. ""Roller Boogie"" involves a bunch of teens who hang around on the Venice boardwalk and do a lot of roller skating; and burn their eyeballs girl and boy watching.

Because much of the film is composed of many cinema verite (""fly on the wall film-making"" where the filmmakers attempt to make their presence as unobtrusive as possible) documentary shots of real skaters engaging in real skating at this real location, the film is more interesting and impressive now than at the time of its release. ""Breakin"" was a similar film from the same time period which also unintentionally documented a portion of social history (insert break dancing here).

Of course those who went to ""Roller Boogie"" at the time of its release were mostly there to see Linda Blair in her abbreviated skating outfits; which had been widely showcased in the film distributor's marketing campaign. ""Roller Boogie"" was basically a cheap exploitation film that disappointed very few viewers because it delivered exactly what it promised and maybe a little bit more.

Rich girls Terry (Blair) and Lana (too old television actress Kimberly Beck) do their slumming on the boardwalk, where they skate up and down to the pop music beat from their now ancient looking transistor radio headphones. The plot is mostly about Terry's puppy love romance with Bobby (real life super-skater Jim Bray) the summer before she heads off to college.

There is also a story about developers conspiring to tear down the old roller rink. One of these is played by former ""Lost in Space"" pre-teen heartthrob Mark Goddard, whose career never took off after his adventures with Dr. Smith and the robot had made him famous. MST3K favorite Beverly Garland has a small part as Terry's rich mom.

489863,5,6302658659,"One of the heartbreaking things about getting old, aside from, you know, the dying part, is realizing the things that gave you such joy and happiness as a kid are no longer fun.  Endless games of Battleship, washing down Poprocks with Koolaid, fart jokes* - one day you just wake up and think, This is really kind of lame.

Roller Boogie is the exception to the Corinthian curse.  I watched this as many times as I could catch it on circa 1981 HBO** and I never got tired of it.  I was starting my teenage years and just like Mulder, I wanted to believe.  I wanted to believe that in a few years, after  I permed my hair, coated my mouth with cherry lipgloss, and tucked my spandexed legs into a pair of skates I too would meet the boy of my dreams, fall madly in love and skate away, arm and arm, into the sunset.

Roller Boogie doesn't quite end that way***, but it's still close enough to be a lot of fun, even __ years later (I don't know when you're going to read this.)  First of all, there's the essential corny love story.  The male lead, Bobby James, is focused on his goal of winning the gold at the next Olympics.  He's so determined that he doesn't let the trivial fact of that roller skating is not, has never been, and will never be an Olympic sport dissuade him.  Bobby meets up with rich girl Terry, who's a concert flutist destined for Julliard (she's such a phenomenal flutist that she can play an entire concerto without moving her fingers).  They have an instant attraction - Bobby sees the sweet, vulnerable side that Terry tries to hide, and Terry sees....well, I'm not sure.  Unfortunately, Bobby is a doofus.  He wears wristbands and kneesocks and talks like a Minnesota/New York hybrid.  ""Furst chew wanna skaaate, den chew don wanna skaaate.  Whut is it wit chew?""  But he's nice enough, and Terry, like most teenage girls, is not too picky.  Before you can say Xanadu these two are an item.

There's more to the movie - the kids must save the local roller rink from the local mafia goons - but it's really just a backdrop to the skating.  Mark Lester's got skaters galore and puts them to good use, along with a B list soundtrack.  It all designed to lead up to the very last skate - where Bobby and Terry skate in the Roller Boogie Contest.  Of course, they win, and I think Bobby deserves some kind of Olympic medal - power lifting, maybe - for managing to hoist the chubby thighed Terry over his head.

Roller Boogie is fun because, unlike the horrible Dirty Dancing, it makes no pretentions about what it is.  It's just a cheesy, entertaining love story with lots of good skating scenes.  That's all it needs to be.

There is also a good 70s soundtrack that is available if you like the disco skating beat.

489867,2,6302658659,"This one is a complete hoot. I caught this low-budget, formulaic 1979 film this past weekend on the big screen at the fully packed Castro Theater in San Francisco as part of a roller-disco midnight madness program. The crowd went wild at every absurd turn of the plot, and it's no wonder. Directed by potboiler specialist Mark L. Lester, this ultimate cheese of a roller disco musical avoids a permanent home in the video junk heap simply because of the sheer idiocy of the storyline and the wealth of unintentional humor permeating the film. There are movies that are intentionally vile and not worthy of reviewing, but this one is actually full of good spirits albeit with nothing in the way of taste, wit or common sense.

In what has to be the steepest career freefall for a former Oscar nominee, an extremely nubile, twenty-year old Linda Blair stars as Terry Barkley, a prodigious flautist on her way to Juilliard, who tires of being ignored by her wealthy, 90210-based parents and decides to run away to Venice Beach for a whole night. Upon meeting Bobby James, the king of the disco-driven roller skaters, she decides she wants to learn some moves to win the big roller boogie contest at Jammer's, the local roller disco rink. My favorite plot point is Bobby's aspiration to become an Olympic roller skating gold medalist...even though no one tells him it isn't an Olympic event. Of course, Terry is rich, Bobby is poor, and consequently, romantic sparks are inevitable. Complications, however, occur when a thuggish land developer blackmails Jammer to sell his rink, so he can raze the building and build a shopping mall. The rest of the plot is not worth disclosing except to say that it is as preposterous as the convoluted set-up, and thanks to the wooden acting, horrendous dialogue and hilarious skating sequences, it makes for grade-A camp entertainment.

In skin-tight leotards and enough make-up to scare off a Santa Monica Boulevard hooker, Blair makes a sincere attempt at portraying Terry's teenaged angst. Of course, it helps her professional standing that she is playing opposite real-life roller skating champion Jim Bray, a non-actor who was cast as Bobby only because the producers could not find a leading man who could actually skate. Innately geeky, the never-to-be-seen-again Bray certainly tries hard, though he is defeated by the film's numerous skating sequences which have been inserted so we can be impressed by his expertise. Instead, they provide the film's biggest laughs - the opening where he leads dozens of fellow skaters to the boardwalk to the strains of Cher's disco-diva anthem, ""Hell on Wheels""; the ridiculous chase sequence through the streets of Venice where Terry and Bobby are chased unsuccessfully by a speeding car; the concluding roller boogie contest (of course); and in what has to be the absolute nadir, a solo skating number full of cornball treacle dedicated to the drunken Jammer.

Familiar faces from the baby-boomer TV generation dot the supporting cast, among them Beverly Garland (""Scarecrow and Mrs. King"" and ""My Three Sons"") and Roger Perry (""The Facts of Life"") as Terry's parents; and Mark Goddard (""Lost in Space"") as the villainous land developer. If all that is not enough, there are other lures to consider - the blaring disco music; the groovy, circa-1979 clothes; the forced slapstick (in particular, a fruit-throwing melee and a very non-spontaneous pool dunking at a garden party). It's hard to think of a movie more execrable, yet the film has an endearing charm for all its misguided inanity. It's worthwhile just for the unintended guffaws. In the 1979-80 holy trinity of roller disco cinema, ""Xanadu"" may be ""Gone With the Wind"" and ""Skatetown U.S.A."" may be ""West Side Story"", but this one must certainly be ""Citizen Kane"".",1138579200,16,3805,5.007898894154819

And from the moment this movie started, with an opening sequence of over-the-top public disco skating by scrawny, mop-headed nerds (inexplicably fawned over by hot babes), this promised to be a gem.  I laughed out loud at the hyped up moves and supreme coordination, which reminded me of a cross between the June Taylor Dancers, Showgirls, and the scene in Zoolander where the male models go on their frappuccino spree (right before the unfortunate ""innocent gasoline fight"" incident).

Yes, it was corny and predictable.  Not only that, but the first half of it had the words terribly out of sync with the lip movement.  But then, suddenly, it didn't matter.  Something started happening.  I really started to have fun watching this movie.  Ok, maybe it was the martini shaker I had on the side table, but I really LIKED it!

For one thing, (admittedly getting past everyone's hair-do in this movie), I have always thought Linda Blair was a doll.  Yes, I have heard all the chipmumk remarks, and her hair-do certainly didn't help that at all.  But her spark and smile remind me of a modern Doris Day.  Really!

The guy, Bobby, was pale, skinny, rubbery and mop-headed.  Except for the mop-headed part, this description could also be applied to Fred Astaire.  Old movies always featured kind of nerdy guys like this.  They weren't he-men; they were awkwardly graceful.  The disco hair-do was unfortunate, but his skate-dancing was really good, and seemed not to be so over-the-top later.  Maybe you just get used to it after a while.  I really enjoyed watching the dancing scenes--and of course the chase scene on skates!

Predictable?  Sure. Who didn't know, after seeing the opening scene of the pool at the rich people's party, that everyone would end up in said pool.  Still, you can't wait to see it happen.

However - as the regular author of that 'column' has returned from sabbatical and my efforts in his stead have now been rendered superfluous, I thought I might impart a few of my entirely idiosyncratic musings as regards this film. As an example of pure '70's cheese, one would be hard-pressed to find a better exemplar of the era, it's fashions, musical taste (in the sense of genre - don't listen for big hits on the soundtrack, because there aren't any ) and general cultural miliu. This movie should have been placed in a time capsule that future generations might gain a keener appreciation for just what the 'me' generation was really like. Apart from nostalgia, the single redeeming quality of 'Roller Boogie' is the presence of Linda Blair. She's the perky, archetypal teen heroine and actually a fairly good actress. However, it is her appearance in this film that will cause you to take real notice - ILM, eat your hearts out, because Ms. Blair should have won the award for best special effect the year this came out. I guarantee that you'll forget all about that snotty, pea-soup-spewing 12 year old from The Exorcist once you have seen this movie. She blossomed into a jaw-droppingly gorgeous young woman, and mere words do not suffice - if there was only one reason ( okay, two - Linda Blair's legs ) to see 'Roller Boogie', her presence in the film is it, and while I would love to give the movie a higher rating, I'm afraid I can't. If positive reviews for films were awarded soley on the basis of the beauty of the actresses, then I suppose 'Charlie's Angels' would be held up as the latest Citizen Kane - But it's not. And certainly, neither is this ( however, in a contest between the latest Demi Moore vehicle and 'Roller Boogie',I do feel this is a superior product ). As such, despite whatever captivation I felt/feel for the beautiful Ms. Blair, and her singular charms,I can only offer one star for this epic of adventure and romance in the roller rink.",1096416000,5,2104,4.628342245989304

I saw this film 2 times in the mall theater back in 1979. Linda Blair was hot and the short lived ""roller disco"" craze was something I was invested in.

Then I could (and did) always catch the movie on cable. Then it all but disapeared until the VHS was released in the 90's. When I rented it and was old enough to see how completely ridiculous it was it only added to it's charm (and Linda Blair was still hot).

What sticks out when I watched the film a few years ago is that the ""gang"" wants the boogie contest, no matter what.

The owner of the club gets threatened by the ""evil businessmen"" that if he doesn't sell the rink to them (so they can build a shopping mall) they will burn down the rink with the everyone inside.

Once the gang finds this out, they are not as interested in saving thier lives as they are making sure the roller boogie contest will go on.

You gotta love it.

Now, in a couple weeks from now, ""Roller Boogie"" will come out on DVD. It will have an anamorphic widescreen transfer (great! MGM has dragged out thier old pan and scan transfers for some lesser library titles being put out on DVD. A new Anamorphic transfer on this film remembered by only a few is really appreciated) and a theatrical trailer (Great! After all, it coming out on DVD in 16:9 is almost a miracle, I didn't expect that they would spend too much money on supliments.

489926,4,6302658659,"Hey, the fact that I'm actually reviewing Roller Boogie surprises me as much as it does you.  I sort of have this thing for Linda Blair, you see, and she was twenty years old when this film was released in 1979 - instead of turning her own head around (The Exorcist), she was now old enough to starting turning guys' heads instead.  Unfortunately, all of the guys in this film are full-fledged, knee-high-tube-sock-wearing products of that awful decade called the 1970s, but Linda was looking fine from start to finish, and that's really all that matters.
I can't believe I'm saying this, but I actually liked this movie.  It doesn't look good on paper, though.  You basically have the world's most ubiquitous cookie-cutter plot, a good deal of bad acting, tons of terrible disco music, awful 70s attire, and about ten times more skating than you find in the film Xanadu.  You could give yourself a lobotomy and still predict everything that is going to happen in this movie, yet for reasons I can't explain, Roller Boogie isn't that bad.  Linda Blair plays Terry Barkley, a poor little rich girl whose parents ignore her and thus drive her to rebel; she doesn't enjoy being a musical prodigy, and she certainly doesn't want to go to Juilliard.  What does she do?  She goes roller skating and, after meeting up with local roller boogie whiz kid Bobby James (Jim Bray), she announces her new ambition in life is to win the roller boogie dance contest down at Jammer's skating rink.  You see where this is going?  It's your classic poor boy-rich girl love story.  Something is still missing, though.  Oh, I know, let's throw in a sleazy businessman and his two goons, and - yes, I've got it! - let's have them threaten to burn down Jammer's skating rink as part of their evil plan to put up a shopping mall.  Obviously, those crazy kids are going to have to come up with a plan to save their beloved skating rink.  We cannot possibly let this movie end without that big roller boogie dance contest we were all so looking forward to.
As you can see, apart from Linda Blair's starring role, there is no discernible reason for me to have enjoyed Roller Boogie, but I did.  That doesn't mean I want to watch it again any time soon, though.  For my fellow Linda Blair fans, I say go ahead and bite the bullet and watch this movie; you'll be glad you did - maybe.",1087430400,41,2355,4.531914893617022

Plot -Fair

Why would I like this film? For one thing, the outdoor shots of Venice, California are well-done, and bring back memories of an fun time in a long ago place.  And the music?  Well, OK, it's disco, break dancing music, but it's fun to watch, listen to, and remember. The cast is attractive, Linda Blair does a competent job, and the cinematography is pretty good.
The plot is the oldest storyline in the book: boy meets girl, boy hangs out in roller rink, boy loses girl, boy loses roller rink, boy gets girl, boy saves roller rink.
Mark Lester directed the film.  Lester also directed one of the classic drive-in films of all time, ""Truck Stop Women"" in 1974.  (Tag line from that flick - 'No Rig Was Too Big for the Truck Stop Women'.  Classic?  You bet!).  Roller Boogie is of the same genre.

489929,4,6302658659,"I know Roller Boogie has not big cinematic values. Maybe that's why it hasn't been released on DVD. The story is the classic tale about a rich girl who defies her parents by hanging  out with a poor skater. The teenager cliches are all over the movie. In spite of this, I think that the real value of this movie (besides the sentimental one), is that it shows a particular moment in late 70's culture that a lot of people enjoyed as teenagers. The music and the way the characters have fun disco-skating, is one of my happiest movie memories of that time. I don't understand the reason why they haven't released it on DVD yet. There are a lot of bad, bad movies out there being sold on DVD. But the most incredible thing is that the best element of the movie (the soundtrack!), has not been released on CD ever. I've tried to make an LP-MD transfer from my old record but the sound is awful. I love Bob Esty's songs and I don't find them anywhere. Please, release both, the DVD and the soundtrack! A lot of buyers will appreciate it, I'm sure.",1054684800,15,1043,4.321428571428571

I remember going to see this movie about 5 times or more, this movie was wonderful with the great skate scenes.  This movie should come out on DVD and should come down a little on the price.",1048032000,3,296,3.8360655737704916
489971,5,6302658659,"This is a must have if you were a child in the 70's-especially if you lived in California like I did when this first came out!
Whenever I watch this, It truly reminds me of what the times were actually like back then. I never left the house without my skates and I always pretended to be Linda Blair. Now granted, this is no acting masterpiece by any stretch. Jim Bray was a far better skater than actor! I give it 5 stars because of the time it represents, the music and of course Linda Blair!! I wish I could get the soundtrack!!",1038355200,,531,4.165048543689321
489972,5,6302658659,"That is what I think most people who look at this would say. What lunatic would give ""Roller Boogie"" 5 stars???? Well, let me be the first to say that this is certainly a B flick. The reason I give it 5 stars is that it is the Definition of a B flick. It lacks in character depth, plot, script, and production. But it does all those things so well. The movie pulses to the beat of Disco, and this could easily be the ""Saturday Night Fever"" on roller skates. In fact, that is Exactly what it is. Interesting high points are cool shots of Venice ""Muscle"" Beach and songs by Cher and Earth, Wind and Fire. And while this film takes a back seat to Linda Blair's previous work in ""The Exorcist"", it was an attempt to show a lighter side to her talent. Unfortunately, she was forever type-cast as the anti-scream queen horror heroine, and her career took a plunge. For my summation I will say this film is at times humorous, with an interesting look at a time when things were a little more simple. And who can resist the upbeat soundtrack?",1011830400,10,1034,4.3076923076923075

This movie showcases some of it. Who doesn't love Linda Blair. The storyline was weak and the acting leaves nothing to be said. But if you want corny, crazy, sometimes funny, off the wall comedy, with good dancing sprinkled in between the lousy acting, then this is for you. It's a guilty pleasure to watch late disco-eque movies that still tried to capture the feeling of the time. Sequins, lame', and rainbow suspenders. We can't escape them, it's a part of us. So sit back and have a laugh.",1496275200,2,655,4.413223140495868
