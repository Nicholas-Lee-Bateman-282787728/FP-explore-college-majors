8439097,5,B004RPQSO6,"This would be a fairly routine Western, save for the fact that it has the redeeming virtue of having a potent message about society to convey, much as did The Ox-Bow Incident. Man From Del Rio's message has as much validity today as it did then, perhaps more so given the current anti-immigrant hysteria and all the prejudices, stereotypes and scapegoating that goes with it. David Robles (Anthony Qunin, who was born in Mexico) is an educated man who has learned to be a gunfighter after four white bad dudes shot-up his town. He has already killed three of the men when he arrives in this new town in the quest of the fourth man, whom he quickly dispatches. He is then ""hired"" to be the new sheriff, not to keep law and order, but to be a handy ""gun"" if things get too rough. But because he is ""Mexican,"" only the town drunk seems to view him as ""acceptable"" to be ""friendly"" with, as all the other white people (both men and women) shun him in their own fashion; like all ""Mexicans,"" he is assumed to be ignorant and worthless company to keep. The only other ""Mexican"" in town, Estella (Katy Jurado) doesn't think much of him either at first, believing he is just some thug; after all, she is too busy trying to ""fit in,"" at least in as much as the white men will dance with her in the local saloon. What we discover is that Robles is a lot smarter, clever--and human--than the white people in this town (Quinn certainly makes this more believable than Burt Lancaster did in Valdez is Coming), born out in particular in the film's final showdown scene. Quinn gives such a muscular performance that it is all those prejudiced folks around him who are the ones who look weak, not too bright and needy. You'd never see a film like this made these days, because no one wants to come to grips with the reality of not-always-subtle prejudice against Hispanics in this country, however people try to ""rationalize"" it.",1508716800,2,1913,4.5
8439098,4,B004RPQSO6,"Kind of a stock western in many ways. Gunslinger comes into town, shoots another gun slinger and eventually becomes sheriff when other gunslingers run the existing sheriff out of town.

Anthony Quinn does a pretty good job of playing the gun hand.

A low budget type western that is better than the average low budget western.",1432339200,,326,4.803571428571429
8439099,5,B004RPQSO6,"A superior western drama, with the emphasis on drama, although there's plenty of action too. But the story really grabs you. It starts out like most westerns, with many of the standard stereotypes, but then gradually develops into a fairly complex character study, placing the protagonist in an impossible situation. Unlike many westerns, the climax is highly satisfying & believable, not just a lot of idiotic gun play. Quinn is great as usual, giving the hero depth and heart, at once vulnerable & courageous, transforming him from a saddle tramp into an honorable, admirable man facing his own fears as well as the very credible danger. Katie Jurado is also great, as usual. The film is somewhat reminiscent of High Noon, only not quite as powerful, yet more believable, too.

That said, $20 is still too much to pay for the DVD. It's pretty darn good, but not that good.",1359158400,5,874,4.826666666666667
8439100,4,B004RPQSO6,"Excellent Western!  Anthony Quinn as Robles gives top-notch performance in a role which fits him like a rawhide glove.  Outstanding supporting cast includes Katy Jurado, Peter Whitney, Douglas Fowley and Whit Bissell.  This is a no-nonsense yarn about gunfighters -- no hostile Native Americans, cavalry, bank robbers, dance hall girls or skillful horsemen.  The atmosphere is very bleak, even though the sun shines harshly on the all-but-abandoned Kansas cattle town.  There are no supermen; Robles even states humbly that it took him ten years to learn how to use a gun. There are no praiseworthy characters; all the white people are racist concerning the two Mexican-Americans who reside in their town.  There isn't even a hero in the usual sense. Robles is an illiterate and penniless drifter who rides in motivated by vengeance, tries to use his newly found status as sheriff-for-hire to get himself accepted (without success) among the narrow-minded townsfolk and winds up getting his wrist broken in a fistfight -- a twist of fate that renders the outsider forever unable to carry on with his one true talent: killing others who live by the gun.",1349913600,2,1152,5.101063829787234
8439101,5,B004RPQSO6,"This movie was first released in 1956(2011), in B/W and full screen 1.33.1 and runs 82 minutes. The sound and picture quality are very good. There are no extras. The film starts with Dave Robalis (ANTHONY QUINN) playing with a dog, when 2 strangers ride into the town. Robalis has been waiting for Dan Ritchie. Robalis explains to Dan, that the other 4 men were dead and next in a gun draw, Dan is shot dead. Robalis has also a left chest injury and is taken to Dr Adams. Luckily, he has a minor wound. The saloon boss, Banniger introduces Robalis to his other boys. Sheriff Tilman is sent by the town folk to the saloon to keep order. The drunk gunmen tease the sheriff and Robalis had to shoot 2 of them. Robalis is also interested in Estella (KATY JURADO) who works for Dr Adams. The sheiff and his wife leave town. There is a town meeting to discuss law and order. The town offers Robalis the job of sheriff and he excepts. However, he soon realises that he is not excepted socially. In a fist fight with Banniger, Robalis breaks his right wrist. He tells Banniger to leave town by 10 am or fight.
How will it end? Will Robalis or Banniger leave town? Does Banniger know that Robalis has broken his right wrist and may not be able to draw? Does the town care? What will Estella do?
