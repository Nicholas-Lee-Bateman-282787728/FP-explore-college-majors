8105840,5,B000E5KPCO,"I'm in America and had to get it on Video tape as region of dvd would not work for me.  This is a terrific interview with Dusty.  It is funny and also enlightening to hear her speak on a number of topics.  Dionne Warwick is briefly interviewed and sings Dusty's praises as being a wonderful vocalist.  Of course, Dusty was a fan of Dionne's as well but they were also rivals for the Bacharach songs.  Burt Bacharach also has a brief interview as well as the producer (Jerry) of the Memphis LP.  Wish I could get it on dvd instead of the VHS tape.",1474156800,,546,4.201923076923077
