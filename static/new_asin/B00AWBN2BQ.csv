5518652,4,B00AWBN2BQ,"Pace is a ""walk"" or ""stroll""..some of it is gentle slopes, some flat... a nice pace for a beginner or after injury.",1413158400,4,115,4.2727272727272725
8558287,5,B00AWBN2BQ,"I love this. Except for feeling the breeze in my face and smelling nature's perfume, I feel like I am right there. I would probably have given this 4.5 stars for only one minor reason. Since my aerobic workouts are about 30 minutes long, it would have been nice to have a menu through which I could have selected either the forest river walk or the rocky seaside walk. Other than that, it is perfect and highly recommended for anyone who loves walking through the forests of God's nature. Well done.",1494374400,,499,4.4945054945054945

We've been to Acadia twice, so love the ""walk"".",1460505600,,62,4.166666666666667
8558294,1,B00AWBN2BQ,Very amateurish in my opinion. Also the choice of scenery is not very good unless you like tree roots on top of the ground and not very pretty trees. The only part I liked was the glimpses of the stream occasionally. No choice of music and it was not that great. I'll be disposing of this one since I'd never watch it again. Overpriced too - almost $20 with shipping. I'll be sticking to Tony Helsloot's World Nature Video - they're in a league of their own with a huge selection of beautiful videos!!!,1455235200,6,502,4.351063829787234
8558295,5,B00AWBN2BQ,"I have walked through parts of this area and it was like being there again.  Wonderful job.  The pace is just right and the bird/nature sounds are so enjoyable.  I like how the ""walker"" pauses at times to soak in a pleasant spot for a moment as I would have done.  Makes my elliptical time more enjoyable.  Will be purchasing more of these for certain.",1452297600,7,352,4.3538461538461535
