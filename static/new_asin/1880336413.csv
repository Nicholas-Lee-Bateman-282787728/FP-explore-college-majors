8135487,5,1880336413,"As an instructor, this is the kind of tape I'm always on the lookout for. It has a good variety of drills that work for any age. I'm using it for my kids and sparring classes and introducing some of the drills in the advanced adult classes. Great stuff if you teach sparring or are looking for some new ideas to boost the energy level in class.",1010102400,4,344,4.149253731343284
8135488,5,1880336413,"This tape has a lot of great drills on it. I bought it for my son and daughter, both black belts in Tae Kwon Do and they love it. We even set up the circuit training set up on the tape in our basement so they can practice at home.
One of the great things about is this tape is that it has both kids and adults demonstrating. I've bought a bunch of tapes for my kids and some of them have all adults, which makes it hard for them to relate to it. It's great for them to see other kids who have excellent skills. Very motivating!",982281600,6,527,3.888888888888889
8135489,2,1880336413,I expected a much more detailed and extensive coverage of Taekwondo moves. The tape is a mere forty minutes long and is to say the least lacking anything different or inventive that black belts don't already know. I was very disappointed.,981504000,4,238,4.829268292682927
