2407348,5,B000B7QCOK,"This is a fun workout video with easy-to-follow moves and instruction. Jennifer Gilardi is motivating and energetic without

projecting the feigned enthusiasm and annoying fake smile so many of these workout video instructors seem to wear. I like the fun variety provided by the hip-hop, latin, and jazz sections, and it feels great to stretch your muscles through the ballet moves in the last segment after all of that dancing! I highly recommend this one!",1139011200,13,457,5.093333333333334
2407349,5,B000B7QCOK,"This workout is so much fun!  I have always done only yoga and am very partial to the Gaiam videos, but my New Year's Resolution was to add some cardio work.  In the last month I have branched out and purchased several new dvds and this one is great.  I was intrigued because of the ballet exercise segment, which is wonderful, but I found that I enjoy all the dance segments.  The moves are not difficult and the instructor is very easy to understand.  One of the best parts of this video is the bonus section on energy.  The thing I like about this whole dvd is that the instructor makes you really feel that you can do it, and you find yourself believing it too!  I would be interested in another of Jennifer's workouts or another Prevention workout as well, since I have been so impressed with this one.",1137024000,62,807,4.34
2407350,5,B000B7QCOK,"This is one good workout.  I love it and do it 2-3 times a week and have noticed already (in two weeks) a small change in my shape.  There are 4 10-minute segments; Ballet for toning up, Latin, Hip Hop and Jazz for the cardio parts.  The instruction is very easy to follow.  She cues very well and to the beat.  All up, it's about 73 minutes or so, but it's fun and enjoyable and you'll get results I bet.  I have.",1135382400,84,414,3.9878048780487805
2407361,5,B000B7QCOK,"Absolutely love this video, I admit its hard at first but I suggest doing the same routine everyday till you get it down but I have owned it for almost two weeks now and I am already feeling more toned and energized, a must get for those who will stick to it and won't give up!!",1390521600,,278,3.982142857142857
2407362,4,B000B7QCOK,"I like this workout DVD. I took several workout classes at the YMCA and wanted something to use at home. My only complaint about this DVD is that some of the routines are a bit too quick and it was a bit hard for me to be able to learn them. The instructor shows you how to do something a couple of times and that's it. It's on to the routine. I had to keep starting, stopping and skipping back on the DVD until I got the hang of them. I'm not sure anything could have prevented that because I haven't used any other workout DVD's.  I added ankle weights and hand weights to a few of the routines. All-in-all I feel the DVD was worth the cost.",1374192000,,643,4.0234375
2407363,5,B000B7QCOK,"I have most of the videos by Jennifer Galardi and I enjoy this one as much as I like the other videos put out by her.  New dance moves, not just repeats from the past.  This DVD has hip-hop, latin, jazz and ballet routines.",1363046400,,223,4.045454545454546
2407364,4,B000B7QCOK,"I like most of the Prevention videos. This one is fun, but I did find the hip-hop section to be rather awkward, even after doing it many times. I end up mostly doing my own thing during that part, or I just skip it. The rest of the video provides a good workout. I really like how the ballet routine is near the end, leading into the cool down.",1332115200,,344,4.0
2407365,3,B000B7QCOK,"For those who are already used to dance programs, I'll bet this is fun. Like some of the other reviewers, I agree that there are not enough ""how to"" shots. Perhaps it is not meant for beginners; it doesn't claim that it is. I shy away from dance workouts at the Y, so I thought I would try this at home to get more familiar with basic moves. I don't even want to do it in the privacy of my own home because I feel so uncoordinated.",1328054400,,431,3.9655172413793105
2407366,2,B000B7QCOK,"My mother had bought me this as a gift. I was excited because I LOVE dancing. I was excited to put it in and do it, but when I had pressed play,it was SO hard for me to follow because it was SO fast. She didn't explain the moves that well, she just went RIGHT into it. It's fast, I barely was able to keep up let alone do the move. You need SO much space, and she is so annoying by adding ""personality"" in almost every sentence. This is definitely not something I'm into. the ONLY one I like is the Ballet one because 1: Slower! 2: She's great at explaining that one instead of all the others! 3: It's way less-harsher on the knees.

My knees were killing me, and not in the ""sore"" way, in the ""I think I popped something"" way. It hurt So bad!

Not worth it!",1327881600,,758,3.9802631578947367
2407367,4,B000B7QCOK,"The moves are a little tricky but tricky moves are interesting and fight workout ""plateau"" once I learn it. Jennifer teaches each move by building up from seperate simple movements without slowing down the pace. This allows me to go into the ""final"" moves and workout immediately with the same music when I became familiar with the moves  later and maximize my work without ""dragging"" through the ""teaching"" parts every time. I like Jennifer's style and moves and own several of her workout dvds.",1327622400,,496,4.904761904761905
2407368,3,B000B7QCOK,"This is not for beginners. I prefer routines with more repetition and simple moves. This was not a good cardio workout. Perhaps the younger generation would do better. Im 59, work out a lot and had trouble following. Usually Im very happy with prevention, not so much this time.",1316131200,,278,4.6938775510204085
2407369,2,B000B7QCOK,I bought this dvd with high hopes that it would be a good workout. First I should mention that I haven't had tons of experience with dancing (but my best friend has and she did this dvd with me). The instructions were unclear and Jennifer didn't seem very consistent. She never really told you how many times to do the moves and the workout looked like a bunch of moves hastily shoved together which made it really hard to remember what order to do the moves in. It wasn't very fun or motivational and I didn't really sweat much. The only part I truly liked was the ballet segment.,1301356800,,581,4.339449541284404
2407370,4,B000B7QCOK,"I checked this out from the library first to see if it was for me.  I'll admit that the first time I tried it (with my 19 year old daughter watching-bad idea)I felt a bit dumb and klutzy.
I have done Jazzercise in the past and hoped I'd catch on to the moves in this video quickly, but it has taken some persistance!
I have mastered the hip-hop segment pretty well, and I like the ballet as well.  Still working on the Latin and the Jazz, but I like a challenge and I am not the type to be too worried if I'm not doing it exactly right at first.
I think this will stay interesting and fun for a while, which is a plus-I tend to get bored with repetitive workouts, but with this one I can change things up.

I do sweat, and the cardio is pretty good!",1289865600,,749,3.98
2407381,5,B000B7QCOK,"I really enjoy this instructor's style of leading fitness dance.  I do have dance experience in my past so do know some basic moves, but was never particularly good.  What I appreciate is that Jennifer keeps moving and teaches everything to tempo.  I personally don't have issue with just bopping or marching during parts of the dance that I don't get until I later learn everything. A lot of dance exercise videos teach you complicated steps that they need to break down in 1/2 time and once you learn the steps you feel like you are wasting ""aerobic time"" by not moving quickly while the instructions go through stuff at 1/2 time every viewing.  I purchased all 3 Prevention dance videos (Also 2 Crunch ones with Jennifer after having this one) and this is the best one. Most of the moves are ones you could use on the dance floor rather than in a Broadway play. The 2nd best prevention one was&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Prevention-Fitness-Systems-Dance-Yourself-Thin/dp/B000FZETV6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Prevention Fitness Systems - Dance Yourself Thin</a>&nbsp;which does drop to 1/2 time occasionally-but usually while squatting so you feel you are still exercising at this slower pace.",1289260800,,1244,5.49738219895288
2407382,4,B000B7QCOK,"I have Hip Hop Cardio by Jennifer Galardi and this one is a toned down version of that one.  It is still a great moderate workout, I was sweating by the end of it, but I am also able to very adequately keep up with her Hip Hop Cardio and with Zumba workouts.  So this provides a nice break from the aforementioned cardio workouts.  I love Jennifer Galardi and she provides great instruction within the video so it is easy to learn and then keep up.",1276819200,2,448,4.186046511627907
2407383,4,B000B7QCOK,"After reading many of the reviews of this DVD I decided to write my own. I've had this workout for about a year and I like it. I understand some of the reviewers complaints about the choreography being to difficult to pick up on, I too had the same issues the first few times I attempted this workout. However, after a few times it really does get easier. It's broken up into four routines; hip-hop, latin, jazz and ballet which is nice, as you can pick and choose what you prefer. My personal opinion is that the hip-hop routine is the most intense, cardio wise, followed by latin, jazz and ballet (the ballet portion isn't cardio, more for toning). I suggest if you are a beginner try doing the same routine twice in a row, for example do the latin routine twice to try and pick up the steps and so on until the routines become more familiar to you.

I started out choosing two of the routines and as I got more fit I would add another routine. It's nice to have options and to change things up. The instructor is likable enough and the other dancers make you feel comfortable at any fitness level. I will say that the hip-hop routine is a little silly to me. I'm unsure of when this DVD came out, but Jennifer starts the routine by saying that we are going to do some funky and fresh moves, which makes me laugh every time I hear it, as these move are NOT fresh or funky for that matter. They are pretty dated moves, but it's still fun and the most intense of the workouts.

All and all it's a good workout and more fun than doing straight up cardio.",1266883200,3,1553,4.243243243243243
2407384,3,B000B7QCOK,"I was interested in trying this workout because I really enjoy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-Minute-Solution-Fat-Blasting-Dance-Mix/dp/B000GEIRAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10 Minute Solution: Fat Blasting Dance Mix</a>, also by Jennifer Galardi.  What I love about that workout is that the segments are fun and easy-to-follow, yet they definitely get my heart rate up, so I was hoping for the the same here.  The Main Menu of this DVD lists the following options:  Warm-Up, Hip-Hop, Latin, Jazz, Ballet, Cool-Down.  There is also a Bonus section that includes a recipe for a Health Boosting Smoothie, 5 Great Ab Shapers (instruction on 5 Pilates moves), and Rev Up Your Energy (tips on breath & posture).

The 5 1/2 minute Warm-Up was easy-to-follow, with moves like easy taps, V-steps, and triple steps, although it didn't really do much to raise my heart rate.  The Hip Hop segment was about 11 minutes long.  Of the three cardio segments, I'd rate this one as the most fun.  Galardi teaches in a manner similar to how she does in the 10 Minute Solution video--i.e., she introduces a small piece of choreography, has you practice several times, and then moves on to the next piece, gradually adding on.  However, there isn't too much ""take it from the top,"" as you only repeat the entire routine a few times through at the end.

I found the choreography for the Hip Hop segment slightly tricky but doable; unfortunately, however, I struggled even more with the Latin (10.5 mins) and Jazz (10.5 mins) segments.  The Jazz in particular was quite fast-paced, and eventually, I gave up on even trying to follow along.  The 9-minute ballet segment was nice, with traditional ballet moves such as plies, attitudes, passe, and ronde-de-jom.  However, unlike the two toning segments in 10-Minute Solution Fat Blasting Dance Mix, this section did not provide any additional aerobic benefit.  Galardi ends with a 4-minute Cool-Down for a total time of 50.5 minutes.

In summary, I was somewhat disappointed by this workout.  Although I thought Galardi did a good job, I found the choreography to be significant more complex than in her previous workout that I had tried.  And either because I was struggling to get the moves or for other reasons, I had trouble maintaining my heart rate in my target zone.  So, ultimately this workout was not a good fit for me, but it might work well for someone who is better coordinated and can more easily learn the dance moves.",1261353600,2,2506,5.130541871921182
2407385,4,B000B7QCOK,"""Prevention: Dance It Off!"" is an express workout, which means it has several 10-minute segments intended for you to do just one on a busy day or all when you have the time.  It's kind of like the ""10 Minute Solution"" series.  This is led by Jennifer Galardi who did a great job leading as always.  The 6 parts of the workout were:

Warm-Up-A little bit of Jazz choreography before leading in some plies and leg warm ups.  A really fun warm-up.  I could tell from this that the rest of the DVD would be great!

Hip-Hop-Just like Jennifer says at the end of this routine, these are some fresh moves.  I've never seen anything quite like them.  They are really unique, freestylin', and fun!  It's probably the highest cardio of all the routines, and it is really fun!

Latin-This teaches you moves from various genres of Latin dance such as the Cha-Cha, Merengue, and Salsa.  It was my favorite routine, and it did get my heart rate up.  It has a lot of twisting, but I didn't find it that hard to do on carpet.

Jazz-This routine I found the most basic of all the routines except for the ""Drama"" step.  It has a complicated rhythm change that took me a while to get used to.  Otherwise it is a pleasant mixture of familiar moves that are a lot of fun!

Ballet-This is not a routine like the other workouts, but it is rather just ballet moves taight to you one at a time.  It is not cardio, rather it is for toning, but I feel no results at all.  This is a total zero for me unless I wanted to learn basic ballet moves, and I don't.  It is not a workout at all.

Cool-Down-This is a nice mixture of stretches for the legs, but don't expect any for the arms.  You don't work out the arms that much in the routines, so it is understandable.  There is no dancing, just stretching which I loved!

This is a great workout from Prevention and Jennifer Galardi, and I would give it 5 stars if it wasn't for the ballet segment which some people will love.  I didn't, but I loved everything else there is about this DVD.",1260748800,,2009,4.251322751322752
2407386,1,B000B7QCOK,"I am a fan of Jen coz her dance routine really helps me to keep fit.
I have bought a couple from Amazon, but this one is a bit dissapointing coz I can't  play on my normal dvd or blue ray player coz it has a different code, maybe only for the US.
Since I am too lazy to return it, I have to play it on my pc... and got myself new big speakers so that I can hear the audio better.
I wished they have sent me the one that can be used with any dvd like the others.",1256256000,2,461,3.5643564356435644
2407387,1,B000B7QCOK,This is not at all what I was looking for in a dance exercise video. I gave it away and will go back to Richard Simmons. I don't know how you can produce a dance exercise video without music!,1237420800,2,191,3.923076923076923
2407388,5,B000B7QCOK,"This video is great!  It's the only workout video I've been able to stick to at home.  I see results fast.  If you like dancing, this is for you.  Although, I don't recommend this to anyone with bad knees.",1236124800,2,205,4.17948717948718
2407389,1,B000B7QCOK,"The concept of this video is good, but it just doesn't work. The steps are hard to follow. What makes this worse is that you can barely (and I mean BARELY) hear the music. There are times when I couldn't even tell there was music. So, that just makes staying in rhythm even harder. And I'm not in great shape, but I didn't find this challenging at all. Maybe it was because I spent most of my time trying to figure the moves out rather than actually doing them. Don't waste the money on this ""workout.""",1232582400,,502,4.239583333333333
2407390,2,B000B7QCOK,"I have very limited time to workout, and hoped this would be a quick, effective, FUN workout for lighter days. However, I should have listened more to the other reviewers who said the instruction is bad... it isn't just bad, it doesn't exist!!! I think the dance sequences would be fairly easy, IF they were broken down better, and there were some simple instructions as you're going along! But there really aren't, and it's hard to get a good workout when you're spending the whole time trying to figure out what the dancers on screen are doing. Honestly...don't waste your time with this one, unless you enjoy being frustrated and have plenty of spare time to learn the routines and get them down before you actually start getting a good workout!",1232409600,,748,4.717557251908397
2407401,3,B000B7QCOK,I find it very hard to keep up with this workout.  The instructor moves from one part to the next before i can catch on to the last one.  I prefer workouts that they take a little bit of extra time to show you each move before moving on to the next while you are still trying to catch on to the last one.,1225152000,,304,3.734375

It is organized into different categories: 1)Warm-up 2) Hip hop 3) Latin 4) Jazz 5) Ballet 6) Cool-down. Bonus comes with some nutritional tips, a smoothie recipe, abs exercises and stress relievers. Love the Jazz and ballet, diversified warm-up and cool down stretches. The Latin and hip hop is a bit harder but a great workout. The lighting and background on this DVD is very good. Love the variety that this offers you.",1223337600,,536,4.536082474226804

2407405,4,B000B7QCOK,"This DVD is great for those ""in-between"" workouts. If you need something different (while also low-impact and medium cardio) this is great. Jennifer Galardi is a fantastic instructor. She is fun and perky and pushes you to keep going. I tend to use the hip-hop and latin segments for a quick 20-minute cardio. The steps are quick and relatively tough to catch on. It took a few views to get the steps, so patience is key! This is not a DVD I would use everyday. It is not high cardio enough for me.",1215475200,,498,4.365591397849462
2407406,4,B000B7QCOK,"Prevention Dance It Off is approximately 51 minutes with warmup and cooldown.  Jennifer Galardi instructs and does a good job of cueing, considering how much choreography there is!  There's 4 segments beyond the warmup/cooldown:  Hip Hop, Latin, Jazz (my favorite), and Ballet.  I'm not a fan of the ballet segment, as Jennifer does not work to the beat of the music and I felt that the movements were a little too fast to be effective.  So I just skip the ballet section and go directly to the cooldown for 41 minutes total.

People with carpet will have a Heck of a time doing some of the movements...especially the latin box moves!  There's lots of twisting movements to prepare to modify (or buy some non-treaded dance shoes, which work like a charm on my low-pile carpet).  There's also a bit of impact that is easy to modify.

As I said earlier, there's lots and lots of dance moves in this one...I wasn't able to pick it all up the 1st time around, so this will be one to grow with.  And unlike a lot of dance workouts out there, my heartrate got going pretty good!

Recommend to intermediates with some dance workout experience.",1198972800,,1136,4.574257425742574
2407407,4,B000B7QCOK,"This workout was very fast paced and also very challenging. Jennifer Galardi is very upbeat, and does the moves usually just once before incorporating them into a longer piece of choreography. I treat it mostly as a workout tape, so I'm not too concerned if I don't get all the moves down 100% the first few times. I think with more time and practice, I would be able to get all the moves down. For those who are very concerned with doing the moves perfectly, perhaps some rewinding would be needed. But otherwise, this is a moderately intensive cardio dance workout, featuring jazz and pop, latin, and some ballet.",1197849600,,615,4.651376146788991
2407408,4,B000B7QCOK,"The choreography in this DVD is both interesting and challenging. That is why I gave it 4 stars, despite my frustration with the poor cuing. I find myself having a great time and wanting to do more of the workout each time I use the DVD.

I am a dancer and have been doing dance, aerobics, pilates and yoga videos for many years. Nevertheless, it took me a while to get comfortable with this DVD. The fast pace of the workout makes good cuing essential. Unfortunately, Jennifer's cues are often late or unclear. As a result, you have to rely more on your memory from the last time you did the workout, on the rhythm, or on your intuition as a dancer, to help you figure out what comes next.

I would not recommend this video for a beginner. I WOULD recommend that intermediate and advanced dancers be prepared to do shorter segments of the video the first few times in order to avoid frustration, or to ""fudge it""  a bit in order to keep pace and stay with the rhythm.

Despite this problem, I found myself loving every segment of the DVD-- including the hip hop, which I have never been interested in before. The blend of hip hop, Latin, jazz and ballet means that you are never bored. I also think the ballet segment is a great addition at the end of the DVD because it allows you to elongate your muscles after tightening them up.

If you love to dance and have plenty of experience following an instructor, you will find that your patience with this DVD pays off in the end.",1197763200,,1478,4.36

2407418,2,B000B7QCOK,"Jennifer is fun and energetic but doesn't give you enough time to pick up the steps. I'm not a very coordinated person and while I CAN get through this dvd after three weeks of every other day use, I don't enjoy it. If you can dance, then you can probably pick it up quickly.

I love Jennifer Galardi and her positive energy.  The dance routines are fun and full of energy and sure to make you sweat!  I would say that the DVD is more for a intermediate or a coordinated beginner- and remember do what you can!  You don't have to do ever move 100% right the first time!

It's perfect for anyone who doesn't have a lot of time to exercise, waiting to really get moving.  I admit she says some pretty ridiculous things, like ""it's like pulling through a window"" in the hip hop section, but I laugh at this almost every time!  I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who's seriously concerned about her workout appearance because you do look really cheesy, but I'm more than happy with my post-workout physique and the benefits to my heart.

2407422,1,B000B7QCOK,I hated this dvd!  The moves are very complicated and she doesn't give much instruction.  I felt like I needed to be a professional dancer to catch on to this.

2407424,2,B000B7QCOK,"I rented this off of NetFlix before buying it, and I'm so glad that I did! Although the dances were fun, I had trouble following a lot of the steps, and just plain couldn't do the jazz section. The workouts are shot like a music video so that sometimes the camera is not even on the instructor when she shows you new moves and you have to sort of pick up what to do. I also did not like that after each section the video went back to the main menu so that I had to keep manually programming each section to play; really took me out of my groove and interrupted the flow of my workout.

That said, the instructor really is a lot of fun and very sweet and perky (but not in an annoying way as Denise Austin can be). She encourages you to have fun and really get into the spirit of each dance. While the steps were hard to follow, I still found that I got a decent cardio workout. If you have the patience for this video and think that you can get the hang of it, then go for it. I, however, am going to keep trying out videos through NetFlix.",1172448000,10,1040,4.0

When I first watched it I cried because I thought I could never keep up, but Jennifer is so enthusiastic I kept working and in 2 weeks I am able to complete the entire 52 minutes.  I feel better physically and mentally. I will be purchasing all other fitness videos she offers.

Not enough information on the liner notes to let you know that this is not for beginners in terms of following the instructor and learning the steps.  I have taken classes and never had a problem keeping up and learning the steps; she goes too fast, does not pay attention to the music and adds-on too quickly.  I skipped through to each type of dance hoping I just couldn't get the last one, but found the next one just as frusting.  I may just go back to taking tapes out of the library to be certain before purchasing.  Wish I could return it for exchange to another fitness dvd.",1171065600,3,705,4.519685039370079
2407427,1,B000B7QCOK,"Unless you have some supernatural ability to learn dance steps by watching a room full of intensely choreographed women (of course they're doing it with no problem; they probably trained for weeks slowly and in pieces before putting this together -- a courtesy not given the viewer) operating at full speed, this one will frustrate you more than anything. I was tripping over my feet trying to move at their speed while trying to get the moves down. You may as well expect me to learn swordfighting by watching a professional fencing match.

It would be nice if they taught you the moves more slowly and then did some up to speed sets after that, so you could move through the slow section as many times as needed before actually doing the intense workout. I had to keep rewinding it and even then I only got a few of the moves clumsily down but still not enough to follow along. They throw in so many elements that it's nearly impossible to pick up.",1170806400,3,950,4.491329479768786
2407438,5,B000B7QCOK,this dvd is a great dvd if you've never taken any kinda of dance class before. the instructor breaks down all the moves and does them multiple times before you do the sequence. by the time i did this workout twice i had all the moves down and was able to up the intensity by deepening the moves. i usually do this dvd when i don't want to workout but i know i need to and the time flies by because this is a fun workout.,1169337600,,420,3.895348837209302

I wanted to throw this one in the garbage too.  The music doesn't seem to have anything to do with the rhythm of the steps, and instructor is annoying.",1168905600,4,286,4.377358490566038
2407440,3,B000B7QCOK,"The set is a boring peach/pink glowing lit walls w/a hardwood floor. Jennifer Galardi leads with 4 woman behind. There are chapter choices & the bonus includes making a smoothie drink, 3 min on posture, etc. for energy & 3 minutes of 5 of the most popular/best ab exercises.
The music was aerobic elevator type music, not inspiring at all & also low in volume. Jennifer doesn't show anything in 1/2 time, but she does break down the movements to a simplified foundation & repeated those before repeating the full move. Jennifer does cue very well & the fact she breaks it down is great. She does have a friendly, if toned down personality.
The workout's chapters:
Intro: 1 min
Warm up: 5 min. - basic torso, leg stretches, squats, etc. in increasing speed pace & basic dancing
Hip Hop: 13 min - basic elementary moves, hip twists, knee swivels, etc. pretty good moves, good ab work
Latin Dance: 10 min - a lot of cha chas, locomotion with hands, etc., many moves here felt passe
Jazz: 10 min - circa 1980s stage dancing, I didn't enjoy it at all & FFW through this portion
Ballet: 9 min. - though the movements were easy, her execution was very sloppy. She does not guide you about the importance of breath, keeping hips/spine straight & keeping abs tight which is the point of ballet. That is to have better posture, and move more gracefully w/body awareness. You do get a decent toning workout for the lower body & work on balance. The moves themselves are good choices & I liked the pace, but the point of ballet is body awareness, posture & grace which she & the dancers did not have.
Cool down: 4 min - The usual movements & stretches overall that you see on most workouts in a slow, relaxed pace.

2407442,1,B000B7QCOK,i think this dvd would be great for someone who has a lot of experience in dance. it was too hard for a beginner like me. she doesn't give enough time for the inexperienced person to get the hang of one move before she goes on to the next one. i didn't find her as annoying as some of the other reviewers did though. i think it should be stated on the cover of the dvd that this is an intermediate or advanced workout.,1156723200,11,418,3.988095238095238
2407443,1,B000B7QCOK,"There's so many reasons I didn't like this and am rabidly searching for someone, ANYONE to rid me of it before I just pitch it in the trash can.

*It's not dance. It's regular fluffy girl aerobics pretending to be dance. Boring.

*The ""instructor"" has the personality of a limp dishrag and honestly, if I heard her say ""I wanna see your personality in this girls!"" one more time... I woulda broke my TV.

*It's way too difficult to follow unless you are an aerobics maven.  I'm only slightly over weight compared to some of my friends (147 lbs at 5 ft 4 in) and I could barely get into some of the steps before Ms. Galardi was spritely bouncing into something else. So it's going to send you back to the couch with some Doritos if you're like most of us out there that would need such a DVD.

2407444,2,B000B7QCOK,"I have Jennifer's Crunch Salsa Dancing DVD, and it was my first dance exercise DVD.  I loved it so much I've been ordering a lot of others and ran across this one by the same instructor.  I find the moves too difficult and frustrating.  By the time you are close to having one step down, she's moving onto the next one, and it doesn't seem like you get to benefit from the repetitous moves that I enjoy in her Crunch video.  In that one she started out slow, repepated it several times, then did it real time, and then added another combination the same way.  The end result was putting the two combinations together, so basically repeating four moves over and over, doing about six dance routines all together, which was good enough for me.  When I do it now, I just go right to real time and ignore the slow start, so I haven't been bored at all.  She looks great in this video, but I agree with another review that they do not focus on her feet at all.  Basically I ended up watching her dance and kept marching in circles.  But if I was a good dancer, this would probably be a lot of fun.",1154995200,7,1092,4.211538461538462
2407445,1,B000B7QCOK,"I was really excited when I saw this DVD and really DEFLATED when I actually attempted to complete it!

The instructor gives relatively little if any INSTRUCTION on how to successfully complete moves; and she switches from combo to combo, move to move and it is virtually impossible to keep up.  I have also never sweated so much in my life, mostly from a rise in my blood pressure from anger and frustration!  I am in relatively good shape; I walk up to 3 miles a day and wanted this to break the routine.  In only broke my spirits!

Unless you are an accomplished club hopper or a trained hoofer, STAY AWAY!  One of the worst workouts I have ever seen!",1153353600,9,654,4.363636363636363
2407446,5,B000B7QCOK,This DVD is a great investment.  It has different types of dancing so you can choose whatever you are in the mood for when you exercise.  The routines are challenging but not impossible.  Most of all it doesn't seem like exercise.,1153008000,,230,4.560975609756097

I just excercised with this DVD for the first time and it was really tough!  I didn't get a work out at all because I was scratching my head and rewinding the thing so much.  She doesn't break down the moves at all and it's just so much more confusing than it needs to be.  The dances are cute, but it's frustrating that she doesn't explain the moves.

I don't feel like I get much of a workout either through toning or by burning calories.  Some of the dance segments may take a few times to master, but they aren't terribly complicated.

What I like is that you get to do several types of dance routines, hiphop, latin, jazz, and ballet. I am 51 years old and have no problem keeping up with these gals (however, I have been working out and exercising for many years).  Give yourself a few times through the dances before expecting to know the routines, but then you will find them fun and a nice workout and you will be amazed at how nice your body shapes up from dancing.  If you don't have time to do the whole routine you can always just choose a dance or two.  I like to do them just for fun and get rid of stress of the day.",1151280000,,692,4.0661764705882355
2407460,1,B000B7QCOK,"My friend is trying to get in shape and recently bought this video. She invited me to do it with her. I have a background in dance and so it was a shock to me when certain aspect of proper alignment  and placement were never stressed in this video. I even told me friend not to do one of the stretches at the end, because she could hurt her knees. Incorrect technique and alignment can be very dangerous and if repeated day after day can lead to overuse injuries. The moves were not broken down enough and I only picked them up because I am already familiar with them. The music was so subtle that it was really hard to dance to it. I was not a big fan of the choreography.

If you are new to dance, I would suggest starting with another video. I don't know what video to recommend because I generally don't use videos to work out. If you aren't new to dance then this video might be less than desirable.",1149120000,12,904,4.16
2407461,1,B000B7QCOK,"I was frustrated by this DVD. This DVD is not typical of the Prevention series. The instructor went through the steps too fast and did not explain the techniques well enough while she launched right into well rehearsed routines with her students. This was about her having fun with her students, not teaching the viewer the dance steps.

The cameraperson felt it wasn't necessary to show the dancer's feet for several critical dance steps.

By the time the instructor got to the slower less complicated dances, I completely lost interest. This is the first exercise DVD I threw away because to me it is useless.",1148688000,13,611,4.809523809523809
2407462,5,B000B7QCOK,"This is one of my favorite Cardio Dance workouts.  Not only do I get a good sweat out of it, but I really do have fun while dancing to it.  I also have the Crunch Cardio dance with the same instructor (Jennifer) but I like this one better.

However, this workout may still not be for everyone.  I have dance experience and have tried many types of classes and dvds out there (dance, step classes, boxing, pilates, yoga, etc.) but it still took me two/three times to be able to follow up to speed with everything.  But once I picked it up, I really do enjoy it!

My suggestion is that if you are pretty active or you have a good sense of rhythm, then you will have no trouble with this one and soon be having fun!

However, if you are not too active, needs moves to be taught repetitiously and break down slowly, then you may have trouble following along; and consequently feel tempted to quit or give up on it early.

My suggestion of doing this (and other cardio dance dvds): watch it thorough once; you'll get a sense which part is tough for you and which part the foot work seems tricky.

ALWAYS Resist the temptation to put in the hands movements until you really know your foot works.  I know it looks good with the hand movements, but trust me, after they add the hand movements they will often change the footwork and you might get thrown off.  This is why some people feel a particular DVD is too hard or they lose interest.

The good thing about this DVD is that it is divided into different categories of Dance.

- The Hip-Hop section is more funky and rap style; with moves that bop up and down a lot.

-  The Latin dance is really fun with cha cha moves. It may look complicated to beginners only because the instructor is swaying more; by turning and twisting her hips a lot.  For beginners, don't worry about having to move the hips too much.  Just follow along and once you have more experience and feel more comfortable, you'll be able to add the sway of your hips to it too.

- For the Jazz section, it is like a choreographed MTV session of sort.  This section is a trickier one;  but so much fun once you can get it.  If you just avoid the temptation to add in hands movements too soon, it's easier.

-  And for the Ballet, it is mainly stretches with kicks and more of a balancing thing.  I see this part as more of a cool-down rather than a cardio segment.

Like most dvds, this one lacks a good warmup.  My suggestion;  I always play the Cool-Down segment first before doing the warm up segment.  There are more stretching moves in the Cool-Down section and I feel more properly warmed up.

This is a Fun dvd to do;  if you want to get a good sweat out of it, really get into dancing it out; twisting and moving your hips in the latin section, and getting low with doing the hip-hop....you'll be sweating and having fun all at the same time!",1147737600,39,2863,4.257884972170687
2407463,4,B000B7QCOK,"This is a great workout and alot of fun. You are definitely

sweating by the time you are finished. Also the time goes by

very quickly. I gave it 4 stars, because the steps do change

quickly and they don't give you alot of time to figure them out.

I really like to dance, so I found this fun and challenging.

It does help if you are familier with some of the dance terms,

These are not geared for the generation who learned ""The Jerk"", ""The Twist"", and ""The Stomp"". The pace is too fast and the moves too complicated for beginners. Latin Salsa, jazz, ballet and hip-hop dance moves are perhaps do-able for mid-lifers if you were former cheerleaders or you had extensive dance training at a young age. I was and had neither.  The video is not geared for those of us who suffer, even mildly, from arthritic knees and hips. Once I reached the hip-hop stage on the video, I cried uncle. In addition, the perky little gal with the great bod leading the video just made me want to eat more cookies. I guess Richard Simmons does fill a nitch for gals like me.
