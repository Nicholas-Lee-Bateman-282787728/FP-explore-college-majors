391289,5,6301903242,"In his speech accepting the BAFTA (the English ""Oscar"") for his performance in THE REVENANT, Leonardo Dicaprio paid tribute to the debt owed by his generation of American actors to the generation of British actors spearheaded by Gary Oldman's performance in STATE OF GRACE. This film is a true classic. From the incredible performances of Oldman, Sean Penn, Ed Harris, Robin Wright, Burgess Meredith, John Turturro, Joe Vitarelli, and John C. Reilly; the masterful cinematography of the late Jordan  Cronenweth (BLADE RUNNER); to the remarkable score composed by the Maestro, Ennio Morricone, STATE OF GRACE delivers an amazing evocation of the New York's Hell's Kitchen during the reign of the Irish Mob, The Westies. The location photography captures a time, a place and a feeling that has vanished. This is destined to be an addition to your list of favorite movies.",1493683200,,869,5.163120567375887

391295,4,6301903242,".This is a fine gangster film made my Phil Joanou. For me he is not all new since I saw his other film <Final Analysis> long time ago.
I actually saw the film twice. First time it was a long time ago and I liked it. And the second time was quite recent and I think it's because the second time was after I saw Basic Instict, I didn't liked the movie Final,.. at all since there's a lot of common between two and the Final,.. has not much impact then the Basic,.. movie.
Anyway, State of Grace has similar story with DEPARTED and Hong Kong film INFERNAL AFFAIRS TRILOGY. But this film is rather simple.
Sean Penn comes back to his neighbor and meets his old friend Garry Oldman. Garry is working with his brother Ed Harris. Seaon Penn is actually an undercover cop. After he sees Ed killing his own brother Garry, he was pissed off and gave up his position and revenge his friend's death.
There are wonderful moments between Sean, Garry and Ed. That is the beauty of this film. Three of them are great actors as we all know and even the fact that the director casted the tree is the already success.
Robin Wright who loved Sean Penn was charming and did her part well.
The movie shows the dark side of the city pretty well and the three actors are to be remebered in somehow.
Sean Penn is always truethful for his roll and in this film he was not an exception. He did his roll really well. He was a guy who is not confident whether he is a cop or a gangster, don't know exactly what to do kind of guy.
Garry is a drunk who has some kind of mental problem who needs some care. He did a fine job too. He sometimes act a little too far but this time he didn't.
Ad was kind of scary, a bose, a big guy who rules the whole thing, no mercy typle.
Especially the last revenge scene was to be remembered.
When three of them meet, the movie become truely a good one.
You should watch this film in no condition.",1456012800,,1900,4.1378378378378375

391344,5,6301903242,"A movie with Ed Harris, Gary Oldman (probably my pick for the finest contemporary actor) and Sean Penn is simply going to be a great movie no matter what the story entails.  This movie has an excellent story, which is what gets me going with rating movies.  Ed Harris is his usual excellent self, so convincing as the completely dislikeable ""trying to move up the ladder"" small scale crime boss. By the end of the movie, you want to just stick your arm through the screen and strangle him.  He is willing to do whatever it takes (as dictated by someone farther up the food chain in the mafia) to advance, including commit homicide within his own inner family circle.  This does not, however, sit well with the character played by Sean Penn, who secretly witnesses it after failing to get backup using the pay phone (this is before wireless was ubiquitous, for you younger folks), and finds something incriminating at the scene.  Thereafter, there is a nice scene at the funeral home; let's just leave it at that.  If you are not on the edge of your seat after that scene, please check into a medical clinic and have them confirm you have a pulse.

I won't spoil the movie for those who have not seen it, but suffice it to say that Ed Harris almost singlehandedly builds tension with his character all the way to the end.

Gary Oldman has done a terrific job with a role he was born to play, a person of questionable mental constitution.  If you saw him as DEA Agent Stansfield in The Professional (the role that put him on the map as far as top notch actors), you know what I am talking about.  Sean Penn is the perfect undercover cop.  Nervous, anxious, angry.  The ending was full of tension and terrific.  I can watch this movie over and over because there are events in it that continue to trigger emotional reactions that get my blood boiling and then there are events that provide emotional relief.  The parade scene builds the tension for the most gratifying ending in the pub.  If you love any of these actors, you want this movie in your collection.",1434499200,,2058,4.494623655913978

SYNOPSIS--
An outstanding cast and a script that includes incidents adapted from actual mobster courtroom testimony highlight this neo-noir about a Hell's Kitchen returnee (Penn) who's now a cop charged with infiltrating the Irish gang run by his best friend's older brother (Harris). Oldman is exceptional as the hard-drinking psycho buddy, yet Penn's ""tortured soul"" performance as traitor to his friends is the heart of the story.

To discuss the flaws of this over-rated film are numerous but basically the story seems to be too unfocused and the performances, particularly Gary Oldman, are over the top.  Penn is adequate at best but the romantic sub-plot between him and Robin Wright never seems to jell thanks to the writing and direction and the denouement which seems to be lifted from an inferior Peckingpah film is outrageous---maybe they didn't know how to end this mess.

Soon, however, Terry is torn between his loyalty to his friends and his loyalties to others. ""State of Grace"" has all the violence, foul language and hot-headed characters that are part and parcel of this sort of movie, but at its core is a very well worked plot, bolstered by some great characterisation. The characters are the main focus point in this movie, and it's through their motivations that the plot is allowed to move. A movie that puts so much focus on its characters needs a strong cast in order to work, and this movie certainly has that. Sean Penn is marvelous. The music and atmosphere combine with the shockingly realistic violence to ensure that the movie is always gritty and unrelenting.

This movie also has a lot of similarities with The Departed. I am surprised few have noted the similarities:

*The Irish Mob.
*The demented Irish Mob ""Godfather,"" played by Ed Harris.
*The undercover cop who was affiliated with the gang, left, became an officer, went undercover, and then returned.

The entire cast is brilliant, aided by a magnificent script and artistic editing and framing. Gary Oldman stands out above the rest, transforming his character from volatile to charming to sympathetic with talent and an ugly honesty that makes for a captivating performance (or is he performing at all? is he just *being*? I can't find the seams in Oldman's work that separate him from the characters he portrays). I couldn't see a bad actor in the bunch, though, and Robin Wright is absolutely magnificent as the conflicted Kathleen, the sister of Jackie (Oldman) and Freddie (Ed Harris).

He just has so much personality that you HAVE to love him! (Not to mention, ladies, he is nice to look at). If you have seen Gary in ""The Professional"", I could almost say that Jackie Flannery and Norman Stansfield could be cousins or related in some way (even though they are different types of crazy).

391495,2,6301903242,"Predictable and unbeleivable, to say the least.  Ed Harris is not convincing as a mafia boss, and this makes the relationships between his cohorts, particularly Oldman, less than convincing as well.

Oldman's like a pot ready to boil, and while ridiculously unbelevable in his relationship to the boss (Ed Harris), his relationship with Sean Penn's character works and impresses even, at times.  Like a seething volcano, Oldman is totally out of control.  It's this intensity, I think, that makes it hard to beleive that he'd be taking orders from Harris.  And when he does, well, there's your problem.  Another good example of how unbeleivable this story plays out is Oldman's total cluelessness in relation to certain unfortunate events at the end of the movie.  These are mob guys?

The movie, while dragging somewhat mid-way, picks up momentum again for a while near the end, but kind of peters out again after that in a final cloud of melodramatic cliche scenes and acting with the help of John Turturro, the girlfriend, and Sean Penn himself.  Maybe this movie suffered from too many big name actors.

Don't buy this movie.  It becomes Grade A cheddar by the end.  For a much better old Sean Penn movie (with Christopher Walken), check out ""At Close Range"".",1200268800,,1263,4.90566037735849
391496,4,6301903242,"At the outset, I will concede that I've never been really big on mob movies.  They're OK I guess, but they've never been at the top of my list of favorite genres.  That said, this is one of my favorite mob movies of the limited number of mob films I've seen in my life.

Sean Penn portrays a Boston police officer [Terry] who is called back to his hometown of New York City to assist with an NYPD Special Investigations Unit.  More specifically, he is asked to go undercover in the Irish quadrant of the city, known as the Hell's Kitchen.

He is given the task of spying on his old friends of the Flannery clan.  Ed Harris plays Frankie Flannery, the head of an Irish mob outfit in the Kitchen.  Gary Oldman plays Jackie Flannery, Frankie's impulsive, violence-prone loose cannon of a brother.

Robin Wright Penn portrays Kate, the sister of the Flannery brothers.  She is most well known for being Sean Penn's wife (although I'm unsure whether they were married yet when this film was made) and for starring in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Princess-Bride-Special-Edition/dp/B00005LOKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Princess Bride (Special Edition)</a>.  Kate has always done her best to escape the life of being the sister to criminals, but feels that with Terry's return she is being sucked back into the affairs of the Kitchen.

All through the storyline, there are hints that the Irish mob used to be far more powerful & autonomous than it is these days.  Also, the Hell's Kitchen was much more ""pure"" Irish, but over time the percentage of Irishmen in the Kitchen has declined, and the Irish mob's power has eroded along with this decline.  So much as changed, in fact, that Flannery's outfit these days is the mob world's equivalent of a ""subcontractor"" to an Italian mob outfit.  This, of course, sparks all sorts of resentment and minor turf battles that have the propensity of churning out tragic outcomes.

As a sidenote, in this story Ed Harris & Gary Oldman play brothers.  They would both go on to individually portray the great composer Ludwig van Beethoven.  Oldman plays the musician in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Immortal-Beloved/dp/B00000K3TN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Immortal Beloved</a>&nbsp;while Harris plays Beethoven in the recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Copying-Beethoven/dp/B000MV8AE0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Copying Beethoven</a>.  That both actors can play in a mob movie and turn around & play the same historical figure (very well on both accounts, I may add!) is a testimony to the acting prowess of both.

The present film is directed by Philip Jounou, who also directed U2's film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/U2-Rattle-and-Hum/dp/B000022TT6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">U2 - Rattle and Hum</a>.  John Turtorro frequently shows up in mob movies, and in this one he is a cop instead of a mobster.  One can't question the competency of the cast overall as it is top-notch.  If you like mob movies at all, or if you have a single drop of Irish blood in your veins, then I would highly recommend this film.  If neither of the above applies to you, I still this film would be worth a viewing.",1198108800,3,3318,5.578842315369261
391497,5,6301903242,"I saw this film a good six years ago and the gritty, ugly, and tortured atmosphere has never left my mind; Gary Oldman's perfomance as Jackie Noonan, Irish mob psychopath, transcends a lot of what he has done since.
Who can forget when he innocently pulls out a severed finger from his icebox, laughing like a child, and shows it to his shocked and horrified brother, Terry? (Sean Penn). Or the beautifully stereotypical ending set on St. Patrick's  Day?

This story of a quickly fading Irish mob family is one of psychopathic codependence, betrayal, and redemption through vengeance.  Ed Harris is absolutely despicable, the type of character you want to reach into the screen and strangle, as the treacherous and self-interested head of the family, Frankie Noonan.  Jackie's murder at his hands (as an appeasement to the more powerful local mob) is like watching a demented but innocent toddler go to his death at the hands of his parent.

Momentarily Burgess Meredith, as a broke old Irish apartment holder named Finnn, sorta reprises his role as Mick in a way (no pun intended); he screams at Terry (Sean Penn) in much the same way way he went roids on Sylvester Stallone.  Only Terry's not dumb.

Terry takes care of business in the end, ditching his role as undercover cop and using street justice to avenge Jackie's death.  This is the worst St. Patrick's Day you've ever seen; not one person is without a firearm in hand, beer, and fashionably worn leather jacket.  A great mood piece.",1189468800,2,1493,4.80078125

391502,5,6301903242,"While I was reviewing State Of Grace, I was debating whether to give it 4 or 5 stars. Despite the movie's mild reception at the box office and the little credibility it gets today, I realized that it actually is a classic nontheless. First of all, the movie sparked excellent performances by the entire cast, including Sean Penn (Fast Times At Ridgemont High), Ed Harris (The Truman Show), Gary Oldman (JFK), Robin Wright (Forrest Gump), John C. Reilly (The Aviator), John Turturro (Do The Right Thing), R.D. Call (Young Guns II), and Burgess Meredith (Rocky). Secondly, the movie's storyline and script, although familiar, are epical in their own right.

State Of Grace is about an undercover cop named Terry Noonan, played by Penn, who is assigned by his superior officer Nick, played by Turturro, to infiltrate a New York City Irish gang led by the sadistically merciless Frankie Flannery, played by Harris, and his crazy hard-drinking brother Jackie, played remarkably by the scene-stealing Oldman. Both Flannerys used to be Terry's close friends before he escaped their life of crime to Boston to join law enforcement. Terry will have to crack down on his friends and in the process risk being uncovered, as well as losing the loyalty of Jackie, who he loves like a brother, and the love of the Flannery sister Kathleen, played by Penn's future wife Wright.

The movie was released in the fall of 1990 and was overshadowed by another gangster movie that earned Academy Awards; that movie, of course, was Martin Scorsese's brilliant Goodfellas. But State Of Grace, with or without awards, remains to be a powerful gangster movie that shines thanks to the sincerity of an all-star cast.

391538,5,6301903242,"Phil Joanou had an incredible palette of talent to work with in creating this dark and troublesome work of art. Even the lesser parts are filled with personalities such as John Turturro, Robin Wright (then without the Penn), RD Call, John C. Reilly and Burgess Meredith. The score composed by Ennio Morricone has a haunting, eerie saunter, infected with an obvious full note that jerks you out of its hypnotic trance. Watching this film in 2005 takes one back to a number of other great and powerful films of the early 90's that used the noir anti-heroes as their central character. Comparing State of Grace to Abel Ferrara pieces such as Bad Lieutenant and King of New York would not be far-fetched.
Penn's performance as Terry is wrought with inner turmoil, culminating in his bedside confession to Wright's Kathleen. While explaining Hell's Kitchen and it's irk to Turturro he wanes ""we're Irish, all we know how to do is drink,"" a telling testimony that typifies the culture soon to be taken over by the newly christened Clinton inner-city development. His inward reflection is mirrored by the exuberance of Jackie, played with perfection by Oldman. With his cavalier swagger he seems to lack the part of the genetic code that relays fear. Jackie takes risk to new levels while seriously jeopardizing older brother Frankie's (Harris) plans to form an alliance with elements of the Italian mob. Harris's taught composure throughout the film is a fine study in character definition; a true Jeckyl and Hyde persona, playing the suburban family man by day, and slitting the throats of childhood friends by night.
We've seen little in the form of feature offerings from Joanou, aside from U2's Rattle and Hum and Heaven's Prisoners. It is interesting to note his continuing contribution to U2's music video collection, as well as a number of TV commercials. His close association with the mega band lent a big break in acquiring music rights for his 2000 production Entropy.",1117670400,16,1973,4.9637462235649545

Of course, Gary Oldman is fabulous. When is that not the case? He is so charismatic that I sometimes cannot take my eyes off of him, even when he is not the central character in the scene. Of course, Ed Harris really makes you hate him in this movie, which, in my opinion, is a sign of a really great actor. This film is highly engrossing and entertainig. Give it a view.

391544,3,6301903242,"State of Grace is a good movie with great actors.  The film follows a conventional storyline but is ""buoyed up"" by the novelty of the subject, the Irish Mob.  About half way through the movie, the various characters start to interact in interesting ways, and the film acquires a momentum that it keeps until the end.
Unfortunately, none of the characters seems sufficiently developed to draw the viewer completely into the turmoil that is unfolding on the screen.  Terry is the most complex character portrayed, but ultimately, at the end of the movie, I didn't really care what happened to Terry or his girlfriend, Kathleen.  For me, becoming involved in a character's experience on screen is what separates adequate films from great films.
I give State of Grave three and a half stars.  State of Grace is no Goodfellas, but watch it for compelling performances by Sean Penn and Gary Oldman, for the unique subject matter and for some fun action sequences.  However, if you want to be inspired, or devastated, or watch a movie that conveys broader themes than what is happening physically on screen, I would recommend watching something else.  This movie is a snapshot into a world, nothing more, nothing less.  It left me with a vague feeling of emptiness and I won't be adding State of Grace to my DVD library anytime soon.",1079740800,,1326,4.81057268722467
391585,5,6301903242,"Terry Noonan (Sean Penn) returns to Hell's Kitchen after a ten year absence. He immediately falls back in with his childhood friend Jackie ( Gary Oldman), whose brother Frankie ( Ed Harris)is now running a powerful Irish mob. Frankie's organization is looking to make a deal with the Italian Mafia, and Jackie wants Terry brought in to make things run smoother. Unfortunately, Terry is also an undercover cop, and his sole purpose for coming back is to infiltrate Frankie's organization. Things become even more complicated, when Terry manages to rekindle an old romance with Jackie's sister Kathleen (Robin Wright). Now Terry is torn between his job, and remaining loyal to his friends and the woman he loves.
When people bring up the subject of mob films, State of Grace is never mentioned. The story behind the film is very captivating because it shows the fine line between standing by your friends, and doing what's right. The film does a very good job at masking Terry Noonan's intentions because you can never tell which side he is truly playing for. State of Grace is an original in the mob genre because it offers a look at the Irish mob, instead of the Italians. The Irish are natural born fighters and extremely violent. This is what made State of Grace such a powerful mob film. The cast is first rate in this film featuring Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Robin Wright, John C. Reily, and John Turturo. Each actor involved was brilliant in their roles.
Overall, State of Grace is probably one of the best mob films I have ever seen, and one of the most underrated films ever made. The story was captivating from beginning to end, the entire cast did a first rate job, and you get to take a first hand look at the Irish mob.

391586,3,6301903242,"*** 1/2 stars rating for this film. ""State Of Grace"" is not a copy of ""The Godfather"" or ""GoodFellas"", it's a story about a second-rated group of gangsters that are trying to gain respect and territory in New York. The first thing that you can notice in ""State Of Grace"" is the cast: Sean Penn, Gary Oldman, Ed Harris, Robin Wright, John C. Reilly and John Turturro, among others.

 In Hollywood there are three actors that can portray over-the-top villains, and still be believable and threatening. One of them is Gary Oldman, in a very convincing performance. The other two guys are Christopher Walken and Dennis Hopper, but the role in ""State Of Grace"" was perfect for Gary Oldman.

 ""State Of Grace"" is a movie that never is boring, these anti-heroes are so well portrayed by the cast, that the characters have a very human quality, they are very complex and multidimensional characters, and as a result, the audience is always interested in them. The biggest selling point of ""State Of Grace"" is the fact that the film never tries to imitate ""The Godfather"", and that originality is welcome.",1076371200,5,1096,4.783068783068783
391587,4,6301903242,"I first seen this movie soon after it was released (VHS) and was very impressed considering most people hadn't heard of it. It was refreashing to see a director who finally wanted to make a movie about the Irish Mob, who afterall were the longest established organised crime group in NY. I strongly disagree with a reviewer from Medford, NY who described Oldman's character as somewhat over the top. In my opinion, this is Oldman's finest performance to date! Having read many books on the Westside Irish Mob (as they refered to themselves) including The Westies by T.J English, Oldman brought the real life character Mickey Featherstone to life on our screens in Oscar style fashion! Believe me , these characters are not your average Italian style gangster; slick-back hair, well dressed killers. Most of these men had no such delusions of grandeuer when it came to how they looked. Many were hard drinking heroin addicts who if hadn't been shot, would have killed themselves anyway! These story lines have a much harder edge than your average Italian/Jewish gangster film because of a notorious drug and drinking culture that the other two etnic crime groups considered to be sloppy and unprofessional. Other films such as Southie have tackled these issues also, portraying a family from the projects coming to terms with alcoholism, drug abuse and gun culture. Don't get me wrong, I love Goodfellas and The Godfather but you have to admit, you won't beat the Irish when it comes to telling a story with typically unique ingredients. Jonau, indeed, could have been far more brutal in his portrayal of these men. Storys of a victem's head being taken on a pub crawl of the westside are now legendary. Ed Harris and Sean Penn turn in fantastic performances also, but Gary Oldman steals the show. I couldn't believe it when I found out shortly after watching the movie that Oldman is infact English. His portrayal of what is generally accepted to be Mickey Featherstone, is awsome! Those of you used to your typical Italian gangster movie be prepared for a crash landing into the world of psycotic, alcoholic, drug addicted killers! No dyed hair and flashy suits here!

391588,2,6301903242,"Unfortunately, this film is no lost classic. It comes off as completely routine, adding absolutely nothing to an already (by 1990) saturated genre niche (the New York gangster 'slice of life'). Indeed, 'State of Grace's only viable claim to fame is that it is mainstream film which added a third ethnic type to its contemporary Italian and Jewish mob 'vogue' templates set by 'The Godfather' films, especially Part 3 (also 1990), 'Goodfella's' (uhh 1990) and 'Once Upon a Time in America'(1984). Phil Jaonou, the director who's previous credits included a rather mediocre U2 concert, was up against a deep-set tapestry of myth created by Coppola, Leone and Scorcese: it was inevitable that this film was going to flounder, and it did.
Good mood piece, though. Excellent performances by the central figures (especially Gary Oldman at a time before his rent-a-villain slump set a bourgeoning career into doldrum territory). Any film with an Ennio Morricone score can't be that bad, right? One niggle: when are American filmmakers going to stop exploiting and start debunking that obviously romanticised New York epicentred 'Good ole Oirish, Beggorah!!' myth.

Years pass and now the only person the cops can send in to bring down these gangsters is Penn. Whoa! But the director pulls it off with flying colors. Penn's character Terry agonizes over having to bring down his childhood friend Jackie (Oldman) but eventually agrees to go in deep undercover to bust his brother Irish mob boss Frankie (Harris). Terry finds himself back in his old neighborhood and as comfortable as ever with his long lost pal Jackie. Terry walks the razors edge of being the law and breaking the law to get his job done. But, in the end Terry knows that this isn't a matter of law and order but a matter of right and wrong in it's purest sense.

391638,5,6301903242,"It's unfortunate that this movie received so little marketing and went largely unnoticed.  First off, amazing cast.  Sean Penn, Ed Harris, Gary Oldman, Robin Wright, and John Turturro star in this movie.
Sean Penn gives one his best performances as Terry Noonan, who goes undercover into New York's Irish mob.  He was selected because his childhood friend, Jackie (Oldman), is one of the top Lieutenants, and Jack's older brother Frankie (Harris) is the boss.  Noonan quickly becomes encompassed in a life he had forgotten, and falls back in love with Frankie & Jackie's younger sister Kathleen (Wright), who is trying to get away from the life her brothers have chosen.  Turturro plays the cop/mentor for Terry who has to try and convince he's doing the right thing.
When Frankie has another childhood friend (John C Reilly) killed, Terry has to figure a way to take Frankie down, but is conflicted due to his love for Jackie and Kathleen.  I won't spoil the rest, but that's a synopsis of what the movie is about.  It's about love, hate, betrayal, and revenge.
Penn gives a remarkable performance as the conflicted cop (similar to Donnie Brasco), and Oldman plays a bad guy that everyone loves.  Harris plays the role of a cold, ruthless mob boss with perfection.  Wright & Turturro give above average performances as co-stars, and the remaining actors are well cast.
To sum it all up, one of the best Organized Crime movies of all time and starring 4 men who have been nominated for Academy Awards.  Above average plot, great cinematography, brilliant acting, and a very original ending, make this movie a must for all mob movie fans, and recommendation to all others.",1032480000,3,1671,4.872791519434629
391639,5,6301903242,"It's really about conflict resolution - how one person resolves his personal conflicts (his internal angst over betrayal of others, betrayal of his own beliefs and the validity of those beliefs), his conflicts with others (the external action) and, to some degree, his conflict with God (that's the whole point of Terry's/Penn's discussion regarding grace and the quality or state of it) because you see him struggling with and trying to reconcile what he's sworn to do vs. the ethical/moral implications of his actions filtered through his own spiritual/religious beliefs.  What man would have him do to his ""brother"" violates what God would supposedly have him do as a Christian/Catholic.  It's a brilliant character study, and not just of Terry, but also Jack - Gary Oldman's character.  Jack is the perfect foil for Terry, and in some ways,  is more deserving of viewer sympathy.
A final note, the film is beautifully shot - so why isn't it on DVD yet?",1029369600,,956,4.95625

like ""GOODFELLAS"" ""MILLER'S CROSSING"" But did not recieve much
attention and it's a shame because it's a great film. Sean Penn

himself in over his head becoming what he fears most a Irish

391641,4,6301903242,"...up to and maybe including walk on water? Oldman is so utterly and completely Jackie Flannery in this film, you might be tempted to dismiss his performance as 'playing to type'. Until you see this inspired chameleon's other work, where he IS Lee Harvey Oswald or TRUE ROMANCE's Drexl or Joe Orton or - tell you what, YOU pick the role: Oldman inhales, and the character he's portraying exhales. (And this is not to shortshrift the fine work offered by Penn, Harris, Wright, Reilly and the rest of this film's ensemble.) It's disgraceful that Hollywood can't think of anything better to do with this brilliant and courageous actor these days than 'villain roles' in big-budget comic books like LOST IN SPACE & THE CONTENDER, but when he's working with material commensurate to his skill, he's without peer. When an actor pushes himself like this, takes risks like this, you become aware that there can be no nobler profession. Gary Oldman may not be 'box office', and now and then he may even crash and burn...but when he flies, he soars higher than any performer presently working. For Pete's sake, see this movie and everything else he's done.",1004140800,3,1146,4.822335025380711

391675,5,6301903242,"With a fine screenplay, a great musical score by Ennio Morricone, artful direction by Spielberg protege' Phil Joanou, and a truly awesome cast, State of Grace is one of the best gangster films ever for a number of reasons. Mainly, we have a plot that is captivating with characters that truly radiate off the screen. It revolves around the life of Terry Noonan (brilliantly played by Sean Penn), a true Irishman who returns from God knows where to his old neighborhood, the New York area that the primarily Irish inhabitants have affectionately named ""Hell's Kitchen"". He comes back to his best friends, the good-natured but hopelessly crazy Jackie Flannery (The great Gary Oldman in what is possibly his best performance) and the sweet but dumb Stevie (The also excellent John C. Reilly), his old hot/cold love Kate Flannery (Robin Wright, before she was Robin Wright-Penn), and the Irish mob that he left behind, now led by Frankie Flannery, brother to Jackie and Kate (played in a icy and explosive performance by Ed Harris). Frankie is trying to make a deal with the nearby Italian mob (led by Paul Vitterelli, before he became a more comedic mobster), and the tensions are running high when Frankie is called upon to betray his own people for the Italians, and Terry is forced to betray his people for an entirely different reason. Make no mistake: This is a VERY Irish tale. They drink, fight, scream, smoke, beat, shoot, stab, cry, puke, lust, kill and they do it all like it's going out of style. Do yourself a favor and continue to watch ""The Quiet Man"" on St. Patty's Day, but check this film out regardless. It will blow you away.",986169600,3,1641,4.741258741258742
391676,4,6301903242,"This film is an awesome reflection of the struggle to identify right and wrong.  When among friends, the definition of right and wrong becomes very gray.  In many ways, Penn's character is wrong in the betrayal of his friends.  This film has a few twists, but generally, the plot is straightforward.  If people like the humanity of the Sopranos, I think they will like this film.  I think the reason this film did poorly in the theaters was due to the struggle that Penn was having with Madonna (the failed marriage) and the press at the time of its release.  Penn could be a real jerk but so can the press.  I still watch this film over and over again and it never gets boring.  With all of the stars in this film, I am surprised it has not seen some kind of renaissance.",981676800,,772,4.3125
391677,4,6301903242,"State of Grace is a great movie. I don't know why it's not more popular. It's got great directing,dialogue,action,atmosphere and Sean Penn,Ed Harris & Gary Oldman all give the best performances of their careers. And there's lots of swearing and bloody violence. All the things a good gangster film should have. State Of Grace tells the tale of the Irish mafia in New York. Cop Terry(Penn) returns to NY and is thorn between his loyalties for his old gangster buddies,Frankie(Harris) & Jackie Flannery (Oldman),and his duties as a policeman. After the likes of The Godfather & Goodfellas,it's refreshing to see another ethnic group of gangsters rather than Italians,in this instance,the Irish. Oldman gives an amazing portrayal as the crazy,hard-drinking hood Jackie but I my favourite character in the movie is Harris' evil henchman. He's just such a cool character. The fine cast also includes Robin Wright Penn,John Turturro and John C.Reilly. I'd like State of Grace to come out on DVD soon.",976320000,6,994,5.1419753086419755
