3421921,5,B0018YGDUI,This is an awesome DVD! Well worth the wait from the first Dana Carvey Special that is included! It's 2 DVD's all in one!!!,1222128000,,123,4.166666666666667
3421922,2,B0018YGDUI,"I used to love Dana Carvey.  His cast (1989-92) was the strongest, most talented cast ever on SNL (I know, it's sacrilege to not say the original cast, but you know that it's true).  While he may still be good at sketch comedy, he absolutely stinks at stand up.  This whole concert was taxing and unfunny.  I really felt bad for the guy the way the audience was half-heartedly laughing for the benefit of the cameras.  Terrible.",1219017600,3,428,4.5064935064935066
3421923,5,B0018YGDUI,More like a pain in the stomach from laughing so hard.  Includes the guitar player bit also.  Incredibly funny.,1218758400,2,111,4.7894736842105265
3421924,5,B0018YGDUI,"I love Dana Carvey!  I just finished watching this on HBO tonight.  He is amazing at vocal impersonations and in this show he runs through most of the major political figures of current events:  Bill and Hillary, Obama, Arnold, Al Gore and others.  Even his parents aren't safe.  I laughed so hard!  A must see and a must buy.  This DVD can't come out soon enough for me!",1213833600,16,371,4.367647058823529
3421935,5,B0018YGDUI,"I've always been a big Dana Carvey fan, and this lived up to expectations!  Many good laughts",1422921600,,93,4.470588235294118
3421936,5,B0018YGDUI,Hilarious! One of my favorite stand up comics. Shipping was fast!,1420243200,,65,5.0
3421937,5,B0018YGDUI,"Outside of some rather crude remarks, this DVD is brilliant. It's Dana Carvey at his best. Wish he had more that were as good as this one.",1407456000,,138,4.148148148148148
3421938,5,B0018YGDUI,"We absolutely love Dana Carvey and would recommend that everyone see this DVD and if you get a chance, go see this wonderful comedian in person.",1405468800,,144,4.576923076923077
3421939,5,B0018YGDUI,"Great seller, great product.",1404259200,,28,6.25
3421940,5,B0018YGDUI,"Great stand up routine.  Extra bonus, you get his older HBO standup routine on a separate DVD with this new one.  Both are hillarious and pretty clean if you have kids around.  LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1380758400,,198,4.764705882352941
3421941,5,B0018YGDUI,We love the Reagan Oracle bit! We laughed so hard we cried! Dana is great with the voices!  Bravo Dana!,1369353600,,103,4.15
3421942,5,B0018YGDUI,I got this for the one stand up I've been wanting to watch and own on DVD for a long time and it being 2 disc special was an added bonus for me.,1366329600,,144,3.393939393939394
3421943,4,B0018YGDUI,"I would give it 5 stars but I'd be dishonest cuz it comes with Dana's 1st stand up show. Now thats cool but it was not as funny as Squatting Monkeys,and yes I did laugh a couple of times but it was not gut busting. Its a must have even if you never heard of Dana Carvey. And who knows...You might like his bonus Critics Choice stand up show more than I did and I hope you do!!!!!!",1363046400,,380,3.8846153846153846
3421944,5,B0018YGDUI,Dana Carvey is a very funny comedian. He does not have to put any efforts to make you laugh. The jokes are really quick well written and very entertaining. He covers many topics and yet hard not to laugh. I recommend any Dana Carvey DVDs or Movies..,1362787200,,249,4.319148936170213
3421945,4,B0018YGDUI,"This is a great stand up and will most definitely make you laugh, but sometimes his jokes are just plain stupid to understand lol",1361664000,,129,4.416666666666667
3421946,4,B0018YGDUI,"if you need a good laugh, that has some intelligence behind it, this dv is perfect for you. it's political and witty. everyone should like it.",1361404800,,142,4.5
3421947,5,B0018YGDUI,"If you want to laugh your butt off , this is a must 4 u  2 see. dana @ his usual best. Buy it you'll like it",1357776000,,108,3.0
3421948,5,B0018YGDUI,"Dana Carvey's disc is a laugh a minute.  I enjoyed Dana back when he
was on Saturday Night Live and his early years.  When I saw this on tv
I knew I would have to find it and buy it.  If you like Dana Carvey you will
want to add this one to your collection.",1357430400,,257,3.6363636363636362
3421949,5,B0018YGDUI,"Dana Carvey, he's so funny, I had to keep from running around the room, laughing so hard, I had a stomach ache.  He's one of the funniest, and the smartest comedians we've got and I tell you, I was loaning it to friends but with the stipulation they give it back as soon as they were done so I could laugh again, again, and again.  Dana tells stories we can all relate to and even doing this review is making me laugh.  It's a marvelous DVD.  Buy it for yourself, buy one for your friend, and if you dare to loan it out, make sure you get it back, they will watch it over and over...and that's O.K.!!!!",1353110400,,602,4.076271186440678
3421950,5,B0018YGDUI,"Dana Carvey is the most imaginative comedian working today.  He doesn't tell jokes, and he doesn't just ""do impressions"", though he's a great impressionist.  He just points out all the funny and ironic things in life--  all the things we know are true and that everybody has noticed on some level-- but that nobody else has ever risked saying out loud.  He's occasionally profane, but never offensive.  He's satirical, but never really nasty--  and when he mimics and satirizes certain politicians he captures things about their essence and compares them to something familiar in a surprising and funny way.  If you're a huge fan of George W. Bush or Dick Cheney, you may not appreciate Carvey's great impressions of them, which are spot-on.  But if you like both Reagan and Obama, Bush, Sr. and Gore, Bill and Hillary, he manages to make fun of all of them without being cruel.  And he managed to bring his impressions of them all together on one stage in a way that was brilliant rather than gratuitous.  His great impression of Schwarzenegger isn't just about the Austrian accent, but rather captures the whole guy in a way no other comic can.  Carvey is a gifted musician who doesn't over-use his musical gifts.  He creates juxtapositions of thought that are brilliant.  His ""takes"" on the 2008 election and religion are unique, hilarious, but never really nasty.  He can take ""tired"" subjects-  like talking about middle age and the health ailments that come with it--  and make them hysterically funny in a whole new way.  His impression of his heart doctors and their various approaches to ""bedside manner"" is priceless because it's so true to everyone's experience. His observations comparing past and present child-rearing practices perfectly capture what everyone is thinking these days when they see over-solicitous parents with their spoiled toddlers, but nobody really says.  His energy is unflagging and his brain crackles with creativity-- at middle age, Dana Carvey is still at the peak of his game, which is all the more remarkable if you know his health history.  I don't know how he does it, and, as with all great comedians, it's almost impossible to describe what Dana Carvey actually does on stage.  But you can see his routines and this HBO special again and again and laugh every time.  He's truly one of a kind.",1274486400,,2336,4.893129770992366
3421951,5,B0018YGDUI,"We have watched this at least a dozen times and laugh everytime.  Our daughter came over and we watched it again a couple of weeks ago and she told us tonight she wants to borrow it for her husband to watch.  I will probably buy a couple more to give as Christmas gifts.  Everyone can relate to this and everyone who sees it will get a good laugh.  I'm really glad we bought it - I hope Dana Carvey does another one soon, I will buy it too.",1254009600,,440,3.965909090909091
3421952,5,B0018YGDUI,I've been following Dana Carvey since I was about eight years old. I am 19 now and I still love him. I watched him on SNL and just bought the Squatting Monkeys tell no lies and I love it! It includes his critics choice special from 95 which is the first time that I ever saw him do stand up. That includes the piano and guitar humor. This is a must buy for anyone who loves a laugh. He is truly a comic genious and I hope he has a few more specials before he retires.,1250035200,9,467,3.875
3421953,3,B0018YGDUI,"I saw this on tv, and I was so excited, because I have loved Dana Carver's work for so long. This was definitly not his best pefromance. Some of the jokes wer his usual funny bits and extreme, but others were just hum drum dry, and I wished that he had worked on some of his material better. I did not hate this work by any means, but I truely feel that he has better work in his catalog. I would definitly recommend The Best od Dana Carvey, SNL over this DVD any day of the week and twice on Sunday.",1237766400,5,500,3.9603960396039604
3421954,5,B0018YGDUI,"We had this recorded on our DVR, but switched servers and lost it.  We watched it several times and laughed every time.  We had to purchase the DVD when we lost it on the DVR.  I am excited to see the additional material that was not on the HBO comedy standup.",1232928000,,260,4.0588235294117645
3421965,5,B0018YGDUI,"Dana Carvey makes me laugh so hard! I will never forget the Critic's Choice special. I was a mid teenager when that came out! I bought it mostly for that disc, but my husband and I love the new one, Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies, too! I'm so glad I have this in my DVD collection!",1232755200,,281,4.035714285714286
3421966,5,B0018YGDUI,Everything as expected from Dana Carvey... Hilarious! You'll appreciate it as soon as you purchase this DVD!,1232236800,,108,5.411764705882353
3421967,5,B0018YGDUI,"If you haven't had the privilege of seeing Dana Carvey do what he does best and you call yourself a stand-up fan, then you are doing something wrong. Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies is pure comedy that will appeal to all ages and he manages to do it tastefully. Critics Choice is Carvey's earlier stand-up and yes this comes as a bonus with the DVD. Between his previously unreleased Critics Choice and Squatting Monkeys Tell No Lies, I cannot decide which I like better. This DVD is like finding one of your favorite bands best album with their other best album included as a bonus. Be sure to pick this up, you will want to show it to all your friends just so you have an excuse to watch it again.",1232236800,,698,4.33587786259542
3421968,5,B0018YGDUI,His impression of Andy Rooney was one of the funniest thing I've ever seen!  This was great!,1232236800,,92,4.411764705882353
3421969,4,B0018YGDUI,I bought this CD after seeing Carvey on Jay Leno.  I will watch it many times over when I need a guaranteed LAUGH!!  ...from beginning to end and the deleted material - it's a Great Buy.  I've ordered 2 more for friends.,1226707200,,220,4.190476190476191
3421970,5,B0018YGDUI,"We started taping this about a quarter of the way through on HBO, and have practically worn it out since! Dana is at the top of his game. Funny, quick, spot-on. Like fine wine, he seems to get better with age. I can't WAIT to see it from the beginning! Go Dana!",1223942400,,261,4.038461538461538
3421971,5,B0018YGDUI,"This movie has become the highlight of my life!  The bits about disorganized religion and the Regan Oracle will have you laughing your butt off!  Dana Carvey has really outdone himself this time.

Sit back and take a hit Spunker!",1223942400,,229,4.675
3421972,5,B0018YGDUI,This DVD is by far one of Dana Carvey's best efforts.  It is extremely funny!  He captures the moment of political satire to a tee! Well worth watching again and again!,1223078400,,168,4.387096774193548
3421973,5,B0018YGDUI,Dana Carvey has been my favorite since 1984. It's great that he finally got another HBO special. And the added bonus of out takes from the special & Critics' Choice included on the second disc makes this truly fabulous.,1222992000,,219,4.641025641025641
3421974,4,B0018YGDUI,"Dana Carvey is not an impersonator - he is a comedian that does impressions. His impressions are more like characters. Even his famous ""George H.W. Bush"" is not spot on, but you know that's how we all want to remember him. On this DVD, Dana does more impressions and some are hit and some are miss. You can tell Dana has been performing more since his rhythm is that of a road comic - fast and punch line laden.

My favorite part is the question and answer session with bonus material. Dana Carvey shows off some improv skills as he answers some fan questions.

Also included is a copy of his first HBO special, ""Critic's Choice"".",1222473600,2,630,4.422413793103448
