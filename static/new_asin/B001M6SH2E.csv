8320583,5,B001M6SH2E,"I have been hooked on this anime since the very first episode. Hell, before that! The trailer had me mesmerized!
Never before has an anime enthralled me as much as Claymore. The storyline keeps me guessing and on edge, I feel what the characters feel (I've even shed a tear or two!).
I cringe and gasp during the fight scenes and I mourned the death of other Claymores.

Simply put, Claymore is amazing and definately worth purchasing (at least rent it!).",1237939200,,455,4.617283950617284
8320584,4,B001M6SH2E,"Claymore volume 3 continues to suck you in as you follow Clare's quest for vengeance. The dub is a mixed bag, but it's decent enough.",1237852800,,133,4.36
8320585,5,B001M6SH2E,I got wind of this series through the G4 TV program: Attack of the Show. Their reviewer gave it high marks so I bought the first DVD and was hooked. This anime series is high quality in both story and production. Order the entire series as it becomes available - you won't be disappointed.,1236384000,,289,4.37037037037037
8320586,5,B001M6SH2E,"Vol. 3 of Claymore was as far from a disappointment as possible. Without spoiling anything, the tale of Clare and Raki gets significantly more interesting. Revelations come to light that create a new dilemma that gripped me in a way of knowing what was already good is definitely getting better. You get to know the characters even more in this DVD. I especially liked Miria a LOT more and hope to see a lot more of her in episodes to come with her impressive personality. New characters are amazing in their personalities to where you love to hate them and like them at the same time.

The episodes are full of many plot twists that left me wondering what was coming next. Some come with surprises, especially if you are not a fan following the manga before seeing this, that shocked and pleased me at the same time. This storyline is really getting more epic as it goes along.

Frankly, these episodes were amazing and left me aching for more. I cannot wait long enough for Vol. 4 to come out because Claymore is showing itself to be among legendary anime status along with company like Full Metal Alchemist. It's that good and a must see. You won't regret. it trust me! Otherwise, all I can say is: WOW!",1235865600,,1206,4.502283105022831
8320587,5,B001M6SH2E,"Alright, well I raved about this series in my review of volume 2, but I only gave it a 4 out of 5 on the grounds that it was unrelentingly bleak. Volume 4 gets 5 stars because (without spoiling anything here) subtle shades of loyalty, friendship, and even weird awkward romance are beginning to shine through the storyline, and the cold hearted Claymores are beginning to become wonderfully three-dimensional. Add that to jaw dropping visuals, freakish nightmare monsters like only dark anime can do, and increasingly cooler powers and more vicious, sick, gore-tastic fight scenes, and you have a recipe for my new favourite anime series! If you love your anime dark and your heroines tough as nails, you will love this show!",1233878400,3,725,4.902439024390244
