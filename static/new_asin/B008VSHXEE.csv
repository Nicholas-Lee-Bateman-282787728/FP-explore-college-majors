There is a ton of coverage of Mo Farah, who deserves the coverage. There is little coverage of non-British athletes and sporting events. .",1357344000,2,481,4.726190476190476

5186354,1,B008VSHXEE,"I purchased this blu-ray set (5 discs) from an American company through U.S. Amazon.  It arrived on December 12, 2012 and I returned it, the next day, on December 13.

I tested all 5 blu-rays on my Panasonic blu-ray player.  There was audio, but no video.  So, I got sound, but no picture.  My Panasonic blu-ray player works on my other blu-rays, DVDs, and CDs.

I did some research and here is some useful information for U.S consumers.

Samsung players and most LG players will play this BBC product (coded Region Free).
Sony and Panasonic will not play this BBC product.
Many Toshiba, Sharp, Pioneer, and Denon players will not play this BBC product.

The above information is from ""Burketop"".  Please read the commentary dated December 4, 2012 which is located under a review dated November 14, 2012.  I suggest you read Burketop's full commentary for more complete and accurate information.

December 24, 2012 Update

I decided to purchase a Samsung BD-E5900 Blu-ray Player and I repurchased the Olympic set.  And the Samsung actually does play this BBC product, along with other regular blu-rays, DVDs, and CDs.

So here's a brief review of the British Olympics set which I give 4 stars.

It contains both the complete opening and the closing ceremonies.

In regard to the sports coverage, if you are an Anglophile, this product is perfect for you.  There is heavy coverage of British athletes, along with British commentary.

The blu-ray also shows very limited highlights of the finals of some events which feature athletes from other countries.  The whole Olympic sports portion is highly edited so the video moves fast and you may only see a few minutes of some competitions, especially if it is of non-British athletes.

Please note that certain events in which the British were not notable are not shown.",1355443200,25,1826,4.879478827361564

I wuld like to know if the Blu-Ray version has any region code restriction, I live in Mexico and most of Blu-Ray players are Region A/1: The Americas (except Greenland), and their dependencies, East Asia (except mainland China and Mongolia), and Southeast Asia.

Looking forward for your feedback.

5186364,5,B008VSHXEE,"Ok background is I bought this for my friend who was in London last year and since I won't give it to her till next week I watched much of it.

1.  I used it on a Toshiba Laptop with VLC player, absolutely no problem and I was prepared to convert my dvd drive to region 2 but didn't have to.

2.  Olympaholics will definitely appreciate the coverage, even though there are some smaller sports missing I don't feel I've been shortchanged.

3.  If you happen to be an Olympaholic with a touch of Anglophilia.......  You might just be in love with this set.

4.  Makes me ashamed of NBC's American coverage, I actually wanted to see if there was a similar BBC production for Beijing 2008.

5.  The production attempts to have the viewer relive those sixteen days, this is impossible but it is as close as you'll get :)

6.  I honestly think I'll either burn this DVD set for myself before I give it to my friend or if that proves too much work, I would definitely buy.",1392854400,2,965,4.265193370165746

8531224,4,B008VSHXEE,"While this emphasizes the British experience, as is to be expected, this 5 disk set is far superior to the rubbish the NBC has been putting out in America. It's sad that we are blocked from watching foreign coverage of the Olympic Games on the internet. The opening and closing ceremonies are complete. And there is an emphasis on many sports Americans don't even remember exist. And it's refreshing to see other folks winning medals besides Team USA. There are a few faults. In emphasizing British accomplishments the women's gymnastics were given a short shrift, check out US coverage for that. And even still more coverage could have been given to other countries. I have older VHS tapes, particularly those narrated by Bud Greenspan, that really seemed to emphasize the global nature of the competitions more than even these do. But having said that these are a substantial improvement over the tainted pablum that NBC spoons out so cynically in order to sell product and cater to the lowest common denominator. (Why did ABC ever drop the ball? And when will someone else pick it up again?) Yes these are Region 2. So get a region free player. They're cheap.

8531226,2,B008VSHXEE,"One reviewer said that this is a BBC production held in the UK and that's true, but that doesn't mean it has to be an homage to only British athletes. The Olympics after all is for everyone. It seems the only coverage other Olympians got was when they broke a record, or were a medal winner. Football was barely mentioned until the gold medal game, for instance. If they stated that this was for the British audience, geared towards British athletes, that would have been fine since I would have known that before deciding to buy it.

My other gripe is that out of the five discs, two of them and part of a third was dedicated solely to the opening and closing ceremonies. Considering how much content they could have included, this was a big disappointment. When you realize nearly half of the content in the five discs was for ceremonies, it's really a let down.

As to the content, I thought it was well done, and the commentary was good. Video quality is also good, though the intro to the games after the ceremony had some blurring effects which I didn't see on any of the other discs. Although the coverage was well done, less than three discs were dedicated to the actual Games. Overall a disappointing buy.",1458604800,,1214,4.513636363636364

8531229,5,B008VSHXEE,"For whatever reason NBC-Universal after the 2008 Bejing Olympics has not offered DVD collections as extensive as the ones of 2008. Indeed the DVD for London 2012 was much abbreviated and evidently there is nothing available for Sochi 2014, most displeasing to this reviewer at least. Is this an additional attempt to punish Russia? Most productions of the BBC in whatever genre are superior and this is no exception. Most importantly for the Olympics the opening ceremonies are virtually complete and the closing ceremonies equally so. Granted, the coverage of individual and team events focuses more on athletes of the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth and that is perfectly understandable. NBC did the same for Bejing and London by more attention to covering the competitors from the United States. But, overall even with this emphasis this BBC offering gives us much more than is otherwise available. This being available only in Region 2 or PAL compatibility is only a minor inconvenience as I discovered some years ago that if I wanted to have a varied DVD collection I needed to purchase a region free DVD player, and I did so, from Amazon.",1431734400,,1148,4.984375
