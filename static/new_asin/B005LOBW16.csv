4829534,5,B005LOBW16,"Michael Baisden asked,and got the answers to a question that is on every man's mind. This film was very insightful and entertaining. I was in agreement & experienced the many things that Baisden and the cast touched on, in my own past relationships. One of my closest friends was in the cast & panel, and she revealed some things about herself in the film, that she has never shared with me. This is a must have DVD for everyone in a relationship. Thanks M.B. for a great film.",1319760000,,477,4.431818181818182
4829535,5,B005LOBW16,"SO HAPPY I PURCHASED THIS DVD! Not only is it entertaining but so REAL! I love that Michael got points of views from everyone of all ages and nationalities. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS DVD, NOT A DULL MOMENT!",1319760000,,204,4.394736842105263
4829536,5,B005LOBW16,"Mr. Baisden I salute you on a job well done. I saw the TV special on Centric and ordered the DVD right away! I received it yesterday and watched it with my girls. OMG! I never heard women shout at the TV so much in my life. Thank you for producing a film that showed both sides of the issues, it was informative and entertaining. But most of all, thank you for you kindness and generosity. I'll be sending in my business plan for your Million Dollar Business Pitch on November 28th, thank you for reaching back when so many other won't even look back! Peace my brother!",1319673600,11,569,4.277777777777778
4829537,5,B005LOBW16,"It's about damn time Mike! I was wondering when you would stop allowing these other radio personalities to shine. I'm not hating, but you are a true author. I loved men cry in the dark, The Maintenance Man, and God's gift to women. I'm going to get together with a  group of my friends and watch this DVD with them. I can't wait until they see the scene with the Passion Party, Hilarious!!! George is a mess!",1319673600,2,408,4.298701298701299
4829538,5,B005LOBW16,"3 letters for this film.....H-O-T! As always, Michael Baisden BROUGHT IT!! Being in the film was an awesome experience overall working with Michael, George, and the rest of the cast. Being able to express AND listen to the ideas/thoughts of both men AND women enlightened each of us as well as the audience. This is a MUST-HAVE  in your collection for family and friend gatherings! KEEP 'EM COMING MICHAEL!!!",1319673600,9,408,4.913043478260869
4829539,5,B005LOBW16,"George Willborn is a stone fool! lmao Mike me and the fellahs watched George's Comedy DVD ""Turn Around"" and your film with a group of women. Steven A. Smith from ESPN did a great job representing the men's point of view. He was articulate and fair. But I have some issues with the woman in white who said black men aren't attentive, maybe she should check her bait to see why she's catching so many bad fish! lol Continue to do your thing Mike, the men have your back. P.S. Thanks for the new feature on Good Men Mondays. We need to let the ladies know we're not all bad.",1319673600,3,571,4.2
4829540,5,B005LOBW16,"This relationship film is a real eye opener into the minds of the sexes, what motivates each gender and what we really want. Its easy to think we have our own individual craziness (which of course we do!) but its also very interesting to know there are other women thinking the EXACT same things I'm thinking when it comes to searching for the right relationship. I think we speak English and men hear Greek, which is shown in detail with the real life conversations. But we need and want each other which is what I got from this film. I thoroughly enjoyed it and highly recommend it!",1319673600,2,584,4.4672897196261685
4829541,5,B005LOBW16,"My friends and I watched the film and had such a great time!  It was fun and funny.  We were chiming in the whole time, talking to the screen and answering Michael's questions.  Everyone should get this and watch it with their friends both female and male.  It is funny to see the reactions of the men to what the women want especially when they go there about things like how much foreplay we want, if we ladies every fake and open relationships.  The passion party was hysterical!  Michael Baisden and George Willborn are crazy funny!  I loved it!  I can't stop laughing!  All that is left to say is 20 MINUTES!  If you don't know what that means you need to get the film and see for yourself!

4829585,3,B005LOBW16,"I,have watched this dvd,several times. It is a step in the right direction,about understanding Women, and men. And yes sex and relationships. But, I have heard better conversations, about the same subjects at the Barber shop. I have had better conversations with Co-worker's and friend associates. Micheal and George, should not do the dvd. The women seemed to much like they wanted too get with them. So the answer's they gave to the topic's seemed more if it was( Micheal and George) this would be my answer. Last I won't say it's worth buying. But let someone else spend there cash. Unless you are shy about talking about life.",1325462400,2,630,4.7889908256880735
4829586,1,B005LOBW16,"I DID NOT PURCHASE THIS DVD. 20MINS OF THIS DVD WAS THE INTRODUCTION ON THE GEORGE WILLBORN ""TURN AROUND"" COMEDY DVD. MICHAEL BAISDEN IS A RADIO HOST AND HE'S TAKING CALLS FROM PEOPLE ASKING, "" DO WOMEN KNOW WHAT THEY WANT""? ALL YOU SEE IS MICHAEL AT WORK INSIDE THE RADIO STUDIO AND HE'S COMMENTING ON WHAT CALLERS ARE SAYING. IF YOU HAVE TO CALL A RADIO STATION TO FIND OUT IF A WOMEN KNOWS WHAT SHE WANTS, THEN THIS WOULD EXPLAIN WHY YOU DON'T HAVE A WOMEN! WAIT FOR IT COME IN REDBOX AND USE PROMO CODE ""DVDONME"" SO YOU CAN RENT IT FOR FREE (IF YOU REALLY WANT TO SEE THIS GARBAGE)!!!",1325116800,,588,4.166666666666667

4829589,5,B005LOBW16,"I got the DVD after watching the informerical on Centric. I had to pause it several times because I didn't want to miss any of it. Filled with Straight talk from women trying to tell men what we really want. Question is are they listening lol. Michael Baisden always keeps it real on his talk show and he continued asking the important questions in the DVD. Serious, Funny, and informative. Love lust and lies was a good DVD but this one is over all my favorite. After reading all 5 of Michael Baisdens Books, God's gift to women was my favorite. I am buying these as christmas gifts for the men on my list. This DVD is a must buy.",1319932800,,631,4.266666666666667
4829590,5,B005LOBW16,"A friend of mine and me saw the documentary in Baltimore with Michael Baisden and George Wilborn over the summer, thanks Pamela.  Subsequently, I decided that as soon as I could get my hand on the DVD I would have a Documentary, aka Watch Party; when the DVD became available I ordered the box set.  I never knew about ""Lust and Lies,"" so I watched it alone and then invited some male and female friends over to watch it with me as a prelude to my Documentary Party; they loved it.  I invited men and women and combined a Tasting Party with my ""Do Women Know What They Want"" Documentary Party which was a nice touch and got the conversation going early; it got hot in the kitchen before the documentary even started.  I learned something during discussions about both of the documentaries, definitely an eye opener.  The surprise twist to my party was that a friend invited a urologist and when she spoke you could hear a pin drop on the carpet, whoa!  I believe the men enjoyed it more than the women, but basically everyone said they enjoyed the honesty from both sides.  They want more, hence, a third party is planned, it will be straight talk with the urologist and she plans to bring a friend and adult toys; she says these toys have kept marriages together!

Shout out to the bruhs of Omega Psi Phi PLL Chapter and the other men, for showing your support and giving honest opinions, thanks to the too ladies!

For each party I'm adding on more folks.  Alright, Mr. Baisden, Mr. Wilborn and Pamela, I'm inviting you all to come to Virginia, we're just outside Washington, D.C., to watch the movie with us and we'll do it again!",1319760000,2,1633,4.468013468013468
4829591,5,B005LOBW16,"Informative...funny...real

I must admit that I was initially apprehensive about the title, but after watching the DVD, I am beyond impressed.  Michael Baisden brings the same authenticity of his radio show to the screen.  He takes the time to give both male and female perspectives on the subject of ""Do Women Know What They Want?"" in a real world setting with a hint of humor which makes it enjoyable to watch.

I experienced every emotion while viewing it:  from the arms-folded-""oh no he didn't"" moments to ""laugh out loud"" experiences followed by thunderous applause for those that echoed my personal sentiments on the topic (both male and female).

The material is raw and thought provoking--definitely a great movie for ""watch parties"" that will open up meaningful, much-needed dialogue about relationships.  This is definitely a film that I will watch over and over again, as with each viewing, you can learn something new.

Final verdict:  Two thumbs up for a job well done!  I can't wait to see more!  Add this one to your repertoire!!!",1319760000,2,1046,4.954022988505747
