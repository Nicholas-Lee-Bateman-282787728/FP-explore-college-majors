8627722,3,B00GV885ZW,"I really enjoyed this Japanese rendition of ""You're Beautiful"".  Although it doesn't compare to the original Korean drama, it was cute in its own way.  I smiled and laugh with the characters.  When I was watching this version, the characters reminded me of the chibi version of the original characters.  The Japanese characters lacked the maturity of the original Korean cast.  They looked far too young and the mother of the leader looked more like she would have been his grandmother. What I also liked is that they kept the music and songs the same; just in Japanese.

The only thing that I had a problem with is that the second disc was translated badly.  The worst part is that the horrible translation started on the episode that Jang Keun Suk appeared as himself.  Even though, I still enjoyed seeing him (he's just so handsome).  I was so frustrated with the translation that I decided to turn it off.  For those who've seen the original Korean drama, you'll get the gist of it.

Even with the sub-par translation, I was still happy with my purchase.  I just hope that they will re-release this with better translation.  I will definitely buy it if they do.",1398384000,,1165,4.651960784313726
