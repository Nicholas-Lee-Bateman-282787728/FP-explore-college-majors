8062600,2,B0009KA830,"Basic biology pretty well kills the premise of the movie. The idea of a man having several days to chase down the woman who cut off his penis and still expecting to have it reattached boggles the imagination. Assuming he didn't bleed out in the first few minutes after decapitation, the wife's claim of ""its packed in ice"" isn't going to do any good after the first day.

He should have explained that she had 24 hours before her bargaining chip ""expired"" and became useless.",1458000000,,475,4.588235294117647

8062602,1,B0009KA830,This just is not a good movie if you want to enjoy a movie. If you don't care whether or not something is enjoyable to watch then you may find some kind of merit here.,1425081600,,167,3.8

8062604,5,B0009KA830,"I'm a big fan of Debbie Rochon, cult horror actress whose considerable acting chops are often lost in the substandard stuff she's in, so it's a pleasure to see her in a film that actually uses her skills. This is a nicely crafted low budget film about some unpleasant things (esp. if you're a guy: there's a urination scene sure to get every male cringing), but it's got humor, good characterizations, and the lovely Ms. Rochon in top form.",1156032000,3,440,4.582278481012659
8062605,4,B0009KA830,"This no budget hand grenade rips apart the mold of gutless, brainless and disingenuously politically correct products that have become de rigueur in filmmaking today: our main character discovers that his fiance has appeared in several interracial porno films; our main character calls off the engagement and abuses said fiance; our main character has his penis cut off and held for ransom.  Sound like an exploitation film? Yes, but this one has brains and wit. Probably one of the darkest films you'll ever see, but the pathos is leavened with a twisted humor (catch 'Daddy Mac' rapping, or 'Dr. Johnson' counseling). This being said, 'Nowhere Man' is sure to offend some of you, especially those who specialize in getting moralistic and self righteously worked up over whatever.  And many will be turned off by the low production values, and somewhat thin storyline.  But these are petty qualms in what is a gutsy little piece of counter-culture.",1122940800,9,949,5.07051282051282
8062606,5,B0009KA830,"Okay, I feel like I've just been tickled and punched for eighty minutes.  This shot on video movie about a great-looking guy who searches for his (...) in the porn underworld deserves a lot of credit for it's intelligence, but most of all for it's unrelenting intensity.  Aside from the pulpy aspects, this film has some incredibly honest moments: the relationship between the two leads rings strong and true; this film also has the most intense `rape' scene since the one in that French film ""IRREVERSIBLE"".  Probably not your cup of tea if you like comedies with the word `wedding' in the title.  But if you don't mind the cut-rate production, get ready for a very interesting viewing.",1122336000,7,687,4.796610169491525
8062607,4,B0009KA830,"Two things immediately put this movie at a disadvantage: it's shot on video, and it involves a guy getting his willy removed.  So once the good taste snobs and the aesthetic snobs took their whacks at this movie, it didn't have a chance in theaters.

It is, however, a really enjoyable classic-style B-movie, like the work of Anthony Mann or DETOUR (which is featured briefly in the film).  Director Tim McCann has made a couple of great under-the-radar movies, and this fits snugly in with those.  I recommend checking this out, as well as his previous work REVOLUTION #9 (which also has a Beatles title) and DESOLATION ANGELS (which also deals with a man unhinged by a secret dealing with his girlfriend).  The acting all around, in the lead and smaller roles, is surprisingly and uniformly brilliant.

If you can get over yourself, I think you'll like it.",1121990400,7,858,4.763513513513513
