1239116,4,B00000JYLZ,"To start, I am not a regular Warlock movie, or for that matter horror movie viewer. I adore classic films, comedy, romance and dramas best...... But this  flick I had to see on the day of it's release. WHY ? I am the  biggest ""Richard C.  Hearst"" FAN in the world ! This is Rick's  first movie since leaving Guiding Light so I waited longingly for it for  over a year.
 ""Scott's"" introduction is......beyond MEMORABLE.  (I about fell out of my chair !) Scott is a fab character, the typical  arrogant, self-absorbed, yet sexy, GUY everyone  knows......He is  completely different from Rick's long-running character on GL:  ""Alan-Michael Spaulding"". And so naturally I ADORED EVERY second Rick was  on the screen. Which he used to  the utmost :)
My only WISH ? .......Lisa  could have spent more ""quality time"" with Scott  before the  Warlock interrupted their tryst ......sigh ! There are hundreds of A-M fans  that thought a good spanking is just what A-M always  needed......hmmmm
But as to my impressions on the rest of the movie  ......It's well shot, well  acted and I was even impressed with the special  effects. I was not thrilled  with what happened to my new love  (""Scotty Baby"".......LOL) but found a quick hit  of the FF button  got me through the blood and guts shots nicely.
Best part of this flick  for me was scenes (in that AWSOME old mansion in  Ireland) of the friends  intermingling -- casually insulting each other, off  color remarks designed  to get a laugh, yet the genuine affection shared by all.
Also worth  mentioning is the haunting performance (and LOVE his voice ! ) of  the  Warlock (Bruce Payne). This was the first I have seen any of his work and I  liked him very much ! So I guess this starts me off on a whole new genre  of movies...... a  little broadening of ones horizons is never bad........I  was inspired after  viewing this movie to introduce my teenagers to  ""Poltergeist"" and ""The  Amityville Horror"" this week. I  may even dust off some of my old fave  Hitchcock. I now own ""Warlock  III End Of Innocence"" on DVD. I'm recommending it too all of Rick's  fans.",939859200,2,2106,4.62125340599455

1239138,1,B00000JYLZ,"Here is a quick sequential sum-up of my emotions during the first part of ""Warlock III: The End of Innocence"":

1. Boredom.
2. Boredom.
3. Still bored.
4. Bored bored bored.
5. I don't care about these people.
6. Finally, the Warlock.
7. Wait... that's not Julian Sands.
8. Why is Julian Sands not here?
9. That's... that's the guy with the blue lipstick from ""Dungeons and Dragons.""
10. NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!

... while the movie laughed and mocked me, saying ""Where is your God now?!""

While ""Warlock: The Armageddon"" was awful, it at least had Julian Sands bringing his effortless, menacing coolness to it. Without him, ""Warlock III: The End of Innocence"" ends up basically being a generic, tedious slasher movie, with a host of intensely obnoxious characters, dangling plot threads, and lots of graphic gore and boobs rather than subtle haunting scares.

Art student Kris Miller (Ashley Laurence) is informed of an old house belonging to her long-lost family, in which she hopes to discover clues to her mysterious past. Her friends come charging in because... well, we need bodies to get killed off -- jerk boyfriend (Paul Francis), fried-blonde Wiccan Robin (Boti Bliss), stoner Jerry (Jan Schweiterman) and the S&M couple (Angel Boris and Rick Hearst).

They accidentally free the Warlock (Bruce Payne NOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!), who poses as an architect interested in the house. Robin instantly suspects that this guy is up to no good, but sadly nobody listens to her because.... well, the movie would be over. And as the weekend goes on, the Warlock sets out to capture Kris, but first he must force all her friends to forsake her because... well, no reason is really given.

""Warlock III: The End of Innocence"" is basically your average slasher movie, but with a Warlock torturing and picking off obnoxious college students instead of a masked serial killer. And yes, like ""Warlock: The Armageddon,"" this movie has absolutely nothing to do with the other two -- it's just another random blonde, black-clad, omnipotent Warlock who wants to do evil stuff, because he's evil.

In true slasher fashion, there is a lot of sex, boobs and graphic gore (Scott and Lisa have no other function), with some tepid jump scares even before the Warlock's release. To be fair, director Eric Freiser does give us a few memorable scenes (the time-loop escape), but it's mired in a sea of clammy, sludgy ineptitude.

The plot is a mess, and it often feels like it was made up as they went along. Robin seems like she will be an important character, and perhaps give Kris a chance against the Warlock... but she ends up being killed almost instantly. A major character's fate is left unknown. And the Warlock violates his own rules -- for some reason it's okay to kill Robin and the historian, but every other character must betray Kris. Why? How is this decided?

And the Warlock's motivation... seems to come out of left field. It's not even hinted at until near the end, when he randomly decides to blurt out his Evil Plans of Evil. It feels like they belatedly realized that he HAD no motivation, and quickly cobbled one together.

And Bruce Payne... oh, Bruce Payne. To be fair, this is the most restrained performance I have seen by him, which is admittedly not saying much. For the first three-quarters of the movie, he gives a sort of flat imitation of Julian Sands. But after capturing Kris, he gives up and goes into full-on hamtastic mode (""YOOOOUUU DON'T HAVE THE POOWWWAAAAHHH!""). None of the other actors are really memorable enough to comment on, alas.

""Warlock III: The End of Innocence"" is not only a terrible (Julian Sands-less) sequel, it's just a terrible movie overall --  a set-up straight out of a slasher, with silly acting and a script riddled with holes. An utter disaster.",1392595200,,3788,4.864906832298137
1239139,3,B00000JYLZ,"I think I bought it just so I could complete the set. I don't think it was nearly as good without Julian Sands. I fell asleep towards the end. Not very scary. Kind of gory, typical of 80's A movie sequel gone B movie. If you can't scare em. Make em puke.",1388620800,,254,3.9038461538461537
1239140,5,B00000JYLZ,"I never have seen the first 2 movies of this, but I really liked this one a lot. I know this one is a different person playing the Warlock from what I heard, but this Warlock does the job quite nicely. It was also a nice touch to see Ashley Laurence ""Kirsty"" from the Hellraiser 1, 2, 3, and 6 films. For a low budget film, this was very nicely done. Good story, cast, and lots of thrills and suspense. It had me wanting more, and I wished there would have been a sequel to this one, after I saw it. I have the DVD version of this, but sure wish this was available on Blu-ray. For a low budget film tho, it looks nice on DVD however. I recommend this film to own or to complete your collection. 4.8 out of 5",1381795200,,707,3.9510489510489513
1239141,2,B00000JYLZ,"If you have seen the first two movies.  You can stop there.  This one is a C at best.  Okay if their is nothing else on t.v., and if you have already watched your entire DVD collection.  I bought it to complete the set.

When I sat down to watch it.  I was surprised.  I thought that I had the wrong DVD.  Quality is not even close to the previous two.",1327622400,,352,3.859154929577465
1239142,5,B00000JYLZ,"I don't care what others think of the third Warlock movie, I loved it. It had the action of the first 2 movies and all the suspense of them as well. Though I did miss seeing Julian Sands in the part of the Warlock. I think he was great in the first 2 and with him playing the warlock, I had chills going down my spine",1294704000,,317,3.8181818181818183
1239143,2,B00000JYLZ,Julian Sands is way better. Would have liked this movie if Julian Sands was the Warlock.,1264464000,,88,4.5625
1239144,3,B00000JYLZ,"...Julian Sands decided to grace this iteration with his presence. Oh well, not a perfect movie but its always good to see Ashley Laurence ala Hellraiser I, II, and Hellseeker. Ashley was just great to watch and played her character well in this film. I would have given higher marks if they actually cast the supporting characters with a little more thought. All of the characters seemed a little old to be college students, maybe they were getting their Master's... I doubt it though.

Ultimately, the supporting crew wasn't great but don't get me wrong Warlock III is actually decent and Bruce Payne makes a great warlock. The film proliferates the franchise, in a self contained sort of way and it's success lies in the fact that the film doesn't rely too much on continuity from the first two films, which is a good thing considering no Julian Sands. I just hate when they try to pass off another character as the original protagonist and while Bruce Payne looks vaguely like the original warlock absolutely no reference was made.

Another added bit of decency is that the story itself downplays gore and replaces the ""horror"" with commentary on relationships, or lack thereof. During the film we watch as the warlock slowly infiltrates the barrier's put up by the group hold-up at an old mansion. You would think with such an odd ball cast the acting would be all over the place. Instead they did a good job of keeping it minimal, subtle.

In the end Ashley Laurence's character finds out she is truly alone. *Gasp* The horror!

Gotta love that.

In Warlock III the horror is mere punctuation to the back story of Ashley Laurence's character, the protagonist and the commentary on relationships. There was one particularly decent interaction in the film with one of the characters, who happened to be a Wicca and Ashley Laurence's character's self proclaimed best friend. Warlock III is definitely a rent or if you're like me a watch on on-demand this month, via FearNet",1239148800,,1976,4.8
1239145,5,B00000JYLZ,I have always liked Payne's work and this is no exception. Anyone who is a fan of the Warlock movies should definitely add this to the collection!,1210809600,,146,4.444444444444445
1239146,5,B00000JYLZ,This movie keep you on the edge of the seat because you never know what is going to happen next. This is a great movie I would recomment it to anyone that likes these kind of movies,1208390400,,181,3.918918918918919
1239147,1,B00000JYLZ,"A lot of reviewers have mentioned the good performance of Bruce Payne in this movie. I just feel that I have to comment that unless you are a fan of his to begin with you will probably be bored to death by this movie.

In my humble opinion both the script and the actors are beyond bland and do not compare at all to the two previous movies neither in quality or content. I would never have made it to the end had it not been for a desire to see if it was possible to maintain the awful quality throughout the movie. Amazingly it was. If you liked the two first movies, do yourself a favor and don't watch this. Buy another movie at random, you're pretty much guaranteed to get better value for money.

That said, this is an interesting example of how you can make bland actors look worse by giving them a boring and inconsistent script and then letting a mad, drug abusing parrot do the editing.

Best scene: The warlock struggling(and failing) to pull the main character back while she is *knocking down a brick wall*. A study in how to portray the villain as an elderly lady in a warlock suit. God... I was crying on behalf of everyone involved.",1172707200,5,1148,4.305555555555555
1239148,1,B00000JYLZ,"Hottie Ashley Laurence (Hellraiser, Lightning Bug) and her friends stay at this old building which is supposed to be of historical significance. While at this shindig, Warlock Bruce Payne (Dungeons and Dragons 1 and 2) arrives convincing everyone that he is an archtect and so on and so forth. Then a storm hits, so Payne stays with the gang threwout the night...some thing he's cool, some think he's just a freak and some think that's he's not who he says he is. Soon, Payne unleashes his wrath, killing the friends off one by one to get to the prize, which is Laurence and he's supposed to sacrifice her for something. I was only interested in this for Bruce Payne, Ashley Laurence and Soap Opera star Rick Hearst (Carpool Guy, Tv's General Hospital). Also starring Angel Boris (Intercepter Force) and Boti Ann Bliss (National Lampoon's Dorm Daze). Another crappy horror sequel to put on the pile.",1130803200,3,899,4.806451612903226
1239149,2,B00000JYLZ,"I liked Warlock, really liked Warlock: The Armageddon and was uninspired by Warlock III.

The first two had really original storylines but this one chose a typical ""college kids"" in a spooky house route.  None of the humor of the first two films can be found here.  The creative use of the warlock's powers wasn't even developed much in this one.

The ending bothered me.  I don't want to ruin the film for anyone who still wants too see it so I will just say that the epilogue of the film just didn't seem to fit with the rest of the film.  The climax was what i had expected ut the epilogue seemed unbelievable.

The film would be enjoyable for anyone who felt that the first two were a little too light.  The tone is decidedly darker in this installment to fit in with contemporary horror films (you could go light in the 80's and 90's).  This meant it wasn't as epic as the other films.  In the first two films the Warlock is trying to unmake creation or free Satan from Hell, in this one it's just about killing a girl and her friends.",1099267200,6,1040,4.287179487179487
1239150,1,B00000JYLZ,"For those who have not seen this movie yet, do yourselves a favour and just rent it if you absolutley have to, for the watch once appeal(for lack of a better word).
Warlock 1 and 2 are absolutely fantastic movies, with great story, intrigue and although the Warlock is of course evil, you are captured by the immense power of the character.  Warlock 3 has no right whatsoever in being part of the Warlock movie legacy.  Bruce Payne does play a good Warlock.  In fact if it wasn't for his character portrayl and a chance to compare the two Warlocks I would have stopped after the first 25 minutes of the film.
Basically if you want to watch a porno film, then grab a porno film.  When however you want to watch a movie about an occult figure for the story and the idea of the Warlock in an engrossing account, you reach for a film like this.  The problem is, it doesn't provide you with that story.  The character is not even the focus of the film, instead the focus is on seeing a bunch of 2nd rate actors butt naked 40% of the time and giving an audience the impression that all college students are idiots.
This film should never have been made.  Watch it if your a fan of Bruce Payne but be warned you will be using the fast forward function on your remote often during this film.",1087257600,6,1283,4.276859504132231
1239151,3,B00000JYLZ,"Warlock III - End of Innocence
I started out on the wrong foot with this film.  I made the classic mistake of rushing to get a film for the weekend, not finding what I wanted and grabbing something that I thought was the continuation of another series entirely.  Not until the action opened on an entirely different cast of players did I figure out my mistake.  Being doubly grumpy does not make me a friendly viewer.
The film starts out with college student Kris (Ashley Lawrence) receiving a call about a house she had inherited.  Since Kris had never known her original family, she jumps at the opportunity to learn about her past and dashes off, without her friends, to investigate.  She arrives and is promptly badly spooked (people who know this series will recognize the house as belonging to Phillip Coventry [Bruce Payne], the warlock).  A grand thumping at the door announces the arrival of... Kris's college friends.  Among them her boyfriend Michael (Paul Francis), her best friend and apprentice witchlet Robin (Boti Ann Bliss), and her high school buddy Jerry (Jan Schweiterman).  ""Great!"" thinks me, ""Yet another college student hack-and-slash film.""
Well, it is and it isn't.  Don't mistake me; 'End of Innocence' has a twenty-five word or less plot, an unknown cast, and the requisite gratuitous nudity and violence.  Nevertheless, surprisingly, the film isn't cheesy at all.  Director Eric Freiser stays with fairly understated and subdued effects, rather than immense splashes of gore and parts.  This makes that acting more prominent, and several of the cast really turn in professional jobs.  Coupled with a setting that actually is interesting, and good film work, this makes the story far more believable that many similar efforts.
The end result is an enjoyable rendition of a classic grade B horror flick - forgettable, but fun.  Definitely an R rating, but not excessively so.  I would suggest seeing parts one and two first.  Then you won't have to spend the time I did figuring out what is going on.",1032566400,19,2027,4.952662721893491
1239152,4,B00000JYLZ,"Okay, firstly I'm a huge Julian Sands fan and admit I was a little disappointed that he wasn't in the third installment of the Warlock series.
It's of course your run of the mill horror flick. HOWEVER, I will say that I really enjoyed this movie with Bruce Payne as the warlock. Sands having a maleviolent air about him, you knew immediately that he was the villian of the movie. But in #3 Payne seemed much more beneviolent. I liked that he intentionally portrayed his charactor awkward and out of place as he would for warlock trapped within his own house for 350 years lacking human contact. He seemed innocient and likeable. Also, I especially enjoyed the individual dialoge he had speaking with each one of the charactors as he methodically tricked them into handing over their friend for the sacrifice.
I haven't seen Bruce Payne in a lot of films, but he's a good actor and it's a shame he's not in more mainstream movies. He shines under thick clouds and I'd really like to see more of him.",1006473600,2,998,4.55
1239153,1,B00000JYLZ,"I watched this expeciting something good aside from the other 2 warlock movies which i really liked.  first off, the movie is slow,  the beginning dose not help you with the rest of the movie, but what really makes this movie bad is the base of the movie.  This new warlock needs to kill the decendent of a wicca that killed him(what a surprise plot).  but to be able to kill her, he must get her friends to betray her and give her to him for sacrifice, remember this includes her boyfriend.  This plot is bad and you can see this plot mess coming from a mile away and what dose not help is that all of her friends sell her out, even knowing that they are going to die anyway.  This is a movie where they have a smart intelligent warlock going into battle with unarmed victims, meaning, when this guy shows up out of no where, they don't have a problem with it.  Warlock and Warlock II are very decent movies, this one just dose not help in the imagination or the horror department.  besides, if a girls boyfriend was on fire, you know for sure that he would burn in hell before he would give her up, at least that is what some would think.",1004313600,7,1140,4.197247706422019
1239154,2,B00000JYLZ,"Oh, look mom, another Scream style movie.  Unlike the first two Warlock movies that actually had original and decent stories, this one just copies the current trend of unoriginal story.  Kids go to old house, strange man shows up, strange man is evil, kids are stupid, strange evil man kills them in weird and exotic ways, one person lives to defeat strange man, and live happily ever after.  The only thing good about this was Bruce Payne, he plays a real excellent bad guy.  Other than that this movie was not really worth the [amount of money] I paid for it.",1003276800,3,561,4.524752475247524
1239155,2,B00000JYLZ,"Why...oh why...did they make ANOTHER sequel?  The first movie was an instantaneous classic featuring the EXTREMELY well cast Julian Sands as the Warlock.  The second movie, a fresh twist for the '90s fans of the first one, had its only highlights being that it still contained Julian Sands (in his chic look with shorter hair and designer black clothes) and a killer song by Napalm Death in the credits.  But the third one, missing out on the Julian Sands action (he could shave his head and dance in a dress like in Mercy, worth renting just to see that part), has nothing going for it except for some kinky S&M (I don't remember the other two needing sex scenes to sell the movie). I could barely make it through it, because it was so boring.  The only scares it had were rip offs from other horror movies.  Personally, I don't find Bruce Payne at all intimidating.  This movie makes me fear for the horror movies of the 21st century.  Don't buy it unless you want to complete your trilogy (or if you liked Urban Legends 2 or Scream 3).
The End of Innocence, more like The Tragic Failure of a Good Series.",970704000,16,1107,4.4504950495049505
1239156,4,B00000JYLZ,"One movie I was not too fond of was Warlock featuring an actor I really couldn't stand...Warlock featuring Julian Sands. It was quite a predictable, if not quite boring film.
One day, I'm not sure if I saw it  on a pay-tv channel or what, but I watched Warlock: Armageddon. I really  thought it was neat, original, and especially smart. So when I saw yet  another sequel, I was hesitant, but picked it up anyways.
What I received  was not as original as Armageddon, but it did have its entertainment value.  I remember long ago when Witchboard had the same effect, but it did not  hold up over time, and I can't say I think this one will either.
The  creators of this film have done a wonderful job on what looks like a not  too huge direct-to-video budget. A major selling point was the presence of  'Hellraiser's' Ashley Laurence (I'm a sucker for a cute tough girl that can  defeat demons) as I have not seen her in anything since 'The Lurking Fear'.  Once again, in typical Ashley Laurence fashion she's the main chased after  girl who must defeat the demon (or shall we say warlock).
Bruce Payne  grew on me through the film. At first I must admit I even thought Julian  Sands would be better. But his calm demeanour really intensified the scenes  and gave some nice atmosphere.
The film, yes is quite a stereotypical  one. But it did have interesting elements placed in it. I really liked the  druid aspect that Armageddon brought, and while it isn't really showcased  in this film, there is a good witch, and a nice young aspiring good witch  that try to battle the Warlock. Unfortunately it is in a minimal amount of  the film.
A group of friends, all of different stereotypes (one is a  musician, another an artist, a witch, a kinky sex kitten, and a kinky  muscled possible ahem jockish-type character?) head to an old house which  is scheduled to be demolished.  Ashley Laurence, whom in this film is an  orphan, never knew her birth parents. It is their old house. What follows  is your basic what has happened in the past will now repeat in the future.  It is only up to this small group of friends to stop it (and whatever clues  and artefacts are found around the house).
I recommend this film to  anyone who likes mild witchcrafty-type horror films for a light viewing.  It's not like the other Warlock films have been Shakespeare, and this one  is the same.",947721600,6,2374,4.515294117647059

Poor acting, poor story telling and a waste of time. This film was a joke.",1519171200,,397,4.527777777777778

7913754,5,B00000JYLZ,"Warlock 3: The End of Innocence is the 3rd and final installation of the 1990s horror/thriller series, Warlock. College student and aspiring artist, Kris Miller receives a phone call one morning from a historian informing her that she has inherited an ancient family house that's been standing for centuries. She visits the home, accompanied by her boyfriend, Michael and her friends Jerry; Scott; Lisa; and Robin to retrieve some heirlooms before it's torn down for construction.

Not long into her stay, she's frightened by supernatural noises as well as visions and dreams of a strange doll. Then suddenly, their visited by the somewhat charming Warlock, posing as an architect interested in the house, with his own personal, demonic agenda. The Warlock has a big interest in Kris' bloodline, relating to his own history and through it all will prey on Kris' friends and manipulate them through the most evil ways imaginable to get to Kris.

Overall: I really can't understand why this Warlock gets so much flak as this was a really good way to end the trilogy. For starters, Warlock 3 has no correlation to the first two Warlock films. It has its own unique plot and characters, meaning the great Julian Sands was absent from this film. Sands is replaced with Bruce Payne who does incredible in his role as the Warlock. The difference between him and Sands is that Sands seemed to be more of a cool headed demon who was very calm in carrying out his dastardly deeds. Payne on the other hand drips maliciousness in his portrayal. He's evil to the core, and very manipulative and psychological and above all else just charismatic. He had my skin crawling in quite a few scenes. Ashley Laurence, best known for her portrayal as Kirsty Cotton in the Hellraiser series gives an admirable performance as the film's main protagonist, Kris Miller. Although I must say they didn't really do the characters any favors by making her a damsel in distress, who's looking to be saved by someone every time she's in trouble. The kills in the movie are gruesome to say the least and for those who like seeing T&A in horror films, there's a scene with Angel Boris in a leather dominatrix outfit with a whip. Dream on! Overall, Warlock 3 was a spectacular way to end the series. Usually, I hate when horror series' go off the trail and bring in new actors and cast members to play the part of the film's main character but in this case it worked out perfectly. Bruce Payne was a bad*ss to say the least. 5/5 from me!",1482969600,,2502,4.697038724373576
