8277303,5,B001AGNFY6,"After reading long way round, and watching the TV series, I went into a craze and bought the rest of the adventures and episodes associated the the Boorman crew. Lucky for me, they're turning out very well! I really liked Race to Dakar, both the book and series, and I found Long Way Down to be even better than the first series.  I am now reading By Any Means. It's a solid book in itself, but is not as strong as the others.  I soon found myself getting a little bored and to motivate myself, I decided to watch the first couple episodes of the series (I usually wait till I finish the book first).  Turns out, that was  agreat decision! The show is very entertaining and excellently filmed as they've now had a lot of experience with it. I miss seeing Ewan of course, but the comradery with Russ and Mungo, the camera man, more than makes up that missing piece. (Btw, I never understood why the guys didn't like Claudio, do you get that feeling?)

Anyways, the series is fantastic if you like his former work already. I would suggest reading the books simultaneously, staying a couple of chapters ahead of the show. The book gives great detail and fills in the gaps that aren't mentioned in the show.  Also, it reflects their mental state and makes the experience much more profound!",1430784000,2,1286,4.4743589743589745
8277304,4,B001AGNFY6,"Before I start my review of the series I'd say that watching this on DVD is the way to go. This kind of adventure should seem epic and long, put it on and watch 3 episodes back to back. Not in a weekly form. I found Long Way Down much better on DVD than on TV due to this. Oh and one more thing, it's not as good as Ewan McGregor And Charley Boorman - Long Way Round [Special Edition] [2004], few shows are, so don't expect it to be.

So, it's Charley on his own, but not for the first time. Charley Boorman - Race to Dakar follows Charley as he and his team enter the infamous Dakar Rally. In this Charley has to show his abilities as a Biker and presenter, good training for By Any Means.

By Any Means is a different adventure altogether. Gone are the BMW motorbikes, replaced by over 100 different types of transport as Charley goes from Ireland to Australia 'by any means'. Really this is one big, nerdy transport documentary, showing how people move around the world, talking more about machines than cultures. This isn't a documentary about soaking up cultures as per the previous outings. Things get trickier as the series goes on, climaxing in a some dangerous events in the last episode.

Charley does well, he's obviously a good guy and is willing to show all to the camera (literally). This is more like your mate going on an adventure than a TV/Film star, which is By Any Mean's charm.

I've enjoyed it on TV and even more so on DVD.",1273968000,11,1446,4.324723247232472
