One thing, though: the orangutan was gimmicky.  The script could have gotten along just fine without it.  The film would probably have been more insightful if it had ditched the ape and the slapstick.

But no, wasn't meant to be. These movies come on two discs (one movie on each disc) with nothing else.

My DVD versions of these movies, look better than these blu-rays do!!!
I still can't believe there wasn't anything else on the discs but the movies themselves (just like the DVDs).

The sound on the original DVDs is much better, without the added on sound effects from Philo's fights, etc.
I believe some of the movies are missing pieces here on the blu-ray. I haven't bothered yet to make sure of this, but you can bet I'll soon be playing the DVDs on my computer while simultaneously playing these blu-ray versions on the TV to find out for sure.

These blu-rays just look fuzzier (not as sharp) as the DVDs.

Warner, you've proven you cannot be trusted to put out a quality blu-ray product... It'll be a long time if ever that I buy another Warner blu-ray without verifying WHAT it contains and reading the reviews first.

2763834,4,B000A85TSK,"We love Clint Eastwood, still going strong as a true cinematic artist now in his 80s.  But he was never funnier or more natural on screen than when played laid-back brawling trucker and straight man to Clyde the orangutan.  Eastwood's Phillip Beddoe is on a search for his lost love (Sandra Locke) and he gets into all kinds of trouble at various stops on the road.  That's about it for plot.  But somehow it all works.  Like a Laurel & Hardy movie but here it's Phil & Clyde.  And really, they are both monkeys!  And Clyde's the smarter one.

I happened to see Eastwood and then real-life girlfriend Locke in a Sherman Oaks Hughes market one Sunday morning.  He was pushing a squeaky shopping cart and stopped to pick out some cucumbers.  Locke berated him on his choice, put them back and carefully examined several replacements that apparently better fit her culinary requirements.  He patiently listened to her verbose lecture.  I felt sorry for him.  When she was finally finished, he hung his head and ambled off pushing his skidding cart.  No one was around, but I turned my face away in shame and sympathy.  The movie was killed by the critics but was a huge success at the box office - as it deserved.  Still funny, it spawned a less funny sequel.  And Eastwood and Locke split after a rancorous exchange of legal charges.",1319328000,,1331,4.595744680851064

This is just ""one of those"" movies I've seen 100 times and will likely see 100 more. The pic quality beyond that short opening sequence (which is really bad) is a lot better than I remember it.. easily a 4 overall, but I have to give the movie a ""personal"" 5 out of 5;)

Any Which Way You Can - I really didn't expect this to be unwatchable.. but thats how it turned out. I lasted 30 minutes with this. ""Every"" somehow blended Clyde the ape into an obvious and yet subtle ""sidekick"" - ""Any"" has him front and center, as though he's the star and it really turns a friendship into slapstick, and makes the movie far sillier and campy than is necessary. This facet of the movie seems like it came from a ""focus group"".

Then they pair Philo (Clint) back up with Lynne Halsey Taylor (Sandra Locke)! The very same hustling *itch that was revealed to be nothing more than trash. I was ready to see new characters in this sequel but could not tolerate seeing the original movie degraded in the process. No way he'd ever have anything to with LHT ever again, and that's the way I need to leave it.

So, I guess I'll just have to put ""Every Which Way But Loose"" out in the used Blu-Ray bin because what I really wanted was ""Any Which Way You Can"" more than the other.  This is one of those rare occasions where the follow-up movie was better than the original.

To throw caution to the wind, I see that ""Babe"" is just now getting released on Blu-Ray, but ""Babe: Pig in The City"" is not yet released.  So, through this experience with these Clint Eastwood films, I'm going to wait for the two ""Babe"" films to be available in a two-fer set.  I'm not particularly crazy about buying a movie twice just to get the second movie.

So, Clint, you've made some money out of me again this time because I have to buy ""Every Which Way But Loose"" again, and I'm not particularly crazy about that movie.
