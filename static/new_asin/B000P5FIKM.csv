2811573,5,B000P5FIKM,"The predictions surrounding the ominous date of December 21st, 2012 are plentiful and often a bit ""freaky"". This video is a delightful exception! We follow a personal journey of discovery across the USA as Sharron Rose gets in her car in the Northwest forests and ventures cross-country (and across time!) through beautiful scenery and amazing scenarios. Her travels are punctuated with discussions traversing mostly unfamiliar - and FASCINATING - facts and theories based on little known historical artifacts, ancient structures and writings of learned philosophers and religious adventurers. These well-respected scholars and writers enlighten us to The Mysteries that have been ""hidden""...which means that they simply have not been included in our mediocre educational system which typically focuses on the generic and mundane. After my first viewing, I immediately watched it again as it was filled with so much new information, I wanted to take more time to both understand these amazing revelations and to let the beauty of the positive options for our collective future presented ""sink in"". The quality of the film was outstanding and I fell in love with our guide Sharron. Having viewed MANY dvds featuring 2012 possibilities, I say this one is by far the best, especially for those who are just discovering the 2012 ""prophecies"".  If there was ONE dvd on the 2012 phenomena to watch/buy...this is it !",1187913600,110,1410,5.266666666666667
2811574,5,B000P5FIKM,"Wow this film had a lot of deep and important information. It is so packed full of insights into the immense changes that are taking place in our world that I have watched it a number of times. Each time it seems to offer new revelations in a very rich yet subtle way.  Don't miss it, for it will take you to another level of awareness of the reasons behind the earth changes and chaotic social and political turmoil that seem to be increasing every day.",1187654400,3,454,4.27906976744186
2811575,5,B000P5FIKM,"I showed this DVD to a group of friends and acquaintances, and it was unanimously well received. The fact that several well known New Age thinkers and speakers were included gave the film added credibility. We all appreciated the positive message that we, as humans living on planet Earth, can choose to make 2012 the doorway to a golden age. We are not bound to go through more hell on earth unless we choose it. The film reminds us that we are now being given a loving wake up call by the Universe.",1185667200,15,500,4.387096774193548
2811576,5,B000P5FIKM,"For anyone who is deeply concerned about the future of the planet, I highly recommend this film.

Writer/director Sharron Rose, went out on a quest for the meaning and import underlying the prophesies around the year 2012. She interviewed many of the leading writers and experts on the subject and brought together their knowledge in a very deep and moving way, for they spoke of the profound changes that are coming for all of us from an intellectual, spiritual and practical perspective. Whereas many of these type of documentaries focus on the fear factor, while it  does not skirt the issues that are in front of us, 2012 The Odyssey puts them in a larger historical context and shows us that even though things may seem dark and chaotic, there is light at the end of the tunnel and we need not despair. In fact, it is a very kind and hopeful film.

In addition to the excellent interviews, towards the end, the film unveils the message of the mysterious Georgia Guidestones. Probably built by the Masons, or could it be the Illuminati or New World Order, this Stonehenge like monument offers a message for the future that is both frightening and fascinating. As Sharron says, this message which is like some new form of the Ten Commandments certainly gives one a lot to think about.

From the depth of the interviews, to the meeting with the Inka Elders and their prophesy that a new species is being birthed , to the concept of the noosphere and the teachings of Teilhard de Charden, this film is packed full of juicy information. I have watched it many times now with friends and family and every time I learn something new.",1184457600,62,1631,4.633217993079585
2811577,5,B000P5FIKM,"One of those movies that you want to watch several times. The concepts and arguments are thoughtfully laid out and wonderfully articulated. The subjects interviewed are living legends and being able to hear their thoughts on a profoundly important topic makes this movie a gem. The content will astound you and forever change your perception on the Mayan Calendar and the countdown to 2012. This isn't a doomsday, end-of-the-world panic-fest, in fact it is quite the opposite. It is inspiring and hopeful. Simply brilliant.",1184198400,5,523,5.238095238095238
2811578,5,B000P5FIKM,This is powerful material and I feel that it was well done.  I feel that they made salient points that are important topics.  This helped illuminate the 2012 topic and opened up a dialogue for the next few years.  The footage was good and the speakers were excelent and very sincere.,1184198400,3,283,4.509803921568627
2811579,5,B000P5FIKM,"Should inspire many, like myself, to focus on 2012 as a fantastic opportunity to manifest a wondrous change in the direction humanity takes.....",1183766400,4,144,5.304347826086956
2811580,3,B000P5FIKM,The information was excellent but the movie dragged. It was difficult to keep focused.  I will watch the movie again but break it up into shorter sessons so that I can concentrate on all the details. I will also let my children watch it in 15 minute sessions so they will be able to get the message.,1182816000,5,299,4.245614035087719
2811581,5,B000P5FIKM,"This is a DVD presentation that ""connects the dots -- and dashes"" of Mayan calendars and cosmology and integrates them into The Big Picture. As a collector of wisdom teachings from around the globe, this is now at the top of my Five Star A-List. Equally, I can see this is a must have for folks that want to share these insights with others but have lacked the resources -- time, energy, talent -- heretofore. Do yourself a favor and get this information into your consciousness, and turn your lights on fully, before our house lights go out in the flash of a coronal mass ejection that melts down our high-tech society power grid in Solar Cycle 24!

2811602,5,B000P5FIKM,"To anyone willing to learn more about 2012, this is the movie to watch. Not the upcoming blockbuster film, not the doomsday-predicting videos on Youtube. The people interviewed in this film make it very clear that 2012 is not the end of the world, but rather the end of A world and the dawning of an age where human consciousness will rise above fear and suffering. This movie will help you understand why you must open your mind to a new reality and how you can start making changes right now to make a better future for our children.",1239494400,4,535,4.414141414141414
2811603,5,B000P5FIKM,"2012 resonates strongly with the soul. If you are already awake, you will understand the message being sent in this film. The various speakers who share their insights encourage  growth within, and enable us to see more clearly that change is coming. Its wonderful to know that a critical mass IS forming. This is so exciting.!!! Excellent film. Enjoy. Looking forward to 2013.",1238889600,7,377,4.984126984126984
2811604,5,B000P5FIKM,"Sharron Rose has brought together some of the finest minds in this video to share with us the prophecies of 2012. From all of these people come the same opinions, warnings and guidance about what lies ahead for the planet as the Mayan calendar ends on the winter solstice, 2012. This and the sequel, 2013, are well worth the money. I think you'll find yourself watching them repeatedly, as its just about impossible to glean everything therein with one viewing.",1235952000,4,461,4.775
2811605,5,B000P5FIKM,"By design, this is not a pop-culture, fast-cut video for people with short attention spans. Rather, it moves gently like a guided meditation (backed by an etheric musical soundtrack no less) for those ready to hear a heart-opening message of spiritual ascension. Sharron Rose's calm and soothing voice all but invites you to sit back, take a few deep breaths, and truly ponder what so many cultures throughout history have deduced... that as we near the fateful year of 2012, humanity will be faced with a choice like no other in history. Our material world is destabilizing at an accelerating rate, challenging us to ponder what will follow: Are we doomed? Or, as the scholars and spiritualists in this video suggest, is this just the painful birth process necessary to deliver us to a plane of true higher awareness? You should not be surprised to learn that the choice between humanity's extinction or ascension will be (as it has always been) up to us.

If you need to have your 2012 fears confirmed with a titillating piece of fluff, you can watch that any day on the History Channel or YouTube. But if your spirit is sending out a message of hope that your brain is just now beginning to understand, this video will help keep the channels of communication between the two open. Highly recommended.

2811607,5,B000P5FIKM,"I just had the opportunity to watch this fascinating and mind expanding film and it's powerful sequel TIMEWAVE 2013.
Bringing prophesis together from many of the world's ancient traditions concerning the events that will occur around the year 2012, I was amazed to see how relevant these predictions were to the events taking place in the world today, the economic meltdown, global warming, the health care crisis and much more. The final sections on the Founding Fathers and a strange Masonic monument called the Georgia Guidestones provoked my interest and desire to look more deeply into these subjects. I highly recommend this film.",1226707200,8,636,5.184466019417476
2811608,4,B000P5FIKM,"There is no point in me repeating the details of what is contained in this documentary. Some of the other reviewers have covered that quite well. My only contribution here would be in the form of a recommendation. I would recommend this film to anyone who is new to the subject of the Mayan calendar end-date of December 21,2012. It is a good introduction to the subject and the people who are interviewed (Gregg Braden, Geoff Stray, Jose Arguelles, John Major Jenkins, etc)are among the most knowledgeable - and, in my opinion, among the most credible - researchers on this topic.

2811609,3,B000P5FIKM,"Good information, I've heard a lot of info about 2012, the first time I heard was from the PSYCH-K book that said a computer model at MIT showed that great human discoveries go off the chart at none other than the year 2012, same year that the Mayan calendar stops.  So I've been interested in learning more.  This video does a good job of putting out some information but I kinda felt like I was left hanging to some degree.  It hit a lot of different things from different angles and I just had an overall lack of flow feel to it.

I had never heard about the landmark down in Georgia and found that interesting but could see no connection to 2012 with it.  I think the interview with Gregg Braden was one of the better parts and I agree with him that the 2012 marks the start of a new beginning and we're going through the change right now.

Don't let my low 3 star rating keep you from viewing the DVD, I have no regrets in watching it, it's just not the higher quality product I would give a higher star rating.",1210550400,39,1016,4.184615384615385
2811610,5,B000P5FIKM,"As someone new to the topic of 2012, I found this documentary to be extremely inspiring.  The quality of the exposition of the subject matter was excellent.  The experts interviewed are extremely insightful concerning the great changes that are happening right now on our planet.  I really liked the fact that it was a woman's odyssey.  Director Sharron Rose's commentary spoke to my heart.  With so much fear and negativity in the world right now concerning the future it is a pleasure to be exposed to a positive perspective.  I would recommend this film to anyone wanting to explore the metaphysics and prophecies surrounding 2012.",1209686400,5,634,4.9904761904761905
2811611,5,B000P5FIKM,"With all of the current media doomsday hype and sensationalism concerning 2012 it is refreshing and inspiring to see two films, 2012 the Odyssey and its beautiful sequel Timewave 2013&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Timewave-2013-The-Future-Is-Now-The-Odyssey-II/dp/B001EWVEIA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Timewave 2013: The Future Is Now - The Odyssey II</a>that clearly speak to the real issues that we are facing as human beings. In addition, rather than focusing on the ""fear factor"" and the ""end of the world"", these films offer an opportunity for audiences to wake up from the cultural trance imposed upon us and take responsibility for our future.

2012 The Odyssey is a very informative and intelligent film. It was the first film concerning the subject and in my opinion, clearly the best. The interviews are excellent and gave me much food for thought. It is a film that can be watched and savoured many times. I was taken with the director's journey to discover the prophecies around the year 2012 and her deep concern over what is happening socially, environmentally and psychologically. Are we reaching the end of time? I don't know but this film is certainly a wake up call.",1203206400,4,1229,5.572192513368984
2811622,3,B000P5FIKM,"The DVD is put together as a patchwork of interviews with philosophers and writers around the meaning of the 2012 phenomenon and the spritual, psychological and sociological repercusions of the changes that it will bring.  However, someone with more appetite for the astronomical and mathematical facts backing the '2012 Cataclismic Theory' (especially the Mayan or Egyptian numbers) will be disappointed.",1203120000,5,405,5.75
2811623,4,B000P5FIKM,"If you know nothing of the 2012 prophecies then this is a good video for you.  The movie was slow in some parts but overall, I felt it explained the 2012 scenario and some of the opinions that surround it pretty well. I have seen several DVD's on this subject and this one is realtively unbiased and not a doomsday version like some that are out there.  A great little movie for your spiritual collection.",1201046400,8,405,4.386666666666667
2811624,5,B000P5FIKM,"I found this film to be extremely interesting and enlightening. I wasn't aware of the fact that the Mayan calendar ends in 2012. It ties in perfectly with what the Judeo-Christians have been saying about the ""end of the times"". I highly recommend seeing this film and telling others about it after you do. I was also unaware of the existence of the stones she visits in her travels. How many people are aware that these exist and why haven't they received more publicity? This is amazing. This film is a must-see for all truth seekers everywhere.",1197590400,4,546,4.639175257731959
2811625,5,B000P5FIKM,I have been looking at the subject of 2012 for quite some time and I was exceedingly happy to see many of the leading researchers on the subject interviewed in such a meaningful way.  This is a film that needs to be watched numerous times as the information is high quality and important.  This is not a dogmatic film forcing a particular viewpoint down your throat.  The speakers vary on what will happen in 2012 leaving a balanced perspective to the viewer.  A great introduction to the subject.  I am looking forward to the sequel.,1196985600,4,534,4.578947368421052
2811626,5,B000P5FIKM,"You've heard the murmur of people talking about the ""End Times"" and the significant changes due to happen in 2012. Watch ""2012: The Odyssey"" and gain another perspective. Gain an understanding that indeed people are talking and transformation is indeed occurring. All of the time! We are leading up to a place of awareness and there will be culmination, as prophetized by the Mayan calendar and supported by modern thinkers and Andean Shamans, that indeed in 2012, existence as we know it will be changed. Illuminated humans is the hopeful result. Greater sympathy with our world's ecology will lead us in the right direction. Watch this video and hear modern man interpret the ancient message of God.",1196726400,5,701,5.0
2811627,5,B000P5FIKM,"I was vaguely aware about the importance of the date with regard to the Mayan calendar and that there was some cosmic, astronomic aspect as well.  This movie brought so much of that vague knowledge into sharp focus.  It made me interested enough to read some of the writings by the various interviewees (and interviewer).
The most startling thing to me was the very positive approach -- this is not an 'end of the world' scenario.  It offers a very hopeful vision of what can be if we have the strength and courage to make it so.
I have to admit I got tired of looking at the car as the narrator made her odyssey, but I never tired of the shots of the forests and mountains she traveled through -- and she's got a great hat!
I would recommend this to anyone looking for an introduction to these mysteries surrounding 2012.  It will focus your search in a very positive  and life-affirming way.",1196553600,47,893,4.420731707317073
2811628,5,B000P5FIKM,"As an eighteen year old who is concerned about the future of the planet and humanity I was touched on a very deep level by the beauty and message of 2012 The Odyssey. Director Sharron Rose interviews experts on the subject who have done a tremendous amount of research  on the  Mayan calendar and  other prophesies from many traditions. Their message speaks to my heart as well as my mind. I was especially moved by the words of Alberto Villoldo and Jay Weidner concerning the issues that confront us and power that we have within us to shape our future.

I am so tired of the doom and gloom, fear-based  programs that  are presented on the mainstream  television.  The way that they are edited seems to touch only on the superficial and sensational aspects of our world. 2012 The Odyssey is different.  It sheds new light on the issues of our times  and offers a new vision of possibility for us. As Alberto says in the film, it is time for us all to wake up from our ""cultural trance"" and come together to create a world of harmony and beauty.

I love nature. The beauty of the forest, the greenery, the animals and the streams,  gives me  peace of mind and joy. I am saddened by the fact that people these days do not seem to care about our natural environment. I am concerned about the destruction of the environment and wonder what the future holds in store for my generation. So I was pleased to discover in the film the final statement written on the Georgia Guidestones, "" Leave room for nature, leave room for nature.""  I wish there were more films like this one.",1195948800,15,1572,4.43205574912892

Much of the information presented seemed a bit questionable and not really backed up with anything real.  Although there are a few good moments in this film and a few good guests who make a few intelligent points (Jose Arguellas, Greg Braden, Alberto Villodo),
most of the film is filled with new age spiritual foo-foo....stuff like a rich English woman sitting in her mansion next to her expensive life size statue of Anubis telling us what she thinks is going to happen on Dec 21 2012, and basically unrelated subjects such as the Georgia guidestones.

Hippies love to say nonsensical mystical incoherent psuedo-profound statements because then you can't refute it. It's impossible to nail down any concrete meaning to whatever these people are saying. This DVD doesn't reveal anything you haven't heard before from this crowd. Some of what I found includes garbage like ""Mayan calendar,"" ""progression,"" ""planetary gestation,"" ""challenge authority,"" ""cosmic energy,"" ""layers of reality,"" ""power of belief,"" ""ending of cycles,"" ""conscious shift,"" ""galactic synchronization."" Western society and religion are primitive and destructive and the truly mature and enlightened will not be satisfied with such trivial perspectives. Those who don't quantum leap into who we are becoming in 2012 will suffer for it. Everything comes from the same source, we're all made from the same energy. In 2012 humans will become telepathic. They will lose their individuality and through them the Earth will attain consciousness. We are so worried about losing our possessions and that's why we have walls and armies and police.

This DVD is such a joke and a waste of time. My copy was given to me. Thank goodness I didn't pay any money for it! After I watched it I through it in the trash were it belongs and where it came from. Bottom line; NOTHING IS GOING TO HAPPEN IN 2012! Stop soiling your pants over it. Life will go on just as it always has. Just because some dude has long hair and/or a beard doesn't mean he has anything profound to say. The 60's are over!

8189053,1,B000P5FIKM,"This amateurishly shot and rather poorly edited film, does not have much to offer those who already have some familiarity with this subject and it is not clear and organized enough to serve as a good introduction for those who do not.

The description on the DVD sleeve which I received from Netflix stated that ""this documentary explores the metaphysical reasons for modern humankind's fascination with apocalypse"". Unfortunately it doesn't really do anything of the kind.

Sharron Rose, the narrator, seems to wander through the film in a sleepy daze, albeit an apparently happy and blissful one. She repeatedly gets sidetracked on things with essentially no bearing at all on 2012 such as the Georgia Guidestones -- an anonymously built, Stonehenge-like monument in that state -- and even by some paintings or murals on the walls of the Denver airport! Her narration attempts to make these things seem Significant and filled with Cosmic Import, but really that just makes them seem all the more ridiculous. There is also too much time devoted to close-up shots of her driving down the road in her silver Ford or whatever it is.

Although some interesting subjects are touched upon, they are generally not examined with any depth. Too much time is spent, both by Rose and those she interviews, on trite platitudes everyone has heard countless times and which, while perhaps unobjectionable, do not serve to actually inform or enlighten the viewer.

Most of the interview subjects are, I believe, far more interesting and have far more to say than comes across in this movie. Actually, probably the most interesting and thought-provoking parts of the move are recordings, played at the beginning and end of the film, of the late Terence McKenna, to whom the film is dedicated.

Fortunately, however, these days one can follow up on any of the subjects mentioned and on the interviewees themselves on the Internet. Actually, far more knowledge on this subject in a far more coherent form can probably be gained in the equivalent amount of time by simply reading and watching interviews on this subject on the Internet rather than watching this in the first place.",1295654400,7,2163,4.997222222222222

Wouldn't there still be people left behind, stuck in the old thinking. In other words why does anyone think it will be noticeable?
