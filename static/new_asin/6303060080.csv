565764,5,6303060080,"A true TV gem. A terrific beginning propels the viewer into the evil world of a risen vampire.  It is successful without all the modern special effects fan fare which marks today's films.  There were obviously high production values and solid direction.  This one you take seriously as lineage to the Lugosi era.  The casting is a coup.  Richard Lynch forces you to  shudder as he ably depicts pure evil.  I view this at least once a year and it has been on loan to many friends who all agree that it takes its place in any one's collection.  E.G. Marshall and Jason Miller play well off one another's leads, and there are several scary encounters to keep you wide-eyed and awake. You will not be disappointed as ""Vampire"". keeps the classical interpretaion alive.",1289433600,2,764,4.649253731343284
565765,4,6303060080,"Excellent movie with the most delicious vampire ever created. From the totally evil villian to the visible downfall of his victims, Richard Lynch was made to play this part. Even though it was made for television, it really was ahead of it's time in that the ""hokiness"" one generally finds in 'made-for-tv', is absent for the most part.

We already know the plot: long lost vamp rises into a modern world and proceeds to make it his own. No surprises, just some shivers and appreciation of Lynch.",1244246400,6,496,4.7011494252873565
565766,4,6303060080,"This movie was nearly impossible to find. While the quality was not great, I was so glad to find it at all.",1228089600,5,107,3.909090909090909
565767,5,6303060080,"This has been a favorite of mine since I saw it as a kid when it first aired on TV.  Actually a backdoor pilot for a proposed series, the story holds up quite well on its own.  Richard Lynch plays what could've been a standard stereotypical vampire role (seduce and slay) and does a great job; making him a charismatic figure, but never letting the viewer forget that he is, first and foremost, a killer. The scene where he races from the police station across town as sun is about to rise, smoke starting to billow from his body, is quite striking. Certainly, it has the look and feel of its time, but that doesn't detract from its style.

I've always regretted that this never became a series (like Night Stalker did).",1113523200,11,720,4.4393939393939394
565768,4,6303060080,"I think I've seen just about every well-known [and several not-so-well-known ones, this one included] movie about the legendary bloodsucking Count Dracula or his cousins, but this one gives a slant to the old tired plot that doesn't get a lot of attention: vampire as Rotten S.O.B. Extraordinary.  Even Bram Stoker in his novel gives the Count a moment of pity at the end of his tale-- a look of relief and peace as the stake is driven in into his heart at the very end.  Ever since then we've seen tormented vampires who hate the evil that they must do to survive, their terrible lonliness and separation from the rest of humanity.  Only the very old ""Nosferatu"", made in the 20's, created a real villian.  And he was ugly to boot.  The old Hammer films with Christopher Lee also created the vampire as a good-old-fashioned villian, but who had a dark attraction that he was able to make good use of.  It was, all the same, the kind of attraction, the horrified fascination, for his victims like that of a deer caught in the headlights of a fast-moving train.
Here, in this treatment, we have a vampire who is so totally without any bit of good in him that he is truly Evil.  He is a Fiend, blood dripping from his fangs [which we never see].  His vengeance is so horrible on the people who stand in his way that is it reminiscent of Jack the Ripper.  It goes without saying that this vampire has enormous, even overpowering sex appeal, but it also is plain that his female tools or victims [usually both] are no important to him than lab rats.  He is a serial killer more than the quasi-romantic image of the good man who happens to be a vampire; his killings are not the result of some awful childhood or catastrophic emotional event.  He is a monster.  Our sympathises are not with him, but with his victims.
Real monster movies are actually rather rare.  This is one of them, and even though the posse of vampire killers are such flat and 2-D characters that it makes the vampire look complex by comparison, the film is worth watching for its different treatment of the vampire as villian.  Richard Lynch, who is far from conventionally handsome, has a horrifying way of grabbing your attention and keeping it squarely on him.  It's partly the fascination of the rabbit by the cobra, but also the unconscious fear of the power of sexual attraction.  The novel ""Dracula"" fairly pants with sexual heat all through it, to an amzaing degree considering it's overwrought, even purplish Victorian prose.  The Victorian age was famous for it's amnesiac denial of sexual drives, while the studied avoidance even vague sexual terms in polite conversation [""limb"" vs. ""leg""] drew attention to it...the 12-foot aligator in the living room.  In this case, it's the 6-ft naked sexual aggression of a man-like beast.  You'd like to ignore it, but you can't.  This is the jet engine that drives the immense popularity of the vampire myth.  This movie, unlike many of it's kind, lets you feel the power.
I wish this movie was available for purchase.  It hardly airs on TV anymore.  No true vampire/Dracula afficianado should count his or her education complete without seeing it.",974160000,19,3168,4.668468468468468

7838246,5,6303060080,"Maybe not the best vampire movie ever, but certainly above average for a TV movie. I was thrilled to find this! The last time I saw this was when it originally aired...around 1979. I thought it was awesome back then.",1453852800,2,216,4.425

7838248,4,6303060080,A had a vhs copy of this and saw it on tv in the 70s. It scared the heck out of me when I was a kid and always liked having a blond headed vampire as a twist. Jason Miller best know for his fantastic role as the doomed priest in the excorcist is great in whatever he plays in and the chemistry between him and Lynch is terrific in this one. My only complaint? Where the heck is the DVD?,1433808000,,386,3.7777777777777777
7838249,4,6303060080,"Very good made-for-TV vampire film.  Supposedly a pilot to a proposed series that didn't take.  In modern-day (1979) California, San Francisco I think, a young professional couple is menaced by a charismatic, sexy vampire.  Richard Lynch plays a great vampire.  Worth seeing, worth getting.  I have the VHS tape, but I hope a good quality DVD is released very soon.",1423872000,3,365,5.016666666666667

7838251,4,6303060080,This story is classically paced and the character of the title has been reported as Lynch's favorite character.  A very good vampire movie in the 1970s tradition.  But still not out on DVD?!!!,1386374400,3,192,4.787878787878788
7838252,5,6303060080,"A classy, scary T.V. movie that is absolutely underrated and a lost classic. I would say this even if I didn't have a cousin in the cast (Barrie Youngfellow is a distant cousin of mine; we don't socialize).
A memorable line from the movie comes from a friend of the protagonist: ""What was your plan? Beat him up or beat him dead?"" (This was spoken disapprovingly, BTW)",1384473600,3,368,4.507462686567164

7838254,4,6303060080,"The death of Richard Lynch has reminded me of what a guilty pleasure this used to be (when I could manage to find it). It modernized the vampire tale without losing the classic elements - the vampire's ability to seduce and manipulate his victims, his need for a ""helper,"" his lack of conscience, and his specific vulnerabilities - to daylight as well as the stake. No glitter vampires here, and no fitting into society or finding redemption....  This is vampire as terrifying predator, a thing that needs to be destroyed... but also, a very sexual predator. I enjoyed the chase (and Lynch smoking in the dawn) but I didn't really want him to be caught, as I wanted more episodes from this pilot that never became a series.

In all the vampire stories that don't involve Dracula, there are only three that have really engaged me: Hammer's ""Brides of Dracula"" (another seductive blond vampire!), the Richard Lynch version, and - for something completely different but still following the classic ""rules"" even if the sunlight takes awhile to act and the vampire has a conscience - the delightful and inventive ""Moonlight,"" which was frustratingly cancelled just when everyone I knew had gotten hooked on it. It's too bad ""Vampire"" is the only one not out on DVD!",1340755200,5,1260,4.828703703703703
