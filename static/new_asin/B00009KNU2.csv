I tried to buy this from 3 sellers, the first two offered it and then said it was out of stock. It's not on Netflix or Amazon. It wasn't at the library. Where's Blockbuster when I need them? No matter, the third store came won the day.
Werner Herzog's best non-epic, non-Klaus Kinski masterpiece, it's a dreamwalk in the salad days of the Reich as seen thru the eyes of a Jewish strongman performing as Siegfried the aryan hero. Add to the mix Tim Roth as an unhistorical Erik Hanussen whose wiki page alone deserves a long look by lovers of occult charlatans and Weimer goofiness.",1513641600,,725,4.541984732824427
