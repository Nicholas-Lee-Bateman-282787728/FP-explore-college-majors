8600933,4,B00002EPGD,If you are a fan of the WWF that gos way back like I do. You might remember this cool and funny cartoon from 1985. Hulk Hogans Rock N Wrestling was about the good guys Hulk Hogan  Andre the Giant  Junkyard Dog  Hillbilly Jim  Tito Santana  Jimmy Superfly Snuka  Capt. Lou Albano and Wendi Richter. That do Battle with the bad guys Roddy Piper  Big John Studd  the Iron Sheik  Nikolai Volkoff  the Fabulous Moolah and Mr. Fuji. None of the Wrestlers did the voice for there own Character. But did do Live-Action comedy skits with announcer Mean Gene Okerlund who allso is in the cartoon. This one has 3 comedy skits on it 2 with the very funny Roddy Piper and 1 with Capt. Lou Albano.,989971200,4,683,4.307086614173229
8600934,4,B00002EPGD,A great piece of 80's history.  This cheesy wrestling cartoon is a scream throughout.  The antics of a badly drawn Hulk Hogan mixed with rock and roll--please....a great way to remember the old days when wrestling was fun  and not oversexed homophobic misogyny.,961977600,3,261,5.023255813953488
8600935,3,B00002EPGD,"As a child of the 80's, I have very fond memories of this cartoon, and was extremely excited to order it.  Granted, upon viewing for the first time in 15 years, the show was a lot cheesier than I remembered, but it was still a  fun trip down memory lane.  If you weren't around for the original run of  the cartoon, you probably won't be too impressed, but if you enjoyed it as  a kid, it's worth a look to bring back a bit of those old Saturday  mornings, when kid's shows were worth watching.",953251200,4,494,4.147368421052631
