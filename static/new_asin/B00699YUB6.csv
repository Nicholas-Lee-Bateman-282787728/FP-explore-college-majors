8495232,4,B00699YUB6,Ultrarare TV series in Europe - and for fantasy fans a MUST-HAVE-ONE - for me miles better than Hercules and nearly on the same level than Xena. It's a pity that there were only two seasons (with two different females main actors; for each season one) but nevertheless the complete series still has 44 parts with 42 minutes each running time - plenty time enough for fun and light entertainment for such a low price,1408752000,,415,4.546666666666667
8495233,5,B00699YUB6,"i loved it, my item came to me when they said it would, i have loved this tv show since it was on tv, i think everyone who likes magic, sorcery, and the supernatural things, should watch it.",1403827200,,190,4.026315789473684
8495234,5,B00699YUB6,Both seasons played without a problem.  All disc's were in excellent condition.  The cases were great as well. Really enjoyed,1396483200,,125,5.2
8495235,5,B00699YUB6,"You start to get a little bit amused at how many giant animals you see in this series, and then in later episodes you see creatures of smaller size that look strikingly identical to their giant counterparts. But the relationship of the crew and the shots of the sea, and the story and truth these epic tales reveal is whats so worth it!!!",1380412800,2,338,4.380952380952381
8495236,5,B00699YUB6,"This was one of my favorite Syfy Network series when it was first broadcast, and watching the episodes of this show all these years later was a pleasure!  I had forgotten how good some of the special effects were (for the time in which they were created), and There are surprise appearances by some of the ""classical"" monsters/demons/creatures that plagued Sinbad in the earlier action movies and even in the original tales of the wayward sailor from the Tales of 1,001 Arabian Nights.  The acting would never get any awards, but star Zen Gesner was a fantastic choice for the role of Sinbad.  He was handsome, suave, athletic and graceful, and his swordsmanship was elegant and believable.  I highly recommend both seasons.",1372636800,7,724,4.909836065573771
