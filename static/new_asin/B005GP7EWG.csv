8472124,5,B005GP7EWG,"When I was a child, back in the 1980s, when everybody still had VHS Tapes, some old friends of my Mom and Dad's taped this off the air for us on a VHS tape along with a few other Christmas movies.  And it has been a favorite ever since.  I still have the tape, but no longer have a VCR.  And I've been trying for YEARS to find it on DVD, only to discover it was no longer in print.  Well, just last year, I checked Amazon again, and lo and behold, it's been re-issued!  I am SO happy to have it back, and thinking ahead to next Christmas, I plan to buy several copies to give as Christmas presents.

A few differences from the book.  Although mentioned in the first few Babar books, the Babar and Father Christmas book did NOT mention Rataxes, the rhinoceros.  And in the book Father Christmas did, in fact get the letter that the Babar children sent him.  In the movie however, Rataxes stole and ate the letter.  Also, as I recall, Babar had a dog help him find Father Christmas in the book, whereas in the film, a map professor helped him.

I hope this timeless masterpiece never goes out of print again.  Buy all means buy it for someone young, or young at heart, whom you love, to give as a Christmas present, and encourage them to do likewise.  You'll be glad you did!",1483660800,,1273,4.210743801652892
