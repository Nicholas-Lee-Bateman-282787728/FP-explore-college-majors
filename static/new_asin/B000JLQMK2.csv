8151788,4,B000JLQMK2,"I am a 70 yr old baby boomer with arthritis in my lumbar spine.  8 months ago, I started working out with Peggy Cappy's yoga videos (which I recommend), and Anne Pringle Burnell's ""Stronger Seniors"" series - which I enjoy also.  However, I began to feel that I should occasionally do some cardio, and I didn't feel that either of these series were providing what I needed in that regard.  I also purchased a few ""chair dancing"" DVD's, but I really needed to get up off the chair and MOVE!  Enter: Rene Burton.  As we all know, nothing is perfect, so I will list my pros & cons:
Pros: This DVD gets you up and moving.  The chair is there - mostly for safety - and there are segments when you sit.  Also segments when you hold on to the back of the chair.  (Props needed are: handweights - I don't think she mentions how heavy, but they seem to be about 2 or 3 lbs - a resistance band, and a sturdy chair.) The program is not difficult, but it DOES get the circulation going!  I find I'm able to do 99% of the moves.  Kicking to the back is difficult for me, but I do what I can.
Cons:  Only one, really.  I feel she really should remind the class more often to BREATHE!  Many people inadvertently hold their breath while exercising, because it's normal to concentrate on the execution of the various aspects of the exercise.  We need to be reminded to inhale and exhale, and WHEN to do it.  I'm not saying she doesn't do it at all - she does - but not enough, in my view.  She spends more time reminding the class to smile, and telling them how wonderful they are.
A good idea would be to check your local library in order to try this out - see if it works for you.  Unfortunately, my library did not have it, so I took a chance and purchased it.",1457049600,2,1745,4.145833333333333

I was in constant pain walking and had no thought of ever dancing again until I purchased The Rene Burton, It's Never Too Late series of 3 DVDs. I have completed all Levels and now am in a daily exercise program (at home) to maintain the significant improvement in stability, balance, and endurance I achieved while completing the 3 Levels of instruction. I did not find Level 1 very difficult at all but it restored some of the flexibility I had lost in my muscles and prepared me to go into Level 2.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rene-Burton-It-s-Never-Too-Late-Healthy-Aging-Level-1-Beginner/dp/B000JLQMK2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rene Burton, It's Never Too Late, Healthy Aging Level 1 (Beginner)</a>",1174521600,9,851,5.65625
