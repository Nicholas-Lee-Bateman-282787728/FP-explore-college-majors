2424370,5,B000BM7YX8,The simple fact that you have Buddy Guy sitting down a talking and teachin' the Blues is worth 4 Stars. There IS tab in the booklet that comes with the DVD. Slo Mo feature gives you the chance to learn new licks along with Buddy. I thought it was great. Great chord section. I recommend it highly if you love the Blues and Buddy Guy,1151625600,13,332,4.123076923076923
2424371,5,B000BM7YX8,"This is the first instructional dvd i have tried i was satisfied.  the dvd does have slow motion and other great special feature options like tuning.  it also comes with all the tablature wich is right inside the case.  the dvd is great to be able to hear the music, pause and replay what you just heard.  the only problem is you have to have the time to watch and learn at the same time but over a long period of time you can play it.  its not easy material to play either but if your really practice you can learn",1137283200,7,515,4.0594059405940595
2424372,2,B000BM7YX8,"The product description for this ""instructional"" DVD is very deceiving.  I am an avid blues guitarist and HUGE fan of Buddy Guy, so I was very excited to discover this DVD.  The product description says that there is tablature, there is none.  There are no instructional parts of this DVD, Buddy is playing just like he does on stage.  I did not nor could not learn anything from this DVD.  To watch him play and see his right hand and left hand techniques is really cool, but to try to learn from and follow him in this DVD is virtually impossible unless you are a total professional.  The product description makes it sound MUCH easier than it is.  I am very disappointed.",1133568000,32,674,4.475409836065574

2424386,4,B000BM7YX8,"Copying Buddy's licks after he plays them is similar to how all the
 greats learned so I enjoyed it because I've been playing a long time.
 I called Hot Licks when they first released the VHS version and spoke
  Hot licks. I said that it sounded like hearing one
 end of a telephone conversation. They said that is exactly what happened.
 Arlen Roth was asking questions off camera that Buddy was answering
 but then Buddy insisted that the questions be not heard on the video.
 Picture yourself hearing one end of a phone call and you get the idea.
 Like I said, great if you know how to play, much better than the Otis
 Rush blues one as Buddy seems much more into it.",1376265600,4,670,4.330645161290323
2424387,5,B000BM7YX8,Great DVD- ignore the idiot who claimed there aren't any tabs- there's a 20 page tablature book inside the cover for those of you like myself that are beginners and wanting to learn some licks...,1375920000,,195,4.6
2424388,5,B000BM7YX8,Great video. The material is very worth. You got Buddy Guy playing the blues for you and if you love the blues like me you can't be disappointed.,1375660800,,145,4.214285714285714
2424389,2,B000BM7YX8,"Well, I am also a huge fan of Buddy Guy and catch his concerts when in Seattle.
Buddy does alot of talking, but very little instruction. I had high hopes for this video where he would break down technique or inspire.
I hate to say but it is not even close to Buddy Guy standards. It feels like he did no preparation and just winged it. I believe he can make a great blues playing dvd, this is not it.",1363910400,,400,4.0125
2424390,5,B000BM7YX8,"Buddy Guy is giving you several guitar lessons. It is a bit advanced in places but you have the book and Buddy shows you how to do it. In the old days the greats would eather keep listening to the record over and over or if they could ask them "" how do you do that? Well that is what you have got, . Buddy how do you do that, & He shows you! You can't get much better than having Buddy Guy as a guitar teacher. If you are a blues guitar player, get it.",1361318400,,452,3.71875

2424403,2,B000BM7YX8,"After reading other reviews of this DVD, I was looking forward to something I could really learn something from.  I was mistaken.  I've played guitar for 30 years and was wanting to add to my blues licks, but Buddy in this video doesn't play very well, and he doesn't even explain much about his technique, or his thinking about how he goes about it.  I was a bit disappointed and wished I could return it.",1272499200,,406,4.386666666666667
2424404,5,B000BM7YX8,"I've only gotten through the first example so far, but Buddy's explanations are positive and encouraging.  And just going through the first example has helped me rework a number of other songs I've been working on, so that is good times.",1250985600,,237,4.780487804878049
2424405,1,B000BM7YX8,"This is Buddy Guy doing a Master Class in blues guitar playing. While I found it fascinating to watch his technique (right hand, especially -he plays with his fingernails like a Flamenco guitarist)I am years away from being able to reap any reasonable benefits. Unfortunately, this is marketed as if it were suitable for anybody, and it clearly is only for somewhat accomplished players. The picture quality was not good, with the color balance way off: everything was purple.",1235433600,3,476,5.037974683544304
2424406,5,B000BM7YX8,"The is a fantastic DVD a must have for all guitarists. It gives you the nuts and bolts to play authentic vintage blues. Buddy lays it in your lap. The slow motion section (which does not alter pitch) is outstanding. How anyone can say anything else is beyond me, do not delay, if you want to play the blues, GET THIS DVD NOW!",1205884800,9,325,4.174603174603175
2424407,5,B000BM7YX8,"Review is about&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Buddy-Guy-Teachin-the-Blues/dp/B000BM7YX8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Buddy Guy: Teachin' the Blues</a>

I almost didn't get this DVD because of the negative review on this site.

Man! I am SO glad I didn't listen to that review and bought it anyway!
I figured it would be worth the price to watch Buddy Guy, even if it wasn't such a good teaching tool, so I ordered it. I was very pleasantly surprised.

First, It DOES come with a booklet of tablature that's tucked right in the clips of the front half of the case.

Now about the DVD; It has a ""play"" function that lets you just watch it like any other DVD, which may be all that some do. AND, it has a lesson function that lets you play each lesson individually - in either real time or slow motion and still have the right tone and sound to the notes played. In this mode there is also a box on the upper right of the lesson screen that says ""loop"" for repeating the lessons.

It also has a ""tuning"" function for getting your guitar tuned properly.

There is more that I haven't explored yet (some of the ""special features"") But I've seen enough already to know that this will be a very useful learning tool, as well as being good for watching Buddy play.

If you will listen to what he is doing and follow his instruction, there is a ton of useful stuff in this DVD to learn. You just need to stay with it like you would any lesson material. And Buddy tries to encourage you all through the video. He leaves a very good impression.

If I could contact him somehow, I'd say great job Buddy!!

Of course, if you just want to watch it and not take the time to learn, then you can do that too with the ""play"" function.",1204761600,25,1759,4.576433121019108
2424408,4,B000BM7YX8,"I have this Hot Licks video on VHS, and I really like it.  It's true he isn't playing his licks from his records, but he's teaching the blues, going back to Muddy Waters and Lightning Hopkins all the way to the I guess the 90s, by way of Jimi Hendrix and Stevie Ray Vaughn.  It's like blues music appreciation lessons...  aren't you supposed to slow down records to learn licks like the pros?

It does repeat itself, maybe Arlen Roth could of fixed the continuity, and it could put you into a trance with it's slow pace, but that's what you want music to do anyways, isn't it?",1201910400,6,576,4.305555555555555
2424409,5,B000BM7YX8,"If you're expecting a ""how to get started on the blues"" video, looks elsewhere. You should at least know the basics of blues soloing and rhythm to be able to play the stuff in this DVD. I would recommend this for mid-level players who want to expand their blues vocabulary in a way similar to the raw, pure sound of Buddy Guy.

As Buddy himself says on the video, you learn other people's stuff and eventually put in your own things, making them unique. This DVD is great for sparking ideas. It also has a lot of fingerpicking blues, something I'd like to get into.

The slow-motion section of the examples are very helpful, and Buddy's comments are spot-on and even inspiring.

Buy it!",1198627200,10,686,4.516129032258065
2424410,3,B000BM7YX8,"Boy this DVD was a real letdown in the sense that it was great to watch Buddy Guy Play but.....There was nothing to learn from it. I wanted to see the licks that inspired a young Jimmi Hendrix to play like he did. Not once on this dvd did Buddy show any usefull lead runs or turnarounds other than standard technique.
The stories he told while playing were fun to listen to but there was not enough solid playing tech to back it.
This could have been a great DVD if there were Direction to his playing.",1194825600,4,502,4.185567010309279

2424412,5,B000BM7YX8,"This dvd is not for the beginning guitarist; you need to know how to figure out what key Buddy's playing in to make sense of it. At least, that was an issue for me since I didn't have any printed tabs to go by.

Other than that though, it's basic blues that has never sounded better. What a treat to have Buddy Guy show you all of his, and some of his mentors', favorite licks. Enjoy!",1181433600,3,384,4.052631578947368

Not a ton of explanations, nor much if any accurate tab.  It is still a legendary Blues artist sitting down and showing a lot, which has value.  I think Bob Margolin's Muddy Waters DVD is better, but this is still pretty cool....",1476576000,,377,4.567164179104478
