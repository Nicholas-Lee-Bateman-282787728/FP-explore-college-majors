""Guarded Secrets"" is a really nice and touching movie, with quite a complex story and interesting characters, stupendously acted, especially by the two Irma Varrs. The dialogue got a little too sentimental for my taste, but that is typically Hungarian.

I really liked the ending: After two thirds of the film I started asking myself: how can they possibly put a sound end to this story? And they really managed to!

All in all, I found this film surprisingly watchable, much better than ""Szp napok"" by Kornl Mundrucz, which I found a little too over-the-top.",1122854400,,731,4.879032258064516
