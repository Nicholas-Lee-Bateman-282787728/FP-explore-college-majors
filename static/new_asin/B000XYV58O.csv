8325917,5,B000XYV58O,"Billy Connolly is (in my opinion) the funniest person on the planet!  Excerpts from his stand-up performances throughout New Zealand are woven into a documentary (of sorts) of Mr. Connolly traveling on his custom-built 3-wheeler during his tour of New Zealand.  Breathtaking countryside, interesting anecdotes and tidbits about the places in New Zealand that he visits.  Highly recommended!",1512345600,,390,5.689655172413793

8325920,5,B000XYV58O,"He visits many of the well-known NZ sights and experiences, but he's also managed to dig up some off-the-beaten-path, little-known gems.

If you're a New Zealander, you will love this.

If you live elsewhere in the world, it will be a great introduction to New Zealand.

The tourism segments are interspersed with comedy segments from the shows he put on in NZ whilst he was there. If you object to graphic sexual references or strong profanity (which are hallmarks of Billy Connolly's comedy), ***DO NOT BUY THIS***.",1394582400,2,517,4.919540229885057
8325921,5,B000XYV58O,"This is a great way to see a different country. My husband had seen it in the past and loved it, as he is from NZ. I bought it for him as a gift to remember the home he left behind and for me to see where he is from. It was great.",1372896000,2,230,3.358490566037736
