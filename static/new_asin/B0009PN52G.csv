8064848,1,B0009PN52G,I bought this when my kids were little.  I am going through some things to get rid of and kind of remembered not liking this video.  I am watching it again now and it's going through the numbers and when it shows a number it only shows one picture of the item almost every time no matter if it's a 2-10.  This seems confusing to me!  It's also strange that they put learning numbers with learning time on the same dvd.  Numbers might be for 1-2 year olds and time would be for kindergarten or 1st graders.  The music portion is very poorly done too. It's all very boring.  I don't even dare give my dvd to goodwill.  I don't want anyone else to waste money on this.,1284768000,,665,4.140625
8064849,1,B0009PN52G,"This movie is of horrible quality.  It looks like someone used free clipart and a home computer to put together the video.  The counting portion is confusing.  For example, they will put up the number 4 and say, ""4 cows mooing"" when a picture of one cow is on the screen. The musical instruments portion is narrarated pictures and very boring. I'm still looking for a great math video for my preschooler, but this one is not even close.",1120608000,9,436,4.493670886075949
8064850,4,B0009PN52G,"This is extremely primitive video. But for my autistic kid it is a choice number 1, expecially ""Telling Time"" part. She was not just watching it - she is actually learning from it. You never know!",1115424000,,196,4.472222222222222
8064851,3,B0009PN52G,"I thought the video was boring but my son (2 1/2 years old) sat and watched it.  It says a letter name, sound and words that use the letter.  It will even spell the words for you.  I thought the color portion was very poor.  I did enjoy the shape portion of the video.  I would purchase it again at a discount price.",1095724800,,316,3.9523809523809526
