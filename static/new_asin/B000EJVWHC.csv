8110702,5,B000EJVWHC,This Finley-Holiday video is great both before you visit (to suggest where to go) and after (to remind you of what you saw).,1400976000,,124,4.434782608695652
8110703,2,B000EJVWHC,"Although this particular release is not available anymore, the video on this disk is the same being currently sold in the National Parks on the ""new"" 2012 release DVD. I bought mine at Zion in the summer of 2013. It has the same image on the front as this copy but also states that it includes a digital copy for iPad and iPhone. Well....

The original video is exactly the same on both the 2003 and 2012 releases and appears to be a transfer from the original VHS release. This quality was fine for back in the VHS day, but just doesn't cut it at all today. Full frame VHS quality on a 2012 rlease. Ugh. Looked awful on my HD TV and on my desktop computer.

Also the ""digital"" version is cut down by about a factor of 4 and the iPhone digital version is a postage stamp.

Disappointed. Definitely would not have bought this in 2013 if I could have previewed it first.",1379376000,,868,4.248484848484848
