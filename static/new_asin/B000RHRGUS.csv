8200814,4,B000RHRGUS,"Definition is a good, solid no thrills workout that reshapes your body in wonderful ways. Joyce has great form, and is an inspirational workout partner.  Joyce is a bit of a character, but I love seeing an older woman being buff and strong.

The equipment needed for this DVD is three sets of dumbbells, a bench and a mat.  (I don't have a bench, but was able to use a stability ball or a mat for all the bench work.)  This workout is meant to be done in a two or three day split.  You can do upper body one day, middle the next and lower body on the third, or do upper on one day and middle and lower the next.  The exercises are paired by muscle group, and you do each pair in a pyramid of five sets: 12 reps of the lowest weight; 10 reps of the middle weight; 8 reps of the heaviest weight; 10 reps of the middle weight and a final 12 reps of the lowest.

Joyce has two plans for each workout: the 15 minute ""First Plan"" and the ""Maximum Plan"" which continues an additional 15 minutes.  Since I prefer to do a total body workout every other day, I realized that I can use this DVD to create two 45 minute total body workouts -- one based on the First Plan, and one based on the Maximum Plan.  You can easily select each part of the workout from the DVD menu, skipping only to the parts you want/need.

I only gave this DVD four stars because it is a bit difficult to keep up with Joyce in this one.  She shifts weights and positions very quickly, and I'm always missing reps unless I use the remote to pause Joyce for a few seconds.  In this DVD, Joyce works out alone.  I wish that she had done it with her daughter, Marthe as she did in my favorites of her DVDs:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-Speedy-Non-Stop-Fat-Meltdown-Plus-Stomach-Zapping-Abs/dp/B000R7I3UK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: Speedy Non-Stop Fat Meltdown Plus Stomach Zapping Abs</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-Quick-Quartet-No-Stopping-Quick-Shape-Up-Workout/dp/B002ZXZJKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: Quick Quartet- No Stopping Quick Shape-Up Workout</a>and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Joyce-Vedral-On-The-Ball-Workout/dp/B002AUIFAK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Joyce Vedral: On The Ball Workout</a>.  When Joyce works out with Marthe, she usually pauses for 2 seconds to make sure that Marthe is in sync with her before starting the next set.  This slight pause helps *me* get into position.  Also, Marthe keeps far better count than Joyce does, and it is fun to see the mother and daughter interacting together.

This also shares the weakness that other Joyce Vedral Strength DVDs have: a lack of an adequate warm-up and cool-down, so warm up with some other activity first.  I like jogging or doing a quick 10 minute cardio blast from one of my DVDs.

8200815,5,B000RHRGUS,This DVD covers all the bases for at home exercise/workout. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in working out at home.,1258761600,7,127,4.818181818181818
8200816,4,B000RHRGUS,"If you like Joyce's books, you will like this dvd. It's a no-nonsense pyramid superset workout following the plan in her book, ""Definition"". The video is simply done, but I think that's OK. The workout is hard enough that I don't have time to want to be entertained...I'm too busy building muscle! And isn't that the point?",1247443200,13,323,4.684210526315789
8200817,5,B000RHRGUS,I love the pyramid weight training that Joyce does with this video! She is fast and hopefully with practice I can be as fast as her I've already seen an improvement myself!!,1231027200,9,173,4.4375
