2921389,4,B000UEE6TC,"Let's get down to basics, the movie is never as good as the book, we all know that.  So let's not compare 'The Company' to its over-sized progenitor, a novel, but to history, which it actually is.  These may appear to be characters on your screen, but the majority of them were real people, and the mini-series does a great job of portraying them, and several decades of the Cold War, all within a few hours.  Having just waded through the 1300-odd pages of the Mitrokhin Archive ('The Sword and the Shield', 'The World Was Going Our Way') a meticulous account of the KGB's Cold War activities, it was easy to see the amount of research that went into 'The Company.'  Codenames like 'Sasha' and 'Parcifal' are not just inventions of the novelist Robert Littell, but matters of historical record.  'The Company' brings a solid set of actors to the screen, and all of the details like combat sequences, uniforms, codenames, Hungarian and Russian grammar, are impeccable.  This is a solid piece of film-making, and a good look at history through the narrow lens of the CIA.",1193443200,2,1070,4.695187165775401
2921390,2,B000UEE6TC,"Interesting that this series skips over such titbits as Vietnam, Iran and Guatemala. It is as if the cold war was about Soviet agression and complete good will from American spy actors although they just don't always agree on how to get to their humanitarian goals.

I thought it was particularily funny how Alfred Molina with such smugness tells the Russian spy master off on his ""Stalin loving ***"" and especially his sentence implying that the CIA actually wanted free elections while the KGB was so evil to oppose it. This after the first episode which I was pleasantly surprised with and thought was very well done. Then they have to sour it all in the second episode.

What is most disheartening of it all is that this series is so well done, the actors I think are all doing a good job and although I was very surprised to see Michael Keaton in his role I think he does a fine job. The action is all very well done and I was so surprised with its quality as to rival that of an expensive feature film.

This makes it so disheartening because you can not just count it off to the usual hack jobs who do not plan well, read up and do their jobs well, they just seem to leave out all the really unflattering historical facts while highlighting those that are usually unflattering in the historical light of having been mistakes. It is easy thus to criticise from the standpoint of people making mistakes while not really emphasizing those actions which an agency might make while not perhaps evil in planning from the standpoint of the actors involved but non the less evil in nature.

The CIA and the derivative agencies and groups with all their purposely bewildering names, have never really championed democracy, at least not that democracy which might produce a result unfavourable.

It is telling that this series would produce characters that speak in such a way as to completely disregard the history of the agency when they talk as if they are freeing Cuba from a tyrant but at the same time completely forgetting the fact that the person that was deposed by Castro was a U.S. backed tyrant and also forgetting the stipulations of the original constitution imposed on Cuba after the U.S. ""freed"" Cuba from Spanish rule. The stipulations (Platt Amendent) which resulted in at least 3 subsequent invasions but they were of course seldom called that.

In short I was very disappointed with this series after a very promising start. I have never read the book so I have no idea how faithful this series was to the story. Given my disappointment I can't give this series more than two stars.

Rock on.

2921391,5,B000UEE6TC,"Years ago I gave up the spy novel for the crime novel, so I was hesitant to spend six hours in front of the tube to watch this miniseries.  I was pleasantly suprised.  Addicted, actually!  Hyped for more!  Great acting, photography and directing.  Michael Keaton was AMAZING in his depiction of James Angleton.

2921392,4,B000UEE6TC,"Robert Littell's The Company is a massive novel that follows the history of the CIA from post WWII to the end of the cold war. As long as three books, this novel is rich and full of characterization. So it's obvious that any such book would be hard to bring to the screen, large or small. The TNT TV version, at around 4 1/2 hours, tried hard, but didn't do justice to the book. It sometimes seems like an outline of the book, and so much is left out, that the action moves too quickly, changing locations and characters, making it hard to follow. This is more so in the early part of the series; the last 1/3 focuses on a more limited situation, the attempt to find a CIA mole.

Suffering from overbearing music that is way too loud in the early parts (which makes you wonder why the music was toned down so much in the last third), and characters who are supposed to age about thirty years, but look only a few years older, The Company is, nevertheless, good TV. It will keep your attention, and the intrigue is interesting, but be prepared to give it a chance; it's hard to follow at the beginning. The acting is good, the sets and locations interesting, and the plot - good vs evil - works well, especially since we already know who won the cold war.

But if you like this mini-series, do read the book - it is probably the best spy novel I've ever read, and is so much more interesting than this over-short TV version. No film could do it justice, but I can't help but think that a couple more hours could have saved this from its weaknesses.",1187654400,48,1547,4.276450511945392

2921406,2,B000UEE6TC,"Sorry to rain on the parade of praise here, but this is not a very good production.  It tells well known stories about spies in the Cold War, adding nothing much beyond soap-operish details about who was screwing whom.  Surprisingly, with such a fine cast, the acting is simply, utterly flat, making them into a bunch of stodgy bureaucrats who act along conventional narratives about spies.  There is simply no life to this production.

My recommendation:  if you must, watch it for free on youtube.  You won't want to own it.",1480550400,,526,4.725274725274725

The book is lengthy, violent and explicit and in places hard to read, but is a thought provoking and compelling read about the secret world of ""the Company"".  The translation from book to film was well done, obviously simplified to fit the film genre....also violent and explicit in places, but true to the spirit and intent -- and professionally produced.

You probably won't like it if you enjoy the Mission Impossible or modern James Bond type.  You could go either way if you are the Borne Identity type, but this is much more weighted towards the Tinker, Tailor Soldier Spy kind of spy movie - not really an action flick, more of an intrigue and suspense show.  But if that's your brand of spy movie, why haven't you seen this one yet?

Also, Ebby's roll is much diminished in the movie and Jack's is enhanced. I am sure that was done to showcase Chris O'Donnell. And Torriti is given a much bigger and robust roll throughout the span of the movie than he is in the book. Again, I am sure that was done to showcase the actor who played Torriti.

And that's where the search for moles (and McAuliffe's spy odyssey) begins.  There is more than enough suspense, action, romance, betrayal, and denial to satisfy anyone who enjoys an espionage story that spans several decades.

You wonder why there ever was a cold war if the belligerents on both sides were able to attend the elite schools of the other (Yale), scamper across the Soviet and American zones of Berlin with abandon (clearly marked by pedestrian friendly signs rather than checkpoint guards), and have accents that in most cases were indistinguishable from each other.

2921450,4,B000UEE6TC,"I notice a welcome trend in espionage TV and movies which emphasizes spycraft mechanics and psychological ramifications over explosions, gadgetry and exotic temptresses. In any event while the comparisons here to Perfect Spy, Cambridge Spies and Good Shepherd are perhaps more apropos, my favorite comparison is the recent TV series The Americans (Season 1), which I review elsewhere in these pages.
As for Company, it's quite good and I pretty much agree with the Amazon editorial review. I'll only add that Keaton's twitchy, neurotic performance as the chain smoking, orchid tending, paranoid-in-chief James Angleton is for me the highlight, the best work by him I've seen. BTW was the character Alfred Molina played based on CIA legend William Harvey? Also, was Sasha based on a real person or just a fictional character?
For all the pluses of The Company, I prefer the series The Americans. Maybe it's just that at about twice the length Americans goes into layers of character better. It's also more focused, telling its story in only a few months. The Company is just a little too ambitious, its multiple story lines on a scale of about forty years sometimes resulting in flashback fatigue. Basically Company is an old-fashioned adventure yarn but it nonetheless nicely balances action with leg work and bureaucratic intrigue. Sometimes it ventures perilously close to 007 territory. To wit, the action dominated Part 2 - Bay of Pigs and Hungarian Uprising - is for me the weakest of the series, in part because we've seen this all before, and seen it done better. But overall The Company is a fairly solid production and a worthy contribution to the wilderness-of-mirrors espionage genre. Just short of four stars, but still pretty good.",1408492800,,1744,5.080139372822299
2921451,3,B000UEE6TC,"This isn't a spy movie.  Its a spy soap opera. Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy is far superior.  IF you liked Tinker Tailor, you aren't going to like this. This movie isn't terrible, but it is no way, shape, or form deserving of an IMDB rating of over in the ""8"" range which was the only reason I watched it in the first place.  Lesson noted.  The main attribute of a great spy novel, or movie, that has to be present for it to be truly good is great dialogue.  The dialogue in this movie is downright bad.  Like Soap Opera bad.  The timeline of the movie, although linear, doesn't really flow either.  The main plot of the movie, that there is a mole in MI6, comes straight from Le Carre's novel, Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy. There is no mystery whatsoever.  Any mystery there could have been has no time to develop because of all the unnecessary dramatic scenes and unnecessary characters in them. The scenes with shooting and guns are also unnecessary.  IF you are a spy movie buff, or read Le Carre, this movie isn't for you.  If you are watching this movie with your wife who doesn't like spy movies, there are more painful things you could watch.  Ultimately though, what I have learned is that American directors really have no idea how to make a proper spy film.  Tinker Tailor (the new and the old) are so much better than any American spy movie ever made its beyond belief.  I find it unbelievable Tinker Tailor has a lower rating on IMDB.

2921458,5,B000UEE6TC,"If you're looking for a show about the Central Intelligence Agency with fast car chases, mind-boggling explosions, or hours of scantily-clad women, you are definitely in the wrong place. While some characterize The Company as slow, long, and boring; others like myself can appreciate the patient, methodical, and ambitious nature of this television mini-series.

Unlike other shows and most movies centered on senseless characters shooting big guns in pulse-racing scenarios, this piece carefully engineers and brings to attention the real complexion of espionage and tradecraft throughout history. Chris O'Donnell plays the agency character, Jack McAuliffe, whose growth, maturity, and ultimate leadership throughout the series mirrors his overall career--providing one his best performances I have ever seen. Alfred Molina who represents Jack's mentor and guiding hand, Harvey Torriti, proves he can still command the stage by bringing together the perfect blend of wisdom and humor, a concoction that was amusingly facilitated by his character's unquenchable thirst for liquor. Once donning a multimillionaire's tuxedo by day while being the caped crusader by night, Michael Keaton's riveting portrayal of the CIA's influential James Angleton even made me feel sorry for anyone on his character's short list. Finally, Rory Cochrane's performance of Yevgeny Tsipin brought so much compelling humanity and purpose to the entire series, it brought home the reality that good versus evil, right versus wrong, and black versus white are metaphoric dichotomies that depend on one's perspective.

Although the CIA ultimately wins, this series was more than about us versus them or who is more patriotic than the other--it depicts how small the world really is, how there is more than one right answer for every question, and that in end if one were to achieve an ultimate victory in this seemingly endless battlte, it would undoubtedly be a pyrrhic one. This is definitely a favorite.",1387497600,,1980,5.509868421052632
2921459,4,B000UEE6TC,"The Company is a well-made, entertaining movie about the spy game between the Soviets and the US from 1945 to 1991.  Michael Keaton owns the spotlight with his masterful performance of James Angleton.

The only snag is with the script which in the last episode sketches out a what if James Angleton, with all his fears about a highly placed mole within the CIA and a master plot being orchestrated within the bowel's of the KGB, was correct.  The movie does a fine job on Kim Philby and how his deception may have warped Angleton's mind.  But by the end of the movie the script protrays Angleton as proved right in almost everything.

Real life was, unfortunately, quite different.

David Wise has written, Angleton's ""mole hunt in the CIA destroyed the careers of loyal officers...and paralyzed the agency, bringing to halt its operations against the Soviet Union at a time, during the height of the Cold War, when these operations were the CIA's raison detre.""  An in-house CIA investigation in 1977 reached the same conclusion.

Then there were Angleton's clearly delusional charges: that Averell Harriman and Henry Kissinger were Soviet agents and had betrayed the US; that Angleton was fired because William Colby was a Soviet agent.  Angleton believed the Sino-Soviet split was a ruse to lull the west.  He also went to his grave believing that the reforms Gorbachev enacted were only another act in a grand Soviet deception of a gullable west.

In reality who was the gull?

I have no problem with movies doing major rearranging of history to make it more dramatic but to portray Angleton not only as a hero but as someone who was proved almost always to be right tarnished an otherwise enjoyable movie.",1387065600,4,1710,4.838487972508591

2921461,4,B000UEE6TC,"I'm a big fan of the business of intelligence and the intrigue it provides.  Whether it is applauding, critcal, historical, or fiction or as we have in this case a lil of both of the 2 latter.  This 4hr mini-series is based on a lengthy book, which I have not read and left me in a position I prefer, not knowing the ending.  It mixes historical figures like James Jesus Angleton and fictional characters like Chris O'Donnells main character.  It has a great cast who do there job admirably with a couple of standouts and really no let downs for me.  I found the series enthralling and engrossing as it spans decades as it follows O'Donnels main character Jack and several of his classmates as they make the decision while members of Yale's Skull & Bones(of course) to go to work for the CIA.  Jack begins his career in Germany fighting the KGB and follows his journey through assets, intigue, love, loss, subversion, incitement, intelligence and counter-intelligence.  For something that aired on TNT I didn't expect the quality that this brought to the table but it delivered for me.  As the story moves along the major plot line that develops as we swing through some of the major events, and locations in intelligence beginning in the 60's is the search for the infamous mole(s) or double agent.
The iconic James Jesus Angleton is portrayed by Michael Keaton who, despite his hiatus, is fantastic in this role.  The mannerisms , idiosyncrisies, and paranoia you would expect from the historically obsessed counter-intel chief leap of the screen.  Angleton has historically been portrayed as villan or fall-guy depending on what POV you take. He leaves a legendary footprint but worked closely and was friends with Kim Philby, notorious MI6 agent/KGB mole.  In this movie Angleton is portrayed more evenly and has a major role in the production.  Alfred Molina plays Jack's station chief in Berlin and gives aguably the best performance in the movie, it's a toss-up between him and Keaton frankly.  He's loud, boisterous, and patriotic, with a larger than life personality and brass balls.
The KGB is portrayed mainly by young Rory Cochrane as Evginy and his boss and director of KGB Ulrich Thompsen.  They both also do fabulous jobs portraying the classic enemy of the Company.  If you are into intelligence this will be up your alley, I mean it is pro-CIA but does show the battles behind the scenes that take place that result in policy or risking lives or giant mishaps taking place.",1383004800,3,2490,4.825882352941177

It covers much of the same territory as ""The Good Shepherd"" but of course is thankfully longer.  Despite a weakness in the casting of the main character (played by Chris O'Donnell, who is capable but not compelling, and seems blessed by the ability to withstand aging through the decades) the series completely pulled me into its telling of the major field operations of our intelligence agency throughout its history.  Michael Keaton, as has been noted by others, was superb.  The use of foreign locations was also very well done.

There are not many cinematic or television works to compare this to, but the two British mini-series with Alec Guinness as George Smiley are less broad in scope but even better, IMHO.",1372723200,,840,4.887323943661972
2921466,3,B000UEE6TC,"The entire film falls apart when it gets to Latin America. I have worked in Central America and know the history of Republican presidents beginning with Eisenhower and the Dulles brothers (one Secretary of State and the other the head of the CIA). The Company has nothing to say about the removal of a duly elected president in Iran and the installation of the Shah as leader. Nor does it explain why Iranians hate us because of the misrule of the Shah.
The film gets worse when it covers Central and South America. There is nothing about El Salvador, where the US financed government murdered thousands of Salvadorian peasants and left their bodies on the side of the highway. See Oliver Stone's film Salvador, which gives an accurate view of what happened there (also see the book The Massacre at El Mozote by Mark Danner, which describes the killing of a large number of evangelicals by the US financed army in a remote area of the country. Also see the DVDs Maria's Story and Innocent Voices. Nor does it say anything about Nicaragua, where a corrupt American backed dictator did nothing to remove the debris of a major earthquake in Managua. See the film Under Fire. I was in Nicaragua after the Sandinistas won the war and saw the work they did in building parks and cleaning up Managua. There is no mention in The Company of The Battle of Chile (see Patricio Guzman's 4 DVD documentary of the same name).
Led by Nixon and Kissinger, the Chilean military killed the the duly elected president Salvador Allende by bombing
the National Palace and replaced him by right-wing dictator General Agosto Pinochet. You might remember the constant parades in the capital city Santiago of mothers protesting the murder of their children (known as the disappeared) by the Chilean military) and buried in unmarked graves.
But it gets worse. Right now Mayan Indians living in the state of Chiapas, Mexico, and Guatemala are being murdered by evangelical officials. The US government still treats every country in Central America, the Caribbean and South America as colonies, and backs American companies who oppose duly elected officials.",1371686400,2,2130,4.886740331491713

How did a still-handsome man manage, with no apparent help from makeup, to transform himself into this crabbed, stooped, obsessive and almost repulsive version of James Jesus Angleton, one of the founders of the CIA? It's a performance that should have garnered Keaton countless awards!

And in fact the real person; James Jesus Angleton as brillaintly protrayed by michael keatan did in fact keep a mole from ever being in the C.I.A. as long as he was there.  He was beyond dilligent in this situation and was successful at it too. After he was gone however: Aldrich Ames became a insidious traitor and murderer that wasn't caught until 1994. Making him the agencies worst mole ever. But during Angletons' time noone was able to do it.  The Soviets really got good info from the mid-sixties on from a naval traitor John Walker though.

This series is engaging and doesn't depict any of the spies as monsters or people butchering u.s. citizens like fiends. Many hollywood movies do just that and this one doesn't and is much better done than most spy flicks.

It just occurred to me we have some superheroes here - O'Donnell and Keaton from Batman, and Molina was Doc Ock in Spiderman. Appropriate maybe for a movie based on the CIA's history.

The film follows 3 men recruited into the CIA from college in the 50s through 40 years of the Cold War. The thread that connects them to actual history besides events like the Hungarian uprising and the Bay of Pigs is the ongoing search for a mole within the CIA.

What's enjoyable?

A feeling you get the inside story on how the espionage world works.

A chance to argue about how much of an impact the intelligence organization had on the outcome of the Cold War. The episodes tended to emphasize the CIA's less than stellar moments, but we'll likely not know about its successes in our lifetimes.

An understanding of the sacrifices made to serve in the world of espionage.

Jack is assigned to the Berlin office under Harvey Torriti (Alfred Molina), known as The Sorcerer. Jack falls for the first asset he handles, a ballerina with the code name Rainbow. My favorite line is when the Soviet agent threatens him with the revelation that they've seen the two together at the opera, he responds with ""It was the ballet"" before opening fire. Her cover was blown by a mole and she shoots herself to avoid capture. He is shattered by her death and haunted by wondering if her identity had been given up by The Sorcerer as a ""barium meal"" to flush out a mole. Just as barium is used as an X-ray radiocontrast agent for imaging the human gastrointestinal tract, information is released that a mole, or a double agent, will act on, and if so, then the identity of the mole is revealed. Did The Sorcerer use the ballerina, Rainbow, as a Barium Meal? Jack goes on to other adventures, notably the Hungarian Uprising of 1956 and The Bay of Pigs.

Meanwhile, Yevgeny Tsipin leads an outwardly quiet life as a liquor delivery man, but in actuality, he is passing secrets to the Soviets. He listens to a radio broadcast, and whenever he hears a quote from Alice's Adventures in Wonderland, or Through the Looking-Glass, he knows to pay attention to the winning lottery numbers. He subtracts the lottery numbers from the serial number of a bill, revealing a phone number. Rory Cochrane does a good job as Yevgeny.

The Company covers quite a bit of territory, but there is so much to tell in a history of the CIA. There is almost ""an embarrassment of riches"" -- too much to tell even for a 6 hour + mini-series. Since the decision of what to leave in and what to leave out will almost certainly reveal the biases of the director and the editor, and when you are talking about a controversial subject like the history of the CIA it is impossible not to have biases, I think they have put out a fairly objective, though dramatized, version of the truth. Lefties will think it is too right wing nutty, and conservatives will say it is too leftist. It does question a lot of actions that were taken, but you might also come away with a new respect for the CIA, knowing what they were up against.

Jack, Harvey, Leo, and Yevgeny are all fictional characters, but James Angleton, played very well by Michael Keaton, was a real person, and quite a colorful one. Keaton even had to tone him down a bit, as he was such an unusual and complicated creature. Like the fictional characters from the rowing team Angleton also went to Yale, but instead of rowing he was a poet and, as a Yale undergraduate, editor of the literary magazine Furioso, which published William Carlos Williams, e.e. cummings and Ezra Pound. While at Yale he was trained in The New Criticism and influenced by William Empson, author of 7 Types of Ambiguity. One of his teachers was Norman Holmes Pearson, a founder of American Studies.

During the Second World War Angleton served under Pearson in the counter-intelligence branch (X-2) of the Office of Strategic Services, in London, where he met the famous double agent H.A.R. (""Kim"") Philby. Later, they would work particularly closely in Washington as Kim Philby, being groomed to head MI-6, was also in Washington, and Angleton was the head of Counterintelligence Staff at the CIA. They had regular lunches together until Philby was exposed as a spy for the Soviets.

Michael Keaton puts in a brilliant performance, covering all 7 Types of Ambiguity. As Angleton searches for ""Sasha,"" a second mole described by a Soviet defector, you are never sure if he is paranoid, brilliant, or both. There is a very good scene where he talks to Jack McCauliffe about deception while tending his orchids. Orchids, you see, practice deception in order to get bees to pollinate them. Orchids also require infinite patience to cultivate, something Angleton has in abundance.

""Deception is a state of mind and the mind of the State.""
~ James Jesus Angleton (1917-1987)

As he searched for more moles, he gleaned from the defector that the KGB was not only gathering information from the moles, but also planting false information manipulating the CIA to unwittingly assist the KGB in its objectives.

Angleton extrapolated from this his theory of a ""wilderness of mirrors,"" (a reference to line 65 of T. S. Eliot's poem ""Gerontion""), which proposed that the KGB was capable of manipulating the CIA to believe what it desired, and that the CIA could neither identify nor defend itself from this manipulation.

How should I use them for your closer contact?
These with a thousand small deliberations
Protract the profit of their chilled delirium,
Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled,
With pungent sauces, multiply variety
In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do,
Suspend its operations, will the weevil
Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled
Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear
In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits
Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn,
White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims,
And an old man driven by the Trades
To a sleepy corner.

~ Excerpt from Gerontion, Poems. 1920. by T.S. Eliot (1888-1965)

The 2006 film The Good Shepherd is loosely based on Angleton's life and his role in the formation of the CIA.

The term Angletonian is an adjective used to describe something conspiratorial, overly paranoid, bizarre, eerie or arcane.

2921498,5,B000UEE6TC,"Unless memory fails, I would have to say this is the most entertaining spy film I have ever seen (of the serious and real sort). Take note,... it is of an epic scope. It is long and loaded with details, and could semi-loose you, so pay close attention. If you do, the pay-off is: you'll be deeply drawn in and you won't want it to end. The performances are outstanding, the perspective is balanced, and the filming is gorgeous. The spy ""game"" is understated, yet so entertaining, they really pulled it off. Whatever flaws this film may have aren't even worth mentioning. The best serious fact-based drama I've seen in a while.",1248652800,6,626,4.598214285714286

Congratulations to the movie cast starting with Chris O'Donnell, Alfred Molina and Michael Keaton a remarcable trio !Last but not least congratulations also to the producers.  I stongly recommand this movie.",1244246400,,561,5.233333333333333
2921501,4,B000UEE6TC,"This movie (I know it is ""technically"" a miniseries, but in any case if you're buying it here it will be more like one long movie) can best be described:  on the whole, it's not great -- but the places and aspects of it that are good, are REALLY good.  In fact, the problems I had with certain lines and characters and scenes had nothing to do with quality of acting; the actors were great.  It is the writing that could have been better.  Possibly they just tried to cover way too much material; the bad places I have in mind I would describe as either ""corny"" or ""watered-down""; and some things are flat out misleading (e.g., when The Sorceror has a conversation with a Sicilian crime boss, the boss refers to himself and his people as ""the cosa nostra""... I am pretty sure that no wiseguy would ever admit the existence of the organization, and certainly not at that point in time).

I PROBABLY wouldn't have watched this more than once if it hadn't been for the character of James Angleton, portrayed by Michael Keaton.  To me he is, as it were, the feature presentation.  I would have been happy with a four hour movie completely about him and his character.  He definitely makes the De Niro/Damon adaptation of Angleton (under a different name, in THE GOOD SHEPHERD) look uninteresting.  But this is largely a personal preference of my own for that type of personality and that type of thinker; in spite of his paranoia, I think he was right (see, for instance, the book DECEPTION by Edward Jay Epstein). Keaton's Angleton also expresses several times throughout the film the essence of the real Angleton's own theory of deception and espionage, which in itself is very valuable.

In any case, the movie is worth buying and worth watching at least once.",1241481600,,1759,4.608974358974359

2921508,5,B000UEE6TC,"I have not read the book, so this review is not going to tell you how much better the book is.  Those are not reviews, as I have yet to find a case where the movie is better than the book and do not think that is possible.  What we are going to do is talk about almost five hours of quality entertainment with a story we already know.  This is the popular storybook history of the CIA from the 1950s to the fall of communism in the USSR.  Starting in post-war Berlin, stopping in Budapest, with a side trip to Cuba we follow the CIA through our times.  ""We won, didn't we"" is a fitting critique of America's performance during the Cold War and the ending line of the movie.
This well-mounted production tries to keep the props right for the times.  Older viewers will have fun spotting the small inaccurate items.  There are not enough of them to detract from the story but enough to have some fun.  The locals look good and correct for the era where the action is taking place.  The story line is consistent with what we think happened breaking no new ground and creating no problems.  The acting is excellent.  The script is believable and the actors make the most of it.  Michael Keaton is outstanding as the counter-intelligence boss working to find the agencies mole.  In an understated performance, he is the ultimate detail man, feared and distrusted while fearing and distrusting.  Alfred Molina turns in a very believable performance as a life-long field man with a serious drinking problem.  Here is a careful balance between PTSD and working through the day.
The KGB is not some shadow figure of bad guys lurking outside of our field of vision.  They are portrayed as deeply committed to their country.  Rory Cochrane turns in a great performance as the young man giving his life to the KGB by spying in America.  Chris O'Donnell is his American counterpart giving his life to the CIA by spying wherever he is needed.  This move has an excellent ending showing the price these men paid fighting the cold war.

I also like the small training in Guatemala.  However, most of these events were minimized and seemed choppy.  Alfred Molina is great in all of his scenes, sure of himself and relxed.  I didn't like the way Micheal Keaton subdued his character.  Finally, Chris O'Donnells hairpiece kept distracting me in each of his scenes; in both decades.  Is he really going bald in real life?  That smirk of his was also annoying.  Maybe if he would have grown a real mustache later in the series(not fake), his natural aging would have not been an issue.

I agree with some other customer reviewers that many significant events in the time period covered are omitted or glossed over, esp. the assassination of JFK a year after the Bay of Pigs, but the overall tone and mood of the mini-series is realism. I kept gagging everytime I saw Michael Keaton as Angleton puffing away at his cigarettes. The suspense of detecting the mole, and the twist when the mole's identity is revealed, was well-done. It was hard to believe, however, that Chris O'Donnell as McAuliffe and the English woman he befriended in Hungary could heal so completely and relatively blemish-free after the brutal torture and beating they sustained at the hands of the Hungarian secret police.

Also if you have read the book Mole Hunt by David Wise you will like this movie. And if you haven't read it and have seen this movie check that book out. Alfred Molina is also very good.

2921514,4,B000UEE6TC,"Sometimes it's all about the competition.  If you have read The Company, you probably agree that it is a wonderful book.  To say that a book that is almost 900 pages long ends too soon is saying a lot.  But there is a lot good to say about The Company.  And a lot in the 900 page book that is not going to make it to the screen in four and a half hours of run time.

So, if you compare the mini-series to the book, this probably gets three stars, notably for a few key changes to the plot, several omissions due to run time limits, and the problem of portraying characters who age by 40 years visually. (Yes, the music is annoying in the first episode, but it isn't that bad.)

However, if you compare to most other mini-series, this is close to five stars.  After all, it starts off with a tremendous plot line and story.  It does a great job of shooting realistically in foreign locales (Berlin and Budapest are done really well).  And Molina and Keaton do a superb job with their characters.  Keaton in particular goes to a whole new level in his portrayal of James Jesus Angelton, the real-life head of counter-intelligence in the CIA.  The performances of these two actors alone make this DVD worth watching.

Sadly, Chris O'Donnell playing the main character is not up to what his two peers deliver.  He just a great job as the 'Hail, fellow, well met!' Yalie, but just does not seem to ever grow or learn as he gets older.  Having watched first hand the US betray their promises to the Hungarian freedom fighters in their 1956 revolt, he seems utterly surprised (first hand again) 5 years later that the US leadership does it again to the Cuban rebels on the Bay of Pigs.  Some of this is the fault of the script writer, who otherwise has done a good job, but some of it is O'Donnell himself.  I completely forgot that Keaton once played Batman in a movie.  I was reminded often that O'Donnell played Robin.  Keaton's growth as an actor over almost 30 years is remarkable.  O'Donnell has stuck to what he does.  Nothing wrong with that, but it means he is miscast.

But, if you like mini-series, or want to learn about the CIA and can't face up to 900 pages, The Company is recommended strongly.  And if you really like the book and would like to see it visualized for you, it is a real treat.",1200873600,18,2300,4.349765258215962
2921515,5,B000UEE6TC,"I saw this movie, not knowing what to expect, but i must say, it was one of the most beautiful films on history, strategy, counter-intelligence, romance, and action i have ever seen.  This is essentially 3 movies (each full feature length) that takes you through three critical decades within the CIA/KGB struggles during the cold war.

It follows the lives of three friends from Yale, and how the whole cold war sets a context for the arc of thier career, love, courage, and death.

I haven't seen Keaton since Batman, and Molina since Spiderman2, but i think these two actors turn out a performance of a lifetime in this film.

The three films provide enough length to really achieve a sense of intamacy with the characters, and the ending is superb.  After watching this masterpiece, I felt as though i had just finished reading a truly great novel.

2921518,3,B000UEE6TC,"First of all, I actually enjoyed this mini-series, which, as has been noted, is elegantly produced and, on the whole, well acted. The costumes and settings are also excellent and evocative of the period. Michael Keaton is especially good in the role of chain-smoking James J. Angleton. And Tom Hollander, who seems to be making a career playing various Cambridge spies (He still has to play Maclean, Cairncross, and Blunt [which will require a real suspension of disbelief].), is brilliant (as usual) in the role of Philby (whom the writers have coyly called by one of his middle names, Adrian, so that viewers who may be only vaguely familiar with the early history of CIA will not guess he is Kim, the British Soviet Mole). Hollander plays the spy with understated charm, and his suggestion of Philby's stammer never slips into parody.

Good points being acknowledged, I now come to various aspects that have been already stated in other reviews: the overproduced music (which sometimes drowns out crucial dialogue); the handsome but rather wooden hero, who ages twenty years only in the steel color of his hair; and the confusing flashbacks, which cloud the narrative. As one who is fairly familiar with the historical background, I was also annoyed by details, which I admit are picky: if the heroes graduated in the Yale class of 1954 (as has been indicated), Philby, along with Burgess, had vacated Washington in 1951; by 1954, Burgess was in Moscow and Philby was being interrogated in London, cleared, and rehired by SIS and sent to Beirut under cover as a foreign correspondant, so there is no way that the young Yalies would have been in on the Philby debacle (One of them is depicted as delivering whisky and other goodies to him in Washington.). I think I prefer the ""Good Shepherd's"" solution of giving real people false names [We still knew that Matt Damon was Angleton!]. Then, none of these plot points would make the slightest bit of difference.

Again, I enjoyed the mini-series, which, under the aegis of Ridley Scott, sticks to standards that are much higher than the usual U.S. television fare. I did not think the series was as bad as some reviewers have judged it, but then, I think it could have been far better with a little more planning and a lot more editing.",1195862400,12,2287,4.802030456852792
2921519,2,B000UEE6TC,"Where does one start with this well produced, highly-budgeted and deeply flawed mess? Perhaps summing it up as ""The Cold War Thorn Birds"" is a start. Ostensibly a ""history"" of the CIA (based upon a novel which I haven't read), featuring realistic locations and well-presented period touches, it ultimately failed for me by adding cringe-inducing ""epic"" miniseries flourishes while presenting a tangled and likely unknowable truth in a nicely-wrapped package.

Though it's easy to focus on the fact that the dramatic impact of this series is carried on the very pretty, but ultimately slight, shoulders of Chris O'Donnell, who handles every scene like a square-jawed action hero, the biggest disappointment is the overwrought script. Beautiful ballerina spies! Gorgeous blonde resistance fighters with heart breaking secrets! Handsome, sensitive dissident poets! All uttering romanticized lines as the music swells... and swells... and swells. True, O'Donnell tries with gusto to deliver lines like ""I can't live without you!"", surviving brutal beatings with a blood-choked ""My Rank? My rank is GO TO HELL"", yet there's not a moment where he's anything more than a cartoon. Even the usually-great Alfred Molina is allowed scene-chewing moments that bring Jon Lovitz' ""acting!!!"" schtick to mind - not a good thing.

The good? Well, it's great to see Michael Keaton again (remember when he was a Tom Hanks level player?) Production value is amazing here; they spent a lot on this series, and every dollar seems to have made it to the screen (though the soviet spy's CGI-rendered Brooklyn storefront constantly looked like ""Lord of the Rings"" meets ""Grease"").

But the bad? Oh, the bad is BAD! When a (gorgeous) Hungarian freedom fighter is reunited with her long-lost daughter in an Austrian refugee camp (yes, that was the setup), it was just plain insulting. Do we need one of the most bitter (and forgotten) moments of 20th century history to be nicely gift wrapped by square-jawed Jack leading a little girl to her torture-surviving mother? Pause a moment, friends, and think about what the inclusion of that scene says about our media producers' feelings for you, the American consumer, and how you want your ""history"" presented. Yes, I know there's a huge market for romance novels in the U.S., but why not just get Fabio to play a C.I.A. operative... in a poet shirt?

Essentially, O'Donnell is a cold-war era Forrest Gump, managing to find himself up to his neck in every historical turning point. His Company compadres grit their teeth as he's abandoned and endangered, the blame all going to those ""politicians""; the C.I.A. in this case being true-believers, tripped up by the cowardly white house. (Yet wasn't it the C.I.A. that ended Democracy in Iran and installed the Shah, summed up by the now-famous memo stating ""this is how you overthrow a country""?)

And while the first two episodes (all I managed) show a willingness to explore America's cowardly and two-faced attitude towards Soviet-bloc resistance - supporting and training dissidents, urging them to revolt, and then disappearing when the bullets hit the fan (something that resonates to this day - Iraqi Kurds, anyone?) it misses entirely the great American failing of the cold war: For all the evidence that capitalism-based, Jeffersonian democracy was what the average human being desired, for all our faith in our system, we allowed ourselves to support so many tyrants, finance so much misery, and allow so much bloodshed. When it came down to it, the cold war shows we had very little faith in democracy, and as once again we toss out some of the deepest foundations of that democracy, with torture, the shredding of our rights, and our belief that only non-ethnic Americans deserve the rights we are supposedly fighting for worldwide, a series like ""The Company"" should feel a lot more true and vital than this attempt comes close to.",1195430400,10,3914,5.09984399375975
2921520,5,B000UEE6TC,"This movie is outstanding.  The cast, the locations, direction, and story line come together and produce magic.  Not too much action rather like ""The Spy Who Came in From the Cold"".  A thinking man's spy movie.  Let's face facts, most movies now are all computer generated massive special effects with little or no substance.  Some people will not like this movie because it makes you think.  I for one, have not given up this process and enjoy movies that encourage one to take a hard look at ourselves.",1194912000,3,504,4.670454545454546
2921521,4,B000UEE6TC,"Keaton and Molina did brilliantly here, as did Rory Cochrane and the fellow who played the KGB general.  But O'Donnell was simply not believable as Jack McAuliffe.  As a 50-year old, he looked and talked like a 20-something with prematurely gray hair.  It reminded me of Kevin Costner in Robin Hood.  Why they cast a guy who couldn't pull off an English accent still eludes me to this day.  But aside from the credibility factor in the character of Jack McAuliffe, the rest of the film (and make no mistake - this was a film - it was simply made for the small screen instead of the big screen) was highly enjoyable.

If I could sum up the film in one word, it would be ""betrayal.""  Betrayal of people against their countries.  Betrayal of people against one another.  Betrayal of governments to support the people who were serving them.  And betrayal of the United States to follow through and do the right thing when principle should have trumped political expediency.

The production quality in this 3-part miniseries (6 hrs total) was outstanding.  Frankly, this was a story that probably could not have been told in a usual 120 minute movie anyway, so I think when you look at the tradeoff between telling the story over the course of 6 hours on a small screen versus trying to tell it in 2 hrs on a large screen -- the producers chose exactly the right approach.

I see that some others have criticized this for not dealing with Vietnam, Guatemala, and other obviously important facets of the cold war.  But, honestly - unless you turned this into an entire season of 1- or 2-hour episodes that ran into 16 hours or more, how in the world are you going to do anything other than a drive-by?  Answer: you aren't.  Again, I think the producers struck the right balance here.

Part one covers the period immediately following WWII.  Part two deals with the Hungarian Revolution.  And Part 3 takes us from the Bay of Pigs to the eventual dissolving of the USSR after a plan to destabilize Wall St. fails miserably and the grand experiment with communism runs out of gas.  The series closes with Yeltsin succeeding Gorbachev and our lead character, Jack McAuliffe, expressing the obligatory questions about whether he'd devoted his career to simply one side of a chess game, or a side that was inherently right.

I enjoyed it, and I recommend it.  But in the end, it succeeds in spite of Mr. O'Donnell, not because of him.  I like Chris O'Donnell well enough - he was simply miscast here and ultimately couldn't fill the shoes that the role required.  Russell Crowe would have been a much better choice, but perhaps made-for-TV is beneath him at this point in his career.  In all, the casting was superb, with the notable exception of O'Donnell.",1194048000,4,2745,4.633540372670807
2921522,5,B000UEE6TC,"This is a shockingly good miniseries which faithfully reproduces the story from the Robert Littel novel of the same name upon which it is based.  This is a historical drama about idealism, struggle, cynicism, and betrayal.  It covers the CIA from the time of its inception through the demise of the Soviet Union through the eyes of Jack McAuliffe (Chris O'Donnell), Leo Kritzky (Allesandro Nivola) and Harvey Torriti a/k/a ""the Sorcerer"" (Alfred Molina).  Michael Keaton superbly plays the role of real life former CIA Chief of Counterintelligence James Jesus Angleton.  Overall the acting in this saga is excellent; I was particularly impressed by Keaton, Molina, and O'Donnell, each of whom turns in a superb performance.  Keaton, in particular, absolutely nails the role of ""mother"" (Angleton).

The miniseries tells a compelling story of the CIA's struggle against the KGB against the backdrop of the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the Bay of Pigs incident, and the attempts of each agency to penetrate the other with double agents.  McAuliffe (O'Donnell) and The Sorcerer (Molina) are top field agents, who work with CIA allies in Berlin, Hungary, and Cuba.  McAuliffe suffers firsthand when the CIA is both betrayed from within by Soviet double agents, and the betrayer of its allies when promises of direct American aid to those seeking to overthrow Soviet dictatorships prove empty.  As was indeed the case in real life, James Jesus Angleton (Keaton) whose best friend was unveiled as top Soviet double agent Kim Philby, is obsessed with the knowledge that there is a Soviet ""mole"" within the CIA who repeatedly undermines its operations.  (Indeed there was.)  This sweeping saga portrays the CIA as an idealistic but far from masterful intelligence agency engaged in a tough fight against the Soviet KGB.  The KGB, while competent, has its own issues and its effectiveness is blinded by seeing the world through its own doomed ideology.

This is a gripping story that will absorb many viewers.  I found the music to be wistful, and compelling, and it added to the mood of the story.  This miniseries avoids the defect of this genre in that it is not overlong, and indeed it left me wishing for more.

No matter where one falls on the political spectrum, this is a worthwhile and very engaging miniseries.  The DVD is crisp and benefits from the wide format.  Overall this is a terrific value.",1193529600,2,2395,5.020253164556962

8213066,5,B000UEE6TC,I watch this movie every two years...I just did and I like it very much. This is more than just a movie. The characters are studies of real people and real CIA employees...they have studied their real jobs and their real backgrounds and habits and put all that in this production. It is very believable. There is real history and historical events depicted in this movie....It is not all just fiction thought up by a writer. For many years it was known that the CIA recruited as many Yale graduates as they could and that eventually they were promoted to responsible positions over all others. All the stuff about the British Philby was true and he was a Mole for Russia who was eventually found out after doing much damage. I suspect that fewer and fewer Americans know much about this....and socialism/communism support seems to continue to grow in our country. Michael Keaton did a great job playing Angleton who is a legend in the CIA.,1518220800,,939,4.662650602409639

8213071,5,B000UEE6TC,"A connoisseur of all things CIA, secret service, spies, I found this series, and I was so excited. If you are or if you are not a fan of the CIA, give this a look, it gives a pretty accurate portrayal of the early days with Russia and the KGB. We have had some pretty spectacular wins, misses and losses, and this three part series sums it up very well.

We meet Yale graduates Jack McAuliffe, played by Chris O'Donnell, Leo Kritzky, played by Alessandro Nivola, and Yevgeny Tsipin, played by Rory Cochrane. Their graduation is upon them and two of them tare recruited by the CIA.  Yevgeny who is from Russia sides with the KGB. In the first episode, we see how the CIA really functions. There is a Soviet mole within the agency. Jack's mentor Harvey ""The Sorcerer"" Torriti, played wonderfully by Alfred Molina who is as keen as they come. Jack is working in Berlin, where a source is giving him secrets from the KGB.  The CIA counter-intelligence expert James Jesus Angleton, played by Michael Keaton realizes that the mole in question is one of his old pals.

In episode 2 we see the results of the Hungarian revolution, and the Cuba Missle fiasco. We see the brutality of both sides, KGB and CIA. In the third episode another Moore is found within the agency, and this is someone that shocks the entire group. Angelton, whose constant smoking is such an annoyance, spends years tracking this more down.

Such a well acted series, and ond that brings the issues of Russia vs the USA to the fore. And it gives more meaning to the issues we have today.
