To make matters worse the camera keeps zooming in and out and fading from one angle to another so you can't follow every move his hands are making. I also found some of the tab hard to follow. It does not seem to match what Roy is playing very well.
I'm an intermediate player. I learned quite a bit from watching Roy's' hands but not enough to play an entire song, just some cool cord moves and licks here and there. Also not all the songs on the video are included in the tab book. That seems slack to me. I did enjoy hearing Roy play, sing and tell stories.",1247616000,4,709,4.107913669064748
8298278,5,B001EIK7UU,"I already have several of Roy Bookbinder's videos. In this video (in the studio, no audience) he tells the stories behind some of his better known perfmance works and gives demonstrations of several of the songs. As always, his humor and excellent guitar skills carry the program. The DVD also has the tabulature files for several of the songs included.",1233100800,,353,4.9
