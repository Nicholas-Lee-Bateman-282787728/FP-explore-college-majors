7856544,5,6303937632,"Coming Out Under Fire offers a mesmerizing expose of the lives of gay and lesbian service members during World War II. In a time where the story of one's military acceptance, rejection, or discharge status followed them either like a golden ticket or scarlet letter, these servicemembers displayed an amazing amount of courage, dignity, and self-reliance. While these are the stories of those who survived their experiences, we can be sure that many more unfortunately disappeared in shame and seclusion. Any LGBT veteran or their family will benefit from this history. Anyone who wishes to exactly how LGBT servicemembers have been treated by the very country they served should definitely see this documentary.",1365724800,,712,5.3097345132743365
7856545,3,6303937632,A glimpse of group male physical examinations during earlier war time periods.  Most gay guys would be pleased to see what was going on in those days and how embarassing it was!,1344556800,,177,4.53125
7856546,5,6303937632,"This documentary consists of interviews with gay and lesbian ex-soldiers in our Armed Forces, and how their sexual preferences had to be hidden to avoid being dishonorably discharged from the services. These soldiers enlisted to do what they could to help their country, which needed them. Yet their superiors and some of their comrades would easily expose them if they were found out, and would have them expelled. What a waste of expertise and experience! This way of thinking is unjust, and belongs in the same category that said black people were inferior to white people. It's downright stupid!
This film is a wake-up call for the military to open it's recruitment to all people so that it can operate at top efficiency for the protection of our country.",1271894400,3,759,4.891472868217054
7856547,4,6303937632,"The highlight is touching interviews with World War II veterans, four gay and one lesbian, and the persecution they suffered. Unfortunately, the film remains simplistic, tracing the source of the world war military's policy, subsequent McCarthyite persecutions, and current 'no kiss and tell' policy to the medicalization of homosexuality. The filmakers failed to connect the military's policy to American gender relations during the same period.",1025481600,3,446,5.876923076923077
7856548,5,6303937632,"Director Arthur Dong is perhaps best known for his documentary Licensed To Kill, in which he probed the minds of people who murder others for being gay. Though Coming Out Under Fire at least has flashes of humor, it is equally upsetting in the dark secrets that it reveals. Dong shows not only the long tradition of gays in America's military but also their tradition of serving with distinction before meeting with betrayal.",1004400000,8,425,4.835616438356165
