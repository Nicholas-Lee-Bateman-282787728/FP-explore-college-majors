7948194,3,B00005O5BF,"This cool heist flick from the folks at City Heat Productions (the best Direct-to-Video company ever) is chic, action-packed, and highly entertaining. The plot has been seen many times before. A retired jewel theif decides to go on one more big score in order to get his brother out of trouble. The acting could use a little polishing, save for Peter Weller and Bryan Brown, but the rest of the movie is very well-done and nicely polished to create an almost Tarentino-like feel to the whole thing. Sure it's nothing compared to Resevoir Dogs or The Usual Suspects, but it is a very fun flick with twists and turns up till the very end. I enjoyed watching this fun, but ultimitely forgettable flick. Just don't expect any extras on the DVD.",1043280000,6,740,4.656488549618321
