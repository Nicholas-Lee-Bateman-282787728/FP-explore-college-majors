2231538,5,B0007QJ1U2,This guy is fresh and picks on everyone!!!! Great if you want to laugh until your sides hurt.  Not for thoes that are easily offended and Not for children (has some bad language.),1123804800,16,179,4.424242424242424
2231539,5,B0007QJ1U2,"The brand of stand-up Carlos Mencia uses is rather abrasive, but keep in mind that everyone and everything is subject to a hard reality thump in his common sense world view.  If you can't take the obvious from Carlos, you're simply offended.  Such black and white humor is (refreshingly) harsh; nevertheless, you'll thank Carlos for ripping out your funny bone and breaking in half while talking smack about ""stupid"" people.",1123718400,11,424,5.042857142857143
2231540,5,B0007QJ1U2,"Carlos Mencia often speaks about things that I've thought in the back of my mind but didn't dare to say aloud. I first heard him once morning on my way to my college classes on the local alternative station as he was appearing at one of our comedy clubs. I was totally drawn in to his routine and the similarity between his viewpoints and mine. Carlos is very ""liberal"" minded and criticizes close-minded people. He makes fun of all races, religions, etc- but not in a hurtful way. He doesn't treat one race different from another and encourages people to be open minded and understanding of other people and thus isn't racist as some of his critics claim. He criticizes the way America is being divided based upon people's gender, race, etc and encourages people to relate to other groups.

Examples of his routine are: ""Carlos, why are u messing with my people? Because Ackmed, it's your turn! [...] Let me explain it to you: America is a giant game of tag- somebody is always it. On September 10th, it was [blacks and Hispanics] and then on September 11th when they showed the pictures of the hijackers, Carlos and Tyrone went `Tag, You're it!'""  And...  ""I have little compassion for people in trailer parks who live in tornado ally and refuse to move after getting hit repeatedly by tornadoes. How hard is it for them to relocate?  Their house has wheels.""",1122768000,11,1361,4.634854771784233
2231541,5,B0007QJ1U2,one of the funniest stand-up comics I have seen was laughing so hard missed half the jokes... have watched it several times and still laughed hard,1122595200,10,146,4.653846153846154
2231542,4,B0007QJ1U2,"This is the first Carlos Mencia I've heard and I'm hooked.  Yes, there's a lot of cussing and yes, there are a lot of racist remarks. Carlos doesn't pick on any one group, he picks on everyone equally, and therein lies the secret.  In our Politically Correct world, it's refreshing to hear someone say what most of us are afraid to say.  I wouldn't play this for my Mom, or for Kids, but for my friends, I definately recommend this one.",1122595200,12,436,4.3580246913580245
2231543,1,B0007QJ1U2,this guy is not at all funny....he uses material other comedians use and tries to package it as something new...,1122163200,4,112,4.65
2231544,1,B0007QJ1U2,"I checked it out to see what he was all about and this was not funny...I'd forgive a lot in the name of comedy but his material is a dime a dozen racist jokes, usually at the expense of the poor and working class and Mexican.

I'm sure some people would like it because it validates what they think about these people but as I am all three so I thought it was repugnant.

In this current political climate this is totally P.C.

All my friends think he is a sell-out to our people.

Watch at your own self-revealing peril.",1122163200,6,521,4.18
2231545,2,B0007QJ1U2,"It is very true that this material is absolutely hilarious and that Carlos is doing his best to comically bust the PC culture that has paralyzed us. But this is the same DVD as ""Live 2003"" with a 'Day in the Life of Carlos' tacked on. If you own the later, save your money for a TRULY new DVD or to buy tickets to a Carlos Mencia show. It will be better spent.",1120521600,6,360,3.9452054794520546
2231546,5,B0007QJ1U2,"I had never heard of Carlos Mencia before, but he is one of the best American comedians going in today's comedy scene.  I laughed so hard I couldn't believe it.  I'm 55 and this young guy just has some great material.  I've even purchased his CD version of the DVD.  I've defintely got my monies worth.  I never get tired of his ""stuff"".

DEFINATELY ADULT MATERIAL, HOWEVER!",1109462400,29,374,4.507462686567164

2231548,5,B0007QJ1U2,My family has a military fund raising each year and comedy videos are always on the list because war is extremely depressing and we do our part to put a smile on our soldiers faces. I received an email from the soldiers in Afghanistan saying they could not laugh enough. This was a great video and I have to say thank you for having it at a really good price.,1293753600,,359,4.142857142857143
2231549,5,B0007QJ1U2,"Have all Carlos's videos, watched his Mind of Mencia shows and saw him in person at the Soaring Eagle Casino in Mt Pleasant, Michigan.  He used to make me a bit uncomfortable because I hate prejudice but I realize now that Carlos is a comedian and he's saying those things with one objective, nothing else ... to make us all laugh! And he does that very well!!  I love it when Carlos makes himself laugh ... he gets the cutest face!!",1265587200,,433,4.333333333333333
2231550,5,B0007QJ1U2,I don't generally watch a comedy more than once...This is Carlos Mencia at his best. I have watched this 4 times over last several months. Definitely worth buying!,1247529600,,163,4.857142857142857
2231551,5,B0007QJ1U2,"Who needs that Richard Pryor clown? He wasn't funny. Carlos Mencia is the real deal, bro! He can make me laugh for days. That Pryor guy was boring and overrated.",1226361600,,161,4.4
2231552,1,B0007QJ1U2,"I have never liked Carlos mencia, hes arrogant, racist, and a liar. Hes Honduran and German, and tries to pass himself off as mexican so he can sell more. All his jokes are about race, he literally has nothing else, Oh he also makes fun of fat people, He repeats himself  to take up time and hes a joke theif. He steals from unknown comics that cant defend themselves and he gets away with it. Joe Rogan is a great person for going after him and trying to bring him down. If you want to listen to good comics, listen to Daniel Tosh, Greg Giraldo, or Nick Dipaolo, not this hack",1212883200,4,577,4.198198198198198
2231553,5,B0007QJ1U2,"Firtly, let me say that I have watched the show on DVD previously and thought it was excellent. Carlos Mencia's ""no hold barred"" approach to stand up and everyday observations make him one of the most entertaining stand up comedians today. Nothing is off limits, the clue is in the title NOT FOR THE EASILY OFFENDED! And I like this no nonsense ""tell it like it is"" material. While other comedians are more careful about there material, for fear of offending anybody, Mencia literally doesn't care if anybody gets offended - he tells it like it is and this is what I love about him.

I ordered 3 of these dvds, one for me and 2 for friends who asked me to also order them a copy each. Unfortuantely NONE of the 3 dvds worked, even although we all have multi region dvd players and ntsc compatable tvs. When you play the dvd, we just got a black screen. No picture. No sound. Just a black screen after the original FBI warning. This was very frustrating, as I've ordered so many region 1 dvds in the past without any problems. I will be returning the DVDs shortly and I do expect a full refund. Maybe it was just a batch of them which don't play properly and I would be very interested to hear if any other buyers have had this playback problem with their DVDs?",1210118400,,1260,4.338983050847458
2231554,5,B0007QJ1U2,"It's Carlos Mencia, what else can you say?  It's hilarious, and even moreso since it's uncencored.  Worth the money!",1206489600,,116,5.052631578947368
2231555,5,B0007QJ1U2,"One can not overlook the rumors of plagarism, and I don't know too much about that except that jokes are circulated frequently.  Since this is my first look at the comic, I can only focus on the act.  Although the show had very funny moments, he is not my favorite, but the audience was having a great time.  The connection was here!

Offensive? Yes, but one can still laugh heartily at Mencia's show.  It is about his presence, the pace, delivery, and content of material.  He provides nonstop material with no let-ups; his audience finds him riotious; he commands the stage, and, he pleases his audience with his extremely physical body and facial movements.

He admits offense and gives respect to the retarded (those born that way).  Mencia's favorite offense is to the stupid people in the world, and it is those he refers to as retarded.

The humor is offensive, but not enough to make one cringe and the language is constant F word with various Mexican unfavorable words.

Mencia has said his observation is with his frustration with humanity. He covers school, attention deficit, immigrants, race, etc.  The accents are done well, convincingly.  On this DVD, you will also find Mencia's radio promos and behind the scenes.

If you enjoy this humor and can get past the language, you will be delighted to hear see and hear the rants of Mencia.  ....Rizzo",1190246400,3,1361,4.760683760683761
2231556,5,B0007QJ1U2,Best comedian out there. This is also his best DVD in my opinion. I recommend you try all of his DVD's,1189987200,,102,3.9047619047619047
2231557,5,B0007QJ1U2,"If you're not soft-skinned and can laugh at yourself and others, Carlos Mencia is one of the funniest (and truthful) comics out there. I rate him & his material better than Dave Chapelle. You're in for a good laugh.",1173312000,2,215,4.538461538461538
2231558,5,B0007QJ1U2,"My daughter turned me on to Carlos!  It was so funny because she kept saying, ""Now Mom, his language is really bad...and he picks on EVERYONE!"" She wasn't kidding, his language is bad...and he DOES pick on everyone, but in the same breath, you will pee your pants from laughing so hard!!!  He totally lays everything out there on the line, makes you think, and makes you laugh!  I went on-line the very next day and bought this CD (the one we watched) and bought No Strings Attached too!  You won't be sorry with this one! I got a good deal buying this on Amazon, but would have paid more if I had to!",1169424000,5,601,4.245614035087719
2231559,5,B0007QJ1U2,"it's not funny that Mencia's humor is so funny because the topics are descriptions of how the great melting pot still isn't all tht great. The language is for adults, not kids.",1168560000,2,176,4.53125
2231560,5,B0007QJ1U2,this video was so funny from start to finish.  I saw him at a comedy club in 9/06 and the video was almost as good as seeing him in person.  He is the funniest person to watch in person or on video.,1168300800,3,198,3.6904761904761907
2231561,5,B0007QJ1U2,"The DVD title tells it like it is, and so does Carlos.  Nobody and no subject is off limits; if lack of common sense is displayed, Carlos is there to point it out quite bluntly.

But I guess the dork who posted the ""user image"" of the broken DVD is one of those easily offended.  I can't figure out if that is a tantrum or he's just not capable of taking care of a disc.  Either way I'm thinking, ""dee-dee-dee"".

Anyway, if you're tired of the stupidity that seems to be running rampant with the human race these days, listen to Carlos.  He may not be able to fix things, but he'll sure have you laughing about them!",1168128000,4,616,4.177966101694915

2231563,5,B0007QJ1U2,Carlos Mencia is about the funniest man on the plantet. He says it like it is. I haven't enjoyed comedy as much  since the Blue Collar Comedy DVD's. I love this guy.,1163203200,,165,4.15625
2231564,5,B0007QJ1U2,Wow what a laugh we had watching the dvd.  Anyways I recived my dvd in like with in a week insted of when they said its going to be like 2+ weeks. Thanks,1156550400,,153,3.6363636363636362

2231566,5,B0007QJ1U2,this was an awesome stand-up comedy.  I would HIHGLY recommend this all people.  Definitely not for the close minded right wing society.  Brutally realistic comedy.  He is the combination of Eddie Murphy raw and of Richard Pryor at his best.,1154044800,3,241,4.95
2231567,5,B0007QJ1U2,it was so funny. its nice to see someone who's not afraid to say what's on their mind....hilariously funny,1153785600,4,106,4.631578947368421
2231568,4,B0007QJ1U2,It is FUNNY... VERY Funny!!!!! its just too bad he has to be so vulgar... beyond the very often F Bombs he drops..... he is a very funny man!,1151971200,,141,3.896551724137931
2231569,5,B0007QJ1U2,"The title sums it up.....it's not for the easily offended.  But, it's funny!  No one is left out...he talks about everyone on an equal basis and he says what most of us only think about.  If you like his tv show - The Mind of Mencia, you'll love this too!",1151798400,2,255,4.06
2231570,4,B0007QJ1U2,"I have to admit that at first I did not know what to expect from this comedian, but as it turns out it was a very pleasant surprise!

Carlos Mencia does a good job of providing satire in regards to the various aspects of American society ranging from Michael Jackson, the accident involving the tigers in Las Vegas and ADD, to the racial/ethnic make-up of the USA and events following 9/11.  In regards to all these topics, there is a lot of truth in what Carlos Mencia says.

In a nutshell, though not a masterpiece, like Eddie Murphy's Delirious and Raw, it will still provide for an evening's entertainment, though you might want to stop short of buying it.",1151107200,,660,4.529411764705882
2231571,5,B0007QJ1U2,"Alot of people are saying ""don't watch this if you are to conservative"". Come on, don't watch it if you are to liberal!!!!!  The guy tells it like it is!!",1150070400,11,154,4.133333333333334
2231572,5,B0007QJ1U2,"Carlos is probably the most witty Latino comic to come on the scene in quite some time. He is not afraid to tell it like it is and is always brutally honest. His use of language is definately not for the faint at heart. I enjoy the fact that he can poke fun about anyone and everyone. To be able to cut jokes about your own race as well as everyone else is such a great thing. As he says at the start of the show, ""You'll probably like most of the jokes you hear, but there will be that one joke where everyone else is laughing and you are like F**k You!"" Priceless. Not to mention he's right. He's not afraid to make jokes about ""taboo"" issues, and for that, Carlos I salute you!

Should appeal to fans of Richard Pryor / George Carlin / Dennis Leary etc.",1149292800,4,756,4.073825503355705
2231573,5,B0007QJ1U2,"I'm glad that a comic has come out of the closet and still managed to find commercial success.  As a gay man who is hoping for some sort of showbiz career in the future, it is inspiring to see an openly homosexual comic like Carlos Mencia doing the daring performances he does.  I was hoping for more hot man-on-man action on this uncensored DVD, but alas, one can not have it all.  But in any case, it is hilarious and you should buy it, if not for the great comedy than to support equal opportunity for gays in comedy.",1149292800,,520,4.232323232323233

2231577,2,B0007QJ1U2,"I'm not saying this as a Chappelle fanboy, or for any reason unrelated to the fact Carlos is not funny. Mencia is a guy who prefers congratulating himself over how edgy and offensive he is, while proving joke after joke that he's PC as one can get. If Carlos wants to shock me, he should try telling a funny joke. I'd be in a perpetual state of awe.
Edit: By the way, the reviewer above me is an advertiser. ""Equal opportunity offender"" was a phrase coined by Comedy Central. Nice try though.",1144627200,8,492,4.358695652173913

2231580,4,B0007QJ1U2,"Carlos Mencia's ""Not for the Easily offended,"" is probably one of the funniest stand up's I have ever seen.  He brings up some issues that cause alot of conflict in today's society.  Some of his points are very true. Overall you will be entertained and you will laugh.  Expect to see alittle too much of the retarded kid act though, which I found was his only drawback.",1138406400,3,369,4.477611940298507
2231581,1,B0007QJ1U2,"Carlos is neither Mexican nor original. He doesn't want us to get offended by his empty racial jabs (which don't offend me), but I do take offense at his ripping off other, better comedians. It's not an easy thing to come up with material...well, good material anyway. Think of it like a song or a novel. If you wrote a terrific song, performed it at some club and then heard a crappier version of it, recorded by another band, on the radio wouldn't it bother you? Why is comedy any different? If you think it is, then by all means buy this hack's junk, but if you respect integrity don't support this jerk.",1137456000,10,607,4.380530973451328
