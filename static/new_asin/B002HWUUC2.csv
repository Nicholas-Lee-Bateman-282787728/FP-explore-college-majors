8370577,1,B002HWUUC2,"This movie was a major disappointment. The acting was poor and overexaggerated by al of the actors except for one of the main characters who played the wife. The plot was great however, and with beeter stage presentation--would have really shined through. There were so many annoyances throughout this movie. Beginning with a secretary with out of control hormones, dress attire at a place of employment, One was the camera man's continuant effort in showing the couples home which was definitely not a mansion of any kind-- but that of a low income home where two educated people who carried great employment resided. The mother in law who came to visit her son brought along with her another son who had persobality issues throughout the movie. As he flirted with his brothers wife throughout the movie AND eventually asked her to allow her to impregnate her so he and his mother could return back home in Africa..(geez)..it was very difficult compaing him from a straight or a gay man. The mother in law was high strung, unmoving, and opinionated with very vindictive ways. The son has problems standing up for his wife which shows african culture as overbearing and pretty ruthless to say the least. His wife was an American however, who loved her husband, and remained with him through his families unexpected visit, and visit from hell.
The movie is not worth the viewing or money sadly for the one actress who should have chosen a better movie to star in. Truly bad PR for her booking agent.",1297382400,,1498,4.787644787644788
8370578,3,B002HWUUC2,"This movie was ok. It was low budget and, reminded me of an Nigerian movie. Overall, I would probably not have purchased it because the story line was not very developed and, the acting was not very good. Except for Tanji Miller, the rest of the actors seemed unprofessional. Overall it was a 3. It was definitely not worth more than the few dollars I paid.",1283558400,2,357,4.424242424242424

8370580,4,B002HWUUC2,"I really enjoyed the video. It kinda made me look at my marriage in a different light. I am an American and I too am married to a man from Africa. Some cultural traditions that were brought up I am dealing with. Overall it was a good movie and I enjoyed it. Of course, some things are not true in every relationship but we all have those days and situations.",1281916800,,358,4.128571428571429

I strongly recommend it.",1257724800,9,230,4.609756097560975
