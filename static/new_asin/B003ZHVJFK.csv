4233925,3,B003ZHVJFK,"Tekken is a great franchise. The plot is typical movie fair that deviates from the game. The use of some characters like Christie,Kazuya, Nina, Anna, and Eddie Gordo are ridiculous. The costume designs and acting are fairly decent, the actions scenes are a mixed bag of good and you've got to be kidding me.  The story focuses too much on Jin and that is the main flaw. (When did Jin become the main hero???) Jin does not enter the Tekken until the third game. The story feels rushed and while the costume designs and some fights are spot on the movie never really feels like Tekken. It's an enjoyable Martial Arts movie that would have been better served to be called King of Iron Fist as opposed to Tekken. Jin and Heihachi are done ok but the rest of the characters are not even close. This movie is on par with Street Fighter but doesn't even come close to the great first Mortal Kombat movie. Hollywood has to find the perfect match between satisfying fans and making great film. With popular examples and epic fails they should have gotten this right. Decent movie worth a rental and if you are a collector buy it.",1302652800,2,1120,4.490196078431373
4233926,3,B003ZHVJFK,"The story is weak, and quiet similar to most of the movies, not original. Characters are okay. I could say it was more or less exciting to watch some of them fight. At the start I would give it 1 star, but then as I continued to watch, in the end I decided that it was okay. If there ever will be Tekken 2, it must be nothing like this movie. I wouldn't call it boring, but it was nothing special. The movie is okay to watch, if there is nothing else to choose from.",1301961600,,466,3.9157894736842107
4233927,4,B003ZHVJFK,"This is a review of the blu-ray from WB Japan. It has yet to recieve an American release, which is a shame.

The movie itself is actually not bad. It's very unfortunate that not only did Crystal Sky (the studio) drop the ball in getting this film released, but the internet kids and their relentless complaints that this isn't faithful to the game. The game's storyline wouldn't work in a film! Get real. While Tekken does lack some other things from the game that could have been in the film (the Devil Gene), it actually works surprisingly well, despite some big flaws.

This film commenced production during the 2007-2008 WGA strike...and I think that could have hurt, because the story and script needed a little bit of polish. It starts off very well, but ends up extremely rushed by the second half of the movie. Also, many of the characters who do show up have little or nothing to do at all...especially the sexy Williams sisters. With all said, this movie isn't quite as bad as some say. The acting is surprisingly strong (especially Jon Foo and Ian Anthony Dale), and it has a pretty cool aesthetic look, despite the film's low to mid budget. Tekken's bumpy production history is a sad tale, as in the end, the film was really just setting the foundations for what could have been a rather cool franchise. I really hope people go out and support this flick when it finally has it's US release, because it's really quite above the average video game adaptation. Stay tuned until after the credits for a little surprise.

The blu-ray is decent enough, it has great audio and video, but it does lack on the extras. The extras are a lengthy on set Q&A with the film's crew and cast (minus director Dwight Little, and actors Jon Foo and Kelly Overton), an online theatrical release Q&A with Jon Foo, a seven minute behind the scenes look. You can find the same thing on the DVD, if you have a region free.

All in all, this is kinda worth it if you've been waiting for a Tekken movie, and aren't expecting total faithfulness. It's a darn good effort, but a little sad that it didn't get the budget or respect it deserves.",1297900800,7,2126,4.528645833333333
4233928,5,B003ZHVJFK,"When a movie based on a video game is announced, the thoughts ""oh no, not another one"" or ""that killed it..."" come to most peoples' mind. However, some actually turn out decent. Like Tekken. I think it turned out great. A lot of action, great characters, and an okay plot(could have been a little better). You don't really have to be a fan of Tekken to enjoy the movie. It's all a matter of opinions. I personally think that some movies based of video games are really good. Sure some can have bad acting, be really short or not have actors that really look like the ones in the video game, but not all of them are bad(as i have said). I'd recommend Tekken to any Tekken fans, and people who aren't fans.",1297123200,,704,4.3007518796992485
4233929,3,B003ZHVJFK,"If nothing else, ""Tekken"" gets in my good graces just for being what it is: a flashy and ultimately decent tournament-based martial arts movie bearing an impressive cast list. The film's eventual falling point, however, is that it's based on a video game series that's so much better than decent that I can't help but lament that it isn't as awesome as what I've been able to create on arcade screens for the past sixteen years. If judged solely on these latter disadvantages, my rating for this film would be lower, but in light of my genuine appreciation for the remaining content, I'm going to consider it from a rounder perspective and name it as one of the better adaptations out there.

Like in most video game flicks, the story suffers. It's played straight and high-tech, excluding all supernatural elements from the games and seriously watering down the triangle of contempt that serves as the canon plotline between the three main characters, Jin Kazama (Jon Foo,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Protector/dp/B000I0RNWU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Protector</a>), Kazuya Mishima (Ian Anthony Dale,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat-Legacy/dp/B005H7NO5E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat: Legacy</a>), and Heihachi Mishima (Cary Tagawa,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mortal-Kombat/dp/0790729997/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mortal Kombat</a>). The film takes place in a dystopian future where the Mishima-run Tekken corporation reigns supreme over a scarred earth and sponsors a regular fighting tournament to keep the masses entertained. After the death of his mother at the hands of the organization, Jin enters the tournament to avenge her while Kazuya plots the overthrow of his father.

The backgrounds of most of the characters have been addled a bit as well, which is disappointing but I'll argue that their better-than-average casting makes up for some of this: Luke Goss (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Blade-II/dp/B00005JKWJ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Blade II</a>) as Steve Fox, Gary Daniels (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Expendables/dp/B002ZG999U/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Expendables</a>) as Bryan Fury, Darrin Henson (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Soul-Food/dp/B001675ZKG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Soul Food</a>) as Raven, Lateef Crowder (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Undisputed-III-Redemption/dp/B003FXXNH6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Undisputed III: Redemption</a>) as Eddy Gordo, Cung Le (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pandorum/dp/B002QW7ALM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pandorum</a>) as Marshall Law, and several others are swell fits, making for one of the best ensembles ever seen in a fighting-themed adaptation like this (or at least a much better one than in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-King-of-Fighters/dp/B004WSA4AW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The King of Fighters</a>). Utilization of these performers and characters, however, is another issue: Heihachi and Steve Fox are prominent characters but don't fight at all, Kazuya is written as a slimy rich boy rather than the fighting beast we know him as, and - with very few exceptions - no character besides Jin has more than a single fight.

When they do fight, however, it's mostly good stuff. Director Dwight Little hasn't done much action fare since he directed Steven Seagal and Brandon Lee during their prime, but he seems to have gotten better with age: he and choreographer Cyril Raffaelli wrangle some very competent brawls which occasionally peak as deliciously eye-opening, like during the Eddie Gordo and Bryan Fury fights. In-game fighting styles are mimicked pretty well (sans Marshall Law, whose portrayer sticks with his MMA instead of jeet kune do) and even the actors who aren't real-life martial artists come across looking tough. On the downside, almost all of the fights could've been longer, if only to do justice to the millions of times the same match-ups have taken place between gamers, and slow-motion was unquestionably overutilized. The final match between Jin and Kazuya was ruined by the movie's portrayal of the latter, but the remaining seven should all be considered generally satisfying if you're not out to hate them.

In the end, this one doesn't transcend the game-to-movie curse that we're all waiting to see shed and hardcore fans will rightfully bash the snot out of the altered storyline and missing characters, but as far as this button-masher goes, my needs have been sated...maybe not by the ideal ""Tekken"" movie, but by a good fight flick that ought to have gotten better than a direct-to-video release.",1287964800,25,4945,6.638330757341577

The movie is quite an entertaining fighting movie for what it's worth, but certainly not a very attractive and satisfying product for Tekken fans. As a Tekken fan myself, I didn't like the way the storyline was altered so drastically to a point of been discernible from the Tekken games.

I'd say watch this film without acknowledging it been part of or derived from the Tekken games will help generate better reviews.",1454544000,,645,4.972222222222222

4233950,1,B003ZHVJFK,"This tekken film was just unwatchable. Why such a bad rating ? Let me start off by saying that i've been playing tekken games since it's early stages and this film was just bad mind you not as terrible as the sequel that followed, but still sucked none the less has it was not a tekken film. The storyline of this movie does not fit in the time line of the tekken video game series. There have been 6 tournaments so far & the movie does not adept any of them, but mixes up everything & makes a huge mess out of it. Everything is just misplaced. For example: jun kazama (jin's mother) dies in tekken 2, miguel caballero rojo joins tekken 6 to avenge his sisters death, sergei dragunov entered tekken 5 to infiltrate mishima zaibatsu lab, and eddy gordo enters tekken 3 to find the murderer of his father etc. In tekken, every character has his or her own purpose of entering the tournament. In this film the actors didn't even know what they were doing there. NONE of these actors fitted the shoes of their characters.
In conclusion I mainly thought this film sucked because it just doesn't bring justice to the tekken franchise or fanbase, it just brings a random action flick however i did like the sexy christy character she was a total stunna being the only good thing about this mediocre film.",1423872000,,1297,4.453781512605042

4233968,3,B003ZHVJFK,"Tekken is an average movie based off of a video game. I deducted a star for not following the game more closely. The director tried to make it more realistic and believable, I guess.",1395273600,,182,4.382352941176471
4233969,3,B003ZHVJFK,"I like a couple things about the movie. The story of Jin entering the tournament to avenge his mother reminded me of the Tekken 3 story. Also they did a good job of making the cast look like some of the characters from the game, but not all looked as great. The story is a basic revenge story with a tournament in the mixed, nothing too complicated. They try to put emotion into it, and it's okay but nothing that'll win awards. The fighting was pretty cool, something I'd totally love if this were made in the 90's.

Now here's a list of things I felt needed improvement. (CAUTION: May contain spoilers!)

1. Why does it need to be in a dystopian world? It didn't bother me at first, but considering how story plays out, I felt the world as it is now would've been better. Again it's not so bad.

2. The Mishisma Corp should have a been a well-known and wealthy Corp that sets up tournaments. Not a World Power.

3. Characters should have spoken in their native language. It would've been cool to see Jin speak to his mother in Japanese and interact with other characters in English.

4. Jin's personality. I understand that he's a kid, but he shouldn't be going to clubs and making out with chicks. That isn't like Jin. However, I would've been okay with this if he started to act more quiet and reserved to himself after he sees his mother die. Sort of like the way Won Bin acted in the ""The Man from Nowhere"", but no, let's go party with Christie during the tournament!

5. Christie Monteiro a romantic interest? Sounds like a fanfiction I've read. Not to mention that Eddy Gordo was in the movie, but they don't even know each other or even speak. I would've had Xaioyu as a childhood friend and be somewhat of a love interest. In the game they were acquaintances.

6. Character subplots. I would've been cool to see some character plots from the game touched on. Like Nina and Anna resolving their issues. Maybe having Christie looking for Eddy. (...oh yeah, they're both in the tournament.) I did like however, that they touch on Bryan's cybernetics. I just wished they did the same for some other characters.

7. The way the Character's look. Heihachi Mishisma...really? I'm sure you could've trimmed down the hair a bit. The same goes for Bryan. Kazuya could've been handle a little better, but I didn't mind the actor from Mr. 3000 (You have hole in your @$#) Christie should've been Brazilian, but at least she nailed the sex appeal. For the most part, the characters do look the part. So kudos there.

8. Raven. Yes, this guy get's his own category. He's a ninja that can stand his own against Yoshimitsu. He wouldn't be using a gun he would be hiding in the shadows. The same way they did the ninja's from ""Ninja Assassin"", that would've been awesome!

So, those are the improvements I would make. I'm sure that some of you hardcore Tekken fans would disagree with me and probably would agree that the movie was never made. At least I did enjoy it and it did make me want to play Tekken again. Anyway, make sure you turn off your brain when watching this movie. Have fun!",1392595200,,3084,4.47153024911032

Okay, if you are a fan of any of the actual source material don't bother with this movie, this movie serves no point in existing, I can't even accept this movie as an alternate reality for the Tekken World. The reason this review is so harsh and unforgiving is because unlike other gaming franchise movies, like Street Fighter, or Resident Evil, or even the poorly adapted Super Mario Bros, Tekken's world is deeply routed in realism, not so much fantasy, like the fireball throwing worlds of Street Fighter. Also the Storyline is so simple to follow a child could write the screen play! A tournament is announced, winner is promised money and a chance at running the most powerful company in the world, people from around the world sign up, gritty underground battles occur, how can that become what this movie is?

this movie feels like the post apocalyptic world of John Connor meets Never back down, and in none of the good ways, sprinkled with a little sensuous flare and a sorted coming of age story. No character backstories are used nor fully explained, female characters fight like they think they are hot, not as a REAL MARTIAL ARTIST TRYING TO TAKE HIS OPPONENT DOWN! Oh race is an issue for me, Kelly Overton, an American girl with a tan plays Christie Monteiro a woman who is Brazilian in the games, Yoshimitsu gives a guess appearance as well as a few others, but its lackluster. Also a random threesome with Anna, Nina, and Kazuya occurs in an attempt at making Kazyua look like a boss....

Just as an actual movie it screams ""Scifi Original"" but as an adaptation it FAILS EPICALLY!!

Fighting games are known for having convoluted and awkward storylines and its nice to see that they didn't really bother with that here.  Beyond having the basics of the Mishima-Kazama clan down and how they're all related to each other, the movie doesn't take a whole lot from the games.  The people who made the film evidently at least watched footage of the series however, since they seem to realize its all about fighting.

Aesthetically, the movie has a lot in common with the dystopian sci-fi flicks of the late 80s and early 90s and like movies with names like Escape From New York, the quality of the acting is about the same.  There's some competence from the leads but the supports and backups are all dreadful.  Tekken is by no means oscar-worthy material but if you are able to divorce it from the inconsistencies with the story in the game franchise, it is a pretty decent popcorn flick.  The film quality is excellent and some of the fights are very good.  The film doesn't demonstrate a lot of real world logic and I'm not sure if that's because they couldn't be bothered to write good dialogue or if they realized the dialogue was just filler in between the fight scenes but either way there's a lot of (usually unintentional) humor in between the fight scenes.  I was definitely entertained by the movie however.  I'd give it a solid thumbs up to anyone who is into cheese and over-the-top action with a touch of overacting.  If you're a serious fan of the game franchise however, it's probably a solid avoid since they definitely didn't bother to familiarize themselves with the actual storyline from the games.",1368403200,,1882,4.635542168674699

4233989,5,B003ZHVJFK,"I love the tekken franchise, it has always been a pleasure playing them. I remember seeing the trailer for this, and I thought it looked awesome. So I had pre ordered it on blu ray/dvd/digital copy combo pack. Prior to this film, there was the hit tekken anime film from 1997.

Story: This film takes place in the future. Kazuya, Heihachi, Jun, and Steve Fox are older. The city is living under a marshall law, run by a military, and Jin is a skilled street fighter trained by his mother, Jun Kazama. After ""Heihachi"" fires a missle at jin's house, killing his mother, jin decides to join the Iron fist tournament. Jin wins an open fight call against marshall law. He is then known as the people's choice and is sent to the Iron fist tournament. Steve fox is guiding Jin through the iron fist tournament. The second and best fight of the film is Raven vs Eddie Gordo. Jin fights his way to get revenge on heihachi mishima, unaware that he is his grandfather, and kazuya is his father. Jin meets a sweet gal, Christie montero. The story is great, the concept is great, stays true to the game in every way.

Casting: Jin was casted perfectly, he has the hair, the tattoo, the body, the hoodie, and even the fighting style. Heihachi looks almost identical. Kazuya still has the scar on his face, he still has his sadistic side. Marshall law delivers some great fighting moves as he does in the game, good casting over there. Raven, again looks identical to the game, no joke. Eddie gordo, one of my favorite characters. Miguel roja, nice casting, looks like the character. Jun kazama looks great. Steve fox, he has aged because he is in the future, but he looks good. Sergei dragonov, another one of my favorite characters, well casted. Yoshimitsu, a master swordsman, looks awesome. Nina and anna williams, they look as great as always. Bryan fury was more than I had expected! Great casting by all actors.

Fight scenes: These are the most well choreographed fight scenes I have ever scene. Within the fight between Eddie gordo and Raven, you notice how well choreographed gordo's moves are, they are literally taken from the game. The way raven reverses gordo's move is beyond me. Jin's actor is clearly a skilled fighter. The actor playing marshall law is a real fighting champion. The final fight of the film is totally epic, I was stunned by the total non stop action.

Blu ray quality: The blu ray quality is great, so is the dvd quality. The digital copy downloads perfectly onto your PC. The set comes with the making of the film.

Final Word: This is definitely one of my favorite video game adaptations of all time. This is a tekken must have. I hear they are currently working on a prequel entitled ""Tekken Rise of the tournament."" Cannot wait for that. There is not a single thing about this film that could be better. I will be reviewing Tekken blood vengeance soon, and tekken 1997. There are many great video game films out there but this is one of the best.",1358899200,3,2971,4.577067669172933

if you're NOT a tekken fan, you'll probably be disappointed.  the story line is cliche and most of the filming is too dark to really appreciate some of the details to the martial arts techniques.  also, the fight scenes and moves are very digitally enhanced, so there's probably not much pure martial arts in here to draw fans outside of the video game fan base.",1353715200,2,518,4.48936170212766

I still make fun of it for how much it says Tekken throughout the film, they changed the name of the city and corporation to Tekken City and the Tekken Corporation. I am fairly certain that the did this so you would remember what piece of garbage movie you were watching. One of the two characters I wanted to see in it wasn't in it and the other was just mangled into something completely different than how he is in the games.

4233998,2,B003ZHVJFK,"I bought this movie at Movie Stop bc I had finally found it after waiting 2 years for it. The Tekken Movie is another one of those failed adaptions, right there with the Street Fighter movie, and Dragonball Movie. Much better than the Dragonball movie, but probably even with the Street Fighter movie. Complete lack of thought as far as the story is concerned. Not 1 reference to the Devil curse (Which can be excused). Kazuya Mishima has major character flaws. He is too whiny, and not nearly vicious enough to be the real Kazuya Mishima. Plus he has a goatee in this movie (O.O) wtf?! Heihachi Mishima was ok but yet more character flaws. He was a much more honorable man in the movie than he is in the games. In the games he is a bitter old man with a hatred for his son and grandson. Not the case in this movie. Jin Kazama was probably the better part of the movie. The outfits were all spot on, but relevance and character was lacking big time. Jin has a smaller build than he should have had which can also be excused considering it is supposed to be a younger Jin Kazama. You can tell its a low budget film as the entire Anvil part of the movie looks like stage props from a play. The only other issues I care to point out are Christie and Nina. Nina Williams has always been one of the 5 Star fighters in the games. She was always a pain in the ass to beat but Christie disposes of her like she is nothing. Unacceptable. Also Christie is not using Capoera like she, and Eddy Gordo use in the games. Eddy uses it in the movie but not Christie. Beside these great flaws in the movie, it was worth 1 watch but I am going to trade it in a movie stop. If you know nothing about the Tekken story then you will likely enjoy it, the fight scenes are excellent minus the fighting style mishaps. 2 Stars.",1337644800,,1802,4.210982658959537

4234003,2,B003ZHVJFK,"I was totally disappointed when I watched this movie. The action didn't live up hype or even came to the level of action noted in the video games. The selection of fighters was highly questionable as well as their fight scenes. There was more action in the general stunts rather than the actual fights. This was a let down. They could have used CGI to display more complex fighters e.g. Jacks (weak- used average people in military-Goth gear), Yoshimitsu (weak-used a stunt man non MA), King (not in the movie)), but they didn't.

Did I say this movie was a down. However, if you are a collector of Gary Daniels movies you might want to add this to your collection. Gary plays Bryan Fury. The casting for this movie was about 40% on target, the use of the martial artist was highly questionable. There was a lot of open space i.e. lag time scenes and not enough action. It didn't keep my attention. I stopped and pulled out one of my reference books to go over my notes at times. My wife had to ask me to watch this with her. It was disappointing when you are suppose to have highly skilled MA fighters like Nina Williams and you have her and her sister in a questionable position (unless you are twisted and have no moral you may like this suggestive scene). Martial Law's fight scenes were also questionable. Steve Scott's role was questionable and  you have an unknown Russian fighter not in any of the games in the movie.

Hopefully they'll make a sequel with a bigger budget, better writing, and more characters from the game.

4234006,5,B003ZHVJFK,"Pretty good movie. Kind of reminded me of the original mortal kombat movie that came out in the 90's.

4234007,2,B003ZHVJFK,"For starters, don't let the title fool you. This film has about as much to do with Tekken as the Friday the 13th films have to do with the television show. They used the names and some of the character designs, but nothing else (and only very little of even that). The movie bears a closer resemblance to Bloodsport crossed with Blade Runner.

In terms of plot, it's rather clich. If you've watched more than one Kung Fu flick in your lifetime, chances are you've already seen everything they do here. It's a typical plot about a young fighter who enters a tournament to get revenge for the death of a loved one. It's got an artificial romantic subplot, one-dimensional filler characters, an archetypical villain, stormtroopers, etc... I don't really mind that they didn't stick to Tekken bible, but if they were going to change things the least they could've done was come up with something original. Instead we get a movie we've seen a thousand times before, but with different actors. Yay?

The Cinematography is terrible. Apparently Mr. Little is one of those directors who thinks that violently shaking the camera during action scenes as though you have epilepsy adds tension or some sense of danger. All it does is make it very difficult to tell what is going on, and gives you a headache. Everybody says the fight choreography is great but I honestly couldn't tell you, I had no idea what was going on half the time.

In the end this is neither a tekken movie nor a good action flick. You're much better of watching an old Bruce Lee flick or just playing the video games than investing in this thing. My advice? Stay away!",1319760000,,1629,4.629757785467128
4234008,2,B003ZHVJFK,"""Tekken"" (meaning ""Iron Fist"") is a live-action film of popular fighting game series. Some of you will say ""Not again."" Back in the 90s we saw terrible ""Street Fighter"" starring Jean-Claude Van Damme, and more recently, equally terrible ""Street Fighter: The Legend of Chun-Li."" Good news is that at least the leading star of the new film Jon Foo can do martial arts action, if not as charismatic as Jet Li. Bad news is, well, none of the filmmakers seems to know how to shoot action scenes.

""Tekken"" is set in the near futuristic dystopian world. North America is under control of the powerful Mishima Zaibatsu, which also hosts a martial arts tournament ""The King of Iron Fist Tournament."" Having lost his mother Jun (Tamlyn Tomita), a young fighter Jin (Jon Foo) enters the ""kill-or-be-killed"" competition, seeking revenge on the man who is responsible for her death: Heihachi Mishima (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa).

The story is silly, I know. But all we want is exiting action, and the film has a few decent set-pieces in the first half of the film. Luke Goss as Jin's manager is pretty good. Kelly Overton as Christie Monteiro, a fighter and love interest (yes, she is) is not bad. I also admire Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa for not refusing to do the character's unique hairstyle.

[Minor Spoiler in This Paragraph]
However, the film gets worse as it reaches the film's underwhelming wrap-up. Action scenes become repetitive. Characters tend to repeat the same moves, and worst of all, martial arts sequences, which should be the center of the movie, are interrupted by gunshots ... twice! And as to the Williams sisters, one of them just stands and does nothing else. I don't see the point of turning a video game into a film in this way.",1317081600,,1731,4.821548821548822
4234009,4,B003ZHVJFK,"Spoiler Alert!

Okay 4 out of 5 stars for a video game based movie that's excellent!!! I liked how this movie actually tried to make the movie like the video game. In the beginning and in the middle the story was really good. After that at some point the story just goes crazy and doesn't make sense, well at least to me it didn't.

At the end of the film, which I hated that the most, the writers made way too much room for a second movie. I think that's where they made the biggest mistake and I would had given it 5 stars. This is what I would had expected to see for an ending. Jin wins the tournament, and then Jin and Christine start off helping change the world they live in for the better. Jin has just won Tekken and now he is KING of the fighters and also the head of the company. He has the power to change the world as he sees it now. Also, he has the people vote. Jin and Christine should live happy ever after with each other too. But no, that doesn't happen.

What happens at the end of the movie? When Jin wins, I see him say ""I'm going home"". He then hurries and leaves the place. The narrator then says ""this is just the beginning."" What kind of ending was that? He just won king of the fighters! This is what he wanted to do from the start and he fought so hard to do. He doesn't show any joy or emotion about it. He looks stone cold dead and leaves the place like he is pissed. WHAT???

Also, he doesn't stay with Christine at the end? I thought they really liked each other. Well, that's what I saw in the movie because it sure looked like there was a love story brewing. What worse about the movie is, why does he have to go in the first place? Where is he going go? His home is Tekken! His old house that he was living in actually blew up. Is he going to rebuild it or something? Why? He has a whole corporation and he can live anywhere he wants. So, he should actually head upstairs.

The scene where he starts walking with people in the city towards the camera is good. It is just done wrong where the narrator should had said something like Jin is the new boss and he going to change the world with Christine by his side.",1315958400,,2147,4.054245283018868

The lead actor looks nothing like Kazuya from the game. It has little-to-no originality and borrows ideas from other films. The settings looks like it could be or is part of the Universal Studios backlot tour and that's a bad thing in this case. The villains are 1-D at best. It also takes itself too seriously for it's own good. There are better fight scenes but they fail to help the film in the long run. While this is better then the anime verison,it's still a bad film.

Despite what professional reviewers have been saying about the movie, I personally thought it was a decent martial arts movie. Like most videogame movie adaptions, people are going to pan over this movie and claim it doesn't do the series justice..to which I say- not every movie can have a million dollar budget so certain liberties have to be taken with it. I don't really think the game's storyline would have fit too well in a film, honestly. In that measure, I think Director Dwight Little did an awesome job. The film was entertaining and kept my attention all the way through to the end.

The only gripe that I had with the movie was I felt that the fights didn't last long enough onscreen and the camera could've been a little more focused instead of jumping all around the action so much.

Still, I liked the film. It did what I hoped it'd do and that was entertain me. To me, that's all that matters in the end. Not naming names but it was alot better than other videogame movies out there to date.",1313712000,2,1251,4.502202643171806
4234014,3,B003ZHVJFK,"It seemed that in the 90's tons of video games that were popular in the 80's were being turned into movies. It was a logical extension as there was tons of action taking place in each game and players were putting themselves into the middle of it. That is as long as the movies were based on first person action games and not things like Tetris. Most of those movies were popular enough with MORTAL KOMBAT going so far as to have a sequel, but the fad died off for a time. It's come back with a vengeance in the past few years and now yields TEKKEN based on the fighting game.

The year is 2039 and the world is ruled by corporations rather than governments. The old world fell some years back and the corporations filled the voice, taking over and controlling the masses. What was once the United States is now ruled by the largest corporation of them all, Tekken.

But things haven't changed with the exception of walls that divide one social class from another. Outside is a life of poverty and trying to survive, inside a world of luxury and technology. Protecting this way of life are the armed soldiers who rain down on the lower class should they try and move upward.

Jin Kazama (Jon Foo) is a young man who works the streets doing everything from stealing for the resistance movement to finding whatever it takes to survive. His mother Jun (Tamilyn Tomita) has done her best with him, training him in martial arts to learn the beauty of it more so than the power. But Jin still has much to learn.

When the Tekken soldiers raid the resistance and connect Jin to the latest tech theft, they set out to catch him. Their leader Kazuya (Ian Anthony Dale) makes the decision not to capture anyone in Jin's home but to blow it up instead with Jun and a few soldiers still inside. Jin watches as his mother dies and blames the leader of Tekken, Heihachi Mishima (Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) for her death.

A chance to get back at Heihachi arrives in a competition known as the King of the Iron Fist. Combatants have been involved for years but there is always a people's choice involved, someone who bests the competitor Marshall Law if they can. Jin enters this street tournament and wins, giving him a chance to go into the city and to become involved in the competition locating him one step closer to Heihachi.

The man in charge of the street competition is Steve Fox (Luke Goss) and he joins Jin as his manager. Fox knows the ins and outs of the game, knows the weaknesses of the other fighters and helps Jin to learn his own limitations and how to do better. Their first fight results in a win for Jin and earns him the inquisitive eye of Kazuya.

Backstage fighting goes on not just among the fighters but in the house of Tekken as well. Heihachi doesn't believe that Kazuya is ready to take over as the ruler of the house, but Kazuya has no patience to wait for his time. Instead he plots a take over and sets out to follow through with the Iron Fist competition in the background.

But wait there's more! Jin has a connection to the Tekken clan that no one is aware of with the exception of Kazuya. And it's one that he doesn't plan on letting anyone else learn about so he sends someone to kill Jin before he can compete again. When that fails, he ousts Heihachi as ruler, takes over and changes the rules of the game. It is now a competition where each fighter can win only with the death of the other.

All will be revealed before the final reel and a one on one match between Jin and Kazuya takes place. Who wins? Oh come on, I won't spoil it but you have to know already.

The film has a well shot look to it but falls back on the stereotypical ""end of the world"" look, a set design that involves combining bits and pieces of scrap metal into homes covered with dirt and grime. It's a set design that's been used since the first Mad Max film and ever since. And inside the city? More gleaming glass and high rises like most films of this kind.

The best thing in the film is the fight choreography, set up by Cyril Raffaelli. If you've seen DISTRICT B13 or the sequel then you've seen Raffaelli in action. He does a great job here and will be someone to keep an eye on in the future.

The movie itself reminded me of those old game to movie films made in the 90's and if you were a fan of those movies you'll get a kick (no pun intended) out of this one. It's pure escapist action and if that's what you're looking for you'll find it here.",1313366400,,4451,4.311004784688995
4234015,4,B003ZHVJFK,"This is a five-star movie for those who like to watch other people play video games. In our corporate run post-apocalyptic world, society has digressed to those who work for corporations and those who thrive off the black market in the slums. Jin, who has been taught marshal arts by his mother, is an excellent street fighter. When his mother is killed by the corporation, Jin, who was a side line player, vows revenge against the leader of the corporation Tekken. He then enters the Iron Fist competition as the ""People's Choice"" as a way to get access to the leader (""Death Race 2000"").

The movie copied many memorable aspects of other fight/apocalyptic movies. It bares similarities to ""Soylent Green,"" ""Running Man,"" ""Rollerball,"" and ""Thunderdome."" One fighter says, ""Do you know where you're at? You're at [not Thunderdome] Iron Fist."" Similarities between this and various ""Rocky"" films is also noticeable. The movie uses a heavy metal grinding music for its many fight scenes.

The movie takes a number of small twists as there are forces within Tekken that want Jin to succeed, but more powerful forces that want him dead.

Lines form other movies come to my mind: ""Two men enter, one man leaves."" ""Luke, I am your father."" ""Get up Rock!"" and ""I'm not going to kill the Agorn.""

The movie runs fairly cliche and is designed for a young teen (male) audience.

No f-bombs, brief sex scene, and was that brief nudity at the disco? Kelly Overton's butt crack.",1313280000,,1466,4.824701195219124

4234017,1,B003ZHVJFK,"Negatives:
(1.) There's a reason Redbox gets so many of these ""never heard of it"" straight to DVD movies because studios are trying to salvage some money from failed production investments.
(2.) A remake of gaming is a hollow excuse for praise because gaming stole the concepts from dozens of apocalyptic city-country movies which have been made for decades - there was nothing new in the story; in the sets; and in the really bad fight arts.
(3.) Not even worth $1. Not even worth fast forwarding which is the customary way to quickly end the suffering. After 5 minutes I just did 10 minute progress checks.
(4.) The arts looked more like ballet practice with the highly edited and trick camera angles turning the kicks, unfortunately, into dance stretching exercises. The few simplistic wire routines looked amateurish. The costumes looked like made-for-TV designed wardrobes. Acting - the nicest thing one could say is that they tried. I think.

Positive:
Even more appreciation now for these recent arts releases: ""Man from Nowhere"", ""Legend of the Fist"", ""Ip Man 2"", and the ""The Warrior's Way"".",1313020800,,1100,4.978260869565218
4234018,2,B003ZHVJFK,"Growing up playing the Tekken games, the idea of a live-action Tekken film brought back memories of seeing other fighting games brought to the big screen, namely the Mortal Kombat films, two abysmal Street Fighter flicks, and the gloriously bad Dead or Alive adaptation from a few years back.  Combine that with the fact that the Tekken games feature so many characters with such convoluted backstories and storylines that it would be incredibly difficult to fit even a handful of them into a film and have it make a lick of sense...but here we are with Tekken the movie.  John Foo plays Jin Kazama, a young and talented martial artist living in a post-apocalyptic future run by the Mishima organization and led by father Heihachi (Mortal Kombat's Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa) and his evil son Kazuya (Ian Anthony Dale).  After the death of Jin's mother, Jin sets his sights on the Mishima's by entering the King of Iron Fist Tournament, and soon runs into an assortment of familiar names like Christie (the smoking Kelly Overton), Steve Fox (Luke Goss), Bryan Fury (Gary Daniels), and Raven (Darrin Dewitt Henson), while also having brief interactions with characters like sisters Nina and Anna Williams, Eddy Gordo, Dragunov, and Marshall Law.  It's flashy, and even a little fun to a degree, but for the most part Tekken is lacking in all the departments that it appears to promise to the viewer in terms of martial arts action and mayhem.  Not to mention the fact that the cast is so over-the-top and some of the casting choices are beyond questionable.  Still though, it's better than any of the live action Street Fighter flicks ever were, so with that being said you could certainly do a lot worse.",1312416000,,1698,4.837931034482758
4234019,2,B003ZHVJFK,"Once again! Another failure to the live-action movies based on videogames. I mean... Mortal Kombat is the best but Max Payne, Prince of Persia, Resident Evil, Hitman, Final Fantasy S.W. and Silent Hill were so-so and the rest is garbage. Tekken didn't sucked but at least it's better than the animated movie that was made in the late 90's or early 2000's.

I still think that Tekken is a failure because many cool characters from the videogame were RUINED in this movie (especially Jin), many cool characters from the videogame were not in this movie, some characters didn't fought at all, some good fights were very short, and the storyline was a mess.

NOW! It wasn't THAT bad because some fights were pretty cool and the dark environment did matched with the videogame but it wasn't good enough for me. At least it wasn't sooo stupid as Dead or Alive, Street Fighters, Mortal Kombat Annihilation or King of Fighters.

If you like movies like Bloodsport or Best of the Best then you can give this one a little chance but if you want good movies based on videogames then pass on this one. Tekken is not so good for a videogame movie.

I liked DOA and was hoping it would be similar to that movie. Unfortunately, it was as bad as Street Fighter. It also makes me think of the Dragonball: Evolution fail. I only gave it 2 stars because at least Cary-Hiroyuki Tagawa visually made a good Heihachi Mishima. Lateef Crowder was a good Eddy Gordo. Jon Foo made a decent Jin but he's not even Japanese. The fight scenes were wack. This movie was so low budget, they couldn't afford Donnie Yen to play Marshall Law. If you do watch it, then there is something after the end credits. I hope this is redone right! I leave you with a fitting line from the movie: ""Defeat is a choice, so is victory.""

Looking to avenge the death of his mother at the hands of the Tekken group, Jin (Foo) fights his way to the tournament.  I was very surprised at how much I enjoyed this movie.  Very, very entertaining with very good fighting scenes.  It also stayed very close to the video game, complete with the pick-a-fighter sections.  The downfall of this movie is the same problem with all video game movies though.  When the movie is just the one-on-one fighting sequences like the game has it is very strong and fun to watch.  When it tries to add a story aspect and a plot is where it begins to drag.  But the filmakers knew this I think and the movie never strays too far from the tournament aspect for too long.  Overall, much better then I expected, and knowing it's a video game you will have certain expectations going in.  I give it a B.

Would I watch again? - I actually might.

4234028,2,B003ZHVJFK,"Tekken Is a very popular video game franchise. It's had an animated film in the past which has been voted one of the worst animes of all time by animenewsnetwork.com, but of course if your a fan of Tekken you'll want to watch it. Same goes with this movie. I've been playing Tekken since I was two years old, so of course I'm going to get my hands on anything I can find that's Tekken. I know the Tekken story line inside and out and of course like most games turned into movies they ruined it! Heihachi is a good guy, Christie is white and plays Jin's love interest instead of Ling, There is a sex scene with Nina and Anna, Oh the list goes on!! Then the only fighting style the got right was Edy's! -__- the plus side is the costumes were great, the actors looked pretty much like the characters in the game.

Not a real fan of the video game franchise that this movie is based on, but Anchor Bay/Starz does pull in the occasional good movie here and then. So when looking for some time to kill I decided to watch this out of no other reason to watch a good action movie, thankfully I got what I wanted and more.

In a distant future where the War on Terror had destroyed most of the governments of the world, the corporations took over and became the ruling power over their nations. With each sharing dominance via a series of competitive money making tournaments called Tekken. But amidst the order, discontent and the desire to fight back a young man with dreams to do something with his life becomes embroiled in a rage to do something after the death of his family.

Jin Kazama a young man living in what was once the United States of America breaks out of the slums of his home and enters the world of competitive martial arts tournament. All the while catching the attention of certain powerful being that views him as a threat. Still he is not alone as he gains the respect and attention of the lovely Christy Monteiro. As well as the power that of the populace that fuels this tournament.

I don't know the video game other than its name. But the action is great, reminiscent of Mortal Kombat and Gladiator. The cast is appealing both in attractiveness and in their charisma.  Its still very limited in its scope but it has plenty of great moments.
