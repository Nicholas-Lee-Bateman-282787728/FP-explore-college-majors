554678,5,6303058736,"During my shopping in the mall, I found this DVD called ""An Animated Christmas"" It features Santa and The Three Bears and The Little Christmas Burro, it was priced right and seeing that my two kids are 4 and 6 years old, I purchased it.  What a pleasure it was to find a nice family Christmas film without violence. These two films are a wonderful treat, make sure that you go out and buy them for your children.  It's too bad that they don't make more DVDs like this one.",976579200,9,472,4.233333333333333
554712,3,6303058736,Okay. Could have done more with bear families and varieties. A bit too preachy on global warming worship and didn't explain half the points (which is normal for that argument). Felt like I'd get more detail on a National Geographic special.,1439251200,2,240,4.878048780487805

554814,4,6303058736,This 40 minute documentary was perfect for introducing our grandkids to the three species of bears in North America prior to our camping trip through Western Canada and Alaska.,1401408000,,176,5.103448275862069
554815,4,6303058736,Good for kids. Not violent but informative and educational. Beautiful visuals of the animals and landscape. Nice change from cartoons.,1391644800,3,134,5.75
554816,2,6303058736,"Bears has nice photography but little content. There is a value for someone who never watches nature documentaries, and the film may spur a heightened sense of conservation for these magnificent creatures. It's also obvious that many of the scenes use trained stunt bears and other trained wildlife. Another flaw is that this documentary mentions several of the world's bear species at the beginning but only continues on with the North American species.",1373846400,,454,5.232876712328767
554817,2,6303058736,"Cute TV show, but the video transfer is terrible.  Like watching something from the 1930's.",1217980800,,91,5.066666666666666
554818,2,6303058736,The best thing about this DVD is the cover.  It had terrible graphics and general info.  I was looking forward to leaning something new about bears and was given a docum. largely on N. American bears.,1207353600,,200,4.527777777777778
554819,5,6303058736,"This was a very good imax film.  Had couple of views that show bears running right up to the screen towards the viewer.  Just saw this film at the imax today and had to come here to buy.  If you are ever in Alaska, Chris and Ken Day of Emerald Air Service (that were on this film) are great guides.  It is an incredible experience to get close to the bears shown in this film.",1202342400,,376,3.973333333333333
554820,2,6303058736,I THOUGHT I WOULD LIKE THIS BUT I WAS SADLY DICAPOINTED. I THOUGHT ALL IMAX MUST BE GOOD BUT IT WASNT. BIG LET DOWN.,1180310400,,116,3.875
554821,5,6303058736,"I got this DVD on a sale where it was marked down to about $5.00.  I didn't expect it to be high quality.  I was pleasantly surprised.  I've watched wildlife films and read wildlife pubs for nearly 40 years and rarely have I seen such beautiful cinematography.  One reviewer panned this film and it was an unwarranted critique in my view.  There was plenty of information, eye-popping photography, and no preachy tone.  If I'd have paid $30, I would have felt it was well-spent.

Whenever I hear someone complain about a nature/wildlife film being too preachy, it makes me wonder if they're not fans of nature to begin with or if they're hunters.  One cannot praise or preach enough about the beauty of nature and the need to preserve it.  This film merely informs and captures the majestic beauty of a species and its territory.",1163808000,9,829,4.662068965517242
554822,5,6303058736,I love bears and this is a wonderful way to see them. Well done.,1162684800,2,64,3.642857142857143
554853,1,6303058736,"Generally good photography is marred by unfocused editing -- as if the editors believed viewers have a very short attention span. Voice over is overly preachy and political. They should have focused on Bears, their habitat, habits, and behavior and left out the political preaching. Turn off the audio and enjoy, but there are better videos to be had. Look elsewhere first.

Note: Much of the footage was done with trained bears but portrayed as if it was wild nature captured on film. This sort of ""nature"" film technique went out of style with the scandals of the early Disney nature films. Too bad it had to resurface here.",1156118400,9,626,4.743119266055046

554855,2,6303058736,"My three year old daughter loves Care Bears, and she likes to watch this collection of three short stories.  However, I feel this entire DVD is really creepy.  The first story starts with ""monsters"" hiding in a little girl's closet -- jumping out to scare her once her Mommy leaves the room.  The other stories demonstrate really poor writing, and strike me really as rather creepy.  If you want your preschooler to sleep in his or her own bed, then I suggest you skip this title.",1145404800,,480,4.546511627906977
554856,4,6303058736,"My 2 1/2-year-old loves this DVD. Granted its not for putting kids to sleep, but traditionally that requires turning the TV off.  This DVD is a safe addition to any non-violent children's entertainment.",1118448000,,202,5.121212121212121
554857,5,6303058736,MARENGO FILMS HAS JUST RE-MASTERED THESE TWO CHRISTMAS ANIMATED FILMS. THERE ARE NO SUB-TITLES FOR THESE FILMS... THUS THE REVIEW FROM GREECE IS HIGHLY SUSPECT. THE FILMS ARE FOR YOUNG CHILDREN... IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR GOOD WHOLESOME WAYS TO ENTERTAIN THEM... THIS DVD IS A BARGAIN.,1108080000,,283,5.042553191489362
554858,1,6303058736,I cannot believe that this DVD is marketed as a DVD to put children to sleep - It's enough to give them nightmares!  Two minutes into the DVD a blue creepy villain appears and the whole CD has villains in it - It scared my 3 year old so much she still talks about it.  Do not buy this DVD.  I cannot emphasis this enough!,1106179200,8,321,3.9076923076923076
554859,5,6303058736,"My children grew up with this video.  It was, by far, their favorite.  Gary and Bill appeal to kids and their music is very catchy and easy to sing along with.

I have now bought the video for my grandchildren.  Another generation will grow up loving Gary and Bill.",1104969600,,265,4.346938775510204
554860,5,6303058736,"This video works wonders with our 1 1/2 year-old son. The songs are catchy and fun; they are great to listen to before bed-time, or anytime. Rosenshontz apparently were big back in the 80's. I remember them, but as a 32 year-old now, I was not at the right age to get into them back then. Now that I have a toddler, I can understand their following in the past. It's kind of a shame that there were not more videos put out other than this one (at least this is the only one I can come across). My wife and I have searched for more Rosenshontz videos, but have only found this one as well as some audio CD's(not nearly as fun as the video). Strange to think that the eighties are beginning to be 'back in the day', however aside from the obvious dated styles and animated parts, the video was right-on in the kid appeal department. Our son loves it.",1041033600,,848,4.208588957055214
554861,4,6303058736,"""Bears"" takes the viewer into the wilds of many areas of the world to get up-close views of these majestic animals. Like most IMAX films, there is a (fairly seamless) mix of both wild and captive animals; the captive animals are used to get shots that would simply be impossible or unsafe to obtain using wild animals in their habitats. The ""making of"" featurette very clearly explains this process, and it works well in most IMAX films. There were a few times when it was apparent that the black bears being used were ""performing,"" but it was not a huge distraction from the film.
The movie is filmed in beautiful locations, really showcasing the bears' adaptation to their environments, and making crystal clear what an important part they are of the natural world. The viewer is educated on bear behavior, bear/human interaction, habitat conservation, bear awareness and safety precautions, and many other issues, all the while treating our eyes to spectacular views captured with the IMAX camera, which is unparalleled.
A great movie, highly recommended.",1041033600,34,1058,5.051428571428572

That was my goal in watching BEARS, and indeed the film transported me away from the horrific  violence in Paris and the 300 homicides so far this year in Baltimore. It worked! The film is quite beautiful and provides us with an insight into the world of BEARS everywhere. From the black bear to the polar bear, from small to large, from cubs to the challenge of competitive rivals of massive giant adult bears for the favors of a female. I have come back to the news now but for the moment refreshed by the humor and strength of BEARS. See it.",1447718400,,615,4.3478260869565215
