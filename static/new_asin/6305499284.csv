7891171,5,6305499284,This is a very well acted intense movie & should be put on DVD. Filmed after another great mini series Roses are for the Rich with fellow actor Joe Penney.,1373932800,,155,4.2
7891172,5,6305499284,"This movie starring Joe Penny and Lisa Hartman Black has well fleshed-out characters, a strong plot, and enough twists and turns to keep Hercule Poirot scratching his head! I was surprised to find a made-for-TV movie reach this calliber.

A remake was made of it some years later with Bill Pullman, Alec Baldwin, and Nicole Kidman. Needless to say, the film, Malice, was not nearly as good. In fact, although these are big name actors who have done some good work in their time, none of them shined nearly as well as Joe Penny or Lisa Hartman Black! And the plot for Malice was convoluted at best, adding story lines that had nothing to do with the price of tea in China!

Skip this latter flick and watch The Operation (Bodily Harm). The only drawback is that it is only currently available in VHS. Hopefully that will change soon!",1299888000,5,832,4.577181208053691
7891173,5,6305499284,This is the best Joe Penny movie...  Joe and Lisa make such a good looking couple and Joe gets to show his muscles off in this too.  It's a good romantic-tragedy.  A must for any Joe Penny or Lisa Hartman fan.,1035244800,2,209,4.048780487804878
7891174,5,6305499284,"This is one of my favorite movies of all time.  The movie was fabulous all the way through...no one plays the ""cad"" better than Joe Penny!  The scene where it is finally revealed that Hartman & Penny are secret  lovers is a shocker to the first time viewer!  Also, the ""love""  scene that follows is very hot, & one of Penny's best out of all his  movies.  A must-see for all Joe Penny fans!",951868800,4,390,4.1891891891891895
