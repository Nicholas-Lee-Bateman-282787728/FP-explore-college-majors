2154345,5,B0002ZYE64,"The movie is about an almost invincible aragami wanting to end his life in a duel to the death.  Most of the movie there are two guys talking across from one another. If you have ADD don't watch this movie, but if you love a well writen samurai movie with the best duel in samurai cinema history pick this one up.",1156032000,10,313,4.131147540983607
2154346,5,B0002ZYE64,"""Aragami"" is not only a great film, but one that is very much overlooked. The film itself was directed by Ryuhei Kitamura, and clocks in at about only 79 minutes. However, for a short film, it packs in more suspense and great drama than many supernatural films I have seen. And if you are like me and enjoy samurai films, you will like the action the film delivers in such a short time span. One thing I enjoyed about the film too, was that director Ryuhei Kitamura does not throw the film at the viewer in the opening scenes, but allows the dialogue of the films two main characters to build up the suspense, which will eventually culminate into a great action duel towards the end of the film.

When I first viewed ""Aragami"" a few years ago I was really impressed with it, and thought how smart Kitamura was in being able to get this films message across in such a short amount of time that the film allows. There is no wasted dialogue in this film. The films narrative follows two main characters: A wounded samurai (Takao Osawa), who has stumbled into a Temple deep in the mountains, and the caretaker of the Temple (Masaya Kato). This fleeing samurai is seriously wounded, and has with him a wounded companion. As the two samurai arrive at the Temple, they both collapse to the Temple floor--as their wounds are serious. However, upon waking up, the samurai (Takao Osawa) finds that his wounds are not serious, and that his comrade has died. But there is more to his healing, and his fellow samurai that I do not wish to divulge and spoil for you.

Further, this is not a typical Temple sanctuary that this fleeing samurai has stumbled across. The surviving samurai's host at the temple is very strange indeed. He claims that he is the great warrior Miyamoto Musashi, who can never be defeated in battle: The ultimate samurai. With this introduction out of the way, this Lord of the Temple begins to treat the samurai very good. Giving him food to enjoy, and much drink. However, this host is about to drop a bombshell on this samurai. This Lord of the Temple tells the samurai that a Japanese demon lives in the mountains near the Temple and feeds off the flesh of men. Eventually, this host tells the samurai that he himself is none other than this very Demon.

Moreover, he tells the samurai that his name is Aragami. He challenges the samurai to a duel to the death. This demon, Aragami, cannot leave the Temple until he is defeated. It is not known how long he has been there, but like others before him, he too wandered into the Temple long ago. However, he is tired of living. Further, he will not die of old age, and since he is forbidden to kill himself, or allow himself to die at the hands of another--his only way to leave the Temple is to be defeated by a worthy opponent. Now, the question is: Even if the samurai defeats this Aragami, will he still be free? And is there no other way out of the Temple other than having a duel with this demon Aragami? Moreover, is Aragami truly invincible? Has he finally met a worthy opponent? I do not want to spoil the film for you, so I will leave this for you to watch. The ending is very good, and in fact pretty different than what you might expect. Highly recommend.",1154822400,11,3228,4.440134907251265
2154347,5,B0002ZYE64,"I am a fan of Ryuhei Kitamura, I loved AZUMI, VERSUS, THE MESSENGER and even ALIVE.
 First of all, let me give you a history of ARAGAMI THE RAGING GOD OF BATTLE(aka: Aragami:duel). This film was shot as a challenge/wager with the director of 2LDK, the rules being: shoot and finish the film in 7 days, 2-3 actors, one room and 1 character has to die. I heard Kitamura actually wrote this while he was shooting Azumi.
 The story is about 2 wounded samurai who fled to a remote temple fleeing from unseen enemies. They are greeted by a mysterious woman before losing consciousness. One samurai dies while the other samurai(TAKAO OSAWA, SKY HIGH) wakes healed from all wounds. He is greeted and fed by the lord of the temple(MASAYA KATO, Fighter in the wind). Afterwards, he is told that he is in fact a Tengu, or an Aragami who rules that mountain and feeds on human flesh for sustenance. the so-called lord of the temple has been waiting for a worthy opponent to kill him in single combat because he has lived too long.

 SPOILER ALERT: It is said that if you are fed human liver and depending on who cooks it, like the mysterious, nameless woman,(kanae Uotani, who is beautiful, THE MESSENGER, SKY HIGH)a human being may become almost immortal. Also, it was never proven, but the lord of the temple also stated that he is famous throughout the land with the name of MIYAMOTO MUSASHI(the greatest swordsman in Japanese history)There is also a great cameo appearance by the character(TAK SAKAGUCHI) in versus, if you look closely, even the katana sword in Versus was used by one of the combatants. I guess Kitamura intended this as well as make use of Props from his other films.

 The film is well-done. No conversation is wasted, and it is well-acted. There is a lot of great chemistry among the actors, hence, for a 79 minute film, it is never boring, and the sword fight at the end is among the best I've seen. Forget Anakin vs. Kenobi, this can be the fight of the year. [...]

 I would advise watching it in original Japanese dialogue, it maintains the effect and excitement as it was intended to be.
I highly recommend ARAGAMI if you are a samurai/adventure fan, or if you specially like Kitamura's films. I bought it w/out renting it, and I was glad I did!! Like Masaya Kato says: ""Things aren't always what it seems"" . People expected a weak brainless film for a movie shot in 7 days, but this film is better than most of the films made in a year.

 Enjoy!!Aragami wins over 2LDK in my opinion.
Now if only Hollywood directors will do a challenge movie made in 7 days...",1153440000,18,2577,4.52258064516129
2154348,5,B0002ZYE64,I hold heartly enjoyed this film the dark setting and dramatic exchange between the characters helped to build up to one great sword fight scene. The warrior demon and his quest to meet another warrior on his skill level only to find redemption through death to free his tormented soul but not at sacificing his great swordmanship to those he challenged. A great anticipation film with a great ending.,1151712000,10,401,4.826086956521739
2154349,5,B0002ZYE64,"The first thing to remember about this movie is that it was the other half of the ""movie duel"" with 2LDK.  The movie was shot in about a week on half the budget it should have had.  The script was tight and the acting was superb.  The movie had tension, humor, drama and plenty of action.  The actor who portrayed Aragami was a mixture of Antonio Banderas, Johnny Depp, and little bit of Brad Pitt.  Very cool dude.  You could tell he was comfortable in the role. And the ending...WOW!

This movie will stay in my collection.  A definite must-see!!!",1128124800,22,549,4.42
2154350,5,B0002ZYE64,"I don't want to sound biased but you would be too if, without fail,  you love every movie this director makes. There is a moment, in Aragami, where the one character confesses to be the said Aragami, a  murderous and unstoppable god of battle, the scene plays out for what must have been almost a whole minute with complete silence and then the two characters bust out laughing. I was dying through the whole thing, it was truly joyful to watch a scene play out without a quick cut or shakey documentory style camera angle because in America we would have ruined. We would have ruined because some suit would be sitting in the editing room going ""You can't just have them sit there and  not talk! They have to say something!!!"" No they don't have to say anything. The Japanese are doing great things with movies and styles that have been developed here in the US, Italy, and England. More and more we're seeing movies like: VERSUS, ALIVE, AZUMI, THE RETURNER, and ARAGAMI; that explore the form of cinema with the freedom of style that they are allowed. Aragami is not perfect but that is part of it's appeal. It's very short(1hour 16min) but it feels like a much longer movie (not a boring movie just longer, El Mariachi feels long too and it's fantastic) than it is. Most Japanese movies ARE hit and miss with me, I don't love them all mind you, but it's getting to a point where I feel like director Kitamura can do no wrong. Every movie he makes is exciting, cool, and yet intelligent in that he explores new directions everytime.

Not a Fanboy, just fair.",1115596800,14,1560,4.501766784452297
2154351,5,B0002ZYE64,"This is a great film directed by Kitamura, the same one who directed Versus, Alive, and Azumi.  Although I haven't yet seen Alive and Azumi, Versus was highly entertaining, showcasing Kitamura's style of making everything just look cool. Aragami definitely falls in the cool category.

The history behind this movie was that there was a competition between 2 directors (Tsutsumi and Kitamura) to both direct a movie that would be shown at various film festivals.  At the end of watching both films, the fans would vote on which one they liked more, and the director that lost would have to shave his head, and act as an assistant to the winning director for his next movie.  Furthermore, the film had to be completely shot in 7 days, have no more than 3 actors in it, take place in one room only, and have at least one of the actors die.

This film, in my opinion far surpassed its competitor (2ldk) in all ways.  The film is short, clocking in at 80 minutes including credits, but is perfect.  It involves 2 samurais who are in a temple.  The story centers on the tension that mounts as the samurais get into more and more discussion throughout the night, culminating in an awesome sword fight.  It's that simple, and yet the movie totally rocks.",1112832000,5,1247,4.606334841628959
2154352,4,B0002ZYE64,"What a cool movie. The movie centers around the duel-to-death between two skilful samurai with a little twist that one of them is an immortal demon god.

2154353,1,B0002ZYE64,Nothing but dialogs (and the talks weren't all that interesting).  Only so so action at the last 10 minutes of the film.

8035512,4,B0002ZYE64,"In 2002, director Ryuhei Kitamura was challenged to to do something very usual -- make a full-length movie made with one week's shooting time. One setting. Two actors. A fight.

The result... is kind of like a rock'n'roll samurai version of ""My Dinner With Andre,"" where two men contemplate the meaning of life and death, and the value of either when a person is immortal. But with more booze, swords, guns, severed limbs and the occasional upgrade to godhood. ""Aragami: The Raging God of Battle"" is a weird, wild movie with a slow-burning fuse... right before it explodes into sparking, sword-swinging action.

A wounded samurai (Takao Ohsawa) drags his dying friend (Hideo Sakaki) into a shrine during a thunderstorm. When he wakes up, he finds that his wounds have healed, his friend is dead and cremated, and he's the guest of a very peculiar man (Masaya Kat) and a silent woman (Kanae Uotani). Since it's not yet safe to go outside, the samurai reluctantly agrees to stay and drink with his host, who has a collection of alcohol and weapons from all across the world.

But he soon discovers that something very weird is up with this man. The man claims to be a war god -- an ""aragami"" -- who and he has done something horrifying to turn the samurai into a nearly-invincible immortal.

What is the aragami's reason for doing all of this? He's tired of living an immortal life... and cue Queen's ""Who Wants To Live Forever?"" But as a war-god, he can't die except by being defeated by someone in one-on-one combat. He's also one of Japan's most famous historical figures, who was famous for... being incredibly good at fighting and killing people. Despite that, the samurai finds himself forced into the ultimate sword battle that will decide both their destinies.

""Aragami: The Raging God of Battle"" is a very odd movie. At least eighty percent of it is just two guys sitting in a single small room, drinking and talking. And at first, it's not particularly scary -- the silence and sudden appearances of the Aragami and the Woman are offputting, but not necessarily unnatural. But he drops subtle hints at the unnatural qualities of these people, through careful lighting (which often makes the Aragami look strangely undead) and peculiar evasions.

After the Aragami reveals his nature, Kitamura slowly unravels the conversation into a discussion about life, death, suicide, immortality and divinity. He occasionally livens things up with some humor (the Samurai throws back a whole glass of vodka... and regrets it) and action (severed limbs, impalement), but it's fundamentally a very philosophical film. The battle and the conflict are not ones of hatred and hostility, but of some deep primal inclination to fight.

For instance, one of the most intriguing scenes is when the Aragami offers the Samurai his choice of various weapons, including a broadsword, a very modern pistol, Wolverine claws and throwing stars. In another movie, this would be a tense scene, but it's oddly relaxed as the two men prepare to kill each other, and the Aragami pleasantly offers his opinions about the virtues of different weapons.

And despite the medieval setting, the director also gives the whole experience a strangely rock'n'roll, modern flavor -- especially since the Aragami somehow has access to vodka, French wine and a bunch of weapons from different times and places. The rock soundtrack doesn't hurt either.

This is a movie that relies heavily on its actors, and both of them are absolutely perfect. Kat plays his character with almost inhuman coolness and casualness -- he seems like a very cool, interesting guy who would be fun to hang out with... except he's also a war-god who seems to be missing some compassion chips. He even seems to change physically through the movie, looking more solid and grand at the climax, with a mane of red-tinged hair.

Ohsawa balances him out nicely -- he IS just an ordinary guy at the start, and he reacts to the various shocking revelations in exactly the way you'd expect. Fear, horror, puking, hysterical laughter, and even a bit of grinning crazy. But his character transforms into something colder and deadlier as the movie wears on, as if he were being refined down to his purest form of self. Ohsawa handles the transition beautifully.

With only two speaking actors and a single room to play out their battle, ""Aragami: The Raging God of Battle"" could have been a really boring movie. Instead, it's a fascinating little movie about battling with words and swords.",1426464000,,4518,4.908256880733945
8035513,5,B0002ZYE64,"This was an excellent movie, came on time had no problem. If you are in the marital art a good movie on Iai Heido",1400457600,,113,3.75
8035514,4,B0002ZYE64,"One evening, two wounded samourai knock at the door of an isolated temple, asking for refuge and help. The master of the temple (played by Masaya Kato), a strangly handsome man, welcomes them and offers them hospitality. Little do they know, that this is the last place on earth where they should ask for help...

This movie is part of a project which began with a challenge - two Japanese directors made a competition, who could do a better movie about a duel. Strict rules were set, one of which was, that the entire action should take place in just one room... And this gives a very unique movie, in which the duelists will talk, walk, drink and fight the whole night, without ever leaving the main temple room.

Aragami is the real name of the master of the temple. He is in fact a demon - an extremely handsome, cultivated, charming and well spoken demon, who is aristocratic to the core, even including the necessary touch of decadence, very much like a certain count Zaroff. Aragami is a also a really heavy drinker and has a unique way of explaining the subtile secrets of correctly cooking and serving human liver... After killing (and eating) 794 warriors in his long, well filled life, he is now tired and desires only one thing - to rest. Forever. But there is one problem - he can only be killed in battle. And until now he has never met his equal....

I really enjoyed this little, smart movie, which was clearly influenced by mangas and by chambara movies and also possibly a little by ""The most dangerous game"", the old classic from 1932. The only reason why I can not give it five stars is the ending, which is poor and has the mark of a typical ""deus ex machina"" move, used frequently when the director has no idea how to come out of a tight corner... But it is still a very, very entertaining moment of cinema.",1340150400,,1829,4.453731343283582
8035515,5,B0002ZYE64,"This is talent.  In what should be an insanely restricted format, the director and actors in this movie create a brilliant performance.  Two men, near to death from their wounds, arrive at an obscure shrine in the mountains.  Their hosts are an older warrior and a mysterious woman.  The older warrior is a hospitable demon looking for someone who can match his skill in combat.  The woman is enigmatic, with only a few references to her role in this drama, and only a single moment of animated expression.

The set is the main hall of the shrine.  Visually busy, but well executed and providing both visual and conceptual depth to the movie.

There are excellent fight scenes, and they are critical to the plot, not gratuitous.  Conceivably, they could be your main reason for watching this film, but you'd have to be a complete rock to not get drawn into the story.

The central character, Aragami, is played wonderfully.  He is decadent, energetic, hospitable, foppish, humorous, and violent by turns and is the type of character that would make someone welcome a duel to the death after dinner.

Driven by the players, this movie shows what can be done with human ability rather than extravagant sets and effects.

8035516,4,B0002ZYE64,"Aragami is what I wish all ""art"" films or ""experimental"" films could be like. And the world would be a better place for it.

Okay, for the three people in the world who have found this film but haven't actually heard the backstory, here's the short version: 2 Japanese directors place a bet with one another about who can make a better film in 7 days, 1 location, 3 actors, and 1 has to die. ""Aragami"" is one-half of that bet (the other being ""2LDK""--IMO, ""Aragami"" wins).

It's important to have a little context when seeing this as it'll make you appreciate it all that much more. Now that we've dealt with the peripheral nonsense, let's get into the good stuff.

""Aragami"" is a movie that gets better and better as it goes along. You really have to watch the whole thing to appreciate it (and please ignore the [other reviewer] on this page who referenced the running time at over 2 hours--the film clocks in at 80 minutes--the last 30 being mostly action--unless he has some super, uncut, ""only guy in the known universe to have it"" version that we missed out on). This film will deliver, but it takes some patience.

After 50 minutes I started thinking, ""Okay, the premise is cool and I like what they're doing here. But this is a Ryuhei Kitamura film, when do I get to start witnessing some broken sternums and whatnot?"" The answer, at just about the 50-minute mark. Once it gets going it doesn't look back. You get the trademark Kitamura style. At that point, the film starts hovering around the 4-star level. By the time you see the final scene you'll be grinning ear-to-ear and realizing just how awesome this movie really is. The payoff is well worth it (especially for Kitamura fans, ever more so for ""Versus"" fans).

I've done you a favor. Knowing when the action kicks in, now you can sit back and enjoy the story unfolding knowing exactly what you're getting (and when). As for the story, read the summary. The acting is very tight. The story is cool. The action is very, very well done. And it all plays out well given the constraints of the bet.

This movie should play well for those Kitamura fans, fans of ""cult"" style action flicks, those with some artistic sensibilities looking for something a little different. Although I wouldn't recommend this as an entrance into the Kitamura world. Check out ""Ultimate Versus"" first. If you dig it, then go out and pick this up. And, it gets better with subsequent viewings, too. Enjoy.",1221350400,2,2445,4.5963302752293576

I can tell you without any doubt in my mind that this is one of the greatest films I have ever seen, domestic or foreign.

After seeing the movie 3 times now, I just found out it was only 80 minutes long.  I am so sucked into the world inside Aragami's temple that time seems to stop.
