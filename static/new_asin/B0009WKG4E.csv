8068503,4,B0009WKG4E,"Vol. 1 is a bit slow. It's about a young man in college who falls for his professor and she with him. He lives in a poor neighborhood
but, he works hard to help support his friends and family.  She is from money. The relationship with his professor is slow and the only great thing
in this first volume is Bae Yong Joons' acting. It's a little dated, but that's ok. I would not put this in the same league as his ""Winter
Sonata"" where he shines a very bright light, but, this vol 1 is elevated in Vol. 2 which is better.  Great actors....just a weak story line.",1428796800,,561,4.137614678899083
