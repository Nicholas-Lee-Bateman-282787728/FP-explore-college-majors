767331,4,6304042574,"Branded a Coward, 1935 film

The story begins with a wagon drawn by two horses (was it a covered stagecoach?). The family stops to make camp, the two boys quarrel. They are attacked by a gang of riders, and the family is shot except for youngest son! Twenty years pass. A man rides a bucking bronco, the shoots his pistol at glass bottles. But Johnny is a Show Cowboy, he doesn't ride the range and gets ""buck fever"" when there is any real shooting. Scotch and soda? [Sounds like product placement.] Three men hold up the saloon. The bartender and one of the robbers exchange shots. The remaining two leave quickly. Johnny has a flashback, then answers a critic. He is gun shy and decides to move on. Oscar rides along. They see a stagecoach being robbed, many shots are fired. Johnny and Oscar attack the robbers, then save the stagecoach from the robbers. Johnny Hume impressed the driver.

""Is that on the level?"" Johnny Hume is thanked, but the notches on his pistol attract notice. The townsmen elect Johnny the town marshal of Lawless. A thrown knife delivers a warning message. Johnny takes the job. ""Nobody knows the identity of the ""Cat"". We learn how the ""Cat"" gets his information. Drinking loosens Carson's tongue. ""I'll show him."" Johnny figures out the shot that hit Carson was aimed at him. The Express Office was robbed, the townsmen pursue the robbers. Johnny isn't fooled. Oscar followed a man into a trap. Johnny goes to meet the ""Cat"", and sneaks into that cabin. There is a fight. We learn the identity of the ""Cat"" for a shocking surprise! Justice is done. There seems to be a happy ending for Johnny.

This is an interesting story about freeing a town from an outlaw gang. [Relevant to the 1930s or even today?] It tells how a Hollywood Cowboy can be an actor. [Tim McCoy was a real cowboy who had other talents.] Johnny Mack Brown was a football star at the University of Alabama in the 1920s who became a Hollywood actor in the 1930s. I don't know what he did after Westerns died out in the early 1940s, but he could have been in some TV shows in the 1950s (like other actors).",1292371200,,2102,4.526315789473684
