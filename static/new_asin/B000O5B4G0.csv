8182909,5,B000O5B4G0,"this was really fun to watch these old shows again. I used to watch them when I was very young,just good clean shows ,something that is dearly missed today with all the garbage they put on TV.",1387152000,3,192,4.216216216216216
8182910,5,B000O5B4G0,"I bought this DVD because this was one of the first shows I remember watching when we got our first television in 1953. I have viewed only a few episodes so far but I find I do enjoy watching them. I am a little surprised because I was not sure they ""would hold up"" after all these years, but they do for me. Ironically, I also loved I Love Lucy when the shows were first broadcast but now find I cannot stand to watch the endless reruns. I Love Lucy is just not funny to me anymore.
I Married Joan also has appealing likable stars. In reading a little about Joan Davis' life after this show ended I was very saddened by the tragedies that befell her and her family including her daughter Beverly who also starred in I Married Joan.
Considering how old this show is, the quality of the DVD is very good.",1369180800,5,803,4.187096774193549
8182911,5,B000O5B4G0,Great to see the old shows that I grew up with. I gave then also to a friend and they loved it also.,1356912000,,100,3.391304347826087
8182912,5,B000O5B4G0,"What a fun look at what I watched when I was a kid.  Joan is the first ""Lucy"" as far as I'm concerned.  My hubby and I have giggled our way through the series, and highly recommend it for a lift of your spirits.",1334102400,2,211,3.772727272727273
8182913,5,B000O5B4G0,I really enjoy classic tv shows. My only request is that Amazon make more episodes available for purchase because I am searching for a specfic episode. The DVD was great!,1306972800,,170,4.7
8182914,1,B000O5B4G0,"Have purchased I MARRIED JOAN Volumes 1, 2, 3 and now 4.  Volumes 3 and 4 are ""re-runs"" of shows already on Volume 2.  When hyping the new Volumes 3 and 4, the marketing didn't list the titles of the show.  It is not the $5.99 that gets me -- it is the fact that the producers of these DVDs are not being honest with the consumer who truly wants alll the episodes of I MARRIED JOAN and expects NEW EPISODES on NEW NUMBERED VOLUMES -- not include all the same episodes already in previous DVDs.  I have been looking for an episode I saw about Joan Davis learning to play golf.  It still sticks in my mind as one of the funniest minutes of hysterical laughter and would love to own it.  Have been buying these I MARRIED JOAN Volumes hoping it would show up - thanks to the company for not releasing the names of the titles on each Volume, I am just re-purchasing the same shows over and over.",1180137600,76,890,4.145348837209302
