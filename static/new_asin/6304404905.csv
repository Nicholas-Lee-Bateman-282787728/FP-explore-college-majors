876711,5,6304404905,"Sailor Moon R is my favorite season

In the first 13 episode of the season, during the Doom Tree part of the season, I enjoyed the story most of all. I found the relationship, the love square, going on between Serena, Darian, Alan, and Anne to be amazing. I had never seen anything like it before in my life, mostly because I was young when it started. It was probably what made me think Love Triangles and Love Squares where a great idea for writing in my own future.

The second half of the season was great but it had several episodes that I found unappealing because the story line of those episodes was lame. Still, over all, the whole season was amazing, the entire story lines, both of them, for start to end were great. The Crystal Tokyo part of the story was amazing to.

I would suggest that everyone watch this season.",1372550400,,829,4.37012987012987

the cosmetics caper: this episode made me cry a littel just becuase its so sad to see serena (usagi) cry

sailor mercury moving on?: i really loved the song that was written for this episode

gramps in a pickle: this was a really funny episode and rayes grandpa really is a cute character

trouble comes thundering in: was a fun episode, this is where we learn about serena's (usagi's) bigest fear thunder, and lightning i wonder why she was never scared of jupiters attack???

a charmed life: i wish the charme shope that appeares in this episode was real i would be there everyday ^_^

a curried favor: rini (chibiusa) was a bit mean in this episode, i mean someone wants to do a favor for you but you're going to be all picky about it ... but this episode was kinda funny, who new serena (usagi) could cook curry that tast good even though it looks cinda like crap lol",1181174400,,1180,4.199115044247788
876859,5,6304404905,"Sailor Moon is a really good anime series, no matter what language you see it in.
You'll probably notice that a lot of people have griped about how horrible it is when it's been dubbed into English, but they're just angry because it's rather different than the Japanese version (of COURSE it's different; certain things wouldn't translate well into other cultures).  I, personally, like both versions of it.  I like the Japanese version because it's interesting to see anime in its original state, and I like the English version because not only is it also really good (the writing and voice acting is really clever much of the time), but it's also easier for me to relate to.

On this DVD set, the Sailor Scouts are forced to repeatedly face off with the Amazon Quartet (Vesves, Junjun, Cerecere and Pallapalla) who are searching for Pegasus at the request (or rather the demand) of Zirconia, the short-tempered subordinate of Queen Nehelenia, who is trapped in a mirror and wants Pegasus's Golden Crystal so she can (1) escape from the mirror and (2) take over the universe (predictably).
Fortunately, Serena and Rini, with the help of the other Sailor Scouts and Tuxedo Mask, manage to vanquish them whenever they meet.

Of the six episodes on this DVD, my personal favorites are the one where Pallapalla opens a dentist office, and the one where Rini's schoolfriend Hiroki attempts to make some kind of homemade plane.

In conclusion, this DVD is really good, but I wouldn't necessarily recommend it for younger children because it is ""uncut"".  In other words, they left in everything parents might find objectionable.  I, personally, didn't see anything too objectionable, but someone else might.",1130371200,,1701,4.96830985915493
876860,2,6304404905,"Ok, I'm 15 years old, I originally watcheed sailor moon when I was 8 years old when I lived in Germany, where they broadcast it on RTL2, and it was uncut as I remeber. Sadly we moved back to England, with me still thoroughly hooked on sailor moon. My grandparents then bought me two of the Sailor moon videos to feed my addiction, it was this one and the video entitled Jupiter and venus arrive.

My original reaction was , Yay! finally I can watch some sailor moon again, and even better, it's in english. Imagine my horror at having to sit through the ""sanitised"" American version. I can only assume that this was aimed at children under the age of 36 months as practically half the scenes in the episode where sailor moon is stumbling through the arctic were deemed too ""violent"" for children. Please, I'm a girl and was 7 years old when I watched it and I didn't see anything inappropriate.

In my opinion removing these scenes completely alienated any teen audience as it just seems all too unrealistic, and if you've seen the original, makes you feel like the people editing this are looking down their noses at you and still treating you as kids.

And don't even get me started on ""Sailor says"", christ, talk about patronising!

Some of the voice casting is also completely off, Luna sounds like a nagging grandma! In the German and Japanese version she sounds much younger, and much less irritating.

Some of the translation isn't quite accurate either. You have to remeber, this show was aimed at young or pre-teens, and the characters here are 14 years old. Do the 14-year-olds you know really talk like this all the time? It's lost some of the charm that made it so appealing in the first place, although most of it is accurate and even funny in places.

The artwork is beautifully restored, although the cut out scenes does make you feel like you've been cheated a little.

Basically, the overall storyline is the same, and if this is the first time you watch sailor moon and you're under the age of 11, it is fairly watchable

any teens sent this who are fueled with sailormoon nostalgia, my advice is don't watch it, give it to a younger sibling, return it, or better still burn it.

Seriously, the original uncut version is much better, even if it is in Japanese, it makes more sense and is way better.

Other series I recommend are Sailor moon S - which introduces new scouts and is often voted the best of the five series, and Sailor Moon Stars - which isn't actually available in english because they'd have to edit out too much, but is also very good. Sailor moon stars is also legally available for download over the internet so I have heard as it was never copyrighted (or it may have been copyrighted 10 years ago but is no longer) but you'd need a lot of patience and a pretty fast connection to get it that way

The Manga is also extremely good if you don't feel like forking out too much cash for the dvds",1109721600,2,2930,4.468164794007491

When the school bus is attacked, Mina and Serena leap into action, ready to defeat the new Cardian and prove to the children that the exist. Sailor Venus makes the scene with a brand new power that shines.

With the mother in the hospital, recovering her strength, Darien offers to take care of the baby in the mean time. Serena aids him and the two seem to be a plunder when it comes to babies.

It's my favorite one out of all the Sailor Moon series, and I would recommend it to anyone who likes Sailor Moon. Hope this was helpful, if not then I'm sorry.",1046995200,5,470,4.3522727272727275

I love the end of each seaso nbecause the bad guys die and its cool but in the japan version you se all the first 5 scouts die its kind of sad and not for young children but good forkids older then 11.
also recomended all sailor stars episodes avalible at Mina Arnold Fansubs holdbacks are sailor moon is nude the scouts die the new scouts sailor starlights are boys but when they transform there sex changes and they becaome girls and they use a swear alot. This series should be watched once you are 13 but it is the best season of Sailor Moon the hit tv show.",1045958400,,797,4.25

I know RINI could be a little pest but she is the cutest thing and if she was my sister I would love her and care about her,1044921600,,411,3.9518072289156625
877098,5,6304404905,"this is definitely one of the best volumes!
Emerald Bakes Up Trouble: serena's wondering why darien has broken up w/ her & after being depressed about that rini is spending a lot of time w/ him she meets up w/ the other scouts and there is a new bakery shop that's having all food FREE! well emerald takes this chance to attack & turns all but 1 scout into pasteries. the other scout saves the day...won't tel thought! (not sailor moon)
Promises Fulfilled: serena signs up to make a love bracelet to try & save her & darien's relationship. emerald has enchanted the love bracelets w/ dark energy & all who have one on get their energy sucked out of them. rini is wearing serena's when it happens but serena saves her. serena also figures out the reason behind why darien broke up w/ her. in the end they get back together! (very heart-wrenching...i cried!)
No Thanks, Nurse Venus: if u love sailor venus(like me...she's my fav.!) this one's totally for you! everyone has caught the flu except for mina & rini. mina goes to all the scout's houses to help but makes a HUGE mess of everything! she destroys lita's room, blows up raye's stereo, & u don't even wanna c serena's house! rini & mina go to the hospital to pick up medicine for everyone. there the enemy tries to infect rini but she screams & a golden crescent moon shines on her forehead. mina comes to save her but gets pinned to the wall w/ huge siringes. the scouts come to the rescue at the end though. then mina gets sick & the scouts get their little revenge on her. (this one's HILARIOUS!)
Dog Day For Artemis: luna's been ragging & teasing artemis lately & artemis is really getting ticked off. when he finds an animal shelter & investigates he finds all the animals are being controlled by emerald's henchmen. to prove he's not 'klutzo the cat' as luna refers to him, he goes to save the day by himself. the scouts arrive on the scene & help him out. luna starts crying & says he's proved that he's heroic & they make up.

The Amazon Quartet are some of the most interesting villians in the Sailor Moon series since they embody innocence and cruelty often at the same time.  Each episode is about someone with her dream symbolized by a dream mirror.  It is interesting that when the character has her dream mirror knocked out of her, the character becomes lifeless.  I suppose that is what happens when someone's dream is lost, the person is still alive but yet lifeless since all passions are knocked out of her.

I myself am 13 and still watching Saturday morning cartoons. (Kind of sad, I know it). But still, this is a great series. Especially because in these few episodes, Zirconia becomes more and more angry with every failure that the ... Trio have. This is a superb DVD.

Tuxedo Unmasked
In the first episode of this movie, Tuxedo Unmasked, Darien has been turned evil by Queen Beryl and is now Evil Prince Darien! He tries to recapture all the rainbow crystal carriers in his Dark Crystal. Then Amy's secorite crush, Greg, shows up and warns her about the upcoming danger. Evil Prince Darien then goes after him and Sailor Mercury had to try to protect him!
Fractious Friends
In Fractious Friends, the Sailor Scouts try to trick the Negaverse into thinking that they are going to split up. (Not too fun on Serena's part.) In doing so, they hope to find a way into the Negaverse. It almost works, but then Sailor Mars looses her temper and.. well, that would be telling.
The Past Returns
The Sailor Scouts finnaly find a portal to the Negaverse and have to travel through many different tunnels to try and find the real path. Luna and Artimes go one way and end up in a blizzard. The Sailor Scouts go another and eventually end up against Malachite. Then, the Crecent Moon Wand glows and the scouts are transported to the moon where Queen Serenity's spirit comes and tells them about their past.
Day of Destiny
The Sailor Scouts are killed off one by one and then Sailor Moon is left alone! She is then transported to Queen Beryl's relm where she restores Evil Prince Darien's memorys. Then, she has to face off with Queen Beryl. (kool song by the way)
So! Hope you but this movie and enjoy it.

877174,5,6304404905,"This movie is extremely thought-provoking. As A huge SuperS fan, I thoroughly enjoyed this video. We start out at the Dead Moon Circus, where ""Dragon Ball Z"" rejects hang out. Zirconia, the evil ruler of the malicious circus, beckons to the squadron of Animal Eyes,(The Amazon Trio) Fish Eye, Tiger's Eye, and Hawk's Eye. In the first ep, the Amazon Trio hatches a multidimensional plan to capture Pegasus, using Molly Baker (if you've seen the first season, you're familiar with her and Melvin Umino) as bait. Of course, those peanut-brains fail, and Sailor Moon and Mini Moon save the day. In the second ep, Sayuri, a friend of Darien's from school takes a romantic interest in him. Little Rini realizes that if Serena/Sailor Moon and Darien don't get married, she wouldn't exist. Happily, Sailor Moon saves the day after Sayuri's dream has been sought out by French-wannabe Tiger's Eye. Sailor Moon bravely saves Darien, risking her own life for his, and Sayuri knows that she can't compete with Sailor Moon. In the third episode, (which is humorous) Luna, Mina(ko), and Serena are angry at Artemis for his supposed infidelity. Luna is cheesed off that Artemis has ogled a female human nun, which is a misunderstanding. Insult is added to injury when a kitten with a crescent moon encrusted on her forehead calls Artemis ""daddy"". You'll have to see the ending for yourself, 'cause I'm not giving it away!

We would have been left with the two episodes, and a much more emotional and dramatic ending to the series. Even DiC is pretty good at maintaining the emotion during the intense scenes, but they were either lazy, or not thinking straight.
While they did do a good editing job (which is something I NEVER want to say), they really disappointed many Sailor Moon fans.

If  you're looking for a video that tells you something, try A Moon Star is  Born or maybe Scouts Unite.",945561600,3,320,4.5964912280701755
877408,2,6304404905,Why they chose these two episodes to put on a video I cannot understand. Cruise Blues and Shutterbugged are just filler episodes that were created to fill the ammount of episodes needed for the first season. The other  videos available are better and more plot heavy than this one. I'm not even  going to mention why it is stupid for the Wiseman/Death Phantom to be on  the cover... He didn't even appear til the 17 newly dubbed episodes of  Sailor Moon R...,945043200,2,458,4.548780487804878
877439,5,6304404905,I think this on was pretty good. It's about how some scouts were found. I think both episodes were pretty good and like most of the episodes it has some irrisistable charm about it.

It will  change you mind with out a dout. I always cry at the end of it because it's  just ssssoooo sad!  So I'm saying this is a Must for Moonies.",943660800,3,428,3.8620689655172415

Serena is a crybaby and whiner but she comes to be a good superhero in the  end. Ther are lots of new chatacters from the Negaverse, like Titus and  Soicite. This is a great video. I like the one where Serena falls in love  with the captain (who really is Jeteye} on the cruise. In a romantic  ballroom and the pool area, Serena saves the day. I loved it.

Very interesting....  I think that they  should have left these two episodes the way that they were suppose to be.  Worth your money, I think.",941068800,6,401,4.253333333333333

7871183,3,6304404905,"Out of the few vhs videos that were released in the bubblegum pink format, this was arguably the best of them because DIC toned down the ridiculous censorship and annoying flying moons (virutally treating 12 year olds like they were zombified 2 year olds that need to wear their big kid diapers). While the dub remains atrocious in my personal opinion at least they didn't hack these two episodes to pieces and are tolerable to watch.

Might be worth as a collectors item but if you are new to the classic Sailor Moon you will do much better getting the new uncut dvd dub that was released in 2015 and start there.",1482019200,,614,4.482142857142857
7871184,1,6304404905,"The actual VHS's image and sound quality is the only redeeming quality. I kind of like the artwork of the box but the actual episodes are atrocious. I can understand english speakers grew up with the horrid DIC hacked dub but while the ridiculous flying moons in the screen and corny pep lecture of the Sailor Says were still tolerable, I cannot forgive DIC for literally destroying the last 2 episodes of the first season.

The original Japanese version along with the mexican spanish dub that I grew up watching was divided into two episodes. In the penultimate episode, Serena watches her 4 friends die in a horrible way. Sailor Mars's death is especially touching. I cried the first time I saw that scene as a kid. In the second episode Serena overcomes the loneliness, becomes Princess Serenity and fights against Beryl.

By poorly hacking up the scenes where the 4 scouts die you totally miss out on the character build up, and not to mention the scenes of them dying are horribly cut up. While people praised the song Carry On, when I got the original cd and confirmed the song is ""okay"", the original song in Japanese is far better.

I'd only get this as a curious collectors item or possibly for self-inflicted torture.",1482019200,,1228,4.675925925925926
