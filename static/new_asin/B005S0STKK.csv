4862127,5,B005S0STKK,The video is very informative and a good stretch/work-out.  It's a good video for a newcomer to pilates.  Three thirty minute long videos..make for quick and good work-outs.,1347235200,,173,5.142857142857143
4862128,5,B005S0STKK,"This is an easy to follow workout by Mari.
She has options in case you are a beginner and cannot get into certain positions.
It is very effective and my doctor is the person who recommended this DVD.
I am sure you will see results within two weeks,I did.
I also purchased another of Mari's DVD's,Flat Abs Workout.
Since purchasing these two workouts I have told my friends and they also love Mari's style in how she approaches her great routines!",1347148800,,446,4.518518518518518
4862129,5,B005S0STKK,"This is a great video, especially for someone starting out in Pilates. You really learn great positions to tone your lower body.",1346371200,3,128,4.863636363636363
4862130,5,B005S0STKK,"Can't wait to try out this DVD.  Heard great things about it, been doing pilates for over 2 years, want to see if it's challenging",1345161600,,130,4.2
4862131,5,B005S0STKK,"Nothing needed for this dvd just you and the mat. Mari Winsor moves fast so if you're a beginner it might be tough (like me when I started). I really feel the work out when I'm done, she makes you work!",1344384000,4,202,3.951219512195122
4862132,4,B005S0STKK,Great addition to my pilates workouts. Like that you can do one section or all three. Some exercises are familiar and some are new so these are not just a repeat of previous workouts.,1335830400,18,183,4.411764705882353
4862133,5,B005S0STKK,"I was looking for a workout video with 20 min. sessions. This has 3 different 20 minute workouts, which are great. I spread them out over a week. The first few times, I was a bit distracted by the music that plays in the background, but I'm able to tune it out now. Some of the moves are a bit advanced. I would say a person completely new to pilates would be quite challenged. You must have some form and control of your body to do the moves correctly. Mari does explain the positions pretty well, though. Your body definitely responds to the moves and I feel I am actually getting a great workout in a short amount of time.",1334102400,36,625,4.216666666666667
4862134,5,B005S0STKK,"This DVD is a butt kicker that delivers results.  I have yet to be able to do any of these workouts two days in a row, I always need more time to rebuild muscle strength which is awesome.  I really see the results.",1333756800,26,214,3.953488372093023
4862135,5,B005S0STKK,"Love this.  After three knee surgeries, i need to find something other than a bunch of lunges and squats.  This video works thighs, hips and buttocks.  Mari explains everything in detail.  Just enough reps to be miserable, but not discourage you.  No fancy stuff, just basic mat pilates.  I highly recommend this.",1448755200,5,313,4.923076923076923
4862136,5,B005S0STKK,"This is a very nice pilates DVD! Pilates is great for anyone who needs a low impact workout. I have a knee issue myself and can do almost every single exercise on this dvd with no problem. It comes with 3 separate videos, each focusing on different body parts (basically hips, thighs, and butt), and each is about 20 minutes. I can't lie, a lot of the time I do have to fast forward through some of her talking, which makes the overall workout a bit shorter (I hate to waste time.) But that is not so bad. I really like this. You will definitely feel your hips/thighs the next day! A great portable workout too that you can travel with (you need absolutely no equipment.) Definitely recommend!",1448668800,3,693,4.421875
4862137,5,B005S0STKK,Great like all her other DVDs,1444003200,,29,4.0

4862141,5,B005S0STKK,I usually have a hard time feeling my muscle in my inner thighs but with this workout I really felt it. Awesome,1435363200,2,111,4.090909090909091

4862145,5,B005S0STKK,This was my first Mari Windsor workout and I was pleasantly surprised.  I can feel the burn in every muscle she wants me to which in some other workouts I really have to concentrate to feel the burn.  Until this workout I never realized how effective pilates can be on the lower body.  In the past I've really only felt my core being worked during total body workouts.  If you are a beginner you will probably only make it through one or two of the workouts because as an intermediate exerciser I have all I can do to make it through all three sections which is a good thing :),1425254400,3,577,4.218181818181818
4862146,5,B005S0STKK,Very good workout.  I'm still trying to accomplish some of these moves.,1415404800,2,71,4.916666666666667
4862147,5,B005S0STKK,"I have recurrent, ongoing plantar fasciitis that is aggravated by virtually everything--walking, biking, yoga, and even some ballet technique.  I am also a former seven-year professional Pilates teacher, so I know movement, and rehabilitation.  Despite that, The only things I can do without aggravating my feet are the New York City Ballet Workout's floor barre sequences, floor barre from other sources, and Mari Winsor's Pilates DVDs.

It's now been almost ten years since I was a professional Pilates teacher; I never thought I'd be recommending a Mari Winsor Pilates DVD, but I am.  This isn't classical Pilates, but it doesn't aggravate plantar fasciitis, which is hard for an exercise video to do.  The production values are better than the original videos, and Mari has mellowed and gotten better as an instructor over the years.  This is a really good exercise dvd that uses real Pilates exercises in a dynamic stretching and strengthening format.  I can see doing this regularly. And, it doesn't hurt my feet!!!

Recommended.",1415404800,9,1035,5.192771084337349
4862148,5,B005S0STKK,"I have never seen such quick and lovely results from any other workout DVD. I've had this DVD for about two months, doing the thigh workout twice a week, and the hip and glute workout just once a week. My thighs have NEVER looked so streamlined and tight. I've always carried a little extra weight on my thighs, but this is finally help slim them down. Even my husband noticed. My pants are roomier around my hips, and my butt is shrinking. WOW, it's a must buy. I consider myself intermediate level in Pilates, and this workout is neither too hard nor too easy. Just perfect!",1410825600,10,576,4.443396226415095
4862149,5,B005S0STKK,Love my Lower Body Pilates.  I see a difference.  I've been using this workout for 6 weeks now almost every day mixing with other workouts and I can feel it works.,1407715200,3,163,4.225806451612903
4862150,5,B005S0STKK,"I've had the DVD for three weeks and performing it religiously. It's fast pace, but I've done the advanced video a lot so some of the moves are in that one. It targets the areas mentioned. I don't feel sore after it and I just had a baby 6 weeks ago.",1405296000,2,250,3.9215686274509802
4862151,2,B005S0STKK,I ordered this dvd but the cover is different than listed.  My dvd is the same as the Mari Winsor Lower Body Pilates Season 1.  I found Mari difficult to follow.  In this video she has a lady demonstrating the moves which is good but she does a poor job of leading you into the different exercises.  I am returning this product.,1404518400,2,328,4.241935483870968
4862152,5,B005S0STKK,"I hold my weight everywhere but mostly in my lower body (round thighs, big booty).  I am the type that even if I am losing weight my thighs are still squeezing into my pants.  This workout made a huge difference in a really short period of time (about a month).  My pants glide on better and my thighs are starting to not rub together as much.  I actually wore shorts to a wine festival recently and they didn't ride up in the middle.  I have been doing the waist, hips, & thighs workouts mostly cause I run so my butt is pretty good, but it is great.  It feels really good and if you have done any of the Windsor Pilates before the learning curve isn't that bad.  If Pilates is new to you or you are a little heavier, you might want to try one of the 20 min Body slimming dvd's to strengthen you core and get an idea of how the moves work so you don't hurt yourself.  Some of the moves are quit advanced and there is no modifier so you have to do it a couple of times but after that it is really great and you feel so strong and actually slim during and after you finish.  I really recommend pushing through the initial awkward feeling and stick to it cause the results I have had are really good.",1401926400,14,1198,4.0638297872340425
4862153,3,B005S0STKK,"Product arrived in great condition and on time, no complaints there, but it is not very challenging, may need to complete 2 of the segments a day to feel it",1400025600,,156,4.233333333333333
4862154,4,B005S0STKK,"I really like Pilates and get great results from all the DVD's I have used (By Mari Windsor).  However I would say you have to have experience in Pilates to use these or I think there could be an issue with injury.  The moves used here are intense and should be worked into slowly esp. if you are significantly out of shapehave a weak core, neck and shoulders.  That said I am certain if used correctly you could get wonderful results with these DVD's.",1399420800,3,452,4.357142857142857
4862155,4,B005S0STKK,"Good workout. I stick to the thigh thinner workout mostly, but all workouts are good. I would recommend to others.",1398470400,,114,4.75

4862157,5,B005S0STKK,"I have all of her workout DVD's but I wish she would come out with a super advanced one where she doesn't explain how to do every move, we know how to do them by now. I notice such a big difference in my body doing her pilates though, I run and do stairs mixed with pilates and my body is strong and in good shape from the combination.",1388448000,2,335,3.869565217391304
4862158,5,B005S0STKK,"good series, she is very precise and she explains every step very well. there are three parts which you can choose or you can follow the sequence and do all the series once",1388102400,,172,4.242424242424242
4862159,4,B005S0STKK,"As with all the Mari Winsor videos, this has a good workout on it.  My only complaint about Mari's cuing is that it is not as informative as say, Moira Merrithew's in the many STOTT PILATES DVDs, or Tracey Mallet's PILATES Super Sculpt.  I like to understand the point of what I'm doing.  But, as I said, this is a good workout and one I do often.",1388016000,2,347,4.149253731343284
4862160,5,B005S0STKK,There is nothing better than working out with Mari.  She really targets the areas that she says she will.  I always feel good after I do this one.,1384819200,,146,4.178571428571429
4862161,5,B005S0STKK,"Both Mari and the exercise model have attractive, joyous facial expressions that make it easy to do this video over and over; their enthusiasm is catching.  The exercises seem easy and low in repetition, but they really are effective.  I have had to quit a pilates class that integrates more than 50% cardio because of neck pain.  This lower body pilates tape is actually stengthening my back which is helping get rid of the neck pain.  There are no jolting or awkward moves.  When I do the tape, I feel like I'm the gorgeous model, getting a private pilates classs from the master.  I have already lost about a pant size in just one week of doing two or three of the 20 minute sessions daily.  The saddle bags that I have carried around for decades seem to be shrinking and my posture has definitely improved.",1384300800,4,810,4.506849315068493
4862162,3,B005S0STKK,"I bought this because I wanted some short workout options that would get my heart rate up more than yoga, and I was tired of my Ana Caban intro and intermediate DVDs. I enjoy a bunch of new poses to master, and having three different workouts allows me to get more variety. I feel challenged but not strained, but the instruction is rather poor. Mari doesn't provide enough information on how to do each exercise correctly, and she rushes through what instruction she does give. This will get better with time, but it doesn't make me want to buy more of her workouts.",1383091200,2,567,4.514563106796117

They really started to slim and sculpt in about a week id lost 2""on my hips and each thigh even my calves lost about half inch.  I love  this video. It's the change in workout I was looking for. *I would  do at least one workout on the video every day some times two outta the three.

4862166,3,B005S0STKK,Not challenging enough and not enough overall. Moves and advice are great but delivery of overall workout and workout itself is really subpar. Surprised when Windsor Pilates has been heard about over and over again. Workout needed better direction. I do not want to have to go through 10+ DVDs to find ONE workout and that's how it feels after completing the entire DVD. Back to Brazil Butt Lift and live classes!,1374192000,,413,4.75
4862167,5,B005S0STKK,"This is a great exercise video. There are 3 different 20 minute videos for hips, thighs and gluteus. They are relaxing but have small exercise that can get intense.

4862169,5,B005S0STKK,This DVD has everything I was wanting. The moves are challenging but not impossible for a beginner like myself. The instructor is motivating but not annoying. I would recommend this DVD.,1370995200,,186,5.032258064516129
4862170,5,B005S0STKK,"Mari is very fun and nice and I love this workout for so many reasons. It is calming, relaxing, rejuvantive and gives you a wonderful workout. I definately reccommend this video. Mari, you're a saint.",1369699200,2,200,4.742857142857143

4862180,5,B005S0STKK,Mari Winsor is always a butt kicker with her pilates routines.  This is no different.  20 minutes and my thighs and hips were burning!,1364515200,,134,4.541666666666667
4862181,4,B005S0STKK,"This is a good beginner to low/intermediate set of 3 workouts.  I have a very bad knee (4 surgeries to date and 1 pending)as well as a very bad back with 3 herniated and dessicated discs and I can still do all of the exercises unless I am having a ""bad knee day"" after wrenching it, etc. Making sure to keep my abs engaged made the workouts doable, even with my knee and back issues.  Slowly working up the intensity as I got stronger has definitely helped to strengthen my back and core.  I have also done her new core videos, which helped too.  They are actually a ""go-to"" when my back is sore, to help loosen things up and make my back feel better.  I definitely recommend the Giam ab workout by Mari Winsor that appears to be made around the same time as this DVD.

This set of workouts really helped me to get back into the swing of things after having to take a 4-5 month exercise hiatus due to severe asthma and a horrible CO fire season.  (Thanks to a new immunologist and the fires ending, I was able to start workout out about 4 months ago).

Now after doing these routines (I was alternating them daily and adding one of her newer ab workouts. Eventually I worked up to 2 of the 3 per day and one ab workout per day.) My hip flexors, legs and core got up to par to try something even more challenging. It feels great to be on track to getting back into great shape!  Now I have built up enough strength to move up to more challenging workouts and use these on days that I need a break. Now I do this on days where I want a workout, but am not up to a big challenge due to asthma or if my knee is feeling a bit off.

The inner thigh exercises were a bit lacking...meaning there should have been more, or maybe more challenging.  With ankle weights, adding a band or other resistance, they would probably be great, but due to knee problems I have avoided that.  After only about a week, they were easy but still good for getting back into exercising and working up to a level that prepared me for more challenging work.

Mari has come a long way since her Daisy Fuentes days over a decade (maybe two?) ago.  Her instruction is much more upbeat, focused and pleasing.  Her old DVD's were good, but drawn out and her demeanor was not as pleasant and upbeat.  She has come a long way as an instructor with a much better style, cues and pleasant demeanor.",1364428800,8,2360,4.211111111111111

I take Pilates classes in a studio in my area and these mat Pilates workouts are a great way to supplement anyone's regular workout routine.

It's relaxing but trust me - you are working!  There were muscles in my thighs I didn't know existed until after I did this workout.  It's broken down into 3 -20 minute routines so you can easily slip them in after a cardio burn.

I saw this DVD and read the reviews on it and it had some of the same exercises that female celebrities do at the gym with personal trainers! Mari Winsor is a well know fitness lady and I thought that obviously she would be good. I noticed results in a week by doing one of the three workouts(hips, thighs, or glutes)every day, but one thing is that if you don't consitently do the workouts you lose your muscle :( So I highly suggest that if you want to have results and keep them...KEEP DOING THE WORKOUTS. But if you want a easy, fast, and simple workout I HIGHLY suggest...Mari Winsor's Lower Body Pilates! You won't regret it!!",1351296000,4,814,4.191082802547771
4862193,4,B005S0STKK,"This video had me sweating and using muscles I did not know I have!!  I am not a pilates expert at all, but I felt like I could keep up with a lot of the moves and overtime I can work on perfecting some of the moves that are currently challenging.  Definitely a video I plan to use again and again and you can either do the entire video, or choose from 3 different 20 min work outs, love that option if I am crunched for time but want to burn some calories!",1350259200,4,457,3.903225806451613
4862194,5,B005S0STKK,"I ordered this DVD to replace a pilates class I used to take at my gym that got cancelled.  The class at my gym was the only class I found that toned and leaned out my thighs.  Since the class got cancelled, I've struggled to find something to replace it (my thighs got thick again).  This DVD was my solution!  I love that there's 3 separate 20 minute workouts for hips, thighs, and glutes.  I can do all 3 at one time or 1 or 2 if I'm pressed for time.  The best part is, it really works!  It has me sweating!  I'm sore in all the right places the next day!  I'm confident that after using this DVD regularly for a while, I will get back my toned, lean thighs. :)",1348617600,11,665,3.977272727272727

8484490,4,B005S0STKK,"I brought this workout dvd about two years ago on a last minute decision, and I have yet to regret buying it. I thought that this would be a good workout for flexibility and toning your lower half, and I was right. I had stopped working out due to knee and hip injuries that left it painful to do any sort of exercise, therefore any muscle or improvement I had was gone. So, after healing I pulled this dvd out of my drawer and got to work to get into better shape. After doing this workout I felt like my legs were spaghetti because I worked all areas of my lower half. Now I am a short woman who stores most of her fat in her lower half such as hips, thighs, and bum. This dvd gives you back a piece of confidence after knowing that while it may seem like a simple workout, it is also challenging. I am two weeks into this workout again and I realize that it is a challenging video, but you can build up to it and along the way the workouts will be easier. I haven't seen much results yet but I feel my lower half being more toned and my posture is even better.",1483401600,,1063,4.018867924528302
8484491,5,B005S0STKK,"Mari Windsor is my favorite form of exercise. I danced ballet for 11 years, so my body responds well to these types of exercises. Her sequences are well thought out and you can feel the difference after the first week or 2.",1471996800,2,223,4.333333333333333
8484492,5,B005S0STKK,"Seriously, that girl looks so much like Olivia Munn, it's insane.  Overall, I really enjoyed this work out.  I felt a difference in all the areas that Mari worked and I find her instruction really easy to follow.  I am not a pilates expert by any means, but I always finished this DVD feeling stronger and longer and well-stretched.  It's very low impact, not very challenging, and probably wouldn't do very much if you're only doing this DVD once a day.  It should be paired at least with some good cardio.  I also felt a little disappointed because I was unsure how to proceed--should I do all the work outs at once?  One a day?  I was trying to figure out what would give me the best results.  Overall, it's an easy to follow, pretty fun pilates DVD--and it'd be a great start for someone who isn't all that familiar with pilates.  Enjoy!",1465084800,,841,4.437908496732026

8484494,3,B005S0STKK,"I do this video every so often but it's not one of my favorites. A few of the moves though, I've incorporated into other workouts. It's not very intense. Mari Windsor's voice gets old fast :)",1456876800,,191,4.333333333333333
8484495,2,B005S0STKK,This is definitely for beginners. I'm surprised it had so many positive reviews.  Though I'm not an advance exerciser this was WAY too easy and very boring- I almost fell asleep and Wasn't sore at all the next day.  I did like the bun and thigh section part of it  but I don't need to watch the DVD to do those moves. Matter of fact I was already doing most of the moves on my own bc I remembered the moves from the Winsor Pliates video I purchased about 15 yrs ago.  Only about 2 Moves I was unfamiliar with.  At least  it was a cheap DVD and I didn't waste too much money. This DVD will most likely collect dust in cabinet.,1453766400,,625,4.040650406504065

Excellent workout!",1453593600,2,134,4.4
