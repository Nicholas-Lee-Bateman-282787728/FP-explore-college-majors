2942144,2,B000VIPXKI,"I have to agree.....This set leaves alot to be desired....episodes are out of order...Picture quality is hit and miss....There are 3 more DVD'sof this series that were NOT included with this set....Volumes 13, 14 and 15....and the quality of those is similar to these.

The only nice thing I can say about this set....I paid far less than the $68.00 (a hell of alot less!!!) than what they seem to be generally asking.

As the other guy said.....The Official First Season is superb....So when do we see the rest??  I believe there were 97 episodes..shown over 3 seasons",1319846400,35,569,4.785714285714286
2942145,1,B000VIPXKI,"First of all this IS NOT the complete series of One Step Beyond.  I, too, am a child of the 50's.  I collect any and all anthologies of that decade.  True, there was a 12 and then an 8 DVD box set released years ago this is NOT THE ONE, not even close and they were not in chronological order nor was it the complete series.  Last year, IMAGE released, The Official First Season of One Step Beyond.  It's wonderful.  This set, that we're discussing here was issued by Alpha and while the majority of these episodes are public domain, they are not cleaned-up copies and will leave a bad stench in the mouth.  Just my 3cents.",1278460800,87,623,4.273504273504273
2942146,1,B000VIPXKI,"I bought this one of course the reviews sounds good to me. I hope to found a kind of ""Twilight Zone"" series,but the most stories of ""ONE STEP BEYOND""haven't
the class of the Twilight Zone. The quality of the DVD's are really bad!
It was a mistake to buy the complete series without a screen-test before.
The good thing is,it wasn't expensive & it was a fun to see some famous actor's
first step's on TV-screen.",1270080000,42,410,4.407894736842105

8218861,5,B000VIPXKI,"i have one step beyond volumes 1-12 and 13-15. i agree with comments made by other reviewers that this isn't a complete set of all of the episodes of the show.  i think there are 90 to 100 episodes.  i don't know who owns the rights to one step beyond but would enjoy getting a copy of the rest of the episodes if/when he, she, or they get around to doing it.  the sets i have are in decent condition to watch.",1451779200,3,410,3.975609756097561

8218864,3,B000VIPXKI,"This isn't a complete set! There are some key episodes that aren't there. The stories themselves are spellbinding. But not having a complete set knocks this ""complete set"" down to 3 strars.",1383868800,5,189,4.9375
8218865,5,B000VIPXKI,"I remember watching this series when it first came out. I am enjoying watching it again.
No obscene dialog, no graphic violence and the cinematography is advanced for that time period.
The only damper would be watching this with someone who prefers watching something more modern. You just have to look past the dated clothing and sets to realize this series was a real gem.",1370217600,4,374,4.769230769230769
8218866,5,B000VIPXKI,"If you don't mind the black & white scratchy Picture ( the series is from the late 1950's) The stories are absolutely fascinating!----& they are all based on TRUE stories, thats more than you will get from the ""main stream media"" today.",1369958400,6,236,4.642857142857143
8218867,1,B000VIPXKI,"The dvds' arrived on April 19th and I couldn't wait to view them, and to my surprise they were horrible.
The quality of the DVDs' are fair to very poor!!! they look like they were record with a video camera directly of the tv screen. Some of the videos were almost black you could hardly see the picture. And inaddition episodes are missing and are out of order.
There are bargain dvds' you buy for 3 dollars each.
I would love to send them back and get my money!!!!

8218869,1,B000VIPXKI,"In spite of its impressive twelve volume Set, this is not,
as other Raters mentioned, the complete collection of One
Step Beyond. The pictures and sound are very poor.

Sad to say, Paramount is very slow in producing the complete
series. Lately, a definitive set was released in three DVD's.
It mean we have to wait for a long time before we can have
a glimpse of this classic show.",1339459200,13,382,4.457142857142857
