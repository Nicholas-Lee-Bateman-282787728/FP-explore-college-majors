8762197,5,B01G3JQQUE,"This wonderfully and imaginatively produced DVD introduces us to the man and his music. Erratically shot home footage is wonderfully intercut with music and dialog. There's a lot very well produced performance video, nearly all with great sound and production values, mostly between 1965 and '76. A dozen or so interviews are well integrated with the music, most effectively with Dorthann Kirk, and a half dozen other musicians who played with him, especially trombonist Steve Turre. One of many highlights is the performance on the Ed Sullivan show by an all-star band led by Rahsaan that included Charles Mingus,Archie Shepp, and Roy Haynes.

I had the great pleasure to hear Rahsaan in small clubs both before and after his stroke. He was a powerful man with great creativity and drive, and I'll never forget the experience. This video does him justice.",1491004800,4,856,5.070921985815603

8762199,3,B01G3JQQUE,"Rahsaan Roland Kirk remains a fabulous, inspirational musician, but this was a bit of a let-down. Maybe this documentary is a good introduction to those unfamiliar with his work, but it does not have enough musical content, and the interviews are not revelations. Perhaps there simply are not a lot of archival recordings of his performances. Some of the interviews emphasize that he was much more than a guy with a gimmick of playing multiple saxophones (or flutes) at once, but the performance footage focuses a lot on just this. He was as good a tenor sax player as anyone in the business, but there is too little footage of his straight-ahead soloing. Overall, his genius is more talked about than actually shown.  I'd recommend this to completists. Neophytes would spend their money more productively on his recorded musical legacy.",1486598400,6,837,4.978571428571429

The interviews, graphic interludes and performance clips are put together so it feels Rahsaan Roland Kirk is speaking to the viewer. Beautiful.",1474848000,3,364,5.385964912280702
8762203,5,B01G3JQQUE,"A truly great portrait of a remarkable man and musicians   but I wanted one more extras.  I'm certain as part of putting this together, Adam had a ton of extra footage, great interviews, that could've been turned into special features for the disc. And I realize, that takes an additional production effort, and more budget, so that may have been a consideration. But when I bought the desk, I truly was looking for more extra features in addition to the presentation. This was a missed opportunity .  True Rahsaan fans want more about the man.  Also, what about more interviews with people who knew him and interacted with him-- Yusef Lateef being a great example   the man  could've provided a great inside, and was still alive while Adam was putting this together.  Otherwise, the film is wonderful. Buy a copy and support jazz music.",1474156800,8,837,4.756944444444445
8762204,5,B01G3JQQUE,"As a Kickstarter backer of Adam Kahan's documentary, I have seen this film twice, including on a theater screen at IFC Film Center in NYC. I am taking it on faith that ArtHaus Films has done a good job of mastering and presenting the project in this ""commercial"" incarnation.

Rahsaan Roland Kirk (1935-1977) was a genuinely unique artist. For the connoisseurs of his art, it goes without saying that his technical and aesthetic abilities are unimpeachable. What particularly won my personal loyalty (I only got to see him play in person once, unfortunately) was his wicked/delightful sense of humor and great social consciousness. Despite being unable to apprehend what was going on in the world around him visually, having been blinded in early childhood, he was keenly aware of the racism and other injustices of American society and the social movements to oppose them that swelled up in his lifetime. His commentary on such issues, incorporated into the recorded documentaries of his music making, is what made him so special for this reviewer. Naturally, this habit caused controversy and added impediments to his ""commercial"" viability. From the time Rahsaan discovered he could play multiple reed instruments simultaneously, he encountered disdain from some music critics who wanted to dismiss him as a ""circus sideshow act."" This way they could conveniently ignore the amazing encyclopedic knowledge of music history the man had absorbed, which led him to provide a better name for ""jazz""--Black Classical Music. But, this is not the place to try to recap the man's whole biography. [See ""Bright Moments"" by John Kruth, for that, in the Book Department]

This film is largely the documentary I myself longed to make about Rahsaan back in the mid-1990s, but I despaired of being able to locate enough footage of the subject. After all, this is a musician who did not get in his lifetime the respect he deserved. Director Adam Kahan did a superb job of tracking down and ferreting out material from who knows where, including interviews recorded for European TV. This is supplemented by beautifully filmed (using the Red Camera) interviews with colleagues and contemporaries, including Kirk's widow, Dorthaan. Creative bits of animation are occasionally used to accompany audio snippets that lacked film footage.

This is the story of a human being who gave and gave of himself, with or without being appreciated, until his candle burned out at age 42. ""If life hands you lemons, make lemonade"" Rahsaan was fond of saying. I know I risk preaching to the choir here, but I can assure the wider arts public that this film presents the story of a truly remarkable individual and master musician, superbly told. Like a properly mixed batch of lemonade, it blends the bitter with the sweet.",1471910400,14,2792,5.065217391304348
