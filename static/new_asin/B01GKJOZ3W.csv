The recording's sound is state of the art.  Some will be put off by the campy & revealing costumes.  I say lighten up, folks!  Harmonia Mundi skimped on the liner notes.",1492646400,,341,4.301587301587301

 CD on Archiv or for a truly charming Baroque DVD, try Lully's Persee on EuruArts. You can't go wrong with those.",1491091200,,294,4.345454545454546

Note:  When I came here to post my ""review"", I noticed Amazon's warning about it being a Region-2 disc.  That is incorrect.  The DVD is NTSC, which is Region-1.  At first, on my Samsung player, the blu-ray disc would not start.  Later on, when I tried again, it worked perfectly and I was able to watch the bonus material (which is not on the DVD).  I do not understand why it would not start at first; it may be (just a guess) that I had started the player before turning on the TV; I really don't know, but I can assure you both discs work perfectly (and I paid only $12 for the whole thing, perhaps because of Amazon's warning -- another thing I can only guess at).

P.S.  If I may give you some advice:  When you buy this, treat yourself  also to Handel's Agrippina -- the one with the ugly red wigs (ugly, but different shades of red for the two women); I found it very entertaining too.",1481760000,,984,4.126315789473685
8763155,3,B01GKJOZ3W,"I love the French Baroque, and Rameau in particular, so I was pre-disposed to like this performance. I played the Blu-ray on our hi-rez projection system for a small group of friends. Unfortunately, by the middle of the Prologue we were bored stiff. From the rhythmically slack account of the overture, to the aimless recits and wandering arias, to the shapeless dance sequences, this is a shockingly lack-luster performance. I lay the responsibility for this turkey at the feet of the conductor, M. Pichon.
Hear for yourself! Contrast and compare this with Marc Minkowskis alert, scintillating performance on DG Arkiv CD. His recording of Dardanus runs a good half-hour less than Pichons, yet they are using substantially the same edition of the opera. Also compare Emmanuelle Hams brisk and shapely account of Hippolyte et Aricie on Erato DVDsa gorgeous physical production as well. In Blu-ray, Lullys Atys, lovingly conducted by William Christie, is another magnificent staging in every respect.
Which brings me to the physical aspects of this Bordeaux presentation. I didn't get the sense that the designers trusted the music, treating us instead to lurid, Crayola-colored sets, and cheesy costumes that in many cases verged on the vulgar. Direction tends to the camp genre. The interminable dance sequences were not especially well-choreographed, and as I have already indicated, the dancers were certainly not helped by the unsteady conducting.
The video director likes close-up shots. A lot. Endless tight, tight shots of the singers quivering jaws and perspiring, overly made-up faces. A good opportunity, however, for the doctors in the house to diagnose their tonsils, I guess.
Finally, the presentation itself is surprising, coming from this illustrious label. Harmonia Mundi usually provides copious notes and documentation for their major issues. Not so here! They give us a digipak, along with a pamphlet which lists the cast, contains a puff-piece about the performing edition and a few photographs. No track list or timings, and miniscule type directs us to their web site for data on the singers. The Blu-ray is super sharpfacial pores galorebut the DVD is quite fuzzy, even on my computer screen.
Although at a lowish price, not recommended, alas. I give it barely three stars because the singers are good, doing their best against formidable odds.
PS: As is shown on the product's back cover, above, the Blu-ray is ""all-region"" and plays just fine on my Sony.",1477785600,6,2478,5.213032581453634
8763156,5,B01GKJOZ3W,"You could criticise Jean-Philippe Rameau's Dardanus - and indeed most of the composer's tragdie-lyriques - as being a little too stiff, formal and serious, the work straight-jacketed by precise rules and conventions that Rameau and his predecessor Lully before him helped establish. You could however admire Dardanus for the very same reasons, for its composer's ability to fit such beautiful music, song and dance into a very rigid format and make it a wonderfully entertaining spectacle. And there's the key to the success of this Bordeaux production of Dardanus, a work composed in 1739 and scarcely heard of again. It finds a natural warmth in the beauty of the supposedly rigid composition and presents the work with some respect for its colourful spectacle and entertainment.

Dardanus adheres very much to a classic narrative whose primary purpose is not to present any kind of credible or coherent drama, but to present a drama in music. Opening with the obligatory Prologue featuring Vnus and Amour ('Triomphe, tendre amour""), Dardanus is five acts of fairly standard plotting with sentiments of forbidden love and conflict, with the obligatory sea monster thrown in for effect, all of it leading to a rather contrived conclusion. Rameau pads the whole thing out with lots of dancing and a structure that seems to run on an aria-ballet-chorus-ballet-recitative-ballet-aria loop. Dardanus has the potential to be very dry indeed with all these interruptions to the dramatic flow.

Rameau's music however is much too good to let it be drowned in a dull academic presentation. There is a sense of establishing beauty and order on the world in the music itself - learning to love instead of hate - and Raphal Pichon finds the beautiful warmth in Rameau's writing that underlines such sentiments, as much in the interplay of the instruments as in their individual qualities. There are moments of sheer wonder here, even in those little side events, such as in the little pastorale 'Paix favorable, paix adorable' which takes the form of a chorus, turning into a ballet and then into a duet which has all the joyous quality of a Handel oratorio.

Michel Fau's direction and Emmanuel Charles' set designs don't feel the need to update all this to a modern setting, but neither do they attempt to recreate baroque theatre effects. Using projections and modern stage effects as well as traditional costumes they achieve both impact and spectacle. The production never quite resorts to kitsch or parody - other than where the occasion really leaves no alternative - but finds its own dazzling vision for the work. The libretto is beautifully articulated here by some beautiful and appropriately pitched voices. Florian Sempey carries the honours as Antnor, his lyrical baritone complementing the warmth of the production. Galle Arquez's Iphise is bright, her emotional conflicts expressed purposefully, never faltering. The figure of Dardanus is relatively bland by comparison, and characterised as such by Reinoud van Mechelen's light but sweet tenor. Although limited to only a few scenes, Karina Gauvin is the kind of singer you want to make the necessary impression when Vnus makes her appearance, and she fulfils that role well. It's Katherine Watson however, taking up the bit-part roles of Amore, a Shepherdess, Bellone and a Dream, who gets to feature in some of Rameau's most beautiful little incidental arrangements. The beauty and inner warmth of Rameau is all in such little details.",1471564800,11,3494,5.158730158730159
