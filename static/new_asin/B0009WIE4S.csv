8068226,5,B0009WIE4S,"Tracey Ullman is a one of a kind comedian with many faces, a clever, quick witted mind, and a great sense of humor who unleashed her critical view of typical Americans, whether they are rich or poor, she doesn't hold back!  I found many of her skits hilarious!",1423440000,,260,4.416666666666667
8068227,5,B0009WIE4S,"A wonderful biographical stage show from one of the greatest comedians of our generation.  Fun and informative, no punches are pulled in this one.  Very honest",1392508800,,159,5.076923076923077
8068228,5,B0009WIE4S,"This autobiographical show is yet another manifestation of the quirky genius that is Tracey Ullman.  Certainly, if you're **not** curious about Ullman as a person or interested in how she came to do what she does and how her characters were developed, then don't buy the DVD (reviewers who were disappointed on this score should give themselves a single star for failing to read the product description before purchasing).  But if you think you'd like to watch Tracey herself tell you her story on stage, with music and dancing and photos and props, in a very funny and wryly detached sort of way, then Add to Cart while you still can.  It's a highly unique turn by a very gifted person.",1238284800,,687,4.661157024793388
8068229,3,B0009WIE4S,"Although Tracy Ullman is a brilliant comedian, this DVD show is not what is the best of her memorable characters.  One of the best comedians ever, Tracy can create the voices, look and physical attributes of characters.

This is a live show of her life beginning in Britain, when she was a child performing before the mirror and for her mother, little about her drinking mother and stepfather, through her dancing years, singing career, onto New York, Los Angeles, and the creative Tracy Ullman Show.  Part of her show is the birth of her two children.

She creates a few characters onstage with the help of backup cast, costume changes and a live band.  But the show does not reveal those characters she can do best, those that made her more famous.  So if you are looking for that, skip this ....Rizzo",1236297600,,803,4.619718309859155
8068230,1,B0009WIE4S,"This wan't the Tracy I was hoping for.  The whole DVD is just her acting out her life story, and it wasn't all that funny.  I was expecting something more like the Tracy Ullman show, but was quite disappointed.  Wish I could get my money back.",1154908800,5,243,4.239130434782608
8068231,5,B0009WIE4S,"Tracey is such a clever one. This stand up show is witty, smart and incredibly funny. It was a joy to hear her story from being a little girl after her Father died, to making it big in America years later. She takes you through her young child-era ""talking in front of mirrors,"" to her dance years, to her singing years and then finally when she hits America only to discover so many people to mimic and bring to life in her outstanding HBO series, Tracey Takes On.

This DVD is nicely shot and you get in close on the action, especially during her moments of bringing out some of her most favorite characters. There is a specially wonderful moment where she plays with the wigs of several of her famous Tracey Takes On characters. Not only is it hilarious but it shows how diverse and talented she is at comedy and how remarkable it is to watch her ability to switch characters on the snap. All of this adds to constant laughs.

I've watched this more than I will admit. I've gathered family and friends to watch this and we're all dying of laughter throughout the show.

Enjoy!",1142467200,8,1079,4.4120603015075375
8068232,4,B0009WIE4S,"I'm a huge fan of Tracey, but it's no 5 stars.  Honestly, it's more like 3 stars, but it does have its moments.  It's more of a story of her life.  Personally, I don't care so much about her life, I would rather have more of her characters.  Still, fans of hers will enjoy it.",1130284800,,276,3.963636363636364
