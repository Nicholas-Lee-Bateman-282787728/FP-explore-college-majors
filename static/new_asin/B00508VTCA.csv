It would be nice to actually see the person that is doing the running and see how fast they are running, and watch them go up hills, jump over logs or steps etc...",1376611200,,273,4.25
8450868,3,B00508VTCA,"I have several Virtual Active DVD's and as stated in a previous review, for me, the Chicago run is the best.  I have the Los Angeles run in cue, so I am hoping for that DVD to come in at least a close second; or dare I say, even better than the Chicago run.  I doubt it, but we shall see :).

When I visited Seattle, I absolutely loved the city.  It was during the summer when everything was green and lush with gorgeous, bright sunny days.  The scenery during this time of year is magnificent.  Therefore, I was kind of hoping to experience that same majestic beauty on this DVD; and for several segments, it fell short.  The run through the park (the first park...I forget its name) was the best and also the run through Pike's Place was nice as well.  As for the rest, I was bored and kept looking at the clock on my treadmill to see if my run was nearing its end.  Not a good thing as running on a treadmill can become quite boring, and for someone like me who is not a natural runner, when on a treadmill, I need something visual to keep me going.",1373932800,,1052,4.117647058823529
8450869,5,B00508VTCA,"I'm a military wife and move alot. I miss home often, I love being able to run on the treadmill and have the feeling I'm back in Seattle. It's very realistic and makes time go by super fast. I've bought others now too (the Egypt one is my second favorite) my toddler loves to sit on the floor by me as I workout and we go ""sight seeing"" highly recommend",1372464000,2,353,4.057142857142857
8450870,5,B00508VTCA,"I just love the virtual run DVDs, I use them when I'm on my elliptical machine and it makes the time go by very fast!",1342224000,,117,3.72
8450871,5,B00508VTCA,"Excellent workout option to add to my Walk/Run/Cycle DVD collection! Lots of pleasant encouragement to keep me on target. Beautiful locations that I will enjoy watching again and again.

I chose the Pacific Northwest Run because I enjoyed going there a few years ago and thought it might be nice to revisit the area this way. It was. All of my favorite places were there, the waterfront, the marketplace, the streets around our hotel. There were other places that I hadn't gone but wished I had. Gorgeous narrow wooded paths with waterfalls, Mt. St. Helens in the distance. It was an enjoyable ""run"".

This is my first 'Virtual Active' DVD. I have all kinds of cycling, walking, and running DVDs though. I enjoy using a different one for each workout, using my spinning bike, elliptical, treadmill and/or a combination. I love them all! Now I have a new brand to add to my collection. I like the selection of the location and the very pleasant commentary. I especially enjoyed the sounds of nature. Music is also an option as well.

I try to allow myself only one selection/day and my workout is planned to be 1 to 1-1/2 hours.

VirtualActive Pacific Northwest Run is 30 minutes, so I did it once with instructions/music and again with just natural sounds. Both were excellent.

The instructional hints were basic reminders. It was nice to have virtual 'company' going through the DVD the first time.

During the second time, with the natural sounds only, I heard a bee buzzing, a couple of runners, marketplace sounds, wind, and water. Very pleasant.",1332028800,2,1551,4.790262172284645
