3714527,5,B0006N5JK2,Wow! These fights are almost all absolutely horrible; there is very little to no technique on display here but they are a hell of a lot of fun to watch.,1376784000,2,152,4.1
3714528,5,B0006N5JK2,The product description tells you exactly what's on the dvd. Some fighters are VERY amateur. Others are up and coming pros. Josh Burkman's VERY FIRST FIGHT is on here. Burkman is currently ranked #5 in the world at welter weight and is 3-0 in the UFC. This is 'grass-roots MMA'. That means the fighters are BRAND NEW! If you are looking for highly skilled Jiu Jitsu blackbelts. This one's not for you. If you want to see some guys slug it out........It's the bomb!,1143590400,2,464,4.535714285714286
3714529,1,B0006N5JK2,"This is the first review I have written even though I've bought countless dvds online. The reason I am so compelled to write a review this time is to save you all some money. DO NOT BUY THIS DVD. Unfortunately Amazon will not allow me to give this dvd less than one star, which I certainly would if I could.

This is the most disappointing MMA dvd I have EVER seen (it's so scrappy I feel ashamed to refer to it as Mixed Martial Arts...). I love my fight dvds as much as the next man, but this was too painful to watch. No, not because pain was inflicted, but because I've seen better fights between 60 year old women swinging soft handbags.

The dvd claims proudly that none of the fights on the dvd go past the second round - wow that sounds exciting right? Wrong! The reason no fight goes past the second round is because almost every single fight ends with the fighter giving up because he is completely exhausted. I actually laughed out loud when a seriously overweight ""fighter"" tapped out as soon as the other ""fighter"" mounted him because he was so exhausted. The guy on top didn't even get to throw a punch from that position, the other guy just layed back and tapped out because he was inches away from losing his lunch due to his supreme lack of fitness. Throw in a few sound effects and you've got a great funniest home video - unfortunately I bought it for the fighting, not the comedy effect. The funniest thing is a few of the ""fighters"" on this dvd have just gotten out of jail. All I know is if that's how they fought in jail, they were definately giving Bubba a back rub on request...

You know what else annoys me? Not one of these guys knew how to defend. Their only defense was rotating their head 180 degrees (their only skill) when they thought the other person was about to throw a punch. When they weren't doing that they would throw hay-makers and hope they'd land, before falling over due to disgraceful lack of fitness, then spent the rest of the time on the ground either cuddling like they were back in jail or tried to throw punches as if they were back standing up (which never landed). Not one person on the ground knew what a guard was and the best submission was a choke (if you could even call it a choke...), which almost all of them went for. In their eyes a submission was getting the other guy into a headlock. Just astoundingly pathetic.

In conclusion, if you want to see unfit, unskilled, unintelligent, unexciting ""fighters"", then this dvd is for you.",1129680000,2,2495,4.382289416846652
8324849,2,B0006N5JK2,"Two stars.... maybe a bit too harsh.  These guys are definately not pros (UFC material).  So I didn't expect the fighting to be up to that standard.  But the announcers are what really made this bad.  It's pretty obvious that this was all done after the fights were done and recorded.  Kind of like those police chase videos where they just happen to have the same reporter in the helicopter, even though the incidents are in different, cities, counties, and states.  The comments were obviously written after the fact.  I give the fights 3 stars, but the overall it has to be two stars.",1436486400,,587,4.586538461538462
8324850,4,B0006N5JK2,Beginning days of MMA but still have some good fights,1436054400,,53,4.4
8324851,2,B0006N5JK2,"The fighting was okay. Needs improvement with the lighting in the ring, seems like there are few lights on. Didn't see the whole program.",1434412800,,137,4.75
8324852,2,B0006N5JK2,Cassette quality.,1434240000,,17,8.0
8324853,2,B0006N5JK2,"Was more like a cheesy tough man competition than mma...the fighters(term I use VERY lightly) barely knew any moves and thank God cuz the announcers butchered everything they did. Everything was a ""haymaker,headlock,or a choke"".. They didn't even know what a rear naked choke was. Was worth a laugh but, not great",1417392000,,313,5.038461538461538
8324854,5,B0006N5JK2,Love watching this,1413676800,,18,5.333333333333333
8324855,2,B0006N5JK2,Backyard fights except for maybe the last 2 fights. When you compare this to the current ufc or pride you can tell that there are really no good skills in display in the UCE and for the most very disappointing.,1399593600,,210,4.275
8324856,1,B0006N5JK2,"Lame fighting, not worth my time watching. I've seen better fights outside a bar. Boxing ring was a bad idea.",1391904000,,109,4.5
8324857,3,B0006N5JK2,"The lack of technique with most of the fighters, shows the importance of technique... Though super low budget, didn't regret the time watching.",1379289600,,143,5.260869565217392
8324858,5,B0006N5JK2,"Lots of action, without wasting too much time watching the fighter come into the ring. These fights are not professional, but they are well match game fighters. The show demonstrates the reason MMA went from a boxing ring to the octagon/cage. Overall a very entertaining show, I'd like to find and watch some more from this series.",1378598400,2,331,4.824561403508772
