8629076,5,B00H1B0UG0,"In an effort to mix up my workouts, I've been on a barre kick. This is after years of doing heavy weight training and intense cardio.  I love what barre has done for my body; and it has done this with no joint jarring exercises!

The barre workout features Candace Ofcacek.  She shows a new, fun twist on ballet moves.  It's 40 minutes. The equipment you need:  chair, small playground ball, light dumbbells, and exercise mat.

The workout is filmed in the Barre 3 studio, which is a light and airy room, with light wood.

The workout is structured so that you can either do the entire 40 minutes, or pick and choose from the 10 minute sections.
he sections:

DYNAMIC STRETCH AND CORE-11:49 minutes
You are doing large movements for warm-up like rocking back and forth on your legs.  You also do some plank variations to heat up your core.

LEGS AND ARMS--11:20 minutes
You do many variations of plies while working your arms.  The infamous standing ball squeeze is here too.

GLUTES AND CORE--10:58 minutes
The glute work gets your heart rate up, since you are doing large, dynamic movements with your legs.  The ball is used for core work, between your legs and also under your feet.

CORE AND STRETCH--9:04 minutes
More core work, this time you are lying down with the ball under your tail bone.  You move your legs up and down.  You also do torso twists with the ball placed behind your back.  I love doing torso twists with the ball behind my back since I can really feel my obliques, but I'm not struggling to maintain my form.

Why I love this workout:

* It sneaks up on you.  As I was doing this, I'm thinking to myself, ""well, this is fun, but it doesn't seem all that hard.""  Well, I could barely walk the next day, my leg muscles were so sore.  And this was a good thing!  I love feeling that I have really worked my body.

* The small movements, with the Candace's meticulous form pointers work your muscles in new ways.

* The focus on the core, while doing other movements.  I know core work is good for me, but I don't like doing it.

* How I feel.  I feel like a graceful ballerina doing this workout.  Okay, so I don't really look like a graceful ballerina, but it's fun to imagine.

This is a great barre workout that will challenge your muscles without killing you.  It will sneak up on you.  I truly felt the magic of barre with this workout; meaning, the workout seems to get harder the more you do it.  The best explanation of this is that I am learning better form and can go deeper, so I am constantly challenging myself.",1400976000,44,2546,4.371794871794871
