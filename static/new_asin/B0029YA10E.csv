8358534,3,B0029YA10E,This film is way too much money! Some of the angles are difficult to make out what the guy is actually doing making the practice confusing,1470700800,,138,4.346153846153846
8358535,5,B0029YA10E,One of the best tutorial videos on this subject available!  I would rate it six stars if I could.,1467590400,,97,4.105263157894737
8358536,5,B0029YA10E,"This DVD is incredibly informative and was more helpful than any other resource I've taken for Thai massage. The teaching is clear, concise, and easy to follow. I have personally experienced great results receiving and giving Thai massages while following this DVD. Worth every penny!!",1438905600,,285,5.355555555555555
8358537,1,B0029YA10E,"Started out fine, but near the end of one part the DVD stopped to ""skip over a damaged area.""  That dropped about 5 minutes from the DVD.  Then it happened again at another part.  Pretty soon, the DVD wouldn't come up at all.  The DVD player says ""Supported Disc not Available.""  Re-tried multiple times.  It's beyond my 30-day window for return, so I guess it's a frisbee now ...",1426636800,,380,4.434782608695652
8358538,5,B0029YA10E,I found the instruction very easy to follow and I love the fact that he gives many techniques in different positions so that you can choose which is most comfortable for you to provide the best service.,1401148800,3,202,4.486486486486487
8358539,5,B0029YA10E,"One of the best dvd on thai massage.
Richard Gold is very clear in his explanations and techniques are shown in detail.
His approach is of someone mature and this comes from his pedagogical method of teaching.
Ideal for someone willing to consolidate his knowledge on Thai massage.",1398729600,2,281,4.875
8358540,5,B0029YA10E,The best massage video. I went to Thailand and my spine was in pain due to the long flight and also because I have spinal problems Thai massage is the best massage its relaxing feels good and improves your state of mind.,1387238400,3,220,4.261904761904762
8358541,5,B0029YA10E,This is a great video.  I have seen a lot of bodywork videos and this one is done professionally so that you can really see and hear the techniques.  I have taken hands on classes in Thai Massage and this is a great refresher on specific movements and techniques.,1376438400,6,263,4.346938775510204
8358542,5,B0029YA10E,"I researched this before ordering; I need to return some stretching techniques to massage because I do not believe that just ""rubbing"" someone the right way is enough, muscles need to be stretched and elongated. One of my clients told me about receiving Thai Massage after a long airplane ride in a very small plane. He said the little gal at the Motel worked him over so he could get to his training out of intense pain. He said the stretches did wonders for his lumbar pain. I used to use the so called Swedish techniques but had gotten away from them due to problems in draping a person for modesty and yet give them the good stretches. As you can see this can be done to the fully clothed person. Another modality which can be shared with clients and my co-workers in surgery who have had to stand for long periods in the operating room or recovery room. Thank you Amazon for carrying so many educational materials.",1362009600,10,919,4.476190476190476
8358543,5,B0029YA10E,"and get a so-so product but this dvd is GREAT!

pros - perfect pace for practicing along with, background info, excellent demonstration and explanation of techniques, hundreds of techniques to choose from, great price, great production quality (sound, picture...), navigation feature (you can skip through techniques)

Now there is no routine per se, for 60 or 90 minute Thai Massages, but I already knew this because the description says that. This should not be a problem at all. Creating your own routine is ridiculously easy when Richard gives you all the information and demonstrations you could possibly need.

I highly recommend this dvd.",1346889600,11,645,5.242718446601942
