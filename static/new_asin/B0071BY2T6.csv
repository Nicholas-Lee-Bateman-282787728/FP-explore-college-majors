8508135,4,B0071BY2T6,"Scholastic / Weston Woods brings classic and popular children's picture books to animated life in a great series of DVDs.  This one has a theme of animals acting in unexpected ways.  This is a good collection of stories, but it is not as popular with my little library patrons as some of the others in the collection.  The DVD contains....
1.  Katie Loves the Kittens - Katie is a dog who is thrilled when her owner brings home three kittens.  However, her excited reaction scares the kittens and is misinterpreted by her owner.
2.  Scaredy Squirrel -  A super cautious squirrel never leaves the safety of his one tree, and worries about everything.  Then one day he falls out of the tree, and discovers he is a flying squirrel who can soar.
3.  The Cow Who Fell in the Canal - This one is a classic about a bored cow stuck on the farm until she falls into the canal and floats on down to the city where she creates quite a stir.
4.  Roberto the Insect Architect - Most termites want to eat wood, but Roberto wants to build with it.  Stop playing with your food, his parents say.  He doesn't listen.
5.  An interview with Melanie Watt, author of Scaredy Squirrel  - Pretty much for adults.  Not that interesting, frankly.
6.  Interview with John Himmelman, author of Katie Loves the Kittens - Also aimed at adults.  A little more interesting.",1525651200,,1342,4.479338842975206

8508138,4,B0071BY2T6,This will work quite well in my various aged classrooms. I enjoy having the books on a DVD to review as well.  Thank you.,1403395200,,121,4.041666666666667
8508139,5,B0071BY2T6,Loved this scholastic DVD.  We have enjoyed all the scholastic DVD's so far and would recommend them to anyone.  I usually get the book at the same time so my autistic daughter can read along with the DVD.,1394755200,,205,4.368421052631579
8508140,5,B0071BY2T6,We have most of these DVDs - it's a great series. The narrator reads as the words are displayed on the screen with the animation.,1384560000,,129,4.2
8508141,5,B0071BY2T6,"My kids (4 and 6) don't get exposure a lot of exciting movies and video games, so this video may be too tame for some kids. Mine, however, love it to death. The younger one quotes this in his everyday life -- he might actually think he's Scaredy Squirrel, as far as I can tell. I recommend checking any scholastic videos you're interested in from the library and then buying if your children like it.",1383004800,,400,4.346666666666667
