4598239,5,B0058DBX46,"I gave Angel Wars to my 5 year old Nephew - he went crazy over it as did his 8 year old sister. It is a great way to explain the concept of spirtual warfare and the unseen spirit realm to a child. Highly recommend these videos.

One of the videos came scratched but Amazon replaced it immediately.",1357689600,,297,4.120689655172414
4598240,5,B0058DBX46,"Superb storyline, brings on the faith! My kids love it, its action packed and really fun to watch. The movie teaches about the battle for mankind. Angel stand for redemption while demons stand to destroy mankind thru temptation. I relly love the parts where the angel win by kneeling an praying. Love this stuff.",1353196800,,312,4.796296296296297
4598241,5,B0058DBX46,"My son loves superheroes.  This is his favorite series.  It's full of action and clean.  It's not Christian finatic, simply faith based.",1349568000,,136,5.090909090909091
4598242,5,B0058DBX46,"My kids love Angel Wars! What a great set. Wish there were more shows like this, especially on Tv! Would have been even better if each Dvd was 60-90 minutes long.",1331596800,3,162,4.258064516129032
4598243,5,B0058DBX46,I bought this for my five year old grandson and an additional set for my 66 year old husband.  This is a series that young and old enjoy.,1331510400,,137,3.892857142857143
8461393,5,B0058DBX46,"This is my favorite of all the series I own. I trust it for my kids. I like that fighting isn't always the answer but trusting GOD to show you the way in every situation works. I pray these people will hurry up make more. I don't know what is wrong with Amazon but they better let NIKO come back with more episodes! People are tired of the brainless, witless, near pornagraphic garbage they call cartoons these days. Bring NIKO back! Niko and the Sword of Light",1450742400,,461,4.310344827586207

8461395,5,B0058DBX46,These are very good. I have used the angel wars shows in my children's church for years. The kids love them.,1398729600,,108,4.190476190476191
8461396,3,B0058DBX46,"Don't use these episodes to teach theological/Biblical concepts to your children--certainly not to very young children. There are several problems with them, including the idea that angels earn their wings.  As mentioned by another reviewer, Im uncomfortable with the idea of angels working with demons.  I think they were trying to portray forgiveness.  Also prayer is amazing, but I think we also need to teach children that sometimes Gods answer to prayer is no.  If God denied the Apostle Paul when he asked for the thorn in the flesh to be removed, why do we think he will answer in the affirmative to everything we request?  In short, there a lot of things I don't agree with, but compared to whats out there right now when it comes to entertainment, they are not bad.  I think its important to teach children how to analyze what they are watching and in that sense, this could be a good tool.  Again, watch with caution and do not watch with younger children.",1388793600,2,966,4.680473372781065
8461397,5,B0058DBX46,"Angel Wars has insightfully introduced my sons to the concept of warriors fighting for us.  It is hard to find good spiritual war educational material for young people. Most kids' material depicts angels as babies or weak.
In the words of my nine year old, ""Angel Wars is awesome!""",1387065600,4,281,4.73469387755102
8461398,4,B0058DBX46,"I purchased this for my twelve-year-old brother and he loves it. The stories are good, if slightly confusing at times. Values are, of course, good. I really would recommend it for older children, but it's definitely a worthwhile buy.",1373500800,4,233,5.0
8461399,5,B0058DBX46,its a wonderful show on angels and i like to see others views on how they look and what they do,1373414400,,95,3.5714285714285716
8461400,5,B0058DBX46,"Have I gotten your attention? Angel Wars is totes legit! This series provides a hardcore, stylized fantasy epic that is a great Christian alternative to franchises like Devil May Cry. The story follows a group of fledgling angelic warriors locked in battle with the unseen demonic forces that seek to influence us and assault us on a regular basis. Serving The Maker King, a really cool allegory for God and Christ, the angels wage war with everything from super speed to a golden katana to a great war hammer.

My nephew absolutely loves the series, and I'm glad to see a Christian studio willing to step outside of the box and do something beyond the usual Hallmark Christmas Specials Christian media is so often relegated to.

Angel Wars is great, you should get the whole set. You totally won't regret it.",1366156800,2,809,4.7304964539007095
8461401,1,B0058DBX46,"DO NOT buy your children Angel Wars! It's a disgusting travesty!!! We broke it and threw where it belonged. They depict angels as argumentative, ego driven failers, who are weak and have to ""earn their wings"". Here's a news flash - PEOPLE FAIL - the heavenly host of this current kingdom do not! The first episode is about a scientist who lusts after a woman, who in turn is trying use him to sell a cosmetic line.(yeah, that's real relatable to my 6yr old son) By the end of the Angel Wars trilogy angels are making deals with demons, and demons become friends with angels!! UGH, what a waste of money and an EPIC FAIL.

I should also mention that the only reference to God happends once; they call him the ""maker king"", and that's only for the introduction of angel wars. You won't hear the name of Jesus ever mentioned either. I guess they don't want to offend anyone by using his name? But they seem to have no problen calling Satan ""Lord"" in one of the episodes. Another tidbit is that the archangel Michael is almost crushed at the end of the trilogy - but he miraculously survives because he was holding a ""protection"" stone, not because of prayer, unlike one other review said.

The music videos in the bonus features are not appropriate for young children. Very dark, and creepy. Not encouraging or relatable for children at all - let alone most adults for that matter...",1360540800,11,1380,4.538152610441767
8461402,5,B0058DBX46,Grand Kids Love them. A great way to glorify God in an animated series! Wished there were more in the series.,1360454400,,109,4.238095238095238
