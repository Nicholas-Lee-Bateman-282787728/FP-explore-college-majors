1718898,5,B000067J11,"I watched this when it first aired on PBS a decade ago and it's just as good as the miracle of life that aired on PBS almost 20 years earlier. however, life's greatest miracle goes into a little bit more detail in fetal development than miracle of life since the info on baby making and the photography are updated. this documentry on conception to birth also follows a couple awaiting the birth of their first child and like with miracle of life, the birth scene was also tastefully done and the part that almost had me in tears was when the new parents were looking at and being overwelhemed with joy about the life they created and brought into the world. again, know alot about conception, birth, and pregnancy since i wanted to be an OB-GYN.",1349395200,,746,4.492647058823529
1718899,1,B000067J11,"After read the title, ""Life's Greatest Miracle"", I assumed that this was a documentary about Rush's ""YYZ"", and not about stupid fetuses! Babies arn't miracles, there are literally millions of them everywhere! I was a baby once, and that didn't seem very miraculous. Neil Peart's drum solo on ""YYZ"" off of ""Moving Pictures""? No human could pull that off without divine intervention. That, my friend, is a true miracle!",1343433600,,417,5.057971014492754
1718900,4,B000067J11,"Honestly- I think I liked the original better, but uncertain if
i would show that version to my child.  But- We watched this with our 7.5 year old after he came home and described snake reproduction, learned from a book on reptiles at school.  I felt momentarily uncomfortable with the birthing scene at the end.  This, the image of a human head emerging from female genitalia was not  recognizable to him (he thought it was her stomach) and required a brief explanation.  It wasn't easy for me, but parenting requires being the grown up sometimes, doesn't it?  The scene seemed brief to the former version and seemed less painful for the woman- at least in my foggy memory of it. Some kids might get bored, but our son is into science/nature shows and this fits right in with those interests.  Too young?  No- he's not.  In fact this is a good time to be discussing sex & reproduction- when it is nothing more than factual material and a little bit gross, too :)!",1327881600,5,964,4.526011560693641
1718901,2,B000067J11,"The title is misleading for sure!  This is a Pro-evolution smutty take on the most wonderful gift God can give parents (besides their salvation of course!)  You are told that DNA is 5 billion years old (prove it!) and they basically in the visuals and also in the very smutty beginning with all the half-naked people on the beach that we are ""animals"" and we need to reproduce.  They then show people in skimpy clothes, a man with a disgusting tatoo of a naked woman on his arm and just proceed to take everything miraculous out of the miracle that conception and growth and birth is.  Also toward the end when you see the woman in labor, we are told that birthing is more dangerous for humans than other mammals and even OTHER primates (inferring of course the evolutionary theory once again that we are descended from apes...) This DVD only gets acceptable at around the 22 minute mark and then after you think it is interesting and safe to watch, they throw in a naked time progressed shot of a woman's body laying down and changing in pregnancy.  I can understand showing the growing belly but once you add the breasts it is just plain pornography disguised as ""science"".  We all know women have breasts, I thought this was about how the BABY grows and develops???  Pass on this one.  When a mom is pregnant they can share with their family how their body is changing (it gets pretty obvious) but we cannot show what is taking place in the womb.  That's all I wanted to research, not all the excess garbage.",1326153600,8,1511,4.5054945054945055
1718902,5,B000067J11,"I watched all fetal development video from Netflix and baby center.com website. Then I decided this is for keeps.

Life's Greatest Miracle is concise and visually engaging.",1319846400,,172,5.37037037037037
1718903,5,B000067J11,This is some amazing footage. Really presented well. Very informative and yet so moving to see. This is a good tool for teaching older children up to any age adult. I used this in my anatomy class with adult learners and they were captivated.,1234483200,,242,4.5227272727272725
1718904,3,B000067J11,"""Life's Greatest Miracle"" is a one-hour PBS program on how the human life starts in the womb.  Produced circa 2001, it was an updated edition of the ~1983 ground-breaking ""The Miracle of Life,"" also aired in the U.S. under the auspice of the Nova series.

I've watched both DVDs and I'll compare the two.  If you are debating which version to watch, I say it depends on your interest: if you want to see more microscopy photography, get the original ""The Miracle of Life.""  If you want a better viewing experience, get this one, ""Life's Greatest Miracle.""  I give both DVDs 3 stars.

While not as ground-breaking as the original, ""Life's Greatest Miracle"" sports higher-definition, more colorful microscopic video images, which are simply amazing.  Of course, everyone who's never seen a large number of sperm swimming around will simply be mesmerized.  I couldn't tell whether the all the video footage of the wiggling sperm was the same as in the original edition, but it seemed to me that here either the sperm were stained more (with chemicals so they stand out against the background, as is done all the time in biology), or the producers somehow increased the contrast.  To the viewer, the action (no pun intended!) is more captivating.  (In the old edition, images are coarser and less colorful.)

The biggest difference between this edition and the original program is the emphasis of the content.  The original edition emphasizes the science part, and there are long sequences of cells dividing and inside looks of the vagina and uterus.  This edition focuses on the entire process more, and speeds up and cuts out some of the long microscopic video scenes from the original edition.  The story in this edition is weaved better and seems less like a science class as ""The Miracle of Life.""

Also, the present edition features updated information as well as some additional video (but not much).  Also, there's more animation to help the viewer understand.  The original program tends to get boring and confusing, but things are much more easily understood in this updated volume.

But I only give ""Life's Greatest Miracle"" 3 stars because, like the first one, it just doesn't have enough interesting stuff.  Actual microscopic footage occupies perhaps just 1/3 of the total running time, and there's this unnecessary story of a pregnant couple.  What's more, I couldn't tell whether some of the ""inside the womb"" scenes were microscopic photography or computer-rendered graphics, and this troubles me.  I prefer ""real"" images, even if it means staining cells in order to make them look more vivid.  Computer-generated stuff is fake, and it's worst when someone tries to pass it off as real.

In short, ""Life's Greatest Miracle"" is an informative and enjoyable program to watch -- and you are treated to the commercials that precede PBS's Nova airing!  (Luckily you can forward-skip them.)  Whether you are expecting or not, I recommend this, so everyone can appreciate human life more.

If you want a more science-oriented view with more microscopic footage, get the original ""The Miracle of Life.""  The presentation is drier but you get to see more images that demonstrate how miraculous life is.",1129680000,50,3206,5.0
1718905,5,B000067J11,"I am an expecting father, and as such, in the company of my wife we've been reading and learning about babies and pregnancy. I confess I was in awe with the images from this PBS video. There is not another word to describe the whole process from conception to birth but a miracle! The video in a very easy-to-follow way describes in considerable detail all the stages with the support of extraordinary footage and computer animation. Not just meant for parents-to-be but for everyone at large. Don't miss it.",1049155200,17,508,4.719101123595506
1718906,4,B000067J11,"I think this video has the main four important features in a documentary very well balanced:  scienfic informations, images, 3-D computer generated drawings and real human story. It deserves to be watched once at least.",1034208000,5,219,5.257142857142857
1718907,4,B000067J11,I believe this video is one of the best videos on pregnancy and the development of a fetus.  The graphics seem so real.  It's really a miracle to think of how each person is formed in that way.  I really enjoyed it!,1027900800,11,215,4.071428571428571
1718928,4,B000067J11,"I showed this to my class and in some parts the students seemed a bit bored, but overall I thought it was very informative.  For the most part they did like it and most answered the questions that I made up to go along with it.",1396224000,,227,3.9347826086956523
1718929,2,B000067J11,"My wife and I bought this video hoping to give our girls a meaningful way of explaining the ""birds and bees"", but this video just confused them more.  It discussed the process on such a cellular level, but basic fundamentals were completely lost.  My girls were more confused and had all these biological images floating in their heads and still not clear where babies came from.  I had to supplement their questions with basic charts that I found online.  With these videos, we realized the primary focus is biology, but we also felt it was important to supplement the emotional and committal issues of human sexuality, which it had a little of in the example of a married couple.

This may be a good video for a students who already know the basics, but it really doesn't give a good big picture.",1392076800,,798,4.591549295774648
1718930,4,B000067J11,"Overall I would say this is worth the purchase. With a baby on the way it was fun to watch with my partner. I actually learned a lot. I always thought the fastest sperm was the winner and that it was the sperm that was the hero in the end, penetrating the egg. Actually, the fallopian tubes and egg have a lot of control about who gets through! Really fascinating with great images. The last 10 mins or so are disappointing however, as they basically just go through the entire movie you just watched and to a recap of images and no new information. I would much rather have them end the movie sooner or add something more compelling at the end. If you want to learn about reproduction or to teach a youngster about it, this movie is great, even with the slightly disappointing ending.
As other reviewers have noted, this is the updated version from the one a few decades ago.",1390780800,,876,4.380368098159509
1718931,5,B000067J11,"Though this film is getting on in age, the footage is incredible, plus having a narrator of Jonathan Lithgow caliper on board makes for very engrossing viewing.",1390089600,,160,4.962962962962963
1718932,5,B000067J11,"When teaching human reproduction to my class of 12 year old students, I use this video as our ""case study"". It is detailed, well suited to grade 7 students, and extremely valuable to the curriculum or to home-schooled students. The only caution I will give is the child birth section in the last 4 minutes. Warn the students it is coming and let them hide their eyes if they feel squeamish. Get it!",1388620800,,398,4.465753424657534
1718933,5,B000067J11,A very good video to show many of the events of development to a beginning biology class.  The photography is very clear.  A good video for advanced high school students and undergraduate non-majors in college.,1387152000,,210,4.9714285714285715
1718934,5,B000067J11,It was very informative and explains the basics of cell division and how it is related to the formation of a human being.  There was lots of details about the stages of fetal development.  A very interesting video.,1385856000,,214,4.605263157894737
1718935,4,B000067J11,Best birth control method around (birth).  Complete but slightly silly.  I would prefer to  have a deeper coverage of development in the womb.,1372032000,,142,5.086956521739131
1718936,5,B000067J11,Very graphic and easy to understand for ages 10 to adult. I use it in the classroom for Sexual Health and students really like it.,1368316800,,130,4.24
1718937,5,B000067J11,"This video is unbelievable.  It's amazing how they were able to get real time pictures of microscopic specimens inside the human body.  I showed it to my students in anatomy class and they learned so much about reproductive system from watching the video.

I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to learn about the creation of life from the beginning.",1358035200,,354,4.770491803278689

Although they found the content a bit disturbing, they watched it.  It was an informational video and I believe that my students learned quite a bit from watching it.",1469491200,,282,4.384615384615385
