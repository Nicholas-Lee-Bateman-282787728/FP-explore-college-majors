Then the main event drake younger vs brain damage, what a bloody battle! Barbed wire boards, chairs, and pains of glass. Very brutal match, during the match Brain damage gets a severe cut on his forehead and you can see blood pouring out of his head like a fountain! One fan even threw up because of it. The ending was awesome! I've seen lots of good czw dvds and this ones in the top 10 :) if you like hardcore wrestling and ecw style, then pick this up! :)",1382140800,,580,4.2342342342342345
