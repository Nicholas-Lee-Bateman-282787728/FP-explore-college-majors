7796580,5,1565855515,"I am 67 y.o., degreed with a BA years ago. I am a learning-junkie, have been all my life, except I stayed clear of upper-level math. I want to thank the Great Courses Teaching Company and Amazon Books for offering this unique opportunity to learn the fearful Calculus Made Clear. Dr. Starbird has made each lecture interesting. I am taking, also, the Relativity course by the same company. Professor Starbird is a teacher who loves Calculus and sharing it to other folks like me. Plenty of props are used in the basic concepts of the Derivative and the Integral. Should there be other mathematics courses like this, taught by Dr. Starbird, I want in! Thank you.

7796582,5,1565855515,I wrote to them for details about the product and they were honest. I got a good product at a really good price. Good people!,1325721600,,125,4.04
7796583,2,1565855515,"This teaches what derivative and integral are, but little more. It just doesn't prove to me that calculus can do anything that advanced algebra can't. That is what I hoped it could do because I dropped calculus in college and always wondered if I had missed out on something really terrific. Guess not!",1285804800,,302,4.716981132075472
7796584,2,1565855515,"I own about two dozen separate courses of ""The Great Courses"" (from The Teaching Company) and rave about many of them.  But this calculus course is one of my LEAST favorites.  It does NOT prepare you to use calculus.  It will NOT help you sit down and solve calculus problems.

Far superior is ""The Calculus 1 & 2 Tutor: 8 Hour Video Course!"". I learned more after watching just the first 3 sections (out of 25 total) of it than I did after viewing the entire ""Change and Motion: Calculus Made Clear"" course.  And, ""The Calculus 1 & 2 Tutor"" is less expensive.",1230681600,15,560,4.398058252427185
7796585,5,1565855515,I learned more about Calculus in the first hour of watching this set of DVDs then in all my years of college!!!,1204156800,9,111,4.090909090909091
