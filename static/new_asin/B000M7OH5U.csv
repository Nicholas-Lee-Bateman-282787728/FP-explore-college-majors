8167100,4,B000M7OH5U,"As an older person I need to be more flexible, so I love the non-ball exercises. I am not a fan of balls, but I will give those exercises a shot, at some point; only because it forces me to use  different muscles.",1485302400,,213,3.953488372093023
8167101,5,B000M7OH5U,"Bought it mainly for the Stretching DVD which I love. If you're not into using a Stability Ball don't purchase becauseb 2 out of the 3 programs utilize one.

The Muscle Sculpting DVD's pace is a bit too fast for my taste, but I can see that there are exercises that I will try & enjoy.",1448064000,3,285,4.089285714285714
8167102,5,B000M7OH5U,"I only did the stretching dvd and it is excellent. This is my first Cathe dvd and I found it valuable since as we age, we really need to stretch.",1421193600,,145,3.8666666666666667
8167103,5,B000M7OH5U,"This is a good weekend workout for me. I do it for fun,not to work up a sweat. It is a relaxing and effective workout, after you have done a lot of tough workouts during the week, and you just want to stretch and keep it a low impact workout level!!!",1417824000,2,250,3.9215686274509802
8167104,4,B000M7OH5U,"The CD is a great go to when wanting to work out upper body, lower body, & abdominals
Cathe is a great instructor & highly motivating.",1389139200,,134,4.1923076923076925
8167105,5,B000M7OH5U,"This pair of videos stays on top of the pile. Mainly the sculpting one. It is not too long or too hard. I can slack off the effort on slow days and go at it strongly on good days. Cathe does a good job of working the whole body just enough to keep me strong without any fluff. Each body part is worked and then briefly stretched emediately. That way you don't have to do a boring stretch thing at the end that puts you to sleep. This short workout is very efficient. The stretching video is good also but I do not use it as often because the sculpting one includes stretching. I feel safe with Cathe since she is so thorough in explanations and demonstrations. FYI I workout every other day, am pushing 60 and have worked out my entire life so I know a good routine when I find one.",1356393600,6,782,4.117647058823529
