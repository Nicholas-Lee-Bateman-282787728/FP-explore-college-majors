8299207,3,B001EOQD16,"This is one of four volumes of Cash's Annual Christmas show, as broadcast on CBS, released by the Country Music Hall of Fame and Shout Factory. Recorded in Nashville with Johnny and his family, this time he invites Anne Murray and one of Cash's songwriter idols - Tom T. Hall. Hall gets a couple of solos and then joins Cash for a medley of Hall's compositions. There's just enough Christmas music to make it seasonal. For some reason they decided they wanted some non-Country comedy and invited Andy Kaufman, who, at this point in his career was best known for his role in TV's ""Taxi"". This is by far - except for Kaufman fans - the weakest point in the show.

While not the best show in the series, it's still Johnny Cash, who rarely gives a bad performance and ""Five Feet High And Rising"" is really the only song Cash from the ""standard"" Cash repertoire.

The quality of the video print is excellent.
