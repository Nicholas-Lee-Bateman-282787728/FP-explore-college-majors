5339783,5,B009I2OA2U,"Only problem with 'Shout Factory' is they do not have 'closed captioning' for hard of hearing.  As this is an older show, those of us who loved Simon and Simon years ago, are a wee bit older and some of us could use the closed captioning.  You pay the extra money so you can get this show, but Shout Factory needs to then provide a better quality.",1355011200,6,347,4.164179104477612
5339784,4,B009I2OA2U,"This 1987-88 Season of SIMON & SIMON rocks and is the first season when Joan McMurtry joins the cast as Rick & AJ's hard-nosed new cop buddy(Lt. Abigail Marsh)from San Diego P.D. whom replaces her streetwise predecessor Det. ""Downtown"" Marcel Brown whom departed the show in the Spring of 1987.

This season also takes me back to memory lane to when I was a Freshmen in high school and when CBS used to show this detective drama every Thursday night.

Something I found intriguing about this detective drama was SIMON & SIMON was it seemed unique in many ways, because for one thing, SIMON & SIMON was of the first and very few detective shows that took place in San Diego instead of L.A., New York, or even San Francisco.

For another, it was also one of the few detective shows about a detective-duo, especially since Rick & A.J. were not only brothers, but were partners that ran a private detective agency together, unlike most of detective dramas like the ROCKFORD FILES, MAGNUM, P.I., MATT HOUSTON, MANNIX, etc.; since Rockford(James Garner), Magnum(Tom Selleck), Houston(Lee Horsley), and Mannix(Mike Connors)were all private dicks who worked solo and ran their own private investigations agency by themselves as opposed to Rick(Gerald McRaney)and A.J.(Jameson Parker), despite the fact that the premiere of SIMON & SIMON on CBS in the Fall of 1981 was inspired by THE ROCKFORD FILES and MAGNUM.

As a matter of fact, Gerald McRaney and Mary Carver(Cecilia Simon)have both guest starred on the ROCKFORD FILES which was of course before Gerald McRaney became a star and probably how McRaney got the idea to portray the ex-Marine Vietnam veteran now gonzo private P.I.(Rick Simon)since McRaney played a police detective on the ""Hotel Of Fear"" episode of the ROCKFORD FILES back in the Fall of 1977.

In fact, SIMON & SIMON reminded me a lot of the ROCKFORD FILES since Rick & AJ not only had a love/hate relationship with each other like the down on his luck private-eye Jim Rockford(James Garner) did with his often exasperated cop buddy Det. Dennis Becker(Joe Santos)from the LAPD, but the Simon brothers lived kind of an eccentric lifestyle like Rockford did since Rick lived on a boat in the backyard of A.J.'s house just like Rockford lived alone in a small rustic trailer in a parking lot by the beach in Malibu on a shoe-string budget since Rockford was frequently beat up by crooks, shot at, ripped off, kept his gun in the cookie jar, and often got snookered by clients just like the Simon Brothers did, plus Rick was always broke like Rockford was on top of that.

This 1987-1988 Season of SIMON & SIMON also had some interesting guest stars in it like
*Bill Boyett known for his role as Sgt. MacDonald on ADAM-12 in the ""Something Special"" episode

*Charles Cyphers from HALLOWEEN, THE FOG, and ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK in the ""New Cop In Town"" episode

*Thalmus Rasulala from the sitcom WHAT'S HAPPENING and played Capt. Bolz on THE NEW DRAGNET appearing in the ""Forever Hold Your Piece"" episode

*Robert O'Reilly whose known as Gowran on STAR TREK: DEEP SPACE 9 in the ""Ain't Gonna Get It From Me Jack"" episode

*Joan Pringle who played Sybil Bucannon on THE WHITE SHADOW in the ""Little Boy Dead"" episode

*Kim Miyori from ST. ELSEWHERE in the ""Tale Of The Tiger"" episode

*Richard Herd known for his co-starring role as Capt. Dennis Sheridan on T.J. HOOKER in the ""Ties That Bind"" episode

Original air-dates for each 1987-88 Season were

So now that SIMON & SIMON's 7th Season is finally released on DVD, I can hardly wait to watch it, but I noticed a slight discrepancy on the back of its packaging when it says SIMON & SIMON was originally aired on NBC from 1981-1989, because it was actually on CBS from 1981 thru 1989, not on NBC.

In addition to that, SHOUT didn't even bother to provide Closed Captioning on this DVD either for some reason, perhaps due to budget cuts!

By the way, SHOUT will be releasing SIMON & SIMON's 8th and final season on DVD on Tuesday January 15, 2013.",1353456000,4,4403,4.88993288590604
5339785,5,B009I2OA2U,"I really liked this season especially entering a new cop who is a female to replace Downtown Brown. I was very touched in the episode ""Sudden Storm"" that the show dealt with a real issue that happens in society and how the brothers dealt with the crime and especially liked the ending where the whole family came together and was able to begin the healing process.  The brothers are getting better cases and they know most of the people in San Diego which makes getting cases easy and they are able to be more financially stable.  I would recommend this show to all my family and friends because it shows family values and is better quality for family viewing.",1352851200,3,660,4.53781512605042
5339786,5,B009I2OA2U,I don't remember how far into this season I saw cuz it was awhile ago but I'm glad it finally came out so I can get it and finally watch the entire season! I'm 17 and have been watching this show since I was 12. It used to run on the Sleuth channel and I watched it on there but after awhile it came off air and I didn't get to see all the episodes. I know I saw up to some point in season 7 but didn't get to see the whole season. Can't wait to get this so I can see season 7! YAY! :D,1352678400,,485,3.542056074766355
5339787,5,B009I2OA2U,"We loved this show & really enjoy the dvd's to watch any time. We can't wait for Season Eight, we have all seven seasons so far.",1352332800,,128,3.9615384615384617
5339788,3,B009I2OA2U,"I love Simon & Simon and I am really struggling to get the latest release.  Why?  I'm not in the US. Really fed up that Shout Factory are unable to provide this to non US residents as the studio, Universal, won't let them.  really nasty tactics that, seeing as Shout did what universal wouldn't!!  So not fair on those domiciled overseas.  I don't have anyone in the States who would buy them for me and send them over (with me reimbursing them obviously) so I'm reliant on some kind American seller putting them up for sale here, NOT charging four or five times what they are worth (as happened last time - just to make money out of the overseas fans).  These are selling on the Shout website for $29.99 and there is a US seller here as I write selling it for the same - but not to overseas fans (I could cry!!!).  The last season I did manage to get on Amazon through a US seller was over $69.99 - why is that fair?

I am so unhappy with Universal as Simon & Simon does not just have a US fan base!",1349568000,4,1000,4.118556701030927
5339789,4,B009I2OA2U,"The seventh season of the 80s P.I. show is here, this season produced just 16 episodes like ""Shadows"", ""Sudden Storm"", and of course ""May The Road Rise Up"". With Tim Reid departing at the end of season six were introduced to a new character, Lieutenant Abigail Marsh, played by Joan McMurtrey. The tone of this season is at it's darkest with plot-lines about the rape of Rick and A.J.'s mother, Salvadorian death squads, a homeless girl forced into prostitution and the truth about what really happened to the Simons' father is finally revealed. Guest stars include Delta Burke, Olivia D'Abo, Jason Hervey, Dick O'Neill, James Shigeta, John Schuck and Patti Emler (reprising their roles from season six's ""Tanner, P.I. For Hire""), Luke Askew, David L. Lander, Robert O'Reilly, Joe Sirola, Richard Herd (reprising his role from season six's ""The Rookie""), Jack Lucarelli, Shelley Smith, Sandy McPeak, Judith Ledford and Charles Cyphers.

The previous seasons were 6-disc sets with the last two being priced at $49.99 each, this season is a 4-disc collection and that means the price has dropped, this set cost $29.99 from Shout!, BUT, the shipping and handling cost another $29.99, almost $60 in total.  Since this is the second-to-last season of the series I think it's a pretty safe bet that Shout will release season 8, they've come this far.

01. New Cop In Town
02. Desperately Seeking Dacody

5339790,3,B009I2OA2U,"""Simon & Simon"" was such a terrific, unique, humorous and fun detective television series.

Jameson Parker was perfect in the role of private investigator A.J. Simon.
Gerald McRaney was perfect in the role of private investigator Rick Simon.

I rated the ""Simon & Simon: Season Seven"" 4-disc DVD set three stars because I think that some of the episodes included
probably aren't uncut.

In Season Seven, Joan McMurtrey was added to the show as the new cop in town, Lieutenant Abigail Marsh.
The only episode of the seventh season that she didn't appear in was ""Baja, Humbug"".
The only episode of the eighth season that she didn't appear in was ""Ain't Gonna Get It from Me, Jack"".

The seventh season of ""Simon & Simon"" originally aired on CBS from December 3, 1987 until April 7, 1988.

Here are the exact running times for all 16 episodes from ""Simon & Simon: Season Seven"" on this Shout! Factory DVD release.

New Cop in Town - 47:49
Desperately Seeking Dacody - 47:50

Teasers were included at the start of all 16 episodes on this 4-disc DVD set.

The picture quality and audio quality on this DVD release are both good.

The packaging that Shout! Factory used for ""Simon & Simon: Season Seven"" is perfect.
Season Seven is stored in a plastic DVD case that holds all four discs.
None of the discs share the same side of any of the disc holding trays and none of the discs overlap any of the discs  either.
