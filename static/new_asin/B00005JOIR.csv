1548450,5,B00005JOIR,"I will not even attempt to convey how powerfull this movie is in words as that is not even close to possible.  The most powerfull film I have ever seen period.  The influence of the pro-Israel lobby in this country is so pervasive that we are unable to have an open debate without having the debate seemered by equating any opposition to Israel human rights violations to 'anti-semitism'.  The resulting unquestioning military support for Israel makes the US just as liable for Mr. Miller's death as the mercenary who pulled the trigger.  It is easy for us to pretend that this is not happening, so god bless Mr. Miller for giving up his life to bring us all a glimpse of this story and hopefully we will all wake up and begin to look honestly at Israel's policies before we allow our immoral allengence to further deteriate US integrity and security.",1144281600,11,851,4.6158940397351
1548451,5,B00005JOIR,"This documentary is both extremely sad and extremely powerful. I first saw Death in Gaza when it originally aired on HBO a couple years ago. Since then, I've periodically searched for it to no avail. When I found out Amazon.com would be carrying it, I immediately purchased it. This is a must-see for anyone interested in Middle East politics or the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It is both heart-breaking and disturbing to see what  reality is for so many. One of the most moving scenes for me is the funerals for the martyrs. Some are crying, some are chanting militant anthems, and a man on a megaphone incites the people to Jihad. ""We must continue the struggle until victory or martyrdom"" he urges, his voice reverberating while an eerie soundtrack plays in the background. Seeing the impact on the children is also difficult to watch. This is a reality that should be seen by all.",1141862400,14,886,4.790849673202614
1548452,3,B00005JOIR,"If this documentary had been finished, and its primary film maker not killed, I have no doubt it would've been a very powerful spectacle to behold. James Miller (documentarian extraordinaire) was killed by Israeli soldiers before he had a chance to finish the film, but before he died Miller had uncovered some startling realities around the Palestinian/Israeli conflict. His focus was to be of the children on both sides of this ongoing battle but his death left the documentary unfinished and, thus, unbalanced.

The entire focus was on the Palestinian children and how the Israeli tanks, daily bulldozing of houses near the Gaza Strip, and the fanatical behavior of militants-cum-martyrs has eaten away at common sense. Although this is undeniably so, the fact that ONLY the Palestinian side was shown gives the film a very uneven keel. Had someone picked up where Miller left it, I feel that the energy of its final impact would've been staggering and given even more relevance to Miller's life and, ultimately, untimely death. This is easy for me to say, sitting here at my computer, typing away, but that's how I see it as a film, not as a personal assault on any moral values I hold for (or against) the Israeli's or the Palestinians.

I guess my main problem with the film was that it was trying to show ""why"" Miller was there (i.e., the effect this ""lifestyle"" has on a kids), while at the same time showing what a dedicated documentary-maker he was and how that ultimately ended up killing him. This pulled the viewer away from what should have been the focus -- the kids -- and put the emphasis on Miller. Why? I'm not sure.

I'm not going to take any credit away from Mr. Miller or Mrs. Shah. They're both able film makers and camera-folk. Their shots are often equally incisive, poignant, and gruesome. But the fact that this film remains unfinished is the biggest shame. Perhaps that's the message they wanted to get across ...that the documentary was left undone, just as Miller's life was. But this doesn't translate to film very well, especially when dealing with such a volatile subject matter.",1141257600,6,2112,4.7967032967032965
1548453,5,B00005JOIR,"On the surface, Death In Gaza hits all the `right' notes for the `sophisticated'; terrorists are militants, Israelis and Palestinians die in cycles of violence. The evils of the `Israeli occupation' are explored from the point of view of the Palestinians(the killing of the filmmaker stopped his intended exploration of the Israeli children of the conflict).

But sometimes despite the `best' of intentions, the truth seeps out. Are we to have sympathy for the `paramilitary unit' who use the smart, perceptive Palestinian toddler to run interference for them as they hide behind him? While the filmmakers clearly look at the conflict in terms of a purely nationalistic struggle, the children express hate for Jews-the sons of monkeys? Where did they get that? The young are inculcated in hate, the religious dimensions of which are central, the nationalistic qualities-secondary.

Therein lays the rub. There is no two-state, one-state or half-state solution to the `cycles of violence' just as there is no `peace process.' There is Jihad. There is religious conflict. There is hate. Once upon a time, Israel existed within the '67 borders, yet there was no peace. One upon a time, Israel existed within the '48 borders, yet there was no peace.",1140912000,5,1245,5.158415841584159
1548454,5,B00005JOIR,"British filmmaker James Miller traveled to Palestine in 2003 to make a documentary about the affect of violence on the lives of Palestinian children. He also planned to make a companion film about Israeli children. Tragically, Miller was shot and killed by Israeli forces in Rafah while making his documentary. Consequently, the film's focus was diverted from its initial purpose. What remains is a film that is partially a tribute to the bravery and commitment of Miller, and partially a story about the poisoned lives of children growing up in Palestine.

The camera captures the atmosphere of the streets. Walls are covered with posters of militants and those killed in the conflict. When the sun sets, there's an unearthly scene as the street vendors disappear and then ""paramilitaries come out at night using the dead to recruit more militants."" Of course, those recruited are usually young males--some still in childhood. In one horrific scene, Saira Shah--also the film's narrator--is brave enough to interview some hooded Palestinian paramilitaries who are grooming Ahmed, a young boy to join their ranks. The paramilitaries play games with the boy and the games slide into teaching him how to hold a rocket grenade launcher. When Shah asks if it is moral to recruit young children to be terrorists, the hooded paramilitary member strokes the boy's head and chillingly responds, ""don't worry about responsibility, sister, we're men, when we say goodbye to Ahmed, there are 1000s more like him.""

The film shows quite clearly that children on the streets of Palestine are well aware of imminent death and that their lives are irrevocably altered by their day-to-day existence--it is common for children to write letters to their families in case they are killed. ""Death in Gaza"" cannot be labeled as 'pro' or 'con' either side of this mess, and the film's position is strongly anti-violence. What a tragedy that James Miller was killed, and what a loss that we will never see his intended companion piece film--displacedhuman",1134086400,34,2032,5.13595166163142
1548455,5,B00005JOIR,"This DVD is packed with interviews from Palestinians in Israel - from mothers who lost children in gun fire, to children studying at school, to militant leaders of fanatical Islamic suicide groups allowing very small children hold rocket launchers while telling them to ""be a man"".

Unfortunately, the journalist who films the majority of this documentary was shot in the neck and died before he was able to interview Jewish children. This film documents the tragic problems that the children must endure and the hate that keeps any peace from occuring.

1548639,5,B00005JOIR,"Context:  The film and thus these comments are a snapshot of the situation ""on the ground"" in the West Bank and Gaza in 2003.

The film opens in Nablus (West Bank), where the Israelis are known to conduct many targeted assassinations.  The rationale?  Since the second Palestinian intifada (uprising) began in 2000, 80% of all suicide bombings are planned here.  In addition to the assassinations of leaders, there has been a general military crackdown, as we experience firsthand by observing Israeli tanks rolling down Palestinian streets.  As we observe the tanks' threatening manuevers (including a chase after stone-throwing children), co-director Saira Shah tells us that 800 Israelis and 2000 Palestinians have been killed in the three years since the second intifada began.

The directors then move to the Gaza strip, where most of the film is shot (in Rafah).  We meet three Palestinian youth who are central to the narrative:  Ahmed (12), his loyal friend Mohammed (12), and Najla (16).

At the beginning of the film, Saira asks:  ""How do children learn to hate?  To die in order to kill?""  We are meant to understand this documentary as an investigation into these issues.  Almost right away we begin to learn to learn what these children believe, and what has led them to see things as they do.  Mohammad says that his Mom has told him that the Israelis ""shoot... They don't know Islam.  They're criminals.""  Perhaps worried that he's creating the wrong impression, Mohammed adds:  ""I want to be nice to everyone, apart from the Jews.""

We see that the Israelis are creating a ""security zone"" between Rafah and Egypt by bulldozing Palestinian houses.

On the stone walls, we see many posters of suicide bombers and innocent victims--all celebrated as martyrs in the struggle.  Saira tells us that this is an effort to use the dead as propaganda to recruit more militants.

Then we meet Abdul Sattar (11).  Abdul shows the filmmakers his ""in case"" letter to his family.  The letter that they will receive if he is killed in the struggle.  Abdul helps Saira decipher the string of colorful symbols, which say (in part):  ""I intend to continue jihad until I'm martyred.""

We see Palestinian children playing ""Jews and Arabs.""  In order to win this game, you have to die as a martyr.

Some of the things we hear the children say:

""The Israelis are cowards.  They're afraid, but they pretend to be strong with those weapons.""

""The Israelis are pigs.  They don't know God.  They don't know how to pray.""

Najla leads a young female relative in chanting the names of the six family members who have died at the hands of the Israelis.

Another little girl says that the Jews are ""sons of dogs.""  When Saira asks the little girl if she's ever met a Jew, the girl explains that she's seen them on TV.  They wear helmets, they carry Kalishnikovs, they come in tanks, and they shoot.

Saira comments on Palestinian martyrdom:  ""They're outgunned by the Israelis.  So they've turned death into victory.""

Ahmed shows us the grave of his friend Hosni Al-Najjar, who was shot in the head by an Israeli sniper.  He explains that the death of his friend moved him to start helping the resistance.

In a particularly chilling scene, we seen Ahmed (age 12) being indoctrinated by a group of masked Palestinian militants.  After building rapport by playing a child's game with him, they show Ahmed how to hold a rocket launcher.  He declares:  ""I'd like to blow up Sharon's house.""  The militant leader asks him:  ""After that?""  Ahmed:  ""Martyrdom.""

When Saira asks if it is right to deprive Ahmed of his childhood, the leader tells her that ""We were deprived of a childhood.""  Some of the militants lost their little brothers in the struggle, he explains.  Now Ahmed is their little brother.

When Saira persists in questioning the morality of putting Ahmed on the front lines (""Is it responsible?""), the leader becomes impatient.  ""Don't worry about responsibility, sister.  When we say goodbye to Ahmed, there a thousand more kids like him.""

We next see Ahmed in school, where the students are standing and reciting the poem ""Identity Card"" by Mahmoud Darwish (1964):

...I do not hate people  Nor do I encroach  But if I become hungry  The usurper's flesh will become my food  Beware...  Beware...  Of my hunger  And my anger!

In another scene we see Ahmed with a friend, making quwas (handmade grenades).

Saira asks a Palestinian youth if he has any hopes for peace.  Palestinian:  ""Peace is not possible.""  Saira:  ""Why?""  Palestinian:  ""They've killed too many of us.""

But aren't these Palestinian children too young?

One of them replies:  ""Martyrdom's not just for grown-ups.""

In a quiet moment alone with Ahmed, Saira asks him if he's ever thought about what it might feel like to be shot.  He seems genuinely puzzled.  Stumped.  It's clear that he's never thought about this before.  After a long pause, he replies:  ""No--why would they shoot me?  I'm a little boy.""

We see Salem, a 14-year-old boy wounded by Israeli fire, rushed to the hospital where emergency surgery is performed.  He dies six hours later.  At the funeral, his sisters are told it's a disgrace to weep.  It's time to rejoice.  The mourners chant:  ""To Jerusalem we go...  martyrs by the millions.""

On their last day in Rafah, the filmmakers visit Mohammed, who is at home with his mother.  Mohammed is worrying that his good friend Ahmed will be martyred without him.  Mohammed wants to them to be martyred together.  His mother objects:  ""Even if that makes your mother sad?""  Yes.  Mohammed is adamant.  His mother calls for an end to this kind of talk, and asks him to think about going to university, about raising his own family, about peace.  Mohammed reminds her that she has several children.  ""Let every house have one martyr.""

When co-director James Miller is shot and killed by Israeli gunfire (the shooters are actually mercenary soldiers--Bedouin Arbas working for Israel), Palestinian militants put his face on a poster and celebrate him as another martyr for the cause.  Saira objects to this, and notes that James would have as well.

In the epilogue, we learn that Ahmed has stopped working for the paramilitaries, and now he wants to be a cameraman.  So does Mohammed.

Najaf's home was destroyed by Israeli soldiers...  now she is homeless.

Co-director James Miller had planned to complete this film by interviewing Israeli children.  Now he will never have the chance.  Shouldn't Saira Shah, or someone, take up the mantle and complete this project?  Without that next step, ""Death in Gaza,"" however valuable as a historical document, is incomplete.",1227571200,5,6655,4.875224416517056
1548640,5,B00005JOIR,"Hmm...

* All the scenes in schools involve teaching kids to hate Jews. (Funny, I've been through years of Jewish education and spent lots of time in Israeli schools, and I've never seen the reverse towards Muslims.)

* Kids get shot at because they spend their afternoon recreation time throwing hand-grenades and rocks at tanks while they're at work. Well, duh? And their deaths accomplish *what*, exactly, for Palestinian statehood?

To me, this movie accentuated the pernicious evil of the paramilitary ""resistance"" organizations in treating kids as weapons -- and the concomitant unlikelihood of a shared peace settlement. The more of their children die pointlessly like those in the film (such as in blowing up Jewish ""pigs"" and ""dogs"", to use their own words from the film), the harder it's going to be to accept a legitimate compromise settlement -- they'd have to accept that all of their kids really did get themselves killed for nothing.",1180569600,5,948,5.064102564102564
1548641,4,B00005JOIR,"There were some scenes in here I was glad I saw. Nothing was quite so powerful was watching boys throwing stones at tanks and seeing tanks fire back. Stones versus tanks. To those that say the movie is biased because it doesn't cover the Israeli point of view, I will reiterate what has been said over and over--he was killed before he got a chance. The crew seemed rightly appalled at the way Palestinian miltants used children--this is no blind propaganda for the Palestinian cause. But you know, if ever anyone had a good reason to be biased, it would certainly be one who was killed by the mighty while weilding only a white flag",1176076800,5,633,4.51304347826087
1548642,5,B00005JOIR,"This film about life among young Palestinians packs the usual punch of HBO documentaries. Celebrated British filmmakers Miller and Shah get as close to the skirmishes directed against Israeli troops as possible, capturing footage that refuses to turn away from the human cost of this particular kind of urban warfare. It is high-risk filmmaking, and we know from the start that Miller is killed by Israeli gunfire before the shooting of the film is completed.

Viewers not familiar with the Palestinian resistance will be shocked by the impact that fear and hatred of the Israelis has made upon the youngest generation - the boys flinging rocks at Israeli tanks, who have come under the influence of masked, gun-wielding insurgents. We meet two young boys, close friends, who manufacture explosives, and an older girl who has lost several members of her family and weeps at yet another funeral. The romance of martyrdom overwhelms their youthful world as a welcomed though not fully understood prospect.

There is little resolution to the powerlessness the viewer can feel watching this film, and those sympathetic with the Israeli side of the equation will find it represented by distant, menacing armed figures in military uniforms or moving through the streets in tanks - objects to be feared, scorned, and hated. And as the film represents this ongoing struggle, there seems to be no end in sight.
