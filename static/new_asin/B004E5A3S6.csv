8426498,5,B004E5A3S6,"This is the beginning of the series with Aliens and humans getting along. However, there are humans that do think the Aliens are that benevolent which maybe true. Do not be so trusting.  Gene Roddenberry is a great Alien writer for sci-fi  shows that some people like to watch.  I really enjoyed the Earth series along with other series he has created.",1403308800,,352,4.645161290322581

As a fan of anything ""Star Trek"" it was worth taking a look at ""Earth - Final Conflict"". Although the cast is largely unknown, the story line is enough to keep interest going. The concept of aliens visiting Earth as being friendly and secretly having a different agenda has been done before but the plot sill has plenty of twists and turns. On that basis, I recommend you give this a go.",1351814400,2,1013,8.83495145631068
8426503,1,B004E5A3S6,"Box sets (1), (2), (4) & (5) all discs had scratches on them, some bad enough that the section had to be skipped as they stopped playing.",1327276800,,137,4.111111111111111
8426504,5,B004E5A3S6,"My wife and I watched this series when it was on many years ago and have patiently waited for the release of the entire series (we could have done without season five but maybe we'll enjoy it this time around). We were not interested in purchasing one season at a time. We wanted to wait.

Although we're still in season one, I can say that seeing it without commercial breaks, and all those tight cuts that were used to get as much advertizing in as possible, has really enhanced our enjoyment. I'd also say that, so far, it's even better than we remember.

I know everyone complains about the packaging, and I agree, it could have been done better. That said, with a little care, you can get the disks in and out without doing any major damage (except to your nerves).

If you were a fan of the series or, you're just looking for something completely different in sci-fi, I don''t think you'll be disappointed.",1303344000,2,912,4.481927710843373
