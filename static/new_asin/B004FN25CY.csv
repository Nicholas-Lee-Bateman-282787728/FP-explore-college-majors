8427961,5,B004FN25CY,"GM provided rare access for the film crew to follow the earliest Volt automobiles through the new assembly line. Lots of good information about modern car production and specifics about the Volt and it's battery pack. I have seen several of the Ultimate Factory episodes concerning auto manufacturers and they're all good. Go checkout the one on Ferrari for a contrast, or the one on Tesla, very different products and corporate cultures. This one is a snapshot of modern Detroit at it's best, amazingly from the same company (GM) that was crushing EV-1's just a few short years before.",1494806400,,586,4.929292929292929
8427962,5,B004FN25CY,"Even though this is Chevy Volt specific, the story of a new car coming into physical form was simply amazing.  I had no idea, for example, what ""seaming"" was until I saw a master at it folding the sheet metal on a pre-automation testing form.  The soak testing, the production line test runs...

It only made me hungry for more behind the scenes about the Volt since it has been in production for few years.  I own a 2013 and can see many small tweaks in my car since the introduction.  It is still the only production car like it on the road, with most major manufacturers announced similar E-REV designs.  Excellent addition to the shelf, especially since you can't stream it yet. ;)",1362009600,2,685,4.483870967741935
8427963,4,B004FN25CY,"This 2009 National Geographic documentary was released in DVD format in 2010, so the scope is limited to the manufacturing of the Chevrolet Volt pre-production models circa 2008/09.  Consistent with NatGeo series Ultimate Factories, the film presents a detailed account of all the minute work that was undertaken by General Motors before moving into mass production. The Volt pre-production units were handmade, requiring quite an impressive combination of craftsmanship with high tech. Nevertheless, all intellectual property secrets are well kept, as no details are presented about the battery pack or the Volt's powertrain. As a consequence, the Volt's inner workings are just explained in very basic terms and the documentary focuses mainly in the manufacturing process. Despite this caveat, I think electric car buffs and Volt fans will enjoy this documentary.

Since Volt deliveries began just last December, fans will have to wait a bit before more in-depth books, documentaries or other materials are published. In the meantime you can read Larry Edsall's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Chevrolet-Volt-Charging-into-the-Future/dp/0760338930/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Chevrolet Volt: Charging into the Future</a>. Because it was published in December 2010, the book's coverage is limited to the events taking place before the Volt launch, and offers a quite favorable/non-critical view of General Motors. Nevertheless, the book presents interesting insights regarding the development of the Chevy Volt. Also, do not miss the upcoming ""Revenge of the electric car"", the sequel to the 2006 documentary&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Who-Killed-the-Electric-Car/dp/B000I5Y8FU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Who Killed the Electric Car?</a>.",1304467200,4,1829,6.680672268907563
