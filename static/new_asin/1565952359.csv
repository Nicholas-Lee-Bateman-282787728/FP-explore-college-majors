7796658,2,1565952359,It turns out that it is not quite the sort of thing for me. I did view it. I hope someone can get some enjoyment out of it.,1411257600,,123,3.4285714285714284
7796659,5,1565952359,"You can not find a better, more erotic Playboy DVD than this.  The girls are absolutely perfect and ""natural"".  The ""Egyptian"" theme and the hanging up laundry scenes are amazing!!!",1390953600,,181,5.0
7796660,5,1565952359,I mean it is a little soft but I like every girl in this lineup.  These are some good looking playmates,1365638400,,103,3.9047619047619047
7796661,4,1565952359,"This isn't my favorite ""Playboy Video"", but it isn't my least favorite either, so it's worth owning, in my humble opinion. Tishara Cousino is attractive to me, since I love pretty and sexy Italian ladies, and she has two scenes in this one. One in which she dances is rather sexy. Vanessa Gleason is always sexy to me, and she has one clever scene with a guy in a haunted house. There are other girls in this scene, but Vanessa is the only one who appeals much to me. As I said, Vanessa is always sexy, but she has better scenes in other videos. Some of the other girls look nice enough, especially Elke Jeinsen, but none approach Tishara and Vanessa in my book.",1335657600,,662,4.346774193548387
7796662,4,1565952359,Rebecca Scott had a hot scene. Kristi Cline and Jennifer had a hot scene together. The rest of the video is all right but not super-hot.,1006646400,,136,4.269230769230769
7796663,1,1565952359,"I like Playboy videos, but this is a total rip-off. I was fooled by the cover, thinking this would feature alot of beautiful Playmates in kinky/girl-girl scenarios. Instead what you get is a cheap mish-mash of  cobbled-together outtakes that probably didn't make the cut for other  videos. Although Jennifer Rovero does appear in a somewhat-sexy  lesbian-themed vignette, it is pretty tame compared with your average  one-star Cinemax T&A movie. You get alot of ""stock"" music  that sounds like the cheap stuff you hear in commercials, and alot of  blink-and-you'll-miss-it editing. The back of the video lists appearances by  MANY Playmates, but don't be fooled-- most appear for about 10 seconds  apiece in a contrived internet/interactive sequence. Jami Ferrel appears  TWICE in the video, which isn't a good sign-- she seems to have it in her  contract to appear in EVERY VIDEO, and they just love to fill up space with  her. Nothing here is particularly ""erotic,"" unless you like  seeing Playmates standing around, rubbing their torsos, and trying to make  sexy facial expressions into the camera. (Which pretty much sums up any  Playboy video.) In the Jennifer Rovero sequence, which is mildly hot,  Jennifer rears her head back, bites her lip, and shuts her eyes in  ""ecstacy"" as the other girl pretends to go down on her. A few  seconds later, you see the EXACT SAME SHOT of Jennifer rearing her head  back. That's the kind of quality you get. One can only imagine what Playboy  could do if they actually put some money and effort into these videos!",958348800,9,1556,4.938223938223938
