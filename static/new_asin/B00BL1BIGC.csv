Great for kids as well, just like the original ""Wizard of Oz""",1462665600,,263,4.346938775510204

I really had no expectations when I saw this film. But when I saw it, I fell in love with it. Part prequel, part reboot set 20-25 years before the events of the wizard of oz. This is not the story Dorothy, but rather the story of the man or rather the con-man who would become known has the Wizard.
 James Franco plays a man named OZ, who starts out has a carnival magician, a womanizer, a shyster, a money hungry hustler who knows exactly what he is, but doesn't realize that deep down he has a heart of gold.
After fleeing his latest escapade by a hot air balloon, he soon flies into a fierce tornado driven storm that sucks him out of our world and into the land of Oz. where he soon meets a beautiful witch played by Mila Kunis, from her he learns of a prophecy foretold of a great wizard baring the name of their landOZ. Who would come and save them from a great evil. Hesitant at first until he smells a chance at great con.
As the film progresses he gains new friends but eventually realizes that his con of pretending to be a somebody like the wizard is far more dangerous to his existence than being a nobody.
Knowing that he himself is a fake he tries to run out. But with his new friends now in danger because of him, his conscience beckons and the goodness within him leads him to putting his skills of a con-man to good use, that helps him become the hero, to become OZ The Great And Powerful, the one foretold that the land of Oz so desperately needs.
The amazing performance by 11/12 year old Joey Lynn King as the China Doll is worth the watch. It will pull your heartstrings.
