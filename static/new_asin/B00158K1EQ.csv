The package quality is ok... for some reason the newer movie says ""Disc 2,"" but oh well.",1392249600,,250,4.122448979591836

3141904,4,B00158K1EQ,I liked both movies.  The original moves slow compared to newer movie pacing.  The quality of the DVDs were both high.  The original does surprisingly well with the apparatus the disintegrator/reintergrator and their is a lot of focus on the wife of the scientist.  The remake takes a different approach and is much more graphic.,1375056000,2,329,4.927272727272728

3141907,5,B00158K1EQ,"I simpley love both these movies, and this ""double take"" is the way to own them. this is because every other copy of the original i can find is bundled with the it's awful sequal, ""Return of the Fly"". the fact that this set lets me own not only the sequal free original, but the exelent remake as well make this easily the best purchase that anyone who does not already own these sci-fi masterpeices can get.",1261785600,10,408,4.311688311688312
3141908,4,B00158K1EQ,"I enjoy the original 1958 classic but I love the 1986 remake with Jeff Goldblum and Geena Davis. I don't always think the remakes are as good, but I think this one is actually a little better and it has now become a classic itself. Don't get me wrong I enjoy Vincent Price, but something about this remake was truly scarier. The characters are very believable. The original is almost comedic when you see the little human head on the fly. Of course it was quite scary when it was originally released. Perhaps that is why it is still fun to watch. If you enjoy SciFi horror like ""The Invisible Man"", you will probably enjoy this one. I highly recommend this two pack available with the original with Vincent Price and the remake with Jeff Goldblum. If you enjoyed this catch ""Darkman"" and ""Swamp Thing"". Excellent quality DVD with good replayability. - C. Luster",1213574400,8,861,4.597402597402597

8257874,4,B00158K1EQ,"I liked them both for different reasons. The 1958 version is more Sci-Fi/Drama while the 1986 remake is unapologetic Sci-Fi/Horror. I love Vincent Price's ability to bring a story to life with his usual cool downplayed manner. On the other hand, the gore-fest they have in the remake is just good down home fun. Good Eats.

8257877,5,B00158K1EQ,These two films are the best two copies of the Fly made to date.  I am usually disappointed with the production companies who toss high and low quality films into the same presentation and I am especially pleased that is not the case with this product.,1475539200,2,252,4.478260869565218
