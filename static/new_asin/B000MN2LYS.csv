It seems to follow the standard plot line for this type of film, two brothers who don't know they're brothers.  At one point they are adversaries, but upon discovering the truth, the one brother sacrifices himself for the other.  However, its the musical numbers which were the memorable part of the movie.  The songs were catchy and about the best I've heard from the number of ""Bollywood"" films I've seen.  I particularly enjoyed, for lack of a better term, the bird cage number where Rekha swings above the diners in the nightclub.",1225238400,,654,4.603448275862069
