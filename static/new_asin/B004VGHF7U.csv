8443352,4,B004VGHF7U,"I bought this on ebay because, even though I first found it on Amazon, $20 is an exhorbitant and completely unrealistic amount to charge for a dvd - and I don't want to hear what's the excuse.

I loved it.  I actually watched all 13 episodes (not an hour long each), in a single eight hour sitting.  It isn't exactly like the book, which is a strength.  I liked the portrayal of 19th century life.

The only thing I really didn't like, and it cost it a star, was that it took six episodes to even get going, and then came to a climax too quickly.  Also, the book really does a BETTER job of portraying 19th century life, partly by failing to get off on a long and strange digression where the boy works in the sewers underground for an insane man.  The home scene where all four characters share housing is more down home as well.",1508025600,,830,4.215189873417722

8443355,5,B004VGHF7U,"And in a good way!  Joan Aiken is one of my favorite authors, and MIDNIGHT IS A PLACE is a fine, classic British 70s telly adaptation.  The plot, true to Dickens form, concerns young adults pitted against the torment of adult villains and characters which challenge and foil them.  Set in the Industrial Revolutionary, fictitious town of Blastburn, Lucas and Ann-Marie struggle to keep alive, what with burning houses and deliberately dangerous machinery that could do them in at any moment.  There are some knowingly hammy, stock performances here, but considering the melodramatic and fantastical nature of Aiken's writing, that works fine.  Standout performances come from David Collings as the tutor Julian Oakapple, (who also sings the title song) and Lally Bowers as Lady Murgatroyd, a delightful character that comes across as a sort of fairy godmother to the story.  Those familiar with British character actors of this period will spot Avis Bunnage as the innkeeper Kezia Tetley, and Ron Moody as the mad Tom Gudgeon.",1318982400,,1026,5.150602409638554
8443356,4,B004VGHF7U,"VCI Entertainment presents ""MIDNIGHT IS A PLACE:COMPLETE SERIES"" (1977) (390 min/Color) -- Starring Simon Gipps-Kent, David Collings, Maxine Gordon, Erik Chitty, Lally Bowers, Donald Morley, Avis Bunnage, Reginald Marsh, Milton Johns & Jenny Tomasin

Produced and Directed by Christopher McMaster

Another winner from the British Invasion released by VCI.

An epic story of love, hardship, perseverance and triumph that takes place against the backdrop of working-class England during the Industrial Revolution. The lead characters battle for control of a carpet-pressing factory, while simultaneously struggling to make sense of their new post-modern landscape.

Joan Aiken and Roy Russell's writing is exceptional for the late 70s.

Faced with having to survive on the desolate streets of Blastburn the two still find time to solve the mystery of the blaze at the mansion and the dark secrets of Midnight Mill.

All in all, ""Midnight is a Place"" has a wonderful script with many twists and turns, that gives this series a sparkle of light as we glimpse into the darkest of places.

Special footnote: -- The best thing about this series is Lally Bowers plays the kindly old granny of one of the young leading characters, who once she realises this is her grand-daughter, does all she can to help and support both children.
