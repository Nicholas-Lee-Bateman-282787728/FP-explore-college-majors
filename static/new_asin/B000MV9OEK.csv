2750462,4,B000MV9OEK,"""MR. JIM"", another reviewer, indicates that these films are fully restored with digital dolby sound. Please do not purchase these films for that reason because it's not true. ""MR. JIM"" must front for V.C.I. ENTERTAINMENT because every Western or serial dvd that company releases has a 5 star rating for it posted by ""MR. JIM"",  insisting that the V.C.I. product is also fully restored with digital dolby sound. ""MR. JIM"" it seems has never seen a bad B-Western or serial that hasn't been fully restored with digital dolby sound no matter what company puts it out! We should all be so lucky!!!
Now I buy a lot of the V.C.I. product and they put out quality material, though it would be unfair to say that all of their releases have been given the full restoration treatment. So how can we accept ""MR, JIM"" 's evaluation of quality if he feels the same even about the ALPHA dvd product which is no more than whatever print they can find slapped onto a dvd, some excellent, many good, a lot very poor, none fully restored to any degree. His reviews have lead customers into buying something other than what they thought they were getting.
This particular Tim McCoy double bill is only so-so quality wise but still a good buy for fans of public domain B-Westerns. Both films star Tim as F.B.I. undercover agent Lightning Bill Carson. Bennie Corbett is his assistant/helper Magpie in both films, who, despite the corny name, is a pretty competent assistant. Both films were produced by the same company (VICTORY), and made by the same director (Sam Newfield) in 1939. Lots of the same cast members and locations were used for both films. Budget film making at it's best!
STRAIGHT SHOOTER is the worst of the two. Quality wise it's a much worn print, dark and fuzzy. The story involving missing bonds that were stolen then hidden on the deceased outlaw's ranch offers little thrills and too much talking and plotting. Ted Adams is fine as usual as the badguy and Julie Sheldon is spunky enough as the dead man's niece but it takes forever for things to get going and when they do nothing much happens.
The second film, TRIGGER FINGERS, is the real winner here and makes the dvd worth purchasing. A much nicer print, clear image with good sound.
Ted Adams is back again as a badguy but this time he has quality help from Carleton Young as the crooked sheriff and Ken Duncan as a cronie. Cattle rustling is the gimmick this time and Lightning Bill, Magpie and Bill's female assistant Maggie (lovely Joyce Bryant) all disguise themselves as gypsies in order to get the goods on the baddies which they somehow manage to do in one short afternoon. I just love it when Tim McCoy puts on a disguise and goes over the top in character! His Mexicans and gypsies are his best disguises and this performance rivals all others!
And to boot, Magpie and Maggie are gypsies too. Great stuff!
The Walker and Jauregui movie ranches were used in both films as ranch houses and hideouts. They can still be visited today and are part of the Placerita Canyon State Park about 25-30 miles north of Los Angeles. Lord knows, Tim McCoy, cast and crew certainly visited them enough times!",1260835200,,3156,4.645796064400716

These Westerns clearly weren't meant to be high art, just simplistic shoot-em-ups with cowboys and horses.  I wouldn't call this movie a B Western, more like an F Western.  The fist fight scene about half way through Trigger Fingers was pretty hysterical.  I'm not sure who these movies were aimed at.  They're pretty shallow.  I will watch the other DVD just for kicks.  Thankfully these two movies were less than an hour.  I couldn't have endured much more.  Also, the movies are old copies with imperfections.
