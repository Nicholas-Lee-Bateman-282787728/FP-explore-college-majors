8714384,5,B00WUKHZJM,"This thoughtful, intelligent, beautiful to look at and perfectly cast production is a must for anyone who loves Jancek. Runnicles' conducting is masterful and sublime.  If you are an opera lover conversant with mainly French and Italian repertoire, this is a perfect place to expand your horizons. This is a s good as opera on DVD gets! Video direction is wonderful...maybe this is better than it was in the opera house!",1455494400,,420,4.915492957746479
8714385,3,B00WUKHZJM,"This is one of my favorite operas.  The musical and acting values here are indeed quite strong, but I found the production ugly and wrong-headed.  The empty white room in which the entire opera takes place bleaches the life out every scene (the lighting is terrible), and is far too small to contain the many crowd scenes.  Also, everyone is dressed in suits and fifties-style dresses, yet these are supposed to be rural villagers.  A better production featuring Nine Stemme & Eva Marton is alas no longer available on DVD.",1445126400,3,523,4.777777777777778
8714386,5,B00WUKHZJM,"Christof Loy's strength as a director, as he demonstrates here to remarkable effect in the Deutsche Oper's production of Janek's Jenfa, is the depth of characterisation he brings to the drama. It's never an imposed reading, but one that can be found in the music itself - no more so than in Janek's extraordinary score for this work, one of the greatest operas of the 20th century.

The setting in Loy's productions might not always conform to the letter of the libretto, but he nonetheless invariably creates a strong environment for the characters to work in and reveal their inner lives. The tone is established from the outset in a silent scene that shows Kostelnicka brought into an interrogation room. Understanding Kostelnicka's motivations is important, but it has to be seen in the context of the village community in which the opera is set. For Loy all is needed is plain costumes and an austere white box with sliding panels that open up and close Jenfa off from the community outside. After a while however, you scacely notice the set, so effective is the more significant drama being played out in it.

The true impact of it all is only really noted by the time you get to the epilogue of Jenfa, surely one of the greatest moments of human feeling ever achieved in any opera. In order to reach that moment of near-transcendence, Loy first needs to show the full horror of what leads up to it. He manages to get to the real human tragedy of the story thought the misguided actions of Kostelnica and Laca, and that's helped considerably by two extraordinary performances in those roles. Jennifer Larmore is simply the best Kostelnicka I have ever come across. The scene where she resolves to remove the baby from the picture is chilling and credible, as is how she remains affected and weighted down later as a consequence of her actions. The singing is incredible, but there's also real personality and meaning given to the words and how they manifest in her actions.

Laca's role is a dual one that is rather more complex than the character's simplicity of expression would suggest, but all the contradictions and their implications are fully brought out in Loy's staging and in the performance by Will Hartmann. The depth of the tragedy that he has a major hand in setting into motion and the manner in which it is depicted however ensures that the sense of love, repentance, forgiveness and reconciliation that follows is even stronger. Hartmann not only captures that stupid blind, jealous rage of Laca, but also his sensitivity and the depths of his feelings for Jenfa, unconditionally defending her from the community outrage.

There's a danger that Jenfa herself could remain a passive figure in the opera with no ability to direct her own fortune, her own passions subject to the actions, whims and projections of others. Her beauty and the purity of her feelings is important however and that comes through intact, if inevitably scarred. Michaela Kaune isn't as strong an actor as Larman, but the expression of the essence of Jenfa is all there in her singing and performance and she clearly puts everything into the role.

Similar attention is applied even to secondary roles, but none of Loy's ideas or interpretations exist in isolation or are created out of nothing. All of this is there in the libretto and in the score itself and Donald Runnicles ensures that the precision of the rhythms and their emotional undercurrents all perfectly match the composer's intentions as well as what is happening on the stage.

On BD/DVD, Brian Large elects to cut out the audience applause between acts, allowing the force of the drama to playing the drama straight through, and it does make a significant impact, Loy's direction and the acting performances drawing you right in. There are no extra features on the BD50 disc, and the image and audio are reasonably good, but not exceptional. Subtitles (which can only be selected from remote or pop-up while playing) are in English, German, French, Spanish, Italian, Korean and Japanese.",1434931200,4,4050,4.86231884057971
