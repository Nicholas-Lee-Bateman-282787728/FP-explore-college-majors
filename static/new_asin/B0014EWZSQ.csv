8255433,5,B0014EWZSQ,"LOBBYIST is the fast-paced and thought-provoking series that takes its viewers into the world of the Korean Arms Lobbyists.  It also shows us a glimpse as to the challenges faced by illegal immigrants, who come to America.

Kim Joo Ho and Yoo So Young are childhood friends in a small Korean village.  So Young is fearless and defends Joo Ho from the school bullies.  He is captivated by her gutsiness and zest for life.  However, life forever changes for them when So Young's father discovers a submarine on the banks of their village.

Ultimately, both come to America and face unbelievable tragedies.  They Americanize themselves and become ""Harry"" and ""Maria.""  I believe that many foreigners think that America is a sort of utopia.  It is not and this series reveals this.  It shows that success is possible if you work hard in America - but it also shows the violence, alcoholism, domestic abuse, drugs, gangs and crime that are so prevalent in our society.

The acting is brilliant and the storyline is fresh.  Lee Hyun Woo and Nam Ji Hyun are great in their roles as the Joo Ho and So Young featured as children.  Song II Gook and Jang Jin Young are superb as the title characters.  It is amazing to see the transformation in appearance that Maria and Harry go through in this series, as they age and gain in sophistication.  Yoo Sun, who stars as Maria's sister, Eva, is also very good.  Kim Mi Sook and Hu Joon Ho absolutely shine as Madame Chae and James Lee, Maria's mentor.

One of the best scenes in the movie is when Harry and Maria are dancing the tango.  They were MAGNIFICENT!!!

LOBBYIST is filled with action and realism, but much of that reality is very harsh.  It shows that both Harry and Maria are willing to do absolutely anything to succeed - not matter what it may cost them morally or ethically.  Having said that, they each do manage to maintain a fierce loyalty to protect one another.

If I had one criticism, I believe that it would entail the fact that Harry keeps his identity a secret from Maria for so long.  The only reason that I could fathom for this is that he meets her at a time when he is very ashamed of the circumstances that is working under.

There are 24 hour-long episodes with English subtitles in this series.  Much of it is filmed in the United States and English is spoken in many of the scenes.  LOBBYIST is not a ""cute"" movie, but rather one of the best action thrillers produced - and that includes English and American films.  You absolutely cannot go wrong watching this, but I believe that it is suited for more mature audiences rather than some of the lighter Korean dramas that are typically offered.",1323907200,2,2661,4.5473684210526315
8255434,5,B0014EWZSQ,"Korean with English/Chinese subtitles. Good story line. The actors are
excellent.  Finally a Korean story without a tragic and sad ending.
My whole family enjoyed it greatly.",1208649600,5,174,5.444444444444445
