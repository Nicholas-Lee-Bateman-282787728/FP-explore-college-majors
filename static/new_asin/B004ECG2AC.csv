8426689,5,B004ECG2AC,"I've been rolling for about five years now and in that time I've amassed a pretty large collection of BJJ DVD's. I've been focusing on guard passing lately and figured I'd give Chris Brennan a shot. I was really impressed with this DVD, so impressed that I actually ordered his sweeps, kimura, and guillotines DVD's. The quality and level of instruction on this DVD is very high. It focuses entirely on guard passing until you get to the few bonus techniques at the end. Most of the passes are pretty basic and I had seen most of them at one time or another. That being said, I feel too many grappling DVD's focus on exotic techniques that aren't very practical and don't work well against upper level opponents. The more black belts and upper level grapplers I roll with, the more I realize that most of them stick to the basics. They just execute them really well. With that in mind, I feel this DVD will really help my guard passing. Chris stresses the little nuances that make a difference between an effective completed pass and the waste of energy that is a failed pass. He also answered many of my questions just as they were popping into my head. He addresses common reactions for the guy on bottom and how to avoid getting swept during the pass. Overall, this is an excellent DVD, and I was impressed with Brennan's open, no nonsense approach. This would be a good DVD for someone just starting out as well as the more experienced grappler that is looking to try and seal up some holes in his passing game. If you like the knee through pass you will probably like his style of passing. Just don't expect to see any flashy new passes. Most of these are the basic passes that work and you can tell that Chris is showing what he actually uses. If you want to see Chris roll, youtube ""Chris Brennan and Bill Cooper"" to see their fight at the Never Tap tournament.",1294012800,,1868,4.448979591836735
