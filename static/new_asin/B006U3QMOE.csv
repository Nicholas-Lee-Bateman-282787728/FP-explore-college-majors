5019522,5,B006U3QMOE,"This new franchise of 'Tokyo Erotique' from Cinema Epoch is quickly becoming the benchmark for Asian soft core exploitation. The first two volumes of 'Tokyo Train Girls' are destined to become classics, and should be required viewing for all cult enthusiasts and sleazehounds alike.

The first volume, 'Private Lessons', opens with a 23 year-old teacher setting up a online webcam chat room to help pay off debts accrued while partying and getting her teaching degree. She flashes herself, paying special attention to her natural ample breasts (she'd be suitable in an early Russ Meyer film before he started using surgically enhanced side-show freaks during the 70's), coaxing and teasing her fan base seductively.

She teaches a class of underachieving seniors, but if I had teachers who looked and dressed like that, I'd have never learned a damned thing either. The female lead has long legs, wears tight skirts and is capable of keeping our attention. Little does she know that one of her pupils has ID'ed her by a necklace that she wears to class, and has become sexually fixated with her. A new twist on the 'Hot For Teacher' theme. Bravo.

Now we come to the staple in this series, the mandatory train molestation scenes, which bring a new element to our deviant enjoyment. Who rides public transportation daily and hasn't had a similar thought at one time or another? (Naturally, we don't succumb to these urges so we avoid jail time as well as getting molested ourselves while in jail...). But I digress - these train gropings are some of the high points of the series, long and licentious, a pervert's paradise, a Garden of Eden for the fondler's edification and enlightenment. This is one of those times when low-budget shot-on-video works remarkably well, literally bringing us into each frame of celluloid filth. Hallelujah.

Another staple in the series is the fly-on-the-wall shower scenes that make you envious of soap. Seeing the actresses all lathered up for our amusement is one of life's simple pleasures indeed. It should be noted that are twice as many sex scenes in these flicks than in any other series I've seen, and I'm both proud and ashamed to admit how many those are, and the scenes are lengthy and realistic for soft-core erotica, and among the best you'll find anywhere. The keywords 'Abundant Female Nudity' don't even begin to describe the flesh-feast here. No joke.

I won't give more of the details away, but I will highly recommend the first two volumes in this series to all of my brethren who found themselves here reading this - the third volume was weakest of the four, and the fourth was good as well. Read my reviews for all four volumes for details. All aboard!!!",1281744000,79,2708,4.865509761388286

5019533,3,B006U3QMOE,"The title is a bit misleading. It sounds like a popular Japanese genre where girls get 'assaulted' on buses or trains. There is three scenes of the star, Megu Fujiura (a Japanese porn or AV (adult video) star) getting groped on the train. They are more of after thoughts to the story.
Megu is a school teacher doing a web cam show to make money to pay her own school bills. One of her students - a loner that gets beat up by bullies - sees her web show and recognizes her necklace. (She supposedly never shows her face on her web show, but when we see the show she does kind of.) He takes advantage of his knowledge.
There is a lot of genital rubbing, but always with panties or shorts on. They come off for the sex scenes, but we don't see anything. Megu as others have noted is very well endowed and her breasts get a lot of action. I think there was one brief shot of Megu pantyless, but I've seen heavier stuff on cable softcore.
There is a slide show that's pretty worthless, about 35 seconds long. Also this is in Japanese with English subtitles that you have to turn on.
If you like big breasted Japanese women check it out. Otherwise there is a lot of better stuff out there.",1370304000,8,1183,4.238938053097345
5019534,3,B006U3QMOE,"This is middle of the road softcore fare. The afore-mentioned train girl was cute enough and endowed enough to keep my attention, but the action (groping and general sexual reluctance of the female lead) flames out before really getting hot.",1365984000,,241,5.05

5019539,2,B006U3QMOE,"If we were to look at the depiction of grouping on the Japanese subways in a film like Groper Train 2: Wedding Capriccio and compare it to Tokyo Train Girls 1: Private lessons, you'd walk away from very similar events with very different feelings. GT2 takes place in a more cartoonish universe where the sexual attention doesn't seem unwanted (when it's noticed at all). This isn't realistic but it allows the viewer a certain distance- it's more clearly taking place in a fantasy realm. TTG1, on the other hand, isn't as fanciful, and the harassment, while I would never say it's realistic, can't be as readily dismissed as part of the film's conceit. We actually get a few understated scenes where the main character demonstrates how dirty this harassment makes her feel, the film then attempts to make this sexy by showing how the main character's got a somewhat ambivalent attitude towards it, occasionally turning assault into seemingly somewhat consensual encounters. This sends the disturbing message to the viewer that no doesn't always mean no even when said repeatedly and earnestly.

Now, it's a dumb movie and some may say that I'm taking it too seriously, but it's tough to enjoy the admittedly very sexy Megu Fujiura when half the scenes make you wonder if Japan ever had a woman's lib movement.",1352592000,5,1309,4.896396396396397
5019540,5,B006U3QMOE,"4-Legged Defender wrote a far better review than I can do here, but his remarks about this unusual video are dead on the mark.

For starters, the female lead is built. That is, B-U-I-L-T with capital letters. Megu Fujiura has the sort of figure you wouldn't expect to see on a young Asian girl. Imagine a Japanese version of Dolly Parton. She is such a beauty! In the story, she is a teacher who has accumulated a lot of debt for her education, and to help pay it off, she moonlights as an erotic 'chat girl' on-line. A special necklace, which Megu likes to wear to class where she teaches, she also wears during her sexy 'chat' shows on the web. A student spots the necklace on one of her web shows and identifies her as his sexy teacher.

It's basically every teenage boy's fantasy, with a little sadism thrown in, Japanese-style. The boy reveals his secret to his teacher and basically tries to blackmail her, and no, it's not money he's interested in. The molestation scenes seem to have been added as the 'icing' on an already very kinky 'cake'. Megu rides the train to and from class, and the molestation is both disturbing and erotic at the same time. Very rarely do scenes from a film affect me this strangely. The 'good' side of my brain felt sorry for Megu...I wanted to run to her aid, to beat the crap out of the sick perv molesting her. But the 'bad' side of my brain was perfectly content to sit and enjoy the show, especially after realizing that Megu, despite her weak protests, is obviously enjoying the phantom fondling.

Don't know what more I can say. Nobody, but NOBODY does erotic films quite like the Japanese. It's so very difficult to pin it down to a few words, but they have a certain quality that's hard to describe. If you're looking for 'spread eagle', Hustler-type spreads, forget it. You won't see that here, or most other Japanese films for that matter. Some folks like it, many do not. If you're unsure, then Tokyo Train Girls 1: Private Lessons would be a good way to find out.",1345420800,17,2012,4.476839237057221
5019541,3,B006U3QMOE,"Following a brief intro by the film's lead actress, Megu Fujiura, wherein she assures us that: ""she did her best"" to entertain us - ""Tokyo Train Girls:1 - Private Lessons"" wastes no time in presenting the opening titular fantasy scenario of the 'Groper Train' genre - girlz getting felt up by horny guys - during the ultra crowded commuter train rides that many Japanese workers must endure on a daily basis.

After the 'essential' initial 'grope' sequence is over - the, thread-bare, plot focuses on the 'difficulties' faced by cute young female high-school teacher 'Chihiro' when her 'after hours' job as a web  'chat girl' is discovered by one of her porn hound students.  He initially sorta coerces his pulchritudinous prof into having sex with him but,  when he discovers that the reason his teacher is moonlighting on an internet porn site is to re-pay her own school debts, he becomes increasingly chivalrous in his attitude towards her, his generous sincerity melts Chihiro's 'defences', and their inappropriate! 'relationship' blossoms.

These current 'groper train' flix (this one was originally released in 2009) are shot in hi def video format which give a sense of graphic reality to the features, but they lack a little of the gritty ambience that shot on film features possess.  The 'production values' are clean but sparse - I noted a couple of 'sets' (like the lavatory scene) and pieces of furniture used in multiple films.  The 'sex' in this installment of the franchise is really soft core.  There is a brief 'fantasy' sequence where the infatuated 'student' (Ishii)  day-dreams about being pleasured by a dominatrix but, otherwise, its all pretty basic 'simulated' humping fare. Lead actress Megu has a very nice pair of breasts and they get a lot of screen time and she IS pretty cute - which, ultimately, is basically what this flk offers.  Personally, despite the crystal clear digital look of it all, I found the total viewing experience less intriguing than the older 'Groper Train' products that have been previously made available for Western viewers. Regardless of the fact that there is, perhaps, more physical time devoted to sex scenes & nudity it all seems a little mundane.  No full frontal nakedness in any of these flix (but also no 'fogging') - the usual short Pinku 75 min run time - and only a few 'stills' from the production as 'extras'.  Those who enjoy well developed & un-dressed Japanese maidens may find much to ogle here but I wish there was a little more substance and style to this recent offering of 'commuter train' based smut.",1341360000,15,2578,4.914746543778802

The first two volumes of 'Tokyo Train Girls' are destined to become classics, and should be required viewing for all cult enthusiasts and sleazehounds alike.
