7926305,4,B00004XQN0,"This foreign film was really not bad.  Set in Canada, the movie was about a young teenage girl, Hannah, who was questioning her sexuality and living with an over-worked mother and somewhat absent father.  Hannah is always going to the movies to see a certain film, ""Vivre se Vi"", about a classy prostitute.  The prostitute is Hannah's idol.  Later on, Hannah's mother has a nervous break down, so Hannah and her brother run away, where she tests out being a prostitute for one night.  This movie was pretty good, I am beggining to be a fan of Lea Pool's films.  You should go rent it, if you don't mind subtitles.",1026345600,,613,4.527272727272727
7926306,5,B00004XQN0,"In a word, this movie was stunning. All of the performances were great, and the best part was the ending, which gave the film a redeeming quality. It's a must-see.",1017532800,2,163,4.466666666666667
7926307,2,B00004XQN0,"the heroine's search for a personal identity takes the form of striking between opposites - girl/boy, mother/father, film/reality, country/city, Judaism/Christianity, conformity/individuality.  This is a rites-of-passage movie as Portrait of the Filmmaker as a Young Woman, with Hanna taking inspiration from the like-sounding Anna in 'Vivre Sa Vie' (and who was also inspired by a great film), while storing up, Wordsworth-like, artistic inspiration from Godard.  Pool's hackneyed filmmaking puts Godard's masterpiece in relief, and makes it seem even more miraculous.",982713600,,569,6.189873417721519
7926308,5,B00004XQN0,"""Set Me Free"", as Lea Pool's ""Emporte-moi"" has had to be retitled for the benefit of illiterate Americans, is a restrained, beautiful and touching movie.  It focuses on Hanna, the teenage daughter of an unhappy working-class couple (expatriate Jewish poet and beautiful Catholic prom queen) living in Montreal in the 1960s.  Wandering into a cinema one day, Hanna develops a fixation on Godard's ""Vivre sa vie"" and models much of her appearance and behaviour on Anna Karina's doomed but glamorously imperturbable Nana.  Her only friend is the more upper-class Laura, on whom she seems to have (or does she?) something of a crush, but who in return fancies Hanna's older brother Paul.  Meanwhile, the creepy baker seldom misses an opportunity to grope her, and her troubled dad isn't averse to giving her a smack in the face now and then.  Well, events roll quietly on, Hanna's mother suffers a breakdown, she and her brother run away from home to Laura's house, Hanna sneaks off to visit her mother and then tries her luck as a prostitute, with unhappy results, especially as she's only 13.  But this is not a cautionary tale, nor is it a crime story.  It has strong autobiographical elements; Hanna begins to find some potential for hope in her situation when her kindly teacher lends her a cine camera.
""Mouchette"" this isn't - Hanna may be poor and suffering from lovelessness and a crumbling family, but her father's touching attempts to make contact with her, by giving her a copy of the diary of Anne Frank and cooking her well-balanced meals, are positive signs.  Likewise, Karine Vanasse as the teenaged heroine is not as vengeful and damaged as Nadine Nortier's Mouchette.  Vanasse has a rather funny, v-shaped face, with a defiant tilt to her chin and a nice line in Anna Karina impersonations.  She's yet another young French actress gifted with seemingly effortless command over her emotions, even if she spends much of the film in a reticent deadpan that is less the Bressonian mask of despair than a blank slate on which any possibility could be inscribed.  The rest of the cast are equally good.
""Emporte-moi"", as I'm going to persist in calling it, is a lovely film, with a cool soundtrack of classical music and cheesy French rock'n'roll.  (Vanasse sings a song over the closing credits with amusingly off-key sincerity.)  Francophone Canada can turn out quiet masterpieces when it wants to, and this is the latest.",973555200,15,2432,4.888077858880779
