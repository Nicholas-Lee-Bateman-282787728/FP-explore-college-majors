3645304,4,B001HY3B40,"The guy who killed the ace of spades... declared dead by the president's man
on national TV, comes home to a less than hero's welcome?
What does this hero know that is so dangerous to those in power?
He only wants the money he was promised and to live.
He is telling no stories or converting no lies.
It is confusing... who are the real bad guys?
The guys in the black hats or the ones in the white hats?
Maybe we get to find out... The acting is good
and the streets are a danger in D.C.",1226448000,5,488,3.989795918367347

3645318,1,B001HY3B40,"Worst movie ever.  This is the only movie that I had to stop watch before it ended.  There is nothing good I can say.  Just when you didn't think it could get worse, it did.  The chewing the gum during clearing a room - LOL.  Worst scene in film.  I think college students could have put something better together in a film class.  Now I worry when I see Cuba films.  What was that guy thinking?",1421539200,,395,4.105263157894737

3645325,2,B001HY3B40,This movie is ok. It's not what I expected at all. The plot seems to be slowly drawn together to bring  about a surprised ending that didn't help the suspense build up.,1406851200,,168,4.25

3645328,1,B001HY3B40,"Has been actor who can't find a job anymore is offered a paycheck. Cuba didn't want to eat beans and bread for dinner again so he agreed to let the bitter left leaning conspiracy theorist down the street cast him. Cuba loaned Liberal Larry a home movie camera and it was a go. Cuba watched the neighborhood kids playing paintball to research military tactics, watched some cspan to get the action just right, and hired their kids friends parents to play the rest of the actors After that, BAM they made themselves a political/war movie. Now Cuba is is earning a paycheck, able to afford some Captain D's, and working on the sequel. Cuba doesn't turn down any role as long as you ""show him the money""!",1405814400,,700,4.519685039370079
3645329,1,B001HY3B40,"I knew when I started this movie that it didn't have great review.  But the synopsis was interesting enough to give it a go...

Gooding's performance was good.  Not outstanding, but at least good.  I think he did the best he could with the material provided.

The bright spot in my opinion was the supporting role Clarence Williams III played.  I will be looking for him in other flicks.

The story itself was a wandering mess.  Even now I can't connect the dots.  Some writers intentionally put things together to make us work a little to follow the story.  I appreciate that, and I've seen films that were very memorable because ""I figured it out"".  This movie (and it's writer) took the convoluted route to such a degree that it's impossible to follow the story.  Every ten or fifteen minutes I found myself wondering ""how did he get HERE?"", or ""why did THAT happen?"".

If you don't have a good story to tell, it doesn't matter how good the acting or production is.  ""Way of War"" is a prime example.",1405641600,,1002,4.4944444444444445
3645330,1,B001HY3B40,Simply put - Boring... horrible horrible movie.,1405296000,,47,5.857142857142857
3645331,3,B001HY3B40,Not a bad film. Enjoyed it but nothing outstanding that makes you want to shout to all your family and friends.,1405296000,,111,4.333333333333333
3645332,5,B001HY3B40,"Exciting movie; suspense, action, etc.  A good watch.",1404864000,,53,5.625
3645333,2,B001HY3B40,Fair. A little confusing. Connection ended 3/4 way through the film,1404864000,,67,5.181818181818182
3645334,1,B001HY3B40,I can not state enough how terrible this movie is. To say more is waist of time. It's bad on every level period. If I could give it negative  stars I would. Please don't waist time watching this horrible movie.,1404777600,,210,4.25
3645335,3,B001HY3B40,It was ok. It just didn't grab me like most drama/suspense movies normally do.,1404604800,,78,4.642857142857143
3645336,3,B001HY3B40,"There are some serious holes in the movie. Given the current state or perpetual state of the Middle East the movie has greater merits than the holes. With a small budget, this movie works for me!",1404432000,,195,4.444444444444445
3645337,2,B001HY3B40,"l didn't like this movie. l found it very slow moving and very boring. Cuba Gooding,jr has been in some good movies but this isn't one of them.",1404432000,,143,4.142857142857143
3645338,1,B001HY3B40,"This felt like an incomplete test viewing.  Plot was choppy, editing was minimal, etc.
An unequivocal waste of 90 minutes.",1404172800,,122,5.1
3645339,1,B001HY3B40,It was really nice to see Cuba Gooding Jr. and Lance Reddick give back to their local community and work on this terrible student film that had absolutely nothing going for it.,1404000000,,176,4.53125
3645340,4,B001HY3B40,Cuba Gooding is a great actor. The plot is not that good but the action is.  I prefer Gooding in other roles. He can be very funny. Overall the movie was good.,1404000000,,159,3.96875
3645341,2,B001HY3B40,Predictable- the storyline was marginal. The acting wooden. Some scenes not at all realistic. I was glad the movie is free.,1403913600,,123,4.904761904761905
3645342,1,B001HY3B40,What a piece of crap. Slow disjointed pretentious crap.,1403654400,,55,5.222222222222222
3645343,2,B001HY3B40,very slow moving movie. would not watch again. expected a better movie from Cuba Gooding jr. he is a very good actor and this was not even close to his best work.,1403308800,,162,4.09375
3645344,5,B001HY3B40,well put together. enjoyed watching it. found it gripping to watch. kept my attention the entire time i was watching,1402963200,,116,4.85
3645345,2,B001HY3B40,"it's jumpy and disconnected.  I like Cuba Gooding Jr., the man has talent but this wasn't his finest piece of work",1402704000,,114,4.428571428571429
3645346,1,B001HY3B40,This was one of the top 5 worst movies I have seen thus far. What the hell is wrong with Cuba Gooding Jr? Himself and the movies he plays in are getting worse. I say skip this movie for certain.,1401840000,,194,3.875
3645347,1,B001HY3B40,"I chose this movie because Cuba Gooding was in the movie and he is a great actor.

What a huge disappointment this movie was.  Just simply boring.  I kept wondering what was going on.  No plot development, no anything, just meandering...",1401494400,,237,4.7073170731707314
3645348,4,B001HY3B40,It's not the greatest action film. But it's very good. I'd recommend it to anyone interested in action with some conspiracy mixed in.,1401062400,,133,4.826086956521739

3645350,4,B001HY3B40,"Cuba Gooding Jr. plays good parts in most movies he's in and this is no different. Amazon plays the movie nice and clear. Great definition. If you like war flicks with a premise you can actually follow. Check this one out, great way to spend a rainy evening.",1400544000,,258,4.395833333333333
3645351,5,B001HY3B40,One of the best Cuba Gooding movies ever! A completely different side of Cuba! loved every minute of it! Spectacular!,1400112000,,117,4.9
3645352,2,B001HY3B40,I have never seen a movie that lost me so completely.  The story line goes all over the place and it is hard to get an idea what is happening.  Not very realistic.,1400025600,,163,3.909090909090909
3645353,3,B001HY3B40,I found the movie to not be what it seemed to be.  Not quite as  graphic or realistic as i expected.,1399852800,,100,3.7142857142857144
3645354,2,B001HY3B40,Could have been better directed. The concept was a bit confusing. But Cuba Gooding acting was good. Overall the picture was alright.,1399766400,,132,5.045454545454546
3645355,2,B001HY3B40,This movie was slow to get going and just did not hold my interest. Ok if you're a fan of Cuba Gooding.,1399334400,,103,3.727272727272727
3645356,3,B001HY3B40,Plot was ok and the acting was ok as well. I don't think he will get a little gold man over this movie....,1398816000,,106,3.652173913043478
3645357,1,B001HY3B40,"I like Cuba Gooding Jr., and that's why I chose this movie.  However, the script is trite, ""sophomoric"" as one reviewer noted.  The timeline bounces around and leaves holes in the ""plot"".  There's no emotional hook, no reason to care about any of these characters.  And, it's one of these movies that doesn't really have an ending!  And yet, I was very glad it was over.  What a waste of time.",1398470400,,393,4.464788732394366
3645358,1,B001HY3B40,Store line hard to follow watched maybe 20 minutes hoping it would get better but just gave up and turned it off,1398297600,,112,4.136363636363637
3645359,3,B001HY3B40,"Cuba Gooding Jr. is the main reason I watched this movie. He's one of the best actors in the business or I can say he's one of my favorite for sure. It's an unusual plot but keeps you interested for the length of the film. Most action films Cuba stars in have a plot that keeps you thinking about what's going on and this is one of them.

Recommended to those who like a slow action film.",1397606400,,388,4.038961038961039
3645360,2,B001HY3B40,Waste of good Talent Cuba needs to be ashamed of this video!  Weak story line Lance Reddick needs to be ashamed too.,1397606400,,116,4.2727272727272725
3645361,4,B001HY3B40,"Subject matter was interesting.  Acting was Good.  Gooding carries the entire movie.  His fellow actors
struggled at times with script.  Try it....",1397433600,,147,5.545454545454546
3645362,3,B001HY3B40,This story centers around the main character but does not develop the story well in my opinion.  The director incorporates several flashbacks that don't make much sense to the main story line until the the end of the movie and then so much has passed in the main story that it almost feels as an unwanted diversion.  Its not a bad view overall and especially if you like Cuba Gooding Jr.,1397433600,,387,4.436619718309859
3645363,1,B001HY3B40,complete waste of time.... Very poorly made with total s*** for a story-line/script... to say EXTREMELY low budget would be an understatement.... Very surprised that Cuba Gooding Jr. would resort to this caliber of low budget crap....,1397347200,,234,5.351351351351352
3645364,1,B001HY3B40,"I really enjoyed gooding's various roles in the past and wanted to like this movie.  I am not a paid critic, but I know what I like and this was not anything I would want to spend more than five minutes on.",1397088000,,206,3.9047619047619047
3645365,1,B001HY3B40,"Don't waste your time and money on this movie.  If there is one movie that needs to be burned and tossed in the garbage, this is it.
Cuba Godding is good actor, however, the director and producers of this movie should be shot at dawn!  The whole story line is weak.",1397001600,,265,4.176470588235294
3645366,3,B001HY3B40,"An OK movie. A little hard to follow what is happening. Cuba was good in his part. Some scenes pretty dark, hard to follow.",1396051200,,123,4.166666666666667
3645367,1,B001HY3B40,"Shame on Cuba Gooding, a good actor, for trying to save this BORING disjointed and confusing movie.  ALSO - music volume way too loud and conversation volume way too low.",1395446400,,170,4.666666666666667
3645368,2,B001HY3B40,"slow paced story, Cuba Gooding have a great role. Story that could have been told in a different manner would have being a more exciting story.",1395446400,,143,4.538461538461538
3645369,1,B001HY3B40,"I picked this film to rent because the description sounded interesting and it had a high rating.  Unfortunately, the plot was so disjointed that it was never clear exactly what was going on.  You never really understood why the main character was doing what he was doing or why he was after the guys he was after.  You get a vague sense of these government cronies killed his girlfriend and stole his money but it is never real clear as to why.  The flashback scenes fill in a few details but not enough and you never really understand who his buddies were or what their part in the plot is.

Beyond the weak plot, the acting is sub par and the effects only moderately interesting.  All-in-all, not a very good film.  I am glad it was part of Amazon prime, because I would have been upset if I had actually paid money to rent this film.",1395100800,,836,4.32051282051282
3645370,3,B001HY3B40,"It's a good and crappy movie at the same time. Cuba Gooding Jr. did a good job of making me believe his character, though it seems to be a re-hash of too recent Mark Wahlberg characters in similar type movies.  Also,.. If they were going to make a ""Fight Club"" reference in the film, it could have gotten on with it sooner.
  I only gave it 3 stars because I thought a LOT more could have been done with what they had to work with.",1395014400,,431,4.047058823529412
3645371,3,B001HY3B40,Great acting but flashbacks confused the story line making it difficult to follow.  Might have to watch it again to follow what happened.,1394928000,,137,4.956521739130435

3645374,2,B001HY3B40,This movie moves very slow and is hard to follow.  Cuba Gooding's other work is the only reason we watched this.,1393286400,,112,4.333333333333333
3645375,1,B001HY3B40,I have liked all the other movies Cuba Gooding has been in.  This would be the exception to the rule!  Wasn't even able to finish the movie it was so boring.,1393286400,,157,4.032258064516129
3645376,2,B001HY3B40,"The movie quality itself was okay, filmed in a gritty, one-step-up from hand-held camera; the problem is the cut into the various flashback scenes had little to no continuity and I had trouble understanding why people would stop shooting just because they hit one person.",1393200000,,271,5.044444444444444

3645380,3,B001HY3B40,Cuba is a great actor but this movie just doesn't flow. I watched it because of Cuba and that is the only reason I'm giving it 3 stars other wise I'd give it a 1.,1391472000,,162,3.657142857142857
3645381,1,B001HY3B40,Bad editing made the story hard to follow. Poor military tactics put the last nail in the coffin. Acting was good. It is just another great movie that died on the edit room floor.,1391299200,,179,4.294117647058823

The idea and story were sound I did not notice half of what all of the other reviewers are talking about. I love those arm chair cowboys that think they wrote the book on clearing a building/room yet they would find it funny that real life isn't that way. Yes you can tape house a building but wars are fought on less intel than books and photo's.  The story could be looked at from a political/philisophical/Moral/Ethical prospective. I would not watch this movie to do that because the story could be lost in the mind game that you could play with yourself thinking about it. That America must engineer bad to have good.  Many people believe that government soldiers or mercenaries have lots of logistical support people forget that bullets are carried by men. Every gun fight is suppose to be a tommy gun with thousands of rounds. The liberty of the budget and the dedication to telling a story not a special effects blitz. It made it's points and did so in a smooth fashion. Violence was quick and points were made. No horror movie fluff and no tarintino sprinkler blood. The reason for this was so that the story could have focus by the audience not fixation on action even though some could call it a thinker flix I would call it enjoyable. I would place this in a watch list with A few good men, Southern Comfort, The Edge, and the Hurt locker just to name a few movies with thicker thinking opportunities.

3645428,3,B001HY3B40,"John Carter's 2009 drama, ""Way of War"" was marketed about as badly as a film could be, when it was released, touted as an 'action/revenge' movie along the lines of ""First Blood"" and ""Shooter"". When audiences discovered that it was actually a rather heavy, often confusing drama of a man gradually losing his humanity as everything he loves and believes in is stripped away from him, they avoided the film in droves. While the DVD has been promoted along the same lines, at least you now have the opportunity to savor the terrific performances of J.K. Simmons, Clarence Williams III, and especially Cuba Gooding Jr., who gives one of his least gimmicky, most heart-felt performances in the lead.

I've always admired Gooding, whose career was nearly derailed when he won the 'Supporting Actor' Oscar for ""Jerry Maguire"", at 28. With his boyish demeanor and voice, and his boundless energy, he was quickly 'typed' into silly roles that damaged his credibility as a serious actor. His better dramatic work was often ignored, or wound up being 'direct to video'. Surprisingly, ""Way of War"" didn't suffer that fate (as it really isn't that good), but at 41, Gooding's youthful features have hardened, and the pain and years have given him a dramatic credence that makes his character 'work'. As a career soldier assigned to Covert Ops, his training and beliefs are shattered when his friends are lost, and he discovers the corruption behind his last mission. Twisted in silent pain and rage, he first demands money for his part of the operation, then, when the woman he loves is executed, and he is 'leashed' and targeted for assassination (as a false story of the mission is publicized), he hardens into a self-appointed tool of justice, the living embodiment of Sun Tzu's ""The Art of War"". It is a challenging role, and Gooding carries it off very well.

Sadly, the film doesn't measure up as well as his performance. Frequent flashbacks not only interrupt the dramatic continuity, but confuse the storyline, as well, and the few 'action' scenes lack credibility (the final mission, in particular, is so poorly conceived that you'll wonder how we ever lasted this long in the Middle East). The finale offers little in the way of closure, and even implies that an unwelcome sequel might be made. Whether the blame should fall on Carter's direction, or his muddy screenplay (with Scott Schafer), the film simply doesn't work.

""Way of War"" makes a better rental than addition to your DVD collection, but, hopefully, it will remind the industry that Cuba Gooding is ready for better roles!",1260835200,,2583,4.919724770642202

3645435,1,B001HY3B40,"This movie is a cheap attempt to cash in on the public's dislike for our former president. It's got almost no coherent plot line and the action scenes are just stupid. Furthermore, the ending is horrible and leaves the viewer wondering what happened to the rest of the movie.

The basic plot is that paramilitary operative David Wolfe uncovers a plot between Osama Bin Laden and the U.S. government to keep him alive because the government needs ""enemies"" to create heroes.

The problem is, that ""message"" is all there is to this movie. Without the information on the back of the DVD case I could have never figured out who Gooding's character worked for, and it's still never made clear if he's working on behalf of the U.S. government or if there are rogue elements in the government who hatched this plot to keep Bin Laden alive.

The action scenes which are supposed to take place in Pakistan are also simply stupid. They don't clear a room in any way that's believable for anybody who's even just watched it done in other movies. The other action scenes that take place in DC are also done horribly. Characters die, sometimes in violent ways, and there's no real reason given for it.

If a director and screen writer want to make a movie that alleges the U.S. government is involved in some sort of conspiracy, at least make it believable. This one isn't. I guess Cuba Gooding Jr. needed the cash because I can't see any reason why he should have liked this script, it's awful.",1241481600,19,1482,4.6022727272727275

3645437,2,B001HY3B40,"Firstly, let me state this film will definitely not engage viewers who are used to a fast-paced ""Rambo"" style adrenaline rush; it will not make sense to those with a slow attention span; Nor equally, does it fall in the linear 'Dick & Jane' format. That said, the story is quite simple: Three U.S. military Special Operators are sent to North Pakistan to take out a high ranking Taliban leader. What Gooding Jr. discovers while there, is the premise of the movie. The movie flips back and forth from history to present. I've seen better, but as a vet I think the movie provides some intrigue and isn't all that bad, really.

If you rent the movie stay focused and pay attention or you'll miss the plot (which apparently from the lack luster reviews I've read, seems common). The only things I found hard to engage about this movie, is that the Operatives wear traditional hard-healed G.I. boots (not the softer '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Men-s-Hi-Tec-Magnum-Amazon-4-Boots/dp/B000233QDI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Men's Hi - Tec Magnum Amazon 4 Boots</a>' worn by Spec Ops in Iraq & Afghanistan); and the fact that they aren't wearing more body (chest) armor. I think had this movie come out in say 2004, or 2005 it would have been more controversial. But in 2008, it's conspiracy premise is somewhat old news.
All in all, I think they could have spent an extra hour adding more depth, allowing the story to be built to a level it demanded. Had that been the case, this could have been an excellent movie.",1240099200,3,1549,5.027237354085603

3645439,1,B001HY3B40,"I selected 1 star, only so that nobody would think that I'd forgotten to select an overall rating.  But it really deserves zero stars.

This movie is awful.  I'm a fan of Cuba Gooding, and that's the reason I decided to rent it even though there are no reviews on the box (not even from obscure critics).

The plot is a joke (more on that next paragraph), there's no action (don't be fooled by the cover), there are no special effects, there's nothing worth seeing.  The dialogue is sophomoric, the acting is way below average, and the directing/editing are what you'd expect from a first-year film student at a bad film school.  In fact the whole thing seems like something a few kids put together borrowing their dad's video camera and taking $400 out of their college funds to budget to film.

The plot consists of Gooding, a special operative, who has flash-backs to a recent mission, where his job was to apparently sit in a brightly lighted gymnasium in combat gear with two other operatives (one of them JK Simmons of Spider Man, Lady Killers and Juno fame) and discuss war cliches.  Lots of flashbacks to this.  Then two of them get shot without even so much as a muzzle-flash or blood stain, just a pop and they slump over.  Then in-between flashbacks, federal agents are trying to kill Gooding -- for no good reasons except some embarrassment over the mission, which is not explained --  he ends up getting shot, and is saved by a quick-mart owner who sews up his wound, and gets him involved in a boxing match the next day.  Gooding has a love interest that isn't connected to the story in any way.  There's some blues-bar involved in the begining and end, but like everything else in the movie, there is no reason provided, no connection.

This movie just ambles from one badly-lit, two dollar, pointless scene to the next without story, without direction, without acting, without action.

If you want to spend 90 minutes wondering how Cuba Gooding got mixed up in this low-budget, mindless, soul-less film, then you can always rent it for a dollar.  But certainly don't buy it,  you'll be doubly dissapoointed.

Its not the worst movie I've ever seen, but its the worst movie I've ever seen that had an actor like Cuba Gooding in it.  He's gotta be embarrassed.  In fact, if I were him, I'd be thinking about suing my agent, or the producer of the film for damages, because this film damages Cuba Gooding.

While on a paramilitary mission in the Middle East, David Wolfe discovers an international conspiracy connecting presidential cabinet members to a shady plot.

I played it in the store for several go arounds and the feedback has been universal in how the tedious and boring subplots underwhelm an attempt at creating an American hero in Cuba's paramilitary/secret squirrel character. The artwork is deceiving as this is not a military action film and the few surviving ""shootouts"" were corny, and funny enough, looked unrehearsed.

Aside form the four different time lines being intertwined into a ""suspensful"" story, the plot involves US government higher-ups coordinating an operation to kill the ""Ace of Spades"" (not Saddam, but Osama) whilst really hiding their motives in some convoluted conspiracy. As Cuba tries to uncover the plot he manages to listen to pointless characters talk for hours on end about their war philosophy. JK Simmons does manage to spout some fun lines on war and such, but his scenes are forced and the gun they gave him was way too heavy for him. He is always fun to watch though.

Customers have repeatedly gotten bored with it, and general feedback has been average to below average as a film, and with that lame ending one feels a loss at having watched this. Maybe next time.",1233964800,3,1293,4.789237668161435

The subtitles are from completely different scenes in a different order, so don't look to them to help.

It is amusingly low budget.",1522108800,,247,4.444444444444445

8309967,1,B001HY3B40,"I know my review accompanies a rating of 1 star but the reality is this movie deserves zero stars...it's really that bad...I don't think any of those involved in the writing, directing, and producing ever attended film school...nor paid attention in their grammar school English classes that focused on the elements and sequence of a short story or novel... I also think this movie suffered from severe financial shortages...it looks like they used a basement cafeteria to portray a fight scene in the Middle East... the movie preview is what drew me to the movie but everything you hope to see after the preview was never filmed....I will note down the names of those integral to making and delivering this movie so I will know what to avoid in the future..",1480377600,,758,4.793893129770993
