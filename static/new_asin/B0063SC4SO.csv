8492187,5,B0063SC4SO,"I wish I could own this movie but I do not own a multi-region player- and it is a region 4 (Australia, New Zealand) format movie. But I have seen this movie and the people who own the rights to it were very foolish not to give it a wider release.  Not that I have not seen such stubborn nonsense before- just remember how many years it was before ENCHANTED APRIL was finally released on DVD.

These days Hollywood is simply too jaded- and too much into reaching certain demographics- to make such an uplifting comedy.  But that is what this is- a movie where you genuinely feel good at the end. In this day that is genuinely rare- and that is a shame because there really is a market for that (think of the success of the movie JUNO).

You have to actually see the movie to understand why that is so- just reading a plot synopsis will not do it. Because much of the beauty of this film stems from the characters in the film, and the genuineness of the actors who performed the roles.",1378166400,,983,4.240641711229946
