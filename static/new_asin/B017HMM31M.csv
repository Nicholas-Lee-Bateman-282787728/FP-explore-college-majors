7505226,3,B017HMM31M,"Without specifically incriminating myself for the world to see, many will (or should) see a reflection of themselves in this film.  Those that claim this movie ""adheres to racial stereotypes,"" have not been in a crack den.  While its true that drug abuse cuts across all socioeconomic classes, the ghetto is the ghetto.  Crack is crack.  The racial stereotypes presented in this film, are the ones created by people that allow themselves to become the stereotype.  People allow themselves to become someone else's image, because it is easier than developing a truly independant persona.  That was what this movie meant to me.  I don't think its for people who are foreign to addiction and the street.  Those of you in recovery, will cringe with sympathy.",1458086400,16,754,4.976

7505230,4,B017HMM31M,"As a former addict, I have to say this movie depicts exactly what goes on in addiction. The acting was not bad and the movie set out to show the day and life of an addict and it did it well.",1457308800,13,190,3.658536585365854

8739272,2,B017HMM31M,"This is quite a trip, and not really in a good way. while it does capture some aspects of drug addiction such as demanding money from loved ones, life spiraling out of control, it kinda fall's flat on portraying the legitimate reason's one starts using substances in the first place. The entire premise of using crack as a 'shock therapy' to appreciate life after one's head is on straight is total bologna. It almost seem's in my eyes what an outsider would think of cocaine as, rather than an actual user. for instance, if this guy instead of smoking freebased cocaine was snorting powder cocaine aka 'the 'rich man's drug' it wouldn't have the same shocking effect since it's the norm for a white person to use powdered cocaine and minorities to smoke crack. but in reality, it doesn't matter. and I think that's the essence this movie fails to capture. drug addiction affects every walk of life, this movie show's a very naive view of what actual addiction even is. All in all, a very bizarre movie that really should be treated as a comedy rather than a serious look into the horror's of addiction.",1524700800,,1103,4.63265306122449
8739273,2,B017HMM31M,"Fairly lame drug addict movie, of which I've seen dozens. This ranks in the bottom half, easily. The protagonist is unlikable as are almost every other characters in the seedy underworld of crack cocaine in LA. We are given little hope and there is little sense of redemption in this one, which makes it even worse. Basically we watch the downward spiral of an upper class white photographer who constantyl surrounds himself with a pair of losers and mooches that do nothing but leech off of his resources. I was an addict once, but my chemical of choice was very different, and I didn't tolerate that kind of false companionship at all. His girlfriend is subtly masochistic, being a codependent of the worst kind, sticking with him because she has the magical wish that he will change someday. All in all, a portrait of hopelessness peppered with a few moments of humanity. Even fans of drug movies will find it largely intolerable.",1505952000,2,933,4.765432098765432
8739274,1,B017HMM31M,"I don't know what possessed my to rent this movie in the first place as it looked terrible based on the ratings given. Acting at it's poorest and I have no doubt that if you make the same mistake I made and give it a chance, at some point, you'll want to stop watching it well before the end.",1498867200,,292,3.9661016949152543
8739275,1,B017HMM31M,Worst 15 minutes of my life . I could write a better script while having a root canal. Impossible to give 1 star let alone 4 .,1491523200,,126,3.7037037037037037
8739276,5,B017HMM31M,"V glad this finally made it to Prime. Very well-acted all around; I agree with another reviewer that we should all see ourselves in one of these characters - I'll take it up a notch and admit that I am one AND those are most of my friends. Life Is. I don't even feel sad, just represented properly. If we continue, societally, to invent characters and personalities that we hope will self-fulfill, we will never see the truth in roles such as the ones in this film. If you see addiction as a plague you're immune to - hell: you think you're immune to anything you're not medically vaccinated with - kindly check yourself and wear your seatbelt. This film is your life.",1489795200,3,668,4.439024390243903

8739278,5,B017HMM31M,"A very gritty yet comical depiction of the cycle of addiction. Unlike other movies that cover the topic, the realism and grit derives from the story not stylized camera shots.",1483747200,,175,4.866666666666666
