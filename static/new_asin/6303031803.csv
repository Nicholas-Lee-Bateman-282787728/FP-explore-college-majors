It is worth seeing if only to help one understand the true meaning of the word ""horrific."" It also features the most tasteless chase scene in cinematic history. See it, abhor it, and cherish the fact that you will never again experience any film quite so abyssmal.",1050969600,,417,4.648648648648648
540923,5,6303031803,"This film is just about the cutest thing I have ever seen. I remember seeing this years ago just loving Anthony Michael Hall's performance. If you love him now in the Sci-Fi Drama TV series The Dead Zone, or you loved him in his role as Whitey Ford in 61*, or you were blown away by his performance in Exit in Red..NOW is the time for you to see a true dramatic talent like AMH be completely GOOFY!
This man has mastered comedy just as much as drama. If you loved his jazz club scene in Weird Science ( you remember the one..""Hey Fats, man..let me tell you my story, man"" ), or the scene from Sixteen Candles where he had the prom queen drunk in the backseat of the car, then you will LOVE this movie. Michael Hall just keeps getting better with age. His performance in this film is delightful! The gnome is so adorable and believe it or not the two make great costars!
Sure this movie isn't a classic like Science, the Club and Candles, but it's a great film to see Anthony Michael Hall as he makes that transition from child actor to leading man. This is that in between film where he is evolving as an actor and really coming into his craft.
Plus you can't help but love ridiculous goofy comedies like this!
"" I'm sitting here handcuffed in a patty wagon about to be charged with first degree murder, Gnorm, because you had to go doom an entire race for an elf chick named Rena?! ""
This movie didn't win any awards, but as corny as it may sound it will win your heart! Corny, cheesy thing to be said, I know.. but I love this film! And Gnorm is just about the cutest thing I have ever seen...next to AMH that is.. :)",1031788800,9,1619,4.1923076923076925

7835523,4,6303031803,"Thank you for your product, i am enjoying watching this old movie, but i love it. I was so happy to sit down and watch this movie. I do think this movie should be transferred over to dvd  one day. Most of the older movies have yet, but that's something Hollywood needs to think about investing in because the world is changing.

Thanks again",1398556800,,341,4.3125

7835526,4,6303031803,"I did not expect this old movie to be available anywhere. I was suprised and please to find it. It was delivered wrapped so securely that I had no doubt the contents would be unscathed and indeed they were intact.

The movie is great! Thanks.",1259971200,4,242,4.377777777777778
7835527,3,6303031803,"With a title like that, I expected a very dumb movie, but it wasn't bad.....actually decent. It's a harmless cop-fantasy film with police drama mixed in with some humor and special effects.

I found a lot more drama than humor, which surprised me, although there were a few funny lines by the ""gnome,"" a special- effects creation of Stan Winston.

Despite a film filled with angry characters - cops and crooks - the language was pretty tame and the film moves well and zips by since it's only 84 minutes. Yes, the story is ludicrous and some of the dialog is B-movie, but it was pretty enjoyable.

Sorry to see this unavailable in any form. Boy, if I had known that, I would have kept my VHS copy.",1234569600,2,697,4.4296875
7835528,4,6303031803,"One of the local vid stores used to do 2-for-Tuesdays, two video's for a full week for 99 cents, my daughter LOVED this movie and rented it so many times that the store owner gave it to her. Lo and behold she actually wore her copy out, and just in time for her birthday (16) it arrived safe and sound and in very decent shape, I kudo's the seller. Her birthday was March 31 and she has plugged her Gnome in a few times already. A chipper family movie with some over the top snicker factors. Low Rider has never sounded the same after viewing Norm version.",1207440000,3,556,4.205607476635514
7835529,5,6303031803,"A friend in high school remembered watching this as a child, so we spent an afternoon prowling all the video stores and rental places in town. For those of you who haven't seen the movie, the G in ""gnome"" is pronounced--so you can imagine the responses we got from the videostore workers, none of whom owned it (Smirking, ""Ugh... we have 'The G-nome Mobile'"") Eventually I bought it for him online and finally got to watch it myself.

By any reasonable movie standards, it's terrible. Horrible. Lousy dialogue, obviously done on a very low budget... and the plot is kind of lame as well.

And all the combined to make a fantastic movie to watch! It's hilarious, and the absurdity of the G-nome's search and the detective's problems combine to make a silly movie well worth the couple bucks it takes to buy it nowadays. Besides (though most of the dialogue is rather lame, as I said), how can you resist gems of lines like:

Casey: ""If you were a real gnome, you'd know it's pronounced 'nome' not 'g-nome'.""
Gnorm: ""No, it's g-not.""",1190160000,7,1031,4.622950819672131
