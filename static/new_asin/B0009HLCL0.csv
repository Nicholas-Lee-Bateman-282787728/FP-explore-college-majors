8175069,5,B0009HLCL0,"I was raised on Mexican movies and can remember many pleasant evening s watching them with my family, but the newer Cine from Mexico usually depresses me or I find it so slow that I can't watch it.  The European influence is not captured very well by Mexican directors.  I wasn't sure I would like Zurdo but took a chance on it because as a boy I played lots of marbles including the style shown in the movie.  This simple little movie was fast paced and very entertaining.  The two boys acting did a good job, the bad guys were not heroes, and though the coolest guy was killed, I still felt satisfied in the end.  It promised a fantasy and it delivered and though the music wasn't truly Mexican flavored, it fit the movie well.  The subtitles flashed on too fast for some of my non Spanish speaking relatives.",1442188800,2,811,4.373333333333333
8175070,5,B0009HLCL0,"Zurdo brings the concept of a square world seen through the eyes of a round canica sets the stage for a marvelous movie made both for kids and adults.

Set in an imaginary Mexican small town, and through he eyes of a young and innocent kid who has to play tough to survive in a tough reality, this movie is fantastic both in it's making and for the social message it carries.

When street games where the life of children and not techno, computer games......

Highly recommended for all the family.",1164585600,5,498,4.450549450549451
8175071,2,B0009HLCL0,Good movie expecialy for a foreign film. But if you plan to watch it for the music (like I did) don't waste your time. Instead Buy PVD - Global DVD and watch the 4-5 min Zurdo trailer as it is FAR FAR FAR better then the movie itself and plays the full (and best song) Animacion.,1130803200,3,279,4.0
8175072,3,B0009HLCL0,"This movie brings back memories when simple games like marbles was the only game my friends and I could because it was fun and we didn't have money to buy other toys.  The film is a cute story and children will love it.  I found the story to be lacking a strong plot.  Yet, it is fantasy and fun for younger viewiers.  I enjoyed the soundtrack by Paul Van Dyk much better...the movie doesn't have all the great tracks, but I liked it.",1126483200,3,434,4.192771084337349
