8067810,4,B0009W5K1S,"My kids (and I) have enjoyed the Koala Brothers programs very much. Though the stories are simple the characters always demonstrate helping each other and being supportive of one another. As a parent, I appreciate that in the Koala Brothers shows there is no violence, name calling, or weapons that so many other ""kids"" programs push into children's faces.",1256774400,,356,5.0508474576271185
8067811,5,B0009W5K1S,Outback claymation characters with oodles of mischievious Aussie charm find unique and compassionate ways to help each other out of jams. I love these guys!,1236902400,,156,5.28
8067812,5,B0009W5K1S,"The kids and I discovered Koala Brothers on clearance at a Ross Store.  They love it!!  I quickly hopped on Amazon and bought all of the other Koala Brother's available.  It is very sweet, yet entertaining.  The characters are always ""here to help"", and they truly care about their friends.  Teaches good life lessons!  Appropriate for any age (mine are 3 and 5).",1234051200,,363,4.682539682539683
8067813,5,B0009W5K1S,"The Koala Brothers series is fun, original, and a great choice for families. The characters are nice ""people"" (okay, echidnas, koalas, tortoises, etc.!), but not perfect. They learn important lessons in each episode.

The claymation in this series is adorable. The animal characters are interesting and endearing. This is a series with good values, yet it doesn't take a preachy approach. Instead, it just illustrates some dilemmas which kids can face, and shows the characters learning from experience how to handle these situations. It also is really based around the idea that in life we should ""always try to help!""-- what a great message to reinforce.

Best of all (?!), unlike many programs for kids the Koala Brothers series is NOT torture for adults to watch this series with kids-- you'll find it entertaining, too.",1203033600,,824,5.0962962962962965
8067814,5,B0009W5K1S,I originally got this DVD from my local library but my kids (ages 4 and 5) love it so much that I purchased it.  Great message about helping and friendship.  My kids can't get enough.  Sometimes the australian accent might be a little difficult for the kids to understand but eventually they get it.,1200355200,,299,4.5
8067815,5,B0009W5K1S,Now this great show is very amazing! It is a show that teaches the importance of lend others a helping hand. This is definitly one great show that really gives a great example of the lesson in giving a helping hand.,1163030400,,215,4.2682926829268295
8067816,5,B0009W5K1S,I just have to say I absolutely adore this show. As a caretaker for a three year old and one year old this show is the perfect way to teach kids to share and help others when there are in need. My one year old nephew gets so excited when I am about to put this series on. I would recommend this title to anyone with small children. They will not be disappointed.,1147651200,4,362,3.9726027397260273
