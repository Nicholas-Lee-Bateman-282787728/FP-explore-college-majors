8377808,5,B002QGYXTU,"This was a Christmas gift for my Grandson who is 16. After he opened the package, he ran to the DVD player and all of us watched it. Exiting stuff. Later in the day some of his friends came over and Black Winter was watched again--several times. The following day saw all the guys heading to the mountains with their boards. This DVD was a big hit, as was Grandma.",1265155200,2,364,4.214285714285714
