8365678,2,B002DPH8ZA,"Okay, I'm very familiar with Manchester and while it was fun to see familiar places, the acting in this was just too horrible to even describe. It was almost as if they tried to find the very worst actors possible. In hindsight, maybe that actually was the plan. It was so over exaggerated and oddly written, it was hard not to laugh the entire movie. I only stuck it out because I am so familiar with Manchester.....I deeply regret that I did. Sorry, but I wouldn't recommend this....if you want to see Manchester, just visit the website - the still pictures do it much more justice.",1430352000,,584,4.518867924528302
8365679,5,B002DPH8ZA,"Another slam dunk by the hot shot film-making duo of Farley and Roxburgh. Their trademark humor eases the tension as they masterfully construct a terrifying mystery revolving around love, misunderstanding, and the discovery of a race of frightful man-beasts.  A masterful performance by the large cast of talented actors draws the viewer in, paving the way for expert screenwriting to set the hook as this tale of intrigue and horror carries you on a wild cinematic adventure.",1422144000,,476,5.181818181818182
8365680,5,B002DPH8ZA,"A low-budget adventure made by and with people who were obviously having a whole lot of fun, it's impossible not to be charmed and entertained by such a warm-hearted movie. Perhaps the most American film about summertime monsters ever made.",1405641600,3,240,5.025
8365681,4,B002DPH8ZA,"NH folks should check out this fun little locally produced campfest! It's got something for everyone: pop tunes, a murder mystery, a cute romance, monsters, basketball and more. It's a really fun and intentionally silly movie. Be sure to look for Marshall's (Matt Farley's) phone number in the end credits.",1300320000,,306,5.14
8365682,3,B002DPH8ZA,"This was a fun production that seemed to be made by filmmakers that have a love for the silly qualities of small horror films. They used those qualities to create their own small town horror setting with their own fun and bizarre antics thrown in.
  This is an independent film made on a smaller budget so keep that in mind, the filmmakers didn't have a bottomless pit of a budget at their disposal. Manchvegas centered around three characters named Marshall, Jenny, and All-Star Pete who formed the MOS (Manchvegas Outlaw Society). The MOS wear their own jerseys while they earn small dollars by using a little red wagon to deliver good around the neighborhood, such as newspapers, hot dogs, lemonade, used books, their own music CDs (The opening theme to the movie was a fun song of theirs called ""Summer Fun""), etc. The MOS might sound like a bunch of children but they are actually older which makes it fun, Marshall and Jenny have a possible unspoken romance brewing and they talk to each other in bed through tin cans connected to a string!
  When a local girl vanishes while swimming in a river, her boyfriend (Vince) is blamed for the murder. But was it murder and if so was Vince in fact responsible? As more girls in the neighborhood go missing and the MOS take it upon themselves to solve the crime.
  The other main plot in the movie is whether or not Marshall can finally admit to himself he has feelings for Jenny and if he can act on them. Manchvegas was  unique in it's own right and the filmmakers seemed to have fun with it. You should have fun with it as well.",1257638400,,1579,4.5
