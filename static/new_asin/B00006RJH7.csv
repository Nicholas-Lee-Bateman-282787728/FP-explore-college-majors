7972834,4,B00006RJH7,"I bought this for the ""The Night America Trembled"". It is the story of Orson Welles' radio broadcast of ""The War of the Worlds"" that set off a public panic on the east coast. The production values are kind of low but it makes it seem very real. It clearly shows that some people were fooled and let themselves become afraid (some from innocence; some from prejudices that were only barely contained) and that others understood exactly what they were listening too. I saw this as a kid and was fascinated then by the radio sound effects, etc. (the turning of the spaceship's lid was a mason jar in an empty toilet!). The acting is pretty good and the story is still great.

The other story (""Sentence of Death"" considered the prime content of the disc) is OK but forgettable. Not a bad extra though.",1275436800,3,798,4.503448275862069
7972835,4,B00006RJH7,"You know, in the entire ""Night America Trembled"" the words ""Orson Welles"" are never heard. I actually went back and played it through again to be sure. The character is split into two - the director and the star, and in his out-of-character sign-off is referred to only as ""your host"" (Welles names himself in the original). Now what I want to know is, was that Welles' demand of the show to remove his name, or the show's idea to exspunge his involvement (and who were they trying to kid in doing so)?

Otherwise a very compelling drama. Too bad George Clooney's attempt to revive the genre (Fail Safe) didn't succeed. Now live drama is ""Big Brother"". How far we have fallen.",1187913600,2,676,4.540983606557377
7972836,4,B00006RJH7,"The first time I heard about Orson Welles' 1939 debacle of the Mercury Theater's broadcast of ""War of the Worlds"" was in 1975, when a TV movie called ""The Night That Panicked America"" aired.  Little did I know that eighteen years earlier, a shorter and much more intense TV movie aired about the same event.  Perhaps it was because this TV-movie was aired in a more innocent time that Welles' original programme seemed more palpable.  I actually felt for the first time that 'maybe' had I just turned on the radio that Sunday evening in October of 1938, I too would have been peering out my window to see if any octopus-men from Mars were scampering down my street.  As warm and intimate as live radio broadcasts were in the 1930s and 40s, live TV of the 1950s somehow made entertainment seem even more intimate and real.  This is the first DVD that I've seen of the ""Studio One"" series, and I'm looking forward to seeing more.  I have to admit, ""Sentenced To Death"" didn't blow me away, although it was still a fun experience.  ""The Night America Trembled"" did blow me away, and it had the added fun of seeing familiar faces such as Edward R. Murrow, James Coburn, Warren Beatty, Ed Asner, Warren Oates, John Astin and Vincent Gardenia.  Do watch the movies with the commercials; Westinghouse's praise for atomic power is a definite chuckle as is their cheesy-looking refrigerator, but I have to admit... I wish TV commercials were still like that!  No fifty images per-minute trying to sell you a 'cool' image.  At least back in the 1950s, they were really trying to sell you a product!  This DVD is a great evening's entertainment as well as a historical look at who we were as a nation some fifty years ago.",1149724800,7,1711,4.577049180327869
