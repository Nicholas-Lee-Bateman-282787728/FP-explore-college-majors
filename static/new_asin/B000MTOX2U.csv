8172420,5,B000MTOX2U,"This is for the Beginning to Intermediate student who wish to improve her abilitie for the drum solo. There is incredible detail given for each movement, something I appreciate since most classes do not have the time necessary to do so. The video is clear but lacking any kind of ""MTV"" effects. For a serious dance student, that would be a distraction. I am looking forward to Vol 2, and the 3rd vol which should have choreographies that will use what is learned. Although not a professional voice, Samra is the best teacher I have found for being able to break down each step into precise detail.",1188604800,11,597,4.588785046728972
