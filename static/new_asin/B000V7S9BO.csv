8217171,5,B000V7S9BO,"What a wonderful compilation of clips from some of the very best slapstick films from the 1910s and 1920s! Not only a perfect entertainment for the whole family, but also a great occasion for the interested movie fan to learn more about slapstick: a very competent narration tells us about the development and backgrounds of the genre, about the studios, producers, and of course the many uniquely talented comedians who were great stars in their days, but many of whom unfortunately are almost forgotten now: here, we learn about everyone from Billy Bevan, Al St. John and Harry Langdon to Lupino Lane, Lloyd Hamilton and Billy Dooley - a wonderful starting point for a further research on all those names and those films.",1416268800,,723,4.8861788617886175

8217173,4,B000V7S9BO,I found the SlapHappy Movie dvd to be a wonderful way of introducing silent comedies in a high school film course where many students were unfamiliar with the era. Great dvd with incredibly funny clips! Narratives introduce legendary comedians and help young viewers better understand and appreciate the silent movie era.,1280793600,6,321,5.313725490196078
