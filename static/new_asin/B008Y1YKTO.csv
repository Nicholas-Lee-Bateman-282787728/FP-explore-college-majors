5190009,5,B008Y1YKTO,"I had the pleasure and opportunity to see ""Sparkle"" this past weekend and I loved it.  I can't wait for the DVD to be released.  I will probably watch it over and over...
The whole cast was magnificent.  Whitney did a marvelous job with the song, His Eye is on the Sparrow, and Jordin did an excellent job with the song, One Wing.
The movie was a little bit different from the original version.  I love both versions.",1346716800,15,417,4.3076923076923075
5190010,5,B008Y1YKTO,"Whitney Houston finished this movie only three months before her untimely death in February, 2012. A remake of the 1976 film of the same name Whitney plays a mother to three girls who strive to make a name for themselves as a group in the early 1960's during the Motown era (obviously this story was based on ""The Supremes"", but with added dramatic elements). Jordin Sparks plays the lead in the film starring as Sparkle who, more than anyone, is determined to make it in the music industry while facing many obstacles that stand in her way.

 The performances are flawless, especially that of Carmen Ejogo who plays the role of Sister who is married to a violent man named Satin. Some critics have gone so far as to say that come Oscar time Ejogo will probably be nominated for Best Supporting Actress.

 Despite a wonderful and haunting soundtrack, a first-rate cast (featuring Whitney's last movie role) and an extremely sensitive and compelling story ""Sparkle"" failed to bring in good box office coming in at only #5 with $12,000,000 the first week of release on a $14,000,000 budget.",1345334400,13,1088,4.7712765957446805
5190011,5,B008Y1YKTO,"This Movie is a musical and a drama combined, and I could not wait until it was released. I have been a huge fan of Whitney Houston from the very beginning of her career, and watched her move up to fame. I had great respect for her, and Love all of her music. 'The Bodyguard' is one of my favorites for her music and acting. In Sparkle, her Performance was outstanding. Her own music, I will forever Treasure. In this Movie, Jordin Sparks struggles to become a star. She is troubled with issues that are tearing her and her family apart. The story portrays an affluent Detroit area as a daughter to a single mother, Whitney Houston plays the mother, must face many challenges. Sparkle tries to balance a new romance with her music manager, while dealing with the unexpected issues of her new life as she and her two sisters strive to become a dynamic singing group, during the Motown Era. The story is based on success, family relationships, and the Musician's life. I loved the movie, Acting Performance is Stunning and the memories from 'the Motown era' was delightful and Enjoyable. The music was fantastic, and the Memories of 'Motown' was mesmerizing. Her own music will live on, and all she contributed to this world. Once again, she was Amazing. My thoughts on Whitney Houston, ""I Will Always Love You!""",1345161600,26,1310,4.650862068965517

5190033,3,B008Y1YKTO,"The trailer made this movie seem like it would be the real deal. The performances of all the actors was pretty good. I will also admit here, I watched this movie, because I wanted to see Whitney Houston. Apart from a small solo, her character was believable and for some time I forgot I was watching Whitney and not another actor.
The theme was a good one...and without spoiling the movie, it will be one that has been covered many times by Tyler Perry and other black Hollywood screenwriters (domestic violence), but that is not what was dissatisfying. I was disappointed that the movie draws you in (in the beginning), but by the end, I am not certain if production ran out of money or what, but it felt rushed and then pretty predictable.  Form your own judgment when you watch, but I really wish they would have taken their time in the end. All in all, you will love the costumes...you will definitely love the music...and you will love the characters.",1480032000,,956,4.558139534883721

5190061,2,B008Y1YKTO,"While there are some redeeming moments of interest, the overall production is a disappoint to both me and my wife.  Very little good music is performed, at least I had expected a great deal more than it provided given the quality of the voices involved, and the acting was only mediocre at best.  I will probably excise the memory of this flick much more quickly than most movies I've seen.  There just wasn't anything compelling or interesting that draws one into the film, just the hackneyed emphasis on flawed macho men, and the worn out theme of a mother's unrealistically high expectations of her progeny based on her own personal woes.  Jordan Sparks is just lovely, however, and her charm is warm and lovingly portrayed, and her talent does finally take the stage at the very end to satisfy what we've been savoring throughout the movie's unfolding.",1457308800,,856,4.802721088435374

At the beginning of the movie, Whitney Houston seemed out of character in her portrayal as a strict Christian single mother of three daughters. The movie also exemplify the vast personality differences among the three sisters, however, there love for each other surreal.  Although the relationship with Whitney's older daughter was strained, the support and love among the three sisters were amazing.  Sparkle pursues her dream despite trials and tribulations and chooses her family over a proposal of marriage.

5190099,3,B008Y1YKTO,"Although I wanted to see Whitney Houston's final movie before her death, I was disappointed with what I saw. Whitney--as Sparkle's religious & morally-proper Mom--decided at the end of the movie to finally change her mind & let Sparkle sing professionally with her blessing.

What I didn't care for was how Whitney Houston as her Mom--literally did a 180-degree change in the end by giving Sparkle an overly-revealing gown to wear for her performance.  When questioned by her daughter Sparkle that ""You don't think it's too much/revealing?"", Whitney's response as her Mom, surprisingly, was basically telling Sparkle that she ""had to do it up right if she was going to go into performing"", and the scene ends there.

Then as Sparkle starts singing in the next scene, it quickly became very hypocritical to me to see what this version of the so-called ""Church-Mom"" actually bought for her child.  Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) is singing her heart out beautifully while her breasts & midriff were now heavily exposed in a deep-wide U-shaped cut-out gown in her final performance of the movie!  This was especially hypocritical when this huge CHURCH CHOIR suddenly appeared onstage & started singing as Sparkle's background!  THAT was very two-faced, like Sparkle suddenly went from one extreme of being modestly dressed in decently-sexy performance wear in all her other acts (meaning private parts were properly covered), but at her final performance--the one that was going to put her on the map to stardom--she's got ""nothing but boobs busting loose"" and for me, the sudden moral change of her outfit got in the way of her singing--from the ""decency"" standpoint of the type of character Jordin Sparks was originally portraying, it simply didn't match with the quality of her final performance, which was supposed to be ""a high-class act"".

Now, plenty of successful entertainers over the decades performed without hoe-ing themselves to the world.  You can be decently-covered and still be sexy.  Whitney herself, Natalie Cole, Taylor Swift, Dionne Warwick, Anne Hathaway, and remember Chaka Khan, and also Selena Quintanilla---the Latina singer who was shot & killed by her fan-club manager on 3/31/1995?  Both Chaka & Selena wore full-coverage bras onstage--Chaka with fuzzy-feathers all over it & a feather Native-American headdress; and Selena with studs all over it (so you never saw ANY actual breast flesh at all like you do in this version of ""Sparkle""--yet they both were still pretty & sexy).  And often Selena's midriff was showing---but NOT her navel!  Both Chaka & Selena eventually got married, and still was very sexy and well-loved by millions of fans world-wide, but were both tastefully-covered in their on-stage outfits.  And many other entertainers did & do the same to this day.  It's up to the individual.  Just copy & paste these links to see pictures of them both so you can see what I'm talking about:

But Jordin Sparks' allowing these movie producers to make her indecently reveal herself like that in this concert scene as Sparkle--especially with a fully-robed Church choir singing in gospel-tones as her back-up, was pretty sacrilegious.  And for that, I was sorry I actually had to pay to see the movie---I would've preferred to watch it on my Prime membership for free.

5190112,3,B008Y1YKTO,I saw and own the original version with Irene Cara. I enjoy that movie very much. I was happy to hear that it was being remade with Whitney Houston. I thought that maybe her drug problems were finally behind her. I rented the remake and was extremely disappointed  not just by the movie but by Whitney Houston's appearance. She looked worn out and had that haggard look that all drug addicts have. I would rather remember her as she once was. Bobby Brown should hope that this old guy never runs into him. He destroyed an American treasure,1427068800,,539,4.5

5190154,1,B008Y1YKTO,I gave Sparkle 1 star only because of Jordan Sparks. I enjoy her singing. It was mildly entertaining but had nothing on the original.  Which in my humble opinion was great. The acting and the songs in the original was awesome. If this was the best they could do with a remake they should not have wasted their time or mine.,1409616000,2,323,4.295081967213115
5190155,3,B008Y1YKTO,"If you haven't seen the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sparkle/dp/B003Y5S5WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sparkle</a>, then you will probably love this. However, if you have seen the original, you will notice that this version is as far from the original as you could get. The premise is the same - three sisters, who can all sing, are looking for their big break. One becomes seduced by fame, greed and by a man that is no good for her. Another is militant with bigger dreams than singing. But that's where the similarities end.

For example, the original takes place in 1950s Harlem; this one takes place in late '60s Detroit, in the middle of the Motown explosion, which they don't let you forget because they mention Motown,  Diana Ross and Berry Gordy in every other sentence. Instead of the single  mother struggling as a maid living in a tenement walkup with her daughters, here she's a former singing star who left the business and found the Lord. She expects her daughters to live a life that surrounds the church and they all live fairly well in a nice house in suburban Detroit. The villain in the original was the neighborhood drug dealer/pimp; here he's a successful white bread comedian with a dark side, trying to gain a black fan base.

I won't go into the other differences because there are too many to take note of. However, I think this would have been a good story if it didn't label itself as a remake of the original film, but IMO the girl group movie theme has been done to death. I don't think Jordin Sparks can act so she came off as boring to me. Seeing Whitney in her last appearance was the reason why I had any interest in this at all, but even the scene where she sang ""Eye on The Sparrow"" seemed to be thrown in there just to give her a chance to perform, seeing as she was not the focal point of the film.  However, Carmen Ejogo as Sister was compelling. She made it worth watching. I still prefer the original, but give this one a chance.",1408838400,,2023,4.687323943661972

5190177,2,B008Y1YKTO,"I'm sure I will hear from many ""Idol"" and Whitney fans, but I thought this movie was slow, boring, and unmoving. When Ms Houston set out to re-make the 1976 film, I suspect she wanted to tone-down the over-the-top histrionics that turned the story into a campy fiasco. But she took it too far: the new ""Sparkle"" succeeds only as a peek into the last months of Ms. Houston's life. The story is typical: former alcoholic Singer finds Jesus and is determined that her daughters will not repeat her mistakes. They do, with varying results. As ""Sparkle,"" Jordin Sparks is wretched. She poses beautifully but simply cannot act. Irene Cara played the role in the original and is superior in every way. The other characters in the film are forgettable and the entire project reeks of a ""Lifetime"" movie gone bad. There is one scene that I can't believe made the final cut: Ms. Houston lecturing the hapless Sparkle about the evils of drugs and the ""bloodsucking"" music business is in bad taste after her death. Which brings us to Ms. Houston's performance. Wearing heavy makeup and clearly overweight, she nevertheless is somewhat affecting. Her acting here is better than in ""The Bodyguard,"" where she played herself, or in ""Waiting to Exhale,"" where she acted like a guest on ""Springer."" The best scene in the film is also the saddest: Ms. Houston's big musical moment singing a gospel solo at a funeral: her voice clearly gone and her ravaged body unable to snap to life. You will remember these few moments long after this forgettable film (which bombed) is done.",1397865600,,1559,4.777777777777778

No one can take your talent away, and although we live in a world so quick to judge other's by their appearance you rocked it.  I can say however I'm still saddened by the tragic death of Whitney Houston, it was such a shock, but not.  It was nice to see her in this role.  A role I thought really hit home for her, really.

5190196,4,B008Y1YKTO,"I really enjoyed this film. I saw it last year for the first time before Christmas. It had me hooked...Whitney Houston in her final film performance, dazzled as the protective matriarch, who's raising 3 talented daughters: Tammy (also known as Sister, the sexy & seductive eldest sibling), Delores (the never too afraid to speak her mind middle sister) & finally Sparkle (the shy and insecure songwriter). The males also shine in this: Derek Luke as Stix (the handsome love interest of Sparkle); Omari Hardwick as Levi (a struggling worker who's instantly infatuated with Sister); Mike Epps as Satin (a wealthy comedian who Sister is secretly attracted to, but something dark is hiding under those platinum chains & gold watches). Overall, this film will not be a waste of time, as a matter of fact, I downloaded the soundtrack immediately after watching this. I'm in love with the soul sound of the 60's, Goapele ""Running"" & Jordin Sparks ""Love Will"" is on my iPod. Check This Out!!

Derek Luke once again, pulled it off as the leading male role, but Mike Epps supported his role in grand style!  Whitney Houston was Whitney, and gave a Diva-style performance, but that Jordin Sparks, absolutely nailed it at the end when she sang ""One Wing"", the girl took me to church and made me feel it!

5190220,1,B008Y1YKTO,"Dear Hollywood: I have a great idea for a movie!

An innocent but plucky little rube from Dogpatch knows in her heart that she's the next big star. She simply needs someone to believe in her. American Idol won't be holding auditions for another 30 years, so she loads up the Rambler with all her bad poetry journals and a few sequin gowns and heads to the Big City.  Of course, it's a cautionary tale fraught with peril. She finds many villains along the way, and often where she least expects them. She endures many hardships, including a level 5 trauma tornado that hits right at the knuckle-biting brink of her greatest triumph!

Yes, it's a dark and stormy night for our little star. But in the blackest moment, she finds her last dry match which I'm naming Courage. Queue the musical montage: Sparkle writing songs. Sparkle parking herself in the Mogul's lobby for days until he finally agrees to see her. Sparkle enlisting the help of all the little woodland creatures to put on a show. Sparkle rehearsing in nerdy glasses, exhausted and nearly giving up until she sings a rousing chorus of ""Bibbidi-Bobbidi-Boo."" Sparkle inspiring her dysfunctional family and magically healing all the old wounds. Finally, her perseverance is rewarded tenfold - but only after she realizes that all she truly needed was to believe in herself.  Well, that and a sparkly ruby red dress with a neckline cut all the way down to Australia. The end. Awesome, right??

Seriously, Hollywood. We all love the Cinderella story. Just find something new to say about it.  At least 'Showgirls' had a fun camp-factor (a little worse acting and a lot more sequins). The only thing that held this vehicle together was our morbid fascination with its busted pieces. Shame on you.",1375660800,,1753,4.788079470198675

Some movies people can pull you in and they can make you feel what they feel and then you have some movies where it just seems like acting, this to me was one of acting.  It was good to see Whitney Houston naturally... maybe too that's why I purchased the movie.  Although this movie tried to follow the original, it seem had it drawbacks.  I think I would wait for this movie to go for $5.00 before purchasing it.

Jordan Sparks also needs to go.",1370304000,,344,4.573770491803279

It has a strong cast of characters and everybody seemed to be the right person to play the part. Great job on the casting dept. Unfortunately, it was so hard watching Whitney especially knowing that she never even got to see the first showing, but I now have all of her movies. My hat goes off to R. Kelly on writing One Wing, he REALLY out did himself. I also bought the song and listened to it non stop for at least a week. It's the first song that I have ever heard and wanted to know who wrote it. I promise you that you will not be disappointed",1367366400,,840,3.947058823529412

Carmen Ejogo played sister really well, if she was really singing, she has a wonderful voice.  Jordin Sparks, what can I say, she was superb.  Her voice is outstanding, kudos to the new found acting skills.  Tika Sumpter was good, eventhough her role was quiet, she was strong when she knocked out Stix (Mike Epps).  I enjoyed how these sisters stuck together no matter what adversity came their way, mom or Stix.

5190263,4,B008Y1YKTO,"Sparkle (Jordin Sparks) is a gifted singer-songwriter, but her overprotective mother (Whitney Houston) and her fear of performing in front of an audience are keeping her from freely living her dream.

This is a movie about making dreams reality no matter how many obstacles. And it's also a movie about relationships - good and bad, broken and restored. I haven't seen the original Sparkle; if I did I'm sure I would have compared the two. I really liked this version. The acting was good and I enjoyed the music. I didn't know Tamela Mann (Christian music artist and Cora in Tyler Perry's ""Meet the Brown's"") had a role. It was nice to see her. She delivered one of my favorite lines: ""I tells the truth. It's in my contract as your friend.""

Most favorite line: ""It's really hard to follow your dreams, but you have to because you just might write a song that'll save someone's life.""
Favorite Character: Dolores (Tika Sumpter) - She was not afraid to speak her mind. I loved her spunk.

I felt that Whitney performance was outstanding. She seem to be able to play the role as if it happen to her in her life.
Kudos to Jordin Sparks for a first movie I thought she did well. To my surprise Mike Epps show some depth by playing a character that was not funny and he was very convincing.

5190275,2,B008Y1YKTO,"because if i paid any more, i would have wanted my money back. i'm extremely surprised the reviews have been mostly favorable on amazon. the only actor with some depth was sister. whitney played a convincing motherly role, though at times she could have done better. the story line was amateurish and predictable. the songs were a bore (even dream girls suffered from a predictable story line, but they made up for it with good actors (excluding beyonce) and amazing songs). given this was a musical, this should have been where this movie shined. jordin sparks gave a predictably poor lead role in this musical and her ending performance was forgettable.",1361750400,,655,4.90990990990991

5190278,4,B008Y1YKTO,"This is a good movie.  It's not my favorite movie of Whitney's career, but a fitting one for her last work.  If you are big fan it is sometimes hard to watch this one, due to the close parallel to Whitney's own personal struggles.  I would recommend this one.",1361750400,,259,4.244897959183674
5190279,4,B008Y1YKTO,"My interest in this movie was that it was one of Whitney Houston's last movies if not her last.  The acting was pretty good.  It paralleled abuse Whitney had to take from her spouse but in the movie the lead singer went to prison for killing her husband (she took the rap for it anyway).  It was a sad movie.  It had a lot of truth in it in that when you are a parent (Whitney) that has had it rough or seen rough abusive situations you tend to be very protective with your children, sometimes too protective, and in return your children rebel on you.  Later on they understand what you were doing, some thank you for it, some never come back.  The good thing is that the movie has a good ending, but what is so sad to see is how the lead singer devalued herself just to become famous.  To her it was better than staying home and being nothing.  That is sad.  However, Sparkle, the younger sister, went on to success as her mother learned and ended up being supportive of her and her other sister before it was too late.  She did teach them right but her grip of fear was too tight and it almost ruined the oldest daughter, the lead singer.  Good job Whitney!  Sad that the lead singer had to go to prison, but you have this feeling she will be alright too as Whitney was now visiting her.  As an after thought, I like it more and more, though the abuse and emphasis on the lead singer's sex appeal was a little raunchy and sad.  So many things about the movie reflect Whitney's life and fame and the fruits of it's exposure.",1361664000,,1525,4.195876288659794

5190290,3,B008Y1YKTO,"This newer version, to me, did not give the true essence as the original movie  1) Switching roles - It took the writing of songs from Stixs and gave it to Sparkle.  2) The family did not have money -- they were on the lower end of middle class.
3) There was not enough emphasis dealing with sex, drugs, crime and true love commitment.  4) Why call it Sparkle if it did not go with the same story line as the original.

Anyone not watching the original would find it enjoyable.  I had watched the original, several times; therefore, the reason for my low rating.",1360886400,2,562,4.314285714285714

5190298,2,B008Y1YKTO,"Houston was supposed to be the drawing point of this movie but she couldn't carry the load this time. The plot was so-so. The setting of church-going, choir-singing sisters old enough to already be on their own sneaking out of Mama's house to sing in a nightclub so that one sister could showcase her songwriting skill was conflicting.

However, the real ""dud"" point of this review is if you loved Whitney Houston, don't see this movie.  It was heartbreaking to see her pittiful performance, especially in light of it being her last one.",1360454400,,537,4.763440860215054

5190300,4,B008Y1YKTO,Good movie but can't top the first one.  The first one will always be the best. The best part of this movie is the person that should of died did. Not sister. She was getting ready to leave the sorry ass.,1360368000,,204,3.975609756097561

5190302,3,B008Y1YKTO,"I wanted to see this chiefly for Whitney.  Nobody wants to speak ill of her since her untimely death, but I have to say I still feel she was just NOT an actress. She spent most of the movie glaring sternly and doing that weird moving-her-head-side-to-side thing that's supposed to convey indignance, as in ""Who are YOU to say that to ME?""  She did a good job with her big gospel number, though that song was really not my cup of tea and her voice was nothing like what it used to be.  Her best moment was smiling radiantly in the audience when Sparks was performing her big finale.  (I don't mean that sarcastically -- she just looked very beautiful and happy at that moment.)  The rest of the cast were excellent, ESPECIALLY Carmen Ejogo, who was just electrifying. Why isn't she a bigger star?
The story and script, to me, were pretty corny and predictable, though the musical numbers were great. On the whole, though, I think ""Dreamgirls"" did all of this better.",1360195200,2,965,4.522988505747127

5190309,3,B008Y1YKTO,"I've never seen the original Sparkle, but this remake is average. I was expecting a much more stand out performance from Whitney Houston, but she looked so old and haggard in this film it was almost a joke. She plays the part of a strict mom who practically tosses her girls out on the street. The part I didn't get is why old momma would think her daughter's lyrics are too sexual, but in the end, buys her daughter a dress with very little coverage to wear on stage.

The only acting that truly stood out was that of the older sister. Her story line was really the only one of interest. I felt Sparkle's just didn't have the drama it needed. Also, I fail to believe an unknown singer like her could pack a whole auditorium of people in to see her show, so the ending wasn't that great either.

Not the best movie, but not the worst. Okay if you've got nothing else to do.",1359590400,,873,4.221556886227545

5190358,3,B008Y1YKTO,"I just saw both movies, the original and the remake of ""Sparkle"", for the first time so I can't help but review them together. They are very different movies, aside from the basic plot: three sisters form a girl group, the lead singer gets into trouble, another sister leaves, and the third, Sparkle, continues to pursue her dream of a singing career. That being said, almost everything else is different.

The original is set in 1958 Harlem; the remake is set in Detroit in the mid-to-late sixties. The original has a subplot of organized crime, the remake has an undertone of political unrest. In the original the mother, named Effie, is a soft-spoken woman who works as a maid for a rich white family. In the remake the mother, named Emma, is a strong matriarch, a former professional singer who now works as a bookkeeper and a fashion boutique clerk. In the original the girls are in high school, in the remake they are all out of high school, ranging in age from 19 to 29. In the original the family lives in a tenement apartment in Harlem; in the remake they live in a very nice suburban-type single family home. In the original the character of Stix is a kid working in a record store with dreams of managing a successful music group. In the remake Stix is already a young manager in the music business. In the original the character of Satin is a local crime boss, in the remake he is a well-known comedian.

The production values of the original movie are very modest compared to the glossy, somewhat overproduced remake. The 2012 version tries too hard to be ""Dream Girls"" but doesn't come close. The lip-synching in the original was off. Most musicals are made with the singers recording the track first and then the scene filmed with them lip-synching to it. Sister was sometimes off, Delores was so off she sometimes was lip-synching to the lead vocal and then not at all to the back-up vocal, which she was supposed to be singing. In the remake the lip-synching was well-done.

The original is a gritty story of urban struggle; the remake tells a story of the excesses of show business. The sisters in Harlem want to get out of the ghetto. When the Detroit-based sisters sing the lyric ""I'm livin' in a ghetto life"" I just couldn't buy it. The improved social and economic status of the family in the second movie removed the desperation of the character of Sister to do whatever it takes for financial stability. She instead is portrayed as a conceited whore who wants to be spoiled. Both actresses playing Sister are very beautiful and talented and were convincing in their portrayal of drug-addiction. The character in the later film was the more pathetic of the two, as a star with much potential who's light is snuffed out by self-indulgence and drugs and thus makes the fall from grace that we are so accustomed to seeing in the tabloids.

Delores is a very small role in the original film. She is the less-attractive, goody-two-shoes sister who eventually flies the coop to get out of her sisters' shadow. I was glad to see Delores have a larger role in the remake and be a stronger character with brains and ambition along with talent and beauty.

I am a fan of both Irene Cara and Jordin Sparks who play Sparkle. Irene Cara is a better actress, but she was very young and her voice had not yet matured to the beautiful instrument it was in ""Fame"". She over-sings in her duet with Stix near the end of the movie, and frankly, I couldn't wait for it to end. Jordin Sparks' singing was better in the remake but her acting leaves something to be desired; it is not bad, just ok. I could not have found her believable as a shy 15-year-old in the coming-of-age tale of the original Sparkle, any more than I could have believed that Irene Cara's character was a talented songwriter. In that respect the roles were well-suited to the actresses who played them. I could not figure out why Jordin Spark's Sparkle was living at home working in the dress shop with her mother and not in college studying music, or anything else for that matter. Whitney Houston's character says the only three things she has ever asked of her daughters are respect, education and a relationship with the Lord. Why then is an obviously intelligent Sparkle 19 years old and not in school when her sister Delores is graduating from college and applying to medical school?

Although I found the character of Emma to be a bit contrived, I think Whitney Houston is what makes the second movie worth seeing. It is not an award-worthy performance, but it was her last, and it reminds us that her career ended too soon. She was always a good actress and she plays her part well. To hear Whitney singing gospel music in church, which is where she began, was uplifting as well as a fitting swan song.

I found both movies entertaining, the music is fun. The first film is more believable but it did not have Whitney Houston. I recommend that anyone who sees one movie also see the other.",1357603200,,4970,4.5712682379349046

5190365,1,B008Y1YKTO,"This movie appeals to the new generation but for those who were around for the original this was not a remake.  It was a different movie all together.

In the original movie one of the primary reasons that Sparkle and her sisters tried so hard was that they wanted more out of life than their mother who was a domestic and had to struggle her whole life.

In this movie they were privileged brats.  Also, Mike Epps played a comedian joking about subject matters that were not talked about in front of mixed audiences.

The background music was supposed to reflect the period.  Most of the music was five years behind.

You can tell that the person who chose the costumes did not do their research for the late 1960's.  There was no way that they would have been on stage with the black see through dresses much less on television.  The cut out dresses did not become a thing on television until Jenifer Lopez's green cut out dress and she got a lot of flak even in 2000.

Come on this was a time when the censors prohibited Barbara Eden from showing her belly button in her harem custom in the I Dream of Jeannie show.

I think most people gave the movie extra stars because it was Whitney Houston's last performance.",1357257600,11,1217,4.4125560538116595
5190366,3,B008Y1YKTO,"i wanted to see this movie because it was one of Whitney's last.  It was a good move, I guess I just wanted her character to be a little more endeering.

I would definitely recomend this movie, but just not in theaters where you'll regret paying $10 to see it.",1357257600,,363,4.217391304347826

5190370,4,B008Y1YKTO,"Overall, I gave the film 4 stars.  It would have been 5 if the character, Levi had closure w/Sister.  The movie reminded me of my childhood.  I was 6 yrs. of age in '68 and remember the sounds of Motown, the fashions of the time.  Whitney did a phenomenal job and I recognized hers and Tamela Mann's characterizations of the women during that time. The Sisters reminded me of my mother and her two sisters. The store looked like many stores that my mom, her two sisters, and my grandmother frequented during that time.  Contrary to some the critics, Jordin did a great job.  She was the foil to everyone else.  After all, Sparkle's struggle was finding the courage to stand in the spotlight on her own.",1357257600,,702,4.480314960629921

5190376,5,B008Y1YKTO,"I am an avid fan of the original movie.  I saw it in the movie theater a record 15 times!  Of course, that was back in the days when they didn't clear the movie theater after each showing but it still means that I went to the theater at least 7 times, seeing it no less then twice w/each venture.  I was very skeptical of the remake because I wasn't sure how one would go about fixing something that wasn't broken.  I heard the music before I actually saw the movie and was not impressed because it was the also the original movie that prompted me to purchase Lonette McKee's solo release Words and Music back in '77 or '78 where she wrote, arranged and produced the entire album on her own.  I fell in love w/voice as well as her astounding beauty through Sparkle.  I also became a fan of Irene Cara.  I didn't think that the new vocals had the same bite as the original but once I actually saw the movie (on it's opening day) and heard the music along w/the movement so beautifully created by Fatima Robinson.

One of the reasons I purchase DVDs is for the special features which often shed so much more light on a production than comes through in viewing.  I appreciated that the story was advanced from the late 50's to the late 60's when there was so much more going on where our civil rights were concerned.  I thought all the performances were stellar and I also enjoyed the changes in the plot.  It was also a wonderful final performance for Whitney but wasn't all about her which I was concerned that it would be.  For those who are as connected to original as I am, i am very please to say that this is a very worthy remake of the original; keeping all the important issues in tact and giving the women in the story a lot more power than the original.

Happy viewing.",1357084800,,1777,4.268656716417911

5190382,3,B008Y1YKTO,"""Sparkle"" is a musical drama starring former American Idol winner Jordin Sparks.  The plot, centered in Detroit of the late 1960s, focuses on a tight-knit family of young women who form a pop vocal group and pursue music-business fame, all while trying to avoid the wrath of their mother.  The late Whitney Houston portrays Emma, the family matriarch.

Boutique manager Emma keeps her girls on a short leash.  19-year-old Sparkle dutifully keeps a job in the same store as Emma, and she participates in choir with older sister Dee (Tika Sumpter), a medical school candidate.  Eldest sister Sister/Tammi (Carmen Ejogo) is recently returned from a reportedly unsuccessful stint in New York City.  Sparkle composes secular songs in secret, and lately has been sneaking out to nightclubs where the outgoing Sister performs the material to excited crowds.

Stix (Derek Luke), an aspiring music executive, sees both of them at the club and at church.  He convinces the sisters to make a run for the big time, with him as manager.  Soon, the trio of `Sister and her Sisters' becomes a prominent local act, gaining the attention of major music labels.  Meanwhile, Stix and Sparkle (whose shyness belies her own singing talent) become smitten with one another.

Mike Epps convincingly plays the devious Satin: a ""crossover"" standup comedian who desperately wants to rebuild a rapport with African American audiences.  His smooth ways--and apparent affluence--quickly win him over with Sister, but his doping and physical abuse figure to derail everyone's goals.  Ejogo, easily the dramatic anchor of the film, is a revelation as Sister:  a worldly and blunt counterpoint to the innocence of Sparkle, she carries the most resentment against Emma, and suffers the most by narrative's end.

Houston has, in some sense, a thankless role here.  Emma's stern church-lady clichs dominate her character's arc.  Houston plays her as devoutly religious but visibly world-weary; the plot hints at--but never fully reveals--Emma's stunted singing career, and the film suffers for it.  The audience is expected to fill in the blanks on why she's bitter.  Several lines of dialogue and plot points inadvertently have an eerie ring to them in light of Houston's untimely death.

The film is a remake of the 1976 original which has since gained an enduring cult status.  Lead producer Bishop T.D. Jakes, co-writer Mara Brock-Akil and director Salim Akil infuse the film with standard gospel-play themes of temptation, falling from grace, forgiveness and redemption.  Whether familiar with the original or not, viewers shouldn't be disappointed.",1356998400,,2619,5.260240963855422

This is an excellent movie and the songs and dancing are just spectacular. The singers in the movie were outstanding and this movie is a great one to watch just for that alone.  Jordan Sparks did an excellent job in her portrayal of Sparkle and her desire to succeed carried her through the character's life and ambitions to be a smash hit singer.

5190430,3,B008Y1YKTO,"Earlier this year, a certain movie name `Sparkle' was released.  It was one of those `Dreamgirls' type films that looked marginally entertaining and clich ridden and so I passed rather easily.  I had no desire to waste my time on the film.  The reviews weren't very forgiving, and while it escaped with `decent' notices, it never sounded like something that had to be seen.  But, amidst the sea of lukewarm reviews there was a bright spot; a sparkle if you will.

Carmen Ejogo.

Ejogo received `star is born' type notices, being singled out as a bright light in the cast and a performance that had to be seen.  For about a week buzz on the internet exploded and people started wondering if she could actually snag an Oscar nomination for her portrayal of troubled Sister.  That buzz died rather quickly, mostly because an Oscar nomination for a film like `Sparkle' was, well, impossible.  Still, with the nominees released for both the Black Reel Entertainment Awards and the NAACP Image Awards I'm kind of baffled that Ejogo hasn't landed on their Supporting Actress ballots.  I mean, Naomi Harris is a very talented actress, but what exactly does she do in `Skyfall'?  I've seen the film and she's nothing but sexy.  Henson was great in `Think Like a Man', but there is marginal character development at best.  Seriously, tell me what Stenberg does in `The Hunger Games' that warrants a nomination?

Snubbing Ejogo is just ludicrous!

I guess you can probably guess that despite my initial disinterest, I actually saw `Sparkle'.

`Sparkle' is the film I expected.  It is marginally entertaining and clich ridden.  Sadly, this very complaint trickles into each and every character depicted; except Sister.  The story tells that of young Sparkle, a goodie-two-shoes daughter of a hardnosed mother with a dark past who keeps a tight grip on her three daughters and demands they give up their dreams for a relationship with God.  Taking place in the 60's, the world is bursting with the sound of Motown, and Sparkle has a knack for penning some catchy songs.  Her sister Sister has the presence to make those songs unforgettable and soon, with the help of an up and coming manager the two sisters and their younger sister Dolores form a girl group (Sister and her sisters) behind their mother's back.  Of course, drama overtakes the group and their dreams are shattered due to a series of circumstances, but that's to be expected.

`Sparkle' tries really hard to be `Dreamgirls', but `Dreamgirls' wasn't even that great of a film so it isn't really trying to be much of anything memorable.  It has some nice moments, some nice music and some nice sets but overall the film is pretty empty.  The skeletal character development is sad.  Sparkle is your blandly depicted straight laced innocent girl with dreams bigger than her town.  Dolores is nearly absent and is only there to serve as a third member to the group.  Emma, the mother, is nothing more than a stereotype.  She looks disapprovingly every time her daughter's open their mouths and she plays the overprotective mother hen with no shades, even when the screenplay tries to give her some.  The immediate turnaround at the film's end is bizarre and carries little weight.  Satin, Sister's comedian husband, is a stereotypical brute with no depth and Stix is as blandly written as they come (what has happened to Derek Luke?)

But then there is Ejogo and her portrayal of Sister.  I mean, it's almost like she's from a different movie entirely, and Ejogo tries desperately to save this sinking film.  She almost does, for every scene that she is in shines so brightly because of her presence.  The amazing thing is that she didn't have to try so hard.  Sister is a character that actually has depth and there was a bounty of material here for her but instead of resting on the obvious, Ejogo digs so much deeper.  She could have relied on sexy, but instead of infused so much desperation and eventual pain into her sexy.  She nailed it, and the relationship with Satin and her refusal to accept the life she once had is marvelously lived in.

She left me speechless.

So, while I can't recommend the film itself too highly, I do insist that you see it.  Ejogo deserves that much.  I'll be surprised if she doesn't land on my Supporting Actress ballot this year, she's that impressive here.  In a sea of `nothing characters', Ejogo truly sparkles.",1355875200,,4402,4.774834437086093
5190431,4,B008Y1YKTO,"When this movie came out a girl who works for me told me it was great, and so she got me very excited about the movie. Then I found out that this was Whitney's last movie, and I knew I had to have it. It took me a while, but as soon as it came out on Blue Ray I got it. I first had a hard time with looking at the movie, and ended up having to download Sony pictures download and watch from my laptop on my TV. I am not sure what that was about, but at least it's a type of cloud that will keep my movies.

Then I had seen the first Sparkle and so thought this one would be the same. I was so disappointed to find out that the story had been changed for the worse. Whitney was good in the movie, that was about it. I have decided that just to have her last movie is the best thing of all, but I still personally prefer the first Sparkle.",1355875200,,837,3.7288135593220337

In my eyes, Whitney could do no wrong...and because of this I was not looking for a powerful performance from her. However, the most powerful performance came from Carmen Ejogo! Wow! I truly believed her character's facial expressions, timing, and depth was all there. She made you feel like she lived Sistah's life and wish the entire movie was based on her instead of Sparkle. The only other believable actors were Tika Sumpter,Omari Hardwick, Curtis Armstrong and a little bit of Derek Luke. Who knows, it could have been the script or the director. Not sure; but the movie felt empty.

5190454,3,B008Y1YKTO,"Like ""Dreamgirls"", this, nor the original ""Sparkle"" are derivatives of The Supremes life story. Just like there have been several movies and works of art about The Beatles, there are several works that are directly and indirectly related to The Supremes. (Kinda makes you wonder if there will ever be room for a true biopic of either The Beatles or The Supremes?!?!?). In fact, just the image or silhouette of 3 female singers immediately harkens to The Supremes.
""Sparkle"" is about a girl group, three sisters (and even though The Emotions, Love Unlimited and The Pointer Sisters do actually feature sisters in a girl group......it is The Supremes that come to mind when you see 3 female singers together). It is set in inner city America that could be Chicago or it could be Detroit, just like The Supremes came from Detroit. Beyond the normal struggles of groups, girls in particular but not specifically, the similarities don't go too much further than that.
Diana Ross is neither Deena Jones (""Dreamgirls"") nor Sister of The Sisters (""Sparkle""). What is more commonplace is the support system and personalities which underscore why a marywilson is as generic, as it comes. Be it ""Sparkle"" or ""Dreamgirls"", the background singers never much arise higher than the personality of a marywilson. Who? Right. Marywilson. An ordinary background singer with a rather uninteresting backstory.

The original ""Sparkle"" was embraced as an underground hit by the urban/black community. Though Aretha Franklin was commissioned to record the soundtrack, Lonette McKee and Irene Cara actually performed the music in the movie. Though Lonette is no match for Aretha, she has a unique vocal quality that many, myself included, that actually felt cheated that her versions of the songs were never released. Irene Cara is not only a Grammy nominated singer, but, also won an Oscar, a Golden Globe, an Image Award amongst others. So while Aretha provided a Gold album in her versions of the ""Sparkle"" songs, it was perplexing why the producers did not see the marquee value in both Lonette McKee and Irene Cara having their versions released.
Fast forward to the 2012 film which reportedly was over a decade in the making, the cast is comparative to the original cast, Carmen Ejogo, in the role of ""sister"" walked away with the biggest buzz. With hardly any competition in the marketplace, the slate was cleared for this updated version to do solid box office...especially in light of Whitney's tragic transitioning. Unfortunately, the box office proved underwhelming. Since it reportedly only cost below $15 million, the road to profitability is a long and winding one......time will tell if it endures as a DVD rental title and/or cable favorite.
This 2012 version does not distract nor add to ""Sparkle""'s appeal. However, it is worth acknowledging Whitney's dedication and determination to get this version ""green lit"". It at least introduces the story to a new, younger audience. And most of all, for Whitney fans, it gives us one more moment with her enormous talent. In the original, Mary Alice, a truly underrated wonder of an actress, does not sing....it is more of a dramatic role of a singing mother raising her daughters during their pubescent teen years. That element still remains with the benefit of Whitney singing ""His Eye is on the Sparrow"". Beyond the sentiment of seeing or rather hearing Whitney sing one more time, in ""Sparkle 2012"", Whitney is actually a better actress than a singer. Unfortunately we will never know what more potential thespian gifts Ms, Houston might later display. Where Diana Ross took to acting like she did to performing, Whitney had to grow from the ho-hum performance of character, Rachel Maron, to the better ensemble player in ""Waiting to Exhale"" and then the actually marked growth as an actress in the ho-hum remake of ""The Preacher's Wife"".
Carmen Ejogo had already won my attention as the well meaning, but, not cut out for motherhood role in ""Lackawanna Blues"". The problem is that the powerful Lonette McKee still burns in the memory of fans of the original film. The film does offer even better eye candy from Omari Hardiwick who outshines Phillip Michael Thomas, whose definitely worthy, to me.
Unfortunately, the movie came and went within a moment. But it banked $25 mil against a $14 mil budget, pre-video rental/DVD sales so like Diana Ross, who has also had a short but notable film career.....each of Whitney's films were probably profitable, if only marginally so. This one, in large because of Whitney's legacy, will live on.",1355097600,,4575,5.027667984189724

When I heard a remake was coming out, I was thinking it would be an exact remake, it wasn't. I was committed to seeing the movie because I am a Whitney Houston fan as well as a New Jersyan from Newark like Whitney. I understand why the changes were made and even liked them after the fact. Satin in the original was a low life criminal, in the remake he's a comedian, the mother a maid in the original and in the remake she owns a dress shop. Stix was the songwriter not Sparkle. There were so many variations from the remake. I liked the remake because the bad guy got what he deserved and it was just different from what I expected. I wanted to pay homage to Whitney in seeing her last film. I will purchase this movie to add it to my collection of Whitney movies I already own and sadly it is the last one. It's a good movie and I have a great like for them both.",1355011200,,974,4.0

They could have picked someone who had more personality and passion than Jordan Sparks.  The plot was weak and the acting wasn't the best in my opinion. Some movies can't and shouldn't be remade which is why they're called ""CLassics"".  Remakes are rarely as good as the orignals..and I use ""Remake"" loosely since they changed the plot in this movie.  I'm glad I didn't pay to see it.

5190479,5,B008Y1YKTO,"After Whitney died I was so incredibly shocked like many others around the world, and so like many I found myself listening to a lot of her many songs and watching her movies again for months on end and reminiscing. When I realized that Sparkle was a film she had made right before she died, I felt compelled to see it but I didn't get my hopes up as I'd assumed that it would be a performance that wouldn't leave me with any closure in regards to her untimely death, but I was very wrong. Whitney did an amazing job in this movie, she really did play her role as supporting actress superbly and whenever her character, Emma, is in a scene she steals the scene. Her performance in this movie is so honest, raw, and genuine. You can tell that Whitney had to draw on her own life experiences to really play the character of Emma effectively and she did it excellently. This version of Sparkle deviates slightly from the original so it's definitely not a typical remake and its not a carbon copy of the 1976 version but it still delivers, I am sure people will like this version just as much as the old one. Jordin Sparks sang like I've never heard her sing before, she was simply awesome, and the soundtrack to this movie is catchy, anyone who's a fan of the Motown era will just like the soundtrack alone. Carmen Ejogo and Tika Sumpter gave terrific performances as well. I liked the feisty demeanor of both of their characters. And of course anyone who's a Whitney fan will love this movie, I promise. Also there are some very nice special features about Whitney and the making of Sparkle on the DVD, so it's definitely worth adding to your collection.",1354320000,,1652,4.4375
5190480,4,B008Y1YKTO,"There's an indisputable star of this synthetically watchable 2012 melodrama, and it's neither the late Whitney Houston in her last role nor Season 6 ""American Idol"" winner Jordin Sparks. It's relatively unknown British actress Carmen Ejogo (Maya Rudolph's sister in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Away-We-Go/dp/B002L2Q1SA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Away We Go</a>) who explodes off the screen in the meaty, scene-stealing role of Sister, the hell-raising eldest of a trio of daughters to Emma Anderson, an uptight, church-going woman who raised them on her own. Emma is Houston's supporting role, and while she proves she had the makings of a solid character actress, there is an unfortunate shroud of irony in her presence given her own tragic, tabloid-saturated life was itself a cautionary tale about the lure of drugs in show business. This time in the part Lonette McKee played valiantly in the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1976-original/dp/B003Y5S5WI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1976 original</a>, Ejogo inhabits the character living out the nightmare of drug addiction and spousal abuse.

The rest of the movie is mostly by the numbers. It opens in 1968, a decade later than the original movie's story, with Sister and her little sister Sparkle sneaking out to a nightclub headlined by a period-costumed Cee Lo Green in a cameo appearance. Sister vamps her way through an original song by Sparkle, which attracts the attention of an aspiring record producer named Stix. He encourages them to shoot for the big time, so they convince level-headed sister Dee to make it a trio decked out sequins, wigs and false eyelashes in order to become the next Supremes. What struck me is how eerily the three women look like the original Supremes line-up with Sparks resembling Florence Ballard and Ejogo looking like a sultry cross between Diana Ross and Beyonc. Of course, their newfound success comes with heartache, as Sister takes up with a smooth albeit vicious stand-up comic named Satin, and Sparkle struggles between family devotion and her burgeoning love for Stix.

Naturally Emma is constantly worried that her girls will repeat the same mistakes she made when she tried to make it as a singer only to be spit out by the music industry. That means Houston spends most of her limited screen time either fretting about her family or being self-righteous about her religious convictions. The dinner table scene between her and Ejogo is the movie's best moment laying bare the deep-seeded resentment Sister has for her mother and providing a flash of grief over a line that reminds you how Houston died. The melodrama is laid on pretty thick, especially during Sister's downward spiral, but director Salim Akil (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jumping-The-Broom/dp/B005B7I1YO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jumping The Broom</a>) and his wife, screenwriter Mara Brock Akil, balance it with just enough lighter moments. The songs, of course, are what matters the most, and smartly, Curtis Mayfield's original compositions have been retained with the standouts being ""Hooked on Your Love"", ""Look into Your Heart"" and especially ""Something He Can Feel"" which Ejogo performs with sultry conviction.

The new songs by R. Kelly are not nearly as memorable since they sound too contemporary for the period. Sadly, Houston sings only once in character, the spiritual stand-by, ""His Eye Is on the Sparrow"", and limited to her lower register, her coarsened voice, while emotionally impactful, is vocally a mere shadow of her once-beautiful pipes. Sparks gets to sing a lot more with a predictably booming voice, and she delivers an unaffected turn in the title role. Mike Epps gives a strong performance as Satin, and his scenes with Ejogo echo similarly volatile scenes in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/What-s-Love-Got-To-Do-With-It/dp/6305428409/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">What's Love Got To Do With It?</a>&nbsp;As Stix, Derek Luke does much better work than Philip-Michael Thomas in the original. Tika Sumpter provides some memorably defiant moments as Dee, the one sister who could take or leave the music. The movie runs too long at 116 minutes, but between Houston's death and Ejogo's star-making turn, it takes on a greater depth than the musical nostalgic trip it was originally designed to be.",1354320000,,4464,5.760606060606061
5190481,5,B008Y1YKTO,"I just finished viewing Sparkle.  It was amazing.  The actors were marveleous and the music was right on time. Whitney was astounding as I believe she delivered one of her greatest performances ever. This is a must see. Jordan Sparks really surprised me with her fresh performance.  My complaint about the movie is that I wish it had been a bit longer. Whitney's maturity in this movie really made it believable. It's hard to believe that that was her last performance.  However, it is one that she will be remembered for a long time. Mike Epps was something else. A brilliant actor, I can't think of anyone else who could have captured the arrogance and insincerity of his chracter. This movie has earned its place in my collection. Please believe me when I say that the previews does not do this movie justice. It is not just a great movie, because of the actors. It is just a great movie.

JUDGMENT CALL:

Last year, I was entertained by Salim Akil's ""Jump the Broom"" and after seeing the remake of ""Sparkle"", I can easily say that I was entertained once again.

Sure, the film received a lot of attention as Whitney Houston's final film as an actress and it's understandable to see why.  Houston shows us a happier side of the singer/actress/producer but there are other pluses of this remake of why ""Sparkle"" is a film worth watching.

First, the film is a remake of the 1976 film of the same name.  While circumstances are similar in terms of three daughters trying to make it in the music industry and one hindered by drugs and domestic abuse, the original film was almost a rags-to-riches story of a trio born from late '50s Harlem and the film deals with the seedy underground of local gangsters and mafia involvement.  That's where the 2012 film differs from the original.

The setting of this film is in 1968 and the young ladies are not from the ghetto.  They live in a beautiful home, they have jobs, one is trying to be a doctor, they are heavily involved with their church's choir.  There is an emphasis by the writers to not show the banality of African American films and making these characters live in a better situation.  Also, where the original film features their mother who is hardworking as a maid in order to support her three children, Whitney Houston's character of Emma is not struggling.  She has a job, she had troubles in her life but now has become religious and a mother caring for her children, despite wanting to protect them from the life she endured while pursuing a career in the music industry.

The three sisters which consists of Sister, Dee and Sparkle were fascinating to watch.  Many people are familiar with the amazing musical talent of Jordin Sparks, but I have not heard of Carmen Ejogo prior to this film and felt that she absolutely shined in this film more than anyone in the cast.  Not only was she expected to play the sexy, rebellious daughter who can sing but also to take on the role of the daughter who later gets high on drugs and is beaten continuously by her husband.  In fact, while the film is named Sparkle, most of the film earlier on, tends to focus on Carmen Ejogo's character of Sister.

She is the oldest daughter/sister, she is the primary vocalist, she is the one dating the comedian Satin and the musical careers of the sisters falls on her shoulders.  While the character Dee is not a major highlight in the film (until the end), unlike Dwan Smith's Dolores in the 1976 film, Dee is portrayed as a young woman who cares about her sisters but also one pursuing higher education.

Where Sparkle comes in, is the youngest sister and daughter who doesn't know where her place is in the world.  Her boyfriend Stix is the manager and promoter but as a respectable sister, she is fine in being the background singer, the person that is not the center of the group.  Also, where middle-sister Dee is the primary thinker of the three sisters, Sparkle wants to see how far the careers of the Sister & the Sisters group will go and if they get the recording contact they were offered.

It's only when the character of Sister is taken out of the film due to an unfortunate incident, the spotlight then begins to shine on Sparkle.  She must make a choice, follow her mother's wishes to abandon her musical career or pursue her dream?

And while the original film was probably more of product of its time especially with the inclusion of the gangsters and mafia, writer Mara Brok Akil did a good job in trying to keep this 2012 film much different than its predecessor by making the ladies much more respectable and less focus about the seedy crime life but to focus on the troubles of the ladies trying to have a musical career and one being subjected to domestic abuse and drugs.

""Sparkle"" is a film that showcases beautiful music that makes you want to groove and its lossless soundtrack on Blu-ray definitely makes this film sound much more incredible and lively.  Picture quality is also wonderful and for special features, several making of featurettes but also a tribute to Whitney Houston who passed away three months after the making of the film.

Overall, ""Sparkle"" is a well-done remake of the original 1976 film that not only showcases the beautiful performances by Whitney Houston and Jordin Sparks but also introduces us to a fine actress in Carmen Ejogo, who I hope to see more of in the near future.  Another wonderful film from Salim Akil and crew, ""Sparkle"" is recommended on Blu-ray!",1354233600,,7421,4.85828025477707

5190492,3,B008Y1YKTO,"""Don't ever be sorry for telling the truth."" Sparkle (Sparks) is a great song writer but is afraid to preform them herself. Her sister is a great singer who can seduce any crowd. Along with their other sister they form a group that is on the cusp of getting a record deal, all while keeping the secret from their mom (Houston). But not everyone can handle success. Going into this movie I was more or less expecting another version of ""Dreamgirls"". For the most part that is what I got. The ironic thing about this though is that the main singer in this who was trying to be like Diana Ross ended up being more like Whitney Houston (I'm not sure if she knew or not). Again though for the most part this is just a remake of ""Dreamgirls"", even casting another ""American Idol"" as the star. I can't decide what one I liked more but I'm leaning toward ""Dreamgirls"" mainly because I like Eddie Murphy. Overall, if you liked ""Dreamgirls"" you will like this one. I give it a B.",1352937600,,969,4.359116022099448
5190493,3,B008Y1YKTO,"This remake was not as great as the Original but it was still entertaining, I would have hoped that in the new version Carmen E.(who played the lead-Sister)would have had the same fate as Leonte McKee did in the original,which showed Sister's downward spiral on Heroine and even a brief Powerful version of ""Giving Up"" which was not in the remake,then of course the tragedy of her death, but this new version Sister simply went to jail, which was still okay, also in the original, one of the sister's was responsible for sending Sister's Drug dealing man to prison, so it showed a little more sisterhood. I Love Whitney Houston however this role was really not the best choice for her, even thou she did okay, I didn't expect the critics to stand up and cheer, but knowing this ICON has passed and watching her last film makes you more sympathetic and helps you overlook her acting skills.
All & all I added this blu ray to my collection because I'm a big Jordan Sparks Fan and her singing is still amazing,Derek Luke & Omari Hardwick are always worth watching & the movie is entertaining and I miss Whitney!",1352505600,,1108,4.57286432160804

I'll say the same thing I told my friend when we left the theatre. ""They would have been better off giving the movie a different title..."" I love Whitney and think the rest of the new cast was great. But I don't even see this movie as a ""tribute."" It was just a rather good movie with the wrong title behind it.

I recommend purchasing both the original and the remake, forming your own opinion, and developing your own appreciation for each.

5190495,4,B008Y1YKTO,"I went to see this movie because I wanted to see Whitney Houston's last performance.

Sparkle tells the story of three sisters, raised in a nice home by a strict mother, played by Whitney Houston who used to be an alcoholic, but has found the Lord and wants to keep her daughter on the narrow path.

As you watch this movie you will begin to notice this strategy has limited success.

It's also framed as a cautionary tale about the bumpy road to fame.

One daughter is a beautiful talented singer, another Sparkle is a talented songwriter who has always been in the sister's shade but prepared to sacrifice for the good of the group. The other one is simply brainy and attractive.

The pitfalls of music and life are explored as the girls form a group and the singer gets into a relationship with a tv comedian and experiences a fall from grace. The movie explores themes of drugs and violence. Will she manage to retieve herself or will tragedy ensue? Rifts occur which threaten the family itself.

I found the movie enjoyable. I loved Whitney Houston's singing solo. The quality of songs were pretty good with a mixture of gospel music and 60s motown type pieces.

After I saw this movie I watched the original&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sparkle/dp/B000JLTRH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sparkle</a>&nbsp;with Philip Michael Thomas of Miami Vice, Irene Cara of Fame, and Lonette McKee.

I highly recommend you check out the original. If you happen to be an Amazon Prime member as I write you can watch it for free. While the production values of the current movie are better, the original movie definitely has its moments. It features songs by Curtis Mayfield, a funk master, and I loved the singing performances of the girls with their delicate close harmonies. It also has an organised crime element. Events do differ between the two movies.

The original is set in Harlem while the remake is set in Detroit. Judging by the reviews the original seems to have achieved a cult classic status with people claiming to have seen it a hundred times. I prefer the original but you may feel differently particularly if you are a Whitney Houston or Jordin Sparks fan. It really is a vehicle for her talent.

I think most people will like it and trust this was helpful.",1350259200,65,2311,4.902564102564103
5190496,4,B008Y1YKTO,"There is so much that many people have said about Whitney Houston through the good and the bad. When she planned on making a remake of the film Sparkle, a film that she had watched when she was a teenager, she never thought she would plan to remake the film. Sadly, she made the film and finished it shortly before she had passed away, earlier this year. No one ever thought that this would be her swan song. Nevertheless, loss was all around the film when she originally planned the film remake. The late singer Aaliyah was tapped to play the lead role in Sparkle in 2001, but because of her untimely death in a plane crash, the film was placed on the back burner for nearly a decade. The film which was released earlier this year was a somber farewell to the most important female singer in the world. With Jordin Sparks taking on the lead role, the question is could the chemistry work here. Well, it did just that.

The 2012 remake of Sparkle stands tall, telling the tale of a inspiring singer Emma, raising her 3 kids, and surprised about seeing them drive into the world of stardom. Jordin, Carmen, and the cast had a lot to learn on the film, and drive not just through Whitney Houston, but also the shadows of the people who did the original film and the music. They did it nobly well. The film showcases a inspiring mother, but also wants her children to be bigger than the wastes of life with fame. Carmen takes that lead, but sadly hides her scars well from physical abuse and drug abuse from her family. Jordin shows that she can deliver well in acting, but had more to deliver in voice. Whitney's presence in the film is the real showstopper overall. When she did her number, His Eye On The Sparrow, it really brought me to tears, and showed regardless of the personal pain Whitney Houston went through and all the years she was treated as a joke, and not looked upon as a person that she could not only still sing and act, but thrive as a beautiful swan. Jordin Sparks and the cast had to thrive in voice from the shadows of Curtis Mayfield and Aretha Franklin and sold it to a whole new generation, but could've brought more into the songs.

Overall, I promised myself that I would go see Sparkle when it came out the opening day, even before Whitney Houston passed on, and I kept it. I am so glad she made this heartwarming film, and reintroduced it to a whole new generation that really has forgotten what voice and song has meant to film and even music. The film did put a deep tear in my eye, and a real guilty pleasure for a new era. If you have just recently heard Whitney Houston from the impact of her death, or are a die hard fan of the original Sparkle, than you'll definitely love this film.

5190498,5,B008Y1YKTO,"""Sparkle"" is a musical-drama starring Jordin Sparks and Whitney Houston. It is a remake of the 1976 cult classic of the same name. The remake changes much of the storyline so it is difficult to compare with the original. They are two seperate films and both have a lot of sparkle.

The storyline isn't the most original but with this type of film it never is. However, the incredible cast help to sell every single scene and create truly fascinating, three dimensional characters. It's these complex characters, and not the plot, that really gives ""Sparkle"" it's shine. Carmen Ejogo is perfect as Sister. It's a character that would be easy to play wrong, but Ejogo absolutely delivers. Whitney Houston is a revelation. She was never known for being a great actress, but in Sparkle she plays the part of the weary mother with absolute conviction. This was her role, nobody elses. Tika Sumpter steals every scene she appears in - playing a character that was very unmemorable in the original 1976 version. Mike Epps is phenomenal as Satin and Derek Luke is always a pleasure to watch on screen as Stix. Omari Hardwick gives his character an emotional depth and you cannot help but feel for the character. It is only Jordin Sparks who does not really add much more to her character than what was on the page. But, Sparks still does well (especially for it being her first acting role in a movie).

The cinematography is beautiful and despite one very amateurish shot at a crucial moment in the film, it helps create a realistic and magnetic Detroit in 1968.

The music also cannot be beaten. They have retained many of the classic numbers from the original including ""Hooked on Your Love"" and ""Something He Can Feel,"" but R Kelly has also written some soul-stirring new songs for this version such as ""One Wing."" Whitney Houston gets to take the gospel standard ""His Eye Is On The Sparrow"" to church which is one of the most moving parts of the film. What a loss to the world her death was.

""Sparkle"" will always be remembered for being Whitney Houston's final piece of work before she died. Luckily, Houston went out with a great film that only adds to her incredible legacy. It does her proud.",1349568000,,2194,4.661498708010336
5190499,4,B008Y1YKTO,"It is so hard to believe that Whitney Houston passed away in 2012. Her death was really the template of what was going through music in 2012. Nothing really stood out with a lost of a tremendous and influential women as she always showed. A singer, a mother, a humanitarian to cancer and AIDS, and at the end of the day, she was told she was absolutely worth nothing for who she was. I don't think Whitney had ever forgotten that and I don't think she ever forgiven that either as a person. When I had heard she was tapped and made a remake of the film Sparkle, I had promised myself even before she passed that I would see the film when it came out. I saw that film on opening day, and was blown away with Whitney's delivery. She remade a film close to her heart she watched when she was just a teenager in the 70's. The question is that is it worth seeing. For Whitney, the answer is definitely a yes.

The 2012 remake of Sparkle shows a mother raising three girls, Whitney, and remaining strict and down to Earth at how you can be ambitious and not faithful with what you get in the end. The movie features a soul group called Sister and her sisters delivering in voice and harmony to a tee during the 60's, when music was really washed down with soul from Motown soul delivering in the world. Jordin, Carmen and Tina deliver well in their acting, but when they sing through the essence of soul that Aretha Franklin and Curtis Mayfield made their mark on the world on years ago, it just doesn't deliver as well. The acting is strong from the trio to the bone. Through the trials of abuse and vices, to being true to yourself and making a mark in voice the way Jordin did by being a good character as Sparkle, all the way to Whitney's strong and striking delivery as Emma, the film is definitely gripping from start to finish. But it is Whitney's delivery on His Eye On The Sparrow that brought me to tears the deepest as the real showstopping moment of the film, and a reminder of what a real voice is suppose to sound like in soul and especially heart, especially in this era where artists have came out with tacky songs altogether.

All in all, I am so glad Whitney Houston made this film before she passed on. Sparkle is definitely a treat for the hard core Whitney Houston fan, and for anyone whom has finally discovered her as a person, not as a joke.  Sparkle is a treat for anyone who loved the original film, and a delightful nod to a new generation in soul music. Jordin, Tina and Carmen had a lot to learn from Whitney Houston and the original version of Sparkle and they did it very well, but some more in voice was needed. God Bless Whitney Houston and her beloved sparrow. She will always be loved.

Whitney Houston 1963-2012, The world will never stop loving you.
