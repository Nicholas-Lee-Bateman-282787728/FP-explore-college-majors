8504837,1,B006UXPMBS,"The only other Zero Woman movies I have seen are 'The Red Handcuffs' and 'Assassin Lovers', those two were pretty good, as far as exploitation films go. This one 'Zero Woman R' is just an extremely low budget film with no real plot or acting. Most of the time the actress just stands there, period. The actor is always smoking in an anonymous hallway talking to another character. I had no idea who was who in this movie and the poor translation didn't help, although  a few times I understood what was happening by the way the subtitles were translated, otherwise the subtitles were no help, almost all of them seemed to be literal translations. The other movies had a plot, nudity and sex and violence as an exploitation movie should. This one had some sex and nudity, but seemed to go out of the way to hide the women's nipples. And the violence is laughable. The only thing this movie is exploiting is your expectations and your pocketbook.",1456617600,5,944,4.585798816568047
8504838,5,B006UXPMBS,Just a fun sexy flick.  Fight scenes are amazing. And the soft core sex is awesome.  If you want a chick flick or serious drama look elsewhere.,1434240000,5,143,4.2592592592592595
8504839,3,B006UXPMBS,"Zero Woman R is currently the latest in the franchise (2008) but unfortunately suffers from too much expectation that the average viewer will have the patience to piece together the plotline. Rei is an agent of the Zero Division of the Tokyo Metropolice, which acts as a special ops department. The common thread in these films is a different actress portrays Rei in each movie. This time the actress plays her as a woman basically bored with her job and blurs the line with her actions as to what is operational procedure. The story- a female assassin is hired by an extremist group to kill three bankers with shady deals with the American army. Rei is tasked with stopping her. Two bankers are dispatched and the extremists are found by Rei to be making money from nationalists AND the corrupt bankers. Rei eliminates these criminals and discovers that the assassin is the daughter of the vice-minister that is the power behind the bankers. The assassin kills the third banker and her father before Rei shows up. Rei understands why the assassin agreed to the contract- she knew her fathers infidelities caused her mother to kill herself. Both Rei and the assassin are seen to be working in the national interest and Rei lets her go. All this plot is thrown at the viewer in the last 15 minutes and without much exposition. The character of a priest that shelters the assassin is kind of weird- it seems he mentored the girl yet is easily seduced by her. He tries taking the fall for the murders and then kills himself when the police let him go. The ending has Rei bringing the girl to see him in the chapel dead and leaving her there. Rei is then confronted by her supervisor, who shoots his gun (at who?) and Rei walks off. The end. Recommend for someone who has seen a Zero Woman film or likes Japanese cinema and doesn't mind a film that depends on the viewer to realize the plot on their own. An okay film, but not the average for Zero Woman.",1369353600,5,1950,4.526912181303116
8504840,4,B006UXPMBS,I don't think Zero Woman R is the best in the Zero Woman series. But it is one of the better ones. Atsuko Miura does a good job of playing the sexy assassin.,1353628800,,157,3.787878787878788
8504841,1,B006UXPMBS,"As much as I love the Zero Woman series (and I do, in spite of my friends and relatives' scorn) I gotta say this latest entry is just howlingly BAD.

The plot is confused (there are two -count 'em- female assassins in this movie and for quite awhile it isn't very clear who is who, and more importantly, why?). There's a lot of shooting, and some bad American soldiers (Americans seem to be on the side of the bad guys here, as if they were still, in 2010, an occupying army), some student revolutionaries who are mad about something, and given to laughing fiendishly, what looks like a Catholic priest who seems at first to be a victim but later seems like a hero, but he killed himself for some reason.  There is flickering love interest between the new Rei (Zero Women are all named Rei) and a naive young cop who stumbles into her business and won't go away, until he gets offed too, and so on.  The sex scenes (mostly with the other, bad female assassin) are, in fact, almost completely gratuitous, filled with nasty slurping and lip-smacking, and often have a grainy, poorly lit look, like out-takes from a cheap porn movie...  Which this movie sort of totters on the edge of becoming during these extended, boring scenes.

It's not even clear at the end of the movie whether Rei's boss has shot her... or just shot AT her in exasperation.  Is she dying of a bullet wound, or just feeling kinda sad about all the pointless sex and violence that she's had to wade through for the last 90 minutes?  We'll never know, because the screen abruptly slams to black, then credits.

The only remotely good thing about this film is the truly awful (and occasionally hilariously awful) subtitles - the worst I've ever seen - stiff and literal at best, absolutely impenetrable at worst!  Even if, like me, you were at first delighted to see that Zero Woman is not dead and gone after all (the jacket says ""She's Back With A Vengeance!""), give this one a pass and save your money!  If the franchise can't do any better than this, I'd say put Rei to rest at long last.  I was so disappointed. The tears are dripping on my keyboard.",1277251200,7,2123,4.474093264248705
