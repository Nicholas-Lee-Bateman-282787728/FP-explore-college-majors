Glad I still have a VCR player as it was not available in DVD. The routine is very easy to follow and I still feel like I have gotten a good workout, doing it.",1442793600,,337,3.732394366197183

7853437,5,6303853129,I love this video.  The workout isn't too difficult or easy.  I enjoy using the step.  Wish it were in DVD format.,1376611200,,114,4.090909090909091
7853438,2,6303853129,Bought this thinking Weight Watchers would provide an easy-to-follow workout. Not so. Step videos by Jane Fonda and Kathy Smith do a much better job of taking you slowly through the steps.,1373932800,,188,4.90625
7853439,5,6303853129,"I bought a step a couple of weeks ago, but I couldn't do the tape it came with for more than five minutes.  (It seemed like the instructor was trying to incorporate every single move she had ever learned.  She didn't slow down the moves at first so that you could learn them and her cuing consisted of fancy terms that only an experienced stepper would know.)  This Weight Watchers tape is the exact OPPOSITE of that tape.  The instructor shows each step combo slowly a few times before she speeds it up, and she incorporates the same basic 10-15 steps into a variety of combos.  Her cuing is excellent and very easy to follow (knee up, side step, toe touch--doesn't get simpler than that.)  If you are still having trouble following the video, you can modify it by doing less arm movements.  Also, the video is broken down into a warmup segment, three aerobic segments, and a cool-down segment, so if you are limited for time, you could do just a few segments.  Just a couple notes of advice:  Obviously, you need to have a step (duh), but you also need light hand weights.  Your workout won't be the same without them because the arm toning sections concentrate on the arms and minimize the stepping needed.  Also, if you are a very good stepper and attend a lot of step classes, this workout might be too easy for you.  I think it is more focused towards beginners like me.",1091318400,8,1376,4.46
7853440,4,6303853129,"I bought this tape 50 pounds ago and still use it occasionally for variety. It is a great introduction to step but is not overly instructive for those who already know step commands. Form is not very well explained  in the weight intervals but if you use light weights you shouldn't get into  too much trouble. It is a fairly quick tape... aproximately a half hour.  The intervals make it seem even faster. My only real disappointment with  this tape is that there are no exercises for the abdominal area. Also, I  don't know if the description tells you this but you will need an aerobic  step and some hand weights.",952992000,28,617,4.513513513513513
