8100273,5,B000CQBUYW,This is a great instructional DVD that I recommend for both beginners and experienced conga players. It covers a lot of different genres and gives good step by step instruction on techniques. I specially liked the over the shoulder shots when showing hand techniques. I am an experienced player and learned somethings from this DVD. It gave me new beats to add to my rhythms and I have truly enjoyed this DVD.,1362700800,6,409,4.694444444444445
8100274,5,B000CQBUYW,"After becoming very interested in adding percussion to our band, I began searching for some good instructional videos on congas & other percussion items. This is the most helpful one of its kind that I have found. I'm a relative beginner to drumming, but not to music. And with well over 75 instructional & performance videos in my personal library, I know a good one when I see it. I found this one to be not only very helpful from an informational & technique standpoint, it is also a good production. And very easy to navigate. I believe it is most appropriate for an intermediate student; however, I'd still recommend it for beginners & advanced students, too. There is much here for everyone.

There are other videos in the Kalani jam series that I don't rate as high. He is, however, a good musician and good teacher. So glad I got it - truly worth every cent. And a MOST welcome addition to my library.",1301788800,11,909,4.509090909090909
8100275,4,B000CQBUYW,"I purchased this DVD after months of looking it on line and being a bit skeptical about it. After checking it out, I like it. It has a bit of everything, from the basic tones to various step by step rythms. There may be some parts where it can maybe be a little much for the brand new beginner, but with a little rewinding/re-reviewing and time, you will be fine. I myself am happy with it and glad I bought it.",1240790400,18,411,4.08641975308642
