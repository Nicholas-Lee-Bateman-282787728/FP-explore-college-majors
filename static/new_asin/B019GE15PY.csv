7575332,2,B019GE15PY,"If you're hoping to have the extras such as the Pikachu shorts that were originally released with these in both theaters and on the VHS/dvds, keep your money and try to find one of the older dvds. These seem to be following the trend of the most recent movies and giving you a completely barebones package, and honestly this trimming of features makes this whole release seem overpriced.",1454716800,2,387,4.705882352941177
7575333,5,B019GE15PY,"Pokemon has a 20th Anniversary Celebration video on their YouTube channel. Along with other items is the news that these 3 movies have been Digitally Remastered for re-release in 2016. It makes sense that this would extend to the Blu-Ray release. So not only are Pokefans - as Big_macj puts it - lucky to receive these films on Blu-Ray format, but we'll probably get them remastered to boot. My youngest grew up with & loving all things Pokemon. She still does. We have wonderful memories of seeing these films the 1st time around and are very much looking forward to seeing them again. :-)",1453939200,,590,4.6826923076923075
7575334,5,B019GE15PY,This is a great deal!  The first 3 movies for that price all together and on blu ray. If you tried to buy the dvds of them now they're all like $60 to $90. So happy they're releasing this,1453852800,,187,3.7948717948717947

7575336,5,B019GE15PY,"OK first off I just want to point out i'm a hugefan of the series I grew up in the 90s and obviously it's something that is desired to be released on Blu-ray, in response to the people that are above me giving terrible reviews for something not even available yet you people need to realize that you cannot be greedy when it comes to Blu-ray releases very rarely will someone actually release a movie like this especially when it's not in high demand only the fan base that it's aimed towards is asking for it and it's a very risky gamble on the company's part. You guys should be very excited and happy that we even have a company like Viiz media release this in a higher quality format I just really think people were expecting way too much out of movie that was released almost 20 years ago not even good movies from back in the 90s get decent Blu-ray releases just be happy that it's even available.",1452211200,16,903,4.317647058823529
7575337,3,B019GE15PY,I'm rating this as ok as the audio has been reduced to stereo quality.  I own original dvd and I could have sworn it was 5.1 doby not stereo.. if i'm wrong I will update my review score.  I was really stoked to hear it was on bluray but if dumbing down the audio makes it go to bluray I don't want it.. If amazon or a company wants to send it to me to test and change my score i'll try it.. I saw it in the theater and I don't recall stereo quality there.. so sorry if the 3 out of 5 offends someone.,1451433600,5,500,3.707547169811321
7575338,4,B019GE15PY,"It's combining the best of both worlds for optical media. It has the retro movie only no filler of the VHS Releases for the more nostalgic and a sleek steelbook blu-ray case that looks far better than the last Pokemon movie bundle set by Miramax. Also the fact that the blu-ray disc will be colorful and not a blank double sided dvd with the movie's title in small font. Hate it when companies do that with film bundles. Buying the set for 2,000 and the wonderful 3rd Movie. First movie is why it's a 4 star rating",1450569600,2,514,4.309278350515464
7575339,3,B019GE15PY,"Finally, a Pok&eacute;mon movie is being released on Blu-Ray, and the first three movies originally released by Warner Bros. at that, but several problems.
1. It will NOT include the Special Features that are on the Warner Bros. original releases, ESPECIALLY the three Pikachu Shorts.
2. Only English audio (just 2.0 with that (which it should've been at least 5.1, since it's Blu-Ray)), with just English Dubtitles. (If you don't know what Dubtitles are, the subtitles are extracted exactly from the Dub script.)
3. I can't trust Viz putting the ratio 16:9, considering what Funimation done with some of the Dragon Ball Z DVD and Blu-Ray releases.  (I don't have any of those releases, honestly, but I heard about this.) Since the movies were from 1999, 2000, and 2001 respectively, I don't think the quality will be improved for the Blu-Ray release, except for Pok&eacute;mon 3.
Hope for the best Viz doesn't screw this up like they done with the re-release of the Orange Islands season.

EDIT 1: Almost forgot about the price, WHICH SHOULDN'T BE THAT HIGH FOR JUST 3 BLU-RAY MOVIES!

EDIT 2: If you want to buy this, go on ahead, but I recommend that if you want the special features and the mini-movies, keep the original DVDs if you still have them.

EDIT 3: I should've brought this up a long time ago, but there's no subtitles AT ALL, yet they still put them on their DVD version of the single movies.",1450569600,10,1408,4.711382113821138

No ""Mewtwo's Origin"" (Should be recut into the film LBH)
No Pikachu shorts

Most of the complaints are about the 2.0 audio and the video quality is no better than what's on the DVD release, but to me having it on a Blu-ray is nice. Blu-ray's are said to be more scratch and warp resistant and have a longer lifetime than DVD's. Another common complaint I read is how it doesn't include the Pikachu shorts, but personally I never liked those anyway so no big deal there to me. However, I still have the VHS if I ever want to annoy myself. lol jk . This Steelbook does lack bonus features and I do like to watch interviews with the voice cast and writers and such, but the only bonuses to buying this steelbook are 1. Steelbook 2. Blu-ray. Even though it could've been better with bonus features I'm just glad to have it on Blu-ray and I still give it a 5/5. I only paid $19.99 for mine and honestly I wouldn't pay anymore than that for it. I waited for months for the price to drop from $34.99 to $19.99.

Which is a basic looking one at that but still awesome nonetheless. What sucks about it is that it doesn't contains the shorts, any trailers and no 5.1 Dolby. So it is very lacking in content, you just have the three movies. On the screen it says ""Play"" and ""Scenes"" only with no other options. You don't even get to have subtitles. It is disappointing to not have the shorts that was played along with these movies. They was just as memorable for me compared to the movies. Anyways, if you never seen the shorts it wouldn't be as much of a disappointment to you. I still recommend buying this if you haven't seen these movies yet or if you are a huge Pokemon fan that craves getting one of these. I still feel somewhat satisfied with it, the steelbook that is. The movie quality is okay but I don't see any adjustments to the quality besides it just being upscaled for quick bluray releases. They probably just took the dvd movies and upscaled it and that was it. But Happy 20th Anniversary to Pokemon, this bluray movie set could've been more improved and more significant due to this.

These where the ones who cemented (along the games) the importance of the world massive phenomenon that stays today. The little children are still playing pokemon and everyone has the Pokemon Go app on their phones. But these movies had a feeling that even the anime couldn't give the audience. It presents the mystic Pokemon and a storyline that includes our friends, Ash and Pikachu through the first two generations of Pokemon. Having on screen the Mystic Pokemon who we caught in our gameboys right there on the big screen was magic. This 20th anniversary package give us these three movies in Blu-Ray and they look awesome.

Otherwise, GREAT COLLECTABLE. I will watch these with my sisters and relive the past in better quality than the DVDs of these movies in 4:3. The blu rays here are in 16:9 and there are very small black bars at the top and bottom but that's just something they couldn't fix as the aspect ratio can not fully expand to 16:9.

This BLU RAY collection is missing them. Yes, you read that correctly. The ORIGINAL VHS releases of these films had more content than this BLU RAY collection. Absolutely no excuse for that and I wish I had read the reviews before purchasing.

The movies finally released in HD Bluray format with original widescreen ratio (some of the original dvds were fullscreen) which adds A LOT to them (especially the 1st). The steelbook casing is very nice (though, as with most recent steelbooks, the paint seems to scratch way too easily). My only real issue with this release is the lack of the shorts, special features, and Japanese audio/English sub version. The latter I didn't really expect but would have been nice for first hand comparison, but I really didn't expect the shorts to be missing. I mean they released in theaters with the movies for crying out loud so you'd think they're a package deal but I guess not. I'm sure it was some kind of rights issue that Viz couldn't (or wouldn't) resolve, but it does make the release that much inferior to the original dvds. That said, if you're a fan of these movies pick this set up for the better looking movies anyway because the difference is very noticeable (I did a direct 10 min comparison of 1st movie when I got this as I own the original dvd).",1462579200,,1100,4.532663316582915

The bluray quality is like that of the DVD's with no remastering to brighten the colors. Also, the pikachu shorts that accompany every movie and are shown before the film are missing. When you watch the credits for the first movie, you will see about Pikachu's Vacation. Those shorts are no where to be found on the discs. This set is for the movies only with no extras. There is also no dual language option, so you are only getting the English version. You would think by now that they would offer a premium set, but at the time of this review, they have not.

Also, the Steelbook case is GREAT. I love Steelbook cases, and this one lives up to my desires.

However, this is still a somewhat disappointing release.
- Audio is only in stereo.
While I'm not going to pretend that video re-mastering is magic, from what I understand of the remastering-from-source process, they could have been able to give us 5.1 surround audio if they wanted to put in the work. Not sure why they wouldn't do this. Even DVDs supported surround sound!!
- There's not really any extras.
No extra disc, no bonus features, nothing. Just the 3 films on 3 BluRay discs.

Sound quality could be better and I wish there was special features, it is a blu-ray after all. And I really wish they would have added the real begining back into the first movie for this release. I know it's kind of a lot to ask for, but I mean, it's already been dubbed in English. It's that thing they called ""The uncut story of Mewtwos origin"" that they turned into a special feature and put on the Mewtwo Returns DVD. It really makes the first movie a lot better in my opinion, (especially the whole tears giving life thing) but I AM 26 years old. But non the less this is nostalgia at its best. I love all these movies! It's worth buying for the cool tin case and for finally being able to have some Pokemon movies on blu-ray in America.",1456444800,,856,4.219512195121951

The steel case looks good but  i don't like how the disc holders were designed, you have to take one disc out in order to get access to the other, page-style would've been appropriate.

Overall, i feel this could've been a great bluray release if they had included all the extras, shorts
alternate (japanese) audio,at least 5.1 audio,
alternate cuts such as the ""origin of mewtwo"" special.
 this is what bluray format is for,
but for some reason they didn't want to take advantage of it.

The price is a little high for such bare bone release

I easily would have given it 5 stars with the better audio. Otherwise, the movies themselves look pretty great.

The steel case is really nice and good quality, even on the inside and the disks themselves look really nice. But there isn't a sleeve for the case so it's sort of a let down there.

Blue ray can hold a ton of content and I'm sad they didn't utilize that.

I have been waiting for years to buy a solid, HD collection of these films. Sadly, this is nothing more than a quick cash-in from the Pokemon company and it shows.

First off, there are absolutely zero special features to be found. No concept art, commentary, games, nothing. You get the option to look at the boring menu with ""play"" and ""scenes"" made available. Now usually I don't worry about special features but with this supposedly being a ""limited edition"" set, I expected more. This is just a lazy collection thrown together.

Second, the steelbook feels flimsy and cheap. Not worth the price I paid.

Third, the exclusion of the Pikachu shorts is unforgivable. That was an integral part of the experience and they should AT LEAST be included as some type of special feature.

And finally, the quality of the actual films really hasn't even improved that much. The animation looks slightly cleaned up, but it is nothing that is jaw-dropping. The sound quality is still the same as well. There's no reason for this collection to be any more than $20...MAX.",1455753600,2,1179,4.736585365853658

I had already suspected the Pikachu Shorts weren't going to be included in this, so I knew what I was in for. The nostalgia is strong with this Blu Ray Set. I couldn't wait to watch them so I binged all three back to back. I was happy with most of this but obviously not all of it. You can tell that some scenes in the movie were re animated for this but then you can tell some of the scenes were just transferred poorly because they were still a little grainy how I remembered them to be. There are no special features whatsoever which made me really sad considering this month is 20 years of Pokmon you would think they would include SOMETHING, anything really and I would've been ok with but no. This set get 4 Stars because the movies made me emotional as always, and it was great to hear the original voice of your favorite Pokmon Trainer Ash Ketchum.",1455580800,,932,4.301136363636363

Look if I had know I was just getting the movies and nothing else I think $40 is not worth the price.

The only good thing that comes from is that the movies look amazing in HD and that there are no longer cropped.

7575514,2,B019GE15PY,"The picture are these 3 films look fantastic, the case looks fantastic, the disc art looks fantastic, the movies vary, but the lack of effort in Blu-Ray extras is an insult! When people buy a Blu-Ray they should expect extras on the disc and not have be worried that we will get nothing...especially in a Limited Edition Steelbook Blu-Ray set. Not only did we get no extras on the discs, but we didn't even get a little sleeve or special booklet in the case. There is really nothing very special about this set other than the case and the HD movies. I feel the price of this set should be no higher than $19.99.

I have the first 2 movies on their original DVD releases and they both included extras. There is no reason that a Blu-Ray in 2016 has no extras when a DVD released in 1999 or 2000 had several extras and a better menu.

As for the movies themselves, here is a quick spoiler Free review:

1st movie- My favorite of the 3 and I really enjoy this one. My girlfriend's kids are really into Mew and Mewtwo so watching this movie with them was a blast and it held up fine even after all of these years. Mewtwo does a great job as being the lead villain.

2nd movie- My least favorite of the 3 as I feel too much focus is put on Ash and Lugia's usage comes across as strange to me. However this is my girlfriend's favorite of the 3.

3rd movie- This one is a fun movie, with the return of a fan favorite Pokmon! You get some good battle action in this one and the storyline is pretty good. We all liked it.

Sadly I should also point out that the Pikachu shorts are not included on this set.

I don't recommend this set to fans unless it is the only way you can see these movies. I suggest get their original DVD releases or wait for this to have a price drop.",1455148800,29,1765,4.143274853801169

We knew before it released that there was a chance it did not contain the Pikachu short movies because they weren't listed in the description.  I was disappointed  but not surprised to find out that what I thought would happen was exactly the case.  The Pikachu short films were a huge part of the viewing experience.  Not only that, but other reviewers have pointed out that these movies are not as high quality as they could be.  I feel like the steel case and the supposed ""blu-ray"" quality are just cover-ups for the lack of effort that was put into the production of this set.  If I wanted half-baked copies of these movies, I would get a pirated copy for half the price.  I was excited about this release because these are some of my favorite movies from childhood.  Unfortunately, I feel a large part of these movies is missing without including the Pikachu shorts.  Getting the original DVDs is expensive and tricky because there are so many pirated copies flooding the market and real copies in good shape are rare, but if this set didn't preserve the original experience of the films, I think I will go through the trouble of finding the original DVDs (even if their quality was also questionable.)  I wouldn't have cared if they charged a bit more and included the short movies.  As it stands, a good copy of just one original DVD costs about the same as this set but I still would rather pay more for the whole experience.  I'm holding out as of now.  The only way that I'm going to bother with this is if they either release the Pikachu shorts separately (and for a reasonable price) or if they release another set that includes everything.",1455062400,,1693,4.508196721311475

7575525,4,B019GE15PY,"First, a little rant to explain the perspective from which I reviewed this set.
When these films were initially released on DVD in the US they had been thoroughly butchered during the localization process.  DVD was a somewhat new format back in 1999, but even then studios were planning for the future, releasing most films in anamorphic widescreen to preserve their original aspect ratio.  An unfortunate stigma at the time, however, was that widescreen kids' films had to be cropped to 4:3, and animated films in general had to have horrifically over-saturated colors to achieve wide appeal.  This is why I procured copies of the Japanese releases alongside the U.S. DVDs.  I even went so far as to attempt transplanting the English Dub over top of the widescreen color-correct Japanese video to get the films that _should_ have been released here - but even that effort was stymied by the fact that the people who adapted the movies were apparently so desperate to make their mark that they inexplicably moved scenes around and changed plot points, so much that the audio tracks would not line up.  This is particularly egregious in Revelation Lugia a.k.a. ""Pokemon the Movie 2000"" where they found it necessary to change the entire central theme of the film to it's polar opposite. (::::Begin Spoiler:::: In the original film, the central theme was that no matter who, someone would fulfill the role of the hero - it could have been anyone but just happened to be Satoshi (Ash), but in the U.S. release they emphasized that Ash alone could have fulfilled that role - the theme ""The Power of One"" was antithesis to the original plot of the film ::::End Spoiler::::)  I guess since it was a kids' movie no one was supposed to notice or care if they took liberties.

When I saw this was slated to come out on Blu-ray, I was thrilled because it was an opportunity for at least some of my biggest gripes about the original DVD releases to be fixed.  The results, however, are a bit of a mixed bag.

This is without doubt the most bare-bones Blu-ray release I have ever seen.

What they got right:
The films are finally presented in their original widescreen aspect ratio.
The HD transfer makes this the clearest version of these films I've seen since watching them in the theater.
Unlike the last Pokemon Blu-ray release, each film comes on its own disc.
It comes in a really nice Steelbook case.
The animated menus are done well.

What they got wrong:
The Pikachu's Vacation, Pikachu's Rescue Adventure, and Pikachu and Pichu short films were not included.  In fact, there are no extras of any kind - no trailers, no commentary, no interviews.  The menu consist of ""Play"" and ""Scene"" and that's it.
The soundtrack is 2.0 stereo - which is a step back from the 5.1 DD tracks on the original DVD releases. (And a real shame because the 5.1 DVD soundtrack for Mewtwo Strikes Back took real advantage of the technology - I used to use it as a reference disc if you can believe it.)
No subtitles.
No alternate languages.  The original Japanese soundtrack would have been a nice addition.  It would have required the use of branching to play the scenes in the correct order according to the language, but that's exactly why Blu-ray was designed with the capability to do it.
While the picture quality is much clearer than the DVD releases, the colors are still clearly oversaturated (although not as badly) and very little appears to have been done to clean up the film - film grain and specs are prevalent throughout.

I was really hoping that given most of the kids who saw this movie when it was first released are adults now, this release would have been more geared towards those of us who view these films with a degree of nostalgia, but clearly the publisher is still marketing to kids and still thinks kids ""don't know any better.""

It probably seems like I'm very down on this release, but I'm not.  It's a bit overpriced for what you get, but I have a feeling that it was a miracle it was released at all and I'm glad to have it in my collection, there's just a lot of unrealized potential here.",1454976000,142,4099,4.630344827586207

This version is a re-release of the first three movies on Blu-Ray & DVD in its original theatrical widescreen format. You get the complete, uncropped footage of the Pokemon movies the way it was meant to be seen!

Video: The footage you see in this version is from the remastered ""HIGH DEFINITION"" films that was done by the Pokemon Company years ago in Japan, although you get English title cards, English credits, and the same EDITED version of all three movies. Note: the quality isn't TRUE HIGH DEFINITION, it is an upscale from the standard source.

The image isn't much of an upgrade, to be honest. Although the colors are slightly brighter and the image is a bit cleaner, the previous Warner Bros. edition was a sharper - not much of a difference from this new version but it was noticeable to me, especially if you are a videophile like me.

So if you don't have the previous out of print version, or if it's damaged/lost, then you may want to purchase this one. If you are a collector and must have every version that there is out there, WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR?! GRAB IT NOW! Otherwise, it really isn't worth the ""upgrade"".

Audio: This is the most disappointing thing. For some reason the audio was downgraded to 2.0 stereo mix (the Warner Bros. version had 5.1 audio). Meanwhile the Australian re-release version for the first two movies has 5.1 audio and 2.0 for the third movie. By the way, there are no director's commentary tracks or any other languages.

Subtitles/Caption: The back of the cover says it was English subtitles but there are NONE ON THE SOURCE.

Menus:
The menus for the DVD version are still images with just two buttons: PLAY and SCENES. The same goes for the Blu-Ray version but there are a few moments of the movie that you get to see before it goes to the still motionless menu.
- The scenes menu is just just simple as well, 14 chapters that are numbered and that is it! (The number of chapters varies per movie)

Here are images of the menus:

Extras: None on the source! There are no Pikachu Shorts, although it is stated in the description of the listing that the Pikachu Shorts are included. I suggest you buy a cheap version of the Warner release, and if you already have it then keep it.

7575528,3,B019GE15PY,"As others have noted, this release is missing the short ""Pikachu's Vacation."" It has been included since the theatrical release in EVERY version of Pokemon: The First Movie. I am dismayed that VIZ Media neglected to release the short. I encourage everyone to contact VIZ and let them know of your dissatisfaction with the decision not to include ""Pikachu's Vacation."" I have already contacted Viz and voiced my displeasure, and will update this review if I receive a reply. You can reach them at VIZ.com. At the top of the screen is a Feedback button, just click it and let them know you're dissatisfied.

Otherwise, the set looks good. It comes in a nice case, it has great picture quality. I would rate it higher if the First Movie were complete.",1454976000,,748,4.709923664122138
7575529,2,B019GE15PY,"The entirety of Mewtwo's origin was cut from Pokemon the First Movie.  None of the Pikachu shorts are included. The remaster looks good enough  (english title cards were clearly slapped in as is though) and we finally have a proper 16:9 release of these movies but it's a shame that America still doesn't have a complete version of the first film.

No special features only ""Play"" and ""scenes"" options.",1454976000,2,402,4.797101449275362
7575530,5,B019GE15PY,The first 3 Pokemon movies are my favorite and I've been waiting a long time for them to be remastered in Blu-ray format. Can't wait to add this in my collection and enjoy these wonderful stories! I was never a fan of the shorts at the beginning the movies so I personally don't care that they are not included. You will want to knock off start if that is something you were looking forward to.,1454976000,,394,4.266666666666667
7575531,2,B019GE15PY,"Having grown up with the Pokemon franchise, it had been disappointing that the earlier movies in the series were never released to home video in widescreen, always in a cropped fullscreen. With this release, we finally get the first three movies presented in widescreen, but sadly, at a cost of virtually everything else.

The movies themselves look good, at least as well as animated movies nearly twenty years old can look. They have been cleaned up a bit for the blu-ray release, but don't expect restoration on the level of Disney here. They were movies made on a budget, and it still shows, with some fuzzy lines and a bit of artifacting, though admittedly looking better than previous DVD releases.

The first feature, Mewtwo Strikes Back, is still difficult to sit through, with a lot of strange editing on the part of the dubbing team.  The second feature, The Power of One, fares quite a bit better, with some good jokes and clever moments, but still feels like a leftover plot from a video game, with Ash having to collect three trinkets to stop a catastrophe. And you'll be hard pressed to find a Pokemon fan who won't agree that the third feature, Spell of the Unown, is by far one of the best movies in the franchise, with a great, interesting plot and some sincerely touching moments.

While that takes care of the movies themselves, what about the extras? Sad to say, there are none. The commentaries and bonus features from previous DVD releases have been removed entirely, but by far the most egregious omission is the removal of the Pikachu mini-movies that would play before the feature. It's bizarre that they would be removed, considering they were considered part of the film itself, and it's not like there was space lacking on a BLU-RAY. To add insult to injury, the credits for the mini-movies still roll at the end of the feature film. Not cool, TPCI, not cool.

In the end, you get a cleaned up widescreen presentation for the main feature films, but in exchange you lose the extras and mini-movies of previous DVD releases. You'll have to decide for yourself if it's worth the trade-off.",1454889600,,2115,4.720867208672087
