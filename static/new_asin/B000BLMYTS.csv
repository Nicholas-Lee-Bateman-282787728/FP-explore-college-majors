8088684,5,B000BLMYTS,"I actually saw this presentation at Women of Faith.. It changed my world.. Being a women that has gone through a double mastectomy, it really gave me insight and made me feel okay with how I was feeling and what I had gone through... Nicole Johnson is AMAZING...  I loaned my copy of the DVD to a women who was diagnosed with Breast Cancer and never got it back... Sad to say I had met many more in my journey.  I know any one that watches this will not have a dry eye but will have a new awareness to what you or your loved ones are going through.. I am just glad that we do not walk alone... Thanks for being there for your loved ones....",1396224000,,640,4.031496062992126

8088686,5,B000BLMYTS,"There are actually three different presentations on this dvd, I bought it for the Stepping into the ring presentation which I had seen before and is amazing, however I watched the other two as well and they are just as good. The Stepping into the ring portion is about surviving cancer, we used it for a hospice training session.",1329955200,,329,4.593220338983051
8088687,5,B000BLMYTS,"I recently viewed Nicole Johnson Live - Stepping into the Ring at a Cancer Coalition meeting.  As a 6 year Breast Cancer Survivor myself, I could relate to all emotions Nicole shares.  I plan to purchase this DVD to share with my local Breast Cancer Support Group.  Warning!  Have a box of tissue handy.  You don't have to be a BC Survivor to feel the emotions in the DVD.

8088688,5,B000BLMYTS,"I have attended the Women of Faith conferences for the past seven years, and had the privilege of seeing Nicole Johnson perform this live.  I was completely devastated by the emotions that it brought up in me, and I am not a victim of Breast Cancer, nor at the time was my mother, who is now a survivor.  I cannot believe how incredible she was to watch perform this.  I was emotionally wrung out after it, and I expect she gives much of herself to do this over and over again.

  If you have breast cancer, or know someone who does, this is an amazing thing to watch.  I would suggest the performance, with the book only as a sidebar, because it's powerful, and I doubt the book can convey her performance.",1128470400,,707,4.3106060606060606
