8324436,5,0615113702,"This video will shock and disgust any American who has listened and believed the US Government hype about the War on Some Drugs. While the US  Government has passed more draconian drug laws, built more prisons, and  stomped on the rights on private citizens, as well as exporting this war to  other countries around the world, they in turn have employed and protected  the likes of Barry Seal, the most prolific drug dealer in US history, that  we know of, and the main subject of this video investigation. Well worth  the asking price, and well worth the taking the time to watch.",966816000,2,581,4.647058823529412
8324437,5,0615113702,"Dan Hopsicker has a genius for dangerous research.  My own well-reviewed history of the drug war, ""Drug War: Covert Money, Power &  Policy,"" owes a lot to Hopsicker's research.  He has, with live  interviews, pierced the veil of secrecy surrounding the CIA's involvement  in drug dealing and assassination.  If you want the truth, on film, you can  get it here, straight from Louisiana, home of Lee Harvey Oswald, David  Ferrie and Barry Seal.  Be prepared for an amazing cast of characters, all  real.",966816000,2,502,4.9397590361445785
