7955022,5,B00005UQ7J,"Despite this string of bad reviews which you see before you, I feel that this movie is the dog's bollocks (Brutal Boxer.)  There is lots of fighting here, and not the goofy, one thousand blocks, somersaulting weird ancient type movie.  I'm talking in your face, no nonsense, don't bring that sorry style in here, goodnight ladies, old fashioned, face breaking type of fighting.  These guys can really throw kicks around and whip much tail.  Yes, it is kind of a repetitive showcase of one guy beating up ten, and to be perfectly honest, those ten guys could really make a better effort to all attack at the same time instead of hopping around while their buddies are getting bodyslammed, and yes the sound is abysmal, and I can't tell who is the bad guy and who is the good guy, but nevertheless these guys are quite acrobatic and kick lots of @$$.  That's all I ask for in a kung fu movie.  Plot, no thanks.  Dialogue, who cares?  Boot to the head?  Yes, please.",1279670400,2,963,4.488505747126437
7955023,4,B00005UQ7J,"Just to give a heads up, ""Shaolin One"" is actually the documentary ""This is Kung Fu"" with a new title. A must see for anyone who really enjoys authentic wushu and the artistry behind Chinese martial arts. The entire DVD is probably worth getting just for this film, but I can only give 3 stars as I have not seen ""Brutal Boxer"" (which is probably also a different movie renamed).
Update: having now seen ""Brutal Boxer,"" I'd have to add a star to my former 3-star review. Although Jackie Chan gets about 3 seconds of screen time, the fights in this basher, especially the last one, are bloody, brutal and pretty exciting. Recommended not for Chan, but for the bone-cracking and eye-popping (literally) dust-ups.",1130976000,,710,4.733870967741935
7955024,2,B00005UQ7J,"Well if you are buying this dvd to see Jackie Chan, don't.  He is a side villian who has nothing to do with the plot and is barely in the movie.  Typical of Groundzero and Black Belt theatre the real title of this film is probably not even ""Brutal Boxer"", it is rare i will give them that.  The audio is especially horrible.  Every time the scene changes from fight to dialogue there is a drastic volume change. Not to mention it is extremely boring and doesn't really feature any special martial art techniques. There is a reason this film is rare and that is because no one wanted you to see it!!! ""Shaolin One"" is the only thing that redeemed this double feature.  Luckily I only paid $4 for this or I would have really felt like I got screwed over.",1128384000,,752,4.267605633802817
7955025,1,B00005UQ7J,"Jackie is not even in the movie!!
I sat for the whole hour and a half just waiting for him to come in and kick someone's but, but it never happens.  the story is one of those late 70's gang films, with so so acting and even worse fights.  horrible.
the other movie ""shaolin one""  is just a documentary on shaolin kung fu.  I actually liked this a lot, but thinking it was gonna be an old jet film i was dissapointed.
Looks like the kung fu retailers pulled another one over our eyes.",1020816000,,483,4.1063829787234045
7955026,5,B00005UQ7J,"At first I thought there was a mistake on the package or the company put the wrong film for Brutal Boxer. I couldn't see Jackie Chan. Then I spotted him-as a villian! This has got to be a first! Jackie is definitely in the film,and he does fight throughout. The second feature has young Jet Li doing some incredoble martial arts. I give this package 5 stars at 2 and a half stars per film.",1018137600,,389,4.2
