8608253,4,B00EPRITA2,"Picture quality and videography excellent. Sound very good; would like the solo vocalists to have a little more prominence, but perhaps Bach intended it this way. Have issues with the the menu system on the Blu-ray disc; it crashes and/or locks up my player if you go through the menu items too quickly.",1419120000,,303,4.735849056603773
8608254,5,B00EPRITA2,"As one who has long loved this oratorio, I think this is by far the best performance on disks. Beautifully played on period instruments and sung by a small, but effective choir. Heartfelt playing and singing by people who love the music.",1394323200,4,237,4.666666666666667
8608255,5,B00EPRITA2,"This disc was recorded during one performance in December 20 2012. This is worth noting because, unlike many 'live' performances, it has not been stitched together from several 'live' performances and is a genuine one-off performance. Bearing that in mind, the recording is remarkably successful by avoiding distractions such as any hint of audience noise or restlessness. Bach intended it to be a continuous work but performed over a period of six days, one for each cantata over the Christmas period. That replay option may suit many viewers, but the audience on this occasion clearly found the complete six cantatas performed as one continuous work to be a very satisfying experience and listen with rapt attention throughout.

The accuracy of the playing over such an extended time is also a tribute to the skills of the orchestral players and the singers. The trumpets are worth a special mention as the high lying, and often solo writing, of the lead trumpet is especially demanding and Alain De Rudder plays with apparent and consummate ease. Other orchestral soloists worth a special mention are Christine Busch as lead violin, Marcel Ponseele on oboe and Benoit Laurent on the oboe Da Caccia. All of these play with total surety and with first class tonal control, as indeed, do their colleagues as a group.

The small mixed choir also deliver an excellent performance with well modulated tonal control and well balanced part singing. The four soloists, Dorothee Mields (soprano), Damien Guillon (alto), Thomas Hobbs (tenor) and Peter Kooij (bass) make an excellently balanced group on the rare instances when they sing in partnership with each other, but more particularly as soloists. Thomas Hobbs, as the Evangelist, has the key vocal role, and it would be hard to imagine it being better sung and with more conviction. He enhances his impact by singing directly to the audience without one glance at the printed copy held in his hands.

That sort of close familiarity is apparent with all the performers who must have played and sung this work countless times. They are led by Philippe Herreweghe, who as conductor, is completely undemonstrative but clearly intent and absorbed in his role as director. He has a considerable reputation as a renowned conductor of such period works in particular and both the choir and orchestra were founded by him a very long time ago. This underpins the strong feeling of unity of purpose communicated by this performance.

The camera work is detailed and fully involving without being in any way invasive. The imaging itself is totally crisp with excellent colour rendition. The sound is presented in excellently natural DTS 5.1 and stereo. Subtitles are provided in English, German, French and Japanese. The subtitles, if chosen, only leave the screen during repeated passages. The performance is naturally given in German so subtitles are a tremendous help to viewers unfamiliar with German. The booklet gives the text openings to the 66 separate tracks for easy identification.

This is a distinguished production and I would suggest that it makes a most attractive purchase option for anyone interested in this work.

8608256,5,B00EPRITA2,"Philippe Herreweghe and the Collegium Vocale Gent are distinguished Bach interpreters, and have recorded a large portion of the cantatas. On the 20th of December in 2012, they made this live recording of the Christmas Oratorio in Bruxelles (if you're French) or Brussel (if you're Flemish) at the Palais des Beaux-Arts, which is a rather stark venue and with no Christmas garlanding of any kind. The audience at least got to look up and see the large organ pipes, which none of the cameras were able to capture. With the performers all dressed in black, this video looks like it should be one of the passion oratorios, but it sounds like Christmas, anyway. The sixteen singers stand in a semi-circle behind the small orchestra--four female sopranos, one female and three male contraltos, four tenors and four basses. The alto soloist is Damien Guillon, as Michael Chance was for Herreweghe in 1988.
How does this video compare with others? Harnoncourt's 1981 film stands up very well both as video and as audio. The robed boy choirs and abundant decorations give this video a real feeling of Christmas. Beringer filmed in a church in 1991, but for the DVD release the aspect ratio has been cropped to create artificial widescreen, and as a result the motion is choppy. Gardiner filmed in a church in 1999 at the very beginning of his Cantata Pilgrimage, but the audio quality on that DVD is lacking, and it should be remastered.
Crystal Classics just released a Pure Audio Blu-Ray of a 1991 recording, with Ralf Otto conducting the Concerto Kln Vokalensemble Frankfurt and distinguished soloists Ziesak, Groop, Pregardien and Mertens. As for Herreweghe, small forces are used. Both blu-rays have a choice of PCM stereo or DTS HD Master Audio--5.0 for Otto and 5.1 for Herreweghe. I have heard both blu-rays through without complaint, but frankly I would rather see Herreweghe's stark ensemble than stare for 140 minutes at a painting of three camel-riders struggling to arrive in time for the twelfth day of Christmas, the sixth part of the oratorio.
So in my experience the best video is Harnoncourt's from 1981, and the best audio is Harnoncourt's from 2007, but the best all-around video and audio is this Herreweghe blu-ray.

PS -- At the present time, there is a one-star review attached to this blu-ray release, but it clearly states ""Format: DVD"" above the review. Amazon, are you keeping an eye on what your computers are doing? So EuroArts have no blame for whatever it was that the other reviewer watched, which had no subtitles. This blu-ray clearly does, in English, German, French and Japanese.",1386115200,15,2607,4.925
