8424548,5,B004CZZZN6,Good movie. Good cast. Keep an open mind. Don't accept everything you see and hear as the gospel truth. Based on true events.,1498089600,,125,4.478260869565218
8424549,3,B004CZZZN6,"A propagandized film of the KKK, which basically tosses out the whole basket because of a few rotten apples. A similar film could easily be made about the US government, or the FBI, the CIA, the NAACP, the ADL, the SPLC, etc, etc, etc",1422403200,,234,4.340909090909091

8424551,1,B004CZZZN6,"I am not commenting on the production or acting quality of the film but rather the content.  This movie is a lie and I can't believe that thirty some years ago I was shown this movie in US History class.  Gary Thomas Rowe was recruited by the FBI to infiltrate the KKK.  That is the only truth presented.  Then he 'switched sides' and very likely was the one who killed Viola Liuzzo.  In 1978 the federal freedom of information act was passed and the FBI's massive failure in allowing, if not causing the death of Viola Liuzzo would be public.  I'm not a conspiracy nut claiming the gov't made this movie but the timing is convenient and it is an abomination of the real history.  I hope it is not still represented as history in schools or anywhere else.  I have seen the video depositions of the people portrayed here.  It did not happen this way!",1328227200,4,849,4.391025641025641
