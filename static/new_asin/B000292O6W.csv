I got the DVD version. It runs over two hours. And guess what - the first two hours are just him talking. In fact it's all him talking. The guy just loves to talk. He pokes fun at long Ericksonian inductions (with some justification) and says that one of the great things with a Dave Elman induction is that it's so quick. So you wonder why he offers a 150-minute  DVD on a two-minute induction. The answer is simple; it's so that he can talk for the other 148 minutes.

Then he tells us that he does a 40-minute pretalk with patients. No doubt followed by an hour's talk and then a three hour posttalk and a five hour summary talk.

He tells you not to worry about the sound or video quality as he is doing the recording in his office during a snowstorm. Then we see some footage of the snowstorm.

Finally, when he gets down to some demonstration with a couple of victims, the footage is sub-70s porno quality. He has Tchaikovsky's Pathetique Symphony playing in the background; if that doesn't get the depressives to slit their wrists, nothing will, beautiful music though it is.

Incredibly, he never actually gives you a clear demonstration of how to the actual induction. You never get more than a few seconds of footage without him pausing it and talking some more.

A couple of clips appear twice, and there's even a surreal 1-second clip of a woman in a red dress looking a bit confused and sitting on a park bench. Maybe she's the only one of his victims who ever escaped.

What I find amazing is that he is obviously not a young man, yet nobody has killed him before now. He probably has a 15-hour talk pre-recorded ready for his funeral.

The reason I have given it two stars instead of one is that some of the stuff about Dave Elman is quite interesting, though most of it's in Elman's book.

I intend to get the DVDs by Cal Banyan and Gil Boyne. At least there'll be some action and less talk.",1209600000,,1996,4.384823848238482
8324824,4,B000292O6W,"I was lucky to buy this Video Tape, I would have missed so much had I not bought this tape. Malik is an excellent teacher, you can't miss a thing with him delivering a lecture. Each step has been explained beautifully. There is so much information in this program and yet you remember every step he tells you. Now I can Hypnotize anyone after watching this video, but I did extensive home work before attempting to Hypnotize someone.",1089244800,2,433,4.564102564102564

The Program is about two hours and thirty minutes long, and I felt tired but something kept me glued to the seat, may-be I was Hypnotized. In fact I tried it on one of my friends the same evening. I did not do bad for the first timer!",1085875200,5,396,4.293333333333333
