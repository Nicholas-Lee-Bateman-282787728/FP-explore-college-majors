8745687,5,B019PIK2CI,I have become a huge fan of Ruth Etting.  She was a true master of styling the phrasing of her songs.  I have thouroughly enjoyed listening to this CD and to get all of these songs for this price is terrific!  This has given me many hours of enjoyment.,1510272000,,252,4.1020408163265305
8745688,5,B019PIK2CI,"Yes, it's one track. Yes, the audio quality is variable (though given the timeframe of the recordings, likely as good as could be expected). Yes, there is no listing of songs, dates, what-have-you. Yes, most DVD and Blu-Ray players throw up their hands in disgust when asked to play this disk. Yes, all of these complaints (and more) are perfectly valid. BUT... It's 10+ hours of Ruth Etting recordings, some of them extremely rare. It's $20! How much would it cost to accumulate all of this music on my own? The mind boggles... And it plays perfectly using VLC on my Windows 10 computer. On balance, I can't complain. Basically, it's a 10:25:45 Ruth Etting ""mix tape"", and I am perfectly happy with it.",1499731200,,703,4.67741935483871
8745689,1,B019PIK2CI,"This DVD is beautifully packaged and the idea of obtaining all of Ruth Etting's recordings is very appealing.  HOWEVER, there is a major problem.  The songs are all on one track lasting more than 10 hours and, not only is there no list of the titles, but it is impossible to choose a specific song.  You would think that one could do this on computer but I finally gave up after trying without success.  I can't imagine anyone being happy with this product.",1475798400,,457,4.469879518072289
8745690,5,B019PIK2CI,I didn't read the description correctly and didn't realize I was only buying audio material.  I was hoping to get some Etting material I didn't have.,1458432000,,149,4.730769230769231
