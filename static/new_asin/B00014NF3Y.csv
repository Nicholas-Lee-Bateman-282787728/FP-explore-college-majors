8173625,3,B00014NF3Y,I am a Wang Tao fan and I love this movie. The fighting has a great style to it and the picture is clear. The story is great except one section that was a bit confusing. You will recognize some other exellent actors like Lo Leih from (five fighters of Death) and Meng Fei from the (Prodigal Boxer).  And 2 good looking ladies. One of the ladies star on (Ninja Massacre)as a bling fighter.,1086739200,,388,4.243243243243243
