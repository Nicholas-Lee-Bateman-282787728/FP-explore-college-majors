8090062,5,B000BO8YXA,"I was the Producer of PUMP IT! WITH DAVID ENGEL, M.D. in 1983.  At that time, VCRs were becoming popular and people were going to gyms, paying personal trainers big buck$.  The idea was to deliver professional fitness training from a bodybuilder who was both a medical doctor and, at that time, a sports medicine specialist.  David Engel, M.D., was the perfect person to do this instructional video, at a time just before the Jane Fonda Workout videos became popular.  Dr. Engel has remained a good friend over the years, and this instructional video was both the first of its kind and the first to deliver professional bodybuilding/weight training to the home video market.
