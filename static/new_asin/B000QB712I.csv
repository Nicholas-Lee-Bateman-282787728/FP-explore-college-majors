The series have been done brilliantly that if you're a korean, or if you know how to speak the language, maybe this is such a beautiful story and movie, that's why its very disappointing when you see a rubbish translation, it destroyed the whole story.",1272931200,,443,4.469135802469136

8195303,5,B000QB712I,"I searched hi and low for this one.  I had the chance to see most of this series on AZN TV - cable.  I had missed a few episodes from the beginning, and just had to have this in my collection.  It is a wonderful story about a young woman who was an artist down in her soul.  I could not fathom anyone who enjoys historical dramas to find anything but pleasure from watching this series.",1202428800,3,386,4.0394736842105265
