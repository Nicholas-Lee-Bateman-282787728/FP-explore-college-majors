8162289,1,B000LMPMWI,As the picture and sound quality was so poor I found it very hard to enjoy the film as I was constantly straining my eyes and ears. I bought this as it was the only version available at the time.,1366156800,,195,3.9
8162290,3,B000LMPMWI,"""Private Eye Blues"" is a quirky film from the mid-nineties, and an apt reflection of the pre-Handover jitters sweeping through Hong Kong at the time.  Iconic singer Jacky Cheung is able once again to mine his own working class background for a fine performance as a down and out private detective who suddenly finds himself way out of his depth as a reluctant protector of a truly strange and annoying young woman.  There is plenty of action in the way of fights and chases, but the story really is about how the exhaustingly perky damsel in distress helps a very emotionally disconnected Cheung reconnect with his family.  While the film is enjoyable, it is not a classic, yet it has remained high on the ""want list"" of Hong Kong films simply because it has remained unavailable (and therefore unseen by many) for so long.  Now it has finally been released on DVD by Tai Seng after more than 15 years, but it's a case of ""too little too late.""  Assuming that Tai Seng acquired the rights to release it, they couldn't have produced something that looks more like a pirated disc if they tried.  There is no menu, no options, no special features, nothing but a mediocre transfer of the theatrical release from an indifferent source (probably the 1996 laser disc).  The subtitles, in Chinese and English, are printed on the film, just as was done in the cinemas, and the quality is surprising poor for what is supposed to be a commercial product.  This is definitely not worth the price, unless you are desperate to have this film on DVD in any condition and at any cost.",1355788800,2,1568,4.615107913669065
