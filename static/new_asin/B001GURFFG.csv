8307209,4,B001GURFFG,"From director Umberto Lenzi (CANNIBAL FEROX, NIGHTMARE CITY), VIOLENT NAPLES follows Inspector Betti (Maurizio Merli) as he returns to Naples in order to hunt down a vast collection of scumbags, low-life thugs, and other assorted ne'er-do-wells. His quest leads him into the darkest, most depraved depths of the drug-fueled underworld, where he uses a little police brutality to take care of the odious criminal element. As crime thrillers go, VN is very good. It's hero (Merli) is tough, brave, and unstoppable on his mission to shut down the mob. The bad guys are quite colorful, in a vile sort of way. My favorite scene involves two of these psycho-crooks who pick the wrong people to rob, and get a royal beat-down! One of them even winds up dead! Hilarious! Also, the scenes of motorcycles roaring through the streets of Naples are exhilarating! Co-stars John Saxon (BLACK CHRISTMAS, BEYOND EVIL, BLOOD BEACH, A NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET, TENEBRE) as a seemingly mild-mannered businessman, who's making deals w/ a mafia kingpin known as ""O Generale"" (Barry Sullivan!). Awesomeness indeed...",1405900800,,1093,5.1807909604519775
