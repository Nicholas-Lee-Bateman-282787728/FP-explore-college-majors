3144966,5,B0015I2S0G,"Simon, King of the Witches
Directed by Bruce Kessler. Written by Robert Phippeny, 1971

This film has several levels of meaning. Superficially it appears to be a stylish excursion through the Southern California psychedelic pop-culture era of self-styled warlocks and witches circa 1970. This was a time when magick was in the air and even the mundane world had a mysterious shimmer and sparkle. There will never be a time quite like it again - And for those of us caught in the spell of that bygone era, Southern California was the Land of Oz.
  You can recapture the flavor and mystery of that now-ancient time and faraway place with the excellent DVD reissue of the 1971 film Simon, King of The Witches. How do I know this? Because according to urban myth, I was the real-life (if any of our lives at that time could be called ""real"") model for the character of Simon Sinistari, the Hollywood warlock in the film.
  Now that requires some qualification: I never lived in a storm drain, I never performed an 11th degree operation (gay sex magick), and I never killed anybody, but other than that, how many black bearded, cigar smoking, wine drinking, witch-bashing, self-proclaimed mighty wizards were there prowling the streets of Hollywood during the 1969-70 years?  I ask this question because, in the excellent commentaries included in this reissue, both the actor Andrew Prine and the director Bruce Kessler state that screen writer Robert Phippeny was himself ""a warlock"" and the model for his own character. If this is true I will be more than happy to concede Simon's tarnished crown to Phippeny----but I would like to know where he was while we were ""doing his thing.""
  The general consensus among the ""old guard"" (some of us did survive!) is that Robert Phippeny was at least a first-hand observer and a student of ""The Black Arts."" He kept a low profile, whereas I did not. He may have used another name on the street. Many of us did. He had obviously read Aleister Crowley and Franz Bardon (putting him light years ahead of most witches in the magick department). The ""magick"" depicted in Simon comes closer to actual practice than anything previously shown on the screen----or subsequently for that matter. But just to be picky we should point out that there is no such thing as an ""effluvial condenser"" although effluvium is an appropriate ingredient for certain ""fluid"" condensers which could be charged sexually but would then have to be applied to the magick mirror, not hung over it as in the film. However this error may have been intentional in order to achieve a more dramatic effect. Phippeny's knowledge of Bardon on sex magick is apparent in the colors of Simon's and Linda's ceremonial robes: Simon wears blue and Linda wears red, reversing the polarities to create a dynamic interchange
(see Initiation into Hermetics page 247 or 308 in the 2nd edition).
 But we still want to know just what astrological aspect Simon was trying to exploit in his major magical working set for 1:33 p.m.?
 Robert Phippeny certainly did his homework, but don't try to use Simon as a training film anymore than you would use Saving Private Ryan as a guide to actually saving Private Ryan.
 Beyond all the technical expertise demonstrated in the film we have what I consider a very good story---perhaps too good, and certainly too deep for the market the distributors appealed to. Director Bruce Kessler laments this in his commentary. The screen play is witty, sharp and well-crafted, although it gets a bit confusing in the end, obviously due to budget and time constraints. With all the limitations and the brief production time, Kessler and as his crew were really trying to make a meaningful film. Along that line I should point out that the novelized version of Simon, King of the Witches (Dell 1971) is an excuse for hack pornography by ""Baldwin Hills"" (name taken from a Southern California community) and serves only to remind the aspiring screen writer never to permit any novelized version of his work over which he has no control.
 So, if Robert Phippeny is still out there somewhere, here's a five-star review from ""the old guard."" Let's hear from you. Same goes for Andrew Prine and Bruce Kessler. You gave us a terrific memorial to our personal, funky, trippy, long-gone Land of Oz.
  But perhaps the biggest unsolved mystery in Simon, King of the Witches are the identities of its stars? I always thought Andrew Prine and Brenda Scott had top billing. Who are Allyson Ames and Norman Burton?

3144967,3,B0015I2S0G,"Simon, the witch of 1971 L.A., is sincere and capable, but only manages to
move his headquarters from a cubbyhole in a storm drain to a rented
basement space during this bizarre tale.  Most of his focus is to bring
down a poseur (who wrote him a bum check), and the police force and D.A.
He name-drops alot of mythical beings, and conjures up a glowing-red
vortex to harm his enemies.  His most entertaining attempt at hexing
involves the unclad participation of fragile and big-eyed Brenda Scott.

The occult yarn gets even stranger when Simon, like Marvel's Dr. Strange,
steps into a Magic Mirror, reeling through a ""2001"" inspired ""psychedelic
light show,"" to try to save Brenda Scott from evil forces.  You couldn't
say things work out too well, but Simon instructs us that ""Death is only
temporary.""

Andrew Prine was a wise choice for playing Simon.  He reminded me of the
young Ian Anderson of ""Jethro Tull"" fame, in looks and insouciant manner.
Another possible model was Niall MacGinnis as conjurer Karswell in the
1957 ""Night of the Demon.""  Prine's occult line-readings were much like
those of MacGinnis--could Simon be Karswell's long-lost American son?

I won't repeat and thus detract from the other positive reviewer's comments on this movie.  However, as a fan of the sci-fi/horror genres I had read about this movie but never expected it to be released on DVD.

After receiving it I watched it three times to catch all of the overt and subtle nuances and then watched the special features featurette ""Simon Says"" with actor Andrew Prine.  The result?  I found this movie to have a clear objective and to show another side of ""witchcraft"" departing from the stereotypical with an understandable storyline requiring only minimal ""suspension of disbelief.""

Released in 1971, this movie was cast in the days before computer generated special effects (FX) were conceived (obviously!).  However the effects that were created and used are well done and successfully incorporated into the frames.  The performances of Andrew Prine (Simon) and the supporting actors and actresses were professional and consistent with the better movies of period.

I thought the film photography was clear and professionally produced and perhaps only borders on the line between a ""B"" and ""A"" rated movie at worst.  At best, it is an exemplar of the genre that could be believed and that makes for a good movie!  As director Bruce Kessler stated in an interview the downfall of the movie was that ""it was not marketed and sold properly.""  I agree with him.  If it was, it might have risen to a higher level of film acclaim.

Regardless, ""Simon - King of the Witches"" is a worthwhile 99 minute trip into the occult and bizarre that may keep you coming back for more.  Although thirty-seven years old at the time of this writing I rate ""Simon"" at 5 stars.  Get it for Halloween and view with an open mind. You won't be disappointed!

3144977,5,B0015I2S0G,"- Review of Simon, King of the Witches -

This review refers to the VHS version. I will update this as soon as I get the DVD.

In general, if you aren't into the occult scene then this movie probably won't make too much sense to you  - like previous reviewers have stated - as there are too many ""in"" jokes.  But if you like ""B"" grade movies that have `overthrowing the corrupt establishment' as part of the plot (by Magickal means no less), then this could be an interesting movie for you.

The events portrayed take place in Southern California (and not San Francisco as some have stated - see the reviews for the VHS version), around 1971 and the tone and style is very late sixties.  In the movie Simon is living in a storm drain for reasons that are unclear, but it may be that Simon has no interest in material things.  All Simon is interested in is his Magickal art and the end result, becoming a God himself.  As it turns out, the Gods are jealous and keep their power to themselves by means that are craftier than we mere mortals can imagine.

There is a Wikipedia entry for this movie that has this statement:

""The character of Simon Sinestrari was reputedly based on the public persona of the ceremonial magician and occult author Poke Runyon, a well-known figure in the Southern California Neopagan scene at that time.  Runyon himself acknowledges the likeness, and has said that the only major inaccuracy is that he ""never lived in a sewer"""".

In the movie Simon visits a Coven of witches in Pasadena.  At the time, the best-known ""coven"" in Pasadena was the ""First Church of Tiphareth"" operated by Sara Cunningham (aka ""Lady Sara"").  Though the movie pokes good-humored fun at her, she did not take it too well, even though several members of her group went to see the movie and found it all quite humorous.

There are several interesting plot twists where Simon makes a prediction that he doesn't realize involves him as well.  Then there is the vision he has when he is inside of his Magick Mirror that he doesn't understand the full implications of, until too late.

One of the reasons I like this movie is because it portrays the ideas of Western Magickal thinking, as I understand it, better than any other movie that I can think of at the moment.  By contrast, I was somewhat disappointed with the `Harry Potter' movies on this point.

In summary I thought it was a good movie and well acted.  But you have to take into account that it was low budget and done in the seventies.  Therefore you should not compare it to mega buck modern movies.  If you can do that amount of ""suspension of disbelief,"" then you can enjoy this movie.

In general, if you aren't into the occult scene then this movie probably won't make too much sense to you  - like previous reviewers have stated - as there are too many ""in"" jokes.  But if you like ""B"" grade movies that have `overthrowing the corrupt establishment' as part of the plot (by Magickal means no less), then this could be an interesting movie for you.

The events portrayed take place in Southern California (and not San Francisco as some have stated - see the reviews for the VHS version), around 1971 and the tone and style is very late sixties.  In the movie Simon is living in a storm drain for reasons that are unclear, but it may be that Simon has no interest in material things.  All Simon is interested in is his Magickal art and the end result, becoming a God himself.  As it turns out, the Gods are jealous and keep their power to themselves by means that are craftier than we mere mortals can imagine.

There is a Wikipedia entry for this movie that has this statement:

""The character of Simon Sinestrari was reputedly based on the public persona of the ceremonial magician and occult author Poke Runyon, a well-known figure in the Southern California Neopagan scene at that time.  Runyon himself acknowledges the likeness, and has said that the only major inaccuracy is that he ""never lived in a sewer"""".

In the movie Simon visits a Coven of witches in Pasadena.  At the time, the best-known ""coven"" in Pasadena was the ""First Church of Tiphareth"" operated by Sara Cunningham (aka ""Lady Sara"").  Though the movie pokes good-humored fun at her, she did not take it too well, even though several members of her group went to see the movie and found it all quite humorous.

There are several interesting plot twists where Simon makes a prediction that he doesn't realize involves him as well.  Then there is the vision he has when he is inside of his Magick Mirror that he doesn't understand the full implications of, until too late.

One of the reasons I like this movie is because it portrays the ideas of Western Magickal thinking, as I understand it, better than any other movie that I can think of at the moment.  By contrast, I was somewhat disappointed with the `Harry Potter' movies on this point.

In summary I thought it was a good movie and well acted.  But you have to take into account that it was low budget and done in the seventies.  Therefore you should not compare it to mega buck modern movies.  If you can do that amount of ""suspension of disbelief,"" then you can enjoy this movie.

8258598,5,B0015I2S0G,"Really odd movie. I have been looking for this movie for years since I saw it on late night TV. It take magic/supernatural seriously without any camp. It is not a titillating horror film, but a exploration of magic that leads to the darkness that hubris can bring out in anyone...and it expresses it though magic as the practice as religion see in its times. I  know some wiccans and pagans and this is one of the few movies that takes their beliefs seriously and not salaciously. It is also an artifact of its time as well as a rare non-offensive movie with magic that was not intended as a fantasy, just another belief system like any other.",1517356800,,643,4.4491525423728815

It's probably not destined to become a cult classes but people who like the offbeat and unusual will probably enjoy it.",1386979200,3,388,4.608695652173913
