8734171,4,B015OVC1CO,"Nice change of pace from the typical American Christmas Movie  If you are familiar with the Bible then you will understand the pharse ""And A Child Shall Lead Them"" Born under the Christmas Star, Noelle believes she has the gift to perform miracles, so when conniving developer McKerrod threatens her peaceful life she and her friends determine to use this gift to thwart his plans and save their village. with the Bible you will understand when I say ""And a Child Shall lead them"" .  This film is short and sweet.  If you h ave a chance to view it to advantage of the opportunity",1471910400,2,579,4.495238095238095

You can tell that everyone involved was truly committed to the project.
Highly recommended.",1449792000,3,165,5.384615384615385
8734175,1,B015OVC1CO,"The acting in this as bad as it can get, even the veteran actors are bad. People who purchase this must realize this is an experimental piece that was used as a training device for young people with little to no acting experience. The case is made that it was supposed to help them with their acting and technical work. However, the veteran actors are so bad that I would wonder how much the young ones learned.",1449619200,2,411,4.35064935064935
