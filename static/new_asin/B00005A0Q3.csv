7934692,2,B00005A0Q3,"I hesitated on this purchase because of the mostly bad reviews but thought maybe I would receive a clean DVD, not the case.  It was so out of focus at times that it was difficult to distinguish faces, let alone details.  Both short stories had the potential to be interesting given they were set in the time when Hollywood was a glamourous place.  (I always enjoy the nostalgic feeling the cars, costumes and sets provide.)  Plus both stories dropped off as if they ran out of film, just like many reviewers stated. Could NOT hold a candle to movies such as Chinatown, LA Confidential or Mulholland Falls. Sending it back...",1353283200,,624,4.6454545454545455
7934693,1,B00005A0Q3,"The movie was somewhat blurred and seemed to clear up later in the movie, I bought the movie for the actor Michelle Pfeiffer, wanted to see if it was good or not. In my opinion, I thought it was bad, would not pay to see a movie like this.  I now have all the movies she ever made some forty, only about three or four were worth viewing more than once.  Her role in The Faboulous Baker Boys was by far the best, the rest were not worth viewing more than once some of which were absolutely BRUTAL to get through.",1262995200,,511,4.0495049504950495
7934694,2,B00005A0Q3,"The title POWER, PASSION AND MURDER cannot be found anywhere at imdb. That's because this really isn't a movie at all-- it's a bizarre shuffling together and extreme shortening of two 56 minute episodes from the brief-lived 1980s PBS series, ""Tales from the Hollywood Hills."" Running time here is about 83 minutes total.

The original chapters were called ""Natica Jackson,"" with Michelle Pfeiffer and Hector Elizondo, and ""A Table at Ciro's,"" with Darren McGavin and Stella Stevens. Tossing these two completely unrelated stories together makes for (as you can imagine) a good deal of confusion.

The Pfeiffer episode was originally an adaptation of John O'Hara's story about 1930s Hollywood. Miss Pfeiffer is an actress (typecasting!) in love with a very married man. McGavin's entry was scripted by Budd Schulman. Here, he's a studio head fallen on hard times who invites some actors for dinner at a fancy nightspot.

After working hard to follow these two sandwiched tales, the whole miasma simply ends, leaving startled and disappointed viewers with no resolution or conclusion. Everything suddenly STOPS, just like this revi........",1250985600,16,1137,5.340782122905028
