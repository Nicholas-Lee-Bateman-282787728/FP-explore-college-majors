8054666,4,B0007ZEOS2,"OK, anime has some great and inspiring sports titles--Princess Nine comes to mind--and this is quite inspiring in places.  I want to give this a 3.5, but a 3 would be too petty, so a 4 it gets from here.

Frankly, Japanese and basketball go together like strawberries and mustard.  Too often have I seen a 5'9"" Japanese high school (or even junior high school or even a *female* junior high school) student dunk all over the place.  Sorry, but I subscribe to a few sports magazines, and that just doesn't happen on that island.

So, it's inspiring, and I recommend it for the nice story it tells, but you have to swallow one heck of a lot of disbelief to see dunks and 50-footers from Japanese teenagers.

I like the sports anime stories when they focus on what the Japanese are great at (like baseball) or what they're decent at (like soccer <football>)

Once again, I might be too cruel, but it's amazing when people talk about generations of great Japanese b-ball players; it's like talking about generations of great American badminton players.  Having said that, the USA just won the badminton world championship--albeit with an Indonesian import and a second-generation Indonesian.

Good for them, and good for Hoop Days.",1124928000,,1227,4.777251184834123

If you like Slam Dunk you may want to check this show out since there are enough similarities and differences to make this show worth watching. Even if you hate Slam Dunk you may want to give this show a try since it has a simple but fun storyline, with likeable characters, and some catchy music.  The story begins with Kazuhiko Aikawai an ace basketball player at only 5 ft. 8 inches.  After leading his high school Tendoj high to the National championships Aikawai transfers to Mizuho high.  He decides to go there because he has lost his ability to enjoy playing basketball since his previous school was focused on winning only.

On his first day at Mizuho high school Aikawai learns that Mizuho has a great basketball team; however it the girls basketball team.  The girl's basketball team has gone to the regionals 6 times.  While the boy's basketball team hasn't been active in a long time since the star point guard Fujiwara got into an altercation with the team's former coach.

Since Aikawai loves basketball he is determined to get the boys basketball to become active again; however, the only four players on the boy's basketball team tend to ignore him. This leads Aikawai to end up spending a lot of time playing with the girl's basketball team since the girl's basketball coach thinks he'll be useful in helping the girl's improve their game.  Even though ace player Aikawai's practicing with the girl's basketball team he never acts egotistical while playing with them.  He simply acts politely and has fun. Aikawai also never gives up on getting the boys basketball team to play again regardless of their attitudes towards him.",1120608000,,1805,4.814935064935065
