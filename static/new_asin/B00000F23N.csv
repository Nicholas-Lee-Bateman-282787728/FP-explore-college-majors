7907089,5,B00000F23N,"I am surprised and dismayed to find that, as of this post, The Amazing Mr. Bickford has not been remastered on DVD. Zappa's much inferior film, Baby Snakes, which includes exerpts from Amazing Mr. Bickford, has been released on DVD. I really hope that for the sake of art and awesome Frank Zappa stuff, that this video finds its way onto DVD, or at least some digital version.

I am here with a VHS copy, and the quality has become somewhat degraded over the years. It's still awesome, but it was expensive and it is not as good as having a remastered DVD...",1418947200,,558,4.41747572815534
7907090,3,B00000F23N,I'm looking for the dvd version if it is ever available. The technique and creativity is TRULY AMAZING! I've only seen Mr. Bickford's work through Frank Zappa.,1384128000,,159,4.925925925925926
7907091,5,B00000F23N,"I saw this film once 20 years ago, and I was and still am amazed at the clay mation that's in it.  It's a must-see!",1197676800,,115,3.6
7907092,5,B00000F23N,"A most amazing approach to clay animation.......very very detailed....a wild ride of constant transformations from amorphous shapes to sharp focused scenes and conflicts....be forwarned that the imagery is compelling, but deeply disturbing. The soundtrack, all Zappa, is from the atonal, dissonant orchestral perspective....definitely recommended for fellow artists and musicians.",1102032000,2,380,6.775510204081633
