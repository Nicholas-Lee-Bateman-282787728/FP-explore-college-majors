4428204,3,B004LYWPZE,"This movie wasn't released yet but myself as well as the other performers of The World of Wonders Sideshow has some real inside information on this movie. Out of what we at the World of Wonders (WOW)was in was a blast as we spent two months in New Mexico. The Actors was real pleasent to work with under the conditions we were in, in the particular situations. Although Megan some times appeared like she was on a different planet. When the acting was done she did have her senses. Micky was a well groomed professional in all he did. Us people of the WOW not being professional actors but Entertainers in the American art-form called the sideshow working acts did pretty well. We didn't know at the time that, Poo-Bah a dwarf who has been in many films and movies in his life, it was his last ( he is retired) did his Swan Song of acting not knowing it. The Directing was I thought done great and the camera man did things to his best expectations. As to the finished product, I have not seen yet . But what we were in was I think the main plot to start the fantacy going. As my final review might not say much but I think What judgment I made is an honest one. I believe it is a good investment on the purchase of this movie.",1305072000,3,1227,4.203389830508475

4428207,5,B004LYWPZE,"This is a story about two mens involvement with one woman and a contrast of emotions and behaviour

Mickey Rourke plays Nate Poole, a onetime successful trumpet player in Reno recovering from addiction. He has had a one night stand with a woman whose husband is m a powerful gangster, Happy Shannon (Bill Murray). Shannon has his wife killed and sends one of his men to kidnap and dispose of Nate in the desert. From nowhere, Nate is saved by a group of Indians dressed in white who shoot his abductor. Nate walks on through the desert, and finally arrives at a travelling side show run by a maestro called Sam Adamo (Rhys Ifans). There he wanders among the show and comes upon a beautiful woman with wings (Lily Luster-Megan Fox) on show behind a screen. He invites her for a drink and then suggests she leave and go to Reno with him. The maestro is not happy, and tries to have Nate killed with a snake, but Lily rescues him and they head for Reno in a truck.

Nate has an agenda to use Lily. He calls up Shannon offering to share her freakishness as an attraction to make them both money, but during their journey together, begins to fall in love with her and decides to call it off. However Shannon finds Nate and Lily and takes her for his own ends-more public showing of her and her wings, showing and a sort of mistress in a gilded cage. Nate is determined to rescue her but she is the final rescuer.

Megan Foxs Lily has an almost goddess like quality-both men treat her with a fair amount of respect, given their characters in the film, and both in their own ways put her on a pedestal (literally on her show dais and in the care we do see them show her)-Shannon goes over his own wishes and accepts and respects her demand that Nate not be harmed. Her wings also signal special ability she is the crowd puller, and the resource. She is also the one who really saves, both literally and metaphorically, in the desert and in the final section. She is a little unreal to the point of the last few seconds of the film where we can question whether she was ever really real.

     Murray Rourke and Fox all deliver subtle emotions and big contexts for the human condition. A clever film.",1427846400,,2192,4.3660933660933665

 Rill Murray and Mickey Rourke and their acting abilities come over like two big giants in Passion Play, making a solid backdrop for the newer skills of Megan Fox and Rhys Ifans

 Mickey Rourke makes his character Nate Poole the on edge jazz player, more attractive and acceptable on screen than he might be in a book. You can almost feel his exasperation and hopelessness at times. Bill Murray somehow makes a cold gangster human, by showing him to have a huge sadness and loneliness. Megan Fox as always  looks beautiful, but you are more busy understanding the person she is carefully portraying than being aware of that. Kind of surreal the story, but you follow it because you are following these people and what happens to and between them. Its a slice of USA ( and that could easily be UK, France or any other country) life that you know is around , but don't meet on the day to day . How we treat each other, and what happens because of that, seems  a main idea in the film, can people make good? or save themselves? Dont miss Rhys Ifans barmy controlling show owner-his Welsh raving impresario fits perfectly into the wild of the desert. Yes fascinating, and terrific performances.",1427241600,,1255,4.605381165919282
4428209,5,B004LYWPZE,"I came across this playing on a channel when staying with a cousin in the US and found myself watching it right the way through. Im surprised I hadnt heard of it before, given its three major stars-Mickey Rourke, Megan Fox and Bill Murray.

Its an offbeat tale of Mickey Rourkes character  a down on his luck musician - trying to save himself from a gangster (Bill Murray) who is pursuing him and how he falls in love on the way (Megan Fox). She is in captivity and on show because she happens to have wings. While he feels for her, he sees this as a chance she can be a resource to offer Murray and ensure him his life and freedom, and perhaps he and Murray can profit together from her freakishness.

Murray the gangster turns out to want her for himself, and takes her off to a fine material life but more captivity, while the down on his luck musician is out of the picture and only alive because Lily(Megan Fox) makes it a condition of her involvement with Murray. The rest you must watch for yourself to see how it works out....

I like the way the power shifts between the three of them in unexpected ways, and also the finer emotional touches to the three characters. Could take or leave preferably leave - the gangster stuff and fights, but they don't take over the film. Some brilliant US music and musicians spinning around and funky effects-like the white robed Native Americans who silently and suddenly rescue Rourke at the start of the film. In a funny way its also peaceful to watch in spite of the subject. The characters are all marked with their experiences and unsure here and there, which makes them more real. Yes an interesting film and id watch it again feel there would be a whole lot more to notice the next time.",1427068800,2,1739,4.40809968847352
4428210,5,B004LYWPZE,"At times difficult to make out all the dialogue, but Passion Play gets its story and messages across over and above the medium of language. Visual images and imagery are plentiful-big country and downtown America is no sugarcoated pill. Querky and worth a watch, Rourke, Fox and Murray give us fleshed out characters-who prod gut reactions in us as the story unfolds. Cant stand violence or drugs sequences usually in films but the ones here dilute into a bigger context. Enjoyed Foxs steely determination to escape, Murrays sadness and Rourkes exploration of the life/afterlife/or was it just a dream",1426636800,,601,5.08080808080808
4428211,5,B004LYWPZE,"In Passion Play, Megan Fox goes well beyond her familiar two dimensional role as an action beauty and delves deeply into the persona of a woman who is a freak/handicapped, and put on show because of it. A birth abnormality - real wings - makes her different, and then dependent on and victim to a side show entrepreneur(Rhys Ifans) who takes her around on show with the other singular human beings in his menage. Her development both material and emotional is stunted, and this is how Nate Poole (Mickey Rourke ) findsher. Sherebuffs his attentions, more than used to this from men, but they manage to strike up a genuine communication, and gradually she develops the sense of self needed to challenge her situation.

Although initially shy, she has no problem steering a survival route as Happy Shannons (Bill Murray)decorative accessory, once he has taken her from Rourkes character, and powerfully transmits her suppressed frustration once she becomes victim and captive again to him. The novelty she experiences in being able to explore her own feelings along with her quick learning in crisis situations are lights being turned on in her life , and these power her over and above the meanderings of the men.

She also in saving Rourke- is demonstating selflessness, in complete contrast to themales. Morepowerful just because she is non-strident and cautious, the miracles seem to come to her.

I didn't think , when the film started that it would hold me all the way through, but I was wrong, very wrong. It is worth a watch for the above alone, and there is far more.",1426118400,,1574,4.822222222222222

4428213,2,B004LYWPZE,"Liked this better the second time I saw it, I do love the ending. However the contrast between the young beauty of Megan Fox and the two old guys was just too much to be believable, so from a girl's POV this started to enter strange waters. I also have a hard time picturing Mickey Rourke as anybody but Marv in ""Sin City."" The period, I'm guessing, is the early 60s (pre-Beatles) with the dial phones and beehive hairdos. I also wondered why Nate would pawn his trumpet rather than all the gold jewelry he was wearing.

The cinematography was lovely. It could have been more mystical (I loved the introduction of Megan's character--that was spooky) it could have been more gangster-like, it could have been a comment about the generation gap, it just didn't seem to have a particular story to tell other than exactly what the dialogue was on the surface. It could also have had better pretend-trumpet playing by Rourke. Not only  did he have his back turned most of the time and his breathing was not in synch, but suddenly a piano came in on the soundtrack and you were like where is he hiding? But I think it was meant to represent Lilly's feeling of transport when he played just for her. After all, she was a fan.

I got the feeling Megan Fox kind of hung on to Rourke and Murray because she thinks she ""can't fly"" as an actor, but if anyone saw what a terrific effort she threw herself into in ""Jennifer's Body"" (writer: Diablo Cody),  where she got to make fun of her looks and what people might think she is really like and be a monster and do stunts and really not deal with those issues at all about being ""still"" and ""beautiful"" they would know she can act. She doesn't really have a whole lot to do here till the end but that's how this character is meant to be--there's very little character development for anybody but Nate, and Lilly has to piggy-back those scenes.

Murray makes an amazing bad guy. It was weird for me to see Rourke in a sort of hero role though he is still a deadbeat in this; he didn't QUITE bring off the in-love part but he did seem protective. The blonde was Kelly Lynch, who is married to the director, Mitch Glazer and starred with Matt Dillon in ""Drugstore Cowboy."" Pros: acting and period detail. Cons: the tattoos at the end were rude and out of sync as were the earrings on the ""dark angel"".",1420156800,,2335,4.38337182448037
4428214,5,B004LYWPZE,"Three big screen presences-Mickey Rourke, Bill Murray and Megan Fox , steer a singular thriller story of love, revenge and redemption. This is Mitch Glazes first directing role-he also wrote the script-, and the best thing for me is the message about  love meaning going beyond oneself to do something for  someone else and how big the benefits of that are.

Mickeys character Nate doesnt care about much: we learn that he watched his wife die of addiction, and that she used to get be able to near to him. He has overcome just- his own dependence and is not the musician he was. Meeting and becoming fascinated with Foxs Lily Luster, a woman with wings who is captive to a manic show master(Rhys ifans) triggers caring in him, and their friendship tentatively blossoms, but his selfish intention to use her for his own ends keeps him in a danger zone and causes him to lose this precious connection. We watch him spiral down, and then go beyond that to attempt her rescue.

Along with the two men- (Bill Murray plays minimally but convincingly as a  sad gangster you certainly wouldnt want to meet), Megan Fox delivers a classy performance, and Glazers former time as music journalist ensures an atmopheric and powerful sequence of best US rhythms to underscore the story. Well beyond the ordinary and well worth seeing.",1417046400,,1321,4.751091703056769
4428215,5,B004LYWPZE,"Rhys Ifans  a ringmaster in the middle of the desert? It works, as does his possessive and hyper cameo. Mickey Rourke -The Wrestler - as a vulnerable musician-yes, seen people like this, where addiction has numbed the fine tuned artistic skill. A woman Megan Fox- who struggles to escape her limitations,-physical, economic and psychic? Still, unfortunately, only too familiar. A gang leader who personifies cruelty yet who is only too vulnerable emotionally? Bill Murray leads us along his need, and the respect it provokes for his captive.

The ingredients make for a rich dish, as do the settings. Feels like swimming we are between different realities all the time, but they all link up. Being rescued by a flying angel? Who among us has not at one time felt lucky enough to experience that or pray for it to happen? While these people live weirder than most of us, we recognize the all too human traits.

4428217,5,B004LYWPZE,"This film sees Nate Poole (Mickey Rourke ) rescue Lily Lustre(Megan Fox) a young woman afflicted with wings, from a travelling show run by an eccentric and possesive circus master (Rhys Ifans).Nate has designs on Lily-she will help evade the revenge of a gangster Happy Shannon (Bill Murray) by being a commodity he can offer to Shannon and perhaps share in the business of showing her. Nate has slept with Shannons wife , already killed, so the odds are stacked high against him.

As they travel together a mutual fascination and attraction of opoosites develops-Lily s shy freshness somehow touches Nates not too moral musician trying to hang on to sobriety, although she figures as part of a business deal that will hopefully spare him his life, he feels protective towards her.

Shannon feels the same attraction and wants her for himself, but leaves Nate alone as it is Lly who has struck the deal by demanding his safety in return for her going with Happy. This leaves Nate alive to feel his pain and jealously at losing her, and not being able to get near her.

An attempted rescue mission on his part sees Lily finally doing the saving.

Terrific music, and a range of truly American vistas, both urban and big country, weave in and out of  the story line. In spite of the Nates extreme situation, and Happys implacability, the progress of the story and relationships seems smooth. That it is the woman as active force for salvation amidst downtown dirty dealing is another nice touch, it dilutes all the gangster /violence  sections and rescues it from being a typical heavy energy thriller. The metaphor of flying can be taken in many ways. Highly unusual and effective.",1416441600,,1680,4.775862068965517
4428218,5,B004LYWPZE,"I really liked this-a strange trance like effect throughout the film, which spun through big skies, bright moons and big country as it followed Mickey Rourke-Nate Poole, casual musician and former junkie and his connection with Lily Luster a girl with wings(Megan Fox) from a travelling freak show.

Contrasts abound: Poole is world wise and world weary, Lily is fresh, young shy and nave, yet fierce when the going gets tough. The gangster Happy Shannon, surrounded by mean side-kicks is not at all (happy that is)-hardly surprising, since Nate cheated on him with Nappys wife whom Happy has already dispatched. Nate needs to placate Shannon to save his skin and, although we see him develop a careful tenderness Lily, there is an agenda she will be the bargaining tool for his life-he and Happy can show and manage her together.

No deal-Happy covets Lily and takes her to live in a gilded cage, but she gets her demand that nothing will happen to Nate. They escape and again face with death, she discovers her ability to fly and saves him, sort of.

All performances worked, Bill Murrays emotionless character sends shivers, Rourkes character is still victim to his demons, and Fox glistens in the middle as a symbol of the fresh life force that both men hunger for.

Atmospheric and thought provoking. Highly recommend it!",1415750400,,1326,4.88
4428219,5,B004LYWPZE,"This film Passion Play- is different-you could call it something like a film noir if you are into terminology, but it doesnt just fit into boxes, it goes beyond them. You have a big gamut of human experience, hopelessness/hope, unfeeling/caring, disrespect for others/heeding others and what they ask for, love, friendship, fear/bravery, freedom/dependence, escape/capture, happiness/despair

The emotional interdependence of the three main characters- Rourkes desperate musician, Foxs captive Bird Woman and Murrays implacable gangster, makes for an unholy triangle, plus to describe each of them in that way, risks limiting all they portray through the story. Plenty to watch, process and understand.",1415664000,,702,5.882352941176471
4428220,5,B004LYWPZE,"While I don't usually go for mobster elements or violence in films, this works in a strange way-in that those elements are in the context of the story, and don't dominate the overall impression.

Almost a pastiche on that style of film, because without mega dialogue, communication is there and the story and characters develop on an energetic level.

There is an out of time effect about the whole story, although contemporary, it could also be from last century, western/cowboy elements, the travelling circus, with Rhys Ifans as manic ringmaster, could be a wagon train making camp in the desert. The end gives another interpretation has Mickey Rourkes character been watching a past life dream? Was it all real? I want to see it again as I feel it comes in many layers.

I like that we see his struggles with  himself, that we see Bill Murray as Happy Shannon melted by the angel with wings, that Megan Fox is strong through her timidity. Rourkes pain as he sees Lily at the smart event is very tangible, whatever mess he has made of things, the emotions transmit. Very interesting and different, its definitely worthwhile to watch it!!",1415059200,,1140,4.771573604060913
4428221,5,B004LYWPZE,"An impressive list of movie heavyweights carry through a singular tale that could or couldn't be real.

The film moves through the underbelly of America and a broad span of the human condition and emotions. Nice music with a brief appearance by US legends Solomon Burke and tunes from legendary Allan Toussaint and Aaron Neville. Clip joints, indigenous Americans, freaks, cheap motels, big horizons and long roads, shining night skies wrap round the story of desire, jealousy, owning, sharing, tricking and taking ones chance. Gangsters, classy dames, tortured artists; all weave into the careful tracing of feelings, and life challenges.

Megan Fox shines, Rourke convinces, Murray is glacial. Go watch .",1414972800,,706,5.351351351351352
4428222,5,B004LYWPZE,"The tale is irresistible. There is an angel (or ""bird woman"") and it it passes as a representational story without any fancy. The CGI is hit and miss on the wings, unfortunately, but the general concept is pulled off and makes quite a fascinating story... and with Murray as a gangser, blending his serious and
comic sides in one role.
An angel - Megan Fox uner the power of a relentless gangser - Bill Murray, is saved by a trumpet player
(- Mickey Rourke) down on his luck.
This movie, both directed and written by Mitch Glazer (Scrooged), has a lot going for it.
And of course, apparently, the incredible cast. Murray never fails, Rourke is powerful, and oddly enough
Megan Fox puts on the best performance of her career in this movie. If you think of her as just a beautiful face, this film might demonstrate you wrong.
Having an angel as a character calls to mind some religious thoughts, and infact they play on the concept of things being ""divine"" and with ""retrieval"". There is a kind angel and a vicious angel, too.
I query Glazer if the religious symbolism runs deeper, and he affirm me it doesn't. But even on this superficial level, the story works - a man can return to his depths or rise to new heights.
The movie falls a bit brief, and I can't even determine why. I just felt like there was a next step that should be taken that never was... this could be explored in a continuation, I suppose, but this isn't the type of film you make a sequel to. Is love more forceful than death, as the tagline prompts? Maybe, nut the film never really refers why.",1412121600,2,1566,4.422145328719723
4428223,5,B004LYWPZE,"I recommend this film to anybody who wants to watch a nice romantic film with some realness and actual story-telling. Passion Play is a very nice film and has good script. The actors: I think Megan FOx might not be the best actress in Hollywood, but she has enough qualities to maybe pull it off one day, so humans should cut her some slack. She was really really good in this film. She did more than show off her beautiful face and chiselled body. She showed fright, self-doubt, joy, unhappiness, vulnerability. Lily was a gorgeous person and Megan did an outstanding job at bringing the character to life. She ought to have been nominated for an Oscar but she's too beautiful. Mickey Rourke was Mickey Rourke.

It gets off to a slow start , we watch Nate (Rourke) gathering his excuse for a paycheck but before he can go spend it on booze, he is knocked out by one of Happy Shannon's (Murray) goons and driven to the desert to be left for dead. Miracuously saved, he falters upon a festival in the desert and that is when he sees Lily Luster (Fox), a sideshow appeal, whom he at once has a relation with- it is Megan Fox, people, what I am going to say, who wouldn't have a connection with this woman, she is freaking spectacular! From there, it's all about
getting to know the characters and what makes them tap. The acting is without a doubt one of the motive to watch this movie. I was astonish to see Megan Fox in a part like this, granted she did not have too much to do however but look and play hurted, but she certainly pulls it off and shows that she just might have more span than people give her credit for. Rourke was shockingly relent in this drama, normally he acts some sort of bad ass, but here is more of a rag. The actual reason to watch is Murray - he is not in it as much and he definitely knows how to act a wise-cracking, smart gangster.

4428246,1,B004LYWPZE,"Passion Play focuses on a down on his luck trumpet player named Nate (Mickey Rourke) and his encounter with a young woman named Lily (Megan Fox) in a Mexican sideshow who just happens to have wings. As their lives quickly intertwine, things go from bad to worse when they run away from her overprotective carny father (Rhys Ifans) and into the spiraling web of the mobster who wants Nate dead, Happy Shannon (Bill Murray).

The premise is interesting. Not quite a noir tale, not quite magical realism... Passion Play, if I may be a bit spoilerish, is a tale of Purgatory. Unfortunately, it's not artfully done. It's too real and mundane to be fantastic, other than Lily's wings, and too casual about said wings for anyone to take it seriously. The ending is the only brave thought in the film, and even it is tainted by the plodding narrative and superfluous side characters.

Passion Play attempts subtlety through lingering character shots and uninspired dialogue delivered with horrible timing by both Rourke and Fox. Ultimately, it all falls flat. Bill Murray's Happy is the most interesting part, but even his poetic lines lack for drama and poignancy. I don't think that's his fault, though. The entire piece is earnest, but fails.

If you're looking for noirish films that deal with similar subject matters, I'd probably recommend The Salton Sea. Passion Play? I honestly can't even recommend a rental. It's not the worst movie, but it's pretty bad.",1356393600,5,1456,4.9105691056910565
4428247,5,B004LYWPZE,"I read the reviews for this movie and hesitated to buy it but I'm very glad I did. The movie is kind of a parable about atonement and redemption. It is rather a strange story. If you view it too literally you will cheat yourself.
The acting was fine particularly the magnificent Mickey Rourke and the properly reptilian Bill Murray. What was truly surprising was Megan Fox. She is known primarily in terms of her striking beauty and movies like Transformers. Here she got a real chance to act with very little dialogue, meaning that she had to convey emotion through the eyes and subtle physical gestures. Many better known and more highly praised actresses could not have done what she accomplished here.
In any case, I watched the movie twice in two days, and enjoyed it equally the second time. As an aside, I recommended it to my husband who watched it separately and found it just as mesmerizing I did. We often have ""spirited disagreements"" about movies but both loved this and agree it is a keeper.",1343433600,,1005,4.620111731843576
4428248,4,B004LYWPZE,"I know it's hip to slam 2010's ""Passion Play,"" maybe because Megan Fox is an easy target, but the film doesn't deserve it. This is a reverent drama with fantastical aspects and a profound ending.

THE PLOT: Nate Poole (Mickey Rourke) is a down-on-his-luck musician in Reno, Nevada, who gets on the bad side of a mob boss, Happy (Bill Murray). In his flight he stumbles upon Lily (Fox) at a carnival, a ""freak"" with wings. They discern a deep connection and take off together with Happy & his hoods on their trail.

The film is similar to 2008's ""The Wrestler,"" which also starred Roarke. In both movies Rourke plays a languishing has-been. In both he struggles with his love for a young female. In ""The Wrestler"" it's his daughter; in ""Passion Play"" it's an exceptional young woman with whom he has a love connection.

What surprised me is Fox' acting. She's known for playing the stereotypical shallow hot chick, but here she plays a sweet, innocent woman struggling with an abnormality. And she does it very convincingly.

Also, Rourke (Nate) and Fox (Lily) have good chemistry. Yes, Nate is about 30 years older than Lily, but  it doesn't matter  their connection is real, sort of like Bill Murray and Scarlett Johansson in ""Lost in Translation.""

The score is reverent and moving and fits the tone of the movie.

The ending is both surprising and effective, even though there are obvious clues. See ""COMMENTARY ON ENDING"" below.

The film was shot in New Mexico and runs 94 minutes.

GRADE: B

***SPOILER ALERT*** (Don't read until you've seen the film)

COMMENTARY ON THE ENDING: Although some interpret the ending to mean that the bulk of the story is Nate's death dream, it more likely indicates that Nate was in some type of purgatorial spiritual realm where God offers a second chance for the lost. Nate passes the test and is ushered into eternal bliss. Since it's some type of spiritual realm where God is sovereign, the 'reality' may be set-up in a holographic sense, similar to Star Trek's Holodeck. In that case, the people Nate experiences aren't real at all; they're there simply as a part of Nate's test.

At any rate, the ending gives the story purpose in an eternal scope. Instead of some silly fantasy about a hard-luck musician meeting some beautiful woman with wings who learns to fly while simultaneously delivering the man from some serious heavies (why sure!), the story becomes a tale of eternal redemption for a languishing dumb bastage who foolishly messed around with a mob boss' wife.

At the end you see Nate smiling with true joy as the angel sweeps him off to heavenly bliss. God gave him a second chance at redemption and he escapes this piece-of-sh** world.",1340064000,,2692,4.74892703862661
4428249,4,B004LYWPZE,"Its an earthy, Dantesque parable about redemption - a contemporary morality play not unlike Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress (with Mickey Rourke!).

Yes its hokey on the first viewing, but pleasingly profound on the second.

Its a legitimate work of art.  Not a masterpiece, but a nice little portfolio piece for all involved.

If you enjoy poetic symbolist work, not too heavy but with fallen angels, and classic heaven and hell allusions, then perhaps you appreciate this.

Its worth thoughtful, repeat viewings.

It would make a nice double feature with Terry Gilliam or M. Night Shyamalan.",1333843200,,588,5.202127659574468
4428250,2,B004LYWPZE,"On the surface ""Passion Play"" is a crime drama about a down-on-the-luck jazz musician Nate Poole (Mickey Rourke), who, after getting nearly killed by a thug, encounters Lily Luster (Megan Fox), a woman with a pair of wings on the back. As a sideshow performer Lily has been traveling with the owner of the show Sam Adamo (Rhys Ifans), but the presence of Nate prompts her to take a step to see the world outside. Cast-against-type Bill Murray also appears as ""Happy"" Shannon, a gangster who is also attracted to the beautiful winged woman.

Yes, a winged woman. Megan Fox is Lily with bird-like wings sticking out of her back. As the film's title suggests, ""Passion Play"" clearly has a philosophical or religious overtone, which remains vague at best, buried under the dull dialogues and a meandering story in the mid-section. What is the film all about? Saving someone's soul? Redemption? The beautifully-shot final scene (photography by Christopher Doyle) is clearly trying to tell us something, but what it is, I confess I don't know.

Written and (first-time) directed by Mitch Glazer, a writer for two modernized version of Charles Dickens, the 1998 version of ""Great Expectations"" and ""Scrooged"" (co-written with Michael O'Donoghue), ""Passion Play"" looks like a unique combination of a parable and a noir, a combination that might have worked as a short film.",1329264000,2,1365,5.035398230088496

Be patient. It is agonizingly slow. There are no CGI jumpcuts, hood brothers firing pistols in bullet time leaping sideways, people being tortured with timed tests or any of that drivel that Hollywood normally substitutes for actual talent.

Clearly I believe, along with my wife who often enjoys films I do not, that this is the worst film we've seen in this last decade. About 15 minutes into the film I thought of an ending it could go into if written by some smug high school freshman in an ""Intro to Creative Writing Class"". Then it did just that. I was stupified. Not to spoil it but even the O Henry cop out actually makes it worse. Really....don't regret wasting the time let alone the money.

""Passion Play"" could only have been better if the camera had been trained on Megan Fox in various states of dress and wing beatings the entire time.

One can forgive the boring ""Grumpy Old Men"" subplot, the elderly reject characters portrayed by Mickey ""Babyface"" Rourke and Bill Murray. It was like one long Viagra commercial with those two grandpas hopping about like schoolboys in between the seductive pouts from the foxy Fox.

It's also not worth dwelling on the poor plight of Jesus' angels, who (according to the creators of ""Passion Play"") are forced to risk becoming Satan's brides just to usher washed-up, dried-out jazz musicians through the pearly gates. Jesus is apparently going through another one of his bohemian phases. Sad news indeed for his barber and tailor.

Mickey Rourke was fantastic as the burnt out trumpet soloist Nate and Megan Fox was quite good in a role

I loved the whole David Lynch styled atmosphere of the film and couldn't find too many things to say about it
except I believe the critics were wrong. They are like vultures and will pick off a film if they feel the others
circling - sometimes I believe movies are dismissed because of what their peers think.

To go into the plot at all will spoil it for those who haven't seen it, but this is definatley one
of Rourke's most interesting roles since Angel Heart and Bill Murray is sensational as the bad guy.

Dont listen to the critics - they got it wrong - Passion Play is a suprislingly excellent little film with touches
of Noir and is shot with an arthouse sensibility. And with the drivel that is being spewed out of the pens and

Yes, even from Ms. Fox, who was perfectly cast and gave a constant stream of believable frailty and emotion throughout the entire film.

Who may not have been perfectly cast is Mickey Rourke, who was the main and most focused on character. It's his story. The problem is that he has zero chemistry or compatibility with Fox, who is his love interest in the piece. A love scene with he and Fox might possibly be the most awkward thing you've ever seen, not to mention all the other romantic scenes between them.

He is taken out into the desert to be shot when suddenly a group of Native Americans, dressed in white, shoot his killer. Nate walks until he reaches a sideshow carnival, complete with a woman with huge angel wings (Meagan Fox) named Lily Luster (short for Lilith, a fallen angel?). As the carnies are ready to kill Poole, Lily rescues him.

Rhys Ifans plays Sam Adamo (another Biblical reference as Lilith in mythology was Adam's first wife). He is the head carny and Lily's caretaker. Nate plans to exploit Meagan by going back to the mobster Happy Shannon (Bill Murray) who is anything but happy, as he is a ""recent widower."" Nate is aided by Harriet (Kelly Lynch) who runs the ""Dream Lounge"" in case you thought we were running out of symbols/metaphors. Oh yes, Happy's real name is ""Michael"" like the angel.

Poole seems to ruin his chance for redemption when he decides to exploit ""angel."" The movie contains tons of slow, seemingly useless, endless dialouge. The Sartre ending was expected as soon as the first shot was fired. This is more of an ""indie"" style movie or perhaps an ""art"" film. I think everybody will find something boring in this film in spite of the haphazard use of metaphors.

In any other movie they'd be concerned about her being grabbed for experiments and taken away, but not this one.  In this movie the bird girl is just being used by a carny, a down and out trumpet player, and a mobster pimp.

Megan Fox plays the bird girl, who Nate (Mickey Rourke) finds at a carnival, after fate saves him from being murdered there.  They run away together and Nate sets upon a plan to get Happy (Bill Murray), an aging gangster pimp to manager her career (what career I'm not sure of) in exchange for Rourke's debt freedom (what debt I'm not exactly sure either).

You can tell from the beginning there is no way this will end well. It's hard to find a redeeming quality in Rourke's character and even harder to understand what birdgirl sees in him.  More confusing is Nate's relationship with Harriet (Kelli Lynch).  When we first see her I would think she is his girlfriend, which leaves his relationship with birdgirl even more confusing.

Rourke seems to be playing another version of the character he played in The Wrestler.  The one redeeming quality of this movie is Bill Murray; as always enjoyable in his non-comedic roles.

The story could be really interesting and I can tell they are TRYING for something so much more than this movie was.  With the cast of talent, it's sad that this movie fell so short.",1314144000,,1412,4.545454545454546

It tries so hard to be something more than it really is, and fails so miserably that I find myself trying to analyze it even though I know I'm just wasting my time.

What is Passion Play about? I don't really know. It's some kind of demented love story between a washup and a girl with wings. Why she has wings is really unknown to the viewer. It doesn't really seem to be a problem for the director that he never really explained any of this.

This movie wasted talent of 4 respectable actors. I'm a big fan of Bill Murray and Rhys Ifans but I don't really know if I will be able to watch another movie with either Mickey Rourke or Megan Fox ever again.

The funny thing about Mickey Rourke is that he is playing a caricature of his role from The Wrestler. But it just really doesn't work. Whereas The Ram from The Wrestler had redeeming qualities, this guy has none. You just can't like him.

I don't recommend the watch Passion Play. I don't recommend even really talk about Passion Play after reading this review. I don't plan on.

Megan Fox plays a woman who is part bird. Hey, if you have real feather wings, you're part bird. Mickey Rourke plays an aging trumpet player who gets involved with the bird. Bill Murray is a ruthless gangster who wants the bird for himself. Does all of this sound silly? It is.

I thought the whole thing was a big waste of money. I could not take it seriously at all, and clearly the people who produced this big-budget drama wanted it to be taken very seriously. It seems likely that they thought this film would answer some of life's heaviest questions. Perhaps a little levity would have helped. So, I'll suggest a few changes. First, you'll notice that Rourke wears pants that are too short, so he shows a lot of white sock. I suggest scenes in which Rourke's socks do not match. When a bad guy points this out, fisticuffs erupt.  Also, I could see the trumpet playing tied to the flying. That is, when Rourke plays with intense feeling, perhaps sweating profusely, the bird really soars.

As for Bill Murray, I have a hard time accepting him as a bloodthirsty gangster. Why not make him a down-on-his-luck dude who has to dress up as a chicken and jump around, advertising for a fried chicken joint? Turns out, he secretly longs to fly....",1312502400,,1421,4.453846153846154

Described as surreal, gritty, seductive, hard-boiled and as classic film noir, this film delivers on none of its promises except if you enjoy watching two really seedy-looking old dudes hitting on a young babe with a rather pretty physical abnormality.

The mere thought of Rourke's character ""Nate"", pawing at Fox's character, ""Lily"" with those freakishly ugly fingernails, or Murray's character ""Happy"" drooling over the young ""angel"" should be enough to give anyone the creeps.

Weird fantasy movies are my cup of tea, but this one's lacking cream and sugar.

I'm not sure what genre ""Passion Play"" falls into. It is so far beyond strange I stayed up late into the night trying to figure out what could have possibly hit the editor's floor that made the scenes in this movie the good ones. And I saw the sun rising after staying awake trying to figure out why the character of Lily was not presented on the cover of the DVD box as she is in the film?

Currently, I'm trying to think of how I could best meld ""Passion Play"" and ""Groundhog Day"" together for a Bill Murry extravaganza that would possibly bring some value to ""Passion Play"" to warrant it ever being made. ""Groundhog Day"" is stranger than strange but it was good. Really good. So mixing a really bad movie with a really good one could give us a decent movie...maybe. ""Groundhog Play?"" ""Passion Day?""

While they may try to beat around the bush about it, it's a direct-to-DVD movie. Something's got to be wrong when you have two Oscar-nominated actors and an actress who has become the dreamgirl of millions of adult males in one movie and it can't get a theatrical release. Well, yes, there is a lot wrong with it and it's not just the off-beat story, which probably caused migraines for many executives over how to market it.

Mickey Rourke publicly disclosed (and then later recanted) that he thought this film was ""terrible"" and that he basically only took the role for the money. It's a testament to his skill as an actor that he can turn in such an effective performance that elicits genuine sympathy when his heart wasn't in it. Rourke has a hardened gentleness about him that he's able to exploit for the characters he inhabits. You know Nate Pool has been through a lot because you know Rourke has been through a lot and you want good things to happen for Nate, because you want good things to happen for Mickey. When Nate cries, Mickey cries, and it makes you want to cry.  Passion Play is not lacking in the acting department and the performances are actually quite good Murray is exceptional as the deadpan gangster and Fox is finally able to play a character that isn't just a sexpot, but, alas, isn't given the opportunity to prove that she has much range as an actress. Yes, I had sympathy for her character but it's not a particularly dynamic role. With these performances, as well as Rhys Ifans in a small role, this does not feel like straight-to-DVD fare.

In fact, very little of the film seems like straight-to-DVD fare except for some weak, downright lazy writing and an amateurish ending (that involves some embarrassingly bad CGI). It's mostly well-made and very well-shot with a very dream-like quality to it. Its biggest blunder comes from a lack of direction in Glazer's writing and direction. There is a good story here that just got lost in the presentation. It's just not convincing enough. When it should be heartbreaking and thought-provoking, it comes off as laughable and too ""weird."" If you've ever seen a film and you knew it was trying to convey an interesting idea, but you didn't know what that idea was...That's how I think Glazer felt while writing the script. He knew he was trying to convey an interesting idea, but he didn't know the meaning behind it. Additionally, there's some lazy writing where you can see Glazer has dug himself into a hole and had to introduce a contrived plot device to dig himself out of it (if you've seen the film, tell me I have not just described the return of Ifans' character).

Glazer was working with great actors who give great performances under the circumstances, but he doesn't seem to know how to handle this material. It's sensitive material, as the story moves in such a realistic way, but you're also asking an audience to really suspend their disbelief. You must find a comfortable balance with the realism and the supernatural elements for the film to work. While Passion Play does a mostly good job of maintaining a dreamy, realistic tone it has moments of near-camp.

There are several poorly executed moments throughout the film, but it is the final moments that push the film into the realm of complete ridiculousness. It's an ending that adds meaning to all of the events that preceded it, while simultaneously rendering them irrelevant. From a writing standpoint, it's forced, uncreative, and sappy. From a cinematic and emotional standpoint, it's a confusing array of bad CGI, poor direction, and conflicted emotions. It's a laughable moment. It's a sad moment. But it's never a poignant moment.

I want to give Glazer the benefit of a doubt and attribute his missteps in the direction to lack-of-funding or studio intervention, but I don't know how to excuse the flaws in his writing. I think what is ultimately responsible for the failure of Passion Play is that it had a director who was not ready to direct and a writer who was not through polishing his script. The biggest problem is that this writer and director is the same person. The star-power no doubt came as the result of favors, studio encouragement, and decent sized paychecks. There was some money that came into play here, but where's the passion?

4428267,1,B004LYWPZE,"I will be the first to admit that the reson I picked out this DVD is because of the actors featured on the front cover: mesmerizingly beautiful Megan Fox, eternally sad-eye looking Bill Murray and the comeback kid Mickey Rourke.  But then, as soon as film started, I just knew that these talented actors can do very little about the content of the movie.  I was not sure if director wanted this film to be a movie about beauty and the beast, or if the film is about possesive/obsessive love, or if the film is about last chances in love where one has to take a deep dive and leap of faith and just run with it.

In any case, I feel the most for the actress Megan Fox.  The woman is so strikingly beautiful, I just cannot imagine the kind of roles that Hollywood have lined up for her.  Her acting ability does not match her beauty and she will have a difficult time finding her niche.  She is striking and that alone may be just good enough to provide her with roles like the one in this movie, but it will never meet of exceed her potential.",1307923200,,1042,4.211055276381909

4428269,5,B004LYWPZE,"Sometimes you wonder what known and respected actors do when they are not starring in popular movies or box-office successes. ""Passion Play"" partially answers the question. This is one original and touching project, which stars Mickey Rourke, Megan Fox and Bill Murray - quite fascinating casting.

Mickey Rourke plays Nate, a famous, has-been trumpet player, who we meet at the beginning of the film. He just finished a gig, and just when he was getting ready to go home, somebody hits him on the head. Next thing, he is in the Mexican desert, ready to be executed by a hit man. Amazingly, some strangers save him, just about when he was ready to say goodbye for good. However, he is left alone, without transportation or means of communication, wandering in the desert. Eventually, he finds a traveling carnival in the middle of nowhere, where he meets Lily, an incredibly beautiful woman, who happens to have wings - a bird woman, she calls herself. He falls for her and tries to take her away. Unfortunately, he is discovered by Sam (Rhys Ifans), the owner of the carnival, who will not allow his main attraction to be taken away. Amazingly again, just when Nate is going to be whacked by Sam, he is saved at the last minute, this time by Lily herself. They run away, with Sam promising to get her back. Once in the city, Nate makes a deal with Happy Shannon (Bill Murray), a gangster, to spare his life and debt, and make some profit together, by using Lily in an attraction, namely a lucrative freak. Sadly for Nate, things don't go as planned, and he will soon realize his mistake.

""Passion Play"" is different, and, as I said, original. It plays as a fantasy, and should be watched as such. It is a story about love and redemption, aided by stylish cinematography by Christopher Doyle. It is worth a look. (USA, 2010. color, 94 mins).

4428270,4,B004LYWPZE,"Alcoholic, has-been blues musician Nate Pool (Mickey Rourke of ""Angel Heart"" fame) slept with the wrong woman.  Now gangster Happy Shannon (funnyman Bill Murray of ""Groundhog Day"") wants him dead.  While escaping from one of Happy's thugs, Nate stumbles upon a carnival sideshow owned by Sam (Rhys Ifans of ""Hannibal Rising"").  Nate helps one of the freaks, Lily (Megan Fox of ""Jennifer`s Body""), a girl with wings, escape the sideshow.  He plans to have her work for Happy in hopes that the gangster will allow him to live.  Unfortunately, Happy can't be trusted.

  Director Mitch Glazer's ""Passion Play"" is the most bizarre combination of science fiction fantasy and noir I've ever seen.  There are scenes that generate such great tension that my breath was literally taken away.  Megan Fox is simply incredible as the innocent, nave, attractive Lily who craves to look like other girls.  My heart broke for her, knowing that she was being duped by the despicable Nate Pool.  He's a coarse, slimy loser that I never much liked.  However, towards the end, Nate does experience a change in heart which causes the viewer to root for him as he eludes Happy's thugs.

  ""Passion Play"" does contain some bloody surprises and shocks, which make it a good noir.  The desert scenes were beautiful in their bare, breathtaking majesty - the land from which Lily is taken.  She is transported to the gritty, dirty big city where the bloody love triangle of this bizarre passion play begins to reveal itself.  Poor, lonely Lily finds herself at the center of at least three men who all want to exploit her for her unusual body.  (Many women find themselves in the same situation as Lily.  They just want to be loved for themselves.)  In her desperation to be accepted as normal, Lily seeks medical advice in having her wings removed.  Little does she know that this unusual gift will eventually bring her freedom.

  While watching ""Passion Play,"" I was reminded of best-selling author James Patterson's ""When the Wind Blows"" and its equally superb sequel ""The Lake House.""  Both novels involve the exploitation of children who have been genetically engineered to have bird-like wings.  They can actually fly.  Lily was born with wings.  Sam, the owner of the sideshow, found her in the garbage when she was a baby.  Unfortunately, he would never allow her to ""leave the nest.""  In Patterson's novels, a veterinarian, Frannie O'Neill, and an FBI agent, Kit Brennan, help the children escape evil scientists and their laboratories.

  If one is tired of the same old bloody, shoot-`em-up crime drama, then I recommend viewing ""Passion Play,"" which has a lot of heart.  The film's hero, Nate Pool, finds himself in the biggest moral dilemma of his life; he risks death for a woman with whom he had no intention of falling in love.  Unfortunately, Image Entertainment's DVD release is lacking in special features.  (At least my copy was.)  The film is presented in its theatrical release aspect ratio of 2.40:1 and has SDH and Spanish subtitles.  However, it doesn't have any special features such as audio commentaries, deleted/extended scenes, bloopers, ""making of"" documentaries, cast/crew interviews, etc.

  On the DVD, there is a trailer for ""Passion Play"" as well as trailers for three other Image Entertainment films of various genres:  The first is for ""Burning Palms,"" the bizarre anthology of five sexually-explicit stories that are both shocking and horrifying; the second is for ""Wild Cherry,"" a raunchy teen flick in which a group of girls get revenge on the guys who've sexually exploited them; and the third is for ""The Violent Kind,"" a grisly horror film where three male friends go to a party in the boonies and are viciously attacked and tortured by insane country bumpkins.  Of the three, ""Burning Palms"" is probably the most original.

4428271,1,B004LYWPZE,"This is truly the worst movie I've seen in quite some time. It is so bad, in fact, that it makes the other films I thought were bad (Tooth Fairy; Eat, Pray Love) actually look halfway decent. It is silly and simplistic. Mickey Rourke as someone women find attractive is just a ludicrous concept, given that his face looks like it's been previously used by several other people. His character is a complete cliche: the formerly successful musician wrecked by fame, disillusionment and drugs. A sad waste of Bill Murray in another cliched role as the semi-elegant thug with weird taste in housing. Then there's the very limited Megan Fox who gives a striking performance (as once was famously said by Dorothy Parker of  Katharine Hepburn) that runs the gamut of emotions from A to B. She's very pretty. Acting ability is not one of her skills. This Grade C film is crowded with A-list actors who have to have been under the impression that they were in a far better movie and probably wept at the premiere or tried to sneak away before anyone saw them. Or maybe they did it for the money. Whatever the reason, it's just terrible.

It's fun seeing Mickey Rourke really acting like the Rourke I first saw years ago and I always enjoy Bill Murray as well as his brother Brian Doyle Murray each doing their thing. Megan Fox is the female lead and she's good but she has never really done much for me in any of her past work.

But for me the truly exciting thing in the film is a glimpse of the late great Solomon Burke,performing at a sound check with his band,rocking like only he could while sitting on his throne.

This is a rather slow paced film but never boring and it is a really good looking movie.

I have always enjoyed Bill Murray as an actor, not only in the comedic roles for which he is best known, but have also enjoyed several more serious movies of his, particularly&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Razor-s-Edge/dp/B000069HYF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Razor's Edge</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lost-in-Translation/dp/B00005JMJ4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lost in Translation</a>.  Passion Play marks the first time I have seen him play a bad guy, the gangster.  Given the comparative lack of depth I have to wonder if he accepted this role just to broaden his repertoire.  It was neither his best roll, nor best acting.

Each of the actors turns in a convincing performance: Mickey Rourke playing a jazz musician past his prime, Bill Murray, a (more or less straight-forward) gangster and Megan Fox as the love interest, essentially just a pretty girl with an unusual birth-defect? affliction? appendange.

I would hate to spoil what little plot there was by detailing it.  The film was essentially a love story between 2 quirky misfits.  What knocked the film down in my estimation is that it left a bit too much to the imagination.  The characters were not very well developed, nor was the basis of their strong attraction.  One could imagine that Fox's character had lived a hard life having been abandoned, treated as a freak.  Similarly Murray's character Nate, a has-been of slim means with some past shady dealings (which are never explained) with the underworld of organized crime.  None of the relationships are fleshed out and many of the interactions somewhat predictable.

He is completely convincing and pulls it off very well.  If I hadn't seen his name in the credits, I might not have recognized him for a while.  Was not that familiar with Mickey Rourke or Megan Fox, but both were amazing in this.  There are some scenes that are violent and some nudity that probably was not necessary.  Other than that, this is a wonderful, surprising movie and I haven't seen a movie in a long time that I enjoyed as much as this.  Surprisingly good and highly recommended.  It has some interesting twists and turns and a couple of huge surprises that I cannot reveal without spoiling it for you.  I can almost guarantee that you will like this movie and most likely will want to own a copy.  I will watch this one over again, probably a few times.

I really am not sure what to say about this one.  The acting by Rourke is OK, Fox is better then expected, but Bill Murray really is the acting talent of this movie.  There is so much un-expected aspects to this movie that saying anything will give something away and I don't want to do that.

However, the mismatch in casting of Mickey Rourke fizzled the seductive passion.  Alone, Rourke's character is portrayed well, but coupling him with Fox in this particular film poor casting.  Passion Play was going for a hit pairing similar to Lost in Translation (ironically, Murray is in this film too) but they missed in convincing me of an ageless attraction.  Rourke comes across more as a adoptive father figure, but the audience is supposed to sense the tension developing (intimately) into a love affair.  Frankly, it was a bit creepy and rather disturbing.  The story, concept and filming was artistic, but the casting (although star-packed) was wrong in chemistry.

Great expressive acting with lots and lots of emotional close-ups of all three stars. Rourke plays a musician working the Dream Lounge.  He's losing his battle with drugs and drink in a most proud and dignified way while being hounded by Bill Murray's henchmen. Rourke's character played a hauntingly mellow trumpet as he fell in love with Megan Fox and the camera danced around and around and around them to the beauty of the music.  Not only is she beautiful and  ethereal and mysterious, but her voice is as sweet as Melanie Griffiths'.  Her character is pure and vulnerable and loyal to Rourke, but Murray finds her irresistable.  Until he doesn't anymore.  Then Murray's character puts her on display in a glass cage in a theatre and people pay to watch her and gape at her wings.

4428280,4,B004LYWPZE,"This intriguing, if slight, allegorical drama features a cast that works a low key script effectively. ""Passion Play"" (and no, it has nothing to do with the Christian Ritual dramatic presentation about the Death of Jesus) features Mickey Rourke, Bill Murray and Megan Fox in a love triangle over an angel. That angel happens to be Fox, who Rourke discovers in a carnival sideshow after surviving a mob hit ordered by Murray's gangster, Happy. But Happy isn't going to be happy unless he can keep this angel for himself. Roarke, who is playing a washed up jazz trumpeter Nate Poole, refuses to accept that this heavenly being is going to be stolen from him, and for that matter, neither does Rhys Ifans, who runs the Freak Show Lily (Fox) ran away from.

The surprising thing about all this is Fox, who plays Lily with just enough smoldering hurt that all my usual prejudices about her were dispelled. Each character is trying to escape their own rhetorical demons (Poole to free himself from his drug destroyed past, a life devoid of beauty and joy for Happy, and literal cages for Lily) that the noir-ish elements of the film work well. Murray, who can really do malevolence well (he's even better in ""Mad Dog and Glory""), slithers his way through Happy's role with his usual low key smarmy. In his efforts to continue his come-back, Rourke does a decent job as the dazed Poole, even if it just comes off as a lower degree version of ""The Wrestler.""

My biggest gripe was that I had the twist figured out by the time Poole finds the side-show.

Despite beautiful Megan IMHO who plays her role amicably well and with two legendary and cult-worthy actors like Mickey and Bill the overall presentation of the film is somewhat freaky and dark and lacks depth and motivation.

Mickey Rourke plays an old, scar-faced, chain-smoking, washed up trumpet player.
Kelly Lynch has aged quite a bit since ""Desperate Hours"". She plays Rourke's chain-smoking coworker.
I suspect that the director was thinking that having these two actors constantly engulfed in a cloud of cigarette smoke would make the movie more realistic and life-like. Perhaps. I don't live in Hollywood. I don't know what the director's life is like.
I admit I bought the DVD because I'm a big fan of Megan Fox. It's more than just a crush. I like her acting. Few actresses could play a hardened hooker as well as she did in ""Jonah Hex"". Unfortunately, her acting was not up to its usual caliber in this film. In these situations I assume it's the director's fault.
There are a lot of loose ends. What's with the five dudes in white ninja warrior outfits? To use movie speak, ""What's their motivation in this scene?""
The movie also never addresses the question of how on Earth a human being acquires wings. In the movie they seem to think that it's just diversity. And the producers need to learn a little about biology. Most land animals more evolved than insects have four extremities: two arms and two legs in the case of man, four legs in canines, felines, bovines, etc., and two legs and two wings in the case of birds. Megan was given six extremities.
Birds are able to fly because they are very light weight (hollow bones, etc.) Megan sensibly points out that she cannot fly with her tiny wings because she weighs too much. I don't want to spoil the ending, but in the final scene she bears much more than her own weight.
Full disclosure: I had to fast forward through most of the second half of the movie. It was just too horrible. Perhaps it got better in the second half, but by then they lost this viewer.",1523059200,,1922,4.590116279069767

8435343,5,B004LYWPZE,Megan Fox was awesome in this movie. It is like a western story.,1446940800,,64,4.0
8435344,4,B004LYWPZE,"The references others have made to David Lynch are correct, Sam Shepard or even Edgar Allan Poe might also be cited as spiritual fathers of this movie. Fans of 'mystical' noir such as [I]Wild at Heart, Fool for Love[/I] or [I]Wicker Park[/I] should like this.
The good: Megan Fox is super-gorgeous as always (so much so that she's almost painful to look at, but in a good way), and gives what may be her best acting performance, the sparse New Mexico desert locations are appropriately somber and otherworldly, and the story - while far from 'unpredictable, as the back cover claims - is certainly not your average American movie fare, this almost looks more like a European art film. No car chases, nothing explodes, no cops, no doctors, no lawyers. Not even Zombies. There are guns, however, which brings us firmly back stateside.
Always nice to see Bill Murray, and I'm sure he enjoyed this one, being so totally different from his usual roles.
The not-so-good: Can't recall a movie since some of the Marilyn Monroe ones from the 50's where a woman as young and beautiful as Megan was the object of desire of geezers as yucky as these two, which makes it a li'l hard to relate to the characters. The contrast is just too huge. Mickey Rourke used to be a heartthrob back in the 80's...holy crap, what happened?!? Drugs, booze, smokes & boxing...that it?
Yes, yes, I know it's supposed to be a sort of 'parable', but still.......",1434844800,,1430,4.678571428571429
8435345,5,B004LYWPZE,"I'm not usually a fan of the art house type of movies, but this one really pulled at my heartstrings.  I think that part of it was the bittersweet story of love and redemption.  Part was due to the gorgeous cinematography.  I also enjoyed the great performances of Mickey Rourke and Bill Murray, and even Megan Fox did an admirable job in a low-key way.  ""Passion Play"" was unusual and intriguing.  I don't think I have ever seen anything quite like this movie and I loved it enough to buy it.  I highly recommend this one.",1433721600,2,523,4.395833333333333
