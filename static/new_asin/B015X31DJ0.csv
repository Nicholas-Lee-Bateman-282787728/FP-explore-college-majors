8734832,1,B015X31DJ0,"A fine Audie Murphy western with a better-than-usual cast, but avoid the White Pearl Classics blu-ray.  Picture quality is sub-par, barely of DVD quality, and suffers from a weird, juddery motion artifact -- like a silent movie -- which spoils the action scenes.  As for the ""stereo"" audio, it's echoey- and phasey-sounding, as if the original mono track was re-recorded in an airplane hangar.  Region B-locked.  A major disappointment.",1493164800,,436,5.27536231884058
