8470608,5,B005FSH88E,"Shooters Services Unlimited's, Duane Freilino has long been one of the most respected names in the decoy dog community. He breeds the best coyote dogs you can get your hands on, so when I heard that he was releasing a video covering his training methods I had to get in on it. I wasn't expecting much, I have seen other coyote dog videos that just don't entertain or instruct, but this was SSU, so I thought I'd take a chance. Boy am I glad I did! High quality HD footage of real hunts and detailed instruction on training methods employed by Duane himself. This is a must see for anyone who trains or has any interest in hunting dogs.",1312329600,2,635,4.34453781512605
