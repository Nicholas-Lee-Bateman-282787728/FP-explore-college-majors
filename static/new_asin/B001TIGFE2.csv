3790709,5,B001TIGFE2,"It is a major crime that this great film did not get a big theatrical release. If you are like me and like having a completely amazing film to introduce to your movie loving friends - you have found that movie. There is so much going on that it would be very hard to provide a synopsis here. Just trust me - ""you will love this flick"". And I can promise that you have never seen anything like it. Enjoy!!!",1238544000,3,405,4.075
3790710,5,B001TIGFE2,"Saw this film at cinevegas a year or two ago (it won the Jury prize if I remember).  The average American is caught on a surveillance camera over 500 times a day-- ranging from ATM cameras, dressing room cameras, to traffic cameras.  LOOK uses this concept (the cameras aren't actually surveillance cameras, it's a POV gimmick) to weave a series of connected stories of how the fact we're being watched is affecting us, whether we know it or not--vindicating and condemning characters with impartiality.

And don't let the racy first scene deter you-- this is a deep movie--well worth your time.",1238284800,2,595,4.871287128712871
3790711,5,B001TIGFE2,"This film is NOT about surveillance cameras as some simpleton reviewers have suggested. It's about decent and flawed human beings and how they deceive and victimize each other---and you care about them---deeply. Surveillance cameras are the medium through which the stories are told, and an astoundingly effective medium it is, too. The acting, direction and production values are superb and attention to detail flawless.

Viewers' note:  Watch this one alone, not with Grandma or Mom or the kiddies or someone who will judge you for enjoying the raunch and nudity. Yes, it's erotic. It's funny. It's tragic. It's moving. It's gut wrenching. It's terrifying and above all, it's real, true and honest. That's what makes it stand out from most of the effluent flowing out of the Hollywood sewer. This could happen, probably has happened and does every day. It could happen to you and maybe that's why it works so well.
Kudos to Rifkin.",1318464000,,933,5.012903225806451
3790712,5,B001TIGFE2,"You probably know what Look is about by now- surveillance cameras that capture numerous people in a variety of situations (such as a creepy man frequently having sex in a shopping mall storage room and being involved in sexual harassment cases with a bunch of different women, teenagers dealing with criminals who enter their mini mart late at night with a deep dark secret unbeknownst to the teens, an underage girl attempting to seduce her much older teacher in a high school parking lot, and a nerdy man who gets picked on inside his work office and eventually finds himself involved in something MUCH more surprisingly bigger).

With that said, my initial feeling was definitely utter disappointment.  Why?  Because at first I believed I had fallen for a gimmick (actually I take that back- I watched through the entire thing so I DID fall for a gimmick) concerning surveillance cameras positioned too perfectly, a picture quality too clear, and the volume up too loud to be ACTUAL surveillance cameras.  Nice trick by the movie writers to make me a sucker and believe they were real surveillance cameras because it worked!

However, the fact the movie actually went somewhere (and specifically, went something *good* with a variety of mini stories unraveling piece by piece every few minutes) is the reason I'm giving Look 5 stars.  If not for that, well, surely the movie would have completely fallen apart.

Plus, even though the surveillance cameras weren't real, what felt very VERY real (to me at least) was the actual sex and violence involved.  Nothing was held back- the things these people were doing definitely felt like a highly realistic possibility.  Let's just say, for now on I'll wash my hands extra hard when I get home from the store!

Overall, I found Look to be quite entertaining.",1313884800,2,1806,4.891803278688524
3790713,3,B001TIGFE2,"It's certainly not something to sit and watch as a family. It's really creepy. BUT, I can't say I didn't enjoy it. Guilty pleasure?",1295740800,,131,4.5
3790714,4,B001TIGFE2,"Wow! This was a really nice change of pace... a movie filmed entirely with the use of surveillance cameras... very cool! The whole idea and feeling of the film really is pitch perfect for the format too; using surveillance cameras isn't just a shoddy gimmick, it helps create a lot of tension and adds to the 'big brother is watching' feeling that the film is going for. The film also is one in which we follow multiple characters and storylines that eventually intersect as the film continues (which I'll admit is something I still haven't gotten tired of). As far as the tone of the film it was dramatic and tense throughout, with some very funny and odd situations thrown in. The way the movie is filmed really makes it feel like a documentary at times too, and I think this helps certain scenes in the film seem more real; therefore heightening the enjoyment and believability of them Fans of experimental films should definitely check this out... the casual moviegoer may or may not appreciate it, but the sheer uniqueness of this makes me want to recommend it to everyone. I'd love to see more films done in this style. 4.25/5 stars.",1294358400,,1139,4.643564356435643
3790715,1,B001TIGFE2,"That is the only thing I took away from this movie and I didn't exactly have to dig for it. Rifkin has thrown together a gimmick and a bucket of narrative cliches so that he can try to work through his angst about none of the pretty girls going to prom with him. He pours all his loathing into one single character -- I forget her name, so let's call her Trampy -- who goes ridiculously out of her way to seduce her balding shlub of a teacher. This is a stupid story to begin with but it takes Rifkin's obvious vendetta to raise (or lower) things to the truly grotesque. See, Trampy not only lusts after Mr. Cueball, she's also casually destructive, vindictive, and steals clothes from the mall after frolicking with her gal pal naked in the dressing room. Why? Because it probably turns Rifkin on. While anyone familiar with teenage girls knows they can be jerks, the pure sociopathy on display here is ludicrous and bespeaks that the director was less interested in crafting a compelling film than he was in pillorying every cheerleader to turn him down.

And the rest of the movie? Pure cliche storm. Do I even have to tell you about the terrorist red herring and the happily married man having a gay affair? This tripe was moldy twenty years ago!",1291507200,,1250,4.482456140350878
3790716,1,B001TIGFE2,"I have held Rifkin's ""Dark Backward"" as one of my favorite under-rated films.  If anything, it was original, stylish and fun. Plenty of people hate it, no matter what I say. ""Look"", however, is the most unoriginal project I could have ever imagined. Totally predictable and we learn nothing new we didn't already know. It was so painful to watch that I began to speed-search till it was over and I guessed every conclusion to each mini-story! There is no reason for you to watch this film. If you want to see a good docudrama-type shocker, (even if you don't learn something new), check out the French ""Man Bites Dog"". I give ""Look"" one star because I know how hard it is to make a film, Rifkin has talent and I pray he does better on the next one!",1277596800,3,748,4.381294964028777
3790717,1,B001TIGFE2,"This movie, is the worst movie I have seen in years. The reason this movie is terrible. Is becuase, of the cheap film quality. Also, their is no explanation of the different characters in different scenes of the movie. All you see is how people get mad at ATM machines, steal from stores, get into car wrecks and hit and run, act unprofessional at work and so on. After twenty minutes, I had enough of this movie and turned it off.",1277251200,,431,4.333333333333333
3790718,1,B001TIGFE2,"Having just finished watching ""Look"" I'm wondering if I just watched the same movie that garnered so much praise and apparent awards that are splashed across the box. Maybe ""Look"" merits a Razzie, but certainly nothing else.

The premise is certainly interesting. In our daily lives we're filmed constantly - while driving, while using the elevator, sitting at our desks and many other places. With the advent of cell phones anyone can become a photographer or videographer journaling the lives of complete strangers or their own.

""Look"" presents a range of characters and situations where those characters are being filmed. Some of the stories are interwoven and some are not. I can kind of see where the director wanted to go with this film. Peeling back the layers of seemingly normal people to reveal the seedy truth beneath. It just doesn't work.

First, the director tries but ultimately fails to deliver a convincing presentation. The majority of the cameras that capture Americans lives on a daily basis are low-quality security grade types that are present more for deterrence than anything else. Since this medium is somewhat lacking the director chose to throw realism out the window. The majority of the film is full-color, high quality film with sound - as if a camera crew were capturing the entire event not a security camera. Sure there are some cheesy effects thrown in to make it seem like we're watching a security camera feed but it's never believable.

The individual stories fail to deliver anything suspenseful and by the end of the film everything is tied up in a nice little bow.

Anyone who has spent five minutes thinking about what they've been caught doing on camera has a deeper understanding in the subject than the creators of ""Look"".",1269648000,,1767,4.936026936026936
3790719,4,B001TIGFE2,"While I'm not familiar with any of the actors/actresses in the movie.  I find that to be a good thing sometimes.

Look...It's a different way of filming and looking at things.  As the movie progresses through the eyes several different characters throughout.  Yes, this style has been done before but with ""Look"".  It seems a bit different and adds a bit to the movie as a whole.  I would recommend it to fans of this style of movie.  If nothing else give it a chance via renting and then form a different opinion of this yourself.",1268179200,2,531,4.46875
3790720,5,B001TIGFE2,"Director Adam Rifkin does it again, with this new smash hit entitled LOOK. A film shot all entirely through the POV of survelience cameras from start to finish. LOOK has you on the edge of your seats and has you wondering what is to happen next as your watching the shocking and terrifying events that the characters do and go through in which all the stories interlude with each other. It's a very serious/dark film that is well done (on a low budget) and shows the world of how it really is, and how people really are. This is like NO other film and deserves more credit than it has, so sit back relax and watch LOOK. For a low budget film, LOOK sure LOOK's professional (and is!)and has you hooked right from the opening sequence.
With a great cast, excellent music/story, and Amazing direction, LOOK is an inspirational piece of art to the INDEPENDENT film world that changes the way we see life as it records us unknowingly.

3790721,5,B001TIGFE2,"Not a movie for paranoids, it definitely feeds a certain misanthropy.  At first, I thought it might be from actual security cameras, but the film is, indeed, fiction.  While being a nagging reminder of the plusses and minuses of our constant surveillance, the film does a great job at creating emotional arcs that often made me forget I was watching a series of security-cam edits.  The film was honest... uncomfortably so.  It makes a good case for humans being pretty sleazy.  It also does a fairly good job of mitigating the sleaze and paranoia by showing good people doing good things and security cams used for the forces of justice.  I won't say it was too little too late, because I liked the movie a lot, but the saving moments are really last-minute.  Overall, a movie like this was inevitable and I'm glad to see that its execution was handled so deftly.  If you enjoyed CRASH -- another great Los Angeles film about intertwined lives, this should also appeal to you.  The stories are engaging, the acting is solid, and the directing/writing is incredibly nimble and confident.",1260835200,,1087,4.770053475935829
3790722,2,B001TIGFE2,"This video documentary has some interesting points, but its production values are poor and amateurish. I found it difficult to finish watching the documentary, simply because it didn't hold my interest.

3790723,4,B001TIGFE2,"Based entirely on what are suppose to be clips from surveillance cameras, 'Look' uses an interesting premise to tell a story about how the lives of various different people within a city ultimately cross paths and effect one another. In what would probably be considered an Alejandro Gonz&aacute;lez I&ntilde;&aacute;rritu rip-off, 'Look' distinguishes itself from movies like 'Babel' and '21 Grams' by the use of the surveillance camera idea, which works very well and makes the movie not just very original, but very interesting.

There are a few scenes, particularly at the very beginning, that seem completely ridiculous and unrealistic... so much so that I was put off by it and nearly ended the movie there, but after getting past the first five or ten minutes, I found the stories got better and engrossing. None of the stories within the movie were difficult to believe, as some scenes would be very familiar to anyone who's kept an eye on news headlines during the last ten or fifteen years, which along with the point of view you get from the film, gives you a very realistic and thought-provoking movie. If it weren't for the couple of bad scenes, particularly at the beginning, I would have given it five stars, however those brief scenes were enough to bring you out of the voyeuristic state you find yourself in while watching the movie.

Overall, the movie doesn't try to resolve anything in particular, answer any questions, or provide you with an enlightened mood when the film is over... it's there to give you a short glimpse of the lives of people who could very easily be living in your town right now. Similar to movies like 'Babel', '21 Grams', and 'Crash', it reminds you that decisions you make can end up affecting the lives of other people, and brings to light the disrespect between people that seems to be so common place today. Like it or not, this movie is a very realistic view of the world we live in today. It's meant to be thought-provoking and eye-opening, while providing a level of entertainment. In that respect, it works nearly perfectly for me.",1253318400,2,2085,4.805013927576602
3790724,4,B001TIGFE2,"The entire movie was shot from the angle and typical locations of security surveillance cameras, often imitating blurred images and the low quality of the typical low-resolution cameras used in real life for surveillance. As several stories develop in parallel, the Director managed to produce a film that feels like a documentary, allowing the viewer to almost always have the impression that he is watching actual video surveillance materials, and making you wonder and reflect on how you could be caught in embarrassing or illegal situations, but hopefully, without the typical boredom of a documentary.

As surveillance in western societies takes place everywhere, the film successfully delivers its main message, making the audience aware of the actual lack of privacy we all are exposed to. The film makers claim at the opening of the movie that in average a normal citizen is filmed 200 times a day. This figure seemed exaggerated to me at first, but after watching the movie I was persuaded that this order of magnitude is reasonable after all.  In the positive side, the movie proves how useful so much video surveillance can be when needed. However, the movie completely missed a relevant issue regarding the ""Big Brother"" side of so much surveillance, as the film did not explore in any of the parallel stories the potential abuse of the materials being filmed.

Due to this huge omission, I was going to rate the move three stars, nevertheless, I enjoy it, so this explains my upgrade to four stars. For those concerned about the ""Big Brother"" effect, the movie is still worth watching, as you can draw your own conclusions of all the possible misuses from all the situations presented in the movie. Finally a word of warning: some folks might object some sex scenes and brief nudity, but that is part of what real surveillance cameras record everyday in public places, at work, and at home.",1249344000,,1903,4.940625
3790725,4,B001TIGFE2,"I knew what to expect on format and subject of this movie, but I didn't expect to be so captivated by it.  The movie is an intertwining series of seemingly unrelated story lines all caught on various surveillance cameras.  This movie often appears to be the result of combing through thousands of hours of videos hoping to capture that one moment of truth.  I assumed it would be something like a fake version of  Caught on Tape or one of the other reality like shows that exploit the hidden truth that only cameras can expose.  Instead this movie showed many dramatic points that are often overlooked in reality shows.  Being a fictional drama, the director was able to tweak the ""honesty"" just a little for gut reactions.  I was reminded of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Elephant-A-Film-By-Gus-Van-Sant/dp/B0001EFUFK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Elephant: A Film By Gus Van Sant</a>&nbsp;which also came across as unrelenting reality - but not as a mockumentary style that is often used in other reality-esque dramas.  This movie kept me watching and kept me ""suspending my disbelief"" as they say in cinema talk.  I forgot for long portions of the movie that I was watching a film with actors, not just a monitor hooked up to a camera in a parking lot or mall or convenience store, etc.  This movie may be a little experimental for those that like their movies conventional, but for those that like to change it up a little bit - this is a very interesting and engrossing film.",1248739200,,1522,5.100806451612903
3790726,5,B001TIGFE2,"Rifkin shows his genius in every frame of this film!  Big Hollywood studios, where are you?  LOOK is the best film I've seen in a long, long time.  Rifkin transports the viewer with ease into the world of surveillance, and once there, you're hooked.  We all live under the watchful eye of Big Brother, Rifkin just made it real for us.

3790727,1,B001TIGFE2,this movie was a little too horrific for my taste. I'll be honest and say that after about 10 minutes i shut it off. depending on your taste you may have a different opinion,1247011200,,173,4.117647058823529
3790728,2,B001TIGFE2,"""A movie shot entirely on surveillance cameras!"" ""The ultimate look at our 'Big Brother' world!""

As someone who makes his living producing television, I was very intrigued by the above promo copy for ""Look."" I seriously wondered if it could be the next step in reality entertainment. If a director had been able to create a compelling and cohesive story out of raw surveillance footage, that would be a giant leap past the short clips that make their way onto those ""Caught On Camera"" shows. ""This,"" I thought, ""could really be something big!"" And then I quickly realized that it wasn't.

""Look"" is a pastiche of C-level fictional stories performed by C-level actors, glued together (albeit loosely) with the gimmick of shooting it all with surveillance cameras. So you have the ultimate form of down n' dirty reality video (surveillance) being used to visualize completely fictional content. This is like shooting a season of Survivor with a paid cast of professional actors who are completely scripted. What would be the point? And that's the same question I ask about Look: when you've stripped reality and true voyeurism from surveillance cameras, why bother to use them? As a technique, it's genuinely interesting for about 10 minutes, and then you ""get it"" -- after which you're left with a fictional movie that's not shot as well as it could have been with conventional cameras. Honestly, if I were not intending to write a Vine review of Look, I wouldn't have watched past the 30 minute mark.

Possibly the director is making a point that surveillance cameras are everywhere, but that's hardly a profound fact that needs 102 minutes of exposition. And ultimately, I felt the fictional nature of the movie undercut whatever factual points the director might have been hoping to make about surveillance cameras and privacy.

For me, this was no more than a 2 star flick, certainly not worth repeat viewing, nor do I even care about it enough to bother with the extras on the DVD. As with all movies, YMMV, and there is no shortage of 5 star raves about Look, but overall, this strikes me as a textbook case of style over substance. Whether you agree with my conclusions or not, I do hope that you found this review to be helpful.",1246838400,2,2236,4.8
3790729,5,B001TIGFE2,"A veritable slice of Americana--at times hilarious, ominous, depressing and exuberant.

3790730,3,B001TIGFE2,"This was a very interesting movie but had a few issues that subtracted from the overall experience for me. I found the concept of the film extremely interesting and give the filmmakers credit for pursuing it. However, the purpose of this film is to portray reality and in some scenes this is achieved in other's it is not. Most surveillance cameras do not have audio associated with them and the cameras that do usually have poor quality. In some scenes you hear the dialog very clearly, which detracts from the overall reality. There are some great scenes minus the audio that really adds to the scene.  I also thought that the sexual stuff was a little overboard and really did not have a point in the movie. The movie is shot in a way where all the characters intertwine somehow but some characters were pointless to the overall story. I am curious to see if future filmmakers will evolve the concepts of this movie. If you are a student of film then I would suggest giving this a rent. I would not suggest this film for someone who is looking for a great story; even though the plot is intriguing it just never matures into a great story.",1246233600,,1142,4.490384615384615
3790731,4,B001TIGFE2,"This movie appeared like it would be a pseudo-documentary affair where the filmmakers addressed the myriad surveillance devices stationed in cities around the world.  The promise of an Orwellian sort of premise was not delivered though, as no negative ramifications of constant surveillance were ever shown.  Where Orwell showed the horribly negative aspects of surveillance, this movie used it as a tool for nothing more than story telling.

The movie definitely showed a pronounced invasion of privacy in the daily lives of the people in the movie, but the filmmaker failed to show any effects of this intrusion.  Well, without ruining the movie, I will say that there was ONE occasion where surveillance was used to demonstrate a crime.  On the whole though, the surveillance footage just showed people messing around on their jobs or going through their normal daily lives.  There wasn't enough of a message conveyed to make the film as effective as it should have been.

With this said, I really did enjoy the movie.  The script was effective as a drama, but not as a provocative, anti-surveillance movie.  The filmmakers really should have shown some true invasion of privacy, rather than showing what would be seen as justified surveillance in workplaces.  In fact, the lack of anyone viewing the surveillance videos kept a goodly number of people employed when they should, by all rights, have been fired.

Do not watch this movie expecting a documentary or anything that roundly condemns the constant surveillance we are subject to in our daily lives.  This movie does not deliver on that message in my opinion.

Bottom line:

4/5 (for being entertaining)

2.5/5 for not delivering on the premise that constant surveillance is a bad thing, which I feel that it certainly is.

4/5 overall (rounded up because I actually liked the movie).",1246147200,2,1845,5.03960396039604
3790732,5,B001TIGFE2,"You probably hadn't hear of Look during it's limited theatrical run. I hadn't and only discovered it through Amazon. I didn't read up on it before watching it and, to tell you the truth, I wasn't too excited to watch it. The gimmick of making a movie entirely with surveillance cameras didn't seem that intriguing to me. What really surprised me was that five minutes into Look I was hooked.

The film opens with a title card explaining that there are 30 million surveillance cameras in the U.S. and that the average American is caught on video 200 times a day.

Soon, we're watching two teenage girls trying on clothes in a dressing room. Next, we meet the manager of the store who enjoys seducing all of the female employees. We meet a nerdy young man who is constantly ridiculed at work. A teacher with a pregnant wife, a gas station attendant, a couple of serial killers, and various other characters.

The film takes advantage of our voyeuristic tendencies as humans. This is what makes it so instantly fascinating and intriguing. What made the film such a profound viewing experience, for me, was the realism of it. While not always pleasant, the film does show a rarely-glimped side of human nature. This subject matter is not glamorized or watered-down which is most likely why this was never billed as big Hollywood movie.

Writer/director Adam Rifkin was clearly not afraid of some risk-taking in telling this story. In this surveillance footage format, you're not given a viewpoint that allows you to explore a character's motives, back-story, etc. All we know about the character's is what the surveillance ""footage"" allows us to see. Some filmmakers would find this to be a near-unbearable challenge, but Rifkin seems to embrace it. With these restraints, I found it impressive that he was able to find a way for us to empathize with these characters. Even more impressive is that once we do empathize with them, Rifkin throws the audience a curveball (even though some of these ""curveballs"" are, admittedly, rather predictable).

Look is an entertaining, funny, provocative, startling, and profoundly disturbing movie that defies many typical cinematic conventions. What appears to be a mere cinematic experiment turns out to be a movie that will grab you and not let you go, as well as make you think along the way. As Richard Roeper said of the film, it's ""worth seeking out.""

3790733,4,B001TIGFE2,"Look is an answer to the thought problem: Could you construct a coherent narrative if you had omnipresent access to all of the surveillance cameras recording in a metropolitan area? Given that people seem more willing than ever to carry on their private lives in public spaces (been forced to overhear any good cell phone conversations lately?), the fundamental conceit of Look is not completely implausible, just highly improbable. However Look is not a documentary, it is a work of fiction, so if you're willing to suspend disbelief, you, as I did, may find the film interesting and worth watching.  I had already seen Look via Netflix, but did not have time to listen to the commentary. I had made a mental note to pick up a copy if I ever saw it in a $5-$10 bin at Target or Walmart; I was glad to get a review copy from Vine.

As it is likely to be the only film ever constructed in this manner, it is also worthwhile for those of us interested in the creative and technical aspects of film making. The multiple plot lines are somewhat conventional and play on predictable fears of false accusation and stranger abduction to create an emotional core. Bad things happen in Look, but the film is not brooding or dark enough to carry the weight of a serious message about the surveillance society. The film comes by its R rating honestly; those who find nudity, foul language, simulated sex, or moral ambiguity off-putting should probably avoid the DVD. The DVD includes a commentary, two features, alternate & deleted scenes, and trailers.",1245888000,,1542,4.707407407407407

Instead I found myself subjected to a low budget, unimaginative, voyeuristic, soft core feature reminiscent of what curious teens where attracted to in the seventies. Putting it bluntly 'Look' was nothing short of sophomoric drivel under the guise of  meaningful, contemporary commentary. Shame on you! If your taste runs to this kind of infantile titillation you'd be better off picking up one of the 'Girls Gone Wild' films.",1245888000,2,619,5.252525252525253
3790735,2,B001TIGFE2,"At first I thought that this will be a documentary about the security cameras.  But then I have realized that actors are not professionals and that affected the ""feel"" of the movie.  However, the idea for the film  is great.  There are cameras all around us, recording various moments in our lives more than 200 times a day.  Cameras are in stores, at work, on the streets, public parking lots relentlessly recording all events.  Seemingly unrelated events and people are all connected to each other.

To add to all of that, there are cell phones and portable devices that can record events and incidents that can in turn be shared with large groups of people without participant's consent.  Not to mention that many of such events can be taken out of context that can label a person for life.

No matter what, this film is a representation that we, the people, are  what we want other people to see and not who we really are.  Only the camera can give objective view of who we truly are.  And all those events put in single context together give a new perspective on what the world is really like and what people are capable of doing to themselves and each other.

Quality of the DVD I received was not great.  Some part of it were scratchy in spite of the fact that DVD arrived impeccably packaged.",1245196800,,1300,4.5
3790736,3,B001TIGFE2,"When I first saw the promo info on this movie I thought it was really an assembly of footage from surveillance cameras. Of course I am pretty stupid for thinking that since that would mean countless lawsuits as well as the fact that you really could not make anything as interesting as the actual movie by piecing snippets together.

The beginning scene showing half-naked girls in a dressing room is, I suppose, designed with a twofold purpose. One, to get your eyes open and two, to point out that this is a movie that is supposed to be shot from surveillance cameras, and to point out just how much our lives are being observed on a day-to-day basis. I've never been in a dressing room with two teenyboppers like that but I found the dialog to be contrived.

From then on we are taken on a voyeuristic journey across the city as we observe scenes that are woven into the overall plot. Some are done better than others.  I found myself forgetting that this was supposed to be a movie made from surveillance clips, however, and it became just a regular movie to me. Most of the scenes captured dialog and also a picture quality that I doubt the average camera would be able to match. The scenes were all carefully set up, as well. As a movie I found it interesting but as something supposedly from random cameras, it was not convincing. Nor did I ever reflect on the main theme of this movie, that we are being closely observed daily. It wound up being just another movie. Watchable, yes, but groundbreaking and dramatic and etc. etc., nope. It's too slick.",1245024000,,1558,4.5177304964539005

A multi threaded day in the life gone wrong story, as seen on surveillance video. Also, people doing every crass, vulgar, immodest, gross, improper, cruel and pathetic thing they ever thought private while no one was looking as, of course, someone is looking ALL THE TIME. It also depicts, by way of the backgrounds, an endless cityscape of bleak, bland, corporate, suburban reality, miles and miles of aisles and aisles, cul-de-sacs, mall corridors, highways and elevators. Clandestine sex and nudity in public places features large in the scheme of this story, as does random violence and gratuitous stupidity. Fascinating, in a vaguely voyeuristic way, given the staged quality of the ""observed"" scenes, the film chronicles the torment and eventual crisis of mall rats, cubicle drones, teeny boppers, housewives, cops, salesmen, secretaries and family barnyards everywhere, all on a collision course to hell.",1245024000,,1185,5.370967741935484

It turned out to be a drama performed by actors shot in a simulated security camera kind of view. Although its various scenes weren't real, it still sends a clear message, that everything we do can possibly be recorded without our knowledge and later used to harm or benefit us, depending on the circumstances. It also points out many dangers that we can learn to avoid. These cameras are in fact electronic eye witnesses. Their absence do not mean that things don't  happen, but their presence will to some degree deter improper behavior and also record events so that they can later be viewed to determine what, why, where, and how things happen.  I like this DVD because it educates people so that they can adapt to our modern world more easily. The presence of plain view security cameras does modify our behavior in public settings. But the use of hidden pin-hole security cameras made many thought-to-be private settings insecure. Many people will feel nervous for the increasingly lack of privacy no matter where they go and whatever they do. But this is a fact of life these days, and if one acts and behaves properly, there is really nothing to be afraid of. The security cameras are a deterrent for not acting properly. In this respect, I don't think that is so bad. This is a real world education DVD.",1244764800,,1549,4.649635036496351

The hook here is that everything is shot on surveillance cameras and for the most part that conceit works in the films favor.  The actors overall are consistent and lend an air of believability to the proceedings particularly towards the climax(es).  However as a viewer I couldn't help but ponder how many of the microphoneless cameras were capturing conversations so clearly. There are some dramatic camera techniques that also take away from what is overall an attempt at glaring realism. The multiple storylines clip along briskly and make for a compelling experience overall however. This movie raised questions for me about how we judge images more when viewed in a voyeuristic manner, and how much speech is important in relaying our body messages.  I also really enjoyed the minimalistic score and music that rarely raises its head.

There are many stories going on at the same time and it takes a while to get the rhythm of the film but - at 102 minutes - the film is a bearable length to give it a chance.

There are  no ""name"" actors which makes it easy to identify with the characters without saying ""hey that's so-and-so"".

This is one of those word-of-mouth films that will find a niche market on DVD and possibly a recommendation for ""something different"" at the video store counter.

Give it a chance. You'll probably like it - I did - but, even if you don't, it'll give you something to think about next time you extract money from an ATM machine or buy a donut at your local Dunkin' Donuts. SOMEBODY is watching you!

3790742,5,B001TIGFE2,"Look is a movie that surfaces a rather disturbing subject, for there are millions of surveillance cameras in the United States that capture our every move, some of rather intimate nature.

Today, there is hardly any natural disaster, event or news worthy moment without a video having captured all details. The average American is captured by a recorded device at least 200 times. For example, if we use a prepaid pass device, the motor vehicle authorities know wherever we have been. Cellular phones provide records of our every call and of our location at any given time. Cell phone cameras are able to capture our image and send it over the Internet at any given time; our navigational pattern through the Internet is now recorded and used as a sales tool... But the movie tells how we are being observed at our jobs, at school, on the street, while shopping, in the dressing room as we try on new garments, at the airport and even in the ""privacy"" of our own homes.

The movie probes into subjects that leave us wondering if there is such a thing as a private moment, or a secret. Just look at the scandals of the day and realize that no one can carry a secret affair without some form of detection, whether a photo, a recorded conversation, or the paparazzi following our every move.

No one seems to be able to lie, deceive or commit a crime without some form of record surfacing, and while some aspects of this loss of privacy may be good for society, the movie shows the desperate situations resulting for some innocent victims.

3790744,3,B001TIGFE2,"Look manages to tie various seemingly unrelated story lines together. To some extent, it demonstrates how closely all of our lives are interconnected. It shows events in several characters lives that seems to take place over a period of 3 to 4 days. Some of it is funny, some sad, some is pretty awful - just like real life.

This is a very unusual film that is shot entirely on surveillance cameras - at least that's what it claims. While this is probably not true (as evidenced by the various angles of the shots), it does seem to be just that for the most part; along with the audio. It's interesting and I don't think anyone has ever done it before.

The video quality of most surveillance cameras is not very good and since this movie attempts to appear as though the footage was shot from those cameras, it doesn't always look very good. Indeed, I have seen real footage from surveillance cameras on the news where they show someone who has committed a crime and ask for help if anyone recognizes the perpetrators. But - the picture is so bad that it's not possible even if that person was your best friend!

The film claims that there are approximately 30 million surveillance cameras in the United States, and that the average citizen is captured on one as many as 200 times in an average day. That's probably an exageration, but I think most of have come to accept this as part of the cost of maintaining our security. As is shown, the results of the images captured can help or hurt depending on how they are used.

It comes with an audio commentary which adds additional insights into the goings-ons.",1244332800,,1611,4.525773195876289
3790745,3,B001TIGFE2,"The concept of this film appealed to me--following the lives of strangers through surveillance cameras.  It had never occurred to me that so much footage of people is recorded daily that almost every public aspect of our lives is now an open book. Observation is now so common that most of us forget that we are constantly being observed in offices, lobbies, malls, stores, ATM machines, convenience stores, buses, schools, parking lots, jails, by cell phones, nanny cams, etc.  So, we act ""normally"" or perversely, according to our characters, oblivious that such behavior has been captured and documented.

This film uses surveillance cameras (for the most part) to track the lives of strangers whose lives may or may not interconnect. There are numerous storylines (tracking murderers, closet homosexuals, car chases, unfaithful spouses, sexual harassment, kidnapping, statutory rape, and so on) that more or less reach a denouement by the conclusion.

The concept of the film is innovative, but the execution is fair at best. The greatest contribution is that it makes you think, and next time when out in public, hopefully remember to be careful, that you probably are being watched and recorded.",1244332800,,1201,5.2072538860103625

Of course, it wasn't, so when Look was advertised I was excited to see it.

Look follows a number of subplots that grow more and more interconnected as the movie goes on.  There's one about a statutory rape, one about a closet homosexual, and another about a philandering department store manager.  There's no main plot, and the subplots are not all that interesting.  The acting is ok (obviously low budget).  There are a few funny parts, and lots of nudity.

The premise of Look is simple: since there are so many security cameras installed in our society, one could follow a story told entirely through their video feeds.  Look is not entirely successful at premise fidelity.  It seems like most of the footage is made up of real security camera material that has been staged with actors to tell a story (other parts of the video are taken from real events--like a police chase filmed from a police helicopter).  However, in addition to editing the security camera video to tell the story, the director chose to do a lot of other things too (zoom in on key characters, use dramatic panning, etc.)  This, in my opinion, takes away from the experience.  I'd rather feel that I was personally discovering the important parts of the video (for instance, noticing that a character is recurring).  This director chose to stop the video and zoom into a section of the picture, then zoom back out and continue.  It's a message to the viewer that says ""hey, notice this"".  But every time it did that I had already noticed the important part.  For me it was redundant.

So, to sum it up, Look is an ok movie.  It has an interesting premise that gets partially violated, the acting is ok, the subplots are ok, etc.  What I would like to see (and haven't) is a movie made up entirely of security camera video with no zooms or pans, and with only 1 main plot that is very compelling.  Look is not that.  Since there is no main plot, there is no buildup of tension or drama, and the movie just sort of peters out at the end.",1244160000,,2368,5.005115089514066

There was no doubt the naked teenage girls gyrating in the dressing room were not real. In fact, my initial reaction was that I had accidentally received a soft porn video.

The premise of the movie was a good idea, but the execution was poor. There were a few compelling moments:  the man following the mother and child in the mall should give any parents chills, and remind them never to leave a child unattended in public, ever. The high school teacher storyline was also interesting, but the Lolita-like student was unrealistic. I didn't feel anything was gained by viewing this movie.

It's an irresistibly voyeuristic movie that tracks five interwoven plot lines as seen through surveillance cameras in parking lots, convenience stores, ATMs, elevators, offices shopping malls, schools, hotels, department stores, police car dash-cams, nanny-cams, and other locations.
Rifkin actually shot the whole thing in HD, positioning his cameras where surveillance cameras would be mounted, then processed the images to look like they were shot on surveillance cameras of varying degrees of quality and disrepair, adding convincing-looking time/date/location stamps. The only clue that we're not looking through actual surveillance cameras is the quality of sound from the mic-ed actors. It's far cleaner and clearer than the ambient sound some surveillance cameras capture.
The story lines are innovative, believable and full of interesting - and sometimes creepy - twists and surprises.

3790750,2,B001TIGFE2,"Look (Adam Rifkin, 2007)

You know, I've now seen a number of movies that have this general structure, and I've been dissatisfied with almost every one of them. While watching Look, I finally figured out why this is; everything's tied up in far too neat a package, which lends movies like this far too constructed an air for their cinema verite aspirations. But I'm getting ahead of myself; let me explain what I'm on about first.

Billed as ""the first film shot entirely on surveillance cameras"" (which is, in at least one scene, a false claim), Look chronicles a series of interrelated stories that dovetail and converge again over the course of the movie. There are a number of tangled plot threads, all of which bounce around and involve multiple characters. There's also the fact that every plot description I could give would involve major spoilers, since the film sets up most of the key plot points as surprises, so I can't really go into even the first details of the plots. So I'm stuck just telling you the structure, but the structure is exactly what I was talking about in the first paragraph. Timecode, 11:14, and a number of other films have taken this tack (Pulp Fiction obviously does as well, but the structure here differs in that the people keep bumping into one another in different plot threads, which is basically Pulp Fiction carried to its absurd conclusion and with a lot more needless complexity), and while I know they all have a cadre of fans, including this one, I've never found one where this approach works. Ever notice how they all have a gimmick? With Timecode it was the four screens, with this one it's the surveillance cameras, with 11:14 it was everything having to come together at just that moment, etc., etc. Which is another way the verite feel is undercut. But I digress. No, I actually don't; this is all about trying to take an artificial construct and make it look as if it's a natural progression. It just doesn't work for me. (And in this case, to make matters worse, I'd somehow gotten it into my head that this movie was actually a documentary about surveillance cameras.)

That said, if you can take it as an artificial construct and overlook Rifkin's blatant attempts to make it not look like one, it's not a half-bad film in a couple of different ways. The acting in this flick is wildly inconsistent, but in order for that to happen, there have to be a few good actors to balance out the bad. Unfortunately, because of the way the film is shot, there are a number of names missing from my notes, and it's most of them that I want to praise. But I can't say that the stoner whose voice kept reminding me of Robert Downey Jr.'s really impressed me. (Oh, wait. I just did.) And some of the music in this movie was absolutely priceless. No, I'm not talking about ""Electrocuted"", though the awfulness of this song is reason enough to at least rent the movie and watch the first twenty minutes. Go a lot farther in. The scene where George is about to get on the bus with the suspicious guy carrying the backpack? Whatever it is that's playing there, that's real music. That's actually one of the best tracks I've heard in a movie I've seen this year that wasn't directed by Masami Akita. (Most of you will probably watch that scene and say ""what music?"". Yes.)

Overall, while I'm not either Ben or Ben from At the Movies, this time I'm going to have to give it a Ben and Ben rating: rent it. There are enough amusing moments, enough decent acting, and enough brilliant (non-)music to make it worth checking out once, but make sure it's something you'll want to watch again before buying. **",1243814400,3,3640,4.569678407350689

LOOK is shot unlike any movie I've ever seen. By using only security cameras you know it took a lot of work to make these various stories work and connect in a cinematic fashion. The acting is at times believable and at others the performances will remind you that you are just watching a movie.

Overall, LOOK is worth viewing once if for no other reason than to show just how much Big Brother is really watching us everyday.

When I selected this film to review I was interested in seeing a depiction of just how often we think we are experiencing privacy when we aren't. That was, after all, how the film was described in its promotional materials.  What I saw was a lot of stereotyping and poor execution of the primary character: security cameras. To summarize, using mock footage this film shows a glimpse of a handful of peoples' lives and how they intersect, sometimes unknowingly, from the perspective of their paths crossing on hidden cameras--ATMs, public security, private security, cell phone cams, personal video cameras... The whole plot was setup and driven by various perspectives of surveillance shots leading to climaxes of all the various arcs of the plot. The thing is, of at least six of the arcs, only *one* was driven completely from beginning to end with the hidden camera. All of the others could have been the result of a device already at work in the arc, itself, or by the ensemble cast crossing paths at strategic points... The need for the surveillance became moot in most of the subplots. I really wanted the film to demonstrate how the various situations were influenced (or weren't) by having been filmed. I thought that was the whole point of the film. The film is described as being a thriller that reveals just how often we are being filmed when we think we aren't. It's really just a glimpse of people going through their lives as revealed on videotapes, with no real direction. Its description implies show-and-tell, but there's only ""show. No ""tell"" draws it together. If you want to gauge just how often you are being filmed in public, that scary revelation is well-captured. Just don't look for its supposed statement on how much we are influenced by that fact.",1243728000,,2053,4.81586402266289

Actually, I lied, it starts off all nice and chipper, however, for dramatic purposes, we're thrown into the lives of several people who will all interact, via Crash style, in each others lives one way or another.
did I mention the whole is filmed in a surveillance style. Whether its a cop car, an office camera, bathroom camera, parking lot surveillance , anything is used to tell the story. Just not a regular camera. the film is designed to show you how we can capture anything, at any moment.
there are several intersecting stories, one involving a teenage girl who is trying to seduce a teacher, a convenient store clerk (an awesome Giuseppe Andrews) and his friend, a lawyer and his affair, a cop killing, a department store manager(first timer Hayes Macarthur, who is funny as hell) and his various indiscretions, and the frequent tormenting of a fellow employee in an office building. The film also tackles heavy subject matter which may turn off a lot of viewers, for instance the big three are, racial profiling, adultery and child abduction. The movie as it unfolds is a haunting exercise in what we are capable of seeing at any give moment.
Some uncontrollable mistakes can have the most devastating effects, and the most gut churning criminals can get away scott free, its all how it plays out. We are meant to look into these lives as if we are dropped in for a week.
I didn't know how the vocabulary of the film would work, but it works wonderfully, everything is  believable, very few instances actually take you out of the picture to make you realize its only a movie, but thats part of its genius. We as compulsive human beings, are accustomed to watching the internet videos, the highlight cop reels, the reality tv shows, that we grasp onto the screen, without missing a single hint or beat. Subconsciously we want to believe this is real, so it has more of an impact. There are scenes of true harrowing nature, that the performers, even though they faces are slightly unrecognizable, emote more emotion than any Oscar contender in the last couple of years. I'm talking pain like 'Notes on a Scandal'. No matter how mundane something on the screen is, its means something. There are big laughs and rough shocks that happen, but its a work of genius. Most could pass it off as a masturbatory work of fiction. But this film is a better Crash. Not that I'm saying academy take notice, its just this is a fantastic movie, that will find its audience.
No matter how you look at it, its a new driving force in contemporary indie film, this years high tech 'Clerks'. (hell I watched it twice within a couple of days), plus it boosts a haunting score by composer BT.
If not that, then a fine work in creativity.
Sure to be a cult classic.

If one were to go for content, ""Look"" not just pokes fun at our society, but brings up some interesting points. At what point do we put our foot down to say enough is enough? When do we say that this surveillance thing has gone too far? What will we do without that same surveillance to protect our citizenry? This is all academic, but the director leaves you to decide. After all, you are the one being watched.

There are basically three stories being told, and you get to see how each plays out. There are also satellite stories to round out the subject matter. I found ""Look"" to be an entertaining bit of voyeurism. Yes, George Orwell would have been proud (or maybe more accurately dismayed) at how society is fitting itself into the model he created in ""1984"". Of course, the Telescreen thing is impossible to achieve, you cannot watch everyone EVERY single second of the day. Who's watching the watchers? See what I mean?

Maybe this is as close as we'll ever come, but it's unnerving in any case.

Once surveillance becomes an accepted practice, there goes our freedom. Is this just paranoia? Maybe. but once there are no secrets, there is no humanity. I don't know about you, but MY private life is nothing to be paraded in front of people I don't know.

All things considered, though, ""Look"" will alternately be funny and maddening, depending on how much of private life you think CAN be shown to folk you don't know. While it provides no answers, you'll be too busy laughing or screaming at the T.V. to care!

We have a story about various people in SoCal living out several days as seen through the cams and surveillance monitors in malls, ATMs, convenience stores, workplaces, and everywhere else. Aside from the legal issue of not being able to record audio here in CA, the boring drama of ten people I care nothing about, the tedious articulation of adulterous affairs, stalkers, pedophiles, killers, gay lovers, pranksters, Clerks wannabes and a few other idiots - I guess you could see a good movie.

Tons to dislike about this mess, including massive amounts of misplaced music (since technically this is supposed to be surveillance footage), poor video quality (I know on purpose), the blotting out of actor's faces in the police scenes (uhhh, I thought they were actors), and sad stories ripped from the headlines, etc.

The director summed up the main fault of the story by saying an ""overlord"" takes all of this footage and puts it together for us to see - oookaaaay, right. There are 14 minutes of outtakes and 47 minutes of alternate scenes. Plenty here for the fans of the film, and I am sure there are those who would rank this in their top 10. Skipper for me - maybe a recommendation for those conspiracy types.",1241222400,6,1548,4.663003663003663
3790758,5,B001TIGFE2,"I saw this film when it came out at a nearby art house and have been haunted by it ever since.  It one of those great little films that you've probably never heard of but should have.  A very provocative, sexy, and disturbing look at our modern world where we're unaware that we're almost always being watched.",1239840000,3,310,4.421052631578948
3790759,5,B001TIGFE2,"Of all of Adam Rikin's films, LOOK is by far my favorite. I was afraid the movie being filmed from the point of view of surveillance cameras would grow very old or be very gimmicky from the start- but that was completely NOT the case. The voyeuristic medium was realistic and undoubtedly the only way to tell the interweaving stories of random people living their lives in some random city on one random given week. It's dramatic, it's funny, and it's REAL.",1239494400,3,457,4.585365853658536
3790760,5,B001TIGFE2,"I saw this film at a small indie theater in New York, and was surprised that it didn't have a bigger release. The movie brings a lot of attention to all those little cameras that catch most of us an average of 200 times a day! Before seeing this film, I hardly thought about how often my image was caught. I'm so glad I got the chance to see this film when it came out. The film also has some great songs in the soundtrack too; one of the actors actually wrote several of the songs himself. Recently I saw 'Look' in an episode of MTV's True Life the other day, and that's what inspired me to come and check for a DVD release on Amazon. I bought the pre-sale and can't wait for it to ship!",1239062400,2,688,4.029197080291971
8341548,5,B001TIGFE2,Original. Nice to see something that is different. And not the same thing over and over.,1471046400,2,88,4.5625
8341549,5,B001TIGFE2,"Wow!!! A very original movie basically showing footage of video cameras in malls,restrurants,parking lots, schools,etc,etc. This very good original thriller has about 6 or 7 different storys of peoples lives being taped without their knowledge and its a very,very good idea and movie. Not exactly a found footage but the next best thing. I would love to see Look 2 and Look 3!!! Question..does anyone have a guess on what happened to the little girl at the mall???",1409616000,,464,4.961538461538462

8341551,5,B001TIGFE2,Thrilling movie with a great concept! It is amazing that a movie shot with security cameras could work so well!,1383955200,,111,4.6
8341552,4,B001TIGFE2,"Adam Rifkin's masterful movie does two things: makes us aware of how there is virtually no privacy out there in public and how what we do can be recorded and used against us, or just for others' voyeuristic pleasures: and, it is a self-reflexive look at how we see ourselves. His masterful intertwining of several stories at once--all interconnected--could have been a mess had any novice director made it. However, Rifkin is a master of his craft here. A real gem of a sleeper.",1376611200,,478,4.7023809523809526
8341553,3,B001TIGFE2,"The acting in this film is quite good, no doubt enhanced by the fact that none of the performers have probably appeared on screen enough to be remembered by viewers.  And if the filming was actually completed in just 15 days, as is mentioned in the ""documentary,"" then everyone is to be congratulated (the documentary is often as amusing as the film itself.)  If the film comprised actual surveillance footage, the mundane quality of some of the goings-on would be expected.  But considering that everything is contrived, the result seems not especially imaginative.",1353456000,,566,5.064516129032258
8341554,4,B001TIGFE2,"This movie certainly makes one think about our world today and takes away that  ""I-can-get-away-with-anything"" sense of security that some people seem to have. If you allow yourself to ""feel"" what you're watching, you might actually benefit from seeing it. If it doesn't disturb you at least a little, you aren't ""feeling.""",1345334400,2,323,5.211538461538462
8341555,4,B001TIGFE2,"There are a lot of improbabilities in ""Look"": e.g., Isn't it illegal to install surveillance cameras in dressing rooms? Ah well, I guess some department stores do that anyway, especially when there is a film to be made and nubile young flesh to be shown. Many of the characters--Sherri the spoiled and hormonally crazed teenager, Marty the arch-nerd, etc--are utter stereotypes, yet they are well-done (especially with the help of realistic scripts) even as stock characters, and the reasons why they must be so clichd become evident as one watches. One of the biggest redeeming virtues is the excellent pacing of the film: It moves quickly but smoothly from one to another set of characters and situations, and there are enough interesting twists to where the audience hardly even has to make an effort to suspend disbelief. Unlike many films that utilize this multiple frame-story technique, each episode of ""Look"" is well-developed and contributes in some meaningful way to the grand whole. Along with the fact that it's simply very fun to watch, perhaps the best things about ""Look"" are the morals to its stories. It clearly shows the pervasive impact of hidden cameras in our society and how they have the power to acquit as well as condemn,even if they don't generally capture voices and details in quite the way that's shown here. Many other important messages can be found, most notably ""No matter how overwhelming the temptation becomes, adults MUST avoid affairs with minor teenagers."" Those looking for an exercise in sober realism should look elsewhere; otherwise, most with some tolerance for violence and grit will like, perhaps even love, at least some aspects of ""Look.""",1341100800,,1686,5.068345323741007
8341556,5,B001TIGFE2,"a really interesting movie, told through ""surveillance footage"" (the movie was shot on digital, not real surveillance cameras) of different cameras within the same town. at times it was hard to watch- the audience comes to the realization that people do horrible things when they don't think they are being watched. it is unsettling and affecting, and shows the darker underbelly of what being a human being means.",1326672000,,414,5.102941176470588
