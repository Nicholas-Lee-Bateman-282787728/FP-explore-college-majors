8404846,5,B003T05STQ,"If you love B rated horror movies like I do- this is one of the better ones. If you love clown horror movies, like I do- give this one a chance. I really love Tommy Brunswick and her movies. This is one of her best ones. Yes, some of the acting is lacking in this movie and some of the lighting seems to be quite dark in some places. However, this is very effective with some of the scenes with Mr. Jingles to give it that extra edge. John Anton who plays Mr Jingles in this movie does a faboulus job. One of the best actors ever playing a demented clown. He has this role nailed. The costume and make up are excellent too. He is definitely creepy in this movie and has the clown act down. The best parts of the movie is him in action. Let me also say that this movie does move right along. Another big plus for b horror movies- a lot of them are horrible and can drag...but this moves at a very good pace and there is really no dead time in the movie. Give this one a chance. It's loaded with extras too. I really enjoyed the extras a lot as well. I hope they come out with another Jingles related movie.",1314921600,,1105,4.027272727272727
