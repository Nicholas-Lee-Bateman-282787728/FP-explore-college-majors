2195652,5,B0006U3SY4,"I remember watching this as a kid and man was this an awesome show.  This show was more real about teenage topics than any show has ever been.  They delt with suicide, teenage pregnancy, sex, dating, abortions... the list goes on and on.  The stories didn't end up with cheesy sappy endings either.  They were real and gritty.  Thank goodness this is finally out on DVD.  I'd advise everyone to get it.",1104278400,2,402,4.513888888888889

2195691,5,B0006U3SY4,"Degrassi Junior High was a big hit in my teens and I am glad it is now available for viewing. I would recommend this show be watched by parents and older tweens/ young teens together as a family so that intelligent and deep discussions can be had. The series does not flinch away from dealing with difficult subjects such as teenage drinking, alcoholism in the family, child abuse, peer pressure, teen pregnancy, and more. The young actors portraying the character roles are incredibly convincing in their respective roles, which is all the more amazing considering that most of the actors had no prior acting experience. This works to great advantage in the show as the performances come across as genuine. A word of caution though: parents need to be sure their children are ready for some of the subjects tackled here. I held off on my fifth-grader watching some of the episodes as I felt she wasn't ready for the issues tackled within, while some others were just right for a soon-to-be middle schooler. Overall, this Canadian TV production, despite some of the outdated things like fashion, outdated technology etc. has certainly stood the test of time in the issues being addressed.",1439078400,3,1188,4.8861386138613865

The stories are about real-life, common issues at that age in a school environment. Although, I have not yet seen anything yet about criminal gang influence or intentional, group classroom disruption. Those are problematic in several schools located in Houston, TX and surrounding areas.",1415836800,,426,5.373134328358209

2195735,1,B0006U3SY4,"My 14 year old daughter watched the first episode and barely got through it. She found it overly dramatic, not true-to-life, and just flat out boring. I realize the children of today aren't easily entertained from shows from previous generations, especially with all the CGI's and technically enhanced advancements they see in current TV and movies, but she is open-minded and willing to try anything once. I would say this is for teens not looking forward to great television shows depicting real-life in relation to their own generation, or simply needing to just be entertained because there is nothing better to watch. Definitely a show that is more intended for teens from that era.",1402617600,,687,5.035087719298246
2195736,5,B0006U3SY4,"I used to watch this show every Sunday evening without fail.  The characters are so developed that each one has their own specific reaction to whichever topic comes up - and this show deals with a lot of topics: teen pregnancy, adoption, cheating, crushes, homosexuality, abuse, alcohol, divorce, latchkey children and more. (and that is just in the first season).  Just hearing the theme music gets me all revved up to enjoy another episode with the awesome characters of: Joey Jeremiah - the fun-loving boy with an image, Spike-the girl who looks rough on the outside, but is reasonable, mature and caring, Kathleen - the judgmental person who you aren't certain if she might tattle, Caitlin - the smart sensible student who sometimes can get silly, Snake - the tall, redheaded freckle-faced heartthrob/Melanie's crush.  Loved it!",1401840000,,832,5.102941176470588
2195737,3,B0006U3SY4,"I watched this Canadian show about students at Degrassi Junior High when I was a high school student. Watching episodes again brought back great memories. I also used to watch a show called ""Ready Or Not"" which was on around the same time this show originally aired. I have tried to find that show to watch again. I haven't been successful. I wish it were an Amazon Prime member show. Anyway, Degrassi Junior High is a very good show for teenagers to watch. It tackles some tough issues with its storylines. Give it a watch.",1400371200,,524,4.526315789473684
2195738,4,B0006U3SY4,"Very cool show. I didn't even know degrassi went back as far as the 80 ' s but I have to say, I like it better than the Next Generation Degrassi. The acting is a tad corny sometimes but I think it adds to the appeal of the show.",1399507200,,228,3.673469387755102
2195739,5,B0006U3SY4,"Very few programs offer any true benefit or learning experience for our children today, but this show entertains, relates to everyday issues in the lives of the children and gives incentive to think. Kudos on a grand scale.",1398988800,,223,4.894736842105263

2195741,5,B0006U3SY4,"I love the new degrassi but the old ones were on another level. Loved seeing people from this show in degrassi next generation. I was surprised to see snake ( mr Simpson ) as a kid as well as spike and Joey. They did not change one bit. Even mr Raditch. Clearly, the new degrassi recycles stories from the 80""s degrassi",1396396800,,319,4.245901639344262
2195742,3,B0006U3SY4,"My daughter  who will be going into middle school liked it well enough,  covered decent topics, poor acting.  You got to love the 80s",1394928000,,133,4.458333333333333
2195753,5,B0006U3SY4,"Degrassi JH was a PBS show made in the late eighties that addressed and dramatized problems kid might face in their middle school years. We are so overjoyed to have DJH at our home and at our beck and call. Since my daughter got sex ed classes last year in the fourth grade, I figured, ""What the heck?"", and decided to enter the portal of preteen angst, crushes, and tough quizzes. My daughter will be entering middle school next year (2014-2015) anyway. Any topic that comes up in a DJH episode that I or a teacher has not covered as of yet can be discussed if desired- I have a mouth for a reason! If my daughter does not ask, I leave it for another time, because there is time. Let me stroll down memory lane here for a sec...

""How I loved Degrassi JH at age fifteen...better late than never. PBS was my secret love. No one knew I watched this show. I wanted to be punker than Spike, drunker than Stephanie, smarter than Voula, chicer than Lucy, and have hair more luscious than Ms. Avery's. O.K., so I did eventually get drunker than Stephanie. This show challenged me, enlightened me, and delighted me. I now pass on its legacy to an early preteen who is very sassy and saavy."" -Amy Steele, age forty

Here are some of the topics dealt with on this superb show: Divorce, alcoholism, unwanted touches, depression, drug use and its consequences, dissing of friends, lying, stealing, teen pregnancy, death, different forms of sexuality, racism, physical abuse, boobs, rumors, facing illnesses, fears, failure, censorship, bullies, love gone wrong, parties gone wrong, eating disorders, runaways, braces, remarriage, choices, and  wet dreams. A cornucopia of subjects that we parents do not always know how to broach with our kids...I sat with my daughter through 90% of the episodes and kept the ""pause"" button on the remote within easy reach so we could talk while watching. She has already experienced a few of the above listed topics, and I hope that this show acting as a conduit to other life events will make her feel less alone and confused.

Extras: When a bit older, some of the actors from Degrassi went across Canada and interviewed teens, young adults, and even their fellow actors on various topics. The hourish show was called ""Degrassi Talks"". Interesting and informative, with humor interspersed via honest humans. Topics are: Sex, sexuality, drugs, alcohol, depression, and abuse.

Other extras are a few pop quizzes on the show, and printable materials for educators that my computer will not let me access. DVDs have scene selection, wallpaper, and closed captions.

I disagree with the top negativeish reviewer; I feel that the quality of the film is fine and crisp.

Now, onto the price...getting the three seasons separately rather than in one mega-set is way cheaper. I cannot tell ya what extras are on the mega-set, but it was the show I was after, not the extras. I spent a little over twenty bucks instead of about double that by going with the separate seasons.

If you are an edgy, sometimes wistful adult with curious preteens, share this show. Then move on to ""Degrassi High"" when deemed fit (subject matter gets more intense).

""Everybody face up to the the facts as they are...""  -The Zit Remedy (Degrassi's house band)",1394150400,,3255,4.775800711743773
2195754,5,B0006U3SY4,Although this setting is back in the 80's it is great for preteens and teens.  I sit with my daughter and watch the new episodes.  Now I found these from 1987 and they are set for a younger crowd.  It is everyday problems and issues that can occur.  Great show.  Should be more shows like this.,1393459200,,294,4.178571428571429
2195755,5,B0006U3SY4,"Stephanie Kaye, the toothless wonder. As in, I wonder how anybody would cast somebody with missing teeth with gaps in between the yellow, plaque-crusted mongoloid chompers that she has left in her head. At least tell her to keep her lips shut when she smiles. Eventually she gets a fake tooth put in to replace the missing one, but it sticks out like a sore thumb, being the only white tooth in her whole face. Every scene with her in in makes me cringe, and I cant help but to be completely focused on that ugly, yellow, crooked scourge of the ADA that she passes off as a smile. What a relief when they wrote her out of the show, how she ever made it onto the cast in the first place is a mystery to me, maybe they just felt sorry for her? Still, when casting for the girl that is supposed to be the hottest girl in school, with the flashiest clothes who gets all the attention from the boys, wouldnt it have possibly been a good idea to cast somebody with all her teeth, who actually brushes them? Just my 2 cents :)",1392249600,,1019,4.204081632653061
2195756,5,B0006U3SY4,"Watched this as a kid, very silly and campy; however, some of the shows make it work.  This is silly fun for when you want to laugh.",1392163200,,132,3.888888888888889
2195757,4,B0006U3SY4,"Although the comic aspect of the show is played up a lot, it appropriately acts as a sort of palate cleanser against the gravitas of other issues that the program addresses.  Although it's not a ""realistic"" portrayal of junior high, I think it's a convincing one, and like Degrassi High (the series that follows this one), this show ""takes on"" controversial issues in genuine ways that don't disappoint the viewer in the end.

I actually watched the later series (Degrassi High) before this one.  The producers imposed an over-arching story curve to both series.  Character development and even irony are cleverly handled--unusual for a show from the 80s I think.",1391126400,,663,5.0
2195758,5,B0006U3SY4,Loved this as a tween and watched it again for old times sake. I don't find much like this anymore for our current youth.,1390867200,,121,4.083333333333333

2195773,5,B0006U3SY4,I remember when this series first aired on WGBH Boston. The series tackles difficult topics for kids...peer pressure...drinking...teen pregnancy....always in a thoughtful way. I think the series would  be a great tool for parents and teachers to watch and discuss with their kids.,1376784000,,280,5.511627906976744

2195775,4,B0006U3SY4,I watched this show as a child in the 1980's. It was thought provoking in its own right to a child of the 80's. It may not hit close to home for children of a different era but it was spot on for those of us growing up at that time. The shock of teenage pregnancy and drug/alcohol use made this show a great tool to help with growing pains. The producers and writers of this show were excellent in catching the feelings of the characters and the struggles each one endured in regular life. I can recommend this show to anyone who has the ability to look past the clothes and the dated language to the subject matter beyond it. In a few years I will let my kids watch it. The lessons learned are timeless and I will enjoy following the life of the students again and maybe have a laugh at myself and the style of clothing I grew up with. I recommend this show just based on the impact it had on my life as a pre-teen in the 80's.,1364083200,,928,4.048913043478261

2195777,5,B0006U3SY4,"I used to watch this show from time-to-time when I was in my teen years.  I had completely forgotten about it until I came across it in a local store.  It took some digging through my memory before I finally remembered what it was (hey...what can I say?  My memory ain't what it used to be).  It was an exciting moment, as I suddenly recalled how much I had enjoyed this show as a kid.  I ended up purchasing all 3 seasons and have been gradually watching them (I like to take my time and kind of ""save"" shows I really like).  It is as fun watching it as an adult as it was when I watched it as a kid.  It doesn't have all of the glossy, high-budget features of most shows today, which is what I think gives ""Degrassi"" a lot of its charm and realism.  It's been really nice to find this old friend again.",1360713600,,804,4.044303797468355

I'm a huge fan of Degrassi the next generation as I've been watching it since it's first appearence on the-n. But when you watch the original degrassi junior high, it's so much different. I love how ""broomhead"" is the word that was used as an insult! Hah, this show is so old-school, definetely a show to buy if you're a fan of degrassi the next generation, you'll love this even better.",1172275200,3,467,4.5058823529411764
2195780,1,B0006U3SY4,"Makes you feel like jumping off a bridge- but it's cool if you wanna go back in time to the best decade ever- the 80's.

The pregnant girl Spike has an awful hair do, even for the 80s, and gets knocked up at like 14. She's kind of annoying, but funny if only to watch that horrible hair do. Then there's the skanky school president who puts on slutty outfits when she gets to school. (Otherwise her mom would freak) She's kinda fun.....but the outfits and make up she wears make her look ugly. I don't know how she thought she looked sexxy that way. She looked better without the make up, and normal clothes. The long skirts were ugly, however. Speaking of ugly, I don't recall one attractive actor in the entire show. Not only that- But they were dreadful actors! They must of been children of the directors, producers, whoever came up with the show, whoever had the $ to get their kid on the show, etc. Nonetheless it was a crappy show, you can maybe enjoy if your feeling depressed.",1126656000,2,985,4.382513661202186
2195781,5,B0006U3SY4,"This show is pure goodness, and the writing is awesome. It is the kind of show that has things you don't notice until the 2nd or 10th time you watch it! Screw shows like 902010 and them, THIS is school! Many of the characters are very reminiscent of kids I went to school with (I was in junior high in the mid 90s, this was in the late 80s), especially characters like Stephanie Kaye(the stuck up girl who dressed like a whore), her younger brother Arthur Kobawalski, Spike, and course the infamous Zit Remedy (Joey, Snake, and Wheels). Melanie is awesome as well! They actually showed this Canadian show on PBS down here in the States from like 91-95, they showed the High School ones as well. I love it and I believe it is HIGHLY under-rated! The best episodes in this season are, in my opinion, ""The Experiment"", ""The Cover Up"", ""The Great Race"", and the famous ""It's Late"" episode. Special mention to ""The Best Laid Plans"" for a great title, story, and BADASS 80's music! Get this and you will warp back to the late 80s! I recommend any season of Degrassi Junior High or Degrassi High. There is a new generation out nowadays but I don't find it nearly as interesting, it is too polished and high budget, one of the great things about the original was the low budget feel to it! RECOMMENDED!",1124582400,,1294,4.4641350210970465
2195792,5,B0006U3SY4,"Even though I was only 2 when Degrassi Junior High first came out. I watched when it was on Nickelodeon here. I had already watched Degrassi Next Generation and wanted to know what Spike, Joey, Caitlin and Snake were like. I loved it when I saw it. It dealt with just about every teen issue under the sun. Series one was great with the series opener being about Stephanie Kaye running for president with her new image. Another good episode was when shy Melanie was concerned with her lack of chest. Another episode I like was when Joey found out that Rick was been beaten by his dad. The one were Spike got pregnant was also great. The reaction to Steph's dress sense in the 80's was interesting to see. As too now heaps of girls dress like Stephanie. My sister being one. And there isn't as a big shock to it as there was 18 years ago.",1121212800,,836,4.2974683544303796
2195793,4,B0006U3SY4,"I'll never forget how in the late '80s, I would end each day with a snack in front of the TV, while taking in another episode of the educational, teenage soap opera, ""Degrassi Junior High"" on PBS. The show's school bell would ring and that endlessly addictive pop theme song would begin, meaning the start of another great show. Each episode would look at a single problem or issue, that confronted teenagers in our modern society. This included discussions about a variety of topics such as dating, child abuse, drugs, women's rights, teen sex, homosexuality, adoption, teen pregnancy and even the ability to just fit in. The show took place in a fictional, Canadian Junior High and showed kids from all walks of life, ethnicity and social groups. Each episode would feature an issue, while weaving together in a soap opera-ish style, the interests, problems and relationships of the large cast. Just some of the popular characters included the underachieving & sneaky, Joey Jeramiah (Pat Mastroianni), the sexually assertive school President, Stephanie (Nicole Stoffman) her nerdy little brother, Arthur (Duncan Waugh), the caring and concerned, Caitlin (Stacie Mistysin), tough guy, Rick (Craig Driscoll) rock guitarist, Snake (Stephan Brogan) and his friend and fellow bass player, Wheels (Neil Hope). The adults in their world included two teachers, the strict and rather condesending, Mr. Raditch (Dan Williams) and the  always caring, dream of a teacher, Ms. Avery (Michelle Goodeve). In the first season we are just being introduced to the many characters, episode by episode. Interesting story arcs include Stephanie becoming school President, Wheels coming to terms with adoption and meeting his biological father and most importantly, Spike finding out, that she has become pregnant. The show is far from perfect. Some of the plots strayed into ""ABC After School Special"" territory and some of dialogue didn't exactly sound realistic to the way teenagers actually talk. Also, some of the kids are a little shakey in their acting skills, sounding like they were giving stilted line readings from a 'Charlie Brown' cartoon. But this would all greatly improve in later seasons. The thing about this show is that it's both endlessly addictive and entertaining as each plot and story arc progresses. It's sort of like eating potatoe chips ... you can't just eat one. Viewing one episode, leads to the need to see the next one. This is an excellent show, that I would recommend to both teenagers and adults alike!",1119312000,3,2518,5.156479217603912
2195794,5,B0006U3SY4,"Everyone's favourite angst-ridden teens finally come to DVD in DEGRASSI JUNIOR HIGH.

All 13 episodes of the groundbreaking first season are featured in this set.  The series was a bold spinoff from the short-lived afterschool series THE KIDS OF DEGRASSI STREET, and was groundbreaking in that it approached topics like peer pressure, teen violence, suicide, sex and pregnancy with well-written and intelligent storylines.  This series remains, 15 years later, quality television for the pre-teens and teens sets (adults will appreciate the writing and amazing acting from the talented cast), and stands up well to repeat screenings.

Season One introduces some of the most-loved characters like Caitlin (Stacie Mistysyn), Yick (Siluck Saysanasy), Wheels (Neil Hope), Melanie (Sara Ballingall),  Joey Jeremiah (Pat Mastroianni), Spike (Amanda Stepto), Stephanie Kaye (Nicole Stoffman) and Snake (Stefan Brogren).

Episodes included:

""Kiss Me Steph"" - Stephanie Kaye decides to use her newfound popularity to run for School President, personally ensuring every male vote of the school, and  using her brainy best friend Voula (Niki Kemeny) to run the campaign.

""The Big Dance"" - It's time for the annual Fall Dance, but Voula's father has forbidden her to attend.  Stephanie gets drunk at Lucy's house and barely makes it to the event.

""The Experiment"" - Yick and Arthur (Duncan Waugh) try out for the basketball team, and Joey gets Kathleen (Rebecca Haines) and Megan into trouble when he sells them some `vitamins'.

""The Cover-Up"" - Joey discovers that Rick (Craig Driscoll) gets beaten up by his father.

""The Great Race"" - Melanie bemoans the fact that she's flat-chested and joins LD (Amanda Cook) in some bra-shopping.  The girls challenge the boys to a swimming competition.

""Rumor Has It"" - Kathleen starts spreading the vicious lie that Miss Avery (Michelle Goodeve)  is a lesbian, and Caitlin considers her own sexual orientation.

""The Best Laid Plans"" - Wheels musters up the courage to accompany Stephanie on a date...but will they or won't they?...

""Nothing to Fear"" - LD's life turns upside down when her father has to go to hospital, stirring up a lot of old memories about her mother's death.

""What a Night"" - Voula discovers why Lucy's (Anais Granofsky) wardrobe is so stylish.  When the two are arrested shoplifting, Voula's relationship with her father becomes even more strained.

""Smokescreen"" - Rick starts taking an interest in the school environmental group, and Caitlin decides to take him under her wing.

""It's Late!"" - Spike's period is late, following a night of recklessness with Shane (Bill Parrott).

""Parents' Night"" - Wheels must confront a lot of old demons when his birth father shows up virtually out of the blue.

""Revolution"" - In order to get Wheels' attention, Stephanie appoints Joey as the new Sports Rep., despite the fact that he's completely wrong for the job (it's a 7th grade post and Yick's dream job).  The 7th grade starts a revolt on Miss Stephanie Kaye...which may end in her downfall as School President.  This episode also marked the official debut of The Zit Remedy, Degrassi's legendary rock band sensation!

For it's legion of 80s' fans who used to race home from school every afternoon for their daily dose of DEGRASSI drama, knowing the series is now on DVD is a dream come true.",1118880000,10,3346,5.125461254612546
2195795,5,B0006U3SY4,"Where oh where to begin!  When ""Degrassi Junior High"" first came out in the late 80s, I was about 11 and loved it for the fact that the actors were real kids.  Add that to the fact that the budget for this show had to be miniscule at best--it was truly a guilty pleasure.  However, the show *did* portray everyday tween/teenager problems in a realistic, if sometimes heavy-handed, way.  And even though at times the viewer feels like they're watching something from a movie that ""Mystery Science Theater 3000"" would be lampooning, the messages of ""Degrassi Junior High"" resonate much, much more than nearly any other high school-set series (""Feaks and Geeks"" is at the top of that list).

Clearly ahead of its time in trying to reach a young crowd with issues ranging from sexuality, child abuse, and teen pregnancy, ""Degrassi Junior High"" definitely contains realistic and believable situations.  The DVD set comes with teaching supplements that would be helpful for any jr.high/hs teachers that are thinking of showing episodes in class.  I give this series an A+ for having its heart in the right place and not talking down to its audience.

Now--the REAL reason I enjoyed this DVD is because...man...it is SO late 80s/early 90s.  ESPECIALLY, the feature ""Degassi Talks..."" which features the cast members as themselves travelling around Canada and asking people on the street about drugs, sex, and sexuality.  I could listen to the Stacy Mistyrn-penned theme song all day long (""Degrassi talks...Degrassi listens..."").  Also a blast to watch are just the clothes, the endless abOOts, the haircuts, and the lamest teacher or all time -- Mr. Raditch.

So, you can't go wrong with this DVD.  You'll appreciate its honest portrayal of 12-15 year olds, but find much to laugh at in terms of the production values and overall 80s nostalgia.  The first season of ""Degrassi Jr. High"" is like watching a train that you know is going to crash, but every now and then, it passes through some beautiful scenery.",1115596800,6,2003,4.9226190476190474
2195796,5,B0006U3SY4,"Ahhh, my childhood would have never been the same without being able to come home from school to this classic teen drama. What made it so good? Well the issues it dealt with seemed real and not sensationalized mixed in with reoccurring characters who all gave a generally believable performances. It's great to be reacquainted with all the characters and story-lines again. However, in the first season of a show time is usually spent working out the kinks of how the show will flow and who the centre of focus is. This is no exception here as some of the subplots involving Arthur and Yick are very ""Kids Of Degrassi"" but the dark undertones are still in the series particularly the biggest major turning point in the series; Spike's pregnancy.

It's a shame they don't show this on television anymore, so few shows today exude a sense of genuine concern for its characters as Degrassi did.",1114128000,6,891,4.711538461538462

2195798,5,B0006U3SY4,These DVD's are awesome.  It's about time they came out on video.

2195801,3,B0006U3SY4,"I love this television show. It's release on DVD made me very happy. I watched this show when it was originally broadcasted on the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) television station in Toronto. It is a classic and it's DVD release was long overdue. I am a little disappointed though. The transfer is not of good quality. There are scratches and hair particles
in frame. I probably could have gotten a better quality picture if I had taped it off TV myself. The Boston public tv station WGBH who released the DVD should have put more effort into its picture quality. Also, I understand that this is not the complete original show. It is the version that was aired in America on public tv, which was edited and sanitized for American consumption. The original Canadian version was perfect. It should not have been tampered with. It is still a very worthwhile addition to my DVD collection and I think that you will enjoy it too.",1107907200,2,934,4.701219512195122
8043305,5,B0006U3SY4,I loved this show. I am 43 and watched it as a teen when it came out in the 80's and I still occasionally rewatch it for fun and nostalgia. Great show that was different in that it was funny but more serious than Saved by the Bell and seemed like to be more like real life than any other teen show of the day then or since. Kids today will probably laugh at it because there is no Iphone or internet but I am glad I grew up in a time where texting and facebooking weren't a thing and kids today should see what life was like back then.,1490140800,,535,3.8727272727272726
