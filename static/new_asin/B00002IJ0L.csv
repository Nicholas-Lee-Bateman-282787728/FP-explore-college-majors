7915860,4,B00002IJ0L,"The Ginyu Force is an ""elite"" fighting force, so confident that they cannot be betten that they seem to spend more time worring about making a showy pose than to think that there is a possibility that they can  be beaten.  Everyone will get a kick out them.  If you watch the dubbed  version, you'll hear the guy with the red skin and white hair, he has a  cool accent.  The ginyu force is strong and when they realize their poses  and their air of supiriority won't exactly win some fights, they don't mind  playing dirty. I'd tell you how it all goes but then you wouldn't be in  suspence and be dying to see the next episode, so i'll force you to watch  it and find out for yourself.",961804800,2,686,4.207692307692308
7915861,5,B00002IJ0L,"It's the GINYU FORCE!  Oh, after I finally saw this the other day, I felt soooo happy!  Seeing all the funny members of the Mutant Ginyu force is enough to make anyone laugh!  The only regret I have is that Frieza doesn't have the perfect  voice until after he's had a voice change.  If  you just LOVE the ginyu force, get this!  It will satisfy you greatly with  how moronic they appear, but are actually very strong!  It's a  great buy!  I promise!",961286400,2,450,4.301204819277109
7915862,4,B00002IJ0L,"This is just before they really improved.  There aren't a lot of cuts, which makes this DVD a good buy.  This is when the DBZ series really starts to become exciting, with the Namakien Dragon Balls, and Frieza getting  closer to making his wish for eternal life...sub or dub, this is still  good.  You should buy it.",960595200,,316,4.473684210526316
