8597152,5,B00DSAUIRE,"As the title says, this film relates the second volume of the adventures of the beloved knight errant, with the better- known episodes (windmills, sheep, shaving basin/helm) alluded to in the opening montage. In terms of setting, characterization, and overall production values this is by far the best treatment of Don Quixote that I have seen, and I've seen many.",1462492800,,364,5.083333333333333
