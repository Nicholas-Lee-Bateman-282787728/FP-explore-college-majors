There's also a ton of footage from the 70's with the Snake, Soul Patrol, Foo, Freddy and Ghost and many more.  Do you remember the nasty rivalry with Pittsburgh?  Doesn't get any better than that.

2080124,5,B0002DRDIC,"Raiders.... Raiders... Raiders...

You will learn something from this disk.  Very interesting stuff about the team we love.  This flick will make you proud to be a Raider.  To know just how much we have influenced the NFL and how ahead of our time our late great founder Mr. Al Davis was.  A man who recast a young Raiders in his own image and changed the league forever.  What a story.  What incredible players, larger than life cast offs who could do the impossible.  Why?  Because people like John Madden believed in them.  Stabler says ""John just pitched the playbook to me and said go win"".  Then he would drink all night and throw for a perfect season.

There is no more bad ass, kick ass, team in the NFL.  And there is no better gift for a Raider fan who doesnt already have this.

As a bonus the well restored 1977 match up against the Colts in the playoffs that went into double overtime and finished with one of the monumental plays the Raiders ever had is contained on disk two.

2080127,5,B0002DRDIC,"I first became aware of the Oakland Raiders of the AFL while watching Superbowll II on NBC Television. I think they broadcast the games on both CBS and NBC at the time as each league had it's own feed and broadcast. I recall seeing the huge papermache images of a Packer and Raider meeting in mid-field. Something about the color scheme and logo of the Raiders caught my eye, and thus a little poor kid, in the Housing Projects of New York City became a life long Raider fan. It has never, EVER been easy to be a part of Raider Nation on the east coast. Jet fans are cool, Giants fans are ambivilant and Patriot pukes just plain suck!!!! This DVD set is marvelous. It hits the highs, glosses the lows and has enough of the history and lore of the Raiders to warm any barbaians heart.  As my son, the Eagles fan, derides me for Al's decline and the Raiders current ineptitude I like to remind him that for all their current troubles, the Raiders have 3 times as many Super Bowl wins as do the Eagles. I love the Raiders and will bleed Silver and Black till I die.

2080129,5,B0002DRDIC,"Remember when the Raiders were actually good, and Al Davis was a genius?  No, too bad, because this collection will help you understand why this once proud franchise used to be in the top five in the NFL decade in and out until about 7 years ago.

I loved this, not only as a fan of the Jerry Rice, Tim Brown, Rod Woodson, Charlie Garner and Rich Gannon ""current"" Super Bowl team they featured, but because of all the games in the 60s and 70s I was too young to either remember or was not alive for.

2080143,3,B0002DRDIC,"Overall not bad. However, I was disappointed for a couple of reasons. First of all there are some inaccurate statements made by the narrator and I am surprised NFL FILMS did not edit the dvd before releasing it. It would have been professional. For example, the narrator states that after the 1972 Immaculate Reception game, the Raiders defeated the Steelers 3 straight games in a row. That is not true as the Steelers beat the Raiders during the 1973 regular season. Also, he states that the Raiders were the first Wild Card team to make it to the Super Bowl. Completely untrue ! I am surprised that the editors did not catch these inaccuracies and this makes me wonder about their other DVD releases. How much of the information is accurate on these NFL documentaries? Makes you wonder. The other disappointment is that there was no retrospective on safety Jack Tatum, the hardest hitter in the history of the NFL.",1207612800,4,916,4.73125

2080148,4,B0002DRDIC,"It just was not in this DVD Series.  As a Steeler fan I always had respect for Oakland.  Our success in the early-mid seventies was through tough Raider teams.  However, there are a few things that bugged me about this DVD.  First, some of it is historically incorrect.  Oakland did not beat the Steelers three straight after the 1972 Playoffs.  Actually, they met in the 1973 regular season and the Steelers won 17-9.  Oakland then went on to win the next 2 before losing the 1974 AFC Title game.  Second, in the Steelers DVD series, there is a rare frontal shot of the immaculate reception and it clearly shows the ball hitting Tatum's facemask before Franco Harris caught it.  If NFL films has that shot, they should show it more and put this debate to rest.  I had never seen it before and It should be in the Raiders DVD as well and then there won't be so much crying about it.  It was the correct call.  Three, the DVD glossed over the 1977 Incident when George Atkinson cold-cocked Lynn Swann in the back of the head. Chuck Noll called Atkinson part of the NFL's criminal element.  Bottom line, is that the hit was uncalled for even by Steeler-Raider standards.  Truth is, that Atkinson busted the nose of New England's Russ Francis with a forearm to the face in the 1976 Playoffs, a game that if not for one of the worst calls in NFL history, Oakland would have lost.  Atkinson was a undersized safety who resorted to thuggery as his speed declined and will be rememberd as a cheap shot artist.  He did stuff like that all the time. Finally, why in the world did the producers of this let Phil Villapiano discuss the 1976 Raider Super Bowl team???  What not Cliff Branch, Gene Upshaw, Art Shell, Ken Stabler, or Ted Hendrix?  Phil was a very average linebacker who according to Jack Tatum in his book, "" They call me Assassin "" could not even remember his defensive assignments. The guy comes across as a true blowhard.  Memo to Phil...every running back should be as lazy as Franco Harris as he called Franco in the DVD.  Geez, he was lazy and still got into the Hall of Fame and is on every all-time Super Bowl Team. For whatever reason, the Raiders hated Franco and Lynn Swann, and never stop taking shots at them.  Franco ran them over and Lynn did little damage after the 1974 AFC Championship due to the fact he never finished the games most of the time. Let it go.  It makes you sound cheap, not great like the Raider's were. John Madden should be in the Hall of fame as should Tatum.  However, the dirty reputation has kept Madden out so far and Tatum will never get in.  Other than these points, the DVD was good.  I recommend it for it is the second best of all the Team History DVD's  behind..the Steelers of course. A must have for any Raider fan or a fan of NFL History.",1138320000,6,2791,4.391812865497076
2080149,3,B0002DRDIC,"In the early 70s I hated the Raiders, especially when they beat my favorite teams, the Steelers and Dolphins.  But those were great games and great teams on both sides.

While it's great to see highlights of those days, this video is a bit shallow.  There is just not enough time spent on the great players who made the team so fun to watch (or hate).  I would have liked to see more in depth on the awesome Raiders secondary, and the lethal hits they used to mete out.  Otis Sistrunk wasn't mentioned as far as I could tell, but he was one of the more interesting characters of the team.  It's entertaining, but there isn't a lot of time spent on your favorite players and teams.",1137801600,4,680,4.31496062992126
2080160,2,B0002DRDIC,"I agree that just watching highlights of classic games does the game no justice at all.  You need to see the entire game, the ebb and flow, the momentum changes, the crowd, the blocks, the power run on 3rd and 2 that kept a touchdown driving going, etc. to fully appreciate the game.  I have just about every classic Raiders game in its entirety.  The Ghost to the Post game, the Holy Roller, the Super Bowl wins, classic games against the Dolphins and Steelers.  Email me for more information.",1129334400,6,494,4.51685393258427
2080161,1,B0002DRDIC,"I have been a Raiders fan since 1973 (I was in 6th grade), although I didn't really start following them until the 1975 season.  I just purchased this DVD last month.  I found it to be both thrilling and annoying.  In short - a missed opportunity!

I was thrilled that, for the first time on DVD, we can see highlights of some of the greatest moments in Raider history!  I was annoyed, as I have been by all of the NFL DVD releases, because great football (even games that took place decades before) is NOT just about the highlights.

Imagine, if you will, if all you could buy or rent was the highlights of the James Bond movies.  Sure, we've seen the featurettes that show us clips of the great moments in history by Sean Connery, Roger Moore and company.  But WHAT IF THAT WAS ALL THAT WAS OFFERED ?!!

What if, instead of being able to buy/rent a DVD of ""Goldfinger"" or ""The Spy Who Loved Me"" and watch the entire film, unedited, uninterrupted, in stereo sound, wide-screen (and someday, high-definition!), we had to settle on just a few highlights, (with not even the original audio, but rather the voice-over of some generic commentator), in some made-for-cable compilation ?!

It would be UNACCEPTABLE !

And I feel the same way about this DVD.  These classic games simply loose all of their original excitement and energy in these lifeless compilations.  It is time to bring these games back, in their original splendor.  With the original network commentaries.  JUST AS THEY WERE ORIGINALLY AIRED (minus the commercials, of course).  No present day commentary or highlights (except, perhaps, as separate special features menue items, if there is room on the DVD).  No interruptions.  No editing.  Just as it was originally aired.  Isn't that, after all, the goal when we watch ""Goldfinger"", for example, on our home theatre system?  To recreate the way it felt (or must have felt) when it was first viewed years ago?!

And the way the so-called ""Greatest Game"" was presented on Disc 2 was little better than the highlights of disc 1.  It feels more like I'm watching a high school game that some parent filmed on their home movie camera.  Where is the original network broadcast?!!! And put the current-day commentary WHERE IT BELONGS, on a separate special features menu item (or separate audio track that can be disabled, if one so chooses).  A game looses the momentum and feeling of live action when they cut out the suspense-building intervals in between the plays and interrupt with present-day commentary.  I want to see EVERYTHING!  The huddles.  The side-lines moments.  The penalties.  Just as it was.  UNINTERRUPTED!

In short, come on NFL.  GET WITH IT!  Use some common sense.  When I set down to watch a classic game, I don't want an asinine and tedious history lesson.  I want to re-live that game, all of the original energy and excitement, just as it was when it was originally aired!  If you want to include some featurettes with highlights and commentary, that's fine.  I am as big a fan of special features as the next guy.  However, if your going to include irritating commentary by the opposition players, please include it on a separate menu item from the Raiders' commentaries, so I can ignore it, if I so choose.  (By the way, one special feature that would be welcome would be an interactive menu of team and player statistics for the games on the DVD.)

Let me finish by giving my plug for the games that I believe should be FIRST in a new DVD series of COMPLETE GAMES.

I vote for box sets with COMPLETE, UNEDITED, games from the team that put the Raiders on the road to its first World Championship - the Madden and Stabler team of the 70's.  Personally, I would like to see a box set including any and all Raider playoff and championship games of 1972 thru 1975 (including the ones that they lost).  Then a box set of the best games of the 1976 season (arguably the best Raiders season ever), (or better yet, 2 or 3 box sets of ALL of the games of the 1976 season), including, of course the classic September 12, 1976 game* against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers, and the playoff and championship games that led to Oakland's Super Bowl IX appearance.  (The actual Raiders Super Bowl victory over the Vikings would be included in one of a new series of COMPLETE Super Bowl games box sets).

* I consider this to be the greatest Raider comeback (and one of the greatest GAMES) of all-time, where Stabler led the raiders to a 31 to 28 come from behind victory, including 17 unanswered points in the last 2:38 of the game.  This game is great not just because of the dramatic come-from-behind victory, but because it was the first victory over the Steelers since the Steelers began their Super Bowl dynasty of the 70's, defeating the Steeler team that had kept the Raiders from going to the Super Bowl two years in a row.  And it was the game that started the 1976 Raiders team on their way to their best record ever (16-1-0) and their first Super Bowl Championship ever!

2080165,5,B0002DRDIC,"""and upside down, and laugh till they've conquered and won..."" John Facenda's line epitomizes the Oakland Raider DVD collection. Recalling many famous moments in team history, I was most intrigued by their exhibitions of resilency, as they lost so many AFL/AFC Championships before actually winning one in 1976 (Steelers were shorthanded in that game, but it wouldn't have mattered.). My only comlaint is that I wish the second DVD was the 1974 Divisional playoff game versus the Miami Dolphins, the general public opinion of their greatest game. Still, it was fun reviewing all the raider greats from Art Powell to Tim Brown. AL DAVIS is an incredible man!!!

A must view!!!",1110240000,7,675,5.081081081081081
2080166,5,B0002DRDIC,"There are 2 discs: The first disc features the complete history of the Oakland Raiders, from 1960 through the Raider glory days and the years when they were excilled in LA, until the present with a spot on the Raidah nation!

There are also brief segments on both discs detailing: John Madden, Lanzio, the hated imaculate Reception against the Steelers, the Holy Roller vs. SD, the Heidi game against New York, the Raiderettes (a 16 minute program from a TV show back when the Raiders played in LA), Freddy Bilitnikoff, etc.

The Secound disc was my favorite. It has about 50+ minutes of almost the entire game of ""Ghost to the Post""  1977 AFC Playoff battle between our Raiders and the then Baltimore Colts. You see all the old footage from the game, the TV announcers calling it, players from the game recolecting their experiences, and the NFL films narrator. I've seen this game on the DVD 2 times in the last 24 hours it's this good. The game is brilliantly explained as the last great day for Baltimore Colt fans and how they had a swift decline in the short years after before moving to Indy.

The secound disc has two AL Davis retrospectives on equality and his reclaimation projects.",1103587200,14,1192,4.6350710900473935

As a 30+ year fan, it brought back many memories for me and to have it on DVD and not wait for it on ESPN Classics or NFL Network is a real treat.

8026813,5,B0002DRDIC,"My first Raiders game was a 1995 weekday preseason game in Oakland. The Raider Nation was hyped as they welcomed all to join in their teams' glorious return to Oaktown. I tailgated with some hardcore fans who pumped me with ice cold beers and Raiders football lore. Then I entered the stadium, a rumbling, tumbling Raider, ready to do battle. As soon as the Raiders Autumn Wind theme song began blasting through the stadium I knew I was home. I was born again!

This Raiders DVD package begins with Raiders highlights to the tune of the Autumn Wind. From there its all gravy as you're whirled around and upside down, laughing along to the many joyous moments that make up that legendary Raiders mystique. But don't get me wrong, with all that glory comes the pain and heartbreak us Raiders fans know all too well. It's actually what makes Raider Nation one of the most passionate fan bases in all of sports. And I wouldn't trade wearing the Silver and Black for all the tea in China.",1516752000,,983,4.553672316384181
