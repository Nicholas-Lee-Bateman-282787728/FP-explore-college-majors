664810,5,6303455204,"When taking time to taste the wonders and woes of a nice campground experience, nothing is worse than those run-ins with Mosquitos. While trying to have fun, those little monsters assail you and yours, taking little sips whenever they feel like it simply because they're trying to do what they can to stay alive. Blah. When put on tap a few dozen times, itching and wondering why you took a trip to the middle of nowhere, you find yourself wondering how things could get any worse. To answer, imagine a night spent watching the sky and seeing falling stars. Now try having one of those lovely comets turn out to be that UFO experience you've always wondered about, the driver of that vehicle get killed when that UFO turns out to be out-of-control, and then some mosquitos find the body and feed. Yeah, things get really big and really ugly from there.
When dealing with this film, one shouldn't make a mistake and think that they're dealing with something that isn't going to be cheesy. Big Bug movies always turn out that way, always having some strange sideplot to go along with the main flow of monstrosity, and the doom they offer is always campy. So, instead of going in expecting anything, you should think of your atypical bad acting, death, some gore effects to take the place of a plot, and a nice laughtrack to make the day go along better. And, if that sounds good, then Mosquito would be a tale for you.
Personally, the ""who is going to live, who is going to die"" tales always make me happy and I've always loved Mosquito. Within its brand of sordid humor, nobody is truly safe from the touch and the feel of the threat, with most of the people met along the way succumbing to the alluring beasts and their thirst. Its comedy, only nobody gets to stand up in the end and tell jokes (unless you count Gunnar Hansen - The original Leatherface). And that's what I like about it, truth be told. Every movie and social stereotype mastered by the mosquito.",1068854400,5,1963,4.532394366197183
664811,4,6303455204,"Sooner or later somebody with a camera was bound to notice that in the genre of giant insect movies there was only one bad B-movie about giant mosquitoes, the awful 1993 ""Skeeter.""  Consequently, this shortcoming was rectified by this 1995 campy low-budget film from director Gary Jones (director of the 2000 film ""Spiders"").  ""Mosquito"" begins with what, in the best light, would be an homage to ""The Blob"" and ""War of the Worlds"" (or both).  An alien spacecraft crashes into a swamp (located in Detroit, Michigan apparently, since that is where they made the film), the hatch opens, an alien arm slithers out and then the pilot dies.  Then mosquitoes show up to start sucking on that alien blood and the next thing you know we have got giant skeeters on the attack (the sort where actors have to hold on to giant bugs and to the dance of death).  The result, at least from my warped perspective, is a film that is so bad its unintentional humor makes it fun to watch (a refrigerator can save YOUR life), which is why the rating hear reflects enjoyment, not quality, boys and girls.
The mosquitoes try to feast on the normal collection of doomed souls who are a bit slow to figure out that these are monster mosquitoes and not funny looking birds and you will not care a whit who survives and who does not.  Gunnar Hansen (who also gets a script credit) is Earl the Bank robber, Ron Asheton is Hendricks the Park Ranger, Rachel Loiselle is Megan the new Park Ranger, Tim Lovelace is her boyfriend Ray, and Steve Dixon is Parks, who chases meteors for the U.S. Air Force.  However, this film is redeemed by one great moment where the character played by Gunnar Hansen, the original Leatherface in Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and declares ""I haven't handled one of these things in 20 years....feels good.""  Of course, it had been two decades since the release of that classic horror flick.  I do not know how ""MST3K"" missed this one, or how I missed that they did not miss it.  But if you like to ridicule bad movies in the privacy of your own home, ""Mosquito"" is a great choice.  Why, one liners should be popping into your head as you read this and you have not even seen the film yet...",1056672000,,2204,4.526448362720403
664812,4,6303455204,"This movie was the best cheesy movie I have ever seen.  It has bad special effects,  I mean there was no acting and the dialogue was repetitive.  Such as that girl who kept saying I want to bring it back to the lab to examine it.  The funniest part was when the mosquito got a guy going to the bathroom.  It was hilarious and the part where the mosquito got stuck on the door and the kept hitting it and it looked like a pile of jam.  I recommend this movie as a cheesy movie and a good laugh.",1027728000,2,493,3.9292929292929295

You're in for a treat when you realize that the action is funnier than the comic relief.  The scientists and much of the plot is lifted right from ""Food of the Gods;"" the climax is reminiscent of ""Night of the Living Dead"" or ""The Birds;"" and the dialogue is delivered with all the emotion of the funeral attendees from ""Plan Nine From Outer Space.""

664814,5,6303455204,"This movie is not to be confused with Skeeter. Skeeter I have only seen bits and pieces of, but I guarantee that it has nothing on this fine piece of cinema. Mosquito made me wonder who the person was that felt sorry enough to give these fools the change out of his/her back pocket to make this high budget film. I tell you, I about peed in my pants over this one. First of all the special affect were about the worst I have seen.....ever, not counting Simbad stop motion. I suspect that they had a total of two mosquito props being that you only ever saw two rubber mosquitoes on at any one time. In addition, there is a car chase scene where the mosquitoes looked like they were draw on the film with crayon. Granted the special effect were better than Matchmaker, their not giving high fives behind the scenes.  Second, the plot (as if I need to bring up that word) was absent minded to say the least. I don't think you want the suprise factor in this movie so I'm going to spoil it for you. The beginning starts off with a wrecked space ship accompanied by an alien dangling his arm out of the space craft. The mosquitoes drink his blood and mutate. Interested yet? So you have a recreation camping ground in distress, lots of people die, and they run. With me so far? They come up with the idea that there is s breeding ground somewhere. ""Ding"" or so you think. But no, the movie winds up them cornered in the house with a bunch of eggs and they burn it down. What the hell happened to the alien ship. You upset I spoiled it for you now? Well, my apologies. Last, the acting and dialog is beyond supreme. I've got some spare change, I could easily fund a better group of actors than those master thespians. It seemed like many of the actors were doing their impression of a dear in headlights. The thing that made me laugh most was the dialog. They would say things like ""Take a nap pal."" followed by a knock out punch, and ""This isn't science fiction. This is science fact."" You can't beat that folks. Not even the Hercules series has those hip hop lyrics.  So are you sold yet? This is my absolute no. 1 recommendation. I'm sure after you see this you'll be banging on the almighty afro's doorstep cryin for more. Afro out.",971568000,4,2230,4.307142857142857

665114,4,6303455204,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

There is a part of a movie lover that reads the words 20th anniversary edition attached to a movie like MOSQUITO that says Really? We needed an anniversary edition for a movie like this? What is most surprising is when you watch and then realize that yes indeed, we did need this version. Its not that the movie is wonderful (it isnt) or that it contains some outstanding performances (it doesnt) but what it does do is show you how fun a movie can be even when the bad parts are there on screen to be witnessed. The folks behind this movie love horror films, especially big critter movies, and that shows in every frame.

The story involves an alien spaceship dumping radioactive waste into a swamp. One of the canisters splits releasing some slimy green material that a mosquito chooses to drink up. Bingo bango bongo we now have mutated giant mosquitos to deal with.  But we cant just run with that, there has to be more going on.

Were introduced to several characters who work in a national forest during the camping season going on. Most important of these is Park Ranger Hendricks. Why? Because he is played by Ron Asheton, one of the founding members of the proto-punk band The Stooges who were fronted by Iggy Pop. Asheton was a die-hard B-movie fan who had his dream come true in being a part of this film. Alongside his character is a new Ranger named Megan (Rachel Loiselle) and her boyfriend Ray (Tim Lovelace) who arrive soon after the first mosquito attack takes place. With dead campers everywhere to be seen they check out the Ranger station to find Hendricks the only survivor.

Heading out to find help the trio come across Parks (Steve Dixon) a USAF meteor chaser whos been tracking the falling debris. With his Geiger counter in tow they track down the mosquitos but are nearly eaten alive, making them realize the best bet is to high tail it out of the area for help. On their way they are stopped by a wrecked car. Its a set up and they're nearly taken hostage by a trio of bank robbers who are headed back to the park area to recover some of their loot. Of not here is that the leader of the group is none other than Gunnar Hansen, famous as the original Leatherface in the first TEXAS CHAINSAW MASSACRE.

As the group tries to outrun the mosquito swarm they are attacked time and time again resulting in the motor home they were escaping in being turned over. As they continue to run they're picked off one at a time until the number of survivors drops. A final battle ends the filmor does it? One can never tell in a giant critter movie.

Yes, this movie is bad on a number of levels but when you think back to the fact that 20 years ago CGI was nearly non-existent they come up with some decent effects. What stands out are the practical effects on screen here, the giant bugs that the cast tangles with. When shot these things become goo dripping messes that aren't likely to scare most adults but could creep out many a youngster. But if they watch keep in mind there is a nude scene so keep that hand ready to cover young eyes.

The acting isn't the worst ever committed to film but it does leave a lot to be desired. But thats the joy of a movie thats so bad its good. No one promises Shakespeare and the cast delivers on that non-existent promise. Its all in fun and done well enough to actually be an enjoyable movie. Those with projection TVs they can use outdoor will want to show this come summer outside on a big sheet.

Synapse has done a great job here when it comes to extras. If youve read my reviews you know Im not a fan of extras for the most part. But here again, as with items made by both Twilight Time and Arrow Video, we have a movie that is enhanced by the extras. They don't seem to be made simply to stroke the egos of actors involved or to promote a movie we already purchased. Instead they take us back to what happened then as it was being filmed and to show us how those involved are doing now. Included in the extras here are:
-Audio Commentary
-Bugging Out!  The Making of MOSQUITO
-Deleted and extended footage
-Behind the scenes footage
-A still gallery
-The theatrical trailer

As I said, its not the best movie ever made but its not the worst either. Its a fun time. Fans will enjoy, most will wonder why the rest of us enjoy it. Thats there loss.",1445904000,,4365,4.363300492610837

A snazzy spaceship crashes into a lake.  A mosquito samples the blood from a dead alien and presto, BIG mosquitoes on a rampage in a National Park.

Into this mess stroll a couple (Rachel Loiselle & Tim Lovelace), and a scientist (Steve Dixon), nice enough to give them a lift after a mosquito disables their car.  They soon discover a disgruntled park ranger hiding under an overturned row boat (Ron Asheton).  They also find a body merrily down a stream.  And then they panic and run into three idiot crooks trying to evade the police and the giant mosquitoes.  What fun!

Gunner Hansen is absolutely abysmal in this, but in such a good way!!!!

This masterpiece is know simply as Mosquito and is essential to any true b lover's horror collection. Naturally this is yet another example of why the 90's was our favorite time period for b of all genres. It just seems this era in our lives had everything going perfect especially when it came to the horribly hilarious movies. The typical young Sid weekend was filled with good buddies, good food, and great B like our feature of the week Mosquito.

In case you couldn't sum up what this one would be about we have taken the liberty to inform you of it's superior plot. In an area dense with hillbillies an alien craft crashes in the middle of the woods. After the crash some of the local mosquitos feed on the dead aliens turning them into giant man-eating creatures. From here we're introduced to an exceptionally bad cast that will keep you captivated for the next 90 minutes with ease. You'll meet Hendricks the park ranger, Parks the black Meteor chaser, Earl the bank robber-portly yes..but smart as a whip, Ray the main character, and Megan his way below sub-par girlfriend as they embark on a survival mission against the over sized mosquitos. We don't want to give any further details away because this one MUST be viewed by anyone who loves the art of unintentional comedies.

By this portion of the review you can obviously tell we give this one the full and absolute seal of approval promising the best viewing outcome. Our only gripe is that we waiting this long to revisit this classic. We've seen it at least 3 times prior to this viewing and always let it stay in our back pocket until now. There was really no better way to close out our weekly Thursday B shenanigans. It had everything we needed bringing lots of laughs, memories, and plenty of sentimental value. Despite a decline in the weekly b department, we've made it a future mission to view Legion of the Night which was released a year past Mosquito starring Ray and Park who both play bums.

665234,3,6303455204,"Drenched in blood, guts, and giant bugs, Gary Jones's Mosquito is so close to being a great horror movie that it's truly depressing the film didn't take itself more seriously and the actors didn't take more lessons. The film opts for a high level of camp, but never drifts far enough into the clever comedy realm of Arachnophobia or Tremors to attain a more prestigious cult classic status.

When regular mosquitos begin drinking the blood of dead aliens from a downed spaceship they grow to gargantuan proportions and all hell breaks loose for the vacationers relaxing in the nearby campgrounds. Ray (Tim Lovelace) and his Park Ranger girlfriend Megan (Rachel Loiselle) band together with meteorologist Parks (Steve Dixon) and the nerdy Ranger Hendricks (Ron Asheton) to fend off both the mutated bugs and cantankerous criminals Junior (Mike Hard) and Earl (Gunnar Hansen in fine goofy form mocking his own Texas Chainsaw Massacre performance).

Mosquito wastes no time setting up an elaborate explanation for why giant mosquitos roam the grounds (although the reason chosen is likely better than the typical government chemical testing) and gets right into the action and carnage. Borrowing a few cues from Aliens and other imitable horror staples, Mosquito showcases enough impressive action sequences that it's a shame the movie didn't try a little harder to be serious. The threat of the monstrous mutant skeeters, coupled with their bloodthirsty method of feeding creates a tense mood by itself, but much of the hokey dialogue quickly substitutes suspense for eye-rolling laughs. The potential for amazing is there, but the direction the creators insist upon keeps Mosquito squarely in the territory of cheese.

Director Gary Jones got his start in makeup and special effects - and it shows. Impressively grotesque practical effects comprise the majority of the monster mosquitos and they look as real as ten-foot insects can. The gore has a classic early 90's feel and scenes of razor sharp proboscises to the chest and eyes provide some cringe-worthy moments. With such a fast introduction to the mayhem only a few bystander deaths are shown, but Jones makes good use of them, most notably in a tent ambush sequence that ably displays the film's overall tone. As his wife is being assaulted by a killer insect, a doltish camper continues to take swigs from his beer as he runs to her aid.

With such effort on practical mosquito effects throughout, it's disappointing to see poorly done green screen and a spattering of subpar stop-motion mixed in, but such shortcomings can be forgiven once the bloodsucking bugs return to their brand of fluid-draining in all their puppetry glory. The less-than-admirable acting (and the difficulty in obtaining a DVD of the film) will likely keep this forgotten killer insect classic from the casual horror enthusiast, but few of its genre came so close to cheesy perfection as Mosquito.

665235,5,6303455204,"Wow, what can I say?  This has been my favorite movie since it came out back in '95.  Before it was released I had a copy because I was doing dialogue transcription and I got to watch it over and over and over, to my delight.  Speaking of dialogue, the first time I saw this movie, I could guess what they were going to say before they said it, just think of the cheesiest dialogue for any movie, and there you have it!  I have to admit, the ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" reference was always one of my favorites.  The giant 6 foot mosquitos have always held a special place in my heart and I can't believe how much the DVD's are going for these days.  I have a VHS and DVD version of this movie and whip it out whenver I get a chance.  This movie is a lot of fun and I highly recommend it to anyone.  Don't expect high dollar special effects though.  I wish I had a giant mosquito to hang in my home as a decoration.

I give this movie 5 stars for the entertainment factor alone.  No other movie makes me laugh as much as this one does, there's action, green gooey mosquito blood, eye popping special effects (hee, hee), goofy dialogue and of course dialogue's nothing without the acting.

Mosquito changed my life for the better.  When I first saw Mosquito I was in a pretty dark period in my life.  But what the (deep, remarkable) characters on the screen were going through made my problems look like a day at the fair!

Imagine Mosquitos flipping your mobile home over.  Or having to crawl into a filthy sewage pipe for precious seconds of survival.

665237,5,6303455204,"What is your personal criteria for determining what constitutes a ""good"" horror movie? Is it one that has a big budget? Sensational special effects? A cast made up of big name Hollywood stars or a really well-written, intelligent script that's brilliantly acted and meticuously directed? Yeah, all of that would be nice, but I live in the real world and ultimately all I really ask from any movie is that I enjoy it. Now there are many people who would label movies that lacked those sterling qualities but which they still found enjoyable as ""guilty pleasures."" Not me, no guilt here. If I enjoyed them, I enjoyed them and all that that entails. So here it goes. I will stand up straight and tall and look everyone right in the general direction of their eyes and declare firmly: I really like MOSQUITO, and, yes, I think its a good movie! There. Its out in the open.

 Its acting, script, direction, etc. are all adequate for a movie of this type, but even if they weren't--so what? It still meets MY basic criteria. I enjoyed it! MOSQUITO is a genial and likeable film that succeeds as no big bug film has before or since because its just good natured fun with some nice special effects thrown in on the side. Filmed in the mid 1990's deep in the heart of Michigan (probably for inspiration of the insectoid variety) this little flick is helped along by a cast the includes Gunnar Hansen and Ron Asheton,who I'm told is famous as a proto-punk musician with The Stooges although I know him from his role in  FROSTBITER, LEGEND OF WENDIGO, an indie that was released by Troma. For being a low budget production it opens with an effective display of special effects as an orbiting spaceship dispatches a smaller vehicle towards planet earth. This smaller craft crashes and an alien with a physiognomy reminiscent of those in Gene Barry's WAR OF THE WORLDS emerges from the ship only to die before we can see more than an appendage. Unfortunately a mosquito also spots the alien arm and zooms in for an exotic snack. Thus our movie begins.

Our victims du jour include Meg and her boyfriend Ray who are on their way to the State Park where Meg will start her new summer job as a ranger, Parks who was sent by the army to investigate what they believe to be a meteor crash the night before (in actuality, the alien ship), Hendricks the bumbling comic relief ranger (played by Ron Asheton), and a gang of bank robbers who are quickly whittled down to just one, Earl, played by Gunnar Hansen. In true horror film tradition all these characters squabble amongst themselves and try good naturedly to kill each other before FINALLY joining forces against the real threat--those lousy skeeters! Before the film ends our heroes pull a Romero in an old farm house, Gunnar Hanson has a touching reunion with a chainsaw,and we learn that a refrigerator can be your friend.

This is one of those films where even the evil-doers aren't all that bad, and half the fun is trying to guess who, if anyone is going to make it out alive. If you're one of those people who watches horror films, especially comedies, expecting them to make sense then you have my sympathies for you are missing out on all the fun in life. I've done my share of griping--see my review of I AM LEGEND, but that was a completely different kind of film made for a completely different purpose and should thus be held to a different standard than a film such as this. This is just plain fun.

Oh, don't let the dvd price put you off. If you have access to a VHS you can still get a tape for under $5.

There's also some cute stop motion bugs in addition to full size puppets.

I found this horror movie enjoyable and hillarious at times and a good movie to watch with my friends and family.  Especially during Halloween parties.  We decorated our home with the theme of this movie {tents, camping equipment and mosquitoes of course} and had a fanastic time.  Hands down, this movie should be in the hall of fame for great movies!  I am disappointed about the price of this movie, however, I have not been able to find it for sale, but $74.00 on Amazon is way too much for the movie itself.  When you are ready to wipe the dust off, and come down on your price, I imagine you would not be able to keep this movie in stock.  :)",1152403200,,725,4.2101449275362315
665288,5,6303455204,"This was a movie I used to watch every time I saw it on T.V. when I was a kid, of about 12 or 13. I enjoyed it, as it was probably the first horror movie I watched that was COMPLETELY UNFRIGHTENING TO ME. I was a notorious wuss when it came to horror films, and that's what my friends were into. So, I was always having nightmares. However, this was a movie I could watch that wasn't scary at all! And still look cool to my friends. This sloppily put together, cheap looking movie also helped fuel my love affair for awful horror movies. So for that, it has immense sentimental value. For that alone, it gets 5 stars.

But I must balance this rating with the fact that this isn't a good movie. It's awful! It's not really very watchable, for the most part. I'm watching it on T.V. as I write this, and it gives me a warm feeling inside, but I'm not exactly ""loving"" it. My girlfriend is doing homework rather than watch it! On a realistic scale, the movie gets 2 stars.

However, for two truly bizarre people staring in it, it gains an extra star. Though it might not mean a lot to people to some people, the fat, whiny park Ranger Parks (groan) is actually the GUITARIST FOR INFAMOUS PROTO PUNK BAND THE STOOGES!!!!! This might not mean a lot of people, but it's a truly mind bogglingly strange thing for me to deal with, ten years after the fact. This man could make the claim, quite legitimately, that he created punk rock. And here he is, running away from mosquito's and mincing his way through a role he has no right staring in; he even WROTE A SONG FOR THE SOUNDTRACK. For rock fans, this gives the movie an extra star.

However, for horror movie fans, an even odder casting was the choice of Gunner Hansen as the big fat redneck. Though this name won't ring bells to many people, this is the man who was Leatherface in Texas Chainsaw Massacre! Here is a man who could lay claim, quite legitmately, to starting the ""slasher"" horror film fad. Seeing him here is surreal; I keep expecting him to grunt and stick his toungue out. At the end, he even wields a chainsaw, saying ""I haven't used one of these in 20 years."" Heh, heh. This is worth an extra star for horror film fans.

So, for most people this movie is a two star deal. For rock or horror, it's three stars affair. For rock AND horror fans it's four stars. But for ME seeing as it has the ""sentimental"" value, it gets five stars. I will buy this on DVD as soon as I can find it.",1131753600,,2443,4.236051502145923

665292,4,6303455204,"In the genre of giant insect movies when it comes to bad B-movies abut giant mosquitoes your choice is between the awful 1993 flick ""Skeeter,"" and this 1995 campy low-budget film from director Gary Jones (director of the 2000 film ""Spiders""). ""Mosquito"" begins with what, in the best light, would be an homage to ""The Blob"" and ""War of the Worlds"" (or both). An alien spacecraft crashes into a swamp (located in Detroit, Michigan apparently, since that is where they made the film), the hatch opens, an alien arm slithers out and then the pilot dies. Then mosquitoes show up to start sucking on that alien blood and the next thing you know we have got giant skeeters on the attack (the sort where actors have to hold on to giant bugs and to the dance of death). The result, at least from my warped perspective, is a film that is so bad its unintentional humor makes it fun to watch (a refrigerator can save YOUR life), which is why the rating hear reflects enjoyment, not quality, boys and girls.

The mosquitoes try to feast on the normal collection of doomed souls who are a bit slow to figure out that these are monster mosquitoes and not funny looking birds and you will not care a whit who survives and who does not. Gunnar Hansen (who also gets a script credit) is Earl the Bank robber, Ron Asheton is Hendricks the Park Ranger, Rachel Loiselle is Megan the cute new Park Ranger, Tim Lovelace is her boyfriend Ray, and Steve Dixon is Parks, who chases meteors for the U.S. Air Force and is the brains of this outfit (almost by default). However, this film is redeemed by one great moment where the character played by Gunnar Hansen, the original Leatherface in Tobe Hooper's ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and declares ""I haven't handled one of these things in 20 years....feels good."" Of course, it had been two decades since the release of that classic horror flick. I do not know how ""MST3K"" missed this one, or how I missed that they did not miss it. But if you like to ridicule bad movies in the privacy of your own home, ""Mosquito"" is a great choice.

665293,4,6303455204,"I just watched an amusing little horror movie called Mosquito involving giant mosquitos descending on a state park.
The movie opens with a large space craft approaching Earth and releasing a small shuttle.  For some reason the shuttle crashes in the vicinity of a state park.  Then there is a very creative scene first showing the emergence of a mosquito in adult form and then its view as it flies towards the downed craft.  A hatch is open.  There is a pulsing red light inside.  A long, thin, three-fingered arm stretches out of the opening.  The mosquito feeds and the rest can be imagined.
The opening special effects and some of the mosquito effects are quite good.  However in the first scene, which involves several of the leads having a giant mosquito smash on their windshield, the young female park ranger (possibly the smartest and most self sufficient person in the movie) declares the road kill an insect because of what she calls the proboscis (pro-bah-suhs).  Her constant rendition of the word told me that while they did a little research for the movie, they did much too little.  Other than this blatant overuse of a single ""fact"" by the ""expert"" I really enjoyed the movie, especially the George Pal tribute in the beginning.
If you are a fan of giant bug movies, you might be interested in this one.  Just don't get it mixed up with a really bad one called Skeeter.",1084838400,,1386,4.666666666666667

I didn't know until reading reviews that Gunnar Hansen was the original Leatherface, but his line concerning the chainsaw is certainly funnier knowing that!

665295,4,6303455204,"""Mosquito"" is the type of film that not only hits you over the head with its sheer badness; it continues to beat you after you have lost consciousness. The whole thing is an atrocity, a roaring, shrieking train wreck of a film that even the hardiest souls will have a tough time taking seriously. Everything fails on a metatectonic level with this movie: the acting, the plot, the pacing, most of the special effects, and everything else you have come to associate with a motion picture. ""Mosquito"" is such a miserable movie that you will draw flies if you don't quit gaping at the disaster unfolding onscreen. Have I made myself clear about the total ineptness of this movie yet? Good, because I now need to say watching ""Mosquito"" is a lot of fun for the lover of trash cinema. Why? Because the whole thing is an atrocity, a roaring, shrieking train wreck of a film that even the hardiest souls will have a tough time taking seriously. Because everything fails on a metatectonic level with this movie: the acting, the plot, the pacing, most of the special effects, and everything else you have come to associate with a motion picture. Because ""Mosquito"" is such a miserable movie that you will draw flies if you don't quit gaping at the disaster unfolding onscreen. And Gunnar Hansen plays one of the primary characters.
""Mosquito"" begins with the crash landing of an extraterrestrial object from space. The craft splashes down in a swamp with disastrous results for the surrounding ecosystem. Well, at least it is for the mosquitoes since it seems only these nasty little buggers suffer any ill effects from the spaceship. The skeeters soon grow to frighteningly huge proportions although no one in the area knows about this impending disaster as of yet. We soon meet four disparate groups of people that we just know will wind up together in the end. There are two young folks--a man and his girlfriend--driving out to a local recreation area so the girl can assume her post as a park ranger. There is an idiotic, whiny male ranger at the park who may rank as one of the worst actors in cinematic history. How do we know he is an idiot? Because he sprays the park for mosquitoes without worrying about poisoning the campers. Somewhere down the road three militia guys with a bag full of money and a bad attitude have a nasty encounter with a giant mosquito in the forest. After suffering a casualty, the two survivors attempt to get out of the area at all costs. Finally, some guy checking out a report of a falling meteor in the area provides the scientific information we need to understand how giant mosquitoes could possibly exist--not really, of course, but he's there to do what he can.
The ravenous mosquitoes make quick work of any people they find out in the open with the exception of our gang of heroes, who soon come together to fight for their lives. They attempt to flee from the malevolent skeeters in an RV, attempt to run from them through a sewer drain, and attempt to escape by barricading themselves in an abandoned house. Predictably, the mosquitoes manage to thin the herd along the way, with a few of our stalwart souls collapsing under the onslaught of the winged hordes as the various methods adopted to deal with the rascals fail miserably. Victims of the mosquitoes tend to shrivel up at an alarming rate, probably due to the rather rapid blood loss accompanying a bite. The idea of falling prey to the mosquitoes is so bad that it requires Gunnar Hansen's character to ally himself with people he doesn't really trust, and to later heft a chainsaw in a futile attempt to rescue one of his imperiled companions. Strange events make for strange bedfellows, apparently. It is almost redundant to say that the conclusion involves a final confrontation with the mutated mosquitoes, one that requires personal sacrifice if our heroes are to save the world.
The flaws of ""Mosquito"" are as numerous as, say, a swarm of mosquitoes. All of the actors hired for the production uniformly tank in their respective roles, but John Reneaud as the thickheaded ranger Tony is arguably the worst actor in the world. He spends every scene complaining and whining about the situation, so much so that I fervently prayed he would fall victim to the mosquitoes in an especially gruesome fashion. Reneaud is the worst actor in a cast of painfully wooden thespians. Gunnar Hansen, for example, looks awfully stiff in his role as Earl, one of the militia guys with a secret. Put these terrible performances next to the cheesy effects, the gory attack sequences, the ham handed script, and you have a movie sure to alienate most of the viewing audience. ""Mosquito"" did not alienate me; I liked the movie overall and laughed repeatedly at the antics unfolding onscreen. This one has ""so bad it is good"" written all over it.
I wouldn't be surprised at all if the movie attained cult classic status. I do know it appears on basic cable from time to time, so apparently there is an audience out there for this type of garbage. The biggest questions I had as the final credits rolled concerned the alien spacecraft. Whatever happened to the ship? Moreover, why would the Air Force send out one guy with experience about meteorites to investigate what is probably the biggest event in the history of the human race? Doesn't the U.S.A.F. have fancy radar and satellite systems designed to detect foreign objects from space? As I wondered about these questions, I realized I was wasting my time.

So, you, the reader, are probably scratching your heads wondering why I would be so dedicated to this film.  Well, I guess it all goes back to when I was working for the DNR here in Michigan, and after reading a blurb about the local, low-budget film ""Blood Fever"" being shot in a neighboring campground, I just had to request a couple days off to be an extra.
How can you not be excited about being an extra in a low-budget horror film which features six-foot tall mosquitos, ESPECIALLY when you happen to have to deal with their miniature cousins every year because you live in a swampy area?  So, I showed up at 7 a.m. for the first day and had a great experience watching Director Gary Jones work his magic on the set, which seemed like it was my own backyard, seen as it was only a five-minute drive from where I lived.  I couldn't help but be entranced by a model of the 'bloodsucker' which hung from a pole setting in front of one of the camps cabins.  Everyone crowded around it, snapping shots, and wondering to themselves if it happened to be the little bugger who snuck a snack from their back leg while enjoying a picnic the night before.
The cast was fun to hang out with, even though I didn't have a chance to meet Gunnar Hansen until he showed up for an autograph session for the film when it hit video stores, (which was even more special to me, since I helped set up the session and I actually got to sign my own autographs, while sitting several chairs down from the reputable actor who exuded a kindness one would actually want to question if he were the same man who wielded the buzzing chainsaw which cut through teens years before).  Ron Asheton, Rachelle Loiselle and Tim Lovelace were all present, though, and they had no problem sharing smiles and hotdogs during the lunch break.
So, sure, the movie may have it's cheesiness.  It may be a far cry from the horror film one would expect a guy like Gunnar Hansen to pop up in, but, all in all, it was a great experience and is always an enjoyable film to watch when it's on t.v. or I just want to reminisce and pull out my own copy.
So, they say you'll always remember your first love and cherish it.  I guess I can say the same for this film.  I'll always remember the fun I had and the friends I met.  It's been over ten years since it actually lensed, and I've done over a dozen other films which have their own special place in my heart.  But, ""Mosquito"" was my first, and was the introduction to my present career as a film-maker here in Michigan.",1074038400,2,2843,4.303370786516854
