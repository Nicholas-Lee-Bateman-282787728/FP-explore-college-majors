6481679,5,B00LEW3L7M,"The Yearling is a great story. Kids are not taught as much about the wild as they were in the past. Much less, the lesson that while something might be what we desire it is not always what is best for us or those involved.",1436572800,,222,3.9555555555555557

6481722,5,B00LEW3L7M,"With ""Lassie, Come Home"". and ""Big Red"" you can add
""The Yearling"" to the list of the best family movies ever
to come out of Hollywood.  Gregory Peck, Jane Wyman
and honorary Oscar recipient Claude Jarman, Jr.are at
their finest,
The climax will move you- guaranteed.",1505088000,,267,4.804347826086956
6481723,5,B00LEW3L7M,Always liked this movie. What else can I say.,1503792000,,45,4.111111111111111
6481724,5,B00LEW3L7M,"I had never seen the movie so after reading the book again, I decided it was time to see the movie, finally.
Of course, not everything in the book is in the movie, but very close and the emotional themes so intensely dealt with in the novel are also in the movie. Well done!",1503619200,,274,4.092592592592593
6481725,4,B00LEW3L7M,"I first saw this movie when I was little.  It's funny in some points, and sad in others.  Still, I like the book a lot better.  The cast is good.  Claude Jarman, Jr., was a fine choice to play young Jody Baxter, and he looks pretty much the way Jody is described in the book.  Jane Wyman also did a creditable job as Ora Baxter, Jody's mother, but she was a bit too petite (in the book, Ora was a rather buxom woman).  Gregory Peck was undoubtedly a fine actor, but he was all wrong for the part of Jody's father, Ezra ""Penny"" Baxter.  The book explains that he was nicknamed ""Penny"" because of his diminutive size.  Peck was 6'3"", so he didn't exactly look the part.

The movie's plot is generally faithful to the book, but it doesn't bring out the book's theme all that well.  The book was about more than a boy and his pet fawn.  It was about the harsh realities of life on the frontier.  Young Jody is gradually introduced to some of the harsher aspects of life, such as death, crop failure, storms, and disease.  These harsh realities eventually threaten Jody's relationship with his pet fawn (you'll have to see the movie or read the book to find out).  In fact, the title has kind of a double meaning.  A yearling is an animal that is between the stages of infancy and adulthood, so the title describes Jody as well as his pet.

These elements aside, ""The Yearling"" is a good family movie, and I highly recommend it.  However, I also recommend you read the book, too, and I think you'll like it even better.  Even so, I must say the movie added one scene at the end that I thought was an improvement.  The book and the movie both depict Ora Baxter as an emotionally cold woman.  She has already buried several children, so she is either unable or unwilling to show Jody affection.  In the last scene of the movie, Jody learns that his mother does indeed love him.  That's all I'm going to tell you.  You'll have to watch the movie to find out!",1498780800,,1950,4.311294765840221
6481726,4,B00LEW3L7M,good DVD however it does not  have the part where Fodderwing  wearing a cape jumps out of a tree tiring to fly and ends up being crippled.,1497052800,,138,4.074074074074074
6481727,5,B00LEW3L7M,"I had this movie on VHS tape, & was very pleased to find it on DVD.  This movie is a family classic, that is in part educational, as it shows how young children had chores, loving family, and in a time when children had fun exploring the great out doors.  It's a movie that will also teach young ones the hardships that made this country so great.",1495929600,4,347,4.164179104477612

6481730,5,B00LEW3L7M,"I love this movie.  Had to watch in high school.  Later, TCM had it on every once in a while.  Gregory Peck and Jane Wyman are great in this movie.  They had already lost 3 or 4 babies before, so their only child was everything to them.  He has a fawn for a pet, which the mother did not want, but the father said he could keep it.  The fawn and boy grow up together, but fawn has to be let go, because it was too big, and it was destroying the crops.  You have to watch.  This is a nice movie for children to watch.",1487289600,2,516,3.80188679245283

6481743,5,B00LEW3L7M,My dad is 80.  This was his favorite story from when he was a small boy.  He talked about it from time to time. so for Christmas this year I decided to order the DVD for him to watch with his grandkids aging from 10-15 years old.  He loved it!! it really makes a person this age feel special for their old memories to be shared.,1485388800,,328,3.9393939393939394

6481745,1,B00LEW3L7M,"This rating is NOT for the movie itself, which is first class - one of my favorite movies. The disc that it came on is faulty - maybe bootlegged. The front picture on the disc is ""odd"". The back (recorded side) is dark purple - indicating a home recording. The worst part is it WILL NOT PLAY on my DVD player!!  (gives a ""disc error"" message) It will, however play on my laptop PC. This is the second disc I bought from Amazon (as seller - not a third party seller) that has come this way. I hope Amazon is not lowering its standards and buying from disreputable manufacturers.",1481673600,3,577,4.293577981651376

6481765,5,B00LEW3L7M,"This period piece is a outstanding look at a slice of Americana!  It stands strong by itself as a coming of age tale regardless of the time its set in.  It as a product has great audio & visual clarity & as a film it has stunning cinematography.  I fell in love with this movie the first time I saw it, it has wonderfully developed characters, action & adventure & the acting from all involved is super!!!  The dynamic's among the family are acted out at times with such subtle brilliance it is so realistic that you as if you are a mouse in the corner instead of watching big named star acting.  This movie was nominated for 7 Academy Awards & won 2 plus a special Award given for ""The Outstanding Child Actor's Award"" for the young star Claude Jarman Jr. !  Apparently I'm not the only one that was impressed by this  film.  This film while showing the dangers of the Florida Fauna it is more about personal growth & family than other Period pieces about this same location that really showcase the jungles of Florida as being just as formidable as any other jungle on the planet like ""Winds A crossed the Everglades"" & "" Yellow Neck"" both great but very hard to find films!  ""The Yearling"" is a movie for the whole family & being a period piece it is really hard for it to seem dated.  My 20 year old daughter totally enjoyed it  but did ask me ""Is this going to be like a sad Old Yeller thing?"" L.O.L.  I reluctantly said ""Kinda but the Deer doesn't get rabies.""  She pressed me with a few more questions like ""Doe's that mean guy shoot it?"" & I told her "" I really don't want to spoil it but , yes it has sad moments. But it is a coming of age tale & without adversity its hard to learn life lesson's & grow from them.""  But my point is that this film has never failed to satisfy anyone I have gotten to watch it!!!  This great movie takes you back to a time when hard work paid off, when families were not separated from each other while in the same room with everyone's face stuck into their smart phones isolated from each other while only inches away!  Back to a time when family came first & you felt a moral obligation to help your neighbor's because surviving the elements was as real of a problem as underemployment is today. But I am straying off subject... this is a great addition to anyone's movie library especially a family with young children that can see a more simple way of life & yet still benefit from the movies life lessons.",1460073600,4,2451,4.2613390928725705

6481770,5,B00LEW3L7M,"This wonderful, heartfelt movie was a favorite from my childhood and I was delighted to finally locate it once again.  The characters  (actors) were perfect for their parts, especially Claude Jarman jr. Who played Jody as the lead.  The movie contains adventure, excitement, humor as well as moments of heart rendering sadness that can still bring on the tears.  The scenes of wild animals was incredible.  One scene in particular of several deer running and leaping through the woods with Jody and his pet fawn doing the same in the background still boggles the mind.  In addition, the movie contains a bonus feature telling how it was made which was quite entertaining in itself.  All in all, a fantastic family film!",1442448000,8,719,4.892561983471074

Jody is the only surviving child of a pioneer family in Florida that endures injuries, privations, and the struggle to survive.  Finally Jody matures by learning that life is hard and nature an unforgiving foe.  The cinematography is spectacular, and the musical score is appropriate to the action.",1513468800,,470,5.0
