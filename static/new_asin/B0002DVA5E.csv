8026976,3,B0002DVA5E,"This was not exactly what I was expecting. I thought it was going to be more about techniques for using small knives whereas it was more of a demonstration video about small knife effectiveness. It talks about small blades (3"" and less) in a variety of styles, and the pros and cons of each for personal defense, but it's a boring 60 minute video that probably could have been cut to 30 more interesting minutes. He talks about/tests every blade multiple times, whereas he probably only really needed to go into detail on a couple during the cutting tests. It got very repetitive and boring and I personally think the throwing knives and stars portion was at best impractical and at worst filler. I appreciated the fact that his tests certainly were not rehearsed nor re-shot to play up the performance of a blade or Lenny's own skills, as a lot of the smaller blades performed poorly in the various cutting tests, including Lenny's own daily keychain carry. Lenny was honest about the shortcomings of each - weight, grip, effectiveness, etc.. The clothing/meat cutting tests were interesting and, in some cases, a little eye opening. At the same time, he wasn't consistent with the gusto behind his slashing/stabbing. Sometimes he just seemed to be batting away at stuff half-heartedly. Either way, again, this could have been distilled down into more general, practical short blade presentations with about 1/2 the running time.
If you're interested in seeing how short blades perform in a variety of simulated tests, this is a video for you but if you are looking to learn something about knife combat, this isn't worth the money for the 5 minutes of knife fighting demonstration at the end. Lenny presents interesting theory about where/how to strike if you ever really have to but, at the same time, the scenarios were unrealistic and most of his advice would probably get you cut up or killed in real life. He waits until close to the end to tell you to run, which should be the first advice. His own assessments of reaction times pretty much tells you that should never get in a fight.",1383436800,,2092,4.765840220385675
