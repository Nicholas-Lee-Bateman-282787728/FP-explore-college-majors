8410138,5,B003ZB72QG,"This is my all time favorite Jazzercise video.  It is about 15 minutes long and you can do it at a lower level or at a higher level.  It is perfect for people who are just starting out and want to get moving, but as you advance you can do this routine with greater intensity and still get a wonderful workout.  In addition, it is short enough that you can even do it twice back to back when you become more advanced.

I love how this routine tones my body in all the right (places stomach, thighs, and butt).  Really it tones your entire body but those three are the ones I appreciate the most from this video.

Transfer it to a DVD and you are set to go!",1404950400,,655,4.038759689922481
8410139,1,B003ZB72QG,Thank goodness my son fixed the plastic cover.  Judi's work out has easy steps but gives you a great workout.  I was sweating and really breathing; that was at the first half of the tape.,1358121600,,187,4.314285714285714
