8204220,1,B000S3994W,"Received Region-2. Will NOT play in the United States. The picture on the cover of the DVD, which I received, is the same picture shown on Amazon's product-page. I believe Amazon's product-page is wrong and the pictured DVD is NOT available in Region-1.

This film, ""The Rag Nymph"" is available in Region-1, USA, with a different picture on the cover; produced by a different studio ""Acorn"" media; the cover-picture is of a young girl. It is a good movie; five-stars. An orphaned, little girl is pursued by a wicked pimp, who runs a whore house. A woman and her son help the orphaned girl, but can they protect her from this evil man, who will not give-up though many years pass.",1500422400,,679,4.6115702479338845
