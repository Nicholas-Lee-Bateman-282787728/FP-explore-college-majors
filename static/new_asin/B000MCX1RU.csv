2728194,5,B000MCX1RU,"..please...please...bring this out on DVD! How much trouble could it be? It's only 2 seasons and while the first was better than the second, it'd be great to have them both. The second ends on a cliffhanger we never got an answer too which of course left its fanbase even more tantalised...xoxo",1238889600,26,294,4.673076923076923
2728195,4,B000MCX1RU,"This is one of the best 80's tv shows.  I remember coming in while my parents were watching it and I saw Morgan Fairchild for the first time (was about 8 or 9years old).  Till this day, she is one of the most beautiful women to have ever graced the tv screens.  The show was good for its time - better then the silly storylines of existing soaps.  Constance's (Morgan Fairchild) and Titus' (Howard Duff) scheming and manipulating makes good viewing and leaves the viewer wanting more.  There are also a couple of boring scenes escpecially those featuring Skipper (Woody Brown) and scenes of Elmo.  Stella Stevens also does a good job as Lute-Mae Sanders (she looks like she could really be Morgan's mother - the resemblence is uncanny).  The story basically goes:  Claude Weldon had an affair with Lute-Mae Sanders and they had a daughter.  Lute-Mae gave up the daughter to Claude.  Claude married Eudora and led her to believe that he adopted Contance as their new daughter.  He kept his affair (with her support) with Lute-Mae secret and also him fathering Constance.  Contanstance grew up as a Weldon (but knew that she was adopted) and fell in love with the senators' son, Fielding Carlyle (portrayed by Mark Harmon).  The senator died and Fielding was basically brought up under the guiding hand of Titus (the towns' sherrif).  Titus (with the Weldons) ruled Truro.  His ambition was to have Fielding marry Constance to further his (Fieldings') political career as state senator.  In pops Lane Balou who puts a blot on Titus' plans to have Constance and Fielding living happily ever after.  Fielding and Lane falls in love - enters Sam (John Beck) who also has a thing for Lane Balou.  Lane becomes confused on who to choose and later ends up marrying Sam.  Constance and Fielding doesn't have a good marriage and almost ends up in divorce (it doesn't happen though because she become paralysed).
Enter Michael Tyrone who beds both mother (Lute-Mae Sanders) and daughter (Constance Weldon Carlyle) and in his twisted revenge to ruin Truro for sentencing his father to death years before blurts out to Constance that she's the illigitimate daughter of the towns' Madam.  From here on out, the plot changes to voodoo and weirdness.
There is a lot of bad acting (Cynthia Sykes springs to mind) but the beautiful people makes up for it and the storyline pre-voodoo makes for good viewing.  Keep in mind that this is an old tv show (typewriters, no computers) - but is still quite enjoyable.",1199577600,46,2491,4.800469483568075

2728198,5,B000MCX1RU,Many people do not remember it.  It was the first.  It started the entire genre of night time serial dramas.  It had a too short a reign.  Unfortunately it came to an end because there was an interracial couple.  The studio got thousands of letters and calls including death threats.  I'd love to see it again.  There wouldn't be a Dallas or Falcon Crest if it had not been for Flamingo Road.,1371859200,,392,4.361111111111111

2728201,5,B000MCX1RU,"Can I just politely clear up some eronious reviews here on amazon, regarding flamingo roads date position and Who and what came first In the usa..
Dallas was first shown in mid spring 1978 having started to be filmed late 1977 and that was the 5 episode mini series then later in 1978 the first full season started.
Knot's Landing first season was first shown from 27th december onwards in 1979 making it the 2nd big prime timer to come along, Next was the Flamingo Road pilot film was shown may of 1980, then the first full season aired from january 6th 1981'
Dynasty aired from jan 12th of 1981, then Falcon Crest aired from december 4th 1981.
Flamingo road was not the 'first prime time' soap chronologically speaking,, Dallas takes that honor, flamingo rd was in the middle of it all.
But I remember Northern ireland, Late night, BBC 1, mid to late 1983, and we were getting to see the second season of flamingo road! And it was Just Fabulous!.
My mum loved it, I do too.
I have crap bootlegs of this taped from the goodlife channel, i'd love a legitamate release for dvd by warners.
I wish they still made them like this!.
Good ole Lorimar, they made great programs! And this was so good why was it axed?.
I'l buy this when it comes out officially.
Morgan fairchild is so amusingly good, great cast, barbara rush was beautiful too and able to act a great part in truro, love it!.

Update 3rd feb 2015
There are a few reviews here stating how flamingo road was allegedly Thee first night time, therefore primetime, soap and 'if it wasn't for flamingo road such and such wouldn't have been etc'
Well
Dallas premiered its 5 episode mini series in early 1978 as a Mid season replacement, and filming had started very late 1977 on that.
The first Full season of Dallas aired in late 78 with filming taking place from spring 78.

Knotslanding premiered 27th december 1979, filming started summer of 79'.

Flamingo road Pilot premiered on May 12th 1980! Filming started february of 1980, then the first actual season premiered on 6th jan 1981! Where filming started late summer of 80' on that, and on Until its demise at the end of season two in may 1982
.
Dynasty premiered in january 1981, filming started summer 1980
Falcon crest had a Pilot called 'the vintage years' premier in summer 1981 then the series premiered in late 1981 filming started early summer 81.
Sorry folks but flamingo was out the same time as all the others, it wasn't first at all, But it did make a Huge impact with people, and Lorimar left all of us wondering why it was suddenly cancelled?
I just had to say.
Thanks

2728202,5,B000MCX1RU,"This was truly the first and best Prime Time Soap Drama series I ever watched. Yes before Dynasty and Falcon Crest was Flamingo Road. Created by the same people who did Knots Landing and I cannot to this day understand why it never last beyond its 2 years. It was everything a Soap was back in those days and awesome. I actually liked it better than Dallas and Dynasty!! Morgan was great in it as was Marc Harmon. I remember when it was cancelled I was pissed! I recently bought the series from a collector. Not bad quality since I don't think this series will see the light of day on DVD anytime soon. I must say I started watching it again this weekend and I'm in love with it still. I remember the basic storyline but forgot alot of the other good parts so its great to have it in my library to re-watch. If you never saw this show and it does come out on DVD or you can get a copy on an auction site, go for it....you got to see it!!",1341619200,15,937,4.07027027027027

This is one of the few night time soaps that enthralled me from beginning to the end and I would love to walk down memory lane again and relive every minute of this series. Amazon, you must do everything possible to bring back this gem of days gone by back to the TV screen. Dallas, Knots Landing, Falcon Crest and the rest have been reran to death in syndication and internet services, so please help put some new life into TV viewing and give us what we ask for. You won't be disappointed.

If this were available on DVD, I would buy it in an instant (not least because it featured the gorgeous Mark Harmon) - yup, I'm a huge NCIS/Gibbs fan.
