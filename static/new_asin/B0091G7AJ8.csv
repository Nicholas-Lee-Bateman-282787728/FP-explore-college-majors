I am using the programs with my behavior disordered students and I am enjoying watching my student remember the lessons and discussing what happened and/or what should have been done differently.

As you can see 3 of the DVDs don't seem to be coloring sheets (unless they're reversible).  Also one of the episodes is repeated, which isn't too bad, BUT that also makes it only 49 episodes, not ""OVER 50"" as stated on the box and in the description.  I have another Berenstain Bears collection that has tons of episodes repeated and no episode list on the back so to find out which ones are on the disc, you have to put the disc in and wait through all the company logos.

Overall it's not a bad set (definitely the best so far), but it makes claims that just aren't true.  If you're buying this for the series itself, I recommend it, but understand it's not quite Ultimate yet.",1428710400,37,1893,4.759146341463414

5241863,5,B0091G7AJ8,"These are the DVDs of the Berenstain Bear stories, which are great in themselves.  The books about these bears number in the dozens (maybe even over 100).  Each has a message for children with a moral, or how to rectify a troublesome situation.  The Bear family is Mama, Papa, Sister (who is about 7 years old) and Brother (who is about 9 years old).  Together they overcome such problems as ""the in crowd,"" keeping up with homework, not helping around the house, accepting people for who they are, dealing with peer pressure, wanting too many toys, etc.  These cartoons are not dumbed down, and really not too ""cartoonish"" but they are not preachy, either.  The bear children (and their parents) aren't perfect, but they usually work out some solution.  There are other bear characters in some of the stories, such as friends, grandparents and neighbors (all bears of course).  The animation is really quite good.  Your kids will learn something from each one, but will have fun too.",1394755200,4,984,4.809523809523809
