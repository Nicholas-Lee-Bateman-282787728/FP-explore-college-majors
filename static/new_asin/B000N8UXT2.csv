2760966,5,B000N8UXT2,I was so glad when the 1st season came to DVD but now the 2nd season is out so soon after the 1st? This is great. Keep 'em coming.,1175731200,4,130,3.5172413793103448
2760967,5,B000N8UXT2,"Two seasons in less than 6 months? It must be the end of the world! Why not just release them every other month, we true Martin fans will snatch them right-up as soon as they come out. We waited long enough.",1175472000,19,207,4.073170731707317
2760968,5,B000N8UXT2,"So Season 1 came out earlier this year and now Season 2!! I can't wait.  I love this show and I never get tired of watching re-runs.  One other reviewer was right, the episode with the Notorious BIG is classic!  I feel all the episodes were great, I even got two copies of the first season, just in case something happened to one of the copies.  I don't know if I'm going to do the same for this season because all that adds up and I have bills :(.  I even like looking at the box, it's so pretty.  Good-bye burned copies that were probably transferred from VCR tapes!!",1175385600,3,569,4.174311926605505
2760969,5,B000N8UXT2,"OMG! I am so excited about the release of the 2nd season of Martin.  I mistakenly did not pre-order season 1 and it took me about 1 month to get a copy in the stores because it was continually sold out.  So everybody pre-order your copy!

Watching season 1 definetely was a pleasure and had some great episodes but I can not wait for season 2 and the introduction of Brother Man (I hope the episode where Brother Man takes Martin's portable CD player is on here).  Season 2 definetely had some of the best espisodes and in my opinion was the best overall season.

(Quick sidebar: Although in my opinion season 2 was the best season it does not include the best Martin episode - the one with the Notorious BIG and the singing competition.  That episode is a classic!)",1175126400,4,766,4.397163120567376
2760970,5,B000N8UXT2,"Its about freaking time! I pity the poor fools who wasted money on those Canadian DVR copies of Martin. The series is being sold bootleg style on recordable DVR's-- phooey! I love the fact that these DVD's are authentic studio releases and come complete with extras. One thing though-- why doesn't the menu include a ""repeat/repeat all"" option? At any rate I am sooo looking forward to owning all the seasons-- I never get tired of this show :-)",1174867200,3,445,4.6455696202531644
2760971,5,B000N8UXT2,"Okay, I have season 1, pre-ordered it and all, man I was rolling, just having flashbacks when this came on a regularly when I was younger. Season 1 was a pretty good season, but it wasn't the best season. I know for sure season 2 will have all of Martin favorites. Hopefully this season will have the big ole fat rat episode, or him gettin beat down in the boxing match, or Gena getting her head stuck in the headboard! Now those are the classics. Can't wait to spend a whole weekend again watching Martin.",1174348800,3,506,4.336842105263158
2760972,5,B000N8UXT2,"Yeah, I preordered it. Yeah I squealed and jumped up and down when I opened my mailbox and found the Amazon packaging inside. I'm guilty.

Martin-The Complete Second Season is everything I remembered. This season was recorded live with no second takes, so there are times when the cast is laughing without cue. This season includes classic episodes like the Varnell Hill Show in Hollywood, and when Martin and Gina try to go two weeks without the.....you know! Martin got beat up by a Michael Jackson wanna be, and Pam stalked who she thought was Denzel Washington.

Another great feature is that unlike Season One, this season includes a PLAY ALL feature!!! Patience is a virtue, or so they say. And like all other ""patient"" Martin fans, I am ""patiently"" waiting for Season Three........HBO, HURRY UP!!!",1172966400,,804,4.904411764705882

2760988,5,B000N8UXT2,"Martin never gets old. Favorite sitcom of all time. Love it & laugh faithfully. Best thing about season 2 was the addition of new characters like: Bro' Man-upstairs 5th floor (holding up 4 fingers) & classic episodes such as: Really, Gina's not my lover, where Martin had to go back to his class reunion to beef with his old high school rival, Rickey Funtane (Pretty Rickey's what they called him) or fighting Thomas Hitman Hearns. This is must have for any martin fan.",1510358400,,469,4.662650602409639

Others shows i do watch...The Big Bang Theory ( recommended by a friend)  Mike and Molly (not lol funny, but has its charm). Mama's  Family ( nostalgia...), and the horrible Two Broke Girls...
I recently gave up on The Two Broke Girls....just a horrendously unfunny show.  Flat joke  a minute and the forced laugh track will make you go insane.

No cheesy and cheap laugh tracks on Martin , but a live audience and the cast do laugh with you.

Martin is one of the best sitcoms ever. The other one being The Simpsons.
The Simpsons will also make you laugh out loud too but, without ANY audible laughs from anyone except you. Another great great show.",1449273600,,740,4.518796992481203

2761201,5,B000N8UXT2,"Martin, the most famous of the 90s ethnically-cast shows, is one of the funniest television sitcom shows of all time -- and it really hit its stride in Season Two. The second-best episode of the series is here, wherein Gina accidentally kills Martin's terrifying, domineering mother's pet bird.

The best episode of the entire series is also here: episode 7 of the season (episode 34 of 132 episodes total). In the aptly named ""Control"" Gina accidentally throws away Martin's NBA tickets and ends up working at the hair salon owned by Martin's bossy neighbor, Sheneneh. The episode is really a showcase for Martin Lawrence's comedic gift, and he gets to showcase his signature gag of playing multiple characters. Tisha Campbell and Tichina Arnold play straight to Lawrence's antics brilliantly, and it's really a shame they haven't continued to do substantial work in Hollywood.

Martin often suffered from uneven and cliched writing that did not to justice to the talents of its wonderful and underrated cast, but this episode is well-written in addition to being well-acted. The crowning jewel in a season of gems that really bring back mid-90s nostalgia.

Other must-see episodes well-known to fans of the series include those involving Martin confronting his high school nemesis Pretty Ricky, and Martin getting in over his head by challenging a professional boxer to a grudge match. For non-fans, I'd actually suggest watching this season before any of the others, as they will be a letdown -- especially the disastrous 5th and final season.",1383782400,,1546,5.126984126984127

2761235,5,B000N8UXT2,"""Martin's"" second act is no disappointment. After the brilliant first season, Martin and the gang return with more laughs and more memorable moments. The level of classics may not be as common as in the first season (still the best, in my opinion), but the moments are definitely there. This season, the characters are more developed, and the subtleties that made this show so great are really starting to gain momentum, including the through-thick-and-thin affection between Martin and Gina, Martin's endless catalogue of Pam jokes, Tommy ""not havin no job"" and Cole just being a bumbling idiot. Sure, these themes thrived towards the middle and end of the first season, but the formula has pretty much been perfected in Season 2. Some of the classic moments from this season: Martin's high school reunion, his duels with Tommy Hearns in the boxing ring and ""Michael Jackson"" in a Hollywood parking lot, Gina killing Mama Payne's beloved bird, and Martin, Tommy and Cole delivering a baby. This season also features appearances by many of the colorful characters that fans of the series can't live without, including Bro'Man, Jerome, and Officer Otis. The laughs are non-stop, and this DVD set will leave you wanting more. This and the first season set (along with the 3rd season DVD), are friendly reminders that before the controversies and backstage circumstances that lessened the quality of the show's later seasons, ""Martin"" was truly one of the funniest shows in TV history, African-American or otherwise.",1196380800,3,1513,5.129554655870446

Martin, is one of the best comedians out there, he's and original.
Doing the type of things you wish you could do and get away with.

Most people would find themselves in trouble if they tried what he tries.
But he's alway got another way every time.

He deals with people and likes getting it off his chest right then and there. Always wants to prove he can handle the fall-out too.

That's a talent.

When the other charactors try, they get blasted back as usual.
Now they want Martins, help... but not without having to listen to...
"" Here; Le'me show'ya how to handle it ""... ...

Everybodies shocked, they never know how things are going to turn out.
If they try it, it always back-fires.

  This show was one of the last great TV sitcoms. Martins great characters really made this sitcom work. When I look back at the characters Martin created I think how great a talent Martin Lawrence is. Do you see this type of character actor today? not much (Jim Carey?) I was a little disappointed in the special features. I'm hoping at some point most of the cast will get together and talk about what made the show so good. I hope they take the time with the next season and give more behind the scenes look at the show. I can't wait for the next Season !!!!

2761244,5,B000N8UXT2,"Since upcoming seasons are only released if previous seasons have done well, then I hope everyone whose a fan of Martin's classic show continues to buy, because I learned that the only reason why the other seasons of shows like Wayans Bros., Jamie Foxx Show, Living Single,(mostly the black comedy sitcoms) haven't been released for a second season yet because they didn't sell well, so if not enough people bought the first season, that's why you haven't seen anything about any of those shows' second seasons coming out, thank goodness Martin has been one of the more popular, or lucky black sitcoms to even be consider for DVD release, and it hasn't taken forever for it to come out, I have already got an e-mail saying that they are already in the process of putting out the 3rd season, with a release date of November 6, not unless it gets changed.

But personally I think Martin was one of the best shows of the 90s, that's why I really miss the 90s, because you had so many good shows on tv at the time, unlike now, a lot of shows geared towards black people aren't really that creative and funny as they once were, and as a black person, I feel a lot of these young people should be able to experience some of these 90s shows, you had, ""Martin,"" ""The Wayans Bros.,"" ""The Jamie Foxx Show,"" ""The Parent 'Hood,"" ""Living Single,"" ""Moesha,"" and so many more!",1186012800,12,1361,4.510121457489879

2761256,5,B000N8UXT2,"For those that think Martin Lawrence is unfunny. Buy this season set and find out why he is such a big star.
Some of the comedy is situational ala Threes Company. But it's Martins zany characters that really make this sitcom work. The most developed of the characters is Shanaynae. She is so outrageous yet seems so real and weirdly so much like just another cast member.
To be honest I haven't viewed the entire set only the first 09 episodes.  I had to skip 10-20 just to see an episode that I hadn't seen in 10 years but can recite one of Martins lines on the spot. ""I'll take a bucket of fries, two chitlins and a bowl of sunflower seeds"" said that after being punched senseless by Thomas Hearns in ""Guard your Grill"" which is the funniest thing you'll ever see in life, period.

2761264,5,B000N8UXT2,"I think the Martin television series is one of the most important television shows in urban/African-American television history and it is proof that good comedy doesn't have to be vulgar, crude or disrespectful to its audience and yet still deliver the laughs as riotously and consistently as this show always does.  The writing was superb, the acting was terrific, and the ensemble cast worked so well together on-screen that it was hard to imagine that they weren't all really friends in real life.  The show never seems to seem ""stale"" or out-dated, even after the show has been off the air for many years.  I have watched shows countless times, and the laughs still come as strong as they were first-run episodes and that is a rarity that speaks well to why the show was so successful.  I'm a fan for life and I would not hesitate to allow my own children to watch the show, and that speaks VOLUMES.  Martin Lawrence, if he does nothing else (although we know he has and will), should be proud of this body of work and he should feel comfortable when he is mentioned with the likes of Flip Wilson, Redd Foxx, and early Richard Pryor (before big-budget movie fame) when it comes to being a part of black performers in ground-breaking television history.

And specifically, let me speak to this 2-part episode in this landmark television show.  For a few seasons, we followed Martin and Gina in their VERY normal up and down, but always LOVING relationship and were content with the fact that they had not yet made it to the alter because you always had a sense that it was inevitable and would happen someday.  We understood they are made for each other and no matter what, they would make it final in due time.  But you never felt a sense of urgency or longed for immediate resolution to this question, and that is a credit to the way the writers, producers, and actors chose to deal with the issue and it always worked on-screen.  But as in normal relationships like these, you knew the time would come when rightfully so, Gina would want to be married and ready to start the next chapter and so this 2-parter dealt with this topic...finally.  And we relate to BOTH parties with their particular stance on the issue because it seemed REAL and not forced for the sake of pleasing a television audience.  But not to give anything away for those who have not seen the show (which I find VERY HARD TO BELIEVE), the way the show dealt with the inevitable was so satisfying and rewarding that even after I have seen this episode 15-20 times...it STILL holds up.  It doesn't come off to sappy or melodramatic, but simply real, poignant, relevant, and well...just right.  This gem is one of many in a proud show that I recommend to EVERYONE.  I'm a fan for life, Martin.  A fan for life.",1180396800,5,2784,4.5602409638554215
