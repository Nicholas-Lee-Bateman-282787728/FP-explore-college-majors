1731530,5,B00006950U,"Boy does this movie take me back! As a So. Cal. surf rat growing up in the 70's, the Z-Boys represented everything my friends and I were shooting for. Not exactly what you would call ideal role models, especially as far as my parents were concerned. Never the less, they carried themselves with such style and mystique that we were all spellbound by thier mere presence. My mother read an interview with Tony Alva in on of my issues of ""Skateboarder"" sometime around 76 or 77, and her response was - and I'll never forget this - ""He is sickening. He makes me sick to my stomach"". Ha! I'd found my new hero! When we went to the skateparks, if any of these guys were there, we'd all just step back and consider class to be in session. They were the guys who started it all, and they did it better than anybody - period. This movie is an outstanding document of an amazing slice of American history. The editing, the sountrack, the narration - it's all there. Stacy Peralta has put together his interpretation of his early life with stellar results. I'm sure there is way more left out than what made it into the final edit, but outside of living it yourself, you can never know the whole story anyway.
It's interesting to note the ego's of thier youth vs. where they all stand today. Biniack appears to be ""happy with himself"". Alva seems to be letting his history do his bidding for him. Red Dog and Wentzle seem to have humbled over the years, without forgetting anything about how they became who they are. And Jay Adams, well, a sad story to be sure, but one that is thankfully still in progress. (welcome back, Jay!) Hopefully he will keep it together and show us what it's all really about once again. To all of those criticizing this movie for being too ""self-congratulatory"", well, all I can say is you sure missed the friggin' point! If you can't see the impact these guys have had on modern pop culture, you are as blind as a bat. You may say ""they're just skateboarders"", but if you look around, you'll see that they have dealt a sturdy hand in just about every corner of this country, if not the world. No one makes movies about people who stand back and say ""shucks"", nor does anybody want to watch one. Where does that leave us? Observing what some might think of as mindless egomaniacs beating on thier chests, but consider this: These guys are interesting, dynamic athletes that defied and rewrote the rules and conventions of organized sports. X-games anyone? I doubt they'd exist if not for the trail blazed by the Z-Boys. Thier achievments seem rediculously obvious to me. They changed the world that I like to live in. That takes ego, balls, and of course, STYLE! As I watched the film, and they detailed their youthful and sometimes criminal exploits, I never once got the feeling that they felt they were ever doing anything other than being themselves. The notariety seemed to be an afterthought for the most part. It would be so disapointing if they felt the need to apolgize for that. The Dogtown nay-sayers can talk all they want. Fact is, the Z-Boys don't give a rats hiney. You have to have done something pretty great to get people talking about you to anywhere near the extent of the rhetoric surrounding the almost mythical achievments attained by these guys. Good or bad - it doesn't matter. They made a movie about them. They write books about them. Apparently, we still care, because we see the movies and read the books. Love 'em or hate 'em, deep down inside, we all know why they are still important all these years later, right?",1028592000,5,3564,4.535714285714286
1731531,5,B00006950U,"How to begin this interview without sounding like a 30 plus wishing that he was 18 again...Forget it, I have to gush.
I wasn't sure about what could come of this when I first heard that the documentary was being made, but once I saw Stacy's name as th director, I felt reassured that it would be the right thing.  Once the film started rolling I was transported back in time to my Junior High years 1975-77.
Every picture flashed on the screen that was culled from Friedman's awesome footage made me laugh, made me cry and most of all made me want to run out and skate again.  Everything from the editing, music, and interviews told the story as well as it could be told.  Sure, it's self congratulatory, what do you expect from these boys?  did you think that it was going to be a Hallmark greeting card?
This Film flat out rules.  No one is going to be completely satisfied with what they did or didn't get from the production, but thanks god it's out there.  BTW, Good to see Henry Hester is still out there, give it up for the slalom king of San Diego.  (I am frightened to see that Fred Durst, of the most god awful band to ever record, Limp Bizkit, is directing the fictional version of this awesome piece of So Cal cultural history.)  Anyway, this is a must buy if you have not made the choice.",1028505600,,1301,4.281632653061225
1731532,5,B00006950U,"I was soo glad I saw this movie...I'm from SoCal and I live in FL. It made me want to hop a plane and go home! Whether you have an apriciation for skating or are a hardcore skater, this movie is a must see! The soundtrack kicks. I wanna go hoooome!! *sniffle*",1026950400,,259,4.0
1731533,3,B00006950U,Too bad Peralta didn't tell the story of  what was really happening at the beach. It could have been great...Parelta gave the yuppie kook memory of it...The best part of this movie is the P.O.P. parts .  .  . and the music...,1026864000,,225,4.309523809523809
1731534,5,B00006950U,"This is the most passionate & inspiring film I've ever seen. Should be required viewing for any kid looking for a focus on life. Beautifully filmed/edited... perfect balance of old, rough, scrappy footage interspliced with the modern. The music couldn't be better. Put on your Vans & watch it. Then rewind & watch it again.",1025481600,2,323,4.890909090909091
1731535,5,B00006950U,"Although it's been out for a number of months, it took me way too long to get to a theater to see it.  I can't tell you how important this film is.  As this ground breaking documentary starts to unfold, Stacy and Craig give you a bird's eye view of their 70's concrete playground, complete with historical reasoning for why Dogtown ever existed (and where, exactly, it existed).  The editing style is incredible. At one point, Sean Penn makes a verbal mistake yet keeps on going through his description.  Any other editor would have cut it and retaped the audio but keeping it in made the whole thing way more real, like Sean was talking to YOU.  In addition some of the skaters, in their interviews are ""Fast Forwaded"" on screen.  Very slick way of clipping the bull and getting to the meat.
This movie is a cultural document that should be played in schools, design studios, city halls and to every youngster who ever thought he knew everything about skating, the X games, Bob Burnquist and Tony hawk.  Thank God someone caught as much 70s ""film"" as they did and thank God these guys got this important era of our American culture on DVD.  Buy it. Show it to your kids.  Make them watch it.  Then... take them out, loosen their trucks and make them do berts until they get it down.",1023840000,31,1283,4.467811158798283
1731536,5,B00006950U,"Went to see Dogtown last week in the newly refurbished Del Mar Theater in downtown Santa Cruz CA.  This movie moves you, makes you think and is flat out entertaining with its realism.  A sure bet for those that want some insight into the origins of today's skateboarding world.  Amazing vintage footage from the 60's & 70's, plus great narration and interviews.  The crowd at the theater gave it a standing ovation at the end of the movie.  Joe Bob says check it out!",1022716800,,467,4.511904761904762
1731537,4,B00006950U,"This movie is told by the main players...and it comes off a little on the self congratitulatory side. It however,is a worthwhile way to spend a couple of hours...the sound track is righteous and the editing punchy. If you are at all interested in skateboarding or seventies culture..it is a must see.
If you are a skate ""grommet""...GO NOW and learn the history.
If you are an ""ex skater"" SHAME ON YOU....but go see the movie...and buy some old school skate gear on [local store]..and drive the prices up for everyone else who never quit.",1022457600,2,537,4.663157894736842
1731538,4,B00006950U,"If you were ""hardcore"" into skating in the 80's or especialy the 70's (I was only just born at the end of the 70's) this film explains the birth and growth of skateboarding from a dinky little sport about weaving between witches hats on boards with clay wheels (yes clay as in pottery) to the maximum vert, hardcore sport that it developed into. There are some major godfathers of skateboarding staring in the film, Stacy Perralta (as in powell perralta) and Tony Alva (as in Alva Skateboards). There is also the guy who started Dogtown Skateboards.
A very interesting documentary that made me go out skating the very next day and made my friends buy new skateboards even though we are all 25+. I am glad that someone who was one of the original Z-boys crew made the film so as we didn't end up with a realy cheesy look at a sport that we lived for. Sean Penn has a great voice and narates the film very well, the soundtrack is awsome and I can only hope that it gets released on CD.
I have heard that this film will not be released on DVD, so if you skated hard in the 80's and you missed this film you should go and kick youself.
Skateboarding is not a crime",1019433600,5,1160,4.277272727272727

The movie is in HD because the ones who created it formatted it in the sense.  Yet, the movie is not crisp as other HD movies and the format is in the display of a square rather than a rectangle.

If you can get past the occasional 'little guy in big shorts' boasting and a few unwanted Henry Rollins' cameos, this documentary about the Zephyr boys of Dogtown should keep your eyes glued to the set. What makes this film even more compelling to watch is that it was made by insider and former Z-boy, Stacy Peralta. Old footage and photographs are included, along with interviews, special features, and narration by Sean Penn.

With fire in their eyes, the Z-boys skated with reckless abandon. They lived for the moment. One or more may have dropped out of school to do exactly what they wanted: surfing, skating, hanging out... Whether they were shredding the Venice Beach waters or carving up catch basins and empty pools, they were a formidable and territorial bunch. Before long they would be idolized throughout the country for their skill, style, and swagger. Since the rise of the Z-boys in the 70's, freestyle skating would never be the same... If you like watching your hometown boys skate, prepare to be dazzled by the footage of Z-boy Jay Adams.",1427587200,,1304,4.8475336322869955

1731628,5,B00006950U,"I'm 47 now. I was 37 when I first saw Stacey's film. But, I was 12 years old in 1977, and grew up in the heart of Dogtown (Santa Monica) myself. For most of my life, at least since I was 12, I have been reminiscing about the skate culture that was born around me in the 70's. In the 1970's, Santa Monicans struggled from a lack of jobs, low wages, high interest rates, and low property values. While the Santa Monica Pier was preserved from destruction, it was nonetheless poorly maintained, and eventually blighted. The area around the pier was filled with poorly built, badly maintained structures that housed biker bars, head shops, and arcades rife with drug dealers. All the skaters I knew were latch-key kids with drug addled parents, disillusioned by the 60's, and keenly aware of the urban decay around us. We were angry, rebellious, and it showed in the way we surfed the asphalt. Though Stacey's film focuses on a few key figures, DT&ZB is also about a culture that changed its participants, and the world around them; permanently. Skate culture is about ritual and community as much as it is about skating. Anthropological rituals, particularly rites of passage, ultimately result in a permanent change to the participant's social status. In the first phase there is a detachment of the individual from an earlier fixed point in social structure; as a consequence their status becomes liminal. In liminal situations, initiands live outside their normal environment and, through a series of experiences involving pain and loss, are brought to question the self, the existing social order, and the nature of existence itself. In this way initiands grow into a new social role. Skating into and amongst Dogtown was a liminal experience that forced those of us that were part of it, to become more than the sum of our parts; and we were good at it. I have watched, and gifted this film to everyone I know and love - and will watch it with grand-kids, and great grand-kids, and likely ask that a copy of it be buried with me when die. Thank you Stacey - people finally know what I've been talking about all these years.",1345075200,2,2125,4.71505376344086
1731629,5,B00006950U,"I love this documentary and have watched it several times. The soundtrack is so great... the guys (and Peggy Oki) were probably listening to all the songs heard here on their FM radios... great photos and the interviews are terrific. And one thing that really struck me is how similar Venice,CA and Asbury Park, NJ were to each other in the 70s. The hard-to-surf, downright dangerous waves and ways to hurt or kill yourself especially, the scary, haunted house feel of decaying former amusement playlands making it all too plain that the veneers sold to Dogtown's former residents/vacationers are wafer-thin. These kids grew up seeing the brutal truth of economic downturn and what waited for them as they became adults all too plain. But embracing their environment and overcoming obstacles to achieve the pleasure of surfing, and later, skating pools, made them strong, and all through this doc I rooted for Jay Adams, Stacy Peralta, and Tony Alva (every one on the Zephyr team)... and I hope Jay Adams is out of jail by now and he's getting some sweet waves in Hawaii or in California. I didn't know about Dogtown until I saw this (I knew who Tony Hawk was... and Matt Hoffman... and I think the Jackass guys are funny as hell), and I am so glad I know their history now. Sean Penn narrating is fantastic, and even the heavy dourness seems to have lifted out of his voice for this... he sounds like he is remembering his surfing days (he really was Jeff Spicoli when he was a teen). He deserves to have a fun project like this every now and again considering how many serious roles he plays and his activism :). Henry Rollins included in it is a revelation: I always wondered why he moved to Redondo Beach from DC while the hardcore scene was at its height... now I know: Hank wanted to be a Z-Boy !!!
All in all, even if someone who knew nothing about surfing or skateboarding watched this, I am sure they would be transfixed and uplifted by the story of Dogtown.
And I hope all of them live long happy lives, especially Jay Adams.

1731630,5,B00006950U,"""Dogtown and the Z-Boys"" is a documentary that goes back in time, and profiles the Zephyr skateboarding team who collectively created the modern sport of skateboarding, and thus launch X sports.

Jeff Ho was a surfboard maker who was a genius at carving out revolutionary surfboards, and in founding his own surf shop he and his partners also adopted some surfing teenage misfits from the Dogtown area, and mentored them.  Because surfs ended around 10am the boys had to occupy themselves during the day, and skateboarding became an extension of their surfing identity.  During the 1970s there was a drought in California, and swimming pools had to be emptied.  The boys would jump fences, drain pools, and learn to go vertical in the pools.

This documentary was made by one of the original members of the Z-boys, and that's why there's so an intimate and personal feel to the documentary.  It also helps that the director's partner was the photo-journalist who documented and made popular Dogtown skateboarding.

This film is a labor of love, a remembrance of good times past.  There's also a distinctive rhythm and style to the documentary that makes it as interesting to watch as the teenagers carving their way across swimming pools on their skateboards.",1343520000,,1259,4.990430622009569

I spent my high school years in a neighborhood where nobody skated (come to think of it, they didn't do much at all) and didn't see anyone there on a board until this movie came out. That kickstarted the whole 1980's mania all over again.

Thanks to Dogtown & Zboys we once again have suburbs full of long-haired 14 year olds riding $100 decks that their parents bought for them. Perhaps I shouldn't use the word ""again"" because the ""Dogtown"" area of LA wasn't exactly a ""suburb"" in the modern sense. They were living in a run-down, abandoned seafront strip that nobody wanted.

This is a good movie, but I keep asking myself what's so great about it if you aren't an obsessive skater? Skating is just another sport, so what's the big deal? The one thing I did like about this was the historical aspect; it has value if you want to learn about California in the 70's. Venice Beach became derelict at the same time Asbury Park and Coney Island were going the same way. Most seafront amusement centers were going under in the 1970's thanks to television, cheaper airfare, etc.

Dogtown is a part of greater Los Angeles including south Santa Monica, Venice Beach, and Marina del Rey, a rundown ethnically scrambled slum in the 1960s and 1970s. The Z Boys -- Z for Zephyr -- were the tough local kids who 'proved' themselves first as reckless surfers and then as 'outlaw' skate-boarders, using their surf-style moves and their Dogtown attitudes to invent a 'youth culture' which, from their vantage point, conquered the world. Some of them - Tony Alva for instance - achieved enormous celebrity in the conquered territories. A few made lucrative careers out of their drop-out kids-stuff passion. This film is a documentary of their lifestyle, made up of old scraps of film, mostly amateur, of their escapades as teenagers, along with stunning still photos by an ardent journalist/chronicler, mingled with interviews of the same boys as men in their middle age. The editing is provocatively jagged and jerky, all quick cuts and stuttering images by design, as raggedy as the vacant lots and empty swimming pools of Dogtown where the Z Boys polished their tricks. Actor Sean Penn is the off-screen narrator, but the director/filmmaker Stacy Peralta was a Z Boy himself, an eloquent spokesman for his own life and art. There's nothing dispassionate or exterior about this documentation; these guys truly believe in their own seminal significance. ""It all started here,"" they say again and again, ""with us.""

I'm not so much older than the Z Boys but I'm a different species, from another planet. I've never skate-boarded in my life, although I have skied and kayaked and ice-boated and scuba-dived. But my obsession with style, with exaltation over doing something the best it could be done, with a physical aesthetic at odds with the conventional, seems to me remarkably similar to the rebellious egotism of the Z Boys. My 'home boys' have also conquered the world and compelled others to imitate us. We too have perceived ourselves as 'lords' of our Dogtown. We take our lifestyle just as seriously as the Z Boys. Isn't that rather odd, since they've never heard of me/us any more than I'd ever heard of them before this film! Is it possible that golfers, stock brokers, and pastry chefs all suppose that they are the paladins of culture, the Lords of their parallel Dogtowns? Evolution seems to have equipped all of us with a valuable proprioception that enables us to ignore the fact that nobody outside our own delimited Dogtown has any notion of our importance.

I'm getting quite an education in 'alternate realities' lately -- street art, skate-boarding, video game design, all momentous life styles to the people who practice them. They all have something in common: the intense conviction of their significance among those who excel at them.",1293753600,2,3092,5.011673151750973

There were two Santa Monicas, the exclusive neighborhood and of course, Dogtown. Dogtown was a tough neighborhood but it created a pasttime for youth--skateboarding. The original Z-Boys tell their stories detailing what it was like to be young, carefree and skating on the pavement.
Before skateboarding became a competetive sport, it was a pasttime for the youth to be creative and have fun. Along with surfing, it was considered a sport for outcasts. That didn't stop them from having their fun. Like any activity, it kept them out of trouble and fostered creativity. And like any sport, it became commercialized. Jay Adams, a former Z-Boy, avoided gaining any endorsements because of deadlines, contracts, timeliness, anything that associated with the establishment. For him, skateboarding was exhiliarating. But he also had regrets as well too. For Tony Alva, it capatulted him into the spotlight. He enjoyed getting endorsements, going around the world, and making money. But he too broke away and created his own line of skateboards and continues to this day skate. It is the sport that has fond memories.
What I like about this documentary is that it showed us how much fun people had before the advancement of technology. Before Internet and video games, people went out the house and did something; even if it wasn't conventional. They enjoyed life without being confined to the trappings of wealth. When the big corporations stepped in, they took out the enjoyment of not only skating, but the camraderie of the group. Let's not forget that the small shops that got them in local competitions were forced to close their doors taking away their creativity and talent.

1731648,4,B00006950U,"In 2001, a documentary by legendary skater and documentary filmmaker Stacy Peralta and Craig Stecyk, one of the original founders of Jeff Ho Surfboards and Zephyr Productions surf shop in Venice, California was released to people who have waited for this documentary with high anticipation.

A winner of the Independent Spirit Award for Best Documentary Feature, the documentary focuses on life in Dogtown (Dogtown is the nickname of an area between Santa Monica and Pacific Ocean Park bridge) and the emergence of the Zephyr skateboard team back in the 1970's.  Showcasing  the surf scene near the dilapidated ruins of the pier and Pacific Ocean Park, the beginning of Jeff Ho Surfboards and Zephyr Productions surf shop and the beginning of the Zephyr Competition Team and how the paid competitions came between members of the group.  But most importantly showcasing the influence the Z-Boys made in skateboarding.

From their pool skating sessions and the group doing aerials to their involvement in professional skate competitions and more.  ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" featured a good number of archived footage from teenagers who wanted to become part of the Z-Boys group by filming and documenting the talented skaters and also featuring interviews with members of the Zephyr Competition Team.

The documentary was financed by Vans, Inc. with a $400,00 budget, the shoes that Stacy Peralta (director of the documentary and one of the popular members of the Zephyr Competition Team that became a professional, sponsored skateboarder) promoted back when he was as a pro skateboarder.  The documentary would feature a narration by award winning actor Sean Penn (""Fast Times at Ridgemont High"", ""Milk"", ""Deadman Walking"") and the DVD went on to sell over  a million copies and over 700,000 copies on VHS.

The story of the Z-Boys even inspired the making of the 2005 feature film ""Lords of Dogtown"" starring Heath Ledger, Emile Hirsch, John Robinson and Victor Rasuk, a film (that was inspired by actual events but dramatized for the big screen) that would spotlight the beginning and the end of the Zephyr skateboard team but how Tony Alva and Stacy Peralta went on to become successful in their own way .

With the popularity of ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" on VHS and DVD, the documentary now receives its HD release on Blu-ray.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is presented in 1080p High Definition (1:33:1) Full Screen.  It's important to emphasize that this documentary is not one to expect awesome picture quality.

For one, this documentary was created back in 2001 and footage featured ranges from the 1950's through the early 1980's and modern footage from 2001 (featured in black and white).  The documentary is in full screen, so you will see black bars at the sides.  Also, this documentary does bring out the noise and minimal dust and some artifacting from certain classic scenes.

But the excitement of this documentary release is watching it for the vintage footage of old school Venice, surfing crews and what took place at Jeff Ho's surf shop to old school footage of the skateboard team skating at their various school hangouts to skate or at the pool.  But also footage from skateboard competitions and more.

And I will say that the vintage footage does look much better on Blu-ray than on DVD.  There are quite a good number of classic footage that looks very good despite being shot on a home video camera in the mid-70's.

As for the audio, audio is presented in English 5.1 DTS-HD MA.  Dialogue is center channel driven and is clear while the front channels showcases classic rock music from Aerosmith, Led Zeppelin, the Jimi Hendrix Experience, David Bowie, the Stooges, Peter Frampton and more.

There is some use of the surround channels, may it be subtle sounds of waves or certain sound effects but this documentary is all about the dialogue and music and for the most part, lossless audio is quite satisfactory for this documentary.

Subtitles are provided in English, English SDH and Hindi.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" comes with the following special features featured in Standard and High Definition.  English Stereo and subtitles in English.  Included are:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is documentary that spotlights the Z-Boys aka the Zephyr team who literally revolutionized skateboarding with an aggressive in-your-face style that shredded the competition.  Growing up in the 1970's, the documentary is blessed with old school footage (that is great quality compared to many surfing films that came out in the early 90's) that I just kept repeating... ""sick"".

The documentary shows the kids skating as well as a few classic clips of other competitors of skateboarding in the 50's and 60's and how the Z-Boys just came in and shattered the image of what skateboarding was all about with their freestyle surfing way on a skateboard.  Also, footage of the group skating in emptied pools brought upon the California drought and how the friends became rivals as skateboard manufacturers started to offer contracts and get a hold of a Z-Boy and make money off them.  Naturally, the talents of the kids of that time earned them great money but not all were able to overcome the limelight that introduced a few to drugs and hard times.

From the awesome freestyle of Jay Adams, the competitor and uber talented Tony Alva (aka godfather of skateboarding) and talented Stacy Peralta (who gone on to create Powell-Peralta Skateboards, the Bones Brigade which led to some guy named Tony Hawk), we are reminded of what these three and other members of the Zephyr team brought to skateboarding.

My favorite part of the film which I can't stop watching is the 1975 Del Mar Invitational where people saw the Zephyr team debut and saw a new style that no one has seen before. What makes it even more exciting was the footage of the skateboarding competitors of that time and then the entrance of the Zephyr team and seeing how the competitors were frustrated by the Zephyr team.

That was a definite, classic moment in my opinion from yesteryear and to see the footage today is just incredible.  The documentary features awesome footage of the group and competitions combined with a cool soundtrack, cool interviews of most of the Zephyr Competition Team and a lot of cool, in-depth information of the past and what happened to the members of the team now.  Suffice to say that this film has done really well on the film festival circuit especially at Sundance and AFI and Stacy Peralta continues to show his talent as a director.

For the Blu-ray release of ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"", the HD version does make the vintage footage look much better but as mentioned, certain artifacts, dust and noise are also more evident as well.  But personally, when it comes to classic home video footage, you don't expect anything significant in picture quality and if anything, these classic moments are like a time capsule of that time and era.  Audio definitely benefits from the lossless audio soundtrack, so the classic music is much more defined.  And you get two Blu-ray exclusives with this latest release.

But assuming you owned the original DVD release and the deluxe edition, you may be wondering if it's all worth it to purchase all over again on Blu-ray.  For me, it is worth it because I enjoyed this documentary and if I can have the documentary with its best presentation video and audio-wise, for me... it's worth it.  Also, you do get two new special features but if you aren't the type who cares for special features or if you don't own a home theater system, then you're pretty much good with the original DVD release.

Overall, ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is one of my favorite documentaries that featured surf and skate culture of the 1970's and it captures a time and era featuring the Zephyr Competition Team who set the bar high for skateboarding at the time and also help create the synergy that would later become this big competitive sport and hobby that is today.

If you don't own it on DVD and have a Blu-ray player, ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is definitely worth catching on Blu-ray!",1262822400,3,10382,4.928078250863061

Dogtown and Z-Boys suffers from one of those names that screams ""amateur filmmaker"" to you. But when the amateur filmmaker is documenting a moment in history for which he was actually involved, he can be forgiven. Stacy Peralta was one of the members of the Zephyr skating team, the subject of the film, and Dogtown and Z-Boys was his attempt to document the time when skateboarding went from being something that amused junior high school kids with too much time on their hands to being a serious sport. The problem, of course, being that the natures of the members of the Zephyr team, not to mention its co-founders, wasn't exactly germane to the codification of, well, anything.

Los Angeles in the early seventies: poor, territorial surfers with a lot of time on their hands discover skateboards. Previously considered toys, skateboards seemed a natural extension of the surfers' ethic; an oblong board with which one could perform. The skateboard companies were in the midst of attempting to get skateboarding noticed and televised; teams were put together for competition purposes. Two surf shop owners decide to put together a team from the anarchic, dysfunctional Dogtown scene (of which film narrator Sean Penn was a minor member himself). The Dogtown kids, who eventually became known as the Z-Boys, stood in opposition in every way to the clean-cut teams of skateboarders usually seen in competitions--not only in their style (considered outrageous at the time, now almost stereotypical in period movies and the like of the ""seventies style""), but also in their ability. No one had ever considered doing things on skateboards that these kids were doing. They soon rocketed to the top of their game, but almost inevitably, the fame exacerbated existing problems, and everything exploded.

Peralta takes a straightforward, if understandably biased, approach to the subject matter, and his intimate knowledge of both the events and the motivations, stuff that no one outside the crew would have had access to, makes this a fascinating story, even for those of us who were never interested in skateboard culture. (I was a little punk like everyone else, but I barely have enough balance to ride a bike. Skateboard? Not on your life.) I don't think it even matters if you have any idea that Dogtown is a slang term for a part of LA, or who the Z-Boys were; you'll like this. ****",1248739200,,2427,5.002475247524752

Today it might not be much, everyone's skating everywhere and jumping off anything, but these guys would break the boards and tape them back together just to get another mile or so out of it.

1731652,5,B00006950U,"""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is a documentary on the Z-Boys of Venice, California from the tough Dogtown neighborhood.

  The Z-Boys aka the Zephyr team literally revolutionized skateboarding with an aggressive in-your-face style that shredded the competition.

  Growing up in the 1970's, the documentary is blessed with old school footage (that is great quality compared to many surfing films that came out in the early 90's) that I just kept repeating... ""sick"".

  The documentary shows the kids skating as well as a few classic clips of other competitors of skateboarding in the 50's and 60's and how the Z-Boys just came in and shattered the image of what skateboarding was all about with their freestyle surfing way on a skateboard.

  Also, footage of the group skating in emptied pools brought upon the California drought.

  Also, how the friends became rivals as skateboard manufacturers started to offer contracts and get a hold of a Z-Boy and make money off them.

  Naturally, the talents of the kids of that time earned them great money but not all were able to overcome the limelight that introduced a few to drugs and hard tmes.

  From the awesome freestyle of Jay Adams, the competitor and uber talented Tony Alva (aka godfather of skateboarding) and talented Stacy Peralta (who gone on to create Powell-Peralta Skateboards, the Bones Brigade which led to some guy named Tony Hawk), we are reminded of what these three and other members of the Zephyr team brought to skateboarding.

  My favorite part of the film which I can't stop watching is the 1975 Del Mar Invitational where people saw the Zephyr team debut and saw a new style that no one has seen before.  What makes it even more exciting was the footage of the skateboarding competitiors of that time and then the entrance of the Zephyr team and seeing how the competitors were frustrated by the Zephyr team.

  That was a definite, classic moment in my opinion from yesteryear and to see the footage today is just incredible.

  As for the video quality of this documentary, it was expected that certain footage (being very old) would be grainy and we would see some artifacts but a lot of those messes were cleaned up and look great on this DVD.

  As for the DVD, this is the second release of the DVD (Deluxe Edition) which features a sneak peak at the theatrical release of ""Lords of Dogtown"", two webisodes of ""Lords of Dogtown"", ""Alternate Ending"", Director and Editor commentary and extended raw footage.

  Footage includes Stacy Peralta visiting the original Zephyr store owner Jeff Ho shaping some surfboards in Hawaii and even Stacy Peralta and film crew skateboarding at an old Z-Boy hangout/skateboard spot.

  Awesome footage of the group and competitions combined with a cool soundtrack, cool interviews of most of Zephyr team and a lot of cool, in-depth information of the past and what happened to the members of the team now.

1731653,5,B00006950U,"As someone who grew up wanting to be a skater, was not very good, I remember reading about many of these guys and watching skate movies that featured several of them.  It was great to see how the whole movement came about.

I found it very interesting to see the areas of Venice and The Santa Monica Bay and what they looked like at that time.  I spent four summers lifeguarding Venice Beach in college and recognized alot of the locations or recall hearing about ""the old days"" from those that had worked the beach back then.

Stacy Peralta makes his mark as a legitimate film maker and documentarian with this film.  If you enjoy this type of film and have not yet seen Riding Giants, take the time and watch it.

1731655,4,B00006950U,"It's always great to watch something grow and evolve: just as baseball probably got started in backyards and parks many centuries ago, skateboarding has kick-started its' own ""learning curve"", and it seems to be a much faster pace than America's Favorite Sport.
The kids with a few bucks could buy (I hope) a nice plank of maple or oak...then fashion something funky for cement, asphalt, or what swimming pools are made of.
These young guys found a spot to enjoy themselves, to hone their craft, although I doubt they knew what ""hone"" meant or that they were initiating a new sport. (Which at its' best involved alot of skill, grace, and...rowdiness).
I can't call them ""working class"" heroes because in this film it seems that the only poeople with jobs are the surf-shop owners and the police.
There's a very telling image of a skateboarder circling some presumptive *private* swimming pool - there appears to be a combination of standing gray water standing and green slime. The dude falls right in.
Did he say....wow....that's a sign. I'm going for my GED. (Then I'll apply for a job as Swimming Pool Technician.....). Forgive my presumptuousness, but I doubt it.
They spend just a little too much time ""sidewalk [and private pool] surfin'"" back then - and it's not cool to tear up a tax-payers' private digs and make Police waste time on punks (with hearts of gold - threw that in).
Interviews with those who were there are professionally done; an interview with legendary Jay Adams, now in drug-related custody, is at once riveting and repelling. Interviews with those who got rich and famous are also well-done, particularly with the interviewee who affirmatively asserts that he was *there* when the name ""Dogtown"" was created.
It appears that one original skateboard icon has actually moved on to environmentally-positive endeavours: the healthiest, happiest appearing exponent of the 'boarding pre-history is a woman - can't say it was a ""sport formerly dominated by men"", as she had equal status as a founder.
Ex-skateboarder Sean Penn does a nice, mellow narration - an adroit approach considering that the sport basically is a quiet one.
The actual footage appears to be all Super-8, so we have that ""home movie"" feel which nicely complements the high-tech. quality of the contemporary footage of the stars.

While neither the technical and historical details of skating nor the personal stories of the participants are given short shrift, the focus is on the passion of the skaters and the camaraderie of their team. The result is a story anyone can relate to and enjoy. But, while the film benefits from the unique perspective of the director and writers, the film never directly addresses the dilemmas of making a documentary about oneself. Although the director and writers appear on camera throughout the film, and the subjects often address them directly during interviews, the viewer is left to figure that out on their own and wonder about their objectivity. Nevertheless, this is a unique film that is well worth watching.",1185926400,,958,5.147435897435898
1731660,4,B00006950U,"I remember my first skateboard.  Odd, this is probably how every other review for this film probably goes, but being as I seem to watch quite a bit of clich ridden drama these days, why not begin with this very simple memory.  It was the summer of 1986, I was eight years old, my younger brother was six.  Our grandparents found this board in their basement, possibly my mothers or fathers, and decided it was our time to feel the harsh times of the pavement.  The board was nothing spectacular, a ""Bun Buster"" I believe, and it provided hours upon hours of scrapes, scuffs, and thankfully no broken bones as we sailed down the hills of Virginia.  It was something that I believe my brother continued with, but I just never found it to stick.  I pursued other hobbies, but I will always remember this little piece of wood with probably clay wheels that gave us the war wounds of life.  Now, 29-years old, I had the opportunity to see where my fascination with this semi-sport (now full-fledged) arrived.  While I have to admit that it took a second viewing with the audio commentary blasting through my ears to fully appreciate the film, I have to stand and applaud what these teens endured to raise the stakes, but go above the clich of the average sports star.

I hate films about sports.  I guess the pre-fabricated Hollywood sports film is a bit tough for me to swallow because it follows the most identical of ideas each year, what I am trying to say is that there isn't much creativity in this genre.  Use exhibit ""A"" - ""The Game Plan"" as evidence of this if you want.  So, needless to say, I was hesitant to watch this documentary because of the sports theme element, but at the same time I couldn't wait because I love surfing documentaries like ""Step into Liquid"" and ""Billabong Odyssey"".  I took a step, I plunged into the unknown, and to be honest, at first I wasn't happy.  I didn't like the direction, the people, or the style that the film encompassed to present these young sport entrepreneurs.  With my first viewing, I thought that history couldn't be fully recorded, so I thought Stacy Peralta was splicing stock footage with faux-actors acting like they were from the late 70s.  The music was intense, it matched well Peralta had made a mixed tape from this generation for our enjoyment, but the visuals were anything but stimulating.  The elongated scenes, while using amazing music to support, just seemed flushed and too long for my attention.  I wanted to get to know the pioneers, not just watch them skate for ten minutes in an empty pool.  I wanted a combination of who these kids were, where they went during their rise of fame, and where they are now.  It felt like I was watching the birth of our nation with a great score to the settlers just rowing their boats all day.  I wanted to know the men behind the myths.

Then, with a thought that I would have another negative review under my belt, I watched the film again with Peralta's audio commentary.  His passion, his voice, his knowledge of the people and what he had to do to get this film accomplished ""wow-ed"" me.  This suddenly transformed into the film I wanted to see.  Peralta lets us know more of where these kids are today, what they are still doing, and how difficult it was to get some of them onto the camera.  He hadn't seen many of them in 20+ years, so to hear these challenges brought the human element back to the surface.  He was sincere; he was sympathetic, yet he showed so much dedication to this project.  While I do not agree with everything that he chose to do (i.e. the Sean Penn mess up is not PUNK ROCK), he revitalized this film for me.  It was due to this commentary that I rate this film much higher than originally thought.

Jay Adams.  Tony Alva.  Jeff Ho.  Peggy Oki.  Wentzle Ruml.  These are just a few of the name that need to be mentioned, and continually praised, if skateboarding is to continue the fast growing trend that it currently sees.  While Tony Hawk's name sells products, it is these guys, these mild-mannered pavement slackers that redefined an entire sport.  Sure, others were probably doing it in the stone ages, but these guys did it with style, grace, and moved it to the next level.  This was a hobby for them, but it also propelled them in a direction I believe none of them were ready for.  ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is the story of evolution, being in the right place at the right time, living in a generation without televisions to keep us planted, and about friendship.  We have seen so many stories during the years that show the progression of humanity, and this is definitely a story that should be added to that.  I cannot say that I loved this film, nor will I, but it should be standard viewing for everyone learning or wanting to experience the growth of the skateboarding trend.  It was sad, it was emotional, and these guys aren't multi-millionaires over again - they are people with a passion, and very rarely do you see that in documentaries.

Overall, I cannot watch this film again, but I will suggest it to friends and family time after time.  I think the downfall for this film, to me, was the filming - the attempts to be avant-garde with the style, which ultimately drew away from the characters and events.  As mentioned before, there were some elements that dragged on too much, which left us with little to no time to know where these guys were now.  Peralta obviously had a passion for this sport, for the people, but he seemed out-of-focus at times.  The music was intense, and worked perfectly with the film.  Sean Penn, while he was decent with his voiceover, wasn't needed at all.  They could have spent the money elsewhere.  On the positive, the audio commentary captures everything that the regular film was missing.  Peralta's voice, instead of Penn's, brings a stronger human element to the scene, while he tells us better stories of the people, places, and events.  Watch this film, but don't expect to be blown away.  Listen to the audio commentary; I think you will be impressed.

The footage of them entering their first competition and blowing everybody away--all the square, geeky kids with their silly tricks getting smoked by a bunch of long-haired surf-rat kids.  Priceless.

""Dogtown and Z-boys"" is the documentary version of ""The Lords of Dogtown,"" or I guess it'd be better to say that ""The Lords of Dogtown"" is the non-documentary version of this movie. It's about the little band of boys (which included a couple of girls) in the 1970s who basically invented the sport of skateboarding as we know it. Calling it a sport is a bit of a misnomer. It's competitive, but it's not ultimately about winning, but like surfing, it's about the beauty of human skill--or the skill of creating beauty or the beauty of skillfully and creatively interacting with the earth. For the Z-boys, a skateboard was a way to surf when there weren't any waves. They had a lot of free time on their hands, and there was a big drought in Southern Cal, so they roamed the neighborhood looking for empty swimming pools to skate in. Concrete waves.

One of my favorite parts of the DVD is a clip of some of these guys going back to skate at a schoolyard where it all started (it's in the special features). One reason I liked this is that they're all about my age, a bunch of forty-something guys, balding and grey. But they still had the moves; their bodies had them memorized.

It's a great example of the concept of indwelling, developed by philosopher Michael Polanyi (maybe I should apologize for bringing up a little-known philosopher in a review of a skater movie, but his work really helps me understand and appreciate what these guys did). After lots and lots of practice, the highly skilled skater focusses on the move he's trying to pull off and almost no direct attention to the details of how he does it. In his consciousness, the skateboard is part of him--he indwells it. Polanyi also showed that freedom and community are critical factors in the process of discovery. This bunch of kids had lots of both. Minimal adult supervision had some bad consequences, too, but these guys shifted the skateboard paradigm. You might say it's a life wasted on trivia, but I think the skill and physical grace they demonstrate is a work of art.

Perralta attempts to show a ""warts and all"" portrait of he and his group. While there may be ""sins of the past' that remain out of the camera's view, these are secondary to the wider scope of the film.

DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS focuses on the history of skateboarding, from its surf board origins to its explosive rebirth in the mid-70s. Perralta (co-founder of skateboarding company Powell-Perralta) and his hometown cronies comprised ""Team Zephyr"" and helped revolutionize the ""sport"" of skateboarding. Told in vignettes scored with an incredible soundtrack of guitar rock (the music rights probably quintupled the flick's budget), DOGTOWN AND Z-BOYS occasionally resembles a bigger budget ""Bones Brigade"" video. The form lends itself to fleshed-out chapters of information along with occasional skate breaks that highlight the poetry of the sport.

The skating speaks for itself and calls attention to the narration of Sean Penn who trips over the overwrought prose of writer Craig Stecyk. Far too often, Penn sounds like he's reading his Ninth Grade term paper on skateboarding.

Perralta's film moves at a good clip, only bogging down towards the end with long-winded vignettes focusing on he and two of his other Dogtown chums.

1731676,4,B00006950U,"If your kid is a total loser and headed for prison, it could be because you bought him that skateboard last year. This is a loser subculture if there ever was one, and this film does a great job of explaining why. Here we are in ""gritty"" Venice, California, back when a modest home was actually available for less than half a million bucks. We have a bunch of Timmie-from-Lassie kids who are surfers. They all come from broken homes and their moms, who are all waitresses, turn tricks at the Motel 6 if their tips don't make the nut for the day's drugs. The kids are befriended by a surf shop owner who sponsors them. Amazingly, he is not a chicken hawk. The surfer xenophobia toward anybody who is not from their neighborhood is trumpeted as a virtue. But since the surf blows out around ten in the morning, the kids have to find something else to do. Fortunately, some other kids who studied in school and made themselves useful to society invented polyurethane skateboard wheels so skating can become a mass-market phenomenon and skateboards can be sold at K-Mart instead of just gritty little surf shops on the beach. The kids imitate a Hawaiian surfer, who they'd probably bomb with bricks and broken glass if he tried to surf their miserable beach break. This imitation creates a whole new style that has defined skating for the world's youth. Fortunately, there was an older guy named Friedman hanging around to see if he couldn't make some money off this whole deal. The kids end up the stars of Surfer Magaine's skateboard publication and pretty soon skateboards are big again. Along come some guys with big bucks and the kids desert the humble board shaper who gave them flight. His shop goes bust and he has to get on welfare. The kids start bringing home big bucks. One day they discover skating in empty swimming pools, which is a direct result of the drought in California. They cruise around in seedy quasi-suburban neighborhoods looking for pools to drain. Then they find a rich kid who is dying of brain cancer and his dad drains their pool so the gritty Timmies can skate. The film does not show the kid with the brain cancer. I don't know what it is with surfer films, but those guys sure love to go on and on about themselves. It's like they think the longer they can make the film the more money they'll be making off it.

I confess, this could be a decent film if these guys knew how to edit. They have enough old footage from the 70s, thanks to the fact that Friedman and another Jewish guy were hanging around to cash in on the fad. But it's way too long and these guys, as skaters tend to be, are really full of themselves. They need to get out in the world a little.

1731680,4,B00006950U,"For the record, I have been on a skateboard.  I have not done anything that would remotely be considered riding a skateboard, but at some point in the past I have stood on one and tried to maintain my balance.  So when even when they talk about the first generation of skateboarders who simply navigated slalom courses such things are way beyond me and when we get to what the Z-Boys are doing in Dogtown we are no longer talking people who live on the same planet as I do.  Even if the Z-Boys are tooting their own horns, it seems pretty clear that everybody else in their world thinks they have plenty to be arrogant about, both then and now.

""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is a 2001 documentary directed by Stacy Peralta, who is not only one of the original Z-Boys but also the writer of the screenplay for ""Lords of Dogtown"" (Peralta co-writes this documentary with photo-journalist Craig Stecyk, whose Dogtown articles in ""Skateboarding"" magazine were seminal in creating the Z-Boy legend).  In point of fact, I checked out this documentary because I am tired of just watching trailers for that film and if it came here I must have blinked and missed it.  That movie comes out on DVD in October, so I checked out this documentary instead.  Basically what we have here is not only the stories of these legendary skateboarders and the fame and fortune that they found, to varying degrees, but the history of how skateboarding became the cutting edge of the extreme sports movement that now sees X-Games and X-sports at the Olympics.

One of the strengths of this documentary is that you understand exactly the four things that came together to make skateboarding what is was because of these kids in the beachfront slum located between Santa Monica and Venice in California.  First, these kids were surfers, but the reality is that you cannot surf all day, so you have to find something else to do, which is what gets you to skateboards as basically little surf boards on wheels.  Second, you have the invention of urethane wheels for skateboards, replacing the clay ones appropriated from regular skates, which makes a complete difference in terms of being able to ride your board.  Third, you have the element of thrill seeking that comes not from surfing in general but surfing in that particular neighborhood, where surfers do in and around the burned out piers.  If you risk banging your head and drowning to get your kicks, then skating on concrete does not exactly pale in comparison.  Finally, the California drought of the late 1970s stopped the people of Los Angeles from drinking water in restaurants, watering their lawns, and keeping their pools full.  These empty L.A. pools are where skateboarding really takes off because this is what introduces the vertical into the equation.  At first the goal is simply to ride your skateboard above the light in the pool, then to side up so only one wheel is on the rim, and then we get eventually and logically to a complete takeoff.

For me the history of the sport and how the Z-boys (named for the Zephyr surfer shop run by Skip Engblom and Jeff Ho) ended up on the cutting edge is more interesting than the individual stories.  First Tony Alva is the greatest skateboarder in the world and then maybe it is Stacy Peralta because of his self-promotion, but probably Jay Adams was the best of them all.  The problem is that they all look pretty good to me, and Peralta's documentary works mainly because in addition to the talking heads of the 40-year-old Z-Boys today he has home movies of these skaters in their glory days.  I understand that demigods like Tony Hawk consider the Z-Boys to be the Olympians or yore, but I really do not have any appreciation for why Alva and Adams are way better than Zephyr teammates Bob Biniak or Paul Constantineau any more than I understand why 70's skateboard champion David Hackett is on a lower rung in the pantheon.  I wonder if ""Lords of Dogtown"" will manage to make such distinctions clearer to me when this documentary could not, but I know already that the film will not give me the understanding of the history of the sport that I get from ""Dogtown and Z-Boys.""",1123632000,5,4160,4.6726027397260275

If you pre-date `Dogtown Z-boy' period and were involved in lets say conventional sports. Then you might just pick up on Peralta's central theme in the movie, that `We set the stage for the future of extreme sports'.  Although never a skater, I tend to agree and here's why.

Check out the scenes of the revived Delmar event.  Notice the competition, they were athletes 1st, and skaters second, e.g., handstands, gymnastic moves etc.  Were they good, talented?  Sure but they were acrobatic and there is nothing new about acrobatics other than the equipment used.

Then along comes the Z-boys with a unique, spontaneous (out of the box) style.  Were Z-boys the best?  Maybe not but they put something on the map that was not there before and has since changed the face of sports.  I keep this in mind when enjoying the modern X-Games, surfing etc. the EXTREME stuff.  And ponder, how did they get there?",1118016000,4,1040,4.617486338797814

1731685,3,B00006950U,"...these guys are so full of themselves.  They were profiled in magazines and the like because of luck, they were in the right place at the right time.  They were by no means the only pioneers of the pool and the pipe.  In Topanga Canyon we were riding in pools and pipes with skateboards and bicycles at exactly the same time.  The mid-seventies water shortages in Southern California created wide-spread creativity among much of the youth.  So they were all tough guy surfers?  Well, come on now, didn't every hot surf spot have local rules in those days?  Sure we heard of these guys, but only in passing.  What we were doing was just having a good time.  To make it more then that is a big mistake.  As one reviewer wrote, ""I have never seen a group of people who felt more self-important about something that is so unimportant.""  I couldn't agree more, a little more humility would have gone a long way.  Unlike many of the rest of us, these guys did actually have some organization.  The whole team thing reminded me of the horrible 1977 flick  ""Skateboard"" with Leif Garrett playing the Tony Alva part.  It was kind of a joke really --organized skateboard rebels?  c'mon you guys were no different then any other teen in the seventies.  Seeing that Tony is still hanging on to the skater image in the extra sceens was kinda sad.

All that said it is a fun little romp down memory lane for those of us who grew up in the region during the seventies.

Here you get the unvarnished impressions of the motherf*#!ers of invention themselves, exploiting every school yard and swimming pool in their immediate vicinity to give skateboarding a whole new look and feel.

Stacy Peralta captures the energy of the Z-Boys and how they rise to fame and in some cases fortune by turning this kids' sports into one of the great extreme sports of the 90's.  Like ""Riding Giants,"" Peralta has fun piecing together the history and breakthroughs of the sport with a lot of personal interviews with the original Z-Boys.  It pretty much ignores everything else that was going on in skateboarding at the time, but no matter, these guys were the top dogs, launching onto the scene in Skateboarding magazine, thanks to the gonzo style approach of Craig Steyck.

1731693,5,B00006950U,"I'm not a skateboarder--I never have been. So my review of this film is from a truly ""outsider"" position. I'll skip making comments about the wonderful aspects of this film as a documentary about skateboarding, because to me what makes this a truly remarkable work of art has to do with being a documentary about life and truth and beauty and all that.
This movie is about hope. It paints a picture of young kids growing up in an incredibly harsh environment (the film goes out of its way to portray Venice of the early '70's in practically post-apocalyptic images) who see in the concrete wasteland nothing but ocean waves of endless promise. They craft, as artists, a new ballet amidst the rubble. They are obsessed with skating the perfect run, not necessarily to be better than their friends, but just for the sake of perfection. In this pursuit of perfection, I see hope. I see a vision of a recreated world where there are no barriers based on class or empty swimming pools surrounded by fences and patrolled by police. But there's also an irony in the hope, in that the Zephyr boys have an exclusivity about them--they are fiercely elite in their rejection of conventionality.
The story of one of the top two skateboarders, Jay Adams, provides the heart to this film. His story provides a balance to the narrative of corporate greed, which ultimately destroyed the Zephyr team (but which also made the film possible and the story relevent). He is shown as a very young and, though violent and utterly contemptous, innocent boy oozing with natural talent. He's interviewed several times as an adult who, we find out, is doing time for heroin-related charges in Hawaii. Next to the brilliance of the Jay Adams the boy, in Jay Adams the man we see a dark shell of regret and pain. His fellow riders lament the fact that Jay's life is so tragic and unfair--there's a sense of complete injustice ""he should have had it all"" ""Jay's had the hardest life of anyone I know who's still alive"" ""you only get one shot at this...once it's gone it's gone."" So within this movie about beauty and hope, we meet Jay Adams and see tragedy and injustice. There's an absolutely beautiful and haunting scene at the end of the Jay Adams excurses in which the beautiful young Jay, maybe 12 years old, with long sun-bleached hair, is skating in an empty pool and falls on his way down one side. His board continues through the bottom of the pool, up the other side, and straight up into the air about 10 or 15 feet. The scene is in slow motion and freezes the board mid-air. Then, there's a fade to a still of Jay at about 25 years old holding a picture of himself as a cute, innocent boy of about 7. Then another fade to Jay as a hard, broken man in his 30's, with a crew but, what seems to be a black eye and bruised nose, and tattoos running up his throat. Eyes like empty holes. This is the filmmaker's art at its finest. A scene like this says so much more than words ever could.
Some of the reviews on this film have complained that the film was too short--that it left too many questions unanswered. I couldn't disagree more. This film is all about the questions, not the answers. As a Christian, I see this film as a commentary on humanity and our longing for beauty--our hope for a future that includes a recreated world where architecture is no longer purely utilitarian, where there are no longer divisions between north Malibu and the southern beaches. Where everyone has access to a perfect wave. A future in which greed no longer robs us of our innocence, and Jay Adams is once again that strikingly charismatic and beautiful blond-headed boy writing profound poetry with his skateboard, poetry that destroys the walls of violence and drugs and elitism, that opens his soul to ours and ours to him. In the words of U2, a future ""where the streets have no name."" Our souls groan for a better place, and this film captures that emotion as well as any I've ever seen.

1731697,5,B00006950U,"This is an exceptional documentary of a group of guys in blue-collar south Venice Beach, CA that revolutionized skateboarding.  As a 50 year old who grew up in Southern California in the mid-60s skateboarding in the ""uncool"" manner that they portrayed in the first skateboard tournament, I was absolutely mesmerized by the evolution to vertical skateboarder, ie, ""airtime"".
This film narrated by Sean Penn interviews the members of the Zephyr Surf Shop skateboarding team from the 70s.  Sean Penn does an excellent job as voice over and the teammates and shop owners are very honest and forthright in sharing the evolution through the skateboarding where they were first seen, to the urban guerilla boarding in empty swimming pools, to skateboard stardom, and finally to grown-ups.
Many reviewers mention the braggadocio of the participants since the director was also a Z-Boy.  Also many complained that they were just a bunch of skateboarders.  But I didn't view it that way at all.  I found their reporting to be very balanced and in fact, I thought the director somewhat downplayed his stature in the skateboarding world vs. say, Tony Alva.  Also as a former skateboarder of a previous generation, I found it absolutely fascinating watching the evolution of the sport.  Whether true or not, following that evolution to airborne makes fascinating history.  Now, skateboard/wakeboard/surfing/in-line skating have merged into extreme sports.  Did these guys invent it? Of course not.  But they were substantial in its evolution.

When it did finally come to my town, I dragged my husband to it; it certainly confused him, seeing his 39 year old computer nerd wife turn into a teen age skate rat overnight!
In my mispent youth, I lived about 20 miles south of Dogtown & idolized Tony Alva. I had his magazine shots covering my walls; I memorized every issue of Skateboarder when it arrived in my mailbox. I also spent every available moment gonzoing the local hilly streets with my friends. As soon as I was old enough to get my own place, where did I move to? You guessed it, Dogtown. I don't talk much about those days now, or at least I didn't until DOGTOWN & Z-BOYS came out.
This movie is wonderful. It really captures what that time felt like, when skateboarding was still closely allied to surfing & just finding it's own identity. The archival footage is amazing, especially the P.O.P. sequence, & the early shots of the Z-Boys at Paul Revere & Bellagio. The editing is brilliant, & the music rocks! What is truly remarkable is that it manages to make skateboarding accessible & enjoyable to those who never participated, such as my husband. He's just as blown away at some of the footage as I was.
The DVD transfer is great. It's nice to be able to slow down some of the sections, or freeze a frame to get a better look, or just repeat your fave sections over & over again. The voice-over commentary by Peralta on the bonus track adds many anecdotes that had to be left out of the film, as well as giving credit to many of the people who contributed footage the documentary relies heavily on. There's also an additional, uncut film of today's Tony A during a pool session, which is nice to see.
The only reason this film doesn't get 5 stars is because of some of the people it left out. Where's Tom Inouye, of the notorious Inouye's Pool Service? When it came to outlaw pool-finding, Tom was the man! Laura Thornhill was probably the only other hard-core girl who got attention at the time; she's completely unmentioned. Although Stacy Peralta gets his props for modesty, he sometimes errs on the side of being TOO modest; there was a spectacular Arizona Pipe session I recall that goes unmentioned, one that Stacy made history at. It would have been nice to see some of that footage too.
All in all, Dogtown & Z-Boys can't be beat if you remember those days. If you're at the age where all this is new to you, it's a great way to learn where all those moves you're busting came from.

This documentary is not just for skaters; anyone interested in the forgotten but influential events in history would like this film.
What these guys did in the world of early skateboarding is on the same level as the way the Fosbury Flop changed the high-jump in track and field, but even bigger because it was part of a cutural revolution that gave rise to a whole new genre of sport.  Once the cat was out of the bag, the world could never go back.  Equally important was the early promotion of the sport and the lifestyle, of which the writer/director was an early pioneer. He was also a member of the Z-boys, which provides a perspective that no one else could deliver.

This film allows those folks, who grew up in this era, and equally loved to skate, relive the reasons that drew them to skating in the first place. To see someone's eyes light up, and catch a glimpse of the sparkle in them, that this awesome sport incites is really beautiful to behold.  And the movie definately shows we ""non-skaters"" why these guys have so much love for their boards!  The movie truly is a work of art, beautifully filmed, with actual footage from the era, still photograghy that any world-reknowned photgragher would envy....watching it will make you want to go and grab a board and at least TRY and feel the love!!  I just had tickets to Tony Hawk's Boom-Boom Huck Jam exhibition, and seeing this film, showed me he may be the Michael Jordan of the skate world, but he is simply carrying the torch, in a sport where it's founding fathers were all plain old kids from middle-class neighborhoods, who loved something enough, to  help turn the sport  into what it is today!!!!

So, I got up, and went out to watch this documentary. I came of age - on the East Coast - during the 70's. I have to admit, I was a party girl, running with the boys - and knew nothing of stakeboarding. Yet, the ZBoys soundtrack was the background to my life in the early 70's. I was fascinated by their absolute lack of fear. Watching Jay Adams take that road with no helmet at 70 mph took my breath away. This movie celebrates that very special time in life, and the Zboys,and the soundtrack did it proud. Loved this flick and am really looking forward to the Lords of Dogtown.

1731706,5,B00006950U,"Almost 30 years before the world had heard of Tony Hawk, three-sixties, or even Jackass, there was a place called Dogtown, a singed wasteland of ruin in Venice, California where a then overlooked group of rebellious youthful outsiders shared one passion...Skateboarding.
Spearheaded by the unbelievable skating prowess of Tony Alva, Jay Adams, and Stacy Peralta (who also serves as director here), the Zephyr Team would go on to revolutionize the world of skateboarding in only a few short years, and bring what was once a passing trend into a national, and inevitably commercialized obsession.
""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" passionately chronicles the skyrocket rise and subsequent fame of the Zephyr Team, particularly Alva and Adams with remarkable freshness and purpose. Rare and raw footage and pictures of the infamous Z-Boys blazing the asphalt and riding the dry-bone swimming pools of the early 70's is art in itself creating gripping visual moments set against a
soundtrack courtesey of Hendrix, Pink Floyd, Blue Oyster Cult, and Led Zeppelin, just to name a few. In any case, it's hardcore...a hardcore documentary experience that effortlessly recaptures a fleeting moment in history that will never be repeated, when a group of no-account skateboard outlaws rewrote the rules of the game and changed the way the skateboard was ridden forever.
Clever, engaging, and purposeful in its storytelling, ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is a fascinating documentary, and certainly worth checking out.",1057104000,21,1484,5.428571428571429

1731708,5,B00006950U,"Most people know the name Tony Hawk today.  He has his own series of incredibly successful video games (Tony Hawk's Pro Skater).  Other X-Games superstars are also well known and have their own games and are nationally recognized (Kelly Slater, Matt Hoffman, etc).  Snowboarding is an Olympic sport.  Skateboarding is at an incredible level of popularity.  Skateboarding today is alive because of a group from the Dogtown neighborhood of Venice, CA.  This group was called the Z-Boys.  The Z-Boys were from the Zephyr competition team.  They were first an elite group of surfers who only started skating when the ocean didn't have the waves for surfing.  The Z-Boys ended up helping propel skateboarding to new levels of popularity.
Dogtown and Z-Boys is a documentary and it deals with how they got started in skating (and surfing, because it is relevant to the skating) and about the impact that they had in the skate world.  The Z-Boys created new moves that would set the standard for what it means to skate.  They began by using what they did in surfing and emulated top surfers, but when California had a huge drought, they started skating in dried out pools (often without permission).  This led to the beginnings of vert skating, and had the Z-Boys not skated in pools, perhaps the style of skating today would not even exist (vert ramps did not exist when the Z-Boys were skating pools).  They were testing the limits of what was possible in skating and with each passing day they discovered that more and more was possible.  The Z-Boys made it to the top of the skating world, and they inspired new generations of skaters.  This is their story.
I had never heard of the Z-Boys until this documentary came out and the most I knew of skating was that I couldn't skate, and whatever I learned from the Tony Hawk video games.  It would be hard to believe the influence that these skaters had on the skate world if not for today's influential skaters (Hawk, Burnquist, etc) also talking about how they were influenced by the Z-Boys.

The film turned out to be much more than just a piece about '70s Southern California nostalgia. Instead it is a fascinating story about how a group of kids from a low income, L.A. neighborhood graduated from surfing to skateboarding and became the legendary Zephyrs(or Z-Boys) skateboarding team. Using urban guerilla tactics, they created a style and attitude, that revolutionized the sport and made it, what it is today. The film shows how many of these kids (including Tony Alva) went on to a superstar status within the sport. Director, Stacy Peralta has done a wonderful job of telling this story, through the use of recent interviews, beautiful still photography and tons of actual archival footage from that period. You will be amazed as you watch the film footage of these skateboarders as they seem to defy both physics and gravity in an aggressive style that is like poetry in motion. Also, listen for a great classic rock soundtrack (everything from Jimi Hendrix to Pink Floyd to Black Sabbath) that recalls the era.

1731717,5,B00006950U,"The first time I saw this amazing documentary was when the punky types on the night shift at my local video hut were watching a bootleg VHS copy a few months before the video actually came out.  Nearly every customer in the store craned their necks up towards the screen, and sat transfixed, watching the history of modern skateboarding unfold onscreen.  [Note to self: if it was that absorbing in the video store, be sure to get it when it comes out!]
""Dogtown And Z-Boys"" is a thoroughly engaging, well-produced film which recalls the dim, pre-punk origins of the skateboarding scene that came out of LA in the 1970s and has grabbed hold of antisocial daredevil types across the world ever since.  I was transfixed by this film, from beginning to end, and found there wasn't a dull moment or false note in the entire production.  I should hasten to add that I have never been much of a skateboarding fan; when I moved to Berkeley in the mid-1980s, skateboarding was already firmly identified with punk rock rebelliousness, with swarms of leather- and denim-clad losers barrelling down the sidewalks at top speed, tediously intent on messing with the minds of all the uptight squares who dared to be less cool than they were.  As a punk rock fan who prefers walking to knocking others off the sidewalk, I intensely dislike the culture of show-offy, in-your-face self-centeredness and machismo that skateboarders have adopted; in the 1990s, when the scene went mainstream and became commercialized as an ""extreme"" sport, it became even that much more tedious and trivial.  But this film shows where it all started, with a motley bunch of scruffy teenage Santa Monica beach bums who took the elegance and attitude of the world's best surfers and adapted it to the humble (and then quite primitive) skateboard.  The documentary appealed to me both aesthetically and personally -- the Dog Town skateboarders were all undeniably hella cool, and their story is pretty amazing.  Also, I remember having the same sort of restlessness and rebelliousness during the post-hippie, pre-punk years of my adolescence, and watching the old footage of the Dog Town crew, I was powerfully reminded of my own proud years as a 1970s juvenile delinquent.  The film's tone rang true, which isn't surprising since it was produced by guys who were part of the original Z-Boys clique.  It's a captivating, funny, stylish and very creative film, which exhalts a sexy urban subculture without exploiting its subjects or leaving out any members of the audience who might not skate themselves.  Great soundtrack, too.  A+ all the way around.",1041465600,6,2613,4.954233409610984

There is some great footage and information I had never heard before. The Z Boys pushed the envelope building a base for future skaters to emulate and expand on. The Z Boys skated because they loved to do it and it is absurd to state that they weren't as talented as skaters who came after them. The skaters of the 80's to the present have the Z Boys to thank for bringing skateboarding back into the the limelight. In every area, there are people who came before who helped carve the way. In climbing it was Hillary. In Jazz, it was John Coltrane. Sure skateboarding was a subculture and the Z-Boys were misfits but that should not detract from the contributions they made to skateboarding.",1037491200,,836,4.58
1731720,4,B00006950U,"I'm a teacher at college in Japan; I'm no skateborder, and will never be.  I bought this video simply because one of students in my English class said how cool the film was, and I just checked it out to see if I can use the film in my class.  The result turned out more engaging than I expected, and ""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" is pretty awesome documentary for those who are interested in the hot summer of 1970s.
""Dogtown"" follows the rise of local youth, hanging around the beach of Santa Monica in the 70s.  Around that time, once prospered amusement park by the seaside had been long deserted, and the seaside area had become a place for local surfers.  They made the rule of ""only locals"" which means, you cannot mess around the place, just coming from outside the town.
And after their dangerously exciting surfing in the sea (among the ruined piles), they spent time doing another thing: skateboarding.  While doing that for fun, they gradually developed the style, making it their own.  Finally, taking advantage of unused swimming pools (that means, trespassing, of course), the boys (though, actually, the original members include a girl) went on to set a new style, using the edge of the pool, which, according to the film, led to today's vertical ride of skateboarding.  They become famous; they become cultural icons.  (One of them appears as a cameo in original TV series ""Charlie's Angels"" as, who else, a skateboarder; this brief scene is also included in the film.)  In short, they set the style.
You must face it; the film sounds like self-advertizing at times.  But still, ""Z-Boys"" gives very interesting information on skateboarding, which by the end of the 20th century has become one of the independent category of sports (you will see, for instance, the difference between skateboarding in Jan and Dean era, and the Boys' own style).  The original skatebording footages are also noteworthy, which, with all its faded color and shaky camerawork, telescope the free spirits of the 70s into the exciting moments of their skateboarding practice or contests.
The film is also unusual in that the director himself appears before the camera, giving his own interview of the film.  This kind of attitude would invite criticism of the film's taking unbalanced view.  But they somehow get away with it, probably because it is clear that they love the sports, and really want to say something about it.
""Dogtown and Z-Boys"" lets you look at the world of street culture of the 70s West Coast in a quite unique way, and anyone who is interested in this sort of thing should watch it, whether or not he/she has ever experienced skateboarding.  The film ends with the reports of the original members' life today, many of whom seem to have settled down, and leading a family life.  That is most interesting, you might say.
Sean Penn (who was one of the fans of the ""Boys"") provides narration, but I wish he too gave his own account of the boys.  And it seems some part of the film is missing -- I want to know whether or not they ever got injured; what they were doing in the 80s and 90s, and so on, but perhaps it is not our business after all.  Still, I enjoyed watching the film.",1037232000,,3183,4.665474060822898
1731721,3,B00006950U,"Not so much about skateboarding but rather the entertaining humans loosely attached to the boards, DOG TOWN AND THE Z-BOYS was an  audience favorite and winner at Sundance and AFI film fests. Sean Penn is the perfect narrator for skateboarding legend Stacey Peralta's true story about a gang of discarded Venice (CA) kids who revolutionized skateboarding and transformed the culture.  In the late 60s and early 70s, skateboarding had gone the way of the Hula-Hoop. And then polyurethane wheels, hi-tech bearings, custom trucks and laminated, curved, surfboard-shaped platforms were custom rigged. And the sport exploded with an aggressive style, awe inspiring moves and intimidating, sometimes cynical, street smarts.  This is an affectionate, irreverent look back by the guys who lived and loved it.  FRUIT OF THE VINE is an even better film, also nominally about skateboarding. This wonderful vintage footage, shot on Super-8 is dirty, raw, disrespectful and anarchic.  At its heart, it's about breaking into private property, cleaning out refuse-filled but otherwise empty swimming pools, and using the tempting concave shells for practicing blissful wall-riding stunts that often end in bone crunching crashes and torn flesh. It's very tribal: enemy territory is claimed and marked, then daring tests of manhood, repetitive, almost trance-inducing coming of age rituals are performed that inevitably involve blood-letting.

The side of skateboarding it shows is not meant to wow audiences used to the likes of Tony Hawk and other modern skaters.  These guys weren't amazing because they could get huge air on a halfpipe or ollie over a ledge.  They were amazing because they basically created skateboarding, as well as the culture and additudes associated with it.  The idea that something is not an important first because someone ""would have done it first"" or isn't an inspiration for later extreme sports because they ""would have been created anyway"" is one of the most illogical and nonsensical claims one could make.  The fact is, these guys infuenced underground culture in a MAJOR way, and this extremely well made documentary demonstrates this fact with style, humor, and an excellent sense of what constitutes an interesting and original documentary.

Watching the Z-Boys from my era (the 80's -90's) the Bones Brigade sparked my curiosity in discovering who influenced them. I've heard so many stories now over the years from the older skaters about how the Dogtown skate team changed our world. I read articles and saw photos. But never was able to witness first-hand what was taking place at that time. This documentary is one of the rawest compilations of footage that I've ever seen. Sure, It may be self-congratulatory. But I don't think anyone else besides the actual Dogtown team could actually convey the story more effectively. Words can't explain how beautiful this documentary is. It covers the foundation of modern-day skateboarding beginning with the aggressive so-cal 70's Zephyr surf team weaving in and out of Piers and metal wreckage. To the birth of modern day vertical skateboarding and early street skating, which clearly mimicked the popular 70's surfers individual styles. This movie displays how a once decayed sport such as skateboarding was rejuvenated in the 70's by a group of young teens. But most importantly this is an outstanding educational tool intended for those who skate and those who don't skate. From a skateboarding standpoint this documentary will show you that the trick necessarily doesn't make the man, but style will ultimately separate you from the rest. Style and individualism is something that is almost extinct today amongst skaters. Hopefully a film of this magnitude can save the actual soul of skateboarding. Kids with Eric Koston, Jaime Thomas, and Stevie Williams posters on their wall need to actually view the talent that emerged from this tough neighborhood and gave birth to not only a sport, but a world wide sub-culture and phenomenon that transcends age, race, and gender. This film will make you grab your board and hit the streets or the local park no matter who you are.

1731731,5,B00006950U,"First, major kudos to the first reviewer of this DVD, Henry ""BAD H"" Hester. For those of you who weren't part of the 1970s skateboard wave, the heroes of which are documented in this movie, you may not know him. A pro slalom racing legend. Rode one of the first skatecars (which have evolved into the luges we see on the x-games today), and the founder of the Hester Pro Bowl series (which if I've heard it right is was purchased by Tony Hawk's dad in the 80's and was THE definitive skateboarding competition). He also had his own model of Road Rider Wheel:  The Henry Hester Slalom wheel.  I was totally pumped to see a true celebrity review on here! Henry's worth a movie his own self, but he's not from Santa Monica so not featured in this great movie, Dogtown and Z-Boys!

Now, about the movie. This is about the guys and gals who made skateboarding what it is today. Typical ruffians from Santa Monica (aka ""Dogtown""). These were ones who thought about bringing surf moves to the street on a skateboard. The ones who thought about taking a skateboard onto a transition/vertical surface (today's half-pipes and bowls). The ones who pioneered getting a person, and a skateboard to go so fast that they could both leave the bowl and get ""air."" NO ONE DID IT BEFORE THEM. These are the pioneers of extreme sports, and they did it all with incredible style.

My friends and I in Bellevue, WA would scour every issue of Skateboarder Magazine to see what these guys were up to, and do all we could to emulate their moves.

They did a great job in this movie, IMHO, of showing the impact of the choices we all have make. Several of the greats profiled went on to HUGE success (e.g. Stacey Peralta), some went on to prison, some went on to do ""normal things."" I used it as an opportunity to discuss these issues with my kids.  Regardless of where they are now, though, the fact remains that they started a ball rolling beyond just skateboarding, but all of extreme sports.

Good job of narrating by Sean Penn, interviews are solid, music ROCKS, the video editing was a little jumpy (""MTVish"") for me, but hey, I'm just an old skater who still listens to Jethro Tull.

This is a great movie, and if I were part of the Motion Picture Academy, it'd get my vote for best documentary of the year. Watch it if you're an old skater, you'll jump back on a board quicker than you can say ""bert revert.""

Watch it if you're a new skater, it'll teach you that style and soul is as important as trying a rail grind/heal flip mutant and not landing it 9 out of 10 times.

Let me first say, for any of you out there who are in your mid 30's - 40's, and did not skate back in the 70's, probably will find this movie (this is more of a documentary then an actual movie) boring and lacking. On the other hand, if you are like me, in your preteens-teen years back in the mid-late 70's, and lived to skate, then you will love this film. It will bring back so many memories of how  the scene was back then. Narrated by Sean Penn, and directed by a Z-boy himself, Stacey Peralta, and numerous interviews with other Z-boys (and girl) legend Tony Alva, Jay Adams, and also Tony Hawk speaks on the tremendous impact the Z-Boys had on the skate world. This film  took me back, and made me want to grab a board and start skating again, and im in my mid-late 30's. I think the younger newer generation skaters should watch this film, and then they will know where it all came from. Long live the Dogtown days, and the Z-boys....",1028851200,3,1024,4.14070351758794

7965446,5,B00006950U,"Watched this movie with my wife and my ten-year-old son, who has been developing his interest in skateboarding, and we all enjoyed it. It engaged us both with the information on skateboarding's history and the personalities of the Z-Boys who brought the sport to the verge of becoming what it would become really in the past 20 to 30 years. My wife and I had previously enjoyed Lords of Dogtown, and so it was great to finally see this movie and compare it to that. Highly recommend this movie both for fans of skateboarding and fans of documentaries. And the music rocks, too, though a bit more punk would have better fit with my personal memories of skaters back in the day (admittedly that was in the 80s and early 90s so well after the time in the movie).",1513123200,,759,4.467625899280575
