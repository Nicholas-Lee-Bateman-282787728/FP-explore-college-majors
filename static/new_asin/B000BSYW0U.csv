8091867,2,B000BSYW0U,"It was a weird production. Every once in a while, a stage-length panel that bore the word ""Pia"" would slowly moved onto the stage, blocking half of the stage. I wonder what the rational behind this is. Besides, the costumes are dull, single-colored.",1469923200,,249,4.813953488372093
8091868,5,B000BSYW0U,"The Italian Bergamo Festival certainly hit it right with the revival (actually - rediscovery) of Donizetti's ""Pia de Tolomei"" as recorded here. This is Donizetti at his best: robust choruses, melodious duets and trios, dramatic extended and beautiful solos. There is page after page of first class music (with a few low spots here and there). He has recently done Lucia de Lammermoor and about to do Roberto Devereux and the overall effect of Pia is a well wrought Italian ottocento opera.
Pia is Patrizia Ciofi, a slender powerful singer and master of bel canto style. Pia is the wronged faithful wife of the easily angered Nello della Pietra captain of the Guelph political faction. This part is sung by Andrew Schroeder. This very taxing and difficult part is very well handled by M. Schroeder. The most beautiful arias for male are those written for tenor Ghino both as duet with brother Nello and his dying confession of wrongly accusing Pia of adultery after she refused his advances. Dario Schmunck is an excellent Ghino. Everyone in the cast does well by their part and the chorus and orchestry are ""right on"".
Most critics in the past have maligned ""Pia"" as second rate music, but this performance of the newly published critical edition in the hands of an excellent conductor (P. Arrivabeni and a good cast, chorus and orchestra shows it to be one of Donizetti's finer scores. This and an inoffensive production have made this a ""must have"" for the opera enthusiast.
A few notes about the story. These are people of history in thirteenth century Italy. Their story was known to Dante and included in the close of the 5th canto of ""Pergatorio"". The setting is Siena in northern Italy; the city of Pia's family the Tolomei and nearby Maremma the citadel of Nello Pannocchiesi della Pietra. It is a time of constant fueding of the Italian city-states and the political factions of the Guelphs and the Ghibellines. The former supported the Pope against the German Holy Roman Emperor.
The Tolomei family traces it's origins to southeast Europe and as one of Aleanders generals Ptolomy and his line became the last pharaohs of Egypt ending with Cleopatra.
Finally ""Pia"" is the subject of many 19th century plays both French and Italian and the subject of a famous pre-Raphaelite painting by Dante Gabriel Rosetti in 1886",1439251200,4,2324,4.871212121212121
8091869,5,B000BSYW0U,What a great opera this is. How did it fall into oblivion. Buy this DVD and hear for yourself. Put aside Rossini and Verdi this one time and listen to this Donizetti masterpiece.,1407888000,6,178,4.424242424242424
8091870,5,B000BSYW0U,"I just finished watching it.  Patrizia Ciofi proves once and for all that great Bel Canto sopranos are not confined to the Met and/or Anna Nebretko. In fact, Italian opera houses are full of excellent singers that are unknown in America (You know the sindrome: ""Though not a Sutherland, a Caballe, etc).  She is ably surrounded by great tenors and baritones.  The production, though sparse, is definitely NOT Eurotrash.  Paolo Arrivabeni does a great job with the orchestra and chorus of La Fenice.  A real treat.  BUY IT!",1402099200,5,522,4.875

  After reading the previous review I did not expect to enjoy this opera or performance.  I found myself especially liking the music and not minding the production.  It is quite modern but at least it's not some HORRIBLE POST MODERN TRASH.  I have seen a lot worse live and on DVD.
  First to the singing and music making.  This a fine to excellent singing and acting cast.  The men are very fine to excellent especially the baritone.  The mezzo is fine also.  Ciofi is dramatically alert to every opportunity given her and there are many. I don't love her voice; yet I don't dislike or mind it either.  She does some very lovely soft singing; however her high notes can get a little squally when she goes for drama and volume.  She never wobbles of goes out of tune just some edge creeps into the voice when pushed.  She reminds me a little bit of Renata Scotto in this respect.  The conductor, orchestra and chorus all do a very fine job.
  Next, the composer.  There are many lovely lyrical moments in this score.  The Soprano arias are well crafted.  The duets are excellent.  the melodies flow and there are many moments of dance rhythms in the orchestrations.  The orchestrations are pure Donizetti.  We hear clarinets in harmony, flutes in harmony, and the wonderful French Horn ensemble.  All very typical Donizetti orchestral sounds.  There is even some of the sound world of LUCIA, especially in the orchestration.
  Finally, the production.  This is a modern minimalistic set.  There are arches or huge windows everywhere and constant use of bold colors with the ever present cyclorama.  There is also much use of colorful banners.
The costumes are quasi historical.  Again great use of color contrasts. The panels in Italian only are used (THANK GOD) sparingly.  Any more use could ruin the production.  AGAIN MODERN, BUT NOT OFFENSIVE!
  Now to sum up.  We get to see and hear a very rare Donizetti Opera that is very well sung and played.  The stage directing is okay.  The production is modern and not lavishly expensive; but it works.  I expect to watch and listen to this performance every so often.  The music and singing are beautiful.  I MAY ONLY LISTEN TO IT AT TIMES.  It is much less expensive than the OPERA RARA CDS or a hard to get alternative. recording.  Those cost $65.00 to$85.00 on amazon.  This DVD costs much less money and is well sung and played.  This is an excellent alternative! I believe LA FENICE very badly wanted to do this opera with a very fine cast; yet, not spend great amounts of money on a production of a rarity that may not be used all that much.",1232150400,13,2896,5.0423728813559325
