4467008,5,B004UFEJVM,"After awhile this show becomes addicting. I used to watch 7th Heaven (the creater, Brenda Hampton, wrote that and also writes this, Secret Life) and loved it. Then I started watching this and I cant get enough. I ship Ben/Adrian and Ricky/Amy, they are both such perfect couples! I really felt terrible for Ben/Adrian when they lost thier babby and loved when Ricky and Amy slept together aftwards, realizing life is too short not to be 'that' close with someone when you have the chance. Keep the seasons coming, I cant get enough!!!! :)",1322956800,4,538,4.73404255319149
4467009,5,B004UFEJVM,"I ordered this for my daughter because she faithfully watched this show on TV but missed this entire season.
She loved it. Watched the whole season on a Saturday!! It was addicting. One of the better seasons in her
opinion.",1320364800,,223,4.6
4467010,5,B004UFEJVM,My dvd arrived a day ago and I've watched it start to finish. If you've enjoyed the previous seasons you'll love this one. If you are new to the series I recommend starting at the beginning as the show is built on the very tangled lives of teens in high school. I think they played about the first 4 episodes of this show on pay tv in Australia before it vanished so many thanks to Amazon for keeping us up to date in this 6 months-behind-for-no-apparent-reason country.,1315526400,6,470,4.413793103448276
4467011,5,B004UFEJVM,Both my brothers & I are addictd to this show & I was heartbroken when I found out this year was the season finale!! :( :( :(,1315094400,,125,3.6666666666666665
4467012,2,B004UFEJVM,"Ok, I stuck it out as long as I could. I watched this series through the middle of season 5 and I couldn't take it any more.  I started watching this series because I liked some of the actors like Molly Ringwald and Shailene Woodley. I've never seen such a bunch of spoiled rotten, nasty teenagers in my entire life.  I know this is just a TV show but really??? If I were their parents I would have sent them all off to Military School to teach them some gratitude and manners. And that nasty piece of work played by India Eisley...Yuck. These brats getting rewarded for bad behavior again and again totally irritated me. Of course when you look at their parents on the show and the example they set...well...

Some of the episodes were genuinely funny and I enjoyed them but with all the constant teen and adult melodrama, the constant talk about sex and all the sleeping around, far out shadowed the good episodes. The only bright light was Ricky played by Daren Kagasoff. He really matured and turned out to be a genuinely likable guy as the series progressed. They should put a big warning label on this series. Adult and older teen viewing only.",1441238400,2,1150,4.492822966507177

I quit watching this show midway through season 5 because it was so BAD. I recently began finishing all of the shows that I started watching. I do not like the person Amy has become she is just a BRAT! Her baby's father is there and willing to do anything she wants to make her and his son happy and she is so cold and mean to him. Ricky was the best part of the show this season, he stepped up and took responsibility and was a great father to Ricky while his mother was off doing whatever she was doing.",1450224000,2,640,4.047244094488189
