5999012,4,B00FL31UF0,it is one of my collection,1529452800,,26,3.5
5999013,3,B00FL31UF0,Disappointed because half the movie was very slow moving and actually boring at times. Didn't like the ending. I don't know what the author was thinking. SPOILER: Katniss would NEVER vote to have the descendants of President Snow and his government participate in another Hunger Games. She was never vindictive and wouldn't subject anyone to the terror of the games no matter who they were. She just wouldn't in my opinion. Plus there wasn't much chemistry going on with her and Peeta. Made their romance boring and unbelievable. A waste of an hour and a half.,1529280000,,560,4.84375
5999014,5,B00FL31UF0,I liked how Peeta and Katniss finaly come together and are actually a couple and i am sorry for those of you who like gale but EWWWWWWWWWWW!!!!!!!! the kiss ummm no no no no no no no no,1528848000,,185,3.8947368421052633

I would like a refund for this rental.",1516579200,,319,4.333333333333333

5999052,4,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed all the Hunger Games movies and I recommend them to everyone.  I was a bit taken back with the depiction of society's privileged group as blindly believing what they were told by their governing party, whether out of ignorance or fear, and enjoying the good life to an extreme, was a bit of a stretch for me.  I was also a bit put off by the attire, hair styles and headdresses of the upper crust which from my subjective point of view looked like a never-ending Halloween party gone awry.
Regardless, I found the Hunger Games movies to be great.",1516320000,,556,4.4411764705882355
5999053,4,B00FL31UF0,"I've seen all four of ""the Hunger Games"" series: an obvious spin-off of the ""Survivor"" reality show of the early 2000s, combined with Orwellian dystopia.  The plot line's derivation from Orwell is so obvious that I'll make it the focus of this review.  While I haven't read the books, from what I gather  the story is set in a parallel America of roughly the present; meaning some political cataclysm destroyed the American Republic we know ca. 1940.  The cause of said disaster is vague, except that a failed revolution resulted in the emergence of a fascistic, Roman-style empire in its wake.  This is in keeping with Orwell's plot of ""1984.""

Except reality has never mirrored the totalitarianism of fiction, not in Hitler's Germany nor Stalin's Russia nor Mao's China.  In Panem (Pan-America?  Sounds like an Orwellianism) there are plenty of physical symbols of the old order: antique photographs, buildings, other everyday items.  Katniss' home district was filmed in the old mill region of North Carolina; a brick factory arch with the now-meaningless date of 1889 frames her marching army.  Of course all this industrial infrastructure is a shambles: the target Gen-X audience has never seen anything else in their lifetime.  But there seems to be no conscious memory of the ideas and values of the old order.  It's as if Jefferson, Lincoln, the Christian religion and all the rest never existed and have left no trace.  There is not even a Memory Hole, no Emmanuel Goldstein.  This is what I find hard to believe, that no ideological survivals play any role in the revolution as it engulfs Panem and its New Rome.

It is realistic, however, in giving us not a faceless Big Brother but a pseudo-benevolent tyrant who's kept a trace of the former era in his title of President.  The story's ""O'Brien"" (per ""1984"") is a true Inner Party dissident who stands ready to overthrow his Leader from behind.  Jennifer/Katniss is no trod-upon Winston Smith whose dreams are swallowed alive, but a girl-inspiring action-hero whose arrow shot at the sky crumbles the very edifice of tyranny.  Our Maid Marian-turned-Robin Hood brings it all down but will not be co-opted into serving a new Panem.

Though the finale of ""Mockingjay 2"" is rather weak and anti-climactic, the series - unlike most dystopian fiction - does offer hope and a better life at its end.",1516233600,,2355,4.916455696202532

5999073,1,B00FL31UF0,"This is not a review of the movie, but of the supposed digital copy you receive when purchasing the ""DVD + Digital Ultraviolet"" copy. DO NOT CHOOSE THIS OPTION. You don't actually get to download a digital copy, despite what the description says, and all the instructions on the redeeming service are misleading (I choose Fandango, but I'm not sure Vudu or whatever would have been any better). First, you can only download to a mobile device (funny, the product description never said anything about that), and even then, *only* if you haven't started to stream the movie -- which of course, they conveniently 'forget' to tell you up front while simultaneously making the 'Watch Now' button the only option you see. I understand why the redeem code only works once, but if you actually cared about your customer, you'd make sure the instructions were clearer. Where is Amazon at fault here? False advertising. Don't say I'm buying a digital copy if it comes with all these loopholes where, haha jk, no you're not. I wouldn't have purchased if I'd known.",1510272000,,1054,4.828729281767956

5999116,5,B00FL31UF0,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is a superb movie, which represents the second installment of the film adaptation of the brilliant trilogy written by author Suzanne Collins. The script of the movie follows the story line of the second novel in the series very closely, and it provides excellent plot and character development. In her leading role, Jennifer Lawrence is absolutely spectacular with her portrayal of the intrepid teen warrior Katniss Everdeen. The entire cast is sensational, and it includes an impressive assemblage of supremely talented actors. In addition to the great script and cast, the set and costumes are also fabulous, and they definitely contribute to the surreal atmosphere of this chilling dystopian tale. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is a very suspenseful and entertaining movie, and I enjoyed it just as much as the original ""Hunger Games"" film from 2012. ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is outstanding, and it definitely merits a five-star rating, along with a very enthusiastic recommendation.",1494633600,4,1033,5.382716049382716

Would've never wasted money on this if I had known that, for me it's entirely unwatchable having some monotonous woman telling me what's happening so loud I can't hear what's going on. I've never purchased a digital movie before, only watched free ones or bought hard copies, and after wasting $10 I don't think I'm likely to do so again anytime soon.
That being said, since I can't watch the movie right now, my one star doesn't reflect the film, only the fact that this version is unwatchable for me and wanted to warn others that might also feel like they threw money away.",1490486400,4,732,4.638461538461539

The Games, while brutal and horrible previously, are simply sinister now but the secrets to the field are being exposed. The biggest reason to regard this sequel as slightly better is because it adds more people for the viewer to care about even as it ups the stakes. So while it doesnt have quite the emotional resonance as the first film its more varied and we get more POVs. The first two films are quite good and superior to the final two installments. 4.75 stars.",1484524800,,587,4.444444444444445

5999231,3,B00FL31UF0,"The main premise behind the Hunger Games franchise is a flawed and contradictory one, although I doubt that the target audience cares much about that. In this second outing much of the enjoyment comes from seeing the teenage heroes and heroines at last sticking it to the Man. And the people are getting behind them too  finally. Its not quite as gripping as the first film, and it has less satirical bite. It also has a somewhat muddled plot and a hastily wrapped up cliffhanger ending. But as with the first film the cast are excellent, the effects are quite impressive, and its an entertaining enough romp, even if its not quite as profound as it likes to think it is. 3.5/5",1482278400,,677,4.549180327868853

5999287,2,B00FL31UF0,"Fair sequel to the Hunger Games series, and I'll admit that once you get through the mire of the beginning of the film the actual game sequence was impressive. But beyond that this film just tended to drag. The opening was just cold feeling and shallow, and didn't give any sense of urgency to the situation, just... goose hunting. Things eventually pick up when, as you would expect, the primary characters are off to fight again (haven't read the books, so just assumed that would be what happens in this sequel.) Some of the other contestants were interesting, but you barely get to know any of them or their backgrounds, making their fate that much less emotionally impactful. As for the ending, not sure exactly what happened and who all lived and died, but I'll give the film credit, I'm curious enough to see the next films to wrap this up.",1478822400,,847,4.6158940397351

While we think we are fighting for justice and against our true enemy, our Government waits, till the turmoil gets out-of- hand enough to clamp down with marital law and suspension of our Representative Republic under a Constitution.

5999337,3,B00FL31UF0,"The Romance does not work in this movie.  It's senseless, illogical and stupid with no rhyme or reason.

In the first movie there was never any indication that she was faking her affection for her teammate.

Suddenly in this movie, due to bad writing, it was all a scam.  The movie was good but the romantic triangle was unbelievable.  They turned her into a fickle, teasing, flirt.  First she's kissing one guy and  crying over him and then  later she's sobbing over another guy she's willing to give her life over.  If you doesn't love him as the film states in the beginning why would she want to save him at all costs.  It's a senseless script when it comes to the romance.

Kissing during combat is stupid -- one needs to be focused and alert in order to survive.  In a really good romance film there doesn't even have to be any kissing or hugging.  For example ""It Happened One Night.""  There was not so much as a peck on the cheek but the romance and the interest were there.  You could feel it.  It was palpable!  In this movie it was dull, dead and confusing.

I was never sure if she was about do lip presses with the other  guys she liked in the film until that scene was over.  They wasted her talent in the romance department.

Over all the movie was good but the nudity in the elevator was absolutely unnecessary and quickly forgotten and to no purpose throughout the movie.  Some moron decided that it was paramount to write that in.

The special effects regarding her outfit were good.

The mockingjay in the movie is code for phoenix.  Only the phoenix catches fire unless of course you're roasting duck over a campfire.
It's a deceptive way of portraying order out of chaos which is what the series is all about.  They try to disguise the bird as a mockingbird but it's not -- not when it catches fire.

And Panem is a cross between the Roman Empire and the Third Reich which is all to eager to dispatch any and all who try to change the world as it is.  It pretty much describes our country manipulating, monitoring, eavesdropping, controlling and distracting, and killing people through lies, high tech, myths, deceptions, entertainment, weapons and incarceration.

A model country in all respects.

The first two movies are good but are ruined by the weak, illogical romance.  It's obvious that was not the focus of the films.

These movies are a type of subtle message.

Enjoy them.",1474502400,,2404,4.5162790697674415

I thought all the hype surrounding these movies was a joke until I watched the first one. Woody Harraldson is in it and that's enough to get me to watch anything. He is one of my favorite actors hands down. There are a bunch of new actors I don't recognize but they all played their parts well in my opinion.

In fact, I have purchased over 140 (ONE HUNDRED FORTY) movies on Amazon Video in reliance on her ability to view them on her television, which she is not able to do on other televisions we own, such as Sony televisions, having complex menu systems.  Now, TODAY, JUNE 15, 2016, Amazon has decided to discontinue support of Amazon Video on her Vizio television and instead wants me to buy a Firestick for $50, which she will undoubtedly be unable to use!

5999440,5,B00FL31UF0,"Short and Sweet -  One of the best series of films (4) ever written.  Each one seems better than the last.  Jennifer Lawrence shows incredible talent in this series of films as she has in pretty much everything she has done.  Still in her early twenties, she has racked up five major awards including an Academy Award (she was nominated for three others). The film takes place in the future, but is more drama than science fiction.  Lawrence plays Katniss Everdeen who becomes a reluctant heroin and future revolutionary.  The rest of the story is for you to see (no spoiler here).  I haven't seen a four pack yet, so if you haven't seen the movie, you might want to wait for all The Hunger Games films in a boxed set.  But see them you must,  Drama, Action, Suspense, Great Scripts, Well Directed and Superb Acting (especially by Jennifer Lawrence a star as long as she wants to be) - what else could you want.",1465171200,,911,4.472727272727273

It follows the book pretty closely as far as plot goes, besides everything they leave out to keep it under 2.5 hours, but the writing is all wrong. The acting is god awful, the only character portrayed even close to accurately is Cinna. The directing was terrible.  They don't put enough focus on several of the main points of the story, it's difficult to follow and impossible to empathize with the characters.

5999588,5,B00FL31UF0,"There is something about Katnis Everdeen... She is every girl's heroine! In this movie, you will see how she becomes a leader! She starts becoming a true leader of the revolution without her really knowing it... Hunger Games is more than just a survival/action movie, it has a powerful love story (you will fall for Peeta, trust me) and it has a lot of political drama... It feels like a satire of today's society. Politicians, the media circus, the violence everywhere, the wars in some countries... If you enjoyed the movie, read the book! I think you will understand her better... And you will enjoy the story even more! I like the message: how even with a depressing background, love and hope is stronger than violence and fear... How Peeta and Katniss found each other and trusted each other and saved each other... They make a great team! I think in this 2nd. part of the story, you really fall for the couple! I think here Katniss falls in love with him, for real... If in the 1st one, you had doubts and you thought she was making it for the show, after this one, you will have no doubt, she is in love with him!",1461024000,2,1120,4.441747572815534

5999631,5,B00FL31UF0,"Catching Fire is the second in a series of three/four Hunger Games movies. It was well made, entertaining and had a good story line. By now everyone must have seen it, so my review can not contribute much. If you have not seen the Hunger Games series, do start with the first movie called The Hunger Games. The first movie is the best, in addition to introducing the characters, it also establishes the storyline and serves as a base for the other two/three sequels. Probably the worst out of the series is the last called Mockingjay which came in two parts, filled with just way too much useless dialog and walking around dangerous sites (i.e. killing time and making money). The two parts could very easily be condensed into one, not that it would have been made it better, but al least the suffering would have been shorter. In the series from the beginning Katniss Everdeen was great at shooting her arrow, it made the episode more focused on her personality and talent that was developed in order to survive. This in Mockingjay was put aside for some reason, there was only one arrow shot in 4hrs an 20 minutes (including part 1 and 2) unbelievably fantastic shot, but only one. Watching Mockingjay, may I recommend using the fast forward for most of the movie. The ending is good, somewhat unexpected but understandable. Enjoy.",1459209600,,1333,4.700854700854701

5999721,5,B00FL31UF0,"In the aftermath of the previous Hunger Games, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has unexpectedly found herself an inspirational figure to all twelve of Panem's districts, and this worries the capitol and especially President Snow (Donald Sutherland): they see her as a potential catalyst figure for widespread rebellion against the capitol's authoritarian rule.  Originally intending to try and use manipulated media to bring down Katniss's popularity and cast her as part of the capitol establishment rather than of the poverty-ridden and oppressed districts, when this doesn't work as well as he'd hoped Snow hatches a new plan.  Now seeing all of the past Hunger Games victors as potential threats, the capitol makes a major change in the upcoming 75th annual Games: rather than drawing from each district one male and one female tribute from the general population from 13 - 18 years old, the new Hunger Games will feature exclusively victors from the past games squaring off against each other.

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire introduces a number of the series's key characters; Johanna (Jena Malone) makes a particularly memorable entrance.  The Games themselves are faster and designed to be even more brutal; the hope is to create situations that will cause as many participants as possible to come off in a bad light.  Other plot points include Katniss's difficulties in being caught between her feelings for Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) and her feelings for Gale (Liam Hemsworth), and a deeper look at the sharp divide between life in the capitol and life in the districts.  As with the first movie, Catching Fire comes off as strangely believable in spite of (or maybe because of) the sheer extremeness of its dystopian future.  It's also a considerable feat that the whole thing doesn't come off as excessively bleak: there's lots of excitement and spectacle and frequent bursts of hope shining through the immensity of the injustices and brutalities of the world it's set in.  And the ending, as with the other Hunger Games movies, is highly powerful and memorable.",1458345600,,2069,5.155223880597015

6000333,5,B00FL31UF0,"This is an excellent depiction of an excellent book.  As a teacher, I see and hear of children much too young viewing these films as well as attempting to read and comprehend the novels. While a very talented 10-12 year old will be able to grasp the themes of the texts, the intensity, and very realistic violence of the visual experience will overwhelm younger children.  The age recommendation of +14 is very accurate.  This series delves into very dark themes including a government that reinforces a society of haves and have nots through keeping the majority of the population in despairing poverty. The callous amusement of the wealthy while young people must kill one another is terribly disturbing and should evoke that emotion from the viewer. This concept will be lost on young tweens.
This series joins the classic science fiction films and novels that are and should be required of the high school student such as ""Lord of the Flies"", ""1984"". ""Dune"", ""Planet of the Apes"" and others.  A very thought provoking series.",1453507200,,1029,4.896551724137931

For those of you who read the books and who are critics to how well movies depict what happens in books...I don't think you would be disappointed with these films. I was rather impressed with how accurate the movies were in comparison to the books. Most things were just as I had imagines. For those of you not familiar with the films or the books I would DEFINITELY recommend this item. The Hunger Games series, whether it be book or films is something I believe everyone should see or read at least at some point in their lives. Very, very well written in both senses of the term in I would recommend to anyone.

6000502,5,B00FL31UF0,"Instead of a traditional review, I'll focus on just one aspect of the film: Plastic People.
I've never really watched Regis Philbin for reason that will become obvious by the end of this paragraph, and in case I'm off base and by some unexpected chance he reads this, I hope he forgives me for using him as an example.  Television presents us with an unreal world, even in a show like David Letterman, featuring a presumably real person interviewing presumably real people.  Since they are in the entertainment industry, even when they're nominally being themselves, they are still onstage.  Now in a humor show like Letterman or Johnny Carson or John (check) Stewart's Daily Show, since it's a humor show the unreality of the perpetually smiling, perpetually pleasant host is forgivable - you already know you're not in reality (particularly if someone like Andy Kaufman shows up.)  Morning shows like Regis Philbin however are like late night humor shows without the humor, consequently watching the pleasant plastic show with the pleasant plastic host with the pleasant plastic smile has never appealed to me.

So, watching the first Hunger Games movie for the first time, on seeing TV host Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), my instant thought was ""he's Regis Philbin.""  He's symbolic of the attitude of District One, the superficiality - wear the latest fashion, hair (of a completely unnatural color), makeup.  The goal of the Plastic People of District One is to look and act like Caesar Flickerman.  He just ""loves"" Katniss (unless he's ordered not to.)  This ""love"" is a media creation, much as someone in our world who's never met her might ""love"" Jennifer Lawrence.  When your goal is to be a Plastic Person, you're molded by whatever you see on TV.

Keep in mind I still haven't read the books yet, but I think I've gathered that Effie Trinket is actually from District 12, and early on in the series she's a Plastic Person wannabe - she's trying to ape the fashions of District One, but she never quite makes it.  Over the course of the series, as she becomes less selfish and actually comes to care for Katniss and Peeta, instead of the media-manufactured ""love,"" she truly loves them.  (She never stops wearing the goofy clothes, though.)

This movie introduces Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), the new Head Gamemaker and as such is a master of molding the perceptions and manipulating the emotions of Plastic People.",1449705600,,2445,4.931707317073171
6000503,5,B00FL31UF0,"A near perfect book to movie adaptation.  This is by far the best of the 4 Hunger Games movies, and in my opinion the book that should have been split into 2 movies.  Despite this being a movie meant for teens and youth it holds up great no mater what age you are.  The casting is great and so is the film quality.  They learned from the first movie and got rid of the shaky camera of the first and that alone made a huge difference in the movie quality.  The price for such a well done movie is also a great addition to why you should by this movie.",1449705600,,550,3.963636363636364

I still don't think Jennifer Lawrence was cast for her acting ability as much as her striking resemblance to Katniss' character, although I do commend her ability to panic/scream/freak out/lose her sh*t when the scenes needed the show of emotion.

6000597,5,B00FL31UF0,This was a great series (3 movies) with movie 1 &2 being really great.  The third movie was a let down since the ending was different than the book.  If you like the Hunger Games see Divergent & Insurgent.,1449100800,,205,4.230769230769231

6000608,4,B00FL31UF0,"All of the Hunger Games movies have a slight twist on dystopia themes.  Punishing the districts that rise up and rebel against the establishment and then keeping those districts under establishment control by forced labor and near starvation by giving one person per district the hope of a better life style by creating a mass-media game is quite clever.  I think Jennifer Lawrence did a good job showing the character's transition from a mere survivor to hero.  I am not a big fan of movies that embed a romance plot in a violence-oriented plot, but I think those two plot lines were well balanced.",1449100800,,599,4.740384615384615

6000730,3,B00FL31UF0,It was OK.  Necessary to advance the plot line but a little slow in some spots.  JL sure is on screen a lot.  I thinks she's a terrific actor but extending a subplot to give us something else to consider besides cu's of JL's mug would have helped push this along.  We could explore Why is Snow so evil? or more about Hamish's background.  There's lots to cover here that would help setup the final two movies.,1449014400,,409,4.259740259740259

They are all outstanding, ranging from the sinister Donald Sutherland, to the likeable Stanley Tucci, but nobody in the cast put in a poor performance.

Is interesting to speculate if the movie would have be so excellent if the Director had made a different choice of Katniss, but she was chosen, and an excellent choice it was.",1449014400,,540,4.73404255319149

While there was still the great acting and special effects provided in the first movie, there were also some predictable elements of the plot. What was new was a greater number of friendships and other relationships (I will not elaborate on those, lest I provide a spoiler). Overall, it was an enjoyable movie -- perhaps just not as much as the first movie -- but it is worth watching. You will not be disappointed.

6000863,5,B00FL31UF0,"I purchased the first ""Hunger Games"" in the store, so this is my first review & covers the 3 I have seen.  I have a strange ""Future Sports"" collection starting with the original ""Death Race 2000"" & includes ""Rollerball"", ""Running man"", & ""The Blood of Heroes"".  Now I 've added ""The Hunger Games"" & I have noticed that in all of the original versions of these future sports with the exception of ""The Blood of Heroes"" they all have a common theme, the victors all strive to tear down the controlling government that propagates these brutal sports!  None of them do it on the grand scale of the hunger games & for good reason none of the other games really push the separation of social class & cruel reaping of the game players from what is considered the ""Serfs"" of the new world order.  This 2cnd installment is action packed & sets up the finally in grand fashion.  This story was originally a trilogy of books but the movie franchise is going to be four movies long not for greed but for pacing.  Out of all the killer future sports movies this one stands at the top of the heap in scope, scale & endearing character development.",1448496000,,1133,4.449275362318841

6001154,5,B00FL31UF0,"This is my favorite movie in the whole Hunger games series. I thought the way they shot this movie was very pretty, lots of vibrant colors unlike the later Mockingjay ones which are all gray and drab. (Although they couldn't really do much since that's how the book wrote it). I really like how Peeta and Katniss fall in love with each other during the second games too. The scene at the beach is amazing!",1447891200,,405,4.413333333333333
6001155,2,B00FL31UF0,"Cheesy formulaic plot with limited character development.  This whole series is trite with story elements lifted from other works of literature and artlessly slapped together.

6001162,3,B00FL31UF0,"This and the first movie were OK but they did not really grab me. I don't like the idea of the kill everyone game. Of course you are not suppose to but it still pushes the game rather than the opposition to the game. A lot of that is fluffed over in the start. It does not seem to be that you learn with the main character it is just not centered on since this is a revolution series you could have a main character who is nave ant then ""educated"" which gives you free reign to educate the viewer along with the lead character but they don't do this. I so have a hard time classing this as an adolescent story.",1447891200,,610,4.008196721311475

6001469,3,B00FL31UF0,"I think Jen Lawrence does a good job in acting, but thought it was sloppy in this film.  She went overboard in being crass in many scenes, which I didn't see in Katnis in actions  in the book. Perhaps it was her means of displaying the thoughts of the character (from a first-person narrative).  I also thought the director cut too many of Peta's lines.  How are we to know just how great he is supposed to be if you cut the lines which show the developed character of a maturing youth.",1446422400,,486,4.25

6001572,3,B00FL31UF0,"Unfortunately, trilogies follow certain patterns.  It is rare to find a strong middle part to a series that knows it is a trilogy.  I wasn't thinking about that when I sat down to watch The Hunger Games: Catching Fire.  And yet, by the time I was done I was able to see how that afflicted the story.

(And yes, I know they are making four movies, but they are doing it by splitting the final book into two parts, therefore Im still counting the story as a trilogy.)

As the movie opens, its been almost a year since the events of the first film, and Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) still hasn't completely recovered emotionally from her time in the hunger games.  Unfortunately, she has to put on her happy face since it is time for her and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) to leave on their victory tour and put on the act that they are in love, something that doesnt sit well with would be boyfriend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).

As Katniss and Peeta travel around, they see just how everyone lives and the fact that rebellion is about to spark.  President Snow (Donald Sutherland) blames this on Katniss, so he devises a plan to get her killed and end all hope of rebellion.  But with Katniss more focused on saving Peeta, will she play into his hands?

Actually, this movie suffers from two problems.  First, it knows it is a sequel and tries too hard to repeat things that worked from the first story.  The result are scenes that actually bore us.  They were never the best scenes the first time around, but they are actually even worse now.  In fact, the entire second part of the movie feels recycled.  This is the fault of the source material and not the movie itself, but it is still a problem.

Then theres the problem I talked about earlier, the middle part of a trilogy issue.  The problem with middle parts of trilogies is they must bridge the gap between the first part and the climax.  Obvious, right?  However, they often become so involved with getting characters from point A to point B that the story suffers.  In this case especially, the movie just ended with a couple of major revelations and no real conclusion.  It just stopped.  I will give it credit for working since I really want to know what happens next.

And thats the truth about this film.  While there are serious flaws with it, it is still mostly entertaining.  The action scenes and special effects are well done and there are some creative touches to the story that make it good.  The needed character growth is there and very good.  And things have been moved around so we can bring this story to what looks to be an explosive climax over the next two films.

And Im certainly not blaming the actors for any faults in the film.  They are all fantastic at bringing their characters to life.

Id also like to point out that I still haven't read the books, so this was my introduction to the story.  I had no issues following what was happening.  Im sure there is more depth in the book (there always is), but if you aren't familiar with the franchise, you won't get lost if you stick with the films.

As a transition film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire works well.  Unfortunately, it never becomes any more than that.  Still, it will leave you wanting to know what happens to these characters next.",1445644800,,3267,4.479661016949152

6001580,2,B00FL31UF0,"I'm not a ""Hunger Games"" franchise fan to begin with.  My sister wanted me to see this one knowing how much I hated the first, she figured this one would redeem the first.  She was right: the shaky camera was non-existent in this one-- thank god!  Still, I do not care for any of the characters as I feel there is not redeemabke qualities in any of them, or any personable attributes.  I understand it is a Distopian future, but on the same token I do not feel the underlying ""hunger"" in this story-- hence the title.  And unfortunately I feel the casting of this franchise is not accurate: if you're starving YOU'RE GOING TO LOOK IT.  Jennifer Lawrence has a very pudgy face and figure, she does not carry that role very well in my opinion.  But alas, this is all coming from someone who does not like this series.",1445644800,,815,4.357615894039735

6001661,4,B00FL31UF0,"Released in late 2013, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is the second film in the franchise based on Suzanne Collins' popular books. A new nation, Panem, exists in post-apocalyptic North America where Capitol is the seat of Panem's wealthy, eccentric populace and the cruel totalitarian government led by the pompous President Snow (Donald Sutherland). The winners of The Hunger Games depicted in the first film, Katniss & Peeta (Jennifer Lawrence & Josh Hutcherson), tour the districts to pacify the masses, but revolution is astir. So Snow declares another Hunger Game involving victors from all the districts where only one of 24 players will survive.  Liam Hemsworth plays Katniss boyfriend, Gale, while Philip Seymour Hoffman, Woody Harrelson, Lenny Kravitz and Elizabeth Banks play characters who seem to be on her side. Jena Malone is on hand as one of the players, amongst others.

I'm not a huge fan of The Hunger Games films, but I'll watch 'em. I gave the first one a 7/10. This sequel is a natural extension and its decent, but nothing mind-blowing. Because of the franchises built-in audience Catching Fire was a massive success at the box office. Jennifer makes for a worthy heroine and I appreciate the realistic tone and overall ambiance, as well as the entire dystopian concept.

The film runs 146 minutes and was shot in Georgia, O'ahu, New Jersey and California .

I wish that the other hunger games movies can be also part of prime to continue the sequence of events, because if you haven't watch the first part or read the first book you won't be able to understand the 100% of the movie and maybe you can get lost.

It will probably be better than Catching Fire which is the gem in the series thus far.",1444348800,,359,4.313432835820896

6001828,4,B00FL31UF0,"Part two of the series, it is missing the freshness of the first one, I did not feel the same level of excitement and intrigue, but then, I'm sure the author poured their soul into the first movie and had to struggle to try to keep it fresh. But because the first movie was so great, this one pales in comparison.  With that said, all alone, it is still a very good movie and worth a watch if you liked the first one.",1443484800,,417,4.024096385542169

6001834,5,B00FL31UF0,It's a little brutal but it speaks to our civilization. It's a good addition to my movie library. A little disappointed that a few of our cast got killed but it made it real.,1443398400,,174,4.147058823529412

6001843,4,B00FL31UF0,"A continuation of the story-in some respects, some improvement on the books. This film sets the stage for a dramatic denouement. I don't expect that they can wrangle more than 2 additional movies out of the remainder. I enjoyed the film, and plan to see the sequels, but glad that I didn't spend $12 + to see it. The explosions and XF might be a bit more impressive on the big screen.",1443225600,,384,4.347222222222222

6001848,5,B00FL31UF0,I am clearly a big fan of the Hunger Games books as they challenge me to think about how children play into our social and political issues.  The movies do a good job of bringing the books to life.  It is fun to compare the movies to the books. I would not recommend the movies in the absence of reading the books as they cannot capture some of the background as well.,1443225600,,368,4.097222222222222

6001944,5,B00FL31UF0,"A great adaptation of the novel, Catching Fire continues where the original film The Hunger Games, left off, telling us the continued story of Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark.  Catching Fire throws the duo and others into yet another Hunger Games, this time an unexpected and forgotten tradition of an extra Hunger Games, one coined the ""Quarter Quell"".  In this particular installment of the series, we get to see a whole new slew of characters participating in the Games, and come to learn some more than others.  The Hunger Games that takes place in this installment, however, takes a much different turn than that in the first film, and things start to heat up against the Capitol.

The acting is continuously better and better in this series, and this film made no exception to that fact, everyone in the film does a fantastic job.  The special effects aren't over the top and the adaptation from print to film, was very smooth, much like the first film.

For any fans of the novels or the first film, this is definitely a must-see continuation of the story, that was very well-planned and very well done, certainly worth the time and money.",1442275200,,1149,4.748743718592965

Very forgettable movie with good production  value, filming, special effects, and decent acting. The story and plot however is made for TV. Overall overhyped.

V for Vendetta and first Matrix, are both more cerebral futuristic dystopia rebel stories with more drama/depth. I guess if you just cant get enough of the genre it is a decent way to kill an hour. It is basically a superhero action flick for teens.",1441324800,,580,4.848484848484849

It's so relevant to life these days when the media enables us to connect more and more to needs, war and trauma around the world - things that are not easy to process or respond to. Well-written characters like Katniss and Peeta show admirable courage and realistic weaknesses.

Jennifer Lawrence continues to shine as the perfect Katniss Everdeen.  If you've read the books, you'll find that the movie stays close to the book, which I appreciate in a film based on a book series.  I watched this movie, then read the book, then went back and watched the movie again.  I appreciated the film even more after I read the book.

The twists and turns of the story to get the two back in the games again,  masterful. We start to see just how evil and depraved the President is.  Casting is excellent with Donald Southerland as the president, Phillip Hoffman (who up tiers any film he is in),  Jennifer Lawrence whose range is much more than expected,  and Peeta (whose name I can't remember... Terrible failure) who surpasses all his previous roles.  The costuming was so grand it was almost a character in the movie itself. ENGAGING! The third film I like quite a bit.  I just find myself watching this one more.  The claustrophobic conditions of District 13,  and the Ending left one a bit down.",1439596800,,765,4.607407407407408

6002410,5,B00FL31UF0,Loved the series of books and think by the second movie the producers were hitting a useful stride. Forgiveness for the lack of production dollars on the first movie is understandable seeing Lionsgate was not a huge (though respectable) movie house and the fact the author had not yet been produced.

6002524,5,B00FL31UF0,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was easily as good as the first installment in the movie adaptations of the trilogy. There were some pacing issues, which is to be expected when making a conversion from novel to motion picture...that's almost unavoidable...but it was still an excellent movie overall.
Philip Seymour Hoffman was outstanding in his role as Plutarch Heavensbee, which should come as no surprise seeing as how the man is typically excellent in the roles that he takes on. Donald Sutherland was, of course, quite fantastic in an awful bastard sense of the word, very convincingly weaving an undercurrent of threat into even the slightest gestures and conversation. The whole cast, really, was top notch as far as I'm concerned.",1437868800,,739,5.115702479338843

6002905,5,B00FL31UF0,"I finally had a chance to watch Hunger Games Catching Fire yesterday. The Hunger Games Catching Fire movie definitely has me looking forward to watching the 2014 installment and the other movie that comes out later this year. It helps to watch the first Hunger Games installment because so much of the plot in Hunger Games Catching Fire is tied into what happened during the first movie. Hunger Games Catching Fire has Katnis Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) still coming to terms with how her life has changed. She is grappling with dealing with the pros and cons of being known as one of the game survivors and handling the complex relationship dynamics with Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth). To complicate matters, President Snow (Donald Sutherland) seems to want to do everything in his power to prevent Everdeen from being able to fully enjoy her life. As a matter of fact the only time Snow seems to have any heart is when it comes to his granddaughter (which doesnt say much because even some of the most known evil people in real-life are known to at least show some semblance of humanity towards their own kids and/or grandchildren). I understand that Sutherland was only doing his job, I just found it jaw dropping how sinister he was required to be. For instance, one of Snows motives for wanting to target Everdeen has more to do with the hope that she brings rather than what she has done. There are a multitude of other famous celebrities that star in this movie as well (Lenny Kravitz, Woody Harrelson, the late Phillip Seymour, Elizabeth Banks, Stanley Tucci, and more).  Music by Coldplay features at the end credits of Hunger Games Catching Fire.",1435795200,,1695,4.824742268041237

They probably represent the most important statement of our time on the inequalities between the ""haves"" and the ""have nots,"" and outline the dangers of giving Supremacy to one group, while overlooking the needs of the rest of the country.  No one party should be allowed to exploit another group for their own greed and gain.  Those who don't study history are doomed to repeat it.  The hunger games that are held in the arena, exploit children by making them fight until there's only one child left alive, just as each district is exploited for their resources for the one Capitol.  I see a lot of similarities between the Roman Empire and Panem, and the Roman Empire didn''t have a good ending.",1435363200,,764,4.62962962962963

The real story here is government oppression/control/class warfare pretending to be ""security"" and ""peace"" - not ""who will win the Hunger Games.""

6003068,4,B00FL31UF0,"I like the relationship between Pita and Katniss.  I also liked the relationship between Gale and Katniss.  But it was pretty confusing how she seemed to be in love with both of them.  So in my dating life before I was married when I had two or more guys that I was getting intimate with, I couldn't stand it.  I could never feel at peace if I was kissing more than one at a time.  Kissing for me indicated a deeper commitment to the guy.  I couldn't commit to two like that.  I felt the importance of choosing between them.

But I really liked how the author depicted the kind of things that deepen love between two people and sustain attraction.  Time, unselfish sacrifice, enduring conflicts together.  I love how both Katness and Pita were willing to sacrifice their own life so that the other would live.  Most of us aren't faced with physical Hunger Game-like trials in our relationships.  But I believe we are faced with spiritual and mental Hunger-Game-like trials. Sometimes we turn to what makes us feel good in the moment when life gets hard like alcohol, drugs, food, porn, or another man/woman.  But the cost of doing that is sacrificing the relationship with our Pita or our Katniss.  What makes us feel good in the moment is like our life.  When we take it, we sacrifice the life of the one we love.  We sacrifice building a relationship of Sustainable Attraction with him/her.  Yet sometimes we do need a third-person to assist us when our relationship is becoming more like a black hole.  I think it's so cool that there are counselors for that and God. #ReasonToBelieve",1434326400,,1587,4.587188612099644

6003106,3,B00FL31UF0,"Beautiful graphics, lots of action, some good acting, and the story took us back to the comfort of trusting love between people to overcome the evil machine. But, like all dystopia genre, its empty nonsense. The machine enters inside of us, it takes love first then it can use our empty shells like cogs in its workings. Silly arrow would not short-circuit the machine and its theater so. Look around you, if anyone sees the machine gone crazy, they are considered nuts; and they are. No, a dystopian world will crumble slowly, sucking the life from all of us and from each, love first.
Still, its a movie, its meant to entertain, and it does; time goes fast, and in the end one wants to know what is next. Is that empty feeling and artistic achievement, or a marketing ploy? I think its a market ploy using an empty feeling from the empty concept underlying the story. Frustrating bit of eye candy.",1433894400,,899,4.555555555555555

6003310,5,B00FL31UF0,"Let's get right to it. I really enjoyed the entire Hunger Games trilogy of books, and I was definitely disappointed with the first Hunger Games movie. There were 2 big reasons I disliked it. First it felt like they spent a lot of time on insignificant details and, as a result, lost a lot of the emotional depth the film needed. Secondly, the shaky handheld camera was distracting and downright nauseating. Thankfully, a new writing team and new director means that Catching Fire had none of these problems. In fact it was a great sequel that actually improved on the predecessor and has me excited about what will come next.

They finally allow Jennifer Lawrence to experience more real emotion in this film. She genuinely made me tear up a couple times because she wears her emotions on her sleeve this time around. Josh Hutcherson is very likeable as Peeta, and you can see why Katniss actually starts falling for him a little in this film. Liam Hemsworth as Gale, however is superfluous. I know in a post-Twilight world it makes sense for the studio to play up the 2 suitors vying for the female protagonist, but nearly every scene with Gale could be easily cut without losing the story. I think I'd call the forced love triangle my only big thumbs-down in this film. The cast of other victors are really good. I particularly enjoyed Sam Claflin who gave a very passionate performance. Philip Seymour Hoffman was also a good casting choice and he does a good job with Donald Sutherland of showing just how vicious the Capitol government can be.

By and large it was what this film did not do that impressed me more than what it did. They were willing to cut unimportant moments from the book. An entire scene was summed up in just a few looks. We didn't need to meet every single victor, just the ones Katniss would actually interact with. It kept the film interesting and engaging without slowing things down unecessarily. There were a number of nods to things in the book, little things in the background which were kind of cool, almost like hidden Easter eggs. I think the only thing I missed seeing was Haymitch's back-story getting fleshed out a bit more. However that's a minor complaint in what I thought was a majorly good film. Catching Fire seriously gets the franchise back on track and should satisfy anyone who enjoyed the books or the first film. It is one of those rare cases where the sequel actual outshines the original, and I loved it.",1432944000,,2458,4.635321100917431

The quiver full of arrows is amazing. After shooting at the baboons, her quiver is empty. Seconds later, on the shore of the lake, it's full of arrows once again. Like the six-shooters in the old Westerns, she never seems to run out of ammo.

The plot in the film is terribly difficult to follow. The plot of the book is terribly difficult to follow. Having read the first book/seen the first movie... it didn't help.",1431820800,,604,4.688679245283019

The Hunger Games series is one of the few series that I think is very well portrayed on the movie screen. Although I do hate that a lot of key points are missing, you're still able to put the story together even if you hadn't read the books. The movie definitely keep you engaged the entire time. With more character development in a much sharper script the sequel feels like it had been under a little more of a tighter thumb, trying to stay closer to the book.",1430006400,2,597,4.245614035087719

6003774,4,B00FL31UF0,"I believe the reason this book/movie series interests people and is so popular because we see the dystopian society which has aspects of our society today.  Its not that far a leap from the sports, martial arts arena fights, reality survival shows and popular video games evolving into something similar to the Roman times ""bread and circuses & gladiators"" to entertain the masses - In these movies, all that has evolved into the 'Hunger Games""  Eventually, even killing the participants is seen as OK/justified.  Note: I recognize that the premise is that the districts tried to rebel against Washington oppression...oops, I mean against the ""Capitol's"" oppression and this is the punishment so they will not forget who won the last time: and don't do it again!  But oppression always, eventually, leads to rebellion so it is self defeating. A lesson we should all learn and make sure our government does not go too far either left or right.  Or, especially, allow religious fanatics of ANY religion to gain power over our lives because it always leads to oppression of some minority too.  The elaborate costumes/dress of the Capitol citizens also show how people will do anything to be like their neighbors and conform until it becomes the new norm.  As proof, witness the culture change of opinion in our society about tattoos, piercings, unusual hair dye colors, etc that people show today that would have caused them social ostracism and shunning before.  Rebellion can become the norm.  [ FYI - No criticism about that here, enjoy standing out and not fully conforming myself with a little body art and dress, even at 59 years old!! ]  The differences in dress and behavior also divides the people into 'us' and 'them' and when that happens history has repeatedly shown that then some dehumanization makes the people on top think they can do anything to the lower classes because ""they are not really people anyway are they"".  People can see that under the right circumstances our society could head that way (improbable but possible enough to fascinate).  These movies should be seen to make us open our eyes to the possibilities and warnings so we will not go down that road!!!
  Read all three of the books several years ago and was very happy with first movie.  This second movie was mostly just as good and followed ( again, mostly) the book BUT I had trouble viewing the night scenes  - they were too dark to see on my HD screen/download.  As an actress, Jennifer Lawrence has a difficult role to play but most people will not realize that she is actually doing an excellent job.  Shows great promise as she matures and if she gets the right scripts.  One to watch for.",1429660800,,2681,4.776572668112799

Take that away from the equation and it was compelling to watch and my kids enjoyed it more than I did so how can I rate it low?  They've done a good enough job to keep ME watching, but it's missing the greatness of Star Wars and Lord of the Rings.

I didn't expect to enjoy it as much as I did, but Jennifer Lawrence brings Katniss Everdeen to life in a way that no one else really could have. She has been transformed by her time in the arena, and it starts to become more and more apparent as this story unfolds.

Jennifer Lawrence was not her usual yummy self, Donald Sutherland played himself, and Phillip Seymour Hoffman played himself.  There was very little character development in this movie.

The scenes in the dark, and there were quite a few, were hard to follow visually.

It picked up where ""The Hunger Games"" ended and left plenty of things hanging for ""Mockingjay..."".  Make sure that you watch ""The Hunger Games"" first.

6004232,5,B00FL31UF0,Great movie!,1427414400,,12,5.5
6004233,5,B00FL31UF0,"The sequel however, Catching Fire (2013), blew my mind.

Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark have come out of the Hunger Games as victorseach having killed little, and certainly not in cold-blood. Now they are rich and want for nothing except freedom. And love.
And not to mention, the capital has its eye on Katniss because of her supposedly rebellious act right before the games ended. The act that enabled two people to win the Games, instead of just one.
So we journey with Peeta and Katniss on their victory tour. We watch the capital become even more tyrannical. Watch rebellion start to stir. Watch Peeta struggle with his unreturned love. Then things take an unexpected turn and Peeta and Katniss once again land in the arena. But this time, they have allies. Former victors who are not actually victors, but survivors who are scarred and realize just how evil their government is.

The emotion! The depth of the feeling. I was just mesmerized. It was so real, so powerful. The actors and actresses did a superb job! Catching Fire (2013) showed that the victors (most of them) weren't just revengeful, power-loving, prideful killers like the capital. Rather, they were broken by the Hunger Games, even though they had come out winners. They're angry. They were supposed to be protected as victors! They're afraid. How are they going to survive the emotional and mental trauma of another Game? They're determined. President Snow won't get away with this.

I say, it impacted and fascinated me.

There wasn't teens killing each other this time. It was older, broken victors. And a lot of them teamed up with Peeta and Katniss. Most of the killing in the arena this time came from the game-makers technology-made threats. So yes, I really felt like Catching Fire (2013) was a lot different than The Hunger Games (2012). It had a different feel; like not so sickening as the first movie. That being said, there still was a few yucky insinuation/violence. But I felt the filmmakers did a good job of cutting away from graphic violence and all.

My complaints would be the love-triangle between Katniss and Gale and Peeta. She led the two guys on; you can see her struggling, like, which one did she love? They were both professing romantic love to her. And she kind of accepted it from both. Arg! But I think it was probably mostly because she wanted to feel hope, safety, security from them (as a spiritual side is non-existent in this movie).

There was quite a bit of kissing too; and one inappropriate scene where nothing really is shown (well, a woman's bare shoulders and some of her back), but you get the gist.

Also, there was swearing.

Yeah, then some frightening scenes; some violence/gory/creepy as I mentioned above, but definitely not near as bad as the first movie!

Another slight complaint would be with how a few scenes portrayed Peeta Mellark. They kind of gave him this weak look at times. Like yeah, he has muscle and courage, but he's kind of nave. And Katniss has to protect him. *Look of distaste* But in the end, it wasn't that big of a deal. They both ended up helping, protecting, needing each other. They were a team. Peeta is naturally a more sensitive, sweet, conscientious guy. But he's still manly, tough, and brave. And such sacrifice! He volunteered for Haymitch so he could protect his beloved Katniss! And all when she ""doesn't love"" him! *Sighs teary-eyed*. Peeta is such a great young man.

I just adore how the love story is developing while in the Games. The fancy dresses are always fun too... Ah! Katniss's ""wedding dress""!! So cool. So rebellious, *grins*.

I also really liked where all the so-called victors talk about being forced to go back into the Games. It's deep. Poignant. Breathtaking. I liked how Effie Trinket began changing in this movie. Her obsession with glam is starting to fade a bit. Her extravagant voice is gone as she announces the Quarter Quell. She has learned to love Katniss and Peeta, and is heartbroken over their fate...

Finnick! He's so funny. Makes me laugh time and again. It's great watching his true side show underneath all those fake, protective coverings. I hope he gets his Annie back.

And Joanna, she fascinates me. A complex character; angry, broken, defiant.

The (almost) ending was spell-binding. I just...have no words. So many incredible moments!

So really, Catching Fire (2013) is more violent and such than the movies I usually watch. But the emotion left me breathless. The story intrigued me (hey, Im a storyteller, guys!). And its really the good vs. evil tale, just with a dystopian twist. Stand up the oppressed! Fight back against the evil controlling your land! This is a story of courage, acting in spite of incredible odds, fighting for those you love, sacrifice, and a crazy, amazing plot against a vain and wicked government. And it's a love story...

I have to say, Im excited to watch Mockingjay: Part I (2014).

6004358,4,B00FL31UF0,"This is my critique of the film adaptation of book 2 of The Hunger Games. In a lot of ways it were better to say that the book was the inspiration for Catching Fire the movie. Strangely Gale gets more air time here than he did in the first movie though he barely figures in the book. The Gamemakers character is written in to move the story along. Alliances are played up and Finnick has a much expanded role, was there a need to provide a strong character to support Katniss and match her strength pushing the wimpy Peetah to the background. This time round most of the killings occur off-screen their occurrence marked by the cannon shots. Much is implied and fore-shadowed in this middle movie of the series. In a lot of ways it sets the scene for the epic battle to come.",1427068800,,775,4.3517241379310345

6004378,1,B00FL31UF0,"According to Mensa, 68% of the population falls in the IQ. 80-110 range.

19% of the population has a below average IQ.

Gifted IQ levels, 110-130, make up about 10-11%.

Genius IQ levels make up the remaining 2% of the population.

When you see that 68% of the reviews are 5 stars, 23% of the reviews are 4 stars, and 3% are 1-star, the correlation makes sense. If you have a low to average IQ this movie is for you. If you are smarter than the average person, move on to something else.",1426982400,4,488,4.21505376344086

6004408,3,B00FL31UF0,"Now I'm no Harry Potter Fan, but I got this movie for my kids, and they were very disappointing. The one night I have custody of my kids I just wanted to watch a movie with them, but they just kept saying ridiculous things such as ""That's not Harry Potter, that's Katniss"" Well I got something to tell you kids, that's life. You find something you love, you cherish it, buy it a house for it, spend time with its parents, and next thing you know you walk in on it sleeping with your brother in your own bed. Needless to say, between its drug addiction, and its lack of job, the custody agreement is ridiculous, but I guess that is what we have to get used to in Obama's America.

But nonetheless, the directing was great, Jenifer Lopez plays the part of Harry very well, very true to the book, and although it was sad, it was nice to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman in one last role.",1426809600,,879,4.232142857142857

I don't like that the third installment was broken up into two installments, this is becoming a popular method of releasing films once you are hooked into the series. This just puts more money into the pockets of the filmmakers,but it delays reaching the conclusion of the story and I loose interest.

Without spoilers, I'd have to say this is a great next step in the series.  Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic, as usual. Liam Hemsworth and Josh Hutcherson also kill their roles (in a good way). I've been pleasantly surprised by Willow Shields' portrayal of Prim.  Most of the casting in these films has been spot on.",1425945600,,558,4.721649484536083

6005016,5,B00FL31UF0,"The Hunger Games sets the stage for this one.  Catching Fire is another model of The Matrix, the belief system forced upon us by the ones in power.  Transcending the bonds of illusion and defeating the grip imposed upon us, by the corporatocracy, media and the oligarchy (recently refered to as the Illuminati), is the goal of the intelligencia and otherwise informed members of the population.  At this stage in evolution it is a revolution of the mind.  Using the mind to change the mind is challenging to say the least.  A mind, once formed and reinforced by beliefs in what's right and wrong and what a reality is that we can ""trust', is challenging to modify.  These movies are a must see for you and your children.",1424649600,,720,4.5859375

6005033,1,B00FL31UF0,"Having Just watched One and Two in this series I wonder if anyone thought we would not notice the quiver of plenty ( the more arrows  she used the more went back and some) give the viewer some credit for a brain one scene, and there are many she is washed off the rocks plain to see there are two arrows left but when she emerges from the water quiver is almost full ( I wish I had a wallet like that) there are many many scenes which this happens in and once you notice them its hard not to start counting try it. Also Donald Sutherland's  beard it comes and goes from scene to scene But the most annoying thing and most films that we take home to view is the sound film directors seem to think that cast members need to whisper even though alone so we turn up the sound ,then are almost blasted out of the room when another scene comes on screen also whats this thing about darkness? I myself can't see whats going on but most of the time thats a good thing as I don't have to see the crap that is being dished up to us.

DON'T THINK FOR A SECOND THAT THGs IS A SERIES JUST FOR YOUNG ADOLESCENTS! THGs is profound series, steeped in the history of former great civilizations,while taking us into our own dystopian future. THGs are rich in archetypes. The reluctant hero; how love for another, a willingness to die for another and for innate rights and freedoms can lead to a revolution against tyranny. Think Koch brothers and that ilk for insatiable greed, elitism and a disregard for all others as the archetype for President Snow and District life. The seeds of our own dystopian future are being sown now. Katniss, oh, Katniss, we need you know, not in the future.",1424390400,,789,4.72463768115942

6005248,5,B00FL31UF0,"When it comes to book adaptations, making movies can be challenging. The films can satisfy but not be quite loyal to the book, like the Harry Potter series, or it can be neither, like the Twilight saga. It rarely happens that an adaptation turns out to be stellar. However, last year, The Hunger Games proved us wrong: its brilliant cinematography and unique directing makes the viewer feel as if they are reading the book word by word.

The Hunger Games was a major success, and the sequels were immediately planned. Since the movie became a box office beast, I was worried that the producers hunger for cash would make them abuse the technology and sacrifice the storyline to gimmicks like 3D and over the top CGI. After watching the new sequel The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I can put all my worries aside and start counting down for the next movie in the series.

Catching Fire takes off in District 12 after the events of the first movie. Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark, the champions of the 74th annual Hunger Games, get ready to start their victory tour just before the 75th Hunger Games. However, as uprisings start to form across the nation, unexpected events lead Katniss to once again play in the deadly Hunger Games, now consisting of larger threats and more experienced contestants.

Catching Fire can be divided into two sections: one that focuses on Katniss and the events of the victory tour and one filled with action scenes that will pin you to your seats. The CGI never feels overused or gimmicky; in fact, it is the exact amount that this movie needs to present its full potential. Jennifer Lawrence, who plays Katniss, brings her best acting since The Silver Linings Playbook, and she is no doubt the best fit for her strong and fierce character.

Whether you have already read the books or not, Catching Fire will undoubtedly surprise you with its dark humor, drama, and inspiring characters.

6005258,3,B00FL31UF0,"If you haven't seen the first Hunger Games movie, you should start there. It's a much better movie and provides context for this one. Even if you don't watch this one, the first one works as a complete movie. If you've seen the first one, you know that Katniss was begrudgingly accepted by those in charge, and it was clear why she was a threat. As you might expect, the President wants to eliminate her. The solution is to have another game, only this time involve previous winners. The goal is to eliminate Katniss and destroy her status as a hero. It becomes clear early on that the film will be about the inevitable revolution that Katniss will lead. It would be almost impossible not to realize that early on. But as you wait and wait for that part of the movie to come, it never happens. At the very end, it finally begins and you are told that you need to see the next movie. I expected what might be in the next movie to be in this one, and I expected what was in this one to be the introduction to this one. When an expectation is established in the beginning but the movie never gets there, then it's hard to see the purpose.

The action in the film isn't bad. But it's a game just as in the first one. It's not that it's done poorly, but it doesn't lead to a conclusion. It well done enough to be entertaining, but I can't see watching it as a movie and expecting it to stand on its merits. The most it can do is serve as a bridge between movies. If you've seen the first and are ready to see the third, you might as well squeeze this one in between. I can't speak for the third, though. After seeing this one, I am ready to give up on the series. However, the first movie is worthy of four or five stars and if you are interested in this type of movie, start with the first and end with the first. It's rare that a sequel lives up to the original, and you might as well end on a high note.",1423872000,7,1901,4.096514745308311

6005267,4,B00FL31UF0,"After reading and re-reading both the first book,  this book, and the third book I see Katniss as a selfish child, other than volunteering for her sister Prim, because we all know that if Prim were to compete in the Games she'd be dead within the first 5 min. Katniss is also very hypocritical in her 'own mind' first thinking that it would better if either Peeta were killed or she'd kill him, the sooner the better, and call it a mercy killing. Yes, initially she thinks it's every tribute for themselves and believes that it would be better if Peeta were killed. But when given the opportunity of both tributes from the same district can both win, she flip flops and seeks out Peeta, not because she cares about the boy who loves her but because there's better odds of two tributes winning over just one. The whole time she only played the audience on caring for Peeta for her own selfish desires. While Peeta was, from the start, willing to sacrifice himself so that the one he cares about can live. Katniss flop flops constantly, she's a hypocrite. She imagines or fantasize with Peeta getting killed or if this doesn't happen that it's better for him if she kills him.
In this book She believes that she is a survivor and smarter than the rest even though to any adult, she is dumber than a doorknob. She thinks because she kept her family alive after her father died in the mines that this makes her self reliant and a badass, better and smarter than all the other victors combined but this just shows her immaturity because she has no sense of strategy,none! So while she keeps all her secrets and thoughts to herself, she expects everyone to tell her all of theirs (self centered and arrogant). Like she would rather make the life of death decision FOR Peeta instead of allowing Peeta to make his own decisions to live or die. She gets so pissed at Haymich when he keeps her out of the loop, keeping secrets from her and yet she tries to keep multiple tributes and Haymich from knowing what she plans (hypocrite, self centered, arrogant, selfish and plain stupid) while being oblivious, even with all the hints, to what is really happening. It's as though she thinks that only ""she"" controls everything that happens. Then she blames herself for others' actions like the world lies on only her shoulders and only she is to be blamed even when she cannot foresee the future or read other people's minds. That her rebellious acts would only affect 'her'characters' '  cj
Hara  repercussions would
Now Katniss is good at survival and hunting for food but she thinks too highly of herself (as do so many young people). But she can only predict what might happen two steps in front of her face. Like Rue. She lasted far longer than half of tributes in the 74th Games and only because Rue helped Katniss was she able to not be stuck in the tree surrounded by districts 1, 2, and Peeta. Now Peeta could play strategy and understood the moves necessary, but his weakness was giving everything of himself, including his true love to a dense young girl who refused to return even friendship. Like Katniss thinking, ""it's better to kill him now than to become allies, help each other survive hopefully being one of the very few last tributes only to have to kill them later.""  That she'd rather go at everything alone which lowers her chances of surviving her promise to Prim that she'd try real hard to win...
Katniss' fantasies of being with Gale even though of her refusal to give back to him what he has been giving to her. Like Katniss sees only in tunnel vision, not the big picture, only to finally figure out her feeling that should've been expressed, to with Peeta or Gale, eons ago. And by the time she's willing to face the truths, Gale has drifted and moved in a different focus than Katniss. And when she FINALLY admits to herself that she can't live without Peeta, he's been captured by the Capitol. These things happen because Katniss would always put off what could be done earlier, unable to face get own truths, which is so sad, because everything she planned, she could not accomplish. And if you really, honestly, truly opened your mind you could see that without the supporting caste,  Peeta, Haymich, Finnick, Rue, and even Johanna Mason, Katniss is not really a likable character because Katniss acts out of anger, not out of caring or love. Majority is out of vengeance and anger while the supporting castes are mainly acting out of frustration and caring about Panem's people. Katniss, the girl who was on fire's actions were the how can I survive this, very revenge, make the Capitol & President Snow look bad, how can I win while defying everyone (I want to do it MY way) and have Gale keep caring about me, so I can keep leading him on. Then we can go back to being how it used to be as friends AND have Peeta keep waiting for me till I can figure out how I feel about the whole lot. The ""why is the world so against ME (boohoo)...
At the end of this book) she's so mad that half the victors knew bits and pieces of the planned syrategy, but they left her out of it. She's so mad that her plans (again) failed. And even with the abundant clues and hints, that she could not figure out the plan that she is the face of the rebellion, that she is very important to join every district into an uprising! Then she finally starts to realize that, too late, how much she needs Peeta because she put off what she could do, today!
I gave it a 4-star because it is entertaining trying to imagine a dystopian world so unlike the world we live in. And this comparison is where some people who submitted a review forgets in the critiques because it is so easy to criticize, by comparing their own lives, to a world that exist in very small pockets in the real world,while my critic is specifically towards how dumb as a rock, Katniss
So to those who don't understand the ending to the ""MockingJay"" try and imagine yourself as a teen starving (or homeless) on a day to day process, who's never had to kill another human being (kill or be killed) multiple times without a gun. Imagine the most intense situation, then add the most brutal scene(s) that you yourself have experienced in your life. Making ""friends & acquaintance"" them watching them get killed. Over and over this happens. Imagine the worst pain (physical, mental and emotional) and multiply it by 10. Imagine your small town being annihilated, burned off this planet. Now imagine everyone in your town murdered. Think of all the anxiety, grief, anger, rage, and ball that all up. Then hold that in your heart never allowing any of it to show on your face. You try and try and push yourself to the brink of exploding, losing it. Your anger festers and turns into rage and the only thing you can think about is lashing out to get your revenge. Remember, you are 16 or 17 years young. Your rage keeps yrying to push its way to the surface, all the time, but you are saving it for one moment, and so you hold it at bay constantly controlling it...then you are  thrown into a scenario where you have to ""live(?) under another dictator's reign where it is so alien to you. All your rage has turned into HATRED. An overwhelming, all consuming hatred... My guess is that 98% of you all would crack. Your mind and soul would fracture and go insane!
Why I give this complete novel a 4-star is because of Suzanne Collins' writing,  (even with all the grammatical errors), as she took me on a journey into her mind and it was an extremely well written ""journey.""  But not 5-stars because without all the great ""supporting"" characters, Katniss is seen (in my mind) as a selfish, self serving, arrogant, ""atlas"" who thinks that she is the strongest and can complete her joinery all by herself. Also, she consistently believes that she should make other peoples choices and it would be better if they'd all just lie down and die so she could go home. And I really hate reading about  selfish characters, unlike Peeta who is always willing to die for Katniss, with new regrets, out of love. Finnick, Johanna Mason, Nuts & Volts, Mags, even the Morphling, all willing to protect Katniss and Peeta, and die  for the greater good, even without any guarantees... Katniss, only in defiance of the Capitol. And that is not a likeable character!",1423785600,,8298,4.529686457638426

6005294,5,B00FL31UF0,"Well, first of all I love the hunger games series. My favorite book is the first book hunger games but my favorite movie is the catching fire. it has so much detail was watching it and I felt like someone was scratching my back and blowing on it so I would get the chills every scene I felt like I was getting the chills. You feel like you are on a roller coaster there are ups and downs in the movie. Some points you love it and some points you want to puke all over snow, but that's what makes it good! My favorite character in catching fire is Cina because he is so amazing and so pure...then he dies and that's when I cry! I am not a fan of peeta because he is an emotional baby doll!

6005301,5,B00FL31UF0,"Five COMPELLING Stars! This is a great ""Hunger Games"" sequel bringing back many of the original cast members and adding in many new ones. President Snow of the aristocracy of Panem reveals to Katniss Everdeen that he was unhappy about her survival with Peeta during the 49th Hunger Games competition. He initiates a more dangerous competition based on the 25 year loophole that requires all previous victors to compete in battle. And by sending in brutal Head Peacekeeper, Commander Thread he comes down hard on 12th District, Katniss' home district. This competition is depends greatly on allegiances to aid in strategy and in person-to-person battles. This is a great action-packed sequel starring Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, Liam Hemsworth as Gale, Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, Woody Harrelson (who steals every scene he's in) as Haymitch, Elizabeth Banks as the audacious Effie, Donald Sutherland as the evil President Snow, the efferverscent Caesar Flickerman is again by Stanely Tucci, and Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his last films, as Plutarch. The new cast members are: Patrick St. Esprit as Commander Thread, Sam Clafin as Finnick, Jenna Malone as Johanna, Jeffrey Wright as Beetee, Amanda Plummer as Wiress, Stephanie Leigh Schlund as Cashmere, and Alan Ritchson as Gloss. This is a marvelous sequel to ""Hunger Games"" and a great prequel setting the stage for the upcoming ""Mockingjay"" editions to the Hunger Games movie series. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.

6005308,4,B00FL31UF0,"I didn't feel this movie was quite as meaningful in terms of a societal commentary as the first film. It did have some of those elements, but focused more on the control an overpowering government can exert on the people. It's still a meaningful commentary, but I didn't feel it was as strong as the commentary from the first film.

However, it's still a great action story and was highly entertaining. Well worth the watch if you enjoyed the first film.",1423008000,,454,4.604938271604938
6005309,4,B00FL31UF0,"I thought the first movie was a good watch, if a bit simplistic and had some holes that made the world it portrayed not make much sense.  This second movie still doesn't answer those issues, but it at least makes more of an attempt to address bigger and deeper problems, including what makes a hero and what can make someone stand up to an abusive system even in the face of overpowering odds and firepower.  There is also a hint of a love triangle, but it is definitely not the focus of the movie in the least and they could have just as well left it out as this movie is more the coming of age of Katniss and the rise of someone who will (most likely) change the rigid structure of this unbalanced world of the super-rich (and bored) and the poor just struggling to find something to eat.

This movie returns to the world Panem and of Katniss, where she and Peeta have won the Hunger Games and, for the first time, there are two winners (a supposed couple) rather than just one.  The city is enraptured with their love story, but the president is much less so and sees (understandably) that this could become a rallying point for revolution.  In a way, he creates his own problem in how he treats Katniss as they go on their victory tour and those who express disagreement with the government are attacked.  His own actions light the spark of budding revolution based on his fears.

How to deal with Katniss and her growing popularity?  Well, the game-master of the Hunger Games decides to change the rules and bring back previous winners for a special game, including Katniss, and we go back into the arena with her to deal with all manner of nasties from animals to lightning bolts to blood rain to poison.

It's a foregone conclusion, of course, that Katniss will survive this game, as there is another movie on the way, but (at least if you haven't read the books) there will be some surprises along the way.  Some great special effects and action scenes, but this movie also offers a bit more in the way of emotional conflict as Katniss fights against her supposed destiny.  Hopefully, this series will keep getting better as it goes along.",1423008000,,2147,4.493573264781491

6005329,5,B00FL31UF0,"Compelling and mesmerizing second installment of the Hunger Games trilogy. Very well thought-out and colorful ""reverse-island"" set up for the ""Arena"" (the Capitol really spared no expense). This movie spectacularly conveyed the ominous truth that ""even the strongest"" could not overcome the powers that be. This phenomenon, of course, mobilized the ""strongest"" i.e. rich, powerful, well-connected Capitolites like Plutarch Heavensbee to join forces with the Mockingjay and the underground resistance, rather than continue living in fear they were no longer immune to. I only regret not having seen it in the theater.",1422662400,,616,5.706521739130435

6005338,5,B00FL31UF0,"So, Im going to take a hipster moment here and say that I did indeed read these books before they were incredibly popular. Thats the funny thing about being an active member of the literature community. You REALLY DO know about all these books before they become movies. Dystopia wasn't the emerging king of the YA genre then as it is now. The Hunger Games was probably my first major foray into the world of dystopia, and I LOVED it.

I was pleasantly surprised by the first movie. I thought there were things that could have been done better, but all in all, I thought it was a solid adaptation, a wildly entertaining film, and enough to get people who hadnt read the books interested in the series.

Catching Fire blew me away. Like, when the credits started rolling, I exhaled and felt like I had been holding my breath for two hours. I had laughed, I had cried (more than once), I had imagined shooting President Snow over and over again, and I had awwwwwwed at Peeta and Katniss and their confusing yet adorable relationship.

The acting in this movie is superb. Jennifer Lawrence leads this incredible cast, giving an altered performance from the first movie. Katniss lived through the first Hunger Games, but not without paying a price. She suffers from PTSD and Lawrence pulls this off with heartbreaking excellence. This trauma brings her and Peeta together, adorably played by Josh Hutcherson. Donald Sutherland is cold, calculating and terrifying as President Snow, and Philip Seymour Hoffman is effectively mysterious as Plutarch Heavensbee, the new gamemaker. Other notable actors/characters who finish out the main cast include Liam Hemsworth as Katniss best friend Gale, Stanley Tucci as the eccentric host Ceaser Flickerman, and Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket. This cast is enormous, and would take forever to name each character, but lets just say that there was not one character who I thought was poorly cast or did not do a great job.

Elizabeth Banks had a stellar performance as Effie Trinket, taking a completely ridiculous caricature and turning her into an emotional and dynamic woman. I was deeply impressed with Effies character, and I loved seeing her relationship with the tributes from 12.

The pacing in this movie is fantastic; there was never a moment where I was bored or wondering when a certain event would happen. The first hour is spent setting Katniss up to either fail miserably and be destroyed by Snow, or, by some unimaginable stroke of luck, to triumph over the Capitol. From what the audience sees, it appears that she is playing right into Snows hands, creating a tense and apprehensive atmosphere. The scene where the Quarter Quell is announced is heartbreaking, but the audience knows that without it, there would be no movie. That doesnt make it any less sad, and Elizabeth Banks packs the real punch in that scene, as Effie reads the only name in the girls pool, trying desperately to keep her usual sunny disposition.

Once in the arena, its business as usual. Except it seems that the games are more terrible this time around. The only saving grace seems to be the budding romance between Katniss and Peeta, which is genuine this time, and its amazing to see the difference in those scenes from the first movie and then the ones in Catching Fire. Lawrence and Hutcherson, who have adorable chemistry in real life, effortlessly sell their relationship to the audience, creating an adorable and hopeful scene in the midst of the cruel and horrifying Quarter Quell.

The cliffhanger at the end outraged some, but I knew it was coming (forgive me, another hipster moment). I am quite pleased actually that there will be two more movies, especially if they are both the quality of Catching Fire.

I read this book quite some time ago, so many of the details are fuzzy, but from what I remember, the screenplay does a really good job of sticking to the book.

So, if you couldn't tell, I adored Catching Fire.",1422403200,,3958,4.817378497790869

The reviews are as follows: My comments are after the ""(numbers)"" so take it to heart!
5 star: (4,996)  Brilliant people who know a true work of art! (GBY&Y!)
4 star: (1,821)  Smarter than the average movie goer.
3 star: (685)  Not so bright, but hanging onto sanity by a thread!
2 star: (259)  Complete lack of taste, and unable to be taken seriously as a critic!
1 star: (273)  Idiot with no decency, complete lack of taste, or sense of moral fortitude. (Look at 5 star rating, your way out numbered, so shut up!)
This movie is greatly described by the many who rated it as a ""5 Star"", I can not impress a better description as the person who said it was kept true to the original part one, as it picks up from the last movie, as if it never left it! EXCELLENT JOB DONE WELL!
The only thing I can add is that all those who rated it as a 1, (and 2) Star, should have there TV's, Computers, phones, and any other media they could post some type of nonsense, taken away, and never allowed to have them again.. Only the degenerates, perverts, and indecent forms of life would criticize a work of art like this one.. My suggestion to those who gave this movie a 2 star or under, please stop breathing my air, and expire to make room for someone who deserves to breath it..

6005386,5,B00FL31UF0,"Set shortly after their pyrrhic victory in the first instalment, we re-join Katniss and Peeta as they're herded about by the media being forced to support the establishment while the rumblings of revolt, started by their defiance in the Games, grow ever louder. To quell the popular uprising, the odious President Snow inaugurates a special version of the games with the aim of accidentally-on-purpose getting the rebellious pair killed.

This movie is much darker and more emotionally involving than the first, dealing deeply with themes of love, betrayal and honour but it is, by no means, dull and introspective. Totalitarian brutality is never far from the surface in the downtrodden Districts during the lead-up to the games and once they commence the contestants form unlikely allegiances serving to both unite the districts and thwart the Presidents intent.

The cinematography and CGI are of course stunning, the whole look and feel dovetails seamlessly with the first film and the whole thing has an almost Potteresque (Harry, not Dennis) feeling of continuity as we follow the physical and emotional development of the tributes. As with the first film, the cast are great, the action never stops and the whole flashy package is smartly executed, but this second movie is far less superficial. But put all that cerebral stuff to one side the ending!!! OMG - as the really annoying text-speak puts it  how can they do that to us?

The next, eagerly awaited instalment in the franchise, Hunger Games: Mockingjay  Part 1 is scheduled for US release November 21, 2014 but us lesser mortals are probably going to have to wait the best part of a year before its out on Blu-ray. Oh yes  we shall be re-watching the previous movies in fervent anticipation.",1421539200,,1757,5.0

Looked great and I'm glad they decided NOT to make Katniss into some sort of almost super-hero level character and that she still has flaws from being an emotional youngster. I'm not sure that will play much longer based on what she's endured just in order to survive the first 2 stories so it will be interesting to see what they do with her character in this recent 3rd release (Mockingjay - Pt. 1). Not having read any of the books it's still not a ""must know"" kind of story for me and I'll be content to wait for the end of the movie trilogy to come to Prime whenever that occurs. It was, however, a little sad for me seeing PSH in a role that I wasn't aware he had done before his untimely death last year.",1420502400,,744,4.102739726027397

Perhaps even better than the first, since we all know the politics and feelings of the characters by now, there is no need for long explanations of motives. The Games, we know are cruel and awful, so that phase was thankfully shortened and a conclusion quickly occurred with very little hubris or bravado. It's obvious this film is just the introduction to a far greater epic in the making, but it just left you wanting more, so mission accomplished ;)",1419811200,,479,4.5813953488372094

6006337,3,B00FL31UF0,"This movie was not as good as the first.  The drama, plastered on fake faces, and overly extravagant clothing of those in the Capitol I know were meant to convey just this distasteful response, but I simply thought it was overdone, to no dramatic effect.  I did know the story line from previously reading the trilogy.  With Book 1, I thought they could never achieve in film what they did in literature.  Yet, I believe they delivered and developed all characters sensitively and told the story very well. In ""Catching Fire"", it felt like the director, and even the actors and actresses were resting on their laurels, as if this movie would be a sure thing.  They were wrong.  It was cookie cutter dull compared to Book 1.",1419552000,,723,4.609375

6006365,5,B00FL31UF0,"I have fallen in love with Jennifer Lawrence. Her acting is so smooth and so effortless, it doesn't seem like acting at all. I totally buy into the character she plays in the ""Hunger Games"" trilogy plus and her characters in any of the other films she has been in. Beyond that, the movies are wonderful adaptations of the novels. Jennifer makes me fall in love with Miss Aberdeen, even though the character is not really very likable. Beyond her public role, she is more than a little self-centered. She cares little for anyone outside her small circle of people. The trilogy seems to indicate her maturing as she moves through these horrific and life-changing events, and that is the brilliance of Ms. Lawrence. With little mare than a head shot, she communicates a wide range of emotions in only a few seconds. The storyline is wonderful and bears re-reading, just as the movies will bear re-watching. If you haven't yet seen this, watch it. If you have seen it, watch it again. It always rewards.",1419552000,,999,4.681818181818182

I walked out with my friend myself and we asked for a re-fund in less that 15 mins that's how terrible the 3rd pard was, and I have no interest watching the rest of the parts, and I hope sane people will do the same to protest against these a-hole film makers that are just trying to stretch a movies with some totally bs stuff and collect more money! same crao they tried with twilight, I hope enough people will walk out of the theatre from these kind of crap movies so these film makers will realize they can't just bs people.",1419465600,,800,4.235294117647059

6006440,5,B00FL31UF0,"Young adult novel adaptions to film are the newest trend in movie making today. The Hunger Games is with out a doubt the best film saga created on that basis since Harry Potter. Once again fans will rejoice in the accurate depiction of this story's plot, visions and characters.

Jennifer Lawrence, once again lights up the screen with an emotional and passionate performance as Katnis and the rest of the cast follows in her image. The newcomers including the late Philip Seymour-Hoffman an Jenna Malone among others do not disappoint. The biggest improvement is the changing of directors and Francis Lawrence removes the shaky cam, the one major fault of the previous film in my opinion. Once again the story is moving and epic and when the lights go up you are craving more from this gripping tale.

As far as Mockingjay goes, I was not the biggest fan of the book, but the two films that will close out the story based on trailers alone have given me the visuals I was so desperately craving to put the book into a better perspective for me. I am hoping that both of these films, which really could have been one will do the ending of this saga justice.",1419379200,,1157,4.5576923076923075

I was never disappointed during this sequel, Catching Fire.  It had a great story and stayed true to the story line, this is the type of movie that allows you to forget everything in life and live with the people on the screen.

6006568,5,B00FL31UF0,"When I saw the first movie I wasn't expecting much.  That story as well character development and cinematography pulled me as this isn't normally my type of movie and felt initially it was a ripoff of the Japanese movie Battle Royale, where teens fight each other to the death.  Albeit, that is the basic premise of both movies, with totally different circumstances after having watched this movie.  This movie is about the continuation of a dystopian society, whose main purpose to remind the poorer and controlled parts of the nation is to have its members participate in an annual ritual of fighting each other to the death, under the guise that winning brings recognition to the victors as well as the district that they belong to.  Another film one might relate this to is The Running Man, where instead they used prisoners as well as those turned into prisoners for being against the government, to participate in a game to the death for all to enjoy.  This only lightly touches what this movie is about and I won't spoil it further but even if you don't think this movie is for you, watch the first one and then also this one and see what you think.  Highly recommended.",1419120000,,1177,4.634615384615385

6006878,5,B00FL31UF0,"From solid storytelling to Movie Magic, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" surpasses every standard set by it's predecessor and keeps you engaged the entire time. With more character development and a much sharper script, this sequel feels like ""The Empire Strikes Back"" of this series. This time the winning tributes from the past years are forced back into battle with each other and they must form allies to survive. This time they are in control of the entire setting of the games and try their hardest to decide to lives and who dies. Straying away from the shaky cam like the first film had, and getting much better direction on board, the crew does a much better job here and the actors look more alive than ever. I have to say that I loved every second of my experience with this film, even though a few technical aspects were pretty distracting. The stakes are raised and you will not see some of the twists coming. The second instalment in ""The Hunger Games"" franchise is terrific and I cannot wait to see the conclusion.",1418342400,,1030,4.633879781420765

6006920,4,B00FL31UF0,I enjoyed watching this movie but did not find it as exciting as the first one.,1418256000,,79,4.0
6006921,4,B00FL31UF0,"When I saw Catching Fire in the movie theater, I had the feeling that I had seen this movie before, but it was titled The Hunger Games. Once again, Katniss has to compete in another Hunger Game. But it's a Hunger Games All-Stars kind of competition, like Survivors All-Stars or something. Past winners compete against each other. Still, I had a sinking feeling that's all it was going to be.

But this is a movie that is part of a series, so the ""all-star"" games is a prelude to what happens at the end of the movie, and you do have to wait until the twist ending to understand what you just saw. You say you want a revolution, well here is where it heats up in a big way. You might not like the idea that the movie doesn't really end. You're left with little explanation, in a kind of The Empire Strikes Back sort of way.

Yet we get another blockbuster performance from Jennifer Lawrence and supporting cast. Watch very carefully to Katniss' early signs of PTSD, which she obviously is suffering from after her experiences in the Hunger Game. Lawrence's ability to subtly bring out this aspect of the character is fascinating to watch.

Yes, it suffers from being the second act of a three (or four) act play, but that's OK. You've bought into it this far, you gotta see it through.",1418256000,,1284,4.432203389830509
6006922,4,B00FL31UF0,"Very in line with some of today's headlines.  Although it is way beyond what we see today, one could see us heading there.
At the same time I feel a bit sensitive to all the violence both in and out of movies and the 4 stars is more for the subject rather than the content of the movie which was good all around.",1418256000,,312,3.9523809523809526

Taking place after the victors won the first set of games, this movie has some fun twists and turns along the way, and you really feel your emotions go for certain characters, whether you love them or hate them, don't trust them or think certain people are up to no good.

Of course, the movie was based on the book so it had to follow the narrative line set there, especially since I believe the screenplay was partly the work of its author, Ms. Collins. My problem with all these futuristic movies is that there is much too much technological input. The bit about sponsors being able to send what look like drones to help their favorites is brilliant. On the other hand, the deux ex machina of firings, rockets, explosions and penetrating this and that shield just becomes  tedious after a while without the proper setup. I believe, like Hitchcock said, you have to engage the audience. If the audience can't see the A of a plot to kill B then B walking into the trap means nothing except a lot of sudden jolts. Also, the concei/metaphor must be consistent, and viable. The general idea of a Hunger Games, and the like is very interesting and resonates accordingly. Even the notion that we are watched as by some omniscient God, as our heroine and her associates are, is credible and interesting. I'll even accept interventions such as flooding the field with some degree of realism. After all, Poseidon wasn't above stirring up the ocean if you insulted him, Athena wasn't above getting piqued and causing mayhem if she was not properly respected, and God wasn't averse to parting the Red Sea when required. But neither of them pressed buttons to jumpstart the narrative.  And there were too many of these disjunctive maneuvers in this film which became as boring as Avatar was to me. Too much sound and fury in the end signifies nothing but laziness; and it becomes tiresome. Id rather see people stranded on an island with only their wits to survive than so much techno craft and mumbo jumbo. Nonetheless, despite so many of these broad strokes, the movie did move apace and was entertaining. I agree with some reviewers that the story has been told before with more subtlety, but after all, even Shakespeare was not averse to underscoring some of his concerns about morality. The movie is worth a view, for sure. Whether it carries an emotional wallop is another story.",1417996800,,2240,4.723785166240409

6007180,4,B00FL31UF0,"Catching fire is the second in the Hunger Games trilogy. I liked the first film but, not having read the books, feared the second one would get mired down in the feigned love relationship between Katness and Peeta. It didn't. The story begins in District 12 where they are preparing to leave their family and friends again on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Just before leaving, Katness is visited by president Snow who reveals that her act of rebellion in the games has encouraged unrest in the districts. If she doesn't convince everyone that it was not rebellion but blind love for Peeta that guided her actions, her family, friends and the district will pay the price. But a Victors' Tour is just the beginning of a new nightmare as President Snow announces the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell) - a competition that will pit the victors of prior games against each other.

While Catching fire is a great action adventure drama, it is also a commentary on economic inequality and its consequences. But offers hope in the courage of young people willing to oppose the savagery that keeps them enslaved.",1417824000,,1120,4.77319587628866

Despite reasonably good acting (especially by supporting actors, not so much by the one-dimensional deadpan Ms. Laurence gives), this teen crowd-pleaser somehow never achieves the poignancy or (relative) depth of the book, or the first episode.

6007282,5,B00FL31UF0,"The second movie in the Hunger Games series is really well-done.  As an avid fan of the books, I was really impressed at what a masterful job the director did of capturing the essence of the book on film, which can't be easy to do with all of the complicated plot points and futuristic elements.

Katniss Everdeen survived her first time in the hunger games arena, but in doing so, she has infuriated the President, who feels that he has embarrassed him and made a mockery of the games.  As punishment, he devises a way to send her back into the hunger games arena a second time. But this time, she is determined to ensure that Peeta is the sole survivor.

Excellent acting, beautiful costumes, and terrific sets make this a terrific movie!",1417651200,,740,4.541353383458647

6007611,4,B00FL31UF0,"what a lovely girl the lead is, and capable of carrying the movie!  Ms. Lawrence is young and radiant and she is in almost every scene.  Lots of work!  Further, the only criticism I would have is that near the end, the action moves faster than the brain can register all the intricacies available.  Perhaps a pause of 30 seconds?

Perhaps this is because I never watched any of the other Hunger Games movies, and this was tied to one or more of them, but the plot and communication between characters was only confusing.  The movie was dark.  I cared nothing for it.",1417392000,,381,4.463768115942029

The story is a set-up for the recently released third movie, which is a Part 1.  Frankly, I'm just not a big fan of a story line about killing young people for the sake of political gain and/or entertainment.

6007703,2,B00FL31UF0,Haven't been that impressed with this series of movies. Watched them because of all the hype but it is too much of a teenage love story for me. The best part of the movie was the Coldplay song that comes on at the end,1417392000,,217,3.9545454545454546
6007704,2,B00FL31UF0,The film did not make a lot of sense.  Lots of mindless action for a gladiator type game where end result did not seem to really matter.  Kind of dumb actually.,1417392000,,160,4.129032258064516

6007719,5,B00FL31UF0,The movie was amazing.  Only problem I had was there were 2 spots while watching that glitched out and would not let me see.  The first skipped over almost 5-10 minutes of movie and the second about 5 minutes.  No matter how much I tried I could not get it to play.  I just had to wait until it skipped over it.

6007897,4,B00FL31UF0,I thought it was good Sci-Fi. But not believable. I never read the book so I can't make the best judgement. There were too many inconsistencies in how people reacted. The lords and ladies and the peasants. You just know how it going to turn out. I enjoyed the first movie. The 2nd one was a bit too long. I'll watch the third one for the obvious reasons.,1417305600,,354,4.220588235294118

I still think The Hunger Games was the best movie thus far.  Catching Fire was good and Mockingjay Part I was decent, not too far below Catching Fire.",1417305600,,291,4.452830188679245

6007953,1,B00FL31UF0,A fully scripted episode of Survivor. Obviously a payday for the cast - they mailed in flat performances.,1417305600,,105,4.888888888888889

6007968,5,B00FL31UF0,Movie is so much better than the book. Spectacular cast. Jennifer Lawrence can out- act nearly anyone in my book. I love how the movie illustrates Katniss' struggle between her old life (Gale) and her new life (Peeta). I don't recall that effort or distinction in the book. She can never be who she was prior to her Hunger Games no matter how much she wishes things could go back to where they were.  Peeta's development into her quiet strength is remarkable and it's beautiful how she slowly discovers just that: Peeta is her rock because he gets it. Great movie.,1417305600,,564,4.584158415841584

This movie did not disappoint. It followed the book, nearly identically, leaving out only the superfluous material.

Portraying a dystopian society with dark color tones is one thing, but this film has ten or more minutes at a time when you can see nothing but a dark screen with occasional bits of light jumping around. Might as well be a radio program! Additionally the FX are incredibly fake (when you can see them at all!)

This one was more of the ""adults"" killing each other and from what I understand that will be the rest of the movies from here out.

6008507,5,B00FL31UF0,"Jennifer Lawrence, who seems to be in just about every other movie made in the last two years, returns as Katniss Everdeen in this second 'Hunger Games' installment and she is every bit as good as she was in the first one.
Lawrence, who has surprising range for a young actress, in fact plays the emotionally conflicted Katniss perfectly. I've tried, but I just can't imagine anyone else in this role. There are other actors who could match her physicality and some who might be able to match her emotional range but I can't think of anyone who could combine them in the way that she seems to do so effortlessly.
She isn't the only one who nails her role in this lavish dystopian film, however. Donald Sutherland as the evil President Snow, for example,  brings exactly the right level of intense malevolence to the role. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman, in one of his last roles, is excellent as the new game master who has an agenda of his own, and Josh Hutcherson plays Peeta as though he was born into the role. Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks and Liam Hemsworth also stand out in this remarkable movie.
If you liked 'The Hunger Games' then this movie is something you must see.",1416960000,,1183,4.580188679245283

I enjoy the conflicted veterans of the Games from each District and how their characters are developed.  You will not be disappointed. Only caveat -- one thing drove me a little bats.  When Katniss and Peeta are discussing their plan and the President views from a remote location and overhears their strategy.  News flash the Hunger Games is a show. Contestants have video and audio devices tracking them.  They would know that.  Little sloppy on that detail.,1416787200,,536,4.888888888888889

The romance portion of the movie, especially, felt a little flat.

6008661,3,B00FL31UF0,"Tighter than the first, nice enough production values, and has a great stand out in Jena Malone, but the marginalization of Hutcherson (the best part of the first movie), the wasting of Philip Seymour Hoffman, the relatively limited palate of Jennifer Lawrence's performance (mostly numb or ugly-crying), and the general sense of trying to avoid its own premise drag it down to pretty good.

6008677,1,B00FL31UF0,"Love Jennifer Lawrence in anything but this nonsense.  As a Veteran trained for guerrilla warfare believe me folks anyone as emotional as this character would be the first and easiest victim.  This is choreographed CGI madness where a Warrior would lose control emotionally over and over in the midst of other professional warriors/killers is ludicrous.  This is just another series representing the prostitution of Hollywood screen writers in a tired exercise of remaking the same movie three times + for ten year old girls. Yes, in an era of the future tech a Bow and Arrow is a master weapon?  Nonsense!

Nowadays, everything filmed for the preteen audience seems to must have 3 or more of the same idea over and over.  Jennifer and the Writers/Producers are laughing all the way to the bank I guess. If I owned the Bluray I'd loved to count the number of times she loses her emotions and control and somehow none of these pro's take advantage but in reality that may work at hunting squirrels but not professional warrior killers that keep centered and in control. Is the Defense Dept watching and taking notes so they may bring back archery to battle ISIS? What utter nonsense!  When I see the 3rd movie trailers of her shooting a moving aircraft out of the sky with an arrow that is simply ridiculous to think anyone could make an arrow move at that velocity and height.  Just CGI B.S.!",1416787200,5,1392,4.699588477366255

6008697,4,B00FL31UF0,"These ""Hunger Games"" films actually leave me a little cold, to be honest.  The set pieces are great, the action solid, but the performances are wildly uneven, from excellent to completely overdrawn and melodramatic.  It's like some of the actors are in a different movie.  That said, Donald Sutherland, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Lynn Cohen, Woody Harrelson, Jeffrey Wright and even Lenny Kravitz deliver nicely understated yet powerful portrayals.  And Jennifer Lawrence carries the film with a performance that always hits the right notes, never too big or small.  Quite an accomplishment in a film that paints mostly in broad and obvious strokes.",1416700800,,647,5.303921568627451

6008809,3,B00FL31UF0,"Felt a bit like more of the same -- back into the games, to be hunting each other, just with a little more grouping this time and not really as poetically done as the first outing.  Katniss didn't seem so much brave in this movie as obnoxious, and the girl-in-a-love triangle thing is about as tiresome as the old sexist male trope of ""hero saves the girl"".

Hopefully Hollywood -- and the publishing industry -- figure out how to write these sorts of stories without making them all the same.",1416528000,,493,4.466666666666667
6008810,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie is one of those that you must see a couple of times (at least) to catch some of the subtle things that are said and done to really appreciate how well written, directed, and produced it was.  Even watching things that are in the background is fascinating and leaves me wondering how I could have missed that the other times I watched this movie.  As with its predecessor, ""The Hunger Games"", you can watch this movie many times and not be disappointed.",1416528000,,463,4.5

6008823,4,B00FL31UF0,"This 2nd installment is a bit disappointing. It is quite slow in the beginning and there is not much added to the story. The level of energy is lacking. Katniss' dilemma between her feelings for Dale and Peeta waffles at best. She remains resistant and remorseful but is obviously being ""helped"" along. The ending is easy to see coming - no real surprise. However its a nice transition to the upcoming sequels. From their ads I expect they won't disappoint.",1416528000,,457,4.725

At least in this film they has a very plausible twist.",1416441600,,362,4.671875

6008951,4,B00FL31UF0,Outstanding movie. Cast is strong and the depiction of Panem is spot on. Similar to the first movie the screenplay does a good job of conveying a lot of the internal thoughts and emotions that you get from the first-person viewpoint in the books.

6008958,3,B00FL31UF0,"Through out the movie I kept asking myself why the producers didn't let Suzanne Collins help write the screen play? There are many points in the film that I felt that the dialogue was a bit ""ham-fisted"" and sparse on character's motivations. The movie seemed to me to be the Reader's Digest version of the Abridged version of the book.

I would suggest reading the book rather than seeing this movie. But even the book seemed like there were many parts edited out to keep the page count down. Middle books are always toughest to write because they are to transition the reader (or movie goer) to the next stage of the story. As an example, The Empire Strikes Back.

Lastly, it seemed to me that Jennifer Lawrence was just phoning in this performance. I really didn't see any of the internal struggles of Katniss in her eyes or body language. Katniss was determined to give up all for Peeta but yet it was all the others sacrificing themselves for her. Jennifer Lawrence couldn't seem to translate that internal struggle to the screen.

If you are really bored, then watch this film... though it will only make you less bored.",1416355200,,1125,4.615

6009013,4,B00FL31UF0,"I never read the last two books of this series and probably never will. So this review is just based on the film as it stands by itself apart from the book.

The first movie The Hunger Games caught my interest because of lead actress Jennifer Lawrence. And she continues to do a great job portraying the character Katniss. It was nice to see the late Philip Seymour Hoffman in this second film to give it star power which I don't think it needed considering the popularity of the books to draw in fans of all types. But that's Hollywood politics which I know nothing about.

Though the concept of the books of which the movies are based is nothing new it is sort of a refreshing take on it. For something in it's genre watch the Japanese film Battle Royale which was released over a decade ago.

The movie's pacing starts off well and ends well. Throughout the whole movie you are kept at the edge of your seat and in suspense as it takes you on a ride through yet another survival ordeal. There are neat new threats of course and watching them deal with their predicaments as corny or over the top it may appear at times is still entertaining.

It's not a bad movie if you're not looking for Lawrence of Arabia or Schindler's List or a Lincoln type film. Sure there are many better action/drama films out there but it keeps it's entertainment value and is worth renting the first time on instant video. I liked it enough I bought the first two movies on instant video.",1416182400,,1469,4.389705882352941

I don't see why the president uses the games to cow his people.  Is it suppose to be like the gladiators in Rome? But all of the gladiators in the Hunger Games die each year except one.  And now the president wants all of his past winners to fight to the death.  Staging the games in a dense forest doesn't make for a good spectator sport for the people but the movie viewers get to see it very well.  No wonder there is a revolt going on!

6009104,5,B00FL31UF0,"I read all three books as well as Suzanne Colins other series, Gregor the Overlander. He writing style is tedious and her character development is week. Her plot is decent and she has a timely and fascinating underlying dilemma and themes. She seems particularly interested in children in war or warlike situations. With what's going on around or world I found the themes and central dilemma strong enough to pull me through her stories, but they aren't high on my list of great writing. But different medias have different strengths. This movie Shines! It is exceedingly rare for a movie to improve on a book; this one Does! Jennifer Lawrence takes a very flaky described character and builds a dynamic and believable young woman. Plot and theme are more important in film than character arc. As such, though Divergent was my preference in book, Hunger Games had been my movie preference. You'll love the movie, but if it inspires you to pick up the book, be warned that you might be disappointed. My sister only read to the end of the first book at my provocation that the themes and dilemma were worth the read. She flatly refused the second book. But she had loved the movies right along with me.",1416182400,,1200,4.691943127962086

It almost covered every scenes that were presented in the book although there are still some variances from the book.  There were more scenes like the ones in the Black Marketplace and more meetups between Gale and Katniss that were not put into the movie but over all, the full story was narrated and depicted explicitly in the movie version.  The movie as a whole was really fascinating and I especially loved the Parade where Katniss and Peeta's costume were catching fire; very well depicted in the movie as I had imagined it when I was reading the book.

6009188,3,B00FL31UF0,"All sequels  face the same problem. Introducing a new premise for a story in the first episode is exciting, but how do you duplicate that thrill in the sequels? As far as writing goes, the only options are 1) to up the ante for the protagonists and 2) to tighten the screws on the innocent victims. That makes all sequel story lines predictable and less compelling.

Since we know there are more books remaining in the series, it  was a pretty good bet Katniss would not get killed off in this episode. So the only choices the writers had were to make President Snow even more despicable, make the oppression worse, and to create even more fiendish games. (I wrote the premise for this series in a short story for a creative writing class at Mizzou in 1969. I'm glad to see it come of age). Nice cinematography, nice work with the costumes and sets.

6009246,4,B00FL31UF0,"There is a weak character that seems to take away from any logical transitions for future gains by the oppressed and this is why I cannot give the storyline five stars, it seems as if the plot is going in circles trying to find a place for that weak character!",1415836800,,260,4.22

6009256,3,B00FL31UF0,"Move along, move along, nothing special to see here folks.

You either follow the series or you do not, the book of course was great, the movie adaptation not so much.  Seems like they tried so very hard to make visuals carry the plot and the movie, all actors at times just seemed tired and over-rehearsed.  Good for watching do not get me wrong, a solid 3 stars, but that is about it.",1415836800,,386,4.260273972602739

6009265,5,B00FL31UF0,"Great adaptation of the book with a few modifications of course. I would have liked both movies to be longer and stay closer to the books detail, but that is the difference between a book and a movie. If you have not read the books, you are on track for the main story line going into the next movie. Reading or audiobooking the first two will only enrich the story. If you have read them, like me you wanted to see more. Meh, it is still a great story. The director needs to use the range of the actors better and more consistently. Its an elevator ride, uncomfortable at a point, but the view is great!",1415836800,,604,4.2155172413793105

6009270,2,B00FL31UF0,"Been there, done that.  The first movie was a terrific rendition of a shopworn, gladiator trope - but notable for great costuming, beautiful characters and some exciting scenes.  But this is just an attempt to wring more bucks out of the original idea.  I'm sure there will be another follow-up and Ms. Lawrence will be trotted out to  pretend she's seventeen and a proletarian warrior from the sticks.",1415836800,4,402,4.867647058823529

6009303,3,B00FL31UF0,It feels like a sequel. It can't stand alone as a movie. It has no start and no end. It's just the middle of an Oreo cookie that can't stand on its own without the before and after crackers. If you liked the first movie you'll probably be happy to see a little more of the same and maybe disappointed that there isn't anything new. Maybe you can blame the book (I did not read it) for this feeling that the story is incomplete but it's not a good excuse for the movie not to plug the holes.,1415836800,,490,4.010204081632653

If I were reviewing in terms of pure cinematography, without prior knowledge of the books,  I would have give this ***** as well. I thought it was very entertaining, the action intensive half of the movie was very well done, and it left me anticipating the release of the first part of the third installment.",1415404800,,564,4.466019417475728

Jennifer Lawrence is a cutie, and a not too shabby actress. Her facial features have matured since the last film, not in a  bad way. She look more like a woman and less like a girl.

I enjoyed this film a little more than it's predecessor. Which I find rare for a sequel. I'm not completely sure why I liked this one more. I think it was a little darker. Maybe that appealed to me. I we definitely gear toward a more mature audience. That was not meant as code, teens may or may not get all the themes",1415318400,,724,4.348148148148148

6009611,3,B00FL31UF0,"Overall I thought this movie was reasonably entertaining, especially if you have not read the books. It dispenses with the annoying shaky-cam cinematography of the first movie, but somehow it managed to be an even more shallow adaptation than the first movie. Specific instances of the Capitol's cruelty and abuse were simply skimmed over and quite a lot of Katniss' personal agency was simply scrubbed away. Unfortunately I felt Phillip Seymour Huffman's performance in this film was simply weak and the behind-the-scenes-at-the-capitol material didn't deliver. I think Jennifer Lawrence could do a fantastic job if she was given better material in these films and she really killed her few really personal scenes.",1415318400,,715,5.392857142857143

6009616,5,B00FL31UF0,"I devoured the books and was excited to see the movie versions.  It was hard to imagine how they could do the books justice in film.  In my estimation, I believe this movie was well done.  Many scenarios that my mind's eye had difficulty seeing were amazingly created.  I loved the non stop action and the level of tension that was ever present.  Casting is great although I missed the woman who played the original activity coordinator (gold hair).  The abrupt ending has me waiting anxiously to see the final book in movie form.",1415318400,,530,4.585106382978723

I realize it's young adult fiction, but the theme of good overcoming evil_no matter how long it takes_ is very appealing.

As with the book, you need to have seen or read the first story to fully understand what is going on, it is not a stand alone. It is a trilogy and you will want all three parts.

Anyway, I liked the movie, glad it was offered on Prime and I'll watch it again, because I'm sure I missed a few things during my first viewing.

By the way, I think the casting was brilliant! Phillip Seymour Hoffman was excellent and Donald Sutherland can say more without uttering a word is simply wonderful to watch.

6009997,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie and The Hunger Games managed to maintain the look feel and sensation of this wonderful literary series.  Of course there were some elements that were cut as needed to allow for smoother movie flow but in truth I cannot say how impressed I was with the level of detail and effort put forth for this amazing movie.  It would have been so easy to cut corners but it is so obvious that the film makers did not.  Since I have seen both ""The Hunger Games,"" and ""Catching Fire,"" I know I will be amazed by what is to follow.  It saddens me that Seymor's presence in the next movie will be computer generated.  I know the producers, directors and writers will do everything in their power to see that his memory is honored posthumously.  I am a great fan of this literary series and am so grateful that Miss Collins saw fit to share it with us, the world.

Thank you to you Miss Collins and to those who worked with you to bring this work to the silver screen.  Your choices in actors, sets, costuming, portrayals, music, props and characterizations were all so vividly close to the narrative fiction of the writing that I was allowed to feel the desperation of the Hunger Games from the perspective of District 12, which incidentally is where my original family routes spring from.

Thank you so very much for this experience.

6010060,4,B00FL31UF0,"Bear in mind, I have not read the books, so I'm basing my opinion on the strength of the story told in the film, without comparison to the books.

Catching Fire continues the saga of this dystopian society and their perverse love of the Hunger Games, in which people die until there is only one left. Well, yes, a familiar scenario, born in the Games of ancient Rome, and probably even before that.

I don't want to give it away, so I will simply state that the story picks up what seems barely weeks after the end of the first film, so good continuity here. Our heroes are on tour, celebrating their victory and learning that it is not what they expected it would be. But they ""go along"", in spite of their misgivings... as if they even had a choice.

What transpires is somewhat expected, but not for the reasons you might think. And that is smart. And the film moves forward without lumbering or becoming particularly tedious, another plus. The story is well told, and the undercurrent is well executed and ever present throughout, also a good thing. It is well acted, regardless of what you may think of the lead actor outside her performances.

The four stars is due to some predictability, perhaps because we know the outcome - or at least we THINK we know the outcome - which doesn't reach its inevitable conclusion in quite the way we thought, which is a good thing.

Now, as long as they don't blow the final two part conclusion (think how they completely destroyed the Matrix trilogy before the end of the second film, rendering the third film equally unwatchable), this now four film saga will be among the better science fiction sagas to come down the pike in a very long time.

And that, indeed, is something I anticipate with great joy.",1414627200,,1750,4.5396825396825395

6010063,2,B00FL31UF0,"Guys please stop giving a rip off from multiple original ideas 5 stars. The author of this book ripped off battle royale put it in to her book, then sprinkled some of her ideas in.
I cant ""technically"" call this plagiarism because of the slightly different settings and slight differences like the relationship of the characters but anybody who watches the movie with half a brain can obviously see that hunger games is nothing original.

I gave it 2 stars because i take thievery seriously, and the original creator of this idea Koushun Takami the author of battle royale worked on this it took him decades of his life to work on that book, to say the least He worked hard on it. and here comes Kollins ripping it off.
Whats worse is i see major websites like business insider, writing articles that point out very small differences of the two books/movies.

So remember guys if you can find a good idea from a foreign country just copy it and change somethings around and you got yourself a novel. and thieves will gather all around and philosophise on how its not stolen

Katniss comes off as pouting, selfish, and spoiled during the tour rather than a young women who is desperate to save her family and friends.  By the time we are in training and then in the arena, things seem back to normal and she does a brilliant job of portraying Katniss.  The other acting is really well done, but let's face it, Lawrence has to carry the cast and for the first half of the movie, she just doesn't.

Still it's a great rental, especially while it's free on Prime and a great way to ""prep"" for watching the new movie which comes out soon. Hope you enjoy!",1414540800,,768,4.380281690140845

6010230,3,B00FL31UF0,"It's easy to become distracted during the first twenty minutes of the movie, or even fall asleep. Had I not seen the first Hunger Games movie I would have been bored.... and confused.
During some part of the second half, the tempo does pick up with a bit more action which helps drown out the over dialoged scenes of each actor portraying a glorified version of themselves.
And, as many sequels, the original was far better. You would expect something a little more unexpected or unpredictable, but sometime all movie makers have to do is split a story, show it twice, double the profit.
I almost dozed off toward the end, only to see Jennifer Lawrence had also awaken after a three day coma state. I sympathized with her confusion.... is it over?

6010293,5,B00FL31UF0,"Jennifer Lawrence brings the reluctant heroin of this dystopian series alive, displaying the full range of emotions one would expect of an young lady caught in the vice of world changing events. The story, itself a profound reflection on a future we may be hurtling toward unaware, is prophetic in the old definition of the word: it's a cautionary tale of what happens when people crushed under tyranny reach the breaking point. Having read the books, I can tell you the movies were surprisingly loyal to the author's vision, and this second part of the trilogy is full of as much tension, drama and excitement as the first.

Admittedly, Lawrence was the scene stealer for me, though it was the supporting case that made her role seem so smooth and effortless. As movies are a team accomplishment, I offer kudos to all involved. And I'll be keeping my eye on Lawrence, a young lady who promises to be the type of actress that can disappear into her role as easily as Charlize Theron, and who offers a strong, independent role model in her real life as well. This is one of the handfull of movies I'll be able to watch over and over again through years and still enjoy.",1414368000,,1168,4.588516746411483

Peeta acting like a whiny little girl the whole time cause katniss doesn't love him like he loves her. Katniss acting like the hungar games was so difficult cause she had to kill some people.

It did show a perfect representation of our growing empty, stupid society that were almost exactly like and is heading towards with the phoniness and lies that dominate that culture.
Finally, the end was terrible and should have just announced, ""stay tuned for part 3"" if you want to see anything.
Finally, Jennifer Lawrence is one of our best actress's we've produced in years and even she can't do what she does best in this series of ""made for kids films"" everyone cashes in on.

6010427,5,B00FL31UF0,"Of course you'd need to see Hunger Games before Catching Fire. I do notice a change in directing styles between the 'Hunger Games' director Ross / crew and 'Catching Fire' director Lawrence / crew, a disappointment was director Lawrence's mess-up of Effie Trinket's wardrobe: overdone? (yes in Effie's character), high fashion? (no, the gaudy designs were amateur), and her brainless capitol nuance self was killed in the mis-directed reaping of victors scence. Despite her sympathy for Katniss in the book, she would always present her haughty-self (manners!), or for comic relief Effie could have tripped on the stairs, the hiss at the laughing crowd. Lawrence blew it. Also, the three-fingered support starting with Katniss' mom seemed contrived. In comparison, the first Hunger Game reaping scene is classic.

Scrutinizing the IMAX screen view used throughout the arena scenes, My Sony BDP-S360 blue ray player with the latest version 14 update shows additional view using the full sceen height on my 1080p screen, but the arena clock's circumfrence occupies nearly the entire width of my screen versus Amazon Prime arena widescreen shows ample greenery on each side of the 'clock'. At times, I prefer not losing the widesceen horizontal view vs. gaining vertical info, example: the beach kissing scene. Like many blue ray movies, the IMAX views are pseudo IMAX, a true IMAX screen shows extra vertical view without expense of the horizontal view. I'm assume that my blue ray player update is up to the task, but blue ray playback standards might NOT be standard. Also, IMAX theater screens are likely not sized proportional to home HDTV's.",1414022400,,1644,5.180451127819549
6010428,4,B00FL31UF0,The revolution ramps up and the mockingjay revolutionaries come together at high levels to fight the brutal dictatorship in this well done 2nd installment. Katniss is more brooding than ever and Peeta has grown up as their relationship becomes complicated. This film does a great job of completing the first movie and setting up the 3rd.

6010482,4,B00FL31UF0,This was a GOOD movie!!  My wife really liked it and she watch the whole thing without getting up to do anything!! (which is really saying something!)  The one thing I wish they had done was continue the story just a little bit more before ending it.  The abrupt ending not only left us hanging (not a bad thing) but it was done in such a way it did not set up the next movie.  I have NOT read the books so I do not know what is happening next but kinda have an idea.  I think the producers missed a chance to help set up the next movie.,1413244800,,537,3.889908256880734

It seems to me that every actor so perfectly portrayed his or her character that it was more like watching a real-life event rather than a movie.  There are no flaws.  From the moment this movie began until the final credits ended, I sat in my seat and just couldn't think about anything else.  This sequel was just astounding.

6010616,5,B00FL31UF0,"At my senior-ish age, I'm sure I'm outside the demographic the Hunger Games series was aimed at.  HOWEVER, I can't say too many good things about it:  action, adventure, good versus evil, an alternate world created and made believable, and characters of whom none are completely admirable.  Although no movie can be exactly like the book it is based upon, it was very well  brought to life in this film!  I can't imagine who, from whatever demographic, would not enjoy this movie.  Buy it!  Watch it many times over!  (I did!)",1410739200,,526,4.7032967032967035

Amazing character portrayal, superior computer graphics and Suzanne Collins' story bursts onto the screen with a vengeance in the second of the three Hunger Games installments.  Loved it all.  I would recommend it to anyone over the age of 12 due the nature of the material and some violent content, although some mature pre-teens might be ok with it.  I would advise parents to pre-screen it for themselves.  The acting on all accounts is superb.  If you have not seen ""Hunger Games"", then I would recommend seeing that first to get the backstory before watching Catching Fire.  And, it goes without saying (although I am saying it), watch ""Mockingjay"" to complete this series.",1410652800,,696,5.0

The digital copy is trash. Ultraviolet has changed their policy since the original Hunger Games movie came out. Apparently, Ultraviolet no longer allows for iTunes movie downloads. Instead, you can make an account for Ultraviolet AND one for one of their licensed outlets, download it through both services, then either download an app or get a SD copy on your computer (even for HD movies). THEN you can watch your movie.

6010744,4,B00FL31UF0,"I like the trilogy and it is moving into more and more dangerous territory, which is explored more in Mockingjay.

The dynamics between the characters feels genuine and though I have not read the first two books, i was intrigued by the overall story line. The four stars comes from the fact that the film follows a very predictable grand arc narrative: problem setup, preparation, execution with twists, and resolution in which the most loved characters are victorious. I know they were designed to follow the book, but why not make some twists?",1408147200,,484,4.987654320987654

6010818,5,B00FL31UF0,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is excellent! This is how the story goes: Katniss Everdeen has returned home safely after winning the 74th Annual Hunger Games along with fellow tribute Peeta Mellark. Winning means that they must turn around and leave their family and close friends, embarking on a ""Victor's Tour"" of the districts. Along the way, Katniss senses that a rebellion is simmering, but the Capitol is still very much in control as President Snow prepares the 75th Annual Hunger Games (The Quarter Quell), a competition that could change Panem forever.

The cast led by Jennifer Lawrence (terrific as usual as Katniss Everdeen), Josh Hutcherson (as Peeta Mellark), Liam Hemsworth (as Gale Hawthorne), Woody Harrelson (as Haymitch Abernathy), Elizabeth Banks (as Effie Trinket), Lenny Kravitz (as Cinna), Philip Seymour Hoffman (as Plutarch Heavensbee), Jeffrey Wright (as Beetee), Stanley Tucci (as Caesar Flickerman) & Donald Sutherland (as President Snow) is excellent. The directing by Francis Lawrence is excellent. The screenplay (based on Suzanne Collins' novel, who also executive produced the film) by Simon Beaufoy & Michael deBruyn is excellent.

The music by James Newton Howard is excellent. The cinematography by Jo Willems is excellent. The film editing by Alan Edward Bell is excellent. The casting by Debra Zane is excellent. The production design by Philip Messina is excellent. The art direction by John Collins, Adam Davis & Robert Fechtman is excellent. The set decoration by Larry Dias, set designs by Alan Au, Jim Hewitt, George Lee, Karl J. Martin, Sheila Nash, Harry E. Otto & Easton Michael Smith, set dressings by Sam Carter, Mark Keever, Steven Ladish, Chris Larsen, Drew Meyers, Jason Negron, Ky Hoang Nguyen, Tripp Norton & Allyson Petty is excellent. The costume design by Trish Summerville is excellent. The special make-up effects by Ve Neill, Steve Winsett & Erin Draney is excellent. The stunts coordinated by Chad Stahelski & Sam Hargrave is excellent. The special effects coordinated by Steve Cremin is excellent. The visual effects coordinated by Joanie Croteau, Chad Hudson, Vanessa Joyce, Eunice Khoo, Anouk L'Heureux, Martine Losier, Karina Mariano, Daniel Matley, Jessica Newhouse-Smith, Carol-Ann Ouimet, Laetitia Seguin & Adrian Steel, supervised by Paul Butterworth, Adrian De Wet, Thierry Delattre, Matt Dessero, Francois Dumoulin, Jeffrey Kalmus, Richard Martin, Stephane Naze, Janek Sirrs, Philippe Theroux, Marc Varisco & Guy Williams is excellent.

This is an excellent and well-crafted movie that is entertaining and intriguing. This is also an excellent sequel that is better than its original. Jennifer Lawrence, again, gives another terrific performance as Katniss Everdeen. Francis Lawrence takes over in the role of direction in place of the original's Gary Ross with excellence. This is one of the best movies of the last winter season and of last year, as well.",1407542400,,2930,5.435164835164835

This movie was dumb. I don't know why I thought this would be better than the first. I guess I was told that and I was probably having a Phillip Seymour Hoffman moment or something but again they managed to make a movie full of people I can't care about.

6010871,3,B00FL31UF0,"Sequels never live up.  For some reason they let Peta talk instead of just throw things and camouflage himself, which got him through the first Hunger Games.  Catniss was surprisingly vulnerable.  It reminded me of Colombiana when the badass assassin chick has problems with her boyfriend.  Well Catniss has TWO so it's even more annoying.  The relationships get in the way of the action and slow the story down.  So in summary Catniss gets her ass handed to her mentally and physically but pulls it together just in time to hint at another sequel.

6010879,5,B00FL31UF0,"I was glued to this movie from start to finish, like the first.  This movie is so true to life, in a lot of ways.  You have the people wanting to revolt against the 1%, but they need something, someone to believe in.  In this case, the warrior, hero, and savior is in the form of a female - Katniss Everdeen.  She's still finding herself, as she hasn't quite come into her power yet.  In this movie she's still naive.  Again, this is one of those movies, where you have an evil dictator manipulating and controlling those around him, or trying to.  He's very insecure, and he knows the people are restless and that his time is up.

Filmed in Hawaii, this game, the 3rd-25th anniversary game, has new rules.  Katniss and her allies see patterns and tries to adapt to them, but the game master is in control and controls the game.  You have scary fog that kills, killer monkey-like creatures and more.  I was disappointed that the movie stopped where it did, but I would imagine that this movie could have easily turned into 4 hours instead of 2 and a half, so I understand why the movie stopped where it did, but it doesn't take away my frustration for closure or a clean ending - URGH!",1406592000,,1185,4.365296803652968

Here, she's not just a sister and daughter; she's the symbol of hope for thousands of oppressed people in Panem. She's more emotional than Katniss is in the books, but I think that it was good cinema. The places where they diverged from the book added to the story, except for the part where Peeta's parents aren't there.

I actually like this one better than the first one-more intense and a darker plot going on in the background you weren't really privileged to in the first movie. With Hoffman dead in real life, they have the arduous task of replacing him.

There's a chance that it is leading up to a a really good conclusion in the next of the trilogy - at least this one sets the stage for some big changes to come.

I can take a little of it when the need is there, but come on guysget a TRIPOD! In terms of the movie itself, it's a continuation (of course) from the first film and holds up well to the stylistic designs of the first film. I think the acting has improved vs. the original. Blu-ray quality is excellent both visually and aurally, and there are some decent special features. The ultraviolet streaming version looks pretty good in HDX (top quality) if your home's Internet connection is fast enough to deliver it. Otherwise, it's okay, but doesn't come close to the blu-ray in quality.",1405036800,,740,4.7

6011041,1,B00FL31UF0,"You can see why it went so quickly from theater to DVD.  I guess if you are around 12 it would be the best thing ever, but having read the book I thought it stunk! The plot is poorly developed, the acting was wooden, and if you hadn't read the book you wouldn't have any idea what was going on.
Okay, in all fairness, there were some good points.  But why suddenly introduce the extreme amount of coolness between Katness and Peeta.  That was barely alluded to in the first film but, whoa, they hate each other in this film?  What's up with that?  And this film implies that Katness had two lovers, Peeta and Gale.  The book makes this much clearer.  The relationship with Gale was strong but they were not lovers. Also the relationship with Petta was more like gradual acceptance.  She does not suddenly take him to bed  The kissing with Gale and taking Petta to bed is too confusing. It happens in the book but in a much difference context. The sudden takeover of district 12 was also much clearer in the book.  The scenes in the arena make no sense and even though we know there's another movie in the trilogy what kind of ending was that?  The gamemaker is suddenly on the good side?  And the comment by Haymitch, ""That's why we don't let you make the plans"", is in context in the book, but what does it mean in the movie?.
The book ""Catching Fire"" is excellent, perhaps the best of the three.  It is rich in plot development, the characters, especially Haymitch, are much more real, and the arena makes more sense.

A couple of more comments-
How come the picture of Rue is still on the floor when the book makes it clear it was cleaned up and the writing ""Senna Crane' Is barely visible on the dummy.
I agree with President Snow.  Nope!",1404864000,5,1742,4.34984520123839

6011149,5,B00FL31UF0,"Although fictional the viewer has to come to grips with the reality of our life in relation to others.

I suggest watching the first picture ""The Hunger Games"" before watching this movie for a better understanding.

It is an enjoyable story that can move your emotions to see how unfair life can be for both rich and poor, privileged and distressed, or the elite in society and the common person. Whatever situation you live in, you will be force to ask yourself, is the life I am living in relation to others living in other locations (city, country, continent) acceptable?

Indeed it is worth your time to purchase. Then like me you can watch it at your leisure and pick up where you left off wherever you are located.",1404000000,,720,4.565891472868217
6011150,5,B00FL31UF0,"Step above the first one just like the book was.
I hope the last two movies don't go the same way as the last book because it really went downhill in my opinion. Stories are supposed to have a climax then ending but this last book was just a long anticlimax.",1403913600,,258,4.078431372549019
6011151,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie was amazing. It was the 7th time I've seen it and it never gets old. I love how it stays so true to the book. The acting is AMAZING,  the visuals and costuming fits perfectly for everyone, and the fact that the movie really sets the tone about rebellion and government is absolutely wonderful. It is such an improvement from the shaky cam disaster that we would call the Hunger Games.  All of these things really support the movie, but the thing that really made the movie what it was was the score. For me, the best pieces was The Fog, especially when they start playing the definitely improved piece called The Reaping from the Hunger Games.  My other favorite would have to be Arena Crumbles.  It is so emotional and it gives me chills every time I hear it. I would definitely recommend listening to them on Youtube. I also love the continuing Katniss theme, The Tour, and Let's Start.
Definitely worth a watch, but although the first movie is definitely worse, you need to watch it before this one.",1403913600,,1013,4.51912568306011

It was interesting enough though that I wanted to watch the second one, and I found that one better. Maybe the first one was just as good but I just needed to understand the storyline better. I'm not sure, but I switched to this movie after trying to watch ""Her"" with Joaquin Phoenix, and that movie was raunchy and boring, so The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was a great relief and this time I felt more of a connection to the characters and look forward to the third movie.",1403654400,,603,4.252173913043478

Evil never feels.

Hope remains in the new dawn.

They fixed the CGI problems from the first movie, and I think all the actors delivered a stronger performance this time around.  I found myself empathizing with Effie Trinket, of all people, and I didn't anticipate that at all.

I guess the producers predict I'll be impatently waiting for the next movie to come out so I can once again get back to living my life. Yeah right. It may just be me but in some scenes Jennifer Lawrence looked a little heavy. Perhaps it's intended because she won the last game and to the victors go the spoils. So let's eat.

The plot was somewhat different, which made it interesting; not just a repeat of the first installment, & seemed to be more thoughtfully written.  I liked the personal interactions of the characters, as they battled not only each other, but the ""system"" & what it was doing to their society.  To me, I saw parallels to what is going on in the Middle East, with innocent people suffering at the hands of corrupt leaders.  There is deeper psychological meaning to these movies than may meet the eye of a casual viewer, & I encourage some thoughtful introspection on what you have seen, & how it relates to our world now, & how we interact with one another.

6011280,2,B00FL31UF0,Disappointing  sequel. after the first. Critics recommended this FOR YOUR INFO. Sequels are usually weak as is this one. Michael,1402185600,,128,5.4

6011284,5,B00FL31UF0,This second hunger games movie is even better than the 1st.  I had already rented it and loved it so decided to get my own blu-ray copy.  I watched it again tonight and can't wait for the next sequel the Mockingjay.,1402185600,,215,4.219512195121951
6011285,5,B00FL31UF0,I found the movie very upbeat and with lots of action to keep you entertained with excitement for the next film. Unlike the last film this was way more closer to the book and showed and explained lots of detail. But like most films these days it leaves you at a large liff hanger. Love this movie and is good for the whole family. This movie also has you on your seat excitement that leaves you wanting for more. I hope you enjoy it!

6011289,5,B00FL31UF0,"The first half of the movie was more interesting to me, because it delved much deeper into the politics of the dystopian kingdom of Panem, where a totalitarian central government lords it over the capitol and 12 districts...the mysterious 13th District having been reportedly destroyed. We learn from President Snow (a menacing Donald Sutherland) that there may be a ground swell of rebellion in some of the districts..and that Katniss Everdeen is a source and inspiration for rebellion. So Katniss has to walk on thin ice, so to speak, while carrying on her bogus relationship with Peeta Mallark, and hiding her true feelings for Gale Hawthorne. Yet it appears that no matter how careful she is, her life and those who are nearest to her are still in jeopardy. This is an exceptionally well made follow-up to ""The Hunger Games"", and is adapted from the second book in the trilogy by Suzanne Collins. Jennifer Lawrence reprises her Katniss Everdeen characterization; and as with all her performances I've seen, she totally immerses herself in the character. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth also reprise their characters of Peeta and Gale and do well. Woody Harrelson is back again, perfectly cast as Haymitch; as is Elizabeth Banks as the silly but loyal Effie Trinket. As for new characters, look for Phillip Seymour Hoffman, in a superb performance as the Master of the Games, Plutarch Heavensbee; and Jena Malone as the cunning, Johanna Mason, one of the tributes allied with Katniss and Peeta during the Quarter Quell games, which pits former Hunger Games victors against each other. The movie ends rather abruptly and you'll be left hungering for more...never fear, two more films are planned to portray the events in the third book, ""Mockingjay""",1402012800,2,1754,5.051724137931035

6011293,5,B00FL31UF0,Interesting movie. Didn't expect the ending but it left the door wide open for the next one. I am thinking that I like the movies so well that I may want to read the books.,1401926400,,172,3.942857142857143

6011295,5,B00FL31UF0,I saw this movie the first time in the theater on the big screen.  I really enjoyed watching it a second time because there was so much more to see that I missed in the first movie.  And I think it becomes clear that this movie is about corporatism and what a ruling oligarchy will do to retain power... so much more of this came out the second time as I watched beyond the immediate action.,1401926400,,391,4.131578947368421
6011296,5,B00FL31UF0,My son has already read the books so I bought him the movie and he really likes it but he says the books are a lot better!,1401926400,,122,3.5555555555555554
6011297,5,B00FL31UF0,Amazing sequel to Hunger games. Casting is so well done that the characters are exactly as I pictured in my head. Can't wait for the next in the series.,1401926400,,152,4.275862068965517
6011298,5,B00FL31UF0,"I am thoroughly enjoying this series, from books to movies.  I look forward to the final two movies (I hope they are released as closely together as possible).  As soon as this set is available in it's 4-disc trilogy I will be buying the set.  I think the characters are excellent and the actors do a wonderful job of capturing those characters.  Jennifer Lawrence owns the role.  I am okay with the male actors, although I didn't exactly picture the male leads as they look in the movies, but that's okay: they've made the parts their own.",1401926400,,540,4.525773195876289

I highly recommend watching the movie on Amazon Instant video, worked perfectly with no buffering.

6011302,3,B00FL31UF0,"Mildly entertaining but unsatisfying.  I understand it is part of a series, but this installment seemed like one big intro to the next installment.  Felt like a ripoff.",1401840000,,168,4.964285714285714
6011303,5,B00FL31UF0,"This product performs admirably. The movie is, indeed, on the disc. That was really the main concern I had when I put it in the player was that the movie would not be there, or perhaps a different movie would be on there, but my concerns were not founded. The second movie in the Hunger Games quartet played perfectly. And it comes with a back-up DVD copy so I can watch the movie on my laptop while watching it in the BluRay player! And with the UltraViolet digital version, I can watch it on my tablet. Three versions of the same movie playing all around me may seem excessive, and it is. But buy this BlueRay, and you have that exact option.",1401840000,,644,4.286885245901639

6011305,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie felt short, but considering that it's mainly a bridge to the more exciting events to come, I still enjoyed it. The acting was well-done and the director followed the book rather well. I definitely recommend this movie for dystopia fans",1401840000,,246,4.880952380952381

6011307,1,B00FL31UF0,The movie kept buffering and I couldn't even watch a full minute. I gave up watching because it was way too frustrating.,1401840000,,120,4.5
6011308,5,B00FL31UF0,"They really did an amazing job capturing not only the story but the feeling of the book.  With such an epic tale, it's always important to remember your viewers are also your die-hard readers and are depending on the director, producers, editors and actors to make the view they had in their head while reading, come alive onto the screen.  These first two films have done just that, and I'm confidant the next two will be the same.  I'm anxiously looking forward to the next installment in Katniss's journey!",1401840000,,509,4.696629213483146

6011310,3,B00FL31UF0,I thought this second episode was a little better than the first one. It left me hanging to see the next one. Has more politics thrown in but the action picked up a bit toward the end. Lots of surprises in the Reaping.,1401840000,,218,4.093023255813954
6011311,4,B00FL31UF0,"I really liked the first one, it was unique, which for this day and age is saying something. I really like lionsgate, I loved the saw movies. I wasn't as impressed with the second one. Thou I did like it. SPOILER ALERT:: I called it from the start of the movie that the guy runing the games was in on the revoluation, the way he was talking to Catness, it just gave it away. My big problems with this movie. I never really beleived that Catness and Petta really loved eachother. In the first one they used his affection for her to try and set them up to kill eachother in the end. However I never really beleived that Catness really had any feeling for Petta it seemed mostly the other way around. I don't like Petta I think he is a 5th wheel. In the first one he had cool como and he was trying to survive on his own, but in this one he is just pathidic. He doesn't have a cool weapon, or any special ability. Catness is the kickass zena warrior with the godly bow, and the amazing quiver that never runs out of arrows. I thought the writers never got a hand of Catness Charecter, in the first part of the movie she was cold, devoted to her orginal bf, and I felt that was more of her charecter, but towards the end she was just a crying, whining, and it was a drastic change that I didn't get into. I felt Jennifer Lawrence was good but the writers never got a strong hold on the charecter. I thought they had a good idea at the start of the movie when Catness accidently killed the guy while hunting was a really good idea. It has the ablity of derailing the whole revaloution, but they never used it. The Pressident could have found out and used it to blackmail her. I hope they don't forget about it for the third movie.

All that said, I did really like the movie. I liked seeing the people fight back. When it comes to a sudden suprise ending with a twist, linonsgate always delivers on that one. I see lionsgate movie and I just expect a crazy twist from someone that sat through all the saw movies. I thought the story was well done, it really did a good job of making you feel for the people, and set up the revolt well. It was exciting and kept you on the edge of your seat, for all around I felt it was well done. I am very excited to see how the third movie is done and how it will end. I hope for a really great ending with a sedistic twist. All around if you liked the first one, I would check this one out.",1401753600,,2422,4.077568134171908

6011314,4,B00FL31UF0,"Having not read the books and not having loved the 1st movie, was pleasantly surprised to find the 2nd installment better than the first. Bit of an annoying cliffhanger ending but solid flick.",1401753600,,192,4.848484848484849
6011315,5,B00FL31UF0,"2nd Hunger Games movie, again maybe a little slow or because I read the books first.  I Loved the books!!",1401753600,,105,4.25
6011316,4,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed this second in the series as it too stayed pretty true to the book. Yes, it is rather ghoulish, but it is not unrealistic in the way society in the world twists and turns. The acting is quite good as these characters are not quite as innocent and appealing as in the first story. They are now more brutal and more used to what is expected of them. Maybe they are becoming a little PTS'd or a lot! I never finished the 3rd book. It just really started to get to me.....the coldness of the government, the helplessness of the people and the children. I will be curious to see how it turns out, but I can almost figure it out. I will want to see if I am correct.",1401753600,,669,4.075757575757576

6011319,5,B00FL31UF0,"Loved the books.  Rarely is the moving as good as the book, but I must say in this case, it is.  Of course you don't get as many of the details but somehow you don't feel like there is a huge piece of the puzzle missing.  Beautifully captured....amazing cinematography.",1401753600,,269,4.448979591836735
6011320,4,B00FL31UF0,"This movie takes the story deeper and brings out more social/political themes, but through the story rather than preaching. Stronger dramatically, a tighter storyline, and good action.",1401667200,,184,5.851851851851852
6011321,5,B00FL31UF0,Catching Fire was not the same as the first movie but the ending left you reaching and trying to extend the movie to see the future plot. Waiting for the third movie will require watching the first two to refresh the plots and prepare yourself for what is coming. i could not have second guessed what happened. I enjoyed the movie and am waiting for the next installment.,1401667200,,371,4.470588235294118
6011322,4,B00FL31UF0,"This one I found a lot more enjoyable. My 13 year loved both movies and is eagerly waiting for the 3rd to come out. I would seem this type of movie is all the rage right now. Divergent, Warm Bodies, I am Legend,  the world post some apocalyptic catastrophe were humans are living in walled cities fearful of what lies outside the walls.

This movie like the last movie was a game of survival, 24 people pitted against each other, only 1 is suppose to survive. The sects are rebelling, there is a love story twist too.

This one is a pretty good movie, I would recommend watching it. even owning it. If you're a fan of the first than you will probably like this one even more.",1401667200,,675,4.2578125

Kateness' relationship with Senna is true, but the poor thing is used by the author, in which the author actually tortures, and torments the reader.

6011353,3,B00FL31UF0,"On the plus side this is a faithful rendition of the book and the cast generally shines again. Jennifer Lawrence is once more breathtaking as Katniss Everdeen. Woody Harrelson (Haymitch), Donald Sutherland (President Snow), Lenny Kravitz (Cinna), Elizabeth Banks (Effie) and Stanley Tucci (Caesar) deliver star power superbly. A nice surprise is Josh Hutcherson upping his game as Peeta.

On the negative side Liam Hemsworth is still a dud as Gale, but mercifully his role is cut versus the books. It is also difficult to see where in the movie they spent the bigger budget. Many of the sets still look amateurish. The biggest negative that the movie cannot overcome however is that this is easily the worst book of the trilogy, especially with the repetition of the first, and as a faithful rendition, the movie is severely encumbered by it.

Rent it!",1401408000,,852,4.951048951048951

6011356,4,B00FL31UF0,"Overall, I liked this movie.  I really like the Hunger Games trilogy of books, and have been impressed overall with the two movies I've seen, and look forward to the first half of Mockingjay.  The reason I only give it four stars is because I think this version moves too quickly to really develop characters the way that they are in the first book.  I would not have been sorry to have seen Catching Fire broken into two movies, or at least a longer first movie.  It's hard for me to tell if this is only because I have read the book a couple of times and know it well, or whether this is the impression that non-readers of the trilogy will have.

Overall, the cast does a fine job of acting.  This is an entertaining movie, and I recommend it to anyone who likes action movies, dystopian themes, or watching women in a leading role.",1401408000,,834,4.314102564102564

It's scarey to think that this type of movie could just be a glimpse of what could be in store.

6011372,4,B00FL31UF0,"I have read the entire series. While different (as expected) the movies stick close enough to be entertaining.  I love the chemistry between Katniss and President Snow! It's not hard to feel the animosity between them.  Gale's character in the movie annoys me almost as much as he did in the books, and Peeta is played very well.  The actors did a superb job making their characters believable and even likeable in their own ways.  There were times when the script slowed the momentum a bit much, which is why I gave it 4/5 stars.

I do have one rather silly thing to point out.  In the first movie, they got Buttercup's  (the cat) color wrong.  I kept thinking; ""how hard is it to find a dirty orange-ish cat?"" Yeah, I know. It is a goofy thing to get annoyed over, especially when there are other events I initially thought ""it didn't happen that way"" with.

Every 25 years is a ""Quarter Quell"" and this one is being used to take down Katniss, now the symbol of rebellion.

The action is well-handled, the supporting cast of victors (Mags, ""Nuts"", ""Volts"", Johanna and Finnick each are well-cast, well-scripted and make for an exciting ensemble cast.) The character of the new Gamesmaster Plutarch Heavensbee is excellent. The late Philip Seymour Hoffman plays him a bit ambiguously. Is he on the side of Snow, a sadistic creator of impossible-to-win situations, or is he secretly sympathetic with the rebels? He was perfectly cast and it's a shame he died before completing the next film (Mockingjay) though he did shoot a fair number of scenes. A loss of a talented actor.

My only complaint is similar to the one I have now in the trend to serialize novels. It ends on a cliffhanger and of course we're waiting for the next film. I just don't think it makes a standalone film to end on a surprise note and such unfinished business. But never mind, the third film is on the way and I'm certain it will be as good or better than ""Catching Fire.""",1400889600,2,1446,4.622568093385214

This movie could have done more to underscore that theme.  It is, however, a fairly faithful adaptation of the book, which pleases fans of the franchise.

6011482,1,B00FL31UF0,"the first 40 minutes of the movie WILL put you to sleep. All they do for the first 40 minutes is mope around and talk about how sad they all are...i literally was falling asleep and took the movie OUT of my dvd player and put in something else. Went back another night to finish watching and then, once the movie FINALLY started to pick up there was a re-lapse of more boring scenes!...on a long train ride and the characters were acting all bored like ""what are we going to do on this boring long train ride to the capital?"" The move was boring, the characters were acting bored cause they *were* and then, as if thats not bad enough we have to listen to all the Victors crying and whining and complaining about not wanting to die and having to fight again...so, once the ACTION finally does start we (the audience) have already been bored to death, then whined at by all the cry-baby Victors...so much so that I WISH I WAS GOING TO BE SLAUGHTERED IN THE ARENA JUST TO END MY BOREDOM OF HAVING TO WATCH THIS MOVIE. They didn't *have* to set the stage for the movie (was already done in the first, and done much better) and re-hash every scene leading up to the arena battle...The entire movie is a bad and short re-hash of every scene from the first movie, and done in a less excitng and less polished way (they figured since you saw the first movie you can fill in the blanks with what you already know, but then why re-do all the same exact scenes in the first place but in a crappier way?). IT makes no sense. Ironically the best scenes you will find in the ""deleted scenes"" section of the Dvd. And then...THE ENDING...they were building up to a huge climax and then...you saw the credits on the screen...it was over...they wasted too many minutes of run time filming boredom and rehashed scenes of things that already happened in the first movie (combined with the first 40 minutes of nothing) that the 2 hours were up and they couldn't show you the climax. I buy a lot of movies and this one is the worst one i have seen in years and years. Buy and watch the first one and skip this one, not even worth $5., and it costs $20. If they actually make a 3rd one which has the ending of this 2nd movie in it...it *might* be good...but to me that will be the Hunger Games 2 and this will be something to forget exists. They figured that since the first movie was so successful that they could just make another much lower quality carbon copy of the first movie with nothing new...when something new and exciting finally was going to happen, the credits came up and...THE END. They had a good cast and probably a high enough budget to make something good...WHY DIDNT THEY? They don't even show any flattering scenes of Jen...i mean really...Everyone knows she is hot (and so is the other girl with the Axe), why not show off her body in the form-fitting combat suit...just a little, nothing crazy, just show a full body shot of her walking in the suit instead of super zoomed in head shots all the time.

6011486,1,B00FL31UF0,I read the first book and watched the first movie and thought it was highly predictable and had huge gaping logic holes (I thought the movie was actually better than the book in this regard).  I found the second movie (I skipped the book) even moreso.  I rarely turn off movies before the end but I did with this one - I kept watching until the games were well underway but it just never got any better.,1400112000,2,403,4.220779220779221
6011487,5,B00FL31UF0,One of the best movies based on a novel I've ever seen!! Very accurate and they did a fantastic job keeping to the original book.,1400112000,,129,4.2
6011488,4,B00FL31UF0,"As usual, I liked the first one better but it was still entertaining. They could have done something better at the end to make you feel like something really important happened instead of same ol, same ol thing.",1400112000,,211,4.578947368421052

6011491,4,B00FL31UF0,I watched this movie in the theater and was like 'OK'.  But when this movie came out in digital copy I jumped at the chance to purchase it. I love Katnis and everyone in the movie but if they follow the books I will cry.,1400112000,,220,3.888888888888889
6011492,5,B00FL31UF0,Very good Movie. I read the book over a year ago before watching and they did they're best to stay true to that transcript in my opinion. Good Watch.,1400112000,,149,4.172413793103448
6011493,4,B00FL31UF0,I like this movie and I particularly like Jennifer Lawrence.  It's a decent story that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I'll buy the third installment when it's released since I'm sure it's in the making.,1400112000,,208,4.447368421052632

6011495,5,B00FL31UF0,I loved Catching Fire! In my opinion it's better than the first one. Finnick and Johanna are my favorite characters in this movie. They're so badass!,1400025600,,149,4.769230769230769
6011496,5,B00FL31UF0,"Better acting, better story-telling, better effects, and a more enjoyable cast of characters! I wholeheartedly enjoyed this movie and eagerly await the third installment. Though portions of this movie repeat the same sort of stuff as the first one, it's different enough to still be exciting, and the developments and undercurrents that are building up in the story make it even more intriguing than the first movie. Unlike the first movie, this one ends with a cliff-hanger, of sorts, and it's just perfect. Can't wait to see the next one!",1400025600,,540,5.011111111111111

6011501,5,B00FL31UF0,"I really enjoyed Catching Fire and the price here on Amazon was several dollars cheaper than in stores.

This movie is a great step up from The Hunger Games.  The cast and their performance improved.  The director did a great job blending action and emotion.  Very well done!",1400025600,,275,4.666666666666667

6011510,5,B00FL31UF0,Best ever new idea and not one off Hollywood's cliches. Fresh and simple. It  makes you think about how greedy and selfish some people can be.  How in today's world people can be used as marionettes and almost get away with it. The more hardship people experienced in life there true character will be revealed. It is so sad to see that life seems to be so unfair and people are unable to make there own choices. This movie allows you to experiencing every emotion capable in a human being Good Or Bad.,1399939200,,502,4.387096774193548

6011517,4,B00FL31UF0,"While hot, the movie was not on ""fire.""

As with the first, this second in the Hunger Games series boasted excellent special effects and sets, a plausible plot line, and was well acted.  I did thoroughly enjoy the film, but despite that, there was something missing.

I would recommend the movie to anyone who is a sci/fi fan.",1399939200,,326,4.586206896551724
6011518,5,B00FL31UF0,Love that I got this when it was released and did not have to leave my house.  And the movie was AWESOME!!!,1399852800,,107,3.8636363636363638
6011519,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie is so good I almost wish I didn't watch it because now I can't wait to see the next one.,1399852800,,99,3.5454545454545454
6011520,5,B00FL31UF0,The movies were as good as the books usually not the case. Jenifer Lawrence is an awesome actress!!!!She does no wrong in any performance.,1399852800,,138,4.791666666666667
6011521,4,B00FL31UF0,"I have read all of the books, and completely fell in love with the concept of a world held hostage to a central capitol of excess and subterfuge. This movie was excellently directed and edited, leaving both my fiance (who has not read the books) and myself happy with the content. Unlike the first film that alienated many who hadn't read the books (so confusing without historical context!), this movie stood on its own merit.",1399852800,,427,4.706666666666667

Also as true to the book as time would allow, but still felt fast moving throughout. Some parts from the book that I thought would be important didn't seem to make it to the release cut for this movie, but its hard to present this type of book where the main characters thoughts are important to the plot. The length of the movie seemed deceiving as the action and plot kept moving. The ending leaves it more obvious of a next installment to come. I'll be looking forward to that as well, provided they can retain the same cast.",1399852800,,664,4.487603305785124
6011524,5,B00FL31UF0,"It isn't exactly like the books, but close. Some details have changed but I felt they were good changes. I really love the series and I appreciate how they put it into movie form.",1399852800,,179,4.294117647058823
6011525,2,B00FL31UF0,"Sorry but I'm rating this LOW due to the fact the movie would HARDLY play. It took at least 5-10 mins between each major scene for the movie to play. Also, before the purchase it didn't mention that while on mobile you have to have wifi. If I DIDNT have wifi (after I saw the description boldly states ""works on iPhones, androids, etc etc"") I would've been PISSED and got my money back!  But like I said, it's a great movie!!

6011528,4,B00FL31UF0,Good movie I was able to pick up on the theme without see the 1st movie.  Was a little slow,1399852800,,91,3.55
6011529,5,B00FL31UF0,As awesome as the first movie or perhaps a little better. Special effects were the best. Highly recommend purchasing. Can't wait for t he sequel.,1399852800,,145,4.84
6011530,4,B00FL31UF0,"I found the film much more engaging than the first, as the young actors came into their relatively new (at least at the time of the filming of the first film) careers and the story felt less like a youth fantasy fulfilment plot. I do feel it moves a little too fast at times, clearly a bit pressed for time and eager to jump to the excitement, but that is a difficult balance to pull off in all fairness.
Definitely a fun flick but nothing too spectacular.",1399852800,,456,4.252873563218391
6011531,4,B00FL31UF0,Well I've read the trilogy and I've seen the dyad. This movie is well made and very entertaining. While it wasn't as powerful as the first it is very enjoyable and true to the book.,1399766400,,181,4.2

6011539,5,B00FL31UF0,As you have been told this is better than the first. Jennifer Lawrence is beautiful and very talented (they will not hold her to this for long as she is that good). We will not see Hoffman again and he was great in this. I am sure none of us want to endure this type of world.,1399680000,,276,3.8596491228070176

Slightly predictable, but  that doesn't detract from the book or how it plays out. Hero's are hero's and villains are villains and the formula works.",1399593600,,349,3.9714285714285715

The special effects are extremely well done, and the high standards of acting set in the first movie are maintained in this one. The end of the second book was extremely frustrating to me unless you had the third book in your hands, but this movie has a better ending than the book by adjusting its scope ever so slightly.

6011605,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie is awesome. it was better than the first one. they did pretty good justice to the book. the only nit pick I have with the movie is that in the book katniss is in the woods by her dad's cabin and she runs into two people who are going to district thirteen and they explain the history of district thirteen and one had an injured leg. for those who have read the book you guys know what I'm talking about. I was mad that they left that out to me it was kind of important to the story. but other than that the movie was amazing and I can't wait until mockingjay comes out. if you have not seen this movie I recommend you do,1399161600,,631,3.9763779527559056

As a dvd that the manufacturer and studio wants you to buy.....the trend to stiff purchasers or play games by what outlet pays how much for a specific release with specific extras....well....it suffers.

6011618,5,B00FL31UF0,"I have heard rumors that this movie is based on the Korean drama Battle Royale. Whether that is true or not is not an issue because once I saw the first installment of this series, I was hooked. I was so hooked when I saw the first movie that I purchased the second movie as soon as it was available. I rarely ever do that! I love Katniss and the growth of her character from the first movie. She is more assertive and confident about who she is and more aware of how her actions affect the people around her. Most of the time the length of a movie proves to be detrimental; not so in this case. The time passed by and I hardly even noticed. The first movie left me wondering what would happen to Mr Snow, Katniss and her family and her love(s). I hope that this isn't a spoiler alert, but even if this movie (and most are) is a bit different from the books(which I haven't read yet), The series was so well done that I think that even the diehard bookfans would find it a little bit difficult to criticize too much.

6011624,1,B00FL31UF0,"What a pitiful tepid, boring, over-wrought story.  A shadow of the first one.  It drags on to make a bit over 2 hours seem like 5 hours of your life.  The new version of the star is too pitiful to carry on with.  Every significant event isn't a contest between the contestants, it is the result of interference of the game managers.  Which makes the 'combat' a farce in this farce of a tale.

The production values were great, the actors did a bang up attempt, but the direction and writing were beyond pathetic.  I tried to give it two stars, but no, everything else just more than subsumes any good of it all.  A pitiful waste really.  There are perhaps 10 clever minutes in the whole film.  I believe this may have ruined the entire Hunger Games series of movies for me.  I would only watch another if it is free, I am bored, and can find absolutely nothing 'potentially' interesting to do.",1399075200,4,893,4.384146341463414

(I can't say how I would have felt about it if I had never read the book...ok, maybe I can, it would STILL have been awful)  It's as if the producers said to Jennifer Lawrence ""we're going to make all three books into a movie, so you should probably take acting lessons for this second movie!) The movie was as compelling as the book.  It made you care about the characters and feel their emotions, something that I can not say for the first movie.  If you never read the book trilogy, I recommend skipping the first movie and figuring out the back-story from the second movie.  You'll save yourself 2 hours of your life and you'll enjoy the 2nd movie without hesitation.",1398902400,,786,4.461538461538462

6011648,5,B00FL31UF0,"I'm a pretty big Hunger Games book fan and I found this film installment to follow the book very well - which is impressive in my mind. It has been a while since I've read the books, so I cannot say for sure where things deviated, but nothing really stuck out to me (unlike other book-to-movies where obvious plots/information is missing/changed). The directorial style of F. Lawrence very closely resembled that of G. Roth in the first movie. Sometimes going between directors in trilogies is so noticeable that it seems like a completely different cast/crew/plot style/etc. This loses the flow between movies and it comes off as a disconnected plot. This was not the case for Catching Fire.

There is not much to say about the cast that has not already been said and noted. They are a great working bunch and it will be interesting to see how the progress into the next film(s), especially with the loss of the talented Mr. Hoffman.",1398816000,,934,4.695121951219512
6011649,3,B00FL31UF0,"Entertaining movie and enjoyed it with the family. A bit violent for younger ones though. Also thought the ending was weak, like it was obvious it was setting up for the next movie.",1398816000,,181,4.515151515151516
6011650,3,B00FL31UF0,"This arrived in perfect condition with no marks or damages. I bought it for my girlfriend as a birthday present and I myself didn't watch it as the trilogy doesn't interest me much. We've both read all the books and she said that, like the first, it stuck to the source material pretty well.",1398816000,,291,4.407407407407407
6011651,5,B00FL31UF0,"The movies are great, but the books themselves should be read, too. I love the strong heroine in this series. I think this one is my favorite of the three.",1398816000,,155,4.2
6011652,1,B00FL31UF0,Not nearly as good as the first movie. It also seemed to drag on which made it worse. Plus the story line was mixed.,1398816000,3,116,3.875
6011653,2,B00FL31UF0,"Sorry, this movie didn't even come close to the first one. Personally I thought it was boring and had a rather forced ending.",1398816000,,125,4.478260869565218
6011654,2,B00FL31UF0,"Facinating concept of a revolution. Effort made in character development, but fell flat too often (especially noted between Snow and Katnice). When LOTR drags things out, it at least does so in an interesting fashion. This felt too long in the building and too boring in the meantime for me to appreciate the action later.",1398816000,3,322,4.872727272727273
6011655,5,B00FL31UF0,great film,1398729600,,10,4.5
6011656,5,B00FL31UF0,"I've read all of the books and watched both the first and second movies multiple times, and appreciate both versions of the story. I think the movies capture the major plot points of the books without losing continuity in the storytelling. As with any book to screen adaptation, there are differences and some inconsistencies, but overall they've done a great job. Production quality of this film is up slightly from the first, and I continue to be impressed with the lead actors - some of whom I was a little concerned about when they were first cast, but those concerns have been pleasantly proven unfounded. Katniss' character on screen is less ""whiny"" than in the books, and I personally feel that she is a stronger character on screen. This can primarily be chalked up to the fact that the books (obviously, since they're told from her perspective) provide a much deeper look at her thinking and emotional struggles than can be directly translated on screen.

In short: Read the books *and* see the movies. They're both pretty awesome.

As far as Amazon streaming quality, I haven't had a problem yet. Great service and easy to purchase and watch. Only major con is that Amazon won't let me watch Amazon movies on my brand-spanking-new tablet. Frustrating, but I have faith that Amazon will evolve and it will happen eventually.",1398729600,,1333,4.842105263157895

6011658,5,B00FL31UF0,"Read all the books. Believe movie did a great job. Don't want to be overly detailed so, if you liked the first one, you'll enjoy the second. I personally think you need to see the first in order to fully appreciate the characters & story line.",1398729600,,243,4.304347826086956
6011659,5,B00FL31UF0,Loved the books the first movie was ok. This one was much better. Can't wait for the next movie to come out. I got this in the mail the day it came out in stores,1398729600,,161,3.6285714285714286
6011660,5,B00FL31UF0,well worth your time!  Does a good job of developing the underlying themes of the books - although i still highly recommend the books!,1398729600,,134,4.583333333333333

6011663,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie was way better than the book.  I really enjoyed the movie and now I can wait for the last of the series.  Just hate that they had to break it into 2 movies.....,1398729600,,171,3.857142857142857
6011664,4,B00FL31UF0,"It was good entertainment. Easy to follow even without reading the book, if you're just looking to be entertained and not worried about ""who's who"" and the history of the Hunger Games.",1398729600,,184,4.78125
6011665,4,B00FL31UF0,"I love the Hunger Games series.  They are wonderful action movies.  I was not thrilled with the ending of this movie, although they are longer movies so it had to end sometime I guess.  Loved the movie itself though!",1398729600,,216,4.487179487179487
6011666,3,B00FL31UF0,"I would have liked to see more plot development rather than just a rehash of the first movie.
I basically enjoyed it, but thought it could have been better..",1398643200,,157,4.448275862068965
6011667,5,B00FL31UF0,"This was a good Friday night rental, looking forward to the next movie.  Be sure to watch the first one or you will be a little lost.",1398643200,,133,3.925925925925926
6011668,5,B00FL31UF0,"Loved it, better than the first in the series. The characters are just heroic, brave, but still somehow real within the fantasy. It's not as brutal between the hunger game players which makes it more interesting to see how they work together. I can't wait for Mockingjay Part I.",1398643200,,278,4.6938775510204085

6011670,5,B00FL31UF0,"Excellent movie!  I would recommend that even if you have not read the books, you spend time watching this movie.",1398643200,,113,4.65
6011671,5,B00FL31UF0,"There's a lot of intrigue in the movie plot and lots of action. Katniss is still clueless and uninterested in the swirling discontent among the districts. She just wants to be home and live her life without contest or controntataion. But President Snow had other ideas as do some of the tributes in the sneaky way Snow wants to discredit or better yet eliminate her as a symbol. I loved the way some contestants pulled together in identifying the weak point in the arena and wreaking havoc on it. There I'll stop fo avoid a spoiler. What strikes me is the physical aspect and the strateic element developed along with the key trle of a couple of geeks. You need brains as well as brawn in the arena. I loved the ending and the change in the expression of Katniss' face once aboard the evac. I can't wait for the 2 concluding movies. My summer plan is to read Mocking Jay. Last summer I re-read Catching Fire and viewed, again, the first movie. It was worth it to appreciate the nuances in the movies telling of this middle story.",1398643200,,1029,4.449735449735449

6011673,5,B00FL31UF0,"Other than the fact that there are people killing one another and a corrupt government, how can you not like this movie.  Great action and adventure!  Amazing Special effects!!",1398643200,,176,5.0344827586206895
6011674,5,B00FL31UF0,"I am a follower of great sci-fi and the Hunger Games is awesome. No one ever expects a sequel to be as good as the original but this was outstanding. Fast shipping and nice packing.

6011678,1,B00FL31UF0,"Made the list of one of the most disappointing sequels.  The end was abrupt and left you with your mouth open saying ""thats it?  The money seen was a rip off and just ridiculous.  Very sad.",1398643200,2,189,4.194444444444445
6011679,2,B00FL31UF0,"OK, so I love, love, love the movie!!! But I did NOT LIKE the purchasing system.....I bought the movie, played it and figured, ""I'm going to wait and watch it the next day"".....I get on my account to play it and it says I don't have the movie anymore! I had to watch it within a 24 hour period from the point of playing it. I did not like this feature.......I therefore had to waste yet another $3.99 to rent it again! So, in the end, I wasted $7.98 to RENT this movie that I could only watch once.......",1398643200,,504,4.101010101010101

6011681,1,B00FL31UF0,I could only make it half way through the movie before the pain of boredom hit me in the face.  Very painful to watch.,1398643200,6,118,3.9166666666666665
6011682,5,B00FL31UF0,I have watched it several times and will likely watch it many more.  Always seem to recognize something new each time I watch.,1398643200,,126,4.478260869565218

6011685,5,B00FL31UF0,i really liked this movie! of course it had to end with a prelude to the next movie! really excited for the next installment!,1398556800,,125,4.25
6011686,1,B00FL31UF0,"Here we go again! ""Hunger Games Catching Fire"" offers the same cast, same storyline, same results. No surprises plot twists or anything refreshingly new about this film. Donald Sutherland is back with his constant bored expression (much like mine watching this DVD) as President Snow. Elizabeth Bank's acting talent is wasted on the cartoonish ridiculous character Effie Trinket, she resembles an over done Tinker Bell from the Disney films. Then we have Stanley Tucci as TV Host Caesar Flickerman who comes across like a overly tanned TV game show host on steroids.

Jennifer Lawrence gives it her best, but the script here is just so redundant and repetitive that it's a waste of time. These cardboard cartoon like characters go through the acting motions but are lost in a muddled script that can't save this film. The recently released DVD ""Divergent"" handles this subject matter with a much more mature script material and much more convincing acting. Or try finding the 2001 DVD ""Series Seven-The Contenders"" a bold realistic film that handles this material with such graphic reality you will actually believe that you are watching a real event not a film. In this film A TV program selects people at random to kill one another for fame and their freedom. Do not fall for the same Hollywood sequel garbage. Look for something new and different.

6011689,5,B00FL31UF0,"I really loved the Hunger Games books and have loved the movies so far. I liked that each of the two movies had a different feel to them, more in keeping with the events in the stories. Great series to get lost in and great food for thought.",1398556800,,241,4.041666666666667

6011691,5,B00FL31UF0,"Wonderful film. The cinematogrophy and special effects are just spectacular. To understand the plot watch/read the first Hunger Games movie/book. The film gives a cute ""behind the scenes"" expert of ""Divergent"". I would defiantly recommend this movie to a friend.",1398556800,,262,5.575
6011692,5,B00FL31UF0,I loved the book and I loved the movie.  Very true to the book and a lot of action.  Best part is that is was family friendly!,1398556800,,126,3.6296296296296298

6011695,5,B00FL31UF0,"It's a truism that most sequels fall a little flat, but I was pleasantly surprised to find that I enjoyed this one more than the first movie.  Characters were fleshed out just a little more, certain corny aspects were toned down, and my guess is that Lawrence had a slightly better grasp on the character.  Highly recommended.",1398556800,,326,4.701754385964913
6011696,1,B00FL31UF0,Of all the myriad nearly infinite futures front of us: this one is not very interesting. At the end of the movie I did not feel my time had been well spent watching it.,1398556800,2,168,3.9705882352941178
6011697,5,B00FL31UF0,"Saw this movie in the theater and knew I wanted to own it eventually! Received the Blu Ray in perfect condition in great time and have enjoyed it already. Not just a good movie for the book readers, but just a good overall movie in general.",1398470400,,240,4.239130434782608
6011698,1,B00FL31UF0,I am sure this is a good movie however we waited for ove 30 minutes for it to download and it did not. I 'm sure we are going to be wasting the rental fee because there is no other time we can watch this. I might have to go to RED BOX....far more reliable than my Amazon Prime!!!!!,1398470400,,281,3.7796610169491527
6011699,5,B00FL31UF0,"I Love these books, So usually the movie doesn't live up to the hype. Not here! The Movie is a great, it brings the book to life in a way that is respectful and true to the book!",1398470400,,178,3.710526315789474

6011701,5,B00FL31UF0,"This was a phenomenal movie and one that I truly want to add to my collection once it comes out on DVD!  Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent actress and she plays Katniss perfectly!  Catching Fire has a few plot twists and surprises that will leave you on the edge of your seat and her facial expressions at the end of the movie... confusion, sadness then rage.... MARVELOUS!  I'm already eagerly anticipating the third installment of the Hunger Games and once Amazon has the first and second as a combo pack, I'm purchasing it; no matter what!",1398470400,,542,4.625

6011704,5,B00FL31UF0,Most books are always better than the movie. The Hunger Games are exceptional. I have read all three books and patiently waiting for the third installment of the movie. Jen Lawrence is believable in her role as Miss Eberdeen and I cannot fathom the movie with any other leading actress portraying the part. Two thumbs up for Jennifer Lawrence as well as the Hunger Games written trilogy.,1398470400,,387,4.791044776119403
6011705,5,B00FL31UF0,Better than the first and follows the book soooo closely.  Really enjoyed it and can't wait until the next one comes out.

6011706,5,B00FL31UF0,"I mean, really. Who does not love the Hunger Games series? Well, admittedly, I liked the first book and movie better, but considering that I went online to see if I could buy the DVD of the second movie moments after leaving the theatre... obviously this one was well worth my time too. The product itself was great. I haven't invested the time in figuring out how to get the digital version downloaded, since I have the means to play the DVD itself, but I'm sure I'll get there eventually.",1398470400,,490,4.455555555555556

6011718,5,B00FL31UF0,"Love the originality of the story - I always recommend reading the book first, keeps me from getting a predetermined idea of the character's personalities. The book lets you imagine everything to start with. The producers of the movie did a great job sticking with the story and playing out the most important scenes.",1398384000,,317,4.888888888888889
6011719,5,B00FL31UF0,"This is what a 2nd act should be. In Hunger Games, we were introduced to the world, it's struggles, and the essential characters. It was also an intimate view of the struggles and growth of our main character. In Catching Fire, with introductions out of the way, the series is free to explore the growing unrest and shifting politics of the world beyond 1 person. Unlike in HG, the plot feels much bigger than our main character.

The big downside is you're supposed to feel the stark contrast between HG, where there were just 12-18 year olds fighting, and CF where there are people of all ages. The problem is, in HG, few young people actually looked young and few older people in CF actually looked older. Since most of your main characters in both films look 20-30, any intended contrast is lost.",1398384000,,800,4.594405594405594

6011722,5,B00FL31UF0,Great Movie!,1398297600,,12,5.5
6011723,5,B00FL31UF0,I normally do not care for dramas; however if you are someone who does this is all drama from start to finish. Just as a comedy should make you laugh from beginning to end or action should make you feel like the hero a drama should elevate your concern for the party(s) involved. Catching fire did that.,1398297600,,303,4.333333333333333
6011724,5,B00FL31UF0,Well i am a hard core fan of the hunger games so this review may or not may be objective. THIS MOVIE IS PERFECT.,1398297600,,112,3.7083333333333335
6011725,3,B00FL31UF0,Slow to get started - This movie was not as interesting of a story line as the first Hunger Games.,1398297600,,98,3.95
6011726,3,B00FL31UF0,"If you liked the books, this film stays on the plot line. I think they did a nice job with the venue but being a film they had to cut a lot of sub plots which doesn't really help hold the story together.",1398297600,,203,3.744186046511628
6011727,5,B00FL31UF0,It was a little hard to figure out but the timeline and the movie moved fast and was great to watch.,1398297600,,100,3.8095238095238093
6011728,3,B00FL31UF0,"I was increasingly annoyed by the book series - book 1 was on the high side of OK, but each successive book only gave me less empathy for the main character.  At least the movie seems to make her more likeable.  Jennifer Lawrence is not even close to pulling off the teenager depicted in the book series.",1398297600,,304,4.315789473684211
6011729,4,B00FL31UF0,Enjoyed the movie.  Amazon delivers as stated once again.  I can't imagine how anyone would appreciate the movies without having read the books--too many details missing.  They did a better job of portraying the people of the Capital than the previous flick.,1398297600,,258,5.095238095238095
6011730,5,B00FL31UF0,I'm a huge fan of the books and a huge fan of the movies. Now I can watch it anytime I want!,1398297600,,92,3.227272727272727
6011731,5,B00FL31UF0,I loved this movie and I have read the entire series.  I can't wait for the next movie to come out,1398297600,,98,3.6666666666666665
6011732,5,B00FL31UF0,"Need I say more, I mean really even if no one else appeared in this film wouldn't that make it worth your while?!",1398297600,,113,3.9565217391304346
6011733,1,B00FL31UF0,"The MOVIE gets a ""5"". Buy the movie, if your player can handle the disc. I have a BluRay reader that software uses to play the disc (not a hardware BluRay player). I understand _some_ hardware players have had issues with jumping between scenes, and that is what I got with my playing setup.",1398211200,,291,4.407407407407407
6011734,5,B00FL31UF0,jennifer Lawrence is my kind of partner if ever i was in a life dependent game. I know it's only hollywood but that what keeps us so entertained.,1398211200,,145,4.214285714285714
6011735,5,B00FL31UF0,The first episode was great. This unexpected 2nd is fully as great as the first. Two of the best movies I have seen in many years. I'm glad this brings these to mind because I know what I'll be watching in a few minutes.,1398211200,,220,4.0227272727272725
6011736,5,B00FL31UF0,"Awesome of Course, ending leaves you hanging. That's fine if you read the books.  Can't wait for the next one !",1398211200,,111,4.285714285714286
6011737,4,B00FL31UF0,"A little slow at times, this still builds the momentum of the first and keeps us involved in Katniss's story, and in the fate of the capitol and the districts, and their subjects and families. A very solid sequel that leaves us ready for the next. I like the way it delves into the psyche of the various wounded characters.",1398211200,,323,4.4
6011738,3,B00FL31UF0,I am really tired of these long drawn-out movie series. It is not okay to make people wait more than six months to see the next in a series especially when your second movie is rather lackluster. I didn't find a redeeming quality in this other than at the end when it becomes obvious that there is a resistance.,1398211200,,311,4.288135593220339
6011739,5,B00FL31UF0,Not only is Catching Fire a great movie but the DVD also has a bonus feature about the making of Divergent! Awesome!,1398211200,,116,4.318181818181818
6011740,3,B00FL31UF0,Bring on #3. This was great don't get me wrong... but I wasn't aware that this was leading up to number 3. I need the next one now,1398211200,,130,3.6785714285714284
6011741,4,B00FL31UF0,Love the movie - am disappointed that my digital copy via UltraViolet still requires an internet connection. I was hoping for a stand alone digital copy I could watch any time. My fault - I should have done more research into what UltraViolet really is.,1398211200,,253,4.644444444444445

6011744,5,B00FL31UF0,Better then the first one!! I've watched this at least 15 time and it still not old!!! The cast is amazing!!,1398211200,,108,4.190476190476191
6011745,5,B00FL31UF0,The second installment built upon the first movie and continued to excel in every department. Now fans are awaiting the revolution.,1398211200,,131,5.285714285714286
6011746,5,B00FL31UF0,"Great movie.  I read the books first, and thoroughly enjoyed this movie.",1398211200,,72,5.0
6011747,5,B00FL31UF0,Mostly in line with the spirit of the book and covered complex parts in an understandable way without slowing down the story.,1398211200,,125,4.7272727272727275
6011748,5,B00FL31UF0,"Just as good as the first movie. If you read the book, the movie brings it to life.  It will be interesting and can't wait until the third comes out.",1398211200,,149,3.966666666666667
6011749,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie has to be one of the best of the best. I have enjoyed it so very much. Waiting on pins and needles for the next 2 to come out. Little less than 6 months. Yippee. I pre-ordered the movie and received it the next day. Could not even get in line at a store to purchase, because there were hundreds of people doing the same. While in line I was told that there were not enough copies to make as far back as I was, and I had been sitting there for over 6 hours waiting, before I was informed I would not make it, so I just waited a couple of days and it came with my mail!!! Won't wait in another line, just to be turned away. From now on I will purchase online",1398211200,,667,3.8405797101449277
6011750,4,B00FL31UF0,"The movie is 100% from the book, down to some dialog.  My only reserve is that like the book, the movie is a bit wordy.  Much time is spent on social issues of little consequence.  But all in all, a great movie.  I look forward to the third movie.  Jenn Lawrence makes the movie the best.",1398211200,,288,4.071428571428571
6011751,5,B00FL31UF0,I read all of the books to this series and was curious how this installment of the saga would be done...the answer was VERY WELL! It stays close enough to the book a reader of the series should not be disappointed.,1398211200,,214,4.2439024390243905
6011752,3,B00FL31UF0,Upset that I had to pay for this twice because I was unable to finish it in one day. Ah well,1398211200,,92,3.4285714285714284
6011753,5,B00FL31UF0,Loved the book and loved the movie.  I liked it better than the first movie.  Can't wait for the last film.,1398211200,,107,4.0476190476190474
6011754,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie is just as good as the first one. Can't wait for the last movie/movies to come out. I should read the books as well but I will wait so as not to be too disappointed.,1398211200,,176,3.7837837837837838
6011755,4,B00FL31UF0,This movie was a lot like the book. I really enjoyed watching it and think it is a good movie.,1398211200,,94,3.75
6011756,5,B00FL31UF0,"5-Stars says it all. Not 4, but yes five stars!!! I missed the end cuz I fell fast asleep, sorry.",1398211200,,97,3.9
6011757,2,B00FL31UF0,Wasn't half as good as the first and ending sucked. I couldn't believe it was the end till credits started rolling...,1398211200,,117,4.619047619047619
6011758,5,B00FL31UF0,"Better than the first movie (though I loved that too, I think if you read the books you liked it...if not...probably not).  Good adaptation of a popular series.  Looking forward to the next two.  Of course, Jennifer Lawrence is awesome!!",1398211200,,237,4.875
6011759,5,B00FL31UF0,"GREAT movie, it follows the books almost perfectly which is something that i love to see when a book is made into a movie and this one did not disappoint",1398124800,,153,4.133333333333334
6011760,3,B00FL31UF0,"Is Hunger Games: Catching Fire a great work of art?  No.  But it is entertaining.  It is important to remember that the film version of the book, by the same name is a different medium and will have limitations.",1398124800,,211,4.358974358974359
6011761,5,B00FL31UF0,"This is an amazing movie! The drama, action, and acting are incredible. I loved it just as much as the first one, I think it was directed very well. Definitely worth buying for anyone who's a Hunger Games fan. It also follows the book fairly well.",1398124800,,247,4.391304347826087
6011762,5,B00FL31UF0,I was not able to open this as it was an US digital code which could not be opened when I returned to Canada. I returned the disc and will purchase in Canada. The movie (at the cinema was 5 stars!!!,1398124800,,198,3.8536585365853657
6011763,1,B00FL31UF0,"Not as good as the first one, I think this is one to watch a second time to soak in all the story.",1398124800,,98,3.3043478260869565
6011764,5,B00FL31UF0,"Couldn't ask for more when I preordered Catching Fire from Amazon! Not only did Amazon deliver right on time, but the movie itself is spectacular! Missed out on seeing it in theaters so blu-ray was the next best thing. =)",1398124800,,221,4.55
6011765,4,B00FL31UF0,"Very few movies are as good as the book, and this movie is no exception. The characters are well played but the movie suffers the common ""sequel"" effect: It is not as good as the first Hunger Games movie",1398124800,,203,4.230769230769231
6011766,2,B00FL31UF0,"I didn't like this one as much since it seems like Jennifer's angst over being in the games were a little over done. I get it, she didn't want to be there - like the rest of them - but her whining did get on my nerves after a while. I do hope the next movie will be better.",1398124800,,273,3.6440677966101696
6011767,5,B00FL31UF0,"I won't buy it if I didn't like it. There isn't much to say on movies. I liked it on the big screen and will still like it on my 60"". It came in tact in terms of packaging.",1398124800,,172,3.4358974358974357
6011768,5,B00FL31UF0,the books were good but it is always great to see the words come to life in the movies. ready for the end,1398124800,,105,3.608695652173913
6011769,5,B00FL31UF0,The Hunger Games is a great movie that I enjoyed very much. I wanted to have my own copy to watch at home.,1398124800,,106,3.652173913043478
6011770,4,B00FL31UF0,Who wraps a copper wire around an arrow and shoots it at a forcefield? Katniss. Boo Yah. Take that Capital.,1398124800,,107,4.4
6011771,4,B00FL31UF0,Not as good as the original but still pretty good. Leaving the ending the way they did set it up for future movies but didn't much care for being left hanging.,1398124800,,159,4.161290322580645
6011772,4,B00FL31UF0,The whole movie is long sad looks with rare scenes of her kicking ass. Long 2+ hours. The third book was the worst by far so may be done with this franchise.,1398124800,,157,3.9375
6011773,5,B00FL31UF0,"The movie kept my attention from the first frame to the last, the acting is superb and the storyline unfolds, with lots of exciting scenes and great costumes.  The contrast between the grossly over coloured, and synthetic city people and those in the districts is very striking.",1398124800,,278,4.914893617021277
6011774,4,B00FL31UF0,Jennifer Lawrence is an amazing actress.  I first saw her in Winter's Bane and was very impressed.  I'm sure she will star in many more movies.,1398124800,,143,4.461538461538462
6011775,1,B00FL31UF0,Second one was bad seemed very forced and unnecessary Story line was convoluted I hate when they do this all in the name of the almighty dollar,1398124800,,143,4.333333333333333
6011776,5,B00FL31UF0,I loved the book and the movie brought it to life.  The special effects were stunning and well done.  I actually watched it twice just to pick up what I missed the first time.  Cannot wait to see the next in the trilogy.  The acting is sharp and the dialog natural.  Costumes were in keeping with the spirit of the book and carried on from the last movie.,1398124800,,355,4.161764705882353
6011777,5,B00FL31UF0,"This was a great movie. My husband and I watched it 4 times. Well, actually I think he may have watched it more than that but with me only 4.",1398038400,,141,3.7333333333333334
6011778,4,B00FL31UF0,I thought that this movie picked up nicely where the first one left off and the ending was very good.,1398038400,,101,4.1
6011779,1,B00FL31UF0,The Blu-ray disk would not play.  Had to watch the dvd that came with it.  I might not buy any more disks,1398038400,,105,3.727272727272727
6011780,5,B00FL31UF0,This is a great movie and it has stellar special effects. Absolutely love it and I like it more than its predecessor.,1398038400,,117,4.363636363636363
6011781,4,B00FL31UF0,"Great action. Good sequel, but felt like it did close the story.
I know a good cliff hanger is supposed to leave you hanging, but I felt like the movie was still in the middle of the champions game. What happened to the rest of the contestants?",1398038400,,244,4.212765957446808
6011782,5,B00FL31UF0,"For so much material that this movie had to choose from the book, the writing team did it perfectly. They included all of the important parts very well and made it so you understand the importance and role each character plays. I enjoyed this movie very much.",1398038400,,259,4.531914893617022
6011783,3,B00FL31UF0,"The movie was true to the book.  I enjoyed the book series and have enjoyed the first two movies.  As with book 2, this second movie is basically a bridge between book 1 and 3... you will probably like this movie about as much as you liked book 2.  For me, this second movie was not nearly as good as the first... for the same reasons as I would have for the book... not a lot happens, especially not a lot that would be different from movie/book 1.",1398038400,,449,4.079545454545454
6011784,4,B00FL31UF0,Having read the book beforehand I was quite pleased how the director kept to the story line as closely as he did.,1398038400,,113,4.181818181818182
6011785,1,B00FL31UF0,"Nothing at all like the book. If this trilogy is trying to to follow the footsteps of Hobbit and Lord of the Rings and the like, it is failing miserably.",1398038400,,153,4.133333333333334
6011786,1,B00FL31UF0,I only gave this one star because you can't give it zero.  I watched this because the first Hunger Games was sort of entertaining and heard that this one was good. Wrong.  Maybe marginally better but certainly not worth any time or money to watch it.,1398038400,,250,4.413043478260869
6011787,5,B00FL31UF0,Was please to see that the story line matched the book well. That as well as the movie was presented well also.,1398038400,,111,4.090909090909091
6011788,5,B00FL31UF0,The message is much deeper than the obvious.  I can't wait for the next two movies since they plan to split the third book into two.  Though frankly the third book is the weakest of the three.,1398038400,,192,4.162162162162162
6011789,5,B00FL31UF0,Movie followed closely with the books and had great effects.  I would recommend to anyone that has read the books and to anyone that enjoys and action filled movie.,1398038400,,164,4.655172413793103
6011790,5,B00FL31UF0,I read the books and they are doing a very good job representing the work of the author in film. Totally enjoyed watching,1398038400,,121,4.304347826086956

6011795,4,B00FL31UF0,"Not great, but entertaining. Good action and effects, good plot/ story, but leaves you hanging at the end due to being the second of a trilogy. Jennifer Lawrence is adorable and awesome as expected.",1397952000,,198,4.852941176470588

6011804,5,B00FL31UF0,"Catching Fire is a great movie. Usually there is that concern with the translation when a great book is turned into a movie.
This movie stays very true to the book. In the just over 2 hours this movie captures just about every element in the book.
Nothing to do with the actual product, but the overall movie lighting was a bit too dark.
The package came wrapped and the dvd case sealed. I was hoping that the digital copy was through the amazon cloud. It would've been so much easier to activate.
If you don't have an Ultraviolet account one must be created and it's partner account VUDU must be made as well. Why 2 accounts for one digital copy is beyond me. This isn't the first Ultraviolet/VUDU digital movie I have activated and depending on what device VUDU is being watched from it can be lagging or perfect. There was no iTunes option as some digital copies have.
But the digital copy does make it convenient to watch on the laptop while traveling if there's no DVD drive or player available.",1397865600,,1000,4.469945355191257

6011807,5,B00FL31UF0,"The story is an important one, and it is told very well. The acting is excellent, with real humanity showing through the action tale. The elevator scene is hysterical, but the rest is a serious life and death story.

Even the cgi is outstanding - those murderous baboons are really scary.

This is not my usual type of movie, but I was rooting for Katniss, Peeta and their allies. Jennifer Lawrence is an outstanding actress, and she is amazibg in this movie. Watch for the final scene!",1397865600,,486,4.574712643678161
6011808,5,B00FL31UF0,"Both the books and the movies that tell the story of ""The Hunger Games"" are amazingly creative, interesting, and riveting.  I recommend reading the books and watching the movies of this trilogy as it involves a serious subject (an oppressive totalitarian government) and how one brave person can make such a huge difference to millions of people.

This epic story is inspiring and focuses on Katniss, who has no interest in being a heroine.  She is a heroine just because of who she is naturally with her sense of honor, her goodness, her outspokenness, her honesty, and her grit.

What is captured in ""The Hunger Games,"" is the battle between the oppressed and the oppressors, something that has plagued Planet Earth for too many centuries.  And what ""The Hunger Games"" brings to this ongoing plague on Earth is a unique way to present this conflict with hope for the oppressed everywhere.

The stories are more than just ""entertainment.""  ""The Hunger Games"" takes a very serious evil and brings it to our consciousness in a real and palatable way.  It causes me to take inspiration from the actions of the heroes and heroines who arise through the very punishment of the games to greatness, which, in turn, incites the oppressed people to rise up and attempt to take back their lives.

""The Hunger Games"" merits our attention.",1397865600,,1328,4.84070796460177

The basic story was OK, but the battle arena scenes just took too long and the predictable CGI just drug it down.

6011830,5,B00FL31UF0,I loved this movie.  It was much better than the first one.  And I was a big fan of the first one.

6011832,1,B00FL31UF0,I watched this for the actress Jennifer Lawrence. I wasn't a fan of the first film and read this one beat the original with a clearer narrative and better story but man was I wrong. I understood everything and predicted the plot never reading the books so I base this on the movies own laurels. What a waste badly paced picks up at the end but drags on and on and on. I do not recommend this and as for the demographic it's for 10 to 13 year olds to complex. A overpriced mess read the books. I never read them but they have to be better than this. The only positive thing I can say the actors made the experience tolerable to the end this movie is only redeemed by its cast. With my juvenile attraction to Jennifer Lawrence as the basis to rent this not as a fan of the series I just needed to share that last bit so you understand my point of view. I would rather be honest than give you an incomplete picture of my mindset for renting this film.,1397779200,3,948,4.102150537634409

6011837,5,B00FL31UF0,"I have only read the first of The Hunger Games trilogy but I have seen-and loved-the movies of the first two volumes of it and can hardly wait for the third (I can't decide whether or not to go ahead and read it or wait). I loved the first in the series but loved Catching Fire even more. It is taut, painful, and exciting, and I gasped and cried my way through it.

It is definitely more meaningful to see this film after seeing the first (or having read the books). It is a tightly written, fast-moving and suspenseful film with many heartbreaking moments. I found the critique of first world power and imperialism excellent but done lightly enough so as not to overwhelm the plot or the characters.

Jennifer Lawrence turns in another outstanding performance. Philip Seymour Hoffman is wonderful and I don't know how they're going to handle his death. All the actors-especially Elizabeth Banks as Effie and Lenny Kravitz (a favorite of mine)-give amazing performances.

See it!",1397779200,,980,4.752941176470588
6011838,2,B00FL31UF0,"It's an okay movie. The acting is superb, but the story is just uninteresting. The main female character is portrayed as a victim. The chance to show a strong and powerful young woman is squandered. I was disgusted by how helpless she acted... Sure she is an amazing archer, but she acts as if it is a gift, not from years of practice and dedication.  Clearly, I was very disappointed in the screenplay.

There were a few details/scenes that were left out or are different from the book, but they do not affect the overall story. For example, the movie never shows Katniss going to the old house in the woods near the lake where her and her father used to go, but this doesn't take anything away from the story. Katniss also learns about the uprising in a different manner in the movie (sees it on a television on the train ride to the capital, where in the book she sees it on TV in the Mayor of District 12's house).

""Jennifer Lawrence, who plays the lead role of Katniss Everdeen, described Suzanne Collins' Hunger Games trilogy as holding up 'a terrible kind of mirror: This is what our society could be like if we became desensitized to trauma and to each other's pain.'""

The Hunger Games movies, and books which they are based upon, invoke a certain kind of revulsion within toward the indifference and almost awe with which we consume violence as entertainment. I appreciate ""entertainment"" that is more than just that. This movie certainly gives viewers much to consider.

This trilogy is all about coming of age, fighting for human dignity and overcoming adversity with cunning and personal skills. Though violent, the movie doesn't dwell on the gory, but on survival, hope and young love.  The author wrote for young adults, but, the message was embraced by young and old alike.  This futuristic story hits very close to home with the injustice of those that Have and Have Not.  Sometimes it only takes the spunk and courage of one person ( Katniss Everdeen) to ignite the masses to defend their rights as human beings. The reluctant Heroine finds herself hated by her government and loved by her fellow countryman, because, both realized, She was their Future.

6011885,3,B00FL31UF0,"At the conclusion of the 74th Hunger Games, Katniss and Peter manage to survive all that is thrown at them. Unfortunately their retirement to a life of `luxury' is short lived. The Capitol is concerned at the unrest in the districts and at Katniss' popularity in particular. The subsequent 75th Hunger Games is thus designed to put an end to her and re-establish control over the twelve districts. Accordingly, the previous winners of the Games are committed to another round which should see Katniss dead and hope crushed. While this is all conveyed well enough, this installment does not stand alone. You really need to be familiar with the books or at least to have seen the first film in the series.  Even so, things are a little confusing at times. The human dynamics are a bit more complex this time round and much that happens is to set up the next film. I felt this served to let this film down a bit and it all seemed a bit rushed towards the end. Overall the focus is less on the Game itself and more on the rebellion, though it is still pretty good entertainment. There is also some powerful emotional moments at times. It is not too gory and if anything the violence has been toned done a bit. The fact that most of the participants are adults makes it less unsettling than the first installment. Recommended but it needs to be viewed as an episode rather than a self-contained story. Just closer to three stars than four.",1397606400,2,1434,4.536679536679537
6011886,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie was a good follow up to the first one. You can't believe what the president wants out these young and old people who play in the games. The order of killing one in order to make things right in the county is crazy I was really upset with him Watch the movie very good,1397520000,,278,3.982142857142857
6011887,5,B00FL31UF0,I have not seen any of the Hunger Games movies so this one was totally new.  I found it quite interesting and very relevant.,1397520000,,124,4.166666666666667
6011888,5,B00FL31UF0,If you have seen the first Hunger Games you probably already know that you will really enjoy the second installment. Once again a story line that continues to keep you interested and the characters are growing in their sense of how to fight back in this unusual world atmosphere. Jennifer Lawrence is unbeatable!!,1397520000,,313,4.9245283018867925
6011889,4,B00FL31UF0,"My 14 year old daughter saw this with her school when it came out.  I actually enjoyed it very much and it kept me watching for the full time (over 2 hours).  I thought they did a great job adapting the movie from the book. The one thing I missed was how much makeup the city characters didn't wear this time.  Even Effie was more visible overall.  Possibly they wanted us to actually see the actors faces.  Felt very different than the first one.

All in all, enjoyable, and I'm 56 years old. Great for all you big kids at heart.",1397520000,,530,4.198019801980198

6011891,3,B00FL31UF0,I did see the movie Hunger Games and did enjoy the cast as well as the whole movie. I must be truthful about Hunger Games : Catching Fire that it was really ok but not as igood as i expected after watching the origonal movie Hunger Games.,1397520000,,238,4.085106382978723
6011892,5,B00FL31UF0,I almost liked this one better than the first. They're worth watching for the costumes alone! I also love a strong female lead.,1397520000,,127,4.565217391304348
6011893,5,B00FL31UF0,2nd time watching and was great!  Video quality was fine - it was like watching a dvd.  I will use the on demand service again,1397520000,,126,4.0
6011894,5,B00FL31UF0,"I am a big fan of the Hunger Games series of books.  I found them to be excellent stories, very well written with very well thought-out plots.  I was very impressed when the first movie came out, as the main scenes and themes of the book were actually still there.

Catching fire, the 2nd installment in the movie series, is possibly the closest I have ever seen a movie come to the book from which is is drawn.  What's more, those changes that have been made all enhance the on-screen experience.  Once again the plot is fantastic and the acting is superb.  The on-screen action is perfectly balanced with drama and some great moments of humor.

If you enjoyed the hunger games movie, or the books, I highly recommend Catching Fire.  This is a rare instance of a sequel really improving on the original, and I hope that the momentum carries through to the remaining films.",1397520000,,873,4.551282051282051
6011895,5,B00FL31UF0,I love this movie! I was so disappointed with the first movie because I felt that it left so much out. Catching Fire does a much better job at sticking to the book. I wish we didn't have to wait so long for Mockingjay!,1397520000,,218,3.977272727272727

6011897,3,B00FL31UF0,"Great acting and stays true to the book but at times it lost my attention. Dragged on a bit in parts. While first movie could more or less stand on its own, this one definitely felt like the directors were more focused on setting up for the third/final installment rather than making this a solid film.",1397520000,,302,4.410714285714286
6011898,3,B00FL31UF0,The first movie was much better but you had to watch this movie to know what to expect in the third.  The graphics were good and the costumes in the movie were nice.  It just moved very slow for us.,1397520000,2,198,3.925

I did not read the books - but I thought the plot was thin with a lot of contrived action, some of the actors were good, I enjoyed Woody and Donald Sutherland as well as Jennifer Lawrence. So I gave it 3 stars because it was OK...I was glad I turned on the closed captioning so I could read some of the inaudible speech.",1397520000,,462,4.087912087912088

The subplot of a revolution is building and the tension is rising while the characters are slowly developing. Look forward to Mockingjay this Fall, so yes, we have been pulled in out of curiosity more than enthralled by the cinematography.",1397433600,,538,5.255813953488372
6011940,5,B00FL31UF0,I would add this movie and the first release to my collection. It was an interesting theme without any trash. It keeps you on the edge of your seat without any filth or smut (the kind of stuff that really isn't necessary to make a good movie).

6011968,2,B00FL31UF0,"As a follow up movie this one did poorly and worse yet was just as pointless.  All it did was set the scene for yet another movie to follow.  Seriously the story line, the acting, and the whole premiss the movie is based on was a flop.  Can't imagine how a major studio got suckered into waisting a fortune on this series of movies.  Save time and disappointment and do not rent this.",1397260800,,384,4.219178082191781
6011969,5,B00FL31UF0,I have read all the books and was looking forward to the movie. The movie-although closely aligned with the book-has some variances I enjoy. I do recommend this movie and am looking forward to the next in the story line.,1397260800,,220,4.525
6011970,4,B00FL31UF0,I like these movies and cant wait to see the last one of the trilogy. Great movie about taking down the system.,1397260800,,111,4.090909090909091
6011971,5,B00FL31UF0,"Our daughter saw this movie in the theater when it came out, but we didn't want to spend another $11 for her to see it again, so we downloaded it through Amazon Instant Video to my Kindle Fire.

Just like the first movie, Catching Fire follows the book closely. Still angry over Katniss outsmarting him during the last Hunger Games, President Snow with the help of his new game maker, Plutarch, devises a Quarter Quell where the pool will be chosen from the surviving victors in each district. In District 12, that means Katniss is destined to return to the Games, along with either Peeta or Haymitch. When Peeta volunteers as tribute, it sets the scene for Peeta and Katniss to be placed in danger once again, with Haymitch helping them from the Capitol. Unlike last time, where only some of the tributes were skilled fighters, Katniss and Peeta are facing an entire arena of other tributes whose cunning and skill allowed them to survive the Games. Making allies, something Katniss has always struggled with, will be crucial to coming out alive.

Though some of the names and the arena have changed, all the elements that attracted viewers to The Hunger Games movie are present in its sequel. New characters keep things fresh, and it is good to see how the original characters have evolved. Superb acting by all and a gripping story line make this a must see for fans of dystopian fiction. With an outstanding cliffhanger ending, fans will certainly be eager for The Hunger Games: Mockingjay -- Part I to release this fall.",1397260800,,1525,4.7293233082706765
6011972,5,B00FL31UF0,I gave it five star cause I love the action and from the begin I was on the edge of my set. I can't wait for the next movie to come out. I also like how Katniss is standing up for what is right.,1397260800,,194,3.4318181818181817

6011979,5,B00FL31UF0,"For me I really think the movie is doing the book justice. The Hunger Games trilogy would be for all ages and hits almost every single movie genre in my opinion. Jennifer Lawrence is one amazing actress. Every single actor in this movie does such a wonderful job. I don't see why anyone would not like this movie. I do think that the first was better than this one, but I seriously can not wait to see Mockingjay.",1397174400,,413,4.3076923076923075

Although considered ""Young Adult"" the themes are quite mature and suitable for every age.

The movie is long at about 2 1/2 hours, but there was so much going on that I didn't even realize how much time had elapsed until after it was over.  The only frustrating part is having to wait for the next installment.",1397174400,,402,4.555555555555555

The action was great and special effects were awesome.  Cannot believe that it received NO Oscar nominations.  The acting and special effects were much better than most of the nominees in those categories.  Only problem is the amount of time till next movie, Mockinjay.",1397174400,,422,4.805555555555555

6011990,3,B00FL31UF0,Probably the worst thing about series is that they are series.  The movie was like the books - trapped with a logical progression into a predictable pattern and mindset.  Some of the action is obviously fake and some of the effects are very nice.  The characters get a little stock and the cast isn't  really excited to be there.  Not a bad movie but not something I would pay more than the Amazon rental price for.  This is a teenager movie of daring do and fantasy.  In reality things just don't happen like this.  When you make the powers that be mad you end up falling under a bus and get a great funeral they don't bother to plot against you.  Better than cable TV but loses out to a good mystery paperback.,1397088000,3,712,4.293233082706767

After being dragged through life or death games not once, but twice, it was clearly time for some resolution.  Time for the bad guys to have the smiles wiped off their faces.  But no.  That would have meant no part 3.

Everyone who's seen this should receive a voucher for free admission to part 3 which hopefully will bring some closure.  Then again, if there's money to be made, parts 4-19 won't be far off.",1397088000,6,487,4.540229885057471

6011996,5,B00FL31UF0,"OK the first time I watched the movie I was disappointed but that was because I have read all of the books more than once, I wish the producers and directors did what Pater Jackson did in the Lord of the Rings Trilogy and The Hobbit yes they spent a lot of money but they made a lot of money and the fans loved it I feel the same way about The Hunger Games Trilogy. After I saw the first movie I was so upset that I got my Granddaughters Kindle Reader and bought all three books and read them in 3 days. I was not upset because the movie was bad it is a great movie I own it and must have seen it over 50 times with all the kids but I was upset about how the movie ended and was unaware that it was only the first part of three movies. After I saw the movie The Hunger Games: Catching Fire for the second time I really saw it and it is a fantastic movie I just wish that the Movie Makers would have spent more time let it run longer so they could have included more of the book in the movie. I hope that someday someone will remake the movie to include more of the book in it. The movie was pretty true to the book but so much was left out, I thought and if I would have never have read the books I may not have understood some of the movie. I would have sat through 3 hours of The Hunger Games people were crazy for Harry Potter and those movies ran long so they could add more of the book to those movies. I am not saying the movie is not good, I would buy it again but I am saying that I was disappointed that so much was left out a lot of real important information that was in the book, a lot of interaction between the main corrector's were left out. Well read the books and see the movies and judge for your self's like I said the movie was good but I think it could have been better, it was not the actors it was the content the story that was left out. Well I hope this helps you but like I said I would buy the movie again and I hope that the next Hunger Games will do the books justice Thank You",1397088000,,2006,3.836144578313253

6011999,5,B00FL31UF0,"We loved reading the books, so we were very excited to see the movie when it came out.
We were not disappointed. The most minor complaint was that they could have made a couple of the subtleties from the book more obvious in the movie, but we noticed them, so we did not miss them. We simply had to explain them to our friend who was watching the movie with us for the first time.

The main character, although obviously a great archer, comes across as a bit dense at times.
Other than that, great story of under-aged gladiators, killing each other for the amusement of the residents of the capitol district (most all of whom seem completely unaware as to how perverse the whole situation is!). Just watch the movies to understand!",1397088000,,731,4.496240601503759

6012005,4,B00FL31UF0,This was a very good follow-up to the first film. It takes a little bit of time to get the action going but we get more back story and exposition before.  The late Philip Seymour Hoffman joins the cast with another solid performance here and the rest of the cast delivers very well.

6012042,5,B00FL31UF0,received the movie in record time.  Love the idea that I got the combo with DVD / Blu-ray and UltraViolet Digital copy for the same price of just the Blu-ray version in other stores.  I like to have all the formats just in case.,1396915200,,228,4.159090909090909
6012043,4,B00FL31UF0,Having seen the first movie I sort of knew what to expect. A lot of focus on the quasi-relationship between the two. Needed something just a bit more(little more hunting),1396915200,,170,4.7

6012045,3,B00FL31UF0,To be perfectly honest with you I enjoyed the first Catching Fire DVD better then this version.  The first one was more realized and I could relate to it better............I got bored with this version and fell asleep on it.,1396915200,,224,4.6
6012046,5,B00FL31UF0,"Jennifer Lawrence is going to be a bright star for a long time. She was stoic, like her character demanded and totally believable. Many times the movie is disappointing after the book. This movie was an exception.",1396915200,,213,4.783783783783784
6012047,3,B00FL31UF0,"This is not as good as the first  Hunger Games movie, but is entertaining and the special effects are spectacular! I think It sets up nicely for the third of the series, Mocking Jay.",1396915200,,182,4.352941176470588
6012048,4,B00FL31UF0,"The movie is excellent. The DVD disc played with no problem. However, the Blur Ray disc did not work in two different Blue Ray players.",1396915200,,135,4.44
6012049,4,B00FL31UF0,It was not as good as the first in my opinion. It was still well done but I found some of the acting to be a little overdone in this one.,1396915200,,137,3.4516129032258065
6012050,5,B00FL31UF0,"Ok now we have to wait for the third film. Amazon pre-order fast as always. If a films at the theater and you cant wait to see it at home, just pre-order from Amazon, they will get it to you fast. It isn't always about the cheapest price. But it is about speed.
Oh  Its an ok film, nothing special.",1396915200,,298,3.966666666666667

6012053,5,B00FL31UF0,"I Really liked the first movie the hunger games and when I seen this in the theater I knew I would want to own it to watch over and over again. I now own the first movie, Catch a Fire, and The Mocking Jay when it is available.  This is a must see!!",1396915200,,248,3.6792452830188678
6012054,1,B00FL31UF0,What a terrible way to destroy what was potentially a great series that lyed ahead. I wonder ig they just went off the seat of their pants or actually planned this thing to be terrible as it is.,1396828800,,194,4.131578947368421
6012055,5,B00FL31UF0,"A great sequel to the first movie... often second movies just don't measure up to the first one, especially if the first one was popular and well loved.. This was a great continuation and you quickly find yourself engrossed in the lives of Catniss and Peta... 5 stars!",1396828800,,268,4.604166666666667

6012059,5,B00FL31UF0,"I loved the Hunger Games and couldn't wait to get the sequel.  It was worth the wait!  It's a GREAT movie, as well, which was surprising since the sequel to most movies is not usually as good as the first.  Now I can't wait to get the 3rd release.  I know it will be all that I expect to end the series of Hunger Games movies.",1396828800,,326,3.893939393939394

6012062,5,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed the first movie and this provided more of the same as the plot progessed. If you enjoyed ""The Hunger Games"" there is no reason not to keep following the story. If you did not enjoy it, I don't think this movie's events would change your mind.",1396828800,,252,4.270833333333333
6012063,5,B00FL31UF0,"Best Film Last 20 Years in Any Category.  Brilliant screenplay, Brilliant directing, Brilliant acting, photography, special effects, editing, music, costumes, all of it.  Maybe the greatest film ever.  Must See!!!",1396828800,,213,6.033333333333333
6012064,3,B00FL31UF0,"First of all, I should note that I have not read the books and if I could I would give 3.5 stars.  I really liked the first movie which I think is why I think the second movie was disappointing.  Not that it is a horrible movie. I just feel like I have to watch the third movie to complete the second movie.  So basically I look forward to the next movie.",1396828800,,355,3.9027777777777777
6012065,5,B00FL31UF0,"The movie leaves things that were in the book out and they put in things that aren't in the book, like most movies made from books.  I still love having the movies.  I watch them over and over.  I can't wait for the last one to come out.",1396828800,,237,3.8958333333333335

6012067,5,B00FL31UF0,"Good adaptation of the second book in the trilogy. Of course a movie can't have the detail of a novel, but it captured the essence adequately to stand on its own apart from the book and set up the finale. Enjoyed the casting, setting and effects. We found ourselves physically leaning away from danger with the characters and totally pulled into the arena setting.

Looking forward to the Mockingjay.",1396828800,,400,4.797101449275362
6012068,2,B00FL31UF0,Too hard to understand if you haven't read the book.  I don't think i would enjoy reading the book either,1396828800,,105,4.25

6012084,4,B00FL31UF0,Didn't love the end but it was good again.  Sad to think how perilously close to this we are coming.  I think of the Capital as Hollywood and wonder if they see themselves and all of their excesses in it as well.  They say if you want to know what people are believing about their future look to their stories.  This one is frightening,1396828800,,335,4.1875
6012085,4,B00FL31UF0,"If you liked the first one , you'll like this one.  Blu-ray package has both Blu-ray and DVD copies of the the movie + an UltraViolet digital copy.

Jennifer Lawrence is a powerhouse in front of the camera and she really shows promise as a young star. Catching Fiore really kept me entertained and wanting for more. Exactly the way a sequel should be. I find myself anxious for Part 3 and can not wait. Well done to all involved.,1396656000,,365,4.462686567164179
6012128,5,B00FL31UF0,"Really Good action throughout the movie. We love the series.  Hate this ending,  They could have ended it a different way :-(",1396656000,,125,4.636363636363637
6012129,5,B00FL31UF0,I watched this DVD soon after it arrived.  I was riveted watching just like I was reading the book.  I am so happy the Hollywood people told the story just like it was and did not take 'artistic license' with it.  I think Jennifer Lawrence is an outstanding author and am so glad 'Hunger Games' is being made into movies and DVDs,1396656000,,329,4.274193548387097
6012130,5,B00FL31UF0,This was more tense than the first one. Enjoy watching the evolution of Katniss  Looking forward to Mockingjay.coming in November.,1396656000,,130,5.5
6012131,3,B00FL31UF0,"I liked the first movie better.  I was hoping for far better with the sequel, but it just didn't appeal to me as much as I had hoped.",1396656000,,133,3.75
6012132,5,B00FL31UF0,"I admit upfront I am totally biased. I love the Hunger Games trilogy and this is my favorite book and movie. This is a wonderful book adaptation, and I loved that I got the dvd and the uV digital copy. It was a bit of a pain setting up the digital copy, but I love having access to the movie and the extras without needing the DVD.

Excellent movie and great price.",1396656000,,365,4.069444444444445
6012133,5,B00FL31UF0,"Wonderful. Can't wait for the next !!!!
Watching hunger games catching fire over and over over  Lovin it  everyone in my family love it.",1396656000,,136,4.625
6012134,4,B00FL31UF0,"I have never been convinced that these movies have been Jennifer Lawrence's best vehicles. Too moody and tight-lipped. The sequel story is a worthy follow-up but the fantastical quotient has gone up dramatically which makes the surrounding environment more difficult to swallow. All-in-all a modest sequel to a very creative original. Oh, the CGI was top rate otherwise the writing trips up here and there.",1396656000,,406,5.2615384615384615
6012135,5,B00FL31UF0,"Just as I expected, liked the new movie. Great quality and resolution just what I was looking for, felt like I was watching it in then movie theater.",1396656000,,149,4.357142857142857
6012136,1,B00FL31UF0,"The quality of this movie was very poor. It jumped throughout the movie, there was a period of skips lasting for ten minutes. I can't believe I paid for this quality.  Well think hard before renting a movie again on kindle from amazon!",1396656000,,235,4.465116279069767
6012137,5,B00FL31UF0,"I thought this was much better and more like the book than the first one. I didn't feel like there were any parts missing, which really allowed us to see the characters develop, incl the romance that I missed in the first one :)",1396656000,,228,4.204545454545454

6012139,5,B00FL31UF0,"I would recommend this to about 10 years and up because there is some violence but a great movie.
I liked the new animals and the arena.",1396656000,,136,4.074074074074074
6012140,5,B00FL31UF0,"This storyline really makes for a good movie. All though the books are just a little different, the movie stays pretty close to the books. Jennifer Lawrence is excellent at Katniss. The movie is well acted.",1396656000,,206,4.75
6012141,5,B00FL31UF0,I have read the books.  The characters are well cast. The action is well played.  The music fits the film.  The story paces along quickly.  Worth watching again!,1396656000,,161,4.642857142857143

As for the movie itself...saw it in theaters, loved it so I had to buy it!",1396656000,,189,4.222222222222222
6012144,5,B00FL31UF0,"THE HUNGER GAMES: Catching Fire lives up to all expectations. Must buy for any fan of this incredible franchise. The story follows the main characters lives after their victory in ""The Hunger Games"" and now must deal with an even bigger threat from President Snow. The movie visually is incredible masterpiece of cinematography and special effects.",1396656000,,348,5.232142857142857

6012146,3,B00FL31UF0,"The only thing I can tell you is, I think the first one was the best, which I didn't purchase.  So I'll wait and see how the third one turns out and then decide if I should have all three.",1396569600,,188,3.7
6012147,5,B00FL31UF0,"I have read the books, and of course some small details are left out. However, the movie is very good overall and there was much more of a budget in this one than the first. Ends with you on the edge of a cliff, but I am looking forward to the next two!",1396569600,,253,3.792452830188679
6012148,5,B00FL31UF0,"Wonderful sequel.  This one - to me - follows the book much more closely than the original.  There are some major portions left out, don't get me wrong, but the major points are there.  The graphics in this one are AMAZING!  Let me repeat that - AMAZING.  Terrific graphics throughout the movie.  The only disappointment, really, was that the relationship between Finn and Katniss wasn't as developed as I would have liked to have seen.  Nuts & Volts were perfect casting, in my opinion - although I would have liked to have seen more of them as well.  And Jena Malone as Joanna - for as small a part as she played - was inspired!  Honestly, I liked this one SOOOO much more than the original.  I can't wait to see what they do with Mockingjay.  If you enjoyed the first movie, you will fall in love with this one.  If you didn't like the first movie - there's still a chance you'll like this one - to me it stands on its own.",1396569600,,926,4.258620689655173

6012152,2,B00FL31UF0,"I get tired of Hollywood and the film industry putting out the same old line and garbage! The writers must be clones from the same dull, simple minded, and highly predictable screen script. I like the lead actress but that is about as far as I can go. Do not waste your money.",1396569600,,276,4.226415094339623
6012153,5,B00FL31UF0,"What I like about the HUNGER GAMES movies, is the fact that they stick pretty close to the book. How many books have you read only to be disappointed when you see it on screen and its 1) nothing, or barely like the book, 2) it is so poorly acted, or directed or subpar effects make it nowhere near as good as your imagination? Well, fortunately, CATCHING FIRE is not like the former or the later.

In this run, Jennifer Lawrence's character is ...Well...on fire! It was just as I imagined. The quarter quell finds Katnis and Pita in a huge dome resembling a tropical forest surrounding an island lagoon. At the center of the lagoon is an island. There is where the weapons are stashed for the brutal contest to come. The capital city has lavishley created a set like no other. All of the former winners of the games are pitched against one another upon this extravagant stage.

Lightning storms! Fogs of acid! Maniacal killer baboons! Tsunami gushing floods! All, Circle the inside of the dome causing mayham and death... seeming random at first. But the clever group that Katnis has drawn together to better their odds for survival, find that the random catastrophes are not so random. And together they begin to form a plan to use the events to their advantage. They desperately need help to fight the stronger and more vicious other group that hunts them relentlessly. For they know Katnis is by far the most popular and leathel among the contenders. She must die if one of them is to leave the dome alive!",1396569600,4,1509,4.5851851851851855

6012156,4,B00FL31UF0,I enjoyed watching and getting immersed in the story. I just wish it hadn't ended so abruptly.  It sets the scene for another sequel.,1396569600,,133,4.541666666666667
6012157,5,B00FL31UF0,"Awesome! Better interpretation of the book hen the first movie - thank you for that!
Jennifer & Josh are great young actors & make this one to watch over. LOVED the wedding dress transformation - made the hairs on the back of my neck raise!
Willow has grown so much - made the transition of prime character quite poignant.

As with other movies converted from great books there is always some parts that have to be sacrificed either for time, or the fact that the plot in a book might not always translate to the screen.  I was a little disappointed with the first movie and thought it was just because I loved the book so much, but I did not have the same disappointment with this one.

6012190,5,B00FL31UF0,"In my opinion, the story was more thorough and gripping. I know the first movie was just creating the backdrop, and it succeeded, because this one really pulls you in to the dystopian society and helps you to feel the sense of hopelessness pervasive, and gives you that glimmer of hope that is Katniss.

6012204,3,B00FL31UF0,I felt the first movie was better. Too much drama in the second one. More action sequences that lead to the finish of the movie. The second one was becoming predictable. What lead to that was the revealing of Sutherland's revenge.,1396483200,,230,4.634146341463414

6012213,5,B00FL31UF0,"I love this movie, it didn't exactly follow the book, then again movies never really do. However I think that it really deserves 5 stars. Thanks for allowing me to find exactly what I need on amazon.",1396396800,,199,4.405405405405405

6012216,4,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed ""The Hunger Games"" more than this sequel.  Might just be me, but this movie seemed more shallow than the first though I can't say that about the books.  In the book form, both were excellent.  If you liked the books or the first movie, you will still enjoy the movie, but the novelty is lacking.",1396396800,,305,4.315789473684211
6012217,5,B00FL31UF0,"After having watched the first Hunger Games movie, this sequel was a must see. It also ends with the viewer wanting more (because there is a third movie!)

The quality of this HD Stream was great. However, I do wish that the Full-Screen option was a bit bigger and filled the entire TV Screen (And I am not talking in regards to Full-Screen View vs. Wide-Screen View)",1396396800,,367,4.477611940298507

6012221,5,B00FL31UF0,Sequels are never quite as good but this is a definite must see. It followed the book pretty closely. The actors handed another great performance. Glad I bought it!,1396396800,,164,4.689655172413793
6012222,4,B00FL31UF0,"As with the original HUNGER GAMES, this was well done and the angst created by the burden of responsibility, the tension of relationships, power politics and intrigue continue in a compelling way ... unfortunately, as with any sequel, these are re-run themes so the ""freshness"" and surprise of the first installment are not there ... my favorite scene, though, is the very last frame: the realization & resolve that dawns on Jennifer Lawrence's face are palpable -- which makes me look forward with anticipation to the last episode ... however, i don't know what they are going to do now that Seymour Phillip Hoffman is (tragically!) dead ... he was a real talent, a film presence that will not be easily or readily replaced ...

I think this movie is almost as good as the initial Hunger Games Movie, and since this new ""Catching Fire"" edition, in what I assume is a ""trilogy,""  it was interesting seeing the ""cliff-hanger"" ending this time, that I suppose will lead us all into the next movie in the series.

The only thing I wish could happen for those of us pre-ordering the movies is that we could get the DVD's the ""Day BEFORE"" it comes out in all the stores.  That would make this customer happy!",1396396800,,631,4.233333333333333

6012230,2,B00FL31UF0,"The second book in the Hunger Games Trilogy was just so so and that goes for this movie as well.  But the second book laid the ground work for the third and final book which was as good as the first.  With hope, that will be the same with the film version.
That being said, this movie seemed to lack any sincerity.  I was left not caring about a single character nor their outcome. The acting was just flat.  If I wasn't watching this film with my wife, I would have ended it and gone on to something more entertaining, like a Gilligan's Island rerun.",1396396800,,551,4.219047619047619

6012248,5,B00FL31UF0,"I read the books way before the movies came out and I think this does justice to the 2nd book.
Of course they couldn't leave in every single little detail but overall the sceenplay author and others did a decent job.
It's been my experience that very few books translate to the big screen exactly as written. This is one that I don't hate.
I can also recommend this for folks who haven't read the books but are fans of the first movie, like my hubby.
He was very eager to see the 2nd installment and his only complaint is the next movie isn't coming out sooner. He hates a cliffhanger!
I'm pleased with the audio and video quality; it looks and sounds great through our home theater system.
My hubby was also thrilled with the UltratViolet Digital copy he could load on his iPad for travel.
I don't speak tech well enough to get into specifics; all I can say is I don't have any complaints about the quality.",1396396800,,908,4.347058823529411

It made the first one look like a Gem, it was so horrible that we almost turned it off half way through it.  We should have because it only got worst towards the end.

I strongly recommend that anyone who is going to watch this movie definitely watch ""The Hunger Games"" to get the foundation from which this second installment is based.  This story is one of the greatest trilogies ever written showing how a young girl goes from a life of fear to one of strength and power.  You watch her grow and mature through the first and second installment and in fact, all the lead characters have wonderful qualities, standards and ethics.  The acting is perfect, the story is perfect and the quality of this film is the best.  Everyone that i know that read the books said the books were the best they ever read and that the movie does not disappoint them.  So i recommend both reading the books and watching the movies.

And the second time, when you're looking closely at the details and understanding where the plot is going, you're like, oh wow, that's really awesome how they did that, or how that actor showed that!

6012306,5,B00FL31UF0,Love the Hungry Games and preordered the Catching Fire because I missed it on the big screen.  I have both movies and know I will continue to enjoy them as the years go by.  I can just pull them out and watch them whenever I want.  Cannot wait until the next movie.  I will certainly put it on preorder as well.  Was also impressed that the price decreased from the time I put on preorder and Amazon was good to their word - they reimbursed my account the difference.

6012309,5,B00FL31UF0,The second part of the Hunger Games series has been represented well here.  The graphics and photography are even better than the first film.  The story line is becoming more intense and that is reflected well in this film. The main actors are even more solid in their roles and the relationships are developing more and more.

6012312,5,B00FL31UF0,"Excellent movie! Jennifer's performance was extraordinary! (SO much better than Silver Linings Playbook or American Hustle, in my opinion). This movie was MUCH better than the first. I read the books and still love this movie series just as much! The first movie seemed a little cheesy and lacking. But this movie was much more serious and focused more on the hard ""dirty"" elements from the book (such as the uprising and capitol control, etc.) which paves the way for the third/fourth movies.",1396137600,,493,4.951807228915663

6012318,2,B00FL31UF0,"The directing and camera work was pretty uninspired, which actually surprised me. SPX with the dress and changing weather was well done, but dialogue seemed flat, like a checklist of scenes/info that needed to get covered. Friend keeps telling me,  ""it's not that kind of movie,"" but it seems they made a decent blockbuster when they could have made some artistic choices that would not risk profit and ended up with something better. Second half better than the first.",1396137600,,469,4.936708860759493

6012321,5,B00FL31UF0,"This second part is in many ways superior to part one, which was enjoyable. The pacing is better, for example. But without the first part, this second part would have nothing to build on, so part two extends nicely. Of course, the evil President Snow is trying to suppress all sense of individuality and hope by rigging a second game in which the star-crossed ""lovers"" must participate. It is great to see the game, the ingenuity of its participants, and the beginning of a revolution meant to thwart Snow. It's difficult to imagine two anticipated parts as being any better crafted, but this addition whets the appetite for them.",1396137600,,630,4.7889908256880735

6012326,5,B00FL31UF0,Great movie! The only thing I didn't like is that they waited too long to make things happen... They coild have made only the second movie with the whole story instead of making a third one.,1396137600,,190,4.305555555555555

6012338,2,B00FL31UF0,Pointless movie that does little other than set up the next sequel.  This movie served almost no purpose other than to take your cash.  Nothing is settled.  The story ends where it began.  This movie concluded nothing.,1396051200,,218,4.8108108108108105

6012348,4,B00FL31UF0,"CATCHING FIRE is a marked improvement over THE HUNGER GAMES, in everything from the script and story, to the visuals and cinematography. The story continues to follow Katniss (and Peeta) as they do a victory tour of Panem. However, things are not as happy as you think might be. Revolution is brewing, and the people in charge want to nip it in the bud. This is solved by having a special Hunger Games for the 75th year. Instead of fresh tributes, they will be reaped from the existing pool of victors. What follows is a fascinating and engaging look at a dystopian society, the battle for survival, etc. This definitely held my interest better than the limpid previous installment. One thing that's immediately noticeable is the change in visual style, and the way they shot the movie. Instead of a lot of handheld and shaky camera, the shots are better composed, wider and more fluid. This is especially helpful in maintaining a sense of place in the arena. I also liked how they gave more time for character development, even for President Snow. They even manage to give most of the new characters their due onscreen as well. Standouts were Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee and Sam Claflin as Finnick O'Dair(?). The only I really don't care for in these movies is the love triangle between Katniss, Gale and Peeta. Twilight already did it, and every movie since has had some variation on it. Overall, this movie is much better than the first one though, and the final two installments will be directed by the same person (Francis Lawrence). They do a better job with the technical aspects, handling of the story and thematic elements and a much better job of building the world of Panem. Even if you didn't like the first one, you should give this a try.",1396051200,,1770,4.694533762057878

6012354,5,B00FL31UF0,"Middle movies in a trilogy often suffer - first installments usually end with a big reveal, and the finale isn't until the third, so the 2nd movie is left with aftermath from the first and setup for the third. While that's true of Catching Fire as well, it all works, and if anything  Jennifer Lawrence's performance is even better than in the first movie - more pathos and edge as she realizes on an even deeper level the hypocrisy and cruelty of the Capital regime. Although not everyone's performance matches up to hers, they are all fine, and the special effects are excellent.

Plot-wise, Katniss is now home in District 12 after she and Peeta won their Hunger Games. However, their ability to get the Capital to allow them to both live, by acting as if they are deeply in love, has made them a symbol of rebellion, and President Snow warns Katniss she must play the loyalist to keep her loved ones safe. When even this fails to work, a new 75th anniversary Hunger Games is announced, composed of all prior winners, and both Peeta and Katniss are once again in the arena. I don't want to reveal much more as it will spoil the ending, but there's more intrigue than in the first movie, and it's a great setup for the final installment.",1396051200,,1239,4.502222222222223

For ""Catching Fire"" I read the book first, then saw the movie and was amazed at how beautifully both the mood and plot points were translated to film. Page to screen adaptations are difficult to do, and this movie makes a valiant and most times successful effort. Fans of the books will delight at the spot-on characterizations, and newcomers will enjoy the action as well as the dark-undertones that remind us only too well of our own world at large.",1396051200,,581,4.705882352941177

So this movie was just what I expected it to be, a lovely well done performance of a good book.

But I really enjoyed it - and the sequel, ""Catching Fire,"" does not disappoint. The first half of the movie did a good job of humanizing the characters, which in turn made them real and allowed me to sympathize with them throughout the movie. The second half was edge-of-your-seat action with amazing special effects - although the characterization/acting is what stole the show. I was pleasantly surprised to see several veteran actors I enjoy like Jeffrey Wright, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, Stanley Tucci and Woody Harrelson, along with newer actors I'm only now familiar with but look forward to seeing more of. It's a long movie but feels fast-paced... I'm wanting more after the sudden ending!!",1395964800,,814,4.9489051094890515

6012370,5,B00FL31UF0,"Clearly, there is bias for me with the Hunger Games trilogy, as I loved the books, and am not in the least disappointed with the movie adaptation. This was a preorder and was shipped to arrive on the release date, and since the cost was a dollar or two less than what was charged, the difference was credited back to me automatically and quickly. If you love The Hunger Games, this will not disappoint. I can't say enough good things about the film and book trilogy, but if you haven't read the books, then you may feel questions, and that the movie is unfinished or missing something, when you get to the end ...No worries, it's just following along the lines of the book with Catching Fire being the set-up to the continuation in Mockingjay. Essentially, this movie and book are cliffhangers, so enjoy it, and wait as patiently as you can to answer your lingering questions ...or you can read the books, and get an idea on what the next 2 movie installments will be like. Either way, it's not a disappointment and a great action film and storyline to add to your movie collection.",1395964800,,1082,4.525510204081633

Such a great plot twist, I won't spoil it for you. Darn youuuuu, Philip Seymour Hoffman! :( The actors are incredible, you forget it's a movie, you really do.

Can I say, though, who keeps refilling Katniss' bag with arrows? #magical  #nonsensical",1395964800,,377,4.611940298507463

6012374,1,B00FL31UF0,"Well after a discussion at work, a friend told me to check out this new film just released on blu ray, says it's a great film, great effects and plenty of bonus extra's. Being a massive Lord of the Rings fan I'd been waiting along time for these new prequels to come out. So it arrived and I sat down to watch the first in this new series of three 'catching fire'. Well after an hour into it (yes I was enjoying it) I kind of got the impression I was missing something here, like a build up and introduction of the characters, tell me a bit out them and how they came to take part in these games. Because of this I found it hard to relate to the characters and I didn't really know why these relationships had taken place. It was like boom, straight in with the story. After this first film I can't really see where it is going or how it will link into future films. As for the title, hunger games, you thought it would be focusing the story on food but it isn't actually and is quite misleading, I also failed to see anybody catching on fire as well. But that's a minor gripe. The main highlight for me was the return to the big screen of Woody Allen, he hasn't featured in many big films for a long time and I thought his demeanor suited his character haymish very well so that's a plus for the film.",1395964800,,1302,4.109803921568627
6012375,2,B00FL31UF0,A waste of my time. I wish I could ask for a refund. I should have known better. A sequel!,1395964800,,90,3.55
6012376,5,B00FL31UF0,loved it!  so much more closely tied to the book than the first movie! and on bluray this is very impressive. totally worth the money and will watch lots of times,1395964800,,162,4.225806451612903
6012377,2,B00FL31UF0,Not really into these shows very much. I have seen two of them and this one just makes no sense. I also think part 2 of any movie is not as good as the first one. This one just seemed to go no where.,1395964800,,199,3.5454545454545454

6012382,1,B00FL31UF0,This was probably one of the worst movies made.... it literally just ends.  Its like they ended it about 10 minutes before the cliff hanger. I can't get that time back.  I only rented it because I saw the 1st one and that was an equal waste of time.,1395964800,,249,4.061224489795919

And like the cowboys in the old westerns who fought the desperado and tumbled throughout the tavern never loosing their hat - she could not loose her bow under the most extreme circumstances.  But all in all it was a fun way to spend an hour - it is set up for a sequel. Lastly of course Jennifer Lawrence is fun to watch.",1395964800,,540,4.336633663366337
6012388,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie was the perfect emotional roller coaster ride to set us up for the powerful conclusion to the Hunger Games. It followed the book very well and gave just enough insight into the characters to make us care about them or hate them.,1395964800,,239,4.454545454545454

6012392,5,B00FL31UF0,"I join the many who loved this movie.  The movie has left us with an uncertain future for Katniss with regard to her safety, her relationships and how her struggle will be manifested in the future since the games have been destroyed.  It was a sad to note to being continually reminded through the movie of the passing of the actor who played a major role in the movie.

If they needed the first movie to set the second movie up, they could have done it in a more creative matter.  Now...for THIS movie.  I enjoyed it.  The movie had its' wonderful actors of course, but this time it also had a much more interesting story line.  This movie made sense.  YES! I enjoyed the movie and YES, I would recommend it.",1395878400,,506,4.308510638297872

6012402,4,B00FL31UF0,"A strong movie worth buying. (I say that because this was another Redbox rental for me, but I enjoyed the book trilogy so at some point I will try to buy the entire trilogy).

This is watchable as the second part of a trilogy, but it probably makes more sense if you have watched the first movie or read the first book. There was little or no profanity, and my wife enjoyed the movie as well. There are some violent scenes and a few scenes like acid spaying on someone's hand with blisters resulting - but they aren't done with a lot of gore. But still, maybe a film you would let teens watch but not the younger kids.",1395878400,,618,4.19327731092437

6012405,5,B00FL31UF0,I read this series a few years ago and i fell in love with it. Then i heard they were making the movies and although i was excited i remember what a disaster the twilight movies were compared to the books. These movies are so exactly like the book it's scary. Ofcourse there's gonna be a few things they don't include but they can't really fit the whole book into 2-3 hours.  I kindda loved Catching Fire more than the Hunger Games but that was my case with the book too. This is one of those movies I've seen a bunch of times and never get tired of watching so i had to buy it!,1395878400,,578,4.026086956521739

If you haven't read the book you may not understand the acorn throwing but the force field was amazing. Good acting and the action scences were terrific.  As a story plot theme, the potential heading of society and how the haves control the have-nots, is true to life.  Read the book to understand more of the different districts but the movie does a good job.  Rue and her death are a major part of the story but no need to read the first book to get the effect as the director did a good job on getting the feeling across in the movie.

I like how it picked up the story right where it left off.  While it was a fantastic movie, don't misunderstand me, it left me waiting for the rest.  I immediately thought back to previous trilogies such as Lord of the Rings, which also left me wanting more or feeling unsettled at the end. After realizing that, I decided it was a perfect number two movie in a three movie series.  It was very good, had lots of action and a new set of games.  I cannot wait to see what's in store for movie number three.  No, I did not read the books so don't spoil it for me",1395792000,,720,3.993006993006993

The movie was probably interrupted about 8 times for up to 20 seconds per time.  We weren't very pleased about that part.

Today (3/26/14), I saw emails that Amazon noticed that our playback was bad and had credited me back the $4.99 rental cost.  They did this automatically, so I guess others had similar issues with Amazon Video On Demand during that rental timeframe.

So I guess they are watch us watching movies, but in this case they were honest to give us a refund for poor service that they noticed!  Thanks Amazon.",1395792000,,703,4.369230769230769

6012438,3,B00FL31UF0,"It wasn't a bad movie. It would just be really confusing if you haven't read the books. The relationship that builds between Peeta and Katniss in the book is just not there. There is maybe two actual moments shown in the movie. One conversation and one time he helps her sleep after a nightmare. In the book, the relationship builds in a totally believable way that will be relevant later. So not sure how they are going to pass that off in the next movie. Build up to certain events were side swept in ways that are going to make the third movie confusing. They cut out the significance of the Mockingjay symbol which is so important. It is so slightly mentioned and easy to overlook. In fact it turns into ""We will all wear gold"".. The next movie/book is CALLED Mockingjay for Pete's sake. They never mention that she hears rumor of District 13 existing. President Snow smelling like blood and roses is cleverly shown with blood flooding into is champagne glass but if you don't know what your seeing it could easily be missed. There are just so many major things left out that it ends up feeling vague and boring. I know there was a lot of information to cram into an already long movie but even if they just showed clips of Peeta and Katniss falling asleep together, or having a moment of doing something other than staring into a crowd being sad. Show him comforting her when no one else could. Show the gamemaker showing off his Mockingjay watch, just little snip its to help the story along. Made me sad that such simple changes could have brought so much more life to this story.  People who are upset with the ending, it wasn't terribly well done but it ends as the book does and will pick right back up.

6012445,1,B00FL31UF0,"The story is rubbish and the heroine is clearly stupid (does Hollywood have a ""thing"" about showing American women as stupid beyond imagination?? Think of Cameron Diaz in Knight and Day for just one example).
Also, the girl who plays the sister so irritatingly sounds like a man!! She talks, as do so many American females, from the back of her throat and sound more like a man than a female!! Think Marge in the Simpsons and you have it only this girl is worse!!
Mind you the American male is not exactly exempt. Take for example Percy Jackson movies where the actors/actresses are incapable of speaking for example P. J. like many of the others, we are told, is the son of a God. In the movie we hear he is the son of
a Gahd. I do not know what a Gahd is and I can not find the word in any dictionary. Of course I am aware of language differences but when it gets to the point that many words are all but unrecognisable it is no surprise more and yet more movies are being populated by British actors and actresses since they are readily understood and the actresses actually sound female!",1395792000,,1091,4.326829268292683

It's A SAD MOVIE BUT SHOULD HAVE LOTS OF ACTION WITH THE WAR AND REBELLIONS UNDERWAY. SNOW WILL DO ANYTHING NOW TO BREAK KATNISS. WATCH COIN SHE'S WORST THAN SNOW!!!

Haven't read the books, but this sequel builds substantially on the first installment and reminded me of The Empire Strikes Back - the 2nd of the original Star Wars trilogy.  Jennifer Lawrence and Woody Harrelson rock.  Great direction, great acting, great cinematography.

For a teen novel adaptation, the film hits marks beyond the Twilight franchise.  It's Lord of the Flies meets Logan's Run meets Green Arrow meets Run Lola Runthis film deserved its success.",1395705600,,521,5.228915662650603

6012477,5,B00FL31UF0,"Its been awhile since I read The Hunger Games trilogy, but I think that my dislike for the finale clouded my opinions of Suzanne Collins popular series. Catching Fire the movie, did an excellent job of reminding me why I like the series and making me fall in love with it all over again.

The story is simple; Katniss and Peetas bold plot at the end if the 74th Hunger Games made them the capitols sweetheart and the symbol of rebellion in the districts. The President wants to kill Katniss, the districts want her to lead them and Katniss just wants to live her life. Oh, wait did I say simple? Nope, just because these stories are written for the YA crowd doesnt mean they are simple. A friend of mine who saw the film with me, but hasn't read the books said it perfectly that is one of the most intense films I have seen in awhile. Intense is right.

It starts and everything seems fine. Katniss is still out there hunting with Gale and her family is safe, but it is not fine. Katniss lives in Victors village with Peeta and Haymitch. This issue is that Peeta is still angry to discover that her love in the games was just an act and just because both his mentees survived hasn't erased the memories or alcohol from Haymitchs system. And to make matters worse, its beginning again. The 75th Hunger Games are looming closer and Katniss and Peeta must put on their smiles, hold hands and pretend that all is well. If they don't the evil and way too involved President Snow will make them pay.

As Katniss, Jennifer Lawrence is perfect. There is some touch and go in the beginning as she has no real chemistry with Liam Hemsworths Gale, but once Katniss  blooms and decides to fight, the magic happens. She becomes the girl I fell in love with on the page. Part fierceness, part vulnerability and all around stubborn. The character is brilliant. A true hero in a world of Bella Swans, a girl with a bow and arrow.  Katniss Everdeen the girl on fire is one of my favorite statements in the literary world.  And Jennifer Lawrence makes that statement. She gives the kind of performance that makes you forget her public persona, forget the Oscar and the blond hair and simply see Katniss.

I have always been a fan of Peeta Mellark. I shipped him with Katniss and Josh Hutcherson reminds me of that love in every scene he appears in. Peeta may be stronger than he looks, but he is no warrior. He hasn't struggled to survive like Katniss and Gale did for all those years. He had a comfortable life, considering. He was the Bakers son and the differences between Katniss and Peeta makes them perfect compliments for each other. Peeta is great with people, with manipulating a crowd and making people love him. Hes aware that hes going to die in the games and just like in the 74th games every move he makes is to ensure Katniss survival. Which, in my humble opinion, makes him the best possible romance hero of teen fiction in awhile.

Whats great about Catching Fire, is that you see his change. Hes still Peeta, but hes smarter, craftier and yes we even see the boy with the bread kill. And thats the heartbreaking thing about the games. They aren't just the symbol that keeps the districts in line. They are also the killer of innocence. The reaping and the games changes everyone it touches. It takes children and makes them survivors and killers and then calls them victors. No one wins the hunger games, not even Prim who Katniss volunteered to save. In Catching Fire, Prim is older, less innocent and stronger. She takes duties her mom cant handle and completes them without a flinch. Another causality, another child Katniss couldn't save.

Talking about save, surviving and victors, Catching Fire understands the essence and heart of the series and brings it to life. I found myself wiping tears from my eyes through out the film at the injustice, at the sadness and at the heart of these characters. There is an amazing scene where the victory tour lands in District 11 that had me in tears. Our victors walk on to the stage and there in living color is an image of youthful, beautiful and innocent Rue. It gets to Katniss. It gets to Peeta and it gets to us.

Emotions aside, Catching Fire is an amazing work of cinema. I don't think Suzanne Collins is a Pulitzer writer, but her story is definitely cinematic. The world she created is as theatrical as it is real. The director does an amazing job of always making us aware of the space we reside in while being intimate with the characters. Panems Capitol is different from District 12 and 12 is different from District 11. The Hunger Games series is an art directors dream with its ability to be visually scrumptious in one scene and heartbreakingly drab in the next. Its powerful, the visuals in the film and its intelligently utilized by the filmmakers to give us everything possible to make the world we read about as real as possible.

OH! And to anyone who is wonderingSam Caflin and Jena Malone are AMAZING as Finnick and Johanna. Like electrifying. Caflins Finnick jumped off the screen at me ten times more powerfully than the character in the book. Watching this cocky, pretty and self-centered victor carry Mags on his back is just breathtaking and reveals so many amazing details about his character.  I worried about how the filmmakers would portray Johanna, she can come off like a bitch, but Jena Malone got it. Johanna is angry. She is pissed off and a little crazy and the filmmakers go it right.

I really enjoyed this film. It is filled with intense action, thrills and emotional scenes that reveal the humanity in each of the characters. Theres a bit of touch and go in the beginning, due to the awkward intro scenes with Gale and dialogue that serves simply as exposition. Still, fans of the series will love this film and I think that the people who still haven't read it will run to their nearest bookstore and get it in hand. This is a series about so much more than love triangles or kids killing each other for sport. Armed with an incredible cast of supporting actors and more importantly, incredible characters, Katniss Everdeen incites a revolution.",1395705600,,6135,4.576502732240437

6012555,4,B00FL31UF0,"Catching Fire the movie was so much better than Catching Fire the novel (and I have never in my life said anything like that before!  The movie is almost always never better than the novel).  Thats not to say that the novel wasn't good, however some of the problems with the novel version weren't introduced in the theatrical version; in the novel Katniss became such a cry baby  someone who kills to survive and is the leader of her household should not have been so easily blindsided when it came to the Capital.  Also, banging your head crying over unrequited love (maybe unrequired love because she still doesnt know which love she wants) is eye-rolling over dramatic.

All that aside, since the filmmakers didn't introduce those blaring character discrepancies into the movie, I really enjoyed Catching Fire.  Jennifer Lawrence has proved again that she is perfect as Katniss  so much so, that I prefer her portrayal of Katniss better than Suzanne Collins rendition of Katniss.  The other actors (Josh Hutcherson as Peeta, Liam Hemsworth as Gale and Jenna Malone as Johanna) are absolutely solid.  Jenna Malones portrayal of Johanna actually made me empathize with her character (empathy was not something Johanna eluded in the novel).  The scenes where the citizens of the Districts risked life and limb to give Katniss the show of solidarity was emotionally stirring  because you could feel the oppressive nature of the Capitals governing.

I highly recommend this movie (I also recommend the book.  It is still a really good read).  I am so glad that with the Hunger Games franchise we are presented with a heroine who is strong (but not superwoman), smart and kind.  I will say that the who will she pick scenario is tired and makes Katniss selfish (since shes placing two other peoples feelings on hold while she decides which one she wants).",1395619200,,1852,4.891025641025641

It really isn't until the end that you feel things develop and we have the cliffhanger.
It's like watching a different version of the first movie, really same premise, same characters, you could ask why they didn't combine this and the first movie into one. Oh well they didn't and we have what we have. That said it is well done, definitely a good film and you are on the edge of your seat at the end
Katniss is a little annoying when you break her down, she is angry at everyone, always miserable and in love on again off again with two different men, oh well she is the hero I guess that's OK.

As for the DVD/Bluray combo pack, this is a great deal. You get an HD image that is beautifully shot (which includes the awesome IMAX scenes in the arena), and over two hours of bonus material that blew my mind away.
As for the film itself, I have included my facebook review from when the film released in theaters.

Just got to see The Hunger Games: Catching Fire! The excitement that's been building up for this movie has finally calmed down. Is that a bad thing? Here's how it goes: I would give the film a rating of 10, but there are three things about it that depressed my optimistic view of the film. I'll try not to spoil anything.

1. It felt a bit rushed, and they left out some key elements that are spilled out in the book. I kind of expected this, so I wasn't too upset. But they did follow the book very well.
2. It didn't have the same amount of vigorous thrill that the first film embodied, and instead of expanding that superb energy and making it bigger, they took away a pound of that flame and left it a tad flat. This is probably the biggest downfall of Catching Fire, most likely caused by the switched director and short time frame for filming, making it feel like a Hollywood style action adventure epic rather than the ultimate movie you we're hoping for.
3. The ending is quite a cliffhanger, and feels like it was thrown in at the last moment(probably true), giving you this feeling of ""Great, another sequel."", rather than ""What's gonna happen next?!"" I was almost going to say that the movie was terrible because of the way they left me at the end. But then realized it was intentional.
I realized that this last scene probably was shot during the filming of Mockingjay Part 1, which started filming just two months before Catching Fire came out.

Because of this, I have a bit more mercy for the movie, and decided that Catching Fire deserved a good 9 out of 10. Yes, my expectations we're too high, but the good news is they are spending more time working on the climax, which hopefully comes off as a more focused installment to make up for the few downfalls in it's sequel. Improvements: The Visuals are stunning, and pay a punch to the fake-looking mutts in the first film. the emotion and integrity still hold strong, which is Catching Fire's greatest asset besides Jennifer Lawrence. And finally, even though it hangs you on your toes, it gets you ready for the next chapter, Mockingjay, opening next November.

6012584,4,B00FL31UF0,"I'm not a big fan of many sequels, although sequels these days seem to be generally much better than they used to be.  In the case of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I can't honestly say that I enjoyed it as much as the original, but I neither can I say that it is ""bad"" or merely ""okay"".  It is still a very well-done film and Jennifer Lawrence does such a great job of inhabiting her character that she's a joy to watch.  The appearance of Philip Seymour Hoffman is also a plus.  With the upcoming sequel (the final sequel?), however, it will be interesting to see who they come up with to fill his role.  Again, I'm not going to wade into attempting to go over all the plot-points, etc of Catching Fire.  Suffice it to say that if you enjoyed the original, you'll probably enjoy this sequel as well.  It's very well done and there's some all around good acting, costuming & set designs that are just about guaranteed to keep you entertained.

I can definitely recommend this one.",1395446400,,983,4.392265193370166

6012587,4,B00FL31UF0,"Sharp as a flaming arrow and as explosive as when one hits a forcefield, ""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" is the rousing, thought-provoking action epic the first movie failed to be. Director Francis Lawrence has done the book justice as he provides the pacing and the gravity the series needs as novelist Suzanne Collins' series grows into an epic drama set in a world on the brink of revolution. Though the move is not perfect due to the number of 'conveniences' the movie uses to add themes to the plot, Catching Fire definitely caught my eye and mind while watching the blockbuster.

The movie presents a kind of conundrum for me. Theres no doubt that I mostly liked it a lot more than the first one. Its better written and certainly far better directed. Despite a central problem that was expressed by one of the characters in the course of the film, and a general tendency toward pomposity, the first two-thirds of Catching Fire is truly compelling. Unfortunately, that last third is something else altogether. Once the movie gets to the actual games, it feels like its on auto-pilot. Its like sitting through that second Quidditch match in the Harry Potter films, which is to say, its kind of a drag. Even a brace of CGI effects don't really liven it up. I will concede that the twist at the very end promises a more intriguing sequel, but its not enough to undo the tedium of the game  at least for me.

The first sections of Catching Fire are very well done in building the sense of oppression. Most of the characters are better drawn this time (of course, they still have all those dopey names) and a lot of the dialogue is surprisingly sharp. Some of the scenes are quite striking. (Thank you, whoever ditched shaky-cam Gary Ross for the more professionally inclined director, Francis Lawrence.) The growing unsettled nature of the populace as Katniss and Peeta undertake their victory tour is beautifully structured. The sequence in the capitol where Katniss dances with game designer Plutarch Heavensbee is not only nicely staged, but their dialogue and its delivery is spot-on with many hidden messages.

However, its also in this part of the film that theres an exchange between Katniss and her mentor, Haymitch, in which he tells her that she could never be worthy of Peetas love for her. Right then, something that had been niggling at me through both films came into focus  hes right. Theres just not much to the Katniss character. Im sure Ive just committed some kind of heresy with that statement, but really, without Jennifer Lawrence in the role, Katniss would be pretty unbearable. Even with her, shes still incredibly oblivious to just about everything. Shes largely self-centered  at least self-absorbed  and always greets the fallout from anything she does with utter astonishment. She remains blissfully unaware of whats going on around her. She didn't realize that her mockingjay-gown transformation would play badly for the safety of its creator, Cinna? Seriously?

Overall, though, the film has much to recommend it. The character portrayals are often brilliant. Harrelson and Elizabeth Banks are far better  and deeper  here than they were in the first film. Philip Seymour Hoffman is brilliant in a tricky role. Stanley Tucci  with that ghastly orange tan and blazingly white teeth, like one of those vapid E! Entertainment News creatures  is the perfect incarnation of the smug TV host with smarmy familiarity and endless fake gushing. Not only that, but he manages to suggest an undercurrent of fear of falling out-of-favor with the ever-fickle powers that be. This is the sort of thing that raises the film a notch more than its rather facile depths. Too bad that the most of the last act is so much a retread of the first movie. Hopefully, the sequels will get around that.

6012603,5,B00FL31UF0,"Oh, this movie was great! No complaints whatsoever.

To be honest, whether it be the first installment, this one, or the next, I will always have doubts regarding how true-to-the-book and how well the directors will be able to bring this original book series to life, but I was blown away by Catching Fire! The Capital, the districts, the reaping were somewhat how I imagined it, and a WHOLE lot better. I would even say that it surpasses the first film by far. The games were more thrilling and had me on the edge of my seat!

The movie starts off with an eerie background music, and a scene of Katniss spending time in her district before the victory tour--that usually takes place after the games, and you really get to see how badly the victors are scarred from its experience. Jennifer Lawrence was amazing ... Not much to say  about Josh Hutcherson and his character, Peeta Mellark, but how as equally fantastic they are. The actors, in fact, were all enticing, they really brought life to the characters they portrayed.

The training scene was surreal! I litterally had to stop the movie and rewatch it again and again. Like I said, way better than the first film.

The plot. Before Catching Fire was out in theaters, there were rumors that it will be split into two parts, I was not happy with that, which is why I am glad the directors and screenwriters decided to make it all in one film. With such a complex story, you would think how impossible it is to cram the events and details all together in a two hour or so project, but it worked! There are people who complain about ""this detail was not in there!"" or ""why did they not add this or that scene?!"" Well as I see it, the film has most of the important details and you have to keep in mind that not every single detail will be able to fit into the time frame, directors have to make the story make sense, as well as satisfying the different types of viewers, get over it.

Can I watch Catching Fire without watching The Hunger Games and still understand the story? Sure, why not? In this film, there are flashbacks of the previous installment, so even if you did not read the books or watch The Hunger Games, you will still be able to enjoy it. My family did! Though, by watching the the first film, you will be able to better relate with the characters, which makes the events much more emotional and thrilling.

Not much more to say. Simply, I Loved it and it was one of the best movies I have watched, in the YA genre, for a while. Cannot wait, for third installment, Mocking Jay! The ending of Catching Fire really has fans amped up!",1395446400,3,2603,4.399168399168399

6012614,2,B00FL31UF0,"We all know that PSH died of a drug overdose, but I wonder if he did it intentionally after watching the second Hunger Games movie ""Catching Fire"" in which he played one of the lead roles.

The movie was bad. Real bad. If I had a big part in making that movie I would maybe consider taking enough drugs to forget that I did or possibly even ending it altogether like he did. It's hard to believe that the same people created the second movie after the first was so good.

""Catching Fire"" has great effects but the acting is sub-par, the plot is absolutely ridiculous, and there were more holes in it than Philip Seymour Hoffman's arms.

The movie started off quick and I would have forgiven them for glossing over a few missing pieces in they had continued along the revolution storyline. But out of nowhere, the plot turns into this ridiculous burlesque of the first movie in which it's replayed in its entirety substituting the dead people from the first movie with really weird new characters as contestants for the spontaneous Hunger Games with the winners. Just dumb.

I guess I'm mad only because there was so much potential with the first one and even in the beginning of the second but after the freaky girl strips for no reason in the elevator, the crazy monkeys walk away because they're scared on the beach, and Peta keeps dying and coming back to life, I was just laughing.

6012636,4,B00FL31UF0,"I have to admit, I was VERY late to the Hunger Games party.  When the world went crazy for the franchise in written form, I completely tuned it all out.  I was, in my mind, above all that.  This was for teens, right?  Im sorry, but I don't read those Twilight books nor do I see those movies and I was not about to waste my time with some teen oriented book on kids killing kids (seriously, why is this a thing?) and so despite all my friends kids raving the books, I looked at them like they were crazy and went on my merry way.  When the film was made, I was also pretty much a staunch objector.  I was looked at as a villain in the fantasy lives of my friends teenage kids who all wore their hair in braids and started pinning every picture they could find of current it girl, Jennifer Lawrence.  I was kind of adverse to anything Lawrence related at that time.  I had seen a handful of her films, including her Oscar nominated turn in 2010s Winters Bone and I just found her incredibly wooden and uninteresting.

Then I was on a plane to Europe and my friend leans over to me and says have you read The Hunger Games yet? and I looked at him in shock, like WHY ON EARTH DID YOU READ THAT? and he proceeds to tell me that he read all three books over the course of a single weekend (he was apparently sick with the flu) because his daughter was reading them and he thought they were great.

It just did not compute, like at all.

When I got home he wound up lending me the first book and I, begrudgingly, started to read it.  I read it in a weekend and I instantly wanted more.  No, its not a great book.  The writing is actually pretty terrible in parts, and the concept is kind of ridiculous (and seriously, this is for kids?) but the way that the story is told is pretty engaging and I had to admit to myself; I kind of understood the draw.

So I saw the movie.

I have since become a fan of Jennifer Lawrence.  I know some people don't see what I see in her, and I completely understand the aversion to her.  Shes crude and rude and she babbles and says things that could be perceived as offensive and she seems incredibly attention hungry despite trying to play it all off like shes above it, but shes hilarious and in a sea of celebrities who SAY.EXACTLY.WHAT.THEY.THINK.WE.WANT.TO.HEAR. I love that she just says whatever comes to her mind.  She also proved me completely wrong about her talent when she blew me away in The Silver Linings Playbook, so I was not only a fan of her persona, but kind of fell in love with the complete package.  No, shes not my favorite actress out there (and I do find her fans kind of ridiculous) but I like her now.

Oh, shes good as Katniss, since that applies to this particular conversation.

Ok, so after seeing The Hunger Games I was intrigued to where the rest of this story was going to go.  I snatched up the second book, Catching Fire and prepared myself for the movie.  I kind of hated the book.  It felt like a real slump with drawn out segments that didn't further the story and a lazily conceptualized finale that felt like a rehash of the previous games and left me soured.  It wasn't terrible, and it thankfully didn't have those stupid mutant dogs, but I was severely letdown.  I knew that Id see the movie and I knew that Id read Mockingjay (I haven't yet, but I will before the movie is released later this year), but that was more because I hate leaving anything unfinished and so I had to complete the trilogy, but I cant say that I was as excited to see Catching Fire as I had been to see The Hunger Games.

I finally watched this last night, after feeling uncompelled to go to the theater to see it despite being invited by the same friend who lent me the books to begin with.

This is one of those rare instances where the film is actually better than the book, and where the sequel is actually better than the original.  Still, this is far from perfect, but where the book felt tedious, redundant and apathetic, the film found ways to make each point feel necessary.  It omitted moments that didn't matter and nipped things in the bud, which was quite shocking considering that the movie is almost two and a half hours long.  It all felt so brisk.  Before I knew it, the movie was over and it seriously felt like I had only been in front of the television for like an hour, tops.

From a technical standpoint, this film is also a pretty big upgrade.  The visuals are much better this go around, and some of the cinematography is beautiful (but the lighting during the night scenes is awful).  The acting is a mixed bag (Sutherland is just perfection, but Clafin is shockingly ineffective, and while I wanted to love Malone I found her delivery kind of forced) but the returning cast mostly ups their game, especially Banks, who finds layers beneath the makeup.  Harrelson is awful here, completely phoning in each line, but thankfully his awful hair distracted me from his talking.

Yes, the cliffhanger basically forces you into actually seeing the final film(s), but this is the kind of film that makes you want to do just that.  In fact, Im almost tempted to skip the book and just see the movie; but Im pretty sure I won't do that.",1395360000,,5201,4.311728395061729

Books were better, as always you got more back story and explored the complicated society in them  I did like how they handled the flashbacks and PTSD.  I also liked how it kept everything in what she knew was going on at the time.  What everyone else was doing was a complete surprise to her so she was caught unprepared for how it ended.

I would guess it to be any barely functioning ninth grader as their maximum literacy marketing level. Acting was robotic with actors chosen for eye candy appeal. Plot wise, The Hunger Games is ""starving"" from a lack of creative storytelling; just farfetched improbabilities filling 3/4ths of film. Really now, bow & arrows (arrows magically replenish themselves) in this super high tech futuristic environment. Finally, it closes with the same old ending we've seen before, i.e. brief, boring scenes of someone quickly (for budgetary reasons) dying. Even then you really don't see much of that person's finale - they just cheaply disappear. The lack of an ending/closure is transparent storytelling for profit.
Watch ""The Starving Games"" spoof/parody of this movie for it's spot-on exposure of the juvenile mass marketing appeal of this movie.",1395273600,4,989,5.305732484076433

The overall tone of CF is more serious, Haymitch is more well, Haymitch. I loved it. Sure, some characters are left out, a few slight changes here and there, but I think the movie does the book justice.

For those who haven't read the books (you really should), there's action, stirrings of uprising in the districts, and a side of romance. There is a lot of development in the plot and characters in Catching Fire. The movie may seem a little lengthy around halfway or so, and you may question where all of the action is from the first installment - where the story is leading; rest assured it is all there and there is a point to the beginning. There is a bit more action in the book, such is the case when packing a 12 hour story into a couple of hours screen time.

I was entertained definitely and not bored. However I felt through the whole movie and after watching as if was in some sort of limbo state. Like I was in the waiting room waiting for my appointment. The aftertaste of this movie was sort of like we will make a decent film but lets just use this movie to set up the next one. I know there is a trilogy and am very much looking forward to the next one but I couldn't help like it seemed like it was sort of going through the motions of the first one without the ""gusto, pizazz, or that ""Je ne sais quois."" Good job overall but c or d for effort. I'm sure the next one will be better than the 2nd but I prefer the first hunger games to this one. With that being said.

watch that and then watch this movie!

It's a bit darker than Hunger Games (yeah, really!--maybe you thought that was dark enough?) although
actually there is probably less blood shed in this one.  Still as the plot thickens, it grows increasingly
serious.  I haven't read the books, and usually people who read the book first always complain the movie
left too much out.  Generally I feel a novel and a film have to be thought of as separate works of art and
not directly compared.  In this case, I think several pieces of plot or just...items were introduced that the
movie itself didn't explain adequately, though this was not enough to spoil my appreciation for the film
as a whole.  I had hoped the ""bonus features"" on Blu-Ray would go into more detail about the background
that the movie didn't have time to fill in, but no...not unless it's in the ""commentary soundtrack"" if you have
another 3 hours to listen to THAT.  Regardless, the characters, the plot, the visuals, everything in Catching
Fire fully lived up to the quality in the first film.  Turns out there are 2 more movies to go; like the Harry Potter
series, it will take 2 films to deal with the conclusion.  I intend to watch both.",1395187200,,1306,4.5905172413793105
6012708,4,B00FL31UF0,Would recommend reviewing the first movie.  Somewhat confusing in the beginning.  I will watch again to see things that I might have missed the first time.,1395187200,,155,4.923076923076923
6012709,5,B00FL31UF0,I thought this movie was exciting and full of great symbolism.  I loved all of the characters but I was a little confused by the weird people of the city at first.  The main character was believable and the plot was complex enough to hold my interest.  I want to see the first one now.,1395187200,,285,4.1454545454545455
6012710,5,B00FL31UF0,"'Catching Fire' stayed very true to the book. The acting was exceptional, as always, and the story line was very interesting. My girlfriend and I were on the edge of our seats. The cinematography was beautiful.",1395187200,,210,4.861111111111111
6012711,4,B00FL31UF0,"It lagged, a lot of holes in plot. It was good but the first movie was great. I will watch when the next movie comes out",1395187200,,120,3.6538461538461537
6012712,4,B00FL31UF0,"First Movie is still better,  but this is more of the same reloaded.  I know its a Triology, and its good.  The Movie is Alegory for a Communist Revolution...sad...  This is propaganda,  and people are devouring it.  I enjoy a movie for a movie's sake, but I am keenly aware of the intended underlying message.  Sad too, taints great actors and a great movie.",1395187200,,359,4.515625
6012713,5,B00FL31UF0,"I was not expecting such a well-rounded movie. I had read the book and usually the book is different from the movie, but this was surprizingly similar.

6012714,5,B00FL31UF0,you will enjoy the movie like you never enjoyed a movie before. it keeps you off your seat the entire time. Totally recommend it .,1395187200,,130,4.24
6012715,4,B00FL31UF0,"Having read the book, Catching Fire, I can say that this is a very faithful adaptation.

The production value is much higher in the second installment, and you can really tell from the scenes in the arena.  The main actors (Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson) seem much more comfortable in their roles. I still think Donald Sutherland is terrible in this role. He just has the same blank look on his face no matter what he's saying or what's being said to him. Frustrating!  The new characters are pretty interesting and they do a good job setting up the twist at the end.  Philip Seymour Hoffman is completely forgettable, as he suffers from the same problem as Donald Sutherland---blank expression, no emotion in the way he speaks.

Most of all, this movie has me excited for the next installment, even though I think it is stupid to split it into 2 movies.",1395187200,,859,4.662251655629139
6012716,5,B00FL31UF0,Superb sequel to an amazing first movie. The cliffhanger was well done. I have never read the books but I enjoy these movies.,1395187200,,125,4.478260869565218
6012717,3,B00FL31UF0,"I liked it, but my husband didn't. I'd have to agree with him on it being a bit tedious at first. (victory tours)  Being a fan of  Face Off, I found myself looking at each character, their make up and what the wardrobes. Great job! The transition of the bridle gown into the Mocking Bird was awesome! I did notice that the only time Katniss had an ""accent"" when was she called out for Peter, which was a bit off putting. All in all, was it a great movie? No, but Am looking forward to the next release as it did leave me wanting to see more. Perhaps the next sequel will have a bit more ""meat"" for the audiences to chew on.",1395187200,,623,4.056910569105691
6012718,5,B00FL31UF0,"I loved this movie!  I loved the book and the movie followed the book pretty closely (they don't always).  The cast fit their parts, the scenery was good.  The only thing I didn't like was the fact that it ended and we have to wait for the next part to come out.  I would recommend this to anyone over the  age of 13.",1395187200,4,317,3.9682539682539684

6012722,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie, like its predecessor, tries hard to preserve the feel and as much of the plot as possible from the book.  It does a pretty good job.  The acting and special effects are good and there is a lot of intensity throughout.  The main beefs I have with it have to do with the plot and they are just as they are in the book, so what are you going to do?  I was happy to purchase this film and I'm sure I will watch it a few times.  Any weaknesses you find with it are pretty much taken from the book.",1395187200,,504,3.854368932038835
6012723,5,B00FL31UF0,This one is Less violent I think.  Can't wait for the third and final installment.  The third Book was amazing.....,1395187200,,115,4.7
6012724,4,B00FL31UF0,"I've read all the books, and in my view, the book was better than the movie. I think there was only so much they could fit into 2+ hours, but I wanted more time in the arena, more Finnick, more about the other tributes. The books goes so much more into them. It took an hour to even get in to the arena. The ending was an abrupt cliffhanger. Since I've read the books, it's not a big deal for me. I really liked Peeta in this one. He came across as such a decent and genuine person. I am totally Team Peeta now. He is so selfless. Katniss is too, but Peeta has much more of an emotional core and likeability. The acting is superb. Jenna Malone stole every scene she was in, but I wanted more of her. I love all the characters and there were some great action scenes (loved the crazed orangutans). I bought the DVD because I knew I'd watch it in the years to come. I knew I'd like it, but there was just something slightly missing for me, therefore, the four stars rather than five. Overall, a great movie. If you haven't read the books, you will probably enjoy this one more than the first Hunger Games movie.",1395187200,,1109,4.162790697674419
6012725,5,B00FL31UF0,"If you haven't seen this movie yet and you have read the book, this series for whatever reason is closely following the books, and it's well worth seeing.  The entire cast pulls it off amazingly well.  Jennifer Lawrence should won an Oscar for this, and instead was nominated for a silly remake of the 70s (American Hustle).  I watched it yesterday and it was a so-so movie one would expect of a highly nominated yet not very well accepted by the consumer.",1395187200,,456,4.536585365853658
6012726,5,B00FL31UF0,I feel Jennifer Lawrence captured the depth and breadth of the novel in this movie. The action was intense - the acting superb. It made the novel come alive. I look forward to the next adventure!,1395187200,,195,4.444444444444445

6012728,5,B00FL31UF0,"Awesome movie...of course! The cast, the plot, the directing...everything was excellent. It flowed very well from the first movie to the second. It was less violent than the first, and it kept your attention from start to finish. I recommend this movie highly.

I was on the brink if tears a lot during this movie and laughing hysterically through other parts. I loved how they showed ""behind the scenes"" with snow, his granddaughter, and the game makers. I will definitely be purchasing this movie!",1395187200,,376,4.463768115942029

I wasn't sure this would be the case with Suzanne Collins book trilogy. I have been pleasantly surprised. I did like the ""Hunger Games"" and was looking forward to ""Catching Fire"" as well. Some who had seen it in the theaters said it was not so great so I started to watch with some trepidation.
 When it was over, I thought it was really very well done and thoroughly enjoyable. A very acceptable continuation of the story.",1395187200,,538,4.434343434343434

After renting the movie the streaming begins with a spinning circle in the middle of the screen while streaming, then 2 or 3 minutes of viewing, then more streaming for a few minutes.

The second movie was just as good, and does a pretty darn good job of following the book (which really impressed me as the imagery I had in my head after reading the second book, i did not think they would be able to do it justice, but I was wrong)
I do recommend reading the books first, as this movie has to be confusing to someone that has not read the books, but this movie was a great addition to reading the book.",1395187200,,547,4.074074074074074
6012746,4,B00FL31UF0,"I love the special effects and the foreshadowing done in the movie, but I'm sorry, it's not nearly as good as the book. Your imagination does so much more than the actors and editors in the studio. But I love J-Law and they did a good job with the interpretation of the arena, so props there. I just don't like how they far they deviated from the book. If you're not a reader, then this movie is awesome!",1395187200,,404,4.1923076923076925

While Catching Fire continues this streak for the first half it seems to stumble in the second. Right around the time Cinna (Lenny Kravitz) gets beat, the series starts to feel beat (and I braved crowds of 12 year olds to see this on opening night). The arena redux just isn't that exciting, especially since hardly any of the contestants even want to kill each other by that point. Then there are weak elements such as scary fog, killer monkeys, and (worst of all) ""tick tock"".  And ok, ok... we get it that the girl is the stronger District 12 contestant, but how many times did Peeta need to be carried? And Katniss' shooting the sky was even more lame than he was.

6012766,5,B00FL31UF0,"Jennifer Lawrence shines once again in the second installment of ""The Hunger Games"" and her supporting cast was just as good.  We see Katniss and Peta grow closer to what will inevitably bring them together as they did in the books but you also see heartbreak when the two are separated.  You start to see that the love that lied about in the first movie to save them begins to manifest into something real for the guy (Peta) that everyone wants her to end up with.  It was also amazing performances from Woody Harrelson and of course an incredible performance by the late/great Phillip Seymour Hoffman.  If you are a fan of the books and you loved the first movie and love Jennifer Lawrence then this is right up your alley.

6012805,5,B00FL31UF0,"Okay,it's not Band of Brothers, but as stories go, this second installment was much better than the first.  The plot was actually a plot, Jennifer Lawrence ACTED (not as flat as the first movie), and a Effie Trinket became humanized and less vapid.  One really odd, unexplainable anomaly; Philip Seymour Hoffman had more than minor role, and seemed pivotal for the second movie, yet his credits fall far, far below Lenny Kravitz..You will enjoy the move, it's packed with action.",1395100800,,479,4.975

6012810,2,B00FL31UF0,I was only able to sit through maybe 20 minutes. I thought it was boring and sort of ridiculous. The 2 are is for makeup and costumes.,1395100800,,134,4.0

Everything was fabulous - the graphics, costumes, scenery, and the cast were  attention grabbing until the very end - - - - and I'm still trying to figure the ""ending"" out.  WHAT HAPPENED? It's left us out in limbo, and with Philip Seymour Hoffman gone, how will they create a trilogy?  Will there be a third ""Hunger Games""?  Who's lying and who's not? Was there ever a revolution?

6012814,3,B00FL31UF0,The second of the Hunger Games movie was a good story though it was very obviously meant to let you know that at least one more movie is needed to finish telling the story.

But it was a very good movie, and it tied into the first movie well.  The story is pretty original, being derived from the books on which it was based (which I never read), and it is one of the few films that I have seen do a very good job of crossing filming styles between traditional-filmmaking and reality-style filmmaking.  This film does a wonderful job of adding just enough of the new style to bring it some edge, but not so much that it obscures the storyline.  From what I have seen from both the frist and second films, the main characters are moved by love despite everything that they are made to endure, and in my opinion, that is really makes the characters shine!",1395100800,,790,4.281879194630872

6012902,5,B00FL31UF0,"I absolutely love this movie.  The story is superbly written. Ms. Collins is a wonderful, imaginative, fabulous author.  I first became aware of this trilogy through my book club. Some moms were on the fence about reading it with their children, while others spoke from experience and gave opinions about reading it with their kids.  Catching Fire is Actually less violent and less gory than the Hunger Games, which is the First story in this trilogy.  Catching Fire is also my favorite of the three.  It comes down to personal preference as to whether you feel your child can handle this movie or not. However, I am here to tell you my opinion is that unless they are very sheltered children, you will enjoy this movie together.  The story is riveting, and there are many life lessons in it, which include that of love and sacrifice.  I definitely give it five stars.",1395014400,,868,4.671052631578948

6012906,3,B00FL31UF0,This sequel to the Hunger Games has been butchered in the cutting room floor.  It views pieced together instead of fluent.  None of the characters get a chance to become beloved or hated.  I was disappointed.,1395014400,,208,4.722222222222222

So I excused myself in order to see what the fuss was about. Surprisingly, what I found was a striking cautionary tale, with a far deeper respect for humanity than is typical in Hollywood today. It is always good to see movies with elements of truth sprinkled throughout--and by truth I mean Christian truths which we all unquestionably accept today, such as the equality of all men--though the producers themselves do not realize they do this.",1395014400,6,607,4.79047619047619

The movie though - while most books to screen lose ALOT in the transition (Twilight)  -- The Hunger Games are in good hands and definitely are taken from the books. There are some things I've noticed missing but not a lot.

When I first read the books I loved them but couldn't help thinking that this was brutal and not really for kids.  Same with the movies - there are underlying character traits and heart but on the surface - it's teens killing teens in brutal games that change with the push of a button or the whim of the ""powers that be.""",1395014400,,601,4.155172413793103

producer and director stayed fairly close to the books.  Not to mention, of course, that Jennifer Lawrence is a top notch talent.
The only complaint I might have is leaving the audience suspended, having to wait for the other sequels to come out which is
not exactly around the corner.  Of course, in order to extend the franchise, they also chopped the final installment into two parts

It followed the book very closely with some minor omissions, but added some important dialog between Snow and game maker Heavensbee (behind the scene) because of the storyline is basically Katniss's pov. As we know, Catching Fire topped the domestic box office for 2013.  Although they were few negative ratings, this movie rating was excellent. Acting was superb - especially Jennifer Lawrence, Jena Malone, and Mr. Hoffman.(RIP). Last but not least , the special features in the blu ray disc was amazing.  It showed how the movie was made.

Starting from the scene where they take her up the plane, it just started becoming ridiculously non believable.

So they assumed she was going to cut power?

The ending was like, what, that was it?

By the way everyone keeps talking about government, us government, world government, etc...

but am I the only one who kind of sees it in a bigger level? as of this world, it kind of feels like the dome where the games occur, where things happen and everyone is just surviving and then if there's a god he's just watching.

To me it kind of hints at rebellion at that god or whatever governing power on this universe.

6013023,3,B00FL31UF0,"These books have sold super well, and having not read them, I don't know why. The movies also seem to be selling pretty well, and I can see why. The first installment was terrific. However, this second one was a little more boring. Oh, it had action all right (bows and kissing type), but the whole time I was watching this I couldn't help but feel a sense of deja vu the whole time; especially once they got up their tubes and were actually in the game and fighting it out. Some of the drama seemed like it was the same as the original hunger games, but with new words. This may have made more sense in the books, but on film it felt too much like the original. The uprising was important to the story, but inevitably the story led from hunting illegally in the woods with a love interest, to choosing who was gonna be in the games, to how do we plan and strategize, to lets show off some skill and test the other people in the game, to the game (complete with people dying, but this time in new and different ways), to her surviving. The ending makes some possible suggestion that in the final movie/book there is less of a focus on the games and more of a focus on the political climate and the impending uprising hinted at in this movie. Let's hope cause that next part is gonna be split into two movies (part one and two) this year and next and I would rather see what happens in that arena rather than the games themselves.

6013025,4,B00FL31UF0,"Catching Fire is the second installment in the Hunger Games franchise.  Catching Fire, in my opinion, is a touch better than The Hunger Games, but still not without its notable issues.  I have many of the same problems with this film that I had with The Hunger Games.  I did not read the books so I cannot make any comparisons but I did hear that they cut a lot out.

The film takes place a year after The Hunger Games.  Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and her friend Peeta (Josh Hutcherson), who were the victors of the last Hunger Games are on tour of all the Districts.  Everyone sees Katniss as a light of hope due to her actions in the Hunger Games.  Rebellions start to break out in all of the Districts.  The president, played by Donald Sutherland is not happy about this, because this could trigger a full-scale revolution.  He tries to get Katniss to her side.  Katniss herself does not want to be a symbol and only wishes to keep her and her family safe.  However, the president forces her and Peeta to participate in the 75th Hunger Games.  This time the victors of previous games will face off.

The first issue I have is with the first 30-45 minutes.  I personally found it a little boring.  The first 45 minutes is Katniss and Peeta on tour and her being a symbol of hope for the people while trying to please the president so he does not kill everyone in her District.  I know why it is there, but I just got a little bored after a while.  I heard in the book that plotline took even longer.  However once they announce the Hunger Games and we are introduced to the other combatants then things pick up again.  I did not find the first part of this film quite as boring as the first part of the Hunger Games.  I found the first part of the Hunger Games to drag on a bit too long and it is clich.  It was not bad, but it was too long.  Here I was less bored.

Another issue I had was the shaky-cam during the fight scenes.  I had this problem with the Hunger Games as well.  During the fights the camera moves too much and I could barely make out what was happening.  In fact I found there to be more shaky came here than the Hunger Games.

Aside from Katniss and Peeta, the rest of the cast gets very little development, like in the last film.  However, I did like the supporting cast more here and they get a bit of development, which is more than I can say for Hunger Games.  I also found that the ending was too abrupt.

However, despite all of that Catching Fire is still a good film and I do like it a bit more than the Hunger Games.  The main reason is that the story is stronger.  The Hunger Games mainly focused on introducing us to the character and setting up the world.  It mostly focused on the games themselves.  Here it focuses more on Katniss herself and her being a symbol of hope for the people.  It also deals with the inevitable revolution and introduces key characters that are relevant later.  I also like the supporting cast more.  I felt that they had more life and energy even if they do not have much development.  I also like the design of the actual games more this time around as well.  Some of the obstacles they put in are very creative.

The effects are amazing.  Again the design and obstacles of the Hunger Games itself are very well done.  I like how there is more future tech used here.  The world they are in still looks amazing.  I did not see this movie in 3D so I cannot say how good the 3D is.

Overall, if you like the Hunger Games, then you should like Catching Fire.  I did like the Hunger Games quite a bit despite everything I said about it earlier.  I did think that this was a good film as well despite the problems I had.  The effects are great, the cast is great, and the acting is on point.",1394841600,,3751,4.216901408450704

However, still a fun movie to watch, and I enjoyed it. Five flaming golden stars, if for no other reason than I really enjoyed looking at Katniss.

Katniss Everdeen is so popular in all of the sectors that people are beginning to protest and revolt against the Capital in protest of their own personal treatment, lack of food and overall way of life.  They feel like slaves working for the benefit of the Capital just because they lost a war long ago.  They see Katniss' bravery and fighting spirit as the motivation to fight for a better way of life.  President Snow plans a new special edition of the Hunger Games and he hopes to disgrace and ultimately see Katniss killed in action....

This is an excellent film and the storyline is tight and well presented.  The special effects are well done and the acting is superb.  Jennifer Lawrence just does a great job in playing Katniss and she really is an acting talent and box office draw.  My family watched this film and we liked it more than the first film.  That is unusual for a sequel but in this case it is true, at least for us.

The movie ends abruptly but we all know that there is a final episode coming.  I enjoyed this movie and I recommend that you buy the DVD.  It does have a lot of replay value and it is a good story.",1394841600,3,1168,4.307339449541284

Having seen the first film, I didn't really know what to expect as I felt it had a very tidy ending that didn't require any follow up story.  However, I'm very glad the story continued.  It's a solid, more substantial film that the first (more funds were clearly put into it -- but not in an overblown way.  The story was very gripping and well paced.  The only complaint I have, keeping it from getting all five stars, is that it has a very jarring end.  The pacing was thrown off as a result and the film just kind of cuts out.  I understand more are being made, but I didn't feel as if any satisfaction was provided and no third act was in the film.",1394841600,,786,4.158940397350993

So you pump the volume on dialogue scenes then get blown away when it switches to an action sequence. I have a Sony stereo receiver with over 40 settings.  I have tried them all in many different combinations, and have come to the conclusion that Amazon does not have any idea how to stream video.  They should take notes from Netflix.  Netflix does 7.1 surround with volume normalization and I can actually put the remote down and enjoy the movie.

probably won't see this review in the listings but if you do take heed and don't waste your time or money. Even if I did

6013106,5,B00FL31UF0,"I am a fan of the Hunger Games series and have read them several times; in fact I'm reading ""Mockingjay"" again right now; after watching the closing scene I could hardly wait to start reading ""Mockinjay"" again. Admittedlly the series is rather gritty and may be hard to take for the sensitive viewer but there is little difference between this series and any hisotry of human conflict.

I think the movie does a good job of advancitng the story and sets the stage very nicely for ""Mockingjay."" I mentioned the closing scene in the title because it does a great job of setting the stage for the action that is coming next. The range of emotions expressed by Katniss' face, played byJennifer Lawrence, in those closing seconds spoke volumes about what was to come.

I've watched the movie several times now and must admit looking forward to seeing it again. The third book in the series, ""Mockingjay"" is a big change of pace and I am very interested in seeing how it is handled. I believe it safe to say that if Peter Jackson were directing the series it would definitely be a two-parter.",1394755200,,1086,4.592783505154639

6013128,2,B00FL31UF0,"Visually, the movie was fun, but completely at the expense of character development. The actors looked a bit ridiculous as a result. The scene where Katniss tells Gale she can't deal with thinking of him ""that way"" was probably the worst delivery I've seen in years. Especially after caring for him so diligently after he was whipped and running to him with such emotion when coming back to District 12. Very uneven handling of the character and her emotional state. How could the director use this cut in the movie? Was that really the best Jennifer Lawrence could muster? And there was some real, emotional character development in the book with Katniss's relationship with the Avox, which was completely ignored in the screenplay, and could have made us care a bit more about her and Peeta. Editing--ugh. Directing--ugh.

Of course, I thought the books declined in quality as well, so if you thought all of the books were awesome, then you and I probably aren't on the same page. I doubt I can drag myself to see the whiny, self-obsessed Katniss from book three, especially if the editing and directing remains this poor.",1394755200,,1124,4.823834196891192

6013159,3,B00FL31UF0,"Story similar to the first: same gruff, self-sacrificing heroine, this time it is Peeta who must live no matter what, as lead experiences the bounty of loving and being loved by two fine young men; same villain, this time displaying hints of paranoid insanity (never like when the villain is insane, just doesn't work for me), a new group of killers supposedly pitted against one another in a new game. A main problem for me is film doesn't show how the rebellion got it's key players and how they're organized. Another problem is the villain: how did the rebels manage to survive the Donald Sutherland character's hyper-vigilant eye, right under his nose.  Also, don't think it's a good idea to have the lead outside the story, i.e., ignorant of the rebellion; she should be in the thick of the rebellion as the Capitol is making her life and the lives of all she knows, hell.

Because this story presented the rebellion as a fate accompli and didn't show the nuts and bolts of how it came to exist, rebellion not believable.

The film story is missing a level in the Capitol's hierarchy, the character who would be Donald Sutherland's aid, the first officer, the person who'd actually enforce Donald Sutherland's edicts.  Donald Sutherland's organization is too thinly presented here. Where are his spies, where are the citizens wanting to curry favor, and do so by presenting him with any morsel of intel? No Capitol intrigue, no Capitol competitors josling for position. Where are the ambitious characters who, knowing the Donald Sutherland character dislikes Katniss, attempt to have her killed to get into his good graces? As presented there seems to be Donald Sutherland, and the military; he appears alone at the top: isolated, old, crazy, vulnerable, cruel and ruthless - such a leader seems ripe for rebellion, but worse storywise, he's not frightening (as he doesn't even know who his own enemies are) or believable. What is the source of his power that he can hold all the presumably millions of people to a system which clearly serves so few of them? This is crucial information the screenwriter fails to provide.

As written, the Donald Sutherland character doesn't work, for me, as a villain: he's not smart - he unknowingly chooses a games master who is plotting his downfall, yet he spends his time bullying a teenager and murdering and terrifying untold numbers of citizens.  Why is he the ruler, what is the source of his power, why has he organized his world and his people the way that he has, and why is his behavior tolerated?  The screenwriter doesn't say.  The villain is paranoid and crazy, but a power mad, insane villain is lazy writing. It begs the question, how does he remain in power? And when the screenwriter provides no answer the audience disconnects.

A competent villain, someone who is frightening and intelligent, is at the top of their game. As played, I wonder why this villain has remained in power.  Why 13 districts, why some held in abject poverty while others live in luxury, what purpose that serves, and why the majority of the citizens on that world accept the system? I understand why the poor, disenfranchised do, they have little choice, but why everyone else seems to is a mystery to me. So I guess what I'm saying is the world order in the story makes no sense to me, and it's never a good thing when the story makes no sense.

Regarding Katniss she is aided time and again and in a more believable story she'd have been murdered long ago by Donald Sutherland's assassins, considering his power, his fixation on her and his total antipathy towards her.  Since apparently she's going to be the rallying point for her people, a source of hope, not a good idea storywise to have her come to the attention of her far more powerful competitor when she has little more than a bow and arrows to defend her. My sense is she's alive in this story because she's the heroine (sort of like in a Tom Cruise Mission Impossible film where the Tom Cruise character performs impossible stunts and get's perhaps a scratch and survives because he's the hero - Katniss is like a Tom Cruise Mission Impossible lead here). Film stories where the lead survives impossible odds simply because they've got top billing don't work for me - prefer better written stories. (I like Tom Cruise's work, just not a big fan of the Mission Impossible franchise because the lead is never at risk: he's the hero, he will survive. Similar problem with the Fast & Furious franchise's over the top stunts where it's impossible for two characters to be ejected from two speeding vehicles, meet in midair over a bridge and land safely. When humans repeatedly survive death defying stunts, I'm pushed right out of the story, even when the actresses/actors themselves are appealing. There's not enough appeal in the world to explain survival when an ordinary person experiencing such events would die. The leads, if they are human characters and not magical beings, simply don't have the skill set to defeat death, no matter what other talents they possess. I wish screenwriters would make their fictitious worlds operate along the same lines of reality as my world. When they don't, I'm unable to enjoy the story.)

A young female lead works best in a well written, well structured, well executed, story. This film is none of those. It's strength is it's actresses/actors. Also good costume design, set design and cinematography.",1394755200,,5441,4.806417112299465

Catching fire was a grey movie but the DVD was obviously poorly made. I'm so sad,1394668800,,372,3.9078947368421053

HOWEVER, I am extremely irritated that I have had amazon prime for years and ordered this I the first day I could but got it a week late. I'm very angry with amazon about this.",1394668800,,437,4.265060240963855

6013180,5,B00FL31UF0,"I read the trilogy and of what I have seen of the movies so far, I feel they both deserve 5 stars. the plot has action and has a lot of social commentary, and a beware to all those who don't recognize the widening gap between the haves and have nots. The acting is deserving of the books.",1394668800,,288,3.9827586206896552
6013181,4,B00FL31UF0,"Much thanks to director Francis Lawrence as he brought a lot more depth and emotion to an action oriented young adult film (though it can be fun for anyone who is mature, as it touches on many political and social themes).

The plot is something I never go over in reviews as it because redundant on a site like Amazon where plenty will tell you and it has its own description. Now for the review: Short and Simple, mind you.

Jennifer Lawrence has become one of the most well respected actors to ever rise in Hollywood at such a young age (Tom Cruise being the only one that I doubt she'll ever beat in terms of popularity and rightfully so). In this film she adds to her character and it shows that she is not treating this franchise as a money bag and rather very seriously.

The late Phillip Seymour Hoffman was excellent as per usual in this film and will be missed in the 4th chapter of this franchise. He also plays a vital role in this film so if your a fan, watch it.

The rest of the cast are solid and bring more emotion into a more emotionally driven social themed movie then they really need too, which isn't a complaint but rather a welcome for audiences.

The action is quick, yet long, but effective. The biggest and best thing about this films action sequences is they don't seem as rushed as the first, and for the most part the shakey cam ""look"" is gone, thankfully.

Overall if you want some romance, some action all underneath a fairly deeply themed social/political film (although the younger you are the less likely you are to understand the themes depending on how fast you mature, lol) then this is for you. All the same if you just want a big scope blockbuster, this is also for you.

8/10 Stars, 4/5 Stars.",1394668800,,1733,4.38006230529595

6013194,3,B00FL31UF0,"I just now watched the BD. Exciting and excellent acting, filming, and Dolby DTS 7.1 sound, spoiled by flaws and an overused Cliche ending. I haven't read the second or third book, and probably won't after seeing this film.

What should have been an excellent adventure movie started way too slow, and then lost its gloss with unexplained and physically impossible events. The adventure takes place where the laws of physics exist with futuristic devices.

That said, Katniss Everdeen never runs out of arrows, which is reminiscent of the old western movies with six shooters that never ran out of bullets. That could have been addressed with arrows parachuted down from her sponsors.  But it wasn't. Poor screen writing, and why didn't the producers, director, technical advisers, etc., catch that flaw?

The fatal flaw was the firing of the arrow and hitting the inside of the dome to foreshadow the final impossible arrow shot. Not possible at that distance. (There is no magic element in this movie. Everything is sci fi, but follows the laws of physics.)

(Possible Spoiler) The previous flaw was compounded by the impossibility of an an arrow pulling 30 or 40 pounds of copper cable with it to the top of the dome, to provide an exciting event.  Firing an arrow with a light string attached would actually limit the range of the arrow, because of the drag and mass of the arrow. A copper cable, yet!

And, finally, the last few seconds of the movie where an old cliche is used to justify our belief that Katniss, despite all that has happened,  is filled with determination, leading to part 3 and 4 of the story.

What should have been a perfect script for a movies grossing hundreds of million bucks, was spoiled for me by the inattention to technical details.

I was torn between two or three stars. I gave it three, because, despite the slow beginning, I enjoyed the adventure.",1394668800,,1886,4.757668711656442

She was a rising indie-star and I wanted to see what she would make of a big Hollywood blockbuster.  I wasn't disappointed, she is a great actress, but I was grossed out by the violence and perverted innocence of the first movie.  This movie was much darker, grittier without all the blood-stained children of the first movie.  It was an interesting premise and I am looking forward to the next installment.

I'm not disappointed with the movie, but the blurb on the packaging said that you were purchasing it digitally at the same time.  And specifically mentioned that it could be stored in the ""Cloud""  Since when I bought the first in the series, it too was available in the cloud, and since I've bought my Kindle Fire I've watched it on my Kindle, I thought this was the same.  BEWARE!  It is not!  It is for some other program and does not translate to Kindle!  When I called to find out what I was doing wrong, (I thought  I was making a mistake in trying to activate it) they researched the program for me, and discovered that no, it did not support Kindle fire.  Because the advertising on the product was deceptive, they gave me a refund so that I could purchase it digitally, which I did, and promptly installed on my Kindle Fire.

I guess that's what happens when you start dating a new guy, you put the movies you both want to see ahead of your personal must-sees. But anyways, watching this movie with everything going on in the Ukraine and Venezuela just left me feeling even more moved and in touch with the story. It's simply just a story about people struggling for freedom.

The VFX and sound mixing is perfection and the cast is simply remarkable, Jennifer Lawrence just oozes with talent and there's no one better to play a ""cheeky victor"". I watched it two times in the same day because I simply loved it that much. My boyfriend who refused to watch these movies with me caught the end of it (crazy island scene and so on) and even said I think I just have to stop being so stubborn and watch these movies. If he can say that, it means this film is doing something right. Just to finish, this film only gives you a dose of the brilliant Philip Seymour Hoffman but he is riveting as always may he rest in peace.

It just left me hanging...which is what the middle movie of a series will often do. I knew it was going to happen when I sat down to watch it.  I just got so engrossed in the movie that I forgot about it. This film sets up the action for the next two films.

6013247,1,B00FL31UF0,read a book instead. better for us. definitely wouldn't let a child watch this junk. it's time we stop paying Hollywood to feed us a bunch of crap!,1394668800,,147,4.285714285714286
6013248,5,B00FL31UF0,Only two scenes from the book were really missing and only one of those two I think should have been included. What a wonderful rendition of a great book!,1394668800,,154,4.344827586206897
6013249,5,B00FL31UF0,This is one series where I can say the movie is better than the book.  The acting was great.  The movie was suspenseful.,1394668800,,120,4.173913043478261
6013250,4,B00FL31UF0,I don't believe that this was as good as the first one.  I feel they spent too much time on the romance and feelings of the characters and then rushed the details about the game.,1394668800,,178,4.085714285714285
6013251,4,B00FL31UF0,It moved the story along nicely and it gave us something to look forward to. Chicken lickers unite under a blue moon.,1394668800,,117,4.363636363636363
6013252,4,B00FL31UF0,"Jennifer Lawrence and a couple other actors made some sketchy performances throughout the movie, but the overall portrayal of the story, spectacles and whatnot were pretty solid. I'm obviously not a skilled or qualified critic, but as a casual moviegoer, this was a pretty great movie compared to the usual junk that gets dumped in theaters these days. Looking forward to the third movie!",1394668800,,388,5.078125
6013253,5,B00FL31UF0,"i find the books exciting and capturing. and so are the movies. full of action and yet emotional! a film that does the book justice, so i find!",1394668800,,143,4.142857142857143
6013254,5,B00FL31UF0,Entertaining. Stuck close to the book. Good acting especially by Katniss. Great action scenes. Can not wait to watch again.,1394668800,,123,5.2
6013255,5,B00FL31UF0,"Having read the books, I know they couldn't put everything in the movie but its pretty close.  Some characters were left out but I still loved the movie.",1394668800,,153,4.464285714285714
6013256,3,B00FL31UF0,I know this one stuck closer then to the book but something was lost when it hit the bug screen. I was so anxious to see it and so disappointed when I did. To many moving parts for me.,1394668800,,184,3.7435897435897436
6013257,5,B00FL31UF0,My wife and I watch very few movies but we are very much into The Hunger Games and we are anxiously looking forward to the next episode.,1394668800,,136,4.074074074074074
6013258,3,B00FL31UF0,"It was your typical ""tween"" movie. Left lots of holes to be filled in, hoping they get filled in with the next installment. It just wasn't as suspenseful as the first one though... Left something to be desired.",1394582400,,210,4.552631578947368
6013259,5,B00FL31UF0,I usually find part 2 or a sequel to be very disappointing but this movie is great. Having read all 3 books I didn't think the effects could be achieved in a movie but was pleasantly surprised. Can't wait for them to make Part 3 - Mockinjay,1394582400,,240,4.127659574468085
6013260,4,B00FL31UF0,Wish there had been a longer version. Can not wait for the next movie to come out!!!  Really need to read the books.,1394582400,,116,4.043478260869565
6013261,2,B00FL31UF0,"I don't know how these folks have given this movie 5 stars.  This movie was extremely slow and boring!  There was no real excitement anywhere in this movie.  The first one was full of action, this one was more like watching a political action committee debating paint drying and the effects of drying paint on the environment.  Or watching another of President Obama's lying speeches of how great ""Obamacare"" is.  Seriously, this movie was slow and extremely boring.",1394582400,,466,4.923076923076923
6013262,4,B00FL31UF0,"Good acting, esp Sutherland, heart warming love interests but not enough skin.  Ending not strong.  Wish to see episode 3!",1394582400,,122,5.05
6013263,5,B00FL31UF0,Watch it and then you will find it shocking too. You just have to rent it. Love it. And share it.,1394582400,,97,3.6666666666666665

6013265,4,B00FL31UF0,Overall the movie was good. I found myself getting bored in the beginning but eventually the movie started picking up pace. It was a bit predictable (even though I have never read the books) but still fun and entertaining. I don't think I would waste my money buying the movie but it was a good movie to rent.,1394582400,,309,4.344827586206897
6013266,5,B00FL31UF0,"For those who haven't really read the novels, it could be a little hard to follow since the movies aren't long enough to encompass the whole book and the details but compared to other movies based off books, well this one take the cake.",1394582400,,236,4.386363636363637

6013269,5,B00FL31UF0,Lots if action and romance. This movie will have u caught up in the romance. You will be on the edge of your seat.,1394582400,,114,3.7916666666666665
6013270,4,B00FL31UF0,"Liked the continuation of the story line, the action, love Jennifer Lawrence.  Certainly looking forward to the next Hunger Games.",1394582400,,130,5.5
6013271,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie basically sets up the next one. The tone of the movie definitely has changed and I am looking forward to the next one.,1394582400,,129,4.2
6013272,4,B00FL31UF0,Tons of twists and turns. Only 4 stars because it ends in a strange place where you must read or wait for the sequel.,1394582400,,117,3.9166666666666665
6013273,5,B00FL31UF0,"Perfect.  I saw it in the movies twice, I have watched it 3 more tomes, and I am ready for the Mocking Jay to be releases Nov 21.  See ya 'all there.",1394582400,,149,3.625

6013275,4,B00FL31UF0,The love triangle develops.  Philip Seymour Hoffman not enough screen time for him!!!  Whose side is he on?? Worth watching if you like this series.,1394582400,,148,4.88

6013277,3,B00FL31UF0,"Spoiler alert! This is an entertaining epic adventure movie, but it just ends with a cliffhanger. Now we have to wait for the sequel (part 3). Unlike the Lord of the Rings trilogy, the middle movie doesnt stand on its own.",1394582400,,222,4.439024390243903
6013278,5,B00FL31UF0,Just an awesome story. Stayed pretty true to the book. My husband liked it and that's saying something :) He might be reading the last book because he can't wait for the other movies to come out.,1394582400,,195,4.297297297297297
6013279,5,B00FL31UF0,We really enjoyed this movie.  We bought it the day it came out and had movie night.  It has been a long time since my husband and I have done that.  We found it a great movie for just that.  Now we wait for the next release.....,1394582400,,229,3.8085106382978724
6013280,5,B00FL31UF0,"I read all three books in the series and feel like the movies capture them well, so far.  I cry when I see Rue's picture on the screen in District 7 when Katniss and Peeta visit on the tour.  Her siblings were so adorable.  The ending of the movie leaves you wanting more.  Can't wait for Mocking Jay.",1394582400,,301,4.137931034482759
6013281,4,B00FL31UF0,move was good I wish there was more action. there were parts that were hard to understand but overall im satisfied and I am looking forward to the next.  but I would not purchase this movie. Im glad I rented first.,1394582400,,214,4.219512195121951
6013282,4,B00FL31UF0,"I found the movie enjoyable, and liked it more than I liked the first movie.  Character development is mediocre, better action sequences, and less linear plot lines.  I felt there was more depth with this movie, even if the character development seemed shallow.  I felt the same way with the books.",1394582400,,298,4.803921568627451
6013283,5,B00FL31UF0,As I have not read the books I found this movie great. A friend of mine had read the books and said that it was pretty close and we are just waiting for the last installment of the book.,1394582400,,186,3.7948717948717947
6013284,5,B00FL31UF0,the movie was as good if not better then the first one. can't wait for the new one to come out.,1394582400,,95,3.5714285714285716
6013285,3,B00FL31UF0,I Liked the first one better ; too many alliances. It didn't seem to have as much action and then the teaser left a lot of unanswered questions.,1394582400,,144,4.178571428571429
6013286,5,B00FL31UF0,Very nice job following the book and even though it is a 2.5 hour movie it keeps you so engaged that you don't realize time has gone by. Great movie :),1394582400,,151,3.903225806451613
6013287,5,B00FL31UF0,"great series, did not think it would be as good as the first but was surprized it was great, can't wait for the third one",1394582400,,121,3.88
6013288,4,B00FL31UF0,"Probably must my personal preference, but I liked this movie better than the Hunger Games part I.  I think the story line flowed more smoothly.",1394582400,,143,4.72
6013289,5,B00FL31UF0,Loved the twists and plot. My husband said it took too long to build up but I really liked how everything connected,1394582400,,115,4.2727272727272725
6013290,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie has a lot of action so it is a good idea to watch it on a sizeable HD flat screen. Storyline is like most movies from books; it somewhat to mostly follows the outline of the book. Would see again and possibly purchase it.,1394582400,,232,4.065217391304348
6013291,4,B00FL31UF0,enjoyed very much look forward to the upcoming sequels didn't find it too long at all no issues with stream ran clear and consistent on prime,1394582400,,141,4.461538461538462
6013292,5,B00FL31UF0,"This was my favorite book of the trilogy and the movie didn't disappoint. What I love most about the movies is that despite being a pretty violent premise, the movies are pretty light on actually seeing a lot of the violent acts which is great. I don't have to see someone actually murdered to know that it wasn't fun.  Finnick was a great cast. Cannot wait for Mockingjay.",1394582400,,373,4.485294117647059
6013293,5,B00FL31UF0,Jennifer Lawrence and cast did a  great job.  Will watch over and over again.  Looking forward to third hunger games with Jennifer Lawrence,1394582400,,139,4.956521739130435
6013294,2,B00FL31UF0,"For what it's worth, the majority of this movie feels like a remake of the first. Until the actual start of the Hunger Games, the scene progression is almost identical; the movie begins in the woods with a hunting scene, some background regarding what the characters have been up to since the first movie (spoiler: not much), the tribute selection all the way to the parade through the capital, training arena w/ skill showcase, and the talk show interview before the start of the games. It's as if they took the same story board from the first movie and rewrote the dialog.

It is only after the games start that the movie takes on the actual feel of a sequel. This is where we are actually introduced to any new plot elements that set the stage for the final movies.",1394582400,2,768,4.485714285714286
6013295,4,B00FL31UF0,"it left me hungry for the next movie!  very well done - tough to believe that all of this material was covered in one movie, but they will use two movies to tell the last installment!",1394582400,,183,4.083333333333333
6013296,3,B00FL31UF0,"Good movie, a little long.  It was sort of slow in the beginning, but picked up in the middle. It followed the book well.",1394582400,,121,4.041666666666667
6013297,5,B00FL31UF0,"Absolutely fantastic. Yes, there were a few things cut out from the book, but that needs to be done and I think they did a fabulous job deciding which parts should be cut.  The parts that they did stuck to the book and were really well done as far as acting and cinematography. One of my favorite new movies.",1394582400,,308,4.220338983050848
6013298,5,B00FL31UF0,Much better than the first one.  It was awesome.  Our family had a nice family night watching it and look forward to the next one in the series.,1394582400,,144,4.107142857142857
6013299,5,B00FL31UF0,A great way to have a date with your wife without having to spend money for food drinks and popcorn at the theaters high prices. I love this series.,1394582400,,148,4.137931034482759
6013300,4,B00FL31UF0,"More epic than the first one!!!

6013301,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie is amazing every moment every second is sooo good!! Jennifer Lawerence is an amazing actress and I cannot wait to see the next one,1394582400,,141,4.461538461538462
6013302,4,B00FL31UF0,"WE read all the books, watched the first movie.  This was a very accurate depiction of the book.  Great movie, especially for the second in a sequel.",1394582400,,149,4.481481481481482
6013303,4,B00FL31UF0,First one gave me nightmares but the second gave the first context.  only watched because my daughter has expressed interest in watching them but she's only 12.5 yrs so wanted to screen first.  Will wait till she asks me again....won't show her without prompting.  Like the themes of solidarity and hope and subversion of the dominant paradigm but not sure all the violence needs to be shown in order to make that clear?  or maybe I'm just too sensitive to violence.  But kids killing kids is just a little over the line for me.,1394582400,,528,4.574468085106383
6013304,5,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed this film immensely.  i liked the 1st one but it didn't curl my toes but catching fire is terrific!  It was really fun to watch!  not many films are ""fun"" to watch you know.",1394582400,,183,4.027777777777778

6013307,5,B00FL31UF0,"I'm not going to write a long review or give spoilers. We watched ""Catching Fire"" this past week and loved it. We all know sequels to a successful movie don't always live up to expectations...but this one did. This series can be enjoyed by all age groups. I know, because I'm a senior, and I know the writers are targeting a younger demographic. Looking forward to the next installment. I think you'll enjoy this one...",1394582400,,419,4.6
6013308,5,B00FL31UF0,Jennifer Lawrence and the entire cast are perfect! The story comes to life in such an inspiring way! The only thing that could have made it better is to have slowed it down and little and possibly made it 2 movies just like the last book is going to be. Can't wait to the the rest of the series.,1394582400,,295,4.016949152542373

6013311,3,B00FL31UF0,"This movie isn't bad, but, it's unnecessary. It's basically a giant advertisement for the third movie when all the revolution stuff starts. The one good thing is that they removed a lot of the shaky-cam effect that ruined the first movie.",1394582400,,238,4.829268292682927

6013314,5,B00FL31UF0,"Better than the first yet still so much is left out from the important back stories. I know there is only so much time in a movie, but the back story is so important as well as the deep seeded feelings of the main characters.",1394582400,,225,4.022222222222222
6013315,3,B00FL31UF0,I enjoyed watching the first hunger games better compared to the second.  There was much more adventure compared to the first.  Jennifer Lawrence was an excellent actor as well ass her co-star.  The movie was dragged out for two hours.  It was clear that another hunger games is on the rise.  Hopefully it will be better than than catching fire!,1394582400,,345,4.683333333333334
6013316,5,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed the detailed plots, the fantastic graphics, personal drama interractions.  Did I learn anything?  not really, but it did show the better side of humanity in the lead characters and I appreciated that.",1394582400,,210,5.147058823529412
6013317,4,B00FL31UF0,"Even though its part 2 in the trilogy, and you know the end will leave you hanging, it is so worth seeing.  it's a film that keeps your attention throughout. Better than the first by far!",1394582400,,187,4.194444444444445
6013318,4,B00FL31UF0,"First off, let me say that I am not happy with the fact that they dropped the storyline of the pin-it tied haymitch and Katniss together even more, and gave a history to the uprising-showing that it takes time for things to grow-it seriously would not have taken that much more time-and they left the whole story of how Haymitch won out-so there is a loss of depth and complexity. While the movie makes a good, uncomplicated version of the book, there is a loss of depth (as I said), and a loss of it being a cautionary tale. I also thought that too much focus was taken AWAY from Prim and her mom-this was supposed to be where we see their medical prowess-where they are -especially her mom-are truly themselves, expert and confident-they again made her mom barely able to function. I DID like, however the use of Snow's grand-daughter as a mirror of how the Capitol and the other districts viewed Katniss and Peeta-how they were ingrained as heroes and a modern-day love-story/celebrity couple-And of course, Donald Sutherland was born to play President Snow-he could not be anymore perfect of a choice (the girl that plays his grandfather isn't too bad either). I also thought that what was kind of a mish-mash in the book, the Quarter Quell Games, was very well done, and you got to see Katniss and Peeta actually get to know eachother and bond-I LOVED how Joanna was done-she was perfect! As was Mags and even though I thought that the actor picked to play Finnick was too young-he was supposed to be as old as Haymitch-he was facile enough to show that Finnick was not as silly and slimey as he seemed; especially the scenes with mags.  The bes part about this movie is that it was well done, with solid acting and you get to see most of the characters developed into complex people, and see those people develop and learn more about each other-like when Katniss tries to write the rest of the victors off as simply killers (which a few are)but Haymitch points out, and then she sees for herself, that they are people like her, just dealing (or not) with what they had to do to survive. I found the final book the least enjoyable to read and the most poorly written and kind of annoying -it was kind of a morass, so it will be interesting to see how it is done-especially into two movies.  I always thought that the FIRST book needed to be put into two movies-the first one ending with the start of the games, and the second through her coming home. but what do I know?",1394582400,,2475,4.4734513274336285
6013319,5,B00FL31UF0,"It was almost exactly as I had imagined it reading the book. It was sad to see Phillip Seymour Hoffman, but he masterfully played his character. I cannot wait to see how they finish the series up! Family friendly, thought it may disturb small children.",1394582400,,252,4.622222222222222

6013321,5,B00FL31UF0,I liked this much better than the first Hunger Games. I was totally absorbed in the movie. The costumes and character development were great.,1394582400,,141,4.916666666666667
6013322,5,B00FL31UF0,Catching Fire does not try to slam all of the book content into small amount of time but put the more important items and slowed ot down enough to know what is going on if you have not read the books. Worth watching.,1394582400,,216,4.046511627906977
6013323,5,B00FL31UF0,Fantastic movie!  I loved the effort the director put into the movie. They really outdid themselves this time. High recommendation.,1394582400,,131,5.55

6013347,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie was so awesome ! They really stuck to the books storyline and brought it life. The actors that were picked were exactly how one would imagine them when reading. Even better than the Hunger Games.,1394582400,,206,4.594594594594595
6013348,5,B00FL31UF0,The movie is true to the book and visually astounding. Just about perfectly done. Jennifer Lawrence & Josh Hutcherson put in brilliant performances & look fantastic. I highly recommend it.,1394582400,,188,5.3

6013353,2,B00FL31UF0,The books were all about how loyal and emotional catniss is with the ones she loves. They do a better job conveying it than in the first one but i still feel it is severly under developed. Jennifer Laurence is doing well with what they are giving her but it just lacks the intensity that makes the story exciting.,1394582400,,313,4.322033898305085
6013354,4,B00FL31UF0,"I saw this movie in the theatres and while it was a good movie it did not stand up to how good the first movie was.  I have read all three books and the unfortunate thing is there is some critical information left out of the movie that is an underlying part of the main plot in the books that will happen in Mockingjay.  I don't want to spoil the movie in this review by telling you two key elements that are not clear in the movie, but should have been because of the role it will play in Mockingjay, please just read the books to see if you can figure it out.  Once I explained this to a friend after the movie, she better understood the story line, but if you didn't read the books you may have missed some things that would help you better understand the movie and will play a significant role in the next movie coming up.

The acting is about the same as The Hunger Games and Jennifer Lawrence does a good job at playing Katniss.  I adore Woody Harrelson and think he truly brings these movies to life, but then again his character in the book is the same too. The special effects are once again some of the best without looking cheesy.  The story, although either missing, or not making clear some elements, is relatively true to the book, but done in a slightly different way so the movie is not stale.  If you're looking for a long version of the arena like the Hunger Games, you may be disappointed.  But I believe that was necessary to get to some of the outside the arena information across without making the movie so long you lost interest.  I do look forward to the Mockingjay movie to see if the elements I refer to will be addressed in a different way from the book, which would be pretty cool.  Still overall a good movie and I do not regret seeing or buying it to go with my Hunger Games movie.",1394582400,,1812,4.210982658959537

6013357,4,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed The Hunger Games and this sequel did not disappoint.  It had just as much energy.  Most ""middle"" movies in a trilogy are not captivating.

6013361,3,B00FL31UF0,"The fire was somewhat extinguished with this one. I have never read the books, but that shouldn't factor in to the cinematic experience. Too much build up, not enough of the games. The clock theme was neat but by the time they figured it out, there was one battle sequence and that was basically it. Too much of a big deal was made of the elderly woman for her to just walk into the poison fog. Overall it was an okay build to the next movie, I do expect a finale worth watching.",1394582400,,479,4.161290322580645

6013364,4,B00FL31UF0,I liked this movie a lot but am not giving it 5 starts because it cut out just a smidgen too much for me to give it 5.  If I could it would be 4.5 stars.,1394582400,,153,3.25
6013365,4,B00FL31UF0,"I have to admit that I am confused about some of the premises of this world and the films have not filled in the viewer.  I now have the books.  Lawrence deserves all the praise she gets.  I have no idea why she is so watchable, but she is.  I even love Sutherland when he is playing evil incarnate.  A good meditation about what it takes to start a revolution and how everything has to be media packaged, even revolution, for our current population.

Something is missing in these films.  I can't put my finger on what.  They should be even bigger blockbusters than they are.

I literally found myself squirming in my seat like a student in ben steins class. I cannot believe that people actually get paid to write this garbage and how did so many famous people get into such a crappy film. I would rather read the article about the guy overdosing for 2 hours then watch this garbole. Can  I get a refund on time and money.

6013384,5,B00FL31UF0,"Before both the Hunger Games and Catching Fire came out, I will admit, I did not read the books. People say that you should read the books before seeing the movies because you won't understand the movies if not read the books. I disagree with that. After I saw the Hunger Games, I read the book. I am half way through the book Catching Fire. I read (and are currently reading) the books after to get more information on little things that confused me.

When I saw the Hunger Games, I was blown away of how great this series is. It might just be better than the Twilight Saga! The acting in both movies is spectacular. Jennifer Lawrence especially - what an amazing actress.

Both movies get 5 stars for me, without a doubt. I highly recommend both movies to anyone who likes suspense, action, and thrill. Both movies definitely get your adrenaline up and make you very excited, nervous, and wanting more. I do not recommend it to people (and children) who are sensitive to scary things and people getting killed, because in both movies there are some scenes that can be scary and graphic for children. I would probably say 13 and up is a good age, just as its rated - PG-13. I'm not sure if younger children would be able to handle it.

I also recommend you get both movies in Blu-Ray and have surround sound. I own Catching Fire on Blu-Ray and the quality of sound is spectacular. The Blu-Ray version really makes the games part of the movie sound and look amazing, considering parts of the movie take place at night.",1394582400,,1518,4.472924187725631
6013385,5,B00FL31UF0,"Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a warm, human believable story with exceptional - and rarely today - credible action and survival scenes.  If there is an Academy Award for best Action movies, this should be a winner. Well acted, well written, well directed and tremendous cinematography.  Action films tend to gloss over characters but we get to see a lot of character development from a lot of people, adding a lot of depth and interest to the movie; its not about waiting for the next action scene.  We want to know more about the characters and care about their futures.

The idea that the Hunger Games are a realistic panacea for desperate people is a stretch and that bothers me throughout the movie, but if you can accept the author's world the movie makers do all they need to to give you an exceptional, fun experience.

I enjoyed this more that the first film and eagerly look forward to the next film in the series,",1394496000,,924,4.575757575757576

6013396,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie is based on the second book of the Hunger Games Trilogy (The Hunger Games, Catching Fire and Mocking Jay) by Suzanne Collins.  This movie picks up right where the first book left off and focuses on the events that surround Katniss Everdeen's (protagonist) struggle with life under the Capitol's rule.  If you haven't read the books, no worries, these movies expertly capture the plot and draw you in without you needing to have read the books first; although, I do recommend that you at least watch the first movie (or read the first book) so you understand the post-apocalyptic world in which Katniss lives.  With that background out of the way I'll review the plot, characters and graphics (revealing no spoilers).

Plot: 5 out of 5 stars.
For those who are unfamiliar, the subject matter of the Hunger Games series revolves around the emotional turmoil of being selected to participate in games where you are pitted against 23 other people and forced to fight to the death.  It is actually a grim subject.  Parents, be prepared to talk with your children about heavy topics like death, government control and love.  I find that the topics addressed (through the eyes of Katniss) are presented straight forward, honestly and that her take on the world is actually pretty balanced considering what shes going through.
This movie is riveting!  It is similar to the first book in that it focuses on the turmoil (emotional and physical) of the Hunger Games.  It takes you through, again, the characters' reactions to the reaping and the games (i.e. lottery selection to participate in a death battle that starts with 24 people and ends with 1 victor).  Since this is a sequel to the first book, it expands on the relationship between the Capitol and the 12 districts that serve, in poverty, under the Capitol and sustain the lavish way of life that people in the Capitol live.  The whole movie gives you a sense that the world is out of sync and out of balance, with power firmly held by the Capitol who holds it over the districts and rules with fear.

Character portrayal (i.e. how close do they match the characters in the book): 4.8 out of 5 stars.
Typically, movies do not capture the protagonist's thoughts or emotions as well as the book does.  With one minor exception, I'd say that this movie wonderfully captures each character's emotions through excellent acting and stays impeccably true to the book.  The minor exception comes with some differences between how I envisioned President Snow.  I like Donald Sutherland as Snow, but he seems too grandfatherly to fully fit the role of a ruthless, purely evil albino-type of antagonist.  In the book he is portrayed as evil and smelling of blood and other sour/foul things, which is near impossible to translate into a movie.  Aside from that minor, minor detail, I thought that each character was fully developed and remained true to the book version.  If you don't care about book vs. movie details then I thought that the characters in the movie were wonderfully portrayed, displayed incredible talent in the range of emotions they captured (and this is an emotional movie that required actors to portray happy, sad, hurt, scared, betrayed, exhausted, confused and any combination of each).  I was drawn in by the acting and thought each actor and actress put on an outstanding performance!

Graphics and Scenery: 5 out of 5 Stars
This movie really portrays, through each scene, the world in which Katniss lives.  It highlights grey/dull districts and their poverty while showing the lavish luxury and brightness of the Capitol, using colors and camera angles to capture the way the Capitol holds power.  I feel like the movie perfectly captured the little details well and there wasn't a moment in the movie that deviated in any way from the book.  In fact, I felt like I was looking at (on screen) what my mind had conjured up as I read through the books on my own.  I feel like the director perfectly captured the essence of Suzanne Collins work and I wasn't disappointed by anything (which is a feat since Im usually critical of movies).  All in all, you feel like you are immersed in this futuristic world and surviving the games with Katniss.

Bottom Line: 5 out of 5 stars!  I loved this movie.  This movie touches on deep issues, like death, and focuses on the emotions most people experience when they lose loved ones or are forces to take life in a combat zone.  Yes, this movie made me cry it was too emotionally riveting not to.  Also, I feel like this movie did an outstanding job translating the book to the big screen.  Most movies Ive seen haven't done that (thinking of the Harry Potter movies and, even though I like the, the Lord of the Rings movies).  I would go so far as to say that the movie version of The Hunger Games and Catching Fire have far surpassed the book version in many, many ways and for that I highly recommend them.",1394496000,2,4923,4.714953271028038

The only problem is the ending of the movie leaves you wanting more, RIGHT NOW! but that is the same thing the book did as well. Guess I have to say, I can hardly wait until the final chapter is acted out.  Kudos to Jennifer and the rest of the cast, a Job well done again!  Donald Southerland, you played another great bad guy.  Dud, my hat is off to you as an actor!",1394496000,,538,4.235294117647059

However, it's still a fun watch.",1394496000,,348,4.421875

If you read the books, it stayed true to the text; it had to leave out some details only because of length of movie.  It was full of adventure and the plot and pace pulled you in.  I wanted more at the end but since there are two more movies after this, you were left wondering what was next.  But in a good way.  Great movie...worth the money!",1394496000,,414,4.049382716049383

6013414,5,B00FL31UF0,I have read the books two times.  Catching fire can stand alone and make sense to someone who had not read the book.  I think that the first Hunger Games would not be very good if you hadn't read the book.  Catching Fire was very well done and does an incredible job of portraying the sense of desperation in both the tributes and the common people.,1394496000,,349,4.257575757575758

My wife and I rented Catching Fire from Amazon (via our PS3) and after the 5th or 6th time of the download buffering and very grainy images we closed Amazon and I ran to the closest Redbox so we could finish the movie in peace. We have tried Amazon downloads in the past with the same issues (never have the problem with Netflix or the Playstation Store).

Harry Potter, the Twilight Saga, the Hobbit trilogy (sorry, now FOUR movies planned!) and now this.

Catching Fire moves and is a much better movie than the Hunger Games, still the general consensus was it could have gone deeper into the book to explain or set up certain scences in the movie better.

6013434,5,B00FL31UF0,"But this one is still pretty good and truer to the book. So I give it 5 stars.

The reason why I like the first one better is because this one feels slow in the beginning and I think they should put more emphasis on the hunger games arena portion. Also, they removed the portion where Katniss was trapped in the forest when the electrical gates were fixed.

I'm expecting a better third and fourth movies. The third book is much longer, so it's only appropriate that the make it into two movies.",1394409600,,495,4.311827956989247

My only complaint is that it was really hard to get through and skip the commercials.  Why is it, that if you buy a movie, you have to skip through all of the commercials?  I get that if you rent a movie, there would be lots of commercials, but when I buy a movie, and watch it 2 years from now, I still have to skip through all of the obsolete commercials!",1394409600,,524,3.961904761904762
6013438,4,B00FL31UF0,"that just explodes on the screen of THE HUNGER GAMES. She is the perfect Katniss. IN CATCHING FIRE, Lawrence is on fire. There is something exotic about her. It's something rare and unique and hard to pinpoint. It's not her spoken dialogue that tells the story, it's her amazing facial expressions. It is her  amazing look.
In the first film, Katniss and Peeta pulled off an amazing feat in the 74th HUNGER GAMES by both winning in a game where there can be one victor. They have earned the love and admiration of everyone throughout the land. To please their public, they create a fake romance, but trouble is brewing as people rise against their oppression. It is the ""romance"" between Katniss and Peeta that gives hope to the public.
President Snow is about to change the rules with the 75th HUNGER GAMES-the Quarter Quell. Although they have been promised comfort, safety and riches after winning their perspective HUNGER GAMES, the winners are all called back for the 75th games and only one can win.
CATCHING FIRE has a slow start as we see Katniss and Peeta living their fake lives as discontent fills the land. Peeta is in love with Katniss as she shows a cold ambivalence toward him. Here heart is elsewhere but is she actually hiding deep emotions for Peeta. Although the first half of CATCHING FIRE drags on, the sparks fly when The Quarter Quell is about to begin and it is breathtaking. The visual effects, the acting, the setting, the story suddenly are of the highest claiber.
It's here that Lawrence really shines. The participants are paraded in an arena in front of the excited crowds on their way to appear before President Snow. Katniss and Peeta arrive in a chariot. As they approach President Snow, Katniss gives him a lingering look of hatred and disdain that probably has never been seen on screen before. It's an uncomfortable moment between two enemies and that scene alone is worth seeing the film.
Let the games begin and alliances form as not everyone seems eager to fight to the last man or woman. It's an amazing contest with neverending twists. The writing is crisp and the acting is mesmerizing along with the visual effects. This is one amazing film.",1394409600,,2184,4.717277486910994

6013452,3,B00FL31UF0,"I really liked the first and hoped the second would be the best one yet but unfortunately the second was disappointing, to me anyhow. Perhaps this is like other books to video drama where each movie is just another chapter or two like the Lord of The Rings and of course Star Wars. The latter I had to wait 11 years for the final/first chapters and I was just as disappointed with it in the end.
It seemed as though the lead had lost her way falling very short of the brave young maiden in the first film. This time she seemed more reserved and unsure of herself and her ""love"" was much stronger and more of a leader.
The film's ending was the kind I hate, leaving more questions unanswered than answered and definitely leaving the door wide open for yet another episode. This was probably the biggest negative about this movie for me.
Will I watch the next in what is sure to be a series of movies? The probability is very low. I will most likely wait for it to play on Netflix or HULU where I can see it for free.
I really don't see how this has gotten such high ratings, at best the movie was a stepping stone to the next, more filler than substance but hey, that's just my opinion.",1394409600,,1185,4.224669603524229

Good special effects and a story that is getting darker, if that's possible, all the time.  Having Jennifer Lawrence is a huge coup here because as good as the movie is she's light-years better.  I had just watched American Hustle not long before this and found the story not interesting at all but the acting in that movie, especially Lawrence's, was spectacular.

6013463,2,B00FL31UF0,"I just hate all of these movies.  They don't make any sense, frustrate viewers with unrealistic situations/motivations, and none of the characters have any personality.  Sure, if you accept the premise that a government can survive with zero support from its citizens while doing horrible things to deliberately piss them off.  Even then, the script is just hit-you-over-the-head obvious.  I gave it two stars cause it looks pretty, and I enjoyed the action a little bit towards the end.  Not worth my $5 though.",1394409600,2,512,5.0476190476190474

Good acting, Jennifer Lawrence plays a Katniss whose character is emotionally aloof but vulnerable and strong;she can be stunningly beautiful, too.

A must see.",1394409600,,418,4.859154929577465

President Snow's intention to rid the reason for uprising, i.e., Catniss, does not go as he hoped.  The twists in this movie will surprise anyone who hasn't read the books first.  A more than sufficient cliffhanger, this movie (as was the case with the book) will likely leave you breathless with anticipation, hoping that the time between now and when the next movie is released will fly by.  The action is very intense, the romance and related conflict are perfect, if not maddening, the costumes and decadence of the capital is visually stunning.

Or how about actually developing the main and supporting characters to viable, multi-faceted, true to life dimensional quality?

6013503,3,B00FL31UF0,"So verse 2 of ""The Hunger Games"", for those of us who haven't read the books, is pretty much a re-visitation of the first movie, except without all of that pesky character development of all but the two ""sweetheart"" characters.  And even that seems stilted, with the main character caught between the man she ""loves"" (for some reason?), and the man she has to ""be with"", who even she says is probably the best person alive.  I am easily entertained by action movies, and I don't expect much in the way of plot, and so I was not much disappointed by ""Catching Fire"", except that there wasn't really anything new.  Same tricks, same visuals.  Same uncanny aptitude with the box.  Except for apparent inconsistencies/minor plot holes which I started seeing... such as the door to the security room on the transport train being continually left ajar, so that the main character can occasionally get ""peeks"" of what's going on in the real world outside.  The ending is...abrupt, to say the least.  I had several issues with the twists revealed in the final few moments of the movie, which I can't really detail here without completely spoiling them, but one thing I can say: there is no ending here to the story-line, unlike the impression after the first movie.  There is a break in the action, that is all.  So, don't expect to leave satisfied- expect to leave wanting to see the next movie, if for nothing else than closure to the story arc.",1394409600,,1439,4.6561264822134385

Just so very disappointing,",1394409600,,209,4.942857142857143

6013581,5,B00FL31UF0,I really enjoyed this movie as much as the first. I only wish they would have kept going. With the death of one of the stars and leaving it open for part three I'm afraid part three will be lacking.,1394409600,,198,3.975

6013589,5,B00FL31UF0,The only downside to this movie is the math you have to use to figure out how many times you can watch it in one day. Oh and just so you know: if you start at 8am and stop at 9pm (factoring in food and bathroom breaks) you can watch it about five times a day.,1394409600,,259,3.642857142857143
6013590,4,B00FL31UF0,This movie is just lush. Going from the Third World Mad Max slums and concentration camps of the districts to Capitol is like an Anti-Communist propaganda film of North Korea. Only the difference in wealth isn't as vast. The costumes are mind blowing. Even the white FN P90 machine pistols made an impact. They totally botched making Jennifer Lawrence look like a kid. Too sexy. Donald Sutherland as president Snow is the creepiest character since Hannibal Lecter. The script isn't the greatest but the book kind of goes dodgy at the end so they didn't have much to work with. Not quite 5 stars.,1394323200,,595,4.730769230769231
6013591,5,B00FL31UF0,I watch a lot of movies and like to collect all the worth while ones. This is a good one to have and arrived on time and  in great condition,1394323200,,140,3.6666666666666665
6013592,2,B00FL31UF0,"They're doing it like the Harry Potter Finale by making a double movie and splitting it in the middle. It's like watching half a show, then you have to wait a year or 18 months to see the finish. The movie would have been ok except for the way they cut it off. That part stinks.",1394323200,,278,3.982142857142857
6013593,5,B00FL31UF0,"can't wait for the next of the trilogy series..
jennifer lawrence delivers yet again
i'd say the rest of the cast fits in great but their characters don't fully develop throughout the storyline (with the exception of ""pee tah"")

While I pray we never ever have to use these methods to try to control a people, it certainly gives one food for thought. In the last days there will be famine and pestilence. We can learn much from these movies if we will but watch them with our eyes, but listen to them with our hearts. Enjoy! I certainly did. I don't condone violence by any means, but, violence has always been and will always be until the Lord returns and sets up His kingdom on earth.",1394323200,,635,4.0078740157480315
6013596,5,B00FL31UF0,"I loved the books and was one of the first in line to the first movie when it was released.  I liked the movie, but didn't run to be first in line for Catching Fire.  I waited until it was rentable on Amazon Prime.  It's very hard to like movies based off books because inevitably something is changed.  The Hunger Games was pretty close to the book, but Catching Fire was even closer.  I've heard some people say the movie was better than the book.  I don't know if I'd go that far, but I will say that it was as good as the book.  It certainly made me want to be first in line for Mockingjay when it comes out in theaters.",1394323200,,624,4.024390243902439
6013597,5,B00FL31UF0,I love the fast delivery with this movie. My favorite movie series next to Star Wars. I would highly recommend this series to all of my friends.,1394323200,,144,4.37037037037037
6013598,3,B00FL31UF0,"Why would they make us pay for another 16 minute preview of ""Divergent"" at the end?

6013600,5,B00FL31UF0,We enjoyed the movie. My daughters liked the movie and they enjoyed and had fun.  This is entertaining movie.  I would be recommend to watch this movie.,1394323200,,152,4.592592592592593
6013601,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie was phenomenal! It exceeded my expectations by miles. The main actors, Josh Hutcherson and Jennifer Lawrence, were even better in this film than they were in the first Hunger Games film. Two years I had been waiting to see this movie, and it was well worth the wait!

As with the first Hunger Games film, not all parts of the book could be included in the movie, and some things were changed. I think that the biggest or most obvious change would be the reason why the Head Peacekeeper whipped Gale. In the book, it is because he was caught hunting illegally, but in the film, it was because he interfered with a Peacekeeper who was trying to harm another citizen for breaking a rule. Gale is certainly not my favorite character, but I gained respect for him in that moment of the film because what he did, knowing that he would be punished severely for it, was a very unselfish thing to do.

Sam Claflin was perfect for the role of Finnick! He made the 'beautiful darling of the Capitol' truly come alive. Seeing Sam as Finnick made me appreciate and love his character even more, and now I am dreading what might be done to him in the Mockingjay films.

I also loved the subtle humor in the film. I couldn't believe it when Effie pointed out mahogany when she was inside President Snow's mansion! A very small yet amusing reference back to the first Hunger Games film. And when Plutarch Heavensbee was introduced to Peeta and Katniss as 'the successor to Seneca Crane' and Peeta said ""that's a tough act to follow!"" I had to laugh! I had not expected a comment dripping with sarcasm but at the same time dripping with truth to come from Peeta.

Once again, this film exceeded my expectations, and now it is going to be very difficult to wait to see the Mockingjay films! The film truly made the amazing Catching Fire novel come alive. I truly enjoyed seeing the elements of the novel brought to life on screen.",1394323200,,1923,4.485714285714286
6013602,3,B00FL31UF0,"It followed the book pretty closely, which I liked. The acting was okay. Always enjoy Donald Sutherland in president Snow. Entertaining, but not great.",1394323200,,151,5.333333333333333
6013603,5,B00FL31UF0,"Awesome,waiting for the third installment! Im wondering what special effects they'll have and how the love triangle will turn out.",1394323200,,130,5.55
6013604,5,B00FL31UF0,Love the series. Great movie. Finished with asking wife when the next one comes out. Can't wait for next one.,1394323200,,109,4.5
6013605,4,B00FL31UF0,The rest was boring.  Mom hated the books.  Was not a fan at all and I love the whole zombie apocalypse.  The hunger games was far more dystopian then zombies ruling the world.,1394323200,,176,4.2727272727272725
6013606,4,B00FL31UF0,"All this movie does is give Hollywood another shot at more money. This is not the end of the districts, only the middle. When a movie ends and leaves you with wondering how the next movie will turn out, is pure profit for the movie makers. This movie is just part 2 of 5 movies soon to come to a theater near you. Plus is Jennifer, she is awesome. Want to leave the theater wondering what happens next? Watch this one.",1394323200,,418,4.172839506172839
6013607,5,B00FL31UF0,Excellent!  Powerful cast.  True to storyline of book.  The left out parts did not diminish the story. The many subplots move along well.,1394323200,,137,4.869565217391305
6013608,2,B00FL31UF0,"Sit for hours in front of the screen no much happen, and the end SUCKS, the end of the movie feels like if you go to a restaurant and don't get served, or like if you go to the beach but never get there, or like .....",1394323200,,217,3.6382978723404253
6013609,5,B00FL31UF0,I thought they did a good job turning the novel into the movie.  The screenplay worked well.  They had to add some stuff into it so it is not just how Kat sees what is going on.,1394323200,,177,3.7567567567567566
6013610,5,B00FL31UF0,Catching Fire was a good movie! However I really hated how it ended! Soooo if u hate it when they leave a movie wide open for part 3!! Don't watch it!! Wait for part 3 then watch them together! I was mad!! Lol!,1394323200,,210,3.9069767441860463
6013611,4,B00FL31UF0,"Again, the hungar games is a modern gladiator type movie.  It's rating is to low for the violence it portrays.  The movie is good, the acting is good, but we have enough problems with teens and young adults that lack mental toughness.  These books and movie are targeted to preteen and teenagers.  Again, a good movie, with good actors, just a wrong rating.",1394323200,5,357,4.619047619047619

6013614,3,B00FL31UF0,"I liked the first one better but this one has to build the story first before the action starts.  I didn't like the ending but it reminds me of the second Star Wars (#5) movie I didn't like it until I saw the third installment and I imagine that was the point of the ending for this one.  Dont know if it was a good enough ending to make me want to watch the third and final episode., but having the first two I probably will buy it just to complete the series...",1394323200,,463,3.967741935483871
6013615,3,B00FL31UF0,"It is sometimes difficult to follow-up a winner of a movie with a winner of a sequel.  In my opinion, Catching Fire didn't rise up to meet my expectations.  Don't get me wrong, it's an OK movie and for the most part follows the book.  As for me, I would have enjoyed a bit more character development within the ally groups.  I also found Catching Fire did not hold my interest as well as the original Hunger Games.  But, yet again, Steven Tucci's over-the-top portrayal of Caesar Flickerman brought several smiles to my face, as well as an occasional out loud laugh.  Having higher hopes for Mocking Jay...",1394323200,,606,4.564814814814815
6013616,2,B00FL31UF0,"Let's say that I love how this film reflects the truth about our society and possible future.  It shows how the athletes, actors and all media/TV personalities are nothing more than paid by the powers that be and must do what they are told or lose their standing, wealth or even their lives.  It shows how the poor celebs and athletes can get taken from the slums to entertain the rulers, but can never really retire unless ordered to.

This film, and the previous one have this odd world where homosexuals and transsexuals are running the popular society while those who are not, control it all.  That mirrors real life!  If it becomes THIS explicit in the near future - you can sign me up for an armed rebellion!  This film also shows how FEAR is used to keep people in control - that is the ONLY way that so few can rule so many.  In this film as in real life, the rulers often use fear at will when they feel paranoid and think that they are losing control in order to keep others in line.  They never let the people live in peace or rest easy - as in real life.  It is as if they are in prison and they must be harassed 24/7 - as in real life.  For this depiction of reality - I commend this film.

Now, as far as the FILM itself goes - we all now how it would play out before even watching it.  Heroine engages in threat, then faces adversity, then triumphs.  It's the same story in every action film  We all know that the star never dies, so we can predict the ending.  Without giving it away, clearly another film is on it's way and it should play out much like ""Return of the Jedi"" or ""Return of the King.""  It is the same story about tyrannical rulers, then the people wake up and arrest their fears and triumph - until the next batch of maniacs come.

At 2:36, this film was about 45 minutes too long!  After the first 45 minutes - I was wondering where they were going and almost too bored to care any longer!  I then broke away and decided to watch the old ""Staying Alive"" film again.  Sad to say, but I found more joy in that film than in this one!  Once I came back to Catching Fire, I was still bored but determined to see it through.

I never did like the cinematography of these films, they look like cheap 80's B movies to me.  Nothing looks modern.  The eccentric drag queens looked totally 80's and nothing about this film looked 2013 to me.  The story was not deep, they characters not deep and I never understood the idea about having teams on a last man standing, kill everyone in site competition.  I suppose this was done in order to attempt to have some character interaction with each other, although I would have preferred a ""First Blood"" type of film instead, it would have been more believable.

Of course they needed an excuse to put Jennifer Lawrence back in the game and I hope there is not a game in the next one.  Other than the game itself, there is nothing interesting about these films.  It is like the first - Katniss is in a last man standing competition - everyone knows this but for some reason they seem to want to help some people by killing others in order to save them.  They do this knowing that only one can survive, which is kind of pointless.  I guess they needed something to keep it going.  Also, the poisonous fog was funny.  Lawrence is in and out of sleep, then she sees the fog and decides to touch it.  It burns her leaving blisters on her skin.  Then she wakes everyone and they begin to run, outrunning the FAST MOVING fog.  Then they become surrounded by the fog, but the fog pauses, giving them enough time to talk and decide what they need to do, then the fog picks up again!  They could have left that foolishness out of the film.

I never read the books - maybe they are more exciting, but I cannot understand how the books and these films are very popular.  The story is not that deep.  I like Harry Potter a lot better and I did not think that story was all that deep.  Maybe I should write one of these types of books to see how much I can make!  I will of course watch the next one just to see it and to see what they do with Hoffman's character since his part was going to be bigger in the next film.  All and all, this was boring!  This sleep therapy film did not stop it from making $500B+ dollars in the US alone.  I think it may still be in the theaters too.  Ah well, money is money...",1394323200,,4360,4.1738609112709835
6013617,5,B00FL31UF0,"I applaud the director for capturing the book so well.  He was nearly spot-on, without leaving out small important details, such as the red-haired mute woman in their dining hall in the Capitol.  Even though they didn't give her much camera time, she is a foreshadow for what's to come.  The director continued a solemn feel, like the first director, only he added small details for the purpose of Katniss' feelings toward her new life.  He changed her hair color and added hallucinations, which just adds to your hatred for the Capitol.",1394323200,,537,4.804347826086956
6013618,5,B00FL31UF0,The dvd was shipped  quickly. The Series itself is a great one. The director is brilliant. The scenes are awesome. I keep watching Catching fire all over again. I will end up buying the whole trilogy. I love the UV digital copy I can take it on the go anywhere.,1394323200,,261,4.22

6013621,3,B00FL31UF0,It was not as good as the 1st one. It was somewhat boring and dragged. It did not measure up.,1394323200,,93,3.7
6013622,2,B00FL31UF0,"Very slow start and really couldn't follow till the middle when things started to come together, a little.

Not  a fan of the very abrupt ending.  Left you hanging.",1394323200,3,187,4.8125
6013623,4,B00FL31UF0,I definitely had fun with this movie it and was well worth renting. If you liked the first one then you'll definitely like this one as well.,1394323200,,140,4.222222222222222
6013624,4,B00FL31UF0,This is a nice sequel to the first movie and once again it leaves asking for more.  Effects are great and the story is very good.  Looking forward for the next one!,1394323200,,164,4.09375
6013625,5,B00FL31UF0,Awesome movie. Can't wait to see the 3rd one! The ending to catching fire leaves you wanting more! Loved it!,1394323200,,108,4.45

6013627,5,B00FL31UF0,I really enjoyed the books and as usual the books are better then the movie but this is a tough movie to bring to life considering the nature of the movie but they did a good job waiting for Catching Fire,1394323200,,204,4.0
6013628,4,B00FL31UF0,"This one was a bit better than the first movie with more action overall, even in the parts where they were just kind of talking to everyone you could tell there was a lot of fear, tension, and anger which kept it from getting too boring.

The biggest issue I had with the movie wasn't even part of the story, but more with the overall director and how scenes had inconsistent details. When they were in the arena and Katniss had the bow and arrows, at every fight she emptied her quiver and it even showed it empty, then the next scene she would have them completely restocked magically. Also in the scene where they were chased to the shore by the baboons Finnick's spear was for some reason a fraction of the size as it was in all the other scenes. (just 2 examples, I could make a list of probably 50 if I took the time to type them all out).

I mean if stuff like that doesn't bother you then you'll love this movie regardless whether you've seen the book. Personally I've never read the books, I just enjoy movies like this. I rated 4/5 not because of the story but because of the inconsistency in scene details.",1394323200,,1117,4.289099526066351
6013629,5,B00FL31UF0,Enjoying this series so far.  I think this was better than the first one.  I am looking forward to the next one.,1394323200,,112,4.045454545454546

6013632,5,B00FL31UF0,I would recommend this movie. I almost thought it was better than the book. I am looking forward to number 3.,1394323200,,109,4.238095238095238

6013634,4,B00FL31UF0,"I thought it would be average for a sequel. Especially when I saw it was 2.5 hours. I was pleasantly incorrect. It wasn't GREAT, but it was pretty darn good! I didn't care for the ending but... meh. I was happy all in all.",1394323200,,222,4.068181818181818
6013635,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie was excellent.  The suspense kept you hooked and I won't ruin the ending but I will just say you must see and will enjoy.,1394323200,,132,4.076923076923077
6013636,5,B00FL31UF0,Very good sequel to the first hunger games.  There will be more to come after this one and with no fowl language I will be sure to watch them all.,1394323200,,146,3.8666666666666667
6013637,5,B00FL31UF0,The second sequel to the Hunger Games saga is good.  It follows the book fairly close.  My teenage granddaughters really enjoyed it.,1394323200,,132,4.954545454545454
6013638,4,B00FL31UF0,"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was a fantastic second installment in this series. The end leaves you wanting more, and hopefully the next movie will be just as great.

6013640,3,B00FL31UF0,"It was a bit long and the ending just plain sucked. I don't like the style of movie that wants to draw you in for a sequel - so I guess it will work, Jenni is amazing and beautiful makes it all worth it.",1394323200,,203,3.6363636363636362
6013641,4,B00FL31UF0,"I liked The Hunger Games so I rented Catching Fire thinking it would be a good movie. I was only slightly off, its a great movie. If you like the first one, this one will definitely make you a fan. Its funny because you see a lot of these young adult book series being made into movies and even television, but I've found that a lot of the time, and especially this time, these movies are filled with good drama and deep characters. I just find it a bit surprising since they are based on young adult novels, pleasantly surprising. Never underestimate a movie. You may just get really lucky and watch something really good.",1394323200,,623,4.426086956521739

6013643,4,B00FL31UF0,"I preordered this movie on the Sunday before it came out (that Friday). We aren't expected to receive this until Monday. What a disappointment the shipping was. I believe this is because I am not a Prime member. Preordered movies should be delivered by their release date and I am not far from a shipping center. My wife planned this movie night and thought that by preordering 5 days in advance it would give her one less errand to run (go buy the movie at a brick and mortar). Really ruined our plans. I don't use Amazon enough to justify prime, but I'll have to do the free trial next time we want to preorder a movie. Lame.",1394323200,,627,4.322033898305085

6013645,4,B00FL31UF0,"I am a book worm, this movie left so much out. I understand that for time purposes and what not they shorten things that aren't essential to the story...for me everything is essential.  I always try to not hold the movie to such high standards b/c none of them are ever as great.  The acting was superb, the cinematography was great...the story was just rushed.  To rate this poorly wouldn't be fair just due to my high expectations.  I am disappointed that some things were left out, for example: In the book Plutark shows Katniss a pocket watch at the end of tour party.  I felt this was VERY important to the story and it would have only taken 5 seconds to show. Bonnie and Twill? Not mentioned.  The Bread in the arena? Nope again. Also, I don't feel they portrayed the injuries as much as they should have.  Overall the movie was good.  I have read Catching Fire at least 5 times, so like I said my expectations were unbelievably high.",1394323200,8,940,4.424418604651163

6013647,2,B00FL31UF0,"I enjoyed the first film and expected more from this one.
The story was weak and poorly executed.
The abrupt ending is disgraceful.

Some of the visuals are pretty good, as well as some acting.
One good thing is that I have been forewarned about the next part of the series, and so I will save some money.",1394323200,4,305,4.258620689655173

6013650,5,B00FL31UF0,Jennifer Lawrence was the fire of this movie. I loved the action and the emotional balance. Although the movie is not precisely following the book; it is nonetheless an excellent telling of the story. You will not be disappointed when you view this film.,1394323200,,254,4.795454545454546
6013651,3,B00FL31UF0,Disappointing lead in to a 3rd movie. This story line could have had some depth about the characters from each district.,1394323200,2,120,4.761904761904762
6013652,5,B00FL31UF0,"I admit I didn't have much hope for this movie.  I've read the Hunger Games trilogy.  I liked the first book best, and the third book was pretty good...but the second book I really had to force myself to complete it.  Its one redeeming feature were the likable characters.

The movie managed to take all the major points of the second book and make a well paced movie.  There was a brief point where it felt a little long, but overall it didn't lag.  The characters were just as lovable.  Jennifer Laurence is a little less wooden in this movie, which makes her more appealing.",1394323200,,577,4.438095238095238
6013653,4,B00FL31UF0,"Although Catching Fire is well done and provides a good transition to the final installment of this series, I didn't think it captured the emotional energy of the book.

6013656,5,B00FL31UF0,"The cast, the story, the look of this film. All capture the book its based on far more than Jackson's overblown Hobbit. (I'm actually hoping that in ten years, someone will do a GOOD version of the book, say a three hour version, rather than an unneeded 9 hour one). Jennifer Lawrence is, as usual amazing and the film just grabs the viewer and flies with them. Well worth seeing and more than once.",1394323200,,399,4.405405405405405

6013697,3,B00FL31UF0,"I really enjoyed the original Hunger Games movie because it was so un-Hollywood, but this second installment is the exact opposite. Yes, it's slicker, bigger, etc, but for me that's the problem. After a good first half developing the ideas from the first movie in a darker and wider context, the second half is plain silly, just one CGI action scene after another. In the end I no longer cared for the characters, which is a shame because I think this series had more potential. No doubt my opinion will be in the minority, but 20 years from now I bet the original movie is far more valued than this one will be.",1394323200,,612,4.424778761061947

If you think, like I did, that the 1st movie was a fine but not that great of a movie and that it was lacking something, Catching Fire makes up for what was lacking, depth.

Blu Ray- Colors muted but went well with the tone of this movie.  Fine detail such as faces was flat.  Sound was good, even, not over powering on the bass.
Above average BD quality but not a reference.  Movie Very Good!!!",1394236800,,572,4.299065420560748

6013711,1,B00FL31UF0,"This film is a continuation of the semi-interesting ""Hunger Games.""  The original film was a rip of ""The Running Man"" and ""Logan's Run.""  Since the first film was so successful (although I couldn't see why), I decided to rent the sequel.  I thought, well, it's bound to be distracting at the least.  It wasn't.  It added nothing to the original film in terms of originality and even lost points because it just re-purposed a hackneyed concept.  The first half of the film is excruciating.  Nothing (I mean nothing) happens other than as a predictable set-up for the second half, which was just a less exciting recycling of the first movie.  With judicious editing, the first half of the film could have been reduced to about 12 minutes.  After the second half was completed, you are left with nothing but a teaser for a third film.  At that point I felt that this whole enterprise might have made a second-rate mini-series for TV.  The only positive thing I can say is that I think that Jennifer Lawrence has actual talent.  She under-plays her character in a professional manner, and has the look and style of an actress who needs a better forum to show off her abilities.  Otherwise, save your cash and just buy a bag of Doritos.",1394236800,2,1231,4.617511520737327

6013714,4,B00FL31UF0,"I won't go into any details of the movie itself as most people have seen it themselves. I love this movie & feel that it's a fantastic follow up to the first Hunger Games. The story is fantastic & pulls you into it leading up to the games. The picture, action & 7.1 sound are flawless. My one & only complaint is the multiple aspects ratios. I love the stunning 2.40:1 presentation & I wish that the Blu-ray offered this option to view al the way through the movie. For those of us with a 2.35:1 cinemascope screen for a home theater the switching aspect ratios are a pain in the butt. I wish that the viewer could choose to watch the entire movie in the 2.40:1 aspect ratio or the switching version. On my 80"" flat panel it makes no difference but on my 148"" 2.35:1 cinemascope screen in my theater room I hate that it switches back & forth. There are several other movies that do this & they are all hard to enjoy. Why don't the studios follow what the fans of home theater like? I'm not sure.",1394236800,,995,4.214659685863874

6013716,3,B00FL31UF0,"Okay movie.  Fun in spots.  But Part 2 was mostly uneventful and shallow.  Sure it has some great visuals and action here and there, but it severely lacked flow, cohesion, and a proper intellectual plot.  It was far too simple and so predictable.  I could guess most conversations before they talked.  No real surprises.  More of a Class B or C mindless movie, you watch it and say okay that was fun BUT where was the beef?  And the ending?  None.  You realize instantly at the end, what this little movie was really all about.  It was just a big set up for the future Part 3 that surely will come.  And it probably will be called Hunger Games Part 3, the Revolution.  I guess Part 2 was ""filler.""  At the end of Part 2 you can see the determination in Jennifer's eyes.  She's mad and not going to take it any more.  Part 3 will have her as the centerpiece and leader of the revolution.  Part 1 was okay and now Part 2 was okay as well.

Again Part 2 was fun but not deep.  Ideas not developed or connected between or within scenes.  But then again, I sometimes like brain dead movies that are fun.  Much like space invaders or pac man, just enjoy them for what little they have to offer.  As long as you don't expect much, you won't be too disappointed by Part 2.  No matter how disjointed its storyline is.  It just does not flow well.  But the monkey fight was entertaining for the short time it existed.  Along with the lightning and the acid fog etc.  Little snippets thrown in to keep you from getting too bored during the movie.  Characters were shallow and relationships too thin.  Acting was okay but nothing outstanding, mostly vanilla people going through the predictable motions to get to the end.

If anything, Part 2 was giant trailer prelude to hopefully a better future Part 3.  Hopefully with a plot and closure.",1394236800,,1829,4.38622754491018

6013720,5,B00FL31UF0,"Catching Fire was a fantastic film - a big improvement over The Hunger Games.  I can't add any more to the virtues of the film, so I'll focus on the Blu-ray features.

Don't get excited for the deleted scenes.  They last less than 5 minutes, and the longest one is a very slightly extended version of a scene in the film between Snow and Plutarch.

The Making Of feature begins with director, producers, and actors discussing the pressure to create a sequel that would be a worthy follow-up to the success of The Hunger Games.  There were interesting little tidbits, like a parking garage that was converted into the set used in the scenes where the tributes train.  Also, I knew that much of the arena filming was done in Hawaii, but I did NOT know that the Cornucopia scenes were filmed in Atlanta.

In another feature, the cast talks about their admiration for each other.  Philip Seymour Hoffman was featured, and listening to everyone talk about how happy they are that he joined the series was quite sad.  Other features focused on the weapon training for the cast, costumes and makeup, and preparations for the filming of Mockingjay.",1394236800,,1140,4.688442211055277

6013729,3,B00FL31UF0,"(Sorry I have never read the books and don't feel like looking up the spelling of their names.) Catniss and Pia are back home. They have to go on tour to all the districts to show off that they ""won"". It is hard as of course as the people in the districts have had one of their own murdered, and of course Catniss and Pia knew some of the slain. Anyway, they have to pretend that they still are in love with each other and will have to always do that. But the president is still smarting over their ability to stay alive. So he plots. He sets up the games so that the victors of each of the past games has to fight each other instead of new people being chosen. So Catniss and Pia are heading back to be contestants of the games to fight to stay alive again. But before they do and while they do people are starting to get empowered by Catniss and Pia's last win. The capitol is even deployed to crack down on it.

But what you see is not what you get. Is everyone trying to ""surpress"" the uprising/revolt? Or are they trying to stoke the flames? I won't spoil it for you. YOu'll have to see for yourself. But this movie kinda let me down. Instead of developing characters and such it was just developing the larger plot that this miniseries of movies is going to unfold. So you had to see the first to get this movie. And this movie didn't give you much except to draw you in to make you watch the next one. It reminds me of the second to the last Twilight movie. It gave you nothing new and demanded you return for the last one which barely gave you anything but an ending. Instead of people trying to make money make some entertainment. Anyway we know that the next fallen druggie Hollywoodite who had a pretty hefty part in this movie--Hoffman--won't reappear. So it will be interesting how his irresponsible behavior throws this movie a curve ball too. I mean . . . when you watch this . . and see the ending of the movie . . . you realize his death by reckless behavior left a big hole in it.",1394236800,2,1998,4.162790697674419

The first two thirds o the movie is shown in very nice widescreen blu ray, but the last third of the movie suddenly goes into fullscreen. I know that this part of the movie was shot in imax, but honestly I would just prefer widescreen because it gives the movie a cleaner look. The last third just felt sloppy. Not a big problem, and not enough to take away my five star rating but it is the only problem I had.  Best movie ever!",1394236800,,647,4.0546875
6013732,5,B00FL31UF0,"I started off by watching the original Hunger Games movie. At that time, I hadn't read the books. After watching the original film, I was anxious to see where the story would go and knew I couldn't wait for the second film to come out.

So, I began reading the leftover novels. I have long since finished both books, but I was still left anxious to see the movies. Thankfully, Catching Fire has finally come out on Blu-Ray!

Having read the book and watched the movie (both more than once), I can say that the film did a phenomenal job portraying Collins' fantastic novel. From the amazing music, to the genius acting, they nailed it.

(Semi-spoiler alert) Now, some might complain the film ends on a cliffhanger. While this is more proof as to how true to the book they were, it can also be frustrating to those who haven't read the book. Which, ironically, is exactly what can be done to solve the issue. Read the third book, no more spoilers!

6013735,5,B00FL31UF0,It's rare that I think a movie outdoes its book ( the only other case that comes to mind for me right now is The Horse Whisperer) but this one definitely does...it captures much if not all of what was really good about the book- and outdoes it in terms of retaining one's interest and empathy for the main characters. In particular the actors playing the lead males give these characters dimension that they didn't really have (for me at least- and I read the book twice) in the books,1394236800,,484,4.388888888888889

When the first Hunger Games came out, I wasn't at all familiar with the book or the story that it was based on, so I wasn't really sure what kind of movie I was going to get.  But after watching it, I was very impressed with the story that the movie told, actually interested me in reading the books.

With that being said, I have looked forward to seeing the second installment of the movie series.  This is definitely a worthy sequel to the original and in some ways is better than the first.

Although the movie focused around the games as did the first movie, that didn't hurt this sequel at all.  Catching fire manages to provide more character development and depth for both Katniss and Peeta.

Both Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson do an excellent job like in the first of bringing the characters from the book to life and In addition Woody Harrelson, Donald Sutherland and Philip Seymour Hoffman all do an excellent job in their respective roles as well.

The action is solid, the story as good as the first and the characters both old and new keep you interested throughout.  Catching Fire is definitely a worthy sequel and worth watching.",1394150400,2,1356,4.640167364016737

I've read and watched my full repertoire....pain has definitely made me a bit weepy, but this was a cunning and skillful rendering of the book. The necessary detail cuts that generally leave me grinding my teeth after movie adaptations were well chosen and beautifully filled in by a subtle, crafted performance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman and let's call it....the rest of the cast....well, I was a bit verklempt in several places. This captures the essence of the novel and strikes the perfect chord. My daughter was right when she was distraught (not the only reason) about the loss of PSH....I don't envy the person who may have to attempt to replace his performance. Make no mistake, this movie is much grittier and harsher than the first one and relievedly so....this doesn't glorify violence but it doesn't try to redeem it, disguise it or flinch from it as I felt the first film did. Folks appalled about children killing children....get over it....it's not gratuitous....it's about the nature of Tyranny, oligarchy and the corruption of absolute power......that's the ENTIRE point of the book, the film.

6013757,4,B00FL31UF0,"With a new director Francis Lawrence (I Am Legend), The Hunger Games: Catching Fire shifts its focus from the Battle Royale-like killing game to the tributes, or the participants of the game, themselves.

President Snow (Donald Sutherland) decides to hold the 75th Hunger Games, or the third Quarter Quell, and this time tributes are to be chosen from the existing winners of the game, regardless of age. President of the oppressive government knows what he is doing, and hires a new game master (Philip Seymour Hoffman). Now the symbol of peoples power, Katniss knows the game is no longer just about her and Peetas survival.

The first sequel (two more are in production) spends more time on describing the complicated relationships between the three characters Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence), Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) and Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth), as well as the psychological changes that Katniss as a reluctant heroine undergoes. That means that those who are looking for action may not like the way the story unfolds, which is pretty slow in the first sixty minutes. The pre-game section takes time, perhaps more than necessary.

One of the best things of the first sequel (two more are in production) is the new characters, especially the tributes played by Jena Malone, Amanda Plummer and Jeffrey Wright. Their unpredictable personalities are more interesting than the game itself.

As I said, there would be two more sequels coming in 2014 and 2015 respectively. Though there are some room for improvement, like its slow pace and some ineffective visual effects, the first sequel has started pretty good.",1393977600,,1633,5.174242424242424

6013762,4,B00FL31UF0,"I am not a huge fan of the first installment of the franchise. The camera, environment, drama, characters. It was a whole big mess and the biggest problem was not setting up the big plot points that were going to appear in this movie and in the next two. But Catching Fire fixes all of those problems and mainly thanks to the new director in the helm.
The cast does such a GREAT job this time around, it's not even funny. The addition of new supporting characters complemented the story nicely. They weren't there just to be there, they were present for a reason, they had meaning. The acting in this is superb. Everybody adds emotion to their role and much needed it was. Believe it or not, Peeta was the only character worth liking in the first one because he was the only one with depth. But in this film, Katniss, Heymitch, the supporting cast and the other competitors, Primrose and Katniss' mother. Even Effie gets to have some type of emotion to the circumstances. The only downfall here is Gale which like in the first one, they don't do anything or give him anything to do in this one and as a result, his character feels flat.

The camera isn't in close up mode all the time which feels like a relief from the first one. Another thing is how the environment looked when in the Hunger Games and it looks incredible. These movies were supposed to be dark because they touch upon the theme of rebellion and survival and that is exactly what the director incorporated into this film. And for thank God that they finally showed something relative to mining in District 12. If you're a fan of the first one, buy this and watch it, it improves on so many levels. If you weren't a fan of the first movie, buy this and watch it, it improves on so many levels.",1393459200,12,1760,4.398773006134969

I could not believe the twist at the end.  No I did not read the books, my son did, so I was surprised and will be until the last.

Catching Fire, yes buy it, get it and enjoy it.  Just make sure you understand it's only the 2nd installment of 4 and it's setting up for the others as well as laying out this story.

The sequel on the other hand is incredibly weak and the plot twists are pathetic. I made it to the end...barely, and only because it became laughable after a while. The main characters have no integrity or character, and after watching their endless depressed banter and their brain dead passiveness, you start hoping they will actually die.  In fact after a while you sort of want every single person in the entire movie to die.  If only a giant comet would have hit the earth half way through it!

The story-line of the sequel is incredibly lame and so unrealistic one becomes a bit disgusted by it...it feels a bit insulting in fact.  It's even ridiculous for the average 10 year old.  The actions of the tributes on the island are so absurd one can only laugh.  If I could give this movie zero stars I would because there is nothing enjoyable about it whatsoever.",1391990400,9,1019,4.571428571428571
6013774,5,B00FL31UF0,"(Heads up!  Most of this is spoiler material.)
Dude, good movie!  This film was so good, I went home and read the book again.  Five stars!  Better than the first!  Why?  Because its time to end the killing of children.  The districts are ready.  The audience is ready.  The spark of revolution is catching fire.  This is why we kept reading, why we bought tickets to the film.  Not because its cool, but because killing children is wrong and we need to see this through.

Variations from the book:
With this film?  Dude, who cares.  I didn't feel it lacked anything.

Granted, the film doesnt play up the baby lie as much as the book does.  But the film works better with a one shot lie.  After all, we need our heroes to be truth tellers and of incorruptible hearts.  Thats why Peeta and Katniss survived The Games.  The capitol believed they were in love.  Dont deceive them now.

And yet its clear that Katniss doesnt love Peeta.  Or does she?  Does her play act turn real?

My favorite addition to the story is the cut-away scene to President Snows granddaughter watching The Games.  Peeta has just been brought back to life, and Katnisss embrace and hysterics illicit this response: When I grow up, I want to love someone that much.

The revolution isn't the only thing catching flame.

Themes:
Remember who the enemy is.  Great tip to let us know where we are on Joseph Campbells Heros Journey.  Katniss has crossed The First Threshold and is headed into The Abyss.  She will become disoriented.

In the first film, Katniss answers The Call (the reaping), meets her Mentor (Haymitch), and goes through her first set of Trials (The Games).  Peeta and Cina become her allies, and Katniss unknowingly becomes the symbol of the revolution.  She has won The Games, crossed The First Threshold, and obtained a new identity.

In this second film, Katniss learns there is no going back.  She meets her Shadow Self (President Snow), and faces Ordeal and Dismemberment both in the physical sense and in her love split between Gale and Peeta.  The Boon she unwittingly steals from the arena is herself, the symbol, and thus survival, of the revolution.

The final film, Mockingjay, will have a lot of ground to cover.  Its taken two films to get to the bottom of the circle.  And while its true that most hero stories follow this path, it is difficult to accomplish a journey of this magnitude in a satisfying way.  Lets hope they get it right.

What I would change:
Can we please get some Katniss inner dialogue?  If shes going to snap (which she should), it would be great to see some of that before the third film.  Oops.  Too late.  Maybe we can open the film with her a bit more crazed than we seen so far.

Will I let my kids see it?
More likely than the first, yes.  Any time soon, no.
I don't want my kids buying the idea that teenagers can lie down in bed together and nothings going to happen.  Ha ha.  Out of all the things that people could start poking at, looking for plot flaws, thats the biggest.",1391904000,23,3007,4.489795918367347

6013777,5,B00FL31UF0,"Warning: Review contains spoilers.
When a trilogy like The Hunger Games comes along, you cant help but have your inner adolescent girl come out. The mere existence of a girl-empowered film is enough to capture the attention of any audience base. With a movie as successful as the first film in the trilogy, The Hunger Games, the second film is almost guaranteed to match, if not exceed, the success of the first.
Directed by Francis Lawrence, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire tells the story of what happens after Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark win the 74th Hunger Games. Katniss and Peeta must go on the Victors Tour wherein they visit all of the districts. President Snow pays Katniss a visit before embarking on the tour when he tells her that with both her and Peeta winning the Games, it has sparked an uprising across the districts. Unfortunately, Katniss and Peeta are once again selected to compete in the Quarter Quell where they have to go back to the one place they dread the mostthe arena.
A stimulatingly atypical heroine, Katniss is the embodiment of the series making it more popular and appealing than most other action movies. Like a majority of middle sections of book and movie series, Catching Fire expands on the first part of the series and then features a two and a half hour long teaser of what is going to happen next.
Jennifer Lawrence plays the role of Katniss who has been dubbed as The Girl on Fire in the last Hunger Games. Katniss is the spark of the revolution that is to ignite against the vicious ruling class of Panem. Her outfits are designed to ignite. In my opinion, they could not have cast a better actress to play Katniss. Lawrence effectively embodies the character that is looked up to, praised by all, and who is supposed to lead the twelve districts through this revolution. Whats even better is the fact that this character is a girl. Its about time a film series comes out featuring an empowered heroine that does not revolve around potential suitors with supernatural powers. Its enough to keep the audience smiling.
Director Francis Lawrence is confident enough to not follow his predecessor Gary Ross and go too heavy on the hand-held camera work throughout the film. With the work of screenwriters Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt, Catching Fire moves along with the perfect balance of action and dialogue keeping the audience engaged throughout.
What keeps the books and the films so addicting is the way they define and portray the anxieties and pop-culture obsessions that control our everyday lives. The film portrays anger with politicians, obsession with celebrities, outbreaks of bullying, a disgruntled lower class, fascination with reality shows, and violent crimes that litter TV news coverage. Many criticize that Catching Fire resembles too much of TV shows like Survivor and Lost. However, Catching Fire stands out in a way that sets it apart from all the others by not falling victim to the originality of Hollywood film scripts. Its not a predictable movieunless youve read the books. There are surprises and curveballs around every corner waiting for the audience to watch and enjoy.
To top it all off, Catching Fire features a brewing rebellion of which Katniss is the symbol of hope. Her nickname, Mockingjay, came to be as mockingjay birds are a sign of rebellion. In Catching Fire, rebelling people will bake the bird symbol into breads, crackers, and other objects that can easily be transported or hidden quickly. The mockingay becomes a sign of fierce resistance, a sign of uprising, and ultimately a sign of hope.",1391299200,7,3590,4.896551724137931

6013779,3,B00FL31UF0,"I haven't read the books, but honestly it shouldn't be needed to judge a movie.
I absolutely loved the first movie. It had atmosphere, reason and dynamics
I do realize that the second movie ends at a cliffhanger which supposed to be continue in part 3 and 4, but still the magic of the first movie wasn't quite there. The first part of the movie (pre-game) was too long, and a bit boring - I do give them credit for showing main characters ""trip"" and its purpose, etc, but it felt a bit too long, specially considering the second half of the movie.
Now the second half of the movie is where it actually went worse. The action was ... lost. There was no tension of the first movie. No crazy drive to run and hide and just try to survive the madness that the games are (as it was shown in first movie) - the game turn from the blood fest it should have been, in mostly running from artificial hazards, which while powerful, were not very intelligent. Also main character getting so many allies willing to protect her and die for her, made everything seem ""easy"". How many other players actually threatened her directly? I think it was just 2 or 3. It no longer felt like hopeless survival race that it was in the first movie. I do understand that this group of allies protecting her was all part of a PLAN, but from action genre stand point it was a little dull.

I am still looking forward to next movie, but unless things improve a lot, I won't be getting this one of DVD like I immediately did with the first one.",1391212800,4,1514,4.293706293706293

I found the first one kind of disappointing since I like movies to follow closely to the book. This sequel blew the first one out of the water! If you watch a movie for the story line or for the book then you'll enjoy this one. If your just looking to watch an all action movie then go watch an all action movie! This film lets you get to know the characters, what their going through and it follows the book really well. It was pretty funny too. The ending leaves it leading into the next movie.

6013783,3,B00FL31UF0,"Somehow even darker and more brooding than the original, which was no sunshiny walk in the park itself. Following the financial success of the first film, a lot of rough edges and awkward missteps have been ironed out in time for the next act. Most notably improved is the effects work, which had seemed just a bit too much like a video game cutscene. The new arena is convincing and beautiful, the glitz and glamor of The Capitol has been amplified appropriately, and the intricacies of the cast's showy wardrobe (which memorably underwhelmed in the first film) are far better realized. The plot is efficient, if telegraphed and incomplete: its sudden, jolting cliffhanger (which occurs, literally, right in the middle of a sentence) left me flat, even if it is laid out in precisely the same way in the source material. Much of the primary cast spends the duration wrapped up in their own sorrow, quietly brooding over their predicament while the roles of their flashier, more PR-friendly foils have been trimmed down to mere cameos. Such concessions are understandable, as the film does run quite long as it is, but the accompanying shift in tone makes this a very redundant, single-colored ride. An improvement over the first film in many ways, but the first act really drags its feet and there's a puzzling lack of enthusiasm, energy or suspense to it all.",1390780800,6,1361,4.84549356223176

Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) were the champions of the Hunger Games, and President Snow (Donald Sutherland - a long way from Mash) orders them to go on a Victory Tour throughout the Districts.  Unfortunately for Katniss, her defiance for some of Part 1's rules has begun to cause rebellion in the Districts.  Katniss' natural honesty and desire to do what's right only seems to fuel the rebellion more during the tour.  Fearing a revolution, Snow wants her dead!  A decision to reinstiute the ""Quarter Quell"" brings together Katniss, Peeta, and all past champions in a fight-to-the-death replay of the Hunger Games.  Woody Harrelson returns as Haymitch, who continues to act as a mentor for Katniss and Peeta.  Philip Seymour is Gamemaker Plutarch (since the last Gamemaker met his demise.

of as messages between the characters. There is one scene where the message
is so big, I didn't realize what it was until waaay after I saw the movie.
When I finally understood that message, I realized just how big it was.
We talk about pushing someone's buttons, but this message jumps up and down
on the buttons. It isn't malicious, its trying to light someone up.
  And it does.
This is probably the best scene of the movie for me.

After I got that, I began to see there are messages everywhere in this movie.
All the characters, all the citizens, know something is beginning. They can
feel their world fracturing under their feet. And they need someone to talk
with, but in their world, talking can get them killed. So the messages are
oblique, short. A gesture. A few words. Or a picture. Drawn by someone who
cares about what you care about.

Like the first movie, Catching Fire seems very well made to me. Not just
the acting and directing, but the entire movie. Its like all the people
who helped make this, enjoyed their work, both creatively and professionally.
From a corporate standpoint, its like the executives had a lot of confidence
in the creative people, just let them create, knowing the audience would come.

The actors, the director, and the writers all bring the characters to life.
I feel like I'm getting to know these characters, and there will always be
something new to learn. Jennifer Lawrence is the leading edge of a group
of people who are just very, very good at what they do. Gifted, and generous.

About the new characters in the film, I just want to say they work very well.
They are all very different, and they all create a vivid contrast for the
characters we already know. The characters are interesting because the whole
mindset of this story says each person is more than what they seem. Don't
assume anything, don't generalize, and don't let any of them get behind your
back.

I saw Catching Fire a day after seeing Gravity, and the contrast in running
time was striking. Gravity has a flow that moves swiftly, its a movie where
time is an accomplice of death. Catching Fire seemed the exact opposite,
time brings all the complexity of life in a dangerous world. The story draws
you in, and you live time as the characters experience it. I noticed this
after the first 90 minutes. It was only sitting in one position too long that
reminded me I was watching a movie. I looked back up at the movie and it hit
me, wow, this story just runs away with you.",1390262400,2,2658,4.5
6013791,5,B00FL31UF0,"However, considering that the studio is using the film to push and build awareness for its other dystopian young adult film series Divergent, it's seems likely that The Hunger Games: Catching Fire will be released shortly before Divergent drops on March 21, 2014.",1390262400,2,263,5.1395348837209305

6013793,4,B00FL31UF0,"It was an interesting DVD. The Acting was OK.  However, I would say that it's more of a repeat of past movies/videos such as ""Spartacus"", ""Gladiator"" and such. I also noted that the Director was able to make use of the fact that ""Power Corrupts Absolutely"" and that the Characters were merely pawns in the hands of the State. This should serve as a warning to us that there is always a temptation for elected officials to twist the National Constitution to satisfy their ends and retain power. In this manner, the mass population merely becomes like the serfs who serve the Aristocracy as in examples of early World History. These Serfs are required to obey the Police and Leadership. I think the ""Hunger Games"" was meant to distract the mass groups of people from their everyday required duties as well as the harshness of their lives. Thanks for your attention.",1390003200,,863,4.71523178807947
6013794,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie followed the book word for word.  With it's spectacular fighting scenes to its romantic scenes, it showed the viewers what they came to see. Although, many did not like this movie...don't be tricked. Yes, there is blood shown, but if you read the book, you realize that's how it's supposed to be, but better and not as violent and graphic!( mainly because they had to make the movie PG-13 not R).  If you want to understand all of your questions, READ THE BOOKS! It will all make sense if you just take a little bit of time and read 1,2,and 3. Some people complain about the ending... Well, if you want to know what happens next, read THE MOCKINGJAY! It will explain it all there.
I loved this movie because they turned a great book, into a great movie. That's what I want to see being a true hungergames fan!",1390003200,,820,4.3881578947368425
6013795,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie was excellent!  I loved the first Hunger Games book, but I found the movie to be just okay.  I had high hopes for Catching Fire because it changed directors and because it's my favorite book in the series.  I had high expectations and boy, did this movie meet them!

One thing worth mentioning why Catching Fire was so good is the fact that it get's rid of all the flaws I had with the first movie.  I had a huge problem with the shaky cam.  I know Gary Ross - the director of the first movie -  wanted to get a realistic feel of District 12 and the  Games, but I thought he went a little too overboard.  Catching Fire gets rid of the shaky cam entirely.  There's a little bit during the action sequences, but it was a huge improvement compared the first movie.

Another thing worth mentioning is the relationship between Katniss and Peeta felt a more natural.  The ""love triangle"" it tried to set up in the first movie felt forced and in this one, I actually cared more about Peeta and Katniss' relationship.

And I think that's the best part of the movie.  It's filled with emotion.  I felt more connected to the characters and I found myself caring more about what's going to happen.

I also have to make note about Jennifer Lawrence's performance.  There are surprisingly a lot of comedic moments in the film and some of her facial expressions are down right hilarious!

I definitely recommend this movie if you haven't seen it already.  I will definitely be picking this up.",1389916800,16,1490,4.451851851851852
6013796,5,B00FL31UF0,"I have still been reading a lot of negative and derogatory comments about the Hunger Games books and movies, calling them ""kiddie"" and comparing them to the Twilight series. Of course, these are people whom have never read or watched Twilight, or The Hunger Games series either. But they make the comparison anyway, based on....well, I'm not sure what? Because the lead character is a female? I guess. The books are good. Hunger Games (film) was great. And Catching Fire (the film) was SUPERB! Jennifer Lawrence is perfect as Katniss; a strong, imperfect heroine. And the rest of the cast is not far behind her. Even if you don't read the books, watch the movies. You won't regret it. I can't wait for Catching Fire to be released.",1389830400,2,731,4.71875

6013799,5,B00FL31UF0,"What a prophetic title Catching Fire is for the sequel to 2012's The Hunger Games the first film based on the series of novels by author Suzanne Collins. After the surprise huge success of the nearly seven hundred million dollar worldwide box office gross of The Hunger Games Collin's dystopia sci-fi series truly caught fire launching the popularity of the novels, films, and Jennifer Lawrence to new heights never thought possible. The fire ignited by The Hunger Games continues in Catching Fire as the sequel is a major step up from its predecessor in every way.

When we last saw Katniss Everdeen and Peeta Mellark had just finished winning or better yet surviving the 74th Hunger Games, and were returning home to District 12. Katniss revealed to Peeta that everything in the games was an act, and President Snow was not happy with the results of the Games which led to an unhappy end for head game maker Seneca Crane, and now months on the eve of the Victory Tour an annual event after the Hunger Games where the Victors tour the other districts on the way to the capital Katniss and Peeta have an icy relationship, and both suffer from PTSD. Both of their lives have gone back to relative normality until just hours before the Victory Tour President Snow pays Katniss a visit explaining how things are going to be if Katniss wants Gale, and her family to continue to breath. Katniss and Peeta are forced to act like a happy couple to help appease the unhappy citizens of the other districts only to have their stiff and unconvinced act antagonize the people for leading Snow to make changes to the Third Quarter Quell and 75th Hunger Games as he decides to have the tributes chosen from the exciting victors of each district as he hopes to rid himself of Katniss, and the other tributes who Snow views as instigators who believe they are above the law, and can get away with anything.

It's rare for film adaptions to surpass its source material with Out of Sight, Blade Runner, and The Silence of the Lambs such a few that were better than the source material yet The Hunger Games series has done it twice with the first film, and now with Catching Fire. Directed Francis Lawrence, and screen writers Simon Beaufoy and Michael Arndt had some tough decisions adapting Catching Fire. They had to both make fans of the novel happy as well as the ordinary people whose only knowledge of the novel series is what they learned from the first film, and as a fan of Catching Fire I believe they did that. Beaufoy and Arndt streamlined Catching Fire omitting certain elements and characters from the novel. They didn't do a perfect job as I felt they should have at least like in the first films included scenes of Peeta's family. They didn't have to have lines in the film, but I felt they should have been there or more scenes with Haymitch who won the second Quarter Quell, and shows Peeta and Katniss his time in the games, but those are small complaints for me as the two screen writers added all the important themes in the film from class warfare to the effects of war and violence has on people and an society to simple fear, and self-preservation over revolution and change, and scenes like Gales whipping, the scene in district 11, the games, and the beautiful moment on the beach between Katniss and Peeta. The only other real complaint I would have would be the scenes with Snow and his daughter. I know the screen writers wanted to show the impact Katniss was having in the capital and Snow's daughter, but the scenes weren't necessary and took away from the film. Outside of that Beaufoy and Arndt did a wonderful job adapting the novel to film, and getting me to love the film more than I do the novel.

While I loved first Hunger Game film it did have its problems in particular in the acting department. Perhaps it was the lack of screen time or just plain lackluster acting, but Liam Hemsworth was forgettable as Gale Hawthorne, Josh Hutcherson did a good job as Peeta, but seemed stiff and unemotional compared to Jennifer Lawrence, and outside of Rue and Cato the tributes weren't that well casted or acted. Catching Fire has some small issues with acting, and in particular with Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee. The award winning actor just seemed disinterested in most of his scenes. Hopefully that will change in the two upcoming Mockingjay films. Lenny Kravitz as Cinna was also a minor hindrance as he spoke with no emotion and in a robotic tone, and thankfully he won't be around in the sequels.

Besides those two the acting was again a major step up from the first film. Liam Hemsworth came into his own has Gale who hates the capitol, and after hearing about uprising in other districts wants to rebel as well. Sam Claflin and Jena Malone were perfectly casted as Finnick Odair and Johanna Mason. The two actors in their roles just capture the essence of their characters perfectly and draw the cameras to them. Elizabeth Banks gives such a great performance as Effie Trinket it's hard to separate the two, and in Catching Fire, Elizabeth Banks shows that Effie is more than just a vain capital born citizen. Donald Sutherland does another solid acting performance as President Snow, and in particular his short scene with Lawrence. The young Hutcherson comes into his own in Catching Fire showing both his and Peeta's growth as an actor and character in particular with his scenes and chemistry with Katniss/Lawrence. Catching Fire certainly does have some great acting, but with that said Catching Fire and The Hunger Game films are made boom or bust by its star Jennifer Lawrence who since her breakout performance in first Hunger Games, and her Oscar winning performance in Silver Linings Playbook has become America's sweetheart. Lawrence is gorgeous, funny, smart, humble, and a tremendously talented actress who's willing to make fun of herself, and her star will continue to rise after her performance in Catching Fire. Lawrence is so effortless in her acting that it's as if the character and actress are one and the same. Jennifer Lawrence perfectly displays the wide ranging emotions of Katniss from her PTSD nightmares to hatred for Snow and the capitol, and growing love for Peeta. Lawrence drives the Hunger Games and continues to in Catching Fire displaying why she is an Oscar winning actress, and the one of if not the best actress of this current generation.

With Gary Ross out as director, and Francis Lawrence brought in the director for Catching Fire, and the two Mockingjay films changes in style were made to Catching Fire that was added by estimated one hundred and thirty million dollar budget. Out was the shaking camera style that many critics hated in the first film as Francis Lawrence brought a more visual, and darker element to Catching Fire that benefited the film. Lawrence did a superb job in bringing Catching Fire to life, and I look forward to his vision of the two Mockingjay films. I have been purposely vague about the action scenes and the games themselves, as I don't want to give anything away or ruin it for those who haven't read the novels, but the action is masterfully done, and directed, and no the action is not just a retread of the action of the first film.

I know some, and in particular men will refuse to see Catching Fire, and The Hunger Games films because of the Young Adult label is cursed to be attached to the dreaded Twilight books and films as well as crappy romance, and screaming girls or some ill-conceived notion that The Hunger Games is a rip off of the overrated Battle Royal manga series that was in itself heavily influence by Lord of the Flies, but they'd be missing out on a truly special film, and films that is far more than the labels given to it. Yes The Hunger Games novels are under the YA label, but the Y has really nothing to do with the novels. There are no vampires that sparkle, crappy magic elements or a female lead that has no personality or goals outside of the men, and in most cases the two men in her live. The Hunger Games novels strived to be more than that, and are as there is actually real depth, and themes in the story. Yes there is romance, and a sort of love triangle in the novels, but the romance is extremely well done, and isn't the predominate factor in the series. The lead character Katniss is an actual character with feelings, emotions, and a strength that doesn't make her reliant on a man to protect her or hold her up. The Hunger Games, and author Suzanne Collins wanted instead of playing it safe to instead challenge the young reader and audience members to think about the themes in the novels and the world as a whole.

It would be a shame for people to let preconceived notions keep them from missing out on The Hunger Games, and Catching fire as Catching Fire is a great film one of the best of the year as well as a one of the best sequels in years with a brilliant adapted screenplay, great directing, with a well casted cast that did a splendid job in their roles, great action, cinematography, and of course the great Jennifer Lawrence giving another marvelous performance as Katniss. Catching Fire is a brilliant film that shouldn't be missed.",1389052800,10,9212,4.647852760736196
6013800,5,B00FL31UF0,"I saw this opening night and enjoyed it much more than the first one. We get to see more of the actual games and what other winners of the games are like. The story is darker and more intense than the first film and some scenes will show that if anything the peacekeepers are not so peaceful.

I can't wait for this film to come out on BluRay, so I can add it to my collection. I also understand the reason why they are doing two movies out of Mocking Jay, but I am peeved too cause I know it will be similar to ho Deathly Hallows Part 1&2 were. Part One will have some action in the slow plot, while Part 2 will have action throughout the movie making it much more thrilling than part one.

Any one who has read the books will enjoy the film and I'll end my review by saying that I enjoyed so much I saw the movie twice in theaters.",1388793600,,833,3.9820359281437128

I know I should of watched the first one first but I never really even planned on going to this movie just for the simple fact that my ignorance prevented me from even watching the first movie at the moment, but that was a huge mistake. I came out of the movie theater wanting more. I haven't had such feeling since The Dark Knight and Spider-man 2, but this movie just really impressed me. Before any one asks, no, I have not yet read the book this is actually the reason I'm even reading the first one! So of course coming out of the movie theater wanting more I only had two choices... Read the books, or watch the first movie. I went with my first choice since I'm not much of a reader but, again, when I finished the first movie I loved it. I felt overly dumb about my decisions in the past. ""Why have I been missing out on this for so long?"" I felt really overwhelmed with sadness having missing out for so long that I decide to pick up the book. I am currently almost done with the first book in the series and I'm looking forward to reading ""Catching Fire"" and also "" Mockingjay"" So if I haven't really read the second book yet so my review is more towards those people that are in the same position as me. Please watch this movie if you haven't already. Its an emotional ride filled with action and romance. The movie as  whole is amazing.

The narrative focuses on previous victory failing to provide true comfort for Peeta and Katniss from totalitarian rule, and how their lives still contain misery.

President Snow manipulates the conditions of immunity for past victors and they are forced to compete in a champion edition Hunger Games. The fight to survive presents numerous anxious scenes, but the Capitol underestimates the danger of mixing so many clever and cunning winners.

The viewer is left salivating knowing there is more to come, and not knowing who will survive the next stage.

6013807,4,B00FL31UF0,"The fact that the Hunger Games stories are not crushed by their own weight is mystifying, and an achievement.
It seems crazy that a film whose ideology is as savagely brutal as the fictional Games would become such a hit. Despite all its violent connotations and tyrannical regimes, the film comes off as the years pinnacle of entertainment. Maybe the allure lies in ourselves? We project ourselves on screen. We are Katniss fighting back against the oppressors. The films core audience is essentially the same demographic that would be sacrificed if such games were ever to become a reality, so maybe everyone is really just preparing for the future? When the Games start, well know what to expect.

According to IMDB, Post-apocalyptic thrillers are not particularly big money makers; The Hunger Games franchise being the only series that nearly approaches real commercial heavy weights. The first two Hunger Games installments together hold the top grossing spots in the genre, but even then, they don't come near grossing anything like the top 50 overall films. Avatar and Titanic are the top two. Both have over two billion worldwide gross. Still, Hunger Games has a hard-core devoted fan base that rivals even Twilight.

At the Los Angeles premiere of The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, young fans camped out for three days just to be front and center on the red carpet, catching glimpses of the films stars.

The best scenes of the film visually were the ones shot in the districts. The New Yorker review describes these scenes like Eastern-bloc depressiondrained of vitality, but Katniss is exactly the opposite. As a hero she is so strong that alleviates the vitality drainage. Once we leave the districts, the filmmakers deflect the intensity of the subject matter using Katniss as a distraction. Katniss keeps the film from being engulfed into an R-rated abyss. I love R-rated abysses, but they don't draw fans like Jennifer Lawrences strong performances in these PG-13 flicks.

There were some weaknesses. The coincidence that Katniss and Peeta would be drawn back into the turmoil was too much, an obvious excuse just to get Katniss back in the ring. How is that we didn't hear of these conflicts in the past film? Surely Katniss and Peeta would have the known the traditions of the world they live in.

Also, why are all the people in the capital dressed so outlandishly? How do they assemble for all public events in perfect symmetry? Why is the Presidents only concern with the games? Doesnt he have other duties?

What the story lacks in depth, and it certainly does lack, it makes up for in action-packed, well-shot scenes. Despite an appearance by Phillip Seymour Hoffman as the gamemaker, the curves thrown at the participants in this rendition of the Games weren't as exciting as the first film.

The most annoying thing in the film was Peeta Malark. He is a weakling and not an interesting character. On the battlefield he hardly contributes. He seems to function only as a male counterpart to Katniss in the political spectrum as Katniss ends up fighting battles for two in the forest.

Overall The Hunger Games: Catching Fire was worth the price of admission, and at 2 hours 26 minutes, it flies by quick.

6013811,5,B00FL31UF0,"Four years ago, I was having a conversation with some of my high school students regarding what books they like to read.  One fairly astute young man, whom I held in high regard, told me he was reading a book called The Hunger Games.  He said it was about a supposed utopian North American society that holds annual organized battles to the death to maintain order throughout the numerous districts.  It sounded interesting, but I was not that impressed as my critical mind, still reeling from the absurdity that was (and still is) the Twilight saga, began its prejudicial routine of condemning most young-adult literature as being dumbed down versions of classics in order to make cash grabs at an increasingly illiterate reader-population.  However, this one particular students recommendation obliged me to forgo my rant about Brave New World, The Giver, 1984, and the host of other Big Brother is watching you examples and give this one a try.  Now, as the adaptation of the book series second novel comes to the big screen, I confess myself as a fan awaiting the return, with millions of others, of Katniss Everdean to the big screen.

2012s The Hunger Games was a tremendous hit automatically green lighting the entire film franchise and splitting its final entry, Mockingjay, into two separate films.  This years film, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire (or Hunger Games: Fire by some people  you know who you are) is based on perhaps the best book of the trilogy and finds our heroine, Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) back home in District 12 awaiting the annual victory tour that follows the 74th Hunger Games and precedes the 75th.  President Snow (Donald Sutherland) remains none too pleased as Katniss and Peetas (Josh Hutcherson) risky move in the previous games showed an unexpected weakness in his control and has sparked a sort of uprising in some of the poorer districts.  The 75th Hunger Games offers Snow an opportunity, as every 25 years marks a quarter-quell, a special competition that gives Snow and his new Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) a chance to even the score.

Much of what makes The Hunger Games: Catching Fire work comes from the source material.  This entry in the series has many more tricks up its sleeve than the previous film.  That being said, the trio of screen writers (including author Suzanne Collins herself) and new director, Francis Lawrence have noticeably shifted the films focus away from the characters and more to the atmosphere, themes, and events set in action from the first film.  In fact, the writing is bit edgier leading to some extra spirited dialogue especially from Peeta and Heavensbee.  Accordingly, this film has a different feel and agenda, which keeps the series fresh, but also may disquiet fans who want more Katniss.  That is not to say, Ms. Everdeen is not the films shining star, she is, and her love triangle between Gale (Liam Hemsworth) and Peeta continues to be provocative rather than stale and arbitrary.  Lawrence continues down her path to being the most beloved starlet of her generation by authentically representing Katnisss struggle between newfound fame and inherent defiance.  Furthermore, she is supported by a very recognizable A-List cast.  However, saying much more about the cast or plot would ruin some of the films best surprises.

One surprise worth ruining is Jena Malones role in the film.  It should come as no surprise that there is another reeping, and there is another host of tributes.  Malone plays the highly anticipated Johanna Mason from District 7, and she steals every scene shes a part of  possibly making her the best new element of the film.

Altogether, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a fine adaptation of Collinss novel, and it is a highly entertaining film as well, ascetically edging out its predecessor.  The films nearly doubled budget from the original is obvious  the costumes pop, the effects are much better, the acting continues to be strong, and the ambitiousness of the film is far more evident.  A-

The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is rated PG-13 and has a running time of 2 hours and 26 minutes.  It is a superior follow up to The Hunger Games and a phenomenal set-up to the series two-part conclusion.",1387756800,16,4251,4.931179775280899
6013812,5,B00FL31UF0,"Seldom have I watched a movie based on a book that so accurately translates what was on the printed page.  At several points I thought I must have seen the movie before because the image was so familiar but later realized that the movie just got it so right that I only imagined it.

It's also worth remembering that the movie is a children's movie based on a children's book and despite the fact that it deals with some fairly violent subject matter, it does it in a very child-friendly way.  Adults who are accustomed to the usual gore Hollywood likes to spew out will notice a much tamer take on the subject.

Additionally, I've read the books but I can't imagine this movie would suffer terribly for those who hadn't.  The whole thing is fairly straightforward with no great complexity so it would be difficult to get lost even without previous experience in the texts.

Lastly, the thing that makes me like this series most is its strong underlying social commentary on the plutocracy in which we live in this country.  For kids reading the book today, they're probably not seeing the parallels but once they get older it's just possible they'll see echoes of this in their own government and the social stratification that we live with every day.",1387670400,169,1252,4.638009049773756

Gets me thinking that they picked that date for a reason.
Anyways.....
This movie is awesome!!!!!!
When I see the run time of a movie being over 2 hrs., I tend to cringe. Usually it's a story that will just drag on. But not this one. The time flew as I was increasingly on the edge of my seat and plain exhausted by the end. Wow! Such an amazing movie! No need for me to go over the story line as others have gone into great detail already.
This is a must-see movie. There are loads of details that I'm sure that I missed so I will be ordering the Blu-ray right away. It is a marked improvement of the first which was also a good movie, but was more focused on the young adult crowd. This world and story has been expanded and opened up a lot of possibilities for the upcoming adventures.
For me, this one was close to the same kind of experience I had with watching the original Star Wars movie in the theater.  I never thought that I would see another movie like that again.
Some notes that I should add:
If you haven't seen the first, you really need to see it before seeing this movie. You'll miss out on the underlying currents of the story and relationships.
This is the 2nd movie of a trilogy. Like many 2nd movies, the ending leaves you hanging and there isn't much closure. You get at the end of the 3rd story.
Reading the book, like other movies from books, will leave you with mixed feelings. Movies just can't capture the whole book experience.",1387497600,2,1562,4.224080267558528
6013815,4,B00FL31UF0,"I liked the first movie the Hunger Games and liked similar type movies better so had mixed feeling about seeing the sequel.

I loved Joss Whedon's Cabin in the Woods out at the same time. A group of young people in a remote cabin on a weekend are unaware that they are on a reality show and are slowly being killed off in creative and horrifying ways for ratings. The theme is a little similar, and it's a brilliant movie inspired by Sam Raimi's horror classic The Evil Dead.

Hunger Games put me in mind of Oliver Stone's movie Natural Born Killers, a keen satire on consumerism and how death somehow becomes entertainment, and villains become icons, a great movie which coincidentally stars Woody Harrelson.

Upon the good word of friends and good reviews I decided to go see Catching Fire, and loved it more than the original and I will definitely go see the next one.

For one thing, the sequel moves from being a simple action movie, to developing the characters and giving them soul. Katniss is told she will never have to fight again, yet despite the ratings success of the Hunger Games throughout the districts natives are getting restless, and now surviving tributes admired by the public for their fighting skills are viewed by President Snow as a threat which does not bode well for our heroine.  The promoters have to find ways of getting higher ratings while keeping the restive natives from rebelling.

As our tributes become heroes they also become icons the people can rally around, yet they are paraded to maintain the status quo. How does a dictator President Snow maintain control, when our heroes are perceived as threats.

I loved how this sequel blossomed from a routine adventure movie into more three dimensional characters. I found this added to my entertainment experience.  For one thing there is a deeper relationship between Katniss and Peeta and other characters.

We have the romantic triangle with Katniss' two potential suitors, Peeta with whom she agrees to maintain the pretense of love for the cameras, and the Liam Hemsworth character with whom she seems close but can it go the distance.  Can adventure and excitement, and life and death situations ignite the real thing?  Will feigned love blossom into the real thing with her renewed proximity to Peeta, and what new adventures are in store?

I am very delighted with how the story developed, managing to surprise me with its twists and turns departing considerably from my modest expectations in engaging ways.

I admired what J Law brings to the part of Katniss.  It's hard to imagine anyone doing a better job.

As she is paraded in a chariot I  could as easily imagine her playing an iconic role like Cleopatra or Helen of Troy, she has that kind of presence.  She adds a noticeable dimension to this movie, elevating it beyond what it would otherwise be.

But not all credit belongs to the actress. Simon Beaufoy creates an excellent screenplay, having previously won the Academy Award for Best Adapted screenplay for Slumdog Millionaire in 2009. Francis Lawrence has previously directed other excellent movies such as I am Legend and Water for Elephants. Both deserve kudos for what they have done here.

I think most people will love it, and probably more than the first movie, because in my opinion at least it is considerably better, and I hope this was helpful.  I have high hopes that the third one will be even better.",1387324800,2,3420,4.784013605442177
6013816,5,B00FL31UF0,"This enthralling movie is based on the book of the same name, and follows directly after the first movie, The Hunger Games. Inspired by the myth of Theseus and the Minotaur, it continues the story of a country named Bread (seriously, Panem is the Latin word for bread), and the worlds most unfortunate lottery.

Not a lot can be said about the plot without giving away too many spoilers. Lets summarize by saying that by not dying in the first movie, Katniss and Peeta accidentally started a rebellion against the government. They are forced into an even more cruel version of the Hunger Games, while outside the thunder dome, everyone is playing the same game - with higher stakes. There are moves and countermoves, and nobody is quite sure what anybody else is doing or why.

The script follows the book pretty closely, and gets all the major plot points right, even though this makes the movie over two hours long (dont worry - the last book is being turned into two movies). I was especially happy that they didn't soften Katniss up and turn the movie into an actual romance, and that they didn't shy away from showing some of the violent scenes (like the first movie did).

It was directed by Francis Lawrence, who usually directs music videos. He didn't direct The Hunger Games, but he did direct the Keanu Reeves vampire flick Constantine, and the Will Smith zombie flick I Am Legend. Oh, and he got an award for making Lady Gagas Bad Romance video. And he does a great job with this movie - Im glad hes already been hired to direct the next two movies. In addition, the acting is great, the script is tight, and the action mixes with politics in the right amounts. Besides these big issues, however, one of the biggest strengths of the film is the way it gets the little details just right - the country of Panem and its cultures seem real. Through dialogue and scenery, you get little glimpses of traditions and events that are unfolding off screen, in other times. You are woven into the fabric of the tale, instead of watching a flat story. Its hard to explain this, but its one way I can identify a high-quality movie - and this movie has it in spades.

Its weird, but another sign of a good movie is how everybody can relate to it. On one hand, Democrats have been claiming that the movie is pretty obviously a criticism of our countrys widening economic gap, and how social justice doesnt usually come from the privileged class. On the other hand, Republicans and Tea Partiers claim the movie is obviously about how Obama sucks and how his government is corrupt and ready to be taken down.

I was a fan of The Hunger Games when it was released, and I was nervous that this movie would be ruined. It turns out that Catching Fire is one of those rare sequels that is better than the first movie.",1387324800,3,2807,4.5068762278978385
6013817,5,B00FL31UF0,"There is always a common worry amongst some that when a sequel is released, it may not be better or exceed the quality of the first. After my long awaited viewing of The Hunger Games Catching Fire, here is why I stand by my final rating.

The Hunger Games Catching Fire brings us back to Katniss Everdeen. Ever since her surprise victory in the 74th games, life for her and her family has changed. Not long after she and Gale(Liam Hemsworth) share an intimate moment, President Snow arrives unexpectedly at her house demanding that she ""convince"" him of her love for Peeta( Josh Hutcherson). Fast forward a victory tour, marriage proposal, and a new gammaker by the name of Plutarch Heavensbee(Phillip Seymour Hoffman) later, Katniss and Peeta are back in the arena.

To start out, this movie is pretty lengthy. But even as the credits began to roll, I did not want to leave my seat. Because just as Suzanne Collins got it right when she published Catching Fire back in 2009, it feels like everything wad done right with this movie. With that said, I won't go into detail about what is in the movie from the book and what isn't, but watching this movie felt like reading the novel all over again.

No bad acting at all here: great performances by each individual. When I read Catching Fire and was introduced to Finnick Odair, I envisioned guys like Ian Somerhalder, Robert Pattinson, etc. you know, guys other guys hate because girls love his looks? Sam Claffin is Finnick Odair and he works the role like a pro so well in the movie. Jeffrey Wright was awesome as Betee, and I was shocked at how well Jena Malone became the character of Johanna Mason. My personal favorite performance( well, besides everyone else's) came in the form of Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee.

The books are fantastic, and the 2012 film and this one are excellent. I appreciate the concept of having a female as the primary heroine in the story as well. If you have not seen this movie yet, be prepared as you are in for a treat. And as anticipation builds for Mockingjay part 1 and 2, Hunger Games fans and movie fans alike will enjoy this movie whole-heartedly. Go See this movie.

I loved the action, the emotions, the philosophical insights, the development of the characters, tension rising, unexpected turns and twists, breathtaking scenery, dystopian touch etc. I suppose culmination is still under way, which is intriguing.
However, the most appealing part was the very human side of the heroine, her sensitivity, love, compassion and desire to fight against injustice.
Overall, very realistic, thought-provoking and up-to-date, even futuristic.
Well-done, by all means and even better than the first one!",1386892800,2,609,5.7032967032967035
6013819,5,B00FL31UF0,It was so brilliantly done and it stayed true to the book!! It's worth it!! And the acting was AMAZING!!,1386720000,,104,4.25
6013820,5,B00FL31UF0,"Nothing could have prepared me for Catching Fire; it was, quite simply, an astonishment on every level. It is so much more than just an action movie; it is also a thought-provoking look at hope, revolution, rebellion, and the importance of government. It's themes encompass grand ideas and touchy subjects with utter fearlessness.

Let us examine what sets The Hunger Games: Catching Fire a cut above the rest:

1. CAST: Surrounding the amazing Jennifer Lawrence (who has matured into a riveting young actress) is a supporting cast to die for. Josh Hutcherson and Liam Hemsworth give good roles, but it is the incomparable Donald Sutherland, who oozes quiet menace from every pore, Phillip Seymour Hoffman, who chews the scenery with a subtle performance, and the amazing Jeffrey Wright who truly astonish. Look also for Jena Malone as Johanna Mason in a brilliant, scene-stealing performance of incredible charisma.

2. CINEMATOGRAPHY: Filled with gorgeous and eye-catching shots, Joe Willems's cinematography fills Panem with striking, practical, gritty, but never dour visuals. From the browns and greys of District 12 to the lush, green, cramped hell of the arena, Catching Fire is one of the best photographed films of the year.

3. COSTUMES AND SET DESIGN: Catching Fire offers, courtesy of small genius Trish Summerville, some of the most luscious, gorgeous, and eye-catching dresses this side of Lord of the Rings. Look for the marked contrast between the grit and the ash of District 12 with the gleam and color of the Capitol. THG's realistic set design and costuming brings a whole new field of ""real"" to the game.

4. ACTION: The perfect blend of psychological build-up and riveting action, the last hour of Catching Fire is an absolute powerhouse of action. Prepare to be glued to the edge of your seat as poisonous fog, lightning, monkeys, psychological torture, and floods beset our heroes. The stakes are raised, and the action is upped, but GONE is the shaky-cam that plagued the first film. Catching Fire has matured in every way.

5. THEMES: This is what astonished me the most; the subtle, devious, brilliantly convoluted game of cat-and-mouse (""moves and counter moves"") played by President Snow, Plutarch Heavensbee, and Katniss Everdeen over the course of the film. The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a thought-provoking and stimulating look at fascism, revolution, revolt, and the dangerous side effects of hope. Bravo for the decision to insert such smart material into a film of this calibre.

On the whole, the cons of Catching Fire are few, and it's pros are many. Welcome, ladies and gentlemen, to the blockbuster event of the year. 5 tributes out of 5.",1386720000,297,2682,5.081818181818182
6013821,5,B00FL31UF0,"I found this second, more serious and much darker ""Hunger Games"" film, even BETTER than the first one. Below more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

First let's say that this film sticks to the book very closely. Of course there is no way you can show during 145 minutes everything that a book contains (and therefore the character of Bonnie and Twill among others are not shown), but I believe virtually everything important is included. And that is a precious thing.

All actors did great. Jennifer Lawrence who plays Katniss Everdeen is of course THE STAR of this film, but everybody around her performed also flawlessly.

The best performance is offered by Josh Hutcherson who plays Peeta Mellark, a young boy madly in love with Katniss and linked to her by most complex links since a long time. This role is the most difficult in all film as Peeta is a most complex character: a baker's son, weaker than many of other young males around and definitely not born to be any kind of hero he nevertheless soldiers on through all the hardships and relentlessly pursues the woman of his life through all the nine circles of hell - and beyond...

Much more attractive, stronger and very manly Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsowrth) is by comparison a little bit easier to play, but the events put him also in a position not easy at all... All of this gives a quite interesting love triangle.

Young actors who play new characters of Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and Johanna Mason (Jena Malone) were very well selected. He is an extremely handsome and very vain young hunk - with brains and a plan. She is not very appealing physically, but she got enough character, potty mouth and (bad)attitude to spread amongst a battalion of more average girls - and still have enough for her own needs...)))

Older actors give also a great show and we have a lot of them. Donald Sutherland is of course the greatest of them and we all know how much he enjoys playing characters which are odd and also sometimes evil - and here he gives us a great show portraying the aged supreme master of Panem, president Coriolanus Snow, a man both odd AND evil... Haymitch has more screen time in this film than in the previous one and Woody Harrelson plays him splendidly - and that is a huge compliment coming from me as I usually don't like this actor. At all.

Effie Trinket (a really splendid and so appropriate last name by the way) also appears more in this film and we come to know her as a person who is similarly grievously annoying, heavily ridiculous, enragingly insufferable and beautifully pathetic - and Elizabeth Banks plays her just like it should be done. Lenny Kravitz offers a surprisingly good and serious performance as Cinna. Stanley Tucci is of course a treasure as Caesar Flickerman, a TV show host and great regime propagandist whom we want to strangle from the second he appears on the screen...)))

And last but not least there is Philip Seymour Hoffman as Plutarch Heavensbee, the Head Gamemaker of 75th Hunger Games, successor of the most unfortunate Seneca Crane who ""choose to stop breathing"" in the previous film...

In smaller but important roles we have Amanda Plummer (Honey Bunny from ""Pulp Fiction"") as Wiress and Lynn Cohen (Ukrainian baby sitter Magda in ""Sex and the city"") as Mags. And also Patrick St. Esprit as Head Peacekeeper Romulus Thread. Honestly, as dissuasion and pacification tools go, the face of this guy alone is worth a whole Panzer division - and then there is still all the rest of him...

A digression here about Peacemakers in general and their weapons. First, it was a great idea (and I think also a tribute to Star Wars) to follow George Lucas and dress the bad guys in white...))) Also, firearms maniacs will appreciate the Peacemakers being armed with Belgian 5,7 mm FNP90, an indeed very futuristic looking weapon, but actually in service since 1990 and presently used by more than 40 countries. This weapon, which has a rate of fire so high that it is possible to cut a man in half with a short burst, was actually used by the troops of one bloodthirsty tyrant, overthrown and killed by insurgents - Muammar Gaddafi... End of digression.

Willow Shields who plays Primrose Everdeen appears only briefly and her character has in fact only one line to say - but when says it, this is a GREAT moment! And then there is little Erika Bierman, barely 12 years old (but looking 9), who plays president's Snow granddaughter, a lovely little thing who speaks only like twice in this film, every time hurting and scaring her dear Grandpa worse than ten thousands armed rebels could ever do...)))

Although not appearing as a character, in this film there is also Rue, the cute little girl from District 11. As we know she was killed in the previous games - but her picture appears in a couple of moments in this film an every time it does so it is an indictment of the Capitol, stronger than an 10 000 words accusation act...

The Arena built for those very special 75th Hunger Games is a really hellish place. Suzan Collins must be quite a kinky gal for inventing such a perversely twisted tool of torture and murder... The whole games are therefore a pretty dramatic thing, albeit ultimately not as dramatic as those portrayed in the previous film (guess we are now more used to the whole thing).

But the reason why I believe this film is SUPERIOR to the previous one resides in all parts which take place BEFORE the games themselves - and they constitute more than half of the film. The feeling of omnipresent TERROR all around the Panem is portrayed very well indeed - and all those who, like me, once lived under an authoritarian repressive regime (I grew up in communist Poland) will fully appreciate it.

The mixture of oppression, repression, censorship, shortage of everything when in the same time regime's nomenklatura lives in opulence, black market as a coping mechanism, the violence of little local tyrants serving the regime, the feeling of powerlessness - it is all there. And then come the whispers of something going on, then some official flags are ripped off at night, then appears the first writing on the wall, the first stone is thrown against a patrolling police car, first signs of rebellion appear and with them HOPE - but also the first dead... It is all there.

The second ""Hunger Games"" is therefore for my personal taste a darker, more serious (sometimes even sinister) treat, very usefully reminding especially the younger viewers what exactly an oppressive regime LOOKS and FEELS like and how difficult and COSTLY it is to regain the freedom once it was lost - or even worse forfeited... And this part of the film definitely overshadows the adventure/action scenes and any kind of love triangle.

The very LAST scene, not involving any actors but just some graphics, is simply GREAT and so full of promise for the next film that I simply cannot wait to see it - and see it I will, as surely as I will buy this one on DVD, as soon as it is available. Definitely. Catch this film as long as it is still playing in theaters - it is worth it. Enjoy!",1386633600,,7113,4.659489633173844

6013823,4,B00FL31UF0,"""The Hunger Games: Catching Fire"" (2013 release; 146 min.) picks up where the first Hunger Games movie left off, and immediately takes us on the Victory Tour and beyond. I read the trilogy of books but it's been a while (18 months, if not longer). There are several unclear plot points in ""Catching Fire"" (the movie), which are probably dealt with in greater detail in the book, none more so that Katniss and Peeta's decision to not get married, after having gotten engaged ""live"". But it's a minor point in the end.

Once we get to the actual Hunger Games in ""Catching Fire"", the action is amazing and pretty much non-stop. I was impressed by the elaborate production design and the special effects were top-notch too.

As to the performances, as it happens, in the previews before ""Catching Fire"" there was the trailer for ""American Hustle"", in which Jennifer Lawrence plays a major role. Couldn't help but think as I saw ""Catching Fire"" that Lawrence (a 23 year old woman) is getting too old for the role of Katniss (a 16 year old girl), and in any event it's hard to see her playing Katniss when we've seen her in a more mature role like in ""Silver Linings Playbook"" last year, and now in the upcoming ""American Hustle"".

All that nit-picking aside, ""Catching Fire"" is a careful and faithful adoption of the book, delivering all the razzle dazzle that we had been hoping for. Onward and upward to Mockingjay Parts 1 and 2!",1386547200,,1426,4.628458498023716
6013824,4,B00FL31UF0,"Just watched this movie a today on the movie theater. I enjoyed the movie for the most part. It has plenty of action and for the most part it is very entertaining. It follows the story from the book pretty religiously. If you are planning to watch this movie it is highly recommended that you read the book before. It definitely fills up a lot of the details that are missing in the movie. I found the beginning of the movie to be lacking in details as opposed to the book. There is a lot more detailed when it comes to the internal struggle that Katniss is having adjusting back to her regular life. The book also spends more time describing the tributes and their personalities. The movie does this to a certain extend but i guess there is always going to be limitations when you are talking about 2 hour movies. Once the movie starts to go more into the actual ""games' the action really picks up.

I found the acting job to be pretty darn good. If you like the first movie you are going to enjoy this one a lot. Jennifer Lawrence proves once again that she is not just a pretty face. She definitely has talent. Woody Harrelson once again did a master job reprising his role of Haymitch. I love the cast. There are no complains here.

Overall, i have to say i enjoyed the movie. I do have to reiterate again that if you want to get the full experience of the movie that you read the book first so you actually understand the story better. If i had never read the books myself i would have probably gave it 3 stars simply because i felt that the movie was rushed a bit. Not to say it is bad but just lacks that something that made the book so appealing. I like it though and i recommend it.",1386460800,,1691,4.216049382716049

6013826,5,B00FL31UF0,"Catching Fire takes place right where the first movie left off.  It is a better than the first movie and is definitely worth seeing.

In this movie, Katniss and Peeta's defiance at the end of the first film has evoked feelings of revolution throughout the districts.  This has caused President Snow to be very concerned.  The districts are rising up and the Peacekeepers are having trouble maintaining control.

Because Katniss is now a symbol of freedom, Snow feels the need to kill her.  He cannot do it openly, so one of his advisers figures out a more clever way.  The upcoming games will feature only individuals from each district who are past winners.  Because Katniss is the only female from District 12 ever to win, she is automatically entered into the newest Hunger Games.

This film is about two and a half hours long.  What is good about this movie is that it moves along fairly quickly so that you do not feel like you have watched a film that long.  Watching this film in a theater was a great experience and was worth the price of admission.

As far as comparing it to the first film, Catching Fire is better than the original.  They are both great movies, but that should tell you how good the sequel is.  My only problem with the film is that the ending could have been better, but it is passable.

Well worth watching and it is a movie you should watch in the theater.  Also, when it comes out on DVD, it will be worth it to add this movie to your collection.  You can watch this movie more than once.

I just thought it was a good movie that was overhyped. As a result of this feeling, I was not in a hurry to watch Catching Fire. I just happened to be bored after work one day and decided I needed a movie to watch. I chose Catching Fire since it was the only movie on the list worth watching (for me at least).

I have to say I was blown away by the movie. It really keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time, is filled with surprises and unexpected occurrences, and has downright amazing acting! I swear, the acting was so good that at times you forget your watching a movie with actors/actresses.

I think the movie would be better suited with a NON high tech theme, something like waterworld or road warriors.  Civilized people don't appreciate the killing of kids, but un civilized societies do.  One where the strong rule and the weak die.
I just can't see this scenario moving forward and then to have book 3 as it is,with district 13 makes even less of a believable arena, giving them a ""cease fire"" if they can tell others they nuked them?
I think the games concept is interesting but not with kids UNDER 18 fighting to the death.  I can see younger adults doing this but not kids 12-18, doesn't add up to me.

6013835,5,B00FL31UF0,"""The Hunger Games"" series is theoretically a young-adult series about one girl's struggles in a post-apocalyptic world where food is scarce and children battle for the entertainment of the upper classes. ""Catching Fire"" gives us a window into that world that ""The Hunger Games"" only hinted at.  It is an alternately thrilling and depressing view of a world burning with hope that Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) inadvertently started by simply surviving her first Hunger Games.

It all starts with President Snow (Donald Sutherland) openly threatening Katniss' family.  She must keep up appearances by smiling and delivering on the fairy tale ending promised by the conclusion of the first film.  But her victory tour, with her faux romantic interest Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) at her side, slowly peels back layer after layer of just how bad things are.  Anyone even showing a hint of support for Katniss is executed.  The whirlwind press tour featuring Katniss and Peeta only further inflames the rebels to fight against the hierarchy of Panem. So Snow hatches up another plan with a new gamemaker, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman). And that plan is another Hunger Games.

And so we have the centerpiece of the film, which is in fact a small part of a much larger narrative -- people fighting in a hostile environment. This Hunger Games is different; the contestants are all survivors of previous games, and they're pretty pissed off to find government reneging on its promise of keeping them safe after surviving the last one.

A motley crew of contestants are assembled, some perfect for the role like Finnick Odair (Sam Claflin) and others like the mute grandmotherly Mags (Lynn Cohen).  But the real twist is that this installment of The Hunger Games isn't about the Hunger Games at all. It's about the world on fire, and even Katniss is just a small spark amidst the blaze.

The most frustrating part of ""Catching Fire"" is that it covers so much and yet is incomplete. It ends on a difficult note without resolution, which just makes it that much harder waiting for the next installment.",1385856000,10,2116,5.002849002849003
6013836,5,B00FL31UF0,"Now *this* is what I was expecting when I screened that first film.

Again, until that first installment, I had never heard of the term, the author, the rabid fans - none of it. What the movie presented was all that I had to judge. And I was so sorely disappointed. All that hyperbole had raised my expectation something akin to cinematic tumescence. Energy wasted.

Not that I was only seeking bloodshed, but let's be bluntly honest here and say 'Hunger Games' was an insipid powderpuff of a film. I half expected a bunch of vendors outside the theater hawking t-shirts and toy figurines to the kiddies. One of the films I recommended in my original review in the hopes that future installments of the franchise would achieve a similar experience was '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Condemned/dp/B000WUBVKQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Condemned</a>' - a digital Roman Colosseum with brutal games of death for the sick pleasure of the anonymous multitude. My fears for the second installment, thankfully, was put to rest quickly. This was an exponential improvement. Going way beyond some marginal refinement by touching up the corners of an already weak product.

Gary Ross left the project or was shown the door - either way - I'm terribly grateful.

The new filmmakers exceeded my limited expectations.

Simultaneously - and in true '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rollerball/dp/B002WCFT0K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rollerball</a>' fashion - exposing the social plague that is ""cultural popularity"" and the hidden manipulation by the elites as they use entertainment to divert, distract and appease the unruly angry masses. In case you missed it - that's you, me, and all the other 99% regular folk. It's important to remember the elite's mantra for centuries has been:

""Keep them occupied with bread and circuses.""

As the powerful have unhappily discovered that Katniss' popularity is working against their purpose, they have decided to break her the same way they made her - by way of the games. And despite promises of a life carefree of such demands, the establishment has devised a twist to bring back past victors in a battle royal. This time no pair will emerge - one lone survivor will be crowned all-time champion. And Katniss Everdeen cannot and will not be that champion. Designed specifically to break her spirit, and by association, the spirit of the people who have discovered in her their own long suppressed voice screaming for freedom.

And we finally get to see the actress who won the Academy Award at age 22. Jennifer delivered a superlative performance as the district youngster growing up much too soon. The long dark shadow that one carries inside as one murders a way to false fame and fortune. Katniss finally having to deal with the reality that she killed other children. The true price of her survival now eating away at her soul.

Further, by showcasing the revolting clownish existence of Celebrity - a pathetic new world made acceptable by empty-headed twits like the Kardashians and their reality-tv ilk; finally exposing that world for the whorish fame-seeking lifestyle it is. Sadly, unlike this fictional vision, has already infected the current and upcoming generation of Americans. <smh>

Yes, this is the movie I was hoping for.

Finally, given the processed pre-digested PowerPoint presentation of the first film, I had no choice but to dismiss Josh Hutcherson as nothing more than a juvenile automaton; a walking, talking cardboard cut-out. But Director Francis Lawrence gave the young man an actual role to fill; a real performance to execute. And he did so with adroitness. Ditto Elizabeth Banks who, in a few scant scenes, revealed a depth of character and thespian skill peering beyond the garish pancake. A pair of unexpected pleasant surprises to go along with with so many other wonderful elements found in this exceptional sequel.

Overall, I'm really, really pleased. It gives one hope that some executive producers are not completely self-involved in their own navels; the ability see things honestly - without consulting lying marketing departments and their pimps - where things have gone wrong and having the proper insight on how to fix the problem is a very rare thing in cinema.

Internally debated this movie review for several days, but I'm now comfortable to defend = five stars.

Personal Note:

- This is what comes of finding the right director for a project. Not just name-branding or submitting to the rantings of the internet mob - but strength of will to do the right thing. Replacing Gary Ross was a game changer - and the absolute right thing. Francis Lawrence captured, what I understand from perusing forums where hardcore fans congregate, what the Games are truly about; he understood what the writer was attempting. A decisive cleave at the poorer functionary to find the right vision in the right hands of the right creative helm.

And this is a perfect example of why I give Disney Corp and their subsidiary Marvel Entertainment such a look of incredulity. You have two major winning franchises in 'Iron Man' and 'Thor'. So what do you do? Change directors and produce infinitely less enjoyable films. Why?

Stealing defeat from the jaws of victory.

6013837,1,B00FL31UF0,"Adolescents like non-stop action with little to think about.  Yes, ""there was always action"" - senseless, meaningless action.  A GOOD drama - play, movie, tv episode - varies the intensity, mixing quiet with noisy scenes so the audience is not tired out by non-stop action.  Besides the lack of variety, too much of the plot just made no sense.  Absence of graphic violence? Perhaps the reviewer who wrote this was at the concession stand when Kathness's lover was being brutally flogged by a storm trooper, or when the resulting horrid gashes were being treated with some caustic liquid that made him scream in agony. Many were the antagonists who were skewered by Kathness's magic bow and arrows, which were washed into the artificial lake at one point, only to reappear in the next minute in her hand, her quiver magically replenished from three to a dozen arrows. No doubt about it - she's a special gal!  About the only good thing in this film - which was all middle, since its beginning is in an earlier movie and its resolution is still to come - was the appeal of Jennifer Lawrence, who is proving to be a major talent who fully deserves the academy award given to her so early in her career.",1385856000,18,1200,4.615023474178404
6013838,5,B00FL31UF0,Jennifer Lawrence was amazing in this movie.  Her ability to convey emotions simply by facial expressions and body language is one of the best in the movie industry.  My wife and I were a little concerned after reading the books that this wouldn't be a good movie but instead it put things in visual context that made the story more understandable and also provided a much needed filter for the negative thoughts of Catness.  The whole cast did a wonderful job and bravo to the director for bringing this masterpiece to life.,1385856000,2,525,4.684782608695652
6013839,2,B00FL31UF0,"I really enjoyed the movie until the end. The ending was one of the worse I've ever seen. Why? Simply because there was no ending! It was like watching a movie that breaks at Intermission. Unfortunately it was not the Intermission but the end of the movie. I am not against sequels & quite enjoy them, but all movie goers deserve a proper ending ... without having to wait 2 years for the movie to continue ... my opinion, without any criticism whatsoever of the actors ...",1385769600,3,473,4.448275862068965
6013840,5,B00FL31UF0,"As it turns out the Hunger Games was not berry good for the empire as Katniss (Jennifer Lawrence) has inspired hope and rebellion. Instead of just killing her, they have changed the rules ( see Jonathan ""Roller Ball"") and devised a new Hunger Game of past contestants. The game is stacked against her as contestants must battle the elements more than each other.

The beginning of the film lacks the crazy action of the second half, but it is theme driven for the true sci-fi fan. Katniss is a hero, but as she says, ""By killing people."" In those 3 simple words. Katniss who suffers from Post Traumatic Stress Syndrome, conveys the perplexity of war heroes with a moral conscience. The film also touches on the power of celebrity as they ""never get off this train: and the trouble they cause if the don't ""stick to the script."" The culture is set up similar to the Roman Empire where bread and circus' s keep the masses in check and where Romans ""Eat to puke and puke to eat."" Katniss, is a hero because her compassion expresses in all of us the person we want to be. As such it is easy for her to gain allies.

The film contains all the elements of an ideal cult classic complete with theme, special effects, drama, top stars, and a touch of light humor.

I do not recommend watching this film if you haven't seen the first one (or read the books) as it doesn't recap.",1385769600,,1369,4.403162055335969
6013841,5,B00FL31UF0,"I just returned from watching Catching Fire a week after it's West Coast premiere... Needless to say, I was blown away. This movie is the closest book-to-movie adaption I've ever seen. Easily.

I was so blown away by this movie that I was glued to my chair. The relationship between Finnick and Mags, the relationship between Katniss and Peeta and Katniss and Gale.

For the few parts that were strayed from the book, I didn't mind, as they were few and noticeably necessary. If every scene was followed in the movie, then it would be longer than anyone could endure.

Catching Fire is easily the greatest movie of the year, thus earning an easy 5 stars from me.",1385683200,4,662,4.593220338983051
6013842,4,B00FL31UF0,"My review of The Hunger Games was a little negative due to the weak acting of the supporting cast, but that's vastly improved in Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence, who impressed me with I Am Legend, replaces Gary Ross, and I'm happy with the result. Lawrence will also direct the final two installments.

As in the opening movie, Jennifer Lawrence is the key ingredient. Remove her from the project and it just wouldn't be as good. She rightly received an Oscar for Silver Linings Playbook, and has to show a whole range of emotions in Catching Fire. You'll see what I mean during the opening scene in which she has a flashback to events we witnessed in the previous movie. If I had to list the most promising actresses under the age of 30, Lawrence would clearly be right at the top. In fact, there are few actresses of any generation that I would rather watch.

For the purposes of this review, I'm going to assume that you have seen the first installment. If you haven't, don't attempt to see Catching Fire before you know how the story begins. You'll miss some of the references for sure.

We learned in The Hunger Games that victorious tributes could look forward to a better life. Hunger and poverty were supposed to be a thing of the past, and the fear of being asked to fight for survival could be removed forever. But it wouldn't be much of a sequel if Katniss just rode around waving to the crowds, would it? President Snow (Donald Sutherland) devises a scheme to get her in a new battle, only this time it's bigger and better than ever. Without giving away too much, let's just say that there are no tributes that are easy to kill in this sequel; those involved are generally older and more experienced.

The different tributes aren't the only characters who are new to Catching Fire. Seneca Crane (Wes Bentley) and his questionable facial hair has been replaced by Philip Seymour Hoffman, who plays Head Gamemaker Plutarch Heavensbee. Hoffman gives a typical multifaceted performance, and the motivations of his character are hard to guess. During a conversation with Katniss, he claims to have volunteered for the position of Head Gamemaker, even though the life expectancy is not great. Does that mean that Seneca Crane wasn't the only one who was punished for disappointing President Snow in the past? Have other tributes caused trouble for Snow?

The main difference between this sequel and the first installment is the depth of story and the quality of the acting. We learn a lot more about Katniss. Who does she love, and to what degree? What sacrifices must she make in her life to fit in and protect the people she loves. If you think about it, we all do similar things in our own lives. We socialize for the sake of our families or our careers, when a lot of the time we would rather spend our free moments pursuing things that we enjoy. Many of us give up things for our children or ailing relatives. We can identify with Katniss, even though we won't be asked to fight to the death. As for the acting, Hoffman, Jeffrey Wright, Amanda Plummer, and others, give the characters more depth than in the first movie. We are also given more information about Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) and Effie (Elizabeth Banks). I wonder how much of this is due to Simon Beaufoy's part in the screenplay? He's on a roll after writing Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and Salmon Fishing in the Yemen.

One of the best scenes comes early in the movie as Katniss and Peeta deviate from their prepared agenda during a tour of the other districts. Instead of mouthing the carefully prepared scripts, they choose to make a more meaningful contribution. I won't reveal what happens, but it's a memorable scene.

The Capitol is portrayed as being particularly evil in this sequel, just in case you were in any doubt. Its dubious agenda is enforced by stormtroopers who look like they stepped straight out of Star Wars. Although some of the first 90 minutes is fairly predictable fare, I welcomed the chance to explore this world and its characters in more depth. It's hard to care about someone if you don't understand who they are, or what they are fighting for. Francis Lawrence did a great job of avoiding clumsy exposition in I Am Legend, and he avoids that trap in Catching Fire too. Instead of spelling out the reason for every little action, he allows scenes to naturally unfold so that we can see their significance for ourselves.

Fans of action might be disappointed with Catching Fire. It takes a long time for the tributes to make it into the arena, and once there, they rely more on alliances than before. This story is more about teamwork and figuring out who is good or evil than it is about slaughtering everyone in sight. It's a richer story overall.

Another reason for disappointment might be the abrupt ending. Like The Lord of the Rings, the story is split into several parts, and this second installment of four won't have a conclusion that neatly resolves all of the conflict. For that, you'll need to see the next two movies.

I think that Francis Lawrence has improved upon the first installment significantly, and I'll be seeing how things pan out. I might even read Suzanne Collins' trilogy before I see Mockingjay Part 1 next year.",1385683200,7,5258,4.674594594594595
6013843,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie is AWESOME! I saw it today and was very well pleased with the entire production. Definitely a must-see!!!,1385510400,2,116,4.85
6013844,5,B00FL31UF0,"Fans of the Hunger Games were dissapointed with the first movie and rightfully so. The film was pretty good, but didn't do the book justice, as it was extremely toned down and nowhere near as in depth as the book was. With a new director for the second book, they did not make the same mistake twice. As someone who has read all the books, I can tell you that Catching Fire is page for page exactly like the book. It was so amazing how much of the book is captured on the screen, as I actually saw the scenes play out the exact same way they did in my head when I first read Catching Fire. Everything down to the last detail is perfect! Jennifer Lawrence and Josh Hutcherson return and are both fantastic, so good in fact, that I really wonder if Suzanne Collins had them in mind when she wrote this series. The casting is perfect, the acting is perfect, and the direction is perfect. For those of you who never read the series and didn't really see what was so special about the first film, I really suggest that you give this film a chance. I won't give anything away, but this isn't what you expect, especially the ending, and while there are two more films remaining, this will be your last look inside the arena. After Catching Fire, the series turns into something completely different and that's what I love about it. It would have been simple to have three books about the games, but the games are actually a small part of the second film, and won't take place in the next two films. Rarely do I give a film 5 stars, but the second Hunger Games film is done so much better than the first. They don't hold anything back in this one, and you are introduced to a whole other set of unique characters, that you will be seeing in the other films. The cast is brilliant and new Director, Francis Lawrence, manages to capture essence of the book and bring it to life on the big screen, with unbelievable detail. If you didn't read the books and just don't understand what's so great about this series, go see this movie.",1385510400,2,2021,4.33509234828496
6013845,3,B00FL31UF0,"Catching Fire makes a number of improvements over its lackluster predecessor and is a much better film for it. After a very strong first half though, it takes a bit of a dive and by the end I was left a little underwhelmed.

Before I get to that though- the positives. One of my biggest problems with the first film was that it took a weighty, horrific, and tragic concept and turned it into a film that felt too light and easily digestible. It could be the fault of the source material (I haven't read any of the novels), but it felt like so much thematic potential was wasted on flimsy, poorly choreographed action sequences and a hackneyed love plot. After a promising half-hour, the film quickly devolved into a standard action/thriller affair that barely scratched the surface of the intriguing concept. Catching Fire definitely rectifies this for the most part. It feels appropriately weighty and more solemn that the first film with public executions and other atrocities of the Capitol put on clear display. It also delves more into the psychology of fear and how it can be used to oppress which is a welcomed bit of depth.

The excellent cast helps to sell all of these heavier moments. The acting in the film is uniformly excellent, and once again Stanley Tucci steals every scene that hes in. The award for most improved character unequivocally goes to Katniss though. In the first film I felt that she came off as overly stoic and enigmatic. I realize that these traits are supposed to be elements of her character, but on screen it didn't translate well and she seemed emotionally flat and distant. Katniss in Catching Fire is a much more dynamic character with clear moments of desperation, helplessness, strength, and resolve. Thanks to the excellent performance of Jennifer Lawrence and the improved script, she feels like a much more fully realized character with the power and charisma to properly carry the film.

Like its predecessor though, Catching Fire is still a very front-loaded film. Essentially every great scene in the movie is over by the time it reaches the halfway point. One scene in particular I found to be particularly well done was the scene where Katniss and Peta are broadcast to the Capitol for the first time outside of their houses in Victors Village. The scene jumps back and forth between the bright, glittery stage of the Capitol where the broadcast is being played and the barren, dark, and dreary village. It creates a poignant visual metaphor that very successfully conveys the superficiality of the games that comes across it a subtle and tasteful way. I sensed a bit of social commentary in this scene as well concerning our own entertainment in the real world and how superficial and plastic it so often is.

The weighty, intriguing scenes like this though slowly but surely gave way to a final act that once again left me wanting more. The hunger games themselves were definitely better in this film than they were in the last. The participants felt a little more fleshed-out and had their own distinct personalities rather than the one-dimension villainous participants we were treated to in the first film. The action sequences were also choreographed and filmed much more coherently. Still though, I felt the portion of the movie that takes place in the hunger games once again disrupted the flow of the film and deadened the narrative tension that had been building up until that point. Once the games start, there is almost no attention paid to any of the characters other than those inside the dome. All of the thematically interesting, morally thought-provoking scenes are left behind for uninspired action sequences which just drag on and on. We basically just watch Katniss and friends run away from poison fog, rabid apes, tidal waves and other dangerous things over and over. Its a jarring transition from all of the political intrigue and dramatic, weighty character interactions that came before and just sticks out like a sore thumb.

Ultimately, Catching Fire takes a lot of steps in the right direction but theres still undoubtedly room for improvement. It once again fails to fully impress with the actual hunger games portion of the film but theres also a lot of powerfully acted and poignant moments as well before it enters that final slog. These are the moments that give me hope that the series will be able to truly deliver on its interesting premise in future films.

6013846,5,B00FL31UF0,"[ABSOLUTELY NO SPOILERS IN THIS REVIEW: My discussion of the plot occurs in the fourth paragraph following this one, and should represent no more ""news"" than you'd get in the trailer.]

This is an absolutely faithful and extremely well-made adaptation of the second book in the trilogy, and for those who are fans of the books (and the preceding film) rest assured; you're going to like this movie. The only caveat I offer is this: CATCHING FIRE concerns itself less with characterization than it does with plot. Big things are happening, and it is the furtherance of those elements that will carry us from The Hunger Games [HD], the first book, to the dramatic events of Mockingjay, the final one.

I had really been wondering about this entry in the series, and it was more than just the fact that it was the pivotal entry: I really had a few questions after having read the book. What in fact would this warring arena look like--particularly concerning its ""boundaries""? Were Johanna Mason and Finnick Odair going to meet my expectations? How different will this movie look and feel under the direction of Francis Lawrence (no relation to Jennifer)--who was primarily a music video director, though he directed I Am Legend and Water For Elephants (and will helm the next two parts of MOCKINGJAY, the trilogy's conclusion)?

Well, I was pleasantly surprised in all three cases, and more. Not only did the arena hold up well--though I would have liked a little more physical clarity in its climactic scene--but I felt Jena Malone as Johanna and Sam Claflin as Finnick both hit it out of the park. And I found no real faults with Lawrence's direction either; the movie had a suitably different sense this time around, certainly, but I wasn't overly aware that it was any more a directorial choice than it was a narrative one.

The plot is only a little different this time around. A very imperious commander-in-chief, President Coriolanus Snow (played by a malevolent Donald Sutherland) is sick not only of Katniss' popularity following her (and Peeta's) survival of the 74th Hunger Games, but also of how that popularity seems to be empowering a rebellious foundation. Believing that her victory came from more strategy than any real prowess, he has decided to do away with her once and for all: he will fill the new year's games with those who survived their own games, and feels sure one of them will be able to end her existence once and for all.

I found the movie this time around really came around to three acts: the first concerned the?? , who orders our heroine Katniss to be more convincing at selling the romantic angle between Peeta and herself, OR ELSE. The second act concerned the preparation for the games, and a pretty grim recounting of the various champions Katniss and Peeta will now be forced to face. The final act comes down to the game itself, and how uniquely it will evolve.

So, to those who were disappointed by the movie's de-emphasis of characterization, I must admit I am puzzled; the second book was not ABOUT characterization. The only real fleshing out of personalities occurs in terms of what those opponents from the other districts will bring to the game...and one doesn't expect to learn all that much about any one of them. This movie is more about strategies: it is concerned with President Snow's demand that this year's game will serve up Katniss' head on a platter, and he has made himself even MORE sure of that fact by hiring a new Game Master: a self-assured Plutarch Heavensbee (played self-assuredly by Philip Seymour Hoffman). That her death is believed to be so guaranteed is made clear by the plans Katniss and Peeta themselves make with Haymitch (Woody Harrelson) who is portrayed less comically and more scrupulously this time around).

What this movie also lets us see more openly and with a little better focus is the true manner of the police state that makes up the twelve districts, and the ugliness of despotic rule. The numbing effect of Snow's terrifying rule is clarified through not only the fish-belly grey machines and armored men who rule the districts, but also through the morphing portrayals of many of the continued secondary and tertiary characters, none better than in the albeit-so-slight evolution of the uber-flippant Effie, played especially well by Elizabeth Banks.

Ultimately, I found this to be an entirely fitting second movie. I've heard others claim it was too long, but I felt just the opposite, and wished it could have been longer. I was shocked when the end came, and I read the book. I so badly wanted more that I hoped the movie would continue past the all-telling nature of Katniss' transforming expression.

When all is said and done, I think that might be the truest sign of a motion picture's success. And CATCHING FIRE had that in spades.",1385424000,3,4833,4.806257521058965
6013847,5,B00FL31UF0,"When Hunger Games came out I had mixed feelings about it. On one hand, it had Jennifer Lawrence in a role that would obviously make a star, an excellent overall cast, good writing, and not bad everything else. It was a throw-back to the old post-apocalyptic films of the 70's and 80's, and for once, an Indie feeling film with an experimental soundtrack and shaky-camera actually felt like a pretty good fit. It all felt rather...real.

And on the other hand, the first Hunger Games is quite a downer of a film. Kids thrown into an arena to kill each other or die by various other means is hardly a fun topic, and you have to feel a bit guilty by being...entertained. But the whole point of the film was not to glorify that sort of thing, but rather to draw attention to the kind of world we have could perhaps make in the future, and what people are willing to do to survive, and to hold onto their humanity no matter what.

Ultimately the first film didn't really have a climax exactly, It just kind of...ended. It kind of left you hanging in the air, obviously in anticipation of the sequels to come. And come they shall.

This film is to the first Hunger Games what Thor:The Dark World was to Thor. It's more fleshed out, higher budget, has been writing, more character development, more style, FAR better cinematography, and and  more block-buster type special effects, sound mixing, and musical score. Is it better for it? I think so.

The first film made us feel like we were in Appalachia and then whisked away to Rome for the gladiator arena. Everything to do with District 12 had a poverty-stricken, folksy feel about it that made it all very gripping and heart-breaking. And when the troops from the Capital poured in for a Reaping, it really felt like the technological overlords were coming down from on high to made examples out of the serfs. The games themselves were the hammer driving the nail home, with a resonating message that a nobody from nowhere could single-handedly make a difference, simply because they refused to play the game.

Fast forward to now, and our perception of the world has changed as Katniss' perception has changed. She can't hide from the horribleness of the world anymore, because her actions have brought the world crashing down. She wanted to just return to her old way of life and forget the nightmare, but the old way of life is gone forever, and the nightmares are not going away. What is there left to do but face them?

The first half of the first Hunger Games dragged a bit for me, but this sequel rockets through the film's setup in District 12, moving forcefully through the events that lead to the Quarter Quell. Everything is in-character. There are less quiet moments to contemplate and dream, because the world that lead to those quiet moments and dreams has been shattered. Everything is slicker, more futuristic, because the Capitol has made it's presence known. There is no need for quiet character development in slow-moving flashbacks, because the future is coming quickly, and things are unraveling fast.

The Quarter Quell itself is of course the cornerstone of the film, the thing which would inevitably make or break it. Could the makers of the film get the characters of Joanna and Finnick right? Could they nail the puzzle of the arena and the traps it contains? Yes. Yes they did. I found myself willingly accepting the characters as they are introduced, and getting wrapped up in their fates all over again. And the conclusion...was perfect. And was handled in a way that only Jennifer Lawrence could make happen. She continues to carry the series.

The first film had some CGI special effects and the sequel has more. The first film had action sequences and this film has more. The drama has been kicked up a notch (a bit cheesier or melodramatic for some people I am sure). There are more characters, and the characters we have are deeper. The dialog is better. The music is more cinematic. There is some gorgeously framed shots that are high class film-making. This is a film to see more than once in a theater.

I watched the first film before reading the books. And I do not like the books. I never really wanted to own the first film though I have watched it several times and gotten a lot out of it. Now...

I am glad the final book will be two films because the story needs time to unravel and have the required emotional impact. I'm not a fan of the books, but the first film was better than the book, the second film is even better than the first (and MUCH better than the book, which was my favorite of the series). I cannot wait to see what is done with the final two films, because while Katniss was an empty protagonist who stumbled her way through tumultuous times in the books, here she a complex character whose story is very gripping indeed.

Where the first movie failed to build a solid foundation for the world of the Hunger Games to stand on, Catching Fire came in to make that foundation more solid. Some of that is, for lack of a better term, accidental. For instance, the fact that Katniss and Peeta are the picture of good health (along with Katniss' family) is now to be expected, so that no longer worked against the movie. District 12 and its inhabitants were more rundown and dilapidated, so the contrast between Katniss and her fellow citizens (other than Gale) was more distinct. All of that was good and gave a more realistic feel to the movie than the last one had.

We got a broader view of the world in general and of the Peacekeepers in action, which was way more disturbing than the first movie would have lead us to believe. The second movie made us believe all the things the first movie only told us to believe. It's actually the whole ""show vs tell"" thing. The first movie tells us the people are oppressed, but Catching Fire shows us.

It shows us when Gale is taken and flogged and Katniss almost shot.
It shows us when the old man in District 11 is pulled from the crowd and shot in the head.
It shows when Katniss and Peeta are offered the puking beverage so that they can continue to participate in the party.
And it shows us when Cinna is beaten (to death, I presume) right in front of Katniss after the tube closes on her and all she can do is watch. And scream.

The political intrigue, almost absent from The Hunger Games, also elevates Catching Fire. Plutarch Heavensbee is a great character, and I was never quite sure what was going on with him. There was what I thought was happening, but Philip Seymour Hoffman was so good, I spent a lot of time doubting myself. Of course, Hoffman is great, and I was delighted to see him in the movie. Plutarch wasn't the only one playing games, but he was the primary one, and I almost felt sorry for President Snow and his inability to adequately play politics. Snow seemed to know one tactic: ""Smash!"" Or threaten to smash. Or kill.

The acting in Fire was much better than in Games.

Lawrence really stepped into the part and made us feel the horror and rage of the things she was going through. Also the lost-ness in parts. She was impressive this time rather than just existing in the role.
Woody Harrelson continued to be great as Haymitch.
Elizabeth Banks moved beyond her makeup, which was actually rather impressive considering that you couldn't really see her face. The emotion she was able to bring through in relation to how she felt about the injustices that were happening was incredible.
Stanley Tucci continued to be awesome.
As I already said, Philip Seymour Hoffman was tremendous.
Sam Claflin was really good.
But the big surprise was Jena Malone. She was great!

The greatest success of the movie, though, was that it made me want to read the books. Almost. I'm still not going to read them, because, based on many of the things I've read about it, the movie fixes many of the problems from the first movie and from the books. The focus on the politics seems to be a movie thing not a book thing, and that's the stuff I really liked. So, still, not reading the books, but I'm slightly less set against them now. That's an achievement.",1385424000,3,3297,4.494156928213689
6013850,4,B00FL31UF0,"I did not despise the first Hunger Games film.  I instead found it unspectacular through and through, a neither-here-nor-there cinematic experience to be placed in the second or third tier of action and science-fiction films focused on the potential end of the world and/or futuristic totalitarian governments.  With a new director, a larger budget, and an expanded ensemble cast, however, the second film, Catching Fire, represents a vast improvement, and I am now invested in the storyline of the franchise and its bow wielding heroine, played again with convincing angst and agility by Jennifer Lawrence.

The past credits of Austrian born American director Francis Lawrence include a long, long list of music videos (for artists such as Green Day, Jay Z, Lady Gaga, and Third Eye Blind) and entertaining, if unmemorable films with a great deal more visual power than depth, including Constantine and I Am Legend.  So he is without a doubt more of a pro gun-for-hire than a genius-in-waiting, but he shines in this particular context, delivering the overcast atmosphere and dawn-of-a-revolution scope required to give this YA adaptation a genuine grit and spirit of involving unease.  With design choices and details both small (blood stains on the snow-white suit of a Capitol soldier) and large (the foreboding, overheated, Joseph Conrad ready jungle environment where the titular murder spectacle unfolds), as well as crisp and graceful camera movements, he and his behind-the-scenes team have assembled a well-designed and grimly beautiful film.

The introduction of a few mega-talented character actors, including a charming, nerdy Jeffrey Wright and an icily competent Philip Seymour Hoffman, is another welcome pleasure of the film, though, unfortunately, neither the wooden Josh Hutcherson nor the studly, but largely absent Liam Hemsworth are able to match the magnificent Jennifer Lawrence and truly ignite the film's Twilight style, teen friendly love triangle.  As a bid to tell a story of youthful love and coming-of-age amidst the turbulence of revolution, the Hunger Games saga still comes up a tad short, but at least the revolution itself is now ablaze.",1385424000,,2173,5.354838709677419
6013851,5,B00FL31UF0,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

There are a couple major changes in this second film of the Suzanne Collins novels.  First, thanks to the success of the original 2011 movie, the production budget doubled.  Second, Francis Lawrence (""I Am Legend"") takes over from Gary Ross as director.  And while the money shows up on the screen in terms of special effects, costumes and sets, the film's brilliance remains centered with the actors, especially the remarkable Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen.

The film picks up where the first left off.  Katniss and Peeta (Josh Hutcherson) have returned victorious to District 12, believed to be in love.  At least by the population of Panem (a stand in for a future North America).  In reality, Katniss is conflicted.  While she has feelings for Peeta, she is also drawn to her lifelong friend Gale (Liam Hemsworth).  In the novels, Katniss speaks in the first person so we get an inside look at her confusion and inexperience with romantic love.  In the film, it is up to Ms. Lawrence to convince audiences of her confusion.  She is pulled in both directions by actors Hutcherson and Hemsworth.  We get it.  And we believe it.

Promised to be safe from further battlefield Games, we quickly learn it is not to be for Katniss, Peeta and their mentor, Haymitch (Woody Harrelson).  While on their victory tour throughout the districts, there is an unease in the population.  They see the survival of two instead of just one in the last Games as a sign of rebellion against the Capitol and their leader President Snow (Donald Sutherland).  Snow along with the new Games Director, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman) design something special for the 75th Games known as the Quarter (as in century) Quell.  This time, the pool of previous district winners will be used for those chosen to fight to the death.

Since Katniss is the only female winner from District 12, she's a lock to go again.  When Haymitch is chosen in the lottery, Peeta quickly volunteers, essentially to help the girl he loves.  The movie lingers artfully getting to the Games as Lawrence and his writers (Simon Beaufoy & Michael Arndt) take their time further developing the relationships, especially between Katniss and Peeta.  The middle section of the film is heartbreaking.

For the Games themselves, the film creates a cadre of allies which includes another hunky fighter (Sam Claflin), the wise-ass Johanna (terrific Jena Malone) and others.  As most people know, this terrific film works as a place-setter for the concluding chapter which will be broken up into two films.  With that in mind, it ends somewhat abruptly and contains a plot thread that didn't make sense to me, either in the book or the movie.  Having said that, ""Catching Fire"" is a modest improvement over the excellent first film and a faithful adaptation of the book.  It looks better on screen and the relationships are deepened.  This is good stuff.",1385424000,3,2958,4.917171717171717
6013852,5,B00FL31UF0,"While watching the Hunger Games: Catching Fire, I had watched as two separate viewers: The Book Purist and The Film Goer.  Now from both standpoints I was miraculously impressed. In all honesty, there were a number of changes that I had hoped for improvement from the book, such as the scenes of devastation and an increase in the tension between Katniss and President Snow.  Everything was delivered as promised and surprisingly every new actor brought into the franchise more than delivers their parts. Finnick  is just as outgoing and likable as as in the novels and Johanna most certainly stands out strongly. Even Mags was very polite and a joy to have on screen. Johanna Mason is cheeky and angry as in the novel and impressively just as brash. Sadly, since you must cut things in translation for film, several of those same characters have had to have their back stories cut, which is sad, but manageable. Out of all the new actors established in this sequel the most amazing was Philip Seymour Hoffman's portrayal of Plutarch Heavensbee. As one who has read the novel I was able t pick up on the subtleties that floated in the film and every moment that Hoffman is on scene he brings a certain mysteriousness and impressive acting out of his character. Not only does he seem menacing in the right ways, but also his motivations are so behind a veil that you actually want to know more about him and hang onto every bit of information gleaned from his mouth. His scenes with Donald Sutherland are nothing short of brilliant. Watching two veteran actors bounce off of each other and build scenes in this franchise is a welcome respite in it's quiet moments.

This is not to single out what the new film adds to the franchise and ignore the old. All of the original cast gets to shine through just as brightly as the new comers. Honestly, Jennifer Lawrence only serves to impress more and more as Katniss. She strengthens the character in this film and the added moments of post traumatic stress in the film only serve to give her more time to display the character in displays of raw emotion. Elizabeth Banks actually has more time in this film to portray Effie as more than just a social climber and example of the ample wealth in the capital, she gets to display her love for her tributes and the time she's had with them. Woody Harrelson has the moments of shining in this film over the last. Having him capable of openly working with the characters prior to their plight instead of spending part of the film as the comic relief. Sadly, Haymitch has his ""Origin"" story cut from the film as Katniss learns it in the novel. Perhaps it will be used in the next films as Mockingjay is being cut into two separate films, I would love it used as an explanation used for Haymitch's motivations. I was most impressed by the use of Josh Hutcherson's actions as Peeta. He brings a certain charm and realism to the character that I truly believe no one else could. He serves as a softer influence to Katniss than Liam Hemsworth's Gale. This is not to be confused, gone are the days of the helpless Peeta, he has his shining moments during the action sequences of being able to take care of himself and partially be a leader. The moments between Katniss and Peeta feel more real and less forced than the last film which is always an improvement. Overall, regardless of the fantastic story, the actors both new and Old are what brought this film full circle.

Acting aside the film is obviously improved by the much larger focus on budget and special effect. As the story calls for multiple special effects shots, I felt as a frequent movie goer, that the effects in this are very much improved from the lackadaisical glossy looks of the first. SFX buildings look sharp and real and even the creature effects are strong. The arena itself is fantastical and almost exactly as I had pictured it in my mind from the book. Overall the nearly doubled budget obviously did everything to improve the films overall quality. I can't honestly explain how good it is without explaining that despite a few moments of missing out on the subtle differences in the novel. These are smaller moments that were surprising improved by boltering moments of rebellion and strengthening of sequences in the movie. I've never seen a movie attempt to out do the book as well as I did here.

6013853,5,B00FL31UF0,"This movie is incredible. Two and a half hours fly by and keep you at the edge of you seat. I haven't read the books so I can't speak to how faithful it is or anything like that. I enjoyed the first movie and I thought I might as well see this one and I am so happy that I did. Catching Fire blows the first movie away. The acting is phenomenal headlined by Jennifer Lawrence - she captures a very conflicted, and strong heroine convincing performance. Phillip Seymour Hoffman is a great games-master and played a convincing role so much so I didn't really anticipate the big twist. Catching Fire has a good mix of intrigue, action, and emotion. It is a rare sequel which eclipses the original, but with that cast and story up on the big screen it wasn't even really a contest. Anyone who like the Hunger Games series, or just wants to see a good fun movie should go and see this film.",1385337600,2,885,4.273809523809524
6013854,5,B00FL31UF0,"There is an unsettling trend that has festered its way into Hollywood. I guess you could say it has been going on for years, but this is a little different. An author writes a trilogy (or more) of books geared toward young adults, they become popular and then Hollywood milks the public dry with movies that have no ending until they actually make the final movie; which could be delayed longer and longer, depending upon how much milking takes place. ""Harry Potter"" was the poster child for this trend and that was followed by the ""Twilight"" series, both of which split their final books into two movies for more milking.

I call this an unsettling trend because often what happens is bad film-making; movies with no payoff, stories that are interrupted for months or years until they film and release the next chapter, movies that their entire purpose for existence is a side-story and finally, payoff after 4,5, or 7 movies that makes you realize that 4,5 or 7 movies was really unnecessary. I say this because ""The Hunger Games"" is one of those franchises' of films and you should be fully aware of these downsides that I just listed.

Fortunately for ""Hunger Games"", it is spectacular film-making. Most importantly though, it is gifted with an amazing actress that effortlessly achieves the one thing that I think is the greatest asset that any movie can; empathy. Katniss Everdeen is an unwilling and sympathetic anti-hero and if you as an audience member don't feel the emotions that she is going through or are moving in your seat as she runs, dives and survives, you may need to check your pulse.

""Catching Fire"" is more than the action movie that you would expect. It is brilliantly thought-provoking. Each character is drawn to complexity with great thought and performed with vigor by great actors. When Woody Harrelson's character Haymitch tells Katniss that the upcoming exercise is to find allies, the message is clear to her and to you the audience. From that point on, you the audience member and Katniss Everdeen are one in the same. You are studying the characters and your heart is racing when the events begin to unfold. Who does she trust? Who do you trust?

You'd have to have been in a Turkish prison not to know that ""Catching Fire"" is the middle book of a three-book series and the second of a four-movie series. Therefore, despite its qualities, the movie builds you to a boiling point, the screen drops to black and on the screen comes the crackling burning mockingjay icon, signifying credits and a wink to you that you'll have to wait until November 2014 for part 1 of the rest of the story and November 2015 for the concluding film. Thanks for your cash! See you then! Hope you live that long!

On the good side, rather than make you mad, the movie achieves its desired goal and lights an appropriate fire in your gut. I have already drawn three 'X''s on my living room wall. When I get approximately 365 of them, I can see the next movie.",1385337600,4,2971,4.662213740458015

6013859,5,B00FL31UF0,"This takes up where the original Hunger Games left off. At the end of the last Games, Catniss thumbed her nose at the sadistic power structure - something that President Snow took in a very personal way. That act of defiance (it looked more like survival at the time, but became a symbol of defiance) ignited something in the vast underclass, something that Snow needs to extinguish at any cost ...

The first movie came across as teen power fantasy, thinly coated with chaste romance. Personalities get stronger in this one, like the quiet bravery of Catniss's sister, in her determination to support Caniss. Even the populace takes on a personality - wronged, hurt, looking for something better, and so bad off already that nothing can be worse. Effie, that outrageously costumed media figure, best known for being well known (sound familiar?) sees something too, in her pitiful attempts to ride Catniss's coat-tails. Her neediness becomes palpable in the ""We're a team, right?"" moments. Even Snow's grand-daughter, a ten-ish girl innocently following pop trends, takes on a deeper meaning when Catniss is the trend.

Saying more would say too much, but there's something much bigger and deeper under way, something that doesn't become apparent until late in the story. It's doesn't give anything away to say that Catniss prevails, and on her own terms, and in a way that makes a sequel not just inevitable but necessary. I'm looking forward to it already.

6013860,4,B00FL31UF0,"If Katniss thought that her nightmare was over, she learns that she was dead wrong in Catching Fire.

As it begins, we find her suffering from PTSD, with her best pal verging on boyfriend Gale, who cared for her mother and kid sister through her ordeal, none too happy about her connection to Peeta and the fact that the ruse they used to win the Game will need to be maintained for life for obvious reasons.  How to deal with that issue, and that for poor Peeta it wasn't an act, is unfortunately the least of her problems.  Intentionally or not, Katniss has become the face of the resistance, and President Snow feels that she has to be neutralized.

The fact that the next Game is going to be a ""Quarter Quell"", meaning a special event which occurs every twenty five years and for which the rules are altered for the occasion, gives Snow an opening.  He declares that the next reaping will consist of past victors - forcing Katniss into automatic competition as the only surviving female victor of her district.  Peeta immediately volunteers as their district's male Tribute, angling to both support Katniss and spare their mentor Haymitch from participation in one shot.  So it is that they both descend into hell again, facing other Tributes who are no novices but have also managed to outlast 23 other contestants in at least one previous Game.

The veterans will naturally have a number of brutal Career Tributes among them, but there are also a number of competitors with whom Katniss and Peeta may be able to do business.  Among the more relatively humane contestants whom they put on their potential ally shortlist are Finnick, a Twentysomething who was the Game's youngest victor in his teens; Finnick's former mentor Mags, a mute Octogenarian who nobly offered herself in place of Finnick's mentally traumatized girlfriend Annie; techno-geeks Beetee and Wiress, who won their respective games on brainpower; and Johanna, a loose cannon who seems to be around Katniss' age and isn't afraid to say exactly what she thinks about Snow and the Capitol.

Moral dilemmas abound.  Do Katniss and Peeta throw in with some folks who might have fewer skills to offer but might be less likely to stab them in the back?  What happens if and when the point comes that the Career Tributes are gone and they're dealing with inevitably having to kill other Tributes who are also fighting only to keep their loved ones from being tortured and/or killed?  We're also given a glimpse of the struggles some of the others are facing.  Particularly poignant is Finnick's effort to keep Mags with him in spite of the painfully obvious long odds of her lasting through the tournament at her age.  These are people who in some cases deserve to live as much as Katniss and Peeta.

  The build up is to long it is almost half way through the movie before there is any real action.

It isn't often that a sequel outdoes it's predecessor in nearly every way, but The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, does just that. Granted, sequels have the benefit of not having to establish the world and characters, but that's what makes Catching Fire so unique. While the world is setup, as are the core set of characters, the story still leaves so much to be explored, as well as introduce wonderful new characters.

Suzanne Collins' novel increases the size and scope of Panem as well as the dramatic events bubbling under the surface in the districts. Director Francis Lawrence steps in for Catching Fire (and the two sequels, Mockingjay Parts 1 & 2), and does an extraordinary job. The movie never feels rushed, or too slow, and takes its time to build the tension. Panem now feels huge, and more of the Capitol is explored. Coming off the success of the first film, you can clearly see that the nearly doubled budget ($140 million) was used to it's full extent (sets, costumes, visual effects, special effects).

Jennifer Lawrence is fantastic as Katniss (no surprise there) and there are a few key scenes where Lawrence allows her eyes to speak volumes of emotions. The supporting cast in this film gets a major step up as well thanks to the help of Philip Seymour Hoffman, Jeffery Wright and expanded roles for Elizabeth Banks and Donald Sutherland. Donald Sutherland in particular stands out as President Snow. Snow fumes hate and anger every time he is on screen, but Sutherland buries it and portrays it just through intense stares and devious smiles. While Hoffman's role as Plutarch Heavensbee isn't as fleshed out as much as it should have been, it's established that he's smart, cunning and strategic. Snow trusts him and that's all the power he needs.

Visually, Catching Fire is a big improvement over The Hunger Games. Threats in the arena looks significantly more real than in the original (I'm thinking of the bad CGI mutts). The CGI is much improved and the sets and visual effects are just as impressive. The new arena is beautiful (filmed on Oahu) and the threats are very real. The practical sets for the arena, as well as natural landscape give the film a real sense of danger and immerse the audience into a world that feels authentic.

As mentioned previously, the pacing is nearly perfect. Slowly building the shrouded tension in the outlining districts, amping-up the consequences for each character and demonstrating that under Snow's hate, no one is safe. By the time the film reaches the climax, the audience is gripped to their seats and reacting to each dramatic event in real time with the characters. Simply put, Catching Fire is high on the list of my favorite films for the year.

""Catching Fire"", the second film on the Hunger Games movie series proves that the wait is worth it! The movie is really loyal to the book, which is hard to find nowadays (almost half of the things that happen before the Games are deleted, but most of them aren't really important so I didn't care), but it's a great adaptation. Even some lines are exactly the same. The performances are awesome too; Jennifer shows her talent again, Josh and the rest of the cast were great too. I thought that the actors they picked for the new characters were great, you don't think ""I think he/she was the wrong person for the character"", everyone embodies their character so well!

6013866,4,B00FL31UF0,"While not perfect, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is that rarity among sequels:  it is decidedly better than the first film.  Credit for this achievement goes deservedly to the new team behind Catching Fire. Director Francis Lawrence (Water For Elephants, I Am Legend) brings a surer hand to the action and the pacing, and cinematographer Jo Willems gives the world of Hunger Games a feel of seamless reality that seemed missing from the first film.  But the biggest credit should go to the veteran (and Academy Award-winning) writers, Simon Beaufoy (Salmon Fishing in the Yemen, Slumdog Millionaire, 127 Hours and The Full Monty) and Michael Arndt (Little Miss Sunshine and Toy Story 3) who not only managed to produce a tighter and more vivid screenplay from Suzanne Collins' novel, they also managed to compensate for the principal problem with the second novel, i.e. that much of the plot device-wise was a repeat of the first novel. One of the most noticeable ways the writers dealt with this was in how they gave the actors more opportunities to give depth to their characters, so that even though the core dilemma was the same, the events mattered because we cared more about the characters.

Anyone who has read the novels already knows most of the plot as Catching Fire, like Hunger Games, follows the book on which it was based for the most part.  Note: if you haven't read the first book or seen the first movie, make sure you do at least one before seeing Catching Fire. Seriously. Background is important here and Catching Fire - quite rightly - doesn't waste a lot of time on flashbacks or lumpy exposition. For anyone who's only seen the first movie, I'm going to say very little about the plot to avoid any potential spoilers.

The film picks up things shortly after where Hunger Games ended.  Despite all odds and against all precedent, both Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson) managed to survive the 74th annual Hunger Games, games in which there is not supposed to be - and previously never had been - more than a single victor, i.e. survivor.  They return home to District 12, the poorest sector in the country of Panem, thinking that it's all over.  But just before Katniss and Peeta are to start a mandatory ""Victory Tour"" (read 'propaganda tour') of the country for the Capitol, Katniss receives an unexpected - and highly unwanted - visit from President Snow (Donald Sutherland), who is quite angry with her for upsetting the rules and breaking precedent. In defying  the Capitol - on nationwide television no less! -  Katniss has unwittingly inspired rebellion in the districts.  Snow tells Katniss that she and Peeta must continue to pretend to be desperately in love on their Victory Tour, to preserve the illusion of government compassion, with the warning that failure to do so will result in her family being killed.  And so Katniss and Peeta set out, hoping that the tour will go smoothly. But things swiftly begin to unravel, and when the government announces that the 75th Hunger Games will be something called a Quarter Quell with a new very special rule added, they find out that far from being out of danger, the Hunger Games were only the beginning of their troubles.

Without revealing anything else about the plot, I do have to say that Catching Fire really delivers with the ending, and the last shot of Jennifer Lawrence's Katniss just by itself will leave you itching for Mockingjay Part I to come out.

The acting in Catching Fire definitely gets cranked up a notch, again largely because the script gives the actors the chance to bring some depth to the characters but also because of a highly talented supporting cast. Jennifer Lawrence (Silver Linings Playbook, Winter's Bone) brings a certain subtlety to Katniss, coming across as awkward and almost reluctant to be in front of the camera at times. The thing is, this is exactly the Katniss portrayed in the books: awkward in social situations, thrust into a spotlight she never wanted, only feeling truly natural when she's bow-in-hand focused on survival, of others as well as her own. Josh Hutcherson (Bridge to Terabithia, The Kids Are All Right) remains perfect as Peeta, effortlessly inhabiting the role of the supportive and surprisingly creative nice guy whom fate continues to treat with ironic cruelty by tying him physically to Katniss but leaving her emotionally always out of reach.

As always, Woody Harrelson (Zombieland, No Country For Old Men) steals every scene he's in as Haymitch, Katniss and Peeta's slovenly and hard-drinking coach who nonetheless actually gives them very solid advice.  I swear, Harrelson can take the most ordinary lines and turn them into absolute gems simply by the way he looks at people when he delivers them. More than any other actor I know, Harrelson seems to truly enjoy himself when acting and it really comes through in his performances. Much the same can also be said of Stanley Tucci (The Devil Wears Prada, Shall We Dance) who reprises his role as Caesar Flickerman, Panem's grandly over-the-top talk show host, who in turn was one of the best things in the first film. And special notice should be given to Elizabth Banks (Pitch Perfect, The Next Three Days) whose Effie Trinket was also a stand-out in the first film because this time around the script lets Banks bring some emotional depth to her character in subtle but very effective ways.

Among the new characters that get introduced, Philip Seymour Hoffman has arguably the toughest job, walking a fine line as Plutarch Heavensbee, the new master of games who rose to his position after his predecessor in Hunger Games had an unfortunate encounter with some berries. The standout performances however are mostly among the veteran tributes from other districts. Jeffrey Wright (Boardwalk Empire) and Amanda Plummer (Pulp Fiction, The Fisher King) deliver as Beetee and Wiress, the two brainy tributes from the hi-tech District 3. Sam Claflin (The Pillars of the Earth, Snow White & the Huntsman) gives surprising depth to Finnick Odair, the seemingly perfect got-it-all-and-knows-it tribute from District 4. And Jena Malone (Sucker Punch) is awesome as Johanna Mason, the kick-ass attitude-to-the-max tribute from District 7. But personally I found the most moving performance was given by Lynn Cohen (Sex and the City) as Finnick's elderly fellow tribute, Mags. With no lines of dialogue, Cohen has to convey everything through her face and physical gestures, and she does this superbly, making you see what Katniss sees in her.

On the somewhat minus side, Liam Hemsworth (Empire State) doesn't do much as Gale - Katniss' District 12 hunting partner and ostensible love-interest - but this is less the fault of the actor than it is simply that the demands of the plot don't allow him much on-screen time. And
Donald Sutherland's President Snow never quite seems to rise much above the level of stock villain, but this too is less the fault of the actor than a reflection of the fact that the character in the books was in truth rather sketchy and never really rose above stock villain level either.

Overall, highly recommended as a better-than-expected follow-up to the first Hunger Games film and as a good solid action film in its own right.",1385078400,161,7292,4.927465362673186
6013867,2,B00FL31UF0,"Let me start this off by saying that I have not read any of The Hunger Games books.  Everything that has happened on screen during the first two in this installment is all new to me, and I have no insight into the source material.  I will also say that I did not like the first one.  It felt very...""PG-Thirteen-y"" in every sense.  I thought the story was pretty weak, I found most of the characters unlikable (save for Woody Harrelson), and the action and it's direction were just deplorable - I have no idea how it received the praise that it did.

There, I said it.

I was asked to go to this at a special early screening and said yes for two reasons - one, I felt that I owed the couple who invited us because I asked them to see Arnold's big screen comeback earlier this year (The Last Stand), which they hated.  Two, I was willing to give this series a second chance, considering there was a new director at the helm and I thought that maybe the second would be better considering the world had already been established and we didn't need much in the way of what I call 'catch-up character development'.

1.  The Cast Is...Blah

Before I rip most of the cast, I would like to point out some standout performances.  Jena Malone plays a pretty insane axe-wielding tribute and she is fantastic.  She steals every scene that she's in and is definitely the most interesting tribute in the movie (and yes, I'm including Katniss).  Philip Seymour Hoffman is also fantastic, as usual, and Stanley Tucci is also great.  The rest of the cast may as well have been wet blankets.  Jennifer Lawrence basically displays two emotions the entire film.  Watching Peeta is like staring at one of the  mannequins Kevin McAllister controlled with rope to scare away the Wet Bandits for two and a half hours, and his lack of chemistry with Jennifer Lawrence makes their romance entirely unbelievable...even when it's supposed to be real.  It's eye-roll inducing.  Most of the other tributes receive zero back story and have no personality, so when they show up on screen and take an arrow to the chest, it has absolutely no impact.  They may as well be Foot Soldiers or Putties for the nonchalance with which they are dispatched.  The emotion that should swell in moments like that just were not earned here.

2. It's Boring

I came into this movie hoping that I would see a bigger, better Games.  I mean, we've got the best of the best competing now, right?  The winning tributes, going after each other?  It's like the All Star Hunger Games.

Unfortunately, it takes about an hour and a half of ""PTSD/Let's Show You How Bad The World Is...Again"" before it gets to the games.  Once it does get to the arena, the action is basically non-existent.  It's mostly just sitting around in the jungle until something the arena throws at them happens - no hand to hand combat at all.  Aside from one battle with animals, I found this really, really boring.  By the way, most of the tributes from the last Hunger Games look like they could take most of the goons found in this sequel.  It's like sending our second tier NBA players to compete in the Olympics...oh wait...

3. It's Filler

This movie exists basically as filler between the first and eventual third movie.  It rehashes a lot of what happened in the first one, and ends with an expected cliff-hanger for the third.  I'm okay with movie cliff-hangers.  I mean, the end credits scene in Fast & Furious 6 for example left be breathless leaving the theater.  Unfortunately, this one just left me saying, ""That's it?"".  This movie is basically a two and a half hour stretch of something that's normally done within the first three minutes of a futuristic movie via voice over.

Even worse, I don't really care what happens to any of these characters, save for Johanna.  Why should I come back for the next movie?

4. Forced Jokes/Bad Writing

The jokes...oh, the jokes.  There are some really forced, very poorly executed attempts at humor in this movie.  A few jokes here and there made me chuckle - there's a fantastic elevator scene when we're introduced to Jena Malone that is great - but most fall very, very flat.  When one character is coming back from the brink of death, another character exclaims, ""You were dead!  Your heart stopped beating!""...""Well, it's working now."" (audience uproars with laughter).  Maybe I just don't get the type of humor that they were shooting for here, but most of the time, the audience was laughing with things and I couldn't help but sit there wondering what the hell I had just missed.  I didn't expect this movie to be filled with knee-slappers, but I expected the writing to be a bit better than it was.

5. The ""Columbiana"" Ending

I have a problem with what I call, The ""Columbiana"" Ending.  It's a plan by a character that would only work if the character that it's set up for made that odd one in a million choice.  It would be like putting a pack of rabid dogs with a taste for flesh into a van in a parking garage with about fifty cars and hoping that the bad guy not only chooses to drive away from the scene, but also picks that specific van.

This story 'ends' with one of those Columbiana choices, and it just doesn't work...at all.  There's a whole lot of explaining to do.  I'm okay with suspending belief to get the most out of a movie, but this one just asks me to be dumb.

Needless to say, I did not like this movie.  If I had to pick a few good things out, I'd say that it looks pretty, that some of the cast members (namely Jena Malone) shine, and I'm really glad the 'shaky-cam' is absent from the first movie (the director is much more mature when shooting action).  However, when this series is over, I will probably look back at it the same way that I look at series like Star Wars - I guess I don't 'get it'.  There's nothing that stands out here - the story is mediocre, the acting is merely serviceable, and writing is pretty bad, and the action is boring.  It certainly doesn't seem to deserve the 90% it's got on Rotten Tomatoes right now.  Sometimes I think that critics are afraid to give movies like this an honest score, or they're too connected to the source material.

I'm going to go out on a limb and say that if you liked the first one, you'll like this one.  If you didn't, steer clear.

Final Score: 2/5",1385078400,22,6321,4.47419072615923
6013868,5,B00FL31UF0,"Admit it. Some of you have been waiting for this one. I know I have. If you saw ""The Hunger Games,"" you will remember that in this battle to the death, our two representatives from District 12 had to pretend to be in love in order to get sponsors to provide some much-needed supplies necessary for their survival (and victory). Now the Panem government wants to see them marry to prove that it wasn't a hoax.

The problem is, The Capitol senses a rebellion brewing and thinks our heroine may be the inspiration, so they announce The Quarter Quell which will pit contestants drawn from previous winners. She is certain to have her name drawn as she is the only female winner from District 12 in the past quarter century. So much for that ""lifetime of plenty"" she was promised.

Some of these are returnees from the first episode:
  * Jennifer Lawrence (Oscar for ""Silver Linings Playbook"") is back as Katniss, the role model I wish tweens would emulate: Her first instinct always is to help; she is genuine; she's smart; and she's resourceful. AND she has become the unwitting symbol of rebellion in Panem.
  * Josh Hutcherson (""Red Dawn"") is Peeta, her partner, and, to make their story look real, her fiance. This guy is steadfast, strong and soooo much in love with her....
  * Liam Hemsworth (""The Last Song"")  is Gale, her first love, still working in the mine back in District 12, taking care of her mother and sister and trying to ignore the publicity about Katniss and Peeta's pending nuptials.
  * Sam Claflin (""Snow White and the Huntsman"") is Finnick, one of the other contestants. Is he an ally they can trust or an enemy who will stab them in the back?
  * Lenny Kravitz (""Precious"") is the wonderful Cinna, the designer who created the marvelous dress that launched Katniss as the Girl on Fire. This year's design is even more provocative. Wait until you see it!
  * Donald Sutherland (""The Hunger Games"") returns as President Snow, walking a fine line between assassinating Katniss outright (which might inflame the rebels) and trying to outwit her (which he's fairly confident he can do).
  * Stanley Tucci (""Jack the Giant Slayer"") once again is the perfect television host: smarmy, overly enthusiastic and completely despicable.
  * Elizabeth Banks (""Pitch Perfect"") This time her Effie Trinket seems to have grown a heart. Whew!
  *  Woody Harrelson (""Seven Psychopaths"") still is Haymitch (and he still drinks too much). He's the only former winner of the Hunger Games from District 12 still living and as such, serves as a mentor for our two contestants.

This is a battle of wits, guts and gumption. It is PG-13 because of the grisly idea behind the games, although we rarely see blood. There is a sprinkle of profanity but it is warranted when used. We mostly see resourceful (and loyal) young adults in a battle for their lives. They remind each other, ""Remember who the enemy is.""

This is exciting, involving and we have a LOT of people to root for. I haven't named all the principal characters in this 146-minute epic, but I must warn you, there are no dull spots when you can take a quick break, so do NOT drink too many liquids!

I'm looking forward to the third (and fourth) episodes, ""Mockingjay."" Suzanne Collins' final book in this trilogy has been split into two $creenplay$. I guess my set from Amazon will total 4 DVDs.",1385078400,23,3354,4.7020547945205475
6013869,5,B00FL31UF0,"Wow. Just, wow. I went to see Catching Fire last night after a year and a half long wait and I can honestly say, it was 100% worth it. Please go see this movie. You will not be disappointed. The director, Francis Lawrence, did a fantastic job expanding the world of Panem while keeping true to the tone set by the first movie. The first half of the movie, the victory tour and events leading up to the Quarter Quell, may feel a little bit rushed, but all the important details are there. The arena is colossal, so much better on screen than in my mind. The music, which I paid particular attention to since I loved the first film's score, was moving and fit perfectly in every scene. For book fans, there are a few minor details left out, but the amount of content taken directly from the book is amazing. Much of the dialogue (although not all) is taken straight from the book, word-for-word. This was probably my favorite part of the whole movie. And I need not add that the casting was phenomenal (but it was). Anyway, enough babbling. In conclusion, if you are a fan of the Hunger Games in any way, shape, or form, go see this movie. If you like a thrilling adventure fraught with unexpected surprises, humorous exchanges, and scenes that move you, go see this movie.",1385078400,483,1271,4.435897435897436
6013870,5,B00FL31UF0,This movie is the best sequel since Star Wars.  They have incorporated they details from the first book to the second beautifully.  It flows.

This movie felt like a completion of my vision while reading the book.  Nothing has been left out.  Five stars.....,1385078400,2,393,4.375
6013871,5,B00FL31UF0,"After more than a year and a half, the seemingly endless wait has finally come to an end.  The Hunger Games sequel, Catching Fire, is here.  If anticipation could literally kill people, this film would have whipped out tens of millions - not dissimilar from a Harry Potter or Twilight sequel.  Regardless, the difference between The Hunger Games and Harry Potter or Twilight is the target audience of The Hunger Games is limitless.  While the first film nearly broke the $700 million barrier worldwide, this franchise has picked up so much momentum that there shouldn't be any stopping it, right?  Well, it's not like we aren't all aware of the dreaded ""curse of the sequel,"" but rest assured Hunger Games fans - there's nothing to fear here.

The Hunger Games director, Gary Ross, steps aside for the sequel as the reigns fall on the shoulders of highly-acclaimed music video and occasional film director, Francis Lawrence (Water for Elephants, I Am Legend).  Catching Fire, based on the novel sequel of the same name by Suzanne Collins, picks up in the aftermath of the Hunger Games victory by Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) and Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson).  Back in District 12, the pair attempts to reclaim their lives of normalcy while still dealing with the emotional backlash of being forced to murder people for the benefit of entertaining a legion of disassociated onlookers.

With the residents of the twelve districts becoming more and more agitated and on the verge of a revolution, President Snow places the blame on the actions of Katniss and her refusal to kill Peeta.  Snow instructs her to sell her sham of a love affair with Peeta in order to unite the people and threatens her family and friends if she continues to defy the Capitol - evident in a kiss she shares with her close friend, Gale Hawthorne (Liam Hemsworth).  In the meantime, Katniss and Peeta go on tour to each district to pay tribute to their fallen Hunger Games opponents, including an emotional tribute to Rue - which only intensifies the rebellion.  Snow takes notice and sends in Peacekeeper soldiers to execute members of the forming resistance.

As the violent acts of the Peacekeepers intensifies, so does Snow's intent to murder Katniss.  However, Snow's new adviser, Plutarch Heavensbee (Philip Seymour Hoffman), hatches a plan to evoke the Third Quarter Quell on the 75th Anniversary of the Hunger Games.  Instead of drafting new competitors for this anniversary contest, the lottery includes only former Hunger Games victors from each district, including Katniss, and Peeta.  As the only female victor of District 12, Katniss must once again take arms in the Hunger Games, and is instantly forced to leave for the capitol - escorted by Haymitch Abernathy (Woody Harrelson) and Effie Trinket (Elizabeth Banks).  On a side note, Banks' costumes are even more elaborately outlandish in this film than the last.  Still, just amazing costume designs all around.

Let me first say that I don't read a whole lot of fiction (often spending my time watching it, instead), so the criticism coming from me are only in regards to the film itself.  With that being said, there's nearly nothing to criticize about this film anyway.  Honestly, after watching nearly half of this film, I was fully prepared to hammer this film for being nothing more than a slight reimaging of the first film.  After watching the first film prior to watching the sequel, both films progress almost verbatim.  The film begins with Katniss and Gale in the restricted zone hunting, followed by a slow progression of re-introducing characters from the previous film.  As the story goes on, you'll notice slight variations from scenes in the first film when she arrives to the Capitol.  Once more, Katniss and Peeta are paraded around (with combustible outfits), go through the interview process with Caesar Flickerman (Stanley Tucci), and begin the same old training process.  Only, instead of shooting an apple out of pig's mouth, Katniss is forced to be more creative (since this time they've installed a force field).

There are plenty of new characters introduced as opponents in the Hunger Games, including Gloss (Alan Ritchson), Johanna Mason (Jena Malone), Beetee (Jeffrey Wright), Mags (Lynn Cohen), and the undeniably charming Claudius Templesmith (Toby Jones).  Initially, you're led to believe this will be just another round of one-on-one violence as in the first film - but it's not.  These games are so much more evolved and clever in comparison to the last film.  Obviously, the battle sequences are major spoilers, so there's no need to discuss them in too much detail here other than to say the actual Hunger Games themselves make this movie into an absolute pleasure to watch.  For the individual characters themselves, the other 23 competitors are not the prominent threat anymore.  This time around, the unpredictability of their environment will have you zoned into this flick to the extent that you'll feel like you're sitting right next to these characters and sharing their experiences with them as they occur.

Obviously, some new characters have more screen time than others, but the screen time is largely devoted to Jennifer Lawrence and her emotional journey - a role in which Lawrence visibly excels.  This film starts out with her character still recovering from the traumatizing events of her Hunger Games experience.  From there, all the way to final moments of this sequel, Katniss is being slowly emotionally drained.  The climax of this film is momentary build-up of her character saying enough is enough.  She's surrounded by death and the idea that she's a symbol of hope (a theme is constantly mention over the course of the film), and frankly, that's bound to take its toll on anyone.  At the same time, she's half-heartedly being courted by two different male suitors, one of which is her close friend (Gale) and the other she's supposed to marry for the good of ""the people.""  And, while this romantic triangle is mildly entertaining, I like the fact that it's not at the forefront.  To be honest, the chemistry between Lawrence, Hemsworth, and Hutcherson isn't all that believable in the first place.

Overall, The Hunger Games: Catching Fire is a film that starts off slowly but eventually puts a stranglehold on your attention, making it one of the best sequels in recent memory.  For those worrying about it not living upto  the first film, rest assured:  the sequel is better than its predecessor.  You can't say that very often, yet in this case the sequel is far superior in nearly every facet of storytelling, acting, production, and design.  If I had to generate a guess, Catching Fire will impress moviegoers so much that it will land itself in a club with The Empire Strikes Back, The Godfather II, and Terminator 2: Judgment Day as one of the best sequels ever made.  The thematic elements alone, discussing events that run rampant on the world today, including politics, revolution, media bias, wealth vs. poverty, and powerful people doing anything to maintain their power, all contribute to the success and progression of this story.  By now, you're likely aware the two part final chapter, Mockingjay Part 1 & 2, are on their way, and the final scenes of Catching Fire provide a cliffhanger that have already made Mockingjay one of the most anticipated sequels of both 2014 and 2015.

Also, if you happen to listen to modern music, you should definitely check out the Catching Fire soundtrack.  You won't be disappointed.

6013873,5,B00FL31UF0,"As an avid reader of The Hunger Games Trilogy, and somebody who didn't care much for the first movie, I was wary about going to see Catching Fire. Well. I was wrong. All of the problems with the first film--the pacing, the contrived shaky cam, the fear of treading on the book's themes--have all been addressed in this film.

From beginning to end, Catching Fire never lets up, and I'm grateful for that. It doesn't waste time cuing the audience into unnecessary details (something I think the first movie tried and failed to do). Rather, it shows the audience a world on the brink of war, a world of real fear and danger, of ideology and seemingly unbreakable power apparatuses. And it does so in brisk, sweeping views of Panem. Views of the tormented landscape and the equally devastated peoples. Of course, all of this is juxtaposed quite well with the foppishness of the Capitol. The acting, and writing, too, are both spot on. Gone are the head-scratch-inducing lines from the last film. In their place, we have sharp, well-delivered dialogue, some of which even displays a humor and lightness that helps remove us from the burdens of the conflict. In a movie with a such a disturbing setting, that can be rather hard to do. Thankfully, these lines are delivered at the right time and without pretension.

(Another note on the acting and direction: thankfully, they got Peeta right this time. He's not the troublesome, wobbly character the first movie presented him as. Rather, he now acts as a perfect double for Katniss. He saves her as she saves him.)

As to sound, the music is as beautiful and evocative as it was in the first film. We still get the folksome, rambling tones of Appalachia alongside the booming, empyrean drumbeats associated with the Capitol. One small touch that I appreciated was the constant sound of flies and insects buzzing during the Game scenes. It really drew me into the feel and texture of a humid, tropical forest.

I think one of my biggest gripes with The Hunger Games was the shaky cam. It felt contrived and added very little to the movie, other than headaches and vertigo. This time around, we get a steady camera that lets us take in and explore Katniss' world and the atrocities within it. It still focuses the action on Katniss, but we get to see how she interacts with the environment in a much more appealing way...mostly because we can actually see the environment now.

Finally, Catching Fire drives home the book's themes without flinching. It doesn't spoon feed the dangers of treating people as means to an end or of the shallowness of television and advertising. Rather, it shows us the effects of these things. They are dangerous, and they affect everybody, whether we participate in them or not. It also reveals the need to sacrifice and give of oneself (burn like a phoenix, or in this case, a mockingjay) if one wants to change things, to renew them, to save them.",1384992000,3,2923,4.712328767123288
