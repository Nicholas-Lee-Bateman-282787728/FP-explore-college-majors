8191388,1,B000PHVY9E,"This slasher movie is filmed in Austria with an Austrian cast speaking English dialogue with Austrian inflections.  The acting is bad, the scenery is gorgeous, and the movie is one of those which is so bizarrely awful that it is weirdly entertaining.  The girls are pleasingly jiggly even if they can't act.",1250380800,2,307,4.884615384615385
