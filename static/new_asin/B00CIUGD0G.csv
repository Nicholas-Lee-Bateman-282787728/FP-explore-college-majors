5723004,5,B00CIUGD0G,"""Nobody Dies"" That is what James Harris (David Dastmalchian) tells the group of 4 other applicants when he discovers that in order to win a job at the mysterious ""Cacharais Corporation"" they must murder each other until only one remains. These are the brutal circumstances put forth by ""The Employer."" Will they try to make it out together alive. Or will their own fragile natures ensure their demise. Through flashback we see each of the characters interviews with the mysterious Employer (Malcolm MacDowell) here we see their strengths, but more importantly their weakness as we start to guess the order in which they will die. In addition to everyman James there is the seemingly sweet and nave Sandra (Paige Howard), the stylish grad student Billie (Katerina Mikailenko) the fast talking huckster Keith (Michael DeLorenzo) and the gentle giant Mike (Matthew Willig) he was ample brains in addition to brawn. After James implores them to not kill each other tensions arise and insecurity about survival takes over. Twists abound and I was left guessing until the very end. Add in a cameo from Billy Zane and you have a great thriller that utilizes character development and suspense not cheap gore. It reminded me of ""Die Hard"" in the way that it was the characters own wits and faults, not super human powers that propelled the action. I would definitely recommend this well-acted thriller to not just horror and suspense fans, but any fan of well-crafted independent cinema!",1370476800,17,1479,5.016260162601626

5723031,2,B00CIUGD0G,"Five job applicants wake up in a locked vault.  There are four key-code locks on the door.  Every time one applicant dies they are given a combination to one of the locks.  When four applicants are dead the fifth can walk out of the vault and gets the job of a lifetime.

This is pretty well acted and directed but the script is so dumb the movie never really works.  For instance, the job applicants are given a cell phone that is programmed to allow 5 outgoing calls and they can call anyone but the police.  They use all of the calls without giving anyone any information such as 1) the fact that they've been kidnapped 2) the company behind the kidnapping 3) the names of the other people in the vault with them.  The screenwriter probably shouldn't have introduced the idea of the outgoing calls at all if the characters were going to be such idiots making them.

The filmmakers probably think they are making some sort of statement about the cutthroat nature of corporate culture but the fact is being able to kill people with your bare hands really isn't a skill that is very useful in the business world.  If these people were applying for a job as killers for hire then maybe the whole thing would make more sense but how does any of this show how well they would perform in a business context?  And if this is your normal job hiring practice what's to stop these employees from killing each other when disagreements arise or a new promotion is available?

Malcolm McDowell makes way too much crap like this but one thing that can be said about him is that he's reliably good regardless of the quality of the material--but he isn't given enough to do here to really justify his prominent placement on the video cover.  The actors who are locked in the vault are all fine but there's nobody you will be rooting for--which makes the whole thing pretty pointless.",1386633600,2,1869,4.497041420118343

5723038,2,B00CIUGD0G,"Ok, first, the opening was somewhat confusing. Then it started to get better for about 4 minutes then it started going down hill. The dialogue was horrible. It was as if the writers were on a tight schedule to come up with something that kinda flowed together. The plot was poor. Not really sure why these people started going off on each other. Also not sure how the first guy survived the beating to be able to turn the tables on Mathew Willig. After he gets offed in a most unbelievable way, I decided NOT to waste any more time and get to the end. Of course, the ending turns out to be the one that I would not have guessed at first. The underdog survives. He only survives because he is weak. BUT he suddenly finds the guts to kill some nobody that walks in towards the end. He has a gun and does not think of killing ""the employer"", he shoots a nobody that wasn't threatening his safety. o_O

5723043,5,B00CIUGD0G,"I'm a big fan of independent film because it takes a lot more creativity, skill and talent to make a great film when you DON'T have MILLIONS of dollars in funding.  It just doesn't make sense to compare this film to a big budget Hollywood movie - you either appreciate the craft of filmmaking or you prefer to be manipulated by cheap effects and expensive soundtracks.

I saw this at the Illinois Independent Film festival last year. The acting is stellar and I really liked the writing - not that the storyline is original, because I don't think there are ANY truly original stories - but because of the detailed character development, exciting plot twists, intelligent, multi-dimensional dialogue and clever wit - that's what makes a great script.  In my opinion, this would be a great screener for a indy film club, a movie night and even for a film class discussion.

To break up the cell action, there are flashbacks to their interviews and abductions. They are all asked the same question, ""Is there anything you wouldn't do for this company?""

5723049,3,B00CIUGD0G,"Reviewers C.A. and Terry said it best: movies like ""Exam"", ""Elevator"", and ""Cube"" (and many others of this ilk) have done this story line better.

Better in what way?, you might ask.

Well, for one thing, ""The Employer"" is missing zazz. That is, it lacks tension. One, quite large, example of this: one by one, each character tells us how they came to be kidnapped and then later in the film, we see flashbacks depicting the kidnappings in the exact manner told to us by each character earlier in the film. During one of these flashback scenes, I found myself thinking, 'Yeah, yeah, I already know how this goes down so move the scene along already.'

Also, the plot is a rather formulaic one, altogether lacking in originality, innovation, or uniqueness. The acting is meh at best, save for McDowell who is a veteran actor and seems to have had a ball playing this role.

Finally, although some background information about the ""evil corporation"" behind the nefarious interview process is repeated several times throughout the film, the information shared is so thin and vague as to make the corporation seem almost cartoonishly one dimensional and, thereby, not particularly believable.

I will say that I found the movie's, albeit heavy-handed, message about the corporate world an interesting one.

So, if it's a lazy Sunday afternoon and you're in the mood for a flick that won't engage your brain terribly but will still entertain, ""The Employer"" fits that bill perfectly.",1372464000,2,1478,4.939516129032258

89 min
Thriller
June 7, 2013
USA
Director: Frank Merle
Writer: Frank Merle
Stars: Malcolm McDowell, David Dastmalchian, Paige Howard

""The Employer"" is not a new story concept in surviving in a group influenced by outside forces, but a slight twist.  Five candidates are vying for the same job with a high-powered corporation. They are informed they will be tested, only to find themselves trapped in a room fighting for survival, as only one candidate will get the job.  In fact tell me it doesn't sound a lot like ""Exam"".  In EXAM eight people try for a highly sought-after JOB.  They are locked up together in a room and given one hour to finish their exam. The exam is a blank piece of paper so they reflect on what they were told and the eight candidates soon realize their only competition isn't the exam, but each other and a fight to the death. There are at least a half dozen movies out there using roughly the same premise of a group of people either trying to gain a job or some other item or they are trapped together in unusual circumstances.  The cast including Malcolm McDowell and Billy Zane in this newest version is quite good in acting, camara work, sets and effects, directing, and music.  Worth at least a rental, but before you decide to buy be sure to catch at least some of the others.  I enjoyed this movie and am surprised at the negative votes just because I pointed out the story isn't new.  I bought the Amazon Digital version. I want to thank Jack K. for pointing out a couple more to me that I hadn't seen (The Killing Room and The Chaos Experiment).
