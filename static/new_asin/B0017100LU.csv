3166288,5,B0017100LU,"RvB is a great web based show now viewable on DVD. Every character is funny, and I love how the show uses the Halo series in a very creative way.",1221696000,,145,3.8666666666666667
3166289,4,B0017100LU,"Red vs. Blue is, arguably, the most popular example of what is called 'machinima'. Machinima is based around the notion that modern computer games have graphics that even just a few years ago you'd need a computer the size a house to render in real-time, so by just recording a game session and getting the players to 'act out' scenes with their characters, accompanied by a voiceover track, you can create your very own movies. Naturally, most of them suck, gamers generally having the patience of a hypersensitive gnat suffering from Tourettes and not being able to agree on anything. Plus a lot of these movies involve guys running around shooting one another on Counter-Strike maps whilst overusing the phrases ""Pwned!"" and ""LOL!"" until you want to actively kill yourself. Or, y'know, just go do something else, suicide is probably a rather extreme and unnecessary action to take in that situation.

Anyway, Red vs. Blue is one of the exceptions. Created using the Halo multiplayer mode, it features two teams (you can take a wild guess at their colours and names) guarding their bases at opposite ends of a box canyon. Occasionally it is suggested that they should be trying to kill one another and capture the opposing team's flag, but the lack of any logical rationale why they should do this, combined with innate laziness, means instead they stand around most of the time making jokes about girls and vaguely insinuating the other characters are gay whilst moaning about not getting any reinforcements. It's a bit like a Kevin Smith-scripted version of Waiting for Godot but done as a Seinfeld episode. With guns.

Obviously it would be extremely dull if this is all that happened for 100 episodes (relax, they're only 5-10 minutes long each), so the arrival of two rookies, the accidental death of one of the soldiers, the inadvertant capture of the Blue Team's flag and the deployment of special forces operatives to the canyon sparks off an incredibly convoluted storyline that eventually incorporates sentient killer tanks, Spanish-talking robots, aliens, body-hopping AIs and time travel (in an amusing visual joke, characters who travel into the future are converted into the Halo 2 game engine, whilst those who travel into the past end up as characters in the ancient FPS Marathon, Bungie's precursor to the Halo trilogy). The booming success of the series means that the rough-quality audio from the first episodes is rapidly spruced up, excellent custom-made music is introduced and the whole thing becomes more polished. The humour remains the same throughout and is based around the characters: the tough-talking Sarge, who favours ludicrously over-complicated plots in the vain hope that his nemesis Grif will be killed in action; the relatively sensible but easily-annoyed Church who can't shoot straight for love nor money; the psychotic operative Tex; Sheila the sentient tank; and Caboose, the deranged Blue rookie who goes through most of the series operating on another plane of reality to the others and is the character most people either love or absolutely loathe (he's the Kramer of this series, then). The humour is pitched somewhere around the level of, say, South Park. Well, maybe a bit higher than that with lots of riffs on SF movies and games. Actually, it's a bit difficult to describe.

Some episodes are exceptionally funny, such as a time travel odyssey which explains most of the series' plot holes, or the episode which is set inside an actual Halo deathmatch and leaves the two characters present in a state of near-mental collapse at the level of insanity on display (""I have captured the flag! Behold its radiant countenance! I am as a god!""). A few miss the mark, but given how long this thing is (it would take you nine hours to watch the whole thing from start to finish) it's surprising how few dull instalments there are. The series became a huge success, and within a year of its launch it was estimated that there were up to 1 million people downloading each new episode. Several of the game characters made cameo appearances in Halo 3 as well.

Overall, very funny and worth watching. A bit rough around the edges in places, especially when compared to the sequel series, Reconstruction, but great entertainment.",1220745600,29,4268,4.973389355742297

3166291,5,B0017100LU,"The newest form of entertainment these days can be found on the internet. People are posting their own work in forms of fake movie trailers, independent animation and crazy antics that the world is eating up with a spoon. What stands out the most next to Dramatic Chipmunk and Laughing Baby is the Machinima series of 'Red VS. Blue: The Blood Gultch Chronicles'.

I don't know how this idea came about, but out of no where a bunch of guys and girls decided to take the popular game of Halo and through a recently created style of animation called Machinima turned this video game into a 5 season, 100 episode comedic phenomenon. It is the story of two teams the Red Team composed of a leader starting to lose it a brown-noser a wise guy a mechanical officer that can only speak spanish and rookie whose name hysterically is Donut. Who are they up against you ask? The Blue team composed of an easily aggrevated hot head, a cluless associate a free lance female assasin a talking tank named Sheila and a total moron that is too dumb not to love. What is the objective of both sides....THEY DON'T KNOW!!!

Each episode is comedic gold filled with sarcasm, stupid jokes and outbursts that make you want to constantly rewind and watch again. After being such a success on the internet all 5 seasons are now in this box set filled with amazing special features. It is the first of it's kind and will hopefully gain a lot in the world of animation. It obviously gained some ground already as a brand new series is already on the internet (Red VS. Blue: Reconstruction). So far it may be a little different, but so far so good.",1218758400,,1620,4.488135593220339

3166305,2,B0017100LU,I purchased the box set and reconstruction. the 3rd season and 5th season disk and reconstruction would not play in my dvd player or eather of my two computers. what would happen is the movie on the 3 disks would stop playing about half way threw and start pixelateing and finaly stop playing all together. so i sent it back to Amazon and they sent me a new box set and reconstruction. the same thing happened again where the 3rd 5th and reconstruction disks wouldn't play. im wondering if its a common defect. while i love red vs blue and really want the box set i think there might be a common problem with the way they pressed the disks and while i want to send this box set back and replace it im not sure that the ones i buy will be any better.,1252800000,,749,4.172413793103448

3400802,2,B0017100LU,I purchased the box set and reconstruction. the 3rd season and 5th season disk and reconstruction would not play in my dvd player or eather of my two computers. what would happen is the movie on the 3 disks would stop playing about half way threw and start pixelateing and finaly stop playing all together. so i sent it back to Amazon and they sent me a new box set and reconstruction. the same thing happened again where the 3rd 5th and reconstruction disks wouldn't play. im wondering if its a common defect. while i love red vs blue and really want the box set i think there might be a common problem with the way they pressed the disks and while i want to send this box set back and replace it im not sure that the ones i buy will be any better.,1252800000,,749,4.172413793103448

3400804,4,B0017100LU,"Red vs. Blue is one of the funniest web shows I've ever seen. The rest of the Rooster Teeth shows are good as well. The only downfall for this video series is the extreme widescreen image that appears on any screen. It would have been nice to see it formatted for normal screens, but otherwise its a great way to waste time!",1251244800,2,324,4.241935483870968

It is a great buy if you like the halo games although it has no relation apart from being made on the games. It has a lot of south park style comedy included. What makes this that bit better is that all the extra features on each season and the bonus disc is all unseen footage that you probably won't find online. So if you don't buy this you are missing out.,1271376000,,456,4.0777777777777775
