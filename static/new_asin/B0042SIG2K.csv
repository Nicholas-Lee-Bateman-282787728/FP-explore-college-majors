8413905,5,B0042SIG2K,"My wife and I watched this excellent series on BBC 2 when we were living in London for a couple of years recently.  It's absolutely superb.  Essential viewing for anyone with an even passing interest in the British Isles (lots of Irish stuff too).  Makes you want to get up and drive, or now fly - over there and check out the amazing ports, cliffs and islands.  We will be buying this set as soon as it is available.",1301529600,,417,4.2405063291139244
