8709030,4,B00V42YRGG,"Shin Mazinger Z-Hen, or as it is known here, Mazinger Edition Z: The Impact, is the latest animated take on Go Nagai's hugely influential super robot tale from the 70's which pioneered the concept of heroes piloting giant mecha. This new iteration is directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa, known for similar works like G Gundam, Giant Robo, and another retelling of Mazinger Z's direct predecessor, Tetsujin-28

Imagawa draws more directly from Nagai's manga than the original anime, meaning there is more violence and sexual content. He also mines characters from other Nagai works instead of sticking purely to Mazinger canon. His signature style also ramps up the melodrama and exaggerates the action. The end result is a very theatrical show with several unexpected twists and turns that keep even the most well-versed fan on their toes. This is not a simple remake but a complete re-imagining of the source material while at the same time making great use of what came before. Like Giant Robo was to Mitsuteru Yokoyama's work, this series is one big homage to Go Nagai's career as a mangaka.

It's not perfect however, like many other Imagawa works it suffers from pacing issues. Many episodes drag on the same plot points endlessly and repetitively, making the show feel like it could have been half as long if it were more tightly edited. The experimental ""in medias res"" first episode is also pointless and can be skipped entirely. The ending of the series is also very dissatisfying without a Great Mazinger story to follow it, fans of the franchise will know what that means without spoiling it for anyone else.

Despite those issues it's an absolute must have for mecha fans, especially those who love old-school super robots. The animation is not always perfect, but it's sharp and stylish with it's 70's designs. Mazinger Edition Z is a trip back to a time where anime heroes came hot-blooded and every problem could be solved with a well-placed rocket punch. PILDER ON! MAZIN... GO!",1494633600,3,1987,4.925373134328358

8709033,5,B00V42YRGG,"Director Yasuhiro Imagawa (Giant Robo, G Gundam) has a real knack for taking classic mecha shows and breathing new life into them.  This re-imagining of Mazinger Z is no exception. The story goes deeper, the characters have a lot more depth, and the action is a whole lot of fun.  If you like Go Nagai's other works, definitely keep an eye out for lots of clever nods to other many of his other works too.  A must have for fans of mecha anime!",1445558400,4,443,4.313253012048193

8709037,4,B00V42YRGG,"Let me begin by saying I love Mazinger Z. This show is amazing. Almost as good as the original! You definitely need to pick this box set up if you like anything Go Nagai, giant robots, and good animation. I'm leaving a 4 star review only because in the product description it says the show is dubbed in English. It is actually in japanese with English subtitles.",1436486400,7,362,4.417910447761194
8709038,5,B00V42YRGG,"It's been a long time since I watched a giant robot anime series that did NOT insult my intelligence with Communist propaganda. (Note to writers who write scripts for 'Mobile Suit Gundam' episodes: POLITICAL LEADERS start wars to further POLITICAL AIMS. Business leaders, like the arms manufacturers you denounce as ""merchants of death,"" DO NOT start wars to sell more weapons, because they do not have the authority to start wars- business leaders are NOT political leaders, and have no direct political authority!) The series is fun, reasonably paced, as there's only ONE filler episode, and it's the first episode, used to introduce EVERY SINGLE CHARACTER and POTENTIAL PLOT THREAD in the series- and EVERY SINGLE ONE serves to further the story.

The characters are tolerable, as Kabuto Koji doesn't waste his (and the viewers') time whining about how fate (or an abusive father) forced him to fight a war he wanted no part of. Mazinger Z's pilot determines his goal- to avenge his grandfather, to defeat the enemy, to defend his friends and family members- and then focuses his efforts on accomplishing this goal. The cliffhanger ending isn't a rewind button that resurrects the Big Bad and puts the hero under the exact same situation he was in at the series' beginning, it REPLACES the Big Bad with a Bigger Bad, and offers a reasonable explanation for the ""Bigger Bad's"" absence in previous episodes. To those who suffered through 'Evangelion: 3.0 You Can (Not) Redo', that's a welcome relief.

If you like watching giant robots fight one another, but hate the Communist propaganda seen in 'Mobile Suit Gundam SEED' and 'Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny', this is the medicine you need.",1435708800,4,1693,5.0
8709039,5,B00V42YRGG,"Mazinger Z came out in the 1970s and had superior animation and storyline to anything else at the time. This is a reeboot and boy does it deliver. Art is great, music is great, stories are fun and energetic. There is also quite a bit of comedy and seriousness all in one. I guess this is the type of schizophrenic script that makes this show awesome. Characters are as you would remember them but still modern. I would say this anime does require some nostalgia for maximum enjoyment, but if you like that Giant robots fighting the evil monster of the week, then this should serve you well.
Really a breath of fresh air in a time when anime seems to just be so watered down and dying.
If you liked this anime, you may also like the Guyver reeboot anime, and Witchblade anime.",1433980800,11,775,4.388888888888889
