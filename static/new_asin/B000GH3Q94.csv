This product has three Sherlock Holmes movies from the 1930s where Arthur Wontner played the most famous fictional detective. Here is a brief description. Read the reviews for each movie. Arthur Wontner best resembled the old illustrations for the Sherlock Holmes stories.

Silver Blaze / Murder at the Baskervilles, 1937 film
Holmes and Dr. Watson will take a vacation at the Baskerville estate. Inspector Lestrade tells of his new job. He says Silver Blaze will win the race. Mr. Standard visits Moriarity he needs to win to avoid bankruptcy. It costs &uacute;10,000 to fix the race. The owner of Silver Blaze guards him carefully. Holmes demonstrates his powers of observation at the Baskervilles (blue chalk). Mr. Trevor visits Straker the trainer. The next morning they find Silver Blaze missing! Colonel Ross asks Holmes for help, Lestrade is with him. A dog barks as they approach. Holmes asks for an old horseshoe. They find the body of Straker out on the moor. Where is the horse? Holmes follows the tracks. He talks to Silas Brown, the owner of a competitive horse, who will do as Holmes says. Holmes has his plans. Who bought Strakers promissory notes? The dog always sleeps outside at night. Holmes questions Mrs. Straker. Some of the sheep have gone lame. What was the curious incident of the dog in the night? Curry disguises the taste of opium. Holmes explains the facts to Colonel Ross. The chief clue was the surgeons scalpel. [The story Silver Blaze was used for this movie. Note how minor details can add up to solve a mystery.]

The Sign of Four, 1932 film
This was adapted from the story by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Jonathan Small tells of a treasure buried in a fort in Agra. Major Sholto and Captain Morstan search for the jewels. Will there be a conflict? Retired Major Sholto reads about the escape of Jonathan Small. He tells his two sons of his secret then collapses. Mary Morstan owns a florist shop and gets a strand of pearls! Two men invade the Sholto home to search for the treasure. Mary Morstans safe is cracked. A letter calls her to a meeting, she is warned against going to the police. The ending was changed from the original novel, which had a more ironic ending. It is one of the best of the Holmes films. Ian Hunter is the best Doctor Watson, a young man around thirty. There is subtle criticism of British Imperialism and its looting of the treasures of India.

The Triumph of Sherlock Holmes, 1935 film

This is based on Sir Arthur Conan Doyles The Valley of Fear. Sherlock Holmes is moving out for his retirement. Professor Moriarity wishes him a pleasant and permanent retirement. Moriarity is offered $50,000 for a job. Inspector Lestrade visits with news of a murder at Birlstone Castle. Holmes and Watson go there to investigate. The body of Mr. Douglas has a brand on the arm. The murderer took the wedding ring from Mr. Douglas finger. Lestrade questions the people there. [Does the wife seem sad?] That brand is the mark of the Scourers, a secret society. Widow Douglas tells their history in America. She met Jack Murdock in America. What about the missing dumbbell? Barker and Mrs. Douglas laugh over their behavior. At night Holmes solves the crime by finding a missing person. This is not the real history of the 1876 Coal Wars in the Anthracite region. This clever story shows how easy it is to jump to a wrong conclusion when you depend on circumstantial evidence. Holmes does not make this mistake. [How could a private detective amass a great fortune to buy a castle in England?]",1348790400,,3628,4.743264659270999
8132190,5,B000GH3Q94,"Arthur Wontner may not be synonymous with the Great Consulting Detective (or indeed technically famous) anymore, but in an age when Basil Rathbone had yet to take the part, and neither Jeremy Brett nor Benedict Cumberbatch even existed yet, Wontner was considered to be the single finest Sherlock Holmes the thespianic arts had ever produced. (truth to tell, Wontner was himself, after the stage's William Gillette and the silent screen's Ellie Norwood, the third actor to have the ""definitive Holmes"" mantle conferred upon him. so what went around came around, really.)
the surviving Wontner films are faithful and fun. he might've gotten the role chiefly by resembling the Strand Magazine illustrations (by one Sidney Paget) that prompted what most people figured Sherlock Holmes looked like, but that was hardly the extent of his qualifications. his is a foreceful and laudable Sherlock that can stand comparison with the aforementioned Messrs. Rathbone and Cumberbatch. the films may have their weaknesses or what several decades worth of changing times might make seem like weaknesses, but they deserve to be seen.
THE SIGN OF FOUR had me rooting for it from the git-go, because the source material is my favorite of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's four Sherlock novels. the film is entertaining but less exciting than it should've been thanks to a structural faux pas: it spends twenty minutes spelling out the story, THEN we get around to visiting Sherlock. i really, REALLY hate it when something that came billed as a mystery blows the gaffe like that. i just might have some affection for the TV series MONK...if it weren't in the obtuse habit of making it abundantly clear ""who done it"" in the opening ""teaser"" sequence!! (a ""pre-owned"" car is one thing: a pre-solved mystery is quite another.)
THE TRIUMPH OF SHERLOCK HOLMES is generally considered to be the high-water mark of the Wontner series. (no mean feat, considering that it's based on THE VALLEY OF FEAR, which is generally considered strictly middle-of-the-road.) Sherlock's attempted retirement is curtailed by a murder involving a secret society from America, who have allied themselves with Professor Moriarty. actor Lyn Harding has been said to of delivered the definitive portrayal of the Napoleon of Crime. i don't know about that, but he does have the stature and the sneer to project the proper menace. (i certainly wouldn't want to meet him down the proverbial dark alley on the proverbial dark night.)
Wontner's final appearance, MURDER AT THE BASKERVILLES, is adapted from the story ""Silver Blaze."" (indeed it was called SILVER BLAZE in it's native England.) it's generally faithful, but takes the liberty of adding Professor Moriarty and Sir Henry Baskerville (some twenty years after his encounter with the Hound). it's an uneasy mix, and the film is a little top-heavy, but it's still pretty good for the most part. and besides, how often, really, is the final episode of a film franchise the pinnacle? only once that i can think of offhand: THE LORD OF THE RINGS: THE RETURN OF THE KING.
now i'd like to say a few words about the other purchases i made at the same time.
another i netted ar the same time is a double feature. THE SPECKLED BAND, quite possibly Sherlock's very first ""talkie,"" is a workmanlike adaptation of what Conan Doyle always said was his personal favorite of Sherlock's adventures. Lyn Harding, before taking the aforementioned Moriarty gig, brings an equally chilling villainy to this little film. (""little"" is right. at 49 1/2 minutes, it is the shortest ""feature"" film i've ever seen.) Raymond Massey is more than up to the challenge of playing the great detective. his voice is admittedly a bit coarser than one imagines Sherlock's as being, but if you can manage to get passed that, he gets the job done.
the final film is the most delicate one to write about. the 1962 German production whose title translates to SHERLOCK HOLMES & THE DEADLY NECKLACE, starring Christopher Lee, was a troubled little production, and one particularly overzealous critic would describe it as the PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE of Sherlock Holmes movies. true enough, the film has a few weaknesses. the story doesn't always make sense, and the thoroughly out-of-place modern jazz score is enough to make one thank God the film predates hip-hop. (the score they used would be a better fit for a spy movie.) weirdest of all, though, is the dubbing. it was filmed in English and dubbed to German for it's domestic release. then, curiously, for the English-speaking world they dubbed a new English track rather than using the one they already had. the voice coming out of Christopher Lee's mouth sounds like a stand-up comic or something doing his impression of Christopher Lee. and the frequent mispronounciation of the villain's name as ""Moriar-ritty"" puts my obsessive-compulsive disorder to the test like few things can.
so it's not a completely satisfying film, but as it happens, it not a completely UNsatisfying film, either. it's richly atmospheric, it moves at a brisk pace, and it has an excellent cast. Lee salvages the film from complete mediocrity (almost singlehandedly) by being a virtually faultless Sherlock, delivering canonical nuances and providing good character moments that manage to shine through the shoddy dub job. (Lee would reprise the role, but not for a few decades. every Sherlockian who sees this film comes out regretting that it was the one chance the world had to see Christopher Lee as Sherlock Holmes in his prime. (Sherlock's prime, not Christopher's.)) Thorley Walters also does a good job as Watson. more polished, professional productions than this one - A STUDY IN TERROR, for instance, or the latter period of the Granada series (when David Burke was displaced by Edward Hardwicke) - have fallen just short of faultlessness because the actors playing our Baker Street heroes lacked what's known as ""chemistry."" Lee and Walters have chemistry out the wazoo. so whatever DEADLY NECKLACE gets wrong, it does get the most vital element(s) right!
and of course i'd be quite remiss if i didn't mention that Throley Walters would reprise the role of Watson in one of the very best comedies on the subject, Gene Wilder's THE ADVENTURE OF SHERLOCK HOLMES' SMARTER BROTHER.
most of my fellow Sherlockians (and most film critics in general, i suspect) would advise you to run like hell from DEADLY NECKLACE, and i can see their point, but i still liked just enough about it to say go head, give it a shot. it should've been so much more...but it could've been so much less.
so that's a grand total of five films on two discs. (just so we're clear, i'd better remind you that that's two separate purchases, but at less than ten bucks a piece, thankfully.) the quality of product inevitably fluctuates - meaning the quality of the films themselves, not the film masters - but on the whole any one of the six is a potential treat for the seasoned Sherlockian, and a pretty good induction for the novice Sherlockian.",1328745600,5,7021,4.9660152931180965
