8336493,5,B001QV7T1U,"I found this on sale and bought it for my daughter, who loves Baby Einstein.  I was really impressed with this DVD.  It's not without its flaws, but for what I imagine was a low-budget production, it does a great job of teaching the creation with primary songs and fun pictures/video footage.  I liked it so much that I ordered ""I Am a Child of God,"" which was okay, but wasn't as good as this one.  I was disappointed that there were only two Baby Mormon movies made, and I would have liked to see more.  If you only buy one of the two Baby Mormon DVDs, buy this one!",1251244800,4,568,4.127272727272727
