8509693,4,B0074AWO12,"I'm just an average joe citizen, mom, older person, lol.... And I loved this.  I have always enjoyed watching skaters but having broken my wrist falling off a STILL skateboard, lol, it isn't something I can do.  I envy them.  In any case, the movie delving into some of his life was so saddening and yet uplifting - very odd.  His soul is obviously a bit tortured and he admits freely to depression and alot of kicks and thumps along the way.  I don't know why his parents didn't intervene but I'm sure they tried.  His girlfriend (is she still?) is about the sweetest thing ever, clearly just standing by him though he is definitely a bit self-centered.  I feel for the ex, having to raise the child alone, too, whilst daddy just journeys and skates.  But he comes around a little, the lil tot is adorable. LOL.... In any case, everyone has faults and it was gritty, tough, fun, hardcore, tender, sweet, sad... Just jagged and real.  I've seen homeless situations and it's definitely hard to stay positive and succeed after that, especially with depression.  You come away really hoping they all succeed, whatever happens. You gotta be there for your kids, people!  :)",1348617600,,1169,4.6536585365853655
8509694,5,B0074AWO12,"It is a rare thing for me to log on to write a review, but having watched this film on Netflix (UK) last night, I felt I must. This film captures a rare spirit in the skateboarder 'Screech' - and captures him with such style, empathy, and understanding.

It looks beautiful, the warm shots capturing what it means to be young and against the grain.

And young and against the grain is what Screech is, in a powerfully authentic way - an artist, no less, living off of his work and noteriety, like all good artists should.

This film reminded me of the beauty of living a life on one's own terms, being true to oneself, and simply having a good time.

It is a warm and powerful social document, and gave me a lot of hope that life is not as boring as it sometimes seems.

I can't recommend this film strongly enough.",1348617600,2,815,4.266233766233766
