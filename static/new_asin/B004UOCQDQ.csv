8441868,2,B004UOCQDQ,"It's far too long for me. No new insights along the way, just inexorable sameness - reinventing the same wheel every day. Dad is compassionate and affectionate when he's with her. We get that, over and over again. I'm not sure I like exploiting Maria - she's not getting anything out of being the subject of a video. It's not beautiful.

I care for an elderly relative who has senile dementia.",1523404800,,393,4.535211267605634
8441869,5,B004UOCQDQ,"Very moving documentary, perfect to share with your kids and have a nice talk afterwards about how this family lives with a disability, how nice that Maria has a life that seems very nice and fulfilling. I enjoyed the artist's work. It is in Spanish and Catalan with English subtitles",1517702400,,284,4.7
8441870,4,B004UOCQDQ,"Maria and I (Maria y Yo) is a documentary about an autistic teen as seen through her father's eyes. With love, understanding, tenderness, and a great deal of patience, Maria's father, Miguel, attends to her needs and cares for her like any devoted parent would. Over the years, their bond has grown stronger through honesty, compromise, humor, and a steady supply of spaghetti. Throughout the documentary, using interview clips, narration, and his own animation, Miguel comprehensively explains the kinds of obstacles and everyday challenges Maria has had to face. It's a sweet, sometimes amusing, and enjoyably informative film that I would recommend to anyone who has a friend or family member with autism, or to anyone who wants to know what living with autism is like. (3.5 stars)",1497657600,,784,5.1328125
