2453894,5,B000C8STR6,"I have used the episode titled ""Colosseum"" for several years as a complement to the textbook readings in both Latin and English concerning the construction and the magnitude of this building.",1355097600,,191,5.193548387096774
2453895,5,B000C8STR6,"This CD demonstrates the most likely techniques used by the Incas to cut and move stones, build bridges etc.  Inca stonework is still incredible, but this CD proves that space aliens, lasers, etc. are not necessary to explain it.",1343779200,,229,4.871794871794871
2453896,1,B000C8STR6,"This is not about the secrets of the Incas.  This is about a few good old boys who try to do what the Incans did.  If you are looking for history, look elsewhere.  If you like watching what Tanya did to Bob on a reality TV show, or that sort of thing, this is for you.  Such a ridiculous waste of time and effort.",1323561600,6,313,3.84375
2453897,4,B000C8STR6,"I've only watched part 1 of the Pryamid/Obelisk so far.  It ties in with my subject area of 6th grade social studies.  The video works nicely with current vocab words (perspective, artifacts, site/situation and credibility).  Students can see 'first hand' strategies that may have been used to build the great pyramids and discuss those strategies.  Addtionally, Nova has included printable materials (.pdf docs)and activities as lesson supplements. I would recommend the set for any social studies teacher to help those visual learners see the immensity of the great pyramids, and to learn about the security of those structures.",1292371200,4,630,5.3979591836734695
2453898,5,B000C8STR6,I hope to collect all of them.  Every one of the parts of the series is worth the purchase.,1245110400,,91,3.789473684210526
2453899,5,B000C8STR6,Colosseum Roof DVD arrived on time and in excellent condition.  This copy replaces an old VHS tape in my classroom.  Norma Goldman is outstanding in explaining how concrete is made an ancient Rome in this documentary on how the Romans made the Colosseum and installed a cloth roof.  Engineering students would enjoy this one.  I use it in Latin 1 classes for high school students.,1243641600,,380,4.8
2453900,5,B000C8STR6,"This is an excellent example of experimental archaeology, especially in the attempts of the researchers to figure out both how the Incas moved several ton blocks, but also how they shaped them into interlocking walls for their architecture.  The archaeologist on hand attempts to use hammer and pressure flaking techniques.  The sweeping views of the mountains are beautiful.  Later, people native to the area work to create a traditional rope bridge made of dried grass.  Fascinating!  This was required viewing for an archaeology class, but I brought it home and my 8 year old daughter watched it with me.  We both couldn't get enough!  It's a shame they didn't have time to talk more about the counting and record-keeping systems used by the Incas, but it did at least answer the question of how they did so without having a writing system.",1228953600,12,843,4.894366197183099
2453901,5,B000C8STR6,"I've often vaguely wondered how much engineering went into building some of the marvels of the ancient world.  As you'll learn from this series of DVDs, building these marvels was a great deal more complex than many imagine (certainly that I ever imagined).  These DVDs contain five episodes from NOVA, originally broadcast in the late 90s.  In each episode, modern craftsmen team with archaeologists in an effort to replicate the construction of buildings and other works created thousands of years ago.  The idea is to use only tools and techniques that would have been available to the civilization that originally constructed the object.  The teams can't use fork lifts, cranes, bucket trucks, or other modern pieces of equipment.  Large blocks of stone must be moved and lifted with muscle power, simple winches, and pulleys.  In this first set of DVDs, teams attempt to create a small pyramid, setup (i.e. upright) a small Egyptian obelisk initially laying on its side, replicate the canopy that covered the Coliseum, put the suspended rocks on the top of Stonehenge, and create a suspension bridge in the Incan Andes.  After watching even one of these DVDs, you'll realize that there is a lot more to any of architectural wonders than you imagined.  These DVDs are partly a basic physics/mechanical engineering lesson, partly a cultural history of the civilizations that built the objects, and partly a tale of man trying to use his brain to overcome nature.  In each episode, the teams encounter expected and unexpected problems that sometimes they are able to overcome, but other times they aren't.  Both the teams and the viewing audience develop a greater appreciation for some of the complexities by the end of each episode.  This probably isn't everyone's cup of tea, but for those who are interested in thoughtful historical and technical problems, this series can't be beat.  I found the episode about the Obelisk to be the best (although they are all good).  I never realized that it would be so hard to place an obelisk up right.  The episode about the canopy over the Coliseum is also great too.  They had to call sail makers in to make the thing work.  OK, so I found all the episodes fascinating.  A little pricey at $35.99, but each time I watch this I learn something new.  I'm happy to have this as part of my collection - thinking man's TV at it's best.",1201651200,8,2377,4.839108910891089
2453902,3,B000C8STR6,"If the Incas didn't have wheels, then how did they erect huge walls?  If they didn't have writing, how did they keep tabs on things?  This documentary tries to answer that.  Basically, those filmed try to set stones in a similar fashion and build an Incan bridge.  The first project is speculative but the second project is actually done by the Incas' descendants.

Personally, I prefer documentaries about ancient peoples more than about their structures.  Whereas ancient Egyptian paintings really grab my attention, I can look at Maccu Pichu (sp?) and be bored visually.  This work shows a bit of modern, indigenous Peruvians.  In fact, they seemed to be proud to try to discover the ways of the ancients.  They showed women carrying babies trying to pull stones with the menfolk; you'd never see a woman with a non-weaned child in a Western construction site.  I think the presence of the white academics and the indigenous Peruvians is meant to show something multiracial and coalitional.  They show both groups eating cooked guinea pig and I'm almost sure it's shown just to amuse and possibly gross out viewers in industrialized countries.

The work isn't sappy, but it will impress the viewer about how amazing human ingenuity is.  People of the past had high infant mortality and low life expectancies, but that didn't stop them from erecting things that can last for centuries.

If your children like the film and Saturday cartoon ""Emperor's New Groove,"" then you may want to let them view this documentary.",1182211200,9,1517,4.944664031620554

8096311,5,B000C8STR6,I absolutely love this DVD.  I show it every year in my classroom when we study the Inca.  I find my students are always riveted with the discussions about how Inca did their stonework.  My the way-- this is a middle school classroom.,1407283200,2,234,4.395348837209302

8096313,5,B000C8STR6,"This NOVA documentary is one of the best I have seen. I traveled to South America after 2 years in the Peace Corps in the Caribbean. In Peru I visited the Inca capital Cuzco and the lost city Machu Picchu. This documentary shows a group of Inca citizens moving huge stones as their ancestors might have done and making a rope ladder made of grass as the ancient Incas might have done. I hope this documentary would interest you to visit Peru, one of the great empires of the world.
I have only one complaint: the announcers insist in calling the Inca beast of burden the Llama a Lama. The correct pronunciation of llama is ""yama"" because the double l in Spanish is the same as the letter y in English. Come on guys: get it right.",1383264000,3,729,4.328467153284672

8096315,4,B000C8STR6,"Interesting information on the probable ""how"" stones were moved from one location to another; how they were shaped and put in place at places like Machu Picchu.  The building of the straw bridge is quite fascinating.",1368403200,,216,5.0
8096316,4,B000C8STR6,"A little slow, but they offer up very plausible solutions to ancient megalithic stone construction that contrasts nicely for those that watch Ancient Aliens.

A definite for fans that enjoy a mixture of history, engineering and anthropology.

There is no flashy tricks going on here with the production, it's fairly straightforward documentary hinging on the troubles of organization, collaboration and the competition and triumph of ideas rendered through brute force, perseverance and innovation.",1360108800,2,498,5.808219178082192
