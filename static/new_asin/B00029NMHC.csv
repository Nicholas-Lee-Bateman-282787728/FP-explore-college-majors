2072215,5,B00029NMHC,"Excel Saga is a crazy, random anime based on the managa written by Koshi Rikudo.  It includes numerous anime parodies, and cultural references.  And makes fun of everything, even itself.  There's a different genre to every episode (Sports, sci-fi, poorly translated action movie, etc.).  There are also hilarious characters that make great contrubutions to the show's comedy, such as Ilpallazo: a dictator who often does things that are out of character.  Wantanabe, Iwata, and Tsumiyoshi: three roomates that are always fighting.  And of course, Excel: the idiot who can't seem to do anything right.  (If you like this, also consider Azumanga Daioh)",1088121600,5,650,5.313725490196078
2072216,5,B00029NMHC,"Words cannot express my gratitude to ADV films for bringing us such a great series!  This is simply anime at its coolest, funniest, and most insane.  Every episode is legendary and you simply must own them all.  The story revolves around an insane girl (""First name, Excel, last name, Excel, or just Excel for short"") and her constantly-on-the-verge-of-death partner in crime, the impossibly meek Hyatt, as they seek to help the megolomaniacal (and often bored) Lord Illpilazzo take over the city.  He sees the world as corrupt and plans to take it all over, but taking over the world is as he says, ""for imbeciles who can only grasp the most general of concepts"" so he's settling for just one city for now. So he basically just sends his girls on bizarre missions hither and thither to create general mischief. This story line (or lack thereof) is so hilarious it could carry the sereis unaided, but wait there's more!  Such as Excel's next-door neighbors who fight loudly amongst each other at all hours over such things as money, food, and porn magazines.  They all join a public service job under another insane character who attempts to make them into a crime-fighting group. Then there's Pedro, who is killed in an Excel-related accident in the first episode and now wanders the earth as a ghost and undergoes torture after torture throughout the entire series while we all laugh. And, of course, there's Nabeshin, the director's afro-sporting alter-ego ""whose sense of self-promotion seeks to straddle the world"" as he bursts unannounced into every storyline for no apparent reason other than the fact that he can because he's the director.  In fact, the whole staff is in on the joke and the writers, original manga author, and even the singers of the theme song all get in on the action.  This may all sound insane and confusing, but trust me, I've barely scratched the surface.  Anime satire, parody, and truly disturbing comedy is the name of the game in this show which I can only describe as Japan's answer to shows like ""The Simpsons"" and ""Family Guy"".  No genre is left untouched; American and Japanese pop culture alike are targetted for ridicule. Not to mention the too many movies and animes to list that are singled out and parodied including Power Rangers, Jaws,Fist of the North Star,Aliens and whatever your favorite anime or movie is, all are brutalized equally.  If any of this perks your interest, you really must buy this set.  I can't imagine any anime fan with a sense of humor and a cynical outlook on life not enjoying this series.  The episodes can be (nay, MUST BE) watched again and again, in Japanese and English, and you will still catch some new joke every time you watch them.  In fact, to get every single joke and reference you'll almost certainly have to go through some scenes frame-by-frame (it's a labor of love).

There so annoying that all I could do is either return this DVD or maybe - just maybe skip a couple of episodes to see if something cool might happen. But it didn`t work at all. This series was a waste of money. I only bought it because I heard it was really cool and original and so that made me want to buy it. I think I may have learned my lesson on listening to these propagandas, is that not every single word they say is true that if a series is said to be really good in characters, plots, story, etc. Because in the end you are the only critic to give your conclusions or reviews.",1259280000,,873,3.937853107344633

2072232,4,B00029NMHC,"This is one of the most spectacular box sets I've ever bought; instead of a bunch of bare-bones thin-pak discs, Excel Saga - The Imperfect Collection is actually all of the individually-released discs gathered up into one handy box, with all of the neat pack-in bits and pieces and the on-screen ADVid-Notes that the thin-pak collection omits.

The ADVid-Notes, incidentally, do take some getting used to; instead of the extra booklets that most anime DVDs come with, the Excel Saga DVDs use on-screen ""pop-ups"" (think Pop-Up Video--the effect is identical) to point out and explain cultural references and jokes that English-speaking viewers would probably miss, or wouldn't comprehend if they did take notice.  They're informative, but they do have a tendency to cover up part of the action, and occasionally the screen is literally filled with text.  Plus, they sometimes flash by so fast that you have to go back and rewatch the scene frame by frame to catch them (although because of the nature of the show, you'd probably be doing that anyway).  Of course, they usually make up for their intrusiveness by being incredibly funny, not that Excel Saga needs any help being funny, mind you; and they can be toggled on or off from the main menu.

As for the series itself...

If you're a fan of anime at all, you have to watch Excel Saga.  There's no two ways about it.  The producers of Excel Saga suffer no illusions about their target audience, as shown by the sheer number of references and parodies, not only of other anime series but of otaku culture in general.  (An example: In the very first episode, Excel is told to assassinate a noted manga artist who is guilty of corrupting the minds of the populace with the base and immoral filth he produces.  The artist turns out the be Rikudou Koushi, the man who created the manga that Excel Saga is based on.)  But even if you're just beginning, you can still enjoy Excel Saga; there's enough random weirdness to keep even the most casual anime fan entertained, or for that matter, a fan of American animation (see Episode 17, Animation USA, for more information).  The plot is as follows: Excel, a cute but somewhat dim and unbalanced girl, is a member of ACROSS, a secret organization whose ultimate goal is world domination by way of the domination of F City in F Prefecture (ACROSS decided to start small).  The only members of ACROSS that we ever see are Excel; her boss, Lord Il Palazzo, a handsome man who may or may not have multiple personalities; and her lower-ranking coworker, Hyatt, a pretty young woman who has a habit of dying at weird times.  In between assignments, Excel and Hyatt hold a string of part-time jobs, none of which they manage to hold for very long.  (Excel Saga was created in the midst of an economic recession, so many of the jokes center around things like unemployment and poverty.  Anyone who's ever been out of work can surely relate.)  There's more--a LOT more--but that's the gist of it.  The show does start to drag a little about two thirds of the way in; and the constant plugs for Excel Saga's sequel series, Puni Puni Poemy, that crop up near the end of the series start to get old pretty fast.  Plus, the voices can be a little grating, especially Menchi's voice in the English dub.  But none of that turned me off enough to make me stop watching.

Be warned though: If you're looking for something to keep your kids entertained, KEEP LOOKING, because this isn't it.  Although the producers saved the REALLY bad stuff for the final episode (which was intentionally made too violent and obscene for television broadcast--quite a feat in a country where television standards are a lot more lax than they are in the US), the rest of the episodes still contain a lot of language, innuendo, and general acts of depravity.  Also, some of the jokes deal with something called lolicon, which I'm probably not allowed to define here, but take it from me, it's pretty heavy stuff; look it up on Wikipedia if you must know.  It's best to think of those jokes as just what they are, a jab at a particular (and small, let it be known) segment of the otaku culture, and nothing more than that ever comes of it; but if that kind of humor bothers you, you should probably think twice.  But for everyone else, I seriously doubt you'll be disappointed.",1202688000,,4335,4.65748031496063
2072233,5,B00029NMHC,"Others have written comprehensive descriptions of the series, so I'll skip on that other than to agree that it's a whacky, madcap, insane ride through a world of puns, parodies and absolutely mindless hilarity.  Aside from the constant humor (the only serious bit is in the last episode or two), the theme song is quite catchy.  Love the refrain ""tonzaru koite!"" (""And we run like hell!"", and am now trying to memorize the whole song. :D

I bought the thin-pack with five discs, so I suppose I missed out on some of the ""extras,"" but I got the entire series which was what I really wanted.  BTW, I agree with comments about Excel's dubbed voice: Her Japanese voice can be hard enough to take at times (given that she only talks at a fast or faster stream of consciousness flow), and the English dubbing is enough to make you shoot yourself.  I recommend going with Japanese and subtitles.",1202428800,,888,4.594936708860759

theres a bit of ""shock value"" humor too

its the kind of thing you can watch over and over and notice something new every time.

basic plot....

...theres a group trying to take over the world...theres another trying to stop them... and a race of super cute (until you injure them) alien teddy bears with their own agenda as well.....

atthe end of each episode, everything sort of ""resets"" so they can try it in a different way

2072246,5,B00029NMHC,"What can I say that hasn't been said? Easily one of my favourite series, it's a parody-based experience in stereotypes and clichs by pushing everything to an absurd level of extremes. Sure, the plot may seem week at times, but everything comes together nicely at the end, making a self-inclosed series that I find very.... ""complete"".

If there is one caveat, it's that the parodic nature of the series demands a certain knowledge of classic series and of typical anime memes in order to fully enjoy. Although there are written commentary you can activate to explain this references, I don't know if the enjoyment would be the same. Then again, for the absurd humour fan, this could be irrelevant.

2072249,4,B00029NMHC,"Death, death, and more death. From the killing of the main character (Excel) in the first scene, to her sidekick's (Hyatt) continuous dying from anemia, to Pedro the wandering soul, you learn quickly that Excel Saga is one weird comedy.

Excel works for the secret ideological organization, ACROSS, and is hopelessy head over heels infatuated with its leader, Lord Ilpalazzo. Oh, and she's none too bright, and ADHD, with a HEAVY emphasis on the H.

Follow Excel as she and Hyatt destroy skyscrapers, fight jungle commandos, bring down city governments, fend off alien invaders (Sooo cute!) and wipe out the bird population of Japan while (nearly) fruitlessly trying to overthrow the city en route to world conquest.

Nothing is sacred in this spoof, and if you have a fair knowledge of Japan  and its culture, you'll be amply rewarded with laughs.

Excel Saga is not for kids, and is not recommended if you didn't like American Pie, Animal House, Airplane, etc. The jokes are what this series is about, they come fast and furious, and if you missed one, too bad, we're moving to the next one.

ADV did a great job with this title, taking time to include ""Vid-Notes"", popups that explain the cultural references to us uninitiated. Even people who grew up in Japan can learn something here.

The dub is great, and although Jessica Calvello (Excel) injured her voice halfway through the series due to overwork, Larissa Wolcott takes over so seamlessly, you'd never know the voice actress was changed.

Cautions:

The pace is breakneck, knock off a star if you don't care for frenetic and hyper.

Episode 26, which was not aired on Japan TV, is crude and vulgar (but still funny), and should be screened before watching in mixed company. I can only stand it about once every five years.

Remember, NOTHING is sacred in this show, if you hold to a high moral ground, you should steer clear.",1163548800,,1886,4.790123456790123

2072251,4,B00029NMHC,"Excel Saga has been described by some as the ""Family Guy of Anime.""  While this covers the fact that it's definitely wacky and random, this is a poor framing for a series as original as this.  Sure, the humor comes at you from multiple directions at once, is often ""inappropriate"" and is at times non-sensicle, but the comparison is a stretch.

You can find great reviews of the series itself on the page for the ""Imperfect Collection,"" the previous box set release.  What I mainly want to address here is that this thin-pack collection may not be the best way for first-timers to experience this series.  Any time a series is brought over from Japan and translated for us westerners, many things get lost in translation.  In the case of Excel Saga, many of the jokes and references fall victim to the dreaded ""Lost-In-Translation"" syndrome.  ADV was able to help us with that problem by including the ""ADV Notes"" feature on previous releases of the series, which explained many of the jokes and references that often are lost on non-japanese audiences.  That feature is conspicuously absent from this thin-pack release.  While not an essential feature, it's extremely helpful for first-time viewers and those of us not nearly as immersed in the otaku lifestyle as some.  Veterans, feel free to save a few bucks, but newcomers would be better off with the ""Imperfect Collection.""",1154476800,39,1379,4.879828326180258
2072252,5,B00029NMHC,"First and foremost I think Excels dubbed voice is faaaannnnttastic.  You get so much more story with less time taken away.  If you can't follow it your brain is way to underdeveloped.

  Well anyway on to the story it's self. And yes their is a story.  I doesn't really make sense until you see the end.  Yeah that definitly makes you go no way, now I get it.  Well Excel is the hero/defect of the Great Idealigicol Association of ACROSS.  Run by Lord Il Pallazzo (all hail Lord Il Pallazzo).  Her undieing faith or dieing faith for Lord Il Pallazzo proves that she will do anything to aid in world conquest.  But not to push herself to hard she has been instructed to take the world one city at time.  So were start with F City.  And from here on the story takes soo many turns it is hard to follow.

  It's not the story that makes this show so great.  It's the many characters within the show.  The very sickly alien princess Hyatt,  the poor poor poor Mr. Pedor (and yes Mr. Pedro's tears are falling like waterfalls), the ever determined to survive Menchi,  the three next door neighbors who don't even know what they're about to get invovled with, your hero and mine Nabashine, and the ever busy Great Will of The Magrocosim.  Just to name a few.  And yes their are many many more improtant characters.  Maybe not important to the storyline but to the craziness it's self.

  All and all this is one of the funniest shows I have ever had the pleasure of viewing.  Having been able to watch this show later on in my anime fasination I got a lot of the jokes that normally go over others heads.  No show is gone untouched.  Well no good show goes untouched.  The one thing that has always really pissed me off about this show is the fact we never get to the real goods.  For you perverts out there you'll know what I'm talking about.  We don't even see them in the last episode.  Which by the way takes makes you question your own ethics by watching and laughing.

I plan to study the series and those related to gain a better understanding and appriciation. If you don't believe it's worth it, ask my friends.

2072254,4,B00029NMHC,"Excel Saga is probably the definition of a guilty pleasure. Think about it: during this series, you'll laugh at violent deaths, eating a puppy, a sickly young girl who can't seem to sing one song without coughing, and a creepy adult man who enjoys surrounding himself with little girls. Yet it's able to pull this off in its own way, by never once allowing any kind of seriousness to creep into the series whatsoever.

That, however, is also what hurts this series. The chaos may just be too chaotic. The fictional writers within Excel Saga are constantly suffering from a lack of ideas of where to take the series. I think this may have been true in real life as well. Excel Saga seemed too contrived at times. Not only that, but there wasn't even close to a continuing story to carry it from episode to episode. After about half the series, I got bored with it, until maybe the last four or five.

Luckily, the characters of Excel Saga were there to back up the humor and keep it going. Of course, there is Excel, the main character, who works for Lord Ilpalazzo, a mysterious, over-lord-like figure who resides under F City. Also along for the ride is the sickly alien princess Hyatt, Pedro the whiny romantic, the government workers of F City, an afro sporting secret agent, some adorable-yet-ugly aliens, and, of course, the neighbors of Excel and Hyatt. All of these character play a key role in bringing about the laughs. Every episode of Excel Saga, while it usually revolves around Excel herself and the organization of Across, also follows one or more of these characters in their own personal quests.

In the end, what I came away with after watching the entirety of the series was that Excel Saga was indeed a funny anime, and definitely the best of its kind. But the thing is, there aren't very many of its kind, so that's not a good comparison. Basically, I'd say to play it by tastes; if you like Adult Swim, then chances are you'll enjoy Excel Saga.",1150502400,8,1965,4.576704545454546

2072258,3,B00029NMHC,"I like spoofs and gag films, and I was excited that there existed an anime equivalent. The main problem is that being an American, I have to have most of the jokes and puns ""explained"" to me with English voice actors and ADV's ad vid notes (pop up balloons that explain what is going on like VH1's Pop up videos). That pretty much kills 99% of Excel's language gags and twist on words, because they suffer in the translation and are no fun when spelled out literally. The other main problem is that Excel's English voice actor, Jennifer Calvello's voice is so screechingly annoying, you will want to mute your TV and watch the subtitles. It is just that bad and almost makes things unwatchable. She damaged her vocal cords (probably from screaming too much as Excel) and is thus replaced half way through the series by another actress who attempts to sound just like her. Add in a couple of other annoying voices (Pedro mainly) and I almost gave up after the first two episodes. But if you stick it out to the end, I think most viewers will find something to laugh at. I found the Puchuus to be funny. Menchi's scene with the kids picking on him was funny. I also liked Kabapu's character especially when he first enlisted the aid of Gojo Shioji (who has a harmless Lolita complex), the Daitenzin team as a parody of the Power Rangers, and so on. However, the gags about their dog Menchi being their emergency food supply was tiresome and unfunny to me because I love animals, especially dogs and even the implied consumption of a fictional dog is disgusting to me. You have to be patient with this one, since most of the sight gags and all of the language gags are lost on American ears, you just have to pick the little bits of palatable humor out from the chaff.

The extreme insanity could easily have been its undoing, but somehow the director, who incidentaly is in the show, manages to pull it off very well.

2072263,3,B00029NMHC,"I never heard of the series until a friend recommended it to me. For the price, I thought that the series was worth trying. Although I do not regret watching the series, I wish I would have rented instead.

Let's start off with the audio and visuals. Audio-wise, the dubbing can be pretty hard on the ears. Excel is the biggest offender, and is almost impossible to listen to, which really hurts considering she is the main character. The other characters are equally lacking, with the exception of about 3 characters in the entire series. However, to watch it with subtitles can be just as hard, since the text in the show is spoken at about three times the rate of normal anime. You'll be reading so fast that you typically miss what's even happening on screen. Speaking of which, the visuals are a mixed bag as well. Although the art seems to be well done, they are unfortunately bogged down by choppiness. Sometimes the scene will move smoothly, but other times the characters seem like they just needed to have more animation added.

Now, let's move on to the plot, or lack there of. Don't get me wrong, there is a plot somewhere, but halfway through the series you will realize that story never mattered. This is all about taking popular anime stereotypes and fully exploiting them. This show does everything in its power to make you laugh, sometimes successfully, and sometimes not. Episodes are really hit and miss, but the more anime you've watched, the funnier the show becomes. So it's definately not a show for someone just starting out, for many of the jokes will fly over their head. And it's also not for people that like a deep story in their anime, because like I said earlier, there really is no story. A person could pretty much jump in halfway through the series and be able to quickly grasp what's going on (with the exception of Pedro's segment). And ironically enough, episodes 14 through 16 actually try to develop a continuing story, but I found that those three episodes were the most lacking. Once they started focusing on story, they lost sight of what the series does best; making fun of other shows. Luckily episode 17 restores the trend of making no sense and the show becomes humorous again.

In the end, I found Excel Saga to be fun to watch. It has enough humor to hold my interest throughout the entire series, despite how annoying Excel is. However, I cannot see myself ever wanting to watch it a second time.",1104364800,6,2445,4.6160919540229886
2072264,4,B00029NMHC,"Synopsis

Excel, a bubbly airhead of a blonde (gee, we haven't seen this stereotype before) has just graduated from high school. She dances and skips her way into the real world, where the first thing she meets is the grille of a two-ton semi.

Needless to say, Excel is one dead blonde. However, the powers that be decide to resurrect her, because it's not yet her time to die: the TV series has barely started! (Yes, that's exactly the rationale.) So she becomes the mildly annoying and totally ineffective tool of the nefarious (okay, kinda nefarious) Lord Il Palazzo, who aims to subjugate the planet Earth to his ambitions. Her first task: to punish those advocates of anarchy and evil intent, the dreaded manga creators: specifically, the manga creator of Excel Saga. Means: execution by sword. And so begin the numerous (lame brained) plots to take over world by way of sheer insanity.

Review: Quack Experimental Anime Excel Saga (yes, that's the full name!) is solid, irrefutable proof that Japanese manga and anime creators are on drugs. Excel is not bright. In fact, she's so brainless that Il Palazzo is compelled to use various firearms on her just to shut her up. (""Hail Il Palazzo-"" BANG!) It's a wonder she survived through elementary school, much less graduation, as she obviously hasn't the sense to look both ways before crossing the street. (She gets nailed more than once by large vehicles.) And yet, she isn't as annoying to the audience as you'd expect, because she seems to do everything with much the same sort of dumb faith as Mihoshi from Tenchi Muyo, or, say, Detective Clouseau from The Pink Panther. Of course, it doesn't matter that she never really succeeds in what she aims to do, because, well, half the fun of Excel Saga is to watch the utterly surreal carnage she unwittingly inflicts on her environment. She's a walking natural disaster, and that makes her fun to be around, so long as she stays behind the screen.

The final episode gets special mention for being considerably raunchier and more offensive than the bulk of the series. Excel Saga is a total laugh riot, and even though the end of almost every episode insists that ""the experiment has failed"", it's a solid watch for those with a taste for black comedy with a pinch of satire. It's insane in every sense of the word, from the opening song (where the main characters sing in various locales, from Ginza, to the inside of a public men's bathhouse, while one of them continually coughs up blood) to the ending song (a dog singing an enka ballad about how Excel wants to eat it while various condiments rain down at random intervals, complete with Japanese-language interpreter). This show is certainly not for everyone (after all, it is pretty sick humor), but if you're game for a show so out-there, you can't help but stare in disbelief, Excel Saga is for you.

If you do not like black comedy, I would question everyone's overall review.",1102809600,3,2940,4.756862745098039
2072265,5,B00029NMHC,"This is one of those shows where multiple viewings comes in handy, because the gags come at such a frenetic pace that it's easy to miss them the first time around, not to mention the vast number of gags which are based on cultural or fandom references.  It definitely helps if you've done your homework, that is, if you have bothered yourself to know something about certain classic anime shows, computer games, and Japanese culture in general.  In-jokes abound, and readers of the manga will have a definite leg-up on those who are going into it fresh, a fact acknowledged even by the series' title character, the blithely hyperactive Excel.  Even if you are thoroughly familiar with the manga, watch the anime anyhow, because the animators stuffed more material and gags into every spare frame they could, until the result threatens to burst your TV screen and spill out all over the room.  Now THAT'S entertainment!

Even without such knowledge, Excel Saga is still highly entertaining, although some of the gags are really suited for more mature audiences.  If you enjoy gag anime (examples that leap to mind include ""Dragon Half"", ""Otaku no Video"", ""Super Deformed Double Feature"", ""The Ultimate Teacher"", and ""Elf Princess Rane"") then you will undoubtedly laugh yourself into a near fit watching ""Excel Saga"".",1099612800,5,1315,5.009174311926605
2072266,4,B00029NMHC,"Hail Il Palazzo!

The first time I had the pleasure of watching Excel Saga, I was completely blown away by HOW FUNNY this series was!
To say the truth, it has to be one of the funniest things out there, which is quite surprising, as I'm sure Koshi Rikdo (the author) was not expecting this kind of success from such an extreme parody as Excel Saga.

The characters are amazing, and you will instantly detect similarities to some familiar faces in other series, like Love Hina , Fist of the North Star and Dragon Ball Z. The contributions of the amazing Mitsuishi Kotono (oh Misato...) and Minami Omi, as Excel and Hyatt respectively, greatly add to this, even though I believe Excel was ""pushing it a bit too far"" at some points, and quite frankly I felt like putting a bullet through my/her head! But well, that's what Excel Saga is all about, taking it a step TOO far.

SO far that even the directors have managed to insert themselves into the series, just take a look at some of the characters like Nabeshin, who is ACTUALLY: Wata[nabe Shin]ichi! (Who, by the way, looks EXACTLY like Nabeshin!)

The only thing I have left to say is: If you're looking for a good laugh and enjoy extreme comedy/parody Anime, you're in for the ride of your life! Excel Saga is guaranteed fun for most of the series' 26 episodes and if you can bare with Excel's constant and irritating babbling without shooting yourself, you will CERTAINLY laugh like never before!",1099267200,6,1449,4.583011583011583
2072267,4,B00029NMHC,"Excel Saga is one of the first real animes I've seen and it's hilarious for those who cease to care about plot and love laughable plot twist at every corner. This show has no real plot other than Il Palazzo trying to conquer F city and well actually trying to develop a plot at the same time; everything else is just miscellaneous comedy and misadventures which surround it. The artwork to me for this kind of was rather good especially the cover art for the DVD case,and the antics they pull are quite enjoyable. In fact some jokes seem timeless for I've seen the first two DVDs six times and I still laugh uncontrolably at some of the jokes. I must warn you though that the voice acting for this show isn't the best; for some it may be the worst. You might get over it in time and just get use to their voices. Also most importantly it's selling for a pretty good price and not a bad series to start your collection with if not add to.

2072269,2,B00029NMHC,"So, I had been waiting to find the box set of this at a reasonable price for quite sometime.  I had read the reviews and thought the art looked great, so I really wanted to get this DVD and really wanted to like it.  Well, you can really get disapointed when you really want something.

The art work is borderline ""Cartoon Network"" or ""Commercial"" anime.  Nothing that will blow you away.  If you've seen Abenobashi or FLCL then you will be familiar with the style of normal and then WACKY art.  This style can be really cool and ad to the anime and story itself, but in this case it falls way short.  The anime just looks choppy and poor.

Artwork aside, usually you can rely on the voice acting to bring out the depth of the character.  Not this time.  The voices (english dub) are so horrible, shrill, and just plain awful to the ear that a chorus of jack-hammers would be a more enjoyable listen.  Just plain bad.  The Jpenese version is better but not great either.

The plots are stupid and juvenille.  Basically, wacky for the sake (no not rice wine) of wacky.  Now don't get me wrong, this can really work in some anime and be quite enjoyable to the viewer.  Its just when the director and writers let you know that they are being wacky that it detracts from the humor.  Basically, the viewer is told what is funny and then the character goes hey this is funny watch me do something funny isn't this funny.

All in all, EXCEL SAGA is an anime that can be missed.  Avoid it if you can, but if you have to watch it make sure that you only watch it in Japanese and try not to rip your ears off while the characters talk or die of utter bordem.",1094083200,6,1648,4.241157556270096

The anime Excel Saga is absolutely hilarious and nonsensical! So if you're only into more mature and serious animes, you definately should NOT get this!!

About the anime, when you first watch it, don't worry if you're confused or don't understand what Excel or some of the characters are saying, your ears will get adjusted to the way they talk. Oh, and here's a little note about why Excel says the crazy things she says: The original Japanese version had Excel rhyme whatever she said, but when translated, the rhyming was lost and only the nonsensical part was left. I recommend that, when you finish watching a DVD, you should watch it again with the VID notes on in order to comprehend all the jokes. Also, you may want to watch the anime with subtitles on, you'll catch things you could not hear fast enough before.

This is a great price for a great anime---only $78 for 6 DVDS... I wish I never bought the Excel Saga DVDs and purchased the box set instead!",1090454400,9,1092,4.455
2072271,4,B00029NMHC,"Suffice to say that *Excel Saga* is one of the funniest anime series I've seen. Even though I don't get half of the obscure references, and I don't get any of Excel-kun's puns (I don't speak Japanese), this series is a laugh riot. The fact that you can get such a great spoof anime in an attractive boxed set makes this a steal even for what Amazon is currently asking.

However, it's ADV's presentation that's on trial here: It's okay. The subtitles are a bit stiff. If you like the English dub, the voice for Excel changes halfway through the series: the first voice is awful - like a yipping dog's. The second is better, but neither is quite up to the *real* voice of Excel. And don't get me started on the dubbed Ilpalazzo! If you want to get a deeper understanding of the references made throughout the series, use the ADV notes feature: they're quite good, but so numerous that they often take up the entire screen.

The single most annoying feature of the first three or four disks is the layout of the DVD menus: they're complicated, unorthodox unintuitive and at times damned annoying.

Sadly I picked this up early on in my anime collection buying and got a bootleg. That is why I'm writing a review on this product here. I finally was able to pick up a used copy of the ADV release (the best version btw).

Excel saga is full of light and dark humor. Heck the first episode Excel dies by car and she also kills off the creator of the series only to have the Universe bring them both back to life.

Though Funimation has the rights to it and has a set of their own out this version (or the adv singles will also do, avoid the thinpack) is the best version of Excel Saga released state side due to the ADV notes. A lot of what is going on screen is culturally relevant to Japan so unless you know their history, their culture, and a lot of parodies to series a lot of the jokes will go over your head. This is where ADV notes comes in. It's like the old 'pop up video' series that ran on VH1 back in the day (that or MTV, so long ago I don't remember that well) where they pop up little bubbles that explain a lot of the stuff that's going on ON screen that would normally be lost. Pani Poni Dash also has these notes in the singles of the ADV release. Funimation left out the notes in their release so you get a bare bones version of the series without the on screen explanation. I paid 12 for a used copy of this release instead of getting a new Funimation set at that price in some places because it adds to the series that much.

The non-stop babbling squeak-fest that is Excel's dialogue got on my nerves and was at times, almost intolerable. On top of that, laughs were scarce (except for a few moments about keeping a dog alive as a back-up food supply and a villian names ""That Man""!). Sometime After seeing it all the way through, I discovered the existence of ADV Vid Notes on the DVDs and presto! Everything suddenly made sense and the funniness exemplified.

The thing with Excel Saga is that almost all of the humor/parodies in it, can only be picked up with an innate understanding of Japanese history/culture or with these Vid Notes turned on. Trying to laugh without either of these is like driving in the dark with no lights. I cannot stress the importance of this feature enough. The Vid Notes are fascinating, educational and do a good job of clearing up everything so that no joke or parody does un-noticed.

This show mostly focuses on the plotless misadventures of the annoying, blabbermouth Excel and Hyatt, the much quieter girl who basically just dies over and over. But there are side stories concerning a man named Pedro who is trying to win his wife's love back, and Excel's apartment neighbors who become civil servants. There are several crappy episodes, though. I find it very hard to enjoy the two Menchi Adventure episodes, all clips that have anything to do with the civil servants (the Power Ranger costumes they wear are the only thing funny about them) and the two recap episodes. This series is plotless, yet there are recap episodes... sure, one of the characters makes a joke about the stupidity of doing this but that don't change the fact that those episodes suck.

Basically, this is really only worth getting if you can buy the DVDs with the Vid Notes feature (Which this collection DOES have) and you have an incredible tolerance for floods of rapid-fire squeaky dialogue and bad filler.",1295049600,,2028,4.707042253521127
