6159379,5,B00HEQO9DM,Great movie. Laughed a lot. Really entertaining! My husband and I really enjoyed it!! Great actors. De Niro and Stallone are great together. Kim Basinger is gorgeous as ever...and at age 60!,1388275200,34,190,4.96875
6159380,2,B00HEQO9DM,"On paper, the idea to pit two of the greatest onscreen boxing characters against one another seems like a captivating idea.  In one corner, you have Sylvester Stallone who was propelled into stardom when he wrote and cast himself in the highly acclaimed 1976 boxing drama, Rocky.  Moviegoers instantly fell in love with Rocky Balboa, which would lead to five successful sequels before all was said and done.  In the other corner, you have living legend Robert De Niro.  By the time he starred as Jake LaMotta in Martin Scorseses 1980 boxing drama, Raging Bull, De Niro was already a monster success  winning an Academy Award for his role in The Godfather II.  Now, more than 30 years later since the success of their respective films, both men are in the twilight of their careers and are facing off in the boxing flick, Grudge Match.

Directed by Peter Segal (The Longest Yard, 50 First Dates), Grudge Match stars Sylvester Stallone as Henry Razor Sharp and Robert De Niro as Billy The Kid McDonnen.  Its been 30 years since Razor and The Kid have squared off against one another.  Their first match went to the final round, and eventually going to The Kid, while the rematch was decided quickly going to Razor.  Surprisingly, while both men were in their primes and with a third match on the horizon, Razor suddenly retired without reason.

Thirty years have passed and the third match that never was still looms large.  When an anniversary news piece reinvigorates the rivalry, it prompts the son of a late boxing promoter, Dante Slate Jr. (Kevin Hart), to attempt to lure them back in the ring together  regardless of their age and shape.  Although Razor is reluctant and hates The Kid with a passion, he has bills to pay after recently being laid off from his job.  The Kids ambition is much more personal and he simply wants the rematch so he can prove hes the better man.

With the rematch green lit, Razor turns to his trusted friend and former trainer, Lightning (Alan Arkin), for training  who actually resides in an old folks him.  Against his better judgment, Lightning decides to move in with Razor and train him.  The Kid, on the other hand, turns to a high profile trainer, Frankie Brite (LL Cool J)  even despite their lack of chemistry together.  However, The Kid unexpectedly meets his illegitimate, middle-aged son, BJ (Jon Berthal), who wants to get to know his father and abruptly decides he wants to train him.  Naturally, BJs mother, Sally (Kim Basinger) is the woman who came between Razor and The Kid all those years ago.

If you're wondering how entertaining a film about a 70 year old (De Niro) preparing to fight someone pushing 70 years old (Stallone is 67) could possibly be  the quick answer is not very entertaining at all.  As I stated in the introduction, the premise of this film is something quite a few fans of Rocky and Raging Bull would want to watch  maybe 25 years ago.  Both De Niro and Stallone still star in films like they're in the prime of their careers, but in reality, they are way over the hill and rarely find themselves at the top of the box office (with the exception of Stallone in The Expendables  which is mostly a major group effort).

From Stallone, youll get about exactly what youd expect from him. He rarely changes his acting style regardless of the film, so whether hes trying to break out of a prison in Escape Plan or hes killing bad guys in Bullet to the Head, hes still the same old generic Stallone. His co-star, Robert De Niro, has had a career full of acclaim, but now he is guilty of taking roles just to earn a pay check, which is evident in his recent films, like The Family or Killing Season. Also in typical De Niro fashion, he plays the loose canon that cant be controlled.  He has to lose everything just to understand what he had  a lesson youd think his character would have learned by the time he reached 70 years old.

Oddly enough, its the supporting cast that really shines in this film.  Kevin Hart, a well-established comedian, continues to expand his acting career  and even though this particular film lags most of the time, Hart is responsible for what enjoyment it does possess.  His exchanges with the charmingly funny Alan Arkin (which are well advertised in the films commercials) are the high point of the film.  Its pretty safe to say that without Harts loud, attention-drawing dialogue, and Arkins mellow one-lines and dancing maneuvers, this film would be a total debacle of epic proportions.  Unfortunately, even Hart and Arkin suffer at times during certain scenes from lackluster writing and dud jokes.

Overall, Grudge Match would have made for a great movie idea two decades ago.  Instead, this film features two over-the-hill actors that are desperate to stay in the limelight.  Dont get me wrong, Stallone and De Niro will go down as two of the all-time greats, but roles of this nature are far from amusing  and more depressing than anything else.  There are sporadic moments of cheap pops and chuckles, but ultimately, the plot falls flat and ends on a shrug.  At a lengthy two hours, the film is about 40 minutes too long and features a story told too many times before to garner any kind of positive recommendation.  However, the brief cameo by two well-known boxers during the credits almost makes it worth sitting through the whole film.  Almost.  At the end of the day, this film has rental written all over it.

6159425,5,B00HEQO9DM,"SURPRISINGLY GOOD! I had much more fun watching it than I expected! This is a really, really charming, gentle comedy, which will mightily cheer you up with its good scenario, strong dialogs and great actors! Below, more of my impressions with some limited SPOILERS.

Pittsburgh, PA, our times. Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Sylvester Stallone) and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (Robert De Niro) are two retired boxers, both pushing 70. Since like forever they were deadly enemies, both on the ring and in the private life - also, it was never definitely settled which one of them was better. McDonnen always wanted one more fight and Sharp is very low on money, so when a young ambitious promoter Dante Slate, Jr. (Kevin Hart) proposes them to organise ""The Grudgement Day"" match, they both agree. This event will bring back in their lifes people from the past, like Sharp's former girlfriend Sally Rose (Kim Basinger) and his old trainer Lightning Conlon (Alan Arkin) and McDonnen's long estranged son, BJ (Jon Bernthal). I will say no more about the story.

Most of the film is devoted to the preparation of ""The Grudgement Day"" and it is a really interesting, funny and charming thing! There is a lot of allusions to Rocky franchise (I never saw ""Raging Bull"" so if there are winks towards this film I missed them). Dialogs are smart, funny and rather classy - language is occasionally strong but it stays in the limits of reasonnable. All actors gave the maximum, each in his own personal style. Alan Arkin is particularly good. Kim Basinger, who in this film is 60 (!), is UNBELIEVABLY hot! Jon Bernthal, an actor gifted with the most handsome kind of ugly mug I saw in a long time, SHINES - I sincerely hope we will see him more. Gags are good and (with the exception of one short and lonely fart joke) never vulgar. Although most actors are old, this film is in no way geriatric - in fact it is quite refreshing, because really good comedies are not so frequently made in Hollywood those last years.

The fight is a surprisingly tense and very moving moment. I will say no more - you have to discover it by yourself.

Sorry for a little SPOILER here but I found particularly IRRESISTIBLE Sylvester Stallone playing an organic-life-style-tree-hugger-pacfist-amateur-of-art-nouveau. THAT IS AMAZING! You MUST see it!

To some extent this film reminded me of ""Stand Up guys"", a 2012 crime comedy, in which a geriatric crew made of Christoper Walken, Al Pacino and Alan Arkin (him again!) goes for a last hurrah. I liked ""Grudge Match"" better, but ""Stand Up guys"" is definitely not bad either.

Watch the credits to the end and you will be rewarded by a short sketch in which Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield appear in person, for a hilarious closing scene!

Bottom line, this is a merry, charming, well done comedy, with a strong scenario, good dialogs and a great show by talented actors. A recommended viewing. ENJOY!",1475107200,,2909,4.7713717693836974

Kevin Hart was a surprising delight in this one. Thankfully - since he can be a bit ""much"" - he was a minor part of the overall film.

Enjoyed the story, the scenery, and the characters. Good match, great end.

Let's face it, it's a boxing film about two very old men who beat the tar out of each other. I most identified with Sty's trainer.... His hearing aid comments were spot on. So despite being (at least?) 40 years younger, I connected with that dude. So I guess that makes me a cranky old man who can make strong men do stupid, crazy things.

6159491,1,B00HEQO9DM,"Alan Arkin plays Alan Arkin, once again milking the Crusty Old Man Cliche for all it's worth.  Sylvester Stallone plays Rocky Balboa as a 70-year old whose last bit of dignity is for sale for just a little bit of money- and no, I'm not talking about the purse.  Robert DeNiro sinks even lower because he has farther to fall- he also plays himself, and if this film worked from an actual screenplay I have no idea why.  Kim Basinger shows up for the same reason the other actors do- to pick up a paycheck while making a total fool of herself.  She's an asterisk in this film which is not necessarily a bad thing, since among the headliners she's most likely to be able to deny she was in this garbage and get away with it.  A few recognizable faces from HBO Sports and ESPN show up to play themselves, just like they have in the past in films far better than this one.

I managed to get through this entire film with effort, mainly by counting the hackneyed cliche's and doing a lot of grimacing and wincing.  This is just a bad experience and I can't imagine anyone enjoying anything about it.  Even DeNiro's little grandson comes off as fake- who would bring a little boy to watch his grandfather get punched for ten rounds?  Not really worth the one star.",1445731200,,1257,4.360515021459228

The humor in this movie is a little crude at times so I won't watch it around my kids... or grandparents... but it wasn't so bad that I had to turn it off.  Someone told me they would never watch this movie because it was a ""boxing"" movie but that's not really what it's about.  It's more about the rivalry between the two boxers and although the boxing part is a LARGE part of the movie it isn't overwhelming for people that don't care to watch boxing (in my opinion).

6159543,5,B00HEQO9DM,"I remember laughing when I saw the preview for this film, thinking that this has to be some sort of nutty spoof of ""Rocky vs Raging Bull"", the blend of the fictional (Rocky) and the historical (Jake LaMotta). Not only that, Stallone and De Niro were aged 66 and 69 years old respectively when this was released in late 2013. But the actors and producers stay away from cheap shot references to those predecessor films, and go for a regular, formulaic feel-good film about characters that are Rocky-like and Jake LaMotta-ish - this may seem silly, but the quality of the actors (Stallone and DeNiro, of course, with Alan Arkin, Kim Bassinger, and a bevy of amazing talents of all ages - including Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield in a pretty funny post-credits sequence) keep the film afloat. Nice! Of course, Stallone has already visited the aging-boxer-comes-back-for-just-one-more-fight in Rocky Balboa!

But while Rocky Balboa has a bit more art, this one has a bit more bling and doesn't take itself too seriously. There are goofy motion capture suits, grisly boxing titles like ""Grudgement Day"", and a silly black promoter who's not afraid of using old tricks (too bad - a weak character in the film); the same could be said of the final battle between the two old men, settling past grudges and battling gripes. There's some feel-good stuff, a whole bunch of brutality, and it's a wrap!!

The extras aren't great - there are six deleted scenes, five of which have brief intros by regular comedy director Peter Segal. ""Kid vs Jabby"" (0:42) shows De Niro tussling with the boxer puppet in his bar act after he gets razzed a few too many times for being fat. Funny! ""Callahan Interactive"" (0:33) is just silly, with one throwaway scene about a genius called Kenji. Whatever. ""The Rubdown"" (0:30) is a silly boner joke. ""If you don't have a hard-on, I'm gonna feel professionally insulted."" ""Iron Mike and the Real Deal"" (0:40) is a variant of the post-credits sequence between Mike Tyson and Evander Holyfield. ""Lightning's TV"" (1:30) is a pretty funny sequence where Razor meets his action figure (""This is stupid - I look like Lee Majors"") and Dante gets his feed dunked in horse piss (""I don't even know who that is""), although he's told it's ""vinegar"". Bad... A final ""autograph"" sequence between Stallone and three thugs (0:40) seems a bit to silly to be included in the movie.",1430265600,,2385,4.814634146341463
6159544,5,B00HEQO9DM,"This is a thoroughly enjoyable movie, with a few good laughs and a few tears.  The connection between Stallone and de Niro was believable and cogent, which it needed to be as the plot was virtually non-existent.

The interest is kept up all the way through, though I had to knock off a star because the correct ending was just after the fight.  Instead we got a few seconds of pointless afterrword. (or should that be after-video).

However, with the producers having the good sense to have Kim Basinger in the film, and allowing us to marvel at her beauty, then I put the star back. The final fight is as rough as can be, and the ending of it was brilliant.  Personally I thought the son was going to throw in the towel, but for once (?) I was wrong.  Talking of the son I predict that Jon Bernthall is going right to the top.

Not a great movie, but as an example of how human beings can mess their lives up by wrong perceptions, and still come out winning after 30 years, it takes a lot of beating,

It also takes a lot of guts for actors to look their age, and be vulnerable.  This does not apply to Kim Basinger, who looks as though she has not aged at all.",1429315200,,1162,4.174887892376682

I hate to write that, but what else can I say. Sadly, that was all I could focus on the entire time he was in the scene. He did a good job (as well as he can, I guess - I have never been a fan). De Niro was much better than some of the other films I have seen him in lately and I was happy his character showed some character towards the end of the film. Kim Basinger plays a woman in love with Stallone but who slept with De Niro and she looks as lovely as she did in the mid 80's in Nine and a Half Weeks! She hasn't changed a bit. Her character had a small but important role.

There are times that Hart succeeds, but many times it feels as if he is really forcing his craft to make you laugh.  I had never heard of this movie, but what I enjoyed most was some of the references to the Rocky series, that I absolutely loved.  I will watch just about anything with these actors listed and to see them together was good.  Not great, but good.

It took some talking but they got Stallone to do this flick about two senior citizens stepping back into the ring for a grudge showdown with a bitter rival played by Robert De Niro.  Stallone walked away from it all thirty years ago after knocking out De Niro in a rematch for he being ko'd in their earlier meeting.  This was the only blemish on each man's record.  Stallone had lost his money in the bad economy and went to work in the mills, while De Niro had made a bundle with a bar and a used car business.  A fast talking son, Kevin Hart, of the original promoter pins his future on getting the two in for a third fight.  A geezer match if you will.  Thanks to social media and the two disliking each other he actually pulls it off.  Not a great film, but entertaining to watch.  You don't have to stretch your imagination to follow the storyline.

Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone deliver some much-needed punch to stave off disaster, but this rematch was 15 years too late.",1417824000,,304,5.204081632653061
6159610,5,B00HEQO9DM,"Whoa!  I feel a ton of relief right now.  I was worried this movie would be a mockery of the classic Rocky films.  Like Sylvester Stallone would risk ruining his reputation and classic status after being a huge part of those legendary films.  Nothing like that thankfully!  Can't tarnish those classics!  I think Sylvester understood this and never would have accepted a potential Rocky-tarnishing character role.

Instead Grudge Match is about Robert De Niro and Sylvester Stallone coming out of retirement for one final showdown on the big stage.  The biggest boxing match they've had in years!  Robert's character is still sore that he was never able to defeat what is considered the best bout of all-time that the two had in the early 80's so he has nothing but revenge on his mind.  It's hilarious that 30 years later he's *still* thinking about revenge.  Makes me wonder if he spent *all those years* licking his chops in anticipation at a possible rematch, haha.

I'd say Grudge Match is a really awesome and hilarious movie.  The humor's not quite as zany as I was expecting (perhaps because Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro are ageing and wouldn't be able to keep up with a zany storyline) and due to the storyline (it turns out Robert De Niro once dated Sylvester's ex-girlfriend and had a son that Robert didn't know about until several years later) there's quite a bit of emphasis on drama as well.  You really want Robert to be a rational cool-headed guy who gets to know his son better, and later on because of the brilliant way the eventual boxing match develops, you want there to be a tie based on the way we've come to know both competitors and their life stories.  Believe it or not even though the focus is on boxing which technically makes Grudge Match a sports film, you will find yourself enjoying all the characters in the film, not just Sylvester and Robert.

There are a couple inconsistencies though.  For one thing it didn't make sense for the ex-girlfriend to not be upset with Sylvester after the two got into a car accident.  This is because Rocky... er, Sylvester apparently lost the vision in his one eye but he never mentioned this to her.  He never even pretended to be blind which is a flaw, but the bigger issue is why his ex wasn't the least bit upset with Sylvester.  I mean if you were involved in a car wreck and found out later the reason is because the driver had one blind eye, wouldn't you be pretty pissed about that?  Even if it's only scrapes and bruises and nothing serious, it's still unusual behavior on the ex-girlfriends part.  She should have been furious.

Also, after the boxing match is over (and I won't mention who won for obvious reason-  it would ruin the movie) it really made no sense that Robert would be the one to say a certain conclusive line to Sylvester.  It should have been the other way around.  You'll see what I mean when you watch the movie.  That is if you care enough to notice such a thing- it's a picky detail I admit.  I tend to notice the small things in films!

Still pickiness aside,  Grudge Match delivers.  It's hilarious, especially whenever Robert De Niro gets in a ring and boxes during training.  Either the jokes are based on his weight or the careless people that are training him, or the jokes poke fun at Robert's clumsy behavior.  Also the old man training Sylvester... he has a perverted side to his character!  Watching Sylvester pull those big vehicles in the dump yard... gotta love it.  Shades of the old Rocky huh!  I loved him a lot and was pulling for him to win the boxing match.

I could have done without Kevin Hart being obnoxious though.  Not particularly a fan of his comedic style in this movie.  Robert De Niro's son is quite the nice respectable man and a great addition to the story I thought.  Oh and there's a HUGE surprise before the credits roll.  Don't turn off the movie just yet!  I didn't think seeing those two together would ever happen again, haha.  I'm not spoiling this part!

Still, the movie is never far-fetched enough that it loses the meaningful storytelling it strives to deliver which makes this a very funny and well-meaning film.",1417824000,,4168,4.581867388362652

6159663,4,B00HEQO9DM,"Grudge Match ticks the box for those craving scenes of wild geriatric activity and perhaps old man boobs flapping. It finds De Niro and Stallone - two performers on opposite ends of the spectrum when it comes to their acting approach - at a more or less happy medium. Grudge Match banks on each actor's past cred built up on their having played boxers on cinema.

They play two tough Pittsburgh pugilists - and heated rivals - whose heyday was back in the 1980s. Henry ""Razor"" Sharp (Stallone) and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen (De Niro) each owns a stunning victory over the other. But with the highly anticipated third match in the offing, Razor inexplicably quits the sweet science, leaving in his wake untold riches, surefire fame, devastated fans, and a howlingly frustrated Kid McDonnen.

Today, on the 30th anniversary of what should have been, a young promoter (Kevin Hart) has a plan to resurrect the rematch. It'll take some luck. Oh, not concerning Kid McDonnen. After all these years, the cocky Kid still craves another shot at Razor, although he's moved on enough to found a car dealership and a restaurant. No, son, it's Razor, him what still wants no part of going back in the ring. Luckily for the promotor and for the Kid, Razor's steady factory gig ain't as steady as it's been.

The reluctant Razor brings a stipulation to the table. He tells the promoter he doesn't want to be in the same room as the Kid. But you can imagine how that caveat goes over. There's big fun in watching these hostile old dogs sharing camera time as they promote the big fight. My favorite of these spots is when they get interviewed during an MMA event.

Grudge Match was advertised as a straight-up comedy, but it's also got good dramatic content. We're left hanging for a bit with regards to why Razor retired all those years ago, but it's a reason that would drive the rest of the narrative. Stallone and De Niro are surprisingly sympatico; their screen chemistry is good. Stallone's is the more reserved role which makes sense since De Niro is obviously the more accomplished actor to pull off the more showy moments. De Niro must've had a blast playing the insensitive cad. And yet there's enough character development to him that, at the end, he comes off as an unsavory guy that's uncomfortably relatable and even sympathetic. He and Jon Bernthal - who plays his unexpected son - share several good scenes. Bernthal, by the way, is very solid as the more mature and grounded of the pair.

Stallone plays to his strength. He's laconic and world weary and leans on his physical presence. His personal trajectory is governed by his friendship with grumpy, old-timey trainer (Alan Arkin) and by the cautious re-entry of an old lost love (Kim Basinger).

Can The Kid and Razor get in fighting shape in twelve weeks? The movie gives us scenes in which they try their durndest, and these training scenes are worth a bunch of good chuckles. Stallone, for his age (what, 93 years old?), is in phenomenal shape. De Niro, meanwhile, is the brunt of many jokes about his ""fun bags."" Also, prep yourself for several comic nods to the Rocky series. 3.5 out of 5 for Grudge Match. I didn't expect it to be this watchable. I enjoyed the doctored footage of Razor and The Kid in their fighting prime as the movie opened. And the grudge match itself, which takes up the final 20 minutes or so - is wonderfully staged and looks pretty brutal. I like that you have no idea who'll win the fight. I like that the movie doesn't really go out of its way to favor one over the other as even the despicable Kid gets his moments of grace. But I knew who I was rooting for.",1411171200,,3645,4.58282208588957

6159666,3,B00HEQO9DM,"This movie felt like it was written by a stand up comedian in his late 40s/early 50s who still does his material from the 80s and think his Viagra joke is the height of hilarity.

Going into ""Grudge Match,"" I knew the jokes were going to be excruciatingly predictable (yes, they do a ""I've fallen and I can't get up"" joke) and it was obvious that Kevin Hart was included just to get the younger people to the theater but I wasn't prepared how the film, almost like an Alzheimer's patient, suddenly forgets that it's a wacky sports comedy about two old dudes settling a rivalry and suddenly becomes a way too heavy drama about two old dudes who are foolishly ignoring the real priorities in their lives. While a drama element was as expected as the terrible jokes, the drama portion became way too serious that you forgot that just a minute ago they were doing jokes about Bobbie De Niro having moobs.

Bad, easy jokes in the film aside, I honestly think the film's cast did a tremendous job. Sly and Bobbie really have some chemistry on screen and really come off as two rivals who are out to get under each other's skin and beat them to a pulp in the ring (even though we, as an audience, acknowledge that, realistically, Stallone would destroy De Niro due to the fact that Sly is still in really good shape). I also really enjoyed the chemistry between De Niro and Jon Bernthal as De Niro's character's son. Bernthal is already a terrific actor but the two really played well together. Finally, Alan Arkin, as usual, is amazing and is able to take the weak jokes and the times when Kevin Hart is trying way too hard to be funny and is able to turn it around and be amusingbut he's just a wizard like that.

Overall, ""Grudge Match"" is a weak, unfunny film (with some frightening CG at the beginning of the filmthey couldn't hire younger actors to play young Sly and De Niro? They had to use nightmare inducing computer effects?) but the cast works their magic and perform great despite the circumstances.

Greetings, Earthlings!

Grudge Match was filled with some good humor,drama,and boxing action. Definitely one of Stallone's best movies in the past ten years. What makes the movie is Robert De Niro. He was the one with more emotion and depth. Stallone plays the same old meathead boxer that he played in Rocky but only older. De Niro was perfect for picking on him and ridiculing him. Lots of old school actors as well like Alan Arkin,Kim Basinger. Also both De Niro and Stallone get to parody both of their iconic boxing characters. Another supporting actor that did a great job was John Bernthal that played De Niro's son. He has been in many shows and other movies and can play different characters as well. Kevin Hart wasn't bad at all too playing the promoter part like a young Don King. The plot was predictable but all actors had great performances. However Grudge Match was a box office bomb. The movie has a $40 million dollar budget and earned 45 worldwide. The youngest actor was probably Kevin Hart so unless you didn't grow up watching Stallone and De Niro movies or you're not fond of them,you wouldnt enjoy the movie as much.

It's a unique perspective and in my opinion a valuable one.

6159843,5,B00HEQO9DM,"the best movie ever! so funny ,great plot, the characters are lovable and the storyline creative. i was impressed with the script, and i laughed my butt off at kevin hart his character was great. deniro and stallone make a great combo working together and they took this role extremely serous and you can tell it on screen. and the ending is great as well it brings the movie and characters all together.",1403827200,,404,4.5479452054794525
6159844,4,B00HEQO9DM,"Good Movie.  If you like boxing movies like Rocky, you will enjoy this cute and fun movie. Somewhat predictable, but fun nonetheless.",1403740800,,133,5.045454545454546
6159845,3,B00HEQO9DM,"There has apparently been a mistake, because this movie should be titled ""Pudge Match"" cuz cuzzin deese bizzches be outta shape and pudgy yo!!!!",1403654400,,144,5.041666666666667
6159846,3,B00HEQO9DM,"You will enjoy the same story and 1980's drama that the Rocky series brought you but honestly, it is time for even the most popular actors to move into the 21st century and realize, that making sequel-like productions to films that ""wow-ed"" the audience over 30 years ago, isn't going to bring them the same results, respect or recognition in today's day and age. I say that with all due respect to the past but big names and faces don't sell tickets anymore because of films like this. It's a semi-enjoyable one-time see with an okay story and a good final fight but it definitely won't be making its way into your dvd player a second time around. You'll see...",1403654400,,662,4.525
6159847,4,B00HEQO9DM,"Great movie overall.  Both Stallone and De Niro play believable has been boxers that go in the ring one last time, with a good ending!  I would have rated it a five if they would have cut out the adult content and adult sexual references.",1403654400,,238,4.266666666666667
6159848,5,B00HEQO9DM,Ranks up there with Wild Hogs as one of the 'old timers' comedy movies. Watching them come out in those suits to make the video game had me rolling .... too funny. Good ending.,1403568000,,176,4.205882352941177
6159849,5,B00HEQO9DM,"Stallone and DeNiro, what can I say. Well done movie with a good story  line. After years of rivalry they finally get to have a match and the families are involved with the story line. Good watch.",1403568000,,196,4.297297297297297
6159850,4,B00HEQO9DM,Thank God for Robert DeNiro.....he carried the movie.  I would have given it 5 stars but Stallone was so woody in his acting as to be almost petrified.  Which in and of itself was funny....just sayin,1403568000,,199,4.5
6159851,3,B00HEQO9DM,Better than I thought it would be. Stallone is Stallone. DiNiro is convincing in his roll. Passed the time on my flight,1403568000,,119,4.454545454545454
6159852,4,B00HEQO9DM,Not the best but not the worst it had it's funny moments and overall I'd watch it again. If you like Sly and DeNiro then definitely give it a watch.,1403481600,,148,3.966666666666667
6159853,5,B00HEQO9DM,I would say there is a top rating with the quality of actors. also the story line was relevant. good comedy,1403395200,,107,4.142857142857143
6159854,3,B00HEQO9DM,"Forgettable, mildly entertaining movie is you have some popcorn handy and an hour and a half of NOTHING to do. Better than Star Wars Episodes I & II, if that helps.",1403222400,,164,4.32258064516129

6159859,4,B00HEQO9DM,"This movie delivers a solid story line with a few good twists.  It can be slow in one or two spots, but keep your interest.  Stallone is his usual stiff actor with De Niro providing a solid performance.  Would be a good film for teenagers up.",1402963200,,242,4.217391304347826

6159861,4,B00HEQO9DM,Fun to watch.  Kevin Hart is so funny.  He really carries the movie and keeps it moving. Would watch again,1402876800,,106,4.25
6159872,1,B00HEQO9DM,This movie was very short on story and human interest. A waste of talented actors. Vulgar humor to fill the void of a lean script.,1402876800,,130,4.24
6159873,5,B00HEQO9DM,"This movie was a lot funnier than I thought it would be.  I don't even remember it being out in theatres.  Kevin Hart was great; he stole the movie.  ""Zombie Shane"" was good too.  Tyson & Holyfield even make guess appearances.  Of course, De Niro & Stallone didn't disappoint; just don't expect a great plot or anything.  The only thing missing was Burt Young.  Alan Arkin was good, but I kept thinking, ""Where's Paulie?""",1402704000,,421,4.608108108108108
6159874,4,B00HEQO9DM,I laughed quite a bit during this movie.....I would say worth watching .....especially if you like Deniro or Kevin Hart.......,1402617600,,126,5.35

6159878,1,B00HEQO9DM,"PG13 was a poor rating for this flick. It was so coarse that we had to stop it only a few minutes in. Our 14 year old hears these things, but not condoned at out house!",1402099200,,168,3.6944444444444446
6159879,3,B00HEQO9DM,"This was a cute film. Slow at times and predictable. Good for a night when you want something on, but don't have to pay attention if you have laundry or bills to do, as you won't miss much if you have leave the room!",1402099200,,216,3.9318181818181817

6159893,5,B00HEQO9DM,"need I say more?  You know what you're going to get with this movie, and it delivers it perfectly.  I actually went into it thinking I would like it based on the previews and the fact that I love both Stallone and DeNiro, and I liked it even better than I thought I would.  A well written, well acted, and over very fun movie that I and my entire family (kids and all) enjoyed.  Stallone is having a fantastic late career resurgence (Rocky Balboa, Rambo, Escape Plan, Expendables series) and this film is no exception.  I saw it at the movie theater and bought it to watch whenever I want to at home.  Highly recommended!",1401753600,,621,4.356521739130435

6159895,5,B00HEQO9DM,"I was not exactly a fan of this movie. It was kind of fake and boring to me. It brought up some great points about older fighters. The only sport I like is boxing. And a lot of our favorites are kind of over the hill. But, I think the last Rocky said pretty much the same thing as this movie was saying.",1401753600,,303,3.8253968253968256

6159898,3,B00HEQO9DM,Not my favorite Robert DeNiro movie. It was ok but I wouldn't watch it again.  Sylvester still can't act.  It was more like a Rocky 9 movie.,1401408000,,140,4.148148148148148
6159899,5,B00HEQO9DM,"I enjoyed this movie very much. At times it sort of reminded me of ""Rocky"" but it kept me glued until the last of the movie. I thought I had guessed the ending right off, but I was very surprised as the movie went along and I hadn't guessed it at all. The actors/actresses were perfect for the parts. I would recommend this movie to my friends and family.",1401321600,,355,4.159420289855072
6159900,5,B00HEQO9DM,Robert DeNiro was so fresh and funny in this film. Some great boxing and a feel-good ending. I didn't think I'd like it but now I want to buy it for the library. Butterscotch Jellybeans were hysterical.,1401321600,,202,4.486486486486487
6159901,4,B00HEQO9DM,"But they get paid to watch movies and criticize what they themselves are unable to do, which is produce an original piece of art which is what Stallone and De Niro are able to do here because neither has ever done a boxing movie together It is what it is, and if you are fans of either it won't disappoint. But if it does, suck it up and move on with your life.",1401321600,,361,3.958904109589041

However, the story line seemed very familiar and I didn't have too much trouble figuring out the end.  In my mind I glossed over the improbable bits, suspended belief and allowed myself to be swept along with the action.  I needed an escape and I got one, mostly.",1401148800,,347,4.3076923076923075
6159913,2,B00HEQO9DM,It sucked pretty badly.  Was expecting way more from this movie.  Only gets 2 stars because deniro can be funny.,1401148800,,112,4.55
6159914,5,B00HEQO9DM,"Good mixture of serious and comedy.  The movie keeps your attention throughout.  Although the end is a bit predictable (a bit, there are a few surprises) its a fun movie to watch.  I don't recommend watching it with the kids due to some adult language.",1401148800,,252,4.555555555555555

6159916,3,B00HEQO9DM,I liked the movie. But in my opinion it had a weak story line. To see the older actors was great! After all not all of is get the priveledge to reach old age. And Hollywood does not celebrate older actors. I could watch this movie with my younger boys. Only a few cuss words.,1401062400,,275,4.0181818181818185

6159936,3,B00HEQO9DM,The only thing that saved this movie from me  giving it one lonely star was Kevin Hart. Kevin Hart a truly a talented comedian/actor. I'm glad I didn't waste money going to see this in the theater as I'd plan on doing.,1400371200,,218,4.190476190476191

6159941,4,B00HEQO9DM,"This movie was pretty good, though a bit predictable. DeNiro was by far the scene stealer. The pace of the movie was brisk, and laced with lots of Rocky references. You have to suspend belief to accept the premise that two very old men, including one blind in one eye, could get a fight sanctioned. Probably worth the price... and I'm pretty ""frugal.""",1400284800,,351,4.587301587301587

For a movie night this would be a winner!",1400198400,,341,3.56
6159955,4,B00HEQO9DM,"This movie is really just another recap of Stallone Rocky franchise, with cameo of long forgotten scenes (with aged Stallone).  The movie never pretends to be anything more than that, which you should know from the posters.  Accepting it for what it is makes more enjoyable.  The story is pretty predictable, but again this movie is for the old quotes.  The entire ""Rocky"" environment is reminiscent of his first ""Rocky"" movie:  old house in run-down neighborhood, no TV, and a rotary phone (a relic).

The movie is funny in a sense of old dogs still kicking it but said at the same time as you see your childhood buff heroes grow old and saggy with age.  A true realization that aging is all but inevitable.",1400112000,,708,4.616

I purchased this movie simply because of the actors but was very impressed that this movie was well written.  There was a defined story about DeNiro and Stallone's past and the movie ends by the two characters finally putting the past behind them.

This movie was worth purchasing.

In this well crafted film about two ""past their prime"" boxers who get the chance at a rematch thirty years after scoring one for one against each other that's exactly what happens.

 THE PLOT IS NOT A BRAIN DRAIN.

 IN FACT THE PLOT IS NOT VERY BELIEVABLE- BUT HEY, THIS IS HOLLYWOOD :-)

YOU CAN JUST SIT BACK ON YOUR SOFA AND LET IT  UNFOLD AND NOT BE FORCED  TO HAVE CONCENTRATE TOO HARD TO FIGURE OUT WHAT IS GOING ON.

 IT WAS REFRESHING THAT THERE WERE MORE THAN A FEW LAUGHS AND THEY CAME ALL FROM OUR  TYPICAL STRAIGHT MAN, DENIRO.

YES- GO FIGURE!  SURPRISINGLY HE IS THE FUNNY ONE IN THIS MOVIE  !

TO BE HONEST, I REALLY WAS EXPECTING A MEGA BOMB BUT THE FAMILY WANTED TO SEE IT.

STALLONE WAS VERY WOODEN IN THIS ROLE.  AND HE LOOKED LIKE A MESS.  NOT SURE WHAT THAT WAS ABOUT. BUT HE ACTUALLY LOOKED SICK.

 BASINGER IS A KEY FIGURE AND NOT JUST SOME EYE CANDY.  YOU WILL LEARN WHY AS THE MOVIE UNFOLDS.

SO FOR ME, THIS WAS A PLEASANT SURPRISE.

THE SURPRISE BEING THAT I DID NOT FEEL LIKE I WAS SUFFERING THROUGH ANOTHER BAD DENIRO MOVIE( AND I AM A BIG DENIRO FAN, SO I GET A BIT ANNOYED WITH HIM WHEN HE TAKES CRAPPY ROLES JUST TO PAY THE BILLS)

Hollywood is running out of idea's today! My generation we didn't hear all that cussing and swearing I mean really!.. Anyway I give it a 4-5 due to the offensive cussing and swearing..

6160045,3,B00HEQO9DM,"Love Stallone and DeNiro so figured a Rocky VS Raging Bull comedy would be enjoyable if not a classic.  But Grudge Match was a weird movie.  From the opening's really poor de-aging F/X to the crammed in lost family subplots, GM just didn't know what it wanted to be.  I understand throwing in some drama and character moments but come on, we already had Rocky Balboa for that.  DeNiro gets some laughs though as loud mouth Kid looking for a rematch against Stallone's quiet and lovelorn Razor.  In the end, it's worth a rental to see the two legends go head to head as funny old men acting like children.  Hopefully this means we get DeNiro in Expendables 4.",1398038400,,658,4.487394957983193

Grudge match was actually funnier than I expected with Kevin Hart providing much of the comic relief in the movie.  The movie even pokes a little fun at Stallone's first Rocky movie.  The biggest issue to me with the movie is that it couldn't really decide if it wanted to be funny or serious, sometimes taking itself a bit too seriously.

However with that being said, it did provide enough laughs and even though the plot was a bit improbable was entertaining enough to watch. 3.5 stars.",1397952000,2,662,4.483333333333333

6160051,3,B00HEQO9DM,"In Grudge Match Sylvester Stallone and Robert De Niro play retired rival boxers in Pittsburgh, Henry ""Razor"" Sharp and Billy ""The Kid"" McDonnen, who once again come back to the ring, fighting their long-delayed grudge match. Kevin Hart is a loud-mouthed promoter, and Alan Arkin plays Razors aging trainer. There is also a dramatic subplot with Kim Basinger as Razors former girlfriend Sally Rose.

Despite some critics' complaints about the casting  two veteran actors known for iconic roles Rocky Balboa and Jake LaMotta  Grudge Match is not a cheap self-parody or Rocky/Raging Bull sendup. Directed by Peter Segal (50 First Dates Get Smart), the comedy, or dramedy, is amusing and pleasant to watch, though it takes itself very seriously during the boxing scene.

The problem with the film is the clich-ridden script in the mid-section of the story. The 113-minute movie would be much better without some uninteresting supporting characters and boring episodes. Still, Grudge Match is an enjoyable comedy drama with a few nice jokes and some interesting cameos by real-life boxers.",1397865600,2,1084,5.2485549132947975

6160067,4,B00HEQO9DM,"When I saw the trailer for this film a while back I thought it might be worth a few laughs. Then I read some really harsh reviews for it and thought "" well these guys have picked a few clunkers during their careers, maybe this is one of them?"" Despite some bad scripts they usually give it their all so.......

I decided to rent this and give it a shot. I wasn't expecting Citizen Kane not even Rocky Balboa, but I was surprised how much I enjoyed this movie. It was nothing like I expected which was a "" dumb dumb comedy"" with some really stupid dialogue and stale jokes about arthritis etc.

What was expected to be a flat out comedy (names like Kevin Hart in the cast solidified this) turned out to be a sweet endearing little film about two ex boxers who hate each other for various reasons, but end up coming to terms with their differences and in the end gain each others respect.

Grudge Match isn't going to win any awards, but if you like the cast (Alan Arkin is golded here!) and can just relax and take the ride, you will probably enjoy this film.  You'll never see ""The Rock"" and ""The Raging Bull"" in the ring together again....unless this movie somehow makes a ton of money? ;-)  The Blu Ray look and sounds great with some interesting song choices. If you like the actors and keep your expectations low, you might find this to be a decent rental. I might even buy it when the price comes down.",1397779200,,1407,4.29433962264151

Stallone and Deniro became legends in the movie industry with Stallone in Rocky and Deniro in Raging Bull.

The movie shows that no matter what your dream is in life, that your dream will never die. Its always there in the past, present, and future. In this movie these two boxers get the chance to relive their dreams and try to correct some of the choices and mistakes they made as youner men now in the present day.

The film is somewhat formulaic but if you give in to its charms you will enjoy it immensely.  The actors are uniformly excellent and Sylvester Stallone more than stands his own with Robert De Niro.  If you saw Stallone in Walter Hill's ""Bullet to the Head"" you will appreciate the rebirth of the Stallion in his golden years  Good supporting cast includes Kim Basinger as the love interest and Kevin Hart as the promoter for the proposed bout between the adversaries.

6160146,3,B00HEQO9DM,"I wanted to like this, in fact tried to get to the theater, and some of the jokes are very funny, especially the humiliating promotional stunts the guys have to do to promote the fight.

Then there are the jokes that are funny the FIRST time, but the fifth time? The way the writers beat the jokes to death you'd think they were ex L.A.P.D.

There are way too many plot points and they are ALL film school cliches that the producers should have chopped if the writers didn't. On page 12 THIS should happen, on page 21 THIS should happen. SNORE, SNORE, SNORE... It's too bad, because there's a good, funny movie buried in here somewhere. This script feels about 60 pages too long.

That said, the fight scene at the end is very well shot and choreographed, much more effort was put into it then I was expecting (veteran Dean Semmler (sic) is the photog. Alan Arkin gets some of the best lines (though the ADR is shaky, a lot of the good lines are either lost or stepped on in the mix). The references to ""Rocky"" and ""Raging Bull"" are generally funny and not too overdone, though I've seen some complaints.

Stallone works in The Expendables because he is essentially the straight man for the wack-jobs on his team, and his pained reactions and one-liners work and are funny because they are used sparingly. In Grudge, he has too much screen time and not enough to do and the script is too repetitive with what there is. De Niro is of course De Niro, no surprises here. Kim Basinger is, well, Kim Basinger. Don't expect any actual acting.

I'm bummed, because the trailer was funny, both the leads are charismatic and charming, the concept is fun because of the unspoken concept of Rocky and Raging Bull. Quite disappointed.

Writers are always complaining about getting screwed in Hollywood. In Grudge Match, the writers screw us, the poor slobs paying the freight. The producers and director share the blame, because they let the writers get away with it. Sigh. Strictly a rental.",1397088000,2,1980,4.594900849858357

The racial jokes about that black promoter were a bit annoying such as him sending his son to private school so he can be more like whites.

6160166,5,B00HEQO9DM,"I won't Go into a ton of detail as I usually do. This is what you have in this movie.  You have an All Star cast, De Niro, Stallone, Alan Arkin, and Kevin Hart.  The chemistry between all of these actors was just perfect. It was a comedy, which I am  not a huge fan of, and it was also serious. It also takes on many other topics concerning sports, fatherhood, forgiveness, love, woman, children, and of course boxing. But you don't have to know anything about boxing or sports to understand this movie.

This movie in short is funny and most of all so much fun!!!  I cant remember when I said or thought to myself a movie was fun. I did not want it to end.  If you are watching this and taking it to seriously, or if you have more of a stoic sense of humor this is not for you. If you are fun, out going, and enjoy people this is absolutely for you. It is not for children. There are parts that have a touch of bad language but in my life, it would not be noticed one bit. This movie is something I promise you will laugh out loud, and you will want to see it more then once.  I will say Kevin Hart adds to this movie in a huge way. I never knew he was this funny.  If you rent the one with bonus features you understand what I mean.  I don't want to give it away, so I am leaving a lot out.  I cant even imagine there is not tons of people who love at least one of these actors work. Kim Basinger is also in it. She plays her role perfect.  It is an easy movie, nothing epic, nothing to serious even though there are topics in here that are. They are able to pull off humor all the way through. I think it is just a must see if you want some fun, and you want to laugh.  These are legends on the screen, and they are all having fun. There are some surprises in the film as well that they don't advertise. I won't say what. But you should really give this movie a chance. Don't listen to anything negative in reviews.  If you like these actors?  Then you have to see it.  You will come away feeling good, and most of all, laughing really hard. I think that is priceless.  I loved it and happy I bought it.  If you want to know what it is about, watch the trailer, or just the title alone. That is the main theme.  Two fighters who had one win a piece.  The rubber match, or the third match would decide who was better.  That is the theme. But so much more happens.

6160185,4,B00HEQO9DM,"I would've laughed had someone asked me that thirty years ago. Heck, a little as five years ago. But as Stallone has reached the twilight of his career, I began to look back on his progression as an actor. And it struck me that I had seen this before - in The Duke.

Consider this: It's the spring of 1970. The Academy Awards are being presented.

In what was without question the peak of The Anti-Establishment Movement and the nexus of liberal America - Hollywood - for his indelible and unforgettable work in '<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/True-Grit-1969/dp/B000ID1VYS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">True Grit (1969)</a>', the academy presented The Best Actor statue to none other than John Wayne.

John Wayne. The embodiment of The Establishment. The very object of derision across the social spectrum in 1970. He won for Best Actor.

Why?

Why would Hollywood - the heart and soul of counterculture - give that man the top award for male thespians? He should have been shunned, laughed out of contention, but wasn't. He beat out Peter O'Toole, Richard Burton, and BOTH Jon Voight and Dustin Hoffman - only the second time in history the Academy nominated two male leads in the same film.

John Wayne came up on top. He won.

Why?

Because despite all the rhetoric, all the anger over the war in Vet Nam, and the passion of the liberals - even they saw that the man had delivered a superlative performance. Maybe the best performance of his entire career.

That kind of dispassionate objectivity - sadly lost to us nowadays - is what defines iconic film. John Wayne earned the Best Actor Oscar for a wonderful performance. Period. None of the extraneous civil discord had anything to do with one actor in one film. The man who had become the very representation of ""everything wrong"" had stepped outside his own cultural shadow and delivered.

So, just like we use the name ""Rambo"" as a laughable verb and snide adjective - I look at Stallone - the actor.

He's not the same man he was a generation ago. Shockingly, he's become an actual thespian. I don't think general audiences, who are distracted more than ever, has really looked at him in a role for a while now. Admittedly, he's not likely to ever win a competitive acting Oscar. But has he, over the past decades, learned enough of the craft to present a believable character? Has he the skill to step into the life of a fictional person and make it seem real?

Yes.

So I offer this film recommendation. A very decent movie with Oscar winners De Niro, Basinger, and the eternal Alan Arkin (one of my all-time favorite actors) delivering in another solid Peter Segal vehicle. No big surprises, the retread plot one that has been done a thousand times before - but in this film - done with excellence. Also props to Josh Bernthal, glad to see him moving up from the small screen. Notice, I didn't say ""walking"" toward a brighter future. <g>

Personal Notes:

- I won't spoil the hilarious cameos. But if you're a fan of real-life grudge matches - trust me - worth every penny to see this flick. <rofl>

- Why they didn't get Tommy Hearns and Marvin Hagler into the production is a sad mystery.",1392508800,5,3189,4.76043557168784

That is one of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I walked out after one hour. I am surprised that I gave it that much attention? We all have done phone sex in our lives, so why would anyone want to watch a movie about phone sex? Plus, ""Her"" just dragged, and dragged until I finally woke up and could not take it anymore.

The third match didn't happen because Razor quit boxing and eventually went to work in the steel mills. The Kid went on to become a successful business man. The film makes Razor the good guy and The Kid the bad guy. Sally ( Kim Basinger ) was the reason for rift that existed between the two boxers. Years later Razor needs money and is offered money for the match which he reluctantly accepts.

The film slightly builds off their old boxing movies, but is hardly a spoof. In fact that was the best part of the film, and they opted to limit it. The script was as unconvincing as ""Last Vegas"" with both film having too much drama.
