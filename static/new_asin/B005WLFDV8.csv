8487999,1,B005WLFDV8,"No one mentioned that the DVD is ""Regions Locked"". It won't play on ANY DVD or Blu Ray player I, or anyone I know's, Player or even on the PS3-4. SO basically I wasted $100. Not Happy.",1479081600,7,184,4.0
8488000,5,B005WLFDV8,"I have wanted the Tex Avery set ever since I started collecting all of my favorite classic cartoons from my childhood. I did not get it initially because I didn't know it was available. Then I didn't get it because it was region 2. I did not yet know about region free players or that you could play any regions disc on a computer. When I finally found that an all region player could be bought here on Amazon inexpensively, my world of entertainment broadened tremendously. After first buying all of my Disney Treasures as deliriously inexpensive imports, I finally ordered my coveted Tex Avery box set. It is beautiful. I love the pretty tin it is packed in. And the cartoons are wonderful. They look good. Not as bright and vivid as the Looney Tunes Golden Collection since they have not been remastered but very good. There are a few edits but they do not affect the ability to enjoy them. I have not seen most since I was a kid in the 70s. Saw a few in late 80s on Cartoon Network but was a young working adult and never had time to watch much. So the few edits are hardly noticeable because it's been decades since seeing them unedited. This set is so totally awesome. Every person who has a classic cartoon dvd/blu ray collection needs this. This and the Looney Tunes Golden Collection are must haves for everyone. I am 48 years old and begin each day with classic cartoons before work, just as I started my school days back in the day.",1427155200,11,1443,4.408239700374532
8488001,4,B005WLFDV8,"Nobody has mentioned the video quality of the cartoons on this set yet.  The cartoons look good.  They don't appear to have been restored and aren't quite as beautiful as the Platinum Looney Tunes or Golden Tom and Jerry set, but they certainly look better than I've ever seen them on tv.  There are light film scratches but nothing distracting.  ""King Size Canary"", a true masterpiece, looks beautiful.  The sound is great.

The French subtitles are optional. I put the discs in my region free player and the subtitles never appeared. On the selection screens the words are in both French and English. Once the cartoons start playing you can't tell it's a French import.

The main reason I subtracted a star is that some of the cartoons are censored, which is unacceptable.  For example in ""Lucky Ducky"" when the small dog holds a shotgun shell in his hand close to his face to inspect it and it subsequently explodes, there should be a blackface gag but it's not included.  In one of the Wolf cartoons the Wolf wants to give a present to sexy Red.  It should be a carton of cigarettes but they make it a case with a jewel necklace instead.  There are other instances as well. These cartoons are an original American art form and should never be censored, especially since they are a product of their time.  Other than this objection the set is very enjoyable.  Tex Avery was a master.  Although this set isn't perfect, it's likely to be the best we'll ever get.",1424649600,8,1463,4.576923076923077
8488002,5,B005WLFDV8,"Holy, this is the best Tex Avery DVD set yet. Worth every penny, as there are cartoons you in this set you can't get anywhere else.

You need a multi-region DVD player for your TV. I was also able to plug the DVD into my laptop, and it worked perfectly.",1413676800,,253,4.06
8488003,5,B005WLFDV8,great set .  I had been waiting for this set for a long time This set has every cartoon from my laser set with the exception of a couple that would be considered racist stereotypes by today's standards.  I wish that an American version had been available for people without region free players.,1407628800,3,294,4.528301886792453
8488004,5,B005WLFDV8,"Awesome DVD set Funny Cartoons from the man who first animated Bugs Bunny
Be sure your DVD Bluray player is Region free
Mine is so no problem",1388966400,5,141,4.2592592592592595
8488005,5,B005WLFDV8,"I have waited for this Avery collection on DVD. No dice. A ridiculous price from overseas. So, I bought the VHS and will transfer it to a DVD. Simple huh? I remember Little Red Riding Hood from my teen years. Loved it then and love it today.",1357862400,15,241,4.148936170212766
