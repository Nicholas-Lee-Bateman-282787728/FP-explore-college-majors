2481558,5,B000E1NXHM,"This is a must see comedy regardless of one's ethnic identity or geographic location. Everyone's family has its oddballs, secrets, oldtimers and meals from hell. Well-written and well-acted you will be laughing in the aisles or, if at home, falling off your lounger.",1121817600,8,266,5.209302325581396
2481579,2,B000E1NXHM,"'A Wake In Providence' is certainly going to appeal to some more than others and while I enjoy a good ethnic comedy, especially one that happens to be poking fun at my own background, I found this film to have more misses that hits. Some of the best laughs come from a young Asian boy who is brought up by an Italian family and his delivering of many familiar phrases is hilarious. Unfortunately the rest of the film is not as consistent.

The cast is good and the Italian family is spot on, but there are only scattered laughs. I've seen this all before and done better. The interracial relationship seems like an after thought and seems a little out of place.",1281830400,,661,4.418032786885246
2481580,4,B000E1NXHM,I couldn't stop laughing while watching this movie. It was better than I thought it was going to be :),1260230400,,102,4.15
2481581,4,B000E1NXHM,I loved this movie.  It was a hillarious take on the topic of interracial dating and I would recommend this movie to everyone.,1251331200,,126,4.478260869565218
2481582,5,B000E1NXHM,So insightful as well as being uproariously funny in depicting the universal dymamics of tightly woven family units.  It is a timeless commentary.,1243123200,,146,5.3478260869565215
2481583,4,B000E1NXHM,"This little indie is a delightful surprise.  The acting, writing and directing are first-rate.  We laughed outloud throughout.  Wonderful standout performances by Victoria Rowell and Adrienne Barbeau, but Billy Van Zant and John Mariano as two clueless brothers damn near steal every scene they're in. Hysterical!",1240531200,,313,5.760869565217392
2481584,4,B000E1NXHM,"I have already sent in review to you about a week or so ago.

The movie was good, but the plastic case it came in was mutilated; broken and pieces missing.  I had to put rubber bands around case to keep it in one piece.

All in all, I am very satisfied with the  movie, but I think a little care should be taken when you send a movie out - because no one appreciates having to keep rubber bands on a movie to keep it in the case.

Thank you,

Carole Peck",1239494400,,454,3.827956989247312
2481585,3,B000E1NXHM,Somehow under the radar. This film is a charming and raucous indie by a promising director.,1237680000,,91,4.75
2481586,5,B000E1NXHM,"As an Italian/American...this is the cutest movie.  I bought copies for my children to keep..and to watch with ""their"" children...so they have a fun sense of the generation that might be gone when our grandchildren are grown.  It is a wonderful, very funny, heartwarming view into the complications of growing up with lots of Italian relatives around.  Those who understand will see their own relatives reflected  in this film comedy about an Italian family gathering from near and far for their grandfather's funeral.",1237593600,,518,5.204819277108434
2481587,5,B000E1NXHM,"I missed this movie in theaters but my wife and her friend happened to catch it.  I kept hearing how I needed to see this movie so when it finally became available on DVD I bought it right away.

I do have to admit, since my wife and I differ a bit on movies I was skeptical when I first started watching it but I was very nicely suprised.  This movie is not only funny and entertaining but the writing is superb and the cast of characters are wonderful.  I'm not Italian but I could still see my own family in these characters and it captured some of the quirkiness of Rhode Island very well.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who are looking for a good laugh no matter if you're from Rhode Island or from an Italian family.  This movie is good fun all around.",1228176000,,767,4.148648648648648
2481588,5,B000E1NXHM,"I had the opportunity to see ""A Wake in Providence"" in Rhode Island where most of it was filmed and I am excited that I can now purchase it on DVD. The title of this film implies that it would be a dark film, quite the contrary.  This film had to be one of the funniest films I have seen in a long time, especially being of Italian descent, I could definitely identify with the film. But it doesn't matter what ethnic group you belong to because you can imagine your family members in that situation and find yourself busting into laughter at the various antics portrayed in the film.  I would guess that most people who see this film would identify the characters with their own individual family members, but when you can identify the characters with the real individuals that the characters were based, makes it even funnier. Yes, the Pagano brothers are from Rhode Island and not only did they utilize their late grandfather's home in the film, they also used the first names of many relatives for the characters. The Pagano brothers capitalized on the rich Italian traditions, quirkyness, and drama surrounding wakes and funerals, and blended them into a very entertaining film. The acting was excellent, Victoria Rowell was outstanding as the girlfriend, and the plot very realistic. This was also the first ethnic ""Italian"" film where the food at the house was truly an accurate representation of not only Italian food, but the Italian lifestyle, and the importance of family and food. So, no matter what ethnic group you belong to, plug your own family members into the characters, think of your own traditions and be prepared to laugh, and laugh.  This is a definite film worth watching if you need a laugh.",1171584000,12,1716,4.7324414715719065
8104206,1,B000E1NXHM,Took five minutes to read.  Just a short story.  The kindle store does not tell you how many pages the book has.  I know this was done for charity but I still felt a bit let down.  I hope the author can invest the time to write a full book one day.,1441843200,,248,3.7115384615384617

8104210,3,B000E1NXHM,"It was a very fast movie not what i thought it would be ,although it did teach you not to judge anyone no matter who they are or what they are.",1398556800,,143,3.6451612903225805
8104211,2,B000E1NXHM,"Someone told me they saw this movie on t.v. and that it was cute. I order it, not paying attention to the rating. It should have said, ""FOR SAILORS ONLY!"". I was shocked when the first lines in the movie were nothing I would ever even call someone I was really mad at! For that reason, the whole movie was distasteful, and basically stupid. Any cuteness got lost in the profanity. Not for me. Too many really good movies out there to waste time on this.",1381190400,,453,4.27906976744186
8104212,5,B000E1NXHM,"if your are italian you will really relate to your heritage ,we have watched this at least 5 times since we bought this movie.",1368576000,,126,4.291666666666667
8104213,5,B000E1NXHM,"Thought this was a very funny movie.  Have a question, does anyone know if this DVD comes in closed caption",1367712000,,107,4.35
8104214,4,B000E1NXHM,"The main reason I got this is because I am a huge Adrienne Barbeau and as always she made the most of this part.  The movies focus is the funeral of an families Patriarc and it moves slow but is a wonderful look behind the personalities, quirks and predjudice.  I know people like this and it was a great way to spend a few hours.",1315612800,,330,4.061538461538461
8104215,4,B000E1NXHM,Great local film!! Most of or if not all of it was filmed in Providence and the surrounding areas. If your a Rhode Islander you will appreciate this film. See how many locations you recognize.,1288051200,,192,4.514285714285714
