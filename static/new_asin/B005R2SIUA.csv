8484031,5,B005R2SIUA,"This is a movie no one seems to know, and it's a little treasure, a gem, not to be overlooked.  Children will love it, but the conversation that Spring Byington (wonderful in this movie, as always) and Peter Lawford (at his most dreamy) have with Butch Jenkins near the end of the film, when Jenkins is sick in bed, is one of the most profound bits of wisdom on film.  They are explaining to him that everything--everything--that happens to us is for our good, and it's done in a way that a child can understand, but every adult heart can receive and find peace in.  A beautiful movie.",1484092800,,585,4.398148148148148
8484032,5,B005R2SIUA,"saw this little treasure a while back on tcm when robert osborne introduced it, but can't remember all the nice things he had to say about it.  it is such a lovely little film and has more to say than just the story about a boy who can talk to horses.  think all ages will enjoy this movie.  i love it and am glad it's in my film library.",1452211200,,338,3.869565217391304
8484033,3,B005R2SIUA,"This is a nice little family film, but is not by any means a classic.  Lawford and Tyler make an attractive couple in the leads but Butch Jenkins is not any Margaret O'Brien.  The kid was okay as an actor and certainly was not given the part on his looks either.  Mostly the best acting here comes from the horses who rub and sniff the kid at all the right moments.  The story focuses on Jenkins' ability to communicate with animals and his family's financial woes, mainly those of Lawford who wants to marry Tyler.  Spring Byington is her usual kooky self, but not quite as entertaining here.  For young kids it is a nice film and if you like Lawford or Tyler you will probably enjoy it some, but it is merely an okay film.  For a much better horse movie see ""Home in Indiana"" with Jeanne Crain and Walter Brennan.",1389916800,,815,4.322368421052632
