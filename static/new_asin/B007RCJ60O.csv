 Reminds of modern day Democrats in the US and the tactics they try towards the right.
  Must buy, cool show!!",1515628800,,246,4.809523809523809
8521321,5,B007RCJ60O,The Nazi Titanic was a great documentary.  It goes hand in hand with the book on tape of the sinking of the Lusitania.  The order came in as advertised and the shopping experience went very well.,1506384000,,195,4.388888888888889
8521322,5,B007RCJ60O,"The story of the SS Cap Arcona aka Hitler's Titanic, may be even more astounding than the story of the Titanic itself!  The Arcona was used as a stand-in for the Titanic in the 1943 Nazi propaganda film of the story. What the Nazis did not know was that the German filmmaker was making a statement against the Nazis and not the British. It gets more astounding in every phase until the unbelievable conclusion and tragedy that tops the tale of the Titanic. Highly recommended.",1480550400,2,476,4.6
8521323,5,B007RCJ60O,"I saw this on the History Channel and enjoyed it so much I bought the DVD. I am especially fascinated with the color home movies of Selpin and Zerlett together. It's a fascinating true story of the drama around the making of the Nazi Titanic film on a huge budget with the personalities of Goebbels, Selpin and Zerlett. Very engrossing and brings you back to that unique historic era.",1433721600,2,384,4.579710144927536
