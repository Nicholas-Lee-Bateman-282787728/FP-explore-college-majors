8446557,5,B004X9ZQOY,"What a well told  ""story behind the story""! The feud between Tito and Chuck helped push the UFC forward to a bigger stature.  Dana White is quoted in the documentary saying, ""We were bleeding money...."" and Tito seemed to want to hold out for a bigger paycheck and in doing so, he came across as afraid of Chuck Liddell. Was he? You be the judge.",1386547200,,346,4.3076923076923075

8446560,4,B004X9ZQOY,"With ""Bad Blood,"" UFC -- which became famous because of its raw barbarity -- is treading into WWE territory.  WWE is 98% fake, which is what attracts a mainstream audience to it.  UFC is supposed to be 100% real, but its president Dana White understands that people are attracted to a fight if there's a storyline alongside it, and in ""Bad Blood"" Dana White tries to imagine an intense rivalry between Tito Ortiz and Chuck Liddell where none really exists.

Regardless of its bloated attempt at melodrama, ""Bad Blood"" is still an entertaining watch because Tito Ortiz is such a consummate showman.  The conflict is between Ortiz who represents the cynical side of the ultimate fighting business, and thinks he's an actor and a businessman before he is a fighter.  And then there's Liddell who represents UFC purity, and does what he does just because he enjoys hurting people.  The documentary -- because it is ultimately about promoting UFC to a general audience -- celebrates Liddell's purity while mocks Ortiz's cynicism, and in the end Dana White points out that Liddell now makes more money than Ortiz because Liddell, much more so than Ortiz, obeys Dana White.

Well, we now know how to make it in the UFC.",1343520000,,1212,4.798076923076923

Only thing I can complain about is that the dvd  was scratched.",1322870400,,131,4.2
8446563,5,B004X9ZQOY,"A great inside look for UFC fans of one of the Greatest Rivals in the sport Tito and Chuck! You get to see an inside look into both mens lives prior to stardom. You get to hear their side of the story as to what led two friends and training partners into a dark and bitter hatred. You also get their 2 fights as a bonus, which is always great to relive!

The UFC has done an outstanding job and packaged this as a Digibook, full of colorful pages and facts about both fighters. I found this well worth the asking price and am looking forward to the Matt Hughes release later this month.",1315872000,6,586,4.140350877192983
