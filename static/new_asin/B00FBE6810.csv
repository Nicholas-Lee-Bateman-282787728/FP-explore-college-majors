5974058,3,B00FBE6810,"The pros: its a real movie, production values as expected, with actual acting, so definitely not in the horrorible subgenre. But it had 1 element in common with those movies. The story was thin. Very thin. It feels like these types of films are made by crafting scenes around the treatment, as opposed to an actual fully completed script. In this movie, the story is about how 1 family's trauma affects each sibling, all daughters. Good premise, good idea, but not fully developed or executed. For instance, the movie dragged up until the climax. The daughters carried a ton of potential for dramatic tension , individually and collectively, (1 was a felon, the other a stripper, and the third an addict with a high level dealer boyfriend; the latter was a half sister actually, and her existence was key to the family trauma). But it was only hinted at, with the same flashback sequence shown repeatedly. The dialogue between them did not feel genuine to me, meaning I would not imagine real people in their shoes using the language the actors had to deliver. It didn't fit and it distracted me. Anyway, not much happened, in terms of setting up any tension I could feel, .post arrival at the house and the climactic sequence. The 2 actual events that started to were dispatched posthaste. Then I was back to the same old, same old. Once the climax arrived, it was good, though the style of dialogue carried on till the bitter end. So, while it was better than much of what I've seen lately, it could've been so much better and it was so noticeable to me that I couldn't help but thinking it as I was watching. Still, worth a watch for horror junkies in these days of prohibition.",1403049600,4,1681,4.6066666666666665
5974059,3,B00FBE6810,Too predictable. But still enjoyable. I would like to have seen Ms. Katz have more of a major role. Worth watching.,1395360000,,115,4.523809523809524
5974060,5,B00FBE6810,Our niece stars in this movie as a younger version of one of the main stars.  We ordered through this cellar because it was hard to find but they were fabulous and shipped fast.,1391817600,,177,4.205882352941177
5974061,4,B00FBE6810,"Three sisters decide to steal some drugs, sell them, and escape from their mistake filled lives. Sirah (Sadie Katz) is a stripper/prostitute. She actually steals the drugs from her boyfriend (Clint Jung). Teig (Heather L. Tyler) has two strikes. She is the brains of the operation. Fawn looking Lily (Cheryl Sands) is the younger half sister. She has a different mother and a drug problem.

The three girls hold up in the two older sister's childhood home, one that is filled with bad memories of an abusive father and a mother who died in the house. All three girls feel and see ghosts. At 48 minutes into the film the ""incident"" is explained.

This is a fairly well acted film, although as a scary ghost story it could of had some build up. For the guys there is plenty of eye candy scenes.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Heather L. Tyler, Sadie Katz, and Cheryl Sands- thank you Cheryl)",1389398400,6,880,4.592356687898089
5974062,5,B00FBE6810,"Great film! Suspenseful and well-written with fantastic performances by a cast of incredibly attractive actresses, building suspense and looks incredible. One of the best indie horror films of 2013",1383782400,3,197,5.827586206896552
8614007,3,B00FBE6810,"The screenplay is above average, for the most part.  The two older sisters have a very credible codependent relationship -- one older, tougher sister who is uncompromising and unforgiving.  The younger a passive-aggressive polyanna who copes by trying to make everything OK and struggling not to piss off the older.  I've had people like this in my family, and believe that the writer knows them too.  Their relationship seemed very authentic.

The acting is also above average.  What starts off looking like a boobs 'n guns sexploitation crime caper delivered more than most of the middle-of-the-road films of this type.

The plot was effective, and well-paced, and kept me interested.  A lot of times, I'll put on a movie like this and sort-of half watch it while working at my desk.  I was hooked in enough that I didn't get much work done.

It has some genre-crossing horror elements in it, but they're mostly there to reveal the backstory behind the two sisters' toxic relationship.  The special effects were simple, but enough to get the job done without looking over-the-top or cheesy.

This isn't shakespeare, as another reviewer commented.  It has plot holes and some awkward staging.  The acting, while competent, isn't going to win any awards, but Id be happy to see any of the three sisters in other films.  Though the youngest sister is mostly just a foil for the other two, it was delivered pretty well.

If this had been a VHS rental back in the day, I would have felt like I got my money's worth.  I expected camp, bad valley-girl acting and fake blood.  What I got was a solid and mature effort to tell an interesting story.",1529625600,,1641,4.738515901060071
8614008,4,B00FBE6810,"Hot girls, guns, and ghosts. It's a win-win. Is it Shakespeare? No. But with solid production value, decent performances, and a few unexpected elements, it kept me entertained throughout and is FAR better than half the streaming stuff I've seen.",1497398400,,245,5.15

8614015,4,B00FBE6810,"This is an excellent film, and definitely worth watching.  All three actresses were outstanding as sisters with troubled pasts.  Actually, I thought this movie might have been even better simply as a family drama, minus the supernatural ghost scenes, although they certainly added an effectively creepy touch.  The only unrealistic aspect of the story line was the youngest sister's heroin withdrawal, which had to be the gentlest and mildest ever!  Withdrawal from opiates is no joke; it's notorious for being excruciatingly painful, with severe, flu-like symptoms.  But don't let that get in the way of this finely-made film that has a lot going for it.  Highly recommended.",1404950400,5,676,5.271028037383178

It was so boring , I made it almost to the end while I did some paper work , ate lunch and stared out the window . Don't do it ...",1403222400,5,250,3.4035087719298245
