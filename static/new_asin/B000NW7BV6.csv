I'm surprised Amazon is even dealing with dodgy stuff like this.",1197417600,7,121,4.5
8182177,2,B000NW7BV6,"basically this was a bad VHS recording copied directly to DVD. The picture quality is very poor, with lots of grain and dust. The sound is also very muted.

I only gave this 2 stars because I really love this show and would like to see it on DVD in high quality.

The writing on this show is 5 star (Levinson and Link of COLUMBO fame)

And the show is produced by Bruce Geller (Mission Impossible)
