8137947,1,B000HAVU16,"Woody Allen may call this the best ""Vanya."" I guess he speaks Russian. It should be noted that the producer's description of the product reveals the disc does not have subtitles. As I haven't seen it, my Star rating should be ignored. My warning about the subtitles should not.",1391644800,2,277,4.673469387755102
8137948,4,B000HAVU16,"Accomplished Russian film adaptation of Chekov's Uncle Vanya. Woody Allen calls this ""the best Vanya"" and it may be. Well performed, well filmed, funny. Of course it's Chekov so it sometimes move at a ... stately ... pace. I wouldn't consider it especially slow, though, unless you're conditioned to American action movies and romantic comedies.",1322092800,3,345,5.290909090909091
