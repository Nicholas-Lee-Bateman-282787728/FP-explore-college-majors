2408169,5,B000B8384Q,"Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) is a cop whose intense hatred of crooks and hoods continuously gets him into trouble with his boss, Inspector Foley (Robert F. Simon). Dixon's violent temper explodes one night when he tracks down a cheap hoodlum suspected of stabbing a guy to death. Not knowing that the hoodlum, Kenneth Paine (Craig Stevens), is a decorated WWII veteran with a silver plate in his head, Dixon punches his too hard, and Kenneth dies. Dixon then comes up with a plan to frame Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the murder. Scalise is the gangster that Dixon has been obsessed with putting behind bars for years, and this presents him with a golden opportunity to nail him, while clearing himself at the same time.

But as usual, the plan falls apart when Dixon gets involved with a beautiful woman, Morgan Taylor (Gene Tierney), who was romantically involved with Kenneth Paine before meeting Dixon. Morgan knows nothing about Kenneth's death until the police arrest her father, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), for the murder. Dixon does his best to clear Jiggs, while falling in love with Morgan at the same time. Dixon finally comes up with a last-ditch plan that will clear Jiggs as well as redeem himself for his past crimes. However, when Scalise figures out just how determined Dixon is to trap him, he realizes that Dixon is a cop worth avoiding. It's up to Dixon to try to trap Scalise and his gang before they can flee the country.

""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is one of the great ""bad cop"" noirs, and is one of Dana Andrews best roles. Gene Tierney's amazing beauty is the main attraction, though. I love those close-ups of her face! Add to these two great stars a wonderful supporting cast: Gary Merrill, Tom Tully, Karl Malden, Ruth Donnelly, Craig Stevens, and, one of the great ""heavies"" of film noir, Neville Brand, in one of his earliest roles. The DVD transfer is superb, plus the audio commentary by film noir author/historian Eddie Muller is very humorous, informative, and entertaining (he avoids the b.s. analyzing and just tells it like it is!). There's also a photo gallery and theatrical trailers for this movie and others in the Fox Film Noir series. This movie is another gem from director Otto Preminger, a great director of film noir (""Laura"", ""Fallen Angel"", ""Angel Face"", etc.). If you love classic film noir, you'll definitely want to add this awesome DVD to your collection.",1135900800,9,2400,4.808716707021792
2408170,5,B000B8384Q,"This review is for the 2005 Twentieth Century Fox DVD.

The story involves a tough and notoriously abusive police detective named Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) who gets called in on a murder investigation of a man who has stabbed in a hotel room after winning a huge pot in a crap game, which was run by a well-known mobster, Tommy Scalise (Gary Merrill).  Scalise and his low life pals put the finger on Ken Paine (Craig Stevens), so Dixon shows up at Paine's seedy apartment and interrogates him.  After some heated discussion Paine punches Dixon and Dixon hits him back and Paine dies as a result.  Dixon decides to cover-up his involvement in his death, while staying involved in the investigation. This sets up the rest of the film where Dixon is morally conflicted about his role in the accidental death of a suspect, yet has to deal with the reality that someone else may be arrested and convicted for the murder of Ken Paine.

Of the twelve movies released so far in the Fox Film Noir series, this one is easily the best.  The noir artistry is magnificant - especially Dana Andrews, who with his fadora hat and overcoat, plays the quintessential disturbed cop.  But in addition to the leading role, it seems like the entire film was shot at night with the New York skyline as a common background with plenty of directional lighting and harsh shadows.  But even beyond the look of the film, the story is tension-filled and has a lot of raw energy as a tough cop has to deal with the anguish and guilt of what he perceives others think he has done, even though that isn't really how it happened. But even worse, he has to deal with the reality that a woman he loves will suffer for numerous reasons because of his actions.

The DVD transfer is the best work that Fox has done yet in this classic series.  The full screen black & white presentation is flawless from beginning to end with no noticable graininess or lack of sharpness.  The sound is also exceptionally good for a film this old.  Beside a trailer and some stills, the only notable feature is commentary by noir enthusist Eddie Mueller.

2408171,5,B000B8384Q,"The set up and the dark photography in Otto Preminger's film noir from 1950 provide all the necessities to create a dark and morally corrupt environment.  Even the title Where the Sidewalk Ends alludes to an ominous atmosphere of a looming end in a mundane environment.  The opening reveals that Detective Sergeant Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) who has a record of beating up suspects, and it costs him his rank within the police force.  On top of this, a peer, Thomas (Karl Malden), from his police school days is taking over as Police Chief for the 16th Precinct in which he works.  It is a hard blow to his ego, as there is nothing more important to Dixon than to putting criminals behind bars.

It is within the imperfect persona performed by Dana Andrews that the story gets its captivating quality.  Dixon lives a lonely life while his workaholic attitude finds nourishment in his deep fiery hatred towards criminals, which is also the reason why he finds himself in trouble with his superiors.  The solitude of Dixon overshadows the whole story and it accentuates the tough elements of film noir within the film.  Little by little, the story reveals why Dixon has such a strong hatred for delinquent characters, as it also provides additional support of the elements of film noir within the film.

Dixon's job brings him on long and tough shifts amidst the murky nights of New York City where he comes across a murder in a small and ritzy underground gambling club.  The club happens to belong to a shady character named Tom Scalise (Gary Merrill) with whom Dixon has crossed paths with in the past.  They are in good terms with one another, on the contrary Dixon treats him like the lowest scum in the world, which is an indicator that he thinks Scalise is a crook.  The whole situation seems fishy to Dixon, but evidence and witnesses' point out a specific wife-abusing Kenneth Paine (Craig Stevens) as the perpetrator.

Despite Dixon's personal objections to the suspect's identity, he must investigate the lead. When Dixon knocks on Paine's door he finds him drunk talking on the phone while also unaware of why the police would like to see him.  In the drunken stupor, Paine tries to strike him with a bottle, but Dixon reacts quickly in his usual manner by striking back.  However, it is the last time for Dixon to strike a suspect, as Paine ceases to breathe after a fall.  The fear crawling over his face after becoming aware of Paine's death is very noticeable, but subtle expressions suggest that he is considering his options.  Dixon is aware of people's knowledge of his aggressive nature towards criminals while the warning from his supervisor echoes in his head.

Cornered without witnesses observing the act of self-defense Dixon begin to choose the path he so much despises.  The audience is aware of the events taking place, but the audience is also aware of how the situation will be interpreted, a cop going overboard and killed a suspect in the process.  It is within this moral predicament of justice where the cinematic value emerges, as Dixon also begins to develop strong feelings for Paine's wife Morgan Taylor (Gene Tierney).  The film becomes increasingly more complex, as with it its complexity a fascinating film noir emerges that struggles with right and wrong while scrutinize a man's conscious and moral fabric.",1135209600,90,3346,4.814685314685315
2408172,4,B000B8384Q,"Engrossing account of tough detective(Dana Andrews) who accidently kills a murder suspect and is simultaneously trying to pin the rap on a mob boss(Gary Merrill) while trying to extricate a cabbie(Tom Tully) of guilt.  The cabbie also happens to be the father of the dead man's wife(Gene Tierney) who Andrews takes a shine to.  The film is a hybrid of noir and pulp fiction but entertains nonetheless.  I found it a little too slick to qualify as classic noir.  The film benefits by a solid lead performance by Andrews whom you find yourself rooting for despite the character's obvious flaws.  Andrews and Tierney maintain the chemistry that they established in ""Laura"". I didn't buy entirely Tierney as a working class model.  Through no fault of her own she's just so damn beautiful to be considered a classic noir babe.",1134777600,4,822,4.877697841726619

I was thrilled to see it released in the UK by the British Film Institute last year along with 'Whirlpool' and 'Thje Fallen Angel'. This is one of the best film noir. Dana Andrews and Gene have incredible on-screen chemistry and Dana Andrew's performance is simply phenomenal. Cannot go wrong with this one.

2408174,5,B000B8384Q,"WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS (1950) is wonderful Noir, perhaps second only to LAURA in the Fox canon.  Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney, drawing slightly on their iconography from that earlier movie, play the hard-bitten cop and the stylish ad woman, respectively.  But this time Andrews' character kills a bit hood (a pre-PETER GUNN Craig Stevens) while trying to get to the big hood (Gary Merrill).  The reluctant murderer pretends to go on the lam but really hangs around, and his unwitting colleagues, with every ironic good intention, draw the bead on every suspected murderer but Andrews himself -- at first.  Otto Preminger's telling direction and luminous performances from all actors (including Karl Malden) make this film a standout.  The Commentary by Noir specialist Eddie Muller is excellent.  All in all this is a film not to be missed, even if you aren't a particular Film Noir enthusiast.  The current price makes this DVD a bargain.",1483747200,2,941,5.032258064516129

2408182,3,B000B8384Q,"This movie is billed as a film noir. Although it has much of the atmosphere of film noir, it really isn't one, but is interesting in a way I doubt that those involved in its making intended.
 Otto Preminger directed it and Ben Hecht wrote the screenplay.
 Dana Andrews plays good/ bad cop Detective Mark Dixon. We learn early in the film that Dixon has too many complaints against him from citizens he has roughed up. (A dozen  in one month!) Dixon is unrepentant and says they all had it coming. To Dixon the world is sharply divided between good people (who are pretty much invisible) and hoods, who deserve to be beaten on a frequent basis. He, of course, knows the difference effortlessly. This philosophy is not strictly speaking wrong, it is just inadequate for a policeman not operating in a Third World country. The audience can see trouble ahead.
 At the beginning of the movie, Dixon has a new lieutenant placed over him  played by Karl Malden  who has an unusual idea that policemen should obey the law. (Of course, this will not catch on, and before the movie is over Maldens character flushes his ideals down the crapper and beats a confession out of a guy. Which, we are led to believe, is okay because the guy was a hood.)
 A short time later, Dixon beats a suspect to death in the mans apartment. Dixon is alone with the suspect when this happens and arrived at the apartment building in a taxi cab  which makes no sense and is never explained.
 Dixon actually has not committed any crime, as the suspect attacked him with a bottle and Dixon defended himself with his hands. He had no way of knowing that the suspect (named Payne) has a metal plate in his skull; when he pushed Payne away, the guy fell on the metal plate and goodbye Mr. Payne. A good argument could be made that Dixon then feels uncomfortable about the whole thing because he didn't break the law.
 It is interesting to see all this in light of contemporary events with a cop nearly every week accused of killing an unarmed African American. Everybody in this movie is white. Now if Payne had been black, Dixon could have hit him with a lead pipe and been home free. It was a more innocent time. (But for an alternate take on race relations, see the 1940 film His Girl Friday, where a man is sentenced to hang for killing a colored policeman. When the guy escapes, the mayor issues a shoot to kill order  because he needs the colored vote to get re-elected. That film is also based on a script by Ben Hecht  and don't miss the pickanniny jokes.)
 Dixon then does a very stupid thing, even for a cop. The phone rings and he answers it. No particular reason for that, as he is alone in an apartment with a corpse. His partner is on the other end of the line asking if he has found Payne. Common sense would be to say that he has found Payne and the guy was dead when he got there. But you see, Dixon is a real cop. So he just has to do something both dishonest and dumb. He says that he is at Paynes apartment (which the cop on the other end of the line might eventually have figured out  as that is where he is calling) but Paynes not there. Well, in a sense he is telling the truth. Payne isn't there but the late Mr. Payne definitely is. We now enter the fascinating inner workings of a cops mind  which makes Alices world beyond the rabbit hole seem sensible and down to earth in comparison.
 Dixon is about the same size and build as Payne. He gets the bright idea of pretending to be the dead man, calls a cab (not the same one which brought him there), quickly packs a suitcase with the dead mans clothes, then puts on Paynes trench coat and hat and even puts a piece of tape on his face where Payne had one. When the cab arrives, Dixon takes it to a train station and buys a ticket to Pittsburgh. Then he goes back to the dead mans apartment as himself. His partner has just arrived there but has not yet looked in the closet where Dixon hid the corpse. Then we get a gosh, where could the guy be? routine, followed by a very nice touch when Dixon opens the closet door so that we can see the corpse but the partner cant, and says, nothing here. Later Dixon takes the body to the river and throws it in. We don't see that part but learn of it through dialogue; we also learn that Dixon had to slug a night watchman who happened inconveniently upon the scene. All of this is so nutty that it probably is something a cop would do in real life.
 Here we must freeze frame and consider what this movie is really about. If it is teach us that cops are dishonest idiots  well you have to be something of an idiot not to know that one already. The movie is really about an alternate universe in which moral laws stand in place of physical laws. Dixon has it in for a hood named Scalesi (played by Gary Merrill). This shows anti-Italian bias by Zionist Ben Hecht, abetted by Preminger (a Galician Jew and the son of a state prosecutor in the Austro-Hungarian Empire), also bias against the physically disabled. (Scalesi is asthmatic and almost constantly spraying decongestant up his nose. But equating a physical disability with moral disability goes back to Shakespeares Richard III.) We learn that Dixon is the son of a cop who was on Scalesis payroll. Dixon hates his own father (no details given here) and hates Scalesi by extension. Another director might have gone to town with Dixon as an Oedipal delight, but Preminger doesnt take this theme any further.
 Scalesi was running a rigged crap game in which the mark was a rich Texan. Payne is working with Scalesi and used his semi-estranged wife (played by Gene Tierney) to entice the Texan into the game. Tierneys character, we are asked to believe, has no idea what is really going on. This is a major flaw in the plot. Because her character is a model we are expected to see her as pretty much brainless. (When we later see her modeling, Tierneys real life husband, Oleg Cassini, appears briefly.) The way Tierney character is written is a terrible waste of a good actress, but to move on.
 The Texan wins a considerable amount of money shooting craps. Looking at how he does this it is obvious to me that he was pad rolling  although less than one percent of the audience would have any idea what that is. The Texan was cheating (although he does it inartfully  if you really know how to pad roll you rattle the dice. Apparently the guy was only accustomed to fleecing other Texans  in other words, morons.) Under the circumstances, for the Texan to later be cheated would scarcely be a moral outrage. But before this can happen, Tierneys character queers the deal by saying she has to go home and go to bed. The Texan would like to tag along, and asks for his winnings. Cant have that, can we? Scalesi makes it clear that Payne has to discipline his wife which he does by slapping her. Of course, both legally and morally at that time he had every right to do so as a husband. But the Texan sees this and he doesnt know that Payne is married to the girl. The Texan then tries to beat up Payne who, with that metal plate in his head, knows that one blow can kill him and therefore carries a knife in self-defense. He now uses it and thats the end of the Texan.
 The curious thing here is that from a legal viewpoint no one has committed a crime  except for illegal gambling. Payne had every right to slap his own wife for being a total idiot. The Texan had every right to defend a womans honor. And Payne with the metal plate in his skull had every right to use a knife to prevent himself from being killed. Bearing in mind that when Payne later gets into a fight he gets killed by Dixon, who is also justified in what he did, this is a crime movie with an amazing paucity of crime!
 The audience is supposed to identify with Dixon, while at the same time feeling that he should not get away with concealing a homicide. Melodrama is laid on with a trowel when Paynes body is discovered and Maldens character becomes convinced he was murdered by a cabdriver who is the father of Tierneys character and wanted revenge for his daughter being brutalized. Meanwhile, Dixon has the hots for Tierneys character  which raises a whole new range of moral issues for the audience to chew on. Even before Payne is officially declared dead, Dixon is making a play for his wife. Because she is already a widow she is fair game, and being a model, even though she thinks her husband is alive, she is too dumb to think she isn't fair game  so everything is fine on the romance front.
 There is a certain charm in a movie which pushes silliness to this extreme. Also, Tierney is so nice looking that no man can blame Dixon if he wants to get her into a film that could be called Where My Panties End. However, after being beaten up by Scalesis men, Dixon goes to Tierneys apartment and she invites him in. She is alone and in her bathrobe. Dixons reaction is to say, I don't know why I came here. Apparently if you're all cop, thats a mystery you could never solve in a million years.
 I won't give away how the movie manages to wrap everything up  except to note it is by something which would never occur in the space-time continuum as we know it.
 This is not film noir because there are no moral dilemmas in film noir, only practical ones  although they tend to be doozies. In a practical sense Dixon has it made. He killed a man, tried unsuccessfully to hide the body, but gets away with it when another man is arrested and charged with his crime. So what if its the father of the girl he loves? Hes not in love with the father. He has already killed the girls husband and somebody must take the wrap, so why not the father? In the world of film noir, Dixon would be brought down but he could never deliberately bring himself down. A protagonist in a film noir soon realizes that the whole universe is out to get him. He doesnt need to go out of his way to hurt himself; it is going to happen no matter what he does. If he does the wrong things he will be annihilated for it; but if he does the right things he will be annihilated also, just in a different way. Thats because in the film noir universe there is no right, there are only infinite shades of wrong. Its a world designed by the devil, and the one lesson is: have all the fun you can while you can because you're going to die in the end. Pretty much like the world we live in.",1460505600,6,10368,4.316872427983539

2408194,5,B000B8384Q,"Now this is how film noir should look. Six years after Otto Preminger made the classic ""Laura""(1944), he reunited the two stars(Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney), cinematographer Joseph LaShelle and his production crew for another film noir go around with ""Where the Sidewalk Ends""(1950), a film that has ""noir"" written all over it. Although not quite the murder mystery like ""Laura"" which kept audiences guessing until the end, ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" instead focuses on the accidental death by an over zealous and brutal cop(played by Dana Andrews) and his misguided attempts to cover up the crime as his world spins out of control. It's film noir at it's best and this underrated film is given new life now that it has finally been released on Blu-ray. This is one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year and Twilight Time has outdone themselves with an absolutely breathtaking and eye popping picture that will dazzle viewers from start to finish(Bitrate: 29.99). From the moment the 20th-Century Fox logo appears, fans and viewers are in for an razor sharp picture that is pristine in every way. There are no vertical lines, white specks, torn or damaged frames and this new Blu-ray puts the standard DVD to shame. Cinematographer Joseph LaShelle's B & W images are a marvel with close-ups being especially vivid. Blacks, whites and grays just pop off the screen with both interiors and exteriors being razor sharp. This is how all film noir films should look. The acting is top notch with Dana Andrews giving one of his greatest performances as the conflicted police detective, Mark Dixon. Preminger's use of close-ups shows viewers every ounce of conflict in Andrews facial expressions. Although she doesn't have much to do in the story(by Ben Hecht), Gene Tierney is equally effective in her supporting role as Andrews' love interest. Gary Merrill, Karl Malden and Tom Tully round out the supporting cast. The Audio(English 1.0 DTS-HD MA) is equally impressive and free of any noise artifacts(hiss, pops, crackle, etc.). ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is 95 minutes(Aspect ratio: 1.33:1) and only contains the following subtitle: English SDH. Special features include an isolated music score, Audio Commentary with film historian and noir expert Eddie Muller and the Original Theatrical Trailer. There is an informative four page booklet about the making of the film by historian Julie Kirgo. The Blu-ray disc itself is housed in a clear and solid Blu-ray case(like Criterion). ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" might not be as classic as ""Laura"" but Twilight's new Blu-ray certainly raises it to a new level. With an absolutely breathtaking and pristine  picture that will leave viewers dazzled, it's one of the best Blu-ray releases of the year and  comes very highly recommended.",1458691200,4,2777,5.101098901098901

When i started watching this Fox Film Noir release of ""Where The Sidewalk Ends"" my jaw dropped...i was speechless.
The transfer is as pristine as any i've ever seen anywhere from any studio. Very high quality.
The PQ is good enough to satisfy almost any videophile...this side of Blu-ray. I can hardly imagine a BD release of this movie being that much better than this DVD is. A BD release would be a bit better,but not a whole lot better,not enough to justify the extra cost of buying BD IMO.
Heck,i've seen plenty of Blu-ray releases that didn't have as good PQ this DVD release has.
If you appreciate film noir and noir-ish movies like i do,and you demand good PQ,then the release of this Fox film is for you.
There aren't many special features on this disc,just some commentary,still photo gallery,and theatrical trailer.
The DVD comes in the usual case type.
The audio is excellent too,just as pristine as the video. No pops,hissing,or anything else to detract from your viewing/listening pleasure.

2408266,4,B000B8384Q,"Teamed in Laura, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney have another go round together in this Otto Preminger film, and once more the focus is the emotional state of Andrews' character. Once again he's a cop, but this time a cop who  bears a family stain and is inclined to be violent toward the low-lifes he encounters in the course of his job. Having been warned not to cross that line again, he accidentally kills a murderer and covers up the deed, only to have suspicion fall on the father of the woman he is falling in love with -- a woman who also happens to be the estranged wife of the killer he has slain. Excellent dialogue by screenwriter Ben Hecht, excellent night-time photography and a magnificent supporting cast that includes Karl Malden, Bert Freed, Tom Tully and Gary Merrill all more than make up for the film's shortcomings. Those imperfections include some unlikely scenarios, such as Andrews managing to lug the body from an apartment building and dispose of it off camera, as well as the saccharine blandness of Gene Tierey's acting. One might also consider faulting Andrews' performance as well: Though he has a memorable voice, his face remains largely impassive. In my view, however, that even exterior is just right for the character, who I think would try to hide his inner turmoil behind such a calm mask. Though it lacks one or two classic noir elements, such as a femme fatale, there's no rule that all such aspects must always be present. Where the Sidewalk Ends portrays a man with dark origins trying to find redemption on his own but finding himself trapped in a destructive web created by his own misguided choices. One winds up not knowing whether to root for him or not, and in the end he breaks the tie for us by making an irrevocable final choice. And all that is good enough for me.

Dana Andrews plays a street wise, but overly aggressive tough cop Dixon, who investigates a murder at a gaming table. He accidentally kills a man who is going to be pinned for the murder. He scrambles to try to cover this up, but in doing so gets another man framed for the murder, cabbie Jiggs Taylor. It seems the more he tries to distance himself from this incident, the more complicated it becomes, especially when he tries to implicate a member of the mob. And, it seems that Dixon has fallen for Jiggs' beautiful daughter, Morgan (Gene Tierney).  Dixon tries to get out of the jam he's created for himself.

Andrews gives a fine performance and gives depth to his character Dixon, and strays away from any stereotypes. Tierney is beautiful as always, although her role could have been a little more prominent in the story. Karl Malden plays the head lieutenant at the precinct who has suspicions about Dixon.

2408270,3,B000B8384Q,"I guess if you get into a crime noir crazed mode as I have been over the past several months then nothing should surprise you as far as plot line, photography (black and white of course), or actors are concerned. No way, no way in hell, would when I started out this jail break-out reviewing process of the old time films from the mid-1940s to the mid-1950s mostly would I have believed that I would be reviewing a film like the one under review, good, bad, or indifferent, with the title Where The Sidewalk Ends. And no way, no way in hell, would I have believed that I would be, seemingly endlessly now, on a Dana Andrews run. Bogie, no question, Robert Mitchum sure, even Dick Powell in a pinch but Dana Andrews? Oh well, at least he has classic good girl (no femme fatale here even though she is a model) Gene Tierney to keep his eyes on once he gets control of his anger.

With all that build-up you may thing that this one is one for the ages like The Big Sleep or Out Of The Past. No way. First of all it is just a police procedural with a little twist, a bad copper/good copper little twist. See ""real"" crime noir gumshoes are strictly private, not messing up on the public payroll. And certainly not messing up like Detective Mark Dixon, the role played by Brother Andrews. See he is a cop, a big city cop naturally, whose father was a big-time city crook and he is trying to live that idea down. Live it down by busting up the bad guys, literally and physically, in some cases. And most definitely with no concern, no pre-Miranda concern at least, for the niceties of constitutional law.

One thing will lead to another when you try to cut the corners on edge city and so our boy takes a tumble. Seems a ""mark"" in a big city gambling operation won too much dough and wanted to go home with it. Well the hard boys, or what passes for hard boys in this one, said no go, no go way. And so the mark is taken care of in the way the hard boys do, although they need a fall guy and he just happens to be the ""roper."" Needless to say when Brother Andrews come to investigate the roper's role in the killing his way-his two-fisted, no knock, no guff from hard boys way, he just happened to get a little carried away. And so mark and roper are joined together, R.I.P.

But wait a minute what about Brother Andrews' pension and his delight with his job. Here is where the tale gets just a little too weird. He decides to use his little problem as a way to get the hard boys, especially their leader played by Gary Merrill, to take a tumble. The problem is when you start down that road, that cover-up the fix is in road, though you don't know where things are going to fall. And who is going to take the fall. And who takes the fall, or at least the prime candidate, is none other than the taxi-driving father-in-law of that very dead roper. Now I don't, personally, care if this or that average cab driver takes a fall for some off-hand murder, those guys charge too much anyway and they always want a tip, even the quiet ones. But this particular cab-driver has a, well, fetching model daughter played by Gene Tierney, who would be very upset, very upset indeed, if papa wound up in stir for a long time.

Also needless to say Brother Andrews is starting to go for said daughter in a big way. So he has to clean up the mess with the father, the mess with the mob, and his own misbegotten mess before the film ends. Tough work, very tough work indeed. But here is where it gets really weird, especially if you have read any newspaper from 1940 to this very day, this cop who gets the bad guys, straight up no questions asks, gets dear cabby papa off from the caboose, and throws an off-hand wink toward darling daughter, decides that he has to take the fall for his improper police procedure. Gone is that pretty little pension, and gone, long gone is the suspicion of disbelief on this one. Where are Sam Spade and Phillip Marlowe when you need them.",1329004800,,3951,4.271028037383178

2408273,4,B000B8384Q,"***SPOILERS***

Produced and directed by Otto Preminger, WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a solid noir film.  Perhaps on few Top 10 lists, but still a great example of the noir style; well shot by Joseph LaShelle and well written by Ben Hecht.

It involves Det. Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews).  Dixon is a violent, aggressive cop ... the son of a violent, aggressive gangster; and he has difficulty shaking his father's legacy of violence.  Ironically, it is this legacy that haunts Dixon, and makes him behave aggressively.

So he is a ripe candidate for noir.  Dixon's character isn't particularly psychotic, but he is unbalanced enough to fit into this typical 1950s noir category.  And Fate intends for Dixon to have the misfortune of killing a war vet (though the vet is definitely, by this time, a criminal), because the vet has a metal plate in his head, and a punch is enough to do him in.  [Mental note to self:  if I ever get a metal plate in my head, do not take up a life of crime.]

Dixon is able to dispose of the body easily enough, but things begin to fall apart when the father of the deceased's wife is arrested for the murder.  Problem is, Dixon has fallen in love with the widow (Gene Tierney)....

The film is compared with LAURA (1944), because of the reunion of Preminger, Andrews and Tierney.  But this one is much grittier (it even has Karl Malden! lol.).  Whereas LAURA is propelled by a mystery, we are ""let in"" on all the facets of SIDEWALK as it goes along.  And we realize that, for Mark Dixon, the sidewalk doesn't end in Disneyworld.",1281830400,2,1554,4.516129032258065
2408274,4,B000B8384Q,"This is a well done Noir.  There's a good script by Ben Hecht and a group of solid 50's stars.  Dana Andrews is good, but not brilliant, as the hero, Mark Dixon, a cop who is trying desperately to be different than his mobster father.  This issue is well explained and gives credibility to his actions.  Andrews is every inch the romantic lead, with his chiselled good looks, impassive expression and deadpan voice.  For my money I'd have liked an actor who could have registered more of the agony that the character was going through.  One expression for all purposes doesn't do the character justice.

Gene Tierney is radiantly beautiful and seems credible as a woman who falls in love too easily with troubled men.  It's fun to see Karl Malden and Gary Merrill in smaller roles.

This isn't the most exciting noir film I've seen but it is well done and holds together well.  Fans of the genre will love it.  Others might be warned that it's not going to keep you thinking about it for very long afterward.",1272412800,,1008,4.544444444444444
2408275,5,B000B8384Q,"Dana Andrews is one of those actors that I've probably seen in a dozen films, but who took a long time to register for me. Often stolid, taciturn, playing the same kinds of roles and looking somewhat like the similarly underrated Glenn Ford, he's an actor that takes some effort to really appreciate; but once you hit the right film....

And this was it. Preminger's moody look at New York's underbelly is as dirty and seedy as just about any 50s noir, and Andrews is in his element as too-tough cop Mark Dixon who just doesn't know how to play the game to get ahead: he hates criminals too much to always play by the rules. Early on in the film, he accidentally kills the witness to a murder involving an illegal crap game set up by a mobster who Dixon hates for personal reasons, and he spends the rest of the film trying to cover up his involvement and bring the mobster to his kind of ""justice"". Along the way he gets involved with the estranged wife of the man he killed (Gene Tierney) and also has to try to get her father off the hook for the murder.

Stunningly photographed by Joseph LaShelle - the parking garage scenes in particular have both an alluring beauty and a realism that was rare at the time -  with hard and sparkling dialogue by Ben Hecht and a truly powerful ending with elements of tragedy and found grace in just a minute or two of time, this is another noir for the ages and is probably my favorite Preminger film next to DAISY KENYON -- it's every bit as good and certainly less predictable than the more-heralded LAURA.",1254355200,2,1548,4.386759581881533
2408276,4,B000B8384Q,"Really enjoyed this wonderfully atmospheric noir. Great New York black & white shots, a sharp, smart even sensitive script, great characters and, best of all, everybody getting slapped around mercilessly including diva Tierney. Dana Andrews, who at first appeared miscast, was outstanding as the grizzled no-nonsense veteran cop who accidentally kills while trying to find a killer. Everybody in this was simply at the top of their game---probably a result of Otto Preminger's direction. Bert Freed, one of those ""I've seen him before"" character actors, was excellent as Andrews' cop partner. Gary Merrill, another familiar face, gave the performance of his career as the prime suspect. Karl Malden, in an early career role, was in his usual fine form as Andrews' annoyingly 'know-it-all' new boss. And ANY movie with Neville Brand has gotta be good! 'The old lady in the cafe' & 'the old lady at the window' were two fine characterizations. And how about the 'nasal-spray' pumping ringleader Merrill getting a rubdown in the Turkish baths around his ""young"" thugs. Preminger, never averse to tackling controversial issues [remember THE MAN WITH THE GOLDEN ARM, 1955], gave us quite a singular, androgynous and perverse bunch of mobsters, possibly serving as the impetus for the wierdo atypical  mobsters we saw at the end of David Cronenberg's A HISTORY OF VIOLENCE [2005].  What fun this was! This is definitely a genre classic BUT what kept this from being an all-around classic? Not my two minor beefs: 1- Tierney being miscast & 2- the way Andrews got rid of the body: through the front door! [geez!]; but, the way the movie ended. Many great movies often have a great [and hopefully happy] ending. However, here we have the movie end with Andrews surviving a gunshot, the mob, apparently vindicated and ready to walk off into the sunset with Tierney, only to see him admit his accidental killing and basically losing it all at the end. After watching the lonely cop [Andrews] and battered-wife [Tierney] find each other in this rough-and-tumble movie a happy ending was what we were primed to expect. It would have sewn this up perfectly. Major gaffe, Otto!",1236384000,2,2163,5.039106145251397

It had a great plot, was suspenseful, had compelling characters, and a satisfying ending.  Tierney's performance added to her range of acting capabilities; she is sweet and demure in this film, deceptive and unbalanced in Leave Her to Heaven, stoic and a bit cold in Laura.

In this unusually well written film noir from Fox, Andrews accidentally kills a murderer he was sent to question and must cover up his crime; he falls in love with the murderer's widow (Gene Tierney), and then must scramble when her adoring father is blamed for the murder. The sense of atmosphere here is very fine, and the direction is stunning: there are some great shots in a car elevator, for example, and also in a steam room. Preminger de-emphasizes Andrews's handsomeness and brings out his more weary tough qualities; unfortunately, he can't seem to do much with poor Gene Tierney, who as always seems far too beautiful for the part she's playing. (Things are not helped by the stunning outfits designed for her by her husband Oleg Cassini, who has a small role in the film. Her fabulous plaid coat, for example, has a scarf made exactly to match it, which are both so eye-catching you are distracted by them in every scene they're in.)

Dana Andrews is the honest, tough New York policeman, always in trouble with his superiors because he likes his own strong-arm methods as much as he detests crooks... When he hit someone, his knuckles hurt... And the man he wants to hit is a smooth villain (Gary Merrill) who points up the title. 'Why are you always trying to push me in the gutter?' he asks Andrews. 'I have as much right on the sidewalk as you.'

Dana Andrew's obsession and neurosis are implanted in his hidden, painful discovery that he is the son of a thief... His deep hatred of criminals led him to use their own illegal methods to destroy them, and the pursuit of justice became spoiled in private vendetta...

By a twist of irony unique to the film itself, Dana Andrews and Gene Tierney of 'Laura' are united once more, and Andrews now seems to be playing the same detective a few years later, but no longer the romantic, beaten down by his job, by the cheap crooks... This time, he goes too far, and accidentally kills a suspect... The killing is accidental, the victim worthless, yet it is a crime that he knows can break him or send him to jail...

Using his knowledge of police procedure, he covers up his part in the crime, plants false clues, and tries to implicate a gang leader, but cannot avoid investigating the case himself... The double tension of following the larger case through to its conclusion without implicating himself in the murder, is beautifully maintained and the final solution is both logical, satisfying, and in no way a compromise...

The film is one of the best detective films of the 50's, with curious moral values, also one of Preminger's best...

Preminger uses a powerful storytelling technique, projecting pretentious camera angles and peculiar touches of the bizarre in order to externalize his suspense in realism...",1168905600,29,2040,4.797720797720798

WSE quickly is in high gear.  DA attempts a clumsy cover up.  His new boss, Karl Malden, quickly fingers rough and tough Tom Tully as the murderer.  He is the perfect fall guy, but the audience, not to mention DA, knows he is innocent.  The plot boils when DA gets involved with Tully's daughter, Gene Tierney.  Here is the perfect uptown girl in a decidedly downtown location.  This plot contrivance is actually believable.  Will DA let his girlfriend's Dad go to Sing Sing for a death he caused?  The resolution is unmentioned here.  Viewers will have to watch WSE for themselves but those who do will not be disappointed.  WSE is fast moving and highly credible. There are the required nighttime shots of sleazy night spots, dingy tenements, dark alleys and dank garages.  If there was a daytime scene, this viewer missed it.  The suspense is maintained throughout, even though the audience has all the ""evidence"". The reuniting of Andrews/Tierney (after ""Laura"") by Director Preminger is a complete success.  This reviewer made a mistake! He was reading Silver and Ward's ""Film Noir"" and peeked at the ending! Even so, the resolution to WSE was still a great one, almost shocking!  Viewers are urged to savor the atmosphere in this film/noir detective classic and take that fadeout as it comes.",1154995200,4,1612,4.803636363636364
2408296,4,B000B8384Q,"""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" reunites much of the creative team from 1944's ""Laura"" -director Otto Preminger, cinematographer Joseph LaShelle, and stars Gene Tierney and Dana Andrews- in an archetypal film noir based on the novel ""Night Cry"" by William L. Stuart. New York police detective Mark Dixon (Dana Andrews) inspires scorn and admiration for being tough on criminals. Too tough. Constantly reprimanded for police brutality, one more incident of excessive violence may cost Dixon his career. Called upon to track down a suspect in a murder that occurred at a floating craps game run by a mobster named Scalise (Gary Merrill), Mark finds the man, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens), drunk and reluctant to cooperate. A struggle ensues. Paine falls to the floor, hits his head, and dies. Dixon decides to cover up his role in Paine's death and try to pin it on Scalise. But he didn't count on the chief suspect in Paine's death being the totally innocent father of Paine's estranged wife Morgan Taylor (Gene Tierney), with whom Dixon is smitten.

Mark Dixon is a man torn between doing the right and lawful thing or following the criminal impulse at the core of his nature, inherited from his father. A self-destructive personality and cruel twists of fate combine to put Dixon and everyone he touches in a real predicament. Not surprisingly, it is the criminal who understands him best: Scalise is a sleaze ball, but he doesn't lack perspicacity. He knows what he sees. He calls Dixon ""half cop and half killer"". Dana Andrews conveys Dixon's duality admirably. Dixon is a laconic man. His words don't often betray his feelings. But we can read the violent rage as well as genuine anguish on his face as he thinks of an innocent man being punished for something that he did. Gene Tierney doesn't have much to do except look pretty. This is really Dana Andrews' film, a noir character study about a man fighting his own demons, his past, and getting little help from Lady Luck.

The DVD (20th Century Fox 2005): There is a theatrical trailer (2 min), a Photo Gallery of 50 publicity, behind-the-scenes, and movie stills, and there is an audio commentary by film noir historian Eddie Muller. Muller discusses Otto Preminger's visual style, including his fluid camera work, minimal cutting, and blocking of scenes. Also discussed are story structure, the cast, writer Ben Hecht, and the film's noir themes, including its place among ""bad cop noirs"".  Subtitles are available for the film in English and Spanish.",1150502400,5,2501,4.935866983372922
2408297,5,B000B8384Q,"WHERE THE SIDEWALK ENDS is a very good film noir piece of filmmaking. Dana Andrews gives one of his best performances as an introverted NYC cop Mark Dixon whose brutal tactics and demeanor put him on the edge of losing all control of what he should stand for. He is at odds with his superiors, eventually his partner and his own dignity as a human being. When he inadvertently kills a man while investigating a murder he tries to cover it up rather than report it as it happened knowing that his overtly brutal history will defy credibility with the truth. Andrews meets Gene Tierney in the investigation. She is a woman broken by life's disappointments and wants simply to meet a good man to love and be loved. She brings out the tenderness that Andrews keeps suppressed and recognizes that he is truly a good man. However, events turn and twist deepening Andrews' descent into a moral abyss that he seemingly will never escape from as an innocent man is accused of the killing. Andrews brutal facade is tied to kingpin gangster Tom Scalise and Andrews seeks redemption if he can bring his whole history to full circle by taking Scalise down and out. The end results are quite surprising and it strengthens Gene Tierney's faith that she has found the right man and Andrews truly is a man of dignity and worthy of her love. Ben Hecht's script is brilliant putting the viewer through this moral dilemma. Otto Preminger's direction is hard-boiled and seems to have a solid draftsman-like quality about it that unfolds the details of events brilliantly but somehow lacks the emotion behind the tale. Dana Andrews' unheralded performance brings out that emotion visually. His character is a man of few words but the taught expressions seen in his face convey a bitter man haunted and torn looking for something good to come into his life. Gene Tierney's character may seem superficial but she complements and mirrors Andrews' strife exemplifying tenderness while hiding her bitter loved starved emotions holding out as well for something good to come into her life. This is a terrific film and one that you may contemplate as many of its complexities sink into your psyche long after viewing it and can truly be appreciated on reflection.",1149379200,5,2234,4.805194805194805
2408298,4,B000B8384Q,"Dana Andrews stars as hard boiled, belligerent detective Mark Dixon in the Otto Preminger produced and directed ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"".  Gene Tierney playing model Morgan Taylor once again teams up with Andrews as they did so successfully in the classic noir, ""Laura"".

Andrews' abhorence for mobsters was spawned by trying to live down the reputation of his father, a noted gangster.  He was called into an murder investigation of a high roller at a floating crap game hosted by unctuous gangster Tommy Scalise played by Gary Merrill.  The stabbing murder was precipitated by a slap to the face of Tierney who was accompanying the high roller with her soon to be ex husband Ken Paine played by Craig Stevens.

Andrews who had just been dressed down by his boss Inspector Foley for his penchant for violence,  accidently kills Stevens when an interrogation turns violent.  He then proceeds to cover up the crime.  Unfortunately Tierney's father Jiggs played by veteran actor Tom Tully is implicated in Steven's death having visited his flat around the time of the crime.

Andrews and Tierney commence developing a relationship.  Andrews becomes tortured by his decision to cover up the truth and let Tully take the rap.

Preminger does a nice job in presenting the psychological dilemma faced by Andrews as he is torn deciding between right and wrong.  The moody nature of ""Where the Sidewalk Ends"" is typical of the classic film noir.",1149033600,3,1438,4.97071129707113
2408299,5,B000B8384Q,"Dana and Gene are fantastic together - both characters are tortured and they take you with them on their journey to discovering love and what the test of life will mean to them both.

Dana Andrews captures the detective who is fist-fighting his father's legacy with every criminal while trying to rise above it all and do his energy's hate as penance.

Gene Tierney brings home the emotion of a woman who wants to love and be loved, but just picks the wrong guys. Then she runs into Dana Andrews and both of them learn life's lessons of love through a terrible experience that frees everyone.

The film is a bit long, but every moment is filled with character, great visual effects, and black and white is the true film color!  Otto Preminger is at his calculating best.

Film Noir is wonderful.",1145836800,12,795,4.570422535211268
2408300,5,B000B8384Q,"With the crime revealed early in the movie, it is the emotional resolution rather than the criminal identity that remains a mystery throughout the film. A badge can envoke a sense of power. Though that power can be abused, a greater authority -- that of the conscience -- brings one into judgment. A cop (Dana Andrews) with a hot temper goes too far after receiving a reprimand to lighten up. His career and more importantly to him, his reputation which he has tried hard to distance from his criminal father's past, is at stake. The cop seeks an opportunity to free the framed father of the wife (Gene Tierney) of the victim with whom he falls in love. Witness the tortured mind of a triune hero, criminal, and lover as he blurs the boundaries of each. After questionable brushes with danger it is ultimately the conscience that prevails over clever logic and pride.",1142985600,,867,4.673202614379085
2408301,5,B000B8384Q,"Otto Preminger, completing a noir cycle at Twentieth Century Fox, reunited his ""Laura"" leads for this stark, gritty detective drama. Dana Andrews again portrays a cop, but this time he's hardened, cynical and has been accused of police brutality by his superior - ""You don't hate hoods, you liked to beat them up!"". Mark Dixon (Andrews) despises criminals, as his own father was a crook. He doesn't want to be ""Sandy Dixon's kid"" so he became a policeman, but his methods are harsh and hated.

One night, investigating a murder, he unknowingly punches a suspect, Ken Paine (Craig Stevens) so hard that it kills him. A shaken Dixon does his best to cover it up, intending to frame a hated thug, Scalise (Gary Merrill) for the crime. However, the blame falls on Paine's father-in-law, Jiggs Taylor (Tom Tully), whose daughter, department store model Morgan Taylor (Tierney) is estranged from her husband but keeps getting drawn into his gambling schemes. Paine had slapped his wife, enraging her father, who did show up at his son-in-law's apartment, but not until Dixon had departed with the body. With no better suspects, Jiggs is arrested and charged.

Riddled with guilt, Mark falls for Morgan and offers money for an attorney. He decides to take on Scalise anyway but leaves a letter to be given to the department in the event of his death, confessing everything. In the end, he cannot live with the knowledge with what he has done, and he permits the letter to be read by his superior and by Morgan. Despite all the tragic circumstances, Morgan professes her love for Mark and will wait for him.

It was great to find this film on DVD, after so many years of televised obscurity. Eddie Mueller, a film noir historian, provides the commentary and does a good job, but I find his assertion that audiences wouldn't have caught the significance of the casting of the two leads, since ""Laura"" had been made six years earlier. In that respect, he is mistaken because they had appeared in ""The Iron Curtain"" two years prior to WTSE and the film was a box-office success.

Andrews and Tierney were fabulous together, and Ruth Donnelly is tremendous comic relief as restaurant owner Martha, fanning the flames between the detective and the dame.

The night cityscapes give the film an air of menace. Gary Merrill is great as the low-life Scalise, who had a criminal past with Dixon's dad (""Your father liked me,"" he taunts Mark). Karl Malden and a young Neville Brand are terrific also. And Tom Tully is just touching and funny as Morgan's unjustly accused pop.

A watchable film noir with a fantastic cast.",1141171200,6,2602,4.796875

2408303,3,B000B8384Q,"I could not resist the Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney, Otto Preminger combination of this movie as I'm still faint from my encounter with ""Laura"". But similarly to ""Laura"" this movie is not a classic Noir. The nihilistic ""bad cop"" curiously depicted by the unremonstrative Dana Andrews gets redeemed and does the right thing! Since when do noirs have noble anti-heroes who sacrifice themselves for the love of an unbelievable milquetoast like the lovely Gene? There is no femme fatale, no dragging down of our antihero into the muck and mire of despair. There is a moody black and white movie with in interesting story of deceit and the depths of a bad man's black soul but the classic elements of Postwar USA gone bad are not there. Subtly disappointing.
If you want to see a great Preminger/Andrews movie look for Fallen Angel. It will be released in March and while the hero again is ""saved"" by a woman in the end (the Preminger imprimateur?) it is MUCH better than this. Seriously, you guys. If you are swooning over Where the Sidewalk Ends you are going to need your nitroglycerin tablets handy when you watch Fallen Angel"".

Four and a half SINISTER Stars. In this 1950 film-noir crime drama, Where The Sidewalk Ends,  it all begins with the promotion of a new lieutenant (Karl Malden) at the very time his contemporary, tough guy Det. Dixon (Dana Andrews), is the subject of rising complaints. When a murder is committed, the case gets complicated as the investigation proceeds and another significant circumstance occurs. The audience is in on everything that happens for much of the movie which causes tensions to rise even more but a big twist is coming. Starring Dana Andrews, Gene Tierney, Gary Merrill, Bert Freed, Tom Tully, Karl Malden, Ruth Donnelly, and Craig Stevens. Produced and directed by the iconic Otto Preminger. The movie begins with someone stepping off a street curb while whistling a fragment of Alfred Newmans Sentimental Rhapsody (Street Scene) and that theme recurs throughout the movie.

  If you like film noir (which, presumably you do, or you wouldn't be reading this), then you owe it to your self to see this movie (if you haven't seen it already; or, to see it AGAIN if you have). All of the usual attributes of the genre are here  namely: the high-contrast lighting, the off-kilter camera angles, the highly-stylized visual composition, the in-over-his-head-but-doesn't-know-it ""tough guy"" cop/detective, the beautiful damsel-in-distress/femme-fatale, the collection of shady (but, colorful) characters, and the dead body. But  as any true fan of the category knows  just because you have all of the parts doesn't mean that you have a good movie (or, as in some cases, even a watchable one). Well, rest easy noir fans  because this one takes all of the ""usual suspects"" (plus, a few more) and blends them together seamlessly to produce one of the best examples of the art form! I think it's tragic that when people congregate and talk about GREAT examples of film noir, that this movie isn't mentioned more often (if, at all)! See it, then tell your friends about it. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!

  NOTE: This movie is one of the films from Fox Home Video's exemplary ""Fox Film Noir"" series of DVDs (and, in some cases, blu-rays). Every one of the DVDs from this series that I have purchased (e.g.this movie,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/I-Wake-Up-Screaming-1941/dp/B000EXDSBQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">I Wake Up Screaming (1941)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fallen-Angel-1945/dp/B000CNE088/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fallen Angel (1945)</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Boomerang-1947/dp/B000LN6UHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Boomerang (1947)</a>, etc.) has featured a VERY high average bit-rate, along with an EXCELLENT picture (for a DVD) and, at a minimum, good to better-than-good sound.

  See the other reviews for more detail and/or other opinions regarding the plot of the movie.

VIDEO:  1.33:1  B&W  480p  MPEG-2 (8.9 Mbps)

  Within the confines of the DVD format, this film exhibits VERY good, to  on frequent occasions  excellent, picture quality; due, in part, I'm sure, to a MUCH higher than average bit-rate than is normally used for a 4:3 (1.33:1) B&W catalogue title. Also, Fox Home Video doesn't state on the box that this movie has been restored or remastered, but it surely looks like it  because, artifacts such as black specks or white dots are nearly non-existent; and, I saw very few hair-lines, nor do I recall seeing any dropped frames. In addition, sharpness and detail (for a DVD) are usually very good  with the textures and patterns of most hair-styles, clothing and furnishings being easily discernible. Lastly, contrast, gray scale and shadow-detail (again, for a DVD) are VERY good overall, and in many scenes, even excellent. Overall, this movie's presentation on DVD has VERY good picture quality, and should satisfy all but the absolute pickiest of viewers.

AUDIO:  Dolby Digital 2.0 (Dual-Mono, 192 Kbps)

  Fox Home Video has apparently also done some clean-up work on the film's soundtrack, because there are no loud bumps nor objectionably high levels of hiss. Also, dialog is very clear and all voices are easily understood. However, dynamic range is very limited, and there is not much bottom-end nor any top-end to speak of (which makes the musical score and the Foley work all sound a little 'thin', and somewhat less than realistic). Otherwise, considering the age of the source elements and the fact that this is a monophonic, dialog-driven movie from the early 1950s, its audio presentation has more than acceptable sound quality.
