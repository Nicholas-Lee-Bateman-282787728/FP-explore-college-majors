8664766,4,B00L9S1WO0,"This is a Brit crime thriller about a gang of disaffected youths from East London. Tyson (Ashley Chin - `Sket') is the central character who is part of a gang who create honey traps with their female accomplices and then rob the apartments etc, sometimes quite violently. One of the girl friends is Davina, she has the hots for our Tyson and also a rather nice cousin. Tyson has a younger daughter who he has had to bring up for years since his alcoholic mum had abandoned them, but she won't stay out of their lives and like a bad penny keeps cropping up.

This cousin is Tia (Ashley Madekwe `Cassandra's Dream') and has just started a course at a college near Davina and so has moved in. She is blissfully unaware of the nefarious shenanigans of her bigger cousin, but Davina is aware of the blossoming romance that is taking place between her and Tyson, and she is well jealous. Meantimes Tyson wants to get out of the game and go straight, but will events conspire against him? Of course they ruddy well will.

This is a really well acted and directed urban Brit, crime thriller and it is not all about gangs and guns, there is a real heart here too which reflects the title of the film, in that we are all victims of our pasts but can break the cycle. There is much more packed into the eighty minutes of screen time and Jason Maza (`Shifty') as Mannie puts in a fine performance as the bullied younger brother too and he is always good value for money. This is full of street music and beats and a lot of swaggering attitude which of course is mostly ego bravado, but still is a matter of life for many. Some of the language is a bit street too so may confuse English purists, but adds to the realism that is embedded in this film.

This was written by Ashley Chin and Michael Maris who also appears as Jason and has been done so well there must be part of themselves in it, and it is really refreshing to find a small budget Brit crime type film that is actually really very good. Not a violence fest but enough to keep you hooked and a real message without being preachy, very recommended.",1408147200,2,2097,4.330788804071247
