8455617,3,B0053SDQLY,"Taken Away (also released as Gone in a Heartbeat in some markets) revolves around a couple of high school boys who decide to break into a classmate's home when they know the family is at church to retrieve their CDs the boy stole at a party, but denies he has. Inside his house the thrill of the break in makes them steal cash and other stuff too, including a gun. Upon selling the gun the guy who buys it tells them that if they could bring him $100 000, he could guarantee to turn it into a million. Instead of realising the guy is obviously a con artist, the boys are determined to get that cash so they can get the million. How do you get $100 000 when your not the brightest students in the world? Well you steal the school's computers, but when that doesn't work (for obvious reasons) they decide to kidnap the female owner of a local restaurant and get the husband to pay them that money as ransom. So they kidnap her and handcuff her to her car's steering wheel and cover the car with branches, it's also snowing, as soon as they get the money after the husband drops it on the side of the road where they instruct him to, they'll tell the husband where she is.",1448668800,,1169,4.223214285714286
8455618,5,B0053SDQLY,"This American made-for-tv film is being marketed as some sort of horror flick, but just look at the cast!  Michael Tucker & Jill Eikenberry, married to each other in real life, are excellent in the lead roles of this romantic comedy.  Yes, I said romantic comedy!  Shot at identifiable locations in and near Denver, Colorado, this film is fast and fun and well worthwhile.  It should by rights be available in U.S./Canada format.
  Tucker & Eikenberry were in top form, about to leave the cast of ""L.A. Law,"" which they anchored at the time.  I know, that series had no anchor as such, but they were it anyway.  I told them so during the filming of this piece.  Yes, I was in the cast (by a different name), and worked directly with them.  They're great people besides being great performers, and btw, Eikenberry is considerably taller than Tucker, and beautiful into the bargain.",1385164800,,880,4.69281045751634
