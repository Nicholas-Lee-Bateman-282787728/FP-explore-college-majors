7998599,1,B0000CAQ4R,"I don't like this dvd. No question that Artie is an excellent guitar player, but unfortunate he doesn't know how to teach. What happens is that all the time I was trying to figure out what string and fret he was playing. They chopped the dvd (that he probably recorded in one afternoon) in pieces so it moves from one chapter to another without you knowing. There is a small booklet that accompanies the dvd. It is really small, and hard to read. It is not worth 30 dollars. Don't waste your money. It puzzles me why others one this page gave a five star.",1256169600,,555,4.295238095238095
7998600,5,B0000CAQ4R,"This is another excellent production from Homespun.  Artie is an easy-going teacher who presses the material slowly forward.  I have to give him 5 STARS for his enthusiasm alone!  If you have been playing the guitar but would love to start learning leads and don't want to be overwhelmed by some of the 80's loud hair style leads that impress, but leave you helpless, this is a great DVD for you.  Artie is not out to impress, but to teach, and this he does well.  This, along with his two Guitar Jamming DVDs work well together.",1185840000,,529,4.46875
7998601,4,B0000CAQ4R,This DVD is packed with tips and lessons to get you going on becoming a lead guitar player and writer.  A variety of styles are covered for this DVD and will get even a beginner up and going right away.,1141862400,3,202,4.05
