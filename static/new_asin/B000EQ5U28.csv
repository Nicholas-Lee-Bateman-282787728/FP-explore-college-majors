8608275,4,B000EQ5U28,"A good take on a shockumentary, the quality is as if they took the video straight from VHS source, watchable and entertaining, much of the footage is not new in the eyes of a gore hound, but there are a few good tidbits that you could say are rarely seen even on the internet like a cat getting mauled by 100's of mice as to name one. Overall an interesting watch.

*Note: In the 90's when this video was first released it was named Snuff Video: Volume Red",1309824000,,456,4.181818181818182
