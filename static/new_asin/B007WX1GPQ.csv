8522739,5,B007WX1GPQ,"Vettai is an action flick with a little spicy rom/com on the side for dessert . The plot is simple yet different enough to be diverting. Two brothers as different as night and day but both essentially good grow up with one thing remaining constant: One brother takes on the others battles big or small .The twist is that the younger brother (Arya) by two years is the braver and will take on all comers to protect his older but timid brother (Madhaven ) from harm.  Their father is a local cop who is constantly catching his younger son in brawls and having to discipline him not realizing the younger is brawling most of the time to  defend the eldest from bullies.  A dance scene that brings the viewer to present day time is similar to the energy and style of the opening scenes of Dabangg and is a fun way to show the bond the two share in fun and pursuit of pretty girls when things are going smoothly  . All are good times until the older brother accidentally bumps a thug who starts threatening him. He tells his brother and with predictable results Arya starts whooping ass . The police show up and the story starts from there.

 Their fathers death leaves an opening in the police force and the eldest is conned into taking a job as a police officer. He quickly finds himself overwhelmed by local mobsters and vicious gangland acts of violence that are dragged right into the police station. He calls upon his brother when ordered to rescue a kidnapped child from an extreme situation. Enter Arya and some very stylish throwdown. Fun to watch. The story takes quick but needed jaunts into comedy and well placed energetic dance numbers. The local gangland bosses are going at it hammer and tongs and our boy Arya is going to be very busy indeed.  He's going to be needing some diversion. You'll find it here and more. The film has just the right amount of emotion, comedy, and stylized karate action that leaves you very entertained at all times. I was pleased to see that Madhavens character was allowed to change dramatically but in a fairly believable manner with great motivation and hard work. Not some instant cartoon knowledge.

That OPPOSITES ATTRACT is the continuing thread of fun in this film whether it be brothers, sisters or lovers . The writer makes this age old plot vehicle work by making the off set to the male duo an EXACT duplication in the female leads . The girls are introduced in a song and dance number that  goes on to reveal their expectations of life and what they want in a husband . They use great costumes and choreographed native style dances to depict passion in their personalities .For softer scenes a city setting and urban clothing with a more sophisticated look to the dancing that ends in  Arya walking off in a huff with his much beleaguered lady love being dragged off comic caveman style. The intelligence that Aryas character uses to outwit the crooks and  to use their own weaknesses against them is as sexy as watching him lock eyes and lips  with his love interest(oh its just a couple of min here and there.) . Be on the look out for her NRI prospective nerd groom who has come from America to inspect the merchandise. This girl will be Aryas, you just know he won't let that happen with those smoldering eyes reminding you of  Clint Eastwood. That hilarious moment with the towel sealed that deal. Hell what am I saying..she wouldn't allow it. Next up fun in the car whoo hoo.

 These four folks are as  much fun to watch as the butt whooping portions of the movie. This makes for excellent chemistry that you are guaranteed to feel. Love these girls. No Flowers from the hot house are they but they still come across as feminine. Example in one scene, Madhavens wife : They dared to come into my house !!! you BOTH go after them; you don't let anybody come back alive. She's always been proud of her husband the cop since the wedding but now we are too.  I will be on the look out for more films with Arya and Madhaven in them. They looks great in this film . Eastwood would be proud of how brave they were ...to marry those women.",1336348800,,4090,4.475806451612903
