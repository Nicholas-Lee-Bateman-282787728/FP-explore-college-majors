3903538,5,B002C4JUWG,"The Warner Archive transfer easily surpasses the old VHS for clarity.  The TV-movie, sadly, just can't match Zane Grey's epic novel.

3903541,4,B002C4JUWG,"The film makes excellent use of gorgeous landscape, and in that respect is quite faithful to Zane Grey's book of the same name.  Harris and Madigan play off one-another, making convincingly tentative lovers, with Harris fulfilling the Lassiter role as a bit dark, a bit frightening in appearance, but strong and gentlemanly, again true to Grey's Lassiter character.  Madigan is not a Hollywood beauty, but carries herself with strength and grace, creating a convincing Jane Withersteen much like Grey's character.  The movie thinly disguises that Grey's ""bad guys"" were Mormons, suiting a more modern sensitivity.  The movie also eliminates or reduces sub-plots, apparently in the interest of time and focus on the central plot; whereas, the book interweaves the chronology of two plots and four main characters.  Then movie, then, is fun and beautiful--just like the book.",1497571200,2,873,5.343065693430657

3903544,3,B002C4JUWG,"Riders of the Purple Sage, 1996 film

A group of men attack a young man. A stranger arrives to water his horse and asks about the events. He intercedes to free the young man. He tells his name: Lassiter. Is he a killer of innocent men as the preacher says? Lassiter asks about a woman named Millie. Rustlers have stolen cattle. Can Lassiter stop them? That young man watches those rustlers. Two see him and attack him, but his rifle out-shoots their pistols. One is unmasked; its a young woman! Who called in Janes riders so her cattle could be stolen? Lassiter was hired to watch the west herd. Did he kill some men in the north? They deserved it is his Lassiters reply. That young man care for that wounded woman Bess. The deacon tells Jane to get rid of Lassiter, or others will eliminate him. Lassiter visits Jane and stays for supper. Lassiter tracks that young couple, they are staying in an old cliff dwelling.

Bess has recovered. Jane refused to marry Deacon Jones. Lassiter is out to get the man who lured Millie from her husband. Mille Earn was his sister. Lassiter tells Jane about a letter. Riders approach and shoot at that young man, he fires back. Then he shoots another man. Jane tells Lassiter about a family secret. Vern is captured and sentenced to hang. But there are shots, men fall, Lassiter arrives. Vern rides away. Lassiter visits Jane to tell her the news. Later Jane and Lassiter meet Vern and Bess. Lassiter tells Bess who her mother and father are; he is Bess uncle.  Vern and Bess want to leave, but a group of men chase and shoot at them! The men then chase Lassiter and Jane into a rocky area. Can they roll a stone to block the access to the top? Vern and Bess ride off together.

I never read the novel so I cant comment on this adaption. It seemed hard to follow at times, and, wasn't a great story. Im sure the book was better. Zane Grey, a dentist who lived in Ohio, wrote many popular Westerns. Raymond Chandler, an accountant, wrote many private detective stories that were popular and adapted to movies. This movie was filmed in Utah, whose countryside must be different from Wyoming or other states famous for cattle ranching. Are barren and sandy land better than lush grassland?",1494115200,,2222,4.519900497512438

3903547,5,B002C4JUWG,"I have watched this on my cable as a free movie until it was time to have a copy of my own.  The difference was incredible.  It is unfortunate that cable chops up their version until it hardly makes any sense.  The color of my Warners Archive copy is beautiful, it fills the entire screen of my LG Scarlet and the conversations are complete which makes the movie even more enjoyable.  I watched the cable version at least five or six times and I am sure I will watch my personal copy another five or six times.

3903565,5,B002C4JUWG,"This movie is based on one of the classic westerns that created all the cliches and stereotypical characters that everyone else have sometimes just ripped off and sometimes riffed brilliantly on (Eastwood).  For those wanting the hyperkinetic action of superhero and many modern westerns, it may also seem slow, but I enjoyed it very much.
  A good woman in distress asks for help, and gets it from an unlikely and unsavory source: a fearsome gunfighter who is the enemy of her people (unnamed but fairly obvious in the movie but identified as Mormons in the book).  She wants to turn him from his vengeance against her people.  There is a  subplot that could probably have been dispensed with in both the movie and the book with only a small loss, but it is sweet.
  The cinematography and scenery are  also glorious for a TV movie, and there's the rub. It's a TV movie.  The production values falter sometimes--the sound varies in quality and therefore it helps to have close captioning but I read that the CD doesn't (Amazon video does), and the music gets a little repetitive.
  The flow from scene to scene is sometimes weak--a few required knowledge that wasn't presented in the movie  to make sense, and I've read the book (near the very end there seemed to be a contradiction).  As the book was written a hundred years ago and it's plot, dialogue, and characters have become cliche's to a great extent, there was some dialogue that could have been left out.  I definitely did not like the first kiss because it seemed out of character & time & genre, although perhaps it was in the book.
  Another pass by the writers before or during filming would have helped this and much else--in particular the actors who had difficulty making some lines work as well as they should.  Madigan was consistently good, Harris was good most of the time but not always, and the supporting cast varied.
  A 5 star (great) TV movie, but, as filmed, it is really only a 4 star (very good) Hollywood film, mainly because the version I saw lacked the cinematography values (big landscapes and big skies) that all great westerns truly have.",1458172800,4,2125,4.67654986522911

3903570,5,B002C4JUWG,"Of the five or so prior renditions  (including silent-era) that Hollywood turned out of Zane Grey's Riders of the Purple Sage film, the Ed Harris-Amy Madigan-Ted Turner version is closest to portraying Grey's sentiments, in furnishing the proper setting scenery, and in touching lightly on the ""Mormon"" association.  The entire casting was well done also. The same sentiments could also be said of Turner's ""The Avenging Angel"" film (Not a Zane Grey story, but a ""Mormon"" plot.).",1455840000,,479,5.207792207792208

3903572,5,B002C4JUWG,"This beautiful, beautiful film tops my list of all-time favorite movies.  It was a made-for-TV sleeper and now, thankfully, is available on DVD at Amazon for a reasonable price.  The leads are brilliantly acted by Amy Madigan (she played Kevin Costner's chirpy young wife in Field of Dreams) and her real-life husband, the accomplished actor Ed Harris.  More, the scenery is stunning and the background music, sometimes punctuated with the distant cry of a hawk, is both lilting and hauntingly magical.  Much care was taken to follow most of the original story-line of Zane Grey's book, including the dialogue.  This film is so outstanding that it literally pulls you in and takes you there, 150 years ago when Mormon Utah was ruled by a hierarchy of intolerant, brutal men and their shadowy, subservient women.  A great mystery runs through the plot and sub-plots, tying the characters together in compelling ways until all is revealed during the tense and final last minutes.  This also is a story of deep and abiding love on many levels, but there is no sex; nor does the movie need it.  Riders of the Purple Sage is magnificent without artifice and without the usual trappings of modern film stories.  I can't recommend this film to you highly enough.  Please take a chance and buy it.",1454716800,3,1289,4.844748858447488
3903573,5,B002C4JUWG,"I, have seen this movie before and loved I think ed harris is so cool and amy Madigan is oooh so sexy and together they make the screen light up. I had never owned a copy-and still don't due to a shipping error-but have always found it floating around somewhere and watched it. It's exciting to know that when I do get my copy, curl up with my honey-lumps eating skinny-girl popcorn, we're going to be in for a wonderful night. Yum! I give the movie 5Stars.

3903575,3,B002C4JUWG,Based on Zane Grey's book of the same name. The movie makes no mention of the fact that most of the Characters are Mormons and the plot that drives the storyline involves an avaricious Brother who covets the land a single woman has inherited and woman ought not to remain independent. The movie makes of this a range war in which the body count piles ever higher and higher. And since most Westerns are romances at heart count the gunslinger who rides in to rescue the damsel in distress and the ranch hand who nurses the gal he shot as a masked cattle rustler and falls in love. The DVD transfer is full-screen which tends to waste the awesome scenery and the disk offers one option onlyPLAY.,1451520000,,693,4.464566929133858

It was actually my favorite Zane Grey book; however, a lot of water has passed under THAT bridge.  I did not remember all the characters or the entire plot.

3903602,1,B002C4JUWG,"This was a made-for-TV movie that poorly told the story. That's also why it is not widescreen. It is as if the producer told the director, ""You have 98 minutes, and put in some black screen scene changes so we can insert commercials."" and walked away. Then somebody else came in and said, ""Don't say the word 'Mormon'!"" And then somebody else came in and said, ""Make it a love story!"" The end result is a mish-mash of disjoint scenes with hundreds of pages left out, and events that happened far apart in distance and time combined into one. So the movie was incomprehensible even if you are sitting there with the book in your hands. Yes, the sound is mushy, you'll be saying, ""Wha'd he say?"" a lot. I was disappointed in both the major actors. Henry Thomas did a good job. My God, even Lassiter's long monologue was truncated. So much of the story was missing that you couldn't understand what prompted him to speak, and then so much was missing it made no sense. That was the scene that should have drawn a standing ovation. I nodded off. As much as you want this movie, have the grit to just say no and read the book again. Totally thumbs down.

3903606,5,B002C4JUWG,"A classic in the genre, for sure. The blend of vengeance and tenderness in Ed Harris brings this tale a good deal of its power. The underlying honest look at the failure of religious zealotry is a strong message from Zane Grey which is a perfect antidote to the daily barrage of self-righteousness without compassion we see on every screen we watch in these times. Though it is a great film and it's still in my top tier of Westerns, my others, by comparison and higher up the tier are:  ""Lonesome Dove"", ""Open Range"", ""Tom Horn"", 'Unforgiven"" and perhaps the best television ever, the HBO ""Deadwood Series"". So Riders is in the top tier, but it's not at the top of that tier. For sheer Westerns, I always go with ""Gunsmoke"", though, my all-time favorite.",1429401600,2,755,4.592592592592593

3903621,4,B002C4JUWG,"Probably the best version of Zane Grey's popular novel ""Riders Of The Purple Sage"" ever made.  Early versions were silent until the early '40's when George Montgomery starred as the dangerous gunman Lassiter.  This was a entertaining story, but it is a slow tale and told as such.  Lassiter, a known gunman, who has been searching the West for years to find the men who kidnapped his sister and her daughter and has found and finished three of the men, but one still remains.  His search brings him to the range of a 31 year old woman who is under pressure from her religious group to marry one of their group who is anxious to get her ranch and cattle.  She is said to know where his sister is buried.  Many explanations of things are not fully explained but answered in short comments you need to catch to understand, that is the way Grey wrote.  Lassiter's way of life is hard and he doesn't feel apologetic for it at all.  Good western, slow moving as the movie plays out.  I was never pleased with the abrupt ending, but that was the way Zane Grey wrote it.",1421020800,,1062,4.377551020408164

3903630,4,B002C4JUWG,"I don't know why this movie is so scarce, as it is well done and keeps your attention.  The movie is based on a Zane Grey novel, where the good guys are good, and the bad guys bad.  So don't look for it to be altogether believable--it's not--but some things are done better than your typical Western.  For example, it is refreshing to hear an attempt to speak in an old-fashioned manner, instead of the modern trend of using today's language in a setting where it was never spoken.  All in all, this is a good, enjoyable Western.",1418169600,,529,4.36734693877551
3903631,5,B002C4JUWG,"One of the best of the modern westerns. Ed and Amy do proper service to both the story and the history. Ed Harris without words conveys the feeling that a horseman has for his mount. As few actors can he shows the nerve that a gunfighter needs. Amy Madigan shows the frustration of being an independent woman in this era and place. She too conveys a love for horses that cannot be faked or acted.

3903645,3,B002C4JUWG,"There were moments of magic that promised to elevate ""Riders of the Purple Sage"" to a level of sublimity.  Unfortunately, the film does not follow thru.  To its credit the film tries to follow the book reasonably well, with a strong start that it maintains for its first third.  But, from there inertia sets in.  And as the script becomes more and more lackluster, the film devolves into cliche.  Ed and Amy give it their best, but a number of supporting roles lack focus.  By the time the film winds down to its ending, it feels as if it had lost its way and just wished to get it over with.  In the process its grandeur and themes of timelessness and renewal have been obscured.",1413849600,2,680,4.392

I was fully taken in by his descriptive language about both internal and external landscapes.  So, quite natrually, we found the movie on Amazon. I think I would recommend reading it before watching the movie.  There are several anchor points in the movie in which the thread of the story is clarified and turns  entirely on a phrase uttered by a protagonist and which is taken wholely from Zane Grey's writing.  I think I could have mistaken the movie for just another pretty good western, which I love, and missed much of the stories historical relevance. Really good stuff.",1401148800,,752,4.674242424242424

Husband and wife actors Ed Harris and Amy Madigan liked the book so well they made this movie.

The movie plot here is about a mormon woman who has inherited her fathers huge ranch and cattle.
A mormon man wants to marry her and the local bishop is trying to force her to marry this guy, but she doesn't want to.

The producers had the good taste to leave the name of the religion out of the production but the story takes place in the canyonlands of Utah in the 1800 so you know the relegion is mormon.

3903688,5,B002C4JUWG,"This is hands-down the best-looking Western movie I have seen. The landscape is filmed in a way that takes the breath away. In scene after scene, the rugged, soaring cliffs - all rich reds and browns, rough-hewn cathedrals reaching for the heavens - and the sand and bushes valley floors are composed like paintings.

The hard-riding scenes are made equally vivid by the cinematographer and the director. More than in any other movie I've seen, the viewer feels close-up to the straining animals and their urging riders.

So just the way the movie looks is sufficient reason to buy the DVD. It is a feast for the eyes. However, there is much more to this movie.

It also has a first-rate script and performances to savour by the two leads. Ed Harris and Amy Madigan become their characters and with artistic skill convey so much more than just the words. Some scenes where not a word is spoken between them crackle with communication. The script gives all the main actors lines that are laconic, authentic, laden with meaning.

This is a complex film whose images and dialogue convey a sense of strangeness and mysticism that will stay with the viewer.

This is one of the very best Westerns. Watch it on the biggest screen you can.",1386892800,2,1232,4.685185185185185

3903703,5,B002C4JUWG,"I was skeptical about purchasing this film but as a Zane Grey fan I wanted to see a modern portrayal of this famous book. I was pleasantly surprised. Although not as detailed, it is amazingly true to the book. Ed Harris is a very convincing ""Lassiter"". The dialog as well as the beauty of the location brought me back to the wonderful adventure that Zane Grey portrays in his books. I would recommend that the book be read first as this helped me to appreciate the film makers artful presentation of a subject that would be considered mean spirited in our overly sensitive culture. If your looking for special features such as the directors commentary forget it. I found this refreshing as most of that stuff is just filler and contributes little or nothing to the enjoyment of a well made film.

My very personal reason for enjoying this film is that it was made on what was my grandfather's ranch.  Nearly every summer growing up I spent wonderful time there with the cowboys , Indians, and animals.  My favorite building was the one with the deer antlers over the door..  Inside were the saddles, bridles, sweaty horse blankets, and other things that smelled deliciously earthy.",1370304000,30,551,4.639175257731959

It's very weird and disappointing.  Reading some of the reviews here, I guess it might have helped if my family was familiar with the book upon which the movie is based, but it shouldn't be that way.  Regardless, we found a great deal of the movie confusing and pointless.  We wondered what was going on and why.

Beautiful scenery and believable period settings, but I found the story lacked continuity, and didn't explain itself very well, so you may miss some of the next scene while still trying to rationalise the previous one.  I gave this movie three stars for its atmosphere and sincerity, in spite of Ed Harris's continuing discomfort under a cowboy hat (Appaloosa).  Wedging Harris in a Zane Grey story is like casting Tom Selleck in a Louis L'amour western ... it's safe entertainment, nice to look at,  and a good box office bet, but it ain't no Lonesome Dove.  I wish we could please dispense with the repetitive John Wayne-ish requirement for handy gullible citizenry to play off of.  And hey, we don't need no stinkin' romance in a western for it to be a good story.  It just gets in the way, and besides, a cowboy's indispensable companion in L'amour's stories was his horse!",1365206400,4,1065,5.045714285714285
