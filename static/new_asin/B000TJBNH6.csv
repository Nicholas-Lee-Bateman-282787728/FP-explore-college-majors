2903235,5,B000TJBNH6,A wonderful collection of holiday classics everyone can enjoy that brings back great movie making from the past... with both humor and touching heartfelt joy.,1231804800,,158,5.36
2903236,4,B000TJBNH6,"Well, when I first discovered this set on Amazon, I think I was looking for ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" on DVD. I recall watching that in my bedroom on Thanksgiving morning when I was a youth. It had been years since I had actually seen it. It struck me as a sort of Laurel and Hardy Fantasy film almost on the scope of ""Wizard of Oz""....or not. :)
It's Black and White, and rather creepy in parts, and not for reasons that they were aware of at the time it was made, I'm sure. One creepy aspect is the Monkey dressed to look like a not too veiled Mickey Mouse. ;)
Who was in turn chased by The Cat with a fiddle. The 3 little Pigs had creepy masks, and the ""Bogey-Men"" with their long rubbery Claws. :)
I watched it a couple weeks ago with a 13 year old boy, and we both liked it. We saw the humour, and I kept in mind the era in which it was made. MeloDrama and comedy! And Story Book land!!!
""The Bishop's Wife"" was the best surprise to me of the entire set. :)
I love David Niven and Cary Grant, and of course the Beautiful and enchanting Loretta Young.
I had never seen it before purchasing this set, and am surprised that it is not on everyone's must see Holiday flick list!
A very well done classic with an important message, and the viewer is not beaten over the head with it. I tend to be rather sentimental around the Holidays, and this movie had me all warm and fuzzy and stuff. :)
""Pocketful of Miracles"" not worht the time. I was quite disappointed with it, even though it had a star studded cast with the likes of Betty Davis, and Glenn Ford. Maybe I need to watch it again, but didn't really come across as a Christmas flick.",1230336000,,1643,4.1375
2903237,2,B000TJBNH6,"I have seen The Bishops Wife colorized version on t.v.. When I saw this It said in color. I was really excited to get this product. But when it arrived  there was only one movie in color the other two were not ,including The Bishops Wife .That was very disappointing & misleading. It really matters to some people if its b&w , Colorized , Or just color .I think you need to be very clear when your selling a product.",1202688000,24,416,4.2
2903238,3,B000TJBNH6,I just kept the Bishop's Wife.  The package was too diverse to appeal.  The Bishop's Wife was wonderful and inspiring.  There are angels -- I've encountered them -- just need a reminder.  Kaye,1201392000,2,192,4.7272727272727275
2903239,4,B000TJBNH6,"This holiday three DVD collection released by MGM gives us alot in a small package for a reasonable price.
First off the mark is Frank Capra's ""Pocketful of Miracles"" ***.It is a story of a street vendor/walker by the name of Apple Annie(Bette Davis)whose apples are considered to be a good luck charm for the local gangster Dave the Dude(Glenn Ford).Annie it seems has raised enough money over the years off the street to send her daughter to Spain to be raised and educated(Ann Margarets'debut performance).Now her daughter is coming back to see her and be wed not knowing Annies' true self. Dave steps in and tries to help.
It is a long movie but has a terrific cast including Peter Falk who does a great job as Daves' street wise cracking ""associate"".But unfortunately even though the movie has alot of nice moments throughout its' pacing and story line is uneven. The end scene comes unexpectedly swift and is in a way anti-climactic. The holiday season is mentioned only fleetingly and I have never felt this much of a holiday entry as compared to say ""It's a Wonderful Life"" which is a definite classic of the genre and in a league far above this movie. Not one of Capra's best by far.
The next entry is ""The Bishops'Wife"" **** 1/2. This is just a lovely and,if I can use the word,gentle movie. It involves a Bishop Brougham(David Niven)and his wife(Loretta Young).Both are currently struggling with their lives(especially the Bishop) to raise funds to build a new cathedral. In steps angel Dudley(Cary Grant) into the works to help out the pair. In time we see that not only are the pair struggling with the new building but with their marriage also. Dudley deals with the Bishops' wife more on a personal level(much to the Bishops' chagrin) and steers the Bishop onto more productive paths in a more indirect way. In the end,in sometimes the most unexpected but heart warming ways,Dudley finally accomplishes what he set out to do.
This is a wonderful movie,a great change of pace and like ""Miracle on 34th Street"" has that ""gentle"" feel to it. I highly recommend it to all.
The last entry and the cream of the crop is Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy's ""Babes in Toyland"" ***** .To be more familiar with modern audiences they have put the TV version name ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"" on the box cover for all three of the movies and on the individual slip case cover. But this is NOT one of the many cut,pasted,colour copied,sloppily transferred wanna-be's that are currently on the market(see my previous reviews on those).I am finally relieved to be able to tell you this is the ORIGINAL theatrical version with the original title cards intact from beginning to lovely end!!
The story involves two fairy tale type characters Ollie Dee(Oliver Hardy) and Stannie Dum(Stan Laurel) who live in Toyland with many fairy tale characters. They eventually butt heads with the meanest man in Toyland Barnaby who gets the two in trouble on some trumped up charges. He then proceeds to get Tom-Tom,a rival for the hand of Bo-Peep,sent away on false charges to Bogeyland. The Boys exonerate Tom-Tom and set about to rescue him and Bo Beep from the clutches of the bogeymen and Barnaby who has decided to invade and take over Toyland with his hairy hoard. In the end Barnaby and the Bogeymen are defeated and they all live happily ever after.
It's a wonderful tale that has delighted viewers for over 70 years(!) and thanks to MGM we FINALLY have it released the way it was meant to be and SHOULD be seen. The print is excellent.
In conclusion the ""Holiday Collection"" is well worth the price for your money considering what you get. Each movie is in a thin pak and none have any special features but the titles are well worth(and more) the modest price being charged.""Pocketful of Dreams"" is the weakest entry in the pack while ""The Bishop's Wife"" and ""Babes in Toyland"" are the stars here. The latter is especially signifigant as it's in its' original form and COMPLETE!
Enjoy.",1201046400,34,3975,4.720863309352518
2903240,5,B000TJBNH6,"I bought this collection because it had two of my favorite Christmas Classics on it:  March of the Wooden Soldiers (absolutely FABULOUS and The Bishops Wife (another FABULOUS feature).  March of the Wooden Soldiers starring Laurel and Hardy is, I think, one of their best.  I've seen this movie at least several hundred times and I still laugh each and every time Ollie asks Stan how he got downstaris so fast and Stan replies ""I fell out the window.""  Just one of the classic lines from this wonderful movie.",1200787200,16,509,4.685393258426966
2903241,5,B000TJBNH6,"Really enjoyed seeing these gems again. Especially being able to see the last Capra classic and this Laurel & Hardy movie on DVD!
All three of the movie transfers were excellent. Great value...thank you!",1200096000,5,203,5.0
2903242,5,B000TJBNH6,"Here is a nice little Holiday film collection with a huge surprise! Most everyone is familiar with these titles and all of them have been out prior to this release. However, Laurel & Hardy's March of the Wooden Soldiers has never been released in quite the way it has here - complete, uncut, excellent transfer and the original studio logo and title cards for --- Babes In Toyland! Finally, after years of television ""butchering"" and copyright battles, one of Laurel & Hardy's best is available as it was originally released.  Thanks to 20th Century Fox and MGM for releasing this little piece of film history.",1193356800,100,610,4.809523809523809
2903264,2,B000TJBNH6,"I was trying to find The Bishop's Wife DVD as a Christmas present for my mom. I found this set for about the same price as I was finding the individual movie for, so I decided to get this set. I'm not too big of a fan of these movies, but according to my mother, the only movie she liked out of this set was The Bishop's Wife, but that's purely her opinion. Received the product fine and quality was fine.",1323216000,,405,4.012345679012346
2903265,3,B000TJBNH6,"I bought this MGM holiday package last year and just got around to watching it.  I already had The Bishop's Wife (colorized) that I had taped on VHS and I had Pocketful of Miracles that I bought as VHS and wanted to replace these two on DVD.  I watched The Bishop's Wife on Christmas Day and although it was not colorized it still remains a holiday favorite. It depicts an American culture of a much gentler time, plus, American actresses in the 30s and 40s were much more highly accomplished than their counterparts of today and are a joy to watch.

I had read a few negative reviews of Pocketful of Miracles and couldn't understand why.  I thought the movie was wonderful until I started watching it in the MGM version this morning.  I still have a full screen TV and first of all the wide screen aspect was too severe.  Then there was something wrong with the color.  I fiddled around with my color correction for a while but then finally gave up.  If I were watching this for the first time I think I would have given it a poor review as well.  This version has a harshness that is absent in the VHS version.  I guess I won't donate the VHS to the library but will keep it for as long as my doddering old VCR comtinues to play.",1293321600,,1231,4.267241379310345
2903266,4,B000TJBNH6,"I was pleasantly surprised by the colorization of these movies which make them somewhat updated for our grandkids enjoyment.  Each film is definitely a tradition for the Christmas Season.

All of these are such classics.  We loved them all and will keep them around for many Christmases to come!",1291939200,3,295,4.979591836734694
2903267,3,B000TJBNH6,Loved The Bishops Wife and Pocketfull fo Miracles.  Did not care much for March of the Wooden Soldiers.,1264809600,,103,4.722222222222222
2903268,5,B000TJBNH6,I am very pleased with the MGM Holiday Classics Collection. And it comes with Spanish subtitles and audio.,1262044800,,106,4.944444444444445
2903269,3,B000TJBNH6,"Christmas magic can be hard to see. It's A Wonderful Life did not light up the box office, and CBS execs thought the Charlie Brown Christmas a bit lame. Yet both continue to draw huge audiences annually for their simple charm and honesty. They may have lacked the usual qualities that make films work, yet they clearly are loved by people the world over.

Christmas magic is doubly hard to make. This package of three vaguely Christmas movies has some nice touches, but nothing that will make you eager for Thanksgiving and the opportunity to laugh and weep again. The Bishop's Wife has a number of delightful scenes, and some glorious acting, but for me at least felt a tad wooden. I just wasn't entranced, and the breath-takingly obvious ending and weird supernatural intervention was awkward. Not bad, but not much either.

Pocketful of Miracles, Capra's valiant attempt to recapture the beauty of IAWL, flounders for a number of reasons. First, while the sets are beautiful, they are clearly and horribly phony. Nothing in this film looks vaguely real. Maybe if he had used the soft focus black and white I would have bought in, but from the first scene to the last, I was ever aware that this world was studio made, with no humans ever there before or after.

I have never understood why Glenn Ford was a star. Here he dashes around flailing his arms and stomping his feet, all the while looking as believable as a three year old in the middle of a temper tantrum. Hope Lange was more beautiful than I remember, but also more limp. And Peter Falk plays the cartoon gangster who repeatedly reminded me of Robert Klein's routine on The Little Rascals, where everyone begins their sentences with ""Say.....""

Not a bad film, with many great moments and a delightful supporting cast. But not a classic either.

And while I am a massive fan of Laurel and Hardy, I had missed nothing by not seeing March of the Wooden Soldiers before. One tedious and forced sequence after another, interspersed with some bad operetta singing and head-scratching plot twists.",1262044800,,2056,4.7478991596638656
2903270,5,B000TJBNH6,"I have seen ""The Bishops Wife"" many times before and have always really enjoyed it.  Love to just watch it over again, every so often. So am very happy to add this show to my collection.
  I had never seen Laurel and Hardy in the ""The March of The Wooden Soldiers"".  But had enjoyed their other films.  This was a very different and enjoyable story.
  So far I have not watched ""Pocketfull Of Miracles""  I am however familiar with it, but ""The Bishops Wife"" is by far my favorite of this trio of shows!",1235865600,,502,4.26595744680851

8209765,1,B000TJBNH6,"The movies in this collection are all wonderful, in fact The Bishop's Wife is my all time favourite.  I purchase this DVD as the search and description was that all the movies were colour, however only Pocket of Miracles was.  For this reason only I have to rate this a one star (if you are not looking for colour versions), 4 stars out of 5 (if you are not).  All these movies are vintage Christmas, and should be watched every year.",1382313600,,434,4.333333333333333

8209768,5,B000TJBNH6,"Over the years I have owned many prints both 16mm & 35mm of this film.  All were edited versions of ""March of the Wooden Soldiers"".  I was a little skeptical about this version.  But I bought it anyway.  I am so glad I did.  So here is my opinion as been working in film restoration for more years than I wish to admit.  First, this looks like it was taken from a 35mm fine grain preservation print.  Most of the pre print flaws I've seen for years are not there.  The contrast is super sharp.  This version is the best I have ever seen.  The only flaw is the last reel (10 min) has a black scratch running on the far right side of the picture.  Really? REALLY??  Hey MGM folks there are ways to clean that up these days.  Be it wetgate, or post transfer digital software.  But I highly recommend this version over all others.  Yes I do have the other most popular version.  The one that gives you the choice of B&W or color versions.  These are dubbed from the old Goldwyn laser disc.  In fact the B&W version has a copyright notice from the colorized version.  So it looks just like the color version with the color turned off.  This version looks like it is from the same pre-print as the MGM disc.  However they cleaned up the scratch in the last reel.  This version is nice but not a great transfer.  It is a little muddier than the MGM disc.  In all, I highly recommend the MGM version even with the scratch.",1352419200,3,1414,4.209737827715355
8209769,5,B000TJBNH6,"I actually did not keep this product.  I ordered it as a Christmas gift and then discovered someone else had also gotten it for the same person.  So, I sent mine back and ordered something else.  The service was excellent, very prompt, no questions asked, very pleasant.  I would definitely do busy with this seller again.",1325721600,,322,4.696428571428571
