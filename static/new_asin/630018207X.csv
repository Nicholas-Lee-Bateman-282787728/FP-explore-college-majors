218647,5,630018207X,"I have seen both movies, of course ""The Other Side of the Mountain"" and this one.  It's always heartbreaking to see a young life at the peak of a dream they have worked so hard for, come to such a disasterous end.  Jill Kinmont was a great skier and slated for the olympics until she dived off a mountain leaving her paralyzed from the chest down.  She is a very brave person and I have great admiration for all her courage and the way she fought her way back to doing something in life she loved. She had many tragedies in her life, with her boyfriend deserting her after the accident, and the boy she later loved getting killed in a plane accident, and the Father she adored dying.  Thank goodness she had a wonderful Mother willing to care for her completely and she had her job cut out for her.  She required a lot of care.
Timothy Bottoms came on the scene and it was almost love at first sight for both of them.  How many men in the world would want that kind of responsibility?  Yet, he did!  It would take someone very special and obviously he is.  She was fortunate enough to have had two men love her like that.  I thought this was a wonderful movie and knowing it is a true story makes it even more special.  I will watch it over and over and recommend it highly to anyone.",997142400,15,1284,4.2
218648,1,630018207X,"Not liking this movie in no way reflects critically on the skier's life and misfortune; understand that first.  That having been said, I have to tell you that I hated this movie and the  Hallmarkesque treatment it gave this skier's tragic story.  The filmmakers didn't care about Kinmont; they had both eyes on the audience, with plenty of Kleenex at the ready.  I used to discuss one part of this movie in my college English classes as an example of how not to tell a story:
SPOILER ALERT
For those of you who saw it, remember when the phone call comes, informing the family of her lover's death?  I swear, that call was followed by a slow pan across each family member's face as he or she cried, culminating in Marilyn Hassett bawling away for us.  Am I right?  How can a movie move anyone to tears when it's doing all the crying?  This was the visual equivalent of purple prose, but, as you can see from the other posts here, purple prose sells, else it wouldn't exist.",977097600,,972,4.421348314606742

218863,1,630018207X,"Update: Tried watching it again today; and continued to receive Error1001.3172; also the lines remain, which is why I lowered the rating. I rely upon Amazon Prime; and their Instant Video's for a large portion of my viewing pleasure; but this time I am very disappointed. I purchased another video last week; and it plays perfectly, no lines, no choppy dialog. I hate to throw good money @ a situation; and purchase the movie in HD w/ out knowing there would be a marked improvement, if anyone has experience w/ the HD version I'd greatly appreciate the input, as I said, very disappointed.

I love this movie; and have searched for it for years, but it took forever to play, error after error appearing, and when it did eventually come on it was as though I were watching it on Video Tape; there were lines throughout from the title sequence through to the wedding scene @ the end, and some dialog was chopped. I didn't purchase the HD version; so I can't speak to whether it would be better.

As I said; it's a wonderful movie, one of my favorites, just wish it had the quality I'd hoped for.",1393891200,2,1094,4.492462311557789

The acting is well done as well.

I highly recommend this product.",1391040000,,109,4.142857142857143
218908,5,630018207X,To truly appreciate this film you must see part one. Having grown up in Bishop California and having the privilege of knowing Jill personally I can say this truly captures the courage and love the film embodies.,1390694400,,211,4.72972972972973
218909,5,630018207X,I remember seeing this movie years ago and loved the touching story.  I had always wanted a copy of it for my DVD library so was glad to finally purchase it.,1390262400,,157,4.064516129032258
218910,5,630018207X,Purchased this for a gift for my sister.  She had seen this movie a long time ago and it was one of her favorites.  She had taped it from TV years ago and the VCR tape had deterioraed.  She remarked that she wasn't able to find it on DVD.  I checked Amazon and they had it.  Surprised her with it and she was so happy.,1390176000,,318,3.830769230769231
218911,4,630018207X,"This gets a 4 as the first movie was far better. I enjoyed both however I wondered why it was made at times yet it is a good movie. I wanted it to be like the first (which I really cared for) and it wasn't. That is the reason I am not as strong on it as I was the first. It is a wonderful story however and I am glad I have both. The second is more about how she pulled her life together, the courage and strength. It played the positive more then the hard times I know exist in recovering from such a terrible accident. It does complete her story which overall is inspiring as is what she did with the rest of her life. Well worth having, a great family movie.",1389830400,,661,3.903703703703704
218912,5,630018207X,"This was an excellent true story from long ago. We would give this a higher rating if it were possible. All customers, please buy both parts for the complete story.",1389225600,,164,4.5
218913,5,630018207X,True story......tragic accident happened to a beautiful skier yet she triumphed over and over again. This was beautifully presented. Loved it!,1388966400,,142,5.809523809523809
218914,5,630018207X,Best sequel that complements the first part. It needed to be made to bring the story to it's proper conclusion. Again a great musical soundtrack.,1381363200,2,145,4.84
218915,5,630018207X,the Other Side of the Mountain is an exceptionally heartwarming movie.  It gets us to believe in love and the possibility to go beyond and handicap and go for your dreams and believe in yourself.  It has always been one of my favorite movies of all time.  I love to see it over and over again. It is a beautiful love story.  thanks again,1379635200,,337,4.21875
218916,5,630018207X,"I love this movie. Had it years ago on VHS was so glad to get it.
Excellent shape  plays great
Fast shipping.",1378684800,2,109,3.9545454545454546
218957,3,630018207X,"This movie is not nearly as good as the first one. I feel Timothy Bottoms was not believable in his role, and the movie relies too much on the plot of the first one. It is like it is hoping we do not see the similarities. I know it is based on the real life of the main character but to me it is a bit too similar to the first one.",1377302400,,331,3.611111111111111
218958,2,630018207X,I won't watch it again so it was a waste of money.  It is rated PG but the language in it was offensive to me using the Lord's name in vain.  Shame on them.  The story was ok but you don't have to put that kind of language in it.  PG ratings shouldn't have language in it.  Do you want it back?,1377216000,,294,3.6774193548387095
218959,5,630018207X,IT IS MY ALL TIME FAVORITE AND CAN'T WAIT TO RECIEVE IT IN THE MAIL...  I hope that is what I was looking for.,1373068800,3,110,3.5833333333333335
218960,5,630018207X,Continueing from first one she is a teacher first one to be in wheelchair.  Another love story.  A happy ending. I highly recommend this film to.,1371686400,,145,4.538461538461538

218962,5,630018207X,"I have been a fan of this movie since I was a a child  I have a physical disability called infantile cerebral palsy I have to use a power wheelchair to get around, it takes a  real special person in this case a man ""and it wasn't bad that he was good looking too"" it just shows that all people with a  disability men or women have a right to fall in love.",1362614400,4,355,3.835616438356164

grate for the whole family to watch together",1361059200,,98,3.95
218965,5,630018207X,"Great story with heartwarming moments and just a real clean old fashion romantic movie for every family member to see. It's a true story and sad at times because it has to do with a champion skier who fell over a cliff in a race, but shows the endurance and the struggle it took for her become self sufficient again and what she accomplished to become.  It was just a great inspirational feel good movie!",1360972800,,404,4.386666666666667

218999,5,630018207X,"This is the best movie (even though it's an older one) and so inspirational. After I saw the movie the fist time, I decided to name my daughter after Jill Kinmont (the woman the movie is about) and that is, in fact, what I did. I am going to give her this new DVD copy I ordered from Amazon along with The Other Side Of The Mountain (Part I) for Christmas. Great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.",1348790400,,405,4.075
219000,4,630018207X,"In this film Jill Kinmount finds love in her 40's. Its a good story because it allows you to see how hard it really is to care for a quadrapalegic. As I stated previously, the first film is my favorite film of all time. You must view it to really get the scope of the whole story. In part two Jill is afraid to love again because any man she had ever loved had died. I won't ruin the story but i will tell you this,see the movie before you ever read the book. In reality, John Booth did not always treat Jill well. He drank constantly and anyone who knows anything about addiction understands when you carry a beer around in your front shirt pocket something isn't right. Oh well,as a love story its a good film. Timothy Bottoms is great to look at and Jills best friend was in it as well. Belinda J.Montgomery who played Audrey Jo in the first film is in this one too. After viewing the first film, I would have never believed Linda Myers went to the Olympics, but she did. I recommend you get the set. Part1 and 2.",1337990400,,1016,4.16243654822335

219002,4,630018207X,"Bought for my mother-in-law, to complete the two-film set. Brownie points with M-I-L, FTW. The Universal Vault series of MOD videos is a great way to get old, lesser-known films that don't have broad commercial appeal.",1328659200,,218,5.083333333333333
219003,5,630018207X,"This film takes up about ten or fifteen years after the original film.  Jill Kinmont (Marilyn Hassett) has now become a role model for quadraplegics by becoming a successful school teacher in Los Angeles.  There's an underlying sadness to her, though.  She does not have a true love in her life.  Qualify that by saying that she does not allow love to come into her life for fear of being hurt.  Enter John Boothe(Timothy Bottoms) a kind-hearted truck driver.  Despite Jill's protestations Boothe will not go quietly into the night.  The central romance here is touching and believable not in a Hollywood cliched way.  I viewed this film after seeing the original.  I wondered if it could aesthetically stand alone without the original.  The answer is a resounding yes because the sequel successfully references the first film through flashbacks that fill in the blanks.  Would I give the film five stars if I hadn't seen the first?  That's something I'll never know.  I asked my wife which film she liked better and she said resoundingly she preferred the second.  Interesting.",1327190400,6,1078,4.916666666666667
219004,5,630018207X,Excellent and emotional movie. Great present. Perfect timing for a Christmas present. Would definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is into true stories.,1325376000,,159,5.666666666666667

I am very satisfied with this product.  Thank you.",1324684800,4,324,4.333333333333333
219006,5,630018207X,"I was thrilled to get a copy of this VHS tape.  I saw the movie when it was first released in the theaters.  Jill Kinmont is a very unique person who did not let a tragic skiing accident ""stop"" her from living.  Any teacher should see this film.",1322438400,,245,4.0625
219047,5,630018207X,I really liked seeing what happened to Jill Kinmont in this sequal movie although I thought the acting was not as good as in the first film. I am glad however to have this movie in my dvd collection. If you like movies about real people then you will like this movie.,1319932800,,267,4.153846153846154
219048,3,630018207X,"Haven't seen this movie in ages and was glad it became available on Amazon.  Jill Kinmont deserves a happy ending after all she's been through and it is heartwarming to see her fall in love again.  Marilyn Hassett and Timothy Bottoms make an attractive couple, but I thought the chemistry was better between Hassett and Beau Bridges in Part 1.  Bridges' character, Dick, had a wild and unpredictable streak making him a more exciting suitor compared to the polite truck driver, John (Bottoms).  Jill's mom is the only family member we see in Part 2.  I liked the family interaction in Part 1.  Jill's best friend, A.J, also appears in Part 2 and there are some flashbacks to the original movie.  It is an inspirational story (how can you not root for Jill?) and the dvd quality is clear.  Hassett is a pretty actress from the past.  I'd say it is worth watching.  I'm also guessing this will appeal to fans of the Hallmark Channel Movies!",1318809600,,938,4.596385542168675
219049,5,630018207X,"This movie was a really good movie. It is the continuing true story of Jill Kinmont the Olympic hopeful in skiing who had a tragic accident that left her alive but with so many challenges to meet afterward. She finds her way in the world through teaching and in meeting her husband-to-be John Boothe. This sequel is mainly about her courtship, romance and eventual marriage to John. Marilyn Hassett and Timothy Bottoms do great jobs portraying Jill and John. It is very moving inspiring and real. REAL LOVE does happen for some people in this life and this couple found it with each other. Jill's mother has always been Jill's caretaker so John must learn how to take on that responsibility. Jill has some serious emotional challenges to work through before she can marry John. In the end they marry and are now livivg in Bishop California where they both grew up. If you love a TRUE HAPPY ENDING then give this movie a chance!!",1312761600,,928,4.63030303030303
219050,5,630018207X,"This has to be one of the most touching movies I have ever seen. Marilyn Hassett is so appealing as the sweet but very unhappy Jill Kinmont, the one who wrongly comes to believe that she is a ""jinx"" to others around her; in a sense she blames herself for the death of her father and her first lover. Timothy Bottoms, in perhaps in best role, plays the part of a person unhappy himself, thanks to a previous unfortunate, failed relationship. The two come to realize that they cannot do without each other, both feeling so much void in their lives and each finding in the other the one that can fill the void. I choke up thinking about this wonderful movie. The California scenery was beautifully breath-taking and, again, the story was heart-warming.",1288742400,,749,4.597014925373134
219051,3,630018207X,Other Side of the Mountain 2 was a little boring compared to The Other Side of the Moutain. It was still a good movie though.,1232323200,,125,4.04
219052,4,630018207X,"I enjoyed Pt 2 far better than part one. The chemisty between Hasset and Bottoms was very obvious and worked really well in making you feel like you were watching them actually fall in love with one another.  I am updating my video collection and can't find a DVD version of this movie for the life of me.  Makes me very frustrated that so many ""shoot them up"" type movies with gratuitous violence are immediatey put in DVD format while a gentle love story with a solid message regarding disabled people mainstreaming into our society cannot be made available in the modern DVD format. The movie sends a great message to people (especially disabled phobs) and should be made into DVD format so kids, teens and young adults with DVD players can view and learn a few valuable lessons in tolerance, how love comes in many forms and most of all, how people with a disability can lead productive lives, meet a ""signficant other"" and be independent of overly protective parents, friends and learn to live a life of their own with whoever they chose to and hold down a job, as well.",1131321600,17,1075,4.564766839378239

219054,2,630018207X,"The movie is so much better than the book because they have drastically changed the personality of John Boothe. If they had written the movie character's personality the same as the book character's personality, not many people would want to see the movie. I read both of the books and they were very interesting to read.  Once I read the book that this movie is taken from, I couldn't really enjoy the movie.  Jill Kinmont is great in both the book and the movie.  However, in the book John Boothe is written as a person with many character flaws--including bigotry.  The movie doesn't reveal his true character at all.  After reading the book and finding out what a jerk Mr. Boothe really is I didn't really like this movie at all.  Both Marrilyn Hasset and Timothy Bottoms are wonderful in this movie, despite the story being written so different than the book.  (Although I understand why they wouldn't want Mr. Bottoms to protray his character as Mr. Boothe really is.)

The movie might be worth seeing for the acting and to learn more about Jill Kinmont.  However, I didn't enjoy it at all because the John Boothe that is written about it such a jerk I HATED for a person as brave and strong as Jill Kinmont to marry a person with such bad character flaws.",1109894400,3,1262,4.548672566371682
219055,4,630018207X,"The continuation of the struggle of Kinmont is occassionally met with setbacks, and her insensitivity to other people as well as to her own. The dialogues tends to be off the mark, but the most heart warming scene is the extreme sensitivity of her new boyfriend who loves her unconditionally and who wants to help her inspite of her disability. The fault is not the actors who portayed the life of Kinmont with dignity, and those who surround her with their influence. Its hard to say how much I like the movie on the first part, but I love the part of  love and how it is spoken from the heart. Rating for coarse language is not included in this review.",1029456000,6,654,4.404958677685951
219056,5,630018207X,"I have seen both of the Other Side of the Mountain movies. But Part 2 touched me the most.  Jill Kinmont is an inspiration and John Boothe is a hero.  I feel the movie captured the immediate attraction and eventually love felt by Jill and John.  What makes this a great love story is that it is a true love story.  Marylin Hassett and Timothy Bottoms had tremendous chemistry (Marilyn and Timothy should have made more movies together) and I am sure made Jill and John Boothe proud with their performances. This is a great ""date movie"".",1020816000,8,536,4.494845360824742
