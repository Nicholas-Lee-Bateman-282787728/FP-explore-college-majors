The problem - and it's a huge problem on the screen - is the cerebral, theatrical dialogue, which works in a theatre  but not on the screen. In short, nobody in real life speaks like this, ever, and it's irritating. And the actors seem so intent on seizing the moment for themselves, that there's no connection between them. There's a scene between Burton and Eileen Atkins at a dinner table, where both actors seem to be talking to themselves and not each other. The only scenes that really work are the ones between the psychiatrist and the boy's father. Peter Firth is excellent, and Jenny Agutter is good, but Richard Burton with his attention seeking delivery is hammy, as is Joan Plowright, who is dreadful as the boy's mother. It's not helped by the grim brown photography either, and the unimaginitive staging. I thought it was a bit of a mess. Burton on the stage in this would have been an entirely different story.",1406764800,,1058,4.622340425531915

""Peter Shaffers psychosexual mystery play Equus was brought to the screen in 1977 by director Sidney Lumet. Renowned as an actors director, Lumet brings forth from his cast a handful of magnificent performances in a realistic interpretation of a very stylized, symbolic play. The movie itself cant live up to its electrifying stage counterpart, but in its own rather trundling way, it provides an engrossing if a trifle elongated examination into the troubled psyches of its two protagonists while telling its horrific tale of emotional and physical mutilation and at least partial redemption.

 Dr. Martin Dysart (Richard Burton) has made a career of handling troubled teenagers, and his chief of staff Hesther Saloman (Eileen Atkins) brings him a most perplexing case: a seventeen-year old boy Alan Strang (Peter Firth) has purposely blinded six horses in a fit of seeming insanity and now in a state of near catatonia, refuses the help of his parents (Joan Plowright, Colin Blakely), the friendly girl (Jenny Agutter) at the stable where the heinous act occurred, or the stables owner (Harry Andrews) who up until the moment of the act had sung the praises of his young worker as his best-ever stable hand. As Dysart begins probing into the backgrounds of those involved with Alan as well as Alans own subconscious, he begins to find chinks in his own character and begins questioning his own lifes work as possibly something unworthy of really helping anyone, even himself.

Peter Shaffers play explores themes of masculinity and femininity, of obsession and transference, and of guilt and innocence with a razor-sharp scalpel with stylized representations of horses by masked men. A film told in more traditional fashion no matter how skillfully and with some unquestionably awe-inspiring images (Alans nightly roamings with his horses are captured in moody, moonlight beach scenes that Lumet sears in our brains) cant quite manage to impart the masculine-feminine obsessions of the play when real horses are being used. An event in Alans youth captured in a flashback when a black-suited horseman astride an enormous black steed is spoken of as a single entity (man and horse as one) comes as close as realistically possible to the stage stylizations, but that image must carry the viewer through the entire film as Alan begins his obsessive worship and obeisance to the god Equus. The solution to the films mystery as to Alans motive for blinding animals whom he venerates above all others becomes clearer and clearer as we get to know the parents though the ultimate act which immediately precedes the vicious attack (shown in excruciating if quickly edited close-ups) is a long time coming and which astute viewers may have arrived at long before we see it acted out in real time and (one must say surprising even for 1977) featuring complete male and female frontal nudity.

Lumet has directed his cast to a person to explosive, unforgettable performances. Richard Burton had been a replacement Dr. Dysart on Broadway (Anthony Hopkins opened the show in the part) and became one of the few actors ever honored with a Tony Award as a replacement star in a long-running show. The movie camera allows us to get up close and personal with his performance in its quiet moments as well as its intense ones as he fumbles and fumes, plots and plans his approaches to reaching the troubled teen while simultaneously struggling with his own demons. Peter Firth had already played the role of Alan in both the original London and Broadway incarnations, and yet his performance is so alive, so raw that one would never have guessed he had done it already for over a thousand times. (Both actors were Oscar-nominated but outrageously lost to others; they each did win the Golden Globe in the leading and supporting categories.) Joan Plowright as Alans religious mother and Colin Blakely as his agnostic father etch deeply felt portrayals of people who want to appear innocent but inwardly know they share guilt in their sons transgression. Jenny Agutter offers a light, bright, and appealing friend to Alan while Eileen Atkins and Harry Andrews are both forceful and impressive in other key supporting roles.

Video Rating: 5/5  3D Rating: NA
 The films original 1.85:1 theatrical aspect ratio is faithfully reproduced in this 1080p transfer using the AVC codec. Sharpness is consistently excellent offering great detail (dye jobs on Burton's hair and sideburns seem to come and go), and color is natural and carefully modulated throughout with realistic skin tones. Contrast is nicely maintained and black levels are striking with some eye-catching shadow detail in specifically charged dramatic moments. The film has been divided into 12 chapters.

Audio Rating: 4/5
 The DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0 sound mix is very emblematic of its era. Superbly recorded dialogue never gets overpowered by Richard Rodney Bennetts spare score or the sound effects which are intrinsic to the action of the story. There are no age-related artifacts to spoil the aural presentation.

388348,3,6301966449,"Peter Shaffer's beautiful drama ""Equus"" is a marvel of theatricality on the stage.  The terror of the teenage angst ridden boy blinding six horses because ""his God has seen his sin"" is a majestic, even beautiful climax of an intriguing story on the stage.  But all of the art, all of the theatricality, is reduced to realism on film.  What on stage was a beautiful depiction of first love turns into an unending naked romp (which even includes the only glimpse I can recall of an erect penis in an R rated movie).  But where the movie strikes out is in the realistic, bloody, gastly, terrifying blinding of the horses on the giant screen.

The movie was good - the mother in the movie was awesome compared to the mother in the play - but Daniel Radcliffe as the main character in the play was just all over the role ... he was amazingly awesome.  Very believable.  The movie with Richard Burton as the main character was a bit stilted - if you have never seen Equus it is a classic and worth seeing and if you can't see Daniel Radcliffe in the role I think this is the next best thing.,1376784000,,590,4.068965517241379
388352,4,6301966449,"Having seen Anthony Hopkins live in the stunning original John Dexter staging of Peter Shaffer's powerful, mythic psychodrama, I had unfairly high expectations when I originally saw Sidney Lumet's fine though slightly flawed film version.

However, on the positive side, I had no complaints whatsoever about the performances, for Harry Andrews, Colin Blakely, Joan Plowright, Jenny Agutter and Eileen Atkins comprised the finest supporting cast one could possibly hope for. And the play's original Allan Strang - Peter Firth - and Broadway's Tony- winning Dr. Martin Dysart - Richard Burton (also Oscar-nominated) - were simply magnificent.

My reservations had strictly to do with certain cinematic choices which the very talented and versatile Mr. Lumet made in adapting Shaffer's electrifying play to another medium. For, as originally staged, 'Equus' approached Greek tragedy in its highly stylized and expressionistic staging with the horses played unforgettably by actors clad in dark brown ""track-suits"" and wearing both steel-and-leather horse-masks - like glittering, skeletal sculptures - and iron-and-steel ""hooves"" which gave them intimidating height and an unearthly, graceful, godlike ominousness.

Yet, in the film version, the horses are merely...well, horses. And beautiful as they are, and though often stunningly photographed, we still see those sweet, expressive, long-lashed eyes which are hideously put out in the film's blood-drenched climax - a scene which was paradoxically more powerful onstage for being stylized, balletic, and completely bloodless, with the boy MIMING the blinding of the unfortunate animals which in his tortured mind he sees as vengeful, accusing deities. And this approach was also quite sensibly used in the recent Broadway revival starring Daniel Radcliffe and Richard Griffiths. And what was psychologically and emotionally shattering on the stage became gruesome and all but unwatchable in the film.

And yet a valid case can also be made for unflinchingly showing Alan's horrific crime for exactly what it is, with no punches (or, in this case, stabs) pulled. But be forewarned.

I also found myself wishing the film had been made in black and white and wondering what David Lynch might have done with it, employing the same cinematic vocabulary he employed in his amazing film of 'The Elephant Man'.

But all this is idle speculation, for Lumet's film is what it is and contains many wonderful cinematic flourishes of its own, including some infrequent though welcome moments of stylization, and a number of bravura set-pieces. The most memorable of these is Alan's ritualistic, naked midnight ride, shot in one long exhilarating take, which achieves both the requisite mythic power and a raw erotic intensity which not only equals but in some ways surpasses the equivalent sequence in the play. Other standout moments have as much to do with Richard Burton's towering and eloquent performance - fully the equal of Anthony Hopkins' virtuoso stage portrayal - as they do with Lumet's direction. And the sheer poetry of that wonderful Welsh vocal instrument - again, at the very least, the equal of fellow Welshman Hopkins - was music to my ears. But what stays with me most are the extraordinary moments when Burton's Dysart simply stares out with infinite sadness, loss, disillusionment and profound longing at the world he has somehow settled for. This is quite simply one of Burton's finest film performances, on a level with 'Who's Afraid Of Virginia Woolf?' and '1984'.

So, on balance, and with my several reservations aside, this is an excellent, beautifully acted film of a thrilling, riveting play and that is reason enough to seek it out. And, last but certainly not least, Richard Rodney Bennett's all-strings score is simply sublime.",1376092800,3,3798,5.3624161073825505

388385,4,6301966449,"I borrowed this movie from a library, and apart from the description on the case, I knew nothing about it.

Well, the scenes of pagan bestiality were disturbing enough. The scene where Strang blinded those horses, well, I couldn't look at it. I intensely dislike seeing animals harmed for any reason other than food or self-defense. For much of the movie, I sat there invoking curses upon what I interpreted as a betrayal of my expectations.

But then, Dr. Dysart (brilliantly portrayed by Richard Burton) shared his revelation about his patient. He understood that, as lost and in pain as the boy Strang was, as deviant as his behavior was, as horrible and unspeakable as his crime was, there was, under it, a finger pointing at the dull mediocrity that the rest of us live in. Most people sleepwalk through their lives. No passion, no joy, no pain, no purpose. These agonies and ecstasies are essential to the fullness of a human life. Yet, Strang was a product of a society that could not provide even a passable facimilie of these human feelings. Thus, the law of conservation of energy being equally applicable to psychology, that energy had to go somewhere. For Strang, he fabricated a false idol to which he attached sexual imagery - yet another energy he was ill equipped to channel. This disingenuous idolatry was the only passion in his life, and he took it as far as it could go.

Dysart was then forced to face his own ugly truth. That of an utterly empty life. Strang's mocking looks told him, when Dysart could finally understand, that while Dysart was comfortably trapped in a mediocre world wherein he would look at drawings of centaurs in dusty, clinically devised books, Strang was running wild in the night trying to become one.

It was when I realized this that I understood that the unforgivable attacks on the innocent horses was, on the one hand, incidental. On the other hand, it was the inevitable result of the boy's headlong dive into his passion. His incapacity to resolve the paradox he was forced into by circumstance combined with temperament and inclination. He was a moth that fell in love with the flame, and was consumed by it.

This is the difference between the millions of boxing fans who sit in front of the TV drinking beer and watching the title fight, and those few who go out into the ring and get beaten to a pulp in a real fight. This is the difference between those who attend the occasional religious service on holidays or whenever, and those who immerse themselves in their spiritual practice irregardless of the cost. They have a real love, a real passion, and no matter what, they are living a real life; while most simply exist as automatons without minds, without hearts, without spirit.

This, I believe, is what ""Equus"" is saying.",1257033600,7,2785,4.708418891170431

The good doctor questions the ethics of curing one with such ""true passion"".

There is some interesting study of sexuality in relationship to 'religion', although other than acknowleging that it can cause repression, odd behaviour (the boy) and hypocracy (the father), I'm not sure any new ground was broken or that this movie said anything that made it worth sitting through all the other BS (see paragraph above).

Although the theatrical version is matchless, this film adaptation succeeds in bringing into the widescreen the painful drama of these two characters who represent - in many aspects - the torments of modern society. Brilliantly interpreted by Burton & Firth, this is a theatrical adaptation not to be missed. Due to the brutal explicity of some sequences, it sounds understandable that a good number of viewers may feel shocked and tend to underrate the whole piece. I think this play - although written in 1973 - has a lot to say about us, about modern society, sexuality, religion and existential values.

388390,4,6301966449,"A young man (Alan Strang played by Peter Firth) blinds a half dozen horses with a spike and sings as his response to queries when hauled in front of the magistrate.  He must be nuts, the thinking goes, and suitable mental health is sought.

Richard Burton's character, Dr. Martin Dysart, doesn't just try to help his severely neutrotic and psychotic patients, he often leads them in a dysfunctional romp through the nethermind and disregards ordinary boundaries.

""Why me?"" Dysart asks the referring professional when requested to involve himself with this particularly difficult, horse-maiming patient.  She's already told him once, but he wants to hear it again, maybe in a new way.  The answer is naturally because he's the best.  He doesn't argue.

And so Dr. Dysart sluthes his way through the mind of young Alan, through his broken Stepford mum and embarrassed, muttering dad, and through the evidences of a life that not only has taken the road less travelled, but has gone crashing through the underbrush of a dark, sharp wood where no one else goes.

When Alan awakens from a nightmare to see Dysart standing above him, he wasn't the only one who wondered, WTF?  In fact, Dysart's apparent conversion from general shrink to field forensic psychiatrist who just happens to be everywhere he needs to be was just a little odd.  His obsession with the Strang case, however, became understandable.

Firth was excellent in this, the best part actually.  I was afraid after the introduction that Burton's Dysart would be overwrought, but he settled into it well enough with occasional relapses into overacting.  The complex repressed sexual themes were interesting and this film will probably appeal to fans of Burton and people interested in well-written tales of the mentally ill.  I also appreciated the connection between Dysart's persistent and disturbing dreams in light of the work he did.  I enjoyed this film, although it was a bit ponderous at times with Dysart's later various prolonged existential crises.",1206057600,,2019,5.075757575757576
388391,1,6301966449,"This film encapsulatates most of what was wrong with the culture of the 1970s. An insane boy mutiliates a bunch of animals. Burton (a psychiatrist) sets out to ""help"" the boy (somehow) by probing the boy's insane view of the world.

Then we get to the typical 1970s crisis of conscience. We are essentially told through Burton's character that trying to cure an insane person who multilates horses is wrong. That in trying to cure him, his ""uniqueness"" as an individual (his insane view of the world) will be destroyed. All that was missing at the end was a call for a government program to maintain, protect and develop this unique boy along with his community of horses.

The film is a badly written mix of shock horror and the idiotic social ideas of the 1970s. I watched it because of all the critical acclaim that was showered on it. Its difficult to comprehend how this was nominated for acadamy awards, but it was. Its only value is in showing how artistically messed up that era was.",1205452800,15,991,4.593220338983051
388392,4,6301966449,"Equus (Sidney Lumet, 1977)

I have to admit that at first, I was kind of unimpressed with Equus. Richard Burton narrating the first dream bit... it just didn't work. It seemed overdone, the symbolism was way too naked, this just wasn't Peter Shaffer. No subtlety. No tact. For that matter, come to think of it, this wasn't Sidney Lumet, either. It was about ten minutes later, during the bit where Alan Strang (Peter Firth) is relaying his first experience with a horse, that the movie really fell into place. I think that has a great deal to do with Firth and not nearly as much to do with Burton, though he does grow into his role as the movie progresses. Firth, on the other hand, gives a powerful, terrifying performance from the get-go here. His mentally disturbed Strang is a perfect fit for Shaffer's celebrated meditation on the potential damage of the mixture of sex and religion. And while Equus, thanks in no small part to its slow, unworkable beginning, never quite reaches the heights of Dog Day Afternoon or Twelve Angry Men, but it remains a powerful and disturbing film, once it takes off. And take off it does.

The cast entire do a very good job here. Joan Plowright is almost as distressing as Firth, despite being supposedly sane, while Colin Blakely plays her blustering, ineffectual husband excellently. Jenny Agutter (once again fulfilling her role as, in the immortal words of Jeff Murdock, ""an advertisement for nudity!"") makes a perfect love interest for Strang, teasing and coy, but willing to take the upper hand when necessary, while Burton, once he warms to the role, makes a fine psychotherapist. But what sets this apart is Lumet's interesting decision to keep Alan Strang at the same age in his flashbacks, rather than taking the more conventional choice of casting six-year-old and twelve-year-old actors to play earlier versions of the sixteen-year-old Strang; the scene I mentioned earlier, where Strang recounts his first experience with a horse, is just monumental. While it probably would be had they cast another character, by keeping Firth, the scene also gains an unsettling quality of imbalance; you know he's supposed to be six, but there he is, still his adult self. Amazing stuff.

The subject matter, in today's political climate in both Britain and America, is probably deeply unpopular; if anything, that's even more a reason to get your hands on a copy of this at your earliest convenience and indulge yourself. ****",1184025600,2,2466,4.908872901678657

This felt like a stage play adaptation.  There are lots of long speaking bits and very few settings.  I'm not against adapted stage plays, but this didn't feel like a movie, and it's strong points made me more curious about seeing it as a play than anything else.

Equus unfolds from a therapist asked to analyze and work with a teenage boy who had a seemingly normal life, who suddenly and for no apparent reason gouged out the eyes of several horses at a stable where he worked part time.  The therapist, meanwhile narrates about his dreams and oddities, and finds in the teen parrallels to himself.  The movie is as much about the therapist as about the teen.

Something that for me was weak about this movie is that it seemed to be trying way too hard to be sexual.  The teen is naked in approaching half his scenes.  He rides horses naked.  He stands naked next to horses and pets them during some long narration.  He falls back completely naked into blackness in some type of visual methaphor over and over again during some long narration.  He gets naked in therapy, which I'm assuming is OK only because this is set in England, and therapy is run differently there.  Beyond the copious nudity, some of the language is, once again, over the top.  In a flashback showing his quirks preceeding the blinding, he's whipping himself (probably naked here too) and screaming some type of geneology for Equus (his personal god).  This geneology is a bit over the top as most of it reads like ""Pankus begat Spankus...  Spankus begat Equus.""  Seriously, ""Spankus"" is in there.

I recommend avoiding this movie, although maybe be open to it as a play.  Turning it into a film certainly didn't add anything, and altough this has some good acting, it seems at best as if it's trying to hard.",1181692800,4,1961,4.6395348837209305

388408,4,6301966449,"Equus offers a gripping view into the mind of a disturbed and at times psychotic teenage boy - and into the psyche of his conflicted therapist.  Although the movie is well worth watching, I only gave it four stars because of several of its flaws.

My main criticism is that the movie strayed into idealization of the therapist and the therapy.  Yes, the therapist (played brilliantly by Richard Burton) was passionate, earnest, committed, and struggling to be honest both with himself and the boy, and yes, the movie partially succeeds at highlighting the therapist's vulnerability, hypocrisy, and stuckness, but at times he violated the boy in ways the movie not only didn't address, but even presented as being therapeutically necessary.

For starters, Equus minimized the therapist's sporadically combative - and thus untherapeutic - behavior.  At points he rejected the already abused and frightened boy (threw him out of the office for not behaving ""properly""), manipulated him (hypnotized him on the sly - as if the boy, desperate for love, could refuse!), tricked him (gave him a false ""truth drug"" - with false promises of a cure - to make him talk), and even brutalized him (screamed at him and bullied him to force him into revealing the horrors of his past for the sake of ""healing"").  Although this made for good drama it utterly fails to show, much less even hint at, how a slow and gentle and safe therapeutic approach could have so much more effectively helped the boy discover and integrate his true self.  Forget all the trickery and rage and pressure to make the boy ""normal"" - which only repeat the horrors perpetrated on him by his troubled parents - just honor him and honor his natural healing process.

My experience has shown me that the greatest results are achieved with no therapeutic violation of the patient.  Although the ""blast your way to healing"" approach plays to the public's idea of an actively engaged, virtuoso therapist who stops at nothing to ""save the patient,"" it disguises (much more than the movie addressed) a therapist's grandiosity, insecurity, hidden agenda, impatience, and split-off self-hatred - and risks terrible consequences for the patient.  Had the boy killed himself during or after the therapy - a likelihood which struck me several times in the film - I would have partially blamed the therapist.

I was not surprised that after the boy finally admitted to blinding the horses, and admitted his back story that drove him to do it, he had a complete breakdown and went into catatonic shock - and ""needed"" to be drugged.  And this is considered good therapy, even healing?  Hardly.  For starters, it's based on the fanciful idea that simply getting someone to admit what happened to them, by hook or by crook, is enough to catalyze healing.  If only that were the case!  This is where the psychological detective story element of the movie took precedence over a real chance to demonstrate good therapy.

And then there is the nudity.  A little might have been relevant, but it was gratuitous to repeatedly show the teenage boy's fully naked body in the film - much less to show overt sex between him and the girl who participated in driving him over the edge.  But perhaps the biggest violation was that the psychiatrist's manipulations got the boy to undress to full nudity right in a therapy session!  Talk about malpractice!

Although they initially presented this therapist as being the best there is (the only therapist ""within a hundred miles"" who could help the boy), I could only hope this wasn't the case.

388413,4,6301966449,"There are two things I really love about the film version of EQUUS.  (I haven't seen it onstage but I have read the play).

I'm a big fan of Richard Burton when he's ""there"" for a role.

What I mean by that is that Burton sometimes took roles that were so far beneath him for either money or something to do, like THE EXORCIST II or too many others.

But EQUUS, like BECKET and WHO'S AFRAID OF VIRGINIA WOOLF?, really taps into the pain and rage and helplessness that Burton allows to seethe to the surface.

Another great performance from him.

The second thing I like is the idea behind the story: I see EQUUS as a young man trying to find God--something to believe in--with a father who denies him that freedom.  When the brusque father abruptly rips his son's painting of Jesus down, the son is made to feel that his spiritual side is weak and unacceptable.  Then he replaces God with his private horse god Equus.

Burton's beaten, bankrupt doctor recognizes the passion of the boy...and sees the emptiness of his own ""beliefs.""

""His stare says, 'At least I galloped, when did you?'"" Burton rages to a colleague.

As I see so many American children left to their own devices, the flood of MTV and the Internet and sewer entertainment and the indifference of their parents (how many boys are there out there with that strange Hitler fixation?), I see the conflict of EQUUS playing out every day all over this country.

As the film moves along, the intriguing answer begins to unfold.

The boy is sent to a hospital where he is under the care of psychiatrist Martin Dysart (Richard Burton.) In treating the boy, Dysart begins to confront his own inner struggles, which are almost as, if not more, fascinating than the boy's. He wrestles with questions of how to live well and passionately and whether a sense of awe and connectedness are possible in the world. Is he (Dysart) a healer or a hack?

Whether you agree with Dysart's conclusions (playwright Peter Shaffer's conclusions?) or not, the film raises the questions very well--questions that are relevant and engaging to anyone.

Lumet transfers the stage play beautifully to the screen, exploring an interesting case of a boy who has blinded six horses.  Richard Burton is magnificent and one of the only actors that can carry on long-winded dialogues with conviction.  Equally able is the deranged boy (played by Peter Firth) who cross-examines Burton, knocking him off his feet in a similar manner to Matt Damon in ""Good Will Hunting.""
""Equus"" explores what it means to be normal.  Burton's character realizes that being normal, to a certain degree, is having abnormalities.  Peter Firth's character has a worship that is more passionate and alive than most human beings ever feel-certainly more than Burton's character.  Burton longs to have the boy's passion and yet realizes that he is trying to free the boy from these feelings as he is doing so.  He muses over the meaning of his life and the therapy he gives.  If he can never understand ""why"" a child acts the way it does, is there any point to therapy?
While this movie starts out with a completely absurd and twisted plot, it eventually fades into a very believable plot line.  As Burton pulls the information from Firth's head and we witness the boy's instable home life and threatening religious background, the plot becomes normal and we come to understand the boy's situation.  The movie becomes clear as the boy's troubles become clear.  The effect of this is that we experience the therapy along with Peter Firth.  This is masterfully done and Lumet should be applauded.

It's curious because Sidney Lumet had a winning screen track record and Burton had honed his role as Dysart on the NY stage, after taking over the role from Tony Perkins. But something is sadly amiss here.
Some of the problems are the dank, sterile way in which many scenes were filmed. The viewer almost becomes claustrophic when Dysart interogates and analyzes the boy, ably played by Peter Firth. The sets seem absurdly cheap for such a production, with sofas, chairs and walls reminscent of something out of ""General Hospital."" The stable scene where Firth blinds the horses takes the concept of gratuitous violence to a new level. Again, this scene worked beautifuly on stage, but is numbing and troubling when viewed in the movie version.
Burton's performance was widely praised at the time of release and he was nominated for his seventh Academy Award. He didn't win (Richard Dreyfuss won instead).

Something, however, went horribly wrong in translating the play to the screen. Nothing seems to work. For example, the blinding of the horses in the stage production is totally believable and so overpowering. Using men wearing metal horses' heads works completely. The similar scenes in the movie with actual horses are so brutal as to be almost unwatchable. The nudity is not at all gratuituous in the play but seems unnecessary in the movie adaptation. The spare set complements the acting in the play and is so effective. That is all of course lost in the movie version. Martin Dysart's talking to the audience is so moving in the play; in the movie it comes off simply as both artificial and boring.

On the tacky end of the scale are DAVID AND LISA and FINAL ANALYSIS; on the ""deeply moving"" end of the scale are ORDINARY PEOPLE and GOOD WILL HUNTING. Most, like THE THREE FACES OF EVE fall somewhere in the middle--interesting though unsubtle stories that reduce the patient's neurosis to a single mystery that needs to be unlocked by an indefatiguable professional who is egoless and has the blank personality to prove it.
Sidney Lumet's adaptation of the Peter Shaffer's stage play EQUUS is exceptional for its ability to transport to film the full emotional complexity and intensity of a psychiatrist's relationship with one of his patients. And this is done almost entirely through the skill of the actors: Richard Burton as the psychiatrist Dr. Martin Dysart, Peter Firth as the disturbed stable boy who inexplicably blinded several of the horses in his care, Colin Blakely and Joan Plowright as the boy's religiously incompatible parents, and Eileen Atkins as a judge who has asked Dr. Dysart to take on this challenging case. This is not to minimize other contributions--the cinematography is exceedingly intelligent and unobtrusive. It's simply to say that Lumet seems to have realized that he had assembled a dream cast and made every effort to stay out of their way and to let each actor shine. Burton's performance is perhaps the best of his film career. Though intense at times, he is completely devoid of the stagey ""haminess"" that has marred some of his other film performances. Firth, as the patient, moves easily from jingle-singing dissociated boy, to surly rebellious youth, to a sort of highly eroticized mythic being. It is truly fascinating to watch. Because the psychiatrist has issues of his own, and because the story is as much about his coming to terms with his own demons as with those of his patient, EQUUS is not your typical Hollywood psychotherapy movie.

This movie is  definately worth buying - because it deservs repeated viewings. It's a pity  the character of Alan (Peter Firth) isn't better portrayed: he's just by  far too stagey and deliberate. Buy it for the writing, buy it for Burton,  but know it's flawed.",964569600,4,1068,4.994318181818182
388511,4,6301966449,"A flawlessly-written script with mythical undertones presented with brilliant performances -yet this is a very disturbing story for horse lovers such as myself. However, its passionate flow and the beauty of  language and landscape keep one fixed to the screen.  I would have liked to  see the stage version, however I did not.  But the outdoor scenes in this  movie were stunning - and I would not have gotten that from a stage  performance.  This movie is high art.",949795200,9,467,4.8354430379746836

7818083,4,6301966449,"Equus is very well-acted, well-directed, and well-written. I feel as though I should be rating it higher. But it is also a very British film and very much a product of its time. Equus conveys a very strong sense of pessimism, desperation, anguish. So while I'd say it is a worthwhile film, it's also not the type of film I find enjoyable nor is it something I'd go about recommending to others. However, if you want to watch something less typical and more challenging then you could do worse than to put Equus in your queue.",1443571200,,525,4.479166666666667
