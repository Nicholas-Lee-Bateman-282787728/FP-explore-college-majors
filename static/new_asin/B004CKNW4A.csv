8423208,4,B004CKNW4A,"This 5 DVD set is outstanding in content.

You will be inspired by little known martyrs who were pre-Reformation and helped pave the way for the ""Reformation"" in Germany (via Luther) and Switzerland (via Calvin).

You will find out about martyrs and key figures who were part of the ""Reformation"" in Switzerland, England, and France.

Here is a sneak peek at the jewels of each DVD:

Volume 1 (Comes the Dawn of the Reformation): You will be inspired by the Waldeneses (in Italy), how they hid in caves and were persecuted for standing firm for Jesus and His Word.

Volume 2 (Story of the Bible): You will be inspired by other martyrs who loved the pure word of God, in addition to the famous Erasmus, John Hus, and bible translators Wycliffe and Tyndale.

Volume 3 (Champions of Freedom): You will be inspired by John Knox (the Scottish Reformer), and Ulrich Zwingli, the Swiss predecessor to John Calvin.

Volume 4 (Winds of Change): You will see how certain changes and events played out in Switzerland and England as society was transformed by the spreading flame of the Reformation.

Volume 5 (The Reformation Comes of Age): You will be inspired by the Huguenots in France, who spearheaded their own ""Reformation"". The French Huguenots were forced to be slaves on the galleys of ships, and prohibited from leaving France. You will be inspired by the Oxford martyrs, burned at the stake.

The 5 DVDs are a bit slow moving, but, the content is outstanding!",1360108800,6,1459,4.780876494023905
