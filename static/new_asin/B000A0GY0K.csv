2347260,4,B000A0GY0K,"I was very excited to come across Season 1 at my local Borders Books and Music. I was a late fan, having only seen a few episodes when it was released to syndication, then just as quickly yanked from the air waves. I could finally catch up on what I missed.

Having now seen the first three seasons I would say this is the best of the three (though we are not blessed with any episodes written by Paul Gross, this time out). The relationship, and frustrations, between Fraser and Vecchio can sometimes boarder on hilarious as they learn to adapt to each other. On the other extreme, such as the two part, end of the season

episodes: ""Victoria's Secret"", you  get to witness the tenderness Vecchio feels towards Fraser. His friendship and feelings of guilt help Fraser through one of the worst trials of his life and sets up the great opening episode of season 2. The secondary relationships between Fraser and his wolf, Diefenbaker, Vecchio's younger sister (who has a HUGE crush on Fraser), ""Huey & Duey"", Fraser and his ghost-father, Robert Fraser, just add to the greatness of this show (you may even grow to love Vecchio's car as much as he does!).

Like many, I was pleased with the cheapier US price, rather then the more expensive international version. However, my only complaint, like so many others, my DVD's do stall or skip from time to time. I have no problem with the transfer, keeping in mind it has been a decade since the show was last aired, and only on occasion do you catch the low quality. I have read the international versions have the same stalling/skipping/scratched DVD problems as these versions.

Don't let the manufacture mess ups stop you from buying these box sets though, the little hic-ups are no big deal in the larger scheme of things. I love having this great show in my DVD collection!",1128556800,9,1823,4.614197530864198
2347261,4,B000A0GY0K,The VHS tape masters were used for the Platinum DVDs. The budget minded buyer can go for the cheaply mastered U.S. DVDs.  But those wanting quality will go for the much higher priced Canadian DVDs from Alliance.  Those were mastered for DVD by the production masters.  You can save alot of money by ordering them directly from Amazon's Canadian Division (click on the Canadian button at the bottom of this page).,1127865600,17,412,4.774647887323944
2347262,4,B000A0GY0K,"Excellent release. Better than the canada release. Although the VHS transfers are used! This can be seen in the picture as at times lines fall down the screen and the occasional picture jump.

The packaging is cool, but the discs can arrived scratched due to shipping.

The episodes are still watchable and if you can look past the small problems in this Platnium release",1127433600,,371,4.78125
2347263,5,B000A0GY0K,"I am a huge Due South fan and, yes, I was suckered into getting seasons 1 and 2 of the $100+ versions available here on Amazon with all the awful packaging, etc. However, THIS is the version we were all waiting for...beautiful packaging, clear picture, plus the pilot!

If you haven't experienced Due South, you should. It's a wonderfully quirky show with just the right mix of humor and  drama, featuring great characters and dialogue. If you *have* seen the series, prepare to feel a great deal of nostalgia watching one of the greatest TV shows ever. I am proud to own my copies and am crossing my fingers that they give season 3 a green light for receiving the same treatment.",1126224000,6,680,4.565573770491803
2347264,5,B000A0GY0K,"Always loved this show (especially the first two seasons) but held off buying it on dvd till now, having read less than complimentary reviews of the versions released. Was amazed to see this item at such a price. A whole season, including the feature length pilot where it should be, single sided discs, with neat packaging. There are downsides, no extras or subtitles (perhaps they think everybody can lip read like Dief), and the picture/sound only seem slightly better than video at times, but at last I can throw out that crateful of videos and enjoy the World's Nicest Man, his frequently embarrassed new friend Vecchio, and the scene stealing wolf, to my heart's content.

Oh, and the music's great too; this series introduced me to Sarah McLachlan and Loreena McKennitt, for which, 'Thank you kindly'...",1125273600,13,810,4.955882352941177
2347265,5,B000A0GY0K,"This is an amazing deal - there are no extras, just a very basic menu with chapter selections, and very occasionally the picture quality is not so great, but to get the whole 24 episodes for this price is fantastic!

2347266,4,B000A0GY0K,"If you're a fan of the tv series and want only that, this is definitely the way to go.  All of season one and the pilot is included!  No fancy extras or animated menu screens, but who cares, you get DUE SOUTH ON DVD!!  You can select an episode and a scene within that episode, and that's about it.  My only complaint is that the visual and sound quality were lacking at times.  If you're a fan and really get into the shows you probably won't notice.  If the other seasons (when they're released) are of the same quality, I'll be happy.",1124236800,12,537,4.215686274509804

2347298,4,B000A0GY0K,"I missed this series when it was on network TV; but I vaguely remembered watching one episode, and it struck as being fairly goofy.  After watching most of the episodes on the first disc, I was surprised to see it called a comedy.  I admit it is funny at points, but it does deal with some fairly serious moral issues, and in a refreshing turn of events, evil doesn't always win or succeed.

2347306,5,B000A0GY0K,I loved Due South when it was on CBS in the 90's. I was apprehensive purchasing it because you know how you remember a show and see it again years later.

2347314,5,B000A0GY0K,"You know, Geminis, those awards for Canadian tv and movies? This show has over a dozen between production and acting. Real talk.

You have to get into this show knowing that 1) it was filmed in the 90s and the video quality will reflect this and 2) you will need to be able to switch from enjoying bizarre quirky conversations between a dedicated Mountie and his deaf half-wolf sidekick to enjoying painful heart-wrenching conversations between an emotionally neglected son and his dead father. This is not a normal crime procedural.

Paul Haggis (also involved in Black Donnellys, Crash, Casino Royale, Quantum of Solace, weird range, right?) created and wrote for this show and it. Is. Different. There is your usual whodunit and gunfire and gumshoeing, but the gumshoeing often involves a Mountie actually licking gum on a shoe, for information gathering purposes, followed by his American partner being disgusted by this behavior, followed by married-couple-esque bickering about the Mountie's ingestion of germs, you know what? Just watch it. Describing it to any decent degree takes longer than watching an episode or two.",1370217600,,1128,5.1923076923076925
2347315,3,B000A0GY0K,"This is difficult to assign a single rating to.  Due South is a VERY enjoyable series, but it is marred by the disappointing quality of the video on these disks.  As several other reviewers noted, the producer of these disks tried to ""save a buck"" by cramming too many episodes onto each disk (and not from a master source) - and the quality of the episodes is noticeably sub-standard as a result.  What a shame for such an enjoyable series that, were it not for the disappointing video quality, I would have rated a 4.  Further, were it not for the lack of closed captioning on all of the disks/episodes, my rating would have risen to a 4 1/2 (sorry, I virtually NEVER assign the absolute top rating to anything - but that's just me).  Compounding my disappointment is the fact that reviewers have been reporting this for MONTHS! (years actually), so I was anticipating some/all of the reported disappointments to have been resolved by now (does the seller not read these?).  Personally, I would have preferred to pay a bit more and get higher quality video and closed captioning.

In the end, my headline sums it up - I enjoyed the episodes' content, but found the lack of production quality irritating.  I MIGHT repeat the purchase (if unable to find a higher quality example), but would certainly NOT if a higher quality example was available - even at a higher price.",1368403200,5,1372,4.640495867768595

2347330,5,B000A0GY0K,"There are a couple of episodes that are lame, but not many. The gem is the Victoria's Secret episodes. The acting is superb in this particular episode and the plot is fascinating. Victoria is as bad as Fraser is good but you just love her and know they should be together. You are shocked to find out that she is the one who shot Deaf! Things get distressing for detective Vecchio as well and omg his father's ghost appears which is something that only happens to Fraser.  The sound tracks by Sarah McLachian are brilliant. The show probably could have thrived on more episodes with Victoria, but they left perfection alone.",1324771200,,624,4.621621621621622
2347331,5,B000A0GY0K,"This is hands down my favorite series ever! Benton Frazier is such a wonderfully delightful character. He is so multi talented, dependable, honorable, and on and on. If I were ever in a bad spot, I'd want some one like him to have my back. The relationship between Benton and Ray is inspiring. And then we have the show itself. Great story lines, the writers were all top notch. The only bad thing about this show was it was cancelled way too soon. It was too good a show to go off the air that soon. It was a crime! I was so happy Amazon had all the seasons so my husband and I can watch them whenever we like.",1319500800,,611,4.1
2347332,5,B000A0GY0K,"This was one of my favorite TV shows in the mid-90s. Before I bought my DVD sets, I could still remember my favorite episodes, it was that memorable. Most of the best episodes are from the first season. It was new and fresh and the writing was excellent. You really felt the 'heart' of the show. The second season, the first few episodes were on par with the first season, ""North"" and ""Mask"" are two of my favorites, but somewhere in the middle, it started to feel different. I have both seasons on DVD (I'm a fan of the 'original' Ray and have only seen a few episodes of the later season) and still have periodic weekend Due South marathons. I had forgotten all the great music they played as well. Great show! Also in this date and time it's comical to see the fashions of the day (I forgot how cell phones were bricks!). The show has really stood the test of time. I also was a fan of ""Northern Exposure"" back then and have one season on DVD and have only watched it once, meanwhile I could watch ""Due South"" once a month, it beats most programming on TV right now.",1315267200,,1069,4.270935960591133
2347333,3,B000A0GY0K,"The product shipped on time.

The best episode is the first one. It is sad that after several episodes one can tell when they ""Hollywood-ized"" the script.

The aspects that made it a special show were the fact that it was Canadian, and different from the regular Hollywood fodder on nightly television.",1265587200,,302,4.788461538461538
2347334,5,B000A0GY0K,"There are many complaints about the picture quality of this set. Sure...If you view the US and Canadian versions,the Canadian version has a slighty better picture and yes Platinum Disc did pack a lot of content on each disc. Six episodes per disc. This would be a draw back if this set were EXPENSIVE but its not.
I mean lets face it for the price ... DVD set is a BARGAIN!
But no one mentions the AUDIO of these two versions. The Canadian version is in 2.0 Stereo.
I guess this is the standard in these older dvd sets. Remastered in 2.0 and sounds OK.
The US version has a remastered 5.0 STEREO soundtrack and in my opinion,it sounds great.
DUE SOUTH has one of the best soundtracks of any TV show at the time. Each episode featured great Canadian artists. Most memorable are Jay Semkos opening theme and guitar driven score,Sarah McLachlan's Possesion and Fumbling towards ecstasy,Guess Who's American woman,Loreena McKennitt Prospero's speech just to name a few. So along with the acting and writing,the music played a big part of this show appeal.

 In the second season of DUE SOUTH the CANADIAN artists featured were Jeff Healey, ""See the Light"",Klaatu ""CALLING OCCUPANTS OF INTERPLANETARY CRAFT""  and Tom Cochrane, ""Ragged Ass Road"" and more.

Due south was one of those shows that had great potential,a lot of fans and no support from the CBS.",1249776000,,7811,4.961290322580645
2347335,5,B000A0GY0K,"My family loves this show-- something for everyone.  My husband likes the police procedural/cop show aspects, and my daughter and I are suckers for a pretty face (Paul Gross).  Plus there's a dog (he's supposed to be a wolf). The character of Benton Frasier is a grown up boy scout, a true gentleman who never disappoints.  He's a mountie in America, the kind of guy who would endure tremendous hardships to do his job, and still give up his seat if there was a woman anywhere on the bus. What's not to like?

The reason my wife and I picked up on it recently was because of star Paul Gross's more recent comedy, Slings and Arrrows (a work of genius, BTW, in the league of Ricky Gervais's The Office). Due South is funny, action-packed, full of delightful characters (including a deaf wolf named after a former Canadian PM), and not a little bittersweet. As suspense-mysteries go, the shows aren't bad either. One caveat, though: By jamming 6 hour-format episodes on each disk, the manufacturer has degraded the visual quality. During any action sequence there's terrible pixilation and breakup. So long as the actors aren't moving very much, it looks OK. We're willing to put up with the visual issues because we've become quite fond of the show.",1225411200,,854,4.9375
2347355,3,B000A0GY0K,"In the 1970s, American audiences accepted, in the spirit of good natured fun, the Canadian group Guess Who's schlock hit ""American Woman,"" even though it was highly derivative (a sort of Led Zeppelin lite), silly and full of insecure Canadian ""we are so very different from Americans"" cultural jingoism.  The same sort of approach - acceptance as good natured fun - is needed to enjoy Due South, a Canadian produced, ""set in Chicago"" formulaic buddy-cop series that veers wildly (sometimes in a single episode) from genuinely cool and slick pop entertainment to amazingly dumb and inconsistent writing, story line and production values.  The main character Benton Fraser (Paul Gross) is a stiff, cartoon-like, morally pristine Canadian Mountie who can leap in front of high speed vehicles, confront a bar full of seedy and heavily armed underworld characters or jump/tumble from great heights without any sign of fear or hesitancy and, more importantly, without wrinkling his crisp Mountie uniform.  All this is done while we learn that Benton can also speak Chinese, communicate almost intuitively with his deaf, lip-reading pet wolf and determine where a clod of Chicago-area mud came from simply by sniffing or tasting it (no kidding).  Benton's sidekick (or co-main character) is Ray Vecchio (David Marciano), a harried Chicago detective whose cheesy exterior and gruff mannerisms barely conceal his reluctant sincerity and heart of gold.  Together, these two unlikely buddies (a modern day, whimsical Holmes and worldly Watson duo) finesse, stumble and plod their way through a series of mysteries and adventures - from solving the mystery of how contaminated meat is entering Chicago-area grocery stores to thwarting vicious murderers and kidnappers.  Accepted for what it is - good, clean fun with a tongue-in-cheek attitude - it is easy to overlook the deficiencies and inconsistencies in this series and, instead, focus on its merits as middle-of-the-road, albeit sometimes lightweight and amateurish, entertainment. On a more cynical note, the series is certainly worth the 20 to 30 dollar price per season - even if you just use it as video ""background noise"" or ""filler"" for other activities, such as housecleaning, reading the paper or vegging out with not-too-stimulating or challenging tv fare after a hard day at work.  I don't think Due South will ever be considered among the classic achievements of television, but it is worth viewing.  And, oh yeah,  American audiences will have to sit through the obligatory Canadian reference to the War of 1812 and yet another ""meaningful"" reprise of ""American Woman"" in the soundtrack to the series.",1210377600,2,2657,5.277251184834123

But this quirky series not only provided a cop show with interesting plot lines, it fed us characters that were likable and wonderful to watch interacting.  Fraser, the RCMP Mounty, is an invariably polite, unfailingly non-violent (to the extent possible) liason to the Chicago police department's wise-cracking bad attitude italian cop Ray.  What makes it truly intriguing is that most of the time, Ray gets himself into difficulty with his bad attitude and matching verbal banter, while Fraser's open, friendly politeness succeeds in getting the desired results.  A really good family show that teaches younger members of the family (for example, our ten-year-old grandson) the benefits of being nice and polite instead of violent and angry.  Fraser's deaf but lip-reading dog, Diefenbaker, gives you some idea of how seriously the show takes itself.  I enjoyed every minute.",1206576000,2,1007,5.2625

2347360,5,B000A0GY0K,"Paul Haggis has had some great successes in film (CRASH, MILLION DOLLAR BABY, LETTERS FROM IWO JIMA) and in television (WALKER, TEXAS RANGER, THIRTYSOMETHING). But it's DUE SOUTH for which I thank him the most. Whenever I watch a DUE SOUTH episode, I always somehow end up shaking my head. This was such a great and fun show, and it deserved more longevity. But, it wasn't meant to be, thanks to CBS, which, after every season of DUE SOUTH, persisted in pulling the plug (only to have the show resurrect itself each time, at least until the 4th and final season). But at least we get a consolation prize in this DUE SOUTH: SEASON ONE 4-disc dvd set. From which, by the way, a star or two should be lopped off for not inserting ANY special features. But, never mind, I'm just glad the dvds are out.

The Canadian-made DUE SOUTH started out as a made-for-TV film. It received such a warm response that it prompted CBS to pick it up for a primetime slot. And, really, what's not to like? With its prescription of whimsy, warmth, and gentle humor, this was a series which generously gave back to its viewers. Even if you do start halfway suspecting that Canadians just might be superior to Yanks. Anyway, the show excelled at gently poking fun at both American and Canadian stereotypes.

It's a great fish-out-of-water premise. A guileless, by-the-book Mountie plying his trade in jaded, crooked Chicago. Compulsively helpful, RCMP Constable Benton Fraser (Paul Gross) initially befuddles those around him as folks have trouble believing he is for real. Fraser is the only Chicagoan resident to not have locks on his door. He's an everlasting irritant (but at times a positive influence) to his cop buddy Detective Ray Vecchio (David Marciano), who himself is obnoxious, street savvy, and resembles a skinny rat in garish shirts. In the pilot episode, the two of them meet and strike up an unlikely friendship. And even though Fraser is assigned to the Canadian consulate - and thus has no official capacity to solve Chicago PD crimes - he proves invaluable to Detective Vecchio.

Himself the son of a legendary Mountie, Constable Fraser lives up to the stereotype held up to the Royal Canadian Mounted Police. And then some. He is truthful, brave, trustworthy, and unfailingly courteous. He also is very literal-minded, which sparks some of the show's humor (although there's a sneaking feeling that he's not as naive as he seems). The Constable also has acute powers of observation and exceptionally attuned senses. In one episode, he decodes a computer password simply by recalling the typing sounds made by someone's fingers. His ability to smell and hear, as well as his habit of tasting (and identifying) objects picked up off the ground (to Vecchio's constant dismay), often breaks a case wide open. That he's oblivious to being a chick magnet is also a source of nettlement for Vecchio, as is Fraser's narrating of arcane trivia and of moralistic Inuit tales. Too, Fraser has a tendency of guilting Vecchio into doing the right thing. But Vecchio gets Fraser back by making turns without employing the turn signal. Occasionally, he'd run a stop sign, which drives Fraser crazy (""That was a stop sign, Ray.""). Do I have to mention that these two actors have very good chemistry?

This is a such a well-written show, full of insightful wit, quirky humor, and quiet, poignant drama. And the soundtrack is great. One of the show's odder beats has Fraser's dead father appearing and having talks with his son. One episode even has Fraser's dead grandmother scolding his dead father, except that Fraser can only see and hear his dad, not the nana. But, whatever, it was all too metaphysical for me. An added allure to DUE SOUTH is that you never quite know where an episode is heading. Fraser's frequent forays into good samaritanship often leads him and Vecchio into the most offbeat of cases. Fraser's efforts to help a little girl unveils an insurance scam. A small time investigation into bad supermarket meat escalates into a high stakes horse-stealing racket. Fraser's gentle reprimand of an illegally parked man leads to a cache of stolen weaponry. And so on.

The cast is across the board excellent. Naturally, Paul Gross carries much of the load, and he's perfect. There just may be a hint of smugness in Gross's Benton Fraser, but he's such a great straight-arrow character that it's hard to not like the guy. He simply exudes sincerity and a wholesome charm, and his deadpan delivery is pitch perfect. He's a very good actor, who makes do here with a minimal yet very revealing use of expressions. His acting is never better displayed than in ""The Wild Bunch"" and the 2-part ""Victoria's Secret."" Plus, he irons his boots, which must be worth a few extra points.

David Marciano perfectly complements Gross as his wonderfully irascible but loyal partner and best friend. Marciano is particularly fantastic in the episodes ""You Must Remember This"" (in which he falls in love) and ""The Deal"" (in which he confronts a Chicago mobster). And then there's the soulful dog Diefenbaker. For the uninitiated, Diefenbaker is an intelligent, willful deaf wolf who reads lips and who had adopted Fraser back in the wilds. And he is a joy to watch, scene-stealer that he is. Several episodes give this dog ample time to shine, but especially ""The Wild Bunch."" Fraser, Vecchio, and Diefenbaker are the core of the series, and their interactions truly are what fuels the show.

DUE SOUTH has a way of presenting one with life lessons, but does it in entertaining fashion. If you pay attention, you may also pick some little known facts. One thing I learned is that the Canadian Mountie's motto isn't really ""We always get our man"" (it's actually ""Uphold the law""). Which Constable Fraser does, and well. He may be a man out of his element and maybe out of his era. But he seems to be doing fine, maybe even more than fine. DUE SOUTH was one of the best shows out there in the mid-'90s, and we really should've been treated to more episodes. But it's nice to have the good Constable on dvd, anyway, in this exceptional first season. So to DUE SOUTH and its makers, I say, ""Thank you kindly.""",1188777600,2,6183,4.794559099437148

Being a big fan of Due South, and after reading some reviews saying that the picture quality on these DVD's wasn't so great, I was a bit reluctant in purchasing the series (especially I was going to get them shipped to Australia, and I've had some bad experiences in the past with shocking quality recordings).  However I thought why not, brought the 3 series, and I am very happy with my purchase.

I couldn't see any noticeable problems, although occasionally the pictures weren't always that sharp - I would like to point out that I don't have a HD TV, however I'm not sure if that would make a difference at all.  The main problems I found were the scenes taken in the snow were a bit washed out.

2347393,5,B000A0GY0K,"My wife and I first saw this series while living in the remote wilds of Alaska. It was on CBS and was a great hit for us! We enjoyed the Canadian humor as well as the great lines. We missed most of the series as the program went off and on again.

It seems that this show died twice and revived both times.

Now, with the DVDs we were able to watch the entire series. I would say it is well worth the expense. I bought the entire series for about $55.00 (including shipping to Alaska). The quality of the DVDs are sometimes not the best. As mentioned by other posts, there is some grainy and digital interference during some fast action scenes. I would say that it in no way would interfere with the enjoyment of the program.

One comment regarding program content. I believe that this program was considered so successful was the fact that there was no detailed, blood guts and gore. The content of the series was moderate and did not get into detailed gore or overly suggestive content.

The music used in the series is also great.

The series changed a bit when Ray Vecio took over for Ray Vecio. When Paul Maricano left the program I lost interest when watching the series on TV. I must admit though, the series played a great card by playing Marciano's departure from the series into the series. Great thinking by the producers! The new Ray grows on you after a short while and the series is just as interesting as the beginning. It would appear Frasier changed a bit as well as he became more ""hands on"" when dealing with suspects. It appeared that the producers were attempting to keep up with the times with the action as well as the theme song. The origonal theme was perfect as it was...but got jazzed up with electric guitars and a slight change.....Still good though

I don't think that the partners of Gross and Marciano could be matched by anyone else though. It appears that they worked together very well.

This is a good example of a fine program. Buy it and enjoy!

Also after the original Ray left it was never the same, the whole show went under.  Anyway for a cop/Mountie show this was one was a lone shark and gave vulnerability and heart that TV shows such as CSI and without a trace could give there back teeth for.

This first season proves it the acting, story lines thanks to the superb Haggis and everything about this show makes it stand out, it has also stood the test of time, well.  Bar the mobile phones and crazy styles anyway.

However it was at the very end of this season that something truelly magic did happen and it don't happen very often either.  The chemistry the fact they were willing to take the bullet for each other and practically from 'The Deal' onwards this show was on epic form & continued it right through till it was sadly axed and then lost David Marciano.

Victoria Secret and Letting Go are even now superb to look at visually and emotionally, the music like the characters hit the soul and without characters like Benton and Ray our TV today would still be in the dark ages.

2347408,4,B000A0GY0K,"True, the US sets are cheaper than the Canada sets (though if you buy the canada sets from Amazon.ca, they're LOTS cheaper than buying them as imports from Amazon.com). True, the Canadian sets have difficult packaging (DVD overlay and spindles that require a lot of pressure before you can pop out the disk without risk of damage). True the first two Canadian season sets use the dreaded ""flipper"" (2-sided) disks. True what we saw in the US as a third season of 22 (missing four episodes, by the way) was produced and broadcast in Canada as two seasons of 13 each -- and the third and fourth DVD sets are released separately too. (Does the US ""third season"" set have all 26?) And most ironic truth of all: if I'd known that by waiting, I'd have gotten all three sets cheaper from an American distributor, I'd've taken that route too.

However -- the Canadian sets feature pristine transfers. (I've read that the US sets use videotape as the masters; I'm not sure where this info comes from, but it doesn't make sense that the masters would be any different than what the Alliance sets drew upon, since they license the material.) The Canadian sets feature disks running at the highest speed. (The American disks are single sided because they jam twice the normal amount of eps. per side, and run at a slower speed. That, it seems to me, would account for VHS-like resolution.) The Canadian sets, for whatever it's worth, do feature accurate packaging (the right cast members listed and featured in illustrations).

-- small thing though it may be --

-- the Caniadian Final (4th) Season set does have a small but utterly delightful extra. Paul Gross does a running commentary for both parts of CALL OF THE WILD. I can live without most commentary tracks I hear, but this is one you'll return to. It's witty, wryly funny and thoughtfully observed.

2347409,5,B000A0GY0K,"I found out about the domestic release of Due South on Amazon.com, and rushed out to buy all three seasons. The Canadian box sets are $80 Canadian, so buying all four seasons from Canada is an expensive proposition. The American release costs a third of that, and contains the pilot to boot, which wasn't included until the Season 3 box set in Canada.

Due South followed the misguided adventures of Benton Fraser, a constable in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police, as he tracked his father's killers to Chicago. After closing the case, his Canadian superiors advised him to lie low, so he remains in Chicago as a liaison at the Canadian consulate and works cases with Ray Vecchio, Chicago cop. The Canadian/American and wilderness/city culture clash leads to some humorous moments along the way.

The picture quality is noticeably grainy since it was taken from videotape rather than the masters, but for the great price (I now have all the seasons for less than one season of the Canadian box set), it's a compromise that was worth it. Like the Canadian set, there are no extras, also no closed captioning. Menus are bare bones and include episodes and chapter menus (hardly ""interactive"" menus as stated on the box). The packaging is a big step from the clunky Canadian design, featuring an attractive foldout cardboard case with large photos of Ray, Benton, and Dief. The DVDs are single sided, meaning easier handling. And all 24 first season episodes are here, including the two-hour pilot and two-part Victoria's Secret, possibly the finest episode of the entire series.

Due South was a unique show that poked fun at Canadians from an ""American"" perspective. The show was set in Chicago (there are several inserts of Chicago landmarks such as the Sears Tower and El tracks) was filmed in Toronto: note the streetcar tracks and noticeable Toronto financial buildings in some of the rooftop shots, also, the Roy Thomson concert hall is clearly visible in ""One Good Man."" ""American"" characters clearly speak with a Canadian accent, in one episode a man mentions Parliamentary law while debating with a ""Chicago"" alderman, but all in all, a fun tribute to my native city (Chicago) and my adopted one (Toronto). (My favourite surreal moment is in ""The Man Who Knew Too Little,"" where they are supposedly in Michigan [the highway markers are distinctively Ontarian] and mention the town where I grew up).

Although the picture quality is less than stellar, it certainly beats my old videotaped copies that were rapidly deteriorating, and it's wonderful to reconnect with the excellent scripts, jokes, and friendly jabs at Canadian culture (curling, hockey, bilingualism, politeness, etc.). The first two seasons are very family friendly, with limited swearing, violence, and sexual overtones. The third (and fourth, depending on how you count the last season) season was much darker, grittier, and sexually charged, including explicit songs on the soundtrack, and may not be as suitable for family viewing.",1137283200,12,3007,5.080971659919029

No, there's no widescreen, no CC and no scene selection and the quality isn't what you'd get out of the Canadian version, but at least with this release we finally have the pilot that should've been inculded in the original release. And it's still very watchable, VHS-type quality aside.

I could wish for a whole lot more in the way of features and quality, but it would probably end up costing much more and this was about all I could afford. It's worth they money, here, just don't expect too much out of it.",1136851200,3,563,4.413461538461538
2347411,5,B000A0GY0K,"Hi everyone! I just wanted to express my thoughts on the TV show ""Due South"" and this version of it on dvd.

First of all, the packaging is very nice. The discs stay inside the package securely, and there's no risk of scratching. That is, if you buy it from a store. (Try Best Buy, Borders and Books, etc). Shipping through mail: I don't know. The sets have just the episodes. I heard the International version is a lot more expensive, and the only extra featres you get are subtitles and a commentary on one episode or something. So this version is more worth it. The picture and audio are very clear.

Second of all, the U.S. had only three seasons of the show, so if you get this version, there is only three season sets (with all episodes). In Canada, the third season was split into two, thus the third and fourth season on the International version dvds.

And finally, my commentary on the show. Unfortunately, I was a little young when the episodes aired and I didn't know about the show. A few years later, I catch it on syndication and grow to *love* it! You probably know its about a Mountie and a Chicago cop. The first two seasons starred Paul Gross and David Marciano. Then, Marciano left and Callum Keith Rennie replaced him as the detective. It really plays on the differences between Canadians and Americans, while combining action, comedy, and a lot of heart. I completely recommend it.

Greetings from Canada!

2347412,5,B000A0GY0K,"I'm so glad I learned about this Television Series. I never caught it when it was on the air, but I'm loving the first season of episodes. I like unique shows that combine comedy, drama and quirky characters (like Northern Exposure, Gilmore Girls and Monk). Due South fits very well into this category. It's a cop show (complete with car chases.) It has wonderful characters you instantly like. The themes about friendship are strong. And the comedy is deadpan and hilarious. The set-up for the show is that a member of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police ends up working in Chicago as the unofficial partner of a Chicago Detective. The Canadian is perfect: polite, proper, sweet, gorgeous, brilliant, loyal, proficient and ever-so-serious. The Chicago cop is cynical, bumbling, uncool, intuitive, and a loyal friend. They're the perfect pair, and it's the dynamic between the two of them that makes for great comedy. I highly recommend it anyone looking for a new show that's well written, well directed, well acted & well filmed.",1132444800,40,1029,4.988372093023256
2347413,4,B000A0GY0K,"Although this item is listed as a R1 DVD it does appear to play on standard (i.e. not multiregion) R2 players & computers which is excellent news for UK fans.

The re-designed package is very nice & the general video/audio quality seem fine.

I didn't know that this US release was transferred from VHS masters but I'm suprised that the Canadian ones are superior...

The reviews for the original releases at Amazon.ca: (Season1. ASIN B00006RG6Y. & Season2. ASIN B00008IHE6)  are consistantly about the terrible video quality & bad case design.

Very glad to see this series at a reasonable price & finally with the Pilot Episode in the correct place (!).",1129939200,4,655,4.864864864864865
