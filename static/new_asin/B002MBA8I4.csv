I am a 66 year old criminal defense attorney and Law Professor in the Chicago Metropolitan area. Though we don't have any mountains (and only a few hills) we do have some impressive-for-the-area Rails to Trails pathways, but lousy weather winters. However, I have a son who has a mountain guide ,skiing, climbing business in Durango, Colorado (Klingmountainguides.com) whom I try to visit at least a couple of time /year. His wife is the HR person at Durango Purgatory Ski Resort. Of passing interest is that when my son Josh, now 30, was 15 he and a group of kids biked from Virginia to Los Angeles which is where we discovered Durango en route.

Through a number of trips to Durango and surrounding areas I began looking on line for biking videos in the region and found you folks. The rest is history. I have either purchased or been given as presents ""Indian to Girdwood,"" ""Evergreen to Red Rocks,"" ""E Rock Rocks,"" ""Training to Climb, Rattlesnake Bite,"" ""Laying Down the Hammer,"" ""Training to Endure, Front Range...."" and ""Bay Area Backroads."" I assure you my orders for the rest of your Colorado and the High Country videos are only a paycheck away.

I hold you completely responsible for my significant diversion from work and family, spending extra money for the videos, not to mention phenomenally better emotional and physical health and outlook and enjoyment of life in an otherwise flat topographically boring environment. I really appreciate your attention to detail, especially enjoy the narrated videos, and look forward to a long relationship. Have a great year.",1327276800,,1643,4.967272727272727
