A labor of love for director Jim Abrahams whose own son suffered from epilepsy helped by alternative medicine, this  is the story of a farmer (Ward) and his wife (the ever wonderful Streep  making a rare television appearance) whose youngest son, Robbie (Adkins)  developes epilepsy.

1725608,5,B000068MBW,"I chose to watch this movie because my son has recently been diagnosed as having epilepsy. He has pretty good control over his seizures and only has 1 or 2 a week. It amazed me to see how the treatment of the disease has changed. The disease was so secretive and people were so misinformed. One part of the movie had me in tears when the little boy was playing in the play room with a friend. When the friends mother realized he had epilepsy she quickly moved her son like he could ""catch"" the disease.

Meryl Streep plays the mother of Robbie, who is diagnosed with epilepsy. Her emotions and frustrations are very real. We are frustrated and scared. We don't know what the next step is. We don't know how to help. She shows all those emotions wonderfully!

The story is based on the struggles that the author faced when his son was diagnosed with epilepsy. When all other options were used and the doctors seem to be giving up they turned to another option. The Ketogenic diet is used in hard to control epilepsy and can work amazingly on some cases. The parents of the boy in the movie have to fight doctors who think their way is best to allow them to take Robbie across country to Johns Hopkins to try the diet. Sometimes parents have to push for what is best.

One of the best things about this movie...not all the actors are actors. They are adults who went through the Ketogenic diet as children, or children going through it now. Even a nutritionist who helps with Ketogenic patients had a part in the movie. They are the true heroes of the story.",1437436800,2,1556,4.395833333333333

1725610,5,B000068MBW,"This film proves that alternative medicine is  sometimes a better tool to use than conventional medications in treating seizure disorders. Thank God that neurologists at the world famous Johns Hopkins University Hospital in Baltimore are willing to try such alternatives rather than life -threatening brain surgery  (as doctors in Kansas City wanted to perform on poor Robbie ) when conventional medications fail to halt a patient's seizures. I have this film in my library. I have had seizures, too, but an anti seizure drug thankfully stopped them. Mine were grand mals. I have not had one in over 27 years. I thank God for that.

1725624,4,B000068MBW,"In the 80s I worked the front office for a nutritional biochemist who had helped me get well when no doctor could figure out what was wrong with me. A woman brought her little girl to our office looking for help. Her child was 6 years old and was very thin and was wearing a helmet because of the damage she suffered from her seizures. Her look was blank and she had black circles under her eyes. I was in my twenties then and it broke my heart to look at her suffering like that. The woman explained that she had no one else to turn to, that her daughter was having constant seizures and it was suggested that she be institutionalized.  The woman looked broken and, honestly, I did not know if we could do anything for her.  After hair and blood testing she was told that the girl was getting too much sugar from drinking juice and sugary drinks and foods and to take her off of that junk food.  Back then 100% fruit juice was thought to be healthy although we now know that that is too much sugar. Her follow up was in 4 weeks. I think she also got some kid supplements. I was shocked when the woman showed up one month later with the little girl, no helmet, a smiling little kid! She was down to only having one seizure a week, if that!  I was a wise-ass little know-it-all when I was in my 20s and that lesson really taught me how much I DIDN'T know! Diet does make all the difference.

1725653,5,B000068MBW,"An engaging movie about a difficult subject.  The best thing about the movie is that, to a person with epilepsy it rings very true.  It portrays epilepsy accurately and with dignity.  You see the frustration and suffering of living with seizures.  There is a loving and advocating mother, a deeply affected but withdrawn father, and even a jealous brother.  It nails the medical profession as it can appear to a family with a poorly understood and inadequately treated condition, without being unfair to the doctor.  If you know someone with epilepsy, or their family, and you almost certainly do, it's a great way to understand what that's like.  I cried A LOT because it struck so close to home.  Jim Abrams, the director, is the father of Charlie, the real life ""Robbie"", and so the film is a product of his experience in caring and advocating for his son.

1725665,5,B000068MBW,"First Do No Harm is an underrated masterpiece that brilliantly captures the pain and suffering an entire family goes through when one of their young children is diagnosed with epilepsy. The acting is particularly convincing; I was amazed at how well Seth Adkins portrayed Robbie Reimuller; he made me believe he actually had epileptic seizures! Meryl Streep and Fred Ward also give tour-de-force performances. The choreography and cinematography reflect great forethought, too.

When the film starts, we quickly meet a small town Midwest family who, while not rich, live their lives happily. Unfortunately, trouble sets in when Robbie falls down at school--and not long after he is diagnosed with epilepsy. Robbie's parents Dave (Fred Ward) and Lori Reimuller (Meryl Streep) are horrified; and it seems that with every drug they try to treat his epilepsy Robbie only gets worse. Indeed, Robbie is soon on a huge number of drugs--sometimes more than one for the epilepsy and others to combat the side effects of the epileptic drugs! The family begins to fall apart as everyone feels the strain and it all gets so bad that Robbie's older brother actually wishes Robbie were dead!

When the family's health insurance is cancelled and their savings runs out, his parents must go to a public hospital where staff are so overwhelmed that they can't always be on the ward--and Robbie just gets worse and worse. Dave and Lori must also contend with the amazingly callous Dr. Melanie Abbasac (Allison Janney) who doesn't offer them or Robbie any comfort--or much hope.

Lori, who is now desperate to save her son, goes to the library to do her own research on epilepsy and what can be done to treat it. While reading about epilepsy, Lori discovers something called the Ketogenic Diet which gives people a chance to fight their epilepsy without drugs; and Lori wants to take Robbie to Baltimore where there is a treatment facility that can treat Robbie with the special diet. However, tensions mount when Dr. Abbasac is vehemently against letting Robbie leave the hospital because the diet is not approved by the medical community.

I won't tell you much more to avoid giving out spoilers. I've already left out some of the plot so that you can appreciate this film as much as I did. Suffice it to say that it's all very poignant and this film is not something you will forget anytime soon.

The DVD doesn't come with any extras; I would have liked an interview with a few members of the cast and/or the director but it's all so well done that this becomes a minor quibble. Look also for great performances by Margo Martindale and Marjean; Mairon Bennett as Lynne Reimuller; Michael Yarmush as Mark Reimuller and Tom Butler as Dr. Jim Peterson. Kudos goes to Millicent Kelly, who worked tirelessly for decades at the treatment facility as a Ketogenic Diet Specialist; she has a fine cameo in this film.

First Do No Harm is a poignant, sensitive film that will move you even if you and the people you know have not been overwhelmed by the terrible disease of epilepsy. I also highly recommend this film for people interested in this subject matter. Fans of the actors in this film would do well to get this for their collections.",1357257600,4,3219,4.822463768115942

Thankfully, as scared as I was I didn't die, I didn't end up in a nursing home but I got put on so many medicines afterwards that they wouldn't try before it.  Still had 4/5 a week & all the side effects that I don't want to live with.  While trying to figure out what to do myself I saw the end of this movie on our tv station - I ordered it to see it.

However, as good as she is in this and Allison Janney as that stupid doctor, Seth Adkins I believe carries it all the way. Scenes which I believe he's exceptionally good in is the one where he sees the horse for the first time and stands there on the steps mezmerized. His big dark eyes just light up the screen! Another is his first seizure scene by the fence, another is the one where he's running through the house and eventually bangs his head on the chair. His seizure scene on the living room couch and his screaming scene in the hospital when the nurse puts him in the ""playpen"" or whatever it is. Finally the parade scene at the end where he's smiling and waves his hat.

Boy can Seth act! If he hasn't done Broadway yet, he should.

1725671,4,B000068MBW,"I could relate my own case to this movie. Mine is not that of a parent, like those played in the movie, but of a fifty something year old trying to get better.

The child in the film is helpless and very young, so parents advocate for him.  Meryl Streep is her usual sterling self, playing this role with extreme amounts of empathy, interacting with husband, doctors, and others helping with her battle, or fighting similar ones.

Unlike Lorenzo's Oil, the urgency of a dying child is absent from this plot.  Instead, there is the effort to try to achieve some kind of normalcy, for a child going through precious times that can never be recovered.  What happens to him now will affect all of his future quality of life, and Streep plays a mother who knows it.

The message is that you can sometimes still play, having been dealt a bad hand, but don't expect it to come without sweat and tears.  One painful moment occurs when a child afflicted similarly to her own, dies, possibly from a treatment being tried on him.

The tears come easily for me, because, as a bonus with my illness, I have what they call ""pseudo-bulbar affect"", which is a tendency to laughter or tears that cannot be controlled.  Dextromethorphan syrup helps.  This is a  film to be careful of, in my situation.  The situation is one where a mother is forced into a very unfeeling, uncaring, and sometimes even sadistic medical system.  This happens when her husband is laid off and loses his medical insurance coverage.  The insurance company is one of the ones Barack Obama was talking about, when he decried the often-used excuse of ""pre-existing illness"", denying health-care to the insured.

She finds herself in a hostile system that would rather experiment on her child with poisonous drugs than try to fix his problem.  The nightmare is that this scenario is not uncommon at all.  Doctors are trained to ""first do no harm"", but they have a very hard time with the actual fulfillment of that promise.  When they are unable to bring someone back from whatever they consider to be the brink, and they have ""given up"" trying to repair a person, they feel no compunction about sacrificing whatever may be left on the altar of science.  Consequently, opportunities for real help are lost, and harm is done.  In many cases, harm may be done, simply by omission.

Perhaps Hippocrates should have said, ""first do no harm, and last, never give up.""  But doctors/scientists, as in this film, will always trot out the need for 'more study', with 'randomized placebo-controlled' clinical trials to test any promising treatment, which may take many years, and find out nothing useful to the participant.  They may do so only to make the drug market more fair to the existing drug manufacturers, who will lose if a better treatment (or 'cure') is found.  These studies allow doctors and drug companies to stay out of court, but they are often completely incompatible with the practice of medicine.  This film, along with ""Lorenzo's Oil"", have been called a 'genre', but they are just tear-jerkers, which may elicit more tears because they are based on true stories.",1288828800,3,3130,4.7518518518518515

A few years after watching this movie my 2 year old son suddenly began having seizures, 100's of them. He went through excactly what First Do No Harm portrays, drug reactions, personality changes, near death experiences, non stop seizing...it was a nightmare. Then I remember this movie. I began researching the Ketogenic Diet, I talked with our specialist about it only to be told the diet was too difficult and it could not be done. I did not give up, I went to another doc and asked for my son to begin the diet. A few short weeks later my son was fasting, and I was weighing every bite of food that he consumed, mainly cream, oil, butter, etc...it was our miracle diet. after 2 weeks of the diet my Luke laughed for the first time in months!

I will continue to use this movie to get the point across to my classes.

I was never on the ketogenic diet when I was a child, but have gone though most of the medications that have been put onto the market.  Watching this movie reminded me of what my parents went through, and are still going through with my intractable epilepsy, in dealing with my epilepsy.  I was blest with good neurologists as a pediactric and now at Cleveland Clinic.

I found the acting to be superb as it showed how a family stuggles day to day with intractable epilepsy.  Watching the scenes where the parents were learning and haveing to accept that their child had epilepsy had a profound effect on me.  Seeing Meryl Streep take her character as Robbie's mother in such a strong way reminded me of how my own mother drew strength with how she dealt with my epilepsy.

The plot, though ""based on a true story,"" is highly contrived and obnoxious with its metaphors.  I hated the musical montages. I had zero empathy for every boring character, and this movie begs for your empathy.  Meryl Streep is always either wildly emotional and bitchy, or trying very hard to be cute.  Her love scene with her character's redneck husband made me cringe in disgust.  Worst of all was her screaming and crying little creep of a son.  If you have a low tolerance for incessantly yelling and screaming children (as I do) this movie will test the limits of your patience.  I now take a double helping of birth control and punch myself in the uterus every morning just to be safe.  I saw the ending coming a mile away:  will little Robbie come to symbolize the little boy in The Emperor's New Clothes, and will the movie end with him victoriously riding atop his new horse (which throughout the movie he ceaselessly demands to ride)?

This movie was based on a true story about a family that was struggling financially. It was not based on Jim Abrahams son Charlie. The boy this movie was based on is in his early forties today and is seizure free. As a matter of fact he make a living as a roofer. He and his family attribute his cure to the Ketogenic Diet. I know this for a fact because I know the family this story was based on. I have also witnessed the effect the diet has had on many different children with Epilepsy and it does work for most. If you would like to know more about the diet go to the Charlie Foundation and see what you can do to help further the cause.

However, his mother has studied everything she can about epilepsy, and come across a special diet, the Ketogenic Diet, that held out promise.  Rather than let the doctors do the surgery in their local hospital, the mother takes the boy to Johns Hopkins Hospital for the diet.  It starts out with fasting!  At the same time we can assume that the priest and nuns at the convent where they are staying are praying for the little boy.  For those who don't have an epileptic child, the real impact of this movie is not felt until the end when you discover that many of the characters were actual child epileptic patients who had been completely freed of epilepsy though the diet, most now adults!

Buoyed by the incredible performance of Meryl Streep, FIRST DO NO HARM looks at our medical system and how it sometimes disregards the needs and desires of the patients and their families.  Epilepsy is portrayed as a truly horrible disease, and when it attacks someone so young as little Robbie in this film, it only increases its destruction.  How this affects a normal family and how they manage to cope with its repercussions is poignantly captured in this movie.  Streep is brilliant as always and she is given good support from Fred Ward in one of his best performances and Allison Janney as the seemingly heartless doctor who negates the diet itself.  Interspersed are ""real"" people who have benefitted from the diet in small roles.  Little Seth Adkins is remarkable as Robbie, he truly makes us believe he has epilepsy.

1725706,5,B000068MBW,"My 3,1/2 year old daughter has intractable epilepsy that has been unresponsive to drug treatment, and has experienced very [VERY}undesirable side effects from anti-epileptic drugs [aeds] Hayven has been on the ketogenic diet for 4 months now. Although she is not seizure free, we have noticed about a 65% decrease in her overall seizure activity. She used to have 12-25 ""drop"" [atonic]seizures a day, with almost constant ""pulsing, bucking, rythmic activity' [myoclonus] Since the diet she is down to 1-2 ""drops' and almost no myoclonic activity. This movie paints a very realistic picture of the lives effected by this disorder. Although I never had to get on a plane against medical advice to take my child far away for treatment, I have had to literally SCREAM at the doctors and advocate for my childs best interests. We have been fortunate enough to have found a child neurology clinic 12 miles from home where they readily offer the diet as treatment, and our particular doctor [who we had to wait 2 years to see due to the red-tape of insurance companies&nbsp;]] has already started to wean her off of the 3 aeds she is currently on. This diet is very labor intensive and strict, and I can't say that is has been a picnic, but the truth is that it IS worth a try. It is helping us tremendously even though is has also been a source of severe stress.

1725707,5,B000068MBW,"A friend from church loaned me this video to watch this weekend. She said when she saw it, it reminded her of us.  I have a 5 year old son that has a seizure disorder (never diagnosed as epilepsy) yet no doctor has ever been able to figure out the cause.  When he was 3 he went over 15 months without a seizure and was even taken off all seizure medication then almost 1 year later he started having multiple seizures of all types. He was hospitalized quite a bit within a 30 day period.  He had all sorts of tests and they still couldn't figure anything out.  One visit landed him in the PICU because he was having a focal seizure and quit breathing. Our lives were turned upside down.
Watching this movie was like watching re-runs of that time.  The behavior issues from the new meds (which kept getting him sent home from school).  He use to be in regular room Kindergarten and now he is in Special Ed full time. He was also taking 7 different prescriptions a day (this also because he is ADHD on top of this). 2 meds for seizures, 3 meds for ADHD and 2 meds to offset the affects of all of the other meds (way too many for liking) so we took him off of the 2 meds for the side affects.
My son was watching the part of the movie when the wheeled in the bed with the bubble top and he said ""that's my bed!"" Our hospital visits were nightmares because they had to pump him full of a valuum to stop the seizures but then he would be physically and verbally out of control for atleast 24 consecutive hours after he pulled out of his Postictal stage.
I just have to commend the producer of this movie for the work done because those who have never experienced this will never understand.  This movie was more real than anyone will know.  It not only addresses the medical part but the home environment and how hard it is.  I have 2 daughters whose ages are comparable to Robbie's brother and sister and, yes, it was vey hard on them because everything we did from that point on revolved around my son.
We are one of the luckier ones because we have managed to get the worse seizures under control. He still has partials that cause him headaches, drowsiness, nauseousness, tremors and in a few cases his legs refused to hold him.  I still don't think he is on the right medication and I don't know if the Ketogenic diet would be right for him, but for now he back at school and has a great teacher who works with him when he has his ""episodes"" and has to sleep for over an hour to recover during class.  What I appreciate is the knowing that there is an alternative if the medications don't work, because I know my Pedicatric Neuroligst hasn't said a word to us about it.

1725711,5,B000068MBW,"When I first heard this movie was going to air, I purposely skipped watching it. It was too close to home. Our little girl was battling epileptic seizures and side-effects from drugs that didn't work, but I had been told by her doctors that the Ketogenic Diet would not work for her. A couple of years went by and we happily found ourselves in the hands of a new (to us) and wonderful pediatric neurologist in Portland, Oregon. Katera was not doing well and we turned to him for help. He actually recommended the diet for her right away, much to our amazement. We researched it and decided to trust him and go for it. She started the diet in October of 2000 at age 4 and one year later, is now seizure free, off all medications and thriving. I had an opportunity to watch First Do No Harm a few months after we started the diet and was profoundly moved... although some parts were very painful reminders of where we had been. There is a scene where the little boy is continuosly seizing while all the ER staff is surrounding him, working frantically to save him, and the mom is standing helplessly by, watching in horror. It was almost like they had filmed OUR lives.... because we had been through an event just like that. I will spare you the details except to say that scene was not overly exaggerated... it really does happen. Our daughter, just like the little boy in the film, has had dangerous, life-threatening status seizures that were CAUSED by the anti-epileptic drugs that she was given to supposedly prevent seizures. I know medications can work well for some but for those who aren't so lucky, this diet is a complete miracle. It has not been easy.... it takes dedication.

1725712,5,B000068MBW,"Does the medical community have the right to censor information about alternative medical treatments that don't include drugs or surgery?  Is  the double-blind study the start-all and end-all in the world of medical  research and technology?  Are anecdotal studies to simply be dismissed?  These questions are dealt with in a most sensitive manner in the film  ""...first do no harm."" I found the plot to be very engrossing and  the story absolutely heartbreaking.  In the film ""Robbie  Reimuller"" (Seth Adkins) is subjected to one drug after the  other...each carrying devastating side effects. Each new drug meant another  drug to treat side effects and no drug achieved cessation of Robbie's  seizures. Desparate to rescue her son from a fate far worse than death, his  mother (Merrill Streep) begins to research childhood epilepsy herself and  comes across case study after case study that showed the success of the  KETOGENIC DIET, which was being administered at the Johns Hopkins Medical  Center (Baltimore, MD). When Robbie's mom confronted Dr. Avarsack (sp?)with  the information, she was told the diet does not work and was politely  escorted out of the doctor's office. However, the mother perseveres and  gets her son enrolled in the Ketogenic Diet at Johns Hopkins Medical Center  in Baltimore with the help of a doctor who was a friend of the family and  the nurse that took care of Robbie and within a month, Robbie was seizure  free. He was on the diet for three years and after that was returned to a  normal diet.
One thing that made this movie special is the fact that most  of the actors had been on the Ketogenic Diet as children and were all  leading normal, healthy, happy lives.
It is my hope that this film will  reach parents of children suffering from epilepsy and that it will save the  child from being subjected to needless drugging and surgery.

I thought it would be going against allopathic medicine with its useless, poisonous pharma drugs, and instead, promoting a real plant-based solution like CBD oil as a treatment for epileptic seizures. But rather than offering any real cure that truly does no harm, we get a full-on advertisement for a killer diet called ketogenic -- which happens to be sponsored by the powerful Meat, Dairy and Egg industries: bacon, eggs, cheeseburgers, butter, dairy yogurt and whipped cream! There is no proof this horrible diet stops seizures and I know for a fact that it will cause a heart attack, stroke and bowel cancer.

The title is ironic and dishonest, as there is a whole lot of harm being done with this diet  to people, to animals, and to the environment; everyone, that is, except the very wealthy and omnipotent industries whom were bankrolling this insidious propaganda piece.
