5279300,5,B0099115FK,"In this entertaining series, Anthony Melchiorri is teaching all retail businesses how to take the perspective of their customers.  He rapidly, and respectfully, trains indolent, clueless, owners, managers, and employees, in the art of retailing.  It should be a required course in any business school across the country.",1359331200,3,320,5.645833333333333
5279301,4,B0099115FK,It's a great show to learn which are the most common mistakes hoteliers make and the solutions for them. It's also very entertaining.  Great Buy!,1358467200,3,145,4.8
5279302,4,B0099115FK,"I love Hotel Impossible; I think it's great - in fact, I use it in my hospitality courses because I think the show does a such a good job of covering a variety of aspects within the lodging industry (better than I can do by lecturing). I have to say, I was dissappointed that the entire season (1) wasn't included within this set. Hopefully the missing episodes will be released at some point - because they were all enjoyable.",1355356800,9,427,4.417721518987341

8537937,5,B0099115FK,"Anthony is the man! I love Hotel Impossible. It is one of my top 3 T.V. shows along with Big Brother on CBS and American Greed on CNBC. There are many terrible places on this show and tons of creeps and lowlifes. Very fun to see what Anthony and his crew find and also how the owners handle themselves on camera. Lots of places with bed bugs, bad building practices, stuff falling apart  and things that don't make much sense.  One time there was an owner who had bought another hotel's that was going out of business used and water-damaged mattresses and also all the hotel's furnishes that were from the 1980's and were out of date. Anthony tolld the guy he was wasting his money and that the  stuff couldn't be saved and made the guy get rid of the stuff. The same guy wad putting in a disco rather than putting money into fixing his hotel up and getting heat put in. Some people are cool. Sometimes there are people who have bought hotels and have never worked in a hotel before or the hotel industry and are wondering why there hotel is failing. LOL! The inspections are the best part of Hotel Impossible. The crazy owners are fun to watch as well. It's always funny when they fix a place up and then the owners changes it or the place keeps failing when you already knew that was going to happen.",1470614400,,1302,4.327868852459017
8537938,5,B0099115FK,"This show is SO entertaining! Anthony has such great energy and always makes me laugh! I also enjoy Gordon Ramsay's ""Hotel Hell"" and this is similar.  Anthony also has a lot of heart and that makes his show very enjoyable!",1451001600,2,222,4.55
8537939,5,B0099115FK,This show inspired us to make positive changes in our own business.  Highly recommend!!!!,1447027200,,89,5.357142857142857
8537940,5,B0099115FK,I wish that there were more seasons on DVD! I really enjoy this show!,1438473600,,69,4.0
8537941,5,B0099115FK,"God I love this show. I at first had my reservations (no pun intended) but it started to grow on me. Anthony while he's a good guy doesn't pull any punches when he finds something wrong even though he's been invited to help out. This is a show that should be used for people working and training in the hotel industry because Anthony covers everything from the decor all the way through security, maintenance, and housekeeping.",1424476800,,427,4.631578947368421
