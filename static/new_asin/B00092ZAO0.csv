8056808,5,B00092ZAO0,"Patrice Chreaus legendary 1976 centenary production of Wagners mammoth tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen was one of the theatrical events of the 20th century and this DVD set (recorded in 1980) is a mandatory purchase for all Wagnerians. For once Deutsche Grammophons sales spiel does not lie. Just like Stravinskys Rite of Spring decades earlier, this staging caused a riot when it was first seen, the Bayreuth audience split right down the middle in their hatred/love of what Chreau had done to their beloved Ring. Though there had been important precursors (Joachim Herzs 1973 Leipzig production for one), Chreau confidently jumped off in a fresh direction directing the cycle in a way that had never been seen before at Bayreuth. The fact that he did so in such an accomplished way (if it was technically shoddy it would have been easier to dismiss) at the very shrine of Planet Wagner sent shock waves across the world and changed Wagner production (and arguably opera production in toto) forever.

It was Chreau who more than any other introduced into the modern conscience (his ideas actually go back through Giorgio Strehler to Walter Felsenstein in the 1930s-40s and then to Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig at the turn of the century) the idea of regietheater (directors theater) to an art-form which had hitherto been the domain of traditional naturalistic/realistic obeisance to composers stage directions. On seeing Chreaus desecration traditionalists clamored to have their naturalistic Ring returned to them and Bayreuth duly obliged in 1983 with Peter Halls faithful, but ill-fated rendering. Then there was the New York Wagner style inaugurated by Otto Schenk, his 1989 Ring held up as a model production by some, but decried as a sterile museum piece with absolutely nothing to say by others. Regietheater (or produceritis as detractors call it) on the other hand has continued unabated with sometimes outstanding, but often ridiculous results, especially at Bayreuth. The last three shock at all costs Ring productions have barely turned a head, the fact that you could still buy tickets for this years cycle on the net even after the festival had started telling its own story as director-centered ego-trips continue to drive audiences away. In truth Chreau has a lot to answer for, but from where I sit there is obviously good traditional Ring production (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, San Francisco 1990) and bad (Schenk), just as there is good regietheater Ring production (Kupfer, Bayreuth 1988) and bad (La Fura dels Baus, Barcelona, 2007). An open mind is what is required. For me the Chreau is an example of top quality regietheater which works almost perfectly. It should be noted that at Bayreuth the volatility of its hostile reception was matched by the warmth of the 90-minute standing ovation it received at the end of its final performance in 1980.

Its perhaps hard for audiences now to understand the furor surrounding Chreaus production. There have been so many weird and wonderful stagings of the Ring since that the Chreau now looks decidedly old-fashioned and is probably the regietheater production that traditionalists will like the most. In the tradition of Felsenstein Chreau pays attention throughout to the text as sung, and also respects Wagners stage directions a lot more than is given credit for. We are given the Rhine, proper giants, Alberich turning into a proper wurm and then frog, a neo-classical Valhalla, a factory floor Nibelheim, real forest settings, a romantic mountain top quasi-Greek temple Valkyrie rock, a huge dragon wheeled around on stage and a neo-classical Gibichung hall set on the shore of the Rhine. Magic fire traditionally envelops the Valkyrie rock and the tetralogy closes with an immolation of real flames with Valhalla clearly burning in the background. Wagner would have recognized this Ring and outwardly there would appear to be not a lot to complain about.

However, place Chreaus production in the context of every Bayreuth Ring production that had preceded it and the grounds for complaint become obvious. Since the re-opening of the festival in 1951 there had been four different productions, two each by Wagners grandsons  Wieland (1951 and 1965) and Wolfgang (1960 and 1970). All four had emphasized the mythic timelessness of the piece with an abstraction that had contrasted markedly with the naturalism of the three pre-war productions that had also been directed by members of the Wagner family (Wagner himself, his widow Cosima and their son Siegfried) and the 1933-42 Heinz Tietjen cycle. The post-war New Bayreuth Entrmpelung (clearing out the attic) style served the double purpose of de-politicizing Wagner (ie; stripping it of those naughty Nazi trappings) as well as returning to the ideas of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig wherein the stage is stripped of inessentials and the central dramatic idea is honed in on and emphasized along with character psychology. For Wieland in particular it was important to return Wagner to his roots and his origins in ancient Greek tragedy. In his productions characters were turned into virtual Greek statues which combined with the spare treatment of the mise-en-scne to make for music drama which moved the audience primarily through a combination of the music and the ambiguity of time and space. Detractors accused Wieland of turning his grandfathers music dramas into oratorios, but it is now accepted that the Entrmpelung style was one ideal way of producing Wagner. Many people in that first night audience for Chreaus Ring remembered Wieland and Wolfgangs productions fondly and what they now saw amounted to downright provocation.

For Chreau social context was everything and he flouted all convention by setting the Ring squarely in the modern age of an industrializing European society. Das Rheingold is set in the late 18th century pre-industrial world, Die Walkre in the stage of early capitalism with Hunding the first entrepreneur/factory owner, Siegfried in the age of 19th century industrialism, and Gtterdmmerung in the interwar period of fascist capitalism. The pin-pointing of time and place tells us that Chreau is trying to reflect the very world that Wagner himself lived in, and also that far from characters being gods, giants and dwarfs, actually they all represent different aspects of the human species. In this respect Chreaus basic concept (though he denied ever having one as such) is undoubtedly Shavian. George Bernard Shaw argued in The Perfect Wagnerite that the Ring is centrally an allegory on the collapse of capitalism from its internal contradictions with the world of Man waiting for a hero to cleanse away the lame and cramped government of the godsReally, of course, the dwarfs, giants and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient, toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes. Chreau with his set designer Richard Peduzzi and costume designer Jacques Schmidt set about stripping the gods of their nobility and making all the characters as close to man (to the very people sitting in the audience) as possible with a clear emphasis on the old story of capitalism encapsulated in the pursuit of power wherein the key characters destroy everything including themselves to get what they want. This left wing socialist message was of course outrageous to the right wing Bayreuth audience who (with more than a little justification!) saw the production as an attack on themselves, a point driven home most of all in Gtterdmmerung act 2 when Siegfried wears black tie, ostensibly to resemble Gunther the weak industrialist who is used by the arch-fascist Hagen, but also of course to resemble the gentlemen of the audience also in black tie and also cogs in (what socialists see as) a fascist machine.

The pursuit of power through capitalism is emphasized throughout the production with the presence of giant factory wheels half-exposed on the stage side. The opening of Das Rheingold is the very image of man abusing nature to generate power in the hydro-electric dam run by the gold lying beneath it. Theres no depiction of ideally clean nature here, the idea of the Rhinemaidens innocent virginity going for nothing. Chreau turns them into Toulouse-Lautrec whores with Alberichs head up one of their skirts presenting sex as both erotic and sordid  an alternative power source to gold. Alberich stealing the gold is very much second best to the power of sexual love which he has to foreswear as part of the deal. This scene was hugely provocative to an audience used to seeing nature pure and unsullied before the arrival of Alberich, though it is in the text (if not the stage directions!) that nature has been violated before the Ring starts with Wotan tearing down a branch from the world ash tree and going on to fashion a spear with the rules by which he seeks to rule the world. These rules have made nature subservient to man (perfectly visualized by the dam and the prostitute Rhinemaidens), and especially subservient to the talented people who devise and administer States and Churches who we meet in the very next scene  Wotan and his fellow gods. Dressed in late 18th century finery and performing on a metal factory-like stage floor with those huge wheels to the side and the finished neo-classical Valhalla (based on Haus Wahnfried, Wagners Bayreuth home) in the background, the gods deal with the giants in the manner of a modern day business transaction. The descent to Nibelheim is a descent to the proletarian factory floor, the split class setting reminiscent of Fritz Langs Metropolis.

Deeply shocking was the violence of the raw physicality on display  Wotan hacking the ring off Alberichs finger with blood visible, Fafner bashing his brother to death with his bare hands, and so the provocation goes throughout Chreaus production. In Die Walkre Hundings hut is a fancy bourgeois establishment adjacent to a factory with the owner an entrepreneur surrounded by henchmen who later corner Siegmund for him to spear nastily through the testicles (the place which had violated his wife Sieglinde) with not one, but several malevolent stabs. Siegfried act 1 is centered round a factory forge with a mechanical contraption moving of its own accord as the sword is made a-new. Wotan would appear to be behind this as he is behind the caged wood-bird planted deliberately to guide Siegfried in act 2. This violates Wagners idea of Siegfried being a free hero, but it does accentuate the idea of the Wlsung race personifying Wotans will. By the time it came to Gtterdmmerung many in the first night audience had had enough. Siegfrieds seizing of the ring from Brnnhilde is viciously presented almost like a rape. The depiction of the Gibichungs uncomfortably close to themselves was the ultimate insult to the audience and when the arch fascist Hagen rammed his spear into Siegfrieds back repeatedly with sadistic relish many members of the audience yelled out, Genug! [Enough!] Many later productions have been even more violent and transgressive to the point that audiences these days watch expecting it. But in 1976 this was all new and incendiary for conservative audiences used to watching a different world disconnected from the twisted everyday realities we are all familiar with. Throughout Chreau denies us the Greek statuary of Wieland Wagner as well as the fairy tale winged helmets, robes and tunics of Norse mythology, forcing us instead to rub our noses in Our own dirty little corner. (Tom Sutcliffe).

Alongside the provocation though Chreau gives us a series of quite wonderfully-lit sets which provide for any number of arresting and deeply memorable stage pictures. The use of spotlights is particularly inspired, especially the strong beam drilling into Alberich and the stage beneath his feet as he curses the ring. The Todesverkndigung forest setting in Die Walkre act 2 is wonderfully atmospheric with soft light contrasting with the otherworldly haloes surrounding Siegmund and Brnnhilde which plays with a huge white sheet draped over the doomed hero in a moment of genius. The preceding Wotan/Brnnhilde encounter is also deeply impressive set in a Valhalla drawing room (not Wagners mountain top!) dominated by a huge Foucaults pendulum which Wotan stops on Das Ende!! at the end of his monolog delivered to his reflection in a giant full-length mirror which he covers with his coat because he can no longer bare the sight of himself. Best of all is the Valkyrie rock modeled after Arnold Bcklins The Isle of the Dead which for once suggests the right kind of ambiguity of both time and place. Like many of the scenes, Wotans act 3 farewell is intensely romantic as is the astonishing last scene of Gtterdmmerung with one of the most convincingly satisfying immolations in my experience, Valhalla burning movingly in the background.

Im not entirely convinced that a worthy Ring can strip away the timeless mythology and still work and I would agree with detractors in saying Chreau narrows the meaning of the tetralogy down too much. The Ring may be an anti-capitalist rant, but it is obviously about much more than that. By seizing on one textual reading Chreau loses sight of all the others. And yet, the romantic stage pictures he provides combine superbly with an astonishingly high degree of quality acting to completely carry us away and convince us that this is a truly great Ring. Chreau (now sadly no longer with us) was a true man of the theater who believed in long periods of intensive rehearsal between actors leading to the finished result which is both psychologically convincing and completely real. He reduces all the characters of the Ring to mortals, but he makes them feel for and against each other in a way that in 1976 was extremely rare in the opera house. That was the most important ingredient of Chreaus revolutionary take on Wagner, namely the introduction of serious theater into opera production which had hitherto been a matter of outdated static convention. All the central relationships (Wotan/Fricka, Alberich/Mime, Siegmund/Sieglinde, Wotan/Brnnhilde, Siegfried/Mime, Siegfried/Brnnhilde) are superbly drawn with singers basically becoming their characters for the time they are before us. The erotic abandon between the Wlsungs in Die Walkre is extraordinarily intense and giddily romantic, while Wotans farewell to Brnnhilde is a matter of great tenderness and held-in passion. Siegfried/Mime make an inspired double comic act in Siegfried act 1 and those intricate little encounters in act 2 are done with obvious relish by all. The awakening of Brnnhilde and the opulence of the closing duet is outstandingly rendered in that fabulous set as is the Gtterdmmerung prologue love music farewell. Possibly the greatest single span of music in the Ring is Gtterdmmerung act 2 and Chreau makes it superbly gripping, the setting combining with the way the singers react around each other to pitch-perfect electrifying effect. On a personally romantic level this Ring leaves almost all other productions for dead. The only other production on DVD that betters it for me is the Kupfer/Barenboim 1991/92 Bayreuth version which takes off from Chreau in the fabulous movement of the singers and their acting, but in a setting (the famous worlds highway) which effectively returns the Ring to timeless mythology where it rightfully belongs. One thing Chreau does do better though is the final immolation scene which is overwhelming in its effect. Kupfers ending is a disappointing whimper beside it, but on virtually all other points, he scores over Chreau. Especially Kupfer/Barenboim were blessed with extraordinary singing.

Musically alas, the Chreau Ring is flawed, but it is better I would say than any Ring coming after it except for the Barenboim/Kupfer production. Pierre Boulez was Wieland Wagners surprise choice to conduct Parsifal in 1966 and it was he who recommended Chreau for the centenary Ring a decade later. As with Parsifal (one of the fastest readings ever in the Festspielhaus) Boulez zips through the Ring very quickly blowing away the cobwebs with an extraordinary passion which belies his cold analytic reputation. The orchestra rebelled against him in 1976, but by 1980 they had been won over and on these DVDs we hear a wonderful blend which is much closer to Karl Bhm (1966) than it is to Barenboim (1992). The problems come with the singing which is uneven. There are no problems with the Nibelungs and the giants, all four voices commanding the sound picture as they should. Hermann Becht is an outstanding if not obviously evil Alberich, Heinz Zednik excels as his slippery brother Mime and steals the show completely in Das Rheingold as Loge. Hes the link between Gerhard Stolze and Graham Clark as great Bayreuth Loge/Mimes. Matti Salminen and Fritz Hbner make perfect baleful black as black giants. Salminen is my favorite Hunding on record while Hbner dominates the stage as Hagen with superb malevolence. The Wlsungs make a very good looking pair, Peter Hoffman singing with heroic ardor and making those cries of Wlse! long and spine-tingling. Jeannine Altmeyer is a slightly unsteady Sieglinde (not ideally pure of tone) and makes for a wobbly Gutrune. Hanna Schwarz makes a biting Fricka firm of tone and decisive (her appearance in Walkre act 2 is a highlight). The biggest problems come with the biggest roles and as they are on the stage the longest, this is a serious flaw. I have to say that I cant be completely objective about this recording. This was my first Ring recording, the one I listened to on LP endlessly as a teenager pouring over the libretti with an enthusiasm I can barely muster now. Inside me Donald McIntyre, Manfred Jung and Gwyneth Jones have always been Wotan, Siegfried and Brnnhilde, and I love their performances deeply, but when I later discovered the best Ring recordings of the 50s and 60s (Bhm, Krau, Knappertsbusch especially) I realized the shortcomings of what I had been used to. McIntyres Wotan is of the noble type, ideal for Das Rheingold, but ill-equipped to reveal the complexities we see in Die Walkre let alone the world weary bitterness of the Wanderer in Siegfried. His voice is soft, sometimes underpowered and never less than dignified, but he doesnt capture Wotan in his fullness (on record for me only Hermann Uhde, Hans Hotter and later John Tomlinson do that). Manfred Jung would be welcomed today as a savior among heldentenoren, but sadly the microphones reveal his less than heroic tone which must qualify a gallant effort. He gives much pleasure, but cannot get to the places Siegfried Jerusalem let alone Wolfgang Windgassen could. Jerusalem by the way gives a cameo here as Froh which is very effective. Dame Gwyneth alas is the biggest problem for me, a wildly unpredictable voice spreading at the top and wobbling at the bottom. As a teenager I was astonished by her thinking that her singing of the love duets and then the immolation was extraordinary, but when I heard Birgit Nilsson, Astrid Varnay and Martha Mdl do it I realized what I had been missing. One thing does remain with me about Dame Gwyneth and that is the way she sings Ruhe, ruhe, der got [Rest now o god] early in her immolation scene. That send shivers up my spine in a way that no other singer even has or probably ever will!

A mandatory Ring for all Wagnerians then, its a legendary production well worth paying close attention. Chreaus directing is outstanding in every way. Musically its not as great, but then I don't think its as bad as some have said, and certainly on DVD only the Kupfer/Barenboim Bayreuth Ring betters it. Finally I should mention that the aspect ratio is 4:3 as this comes from the days before wide screen. The images have been cleared up by remastering but ghosting is still inevitable in scenes where light and dark are contrasted in extremes. There are no problems with the sound which is full, bright and relays that amazing Bayreuth glow.

8056809,4,B00092ZAO0,"Donald the Big Mac is great, Heinz Zednik is obviously a genius, the Rhein-nymphs and lesser gods are all fine.  The only real flaw in the cast is Fritz Hubner as Fafner  (although Freija while buxom is not pretty).  But the ones I really watch it over and over again for are Helmut Pampusch as Mime, young Matti Salminen as Fasolt (one of his best performances available, rivalling his Hagen under Levine), and most of all Hermann Becht as Alberich.  The latter acts uniquely well, sings with power, and sounds incredibly ugly.  His body-language as he puts the curse on the ring is really something; he looks (and sounds) like someone who has just had an extremity hacked off or been stabbed through the eye--surprised and disoriented, trying to figure out how to interpret the pain, whether to change position or stay still.  His whole performance gets the pathetic-but-menacing thing very well--the only comparable portrayal of this kind of character I can think of right now is Byron James as Leon the replicant in BLADE RUNNER.  Even as he's gauging Harrison Ford's eyes out with his fingers, you feel sorry for him because he's so ugly.  OK, also Robert DiNiro as Lewis in JACKIE BROWN.

Other very good acting includes Anna Reynolds' whole performance as Fricka and Loge's and Wotan's expressions of disgust as Mime and the crowd of silent Nibelungs cluster around them, pawing and grabbing their clothes.

Sure the ""industrial revolution"" sets and costumes were controversial but they're tame compared to some of the goofery we see these days.  The only problem I have with it is that the giants' costumes are silly--the singers stand on platforms carried around by people underneath.  The giants are supposed to lumber, lurching from leg to leg.  It might have been ok if the director had made them walk more slowly.",1228780800,2,1826,4.8705501618122975
8056810,5,B00092ZAO0,"I've seen the Met version and EuroArts version, too, and while all three of these DVDs offer a different view, this is the one I actually sit down and watch again and again.  It's also the one on my mp3.

If you've been inundated with the popular culture versions and other parodies of Wagner's ring, as most mature US viewers have been, this production will reset all your expectations and anticipations from the Bugs Bunny and Anna Russell flavor to the Adult/Growed Up kind.  All the cliches that trigger the satires are gone.

The music is unsurpassed in the others.  The Met version seems to me to have too many scenes where the orchestra intrudes on the pacing of the voices; this version just has both overwhelming you at the proper moments, with no seam between the two that even makes you notice instrument and voice are not being used together to tell the story.

The production on stage has human 'gods', without fake armor or other such silly appurtenances.  The Rhinemaidens are obviously Sirens and not some silly sprites on a Sponge-Bob Square-Pants set.  Valhalla is an imposing structure with both 'classical' decoration and commercial concrete structures visible.

The lack of tinny flash is reflected in the earth tones and subdues lighting.  No over-elaboration, just what is needed.

No fairy story pretense, just the facts. A Hamlet in music instead of a Disney Narnia musical.",1228003200,6,1399,4.885593220338983

8056812,5,B00092ZAO0,"I feel kind of strange writing this review.  I have already reviewed the CD of this version of ""Das Rheingold.""
However, the DVD adds an additional element--the visual.  As noted in my review of the CD, this is a very fine version of this opera in terms of the quality of the cast, the singing, and the orchestra.  The DVD adds to the mix the visual element of Patrice Chereau's production.  A few comments about some of the things to note:

The beginning is nice, as the camera moves up the road toward the Bayreuth Theater, where the performance is to take place.

The Giants are well done and, indeed, loom over the gods.  This adds a nice element that the CD, of course, could not capture.

The descent of Wotan and Loge to Nibelheim is nicely done.

The hydroelectric dam at the beginning, where the Rhinemaidens care for the gold, does not convince me at all.  However, the liner notes discuss this briefly but ably.  Each viewer will have to decide if this works.

 The magnificent music, ""The Entrance of the Gods into Valhalla,"" rings out and the visual depiction is interestingly done.

In terms of the players, the one who stands out for me is Heinz Zednik as Loge.  The clever god is critical to retrieving the stolen Rhinegold, taken by the dwarf Alberich (who outwitted the Rhinemaidens).  His appearance is compelling, his voice works well, and his ironic perspective sets him off from the other gods.

So, in the end, this is a fine depiction of Chereau's vision.  It allows the viewer to evaluate this version of the ""Ring.""",1176508800,3,1541,4.602941176470588
8056813,5,B00092ZAO0,"tThis is the first complete Ring I ever saw, and I remember that it bowled me over.  I was completely captivated then, and I remain captivated today.  I'm aware of the growing number of handsome productions of this Opera and others of the Ring, but this is the most comprehensive, in my mind, and the most effective whether or not one cares for the costuming or the sets.  After all, in producing any opera the production staff makes choices about well, drag, and how much of it the singer/actors will stagger about with on stage.  Costume is a secondary consideration, like decors.  Let's face it, a too elaborate costume can smother characterization.  I've seen the portfolio of the original designs for the first production, and they were indeed amazing, and would be equally amazing and beautiful today, if anybody cared to mount the opera that way.  But, having grown up in a generation that hooted and slighted what little we knew of German and certainly Wagnerian opera -- reacting to film clips of Melchior and Flagstadt -- I can appreciate the choice made here by Boulez-Chereau and Wagner.

Originally, people grew up with and were accustomed to the sight of well-fed and sometiems beared singers in stage armor waving their arms before painted canvas scenery, while standing on paper-mache mountain tops.  The technology of Theatre was far simpler then.  World War II changed all that, and probably because the Wagners and Germany at large, faced a wall of hatred and resentment, as well as the palpable slur of anti-semitism, the original visual concept was radically altered.  Immediately fter the war the characters were dressed in simple, almost architectural robes and nearly naked sets were flooded with dramatic, colored lighting.  The Helen Traubel - Astrid Varnay years.  Everything abstract.  Nothing historical.  Nothing to offend anybody.  (Hopefully the Wagners stored all the original sets and costumes somewhere; we'd all enjoy to see them again.)  And then, when the time came to stage the Ring afresh, they gave it to the present team.  Their artistic decision was radical; it was rather a neo-socialist concept: they decided to concentrate on the meaning of the music/drama, not the pageantry, intending to make it comprehensible to the widest number of people world-over.  It was a revolutionary concept, and they succeeded in spite of initial outrage.

In Boulez, Bayreuth found one of the world's best conductors with excellent credentials in Romantic and Modern German music.  His one remarkable trait is that he is able to remove himself from the music, and to offer to the public, music as the composer might have first experienced it; music as thought.  No podium glamor boy, Bulez shared that characteristic with Fritz Reiner, who was also able to remove all traces of the effort to produce the music expertly, and to present the sound with unexpected spontaneity and freshness.  The score of The Ring is so formidable, so daunting -- it is after all, one great operatic masterpiece -- that it is a testament to Boulez' intellectual and artistic grasp that he is able to capture and present the totality of the enterprise with orchestral balance and color; without any straining for effect or any vulgarity.  The entire production, the direction, the singers and stage effects, all elements rest securely on Boulez' firm orchestral control.

The show begins, as Anna Russel exclaimed and my libretto says, IN the Rhine River.  IN IT!  Rather than resort as Wagner did, to fat sopranos in mermaid outfits being wheeled about on gurneys, pretending to swim behind a green scrim, Chereau chose to focus on the meaning of the river itself. It is, and has been for centuries, a great commercial waterway, originating in Switzerland and proceeding north through Germany, to form that delta land that is now Holland, and then to empty into the North Sea.  Transport=Commerce=Power.

Instantly, as the curtain rises, we are confronted with the spillway of what looks like a hydro-electric dam. Night.  There's a thin metal catwalk above this construction, and a woman in a long sparkling dress like an evening gown appears.  She stretches and begins to sing.  She is the first of the three Rhine Maidens, and it is to these eminently atractive females that Alberecht, the first male on stage, is drawn.  In the original he's described as a Gnome.  This production strips that conceit away and presents him as a man of the people; a rather crudely dressed individual; a drifter, a casual working man, a poor and lonely man, and not a very attractive one.  But he is a man who is attracted to pretty, flirting women.  And the show beneath Wagner's original metaphor becomes something we've all seen in big cities; lonely, unskilled men trying to mate with wanton women unded the bridges, aqueducts and train tressels of commercial big-city reality.  It's love among the homeless.

This is one of the most effective scenes in RHINEGOLD, not only because it is well sung by all four participants, and acted well too, but because of the exceptional acting of Hermann Becht.  What a peformance, noble in its pathos!  Anyway, the sluts tease Alberecht unmecifully, humiliate and torment him, but won't have him.  The reason?  They do give him a glimpse of the Rhine's gold -- money is gold and a girl's got to work -- and it's meaning sticks in his mind.  He's gold-struck.  They can't stop him from stealing it.

next, dawn.  Now, we meet the Family; Wotan, Sky god, his wife, Goddess Frica, and their two companions -- bully boys of Wotan's -- Donner (Lightening) and Froh (Thunder.)  In the original they're all sleeping in the grass like vagrants in a public park, until Frica wakes, rises and looks about.  On the other side of the valley she sees something that disturbs and amazes her.  In this production Frica, acted by Hanna Schwartz, wears a 19th century dress, and hair-style, and looks not unlike any high-class lady of he period, but reminds one of Cosima Wagner.  It's a wonderful portrayal, all violet cologne, and one by one after Wogan wakes, the actors assume their roles and fall into an ensemble so convincing, one cannot help but focus on their situation and wonder how they're going to deal with it.  We almost forget they're singing, the acting's that good.  Donald McIntye is flawless; a brilliant characterization.  It reminds you, if you need it, how good they all are.  Some say he looks like Wagner.  Maybe.  But you are forced to keep your eyes on Martin Egel.  He's incredible: a lesson on how to keep your character important even when you don't have many lines.

What Fricka's looking at is a kind of castle that appears to have grown up overnight in god-time.  Wotan says he dreampt it into existence, and is delighted to see it.  The trouble is, he doesn't know how to pay for it.  Fricka is happy too because she says that now he has a proper home, Wotan won't go tomcatting around the world anymore.  The trouble is, Wotan's promised to pay for the labor of the Giants by giving them Fricka's sister Fria, goddess of youth and beauty.  (Beautiful Carmen Reppel plays the role here, in a dress that has to be seen.  And she can sing as good as she looks.)  She runs onstage screaming bloody murder because she can't stand the Giants.  Then the giants appear in wonderful costumes, like Medieval festival figures.  Big basso voices.  Great singing, all 'round, and by now you're so used to the 19th century convention of dress, and architectural detail, you've accepted it and are caught in the story.  The costuming has actually helped us to focus the motivations of the characters.

Fed up, the Giants take Fria away with them and, strangely, one is affected in spite of oneself.  The visuals are incredible.  But, the Gods begin to age; they weaken.  With his last gasp, Wotan calls for his handler, his point man, the ultimate schyster, Loge; Fire.  Frica thinks him declassee -- he's not a god, after all, only an elemental force -- but intelligence is his primary attribute, and after some sly reasoning, Loge comes up with a solution.  Now, somebody might think this is Loge's opera because Heinz Zednik in this role surpasses all expectations.  Is he the best actor of them all?  He sings like a dream, but his acting is a wonder; so detailed.  Hypnotic.  He tells Wotan to go to the Nibelungens deep in the earth, and steal the gold Alberecht stole from the Rhine Maidens.  And they go.

In the scenic vernacular down there proves to be down a mine.  The miners are the Niebelungen dwarves; stunted and scurring about like moles in goggles and helmets.  The adventure is something like an English Hammer Films horror show, but with Loge's help, Wotan bamboozles Alberecht, captures him, takes the gold and steals the ring of power from him.  He relinquishes it with a terrible curse, but what else can he do?  Alberecht is the hero here, not Wotan.

When Wotan and Loge return to the surface of the earth -- which looks like the patio of an industrial park -- they pile up the gold.  The Giants return Fria, but quarrel with Wotan about her, and money and everything else.  Eventually they get all the gold and even the ring Wotan stole.  Wotan is as angry in his way as Alberecht was in his.  But, fighting about details, one of the giants, Fafner, kills Fasolt.  But hey, says Loge!  You've got Walhalla.  Top of the line.  You have got to see Zednik the hunchback, dancing about in Fria's veil: the highest camp; the most sordid comedy.  He is their facilitator and they all hate him, as do we, because he does not pretend, but speaks truthfully.  However,  all ends well as all must that's based on lying, swindling, theft and murder, and as Egel opens his golden mouth to summon the clouds, they arrive and Wotan drags his godhead off, hands linked, over a rainbow bridge, to inhabit as grandiose a Post-Modern schloss as Wagner in his time, could have imagined.  And that's it.

If your libretto is like mine, the english translation of the text is so literal you'd think German was a language for apes.  Terrible.  A great disservice.  You'll either have to make your own translation or find a good paraphrase, because once you do, you'll find that the language is as easy as English to understand.  German is similiar enough that you'll actually come to think you're hearing the show in English, after a while.  The director has worked with the actors so well that the differences vanish.  You can understand the story simply by watchng it and depending on the orchestral schore.  It's clear as crystal. And this is just the beginning; the prelude!

One last note: watch Hanna Schwartz carefully.  Her Fricka is so life-like; on the surface all graciousness and elegance, but underneath a scheming, manipulative canine.  (Remember Susan Hayward?) Schwartz has learned to a good degree, that skill some German singers have of being able to sing without looking as though they were.  Schwartzkopf had it to perfection.  I saw her last Marchelin at the Met, and she sang it as though she were merely having a chat.  The sound was there.  That wonderful voice was there, but no facial distortion.  The body was held in check by her technique.  Now, everybody can't do that, but this production shows fairly well, how it should be done; and though there are many good german-singing performers, and a few now as good as those in this cast of twenty years ago, at this high professional level, what's to quarrel about?  For a viewer new to the Wagnerian canon, this presentation is an ideal way to experience the entirety of the drama.  It familiarizes one easily with the characters, and makes subsequent viewings of this material familiar and more accessible.  You will enjoy other productions more because of this one.",1171756800,18,11789,4.8069651741293535
8056814,5,B00092ZAO0,"When I think about what the best classical music's production is, I surely choose this one. I mean, of course, all of the four titles of ""Der Ring Des Nibelungen."" A few years ago, I got them packaged into one box. Why can't we get it now? This ""Ring"" should be sold as a box set because this is truly ""Art"" production which is created by the great artists, Boulez, Chereau, and Orchester Der Bayreuther Festspiele. What a crystal clear sound and what an intellectual direction it is! Although Manfred Jung(Siegfried) is a miscast in this great production, it becomes a ""considerable"" concept magically. A great art is always like that. I highly recommend this one as one of the box set.",1104105600,3,687,4.639344262295082
8056815,5,B00092ZAO0,"The staging is amusing. In fact, I was slightly shocked at the beginning where the depths of the Rhine is represented by a hydro-electric dam and those Rhine-maidens become ""call-girls"". Yet, in some strange way, the production works. And it grows on you with each successive viewing.
The direction of Patrice Chereau is fluent. Indeed, it's so fluent that one feels that the 2.5 hour work lasts only for slightly more than an hour. Maybe it's because Chereau's clever direction (and Brian Large's wonderful video direction) made viewers focus on the dramatic strengths of this opera. Or maybe the staging is so full of interesting (and dramatically valid) strokes that one is totally engrossed by the viewing experience. The performances of the singers are fine, too.
Despite initial reservations, I must say I like it a lot now.",1042329600,8,830,5.021739130434782
8056816,4,B00092ZAO0,"This is the famous production of the ring cycle that was first produced in the 1970's and booed of stage. The reason was that instead of it being set in around 400AD as intended by Wager it is played in 19th Century gear with Industrial age sets. The production was performed again in 1980 and filmed without an audience. This is the production that we see on this DVD.
The first thing which must be said is that the sound quality is excellent. The film production is also good and does not have the problem that some opera DVD's have of being transferred from VHS to DVD.
The general critical response to this version of the ring cycle has been posative with most of the barbs going to the singing of the role of Siegfried, something of no relevance to this DVD.
The fist DVD of this production I saw was that of Gotterdammerung which was a bit of a shock. Brunnhilde was played by someone far to old (although it was the first woman Siegried saw, he probably wasn't that choosy) and the chorus dressed in French working men's costumes was a shock.
However by this DVD somehow you forget it and if the opening scene is a large hydro dam instead of the Rhine and the Rhinemadens are dressed as prostitutes you don't seem to notice as much. the Gotterdammerung is a reasonably static opera. Probably as the first hour drags into the fourth you have a lot of time to look at people dressed as bank clerks and you have problems suspending disbelief. With this production, its all happeing with Gods and Giants striding the stage and people descending into the underworld the action keeps up. For that reason one forgets that Wotan is wearing a smoking jacket and that the trick about the Rhinemaidens was that they were maidens.
Anyway this retailed where I come from cheaply and it was great value. The quality and timber of the orchestral playing is superb. The signing good and the, I suppose you call it acting okay.",1030320000,10,1917,4.511494252873563
