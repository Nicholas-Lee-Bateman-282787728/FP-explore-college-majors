6314184,1,B00J2ACIV8,overrated.  the parents are LIKE EVERY SITCOM PARENT EVER.  Mother is hilarious but rest is blah.,1411603200,,97,5.0
6314185,5,B00J2ACIV8,"I absolutely love The Millers!  At first, I thought the character of Carol, the militant ""Smother"", who bellows and bosses her subjects... err, family around, would get on my nerves.  However, I adore what Martindale has developed for this character. The ENTIRE cast is amazing and gel into a quite believable family. I must say, my favorite character is Tom (Beau Bridges), the sweet, absent-minded father, who is more wise (at times - lol) than anyone gives him credit. ---  I think the story line is quite unique, in that both mom and son are navigating their way through divorce.  Son, desperately wanting to be independent from mother; mother needing to be even closer to son and both finding it difficult to eventually break those binding ties. --  Simply love it and recommend this series.-- Note:  The product description is incorrect.  This is a 3-disc set, with 23 episodes.  Thanks.",1411084800,14,893,4.906666666666666

6314187,3,B00J2ACIV8,"When it comes to sitcoms, dysfunction seems to be the norm these days, and there's a good bit of dysfunction for The Millers, who should not be confused with the characters in feature film&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/We-re-the-Millers/dp/B00BEIYN3M/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">We're the Millers</a>.

When Tom Miller (Beau Bridges) and his wife Carol (Margo Martindale,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Americans/dp/B00ECGHVHI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Americans</a>), the parents of TV reporter Nathan Miller (Will Arnett,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Arrested-Development/dp/B0002PYS7Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Arrested Development</a>) unexpectedly discover that their son has secretly been divorced, it triggers the dissolution of their marriage of over four decades.  In the wake of this catastrophic event, matters become more complicated when Tom goes to live with his daughter Debbie (Jayma Mays,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Paul-Blart-Mall-Cop/dp/B001VLFE6W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Paul Blart: Mall Cop</a>), and her husband Adam (Nelson Franklin), while Carol moves in with her loving son Nathan.

The dynamic of the Miller family is complicated, and involves many themes, but the action is usually driven by Nathan, Tom, or Carol.  Tom is technologically and practically challenged, and often gets himself into awkward predicaments.  Uncomfortably close to her son, Carol is used to controlling her family members, and always being ""right"".  The upheaval in the family has hit Nathan hard, but he still hopes to advance in his career.  Nathan's best friend is his cameraman Ray (J.B. Smoove), who is usually quick to offer advice.

The Millers had respectable Nielsen numbers, and the writing seems to improve as the season progresses.  The cast does a good job with the material, but like many modern comedies, the program won't appeal to everyone.  Will Arnett capably carries much of the load, and Beau Bridges plays a doofus pretty well, but the deal breaker may come down to Margo Martindale, who gives an inspired performance as Carol.  If you do not find this character amusing, you probably won't be a major fan of the series.",1409702400,4,2340,6.6644736842105265

6314211,4,B00J2ACIV8,"Good show. Not sure why Greg Garcia's shows don't stick around longer. Great cast, funny, and definitely worth the $10 or so I spent on it. If you liked Raising Hope then this should be right up your alley.",1456531200,2,206,4.3076923076923075

6314213,5,B00J2ACIV8,"Season 1 of the Millers was funny, entertaining, and let's face it, we all have someone in our family that is on this show.  Too bad the addition of ""just jack"" to season 2 killed this series.",1447200000,,192,4.1891891891891895

6314215,4,B00J2ACIV8,This sitcom is amusing to me and I enjoyed this first season - had not seen it in it's original run on TV. The characters are endearing even in their oddities because somehow they acknowledge their peculiarities and shortcomings and love each other / stick together as a family anyway. It's a lighthearted way to spend 20 minutes while I'm working out on my stair climber.,1428710400,4,372,4.651515151515151

6314217,5,B00J2ACIV8,I love the show and thought it was going to last for a few seasons. I wish I had known the series was canceled mid season prior to buying season 1. I would not have purchased it if I had known it was axed. So sad that the replacement of the Miller's is doing much worse in ratings. The network made a mistake and really should air the remaining episodes. This is so said to axe them prematurely.,1420502400,12,395,4.076923076923077
