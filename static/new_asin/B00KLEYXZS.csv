6433316,3,B00KLEYXZS,I normally love things from this genre.  And I absolutely love James Garner in anything.  But this one took a long time to get started.  It was good once it finally kicked in to the story.  Worth watching through to the end.,1408924800,7,224,4.261904761904762
6433317,4,B00KLEYXZS,good movie,1407024000,,10,4.5
6433318,5,B00KLEYXZS,James Garner is Mark Twain telling a story of his younger days.  A different actor plays the younger Mark Twain.,1481155200,,112,4.6

6433320,5,B00KLEYXZS,"This is a wonderful movie, with gentle humor that is family-friendly....One scene, in particular (Semi-spoiler alert!) is where he runs into a man waiting for his wife to return home- I will not say any more about it- but this one vignette gives me hope for this silly race of ours.  Garner is great, as always.  Worth every penny!",1454630400,,331,4.593220338983051

6433323,5,B00KLEYXZS,My husband and I really enjoyed watching this DVD.  Always appreciative of Samuel Clemens we learned much about his life before he became a noted author and added to understanding the man behind the pen.,1424044800,4,203,4.8
6433324,4,B00KLEYXZS,"My husband and I enjoyed this hilarious tale.  We wondered at the first night and second night labels, but we did take two evenings to watch it.",1419638400,2,144,4.333333333333333
6433325,4,B00KLEYXZS,"Movie is awesome, watched once as a kid over 10 years ago, never found a downloadable version online, not even in iTunes. However this does not have a subtitle which is what I really need to have.

8659688,5,B00KLEYXZS,"Sometimes it's hard to see a rating, not this time, I couldn't wait to click on the 5.  This movie sneaks up on you, not knowing what to think.  But we who persevered found joy, knowledge (if you didn't already have it), and plain old reality of life.  The truths in this movie are just that.  I'm 70 now, and I do have some wisdom, so I've been told.  This is a great movie, great acting, great story about a great story teller.  How can you not love it.",1532131200,,455,4.056179775280899
8659689,5,B00KLEYXZS,"Watching this after losing much Under-appreciated actor and Man, Mr. James ""Jim"" Garner, who both Julie Andrews and Sally Fields said was the best actor they Ever Kissed, I can only say he pulled off the Great Mark Twain/Samuel Clemens Wonderfully!  I had to read the book after the movie and truthfully can't say which I enjoyed more.....sadly Mr. Garner never got the acclaim of Mark Twain....but he nailed him in this great movie for gee  FAMILIES!",1528588800,,451,4.8441558441558445

8659693,5,B00KLEYXZS,Classic Mark Twain tall-tale humor. I recommend it for parents to share with childre/adolescents because it gives good advice to youngsters without lecturing them--even though the setting is a lecture to young women.,1491609600,,216,5.575757575757576
