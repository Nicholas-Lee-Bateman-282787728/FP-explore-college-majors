8242484,5,B0011UMC2W,"I was reminded of this great show today when I read that Jonathan Winters died. He was such a genius! I know he was a big influence on Bonnie Hunt.  She is so wonderful and this show was one of the best TV shows in a long time. It's too bad that TV shows these days pander to the lowest common denominator. Life With Bonnie was funny, had a great cast, great writing and great guest stars. I miss Bonnie on TV. Loved her talk show, too.",1365724800,2,436,4.011494252873563
8242485,5,B0011UMC2W,"I see my family is not alone with our good memories of this great show. Fortunately I do have tapes of a few of our favorites and they've been played many times. Remember the Christmas play? It doesn't get any better. As previously stated it is sad to see what crude and degrading shows are released while these heartwarming performances sit on a shelf somewhere. Last, a sincere thanks to Bonnie and the cast for their inspirational work.",1349740800,4,439,4.641025641025641
8242486,5,B0011UMC2W,"This show is such a gem. I love the fresh, fun and improvisational style. Hope springs eternal that it will someday be available on dvd!",1338681600,4,136,4.48
8242487,5,B0011UMC2W,I loved this show so much. I never missed it. I can't wait until it's available on video! Hurry up already!,1335225600,8,107,4.142857142857143
8242488,5,B0011UMC2W,"We loved this when it was on television and even videotaped about six episodes.  We gave those tapes away, assuming that the show would be available on DVD someday.  Boy, are we sorry that we did that!  The actors on the show had such great chemistry and Bonnie Hunt was adorable and funny.  No comedy since then has appealed to our family as much as that one did.  Still crossing our fingers that it will be released in DVD format in the near future.",1328659200,9,451,4.321428571428571
8242489,5,B0011UMC2W,"The Bonnie Hunt Show was & remains one of my all time favorite TV shows.  Unlike many sitcoms of today, this show had the most creative writing & was extremely funny without being crude or having to rely on sexual jokes.  When I see what's been put out on  DVD I can not understand why this gem has been ignored.  Please, powers that be, put the funniest show ever on DVD.",1280188800,14,372,4.197183098591549
8242490,5,B0011UMC2W,My entire family watched this great show. I really hope it gets released soon! Bonnie Hunt is such a joy to watch!,1258675200,16,114,4.2272727272727275
8242491,4,B0011UMC2W,The episode starring David Duchovny as Johnny Volcano (first appearance) is one of the funniest scenes I've ever seen on television. I hope ABC puts this on DVD soon. It's too bad the network didn't give the series a chance to succeed. It seems few know what to do with Bonnie Hunt's obvious talent. Personally I wish she'd just produce her own work. She's great.,1242950400,15,363,4.6
8242492,5,B0011UMC2W,"Life With Bonnie was the best comedy on TV in decades. Bonnie Hunt stars as a talk show host on a local channel. She is surrounded by one of the funniest casts ever, including David Alan Grier and Marianne Muellerveile.  Some of the comic greats guest star: Jonathan Winters, Robin Williams, the Smothers Brothers, Martin Mull and Carl Reiner.  Bonnie is witty, and can banter with the best of them. The show was also family-friendly with scenes at home that included saying grace at the table: and when did that become such a gutsy thing to do? Sure wish the series was on DVD.",1238371200,22,578,4.548076923076923
8242493,5,B0011UMC2W,"Bonnie Hunt is one of funniest comedians in movies and on TV.  In this ABC TV series, the whole cast was outstanding.  Every episode was a gem including guest appearances by Jonathan Winters and Jack LaLanne.",1212019200,25,208,4.75
