5092405,5,B007K7IC92,Saw this at  a friends house and was surprised that they were even worse than I thought.  They are evil.  This video shows how they got their money and what they are doing to ruin the working class.,1338768000,6,198,4.157894736842105
5092406,4,B007K7IC92,"The documentary is what it is for the kind of budget that Greenwald could put into it. It is not comprehensive, it is short and to the point: in America we are breeding something that the Founding Fathers were terrified of: an oligarchy. The immense amount of wealth that the Koch brothers have means that they can pretty much throw their weight around in a way the average citizen could not even dream of, to fight against any issue from taxes on the wealthy, to environmental issues, to education to anything. Knowledge is important and Greenwald and his crew do a job of giving you the very peak of the ice berg.

I was a bit disappointed that he did not go about discussing just how the immense wealth that the Koch brothers have plays such an important role in shaping policy. There have been a lot of research on this topic over the last few years, including from Jacob Hacker et al. (The Winner Take All Economy) and Thomas Ferguson (The Golden Rule: The Investment Theory of Political Parties), it would have been nice to see a more indepth look at how the immense wealth that the Koch brothers have plays a role in politics.

Instead the documentary does too much to appeal to emotions, which emotional music and editing. I would have preferred more depth. The Koch brothers are the despicable sons of a despicable John Birch Society founder, they are at the extreme of the right-wing, but this documentary does not does not do that. I would have liked it if Greenwald had gotten together with more filmmakers and perhaps pumped out something far stronger.

Still, it is very valuable for what it is. I held screenings of it in my neighborhood and handed out literature, articles and talks so as to glue the name ""Koch"" into the heads of people.",1337299200,49,1754,4.579617834394904

5092430,5,B007K7IC92,"The book ""Dark Money: The Hidden History of the Billionaires Behind the Rise of the Radical Right"" by Jane Mayer is fantastic. This book is well researched, full of citations, and gives a clear evidenced-based picture of two sociopaths (Charles and David Koch) who seek to destroy our country for their own financial gain.

The one ""problem"" with Mayer's Dark Money is that it is a very long book that is virtually impenetrable to all but the most dedicated reader. My wife was a bit intimidated by the book so I thought this movie would be like ""cliff notes"" for the book. Boy was I wrong!

Of all of the Koch brothers' wrongs, this documentary highlights the least interesting and the least harmful of them. These ""wrongs"" are presented as if they are crimes against humanity: apparently, the very nature of being rich is wrong according to this documentary.

I am fairly confident that the director and producers of this movie were funded by the Koch brothers in order to discredit their opposition. This movie is so boring, devoid of any evidence-based criticism of the Koch brothers, and cheesy that the only purpose it serves is to make the Koch brothers' opposition look like crackpots.

I was hoping this movie would be a summary of Dark Money, but what I watched was a train-wreck that wasted my time (and my wife's time) and wouldn't convince a Bernie Sanders supporter that the Koch brothers were anything more than rich billionaires trying to grow their business.",1484265600,3,1475,4.7952755905511815

Good companion reading is ""The Sociopath Next Door"", which will explain the Brothers Koch's seemingly arbitrary will to destroy everything that works in our society just for the fun of it--because they can.
I can't help thinking, though it was not the movie's intent, that it makes an excellent case for inheritance taxes (Paris Hilton is another icon of the cause), which would at least have trimmed some of their fun.
All in all, I didn't learn much that I didn't know already, but the movie did help focus my disgust with these two.

5092495,4,B007K7IC92,"The Koch brothers seem to be getting more and more press all the time and it's all bad. After viewing this documentary, it's easy to see why.

Here's the scoop. This documentary takes a close look at the Koch brothers and their dealings in both business and political (is there a real difference here?) circles. It spends some time with their dad who spent a lot of time in Russia getting them started in oil. It shows him as being a real racist and all around nasty individual, a trait it appears he passed on to his two sons. It then goes on to show them and how they go about contributing to the campaigns of various politicians to make certain things go their way. I get that. It's not peculiar to them but it's still no less heinous, particularly when you see a 97 count, 250 million dollar fine against them get reduced to a 1 count, 20 million dollar fine by none other than George W. Bush. Has there ever been a more corrupt President than he? But this isn't the worst of it. When they helped stack the deck in a school board election in South Carolina their vileness really shined through. This election had nothing to do with them and their empire. It was the mere fact that you had a successful, integrated school system that they couldn't deal with, so they tried to destroy it. They did for about two years until the locals woke up and discovered they had a great thing going and voted out the Koch minion.

This is a very good documentary. The only thing I objected to strongly was the attempt to shame them for their wealth. I harbor no malice toward someone because thy're rich. I do harbor malice when they use that wealth to perform unspeakable acts against the citizenry of this country and it's environment through the manipulation of the Democratic process.

This is a must see for anyone who wants a bird's eye view of our country sliding into the pockets of those who can buy our elections.",1375920000,,1913,4.4289772727272725

Then I became curious and discovered a lot of what is shown in the documentary. This documentary brings Awareness and no matter what your station in life is, it is relevant to you and your children and your grandchildren that you may some day have.  Watch it and do not judge, just watch it and remember what you are seeing the next time you read about Congress and Social Security, about Medicare, about the economy, about Americans in the middle class.....",1367712000,,760,4.460431654676259

They suggested that I watch this documentary so I could share in their hate and anger of other human citizens, while not being a hating type I did agree to watch this film. In the end it was nothing more than rank emotionalism designed to denigrate two individuals while spewing out toxic messages that misinformed more than informed. If you have a modicum of intelligence and keep up on modern political discourse you will see right through the films distortions, here are just some of the examples I encountered:

The Film put in bold letters the following

""Koch Echo Chamber Distortion #1: Need to raise the retirement age""

Hmmmm  is this a distortion or is this reality, let's see who agrees with this

Bill Clinton's social security task force
President Obama
Social Security Administration
CBO

Ironically the institutes that the mockumentary claimed were influenced by the Koch brothers referenced the above sources too. It's pretty common knowledge that raising the retirement age, which most socialized European nations have done, is a credible solution.

""Koch Echo Chamber Distortion #2: Social Security is Going Bankrupt""

Hmmmm, I'm confused since President Clinton agreed that social security was headed for trouble and needed a fix and President Obama's treasure security says the exact same thing, but don't take my word for it read the dire warning he wrote:

""The U.S. government makes approximately 80 million separate payments per month. These include payments for Social Security; Supplemental Security Income; Medicare; Medicaid; . . .  If Congress does not act to extend borrowing authority, all of these payments would be at risk. This would impose severe economic hardship on millions of individuals and businesses across the country.""
(economicpolicyjournal.com/2013/01/geithner-letter-us-will-breach-debt)

The sad part is Bernie Sanders lies to the American people and says that SS has a 2.7 Trillion dollar surplus, but that a surplus on paper only. That money has been raided and spent so all we have is IOU's and every time we tap into it we have to do more ""quantitative easing"" which everyone agrees will cause inflation to spike. Spiking inflation hurts the poor and those on fixed income (social security) the most.

Think about this logically people, if SS goes away private businesses will have to start paying out pensions to keep employees, this is expensive and the way any business person can save money is to transfer these liabilities to the government. Social security is good for business that is why the Koch brothers have a vested interest in propping upthe system that is unarguably headed right off a cliff.

BTW here is liberal Chris Matthews on MSNBC saying that people live longer and we need to do something like raise the retirement age, plus he calls it a ponzi scheme but that's just a bonus.  (youtube.com/watch?v=4N-kIJVFcO4)

AND the far-left's favorite Nobel winning economist Paul Krugman calls it a Ponzi scheme too and that the ""GAME WIL SOON BE OVER"":

""Social Security is structured from the point of view of the recipients as if it were an ordinary retirement plan: what you get out depends on what you put in. So it does not look like a redistributionist scheme. In practice it has turned out to be strongly redistributionist, but only because of its Ponzi game aspect, in which each generation takes more out than it put in. Well, the Ponzi game will soon be over, thanks to changing demographics, so that the typical recipient henceforth will get only about as much as he or she put in (and today's young may well get less than they put in)."" - Paul Krugman, ""What Consensus?"", December 1996/ January 1997 issue of Boston Review

""Koch Echo Chamber Distortion #3: We should privatize social security.""

Actually this is false. They are actually backing up President Clinton's social security plan of allowing the citizen to personalized 33% of their accounts IF one wants to. Now let's not blame Bill Clinton for coming up with this common sense proposal which would help shore up SS, it was first talked about by JFK.  BTW Bernie sanders lied once again saying you could lose all of your money - FALSE at most you could invest 50% in 6-10 highly regulated funds. Over a lifetime of investing your money your average return, including the last stock market crash would be about 8%, compare that with 0.4% that you earn on SS money now.

One last thing, Bernie Sanders says the Koch's brothers plan is to do away with social security but the Social Security Administration said that personalized accounts would stabilize social security and insure returns for at least another 80 foreseeable years. Seems to me that Bernie Sanders idea of doing nothing, which all agree will result in disaster, is actually the one who is dooming social security.

_______________

OK on to the next topic. Nobody doubts that our public schools are failing. They are controlled by unions where bad teachers (there are only a few) will not be fired. The curriculum is ineffective, no surprise it was written by the unions and the teachers absolutely hate any idea of being held accountable to the tax payers. The Koch brothers like millions of others rational American citizens think we can do better and they are pushing forward a plan that helps all students out, especially those in the worst economic areas like inner cities.

Once again the biggest irony is the mockumentary supports the failing status quo and ignores what has been shown to be help our children out. In this case it's nothing more than pandering to powerful and rich unions in a pure politically ploy that pisses down the throats of our children all to keep power and influence alive and well.

______________

On to the next issue, the mockumentary showed that the Koch brothers helped a school district out that had reinstated forced busing, something that the supreme court had ruled on as being unconstitutional. The overall polling for the area showed that it was an unpopular programming causing children to get up at 4 or 5 Am and not arrive back home until after 6 or 7PM.  In this case we actually saw how a representative democracy worked. The arrogant board members that dictated to students and parents alike that they must follow their pet social engineering experiment were voted off the school board by large margins as so they should have been.

We know that the forced bussing was unpopular with the majority but did it HELP the students? NOPE, in reality it seems to have hurt the economically disadvantaged students.

Scores have declined for economically disadvantaged students""

It is unarguable that America's universities are dens of extreme liberalism. There is little if any chance of getting any point of view expect that of extreme left from these institutions. I will give the left their adieu's on this one, they were much  more forward thinking in taking over the media and school systems to inculcate and propagandize the people with only their narrative and talking points. In this case the Koch brothers are seeking to add some diversity to America's university, to allow them to model after the enlightenment ideals of a free flow exchange of ideas. I also understand why the left is so outraged that the Koch brothers want a equal and fair hearing of all ideas and that is because most Americans usually agree with center right/slightly libertarian principals when they are presented in a fair manner.

I thought it was quite hilarious to watch the far-left wing professor trying to scare people by telling them that students might be ""exposed"" to different thinking and possibly be challenged to think rather than told what to think. In their words, being exposed to different ideas is a ""major threat to the country and our way of life.""  I just cannot marvel at how little they think of their students or how little they think of the ideology that they are promoting that cannot be scrutinized one iota.

____________________

The mockumentary kept telling us how powerful the Koch brothers were through their foundations that give money and fund their beliefs. If you are uneducated or too lazy to do the research you would think that the Koch brothers must be in the top 5 of influential (read money/grants awarded) organizations. But guess what their biggest foundation is # 38 on the list. There are 28 left-wing groups that give more money to influence politics and 9 conservative groups that give more money to influence politics.

Now let's add up the left-wing foundations that have more money than the Koch brothers

LEFT-WING groups 104,168 Million
VS
Koch Brothers 207 Million

That means the left-wing attack groups have 500 MILLION for every 1 MILLION Koch Dollars.

Who's really is  buying and influencing politicians and Americans with deceptive advertising????

_______________________

Free and Fair elections  - who would possibly be against this???? Do you want people voting 2,3,4,5 times? What about voting in two or three different states? What about Mickey mouse voting (just FYI 412 Mickey Mouse's voted in Ohio in 2008). Most of the first world nations enforce free and fair elections, you have to have ID, or show up with a registered voting card to vote, but not in America and one group continually fights this. To me it's flabbergasting that we used to send Jimmy Carter to oversee elections where they cut down on voter fraud but back in America he doesn't give a $#%$ about it.

This is the way I see it, just because you chosen political group might be leading the way in procuring fraudulent votes do you not see the other side catching up and surpassing you one day. Let's do the sensible thing and get behind legal voting rights and stop the abuse of the system.

__________________

The big money of the Koch brothers vs environmental groups. This segment was laughable because it shows that the mockumentary maker either is completely ignorant about reality or is praying on the ignorance of its viewers through emotional pleas. Here are the FACTS:

32 - Total number of right-wing environmental groups
552 - Total number of left-wing environmental groups.

38.24 MILLION - Total net assets of right wing environmental groups.
9.31 BILLION  - Total net assets of left wing environmental groups.

FACT: Left wing environmental groups have OVER 243 times the resources available to them when compared to right-wing/Koch brothers groups.

FACT: Left-Wing environmental groups SPEND over 460 times more on their causes than do the right wing/Koch brothers groups.

The massive amount of spending done by the left-wing groups buy and influence votes to a much greater extent than the Koch brothers could ever imagine. And who is winning from the decision made by President Obama and the massive left-wing money machine - CHINA is getting more jobs and more cheaper energy to compete even more fiercely against us. Thanks Mr. Left winger for destroying American jobs and stepping on the backs of the middle class.

The sad part is that after the films has spewed out so much BS and propaganda most people would turn off anything that the maker has to say so one of his last points, the cancer rates by the Georgia Pacific plant is easily missed but may be worth investigating.

BOTTOM LINE:

The biggest incongruity of the film is that it supports the astro-turf OWS movement that was started by seed money of far left-wing billionaires and wall street barons. It paid protestors and used people's ignorance and emotional angst to protest against the little guys while supporting the agenda of the people they said they are against. If one is worried about big money and influence OWS has done a masterful job of hiding the wizards with a crowd of misinformed people protecting the wizards lairs.

The movie ends with the statement - ""we are not going to fooled anymore"" - is anyone else drowning in the irony??",1366675200,9,12258,4.9784419402253794

The segment about the pollution in Crossett, Arkansas I experienced personally almost 40 years ago. I was working with a contract archaeologist firm conducting surveys and excavations along the Ouachita River in a National Wildlife Refuge, reporting to the Corps of Engineers...in an area some 12 miles or so west of Crossett. We camped along the river where a dam was being built. During our time there over several seasons, thousands of trees were cut in preparation for the inundation and it was common to see trucks hauling trees to the paper mill in Crossett, which is part of the Georgia Pacific chemical plant complex. We ventured into Crossett only to buy supplies or maybe the occasional meal at a diner for a break from camp food. As we approached town the smell would become stronger; the worst smell I have ever experienced, which made it difficult to enjoy a meal and we left as soon as possible. I remember my throat and eyes burning, stomach upset to the point of wanting to vomit, and we wondered how people could live and work there knowing it must be unhealthy. Locals would say ""Oh, that's from the papermill"" as if it was nothing, and laugh at us for being so sensitive. As the doc indicates, when GP employs a fourth or half of the population, complaining is discouraged. Now these years later, many of them have died from lung and other cancers. This doc made me aware of something I didn't know about at the time, that a network of creeks and streams carry toxic waste away from the plant through residential areas directly toward the wildlife refuge that is now a lake where people swim and fish. That certainly can't be healthy. I'm not sure if the Koch's are deliberately evil, but they certainly do enjoy throwing their many billions around with little regard to other people, and they seem to have no problem paying millions of dollars in fines for violating environmental protection laws...pocket change. I wonder if they ever visit Crossett to see how paper is made.",1525305600,,2272,4.813299232736573
