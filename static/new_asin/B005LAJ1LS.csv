4795831,5,B005LAJ1LS,"This show kept up its high quality in season three with the same trio of characters being at the center of the action.  This is a show I would recommend seeing in order but it isn't absolutely necessary.  However, it helps because you see the initial friendship between Jonathan and George expand to include the comic book creator.  Jonathan's detective duties have increased and he gets himself into as much trouble as ever with this unlicensed occupation.  Time and again the other two are called to come save him from some job where he's about to die.

For anyone unfamiliar with the show, Jason Schwartzman plays Jonathan.  He is a novelist but also increasingly an unlicensed private investigator who picks up his clients off Craig's list.  His friend who is his age is Ray (Zach Galifianakos)  He is a comic book writer and often dresses in his character's caped costume.  He has a loyal band of fans and followers.  Jonathan's other friend is George, a former magazine editor who now is a restaurant owner.  George is played by Ted Danson and is absolutely hilarious.

In a way this is like a very sophisticated, uptown version of the Three Stooges.  The three of them have so many women problems that they may as well remain single and hang around one another.  In this series,  Jonathan discovers he has a biological father and tracks this person down.  Only problem is that he ends up becoming enamored of his half sister while doing so without realizing they are related.

One hilarious episode involved Jonathan's taking George's daughter to a stake out.  The action is so wild at this stake out with the people they are watching that George gets mad at Jonathan for corrupting his daughter and they end up in therapy together.  I also loved it when George and Ray both became Don Quixote for awhile singing the Impossible Dream from Man of La Mancha as they run to their daughter and ex girlfriend.

A host of other famous actors come and go in this series.  They don't seem to use anyone who isn't top flight.  For example: Kristin Wiig, Oliver Platt, Olympia Dukais, Bebe Neurvirth and so forth. It is a who's who of the sitcom tv world.

Everyone plays their parts with perfection. Ted Danson is in his element, comedy suits him well. Jason Shwartzman plays the lead and he turns out to be quite the ladies man, with out even trying. Zach Galifianakis is pretty much himself, I think. Doesn't everyone have a friend like that? This is really a splendid little comedy thing that never got it's due.",1497139200,2,549,4.288461538461538

I was not expecting to watch it like I have been, but some scenes can be pretty funny. Being a bit bias though I mainly watched it for Ted Danson... yes I've seen most of cheers and in this show he is just as funny. Some parts can be a bit lame or you may see it coming, but hey it's only for a moment and those moments do not over take the greatness of this show. It's a show you can throw on and laugh while you eat. :)",1491955200,,555,3.8347826086956522

4806582,1,B005LAJ1LS,"I definitely appreciate a quirky, challenging, retro type of humor but for me --Bored to Death goes significantly over the line, past humor's healthy irreverence which we use for fun, perspective, to lighten up and laugh at ourselves and for satire to shake us out of fixated perspectives to make us see differently.  I see no intelligent quirky satire in this and I see pretty much just playing in the dirt for the sake of being dirty -- like little boys who say ""titty"" or ""poop"" over and over because they need to explore the taboo.  This is normal for 10 year olds.  But with this show the vehicles of humor lack wit and are just plain mean or gross.  I'm surprised and disappointed that enough people like this show that it went to a third season.  I haven't seen seasons 1 and 2.  Maybe it's just the 3rd season that's gotten tired and taken a dive.",1454457600,,855,4.414012738853503

While the regurgitation of actors in Hollywood, is often boring, in this case it works well. It is obvious that all characters are not there because they need the money since they forgot to pay their Federal income taxes, but rather because they actually enjoy playing the parts.
It is for mature families, it is not for young kids, too many sexual innuendos.
The story line is different each week, although the main idea stays the same: an unlicensed writer, works as a private detective, surrounded by a few people with issues.

He is someone who I want to like,  just there is always a darker side to his humour,  and that's what I liked about Bored to Death as a whole, it's characters are all very positive,  even in this own suffering and bad decisions.  They remain very civil,  polite,  refined even. I wouldnt think it would matter so much until I saw it demonstrated,  but it's what creates the charm of the show I believe.  Ted Damson is a riot,  his best role ever. Jason Shwartzman is the glue of the show and does a wonderful job.  His humour is very intelligent,  there's are many little references and allusions that are extremely fun to catch.

I think it's like a personal thing, that I tie the humor with my more pretentious past partners. Of course it's also a lot of male, d!#%, f*&%, high, drunk humor, that I used to find really endearing of my hairier brethren. With a precious twist, like a zing of lemon, of the characters wanting to have a conscience and they're on a sort of moral search.

I hate all the movies he has been in, and probably would hate him in person if I ever met him. His characters are extremely vulgar with no redeeming characteristics. And he is that in this, a demented cartoonist who prevails in drawing his private parts.

But the rest of the cast makes up for this pervert.  I haven't like Ted Danson in anything since Cheers, but this series, he character is hilarious.

Like others, I was sorry it was cancelled.  It was clever, and very funny. I don't do drugs, and never got into that scene, but Danson and the others being stoned during most of their antics, was just over the top.",1434672000,5,728,4.362962962962963

4810440,5,B005LAJ1LS,"This is just a sweet sweet series. I am so mad at myself that I ignored it when it was on HBO (helped by the fact that I didn't have HBO when it was on), but watching the past 3 seasons of ""Bored to Death"" restores my faith in comedy that can be both good-hearted, raunchy and edgy all at the same time. Realistically, unless you watch Seasons 1 & 2, you will be lost coming into Season 3 - and you probably won't feel the comedy in many of the relationship changes that were set up in earlier seasons. But - big BUT here - the payoffs in Season 3 compensate enormously. Although I've read that there was always an intended Season 4, cut short by HBO cancelling the show, nevertheless the final episode is appropriately ""conclusive"" to be satisfying. Good news: there is a ""finale"" movie in the works: the writer Jonathan Ames, has said that the only thing holding it up is finishing the screenplay, ""and right now I'm on page 94 of 120 pages.""

Stories portray the lives of three men: writer/detective, magazine director, and comic - centering around the main character's side detective work.

There's times when I think his ""George"" is played as the best-case scenario for an aging pothead lothario, and other times when he somehow exceeds the arcane mold in which he's supposed to fit. I love this character.

Also, I'm not into stoner comedy. This show transcends pot as a plot device and somehow makes it a common casual preference among the main characters. Instead of completely romanticizing it, it's just part of the tableau. I hope this catches on in the realm of comedy.",1406332800,,590,4.9

4812972,2,B005LAJ1LS,"I had previously watched and LOVED the first two seasons of Bored to Death.  They were original, classy, funny, and the characters were relatable and believable.  I had, however never watched the third & final season, and while a friend told me it was pretty bad compared to the first two seasons I bought it anyway since I wanted to own the entire series and did not believe it could be that bad.  I was wrong.

The LACK of the final two things I liked about the first two seasons are what killed the series, in my opinion, in the third season.  The show went from yes, always being quirky, but where the characters seemed REAL, to a much more slapstick-y goofy, weird and even gross (in a skin-crawly way) feel.  It was like the characters in this season were written differently from how they were in the first two seasons.  Ames moves from a normal place into some weird DC-comics-type watchtower apartment.  Rather than rooting for & liking Galifiniakis and Danson's characters as you do in the first two seasons, you pity them and see them both more as losers.  Rather than being a neurotic, bored writer wanting to expand his horizons and cope with his loss of companionship like in the first two seasons, it becomes where Schwartzman is much more scripted Private Eye trying to be a like a quippy stooge, like someone in a Naked Gun-type movie.  It is hard to explain exactly, but the season just fell right off the cliff after two great ones, and thus led to the show being axed.

Bottom-line: Sad deal this season was so bad - or DIFFERENT, one could certainly say, compared to the first two, but I frankly wish I had NOT bought this season after having bought the first two seasons - I feel like it was a waste of money.  It is such a strange season, that while I would be happy to have most people in my life borrow the first two seasons, I would be embarrassed to let them borrow this one.",1367625600,20,1902,4.418338108882521

4813065,4,B005LAJ1LS,"As anyone knows who read my reviews of Seasons One and Two, I have been a cheerleader for ""Bored to Death"" ever since it came out.  I adored Season One, thought Season Two was brilliant, and Season Three...well...

I hate to be a wet-blanket.  I so deeply loved this series, and had such high hopes for Season 3 after waiting an INTERMINABLY long time for it, that perhaps disappointment was the only reasonable end to this love affair.  But I simply could not get into Season 3.  Ray (Zak Galifianakos) got on my nerves.  What used to seem to be hilarious quirkiness and insecurity just began to seem like annoyingly exaggerated immaturity.  Jonathan (Jason Schwartzman) was as adorable as ever, but seemed to be lost in his own cuteness.  There were some clever scenes -- the one in which he discovers his paramour was really his sister comes to mind here -- but more often, Jonathan's considerable charm seemed wasted.  The only character that didn't disappoint was George (Ted Danson).  When they brought in Mary Steenbergen (his real wife) as his love interest, both were hilarious in their respective roles.

But for me, this season never quite took off.  Jonathan Ames seems to have given up on it too.  I don't know whether he simply ran out of ideas, or if Ted Danson getting the CSI role put the hex on it, but for some reason, it ended.  As all good (and great) things do.

Alas.  Maybe the brilliant Ames will come up with some other wonderfully witty, esoteric,  quirky series.  I hope so, because I will miss him.",1328486400,14,1527,4.613382899628252

8477978,5,B005LAJ1LS,"Surprisingly great show! The acting is wonderful and the story doesn't get old. Of course struggling artist in New York City has been done before, but this is a new twist. I wish there were more seasons, one of the few shows that keeps its wit each episode. It's not laugh out loud funny but very humorous. Entertaining characters and story.",1512259200,,341,4.60655737704918
