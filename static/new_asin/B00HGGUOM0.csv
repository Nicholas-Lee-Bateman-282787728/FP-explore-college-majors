6162268,5,B00HGGUOM0,"I was surprised to accidentally find this excellent 3-D movie from 1953.
Twilight is a company that is out doing the big guys with their limited editions on Bluray.
The Black & White film is sharp and clear and far better then it's original 3-D release with those annoying Red & Blue glasses.
I hope to see more 1950's Bluray 3-D movie releases soon.",1399075200,,350,4.484375
6162269,3,B00HGGUOM0,"This is a fun 3D movie from the 50s, but the 3D is somewhat misaligned in the ultra close shots (a cigar coming out at you, etc).",1398384000,,129,3.814814814814815
6162270,4,B00HGGUOM0,"Some in this category are ""cardbordish"" (3D people will understand this term.); this was not.
The story-line/plot was good, as well.",1397088000,,132,5.333333333333333
6162271,5,B00HGGUOM0,"In spite of minor flaws that are probably in the original negative or print, Man in the Dark is a compelling B movie, tightly conceived, well-written and beautifully photographed. The 3D is uniformly excellent, easy to view, and (with some notable exceptions) not overly in-your-face. The digital transfer is super clean and pinpoint sharp. There's some price scalping on this one, so buy it directly from the screenarchives website.",1395964800,3,433,5.2898550724637685
6162272,4,B00HGGUOM0,"Never heard of this film before but ordered it blind because there is so little vintage 3-D available (Creature from The Black Lagoon, House of Wax, and Dial M for Murder are pretty much it).. and wanted to check it out for myself.

This is a mediocre little crime thriller that really has some fun with the 3-D gimmick... I guess they wanted to make sure audiences felt they got their money's worth experiencing this ""new"" format. So you'll get a cigar in your eye, a bird flying right towards your face (plus a great rubber spider moment during a dream sequence), cars crashing through the screen, fists punching you in the face, etc. The finale is a shootout between gangsters climbing and running along a roller coaster track while the coaster itself is in motion and there is a real sense of depth, along with some great stunt work.

In short, if you're a fan of the 3-D format, particularly classic 3-D from the 50s, you definitely should add this to your collection. It does drag a little in parts, and without the 3-D gimmick would not be nearly as entertaining.

The print really is gorgeous to look at it... I dare say it rivals the quality of Creature of the Black Lagoon. Hopefully we can expect more vintage 3-D to come to market.",1394928000,3,1243,4.515555555555555
6162273,4,B00HGGUOM0,"The first 3D film from a major studio to hit theatres - if only by two days - Man in the Dark is pretty much a forgotten footnote to the brief 50s craze for the format, but while you can't make any great claims for it as a movie, it's a lot more entertaining than its obscurity implies because, rather than in spite of, its tendency to constantly throw things at the audience, even including at one point leading man Edmond O'Brien. If Bwana Devil was advertised with the immortal tagline `A lion in your lap,' then Man in the Dark has a whole department store full of them to choose from - `A scalpel in your cranium! A bullet in your brain! A cigar in your eye! A flowerpot in your face! A budgie in your barnet!' It even embraces the sideshow aspect of the format by setting its nightmare sequence and finale in an amusement park and rollercoaster, with a wondrously silly shootout on a crack-the-whip ride.

A loose remake of 1936's The Man Who Lived Twice, the plot's pretty simple: O'Brien's crook volunteers for experimental surgery that will remove his criminal tendencies only to find it removing his memory as well - something which his aggrieved former partners in crime don't believe when they kidnap him to find out where he's hidden the loot from their last job (quite why he'd volunteer for the operation rather than serve out his sentence with $130,000 waiting for him when he gets out is never explained). Being a film noir, the answer lies in a dream scene, but not before moll Audrey Totter has decided she prefers the new and improved O'Brien and Ted De Corsia's thug with a dirty mug and sidekick Nick Dennis, whose striped Zoot suit and bowtie ensemble is a thing of wonder even in 2D, decide they don't. Not to mention there's also Dan Riss' ruthless insurance man on his heels adding to his woes...

It's not top tier noir but there's hardboiled dialogue a plenty: ""This guy understands only one language. I speak it."" ""You'd better get me when my back is turned, because I'm going to take at least one of you with me,"" ""Where's that meal ticket of yours? I want to punch it full of holes,"" ""What do you do when you hate yourself?"" ""I usually take it out on my wife"" and a reprise of Detour's memorable ""money's just paper with germs on it."" Yet it's the 3D that is the most distinguishing feature, and that holds up surprisingly well on Twilight Time's Blu-ray edition (which also includes a 2D version), turning what could have been a run of the mill programmer into something rather more enjoyable as the writers scramble for new opportunities to throw something at you. The disc also includes an isolated score track, booklet and the original trailer (billing the film as `The' Man in the Dark), introduced by O'Brien earnestly shooing the viewers away from the top-secret set.",1391990400,9,2805,4.57455268389662
6162274,3,B00HGGUOM0,"Man in the Dark 3D was technically the first film by a major studio to be released in 3D. Although the Warner Brothers/Vincent Price chiller House of Wax is often touted as the first release in the amazing third dimension, Man in the Dark 3D was actually released two days prior. Filmed over just 11 days and rushed into post production, the film was a modest success and ushered in the 3D craze, which would flame out and rise from the ashes like a phoenix over and over again.

Man in the Dark 3D is a rather rote film noir that, while entertaining enough, doesn't really provide movie lovers with much originality. The film's most memorable character is the 3D effects that are so obviously rigged they practically scream ""LOOK AT ME!"" The title credits are shot out at the audience, cigars are dangled in front of the lens, and cars go crashing through storefronts and practically thrust through the cameras and into the audience's lap. Obviously the filmmakers did this to emphasize the then-newly minted technology, but over fifty years later the effects actually take the viewer out of the story.

As for the rest of Man in the Dark 3D, this is pretty standard film noir stuff. The movie was made on the cheap and directed by Lew Landers, who helmed such Bela Lugosi shockers as Universal's The Raven and Return of the Vampire (which was about a vampire, but not that vampire). Lander's touch doesn't provide the film with much originality or a unique vision; it lumbers from one scene to the next and feels longer than it actually is (clocking in at just over an hour).

Technically this is a remake of the 1936 Ralph Bellamy film The Man Who Lived Twice, written by George Brickner (1954's Cry Vengeance) and Jack Leonard (1952's The Narrow Margin). Brickner and Leonard's screenplay revels in classic noir clichs; vertical angled shots, thick black and white shadows, tough talking cops, and double crossing hoods. However, it sure is fun to see the city of Los Angeles in the 1950s, a feeling that has long escaped most current Hollywood movies.

The dialogue consists of stilted proclamations like, ""I have no past! It's all just a blank wall!"" Casablanca this ain't. Edmund O'Brien makes for a decent, if somewhat unremarkable leading man. He spends most of the film looking worried and sweaty, always trying to stay one step ahead of his adversaries (even when he's not sure why). The rest of the cast is just sort of along for the ride, including doe eyed Audrey Totter as our hero's girlfriend and The Naked City's Ted de Corsia as one of the gritty hoods. Man in the Dark 3D doesn't feature any really big name talent, so we're left with actors who fill the roles adequately, and little else. Even though this isn't a very good movie, it does have flashes of inspiration. One dream sequence by the lead hero involves a weird bumper car chase with angry cops at a local carnival. A rooftop chase lends the film a few tense moments as well. These are the moments when Man in the Dark 3D comes alive and is lifted beyond mediocrity.

Man in the Dark 3D is presented in 1.33:1 full frame in 1080p high definition in both 2D and 3D. The black and white image certainly sparkles and looks very crisp and very clean. For a low budget film that's been seemingly forgotten over time (it's never been released on VHS or DVD), the quality of this picture looks great. There are a few defects to be found from time to time, but it's nothing that will interfere with one's enjoyment of the movie. The 3D effects look sufficiently decent for a movie of this age, but the gimmick wears thin quickly. The soundtrack is presented in DTS-HD Master Audio 1.0 Mono in English. The audio mix is clear and crisp with dialogue, music, and effects work easily distinguishable. While the soundtrack is in great shape, it's also not very exciting and 100% front heavy.

Bonus features included an isolated score track, a theatrical trailer, and an informational booklet.

6162275,5,B00HGGUOM0,"I can't really add more to Mike's excellent review listed above.  The transfer is amazing and if enough of us buy these it will bode well for futre 3-D releases.  You will not regret adding this one to your collection.  Twilight is only issuing 3,000 copies of this film so it will be gone quickly.  Twilight is doing a terrific job!",1391558400,,333,4.409836065573771
6162276,5,B00HGGUOM0,"This classic 3d film is well worth your time.  It was done during the film noir era. Crime movies that often featured a antihero. who may or not redeem him or herself.  This was actually the second major 3d release as well.  Twilight time has put this one out. And if it sells well enough they will put out the other Columbia pictures 1950's 3d films.  This one however is quite a good experience to watch.  the remastering is fantastic here. It has no ghosting. ANd warner brothers needs to do as well on their releases from this era.  In 1080p the film looks better than it ever has before as well. This film really utilized the native 3d it was shot in to tell the story. Which is something that many 3d films don't do today.  Which is cool. but it's also a good thing when the 3d is actually part of storyline. For instance we have dream sequences and the famous roller coaster scenes. Edmund O brien does a great job in this film , he was always a very good actor and could handle any role thrown at him. Audrey trotter is the mobster moll that is in love with him.  And she's good too. The rest of the cast is mainly the three thugs who want the missing robbery money and they are as gangster as you would want too. The man here gets a surgery in which he loses his memory but his partners in crime want his loot from their robbery., even if he can't remember it!. Which is why ' he's a man in the dark.  This film is excellent on many levels , the film techniques and directing are outstanding. This one has atmostphere to spare and the print is SPOTLESS.  I love all the old 1950's  3d films but this one was really a mindbender in some ways.  YOu will regret not getting this If you love old crime movies and especially if you collect 3d films.  Get it now.  and go on to twilight times facebook page and request that they release the other columbia  1950's 3d tiltes as well.  ""miss Sadie thompson' , 'fort ti' , 'the stranger wore a gun' and others!  But this was the best of the studies 3d films probably. It just shines on 3d blu ray.  Don't miss it.  As it will be gone soon.",1391385600,19,2089,4.164588528678304
6162277,5,B00HGGUOM0,If you are a fan of the original 3D craze of the early 1950's  this is a must- the opening 'brain operation' scene is worth the price of the disc- scapels and forceps right in your face!,1422144000,,186,4.027027027027027

6162279,3,B00HGGUOM0,Well worth the extra $ for a limited release feature. The 3D was used quite well and truly aided the story with few gimmicks. Own this piece of cinematic history. Expand your 3D collection with this title. You won't be displeased.,1419292800,,230,4.634146341463414
6162280,1,B00HGGUOM0,DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!! The reason I bought this and paid the outrageous price is this was the first 3D movie I saw as a 12 year old. This movie sold me on 3D when I was  kid. The 3D effects in this movie are almost non existent. NONE OF THE 3D EFFECTS POP OFF THE SCREEN! I MEAN NOTHING POPS OFF THE SCREEN. If this was the way 3D was presented in 1953 nobody would have gone to these films.,1419206400,2,392,3.8395061728395063

6162283,4,B00HGGUOM0,"Ok 3D movie, but I can think of many more from the era that I'd rather see get released to Blu Ray. Also, 50 bucks Is WAY, WAY too much to pay for this! It's not worth over 25. However, they only released about 3 thousand copies, so It will become hard to find and very pricey! With all that said I am glad to add this to my 3D collection. It's a neat little forgotten movie with a cop/crime plot. The 3D Is very good, and the restoration Is VERY GOOD as well! Hope they release all the 3D movies from this time period.",1412640000,2,519,3.9523809523809526

6162285,2,B00HGGUOM0,"If the film had been in 2D without the obvious 3D shots, I would have upped my rating to 3 Stars. Man in the Dark 3D is a prime example of what doomed the process in the 50s. Instead of 3D adding to the film, it detracted...big time.

Instead of taking the time to frame and focus in order to get the most out of 3D, the filmmakers seemed to have had absolutely no regard for how the finished product would look in 3D.

Someone thought it would be a good idea to put things as close to the lens as possible. So close, in fact, that the camera couldn't even focus, and unintentionally created a double image each time it was attempted. A double image that has nothing to do with 3D and everything to do with sloppiness. It's like when you poke your finger on the bridge of your nose. You see two fingers and they're blurry. This is what the cinematographer thought would be a good 3D effect...several times!

Without the ""3D"", Man in the Dark would have been a decent 50s Film Noir thriller. Fortunately there's an option to select the 2D version. UNfortunately the blurry, double vision, in-your-face garbage is still there. There is nothing creative about the 3D effects in this movie. All it is is terrible cinematography.

If you want to see a real classic 3D film from the 50s, check out the 3D Blu-ray of Creature from the Black Lagoon. It's everything Man in the Dark isn't. Each 3D shot was meticulously planned for the best possible effect. No shots of things flying at the camera, so fast and so close it's impossible to follow and focus with your eyes, let alone the camera.

This film, and countless others like it, are the reason for the death of 3D in the 50s. Just for that alone, I think it's worth seeing.",1407196800,2,1721,4.382445141065831
6162286,5,B00HGGUOM0,great 3D movement to Blu-ray  Historical 3D movie that probably would have been left to die.  Glad this has been published.,1400025600,,123,4.809523809523809
8632649,5,B00HGGUOM0,"First saw this film at the Egyptian in L.A. during the World 3D Expo a few years back. Watched nearly every film at that expo, and this was my favorite. (Actually took a week off from work, got an all-access pass to see three vintage 3D films a day throughout the whole expo. Great experience!) Love the gritty black and white, mobster lingo and femme fatales of 50s noir (which you can blame for today's rating system). And in 3D! Beautiful, clear print with stunning 3D in this Twilight Time blu ray (viewed on LG OLED65E6P). The film suffers from a few scenes of elements extending too far, making it impossible to focus on an object, and the pivotal roller coaster scene is rear projection, not 3D ... but, what a great opportunity to see vintage 3D noir. Old 3D holds a particular fascination here because the 3D puts you right there in the 1950s. Inferno, Miss Sadie Thompson, Cease Fire, Dragonfly Squadron, The Stewardesses (70s), Man in the Dark, It Came From Outer Space, September Storm - can almost be seen as documentaries, transporting you back to the clothing, language and mindset of a different era. This is not Academy Award-winning filmmaking. It was never intended to be. It's hokey, sleazy (tame for today), mobster murder schlock, and I loved every minute of it. Don't agree? Keep it to yourself, ya filthy rat bastard - a buddy a mine got a pair a cement loafers in your size that'll have you singin' like a canary bird.",1524614400,,1443,4.618677042801556
8632650,4,B00HGGUOM0,"Fast moving suspense film with good 3D.  Several scenes, such as at the carnival, showed great depth of field.  There were a few flat scenes.  Perhaps the 3D was lost or never shot because of a camera problem.  However, these 2D scenes were very brief.  The image throughout the film was very sharp and the sound was excellent.  This may not be the best suspense film ever made but it is fun to watch and very entertaining.",1514246400,,423,4.428571428571429

8632653,5,B00HGGUOM0,I'll watching a 3-D movie in just 2-D right now...but Twilight Time made the film look so clear...it has the WOW! factor. The price was right and the seller was excellent. It was a great purchase!!!!,1448150400,,199,4.555555555555555
8632654,3,B00HGGUOM0,the movie is ok.  the 3d is good.  the story is average.,1437609600,,56,3.5833333333333335
8632655,5,B00HGGUOM0,"One of the few thrillers originally intended to be released in 3D, this movie sums up the joined assets of having been made by a respected studio (Columbia), showing good performances by thoroughly good actors - specially Edmond O'Brien who holds most of the film going on-, and raising an interesting if a bit constricted story filled with excitment, mistery and a thrilling action finale in a roller coaster. The first part, beginning with a brain surgical intervention on our leading man resulting in amnesia which will bring him so much trouble, could have been more developed since it offers an interesting contrast to his prior behaviour. The plot is good enough and its relatively sparse settings are counterparted by its technical achievements, dynamic chases and a treasure hunt. Ted de Corsia and his partners and Audrey Totter as a bewildered girlfriend add realism to the story.

The 3D effects are wisely combined with the plot. They include bullet shots, a frontal car crash, falls and many other tricks better not to be advanced. Here is where Lew Landers ability as a director is shown, as he does not let the movie to loose rythm.
But in spite of these various effects the film is equally interesting watched in the 2D version, which makes it a good noir movie.

The Twilight Time restoration is excellent with good image quality, and the much appreciated inclusion of the original (non-3D) trailer, which doesn't reveal anything about the picture but the secrecy under which such innovative productions were then made, intended to create expectation.

As for the 3D effect, when first watched on a 3D TV, though, it  was quite disappointing, because it was hardly noticeable. Nevertheless, after a meticulous search the right TV was found in one specific SONY HD model, and all at once the 3D magic came to life. You feel like you could grasp the objects on the Psychiatrist's desk, notice many small details in close-ups, and sense the depth of many scenes. I can only share my enthusiasm. Splendid !
Be aware that different models from the same brand may show strong differences in 3D effects, so don't give in. Wish I had found this information in some other review, it would have been very useful to have it beforehand.

A bit expensive, but worth it. Let's hope it sells good enough and encourages the producers to issue new titles (Bwana, Fort-Ti, and so on). Don't miss other less known 3D jewels as Inferno, Dragonfly Squadron or MGM's Kiss me Kate while we wait for more !",1429401600,2,2499,4.8158508158508155
8632656,1,B00HGGUOM0,Don't waste your money on this really cheaply made movie. I believe that they just threw it together to get in on the 3D craze of the early 50's.,1426636800,,145,4.0344827586206895

8632658,4,B00HGGUOM0,"Interesting to be reminded how unsophisticated we were in the 50s.
Lighting, art direction, photography, acting, directing all pretty lackluster
at best...sitandard use of rear screen projection seems so amateurish today even though iy was the standard technique for decades...note ... a glass of beer was 25 cents and unfiltered cigarettes were typical.
The picture quality is amazingly sharp and clear with little or no ghosting  and a nice sense of depth... There were a few fun ""comin at ya"" moments... maybe less than one would expect from this studios first  3D picture... The best was the probing surgical instruments during the brain surgery... the startled bird escaping ... gunshots aimed directly  into the.camera and a few others for u to discover .
The real missed opportunity for 3D was the carnival. .... the roller coaster ... The ""laughing lady fun house"" ... Ferris wheel .. and all that goes with a carnival...
Would be interesting to know total budget.. couldn't have been much!
All in all this is a welcome addition to my 3D collection..
