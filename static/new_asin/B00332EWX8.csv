8387793,1,B00332EWX8,Mediocre at best. This might be good for very young and very addle-brained children but it has little value for anyone else. The narration is ham handed and lacking any substance. I was extremely disappointed with this. The subject has so much potential and for it to be a rehash of NASA publicity footage and soundbites was a collossal letdown. There are so many GOOD science columnists. Is this gentleman the BEST you can find?  I felt like I was watching a VERY BAD Discover documentary.,1414281600,,490,4.6976744186046515
8387794,4,B00332EWX8,"This is truly a very good series (if short) about the discoveries made and the images from the Hubble Space Telescope. But while the DVD set is decent enough why have the producers not made a Blu-ray version available? This series was originally shown (and continues to be shown) on Oasis HD, a high-definition specialty television channel. If any material deserved high definition it is the spectacular images from Hubble. This would have been a five star rating if I had been reviewing the (currently non-existent) HD version.",1387411200,,528,5.011363636363637

8387796,5,B00332EWX8,"Many words come to mind when I watched this video:  stunning, mind boggling, humbling, incredible, fascinating, mind altering, life changing, staggering, shattering, and many more.  This series will change the way you see the universe and our own planet.  We should stop to realize that we are really not that important in terms of the universe as a whole.  We are smaller than a grain of sand -- cosmic sand, at that.  We care about things that are unimportant because our focus is far too small.  Once you step back and see the whole picture, through the lens of the Hubble Telescope, you start to understand where we really are in life... but this view is just a starting point.  Makes me wonder what we will be seeing 25 or so years from now.  At some point in the not so distant future the Hubble Telescope will seem primitive, but for now, its just stunning.  I cannot recommend this DVD series enough.",1343433600,,908,4.555555555555555
