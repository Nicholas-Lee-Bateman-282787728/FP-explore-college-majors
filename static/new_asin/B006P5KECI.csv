5012121,3,B006P5KECI,"El Bulli is where tradition went to die and (I guess a new one was born?) I'm not impressed by the so called cooking done here because the only cooking I saw was boiling something inside a plastic bag. It's all science and painstakingly precise preperation of weird and new foods. I can't taste a meal by looking at it but I'm sure it taste fantastic being this has been called the best ""restaurant"" in the world, I'm just confused as to what makes this restaurant so good. New cooking techniques are appreciated but like I stated before theres no actual cooking going on. it was interesting to see what the fuss was all about but I was disappointed by my expactation. This science lab has closed its doors but I honestly would have loved to try the food.",1341273600,,755,4.438848920863309
5012122,5,B006P5KECI,"This film shows a really interesting side of El Bulli which I haven't actually seen elsewhere: the off-season. The restaurant closes for half the year and the chefs retreat to the lab in Barcelona. The film shows the experimentation and the creative process. Overall, the film was very enjoyable.",1339372800,,296,5.061224489795919
5012123,5,B006P5KECI,"If you classify yourself as a foodie, you have got to see this movie. This is where food preparation is takes to almost a scientific level. I do not believe anyone else in the entire world has done this approach to food preparation.
Too bad if you never got to el Bulli, it closed in 2011. The brothers opened Tickets and 41degrees in Barcelona while the featured chefs opened Compartir north of Barcelona, with Faran's blessings to continue along the same path, and not too far from the el Bulli original site.",1336348800,6,511,4.565217391304348

5012125,4,B006P5KECI,"If you are a real foodie, chef, and someone involved in the business of food you might like this. If you are expecting a Gordon Ramsey or Bourdain style documentary then you will be disappointed. You will not learn how to cook any of what legendary chef, Ferran Adri, makes at the now retired El Bulli restaurant. The documentary starts with the closing of his restaurant for the season then turns into a dialogue between chefs on the creativity and science of the creation of new dishes. You are like a fly on the wall. Jose Andres operates arguably the most advanced kitchen in the world, very interesting to see how everything comes together, but this film won't be for everyone",1331856000,10,681,4.636363636363637
5012126,5,B006P5KECI,"A good documentary on how a world class restaurant was run, showing behind the scenes perspective on his operation. If you are interested in chefs and cooking this delivers good insight.",1388707200,,186,5.032258064516129
5012127,3,B006P5KECI,"I am a serious foodie and I read a lot of food literature, and try to see a lot of food movies. One terrific foodie movie is about the Japanese sushi chef Jiro. This documentary on El Bulli - to be honest, was boring because it really had no narrative structure. I don't know much about the chef, his story, the story of the restaurant. In fact, that is what this really lacks - a good story. It shows what goes on in the kitchen, some interesting stuff about how they think about their menus or what they try to do to remain creative. I guess the idea is to pretend that we are there like a fly on the wall, but unlike the fly, I need some focus. Not worth watching in my opinion, but I have always wanted to eat at the restaurant just for the experience but I believe it is now closed.  Instead see ""Kings of Pastry"", ""Jiro"" or the documentary on the Bocus D'or (so interesting).",1375833600,,881,4.152046783625731
5012128,5,B006P5KECI,I enjoyed seeing all the people I had just read about.  I don't want to eat the crazy food but I love watching them create it.,1375228800,,126,3.8461538461538463
5012129,5,B006P5KECI,This dvd offers amazing insight into the creative process of Ferran Adria. I was first introduced to his work through watching Anthony Bourdain's No Reservations episode in season 7. This video is not so much about recipes as it is about ideology and technique. Very inspiring and makes you want to create. This illustrates the difference between a cook and an innovative forward thinking chef. Uber respect for Ferran and his process!,1375142400,,435,5.055555555555555
5012130,3,B006P5KECI,It's a bit dry as some of the reviewers have mentioned.  I love how creative Mr. Ferran Adria and his team are but this a very technical look at the behind the scenes.  The Bourdain episode is definitely more entertaining.,1364774400,,222,4.525

it's what i was expecting, definitely cool!

5012132,5,B006P5KECI,"Love having a non-narrated view into both the lab and formerly world's greatest restaurant. To check out the approach, failures, process behind the myth was particularly fun and an education into this now gone pilgrimage site. Highly recommend for all those obsessed with gastronomic adventure, horizons, pleasure!",1357689600,2,314,5.702127659574468
5012133,5,B006P5KECI,They type of drive shown by the El Bulli team is truly inspirational.  Ferran Adria is a genius and continues to impress me with his transitions of creativity.  Even though the restaurant has been closed I am looking forward to elbulliFoundation to happen.,1352419200,2,256,4.930232558139535
5012134,3,B006P5KECI,"The movie is a great look into the creative process behind the El Bulli kitchen.  You don't see as much about the work of the stages like the ones referenced in The sorcerer's apprentice book, but you do get a glimpse into the laboratory as well as how that plays out in the development of recipes in the kitchen.
The movie looks more at the food than the people behind it and Adria, himself seems to have little or nothing to do with the development of the food except offering a critique.  One thing that was lacking was the trial and error of all the ideas as they are being formed, the beginning of the movie looks into that a little bit, but then it focuses more on the finished dishes and the operation of the restaurant.",1348185600,,727,4.299270072992701
5012135,3,B006P5KECI,"I really enjoyed Bourdain's documentary about El Bulli,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Decoding-Ferran-Adria-Hosted-by-Anthony-Bourdain/dp/0061157074/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Decoding Ferran Adria: Hosted by Anthony Bourdain</a>&nbsp;(and the episode of No Reservations with Ferran Adria), and in those you really got to see what cooking and eating at El Bulli was like. I also enjoyed Lisa Abend's book&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Sorcerer-s-Apprentices-A-Season-in-the-Kitchen-at-Ferran-Adri-s-elBulli/dp/B005GNJ1PQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Sorcerer's Apprentices: A Season in the Kitchen at Ferran Adri's elBulli</a>. This movie, however, was much less interesting to watch.

The movie is 1hr 50mins long, and all dialogue is in Catalan, Spanish, or French, with English subtitles. The first half of the movie is almost all video of Ferran's sous-chefs working in the lab. There is no narration at all, very little cooking, and it is somewhat tedious to watch. Yes, it is interesting to see what they do, but most of the time it is unclear exactly what they are doing and what ingredients they are using. Still, it is quite amazing how meticulous they are in the lab. The second half takes place in the restaurant, where we see them set up for the season. Again, it is usually not clear what exactly they are doing. You might see them making some cool looking dishes, but the viewer has no idea what they are. At one point we watch Ferran eat his own meal, but for the most part, we do not know what the dishes are or how they taste! We just see him make notes quietly. Pretty dull.

If you are really into El Bulli, this is worth watching for the behind-the-scenes look, but in the end it is just ok. Could have been great, with lots of narration and better editing.",1341705600,6,1867,5.712230215827338
8502592,3,B006P5KECI,"If you're a big fan of Ferran, this takes you inside the painstaking work at the taller in Barcelona and then inside the inner workings of elBulli. It's not nearly as interesting or entertaining as Decoding Ferran Adria (still the best video) or the No Reservations elBulli episode with Tony and Jose Andres. You see Ferran and the staff at work without the enthusiastic narrative that makes the others soar.",1474848000,,408,4.8428571428571425

8502600,1,B006P5KECI,"I was really excited to see this film. I am a foodie and have read about the famous and (fabled) El Bulli and the eccentric owner and chef Ferran Adria. I love the inner working of restaurants and all that jazz.

The first thing I noticed was that the music and the cinematography was off-putting. Very self-conscious, dramatic kind of stuff.... I know it was attempting to be arty, but it came across as annoying, too slow, and frankly, boring. It made me want to fast-forward.

The other thing is, I didn't see any earth-shattering ideas here. Yes, I realize he is the father of modern methods (such as using liquid nitrogen and encapsulating oils and sauces) but now that we have seen all this and more on Food Network - and more excitingly, mind you- it just came off as pretentious and... boring.

My favorite 2 parts are 1) Adria is dining on his Chef's creations-- a course after course affair-- he is gulping the food so fast it seems like he wouldn't be able to taste it! And a customer, I am assuming, passes by him and looks at him, starstruck, and Adria just goes on guzzling, completely ignoring the guy.
and
2) Adria ""creates"" a cocktail -- off the cuff it seems-- of Oil (yes OIL, as in Olive Oil) and plain water. He orders the waiter to bring it out to his table. The waiter almost seems incredulous, like You want me to serve these people OIL and WATER and pass it off as a cocktail? Hilarious.

My take is, this guy is basically a modern-day snake oil salesman passing off BS like Oil and Water cocktails and inedible stuff like ""pine needles"" to people who care about appearances and think they are being cool spending God Knows How Much on a meal. Good for them. Me, I'm sticking with food that actually tastes good. And movies that are Good. This one just isn't.",1391472000,,1784,4.429878048780488
