1234389,5,B00000JMP0,"Like many have said before, you should definitely buy this movie.  Its one of Donnie Yen's earlier movies (1989) so of course its not going to look as recent as any of his others ones that has come out, but that shouldn't deter you from watching this...I found that some of the best Donnie Yen movies were those made before Iron Monkey. ""In the line of duty iv"" is one of them.
  The plot is not original-basically its the good guys vs the bad guys with one or two twists in the movie.  Cynthia Khan and Donnie Yen both play cops who must seek out and protect a dock worker (the actor is Yuen Woo Ping's brother in real life)from the bad guys.  But those like myself watch this for the action scenes and there is definitely alot, in fact there is one almost every 10-15 min.  Many classify this as a girls with guns flick which is true since the real star is Cynthia Khan.  She can fight very well and is in some pretty good action scenes.  Donnie Yen gets a lot of screen time and his fights with movie foes Michael Woods and John Salvitti are the best.  He pretty much steals the show but the character he plays can be a little annoying and impulsive in the beginning.
  Yuen Woo Ping is both director and fight choreagrapher. That right there is a plus. Some say that this is the best in the ""In the Line of Duty"" series (pertaining to action) with no real relation to the others except for Cynthia Khan.  Unlike Iron Monkey, there is no ""wire-fu"", the actors do their own stunts and martial arts without the use of wires so really you could actually see how capable and amazing these actors are with their abilities.
  The dvd is actually pretty good when you consider the fact that the movie is over a decade old.  Both the sound and picture are pretty clear. The dvd is subtitled not englished dubbed-that might be a good or bad thing considering the preference of the viewer.
  Overall its a great movie and dvd to own and to add to any collection.  Any fan of Hong Kong Action, Yuen Woo Ping, Donnie Yen and Cynthia Khan would really enjoy this.",1022976000,14,2053,4.315926892950392
1234390,5,B00000JMP0,"Out of the 5 In The Line of Duty films, this one stands out by far the best. All you need to know is that Donnie Yen, one of my favorite fighters, is in this and he shows some of the best stuff I've ever seen. Story???...Donnie Yen and Cynthia Khan are on a team of first class police officers undercover on some drugdealer case. Their partner happened to take pictures of a drug deal with some major people, and he attempts to arrest them. He fails, tries to get away with the picture negatives, but gets shot, and an unfortunate dockworker is given the negatives to bring in to the police. Police officer dies and dockworker ends up losing negative. Now he's a suspect for the murder of the police officer and he's being chased by the dealers men for the negative. Donnie and Cynthia are to protect the suspect in this crazy cat and mouse chase, and the fact that there is a bad heel within the police force is no help either. The fighting is the brutal modern style that'll make you cringe. There are tons of great fights in this film, and very very little wirework thank goodness. This is Yuen Woo Ping choreography at its best. This is the first movie I've seen where there are so many great fighters on screen. There must've been 4-5 fighters in here that I really liked regardless of them being bad guys. Of course, Donnie Yen still steals the show with his awesome kicking and boxing abilities, but watching the fight scenes that were without him were awesome too. Cynthia Khan is a great fighter as well as the dockworker. There is yet another classic fight between Donnie Yen and Michael Woods that is breathtaking. This film is a total MUST-OWN. If you want great action every 5-10 minutes, this is a masterpiece for you. Don't get me wrong tho, there are some ""sentimental"" moments in this, and you'd start believin all these fighters really can act. In my opinion, this is Donnie Yen's second best film with Tiger Cage 2 being the first (a lot of the same actors are in this one too). As for the dvd, there are 2 versions out there. If you can play Region 2 PAL encoded dvds, then you must get the Hong Kong Legends version entitled simply In The Line of Duty. The remastered video and sound is unmatched, and completely uncut. There are some interesting extras as well like a Donnie Yen interview and biography. If you can't, then get the HK version that is sold everywhere online. Point is, you gotta have this if you're a martial arts or Donnie Yen fan. Other awesome Donnie Yen titles...Tiger Cage 2, Iron Monkey, Wing Chun (with Michelle Yeoh), and OUATIC 2 (with Jet Li)...Hope this was helpful, check my other HK reviews too!!!",1017964800,9,2647,4.4824016563147
1234391,5,B00000JMP0,"I had the pleasure of watching the In the Line of Duty series in Chinatown SF when they first appeared.  These DVDs capture the excitement of watching the first time.  ITLOD4 is my favorite of the series.  Non-stop action, Girls w/guns, Gun Fu, and Bad/Bad Guys are the staples of these films.  If you are new to HK films this is the place to start.",1003622400,,349,4.323076923076923
1234392,5,B00000JMP0,"AFTER HAVING READ ALL THE REVIEWS FROM OTHER KUNG-FU/ACTION MOVIE LOVERS, I MUST ADMIT THAT THEY WERE TOTALLY RIGHT.  I REALLY HAD MONEY WELL SPENT ON THIS FILM.  THOUGH THIS MOVIE WERE MADE IN THE LATE 1980S, BUT ITS FILM QUALITY ISN'T ANY LESS THAN MOVIES THAT ARE MADE TODAY.  EVERYTIME THAT DONNIE YEN AND YUEN WOO PING TEAMS UP IN THE SAME MOVIE, YOU'LL KNOW IT WILL BE A GREAT ONE.
  AS FOR THIS ONE, THERE MUST HAVE BEEN OVER 10 SPECTACULAR FIGHTS AND EACH ONE IS MORE BETTER THAN THE LAST ONE.  UNLIKE OTHER MARTIAL ARTS MOVIE TODAY, THIS ONE IS BOUND TO ITS NAME AS ONE OF THE BEST ACTION MOVIE OF ALL TIME.  EACH FIGHT SCENES AND MOVEMENTS IN THIS MOVIE ARE ESPECIALLY CLEAR AND CRISP.  YOU'LL CAN ACTUALLY SEE AND MADE YOU WANT TO IMITATE DONNIE AFTER THE SEEING THE MOVIE.  MAYBE IT IS JUST ME!!
  NEVERTHELESS, YOU WON'T REGRET SPENDING SOME MONEY ON THIS ONE.  PERSONALLY, I DON'T REALLY CARE ABOUT THE STORY LINES OF THE MOVIE, JUST AS LONG THERE ARE GREAT FIGHTING. THIS ONE HAS IT ALL SO YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED.  EVERYONE FIGHTS AT THEIR BEST IN THIS MOVIE.",995068800,6,1077,4.378787878787879
1234393,5,B00000JMP0,"The basic premise is about a dockworker who is thought to have gained some secret microfilm from corrupt CIA agents. In a Hitchcockian twist, the dockworker is completely innocent, but no one, not the bad CIA or the Hong Kong Cops believe him. It is up to Donnie Yen and Cynthia to protect him as the renegade agents appear around every corner thanks to Donnie Yen's turncoat/backstabbing parter played by Michael Wong.
The action (thanks to the great Yuen Woo Ping) is typical of the series, inventive and brutal, but what sets this one apart is the sheer number of action scenes. Here is a rough tally- in the first 15 mins there are three kung fu fights and a shoot-out, by the 30 min mark add four more kung fu fights and an interrogation room beating, in the next thirty mins (1 hr mark) add three more kung fu fights and include some torture, yet another interrogation room beating, and a car bomb, and finally, in the last thirty mins add four more fights, including the big finale, and another shoot-out. Cynthia's main moments are in a great fight on a moving ambulance in witch she is shoved though the window, her head dangling above the pavement, fighting on top of it, hanging off the front grill, and another fight with a fugly gwailo woman in a warehouse that involves some precarious scaffolding and elevator shaft fu. Donnie, however, has a the majority of the good fights, like a motorcycle chase and joust, as well as his fantastic final fight with a beefcake Ike Turner lookalike. If you are looking for action every three minutes, look no further.
The DVD is fair by Hong Kong standards. The picture is a little worn and there is some lack of clarity and spotting in certain scenes, but not enough to heavily distract most people form this entertaining film. It has its fair share of subtitle mistakes (""Dare you bent me. You must call for death."") It includes star bios of Cynthia, Woo Ping, and Donnie, where we are informed that ""It is believed that Donnie is now working with might and main to open up his future."" It also has trailers for the film and In the line of Duty 3&5, and Yes, Madam!.",982281600,8,2119,4.535248041775457
1234394,4,B00000JMP0,"This film is a showcase for both the physical ability of Donnie Yen and the choreography of Yuen woo ping. The fights here are the among the best ever committed to celluloid and if you get the full uncut print have a timeless classic. This DVD is the best version all round as it features a good quality picture and sound transfer, and as complete as America will ever make it.",979430400,,377,4.323943661971831
1234395,5,B00000JMP0,This movie is up there with Enter the Dragon as contender for best action movie ever made. Donnie Yen is at his coolest as the US cop who will stop at nothing to catch the suspect. The fights are great and are the stunt  sequences. The best bit being Cynthia Khan hanging of the front of a  ambulance at high speed.,958608000,,315,4.147540983606557
1234436,4,B00000JMP0,"Donnie Yen movie -- awesome.  He plays a cop in Seattle of all places.  The female lead actress Cynthia Khan is fabulous.  She is another Michelle Yeoh. The movie revolving Donnie and Cynthia having to go to Hong Kong to retrieve a suspect in a murder case.  The lead detective also works for the CIA who is selling drugs to raise money for some of their other ventures and the suspect that Donnie and Cynthia are looking for happens to be a guy that was in the wrong place at the wrong time.  What this poor guy goes throughout this movie is something.  The lead detective and Donnie are partners and Donnie can't belive he is dirty until toward the end of the movie. Again don't want to spoil the movie, it is worth watching.",1338768000,2,727,4.348148148148148
1234437,4,B00000JMP0,"A fun action film, lots of crazy stunts, and great fights scenes. It is not Donnies best film, but it is very close, I am a fan of his,so if you are, its a must for your collection.",1330214400,,181,3.789473684210526
1234438,5,B00000JMP0,"One of Hong Kong's great movies. The version I see has terrible/strange/fun subtitles not unlike a too drunk poet's. The first 25 minutes are the best 25 minutes ever filmed/released in and on Seattle. And that includes the dolorous ""The Beat,"" or whatever that homegrown cop movie was. ITLOD IV is an unrepentant anti-cia movie, everyone usa in this movie is some version of psychotic, one or two of them redeemably. Usa patriotic cliches and images abound. If you like that sort of thing, or great stunts, cool escapes, long, detailed fight scenes about as good as they get and don't mind a few physically impossible instant recoveries from hopeless beatings and the local Hong Kongese (made that up, no offense) being almost exclusively virtuous, check it out.",1328313600,,763,4.96875
1234439,5,B00000JMP0,"Like all of the 20th Century Fox DVD's in this set, this movie has excellent digitally restored video and sound. As good as the Dragon Dynasty's restored DVD's. This movie follows the classic HK action style to a tee. Lots of actions and bullets etc... Both Donnie Yen and Cynthia Khan were great in their action sequences in this movie.

Thanks to 20th Century Fox for a great job in restoring this classic, I love it!",1322870400,,419,4.5131578947368425
1234440,3,B00000JMP0,"Donnie Yen and Cynthia Khan are both excellent martial artists so all their action sequences are OK.

Overall production values and story are mediocre. Donnie Yen looks too young for his role.",1262390400,,192,5.0
1234441,1,B00000JMP0,"This is one of the bad movies starring Donnie Yen.

The fighing scenes are slow and below par compared with other good films of his. I found all the kung fu movies made before 1994 had this problem. The acting is bad. The plot is exactly the same as others.

Donnie's famous for his kung fu skills. You should see Iron Monkey, Hero, Butterfly sword, Once upon a time in China 2 and Blade 2 to appreciate how good he is.",1197158400,,419,4.160493827160494
1234442,5,B00000JMP0,"First of all, for all ITLOD series fans, this one is not an intriguing cop movie like, it's an Action film of the highest order. The film is perhaps a definitive Donnie Yen show (beside Iron Monkey/ Tiger Cage 2, perhaps) and it helps that his film associates (his mother's students) John Salvitti ja Michael Woods (a former Navy SEAL, btw) also do a lot of their best here. Definitely this ranks as the best actioner of ITLOD series and a contender for number one modern day fight film ever. By it's fighting content that is.

Being a great Yuen clan fan, this has always been one of my favorite films from them. Full of dangerous stunts and randomly abrupting moments of fiery action, this movie delivers. Plot either sucks, or serves as a vehicle for excusing more fight scenes to happen. Who cares anyway?

I often have compared this to other YWP classic of the period Tiger Cage 2 which was done a year or so later. While it has less action and a humorous tone, ITLOD 4 is dead serious and totally full of fights. Literally, what you get is tons of fights (modern kickboxing with some trademark YWP/Donnie touches thrown in) that jump to the face every five minutes. Some of the fights unfortunately look a bit similar or sometimes even non-interesting, but most often the drive is again maxed with some interesting piece of choreography and great energy from actors involved. Much of this is to thanked by Donnie's own fighting team and Cynthia Khan's secondary yet active participation in action scenes. Though she is not an action star per se, no-one beside Yuen clan can make her look this good.

Stuntman aficionado Cho Wing does tons of double/stunt work in this (the ponytail/eyeglasses bloke in the end), especially to female lead Cynthia Khan. Besides Donnie, I considered him the star of the film, being a great fan of top stuntwork.

In the end of the day, I rate overall this, far cheaper and narratively more repetitive and boring flick, BY it's action, better than Jackie Chan's nominal Police Story (or any Police Story movie). Jackie's film is more memorable and has some killer cinematography, but I prefer intricate kickboxing, cool minor stuntwork and endless row of good/brilliant fight sequences that show some of the best modern day martial arts stuff my both Donnie Yen and master Yuen Woo Ping. A definite classic of cop-kungfu -genre. One not to be missed, especially if one loves raw modern fighting action.",1167523200,2,2438,4.756501182033097
1234443,3,B00000JMP0,"If you're half-way bright then you can follow the story, but it's really tiring. The story is trash anyway so it's useless to even spend any time caring who is who and why they want to kill eachother, so just watch the fights. Now the fights are decent, but the best part is the very end with Donnie Yen and the swoll cat he is fighting on the roof... one of the coolest fight scenes I have ever seen. This is a good add to your collection if you are a Donnie Yen fan, or have exhausted pretty much all the other good martial arts movies you can find. You probably won't watch it much after the first time tho - except the end of course.",1161216000,,637,4.063492063492063
1234444,5,B00000JMP0,"ITLOD4 is quite possibly one of the best choreographed films ever. A true testament to the Yuen Clan's skill.

Of course the movie itself is super average, but you really stop caring when the fights are wall to wall. This is definitely one for real die-hard martial arts movie fans.",1136678400,4,282,4.64
7912576,4,B00000JMP0,"As with most HK action films of the era, there are awkward moments, but most are due to the cartoony dubbing and a few too many convenient accidents, a.k.a. Deus Ex Machinae. The reason to watch is the amazing fight choreography via Yuen Woo Ping, as performed by Cynthia Khan and the now-legendary Donnie Yen, the quality of which Hollywood has yet to even remotely approach.",1516147200,,376,4.712121212121212
7912577,3,B00000JMP0,"This Hong Kong movie is great in terms of martial arts and the stunts are quite good, but the acting is a bit poor.  Dubbed in English, the story is about a witness in Seattle, Washington, who saw CIA agents killing an undercover police officer who took photos of a drug deal between the CIA agents and drug dealers.  The photos are on a roll of film that everyone thinks this witness has, but he actually had dropped it accidentally at the scene.  Now, the CIA agents are trying to kill the witness while the police are after the witness thinking that he's the one who killed the undercover police officer.  While on the run, the witness heads back to Hong Kong, where his mother lives.  Now that he's in Hong Kong, he has the CIA, the Seattle police and the HK police all after him.  Every time he's taken into custody, he is kidnapped by someone.  Every time he is kidnapped, he's taken back into custody.  Back and forth, no one knows why the witness is constantly wanted no matter how the witness claims his innocence.  The story gets a bit tedious, but the fight scenes and stunts are quite good.",1499904000,,1102,4.415841584158416
7912578,5,B00000JMP0,"Blu Ray - 4/5: No extras other than a trailer. The picture quality is very watchable despite what some dingle-berries might tell you because they are HD douches who expect EVERYTHING to be perfect. The audio is a little inconsistent to where gun shots or car crashes make awkward noises but overall good.

Movie - 4/5: Some witness is targeted by gangsters and the CIA because they think he has a film of one of their drug deals. And that's about that. This movie is literally a non-stop action film with lots of martial arts action, gun fights and s*** and all of it is great. The story is one dimensional but it works well enough to keep the movie going. And Cynthia Khan has a firm, tight BOO-YAH! URRRRRGH!!! The End.",1482278400,,721,4.462121212121212

7912582,5,B00000JMP0,I am a big fan of martial arts films & this is no exception. The fighting is well choreographed but the voice overs are a little unusual at times. I love how the characters come to realizations rather quickly instead of the standard blind eye to the obvious. I also loved that the female lead really kicked butt. I was worried that alot of the movie would revolve around rescuing her. Overall a good watch if you really like martial arts.,1398729600,,438,4.419753086419753
7912583,2,B00000JMP0,"First, there are two major directors for this film; Martial Arts Directors Yuen Shun Yee, Wong Hun and Cho Wing and the principal director Yuen Woo Ping. The martial arts takes me back to one of Jackie Chan's movies i.e. Spartan X; then it leads to Police Story which are fair to pretty good. Now the poor issues are with story plot.  The actors pause and hesitate in several sectors of this movie, the story line makes the police (Donnie and Cynthia Khan) and the main character  (a dumb dock worker)  look very stupid  with poor decisions (not what you want to see in a Donnie Yen -Woo Ping movie).

A captain of the police force (bad cop aka a spy in the C.I.A.) is the mastermind behind the terrorist and attempted murder schemes which get boring after you see them twenty times. The voice over's or dubbed work is poor also, in one scene they use a woman's voice to tell Khan to freeze; however behind the gun was a man.

Here Yuen Ping takes no steals from the direction of movies he did and a ton from Jackie Chan; Proving that Ping is not really all that good-when he takes from others and recycles various action shoots like a bandit or a dog in heat",1382832000,,1159,4.317972350230415
7912584,4,B00000JMP0,"This is one of Donnie Yen's earlier pictures.  He is in top form like usual.  The cover of this DVD is a little deceiving.  It unfairly gives Cynthia Khan second place, when I would say she is really the main character (and her stunts are just as impressive as Donnie Yen's).  This is not a movie with a deep plot, but if you want a fine action movie with excellent martial arts choreography (which I had been in the mood for), go for it.",1361836800,,438,4.178571428571429
