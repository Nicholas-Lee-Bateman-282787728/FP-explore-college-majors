Why is there a difference in time of 21 minutes? (Now, 3 March, 2010, I see the running time has been changed to 101 minutes in the description.  The difference is now 12 minutes.)

Is this dvd a longer edit including scenes not in the earlier release?  Is this a longer version for television?  It is not listed as wide screen.  Or are there extra features that account for the longer time of this release?

I have the earlier release and consider this movie a great art work in movies.  I would buy an extended version if that is the case in this dvd.

I won't write comments on the plot especially as that has been done.  As a great example of camera work it is a very pleasant study.",1264464000,2,970,4.485714285714286
2960804,5,B000W0H5GA,"The Road Home is simply one of the most beautiful films you will ever see. Its gorgeous cinematography is matched perfectly with a simple yet heartwarming love story like no other. Director Yimou Zhang has intelligently crafted a film that perfectly captures the sweet joy and utter heartbreak of true love. The only nudity here is that of the heart, as Zhang shows us its naked beauty and capacity to endure over time.

Based on Bao Shi's book ""Remembrance,"" Luo Yusheng (Honglei Sun) returns home after his father dies and the story of his parent's romance is related. Another filmmaker might have used black and white for the flashbacks, but director Zhang wisely uses black and white photography in the present day and beautiful color for the memories to contrast the present sorrow to the joy of the past.

Yusheng finds his mother heartbroken at his father's death but determined his coffin be carried by hand over the rivers and through the mountains to the village. It is an ancient ritual of superstition carried out in the past so the dead will never forget their way home. It is a road that holds great meaning for his mother and father. Yusheng is reluctant at first until he looks at a photo of his parents and remembers their story of love.

Talented Ziyi Zhang gives a sweet and beautiful performance as Zhao Di. She takes care of her blind mother who it is said lost her sight from all the tears shed at her father's death. Di is sweet and sought after but has refused all the attempts at arranged marriages which are the norm for girls in her village. But when she sees for the first time the new young teacher and hears his voice, she immediately falls in love.

The women cannot take part in the building of the schoolhouse as it is against tradition but they prepare meals every day for the workers and Di spends much time laboring over her onion cakes and other dishes in the hopes Luo Changyu (Hao Zheng) will pick her special bowl that day. Their courtship is made up of glances and smiles. Once the school is built Di takes water from the well near the school in spite of the greater distance and hardship just to hear his voice and sometimes see him from a distance.

She sits and waits by the road every day to see he and the children go by singing. She finally devises a ruse to actually speak to him and it is then that we know he loves her to, even though nothing is said. Ziyi Zhang gives a terrific performance of subtle nuance, conveying all the uncertainty of first love. When it is she and her mother's turn to have him for dinner he promises to return to sample her mushroom dumplings but he must return to the city because of political difficulties and gives her a hair clasp to go with her red jacket.

The scene where she rushes after him running with her special bowl of mushroom dumplings is one of the greatest love scenes ever filmed, and will surely bring anyone with a heart to tears. Di waits anxiously as the date he hopes to return approaches during a snowy winter. Director Zhang uses these elements to parallel her emotions; bleak and cold when Luo is gone and sunny and colorful when he is there. When she nearly dies waiting on his return he comes to see her and it costs them two more years apart. The mayor and the whole village know of Di's love by then but a love of choice is something new to all of them. Di and Luo will be the first marriage in their village based solely on love.

The memories of their love story prompts Di's modern son to fulfill his mother's request at all costs. Many of his father's students join the long trek so he can be buried by that well to wait on his mother. It will prompt Luo Yusheng to fulfill another request of his mother's and bring back all the loving memories of the past in this wonderful film filled with love and joy.

Breathtaking cinematography and exquisite performances made this film the ""Audience Award"" winner at the Sundance Film Festival. There is a tenderness here rarely ever captured on film and this is one you can not miss.",1217203200,10,4037,4.453315290933694
2960805,4,B000W0H5GA,"Note: Chinese with English subtitles.

How long could you sit and watch a film about a young eighteen year old Chinese girl standing by the side of the road waiting for a certain male school teacher to passby, then only smiling when he finally appears? Well, if the girl is the lovely and expressive Zhang Ziyi the correct answer is quite a long time.

Set in a quiet, rural village in a remote area of China director Yimou Zhang has translated a tender love story between Luo Changyu (Zheng Hao) a newly arrived school teacher and Zhao Yuelin (Zhang Ziyi), one of the local villagers, into a visual poem of young love in its purest, most innocent form.

Focusing on Zhao as she goes about her daily tasks and routines we seem to experience first-hand her feelings and affection for the new teacher intensifying with each passing day. Every thought, every deed seems orchestrated in such a way as to bring her ever closer to her one true love.

Zhang Ziyi is amazing! With an absolute minimal amount of dialogue she succeeds in conveying all her emotional yearnings and desires visually; through her eyes, delicate facial expressions and subtle body movements and gestures. She is truly a remarkable and gifted actress.

The film starts out slowly, but stay with it. It gets alot better once Zhang Ziyi appears on-screen.",1197417600,4,1321,4.751091703056769
