8153467,2,B000JW6TH2,Not what I expected. I was looking for mor of a routine. This just shows how to do some exercises.,1419292800,,98,3.95
8153468,4,B000JW6TH2,"This is not just for grapplers. Anyone interested in a kettlebell workout will benefit greatly from this video. This guy, Dave Bellomo, really knows his stuff. You can tell he is a true-believer and not someone just peddling a product. Be prepared to work hard because this is not one of those made for TV type exercise videos.",1403827200,,327,4.655172413793103
8153469,5,B000JW6TH2,"On the off season, this video shows all the fundamental power moves that build the explosive power needed for  all grapplers to excel. Dave Bellomo has done it again with this video! He has distilled years of hard-core training mentality into a 2 DVD set.
BYOB stands for ""BRING YOUR OWN BUCKET"" because some who attempt these exercises may need it. They are certainly not for the faint of heart, or for the weak of spirit. They ARE, however, the best program for offseason fitness for grapplers, PERIOD.
 These exercises have been developed by Bellomo and approved by wrestling and martial arts coaches alike.  Training regimens for wrestling, judo, MMA are all rolled into these two DVDs. Get this set now, and start training for next season!!!",1402963200,,746,4.858267716535433
