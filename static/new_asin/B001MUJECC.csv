8545440,5,B001MUJECC,"A fantastic documentary about an amazing adventurer and one of my heroes!

I would not have believed this story or that this man even exists if it were not having the good fortune of meeting Mike Horn in July of 2003 while working on the North Slope of Alaska. I can personally assure you that this documentary is not a dramatization by any means: if anything it is under-dramatized. The Arctic is an extreme environment, even in the summertime. Many ways to die!

This documentary has some fantastic videography of Mike conquering almost impossible odds in the Arctic (don't want to give away the movie:).

There is some English in this movie but it is mostly in French. There is an English Subtitles option in the menu setup on the DVD.

My only complaint is that this documentary was too short (eighty-four minutes) but if it were as detailed as the book it would have been a mini-series. I don't know if it was intended for theatrical release in Europe.

If you read the book, which chronicles this epic adventure in much greater detail, ""Conquering the Impossible: My 12,000-mile Journey Around the Arctic Circle"", you will probably appreciate the movie a lot more. So many more things went wrong, wrong, wrong for Mike than the movie portrays. There are a lot more heroic, hilarious, and amazing scenes in the book, especially during his time crossing Siberia.

I enjoyed the book more but I also highly recommend the movie.",1264204800,3,1430,4.745967741935484
