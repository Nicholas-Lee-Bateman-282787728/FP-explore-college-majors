8508591,1,B0071PNTMI,"We bought this DVD because it claims to be a Christian kid movie. In the first two minutes the babysitter calls the kid a brat and a twerp. She tells him he's ruining her social life. He sneaks into to living room to watch a scary movie- so scary my kids were scared! The babysitter drags him up the stairs by his foot with his head hitting the stairs. Once the kid is his bedroom with the door shut, a storm starts and he starts seeing monsters all of his room.

That's when my eight year old ran out of the room and exclaimed, ""I'm never going to watch that again!"" I couldn't turn it off fast enough. We only watched the first few minutes. At first I threw this piece of garbage in the donation box, but I can't let another family buy this so I threw it away instead.

How this disturbing DVD got a Dove family approved seal is beyond me! If I could I would give it a -5 stars.",1354752000,3,880,4.051724137931035
