1618880,5,B00005K9O8,"Brutal. Unforgiving. Raw. You need mental equipment to sit through this gripping portrayal of a man with nothing left to lose. He's got his clothes, a stolen pistol with only 3 bullets and a hit list that's growing by the hour. This guy is an animal, and what's wrong with his face, anyway? His eyes bulge out; he refuses to smile. His face is almost purple with hate. He  haunts old friends in France asking for money and yet they have none. He's starving. He has death fantasies for everyone. The director and the narrator even warn you to leave the room if you're not ready for what's coming down the pipe (and I should have left), but it's lovely at the end. Just hang in there. This movie is a must for folks who need a ""pick me up"". Incredible acting. Drama at its finest and darkest. Wonderful writing. You can tell where comic artists like Frank Miller and Tim Bradstreet find some of their characters. Somebody send me a T shirt with the main character glaring with his bug eyes. Warning to some viewers: very brutal wife abuse scene. Again, you need mental equipment to sit through this--but hang in there (and remember they're only acting!)

1618881,3,B00005K9O8,"In a way, the fact that I was very offended by this film is a testament to its power.  On the other, this is the first time I've found it hard to let the filmmaker off the hook on moral grounds.
The extreme, extreme violence of this film is truly nauseating.  And I say this as one who's studied cinematic violence of all sorts -- from Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer to The Re-Animator, from The Killer to Salo:  The 120 Days of Sodom, from Robocop to Maniac.  But I dare say none of them evoked the incredibly negative response that I Stand Alone did.  The body count is low, but the acts of violence are so extended, and so repulsive in their immorality, that they hit you like sledgehammer blows.  This is the kind of film that would immediately get banned as a video nasty in the UK, and possibly get its director mobbed.
Henry:  Portrait of a Serial Killer is the closest comparison I can draw.  Man Bites Dog isn't nearly as bleak; Taxi Driver isn't as brutal or cold-blooded; and Maniac doesn't have one per cent of the brains.  What I feel is a feature-length ode to hatred, to blind, inarticulate hatred for all things alive and dead, and ultimately to self.  At the same time that I marvel at its ability to strike body blows and portray a reality (psychological and physical) this frightening, I can't say I really like this film.  At times, the film lingers so long on the suffering of its characters and assimilates the viewpoint of its reprehensible protagonist so thoroughly that it becomes hard whether it's the character that's violent and detestable, or the film that so closely resembles him.
If you like challenging cinema, it's definitely worth a look.  But if you've ever cried or become sick because of a movie, think twice before you delve into this one.",998524800,136,1783,4.534375
1618882,5,B00005K9O8,"the DVD is indeed very poor, no trailers, no short films from the director are available. on the other hand, the transfer is exellent!... ""SEUL CONTRE TOUS"",(i stand alone) was directed by GASPAR NO... the story takes place in france in 1980. it is the story of a jobless butcher struggling to survive in the bowels of his nation. the butcher (played by french actor philippe nahon) only wants one thing:""to escape the dark tunnel of his existence"". unfortunatly for him; his life is gonna hit the bottom,plagued by misfortune,betrayal,sadness..etc.. 70% of the film takes place inside his mind,the voice over is sometimes even more frightening than anything else. needless to say,do not watch this movie if you have suicide tendencies. the cinematography is really exellent.(the film was shot with a super 16mm anamorphic camera), the acting is impressive, it sometimes feels as if you're watching a documentary. the film contains pornography,disturbing violence... the ending is also extreme.., I won't spoil the rest, but ""I STAND ALONE"" is a must!...a masterpiece. ps:the short film entitled:""CARNE"" (also directed by gaspar in 1991) is the first part of ""i stand alone"" it is 45mins long and is equally good!..""carne also marked gaspar noe's debut in the cinema industry. -philippe nahon can also be seen in ""le pacte des loups"" aka BROTHERHOOD OF THE WOLVES...""la haine"" aka THE HATE...and ""les rivieres pourpres"" aka THE CRIMSON RIVERS.
memorable lines from the butcher: -""your mother. you love her as long as she gives you milk. & your father when he lends you money. but when her breats are all dried up. or when your father's pockets are empty. the best thing to do is lock them up. and let them die before they cost you too much. that's how it goes. the law of life.children pretend to be nice only when there's an inheritance.""...",997660800,12,1842,4.964401294498382
1618883,3,B00005K9O8,"By rating this DVD a three out of five, I do not mean to indicate that my opinion of the film is negative in any way.  ""I Stand Alone"" is a tremendously bleak, yet excellent portrait of Gaspar Noe's ""butcher"" character, a man filled with believable (because it is fairly mundane) inner torment that drives him to increasing levels of rage, violence, and socially unacceptable behavior.  The film can draw parallels to ""troubled lead character"" movies such as ""Taxi Driver,"" ""In a Glass Cage,"" and ""A Clockwork Orange,"" but ""I Stand Alone"" revels in realistic situations that feel as if they would be easy to fall into.  Far better than ""Man Bites Dog,"" and so far beyond anything involving Quentin Tarantino, this film is grim, but somehow not humorless, as Noe ""lightens"" the tone with jarring edits, sound blasts, and a very funny warning when things are about to reach a climax.  The loss of one (or maybe even two) star(s) is due to the decision to leave Noe's 1991 short film ""Carne"" (the precursor to this film) off of the DVD.  Overall, Strand Releasing did a poor job with this package, offering no ""extras"" whatsoever. Fans of writer Michel Houellebecq should look into this film as it portrays a more ""working class"" rendition of that author's inhuman viewpoint.",993081600,16,1272,4.789954337899544

As mentioned in the numerous other reviews, this film is a sequel to the 1991 short film ""Carne"". I recommend watching this short first, as it adds more depth to the characters in ""I stand Alone"". The short is available to watch on YouTube. It is in three parts, totaling about 40 minutes.

There was an overwhelming amount of praise for this movie in both reviews I have seen on Amazon and, as a dark/disturbing/violent/gorey/visceral/disgusting, etc. genre movie fan, in several articles devoted to the subject. I can appreciate, and thoroughly enjoy, a great number of movies that would turn others away in the first few minutes. I've seen many of these reviews comparing the ""brilliance"" of the film to others like ""Irreversible.""

1618921,5,B00005K9O8,"I STAND ALONE is a 1998 film made by the director Gasper Noe. The director has made two other films that are hell bent on shattering the norms but the overall effort never once seems conceited. Yes the subject matter is often trifling. The director has a unique way of expressing himself. The very beginning of I STAND ALONE will make it difficult for you to stop watching. Our protagonist is a butcher, he narrates his ideas and philosophies with the film. The imagery is unique and in 91 minutes you will have lived something which is unique. A week has passed since my first viewing of this film and I think its so good that its worth owning but I don't think I will be able to watch it again because the suspense would just not be there again. You on the other hand my reader are very lucky..just go watch it and no this isn't exactly gory or gruesome, it will challenge your eyes maybe twice only which isn't bad.

1618922,5,B00005K9O8,"Nine Things About the Movie I Stand Alone [France, 1998]

1. Out of all the countries of the world, only two - France and Germany - produce people that have the unflinching courage to make movies that depict the hellish pointlessness of life. This movie, being French, is one of those movies.

2. In 1991, French director Gaspar Noe made a short, 40-minute movie called Meat (the actual French title is Carne). Its about a strange and bitter man working as a horse butcher. He has an autistic daughter, and he struggles to raise her by himself - without giving in to the temptation to molest her. The short film won awards for its unique vision and brutal style, but was never released on DVD, so most people have never seen it.

3. In 1998, Noe made a sequel with the American title I Stand Alone. The beginning of it summarizes Meat very quickly; but if you have the resources to find the original film, I suggest watching it before this one. It makes it easier to understand the characters and what makes them tick. Plus it gives you a taste of Noes unique style - and lets you decide if you actually want to watch the sequel.

4. The main character doesnt have a name, hes just a mentally unstable butcher. His life is miserable and empty, and he hates everything, including his wife and unborn child. And black people, and gay people, and rich people, and Nazis. Anyway, after a violent confrontation that leaves him homeless, the butcher strikes out on his own to remake his life. But life has never worked in his favor, and the butcher heads towards a breaking point. He ends up with only a gun and three bullets, and he has to decide what to do with them.

5. Most of the movies script consists of the butchers internal monologue - he narrates whats going on inside his head as he bounces between friends, jobs, and bars.

6. While the butchers experiences are a commentary on contemporary French life, it could just as easily be a commentary on America.

7. The butcher is racist, homophobic, lusts after his daughter, and believes that life is completely worthless. He is one of the most unredeemable characters in cinematic history. And yet the movie makes us sympathize with him as we understand how he got this way. We recognize that societys angry crazy people are really just sad and pathetic.

8. Twenty minutes before the end of the movie, the audience is given a warning that they might want to stop watching. This is not because the rest of the movie is too violent to handle (though it is pretty violent), but because it detonates a psychological nuclear bomb, and you are whiplashed through the butchers breakdown. You are horrified, then hopeful and then horrified again.

9. Its a controversial movie because you get inside this mans head to such a degree that you understand how violence can naturally seem to be a solution to a life that is so tortured as to be unlivable. This movie is an intimately devastating punch in the throat that dares to show you the black truth sliding in the background of our life.

This is not a date movie.",1405641600,3,3062,4.550909090909091

1618954,5,B00005K9O8,"This film is hard to watch, but vital. The style is highly original-it uses brilliant film techniques throughout. First there are the bold title cards, then the abrupt cuts accompanied by gunfire, and the endless monologue of the main character that rehearses his values, his world-view, his endless resentments and hatreds. All this keeps the viewer in a state of dread, nervous, on edge--the first outbreak of violence is so horrifying, one images this character is capable of doing anything and anytime. This creates a genuine suspense far superior to horror films or suspense films. Everything is real and severe. Lille and Paris are almost interchangeable--empty streets, deserted alleys, pathetic shops and hotels. And the faces! The non-actors involved are haunting each in their own right. The ghost of Samuel Beckett is alive and well here, but the film exudes its own personality and power. It's a true work of art for those who are tough enough to take it. It illustrates the power of a film maker with genuine vision who will not compromise. Absolutely stunning!",1365811200,4,1074,5.073446327683616
1618955,1,B00005K9O8,"I'm a fan of horror movies so somehow the name of this movie came up in other movie reviews. People were saying things like no other film is as shocking or disturbing as I stand alone, so I wanted to see what all the hooplah was about. Well let me start by saying I wish I would have read the one star reviews first. Sadly, They were all pretty accurate. This film was nothing more than a middle aged, disgruntled, cantankerous, old flatulence who walks around the entire movie thinking hateful bigotry type thoughts out loud. There is nothing more to this movie than that. There is no action. There is no horror. It's the equivalent of someone who has the ability to read minds walking behind this guy all day. If you want to watch some guy go to work (think hateful thoughts), come home (think hateful thoughts), go to a movie (think hateful thoughts), go visit his mentally challenged daughter (think hateful thoughts), go to a bar (think hateful thoughts ,and say hateful things) oh and by the way, I think I may want to sleep with my daughter, because she is the only person who loves me. ""THE END!"" Then this is the movie for you. I found the film utterly pointless, I was bored to tears, and eventually became just as angry as the guy in the movie when I realized what I had purchased. This film leads you to believe that this guy is so angry that he is eventually going to go on a killing spree of some sort, or that there is going to be a ton of casualties left at this guys expense. Instead you get loads of build up and suspense with nothing ever happening. You will be left with the ending credits rolling up the screen and little else. If you are still curious please rent the movie first. I'm sure I don't stand alone when I say that I would have never added this movie to my collection if I had seen it first.",1364774400,3,1824,4.2898550724637685

1618957,4,B00005K9O8,"Gaspar Noe is probably my favorite foreign filmmaker in the world of the 21st century. My favorite film by him is definitely Irreversible and this one would have to be my second favorite. His film Irreversible is one of my top 20 favorite films of all time. The film has some brutal elements to it but the main character The Butcher's performance is amazing. A definite must see for film fans, but strictly for adults only. If you like this one then watch Irreversible because it is a astonishing piece of work. I wish Noe would make more films because he is definitely one of the best filmmakers ever in the history of cinema.",1344556800,,627,4.508771929824562
1618958,3,B00005K9O8,"I Stand Alone is Gasper Noe's first feature length film, and liking his unique style in Irreversible and Enter the Void I decided to check this one out. The camera work is much more 'normal' this time around, it doesn't really hover around the characters in extended shots, however the dialogue and lines are delivered with the same raw energy that are present in his later films.

So I Stand Alone is a character study about an old beaten man bitter with hatred and resentment to just about everything, and for long moments of the movie you'll just see him alone with his thoughts. Now this could go terribly boring or terribly wrong but Gasper keeps his inner monologues interesting, seeing how the man swallows everything life throws at him with bitter resentment until he decides that he's going to snap.

However when he does choose to snap it's a whole lot of thoughts and very little pay-off, I guess that's more true to real life but the ending just felt anti-climactic for me, he drops everything he planned, wusses out, and decides he found 'love' with his mentally retarded daughter. For such an enganging first two acts that's a relatively small pay-off, a bitter hateful man finds 'love', and his imagination sequence before feels like a cheap way to justify the pretentious ""YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO LEAVE"" stuff. Whatever, it is a French movie I guess.

Gasper Noe's movies though don't really have much of a plot, the experience is moreso what you pay for, and the experience to I Stand Alone is an ugly, miserable experience, which couldn't have been done any better. You see the ugliest of France in many scenes, you see some really ugly and miserable people or they're normal people labeled as ugly and miserable by our 'hero'. The whole experience puts you well in this miserable old man's shoes, and if a study of pure hatred sounds like your cup of tea than by all means, I just wish there was a better pay-off than 'finding love'.",1339372800,3,1951,4.649275362318841

First, I've seen this film compared to TAXI DRIVER several times, and while this comparison has merit, I feel it is incomplete. I would also add COMBAT SHOCK, and certain grim scenes from ERASERHEAD to help broaden the picture. Also, I would highly recommend watching Noe's CARNE, I STAND ALONE, IRREVERSIBLE, and ENTER THE VOID together as a series. That's all I can think of other than ISA being a true masterpiece of darkness and doom. The main character, known only as ""the butcher"", is a man on a mission of self-annihilation. He is driven by his hatred of everything, since he seems to feel betrayed by everything and everyone in society / life. What is there for such a person, other than destruction? The butcher's inner monologue is realistic, and serves as insightful narration for his increasingly violent actions. The finale is a heart-squeezing experience, culminating in the most obvious / only possible conclusion the this man's life of suffocating pointlessness...",1304985600,,1139,4.968586387434555
1618983,5,B00005K9O8,"Take a journey into the mind of madness with The Butcher, the protagonist in Gaspar Noe's intense crime drama ""I Stand Alone"" aka ""Seul contre tous"". This is the story of an unnamed butcher who has just been released from jail for a crime committed in the prequel to ""I Stand Alone"", Gaspar Noe's short film ""Carne"". The Butcher is out of jail and full of contempt for society and his flaky mistress played by Frankye Pain. Disappointment and discontent leads The Butcher further and further into sorrow and sociopathic tendencies. This controversial film pushes boundaries and includes graphic sex and violence, so be warned. But, if you are like me, this will be one of the most intense movie experiences you will ever have.

Gaspar Noe's ability to grab hold of his audience and force them to confront their personal demons is astonishing. Noe does this in ""Irreversible"" and again with this great film. ""I Stand Alone"" is one of those rare movies that drags on through narration yet completely pulls you into the character and doesn't let go. I literally felt as if I was the Butcher, having the narcissistic thoughts, doing those unspeakable things. I could relate to him yet was completely disgusted at the same time. What does that say about me? I don't know. Maybe it means I'm human or maybe it means I'm desensitized. Either way, the feelings the cinematography produced were very real and very intense. Noe is known for his unique filming style. He pushes the envelope and punishes his audience (in a good way). This film is no exception.

***SPOILERS BELOW***
The production in this movie was outstanding. The loud ""boom and zoom"" scattered throughout really pulls the tension strings of the viewer. Noe included a loud ""boom"" in the soundtrack then zoomed the camera into the Butcher. Each time that happened I thought something crazy is coming. Yet, that wasn't always the case. It kept me on the edge of my seat that's for sure.

I did think that the ""WARNING: YOU HAVE 30 SECONDS TO LEAVE THE SCREENING OF THIS FILM"" was a little pretentious; however, it was a good trick by the director. Without that warning the following scenes may not have been as intense. When the warning popped up my heart started racing and essentially made my psyche match that of the Butcher thus making me feel as if I was committing the violent act and falling into insanity. It was a powerful gimmick that truly worked to bring the audience's emotions up to the level of the Butcher.
***END SPOILERS***

""I Stand Alone"" is not for everyone. It is a journey into madness that is so realistic and gripping that you forget you are watching a fiction movie. Noe is a master of showing the struggle everyone has with the dark side of our psyche and the thoughts we randomly have but refuse to acknowledge. His films encourage us to confront that side and asks us to make a choice. One which we would normally not have in our daily lives. I think it helps us grow and in the end, somehow makes us more sane.

1618984,5,B00005K9O8,"Lille, Northern France, 1980: Fleeing a life of poverty, drudgery, custodial incarceration, as well as a failed marriage and an emotionally disturbed daughter, a middle-aged, penniless butcher (Philippe Nahon) leaves Paris and settles in Lille with the owner of the caf in which he used to work (who is also pregnant with his child). The butcher and his girlfriend, being without funds, move into the claustrophobic apartment of the girlfriend's elderly mother. As time passes and the butcher fails to secure work in the recession-blighted climate, the latent, barely suppressed anger which he feels toward the world and his increasingly emasculative girlfriend builds to a crescendo and eventually explodes into violence. Armed with a handgun, fermenting in anger, and resolving to live life purely on his own terms from hereon out, the butcher flees Lille and heads back to Paris and a horrifying appointment with destiny...

A theatrical sequel to his short film, ""Carne"", Gaspar Noe's ""I Stand Alone"" is one of the most confrontational, transgressive pieces of cinema that you're ever likely to see; it is a scarifying hymn of anger, resentment and despair sung by a man whose life has spun out of control due to a combination of poverty, unfortunate circumstance and his own pugnacious, bucolic temperament. Noe broadsides the viewer with a non-stop, almost stream-of-consciousness litany of anger, invective and cynicism as we listen to the butcher's thoughts in voice-over as the windows of opportunity in his life close one-by-one. The soundtrack is a bombardment of gunshots and slab-like synth tones which accompany smash-cuts which separate scenes, shots, zooms and Godardian captions. That said, Noe's film is emphatically NOT an exercise in gratuitous excess for the sake of it. It is a deeply affecting portrait of the members of an underclass who have been marginalised and downtrodden by the rapacious, venal nature of consumer capitalism. People quite literally exist as little more than currency in this hard-scrabble landscape and, depressingly, it is a world which is all too recognisable in today's recession-blighted times.

Philippe Nahon, a stalwart of contemporary French cinema, quite literally gives the performance of a lifetime as ""the butcher"" and it is a testament to his strength as an actor (as well as Noe as a director) that he turns a character who could have been an abhorrent caricature in less skilled hands into an existential anti-hero with an alarming insight into humanity; in Nahon's hands, ""the butcher"" really is the heir apparent to Genet and Celine's protagonists. The thoughts that he vocalises about the world may be unpalatable to many people, but one cannot deny that there is more than a grain of truth to many of them. If you've ever been unemployed, marginalised, downtrodden or mistreated, you cannot help but relate to at least some of what he says; literally, if you've ever been there, you'll understand where he's coming from - even if you can't empathise with or condone the shockingly transgressive actions that close the film.

""I Stand Alone"" is an uncompromising piece of cinema. It is a film about one man's descent into a deeply shocking and transgressive sense of morality as a response to a world which has rejected him and which is riven with cruelty, hypocrisy and brutality. Ultimately and despite its deeply shocking content, it is also a film about empathy, love and humanity - albeit one that is a million miles removed from the saccharine-coated, cookie-cutter sensibilities perpetuated in the majority of western cinema.

To my mind, ""I Stand Alone"" (along with Noe's other deeply controversial and similarly brilliant film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Irreversible/dp/B00009W0U4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Irreversible</a>) is one of the most important films of the last twenty years and it is for this reason that I recommend it unreservedly for those who have the stomach to engage with it's bleak vision.",1268265600,4,4032,5.354889589905363

It took me over 2 years to watch this film after having purchased it. I had seen Irreversible, and was actually afraid of seeing this movie because of not knowing what to expect. Anyway, I loved it. It rings so true to the thoughts of most of us... truly, we see in his racing thoughts the angry mentality that takes over us when the social structure conspires to crush our spirits. Unemployed, in a relationship with an ugly demanding woman (who has furthered the walls around him by carrying his child), away from the only person he loves (his daughter), aging with nothing to show for it, flat broke, and immersed in a system only preoccupied with appeasing the rich and ostracizing the poor. Of course it generates anger, and the blame definitely needs to be attributed to someone. Now, in the case of our friend, he shows very strongly how information overload leads to stagnation, it almost becomes a matter of survival for him to turn life into something monochromatic, some action of his must be undertaken in order to effectively change. Playing the game according to the system has failed him. The movie has a lot of inner dialog, and if you're like me and don't speak French, you will be reading very quickly. This definitely reflects the manic state he is in; he concretely projects his aggression into external objects, and takes action accordingly (seen when he kills his unborn child still in the womb). It unravels into a psychotic state when he becomes delusional about what he needs to do in order to save himself and his handicapped daughter. They must both die so they can truly be free, so they can truly fuse as one. At this point an advisory notice comes onto the screen, stating you have 30 seconds to leave the screening. This is definitely anxiety-provoking for anyone. What follows is definitely disturbing. His daughter is shot from behind, the bullet hole piercing through her neck and she lies on the floor writhing, bleeding from the orifice, resembling the slaughtering of a cow or horse (the image that came to me was of the horse at the beginning of Carne), and he as well states that animals usually die faster, and he can't stand to see her suffer like that. The analogy to irrational beasts is more evident with the fact that she does not speak, thus contorts and dies as a nonverbal creature would. The concreteness of his outside projections becomes more limited, and he decides killing the man who didn't give him a job was less important than carrying out the main plan. In essence, by reenacting his past profession (and thus the definition of his life) in that moment, he literally kills off the 2 key aspects of his existence to date with the 2nd shot (he destroys the image of the slaughtered contorting animal, which he can no longer stand to watch; and he kills his daughter, his link to happiness, and the only thing truly keeping him in this world). Thus, she is shot in the head. He deliberates for a long time before turning the gun on himself and committing suicide, thus destroying the 2nd part of his psyche, the castrated version of himself that no longer has any real reason to remain alive. Eventually we see this was all engendered by his imagination, and he decides to seek the so-called fusion with his daughter in a sublimated form, having sex, a more attractive alternative which also allows psychic survival. After this, there is something of a reverse Oedipal role, she is the mother-figure consoling the crying baby, and the boundaries of the forbidden incestuous relationship are shattered, thus he can find peace. All in all, an excellent film. Don't compare it to Irreversible, they have exceedingly distinct messages.. there do seem to be allusions to it (many references to tunnels) as well as to Noe's new film in the mentioning of the great void of death.

1618987,2,B00005K9O8,"Some of the other reviewers have compared to this Gaspar Noe's outstanding film ""Irreversible"", do not be fooled. This is totally opposite than that piece of work.
First, this film is way too deep into the narrative of the main character (you'll be reading subtitles more than watching the film), and I enjoy foreign films, but this one, there are parts where I had to scan back just to catch up to the characters words. This is the basis for the plot, one long narration read by the character, that's it!
Second, there is really nothing redeeming about anything going on in the story, some people could say that love is the center, or essence of this movie, but I fail to see it. Also if you're put off by incest, then I would stay away.
Third, this movie drags on and on. ""Irreversible"" had momentum and staggering camera work, ""I Stand Alone"" has an annoying musical effect for the first hour, that even the sound sent the cats out of the room.
Fourth...this is NO ""Irreversible""!!! There are some rather graphic moments in ""I Stand Alone"", but those few scenes do not make an entire film plausible.

This flick is haunting, but I cant put my finger on why that is.
Oh wait yes I can!!!
A fetal stomach beating,
the constant split second movement of the camera, accompanied by sharp dissonance,
racism, misogyny, misanthropy
child molestation,
and of course a positively heartless(?) murder scene.
You can actually feel the main-characters insanity,
(ie: his inner monologue becomes rapid & incoherent)
as the movie progresses toward it's disturbing, violent conclusion,
which the director is courteous enough to give the viewer a 30 second warning to leave the room before the insanity ensues.
(NOTE: The widely offensive, unwarranted ending comes straight out of left-field, you won't expect it.)

The plot is simple enough,
A man on the fringes on a psychotic melt-down, flips out one day when he can't find a job and can't handle the pressures of everyday life.

Anyone who is familiar with Noe's oeuvre should probably know what to expect ( see ""Irreversible""). Philippe Nahon, known to American audiences for his repulsive turn as a serial killer in Alexandre Aja's ""Haute Tension,"" stands out as a middle-aged butcher who is quickly descending into paranoid psychosis. Consumed by free-floating hatred, Nahon wanders the mean streets of Paris obsessing over the daughter whom he let slip away. Noe punctuates many scenes with staggering zooms augmented by a nerve-jarring sound effect. This effect serves to unnerve the viewer very successfully. Also, there is a warning before the last half hour of the film for those who are squeamish.( Remember the ""fear flasher,"" and the ""horror horn?"" It 's sort of like that.) ""I Stand Alone is a very rigorous work of cinema art from a rather transgressive new voice in French film.

Possibly more. The other 15% of us have some explaining to do. I appreciated this for the look inside a mind rapidly turning on itself and the world it sees. Our boy goes insane with gumption! If you enjoy this because you're fascinated while watching the overbearing progression of mental illness as it consumes a man, well, I don't know if that even saves you but it's where I fit.

I Stand Alone has a real documentary feel to it as it follows The Butcher through his everyday life, focusing on all the thoughts running through his head and his distaste for....well everything. I mean I couldn't help but feel where this guy was coming from. Alright besides the forced abortion and the incest part (even that's low for my standards), but I couldn't help but relate to his bleak outlook on life that is only rivaled by my own. I personally enjoyed this more than Gasper Noe's other film Irreversible, just because it feels more like a horror film to me and has more replay value in my opinion. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!

A happy ending? The best part of this for me was definitely the ending. The irony of the whole thing was just brilliant.

1619004,4,B00005K9O8,"This movie is about a French 50 year old former butcher who is down on his luck. He didn't have a good childhood, his mother abandoned him.. no one will hire him and he has no money. Not only that but he's admitted to molesting his own child, beats on his pregnant mistress and hates the world. He never smiles. Not what you would call a ''good guy'', in fact he's just the opposite despite his somewhat interesting theories on certain aspects of life.

After beating up his pregnant mistress he takes off, gets some seedy motel room and begins to contemplate how he's going to make ends meet all the while having thoughts about how he hates people, life, and talking about how all he has left is his life and his gun. He's a patriot, he loves his country and that's about the only thing you can tell he has any feeling for and also a slight fondness for sex which he calls the only purpose in life....

He is a very angry depressed man. You can hear the thoughts in his mind. He keeps insisting his existence means nothing and he wants to even the score. This guy is losing control, has major class envy and wants revenge on people who have money.

 Up until this point you think yea, this guy is insane but how much worse can it get?

Until 9 minutes after the first hour when this appears..

'Danger! Danger!' flashes across the screen in bright red letters and a message appears that says...You have 30 seconds to leave the screening of this film...

What happened after that was extremely disturbing and made me sick. He is so convincing in this role and the act was so realistic it made me sick to my stomach. The depth of his mental illness and the act which he 'supposedly' commited topped almost everything i've seen.

Though as with French films this is another one that totally suprises the hell out of you at the last minute. You will never expect it.  Let me just say this guy has a meltdown, as to the outcome of that meltdown you will never guess it. This is a mind-bending extremely controversial movie. I still don't understand exactly what the end of the movie was trying to convey.

What makes this film one of the most disturbing of all time is this man's mental illness and his descent into the unthinkable. It's a portrait of a man who hasn't succeeded in life and has gone to the brink of insanity. This is scary stuff.",1195171200,4,2342,4.375576036866359
1619005,2,B00005K9O8,"Noe's film ""I Stand Alone"" spends most of the movie watching an angry man walking around thinking angry desperate thoughts.  If someone has a real crappy life, then watching this movie will make him feel better.  I say ""him"" because girls will not like this movie (unless they enjoy watching a pregnant woman getting her fetus punched out of her).

Wow! This fellows life really sucks.  My life is just great compared to this old goon, but watch out fifty plus fellows.  Agreeing to the defeatist argument of ""I Stand Alone"" can lead to negative acting out such as wanting to blow brains out, incest, and other acts of anti-social suicide.  Life can stink, but so can certain types of artsy fartsy French film fare.  Sooooo, that is what it is like to be ""nihilistic!""

That being said, Noe's ""Irreversible"" is a far better film than ""I Stand Alone.""  It is more poignant in its statement that the innocent can suffer in this world for no reason at all, and the guilty can get off without ever being punished for their evil.  Of course, after one watches this bit of cinematic larceny, it may be discovered that one viewing will be enough to last a lifetime.

Still, those looking to see the envelope pushed will be disappointed. This is not ""Ichi the Killer"" or ""The Devil's Rejects"".

In fact, all the hype about how ""shocking"" this film is obscured the fact that the main character is well-drawn, wonderfully portrayed and though he's full of rage and violence, it's hard not to pity the dumb brute as he bludgeons his way hopelessly through the bleak slums like an enraged, tormented bull, soon to be put out of its misery . This film is ultimately a tragic character study. It is mature and thoughful.

The butcher is definitely not a sympathetic character, but like Keitel's cop in the Bad Lieutenant, he is doomed, trapped by his self-hatred and misanthropy. The Butcher's ""redemption"" is as twisted and illusory as his values. Like a Kafka character, he is lost in a world that he cannot understand or control.

This is one of the few movies I've seen (and I've seen thousands) that has had a psychological affect on me.  After watching it, I hated everyone and everything.  I cried.  I was angry at Gaspar Noe (one of the best directors ever) for jerking me around in a very effective way.  I accepted the ride and was worse off for it.  Simply incredible.

You can read the plot in other reviews or in the summary.  I suggest you stay away from that, though, and go into this with an open mind.  Realize that if you look away there is an interesting trick that will cause your attention to constantly be drawn back to the screen.  And like I've mentioned before, if you've found the film hard to watch up to the warning, turn it off when that comes on screen because the real pain is just about to start.

... Perhaps my expectations were too high. Perhaps I am jaded. Perhaps I have seen films like 'Salo', 'The Untold Story', and 'Cannibal Holocaust' too many times...

Gasper Noe's first official film 'I Stand Alone' has quite a reputation. I almost wish I would not have read so many reviews before hand. If I had went into this film with no expectations it very likely would've knocked me over with it's sheer nihilistic impact. However, after hearing a few rumblings about the shocking and disturbing nature of this film I became intrigued. Consequently I went and read a number of comments and reviews from IMDb & Amazon whilst I patiently awaited for my DVD to arrive...

I don't want to say that I was let down- this was a very entertaining and effective film. Very well-done (as we should expect from Noe). However, the prior knowledge I had of this film before hand perhaps muted and dulled the effects of viewing...

In my opinion, the pregnant-wife battering scene was much more shocking and brutal than the ending. The on-screen warning near the end of the film seemed a bit extraneous and actually unnecessary. If anything, that warning should've been placed before he beat on his pregnant wife. The ambiguous incestuous ending did not really shock or surprise me. It was actually kind of sweet, as it was the first time that the Butcher appeared human and capable of love. It actually redeemed him abit to me...

The Butcher was just about the most loathsome and pathetic creature I have ever seen upon the screen. He actually had me laughing out loud many times at what a miserable, nihilistic freak he was. I found myself wishing he would end his laugh to spare me having to listen to him anymore. He was utterly ridiculous. I say many of the awful and terrible things he says from time to time- the difference is that I am joking. The Butcher actually meant all of this. Incredible that someone could be so negative and pathetic...

All in all, this was a rather entertaining and unique film. If you are anticipating a blood-soaked shock-fest, you will be very disappointed. However, if you leave your expectations at the door and watch with an open mind, you will likely be amused and entertained. Do I recommend purchasing this film? That all depends on your level of obsessive DVD collection. If you have not had the pleasure of viewing Noe's 'Irreversible', most definitely see that first. I can whole heartedly recommend 'Irreversible' as a blind buy. Alas, I cannot do the same for 'I Stand Alone'...

Although it is a very effective work; an example of fine cutting edge film-making, tempered with a heavy doe of psychological battery; it is not quite as good as 'Irreversible' (in my opinion). However, if you are a fan of edgy cinema, and looking for something different, you can do much worse that 'I Stand Alone'...",1170288000,2,2895,4.7207920792079205
1619010,5,B00005K9O8,"This film is not for everyone.  It is for adults who are willing to look closely at the uglier side of human nature.  Noe runs a warning with about 20 minutes to go, giving you a chance to leave the theater in anticipation of an upcoming display of horrific violence.  Of course, this is somewhat of a sick joke because up to that point, you will have been subjected to over an hour of being captive to and pummelled by the rambling disconnected thoughts and acts of a misanthropic angry increasingly desperate human being hitting bottom.

Just to address a thread which seem to run through the reviews (I suppose there might be thematic spoilers here depending on your standards though I will speak generally): yes, there are a few brief moments of very explicit physical violence in this film.  The film is not, however, meant for those who look forward to seeing acts of violence as some sort of thrill (and I don't really mean that to sound as judgmental as it might come across as I can be one of those people on any given day).  The main acts of violence here, directed against women, are meant to display the depths to which the butcher has been reduced by his feelings of helplessness as he has been unempowered by society: no job, no refuge of home, no love through companionship, no real purpose other than surviving, other than attempting to validate his existence on the planet somehow; so he lashes out at the targets he can, the ones who are defenseless and easy.  Some people will have a hard time stomaching these scenes and will be revolted, but properly so: they are meant to horrify and disgust you.  If you cannot handle things like this, just don't watch this film; the scenes are essential to it and you can't just skip them and really have seen this movie.  The trick here is that Noe lets us in on the running interior dialogue of this man unraveling and dares us to feel superior, to feel like we are not capable of supreme ugliness if luck were to go against us.  The butcher's rage against society is marred by pettiness, arrogance, self-pity, and by an inability to gather up the strength to strike out at the ones who have really reduced him to what he is; an inability to fix a world that is so vastly beyond the scope and control of any single individual.  So he must displace: he rambles about how France has fallen, targets minorities in his mind, has explosions of anger over the smallest and most inconsequential of things, his mind jumping from coherent thoughts to crazy ones, and mixing real grievances with completely false ones.  He fantasizes about paying back those who really caused him injustices; and yet, those plans for vengeance are continually falling apart, under the futility of ever really being able to lash out at so many unreachable targets.  Noe doesn't give you the cathartic moment that many such ""man in despair"" films give you; there is no real payback here to give you a surrogate moment of relief, that justice can be achieved.  The butcher only dreams of having that kind of satisfaction in an effort to keep himself going.  Noe instead throws you a completely different curveball in the ending, which is simultaneously moving, completely appalling, pitiful, and strangely in a way even rather uplifting, as horrible as the conclusion is.  When the butcher finally relents close to the end and breaks down and cries, turning his anger against himself as a failure, it is heartwrenching, a great performance by Nahon.  And the butcher's final thoughts, as wrongheaded as they will (I certainly hope!) strike you, are meant to make you think hard about how a human being is to find emotional meaning once the rules of civilized life have become irrelevant because you have no hope of success, no chance to be a winner as society has rigged things.

A lot of people have complained about this film and Irreversible, that Noe is something of a sensationalist charlatan.  Both films share a fondness for aggressively attention-drawing formal gimmicks and both films do hit the audience quite hard with the details of the grotesqueries they depict.  I support Noe's work in these films because I think we've become so jaded that in order to get us to really feel ill at ease, to question, to react, some extreme techniques are warranted.  A lot of people have grown quite comfortable in this world denying the horrors that go on around us, keeping them marginalized in boxes outside our minds, and being provoked like this has its purposes and reasons.  And a lot of people have desensitized themselves to everpresent death and to violence, justifying their part in civil society by notions of punishment, vengeance and deserving fate.  You could certainly just decide that you don't need to be so provoked, that you are quite self-aware of your limits and how sensible you would be under moments of crisis and anger, that you grasp how and where violence in society is acceptable and where it is not.  If so, I guess you don't need to be seeing movies like this.",1170115200,5,5020,4.691343963553531

In a sense, one can see it as an uplifting finale as this unnamed butcher finally reaches a measure of peace and acceptance of his lot.

Oh sure you have. It is the very fabric of nightmare, that painting: Saturn shrouded in inky darkness, down on his knees, rending and wolfing down a bloody, pulpy thing that an instant before had been his child.

Now is it coming back to you? Consider the face of that Mad, Terrible God:  its features contorted in a rictus of unquenchable lunatic appetite, the eyes reeling in their distended sockets, the massive, fleshy hands rending and tearing the sacred flesh before Old Father Kronos takes a bloody bite, shivery with the joy of violation.

That's the stark, primeval, hungry terror of Goya's depiction of the ancient story of Kronos, who devoured his own brood lest they supplant him. No doubt our shaggy caveman forebears whispered that shivery tale in grunts around their cooking fires, but until Goya, the unspeakable vileness of the Devouring had never been slathered up on a gallery wall---not before, and not since.

Until now.

Gaspar Noe's ""Seul Contre Tous"" (really ""Alone against All"", though oddly translated as ""I Stand Alone"") hurls a slab of maggoty meat deep down into the Ogre's cave, and his Butcher (incomparably made real by Phillipe Nahon) comes hulking up from his slumber, hungry for blood and revenge.

Most of all revenge. Does he get it?

Noe is a film-making madman & bomb-lobber, and he has created something deeply feral and astonishing with ""Seul Contre Tous"". The result: a kind of cinematic blowtorch, prepped all white-hot, with which he lulls the viewer---Noe is only going to flip the infernal thing on and off.

That's when he shoves the fiery thing up the viewer's a**, all 80 butane-belching pounds of it.

So: we are airlifted at terminal velocity into the Butcher's own bleak personal Hell, into which he has been vomited from Prison, to which he was consigned after mangling a man he mistakenly thought had raped his mentally retarded daughter.

The Butcher has lost everything: his life, his profession, his honor, his butcher shop, which is now run (profitably) by Arabs. He abandons his daughter to an institution in Paris, and flees for Britanny with his corpulent mistress, who tempts him with the promise to finance a new store, and binds him with the child---his child---in her belly.

The frenetic narration, the jarring, frenzied jump-cuts (accompanied by small sonic booms), and the crazed martial music imposed over a blood-red map of France (denoted, ""F!"") suggest a military campaign: and indeed, this is a War, this is a Revolution, of the bleakest, most depraved, most barbaric kind. Our Butcher finds himself in the streets, with a gun and three bullets, on a mission to the guts of Paris to---um, rescue?---his daughter.

The Butcher becomes his own Revolution, his own Kronos: and all Revolutions, all Godheads, demand payment in human blood. Can we hope for a happy ending?

To say more would be to ruin your quality time with the Monster, to give you the key to the labyrinth while the Minotaur was out. I won't. The movie is almost sublimely bleak and hellish, Nahon is stunning as the roving tormented soul with a gun, and Noe keeps everything stark and well-lit, so you have to look, particularly when the Ogre is ready to eat.

Which is why Goya's cannibalistic vision is less shocking than Noe's: Goya had the taste---or mercy?---to shroud everything in inky darkness. Noe keeps the house lights up, and his sets are all garishly lit, like a porno flick.

You have been warned.

1619072,5,B00005K9O8,"Not since Martin Scorsese's Taxi Driver have I seen a film that explores the furious rage of an alienated man on the verge of insanity so well. The only difference is that the subject matter of I Stand Alone makes Taxi Driver look like an after school special. I Stand Alone is one of the most taboo breaking films I have ever seen. And even though it may not be as taboo breaking as films like Salo: The 120 Days of Sodom, I Stand Alone is not exactly the kind of movie you want to show your entire family.

I Stand Alone follows the story of a misanthropist simply known as the butcher. I won't divulge into the back story of this charming fellow too much, but he is quite possibly one of the most bitter and utterly malicious characters I have ever seen in a film. If you thought that Travis Bickle was a disturbed individual, then you should see this guy. Basically, throughout the film he goes around ranting and raving about how much he hates everyone and everything. He denounces morality and sees it as nothing more than a restraint upon the poor. He fantasizes over and over again about murdering people he meets along the way to his own self-destruction. The butcher is a man with nothing left to lose. He is an ugly, primitive representation of what humanity really is -- man is nothing but an animal that struggles for its own survival in an otherwise indifferent universe. In the end, the butcher is a man without a god and a man who has been abandoned by his own society.

I Stand Alone is a slab of human misery caught on film. If that is not your kind of thing, then I suggest you steer clear. This film does not have an ending where the main character, despite his complete and utter hatred for humanity, redeems himself.

I Stand Alone is nothing but a spiral downwards.",1145404800,4,1788,4.395770392749244

Just kidding, although I doubt if Mr. Noe was kidding when he made both ""Irreversible"" and ""I stand Alone"".  This guy does ""ugly"" well.  This movie is put together very well, and may be hard to stomach for some people.  But let me clue you in on something - it's not near as violent as the other reviewers say it is.  In fact, by hardened horror movie fanatics standards, this movie isn't even as disturbing as the ""Exorcist"" or even ""the devils rejects"".  You certainly do get a real gritty feeling by watching this lil' flick, and of course if you've been deprived of porno flicks like the ""Taboo American style"" films then you most certainly will be shocked... but me?... not so much.  One thing that Noe does well is that he makes you rethink certain popular philosophies - one in particular:  ""To each his own""... have you ever found yourself saying that?  wellllll then you gotta check out Noe's films.  I gave this film three stars simply because Phil Nahon (the butcher) is so believeable; great casting!  You take one look at the guy and he really doesnt have to say a word for you to believe that he is about to pop a fuse.

1619075,4,B00005K9O8,"At one time, The Butcher had a decent life, owned his own butcher shop and was raising his daughter.  However, when one day his daughter starts her period and runs to his shop in fear, The Butcher believes that she has been sexually assaulted and winds out beating the man he believes responsible almost to death.  For this, he spends years in prison, and when released, has nothing left to him.  His business is long gone, his daughter in a mental institution, and his old friends and business acquaintances are unwilling or unable to help him find work.

He takes up with a woman who owns a tavern and she becomes pregnant, selling her business and moving with The Butcher to the outskirts of the city to live with her elderly mother.  The woman becomes overbearing, backing out on her promise to set The Butcher up in his own shop.  Jobless, he is forced to sit around all day listening to the insults and humiliations dished out by the women until he snaps, beating his pregnant girlfriend and fleeing back to Paris.

Without money and without a job, he wanders the dark, fetid streets raging against his life and every single person who has ever crossed his path.  His long diatribes are so psychotically ferocious and filled with the vilest thoughts of murder, self-debasement, and burning hatred that it practically has the power to peel the paint off your walls.  This is the story of a man sunk to the lowest depths of life, and then beyond into the putrid sewers of a psychotic mind.

The film is entirely in French with English subtitles.  There are graphic, XXX porn scenes in it, when The Butcher sits in a seedy theater, ranting and watching the movie.  There is graphic violence against women, both audio and visual, and a place in the movie where the screen blanks and flashes a warning that the weak-stomached are warned not to watch.  However, I've seen much worse and thought the warning to be a little theatrical, though it was a bloody, incestuous, and graphically violent ending.

'I Stand Alone' is not for the weak of heart or stomach, but The Butcher's incessant rants against life and women, friends and acquaintances, give an interesting if not repulsive view into the mind of a very psychopathic personality.  Overall, it's a strange, violent, bloody film that holds back no punches.  Rent before you buy.  Enjoy, but keep your barf bag handy.",1142121600,3,2371,4.702179176755448

It definitely makes the viewer uncomfortable and un-easy while anticipating what this unstable, time bomb butcher is gonna go off on since that little devil on his shoulder keeps him on the negative path of everything and anything he can think of.

Goes from place to place dealing with whatever situation he is in at that moment and his mind is constantly spinning and dropping a few screws here and a couple of nuts and bolts over there because of all the hatred and envy and every other negative emotion that exists in him and all the negatively bad advice he keeps giving to himself.

Disturbing  ---  Violent  ---  Plain 'ol scary this guy is

I would hate to come face to face with this man. I don't even want to be in the same hemisfere he's in.

Buuuuuuut...that's what the movie is supposed to do. And it does.

Kind of like Falling Down meets Taxi Driver but on an extremely distubing level.  Douglas &  Deniro are sane wussies next to this fruit cake.

You know, this guy is so rediculously negative i burst out laughing a few times from his idiotic way of thinkig.

1619077,5,B00005K9O8,"The movie about the butcher who has lost it all is an impressive venture into an eloquent narrative about despair, and most of all, loneliness. In a way, the topic can be considered immature, a little too much of the teenage in anguish sort of dialogue, but it is just so well conceived in regards to No's particular cinematic vision that it becomes a powerful tale of one man's abandonment to his pathologies and to the inevitable decay of society.
  There is something about Gaspar No's films -perhaps a certain quality of grotesquery and exaggerated reality, or his fixation with certain pieces of classical music- that somehow manages to inflict pain into the viewer. When you see the color in the film, that sort of yellowish or reddish accent, that sickly overtone in embellished color, you are being set up visually for the entrapment of narrative, plot and ideas. Then add to that, a story of an undeniable pathetic element, and you are in for an experience, no matter what you end up thinking of the film.
  If you have already seen his following film, `Irreversible', you might know what to expect from No. When I first got a hold of this film, I had a very ambiguous feeling, one that oscillated from unease to curiosity, and this because of having watched Irreversible. The film does deliver a fair amount of extremely well crafted shock value, just to jolt your senses, in way, to create a final paroxysm for the tension that the butcher's monologue of despair has been creating through out the film. The end is hard to watch but it doesn't come off as unnecessary violence. It is more of a whirlwind of the extreme despair of the butcher. Irreversible ends up as more of a shocker because the rape scene is just so long and perverse.
  But more than anything, shocks aside, the story presents us with a very interesting look of how a man can let himself go and just give in to his altered state of mind. This is exemplified beautifully in the relation between the butcher and his daughter. As with irreversible, No works here with a fairly simple story, and a very simple axiom. In this case, for example, it is an examination of morality and man as a measure for it. When a man is distraught is all society to blame, or is it time for this man to abandon society by any means?
  If you are looking for a disturbing movie with eloquent dialogue, in this case a monologue, and that is a well made film, this is one of them. This film may be criticized more than other disturbing films since it is so well made and this causes it to be more intrusive; it has the elements of a reality somewhat possible in the lives of everyone, as was irreversible. It doesn't create the fear that irreversible creates, or the feeling of lost safety; it creates something different, yet on the same level as both the fear and insecurity in irreversible. It is of course to be viewed by very different standards of those used to watch a disturbing film by Ingmar Bergman, or the way you view a Tarkovsky or a Bresson or a Lynch or a Miike film. The point is, No definitely has a unique cinematic voice, and although it is a voice in development, it is a very powerful one and he needs no comparison to other filmmakers. As does Irreversible, the film ends with a passage of classical music that accentuates the bittersweetness of the finale.  Another very good reason to watch this film, is the choice of actors used to play the characters in the film. The vision of the butcher seems to correspond to the world since it is the case that the people who inhabit it show that same decay in their expressions.",1128470400,5,3601,4.5107361963190185

First off, I have been buying every ""shocking"" movie I can find just to satisfy my curiousity. Very few actually do shock me. But 'Irreversible' did shock me, definately changed me for the better. I will never let my girlfriend walk home alone again! I was expecting the same hardcore, raw story-telling in this film...and was not disappointed. Being a bit of a cynic, I found the Butcher's attitude slightly comical. Anyone who's ever felt dumped on(for any reason) can certainly partially relate to the protagonist's feeling of helpless isolation. I mean, this cat is alone even when he's in the presence of others. His inner dialog is always with us as we follow him through his self destructive quest to regain some sense of Manhood. This is a man's movie. Of course, very few people actually cross the line this character does through the course of his many frustrations- and thank God for that. However; that whole incest thing I didn't quite understand and I'm not going to try to. All I can say is that from a common Man's perspective this film is not all that shocking, save for the formentioned relationship between Father and Daughter.

If you don't count the effect of these disturbing scenes, the movie does not have much to talk about.  The plot(it there is one) lacks integrity, the ending is out of sync with the rest of the movie and in general the scenes in the movie are not developing very well.

Good movies have food for thought or are at least entertaining, but this one does not any of these qualities.  It's not entertaining and once the movie is over, you can pretty much forget about it.

1619104,5,B00005K9O8,"I really love Gasper Noe's two films.  They have simple messages and convey them simply, and beautifully.  One would have to be blind not to see how talented this guy is.  And he really is.
There are already plenty of synopses in the other reviews, so I won't repeat the story here.  I do want to say that this is not a film that is ugly for ugliness' sake.  It is a movie about a man from certain social stratum trying, and failing, to deal with faliure.  He is filled with hatred, for himself and for everyone else.  The most interesting thing is, as I listened to him spew his bile, I couldn't help but nod my head now and then.  The Butcher has moments of insight, and you can tell that Noe empathizes with his character, because he proves him right again and again.  I even found myself forgiving our protagonist's racism and homophobia - because it was so obviously misdirected anger.  He is brimming over with anger and self-hatred and, I'll admit it, I felt very sorry for the poor [illegitimate].
I only spent so much time on my half-assed analysis because I feel that Noe's films are misunderstood.  They are nihilistic, but so what?  They both honestly explore some aspects of the human experience that most humans don't want to think about.  And I think they are fascinating.

1619105,4,B00005K9O8,"Gapar Noe is a great filmmaker. He is actually my new favorite Director and I look forward to seeing anything he touches upon seeing Irreversible which completely blew me away). It seems at first that his main focus is to take the things we have not yet endured in film and make us numb to it all. Noe is technically sound and writes an a decent screenplay here particularly the dialogue). Subtitles aside, if you speak English or French, the dialogue takes you deep into the mind of the film's ""protagonist"" (a character we briefly encounter in Irreversible as well).

Let's dissect the word protagonist for a moment. It can mean the principal figure or it can mean the leader of some kind of cause. Noe uses his protagonist for the former and destroys any positive connotation the word may have held at any point. Michael Corleone (The Godfather) and William Munney (The Unforgiven) are examples of villains directors are sympathetic toward, but there we find reason for their downward plunge, whether it be selfishness or simply the ever-relative feelings of retribution. These classic films pose some intriguing questions. Does real evil exist and assuming it does why should we care about what it thinks? or worse yet how we may actually see ourselves in their errors? Why can't we just put them in films and let their actions speak for themselves and let their consequences carry the audience toward a satisfying feeling of payback or resolution?

This story is about an old man released from jail and attempting to live his life plagued with guilt and hopelessness. He is a sad, indirectly sorry, unrealistic and profoundly disturbed character. He is misled and careless to everything around him. The kind of person we want to ignore completely and not know anything about. The kind of person whose motivations when taken into account entirely, make many of us cringe and want to warehouse him and others of his ilk in the demonic subculture of the American Correctional Facilities. But Noe takes a different approach completely. He not only engages this character but he refuses to sympathize, he just shows us what makes him tick. The film serves as a sort of diary for this character and shows us little in way of hope. He shows us a man who rationalizes every single dark thought and action he completes regardless of the fact that they are all so impulsive, primal and damaging to everything and everyone around him.

What Noe seems to understand is that the world is not always black or white, good or evil; but sometimes evil and more evil, pitch black and even darker. So here we can attempt to understand why a man would have a difficult decision to make between rape or murder, no matter how scary this proposition may sound to us. If you dare to take yourself into this character's mind then you may begin to realize that sympathy for anyone with even the potential to be like this is probably pointless, but your opinions are your own observations.

Keep in mind that Noe is not an advocate for his dark characters, he is really just a host. There are no messages in his film beyond how ugly life is in some circles. I'm not sure he means to say that life is as pointless as it seems here and in Irreversible. The film is definitely not for everyone; in fact chances are you will hate it very much but if you make similar observations that I have made after watching a movie than please go right ahead, but be careful. The film does contain some extreme violence and a brief pornographic sequence that appears on a TV screen, so be wary of these elements as well.",1079308800,15,3582,4.662974683544304
1619106,5,B00005K9O8,"When I recently viewed Gaspar Noe's film ""Irreversible,"" I noticed with interest a scene at the beginning of the movie where an elderly man waxes philosophic about the various problems in his life to another poor soul while both men sit in a filthy, cramped room. I chuckled inwardly about Noe's in joke since anyone who has seen ""I Stand Alone"" recognizes the elderly gent with a bad attitude as none other than the suicidal butcher, the main character in this gripping film about the psychological free fall of a man with nothing left to lose in life. If I had to compare ""Irreversible"" with ""I Stand Alone,"" I would definitely pick ""Irreversible"" as the better of the two in nearly every aspect of filmmaking, but ""I Stand Alone"" is a memorable experience nonetheless. If you thought watching Monica Bellucci suffer indignity after indignity was bad, you should watch the last twenty minutes of ""I Stand Alone"" for a whole knew outlook on what constitutes ""disturbing."" Gaspar Noe is quickly turning into my favorite ""foreign"" film director. I can't wait to see what he comes up with next.
The plot of ""I Stand Alone"" is frighteningly simple. The main character is an unemployed butcher, middle aged, whose life is one long series of disappointments. We learn he is the son of a French communist executed by the Nazis who eventually married, had a child, and lost his business after he killed a man he mistakenly assumed had brutalized his daughter. The incident sent his young child over the edge mentally, requiring her to check in for a lengthy stay at the local mental motel. The butcher, now on the ropes emotionally and recently released from prison, leaves his child behind to take up with an obnoxious woman and her overbearing mother because of a vague promise made by said woman to set our hero up in the meat business again. Sadly, this woman becomes pregnant and begins to berate the butcher about his taciturn nature, using the excuse of being with child to get what she wants from the relationship. The constant pressures of unemployment and the nagging from his woman causes the butcher to snap; he beats the pregnant woman viciously, and then flees when he worries that he has killed his unborn child and could again end up in prison for his actions.
Heading back to Paris and points north, the butcher wanders through the blasted landscapes of a France never seen in travel brochures. As he roams around with a diminishing supply of money and no job prospects, meeting old friends that refuse to help him and sleeping in pay by the day rat holes, the butcher engages the audience through a largely internal monologue that wallows in misogyny, racism, nihilism, and general misanthropy. This guy hates everyone and everything; he feels that the whole world is out to dump on him and seeks to pay back all of his enemies in the most vicious of ways. When he procures a gun with a few bullets in it, he begins formulating elaborate plans for bloody revenge. He'll kill the smug jerk that refused to give him a job, the man at the bar who gave him some grief over the tab, and anyone else that gets in his way. The butcher finally decides to pay a visit to his daughter since he hasn't seen her in ages, and it is during this visit that ""I Stand Alone"" enters its final, most horrific stage. Nothing will prepare you for the terrible final moments of Noe's movie. It's deeply disturbing, sick, morally reprehensible, and just plain nasty. Come to think of it, the whole movie is an exercise in depravity virtually certain to give most mainstream viewers conniption fits.
The best elements of ""I Stand Alone"" have little to do with the lengthy dialogue of the mad butcher or his rambling journeys through Paris. After awhile you get used to the run down buildings, the litter clogged streets, and the redundant blatherings of the butcher. You probably won't feel too much pity for the guy after awhile anyway, seeing as how he's such a sick, hateful soul full of loathing for his fellow man (and women, especially women). What does strike a chord is how Noe portrays this unpleasant chap. Noe rubs your nose in this guy's misery to such an extent that you shudder to think there are people like the butcher around us every day, adrift in their frustrated lives and ready to explode at any minute. In an effort to bring home the gut wrenching stresses in the butcher's existence, the director employs an unusual but very effective extreme focus camera technique--accompanied by a dramatic thudding sound--at certain important points throughout the film. There's even a flashing sign towards the end warning the viewer the movie is about to take an extreme turn just in case you wish to switch the whole thing off. Brilliant!
A few caveats are necessary with ""I Stand Alone."" The conclusion of the film, with its graphic violence and whirlwind dialogue, will upset viewers unaccustomed to such things. Moreover, at one point in the movie the butcher sits in an adult movie theater to be alone with his frustration. That's not too bad in and of itself since we already know the thought processes of the butcher, but we get an eyeful of the definitely XXX rated movie playing on the screen. If pornography really bothers you, take a pass on ""I Stand Alone."" I, however, thought Noe's a film a brilliant piece of cinema exploring the dark recesses of a man on the verge of a suicidal breakdown. If that sounds appealing to you, certainly give this one a glance. Then watch ""Irreversible.""",1078531200,191,5498,4.710280373831775

1619110,4,B00005K9O8,"""The tragedy of a jobless butcher struggling to survive in the bowels of his nation"" says the script at the beginning of Gaspar Noe's I STAND ALONE.
The movie is the tale of a horsemeat butcher, the son of a French Communist & solo parent to a mute daughter; with whom he has an incestuous relationship. The first five minutes of the film has him telling his background & history.(The majority of the film is told as a first person narrative, with little actual spoken dialogue.) He is unable to get a steady job as a butcher because the simple act of smiling and being friendly to cusomters is next to impossible to him, so he winds up sitting around watching TV all day. His home life is lousy: he lives with his elderly mother & his wife, who miscarries after he kicks her in the stomach (presumably) because of his fear of them producing another disabled child. To escape from this cesspool which makes Robert Crumb's home life look like the stuff of cookies -&- milk style 50's suburbia , he goes to a sleazy hotel- where he always rents the same room: a room that holds special memories for him. The room in which his daughter was conceived.
And it is in this room where life REALLY starts for him. On this day, January 3, 1980 The Butcher makes the decision to start his life over again. He has with him a gun, and three bullets. And sets off on an odyssey of vengeance against those who have looked down on him and made his meager existance all the more miserable. Three bullets. Three deaths. How will he make the right decision?
Noe slowly but surely builds the tension until your heart is pounding in your throat & the blood is pounding in your temples.
Noe also does a ""William Castle"" &, as a prelude to the film's ultra-violent climax viewers are given 30 seconds to leave the theatre; only this is no gimmick. The ending even had my stomach in knots. Naturally this wil anger the SPCS. IT'S JUST A MOVIE!
Sometimes to put across a message of MORALITY you must show IMMORALITY, to convey an ANTI-VIOLENCE message then violence of the most graphic and disturbing nature must be portrayed. And that is exactly what Noe has done here. I STAND ALONE is certainly not for the faint-hearted. Noe is indisputably a master film maker. He has crafted a technically briliant film which is powerful, literate and compelling. Highly recommended. I hope IRREVERSIBLE comes to Dunedin soon. I'm really keen to see it now. As for David Lane, he really needs to find something more productive to do. The SPCS must be shut down once and for all.",1059955200,11,2542,4.516268980477223

The story goes with empty and bleak atmosphere from start to end. But strangely enough, I ended up to sense some sort of feeling of Love. The sound of gunshots in between scenes has been haunting me. That makes me nervous, and at the same time, sensitive.

1619124,1,B00005K9O8,"Blurbs at the time convinced me this movie was going to be another `Taxi Driver.' Bad marketing there (well, but it got me into the theater, didn't it?).  This movie is about the most bitter man alive, a butcher with a face like hamburger whose mind is 24-7 going through the meat grinder.  He hates everybody he sees, but seems to hold a spot of regret for his institutionalized daughter.  After watching him beat a pregnant woman and hear him hope she loses her baby (NOT his words), then threaten to kill the middle eastern son of a bartender(in a scene which I must admit is a brilliant example of the character's frustration, he goes home to get his gun and comes back to find the bar closed - Ha!), we would think that the butcher's daughter will offer him some kind of redemption in the end - WRONG AGAIN!  The ending is here delayed by an on screen message, replete with countdown, which says something to the effect of `you have 30 seconds to leave the theater.'  While this elicited several nervous chuckles from the audience I saw it with, nobody was laughing at what followed - a graphic bit of violent Ragu spatter death which turns out to be a fantasy.  But this graphic suicide-murder would have been a better ending than what follows - a father groping his daughter in a pullback shot remisnicent of a Hollywood ending where the couple winds up together.  Ugh.  Maybe this is funny if you're idea of a good belly laugh is watching `Salo,' but after one viewing I'd had enough.  Yes its filmed well, yes its mildly funny in places (the scene where the owner of the meat store tells the butcher he can keep his job if he smiles just once and the butcher just stares at him with that made-eyed pug face is pretty hilarious), but ultimately this isn't really worth it.  Its not the most shocking thing I've ever seen, and the characters are ultimately forgettable.  If you want to be depressed and maybe angered or sickened, go ahead, but I like to think that we can find enlightenment through cinema without being plunged in irredeemable darkness.  Artists have a responsibility as human beings to use their talents to better the world.  Movies like this just add to the rubbish.  Maybe Travis Bickle isn't any kind of model either, but I'll take him over the butcher any day.",1047340800,6,2289,4.537712895377129

The tragedy is, being blunt with the violence of another Madman jousts makes this film fall into the trash bin.  I cannot express the sadness of how tasteless the film became.  Incest and a surprise ending to a murder - suicide ending which was fantasy????  This is no, ""400 Blows"" here.  Films like Spanking the Monkey dealt with evils like incest a bit better than this did.  Many great gore films like ""Natural Born Killers"", ""Taxi Driver"" took the leap of faith that good film makers can take even trash to the can and deliver a great film.  I Stand Alone scene when our loser beats his wife and her unborn child to almost death gave me the writing on the wall here and does exactly that, it stands alone as a total disappointment to cinema!

1619126,4,B00005K9O8,"... Interestingly, no one has mentioned about the soundtrack of this film.  May be it's me, who has the incurable soundtrack fanatism, but this film has one of the best soundtracks.  I mean the song that plays in two scenes: at the beginning when the narrator tells the lifestory of the buthcer, and the secondly at the end credits.  Gaspar Noe likes to underline the main theme of his films with majestic classics of Baroque times.  He did the same in his latest film, ""Irreversable"" with Beethoven's 7th.
In this film, that song, which sounds like a war theme from the Baroque times, fits very nicely, although the film has got nothing to do with Baroque times.  I would normally guess that such a song would fit to films like Barry Lyndon of Kubrick.  But, Noe used it in his extremely nihilistic film.
...As for the movie, I should confess I was expecting something very different, especially after the supern opening scene abotu MORALITY.  The way it opened, made me expect something like a French version of ""Pulp Fiction"".  But, no, this is a very different film.  A film about a looser man, a butcher, who lost most of his life's meaning, and getting closer to even worse days.  Noe makes us feel more than a simple movie audience.  he makes us travel through this man's brain, thoughts, and feelings.  You feel his dark thoughts, gradual ruining, and his rather pervert thoughts.  With the much talked ""Irreversable"", Noe successfully managed to let us feel the very dark sides of human life.  I wonder if he shall continue like this, or, will he use his ability to let us see other sides of human life.
The darkness of the film's atmosphere is quite understandable, but the scene where the butcher shoots his daughter in his dreams has more than necessary amount of gore.  I am not sure why we had to see the blood spurting from the girl's throat in such a long time.  That was the most negative part of this film, way too much for a film.
Another interesting point: we see that Noe carried the buthcer's story into his next film ""Inreversable"".  In the first opening part of Irreversable, we see the same man sitting in a room with another man, and discussing why he was kept in jail for raping his own daughter. So, he used a small nice touch of connecting the two films, saying us ""the story of the loosers still continues"".  Also, the fast movement of the camera is another method that Noe extends into ""Irrevesable"" from ""I stand Alone"".
For those who likes the etreme drama of dark films and their looser anti-heros, this is a good film, but for those expecting a regular studio action, I recommend you pass this along.",1042329600,3,2635,4.582089552238806

This bitterness eventually grow to obsessive hatred.  One day he finds himself in a situation where he cannot control his self-obsession and as a result he explodes.  I Stand Alone is evidently a rather disturbing portrait of a middle-aged man's contempt for society, which is depicted through racing monologues where reflections of actual thought and action seem to be irrelevant.

This is a very, very, very good movie though.  The performances and direction were stellar and while the voice-over was an effective way of aiding the viewer in understanding the protagonist it was a tad annoying from time to time.
Judging by the reactions of the other reviewers perhaps I'm a tad more desensitized than the average person so this film might be the most horrible thing you've ever seen.

All of No's films contain no more than 2 violent scenes but the rest of it is extremely oppressing (he and his wife use to argue about not falling into Truffaut clichs) - and if the point is to shock the public, I've never seen it done in such an inteligent and pointful way. It has been said that his films are immoral and push people to immoral thoughts - I don't think so. The situations are often extreme but their dark side is close to that of Peckinpah's films: it is never gratuitous.
