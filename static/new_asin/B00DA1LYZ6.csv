8591064,4,B00DA1LYZ6,"A few months ago I helped a couple from Hong Kong find the Chihuly Glass Museum at Seattle Center. They had come to Seattle because the wife was bitten by the Seattle Bug. She was one of millions of Chinese who made the award-winning ""Bei Jing yu shang Xi Ya Tu"" (English captions) one of the highest-grossing romances in Chinese history. Naturally I was curious, so I got my own copy as soon as I could spot it in the catalogs. The one I have is in Region 3 format, but the Blu-Ray comes in Region 1.

I soon became intrigued by Jiajia, a city girl from Beijing, come to Seattle to bear an American-born son for her wealthy, MARRIED, boyfriend back in China. She picked Seattle because ""Sleepless in Seattle"" is her favorite film of all time; she has an unlimited credit card and an imperious attitude. She has made plans to stay in a private home with two other Asian women awaiting the birth of their babies. With establishing shots of Seattle (the rest filmed in Vancouver, BC), I enjoyed seeing our waterfront and of course, our iconic Space Needle.

First we meet Frank, the fellow who had been assigned the task of bringing her in from the airport (he's a bit late); he is polite, hard working and self-effacing. Next we meet her Seattle landlady, the two other women, Frank's tween-age daughter, his wife and the doctor Jiajia has selected simply because she speaks Chinese. Jiajia is rude, demanding and selfish.

As her fortunes wax and wane, so do her relationships, in this sweet romantic comedy. I became invested in the outcome and was glad I own this DVD. The first part is difficult to watch simply because she is such a pill, but when she hits a speed bump, the story gains traction.

There is no rating, but in my opinion this would be a solid PG-13. I recall no profanity, no vehicular mayhem, no gunfire and no blowie uppie stuff. A sweet clichd ending guarantees that a good time is had by all!",1445731200,3,1915,4.494252873563219
8591065,4,B00DA1LYZ6,"It is a Chinese attempt at an American RomCom. I think it mostly succeeded. There were a couple of unexpected twists. The movie hinges on the likeability of the star, Tang Wei (though her character has some flaws). I bought into her immediately.",1443139200,,245,4.72093023255814
8591066,4,B00DA1LYZ6,"This was an entertaining movie.  I've find myself watching moreforeign films of late, because they are where we used to be before CGI and excessive explosions.",1437609600,3,159,5.115384615384615
8591067,4,B00DA1LYZ6,"I watched this movie on a long flight back from Singapore and had the usual low expectations. This romantic comedy set in Seattle, however, caught me by surprise. The acting for both romantic leads was very good to excellent and the storyline is entirely believable. The only small negative was the entirely predictable and Hollywood ending that was over the top in melodrama.",1386460800,7,376,4.984126984126984
