7607372,5,B01AOELOF6,I saw Until Forever in the theaters and it is an incredible true story of faith and hope! This movie is full of light! Don't be scared away by the subject matter. You might think you've seen a film like this before but I promise you that you have not! This film truly captures the hope that surpasses anything that we will ever experience here on Earth! Kudos to the filmmakers and the actors for telling this story in a way that is honest and true to life! Writer/Director Michael Linn and producer Bonnie Boyum have created an intimate look into what goes on behind-the-scenes as families struggle through crisis. The film has awesome performances and Stephen Bailey nails the emotional gamut in playing Michael. There is humor amidst the pain and the film is able to seemingly shift effortlessly in it's tone from one scene to the next. Great film! A must watch!,1493683200,3,865,4.623376623376624
7607373,5,B01AOELOF6,I love this movie.  The acting in this movie was exceptional.  The story was truly inspiring and it is the first movie I have seen where I thought about it for days afterwards.  It made a big impact on me.  A must see!!!!  The Pig Mobile was right outside of the theater when we were waiting in line to get in.  The lead actor was at the showing that we went to.  He was standing in the hall when we left the theater.,1493596800,2,417,3.9518072289156625
7607374,5,B01AOELOF6,A wonderfully put together movie that defies the stereotype of a Christian movie. It shows a realistic look at how people lives and faith grow and change through illness.,1493596800,3,170,4.896551724137931
7607375,5,B01AOELOF6,"Until Forever is a movie that will capture your heart from the minute it starts to play, and stays with you well after the credits have ended. It is a story of a young man who had so much life to live, so many hearts to touch for the Lord, and yet his life was not to be on this earth for as long as he would have thought. The Lord had other plans for Michael Boyum, plans that would include him spending every moment he had here on earth living for the Lord in such an impactful way that his work here on earth did not end when he went to be with the Lord. Until Forever truly is the right title for this movie, because Michael's life will touch people forever. His brother Matthew's story within the movie touches those who fight yet a different battle, and these brothers lives are truly a beautiful example of how the Lord works in each of us. We all fight different battles, and yet the Lord is still with each of us.

Thank you to the entire Boyum family for sharing this gift with everyone. For telling their family's story...for this is truly not simply about Michael, it is about the grace and strength the Lord gives right when we need it the most, the peace that only He can bring, and the blessings and healing that can come in each of our lives. We may never truly understand why the Lord chooses to do things the way he does, but He knows, and His plan is always perfect.

Until Forever, until we all meet again in the Lord's kingdom, until our bodies leave this earth and join the Lord, until we die, we must live.

I can promise you, this movie will change your life forever.",1473552000,10,1591,4.19281045751634
7607376,5,B01AOELOF6,"I was honored to be at the premiere.  The Boyum family are friends and what you see in the movie is true.  Michael was an amazing young man who loved life and loved his Lord.  It is a must see movie.  The movie is encouraging, full of joy and love.  You will enjoy it and will watch it over and over.  Stephen Bailey who plays Michael Boyum was wonderful.

7607387,5,B01AOELOF6,"This movie is heart-warming and uplifting, yet truly entertaining . You might expect the story of a young man with cancer to be a downer, but it is not.  A delightful love story,  faith-based and also fun to watch.",1525219200,,214,4.461538461538462
7607388,1,B01AOELOF6,Love Story was so sweet... Could have been a great film if they had a better director and better actors. Oh and left our the whole jesus loves you thing every of scene.,1525046400,2,168,4.121212121212121
7607389,1,B01AOELOF6,"Religious propaganda.  One guy was able to remain loving and positive despite his dying of cancer.  Guess what?  Atheists can be that way too. This is just a conversion thing with a lot of high reviews from religious people.  We'd be better off trying to do good for people and the planet without trying to convert people to a religion.
Annoyed that because I watched a movie about cancer, Amazon recommended this movie also with a character who has cancer but is really trying to get people to be more into God. Waste of my two hours.  I watched the whole thing so I could write a review.  Slow, drawn-out.  Once you figure out it's about religion, it really drags on and on, every scene twice as long as it needs to be. People sad but ""god"" makes them feel better.  Stupid and boring.",1524700800,6,786,4.409722222222222

7607393,5,B01AOELOF6,"We sometimes equate God's love as answering our prayers, but God has an ultimate plan for our lives. He uses each and everyone of us, to fulfill His plan. Even in death...we can have a profound impact on the people around us who are still left on earth. Our time here on earth is so short, but an eternity with God is forever. Great movie and I love they didn't sugarcoat the truth! :)",1523750400,,385,4.216216216216216
7607394,5,B01AOELOF6,"Yes I have. I've witnessed cancer. Beat cancer. Seen family pass away caused and due to cancer. Said goodbye to cancer afflicted friends. This movie shows how faith and love together conquer, defeat and open new avenues for everyone who chooses to risk, believe, love, cherish and hold true to the fact there is more to this universe than these individually, uncombined, can deliver.",1523664000,,383,5.0

7607405,3,B01AOELOF6,"The story is great, the film production, not so much.  I almost quit watching it in the first few minutes.  This has got to be one of the WORST production and editing jobs ever.  The music is so loud and you can't hear the narration or the actors speaking.  You turn the volume up to hear them and you get blasted with the music (which is horrible) or the background noises they add.  You almost need to watch it with closed captioning.  The acting is so so and the dialogue could use some tweaking in parts.  The overall story though, especially with it being true, is lovely, touching, and a great story.  Just sucks they did such a bad job on the sound or it would've gotten more than 3 stars.  I almost gave it less because of that.",1521849600,2,736,4.237410071942446

7607414,1,B01AOELOF6,"It was a sweet Christian romance, but at the same time, it was contrived, didactic, and even disjointed in the various elements it was trying to portray. It did not ring true to life. If you're just looking for a feel-good confirmation of shallow idealism parading as deep and powerful, you might really enjoy it. If you're looking for a moving and meaningful challenge, don't bother.",1518739200,,384,4.833333333333333

7607420,5,B01AOELOF6,Watched this with my 8 year old daughter who loves romance movies.  What a blessing to find a movie that centers on one thing: the One who is perfect Love.

7607422,5,B01AOELOF6,"Wow, what a beautiful life story for these families!  Thank you for your obedience to God in sharing it with the world to help others.  Today I attended a birthday celebration with my family for a woman that has been battling brain cancer literally since her birthday last year.  I worked in radiology at the time of the surgery and sat front row as she went through the first stages.  She is on hospice now and not speaking but teared up as we sang her happy birthday from her bed.  It was so touching and I know I probably won't see her again on earth, but in God's timing I want to share this story with family members that are struggling with their faith because of her terminal illness.  I work in mental health now and appreciated the honesty of Michael's brother Matt sharing about his battle with depression and suicidal thoughts.  I'm so grateful he grew closer to God and pray he's doing well. It's amazing that I happened to watch this exact movie when I got home from the celebration.

The mom of Michael Boyum in real life pushed for so many years since his death to have his story told.  At the end, there are clips of the real Michael Boyum, Michelle, and his family. Likely, you will cry at points throughout this movie.

BOTTOMLINE:  This is an inspirational, tearjerker, 'make you think here and there' movie.  It struck just the right balance on being a film that would appeal to both Christians and non-Christians.  This was really hard to do and very important, if I understand correctly, to truly honor the way that Michael saw God, as depicted in this story.",1515628800,7,732,4.635658914728682

I would give it 5 stars because in reality, it was an amazing movie. Great acting in my opinion. Gave it four stars because although it applied to the movie completely, and I understand why it is in it, because of my personal values I just wish everything didn't have to do with God and faith.

7607468,5,B01AOELOF6,"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much when we started this movie. ""Inspirational"" can be a buzz word that means poorly-made and very cheesy or over-the-top preachy. ""Until Forever"" was NOT the typical make you want to barf Christian flick. Part of it was a very well-written script. Another was excellent, subtle acting. Editing, filming, music, all were really well done. Based on a true-story, my husband and I were impressed with how thought-provoking it was in the true-to life questions that are asked as the protagonists face cancer and loss. The way their relationship is portrayed contains a lot of depth that draws viewers into the story. Would like to see more movies made like this one--maybe not quite so sad, though!!! It reminded me a little bit of Nicholas Sparks's ""A Walk to Remember"" and the movie ""The Fault in Our Stars"", though in many ways, this film is much stronger in terms of the depth of the characters that are portrayed.",1510876800,7,945,4.839506172839506

Many times when families are going through a rough time people just reach out to the parents. The other siblings are lost, fighting the battle in their own way. But we hurt too and have just as difficult of a time time dealing with the battle. I really like how this movie drove that point home very clearly.

My personal experience with cancer came several years ago when a business customer in Alaska came down to
Seattle where I lived. His little 4 year old daughter had cancer. They spent several weeks at Seattle Children's Hospital.
He was a great guy and had a wonderful family, but their poor little girl passed away. He called me and shared the information
that they didn't think she would make it. I gave him as much comfort as I could, but this is something he and his family will
never forget. It is so sad when children get so sick. RIP little one. At that time he also had a 13 year old son.

7607541,5,B01AOELOF6,"Wonderful movie. It had touched me personally because I lost my father to ALS about 10 days ago. This movie touched me because it remind me that there are NO ORDINARY MOMENTS IN THE PRESENT. My Dad lived with ALS for 4 years since diagnosis, plus the 1 year of constant medical testing that resulted in the diagnosis. This movie remind me that LIFE ITSELF is our teacher. In its ups and downs, we focus on the problems. My dad continued his professional life until he passed away; the muscular deterioration from below the neck was 99% gone, he only controlled 2 fingers in his left hand -- still he persisted going to work because of the satisfaction it provided, the autonomy, the feeling of being useful to his co-workers by imparting his industry knowledge.

My real gratitude goes to Bonnie Boyum, for producing this movie and sharing her family's experience and the life lessons learned.

From my Dad, I learned exactly the message taken from the movie: We truly have no control of our bodies, only the perception that our mind processes from life's obstacles faced --- the thing [obstacle] itself does not matter, it is a gift in desguise, making us grateful to have overcome the low points that life's obstacle enforced upon us.

Believing that Jesus is our Savior will give us an Eternal life when we pass over. We are here to make our own decision as to whether we accept him or not . During this time there can be pain, health problems, and yes death. But all those things are NOT caused by God. There from Evil. God will give us new bodies without any illness or Death for all Eternity after we pass over. A lot of the evil is caused by mortal human beings that make the wrong decisions.

7607576,4,B01AOELOF6,"Ok, who wanted to put a knot on the old mans head and say, ' listen, Jesus is Lord! Get over it already '. ha ha, anyway... I thought Michael, at first, handled the situation very well. Then it seemed that he leaned more to the, *just trying to get along with others*. But, one thing I believe did ring true, is that God honored his faith, trust and belief in him, regardless.
I think it's a great story... the only reason I knocked off the one star, is because it seemed like at one point in the movie, Michael or someone or the story line started trying to *sell* Jesus instead of uh, what's the word, *sharing the truth with someone*, may be a good way of putting it. Yeh, I really appreciated the way Michael dealt with the older guy, but still I think something more bold should have taken place, maybe just a little more than Michael came across. I just didn't want to honor all of this movie with 5 stars as though this is the way I believe 100% it should be done. I honestly think Michael got it maybe 90 percent right, which is really good.
Ok! Anyway.... healing? Why doesn't God heal some people? And you know, I don't believe there is one time in the Bible or New Testament rather, that I can recall, where someone *wasn't* healed. Sooo, Why? Well, maybe we're some pretty messed up people now days and God refuses to or rather, can't find it within his will to. It's a, not him, us, type deal.... Sooo, that should leave someone with something to ponder over. Actually, there was one time God didn't heal someone, Lazarus. If I remember the story correctly, Jesus knew of his being ill, but didn't come to him in time to heal him before he died. That I believe was to God's glory, and his will that Lazarus be raised from the dead instead.",1498953600,5,1752,4.2960725075528705

7607579,5,B01AOELOF6,"I was impressed with the quality and realism of this film. The acting is natural and well done and the story itself is compelling and appropriately but deeply emotional. I was especially struck by its ability to capture the problem of evil and the nuances and struggles of practical Christian belief in a world that often seems devoid of meaning and purpose. Films like this one transcend the typical ""feel good"" Christian movie genre.",1496361600,,435,4.891891891891892

7607582,5,B01AOELOF6,"Until Forever  is one of those movies that you remember for a long time after you see it. We saw the film at a neighborhood center where a crowd of teenagers was asked for their opinions of the film. Uniformly they all loved the film. Some loved the descriptions of tragedy; others the dynamics between the young couple, and still others the way that faith carried the family through.
 This is a video which should be saved for reviewing at the time of family gatherings  to re-create the warm feeling that the movie brings To all who see it.",1493856000,7,542,4.454545454545454

If Tyler Perry movies were 5 stars which they are, this movie is only a 2. It tries to have a debate about the existence of God while using the strongest argument from only one side which made this movie mainly a religious propaganda overshadowing any moral lesson it may have. What a shame! My OCD made me finish the whole movie because of the good hook in the beginning.",1531180800,2,610,4.554545454545455
