8060279,5,B0009GV9IW,"This is not an instructional DVD for beginners. Learning the pieces will also be extremely difficult for those whose guitars aren't playable from the nut to the 15th fret. (I had to take mine to a luthier to have some upper register fretwork done.)

That being said, diligence and hard work will pay off greatly. Each of the selections is a masterpiece.

I wish the music/Tab included the entire performance Martin plays to start each section. I've looped the video trying to catch some of his tricks but it will likely be years before I can approach the level of Martin's playing.",1364601600,5,581,4.686274509803922
