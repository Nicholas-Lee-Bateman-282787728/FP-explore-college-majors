1332702,5,B00003TKFB,"This show is one of the most original yet familiar shows that I have seen in the last five years.  Diana Rigg is glorious as Mrs. Bradley, and Neil Dudgeon is brilliant as her side kick and possible paramour, George Moody.  The BBC-America recently showed four more episodes, and they lived up to this original pilot.  Highly recommended!",969840000,3,338,4.793103448275862

1332704,5,B00003TKFB,"Very entertaining if you like a good mystery.  Diane Riggs smartly plays a Mrs. Adela Bradley who travels with her dependable chauffeur George to Chayning Court to attend  an engagement party for her god-daughter,  Eleanor.  Only this party brings murder instead of merry.  Eleanor's fiance  is the unfortunate corpse and we have a sorted cast of characters  who are  all suspects.  Mrs. Bradley, with the help of George, work to solve the  puzzle.  There are a couple very interesting revelations.  And learning the  identity of the killer in the end may prove surprising.  But the mystery is  not exactly over when one thinks it is. The setting is in the 1920's, and  the costumes and music of the era present nicely to the viewer's escape.  Also, the show was shot on film and not on video as is sometimes done in  these series. Therefore the cinematagraphy in this mystery is rich and has  depth.  The location is pretty, full of countryside greens.  A pleasure to  watch.",953424000,39,976,4.753012048192771

1332763,4,B00003TKFB,"Gladys Mitchell was a prolific writer whose best-remembered heroine, Mrs. Adela Bradley, featured in a whopping 66 detective novels and several short stories, beginning with Speedy Death in 1929 and ending with The Crozier Pharaohs, published posthumously in 1984. The BBC chose Speedy Death to kick off its television series of five adaptations in 1998. I have not read the books, but I gather that the films are not especially faithful. Dame Diana Rigg stars as middle-aged divorce Mrs. Adela Bradley, open-minded to the point of scandal, who, with the aid of her chauffer George Moody (Neil Dudgeon), solves crimes in England between the wars. Mrs. Bradley is described by the (fictional) Times as one of the countrys foremost criminologists and psychoanalysts. Her mind and her deeds are widely admired. Her enemy is boredom. Detective Inspector Christmas (Peter Davison) is a recurring character, always appreciative of Mrs. Bradleys assistance, if not Georges.

The episodes feature over-the-top storylines, ridiculous solutions, and some elements (e.g. hypnotism) that seem hokier now than they was intended in the 1930s. But they have in common with many BBC mysteries of this era an engaging group of supporting characters and excellent cast. Diana Riggs delivery of editorial comments directly to the camera is natural enough to be charming rather than grating. The working class, loyal, always game George Moody is a terrific foil for the rich, intellectual, and worldly Mrs. Bradley. Diana Rigg was 60 years old, when she did this series about a decade too old for the role, but her delivery is strong, no matter how silly the lines or far-fetched the mystery. Mrs. Bradley and George are fun to watch. If you're looking for a sharp-tongued, liberal-minded, well-dressed, crime-fighting woman of the 1920s, Mrs. Bradley is more authentic and less smarmy, despite her tone, than the more recent Miss Fishers Murder Mysteries (2012).

The episodes are:

In Speedy Death, Mrs. Bradley attends the funeral of her estranged husband. She addresses the camera directly, when she calls him a bore. She pays a visit to her goddaughter Eleanor Bing (Emma Fielding), recently engaged to be married to adventurer Everard Mountjoy (William Oxborrow). Eleanor is the daughter of an old flame, Alistair Bing (John Alderton) and has been confined to a wheelchair since an auto accident that was the fault of family friend Bertie Phillipson (Tom Butcher). Eleanor is upset when Bertie arrives for dinner as a guest of her brother Garde (Tristan Gemmill), who has also brought his gold-digging fiance Dorothy Manners (Eleanor Tremain), of whom father does not approve. But Everard doesnt make the engagement party. He drowns in the bath.

Death at the Opera brings Mrs. Bradley and George to Hadleigh Heights Academy, the finishing school which Mrs. Bradley reluctantly attended in her youth, run by Dr. (Roy Barraclough) and Mrs. Simms (Susan Wooldridge). Mrs. Bradley is guest of honor at a student performance of The Mikado. It is interrupted, however, by the death of Miss Ferris (Elaine Claxton), the schools art teacher, of an apparent heart attack in her dressing room. It appears to be natural causes, but the deceased scratched varnish off the door before she died, as if trying to get out. Mrs. Bradley questions teachers Mona Bunting (Annabelle Apsion) and Max Valentine (David Tennant), who is using a false identity, and grows fond of Plum (Carli Norris), a scholarship student and aspiring novelist.

Inspector Christmas (Peter Davison) interrupts Mrs. Bradleys dinnertime flirtation to ask for her help in solving a case in The Rising of the Moon. Celestine Venus (Sheila Steafel), a Romany woman who plays the target in the knife-throwing act in a traveling circus, has been stabbed to death by persons unknown, while the fire-eater was on stage. The circus has set up its tents in the quintessential English village, where the townspeople dislike them, or pretend to. Town Councilman John Forrester (Nicholas Woodeson) is under pressure to evict them. The temperamental knife-thrower and Celestines sometime lover Castries (Francis Magee) is immediately suspected of the murder. But Mrs. Bradley thinks the respectable townspeople merit investigation.

Mrs. Bradley is invited by Lady Isobel Marchant (Phyllida Law), a old friend and widow who lost 3 sons in the War, to visit her unhappy estate in Laurels Are Poison. All seems well, as Isobels surviving child Lacey Prideux (Joanna Roth) is expecting her second child with husband Capt. Douglas Prideux (Ronan Vibert), an aloof man haunted by the War. But the handsome, insolent gardener Seth Billings (Stuart Bunce) lords over his employers and staff alike, and no one tries to stop him. George recognizes Capt. Douglas as the officer under whose command his brother was killed in the War and becomes angry. When the cook Mrs. Parkin (Michele Dotrice) dies of poison, mysteriously missing her corset, Mrs. Bradley rocks the houses precarious equilibrium.

Mrs. Bradley travels to the seaside town where Inspector Christmas intends to retire and where Georges daughter Cecily (Rebecca Callard) works as a hotel maid in The Worsted Viper. George learns of Cecilys engagement to the hotels manager Mr. Ronald Quincy (Eddie Marsan), son of the hotels owner Mrs. Myrtle Quincy (Isla Blair). Mrs. Bradley surprises Inspector Christmas by presenting a medal of honor, but the ceremony is interrupted when young Temperance Baines (Charlotte Francis) pulls her father away. Reverend Baines (John Bowe) grown daughter Chastity is dead, tangled in the fish nets, a stuffed snake around her neck. It reminds Mrs. Bradley of the case of Blackjack Briggs, executed years ago for his ritual murders of three virginal young women.",1475366400,,5778,5.24

1332839,3,B00003TKFB,"Poor director decision.  Saw the pilot and it is an enjoyable and well-acted movie, but the decision to have the main character repeatedly address the audience is just wrong.  The cardinal sin of movie-making is making the viewer aware of the camera and there is no better way to do that than to have an actor speak directly to the camera. It breaks the movie spell.  I wonder if this off-putting technique is one reason the series did not last.",1383177600,,445,4.5375
1332870,2,B00003TKFB,"I usually like BBC mysteries and Diana Rigg so I looked forward to seeing the ""Mrs. Bradley Mysteries"". I found them very disappointing. The Characters were weak and even Diana Rigg couldn't make Mrs. Bradley very likeable.",1382832000,,223,5.054054054054054

1332872,2,B00003TKFB,"I love Diana Rigg, but this series is just silly.  Poirot and Miss Marple are not violent, but are serious stories, usually, with characters who are serious and dedicated to the elmination of evil.  This is more along the lines of a comedy Murder-She-Wrote. It's more tongue-in-cheek, and because it is so silly, it is hard to pay attention waiting for something to happen.  My husband and I do not like the overly violent shows, but we like our mysteries to be a little bit more serious.",1368230400,,488,4.586206896551724

Neil Dudgeon is great fun as George and the two have a wonderful chemistry.

1332876,5,B00003TKFB,"I do love the way Adel Bradley talks to the camera, One feels included in her understanding of human nature.
The relationship between her and her chauffeur is a delight. Neil Dudgeon plays the chauffeurs role with sympathy, vulnerability and humour. Dame Diana was an inspired  choice for this character and has you nodding and smiling with her sagacious remarks. Also at times one feels she is impatient with some of the characters and then she surprises you with great tenderness.
The Peter Davison character, inspector Christmas, was a knockout surprise in the last episode. He is always a fond memory of Dr, Who days and his character is just so different in this series.",1353024000,5,675,4.869565217391305

1332878,3,B00003TKFB,"I am a huge Diana Rigg fan, so, that being said, I cannot give anything she ever did less than 3 stars. The production and acting were fine. The problem is that the plot and solution were so obvious to me. There was one plot twist about the murder victim at the beginning, but with the only twist being in the first 15 minutes, I was not exactly on the edge of my seat. I did not expect high action or anything, but it was just too predictable to make it very interesting. I would never tell a Rigg fan to skip it completely, but why buy it instead of renting? Through it into the player again in 10 years, and I will immediately remember being a bit bored my the mystery aspect again. There was really no mystery with it all being that obvious.",1349308800,,745,4.144827586206897

1332918,4,B00003TKFB,"Since I obtained the video, everybody I know has been utterly fascinated by the stories.  I have long been an enthusiast of Diana Rigg's abilities as an actress and of Gladys Mitchell's stories.  Neil Dudgeon who plays Mrs Bradley'S chauffeur, George Moody, is an excellent character actor in his own right.  Peter Davison who plays the somewhat bemused Police Inspector Christmas is a suitable foil for Mrs Bradley.  As always in these types of stories he gets everything wrong and is put on the right track by Mrs Bradley and George Moody, whom he insists on calling Mr Mooney, which says about all we need to say about this character.  There is, of course, another character which is in most of the scenes and that is the Rolls Royce Silver Ghost. What a lovely car!

Altogether, this series has wonderful stories, excellent actors and of course the Rolls Royce.",1322870400,4,865,4.771812080536913

1332920,4,B00003TKFB,"But the jewelry insurance commercial that airs before each episode is not. It actually kind of irritated me. . . a lot.

Even though the mysteries and their solves are pretty convoluted, the show is definitely fun and enjoyable. The attitude and characters carry the series. I really liked the relationship between Mrs. Bradley and George Moody. It's very much like Bianca and Bernard from The Rescuers.

Commercials aside, the DVDs are pretty good. If you're a fan of Sherlock Holmes, are looking for something similar, and don't mind a little silliness, you'll probably like it.",1305763200,3,580,5.03125

The series takes you back to the 1920's with very authentic costumes and decoration.  I would recommend this to anyone who loves British humor and mysteries!,1302307200,5,413,4.616438356164384
1332922,5,B00003TKFB,"Produced in 1999 length 1 hr 22 min. based on a novel ""Speedy Death"" by Gladys Mitchell.

Mrs. Adela Bradley (Diana Rigg), amateur sleuth has her Bunter, oops, I mean chauffeur George (Neil Dudgeon). The pair plays off on another as if they could read each other's mind.

It is the year 1929. We are privy to Mrs. Bradley going to her ex-husbands funeral as back ground. ""Today, a funeral, tomorrow, an engagement party. Life goes on, n'est-pas?""Says Mrs. Bradley as she has been invited to her Goddaughter Eleanor's (Emma Fielding) engagement party. There as in all good mysteries we are introduced to the main characters (soon to be suspects) as Eleanor's affianced is mysteriously dispatched that evening. Who could've done it and why? The investigating doctor must prepare for a real shocker and so do we.

People who are used to this type or British mystery will have pretty much guessed the answer by this time. However it's fun to see how the characters slowly comes to the realization of what happened. By the way will anybody else be dispatched in the process?

""Speedy Death"" is actually a part of a series of Mrs. Bradley on film.
""Speedy Death"" takes one DVD

1332944,4,B00003TKFB,"Diana Rigg is simply delicious in this beautifully-mounted and written series, based on a little-known novel by Gladys Mitchell.  Rigg is in her element playing globe-trotting author (and sleuth) Adela Bradley, a woman who revels in her new-found 1920s ""emancipation"" and makes no apologies for living totally for the pleasure of herself, first and foremost.  Together with her faithful chauffeur George (Neil Dudgeon), Adela constantly finds herself right where the excitement is - which almost always involves a murder or two!

The show wasn't a large ratings pull for the BBC, and sadly wasn't renewed for additional episodes, but the way the story arc is structured in these five adventures, a satisfying conclusion is met and the whole package is nicely tied up in the final episode.  The combination of 1920s period decadence and the cleverly-plotted murder cases is irresistible; and THE MRS. BRADLEY MYSTERIES are sure to bring delight, thrills and more than a few laughs along the way.

Episodes:

""Speedy Death"" (movie-length pilot) - Adela is invited to the engagement party of her goddaughter Eleanor Bing (Emma Fielding), who has been left in a wheelchair following a tragic car accident.  But when Eleanor's fiancee is discovered dead in the bath, a series of revelations will rock the Bing household and give Adela a chance to prove her mettle.  With John Alderton, Carmela Marner and Lynda Baron.

""Death at the Opera"" - Being asked back to her girlhood school to deliver a speech is bad enough, but Adela balks at the notion of having to also sit through a performance of ""The Mikado"".  A bitter rivalry, closeted teachers and a corpse backstage soon enliven the proceedings.  With David Tennant, Annabelle Apsion, Roy Barraclough and Elaine Claxton.

""The Rising of the Moon"" - A freak accidental death during the knife-throwing act in Madam Marlene's Circus might not be an accident.  Adela uncovers the altogether nasty underbelly of the picture-perfect village of Little Fordham when she's called in to investigate.  With Meera Syal, Janine Duvitski and Nicholas Woodeson.

""Laurels Are Poison"" - The ghosts of the First World War simply won't die at the mansion belonging to Isobel Marchant (Phyllida Law), one of Adela's closest friends.  During a visit to the Marchant estate, Adela encounters hostility, repressed secrets and also a painful memory from George's past.  With Michele Dotrice, Kenneth MacDonald and Valerie Gogan.

""The Worsted Viper"" - Adela and George travel to a seaside lodge, where George's daughter Cecily (Rebecca Callard) works and is to be married.  A bizarre death leads Adela back to one of her first cases, and also reunites her with old associate Inspector Christmas (Peter Davison).  With Isla Blair, John Bowe, Eddie Marsan and Alex Palmer.",1288915200,5,2794,5.166666666666667
1332945,5,B00003TKFB,"It's a treat to see these again. I first saw them on TV in my late teens and appreciate having them on DVD. This is a complete collection of the Mrs. Bradley Mysteries.

Mrs. Bradley Mysteries are set in the 1920s. If one is looking for a Miss Marple or Inspector Morse mystery, shop around because these have their own flair. In the background behind the mysteries, they touch on period architecture, fashion, social culture, feminism in that time period, and the still huge difference between the classes and the genders.

Definitely a ""cozy"" with its own style and atmosphere, each mystery wrapped up neatly in an hour.",1279670400,6,622,4.75

1332947,2,B00003TKFB,"Although Diana Rigg is an excellent actress with scope and panache, the character of Mrs. Bradley, as presented in the series, fails to heighten Ms. Riggs' excellent skills and makes her look clumsy instead of avant garde.  Also the uses of sophomoric or poorly thought out attempts at ""light humor"" do not succeed in bringing balance and British wit to the script.  The only saving graces found were some talented auxiliary actors and a slight resemblance to Hitchcock.",1273449600,,470,5.012820512820513

OK, up front I have to say that I am reviewing this item without watching it because it is a Chanukkah gift, and so I still have a week to go before I can see it!  That said, I purchased this for my wife because we watched it on WGBH Boston and we both liked it when we saw it on TV.

The reason why I am reviewing this now is because I want to caution Amazon shoppers that this product, which is a 3 DVD set, is being sold by Amazon ALONG WITH the individual DVD sets as if they were all different!

The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries Series 1 consists of ""Speedy Death"" which is one DVD and also ""The Mrs. Bradley Mysteries (Death at the Opera, The Rising of the Moon, Laurels Are Poison, and The Worsted Viper)"", which is two DVDs.

Then Amazon says:  ""Frequently Bought Together"" and then lists the individual components that make up this 3 DVD set along WITH the 3 DVD set!

So Amazon is selling the 3 DVD set and they suggest that you buy the 1 DVD set and the 2 DVD set, but the 1 DVD set PLUS the 2 DVD set make up the 3 DVD set, so you would be buying everything all over again if you take their suggestion!  I know, because I bought the 3 DVD set AND the 2 DVD set, thinking that I was getting another series - I didn't realize that I was only duplicating my purchase!

That is why I'm writing this review not based on having watched the DVDs, but just to tell Amazon shoppers to BEWARE - and NOT make the same mistake that I did!",1259798400,134,1444,4.003484320557491

1332951,4,B00003TKFB,"There are only two downsides to this charming little mystery series - the first being that they didn't make many of them.  The second was the parts where the main character spoke directly to the audience.  I really thought the series could have done without the breaking of the fourth wall.  It made it seem slightly cheesier, and really distracted from the otherwise very well-done mysteries.

The main character (Adela Bradley) is utterly likable, as is her stalwart chauffeur.  Together they form an unlikely, but very effective team.  And the series really is all about they mysteries - there's not a lot of background or personal information needed to enjoy them.  Everything you need to know is laid out for you in the series.

Mystery fans tired of the increasing gore and adult situations in their mysteries will love this series - it hearkens back to an old-fashioned time of relatively clean and upstanding murder and mayhem...",1241222400,2,937,4.923566878980892

1332988,5,B00003TKFB,"So glad to have stumbled upon such a classic and, at the same time, entertaining sleuth! Dame Diana Rigg stars in this first installment of the PBS Mystery! series as the rich and sophisticated Mrs. Adela Bradley, based on the character created by Gladys Mitchell.

The action takes place in the coziest - and most adept to murder - of British places: a country estate, belonging to the rich Bing family. John Alderton stars as Adela's old flame and Master of the Estate. Although they both have taken different paths and married other partners, they have remained old friends, and Adela was chosen as his daughter Ellenor's (a.k.a. ""Mouse"", played by Emma Fielding) godmother. The reason for Adela's visit to the estate is precisely Mouse's engagement party. So, after attending the funeral of her ex-husband - and arriving late for it, Adela heads to the Bing Estate, driven in her Rolls Royce by her fervent admirer and trustworthy chauffeur, George Moody (played by Neil Dudgeon). Her presence comes in handy too, when the groom is found dead in the bathtub... and the big surprise is not particularly his death, but something physical about him - and it has nothing to do with the attraction to the bride, who has been paralyzed for the past two years due to an unfortunate accident. But in bringing the murderer to justice, Adela must face a personal crossroads that not even her very unique cynicism can hide.

This pilot allows us to discover and get a taste for more mysteries in the series, which will delight women mystery fans in particular, especially if they are interested in fashion. I can honestly say the best achievement of the series is the costumes. Ms. Rigg dons the 1920's style in a way I've never seen before, and her elegance pairs only with her natural sophistication and the charm of the character. As an extra feature, the DVD includes a virtual tour for the personal computer, of the inside sets designed by Edward Gorey, cast biographies and details of other PBS Mystery! productions.

Like Ms. Rigg says in the intro to the DVD about Mrs. Bradley, ""I liked her a lot"", and look forward to more of her adventures... and a lot more of those clothes!",1150848000,3,2179,4.744063324538258
1332989,5,B00003TKFB,"Dame Diana Rigg, best known as thoroughly independent Emma Peel of THE AVENGERS, stars here as Adela Bradley, a thoroughly idenpendent woman of the '20's.  Adela has been married but has managed to 'correct the error', and now has embraced the new study of psychology applying it to solve the various crimes that seem to happen around her.

Adela has been invited to her god-daughter, Eleanor's engagement party.  The young woman's life had been filled with tragedy; her mother's early death, and then a car accident that has left Eleanor confined to a wheelchair.  Finally it seems that life is beginning to improve for the young woman, Adela is introduced to the fiance, a charming young man, all is well until the groom to be is found dead in the bath.  An event that is shocking for more than one reason!  Still all involved conclude that it is an unfortunate accident (or perhaps a fortunate one) all except for Adela that is.

Soon there are more matters that bear looking into, a shooting, blackmail and some interesting actions that are not quite what they seem.  Naturally Adela sorts things out in the end if not quite to the satisfaction of all.

The characters are delightful, particularly Mrs Bradley who is  given to wry asides to the camera.  The relationship between Adela and her chauffeur George is introduced but not explained, leaving the viewer to wonder just what, if anything is going on between the two.  This is very much in the style of the 'cozy' mystery, a small isolated group of suspects, a quirky hero and sidekick whose lives are as important as the plot.  There is an underlying current of risque matters that is more reminscient of Sayers than Christie.

This is for anyone who is a fan of Christie, Sayers or Wodehouse as well as those of Diana Rigg.  The story is fast paced, characters well done, the production is excellent and the mystery well planned and fairly laid out for the viewer - all clues are present but challenging to sort out.  In addition the devices of Adela's comments, the witty dialogue and subplots make this a delight.",1138060800,4,2077,4.71191135734072
1332990,3,B00003TKFB,"For the plot to work about half a dozen people have to choose the worst of their options at several junctures in their life.  Lovers of real detective fiction such as by Christie or Sayers will feel that their intelligence is being insulted.  One example of an insult is that one person who took out a loan but did not spend the money could not repay the loan even if they wanted to.  Another example is that the police are unable to protect someone when a known person makes a death threat against them and no legal action can be taken against the threatener.
The only redeeming feature of the program is the elderly Dianna Rigg playing the part of a skinny 40 year old.  Dianna is wearing very baggy clothes to hide her portly figure which makers her look even more overweight.",1066780800,6,779,4.426573426573427
1332991,4,B00003TKFB,"The Mrs. Bradley series appears to be loosely based on the series written by Gladys Mitchell.  Gladys Mitchell began writing the series in 1929 with Speedy Death and continued until shortly before her death in 1983.  They are not easy to find in the US, but well worth the search.
However, back to the DVD.  Diana Rigg, who thrilled me in the Avengers in the 60's, continues to appeal in the first decade of a new millenium.  While the black leather is now relegated to shoes and gloves, her smooth and sophisticated style adapts well to a 1929 setting.  Neil Dudgeon, her chauffeur and crime solving sidekick, manages to inject just a frisson of possible romance (held back by class difference maybe?).
