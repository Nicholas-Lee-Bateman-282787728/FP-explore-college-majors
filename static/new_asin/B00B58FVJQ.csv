8562676,5,B00B58FVJQ,"So primitive were our media conditions in October of 1962 that as a college frosh living in a dorm, I had access to only one television set. On an October evening, I was in a lounge at least five minutes early, eagerly tuning up the set to see Martyn Green on the Bell Telephone Hour. Exactly on the hour, a horde of howling Dr. Kildare fans (or was it Dr. Ben Casey?) descended on the TV lounge, and I saw it would have been as much as my life was worth to insist upon my prior claim. Now, more than half a century later, at last I have been able to watch what I missed that night! With not only Martyn Green, but Cyril Ritchard! And it was worth the wait.
The Tennessee Ernie offerings I had been able to watch new. His MIKADO at first turned me off a little -- ""This,"" I thought in 2015 -- ""is what those people mean who complain that the piece denigrates the Japanese."" But the Nanki-Poo won me over: I wished I could have seen him in a full production. And the Katisha was so obviously quite attractive beneath her make-up, as to give me some sense of what it must have been like to see Rosina Brandram in the part. I had not liked Tennessee Ernie's Sir Joseph Porter back in my youth, but found my appreciation somewhat improved with time; though I was a bit bothered by his insistence on calling the character ""the Admiral.""
  Already having the Hallmark Yeomen and Groucho Marx Mikado, I found the excerpts from same pleasant fillers. My joy would have been complete had this included a ""Your Show of Shows"" PINAFORE I saw while still a grade-schooler in the 1950s; but this seems to me nostalgia TV at its very best.",1434412800,2,1625,4.289902280130293

8562678,4,B00B58FVJQ,"I think I saw one of these Ernie Ford's as a kid.  The majority of this DVD is highly entertaining.  The Ernie Ford ones are in remarkable color as well.  To compare it with Groucho's odd Mikado, for example, well--this DVD is superior even in a few weak spots.  While one can be disappointed at the cuts required for Ford's hour show, nevertheless his G&S is a nice introduction for the new listener.  Many of the other cuts -- such as Cyril Richard's performance -- are also great fun (and make one wish for more).  If you are a Savoyard, buy this disc and don't let its imperfections keep you from a good viewing experience.  I could imagine it as a centerpiece of a G&S lovers' evening together.",1393977600,9,699,4.4140625
8562679,5,B00B58FVJQ,"What a treat!  I can actually remember seeing some of these on TV as a child, around the time I first discovered G & S as a kid.  Every moment of it was a gallop down some of my memory's favorite trails.  And while I love every one of these, I do have to put in an extra word or two for Martyn Green, the only man, past or present, who could really sing ""Titwillow"" as it was meant to be sung. A moment of pure magic.  This is delightful for old G&S fans and for some newbies who want an introduction. (Review by Cheryl Duval)",1373760000,14,526,3.9339622641509435
8562680,4,B00B58FVJQ,"There are a handful of Gilbert and Sullivan curios around (The Danny Kaye and Nelson Eddy recordings for example) that offer a break from the D'Oyly Carte ""Tradition""- this is one of them.  It was not unusual for established stars in an other media to take a whack at the Savoy Operas. During the 50's and 60's there was a concerted effort in America to educate the middle class via television.  The major networks would air plays, operas and Broadway shows.  The idea was to inject some culture into the middle class and thus raise the national IQ.  As Gilbert put it, ""He who'd make his fellow creatures wise should always gild the philosophic pill.""  Certainly the opportunity to see little ole' pea picker Tennessee Ernie Ford retelling THE MIKADO and HMS PINAFORE on national television is justification enough to purchase this disc.  For the dedicated Savoyard the chance to see Martyn Green and Cyril Richard square off on some patter pieces is simply irresistible.  Above all this DVD is a time capsule into a period when television was relatively new and the intent was to stimulate brains not put them to sleep. For the nostalgia, for the variety and for the sheer fun of it I'm glad to have this DVD in my collection.",1368921600,24,1228,4.683720930232558
