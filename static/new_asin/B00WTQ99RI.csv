The movie was so beautifully well cast, with each actor clearly owning their role. But there was nothing like seeing a woman not only seeking revenge- but taking it. Danielle Guldin's portrayal of Emily brought a familiar intensity that made me (an otherwise passive, not-into-violence movie viewer) jump out of my seat with an assured sense of ""YES!! YOU GO!! BRING OUT THE GUNS!!""

I loved watching a movie where it felt justice was served on a bloody platter- and by a gorgeous, tough, complex woman. I think most in society would hardly expect her to take the reigns in seeking justice, let alone to take on the responsibility of going after it.

To me, the movie felt delightfully and radically different from others in the same genre. Twisted and dark, but in a way you can't help but empathize with. I'm about to go home and watch it again!",1433289600,2,1022,4.573770491803279
7153938,2,B00WTQ99RI,"Bullying, bad parents and hypocritical adults cause two outsiders named Jackson and Emily to bond as children, become inseparable as teens and finally to become complete sociopaths and potential mass-murderers.  I'm probably down with angry misanthropy more than most but Almost Mercy never really figures out what its targets are--basically it's Heathers without the humor or sense of purpose.

Emily narrates the film.  Her voice is supposed to provide sardonic humor that the movie is never smart enough to pull off and also narrative foreshadowing since she refers to Jackson doing something nobody expected that caused people to look for clues in his life that were warnings and schoolmates coming out of the woodwork with Jackson stories for the press.  So we are led to believe at every step of Emily's narration that Jackson will eventually become a mass murderer--but what is Emily's part in all of this?

Emily's narration is also the only reason we know that she and Jackson are best buds--she tells us it's so but the movie doesn't provide very many scenes that actually show their friendship which is an unfortunate decision by the filmmakers--providing glimpses of a tender side that they save for each other but hide from the outside world would have gone a long way towards humanizing these two characters and giving us a reason to care about what happens to them.

Besides Heathers the other movie brought to mind by Almost Mercy is God Bless America, writer/director Bobcat Goldthwait's shotgun-blast black comedy about two seemingly mismatched people who bond over their shared hatred of American pop culture and people who are stupid and/or rude and go on a cross country killing spree together.  God Bless America is very funny and possibly even more misanthropic than Almost Mercy but it also invests the time in showing us the burgeoning relationship between the two main characters, something that Almost Mercy flubs badly making the stab at sentimentality near the end seem phony and unmotivated.

Almost Mercy ultimately fails at whatever it is the film was trying to do--it isn't funny or suspenseful, Emily's voice-over lacks the sharp observations that might have qualified as satire and Jackson and Emily are way too sketchy as characters to care about what happens to them.  Almost Mercy feels like the product of a mad-at-the-world teen who isn't nearly as smart or insightful as she thinks she is--if an hour and a half of that sounds good to you then Almost Mercy is your film and you're welcome to it.  Me?  I'll watch Heathers or God Bless America again instead.",1433203200,3,2598,5.004640371229699

7153940,5,B00WTQ99RI,"I loved this movie despite it not being the type of movie I normally like. The actress Danielle Guldin stole the show and is going to be a superstar! It is very cool to see a movie tackle the issue of bullying like this film did. I will be recommending this movie to everyone I know. WARNING: This movie is not for children, has a lot of cursing, violence, a sex scene, and ""blood & guts"". If you like Quentin Tarantino Films, then you will LOVE Almost Mercy. It's like a Tarantino Film but much better!",1432684800,2,503,4.25
7153941,5,B00WTQ99RI,"I'm not sure 'Micah the movielover' actually watched this movie (or loves movies for that matter) because it had a very clear and developed story and while some may think they're seeing cliche, I'm seeing the writer/director taking on universal themes and depraved scenarios that are all too common in this society and showing the effect they have on two particular characters.  What they did in this film was a unique twist on the cliche school shootings and massacres of the past, which makes this movie not a cliche (might want to look that word up sometime).  As for the acting, it's an independent film and good writing and storytelling made up for any failures in that area which I'd argue were few.  All in all, I had a great time watching this film and look forward to more.",1436745600,3,782,4.611510791366906
7153942,5,B00WTQ99RI,"One of the stars, Jesse Dufault, is a friend of out son. We really enjoyed the movie, but maybe we're a little biased toward lovin it...",1436400000,,136,4.269230769230769
7153943,4,B00WTQ99RI,"The film is narrated in first person by Emily (Danielle Guldin) the main character. She spends her life being bullied and picked on in a small New England town. When new guy Jackson (Jesse Dufault) moves into to town, he too is a victim. The two form a bond as victims. As they get older...well it isn't hard to guess from the cover and title.

There was much cliche about the film, but what it made it enjoyable was Emily's view of life and circumstances. Her quirky character made the film. I enjoyed the cast of characters.

Good dark comedy.

7153945,5,B00WTQ99RI,"Going beyond a great solid story. This film will take you on a fun ride!...I enjoyed the soundtrack that was playful during the most intense scenes.
Great casting the young Emily (Eva Senerchia) and young Jackson (Jonah  Coppolelli). It was a true buddy movie  reminisce of ""My Girl"" (1991) BUT ...OHHH so much darker LOL. I love the  narration which allowed the viewer to settle  into the scenes with the characters, whether down long hallways or traversing a psych ward common room.
Possible sequel?...That would work!",1434931200,3,520,5.011627906976744
7153946,5,B00WTQ99RI,Absolutely Loved This Movie! It's a great movie. I'm a huge Kane Hodder fan and he did an excellent job in this movie. Kane always gives it everything he's got and he always deliver's! This movie is a must see. Can't wait til it's on dvd so i can buy a copy to own! To all the cast and crew: You all did a great job! Can't wait to see what's next! I know whatever you come up with it will be great!,1434758400,,398,3.8072289156626504
7153947,5,B00WTQ99RI,"Micah the movie lover would rather watch the Heathers?

No good acting he says. People if your considering to rent or own this film decide based on the trailer alone.

Micah knows nothing about acting as i am a trained actor and have asked the biggest acting coach in NY to review the film and his review of the work put in was dead on.

If you enjoy blood guts a strong female lead this is your film.

7153949,5,B00WTQ99RI,American Gothic at it finest. Dark and twisted exposing the churning angst of the small town. Danielle Gulden gets the twisted teenage just right because she plays it without a hint of acrimony. I'd like to see more of her.,1433808000,2,223,4.6

The acting sucked, the story was non--existent and all the whole thing was about was 2 misfit teenagers, one a boy and the other, a girl, who went around the town killing everyone with guns and a hatchet! If ALL you want in a movie is GORE, then you will LOVE this one, but if you're looking for a ""quality film"" with good actors and a good story, this ""movie"" is NOT for you!!",1433635200,,509,4.1

8714228,1,B00WTQ99RI,"A tired, low budget cliche compilation. Was this the Simpson's Clip Show of horror movies? It might be, but unlike this the Simpsons is entertaining. 'Almost Mercy' plays upon a simple revenge plot, and finds no uniqueness along the way. It throws in cliche's like the bullied teen, the 'suggestive' religious system, the sick mother, etc. Nothing works, throughout this entire movie.

I don't think I watched the same film that other reviewers did.",1440547200,3,449,5.0675675675675675

8714230,4,B00WTQ99RI,"Almost totally awesome.  I really enjoyed this film.  The dynamic between the two main characters is fleshed out and it deals with a lot of harrowing subjects in a surprisingly sophisticated way.  I normally can't stand voice overs in movies.  Narration is something that usually feels like a clumsy way to keep the story from falling apart.  Rarely is it necessary if the pictures and scenes do their job properly... after all, a movie is a story told with pictures.  It's not a book reading.  However, every now and then narration just works in movies and this is one of those cases.  Apocalypse Now is another example but then again, that film is on another level than most.  I liked this flick.  If you're down to see some kids go totally off the rails and rebel against the lunacy of the human condition, give this one a go.",1438387200,2,829,4.54054054054054
