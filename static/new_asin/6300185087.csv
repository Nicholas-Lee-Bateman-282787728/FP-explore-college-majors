7804613,5,6300185087,"One of, if not THE best, episodes of the series. A two-parter, first part ended season one, part 2 started season two. But my favorite scene is when Ricco and Sonny confront a high powered player on Wall Street in NYC. The player, who I swear was the template of Mr. Burns on the Simpsons, tells a story of how the drug game is played, and that Crocket and Tubbs are ""just along for the ride. It's a big boat. Why rock it?"" But he first tells them each what bank they use, their balance, and their stock holdings. It's easy to get now, but in 1984, you had to have real power to get that kind of information. This actor, and how he plays his character, was creepy as hell. Sends chills down my spine on how good it is. Too bad it isn't on DVD...",1490400000,,745,4.074829931972789

7804615,3,6300185087,"As pure action adventure, this suffers somewhat---it's WAY too slow compared with some other VICE episodes.... But its fun is not there---this is basically the teststrone version of the current hit cable show, SEX AND THE CITY, where a bunch of women have sexual/romantic adventures in the Big Apple every week. Here, it's vice cops Sonny Crockett and Ricardo Tubbs, traveling out of sunny South Florida to catch a NYC-based drug cartel, but, along the way finding themselves trying to score---Tubbs with his old flame, played by Pam Grier (long before Quentin Tarantino utiliezed her talents), who's undercover---quite literaly---with a Manhattan gangster; and Crockett, who does it with a mystery woman who gave him the eye in a bar. Oh, yeah, there are the obligitory gunfights, including one set in the plaza of the World Trade Center....",995846400,4,842,5.153284671532846
7804616,4,6300185087,"A nice, effective start of the 2nd season of Vice, and the action picks up where the 1st season had ended. This episode goes back a little to show us some of where Tubbs had been in before he came down to Miami. Crockett proves he can handle The Big Apple. Look for KISS singer Gene Simmons in a small part of a drug dealer who directs Sonny and Rico to head to NYC.",973123200,2,366,3.9594594594594597
7804617,2,6300185087,"Miami Vice :The Prodigal Son. 1985 ,94 mins Dir, Paul Michael Glaser, Starr, Don Johnson, Phillip Michael Thomas, Saundra Santiago and Edward James Olmos. Score by Jan Hammer . One year TV holdback Extract  courtesy  of the VHS copy. Crockett and Tubbs (Miami Cops ) are assigned to a mission  in Bogota , Colombia; a third world country whose exports are illegal, and  where a 2 billion dollar industry is run by a couple of crazed indians.  However, when it is discovered that the  contraband from their carefully  planned ambush has mysteriously failed to arrive at the police lock up .  Crockett  and Tubbs find themselves  in the high-tech world of New York  City. Definitely good action packed fun. It is not surprising  however that  this full lenghth feature film was held back for TV release . The plot is  regretably drawn-out and forgotten in the endless soap styled romances  between  Sonny and Rico's chick flings. The score and cinematography are  the highpoints. I  especially found the ambient lighting effective for a  show such as Miami Vice and all credit goes to Director of Photography  James A. Contner. The well chosen sountrack features the likes of Ex- Eagle  Glen Frey , Roxy Music, Bob Seeger and The Silverbulletband, Phil Collins  and Virtuoso Jan Hammer who is famous for his work with Stanley Clarke, Al  Di Meola  and Jeff Beck Ex- Yardbird",957312000,8,1372,4.83982683982684
7804618,5,6300185087,"A very important episode in Miami Vice five years production, with a Gene Simmons (KISS) cameo. This opening second season episode is from a time when the series was getting maturity and stability, and probably passing  through the peak of its enormous success. Glenn Frey's ""You belong to  the city"" is one of the dramatic songs of the story, together with Jan  Hammer's ""New York theme"" and Phil Collins'""Take me  Home"". This is one of the best series EVER made and I can't believe  that there are only two episodes in official VHS. At first, other 2 hour  lenght (or double episodes) could be released, like ""Hit List"",  ""Golden triangle"", ""Down for the Count"", ""Hostile  Takeover"", ""Freefall"". After that the entire collection  should be released. We are talking about an artistic production famous by  its development of a new narrative language (having the influence of  videoclip and making influence in it too), very original visual textures  and dramatic development of characters during the episodes. And of course,  the famous guest stars. I'm sure a lot of people would like to see again  the appearances of Frank Zappa, Miles Davis, Phil Collins, Sheena Easton,  Gordon Liddy, Isaak Hayes, Jan Hammer and SO MANY OTHERS...",952387200,16,1235,5.014778325123153
