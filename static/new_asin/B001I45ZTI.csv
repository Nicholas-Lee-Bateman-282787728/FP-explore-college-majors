8310428,2,B001I45ZTI,"I wasn't sure what I was getting, but it looked intersting. The box indicates many form of extreme motorsports, but it is 90% crotch rockets with idiots destroying perfectly good tires for a minute smoke, and trashing expensive bikes, while endangering other bystanders..
It is truly amazing what these guys can do on bikes and bounce back for more. I remember driving the interstate through Chicago when this loud roar comes up from behind and passes us going at least 90mph. About a dozen bikes pass with 3-4 doing wheelies. I immediately decide that if one goes down, I'll just have to run them over. I wasn't about to risk my life and my passengers lives and the lives of others, by swerving. This movie depicts illegal, exceptionally dangerous behavior which should not be attempted by anyone.",1251590400,,798,4.8321167883211675
8310429,1,B001I45ZTI,"I bought this video out of the dumpster at Wally World. I guess the producers of this film thought it would be great to have some of the riders going down the highways of No. Calif. at 65 mph doing wheelies in the fast lane with traffic all around them. One of them even crashed right in front of a car. Back in the 60's and 70's it was the outlaw biker clubs like the Hell Angels that gave motorcylcling a bad name, now in the 21st century it's idiots on sport bikes. Don't waste your money on this dog!",1240876800,,504,4.05
