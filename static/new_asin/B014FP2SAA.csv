7390962,5,B014FP2SAA,"This was excellent!  The murders are officially solved with this no question.
This is a great addition to the previous
film on this subject ""Biggie and Tupac "" which does most of the work to bring this film home as far as facts and it DEFINITELY  delivers. Highly recommended. ..",1498262400,,279,4.56
7390963,1,B014FP2SAA,This was a poor excuse of any real investigation that ever took place. Dig deeper and get a true understanding into Greg Kadings deceitful police interview tactics. The documentary was full of half truths and cover ups and certainly isn't worth the money I spent to rent this so called documentary. Please go back and re edit this movie for the truth!,1496188800,,351,4.67741935483871
7390964,5,B014FP2SAA,Excellent,1495497600,,9,9.0
7390965,5,B014FP2SAA,This is the closest you can get to the truth. Pretty much confirms what everyone knows that happened in Vegas and LA. Must watch.,1494806400,,129,4.416666666666667
7390966,1,B014FP2SAA,"done horribly, never should have wasted my time",1493078400,,47,5.0
7390967,1,B014FP2SAA,"Don't waste your time or money, low budget , I seen better on YouTube. The cop who investigated this got into trouble on another investigation. The cover is low budget. Lol.",1491523200,,173,4.612903225806452
7390968,4,B014FP2SAA,After viewing the documentary I'm still NOT convinced that two LAPD off duty rogue cops working security for Suge were not involved in the Biggie murder. I believe Kadings job was to redirect the Biggie murder away from the LAPD by any means necessary. I AM convinced of his conclusions in the Tupac murder though. Too many eye witnesses and to much evidence backing up rogue cops pulling the trigger on Biggie for me to think otherwise. Kading loss his credibility where Biggie is concerned. You got remember he is ex LAPD...once blue always blue. Det. Poole had it right and possibly paid for it with his life. The documentary is very good and definitely worth watching.,1491091200,,672,4.752136752136752
7390969,5,B014FP2SAA,So good- I'm going to buy it just to support- even though I get it for free.,1490572800,,76,3.5294117647058822

7390971,5,B014FP2SAA,"I just happened to see this on my TV guide and decided to record it. I had never heard of it before and had a day off and watched it, and I am so happy that I did. All types of sources here and it paints as good a picture you are going to get of the deaths of Biggie and Pac. Everyone can form their own opinion about what happened when these two legends died, but you need to watch this documentary in order to learn a ton of details about the two murders. I don't care if you don't like books or documentaries. If you are even 1% interested in how these guys were killed, this is a MUST WATCH.",1489795200,,595,3.8852459016393444

7390978,5,B014FP2SAA,"I never followed the rap scene,  but these guys were famous enough, so of course I knew a little about the situation. This movie brought me up to speed real quick and filled in all the blanks. The presentation could have been better but the methodical delivery was perfect for someone like me that didn't know all the background and parties involved.  Very informative and enlightening.",1484870400,,386,4.833333333333333

7390981,4,B014FP2SAA,"While the firm puts together a very creative and entertaining narrative, there are definitely holes that can't be filled (since nearly everyone that could fill them is deceased, not just the two celebrities). But as I said, it is entertaining even if it is only made to exonerate the LAPD.",1484524800,,289,4.8

7390987,5,B014FP2SAA,the mystery that the powers that be refuse to solve and they could easily if they wanted to. they would rather play Pac and Biggie off as law breakers and problem cats as to solve the case. acting like  Clive Davis and Jimmy Iovine amongest others of respected labels ain't stacked madd Paper.  Suge Knight and Puffy were just running errands in these two untimely deaths.  a double cover up believe that. let that have been  Eminem and Justin Bieber and see if this mess ain't solved in 24 hours or less.everybody knows who the powers that be are and its been Political against a Rap Movement and a take down.,1482019200,,610,4.468468468468468

7390990,5,B014FP2SAA,"Really enjoyed this documentary.  I had read a book some time ago (I think it was the one by the ""discredited"" detective) but this seemed to be the real and true story. Great investigative work which was not fully recognized and appreciated.",1481241600,,241,4.738095238095238

7390998,5,B014FP2SAA,"I've seen so many Tupac & Biggie murder documentaries like many of us had before, but boy was this one different. This  was like the 60 minute tv show type of documentary. If you guys know anything about 60 minutes, you know they are top quality. This was well researched and well put together. They basically solved the murder for us without a doubt. I'm sure many people in the hood in LA already knew this stuff, but for the rest of us who is not connected to gang life and LA hood, this was a great way to give us insight. This was one of the best docs I've seen in a long time. Good job guys.

7391044,5,B014FP2SAA,"When i moved to Las Vegas one of the first places i went to was the corner of Koval and Harmon behind MGM. The first time I went to LA i made sure to go to Wilshire and Fairfax outside the Peterson Building. These were 2 of the voices of my youth and i had to see the places where that part of my life was stolen.

This documentary really gets to the Nexis of why these 2 men were killed and the players involved. It doesn't surprise me that it took the threat of a 400m civil suit to make the LAPD  create a task force to solve Biggies death and vicariously Tupac's death as well. The two death were always connected, this documentary answers the why and by whom.",1467590400,6,664,4.061068702290076

7391065,3,B014FP2SAA,"overall pretty interesting, but a lot of unanswered questions and many new questions arise. Pretty sad that after 20 years there's but this documentary. Regardless of what this detective shows us, even his findings raise new speculations. and after watching this several times, I don't believe these findings are the clear enough answers regardless of the testimony. The corruption at that level, maybe the LA PD needed to generate Keffe D with a story to get of the 400 million dollar law suite. That raises the biggest question of all, and yet still no convictions. I think Mr Kadding provides some material but what is true and not true can only be decided by one persons testimony, to me thats not a documentary but an agenda.
Overall a good flick!",1464998400,3,752,4.792307692307692

7391076,3,B014FP2SAA,"I expected more from this than what it was. The illustrations of what happened for both nights that Biggie and Tupac were killed were cool, but the content was a mess.

7391078,5,B014FP2SAA,"Det. Kading (almost put Dr. in front first by accident) goes through this investigation as a surgeon would during a surgery. Very methodical and very sound in his reasoning. There are probably thousands of more tid bits and peculiarities about this case that I would absolutely love to know about that didn't make it into the documentary, but, this was a great doc and befitting of the young Shakur that strove so hard throughout his life to make an impact (he thought positive), be respected, and ultimately be loved. He had father issues (didn't meet him until he got shot) and his mother also had a very turbulent relationship with him (crack addict that kicked him out at young ages at times). Pac was a warrior in his own heart, simply because he had to be just to survive his environment. He had a very difficult life at times that I think some fail to see when the image of 2pac Shakur comes up into there minds. He could have a been..........  He could have been......  Something truly great for our country.  But we'll never know. Greed, money, gangs, and power: Puffy Daddy got the last laugh in this competition of ....... ? Darwinism?  Puffy got lucky.  Very very lucky he was able to influence just enough to get Pac knocked off. Pac was razor sharp. He was only 25 years old.

Greg Kading did very fine work. He did his job. He's personally sacrificed to give us all a peace of mind and to shine light up on the truth in a subject that's been so deep in a well of darkness. Being a big 2pac shakur fan, I chose early on to look past his ignorance, he was brilliant. Pac Until The End Of Time.",1462320000,2,1606,4.390572390572391

I believe Poochie didn't act alone and I believe he had people watching Big the entire night but thats neither here or there.

7391121,5,B014FP2SAA,"With all the conspiracy theories that have driven interest in these murders since they occurred, Isn't it time we became privy to the facts of the investigation?

It's an excellent documentary, its the best we've had yet on these murders. It provides a wealth of knowledge unknown to the public before, revealed for the first time from the task force investigation. A lot of speculation and misinformation gets debunked in this documentary, and we finally come to learn what the LAPD discovered when looking into these unsolved cases - straight from the lead detective and the case files themselves. I've wanted to know what the police had in their case files for years, so this is truly a valuable piece of media for anyone interested. This is not like those other documentaries and books that just speculate, this documentary presents the investigation as it unfolded along with taped interviews, witness statements and all kinds of material never released before. It's all carefully presented in the film. this is as real as it gets.

It doesn't leave you with much room to wonder how real or credible it is, and you won't be left with much doubt anymore about what really happened to these two hip hop superstars. we're now left with two credible cases that came close to prosecution, when you see the documentary you'll understand why these cases are solved but not prosecutable. everything to be found here is hard evidence substantiated by real witnesses.

i think we can really say that these cases are pretty much solved, and some closure can be had.",1455321600,13,1559,4.875471698113207

They con this cop because they used his evidence to persuade Puffy to have Biggie family drop the 400 million dollar lawsuit. That's why once this evidence came to like a year later the law suit was over. This is why the LAPD is covering it up. The guys that were original ""Conspiracy Suspects"" Never had nothing to do with any of the killings. Any body look in to this is hard evidence. However it will never go to try because the higher up at LAPD covering it up just so they didn't have to spend 400 million dollars. Check all the facts!!",1528070400,,610,4.222222222222222

Just to realise how stupid that would actually be of Suge Knight to put himself in a position where he very easily could have been shot himself.

Well this movie is going to make you want to point fingers somewhere else, but before you do that remember that this like any documentary is out to tell a story. And any disruptances to that story is simply going to be avoided bringing up. Also think of the circumstances of the testimony, which is the only 'evidence' this film actually provides.

It's a plausible theory but in the end that's all it is a theory, not a solving of murders which some would make you believe.",1502150400,,816,4.537414965986395

You could tell this guy knows nothing about Pac, nor did he understand a lot what he did in life. I was expecting good things from this, but it's more like a giant red herring of a film since it diverts attention away from the LAPD. This guy is a corrupt ex cop and has been shown to have no respect for the truth. Furthermore, he's good friends with Reggie, the one believed to be the mastermind behind both 2Pac's and Biggie's murders. What's sad is this guy is making money off Pac's name. Other pieces other there paint a different picture and do a great job of showing evidence, while destroying the information here. The problem is they don't have the same level of exposure.
