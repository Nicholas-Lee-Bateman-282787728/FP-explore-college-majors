2626939,3,B000H5U69S,"This movie started out questionable but as it went along the story became quite good.  The young actors/actresses make the movie believable.  The moveie basically is about 4 young men graduating from Navy Boot in San Diego and their wild pass before leaving for more training.  The have some ""colorful experiences"" during the weekend that will definitely make you chuckle, for sure.  Besides, my cousin was in this movie and I HAD to go see it.  If you need a good laugh, see this movie..",1250121600,3,488,4.694117647058824

8136454,2,B000H5U69S,"Four sailors leave bootcamp in San Diego and travel to LA for a long weekend. While there they visit a strip club, go to the beach, do aerobics, go to the old neighborhood, get a massage, and go to a comedy club. They all meet girls and live happily ever after.

Eighties music soundtrack. Rather pointless movie available on many multi-packs. 2 stars for the nudity

8136458,5,B000H5U69S,It's a good movie yes low budget but a lot of great movies are low budget. 4 guys on a weekend pass from the navy all try to pick up women one try's to be a comedian the others trying to score with the ladies. It's one of those movies usa would show back in the day.,1405641600,,266,3.6842105263157894
8136459,2,B000H5U69S,"Sophomoric - that I expected, but it went far beyond that. This film was so dull that I stopped watching just over halfway through.",1402790400,,131,4.5
8136460,4,B000H5U69S,Another reviewer commented that this movie is purely idiotic & insulting to the Navy. I guess that's partly true-if we keep in mind the real plot of the movie. This never claims to be a story about daily life on a Navy base. And it's nowhere close to being a war flick either. It's a comedy about love. Four rookie sailors have just completed basic training in San Diego. Now it's off to Los Angeles for a 3 day weekend of partying & romance before they go their separate ways on Monday. Yes the comedy is a bit dry to be sure. But that doesn't keep Weekend Pass from being fun & entertaining anyway. If you watch closely you'll spot Theodore Wilson in a small supporting role. Wilson played Sweet Daddy on tv's Good Times. Here he plays Nat the owner of Nat's Solid Soul Food Shack. Phil Hartman also has a good part. He hadn't yet achieved stardom on Saturday Night Live. And Grand L.Rush who plays gang leader Bertram did 1 guest shot on Good Times during the 1976-1977 season. He plays Leon on the 2 part episode J.J.'S New Life. Picture & sound quality on this dvd are very good. Weekend Pass isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen. But it's still good for a few laughs nearly 30 years later.,1307836800,4,1198,4.352678571428571
8136461,1,B000H5U69S,"This piece of crap came out while I was in the Navy stationed in, well.....San Diego and I found it to be purely idiotic and insulting to the Navy. I don't know why any DVD manufacturer would want to waste the time, the plastic and the assembly line to release this.

This came out during the wave of 80s exploitation films like Hardbodies, Summer Resort, Private School, Spring Break and countless other ""party"" films that rode on the heels of the great granddaddy Animal House. But what's really worse about this pile of celuloide diarrehea is that these other films were Lawrence of Arabia compared to it, at least they SOME funny moments and launched the careers of some future stars like Phoebe Cates, Tim Robbins and Matthew Modine (and had a few nice pair of knockers thrown in as well.)

Don't waste your time, eyes, ears and money on this one!",1291852800,,852,4.598684210526316
8136462,1,B000H5U69S,"I can handle a lot when it it comes to goofy 80s flicks, but this is painfully boring, really bad, with no redeeming quality, unless your in the movie I would avoid this one at all costs.",1289001600,,187,4.081081081081081
