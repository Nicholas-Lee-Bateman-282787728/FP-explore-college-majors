7807502,5,6300219496,"This is an amazingly wonderful tribute to Ansel. The interviewer was mostly completely out of sight -- this is nearly 60 minutes of pure Ansel reminiscing about his work, friends and life. An especially touching scene with Ansel and Georgia O'Keefe - this is priceless as you look inside their personal world with no one else in the video chatting or interpreting.

BUT THE PRICE ON AMAZON IS WACKO - $115? GO TO THE ANSEL ADAMS GALLERY WEBSITE and get it for $19.95. Amazon should be ashamed.",1521417600,,493,4.666666666666667

7807505,4,6300219496,"I was disappointed in this video.  But the problem may have been me.

Recently I returned to the hobby of landscape photography.  I was looking for some insights into Adams style/techniques. In my area of photography Adams is my hero.

I did not find much of substance in this video.  The video does present a good overview of Adams life.  As the cover says, the view is intimate and warm hearted.

Adams himself was reluctant to provide what he called post-processing rationalization.  He viewed his negatives as the equivalent of a score for music.  His print was the performance of that score. But we did not get to see Adams in his studio selecting the various scores from which he developed his performance. Perhaps due to his reluctance to perform post-processing rationalization we get almost nothing about what caused him to take that photo.

This DVD is addressed to a PBS audience to tell people who Adams was.  Just occasionally is it deeper than a Sunday evening special.",1321920000,,983,4.791666666666667
7807506,5,6300219496,The book was in superb shape and had a signature from four of the individuals highlighted in the book! The book arrived much more quickly than I expected! Thanks!,1225584000,,162,4.620689655172414
7807507,5,6300219496,"I own a VHS copy of this title which I purchased shortly after it was broadcast over PBS in the early 1980's.  The date should be 1980 and not 1990 as described in the heading.  This video can be viewed over and over and over (I have almost worn mine out and I hope it's reissued in DVD some day!).  For large format photographers it's quite exciting and inspiring to see an elderly Ansel describing (in effect) his autobiograpy with Georgia O'Keefe and friends over the years in a positive way.  If you want a more comprehensive portrait, I would suggest reading any of the biographies.",1060300800,2,587,4.509433962264151
7807508,5,6300219496,"I first checked this video out from the library and I watched it the night I took it home.  I then watched it two days later and then again 4 days after that.  After watching it the second time I wanted to go back and watch it again.  I had to take it back to the library though.
I have never watched a movie more than 2 times so this is a very good movie.
It is an interview with Ansel and his friends and it makes Ansel a very real person.",1010448000,8,441,3.7717391304347827
