8304147,2,B001G75JT8,"Oh, yeah, this is a great documentary - as long as you have no desire to consider the possibility that some UFOs are of extraterrestrial origin.  UFOs: The Secret Evidence (or, as it is called - for no apparent reason - in the US, An Alien History of Planet Earth) is little more than an exercise in debunking.  Investigator Nick Cook, an aerospace and defense journalist, seems to have an answer for everything UFO-related - especially the handful of cases he chooses to consider here as part of his supposed comprehensive study of the subject from the period of World War II to the present.  He apparently saw no reason to speak to any actual witnesses or ufologists (apart from Travis Walton and Bruce Maccabee).  Instead, he sought the counsel of former military and intelligence personnel and dug through official government archives for his information - which is strange because he makes a big point of saying we can't trust what the government says about UFOs.  To Cook, though, the whole UFO phenomenon is simply a disinformation campaign designed to divert attention from high-tech Cold War espionage and advanced military test aircraft.

Cook begins by looking at the foo fighter phenomenon, studying reports of Allied pilots reporting highly maneuverable lights in the sky shadowing their bombers on runs over Nazi Germany.  After a look at some sketches of experimental vehicles found in German scientific records captured by America after the war, he determines that the foo fighters were in fact some kind of German aircraft.  He totally ignores the fact that German pilots reported the same phenomenon, which baffled German experts as much as it did their Allied counterparts.  Having latched on to this idea of advanced German technology, he takes it and runs with it over the course of all the intervening decades of UFO sightings.  America brought some two hundred German scientists to America, where they continued their research and experimentation in the southwest desert (White Sands, Area 51).  Roswell?  Experimental US defense aircraft.  Lonnie Zamora's sighting?  Experimental US defense aircraft.  (He totally ignores all UFO sightings that took place anywhere else in America, apart from the wave of sightings over Washington, D.C. in 1952.)  Ah, but what about the sightings in Britain, which jumped precipitously beginning in 1967?  Experimental defense aircraft - flying out of US bases there.  What about sightings in the Soviet Union: US defense aircraft such as the U2 and its successors.

Things get even worse when he considers - all too briefly - reports of cattle mutilation and alien abduction.  Seemingly based solely on one rancher's hunch, he concludes that some unidentified group is disguising helicopters as UFOs, snatching cows, taking them to some unknown place to mutilate them, and then flying them back and dropping their carcasses to the ground on the ranches they snatched them from.  As for alien abduction, he offers us nothing but a short interview with Travis Walton (not the most credible abductee, by far), then presents us with a psychologist saying that alien abduction is explained by a ""victim's"" need to believe - and that abductees find comfort in believing they were abducted.  This is complete balderdash!  I have read and heard the stories of a number of abductees over the years, and not a one of them has ever found anything resembling comfort in their experiences - just the opposite, in fact.

As far as I'm concerned, Nick Cook is a debunker, pure and simple.  He only investigates one side of the evidence of the few cases he chooses to look at and jumps to extremely convenient conclusions for just about all of them.  This is a well-made documentary, but it is not a serious investigation of the UFO phenomenon.",1270512000,2,3787,5.028846153846154
8304148,4,B001G75JT8,"I have watched this DVD many times, and never get tired.  Nick Cook does an excellent job of research, investigation, and personal interviews with witnesses all over the planet!  For anyone interested in UFology, or UFO investigations, this is an excellent choice.

Nick's personality is both serious and honest.  He brings his vast experience and training to the field.  Many enthusiasts of the UFO phenomenon will be pleased with this presentation.  It is not filled with the usual ""Special Effects"" common to most UFO-DVD choices. Just hard core research and investigation.

You can't go wrong adding this volumn to your personal library.",1240185600,5,641,5.2254901960784315
