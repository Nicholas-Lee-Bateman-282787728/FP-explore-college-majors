3541505,5,B001DWNUIS,"Wow! This was soooooooo funny. We watched it on Christmas Eve night, and everyone in the room was laughing so hard, that we had tears rolling down. If you haven't watched this, please do. It is so worth it.",1232323200,,206,4.3076923076923075
3541506,3,B001DWNUIS,This was not as funny as his earlier show.  I was amused but not laughing out loud as I expected.  Disappointing...,1231718400,,115,4.428571428571429
3541507,5,B001DWNUIS,I've purchased all of Jeff's DVD's and he is the best.  Highly recommend this DVD to everyone who enjoys a good laugh.,1231286400,,118,4.363636363636363
3541508,4,B001DWNUIS,"This movie is not as funny as Jeff's other movies but keeping with the christams theme, it's still funny.",1229817600,,105,4.578947368421052
3541509,1,B001DWNUIS,Dunham never ceases to aim low with his humor. Painfully dimwitted. Not even vaguely funny.,1229040000,3,91,5.133333333333334
3541510,2,B001DWNUIS,"I also own the other two Jeff Dunham DVDs and loved them.  But this one is promoted ""as fun for the entire family"".  Trust me, you wouldn't want to gather around the TV with the kids and watch this one. I didn't know there were so many names for a woman's breasts.  And there were so many references to drugs and drug use that it got boring, especially when directed at ""Guitar Man"". Even Peanut, who is my favorite, came off as mean.  Usually he is the cute one with a bit of edge.  But this time he wasn't cute or funny.  I think Dunham wanted to have a Christmas special but just didn't have the material and went ahead anyway.",1228262400,5,630,4.1652892561983474
3541511,1,B001DWNUIS,"I was very disappointed with this one - Jeff tries to be ""edgy"" with some of his racial, ethnic/cultural and religious commentary, which some will find offensive in their own right, but which I found offensive not just because of their content but because of the laziness with which he chose his jokes.  There's nothing new here; stereotypes abound and the punch lines are more like weak jabs.  In that way, I guess there truly IS something for everyone - offensiveness for those who are sensitive to political incorrectness, and disappointment for those who have grown accustomed to Jeff's smart, incisive humor.",1228089600,10,613,5.0
3541512,5,B001DWNUIS,"A reasonably priced BD with awesome content - cannot ask for much more. The picture and sound were perfect for an indoor performance (Pabst in Milwaukee). Admittedly, the DTS shined only when the crowd was involved, but it makes for a good auditorium sound test.

The special features add some nice background (incl. in 1080) - with brief behind the scenes clips on the cover art photo shoot, the sleigh ride and the actual performance (complete with bazooka footage). Playing the two stand-up extras of ask Santa and Christmas Tips had my customers asking for copies.

The 85 minutes goes by too fast but the foul language is bleeped out, so it makes for a great holiday watch with the entire family and doesn't seem too lengthy. A definite recommendation that makes for a solid gift this year.",1226534400,,795,4.753623188405797

3541759,1,B001DWNUIS,"I heard how funny Jeff Dunham was suppose to be but I cannot say that I agree. His characters are boring and just annoying, not funny. The material is extremely weak and his ventriloquism is sub-par. Don't waste any time of your life watching this material.",1324512000,,257,4.608695652173913
3541760,4,B001DWNUIS,"Jeff Dunham, in my humble opinion, is one of the best stand up comediants there is. I never get tired of watching his shows over and over again. They always bring a smile to my lips. Even though this is a really good show, it is not one of the best ones yet.

3541766,4,B001DWNUIS,"The gang's all here for this very funny 2008 Christmas special filmed at the Pabst Theater in Milwaukee, Wisconsin - Walter, Achmed the Dead Terrorist, Bubba J, Peanut, Jose the Jalapeo on a Stick, and of course Jeff Dunham himself.  It goes without saying that you're going to be very entertained by Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special.  There will be more jokes than you can throw a jalapeo on a stick at, comic banter that only the most talented of ventriloquists would even attempt to pull off, a reading of - with commentary by Peanut -The Night Before Christmas, and a couple of great Christmas songs.  I must admit the show wasn't quite as funny as I expected, but I think this has a lot to do with the fact that I was already quite familiar with all of Dunham's characters.

Dunham opens the show with a monologue of about ten or eleven minutes.  It's a little strange to see him without a puppet, but he does prove that he can be funny on his own - albeit not as funny as he is with his special friends.  Fan favorites Walter and Achmed the Dead Terrorist get the most time on stage.  Dunham has only limited success in getting the curmudgeonly Walter into the Christmas spirit, but Achmed ends up entertaining all of us infidels with a great Jingle Bells parody called Jingle Bombs.  Next up, and straight from the trailer park, is Bubba J, who gives Achmed quite a run for his money with his own Christmas classic, Roadkill Christmas.  Of course, you can't have a Jeff Dunham show without Peanut there to liven things up, and then Jose the Jalapeo on a Stick joins both Jeff and Peanut onstage.  The comedy does get a little risqu at times and, of course, the politically correct crowd out there will cry and moan about Dunham's ""culturally insensitive"" jokes, oblivious to the fact that Dunham is an equal opportunity offender who is happy to poke fun at just about any group out there.  Personally, I say more power to him, but I think it is important to note that this comedy special isn't really something that most parents will want their younger children watching.

I do have a couple of minor issues with this special, however.  First and foremost, I was surprised and disappointed to hear some words beeped out - a few of which probably wouldn't even be beeped out on Comedy Central.  This isn't a children's video, so I see no point in allowing a censor to get his grubby hands on this product before it was released.  That brings me to the editing of this video in general, which appears to have been done by a fourth grader.  The first half of this video features two of the clumsiest and most sloppy edits I've ever seen.  It's like someone cut out a chunk of the film and just taped the two sides back together.  Fortunately, these problems don't come close to putting a dent in the fun unleashed by Dunham and the gang in this Christmas special.  Unless you lie awake at night worrying about the hurt feelings of mad terrorists who want to kill you, you're going to love Jeff Dunham's Very Special Christmas Special.",1292457600,4,3050,4.522768670309654
