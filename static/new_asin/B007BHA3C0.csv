5073472,4,B007BHA3C0,"There's no substitute for a good behind-the-scenes documentary. ""Occupation:Fighter"" isn't simply a behind-the-scenes look at MMA, but also a mini-exposition on what the lives of the fighters we see on TV or an arena might be like.  MMA, and in this case UFC, are still evolving on the world stage, and has only been legal and above board in the USA for a few very short years.  I gained striking insight from just a few moments of dialogue of just how new--and yet undeveloped--the sport is.

If you are looking for a cavalcade of UFC notables and a variety of talking head interviews, this is not it. If you are looking for a focus on one fighter, and through them an introduction to how the sport of MMA (via UFC) works in their personal lives and in the public sphere, you can start here.",1357516800,2,792,4.486111111111111
5073473,5,B007BHA3C0,I was shocked at how this film held my attention.  .. It gave me a new insight on the fighters themselves. .. a more human aspect on them and their lives.  Enjoyed!,1355875200,,164,4.09375
5073474,5,B007BHA3C0,"This movie is amazing! Before watching this film, I had no idea what the life of an MMA fighter was like. After watching the film, I felt so inspired to make a difference in my own life. Although, I am not a fighter, the principles that are brought up, such as effort and dedication, really inspired me to make a difference in my life. Everyone should watch this film!",1348531200,2,368,4.3478260869565215
5073475,5,B007BHA3C0,"This is a well done documentary that takes you behind the scenes and into the personal space of a young mixed martial artist. It's kind of an emotional journey and is a fairly true representation of what fight life is like. There are no frills, and it's not glossed over.",1345161600,,271,4.44
5073476,5,B007BHA3C0,"i have to say this documentary is the real deal!. Well put together, no lies, no scripts watch as it all unfolds, the start, the  grueling training, the dieting, weight cuts, family, friends emotions, fights, this has it all. Kept me very interested and loved watching the MMA training scenes and MMA stars that come thru the gym on a daily basis. Chad George takes you thru the journey of an MMA fighter's epic climb to the top. Amazing documentary!",1343001600,3,450,4.625
5073477,4,B007BHA3C0,"Film is well made and goes into the life of Chad George. You don't need to know anything about MMA before watching this film, as it delves into the personality and lifestyle that comes with such an intensive sport. A great way for the viewer to come to appreciate the art and rigor behind MMA training and competition.",1342569600,,318,4.5

5073479,5,B007BHA3C0,"I was interested in Occupation Fighter after I saw the trailer, but I had no clue how much it would alter my view of MMA. Of course you assume being an MMA fighter must be absurdly hard, but the extent to which their discipline and hardship goes is nearly unimaginable.
  Not even just in the cage, but long before the actual fight takes place these fighters are challenging themselves physically, mentally and emotionally to an insane level! After seeing Occupation: Fighter my respect for MMA fighters has grown thoroughly and my view of the entire sport has changed a lot! These are some truly amazing individuals and if you have even the slightest interest in the UFC, WEC, Strikeforce or just MMA in general this documentary will be quite enjoyable!<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Occupation-Fighter/dp/B007BHA3C0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Occupation: Fighter</a>",1330732800,6,907,5.7611940298507465
5073480,5,B007BHA3C0,This is a fantastic film about the pain and pride and dedication it takes to live the life of an MMA fighter.  It is masterfully shot and edited to create a beautiful and yet painful story.  I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone as it is a film any person can relate to.

8513804,1,B007BHA3C0,"I love the talk Josh Barnett gives in the beginning of WHY people fight, BUT in the end fighting and destoying is NOT as hard as CREATING SOMETHING.  You SUFFER much more and in the end CREATE soooooooo much more than in beating someone up/fighting.

Fighters just fight.  I've fought and as Barnett astutely says you are fighting someone else who has suffered as much as you.  In the end this means you've CREATED NOTHING and at most all you seek to do is destroy someone elses dreams.  All it is is a bunch of women men who HAVE NOT found something to put their ""masculine"" energy into creating because lets face it 99% of ""martial artists"" nowadays are NO martial ""artist"" like Bruce Lees.  They don't have a deeper philosophical reason why they fight and spread it, there is not ART in most MMA only fighting.  So it doesn't teach anything deep as Bruce Lee does to people, it teaches people to ""destroy"" and ""fight"" for NO REAL REASON other than that you're LOST.  And YES MMA is a REALER ""sport"" than anything else, BUT just as football, basketball, etc it is STILL just a distraction and WASTED energy on purposeless fighting for NOTHING and NOT finding your own purpose.

It's like grown men throwing temper tantrums, dumb as hell. Go create art in whatever it is you choose whether it's writing, drawing, science but FIGHTING IS STUPID and really teaches no one anything but to be an alpha a hole.",1388707200,2,1406,4.5476190476190474
8513805,1,B007BHA3C0,"it was the worst MMA documentary that i saw on my life, i was shocked by how it end, it doesnt even show the most important part of the documentary, the final fight, please don't buy it, you will fall asleep, seriously.",1370995200,,219,4.238095238095238
