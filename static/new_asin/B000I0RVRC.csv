8143072,5,B000I0RVRC,"I don't know what issue Z Hayes has with this movie but he or she went thru the trouble of denouncing it in 3 different product categories! And each with recommending utter tripe which is not even worthy of a free Youtube watch.

Darna Mana Hai is not perfect, its not always scary but is quite eerie and works its magic.

Normally I am not a fan of anthologies as they seemed to be a very lazy directorial technique but this is one of the better ones!",1369612800,,452,4.183908045977011
8143073,2,B000I0RVRC,"I re-watched this anthology of horror stories recently (checked out from my local library) because another reviewer states that my review is 'suspicious' and that I 'denounced' the movie in three different product categories. I felt this was grossly unfair because when one posts a review for a DVD, typically the review gets automatically posted under different product categories for the same title. So, I only posted one review but the review automatically got posted for the other two DVDs listings of the same title.

Now, on to my opinion of this film. After watching it again for the second time, I stand by my rating. I have watched numerous horror movies and horror anthologies and reviewed many as well. I happen to enjoy a good horror anthology and particularly appreciate atmosphere and an engaging plot. I felt Darna Zaroori Hai failed to deliver on many counts. Director Ram Gopal Varma had earlier directed Darna Mana Hai which is also an anthology of stories. The film only did average at the box office and I felt that the stories lacked cohesiveness and the scares were few and far between, a pity given some of the stars in it such as Saif Ali Khan and Nana Patekar (the latter happens to be one of my favorite Bollywood actors).

In this second anthology, I felt that some of the stories were stronger than others, but on the whole, the stories were not what I would expect from a good horror anthology. There is an attempt to build up atmosphere and deliver scares, but I felt underwhelmed, especially since I have watched far superior productions in the genre. Character development is lacking and the stories lack originality. I guess the director/s should be given credit for trying out a novel format for Indian horror films (by using the anthology format) but it just doesn't work. I still stand by my earlier recommendations of several well-made Asian horror anthologies which I enjoyed far better than this and have received better reviews, for example:
