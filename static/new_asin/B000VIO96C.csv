2942265,4,B000VIO96C,"Great Jackie Chan classic. However the TUTM Entertainment discs,many are defective and after the first hour,cube,scramble and stop.
 Too bad because this release is not in Full Frame(even though indicated)but Widescreen. Find an older Widescreen release and pay a little more to be sure of a better playback.",1281139200,2,308,5.416666666666667
2942266,3,B000VIO96C,"Personally, Jackie Chan is my favorite actor and I love his movies. But the movies I like are the ones where he as much as a comedian as a martial artist. The action is good but certainly  not as good as the second Drunken Master. There are definately more entertaining Jackie Chan movies out there(look for anything in the late 80's to the 90's), but if you are on a mission to watch all his movies like I am, you'll like it.",1253577600,,426,4.195121951219512
2942267,4,B000VIO96C,"Great old school kung fu movie.  The two final battles with the three spearmen and the evil master are amazing.  How do you choreograph something like that?

The 4 stars is not a reflection on the movie, but the DVD.  It's in English with no subtitles and no original language track.",1207267200,3,283,4.490196078431373

2942273,4,B000VIO96C,"To tell the truth I enjoy watching the martial arts movies from this time period.
Although they can be a little cheesy to watch they are entertaining.
A younger Jackie Chan is very good in this movie his skill and physical conditioning are very good.
Add to the fact that his humor has continued to improve throughout his movie career, this makes his movies a bonus to watch.",1468454400,,375,4.529411764705882

2942295,5,B000VIO96C,Crap movie but Jackie Chan at his finest! He's so strong & so very talented! In every modern fight scene each shot lasts less than a second. In this film Jackie & company will choreograph a 10-20 second fight scene with no edits! Absolutely dazzling!,1426636800,,250,4.5777777777777775

2942297,5,B000VIO96C,Great classic Jackie Chan film. The version that Amazon instant video has is an older dub which isn't a problem because i am a huge fan of old kung-fu dubs. The movie is hilarious and the action is nonstop.,1414886400,,206,4.3076923076923075
2942298,5,B000VIO96C,"This has always been one of my favorite Jackie Chan films, since I bought the VHS two-pack years ago that featured the Hong Kong Hatchet Job sequel.  As with most of Jackie's films of the era, it has an amazing training montage, including the classic chop stick fight that would thirty years later inspire a similar scene in Kung Fu Panda.

Jackie's been making movies for over fifty years but he really came into his own during this era.  Films like this one, Drunken Master and Snake in Eagle's Shadow made him famous and rightly so.  They're all classics of Kung Fu comedy, which nobody did quite like him.",1413676800,2,609,4.559633027522936
2942299,4,B000VIO96C,Great classic Jackie Chan martial arts film. Great fight scenes and brilliant choreography.,1410048000,,91,6.076923076923077

2942301,5,B000VIO96C,"Fearless hyena is a classic Jackie Chan film that has hilariously weird scenes amplified by overdubs so bad you wonder if they knew they were this funny. That said, there's lots of action, and a few BAD ASS training scenes. It's a must see if you've never experienced Fearless Hyena!",1400976000,,283,4.68
2942302,4,B000VIO96C,I loved Jackie Chan's style of combining comedy with kung fu. This movie is an absolute classic and a must watch for kung fu action movie fans.,1398729600,,143,4.333333333333333
2942303,2,B000VIO96C,"I would rate this movie higher, but there were too many silly scenes with characters other than Jackie Chan.  The fighting scenes were very good though.  Lots of choreography.",1397606400,,175,5.0
2942304,4,B000VIO96C,Great action and funny moments...If you like Drunken Master you will like this movie too. English dubs could be better.,1395014400,,119,5.0
2942305,5,B000VIO96C,"... where fights are fought with everything but the kitchen sink, this is for you. Jackie Chan - as usual - is hilarious, and in this one he even appears as a woman to fight a supposed champion. The plot is similar to others of this genre: a young man taught kung fun by his grandfather but forbidden to teach it to others has to call upon the training for revenge and pride.",1392681600,,375,4.1506849315068495
2942306,5,B000VIO96C,"Ignoring the British accented dubs, this is still one of the greats, lots of comedy and excellent choreography, all signature Jackie Chan. I vaguely remember seeing this on Saturday Morning Kung Fu Theater ages ago, along with so many other really well choreographed classics, and even then I didn't care that the movies were dubbed in English. So, I can't speak Chinese, so what? Jackie is always very expressive, and doggone it, the stunts are AWESOME. The good guy wins, and you just can't help rooting for him. Love these movies, always will, and throughout the years, Jackie Chan just got better and better. Great fun for about an hour and a half- for those of us who love the chop-socky flicks. If you don't love it, then I tell you, in the style of all the greats:

You have dishonored my school, and dishonored my family. You must die!",1381449600,2,843,4.62
2942307,5,B000VIO96C,This is one of the most entertaining Kung fu movies in Jackie Chan style. I watched this movie as a kid and loved it.,1380758400,,117,3.9166666666666665
2942308,4,B000VIO96C,"It was basically one super long fight scene. Not the best story line, or plot development, but it was pretty funny.",1380067200,,115,4.523809523809524
2942309,3,B000VIO96C,Love all his movies but this one was too slow and the translation was not good...Jackie is great in all his movies,1377648000,,114,4.2272727272727275
2942310,1,B000VIO96C,It was in Chinese only.  No sub-titles unless they appeared after 10 minutes into this thing. Awful.  Avoid if possible.,1364515200,,120,4.95
2942311,5,B000VIO96C,This movie is a short classic! One of my all time favorite movies. This movie is a part of my top shelf personal collection!!!,1360972800,,126,4.291666666666667
2942312,1,B000VIO96C,The Fearless Hyena is in Chinese and has no subtitles or dubbing so unless you know Chinese you won't understand a thing.  Makes you wonder whether all foreign films in Amazon Instant are like this....,1354924800,,201,4.742857142857143
2942313,4,B000VIO96C,"This is a good movie. Good choreography. However, there are no subtitles. So, I have no idea what the movie is actually about.",1350345600,2,126,4.521739130434782
2942314,1,B000VIO96C,"Great movie... but the ""instant video"" is only in Chinese and there are no subtitles.  So unless you happen to speak the language you should probably get it on CD.",1333324800,8,163,4.433333333333334
2942315,2,B000VIO96C,"THIS VERSION HAS BETTER PICTURE QUALITY THAN SONY RELEASED BUT ENGLISH DUBBING ONLY(DD 2.0 STEREO), NO SUBTITLES,NO TITLE MENU , NO SPECIAL FEATURE AND NOT IN FULL FRAME (2.35:1 ANAMORPHIC WIDE SCREEN)..",1323216000,,203,5.375
2942316,4,B000VIO96C,"One of Jackie Chan's earliest movies and the first one he directed.  It was typical Jackie Chan -- Kung Fu action mixed in with a lot of comedy.  Of course the only drawback was that it doesn't really sound like Jackie, but it was still a good entertaining movie.",1317600000,,263,4.346938775510204
2942317,5,B000VIO96C,This is my favorite freakin' Jackie Chan movie. Reminds me of the days of Sat. morning Action Theatre. WWWWAAAAAHHH !,1296432000,,117,4.9
8218960,5,B000VIO96C,A great Jackie Chan...one of the better ones.,1525651200,,45,4.75
8218961,5,B000VIO96C,"I loved the movie, cuz we love Jackie. BUT the movies is mismarked. It is NOT a 2007 movie.",1525132800,,91,3.8421052631578947
8218962,3,B000VIO96C,"Very good action scenes when Jackie is involved, and his choreography is beyond impressive.  How he wasn't sliced to ribbons during some of the one on three sword and halberd fights just boggles me.  His physique and strength is world class.  I have no idea how those upside down swinging sit ups are even possible.  Absolute genius.
That being said, the rest of the movie is very hard to watch.  For anyone who's a fan of the ultra cheesy comedy, this works I guess.  My take is that this is just slapstick.  I don't get the appeal of the Three Stooges, and I certainly don't get this type of farce.  There are a lot of comments out there regarding how one needs to understand that this is the comedy that worked for that time and setting.  Great.  But if it's not funny or enjoyable to me, then it's not my thing.
Summary.  Top notch action, bottom of the barrel story and acting.",1522972800,,882,4.382716049382716
8218963,4,B000VIO96C,"Good portrayal of a young person with talent, who has no easy outlet to show it!",1516147200,,80,4.0625
8218964,2,B000VIO96C,"Super boring story dubbed in English.  Villain is chasing after a kung-fu master who is Jackie Chan's grandfather.  His grandfather has a best friend who is running to warn the grandfather of this danger.  However, there is no explanation for why the grandfather is being chased by this villain.  The grandfather tells Jackie Chan not to show off his kung-fu or let people know of the family's background, but never explained to him that he is hiding from a villain.  Jackie Chan needs a job as he lacks money to take care of his grandfather, but bumps into these entrepreneurs who convince him to fight kung-fu masters on behalf of their kung-fu school and be paid well for each fight.  The purpose is to attract more students, so Jackie Chan started with changing the name of the school to his family's kung-fu style name.  Soon, the villain hears of the school name and shows up.  They tried to add humor in this movie, but it doesn't work.  The best humor was when Jackie Chan dressed as a woman and fought a perverted kung-fu master.  The kung-fu choreography is well done in this movie and there are constant fight scenes, so if you just want the movie for good kung-fu, this movie is for you.  If you are looking for a story, you will be bored as there is none.  I passed out a few times watching this movie.  Jackie Chan is in excellent shape in this movie though.",1505433600,,1372,4.483870967741935
8218965,5,B000VIO96C,"Real fun movie, great choreography, if you're looking for a fun film with good jackie chan fight scenes and comedy you're golden",1502928000,,128,4.863636363636363
