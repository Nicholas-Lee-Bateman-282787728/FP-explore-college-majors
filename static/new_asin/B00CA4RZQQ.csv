5708785,3,B00CA4RZQQ,"The movie reminded me a lot of the 50's horror movies - the ones that were just one step up from a bunch of kids making a movie in the backyard.

Most of the characters were two dimensional and wooden.  The sole exceptions were the chinese grandmother and her pathologist daughter.

The actor portraying the used car salesman / gold merchant / stereotypical greed inpired ""bad"" guy was over the top in a comedic way.

The ""monster"" was hilarious, I haven't laughed so hard since I saw the creature from Roger Corman's ""Night of the Blood Beast"".

Entertaining, light comedy ""monster"" movie",1377043200,,589,4.735294117647059
5708786,2,B00CA4RZQQ,And a Bad one at that.  Not worth the money to rent.  This one should really be in the Prime Movie selection.  It was just your typical Sunday Afternoon cheap flick that you would watch because you had absolutely nothing else to do.,1374364800,,232,4.348837209302325
5708787,4,B00CA4RZQQ,"This is your typical horror film. The first scene gives us a glimpse of the creature with a killing. We then establish characters and their relationships. Then back to the creature confrontation.

Sheriff Tatum (Carl Savering) and Todd (Robert Belushi, son of James Belushi and Sandra Davenport) are the police officers  in a small southern town where there was once a gold mine. Todd has stress issues. In an early tease scene they catch two people parking: Tatum's son and Todd's sister Veronica (Evie Thompson). Todd has stress relief sessions with Theresa (Cathy Shim) while Veronica is best friends with Theresa'a sister (Olivia Ku). Their mother knows about the curse of the mine.

The film is not without flaws. The history was questionable. Chinese miners in the south in 1840? Not likely. The photograph shown from that era was clearly not from that era. A half face paper filter mask for methane gas? Of course when you are dealing with a two headed gold eating creature, these are minor reality issues.

I enjoyed the film which created likeable characters. Nothing to get excited about, but makes for a decent rental. 3 1/2 stars.

Parental Guide: No f-bombs, or nudity. Off screen sex. Minor sex talk.",1373587200,4,1214,4.902439024390244
5708788,3,B00CA4RZQQ,"The basic storyline of the film is that there is a abandoned gold mine that was closed long ago after several mines were killed tragically digging for gold. several years into the future and we have a boisterous grandson of the original mine owner who has reopened the abandoned mine. Little does he know that an evil monster that is a reincarnation of the dead miners has been released on the local people. the special effects were great with this monster, and there were numerous explosions but nothing that seems to kill the monster. The local deputy sheriff and his girlfriend are the heros of this film and between their love for each other along with some oriental mysticism they both kill the evil gold monster. the way this film ended, i wonder if there will be another film made that takes off where this one ends? this movie i am sure would be liked by both guys and gals.. it is both a horror movie and has a little bit of romance, drama, and comedy",1372982400,,960,4.4602272727272725

8579027,3,B00CA4RZQQ,"Released to TV in 2013 and directed by Thomas L. Callaway, Heebie Jeebies chronicles events in a Louisiana town when an abomination is unleashed from cursed gold mine that was recently reopened by a greedy descendant (Michael Badalucco in a decidedly over-the-top performance).  Carl Savering & Robert Belushi play the Sheriff and his deputy while Dave Davis & Evie Thompson appear as their teenaged kin. Cathy Shim, Lucille Soong and Olivia Ku are on hand as an Asian family with insights about the creature.

This is a half-serious/half-campy Grade B horror flick with several amusing moments. It generally works for what it is and has a few highlights, like the imaginative, but cartoonish CGI monster, which looks like five corpses mashed together with a huge malevolent maw for a torso. Evie plays a winsome cutie, albeit overtly tart-y; and Belushi is likable as her cop brother, the main protagonist, not to mention Shim as his sweet girlfriend.

Despite the obvious low-budget, the movie has gusto and I cared about the 2-3 main characters. Unfortunately, there are glaring flaws that force me to lower my rating. For instance, the deputy discovers video-proof of the monstrosity, but then refers to it as some type of animal to others, including his sister.

The film runs 85 minutes and was shot in St. Francisville & Baton Rouge, Louisiana. WRITER: Trent Haaga. Marion Ross & Jennifer Rubin have small roles.

8579031,3,B00CA4RZQQ,"Love the title, especially when it's sung by The Boswell Sisters.  ""Got those heebies, the heebie, jeebie blues.""  This movie has nothing to do with that.  Wish it did.  Instead, this is a semi-horror flick about a monster of sorts that leaves its imprisonment in a mine to wreck havoc on the townsfolk, especially if gold is involved (as in ripping all the gold crowns from the mouth of a verbally abusive teacher, Marion Ross as Agnes Whitehead).  It paralyzes its victims with the stench of fear before making a bloody mess of them.  The monster is an amalgam of several trapped miners.  It bleeds gold, prompting EVIL Billy Butler (Michael Badalucco) to try and trap it so he can ""milk"" it of its gold.  To that end, he kidnaps a sheriff and the town coroner (Cathy Shim) to use as live bait.  The monster is entirely a CGI creation, looking like leftover bits of other things.  It's less scary than it is a fascination of poor design.  The movie is played mostly for laughs with the running gag of a deputy sheriff (Robert Belushi) prone to panic attacks and a high level of anxiety.  Most of the characters/actors are outlandish; few strive to bring forth a natural performance.  Nearly all can be tolerated but for Badalucco, who chews more than just the scenery in his attempt to stand out.  He is excessive to the point of failing to appear human.  He cackles, bellows, sticks out his tongue (far too often), and even tries to imitate Margaret Hamilton at one point!  It's worrisome to think the director couldn't restrain him.  He was the only thing monstrous in this monster movie.  Otherwise, it's a fair to middling effort in the horror genre.  I liked it enough to keep it though.",1428192000,,1694,4.605351170568562
8579032,4,B00CA4RZQQ,"There is a good movie here. Interesting and unique characters, nice cameo's, and a interesting plot. It's main drawback is the low budget efx. They are around Asylum or lower, but if you can overlook it (or even better, get a laugh and appreciate it) you will like this movie. I am a big ""B"" movie fan and this is in the to 80% of them, far better than some other horror films on Amazon that take them too seriously. It reminded me a bit of ""They Call Me Bruce"", with Evil Dead, etc., Bruce Campbell (another fun movie if you haven't seen it).",1419120000,,543,4.230769230769231

8579034,1,B00CA4RZQQ,Simply crappy made-for-cable monster flick with some of the worst CGI this side of a film made by The Asylum. The title creation is laughable and the film has fade-to-blacks where the commercials were supposed to be shown. Don't waste your time.,1380326400,,245,4.857142857142857
