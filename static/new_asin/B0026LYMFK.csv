3854298,3,B0026LYMFK,"Rosslyn Chapel contains a portal from this world to the next world?  Rosslyn Chapel is identical to Solomon's Temple?  It's a storehouse of tremendous energy?  This Scottish chapel figures prominently in Dan Brown's DaVinci Code and according to Brian Allen, whose testimony is central to this DVD, the power of the place can still be felt.  It's a riveting eyewitness account, but like all such narratives, difficult to prove.  What's more convincing is Brian Allen's assertion that if the Universe can be formed in a nano-second from absolute Nothingness, then other difficult-to-fathom ideas might be possible as well.  Although it promises to uncover the secrets of the Knights Templar, this isn't the focus of the film at all.  It's more concerned with what this ""other world"" is and how Rosslyn Chapel might lead to it.",1274745600,2,825,5.066666666666666
3854299,3,B0026LYMFK,"Brian Allan took me on a tour that I will never forget.  The Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland is purportedly an incredibly haunted site.  Well, I love documentaries, movies, and books about hauntings!  In fact, I can't count how many times I read and watched The Amityville Horror.  That house was supposedly on a vortex that allowed spirits to pass through from their world to ours, wreaking havoc on anyone in the vicinity.  Rosslyn Chapel is much the same.  It sits on an energy hotspot where spirits from the beyond can communicate with us and pass back and forth.

They say we shouldn't fear the dead, but I have to admit that this film was downright spooky at times!  And what history!  The church has been around for nearly 600 years.  Anything that old had to experience some really odd things throughout time.  There were a lot of neat photographs, video and much to think about in The Rosslyn Frequency.",1274486400,2,907,4.6415094339622645
3854300,2,B0026LYMFK,"The information was facinating, but putting so much time and effort into psychedelics (as a time filler) got extreemly annoying.  Being told about events and saying ""I have video"" several times, but being shown animations instead was also annoying.  The subject matter was amazing and I actually do believe him, but I was hoping for an actual documentary.",1267142400,12,355,5.103448275862069
3854301,4,B0026LYMFK,"Brian Allan takes you inside Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland, where he thinks there is a portal between this world and the next. A lot of cool photos, video, graphics, and the spiritual ponderings of Allan take viewers into the ""Hidden World of the Knights Templar"" and beyond.",1252368000,2,272,4.808510638297872
3854302,5,B0026LYMFK,"The Rosslyn Chapel in Scotland is shrouded in drama and lore of a devilish tone.  Want to hear more about it?  I did.  This 60-minute film zoomed by as it was filled to the exciting story of the Chapel with a demonic frequency.  The chapel's history which began in 1446 is filled with not only the buried knights but a history worthy of a feature length Hollywood movie.  At the end of the 60 minutes, I wanted more!",1250121600,8,416,4.282051282051282

8352998,5,B0026LYMFK,This is an interesting vid.  If you are interested in the Templars/Rosslyn mystery I suggest you watch.  I shall be ordering from you again.,1506297600,,140,4.791666666666667
8352999,4,B0026LYMFK,"First of all, this was a beautiful documentary showing the Rosslyn Chapel. I am new to the subject & had no idea the place was so breathtaking! The age of the place, and the architecture & history are all so powerful. The idea of there being a frequency that the Catholic Church has banned...and then going right ahead & playing said frequency within the walls of such a place...I mean, the gall these people have! It's amazing how brave they are. I would have run away & hid for days.",1374883200,,485,4.4
8353000,5,B0026LYMFK,"Heavy, serious stuff in this presentation. I wouldn't take any of the ideas presented here lightly. When are we going to wake up and realize maybe we don't know it all and there is an entire other world right in front of us.",1374883200,,224,4.232558139534884
8353001,1,B0026LYMFK,This story is incredibly interesting. I wanted tomlearn more about it. The entire documentary is full of cheeky terribly done cgi and music. It's annoying and ruins the man telling the story.,1361750400,,191,5.0
8353002,3,B0026LYMFK,"This video suggest that there is an unknown energy that flows under the ground beneath the Rosslyn Chapel (Sometimes refered to as Lay Lines energy) . The producer of the video gives and oral account of and experience he had at the chaple with other people, one of which was a sensitive. He claims do to the chapel's sacred architecture an the the energy flow from under the chapel a portal appeared and he levitated into the air, then the hand of a man reached through the portal. This was the only part of the video I found to be of interest.",1358208000,,544,4.3431372549019605
8353003,3,B0026LYMFK,"What he said was very interesting.
I would have liked to see more footage of the actual place instead of lots of talking and drawings.",1298851200,2,134,4.4
8353004,1,B0026LYMFK,"I can't believe that the Rosslyn Frequency got a rate as high as 3.3 stars! This DVD does not have any useful historic information about neither the knights Templar nor Rosslyn Chapel. It only has few seconds of the chapel footage. Most of the film duration is computer generated graphics and psychedelic effects which resemble video games.
This time filler is alternate with the author interview segments about his ideas on how Rosslyn Chapel could be a portal to another dimension. He tries to link physics law and medieval music theory that have no connection. Don't waste your time or money.",1292112000,,595,4.900990099009901
8353005,1,B0026LYMFK,"Don't waste time or money on this DVD!!!  Total ripoff.  Very hokey graphics, has very little to do with Rosslyn or Knights Templar.  In between bad pics of chapel, you have graphics that look like someone's idea of a very bad LSD trip, and some old guy just spouting his own theories and retoric re: a variety of paranomal or oddities!  Worst film I have EVER seen!!!",1287446400,,368,4.447761194029851
8353006,1,B0026LYMFK,"This dvd has to be the most ridiculous thing I have seen.  Hey, if you want to sit back and watch a guy tell you about his two psychics who came along with him and told him weird things about Rosslyn while the editors of the dvd keep playing around with the special effects buttons to a point of being extremely annoying, then go for it.  There was NOTHING of interest in this dvd for the serious student of Templars. Oh, and the music... it was just as annoying as the special effects.",1275004800,14,486,4.21505376344086
