3537695,3,B001DS35JQ,"As a longtime fan of Hammer Films, I'm delighted that these two films from their later period are finally being made available.  Although most folks seem to be focusing on DINOSAURS, I was actually more excited about MOON.

MOON ZERO TWO is real oddity.  It was released a year after&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B00005ASUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001 - A Space Odyssey</a>, and is among the few films of the period to take a relatively serious approach to its subject matter.  Having said that, there are several aspects of the film which hopelessly date it.  For starters, the hideous psychadelic theme song sets the wrong tone.  Imagine a lost episode of ""Schoolhouse Rock,"" in which animated American and Russian astronauts compete to the beat of a psychadelic tune.  From there, we are treated to other strictly-60's images, including women whose sole purpose is sex appeal (which is limited due to the horrible pastel wigs), astronauts in jumpsuits that make the pansy uniforms of SPACE: 1999 look like high fashion, and some very dull drama.  On the plus side, the special effects are an agreeable cross between Douglas Trumball's groundbreaking work on 2001 and the less-impressive but still very-detailed work of the various Gerry Anderson series.  In short, it's hardly a classic.  But it's an interesting curio of its time, and a well-intentioned attempt at real science fiction.

WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH is the follow-up to Hammer's highly-succesful&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/One-Million-Years-B-C/dp/B00018D3ZA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">One Million Years B.C.</a>.  Both are pre-history tales of fantastic creatures and women in skimpy bikinis.  And while the absence of Ray Harryhausen (who provided the excellent dinos and such for the previous film) would seem a hindrance, his protege Jim Danforth does a credible job of bringing the various critters to stop-motion life.  There is a plot, of sorts, as newcomer Victoria Vetri is blamed for the appearance of the moon in the sky.  And she befriends one of the smaller dinos, and sheds her tiny fur duds for caveman Patrick Allen (yes, this is the uncut British version with brief nudity).

As with its companion Warners double-feature&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/World-Without-End-Satellite-in-the-Sky/dp/B001EZE5KG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">World Without End/Satellite in the Sky</a>, there are no extras included.  Still, the prints used look fantastic, and it's a small miracle to have either of these films on DVD in ANY condition.

While neither film is a real classic, Hammer fans will appreciate having them in their collections.  And for folks who don't mind the less-demanding thrills of these types of movies, you could do a lot worse.",1220832000,9,2891,5.9228915662650605
3537696,4,B001DS35JQ,"Potential buyers should be aware that this Hammer double-bill set contains the uncut version of When Dinsosaurs Ruled the Earth and not the G rated US theatrical release. Most importantly, it restores Veronica Vetri's brief nude scenes as well as nudity in an earlier scene in which a caveman rips the bra off his mate.",1220313600,8,319,4.818181818181818
8294678,5,B001DS35JQ,"For me this DVD was worth the price.  If I want something and I like the product price is not an issue for me.  As for the films I saw Moon Zero Two when it was originally released and thoroughly enjoyed it,. Then there is When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth which is an excellent film even if it didn't have 2 Fantastic items helping it to begin with:  (1)the special effects are Great, and (2) Victoria Vetri is one fantastic hot looking Blonde BABE and there is certainly nothing wrong with that.  Besides I've always loved dinosaur films.",1489881600,,537,4.448979591836735
8294679,5,B001DS35JQ,"I find the negative, deriding criticism I have heard about When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth, to be unfair.

I thought it was exciting and engaging. Jim Danforth's sculpting and animation is first class, fantastic! The story was good too, with interesting primordeal superstition of an awakening human race, the birth of the Moon, ... and a fetching/harrowing love story as seasoning. This one was more engaging than One Million Years B.C.",1448928000,,436,5.140845070422535
8294680,3,B001DS35JQ,"This DVD is only crazy expensive because of it's rarity.  Mon Zero Two is completely insane. I can't imagine paying attention enough to figure out what the heck is going on. Doughy men acting like they're sexy wear unbecoming grey space jump suits. Beautiful chicks have requisite giant hair pieces and wildly impractical clothes. The station on the moon seems to exist largely as a venue for lounge scale production numbers, much, much choreography When the artificial gravity gets turned off nothing levitates but everyone moves in slo-mo. much too stupid and dull to be even camp fun.
When I was about 13 a friend of mine had an 8mm ten minute version of When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth and I was super envious. I've been kind of fixated on this one ever since. Thus the splurge. My principal misgiving is that Dinosaurs do not rule the Earth to a great enough extent. The animated monsters by Jim Danforth, who's work is always wonderful (He was responsible for the Pegasus animation in Ray Harryhausen's Clash of
the Titans) are by far the best part of the picture. Nothing else lives up to them. This is plainly intended to piggy back onto the popularity of One Million Years BC from two years earlier and it suffers the same terminal fate. Watching actors covered in dirt and fur and talking gibberish is torture. These cave people haven't created a working language but they've engeniered a strapless bra that stays put in a hurricane. The actors show a lot of skin but never seem hot enough to really keep you hooked that way. Dinosaurs = Good. Cave people = Bad",1427328000,,1570,4.667870036101083
8294681,1,B001DS35JQ,"Okay, we all know the story on this now semi-notorious and highly collectible (and highly priced) DVD ... it was released as a Best Buy Exclusive double feature that, on the back, stated that both features were G-Rated.  But, in point of fact, it was the European version of DINOSAURS that contained nude scenes of Playboy Playmate star Victoria Vetri making love to an ugly caveman actor and skinny-dipping and not the G-Rated American version of the film that was contained on this DVD.

First, let me state that I am a hard-core Hammer Films fan ... but only when it comes to their Gothic horror line. Their (then) contemporary ""thrillers"" are mostly pedestrian and uninteresting. Their ""cave girl"" franchise (ONE MILLION YEARS BC, PREHISTORIC WOMAN, CREATURES THE WORLD FORGOT & WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH) leave much to be desired for any fantasy film fan.

WHEN DINOSAURS RULED THE EARTH is among the worst of the worst!!! The made up dialogue gets very old very fast ... even almost immediately. I can't believe that the sub-standard Jim Danforth stop-motion animation actually won awards. It doesn't even begin to compare with Ray Harryhausen's genius artistry. The made-up, non-existent dinosaur's motions are cartoonish at best and beyond laughable and pathetic. Watch Ringo Starr's CAVEMAN to see better special effects and more entertaining dinosaurs.

It is hard to believe that even back in 1970 that this film was seen as anything but amateurish trash. If it wasn't for Victoria Vetri's nude scenes in the European version there would be no redeeming cinematic value and nothing worth watching in this travesty - even though the nudity is very mild and a `natural without being overly graphic. But because of the nudity/sex scenes this film is probably not good even for kiddie fare viewing.

I feel very bad that Vetrie went to prison in reality and had her fairytale life as a Playboy centerfold taken into a most unfortunate turn of events; but she never suffered so much as she did in this banal, boring film.

Use this film ONLY as a non-prescription sleeping pill when you are feeling that self-torture is needed.

I didn't review - or watch - MOON ZERO TWO because it stars James Olson, an actor so ugly and physically repulsive that his face should be used at Poison Control to induce vomiting.  The only thing noteworthy about this film is that it made the ""space-western"" years before STAR WARS erroneously claimed to invent the cinematic concept.

Please be aware that if you are looking for an uncut, unedited version of DINOSAURS with Vetri's nude bod exposed, there are Korean region-free editions of the DVD available on eBay for cheap all the time rather than paying hundreds of dollars for this edition.",1394323200,2,2739,4.911255411255412
8294682,4,B001DS35JQ,"This DVD goes for top dollar since it was pulled off the shelves and never reissued.
I've waited decades to see this film, and the animation is very enjoyable.  While Danforth is not as good an animator as Harryhausen, he manages to stage the scenes well, with atmospheric lighting.
The movie itself is pretty abysmal, like any caveman film made prior to Quest For Fire, but the nude scene with Victoria Vetri is a nice bonus.
With 2 movies crammed onto a single disc, I expected poor picture quality, but it's not bad.
Do we dare hope for a Blu-ray someday?",1369699200,3,558,4.524752475247524
8294683,1,B001DS35JQ,"""Moon Zero Two"" is a 1969 Sci-Fi film (G) that runs an hour and forty minutes. Catherine Schell, Adrienne Corri, and Carol Cleveland star (& some guys too I suppose) in a story about a colony on the moon, human nature, and the future.  This is as good or better than 78% of the stuff that has been released by Hollywood since 2010.  Some call this a space western for the shootouts, claim jumping, hired gunslinger, and dancing saloon girls (there's no nudity).  Catherine Schell is seen in a dimly lit setting in undergarments (nothing showing), but blink and you'll miss that.
""When Dinosaurs Ruled the Earth"" is a 1970/1971 Adventure Fantasy Sci-Fi film about prehistoric men & women.  No dialogue, so-so FX for 1970, but at least there are dinosaurs in this.  I wish I could sort out who is who among the cast, but I only speak Cro-Magnon and Neanderthal, which I think were both partially borrowed from along with Troglodyte and made into as unintelligible as the writers could get for a language to use.  Victoria Vetri, Robin Hawdon, Magda Konopka, Imogen Hassall, Jan Rossini, Carol Hawkins and others appear in this effort to make us believe that the biggest reason stone age people didn't get along was primarily based upon the color of their hair, blonde or brunette.  There is a scene of simulated rape, but it looks like special FX photo-shopped an old woman's face on a man's body for a quick glance, and then there is a short, from a substantial distance sideways, at best a silhouette shot of a pretty woman topless.  Otherwise this film that runs an hour and forty minutes could be shown in church.  Comparing WDRTE to ""Raquel Welch in One Million Years B.C."" is like saying a skinless weenie is as good as a filet at a steakhouse (the filet being OMYBC) other than the fact that blondes were presented as inferior in both stone age films (as does 1967's ""Prehistoric Women"").
If you want female exploitation, this DVD is NOT worth over $18, even with BOTH films, MZT & WDRTE.  I've definitely been had paying more far than that, and deeply regret it.  If you're under 13 years of age - buy this, you'll love it.",1339286400,5,2129,4.605820105820106
8294684,5,B001DS35JQ,"Yes, I gave it 5 out of 5.  First, Moon Zero Two is very likely one of the few hard science fiction films you may ever find from the 60's.  And I love hard sci-fi.  Second, I am a MST3K fan, and Moon Zero Two was done by them.  Also, When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth, while never given the treatment by MST3K, should have been.

First, Moon Zero Two, is Hammer's try at hard sci-fi, at the right time, right when we were landing on the Moon.  They tried to give it the feel of being in the future, with much of the science right, and even gave it a solid, interesting plot.  True, some things seem silly, like the fact the switches that control gravity are open, out in public spaces, available for anybody to turn off or on.  But the feel, even if very much a product of the 60's, is still something I can enjoy watching.

When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth seems to be the third film in a four film run of dinosaurs and half-naked bikini clad cave girls.  In this film the Moon appears, or slowly forms, causing great confusion and mayhem among sun worshipping tribal people.  Add dinosaurs who imprint on humans, the giant crab that seems to appear in a LOT of films, a Playboy Playmate as the main female character, Oscar-nominated effects, and of course Hammer film's rule that all women in their films are always sexy while dangerously jealous - well, you get something to watch on a late night with lots of buttered pop corn and salty chips.  Maybe some mints also?

These 2 Hammer Films,under the banner of Warner Brothers,are a must see for any fans. I agree with others about Moon Zero Two.'Billed as'The first moon western'while this is a Slow-moving Picture and in this day and age of C.G.I,it doesnt have a lot to offer in effects,The Director:Roy Ward Baker, gave it his best shot to capture a western feel to science fiction. When Dinosaurs Ruled The Earth,is a TREAT for any fan whom has watched the G-rated version over the years and can finally see Hammer Films Studios Un-cut version. Victoria Vetri,playmate of the year,1968 is ALL THAT!Val Guest,Veteran of Hammer classic films,Quatermass 2:enemy from space and others,Directs this classic with a sure hand,and the quality of video/visual and Audio on this double feature gives BLU-RAY a run for their Money!
