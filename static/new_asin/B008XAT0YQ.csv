5189171,3,B008XAT0YQ,"I had just seen the film Lincoln, and thought this was it. Naturally, when the documentaries arrived I was disappointed. But they were worth watching.",1367539200,2,150,5.04
5189172,5,B008XAT0YQ,I have 4 different videos of Lincoln and this is the best. My advice is look no further if you are looking for a good movie of Lincoln. There is very little of the Civil war in this movie. It is the politics of of the times and gives a pretty good understanding of how the political game is played.,1367193600,3,298,3.9833333333333334
5189173,5,B008XAT0YQ,"The movie and subsequent documentaries about Lincoln are very good and informative.  Glad I bought it, since my husband is very much interested in the civil war and persons of interest at the time.",1366675200,,197,4.794117647058823

5189190,5,B008XAT0YQ,"Great documentary set. The reenactments of the battle were well done. Very well-documented set. The movie was interesting, considering when it was made. Great for all Civil War buffs.",1410307200,,183,5.344827586206897

5189192,5,B008XAT0YQ,Item received promptly.  No problems.,1405468800,,37,6.4
5189193,5,B008XAT0YQ,WONDERFUL. EDUCATIONALLY SOUND. VERY GOOD AND THOUGHT PROVOKING ALTHOUGH I AM NOT AN AMERICAN I THINK THIS EXCEPTIONAL PERSON'S LIFE MUST BE SHARED AND PEOPLE CAN LEARN FROM THIS DVD.,1395014400,,183,5.133333333333334
5189194,1,B008XAT0YQ,"Boring acting, bad writing, and simply time I will never get back fro viewing this dvd. Avoid it,  Stick with PBS or even some History Channel efforts.",1389225600,,151,4.592592592592593
5189195,1,B008XAT0YQ,"Lincoln... A war criminal  600,000 Americans died because of this scum. For what ????
 This animals unconstitutional desires. C'mon Americans!!! Get educated! Learn the true history
 instead of silly myths sold to grade school children.",1387584000,,236,5.685714285714286
5189196,5,B008XAT0YQ,"History value is well made >< an honest look at some of the dark sides of life that faced our greatest leader, and the events that shaped those tragic days of American History.l",1384905600,,177,4.393939393939394
5189197,3,B008XAT0YQ,Strictly a documentary.  The grade and quality of high school studies.  There was much to learn but it never approached what surely Lincoln must have known and felt in his all too brief a leadership of our nation.,1378252800,,213,4.578947368421052
5189198,5,B008XAT0YQ,really great movie. Enjoyed every minute of it. Actually watched several times. I am very sick & dvd's help me.,1375142400,5,111,4.6
5189199,5,B008XAT0YQ,"There was a clear and consistent effort to be as accurate and authentic as possible in the creation of this DVD series. Outside of the feature film, the historical recreations are intense, layered and detailed with great care in the costumes and historical truth and authenticity along with the powerful voice of narrator Coby Batty and other voice actors help to bring these stories to life.",1374364800,2,392,4.954545454545454
5189200,2,B008XAT0YQ,"I would most definitely not buy this trash, as that is all it is. There is nothing new that we did not already know.",1373932800,,116,3.875
5189201,2,B008XAT0YQ,"We did not like this film and feature.  Maybe it is because others better, would not buy again, not good.",1373068800,,105,4.25
5189202,5,B008XAT0YQ,"I found this documentary not only well done but very interesting as well. It brought out the fact quite clearly that he did not suffer fools quietly. In more than one instance he firmly but evenly spoke to his cabinet members while president raising his voice only rarely. Also, he was able to show a very humble side with great compassion for others. A truly  remarkable individual speaking for the common man and although not much seen anymore he also  was truly a man of principles.",1372550400,4,485,4.627906976744186
5189203,3,B008XAT0YQ,"This very low-priced three-DVD set is an odd mishmash of docudramas and old feature films that focus on various aspects of Abraham Lincoln and the period in which he lived. It represents nearly nine hours of viewing and is available at a bargain price. If you're a history buff, you should find parts of it worthwhile. The contents:

Disc 1: ""Lincoln: Trial by Fire"" - a 60-minute dramatization of the power struggle between President Lincoln and General McClellan as well as the events leading up to the Emancipation Proclamation, narrated by Cliff Robertson / ""They've Killed President Lincoln"" - a 60-minute docudrama about Lincoln's assassination, narrated by Richard Basehart

Disc 2: ""No Retreat from Destiny: The Battle That Rescued Washington"" - a 106-minute historical drama about the Confederacy's last great invasion of the North in July 1864 / ""Lincoln's Last Night"" - a 105-minute docudrama about Lincoln's death at the hands of John Wilkes Booth / ""Fired by Liberty: Black Soldiers of the Civil War"" - a documentary on the African-American soldiers of the Civil War, including combat reenactments

Disc 3: ""Abraham Lincoln"" - director D.W. Griffith's first talkie from 1930, a creaky 97-minute black-and-white biopic starring Walter Huston as Lincoln / ""Yellowneck"" - a mediocre 83-minute adventure drama in color from 1955 about Confederate deserters trying to escape from Florida to Cuba",1372464000,23,1403,5.2825112107623315

5189205,3,B008XAT0YQ,I wasn't as excited about this as I thought I would be...  I have many other DVDs about Lincoln that are a little better.  The recent Movies of Lincoln was excellent.  I will have to watch this one again...maybe I wasn't in the right mood for it...,1369958400,2,248,4.23404255319149
5189206,5,B008XAT0YQ,THIS IS OK AS FAR IF YOU LIKE LINCOLN THE BONUS FEATURE IS OK TO MARY LINCOLN IS NOT THAT GREAT BUT WHAT DO EXCPET FOR  D. W. GRIFFTH,1368835200,,133,3.586206896551724
8532046,5,B008XAT0YQ,This DVD set on Abraham Lincoln is Surpurb and has many surprises and additional movies! A great buy for the money especially if you know Very little about this Great man and President.,1522368000,,185,4.636363636363637
8532047,4,B008XAT0YQ,Good documentary to watch,1498003200,,25,5.5
8532048,1,B008XAT0YQ,"Of the 5 disks in this set, I literally threw 4 of them away they were so bad and useless. Even though this is not expensive, it is not worth the money -- productions from 40 years ago in some cases, and a film of a reenactment that makes no dang sense. Save your money for better productions and better values.",1482796800,,311,4.114754098360656
8532049,5,B008XAT0YQ,Very good historical perspective!  Excellent to understand presidential leadership.  Excellent for ethical leadership reference.,1470614400,,128,8.071428571428571

8532051,1,B008XAT0YQ,"This was the worst film I have seen in years.  It consists of 3 discs. Very poor quality, blurry pictures, poor audio.  The first disc is like it has been patched together from several very old tapes.  There is a background sssssssss sound the entire disc. unnerving. The 2nd disc is a hoot for the horrible acting and fake beards. The ""n"" word is even used, not acceptable in any venue. The information did not deal with the problems with Mary Todd nor their son's death in anything but in passing. We could not even watch the next 2 documentaries it was so awful. The last documentary on this disc is the only good part of the 3 entire discs.  It is regarding the Black soldiers and how they were used during the civil war. Very informational and decent photography and audio. Now the 3rd disc is like something out of the silent movie era. black and white, awful acting. poor quality, scratchy, picture jumping all over. no kind of cohesive format. it's just awful. spend a little more and get THE HISTORY CHANNEL AND LINCOLN AND THE CIVIL WAR.",1444521600,,1047,4.494736842105263
