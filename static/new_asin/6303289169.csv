8571268,5,6303289169,"If your child is into trucks and big equipment, this is a real winner!  Peppy music, lots of action, no dull or boring spots.  As with any video for a two year old, be prepared to see it over and over.  This one is  actually interesting, and you can learn new things for the first dozen or  so viewings!  You'll see the whole story of garbage day, from early morning  coffee, to dumpsters, rolloffs, recycling, and landfills. My child liked  the child in the video, the dog bringing recylcing, and all the friendly  garbage men waving.  I liked the compressor full of waterballoons, the  backwards video in the landfill, and the water-melon crushing scene.  Something for everyone if you absolutely must watch a half hour about  garbage!",940204800,7,737,4.708661417322834
