8452218,5,B00513DLM0,"TO DIE LIKE A MAN has one of the most pungent endings that I ever saw in my whole life. We know that the use of a beautiful song in the last scene of a film can transform it, make it more imprsssive etc. but seldom it merges so deeply with the characters, the story and the pathos of a work of art. This particular kind of portuguese song, the fado, a mix of arab sadness with medieval ballad, sung by a no nonsense tranvestite, completly different of all the others I ever saw in a gay film, a very sad gay film, it is simply operatic and  leaves you filled with a wagnerian joy, if this thing exists. Like in a Genet book, this tale of the sad and sordid decadence of a transvestite and her liaison with a very much younger junkie and suicidal lover at the end leads to their tragic deaths is one of the most moving story of l'amour fou that I ever saw in a movie. And once more Joo Pedro Rodrigues proves that he is a most important film director in our sad days.",1403827200,,966,4.057591623036649
