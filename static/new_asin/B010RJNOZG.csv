7316253,5,B010RJNOZG,"A very funny, family friendly zombie movie made in Maine!  Will be a cult movie for sure! Hope there will be more in the future! :-)",1444953600,,132,4.076923076923077
7316254,5,B010RJNOZG,"This film is amazing. I've watched it over and over and laugh every single time! Zombie movies are not usually my favorite genre, but this one is way different. The acting is excellent, the humor is top notch, and the concept behind the story is great, too! I especially love the original song at the very end during the credits. And yes, I'm partial....my husband wrote it. :-)",1444953600,2,378,4.573529411764706
7316255,5,B010RJNOZG,"A great movie that has you wondering how they are going to rid Maine of all those zombies.  Imaginative, funny and scary all rolled into one!!  Support the growing Maine film company and enjoy the show!!",1444953600,,203,4.611111111111111

7316258,5,B010RJNOZG,A cult classic if I've ever seen one.  Mack and son are out to save the world (or at least the state of Maine) from the zombie hordes.  This should be in everyone's queue for the Halloween season.,1444176000,2,196,4.131578947368421
7316259,2,B010RJNOZG,Acting wasn't great but it did have several humorous moments. My favorite being the redhead saying she wasn't a whore. The show was stupid but funny.,1482796800,,149,4.769230769230769

7316263,4,B010RJNOZG,"Mack (Bill Steven McLean) is six miles north of Portland, Maine with his son Jesse (Ben McLean) teaching him manhood survivor skills when a localized zombie outbreak occurs. They travel to Portland in their plastic window Jeep saving Ashley (Hannah Elaine Perry) along the way. They end up in the building where the whole incident started attempting to save the innocent people who work there...even those that don't want their help. Jesse has a notebook and keeps track of the different ways he kills zombies, hence the title, although a comprehensive list would have been nice.

This is the second best zombie film to come out of Portland, Maine (""Night of the Living Deb"" was #1 in case you had doubt). It is designed to be a camp cult film, and certainly has many elements to make it one. It spoofs the zombie craze. The dialogue had humor and the characters were quirky and they had effective running gags. Acting was poor by design...I think. Pretty good for a low budget film. Decent sound, camera angle, and no mics in the picture. Nice to see someone actually use what they learned at film school.

No swearing, sex, or nudity.",1477526400,,1136,4.703517587939698

7316267,2,B010RJNOZG,"okay, so it was fun... in an awful sort of a way. If you are somehow entertained by just how horrible and campy a movie is. If terrible acting is funny - and the movie is more fun because of how ridiculous it is... then this could give you a chuckle - I'm a fan of really bad horror films, but this one missed the mark - although I'm not completely sorry I watched it.",1476144000,,368,3.92

I think it could have been fun had the budget been bigger with better actors and photography.

If you want to be entertained with a mockfest on the Zombie genre. This is for you.

Here is what I thought was overdone. The jokes were a bit overdone. Not every single situation or event required a joke. I also had a hard time believing even a survivalist and his son would be out in the woods with a huge supply of guns and endless ammunition. I would have loved for them to incorporate more non gun zombie kills.

It is worth a couple hours of your time to watch and be entertained. I don't feel they were passing the production off as anything more than What you see is what you get spoof.",1455580800,,676,4.349206349206349

7316319,2,B010RJNOZG,"Every member of the cast and crew must have voted on this to get the rating up to 3.5 stars. It's not the worst kind of indy film, it looks better than a school project. The best actors here are mediocre but much of the supporting players are downright bad. The editing is subpar and destroys the rhythm of conversations. The dialogue is sometimes hamfisted but there's a few truly comical moments (done on purpose). The father son dynamic was a fun angle and they almost pulled it off. I think the director wasn't quite up to the task of making it work though. I would not pay out of pocket for this movie.

And then leave him behind as fodder for the zombies. He's shown no responsibility and no survival skills since he was first introduced. It got worse after the first zombie. Completely unbelievable. He screams like a b*tch when he pulls off a zombie arm after killing zombies with no emotion. He plays loud music to draw zomies to him. He ignores his father when he yells ""zombie!"". He dives out of a car onto a zombie with no weapon drawn and gives him his back. And then! He wants to find a girlfriend! It becomes his focus instead of learning how to survive in this new world.

From now on I'm checking studios before I buy anything again. At least their track record is really consistent. I don't know how these guys stay in business. This isn't the worst BD film I've seen by any means and there are some really cool effects and funny zingers. But not enough to convert me to becoming a fan. The stupid ass reoccurring spray bottle joke is annoying and over this dummies head.

8723048,4,B010RJNOZG,"I was going to go with 3 stars, but this is actually a pretty solid little zom-com. The acting was in the better range for low budget indies, and while the zombie horde make-up was slap and dash,the hero zombies weren't too shabby. Quite a few running gags and bits physical comedy, but not so much that the thing devolves into slapstick. The story is pretty tight, though the first 10 minutes or so are a bit of a slog, and everyone involved was really giving it what they had. On the nitpick side, for guys that are supposed to be survivalists they sure do rack the slides a lot on their pistols when by all rights the weapons should already be chambered (those that know what that means will know what I'm talking about), and though we see one of the leads with a shotgun in a few scenes it never seems to be around when the zombies are.
