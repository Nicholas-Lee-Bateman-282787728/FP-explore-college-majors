What an awful collection. Stick with the Hal Roach Studio comedies they made from 1927-35. Those are their quality work. Everything else is disappointing if not downright awful.",1297555200,,330,4.807017543859649
1910126,5,B0000C23GY,Bought this for my son who would laugh so hard watching as a child. HE is sharing it with his son now.,1292371200,,102,3.6818181818181817
1910127,1,B0000C23GY,Not worth more than 5 bucks. They don't make it clear but there are at least 75% silent films here are bad ones at that. There's nothing else to say after that. Don't buy this one. You'll just get pissed.,1280275200,,204,4.125
1910128,5,B0000C23GY,"I love the old movies and this was a great one to add. The shipping was in a very timley manner for Christmas. The DVDS were well packaged and the provider was excellent!

1910129,4,B0000C23GY,"*** I prefer there film work after being together for #3 to 10yrs.straight rather than there late stuff before retirement. However, most Laurel & Hardy films are pure comic genius for anyone that likes pure (think green) organic comedy! Classic's!",1251849600,,247,5.2

1910132,2,B0000C23GY,"I wanted movies with them together. Many of these films don't have them as actors, but they may have directed it or they are in the films individually. Boo... very disappointed!",1231632000,2,177,4.741935483870968

1910134,4,B0000C23GY,"What a great DVD package! Platinum's 2-disc ""Laurel & Hardy-TV Classics"" edition is a great tribute to present some of the earlier solo works of one of the most beloved and greatest comedy teams in film history!! Disc one in the collection contain the following shorts SAW MILL,KID SPEED,ENOUGH TO DO,WEST OF THE HOT DOG,ORANGES AND LEMONS,TREE IN A TEST TUBE (an educational short made by the U.S. Forest Service Dept. and their only film appearance in color!),and their first onscreen appearance together,LUCKY DOG.Plus,you'll also get their last feature film UTOPIA (which for some strange reason has Hal Roach credits since this film was made outside the U.S.).Disc two features the 'other' L & H public domain feature FLYING DEUCES and the following shorts PAPER HANGERS HELPER,YES NANETTE,HOP TO IT BELLHOP,the Hal Roach-produced STOLEN JOLES (which features Wallace Berry,Edward G.Robinson,The Little Rascals,and Laurel & Hardy in the famous car-trouble scene!),and Stan Laurel's three-reeler MUD AND SAND.All the films in this collection have good,but not great picture and sound quality and all of their silent shorts contain music scores (with the exception of MUD AND SAND which is totally silent!).This is an absolute must-have DVD for any Laurel & Hardy fan and is an absolute opporatunity to see Stan and Ollie in their solo shorts,most of which haven't been seen in almost six decades! Thank you Platinum for preserving and presenting the early years of Laurel & Hardy!!! Long live Stan & Ollie!!!",1079568000,29,1512,5.25206611570248

7998157,1,B0000C23GY,"Folks, if you love Laurel and Hardy, you probably have all of the stuff on here that matters.

Much of this is the ubiqitous public domain stuff you can find anywhere else, with some REALLY BAD silent ""comedies"" made before the teaming of Laurel and Hardy.

""Lucky Dog,"" the first comedy with L&H appears, but only HALF THE FILM is shown. This weak collection stops after the robbery scene that marks L&H's debut.

""Utopia"" and ""Flying Deuces,"" which appear in almost every L&H DVD collection, are here for the ride (which will be exactly what you'll be taken on if you waste money on this set).

In other words, don't bother. Superior collections of L&H exist.",1323129600,,661,4.672413793103448
