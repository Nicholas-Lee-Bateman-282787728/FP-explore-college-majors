2278954,4,B0009CTVKO,"I brought this for my 3 year old niece. She loves Dora but she especially liked the babies. Her favorite part of the dvd was when the babies climbed into the carriage and it was headed toward the Gooey Geyser. Dora,Boots, her mother and father,grandmother all set out to stop the babies carriage. Along the way there was sleeping flowers,Bees and grandma swings on a vine. Plus there's two bonuses Baby Dino and Por Favor. She loved baby dino,It's about a baby dinosaur who needs dora and boots help to get to Dino Island where his mommy is waiting for him. There's a part where they have to tippy toe pass a T-Rex and my niece got up and pertended to also. This was a great dvd. There's music and my niece loved singing along.",1138233600,3,727,4.392592592592592
2278955,5,B0009CTVKO,"If your child loves Dora as my son does, then this is a must have.  Dora's family has an addition of her twin brother and sister who have super powers.  This DVD also has 2 additional episodes.",1130803200,5,193,4.1891891891891895
2278956,5,B0009CTVKO,I loved it!  Cartoons like this teach children and I noticed that they really put attention to Dora with her stories and making the children participate.  Dora really makes kids very happy in special my granddaughter.  I intend to buy more DVDs of Dora The Explorer.,1126483200,7,266,4.739130434782608
2278957,5,B0009CTVKO,"Bought this DVD for our granddaughter Kiersten,a few days ago to watch when she stayed overnight by us(Grandma&Grandpa)It was a hit with her. She loves little babies,so this was a perfect tape for her. As for some of the feedback on Nick Jr. about this being a bad one for portraying the babies as super babies,I don't think those people listened. In the beginning of this episode,Dora is telling a story to the babies. It is a story about super babies ,but it is ONLY a story. The second episode is also Dora telling a silly story about the babies and her family. There are two more episodes on this DVD about a baby dinosaur and another one that tells you the magic word Please(in Spanish).We had seen all these episodes on Nick,but only once,so it was enjoyable to watch.",1123372800,15,774,4.535714285714286

2278982,5,B0009CTVKO,I received the movie ahead of schedule and it is a gift for my daughter for Christmas. I purchased it online because it is difficult to find this one in the store.

2278983,5,B0009CTVKO,"My daughter, who is almost 2, use to never watch tv, only a few seconds here and there. Well my friend bought this dvd and played it in their van's dvd player for her daughter. The first time my daughter watched it she was hooked! Every time she is tired she starts saying baby and points to the tv. My nephew who is the same age as my daughter also loves this movie. I swear we've watched it 100 times or more in the past 2 months! This is a great movie for kids to watch while you're trying to get stuff done around the house! I highly recommend it!",1318550400,,551,4.0181818181818185
2278984,5,B0009CTVKO,"My 4 yr old granddaughter just LOVES Dora the Explorer movies!!!  She especially liked this one because of the babies...This movie has a cute story line and is educational, as well!  Some of the language is in English, while some of it is in Spanish! Most Dora DVDs are made so the child can interact by answering questions and repeating words.  Two thumbs up!!!",1302912000,,362,4.625
2278985,5,B0009CTVKO,"My daughter loves Dora and has this book, so the movie was the perfect thing to get her.  She absolutely loves Dora and loves the Super Babies!",1294358400,,143,4.296296296296297
2278986,2,B0009CTVKO,"The fact the character says two or three words in spanish, doesnt mean it is in spanish. There is no language selection, so the only choice is english, but it said both english and spanish in the description. I felt robbed, because english is not our native language.",1265760000,,267,4.583333333333333

2278999,5,B0009CTVKO,"My daughter loves Dora's twin brother and sister, and adored the original ""Super Babies"" episode, so we were thrilled to see a new DVD featuring the twins. This DVD did not disappoint! In the title episode, Dora and the Super twins go on a storytime adventure to find the missing Dream Fairy and help bring happy naptime dreams to all the waiting babies. This was an adorable episode that featured several favorite lullabies like ""Rockabye Baby,"" as well as a replay of the original ""Super Babies"" song. We loved it!

The other episodes on this DVD include ""Dora Helps the Birthday Wizzle"" - yes, another favorite friend from old - ""Pirate Treasure Hunt,"" and ""Benny's Treasure"". All four of these were newer episodes that we hadn't previously seen on TV, which was especially nice as most of the Nick Jr videos we've had in the past include only two ""new"" episodes along with two older, early season ones that we've seen 1,000 times already. Overall, a very nice DVD!",1249862400,3,968,4.727810650887574
2279000,5,B0009CTVKO,"My friends daughter (who I bought this for) absolutely loves it!  We had borrowed it from the library & liked it so much we decided to purchase it.  During a recent trip, she watched it numerous times while flying & then many times with various family members.  A great addition to anyone with a Dora collection",1242604800,,311,4.517857142857143
2279001,4,B0009CTVKO,"I personally didn't like this Dora feature, the ""Super Babies!!"" repeated multiple times in less than 10 min. got to me quick. But I guess the important part is the little girls I Nanny liked it a lot. The shipping was great too, very quick and the DVD was brand new like stated. Thank you!",1202428800,,290,4.290909090909091
2279002,5,B0009CTVKO,This dvd is a must for any child who loves Dora. My daughter loves this dvd and now wants the Super Babies!,1178409600,,107,3.909090909090909
2279003,1,B0009CTVKO,"As a father I was horrified at the premise and events during the episode where Dora's twin sibs fall out of bed into their stroller, which then proceeds to roll away downhill toward the Gooey Geyser, past numerous obstacles, well beyond the reach of their parents.  Doesn't anyone find this the least bit disturbing? As if this weren't enough, when Dora's mami and papi join her in pursuit, they end up singing, clapping and laughing along the way.  Excuse me... your babies fell out the window and are careening through the countryside, out of control, downhill toward a geyser.  Knowing how impressionable my three-year-old is, it should be interesting the first time she puts her baby dollies in her toy stroller and sends it screaming down the hill to chase it, just like Dora.  This otherwise wonderful show for kids really dropped the ball on this one -- shame on them.",1152316800,5,875,4.774834437086093
2279004,5,B0009CTVKO,"I am a daycare provider and I recently purchased this DVD for my daycare kids.  They absolutely LOVE Dora the Explorer, and the Super Babies episode is one of their favorite!  The kids really like helping Dora and her family track down the babies when their stroller takes off with the babies inside!

I read another review where they questioned the ""goo goo ga ga"" phrase that the Super Babies say. Although children of all ages do seem to repeat this phrase, I've found that it isn't a negative thing in my daycare.  Kids LOVE babies... ALL BABIES!  My kids love repeating ""goo goo ga ga"" because it is what babies say, not because their language is regressing.  I do have some children who are speech delayed and not only has ""goo goo ga ga"" been great for them to repeat (because sounds are not always easy for kids with speech delay, and every word is a triump for them), but all the words Dora has the kids repeat helps increase the vocabulary skills of all the kids!

What a great show for kids to be interactive and imaginitive!  For those quieter kids it really helps get them involved!  This DVD would be perfect for any home!",1147219200,4,1136,4.449275362318841
2279005,3,B0009CTVKO,"My daughter absolutely loves Dora the Explorer and we have sevaral of her DVDs.  I particularily cannot stand the ""Super Babies"" episode on this DVD.  The babies consitently say ""Goo Goo Ga Ga"" and my daughter, who speaks perfectly fine, has taken to repeating this phrase.  I don not understand why anyone would promote remedial language skills for young children.  I just think that they did a really bad job with this particular episode.",1141776000,4,440,4.905405405405405
