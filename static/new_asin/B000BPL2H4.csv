2436424,5,B000BPL2H4,"I just finished watching 'A Piece of the Action' and I have to admit that this film is now my all-time favorite. Both Sidney and Bill are outstanding. Denise Nicholas, James Earl Jones, and Sheryl Lee Ralph...man that whole cast was/is to die for. The movie was not supposed to be a comedy, but more action/drama related; so I disagree with anything less than 5 stars. I will be watching this movie once a week until the dvd does not work anymore!",1235606400,,447,4.463414634146342
2436425,4,B000BPL2H4,"There are a handful of scenes in 'Uptown Saturday Night' that had me laughing almost uncontrollably.  When a movie can produce even a few scenes that double you over, you can't help but recommend it.  'Uptown Saturday Night' is a buddy movie with Bill Cosby (sporting a hair-do from what appears to be Colonial times) and Sidney Portier.  The two men go 'uptown' in pursuit of a winning lottery ticket and all sorts of mayhem ensue.  What makes this team-up work is the almost opposites attract style both men bring to the role.  Bill Cosby is a natural.  He doesn't even look like he's trying and yet he always brings in a great comedic performance.  Sidney turns on his almost supernatural charm and wins points on how hard he's trying.  Together, the two make a great duo.  The cast is a whos who of 70s entertainment, and it's fun to see people like Harry Belafonte drop the cool and go for laughs. -- I have to drop a star because of ""A Piece of the Action"" which is also a comedy, but not nearly as funny.  Bill and Sidney are back, and working with troubled urban kids, and the result is a not-completely-successful mix of comedy and morality tale.  The two try hard enough and that's part of the problem, they look like they are trying too hard in a movie that doesn't know whether to go for laughs or wrench at your heart.  It's not bad ... it's just middle-of-the-road.  But, importantly, this disc has 'Uptown Saturday Night' and that is more than enough reason to own this.",1234310400,3,1485,4.4758364312267656
