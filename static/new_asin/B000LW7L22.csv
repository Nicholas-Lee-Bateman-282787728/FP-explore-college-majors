2715317,5,B000LW7L22,"As a bonafide Scruggster, I've heard about these shows for years. I was on the preliminary list as soon as I found out the shows were becoming available. If you want to see how this music should be played get this DVD! I got both of them. They are head and shoulders above any other music I have on DVD's. The banjo-fiddle arrangements will leave your toe tapping for half a day!

A great big Thank You  for the people who made produced these DVD's! Hopefully there will be many more.",1178496000,,484,4.3076923076923075

2715349,4,B000LW7L22,"Lots of fun to watch.  I really enjoyed this one, and it brought back many great memories of their old ""Martha White"" show.  The music was clear and clean and I even enjoyed the old commericals.  Very enjoyable.",1205798400,,211,4.5
2715350,5,B000LW7L22,"This is a wonderful collection of the Flatt and Scruggs in their glory days, takes me back to watching the originals with my grandmother. I remember the dresses she made for my sister from some of the old flour and corn meal sacks those many years ago.  They even included the original Martha White commercials and I swear that you will want to make and eat biscuits when you watch these programs.",1194480000,,397,4.513888888888889
2715351,5,B000LW7L22,"Long time Flatt & Scruggs collectors (as me), aswell as bluegrass collectors have long been awaiting for the official release of these DVDs.
Bootleg copies of some Martha White and Pet Milk shows have been circulating for quite some time, first on 5 VHS, then on 2 DVDs.
However, quality was very often not high, color wasn't balanced etc...
These DVDs are a real treat! The quality has been incredibly enhanced, and the audio track must have been remastered too, as it's much better than the bootleg copies.
Now to the music, useless to say that the Foggy Mountain Boys deliver the best in traditional bluegrass music. Lester's smooth voice, solid yet fluid guitar style and runs and warm behaviour are fully featured in these shows. As always, Earl Scruggs is perfect, tasteful, driving and with a tone that is just amazing! In some shows, you'll get to watch close ups of Earl's hands, and that's already a good reason to buy the DVDs. The ""corny comedy"" skits that dobro player Josh Graves and bassist Jake Tullock do on the shows are classics, and their vocal duets are a real gem.
Last but by no mean least, you have Paul Warren, as Lester used to say ""Still what we think one of the best old-time fiddlers in the business"" at top form, fiddlin' his way to your heart, and tenor singing-extraordinaire Curly Seckler, playing mandolin with the Foggies. There is something so enigmatic in Curly's face while he sings and plays that's just a pleasure to see.
The DVDs include the most famous hits of the band, plus old time fiddle numbers, banjo instrumentals by Earl, and great duets.

There exist a total of 36 episodes of the Flatt & Scruggs show, all donated to the CMHOF. Rumors has it that all episodes are going to be released in the future with the help of Shanachie. Well, we can't wait to get them all!!

All this to say, if you're a bluegrass fan get yours now. It won't get any better than this!!",1193875200,,1911,4.568513119533527

2715357,5,B000LW7L22,"These two volumes of the Flatt & Scruggs TV Show are an outstanding addition to the history of bluegrass.  The performances are top notch and quality of the films are excellent.  As far as I can tell from the DVDs, each show was filmed live and without a lot of retakes, so it is more like watching a Flatt & Scruggs performance of the era than a TV show.  There are even a few surprises-- on the first show in Volume 2, Lester Flatt announces a banjo tune called Farewell Blues.  Then Earl Scruggs jumps in and plays Fire Ball Mail.  At the end of the song, Lester, obviously a little ruffled, makes some jokes about how much Farewell Blues had changed and Earl kind of sheepishly says something about it being a last minute request.  It's a very unscripted moment, and demonstrates the live/one-take nature of these shows.  It was also interesting to see that the TV shows were organized pretty much in the same way the radio shows were.  There would be a slick banjo number, a lively trio, a sacred quartet, some rube comedy and a duet between Cousin Jake and Uncle Josh, a heart song, and fiddle and banjo number, and a rousing finale.  Throughout it all, you get a real performance from the band.  Since they were in their prime, the performances are all outstanding. But there are the occasional rough spots too-- on a fiddle and banjo number, Paul Warren plays the tune impeccably, and Scruggs does a wonderful job but kind of muffs the ending.  Lester then comments ""well Earl, you keep practicing it and you'll learn how to end it someday"" (paraphrase).  In other words, all the interplay and dynamics that would come across in a live performance are in play on these tapes.  Each DVD volume contains 2 shows, one each featuring a special guest.  Mother Maybelle Carter is the guest on Vol. 2, and it's wonderful to see her.  The guest on the first volume is Hylo Brown.  For me, the wonderful thing about these DVDs is that you really get a chance to see one of the groundbreaking bands in bluegrass at their prime, live and unedited.  I only hope more volumes are on the way!",1179100800,13,2086,4.4907161803713525

8164639,5,B000LW7L22,"Hey, I'm older than dirt and this takes me back when I used to watch them on TV, Martha White cornbread, biscuits and all. You would enjoy this even if you ain't old. I saw Lester Flatt once driving down the street in a little one horse town in Kentucky. He had a loudspeaker on his car and was promoting his concert that night. This was way before he became well known. This is a down to earth style of entertainment that everyone can enjoy even if you don't like ""Blue Grass"" very well, but how in the world could you not like it?",1358294400,,532,4.125
8164640,5,B000LW7L22,"These guys got their start with Bill Monroe then went on to better him in all respects. These guys have been influential to all modern bluegrass bands but few come close to having the stage presence of these guys. I can watch this DVD over and over and never tire of it. Break out your instrument and jam along with.  They lack the athletic instrumental solo prowess of modern day hot shot pickers but they are a solid rhythm machine that gives away nothing to the whiz kids of today..
Love the comedy routines with cousin Jake and uncle Josh. Go listen to The Kentucky Colonels, Hot Rize, Dry Branch Fire Squad, Del McCoury and you'll see the influence that Flatt and Scruggs had on them. You'll also hear stuff on these dvd's that don't get put on cd's. The cd's are all Lester and Earl whereas the live performances really highlight the talent of the rest of the band. The talent of this band runs deep, real deep. With rare exceptions your modern day bands have a Marquis leader with young unknowns backing them up. Each one of these guys could be a dynamic band leader on his own,. Ironically except Earl who never seems to say anything. But his pickin and grinnin are still infectious. Add this to your cart now, or hop on over to Netflix and watch it streamed before you buy.",1310774400,,1282,4.432203389830509
