Michelle Kwan - ""This Time Around"" (2001)

At approximately 100 minutes, and with such a range of skaters, there's something for everyone, with one performance by each with the exception of Isabel Brasseur & Lloyd Eisler.

Michelle Kwan's ""This Time Around"" is rightfully last: a gorgeous and complex go-for-broke skate which more than deserved the norm for her: standing ovation.

The video is of excellent resolution on my upscaling blu-ray drive and HDTV, beginning to end, and the sound is both excellent and surround on surround systems.",1291334400,7,1980,5.064417177914111
