8274083,5,B0019H6IXG,"For those of you that like FMP, you'll love Fumoffu. It is pretty much just a high school love comedy. It's FMP minus the mecha and evil dudes. It's pretty over the top, but way fun. The animation is just as good if not a bit better, and the soundtrack is also great. In Fumoffu there are also some new and colorful characters introduced. We also get the pleasure of seeing new sides to some of the old ones. I simply love FMP Fumoffu and I hope you do too.",1353888000,,457,4.088888888888889
8274084,5,B0019H6IXG,"different from the other full metal panic series  as theres no serious action, however this series is hilarious.  I loved all 3 Full metal panic series... this one was the most hilarious in my opinion, the others had a lot more action this series takes place in-between the acton...I definitely recommend this one if you enjoyed the 1st(Full metal panic) or 3rd(Full metal panic the 2nd raid) series  FMP 1,2 &3 are favorites of mine  The blu ray collection was recently relesed",1293494400,,478,4.7926829268292686
8274085,4,B0019H6IXG,"This companion series to Full Metal Panic focus on the romantic comedy high school aspects of the series. It's not really necessary to watch to enjoy Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid (the actual follow-up to the original series).

The first 2/3 of the episodes are great to watch and are usually split into two shorter segments. Unfortunately, the last third, where each segment is a full episode, loses the comedic edge. There are still funny parts, but not as many. Instead we get some too over-the-top segments and too much fan service.

If you liked the comedic high school aspects of the original Full Metal Panic series then you will like this series. Even the weaker last third has it's moments (e.g. Kaname all dressed up in a kimono) and the first two thirds are definitely worth watching.

The last third knocks this from 5 stars down to 4. But it's still a great series, especially if you cannot get enough of Kaname and Sousuke. And the English dub is as usual good -- I mean, how do you beat Luci Christian and Chris Patton anyway?!
