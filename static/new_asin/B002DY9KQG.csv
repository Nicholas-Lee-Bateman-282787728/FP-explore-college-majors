3913723,5,B002DY9KQG,"I agree with everyone regarding this classic 1936 horror film. The other two comedies are actually enjoyable and kind of funny, but definitely grade-B movies. I never saw ""Frankenstein 1970"", and even when I buy this disc, I may never see it. It just doesn't interest me.

But ""The Walking Dead""...

Excellent horror / sci-fi / gangster / courtroom drama. Sounds like a lot to pack into 72 minutes, but it works. And Karloff actually looks a lot like the classic 1931 Frankenstein monster in a lot of the scenes, especially from a distance when lit from underneath. One of William K. Everson's ""Classics Of The Horror Film"" (look the book up on Amazon and buy it!), which made me search the title out in the first place.

The laserdisc transfer was excellent, so this should look as good or better.",1253664000,4,798,4.6453900709219855
3913724,5,B002DY9KQG,"""The Walking Dead"" is a true gem with a fine cast, and I'm delighted that it is finally on DVD so I can throw out my bootleg VHS from a 16mm master. It is the best of several movies Karloff made in which he is wronged and either executed (The Man They Could Not Hang, The Walking Dead), frozen alive (The Man With Nine Lives), or sent to jail (Before I Hang) and of course returns with murder on his mind, such as revenge on his persecutors. It is also, like Black Friday, ambiguous about the role of the supernatural.

This set is easily worth the price even if you throw out the other three movies. And you may want to. ""Frankenstein 1970"" appeared on Million Dollar Movie in the 1950s, and as I kid I watched it a half-dozen times in the hope that somehow it would eventually live up to its title. It never did. It's at best mildly interesting, once, but I know I won't be able to sit through it again. (Note added October 20, 2009: I couldn't. Quit after 15 minutes.)

I wish I could say something good about ""Zombies on Broadway"" or ""You'll Find Out,"" but I can't. At this point, they're nothing more than curiosities, cheap screen fillers, relics of a bygone age when America went to the movies just to go to the movies. (Why not? It cost a dime back then.)",1251936000,2,1263,4.258333333333334
3913725,5,B002DY9KQG,I've always heard about Frankenstein 1970 and never had the chance to see it. The Walking Dead is one of my favorite Boris Karloff movies. The 'Zombies' and 'Out' might be fun some late night after a couple beers.,1250467200,2,213,4.487179487179487
3913726,4,B002DY9KQG,"10/10/09 FOLLOW UP
The dvd set is now available and it is definitely worth buying!!  You can read my commentaries of the four films below.  This is just a follow up to say that all four features are excellent transfers with high quality image and sound - and most happy is the news that FRANKENSTEIN 1970 is in the WideScreen format!! Karloff and Lugosi fans should have no complaints and, indeed, rejoice in having such a fine dvd set to add to their collection.

The following are commentaries on the films included in the set. These are four worthwhile K&L movies and are presented in a pristine and proper condition, they're a must for all K&L fans and movie buffs everywhere.

THE WALKING DEAD - This is a fine thriller from the thirties.  It's a fusion of crime drama and the supernatural.  Karloff is a musician set up by mobsters for a crime he didn't commit and is sent to the electric chair.  Scientist Edmund Gwenn resurrects him from the dead and Karloff seeks reprisal against those who wronged him - and finds a few moments to resume his music.  A well done film from director Michael Curtiz (CASABLANCA) with lots of atmosphere.  It plays like a story from the thirties publication, WEIRD TALES. Film historian Greg Mank adds an informative commentary track.

FRANKENSTEIN 1970 - Warner DVD got it right!  It is a CinemaScope picture and its in its proper widescreen format and not in a full screen distortion (like Warner's disappointing VHS release several years ago). Dr. Frankenstein (Karloff) accepts a lucrative payment for allowing a TV crew into his ancestral castle to do a documentary about his famous great great granddad.  With his loot, Dr. F sets up an atomic lab beneath the castle's crypt to carry on with experiments of life and death. The TV crew are an annoyance to Dr. F but prove to be a good source for harvesting organs.  This is an underrated and wrongly maligned film. It's certainly not the best Frankenstein film made but it's far from being the worse and actually has good points that make it enjoyable (photography, sets, some gruesome moments and some shocks). Karloff is in fine form as a latter day Frankenstein disfigured and apparently rendered impotent by Nazi experiments.  He does NOT give a 'hammy' or 'phoned in' performance as several knotheaded reviewers have said in the past.  This film was originally double billed with THE ATTACK OF THE 50 FOOT WOMAN (a vastly inferior film - in spite of its cult status).  F70 is NOT a 'Bomb' but rather it is a fun film and a guilty pleasure.

YOU'LL FIND OUT - Here is another film underrated by more knotheaded reviewers down through the years.  Often it is stated that the talents of the three stellar bogeymen in the film are wasted.  NOT TRUE! Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Bela Lugosi are all splendid in their parts.  Spooky comedies were popular in the forties and this film is one of the better ones.  When I was a kid, this movie showed up on a local TV station several times in a year and I watched it as often as possible.  I've seen it recently and it holds up well.  A young heiress to a fortune is targeted for murder by the three villains. The story takes place in an isolated mansion near the sea. The heiress has invited her friends to spend a weekend there to celebrate her 21st birthday.  She also invites a popular band (Kay Kayser and his College of Musical Knowledge) to play for the occasion.  A furious thunderstorm ensues and the bridge to the property blows up stranding everyone in the house where the weirdness increases.  The film contains everything one would want in a spooky mystery comedy - intrigue, danger, rooms filled with mysterious and odd artifacts, secret passageways, creepy seances, funny setups and good pacing.  Kay Kyser, Dennis O'Keefe and Ish Kabbible give good comedic performances.  And Karloff, Lorre and Lugosi are properly menacing and are excellent straightmen to the comedy.  The big band music is fine, too.  It's an all around fun romp.

ZOMBIES ON BROADWAY - This is another forties spooky comedy - and a good one.  A Broadway gangster (Sheldon Leonard) plans to open a zombie themed night club and hires two PR men to promote it.  When their PR hype promises a real zombie for opening night the mob boss sends them to the Carribbean to bring one back and make good their promise.  On a jungle island they meet Dr. Renault (Lugosi) who's creating zombies via a formula (pronounced 'formoo-lah' by Lugosi) injected into the blood.  Wally Brown and Alan Carney are the two PR men and, Abbott and Costello comparisons aside, they are funny and work well together.  Lugosi shines in his mad doctor role and exhibits a flair for comedy (the scene of him chasing a lab monkey is very amusing). Plus a young and beautiful Anne Jeffreys (Marion Kirby on TV's TOPPER) joins in the shenannigans.  It's a fast paced film with fine performances from everyone.  This film was made three years before Abbott and Costello ever thought of meeting Frankenstein and it holds up to this day as a terrific horror comedy.

So, Karloff and Lugosi fans rejoice! This IS a great dvd set to add to your collection (Warners came through with a WideScreen transfer of Frankenstein 1970).  So settle back and enjoy some old fashion fright fun with this quartet of K&L goodies.",1248307200,70,5304,4.685745140388769
3913727,4,B002DY9KQG,"I agree with the other reviewers about ""The Walking Dead,"" which is an excellent tale.

I have just about worn out my VHS copy, which was taped from a local TV station airing many years ago, so I'm very glad to see that it is finally being released on DVD.  Let's hope that the DVD version has been transferred from a good 35mm print, and that some care has been taken in the transfer.

I've never seen the other three films and so can't comment on them.  But I agree that the set will be worth the price just for ""The Walking Dead"" alone.

BTW, this film was partially remade in 1939 as ""The Man They Could Not Hang,"" also starring Karloff, with the same basic plot (wrongfully convicted man is executed and returns to avenge his death).  But ""The Walking Dead"" is spookier, less preachy and in my opinion, the better of the two.",1246320000,9,830,4.32258064516129
3913728,3,B002DY9KQG,"Although I am happy to see a new major studio release of some Boris Karloff titles I am a little surprised that Warner didn't just release a full Karloff box set. I was hoping that they would take ""The Walking Dead"" and add ""West of Shanghai"" (Warners 1937), ""The Invisible Menace"" (Warners 1938), ""British Intelligence"" (Warners 1940), ""Devil's Island"" (Warners 1940), ""You'll Find Out"" (RKO 1940) and maybe even ""The Lost Patrol"" to create a complete Karloff tribute set. I am guessing that they didn't want to mix horror and non-horror titles and dilute what is obviously a Halloween themed set.

The one true gem in this collection is 1936's ""The Walking Dead."" This Michael Curtiz directed film is a strange combination of Warner gangster picture and Universal horror film. These two genres mix together to create a strange but entertaining hybrid. Karloff, at the height of his fame, gives a wonderful performance. ""The Walking Dead"" is an example of a quality big studio horror picture created in an era when this kind of entertainment hadn't been relegated to B movies. This film alone is well worth the purchase price.

The other films in this set are another story. ""You'll Find Out"" and ""Zombies on Broadway"" dating from 1940 and 1945, respectively, are comedies in which Karloff and Lugosi lend their horror personas as mere props for the likes of big bandleader Kay Kyser and a second rate Abbott & Costello team to play off of. Sadly, both actors are hugely wasted in these films. The last film in the set is 1958s ""Frankenstein 1970."" This one is another B horror film entry that probably played many a drive-in during it's original release. Karloff, as always, still manages to give a dignified performance.

If you are a Karloff fan you will probably want to add this set to your collection if only for ""The Walking Dead.""",1245888000,24,1839,4.813291139240507
3913729,4,B002DY9KQG,"This two disc collection contains the long-awaited ""Walking Dead"" and three other rather minor horror films.

The following is the press release for this set:

The Walking Dead (1936)
The Walking Dead is a unique blend of cinematic horror and the classic Warner Bros. gangster stylings. This long-admired cult favorite stars Boris Karloff, who gives an outstanding performance as John Ellman, an ex-con framed for murder who's sentenced to the electric chair. When Ellman is brought back to life through the miracles of science, his only task is to seek revenge against those responsible for his death. Michael Curtiz directs.

Frankenstein-1970 (1958)
Nearly twenty years after his final appearance as the Frankenstein monster in Son of Frankenstein, Boris Karloff returned to the screen in a new film derived from the Mary Shelley story that first catapulted him to stardom. In this 1958 horror classic, Karloff appears in the role of Dr. Victor Frankenstein, a descendent of the original doctor, whose depleted fortune forces him to grant a film crew access to the family castle to shoot a horror film. It's not all bad, though, since he now has a supply of fresh body parts ready for harvesting.
Special Feature:
Commentary by historians Charlotte Austin and Tom Weaver

You'll Find Out (1940)
Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre poke fun at their horror-genre personas in this 1940 RKO mix of music, murder and mirth. The plot finds the trio of horror legends leaving a trail of terror and laughs along the way, as they plan a murder in order to nab a young heiress' inheritance in a spooky, spoofy haunted house tale. The film was one of several hits of the era featuring the music and merriment of the then popular Kay Kyser and his band. The film's original song, ""I'd Know You Anywhere"" was Oscar nominated.

Zombies on Broadway (1945)
The emphasis is equally spread between horror and humor in this RKO production that has endeared itself to generations of die-hard Lugosi fans. Here, Bela Lugosi stars as mad scientist Dr. Paul Renault who ends up with more than he bargained for when he encounters two inept Broadway press agents (Alan Carney and Wally Brown) looking for a real-life zombie to use for a publicity stunt in promoting a new nightclub.

End of press release.

The Walking Dead is a true horror classic. I was surprised to discover it was a Warner product because it is made in the Universal horror style of the Laemmle era of that studio. The other three films are full of great memories from my childhood and Sunday matinees of horror films that ran on local TV. Most of the fun of the other three films consist of the combination of camp and horror. Plus it is good to see Warner finally getting some of those old RKO properties cleaned up and put out for general release.",1245456000,29,2858,4.820408163265306

3913734,5,B002DY9KQG,"Great quartet of Karloff and/or Lugosi black-and-white films from the 30's, 40's, and 50's.
THE WALKING DEAD (1936)
Karloff plays a basically decent ex-con, just released from prison, who wants to rebuild his life but runs afoul of a gang of corrupt officials who are criminals at heart.  They frame him for murder, he is executed, and brought back to life by a well-meaning scientist, played by Edmund Gwenn.  Though now returned to life, Karloff lives in a daze and cannot remember his death existence, which the good doctor want to know about.  Karloff only sort of comes to emotional life when he sees the gangsters who framed him.  When he confronts them they die, though not by his hand.  The bad guys, headed by the handsome Ricardo Cortez, remain smug in their assurance that they will get away with their misdeeds, until they meet their end.
FRANKENSTEIN 1970 (1958)
Karloff plays the last remaining Frankenstein noble (not the monster) who has allowed an American movie company to film a horror film in and around his castle.  The baron is an embittered man, disfigured and rendered useless (impotent?) by the Nazis during the war.  What no one knows is that he is keeping the family tradition alive by building a monster in the secret cellars of his home.  Whenever someone stumbles upon his activities, or he needs spare parts, he picks off castle servants of a member of the movie crew.  When he takes the heart of his handyman, the whole act seems obscene.  Eventually the whole mess come to light and the bad doc's deeds hits the fan.
YOU'LL FIND OUT (1940)
Kay Kyser and his band (an acquired taste) come to an isolated mansion to help a young heiress.  Her aunt guardian is supposedly being flim-flammed by some supposedly fake spiritual medium.  Kyser and his musicians, who are not detectives (and not all that great musicians) start investigating and questioning the goings on.  There are some pretty good spooky moments.  Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and George Zucco are the best thing about the film, adding sinister atmosphere to make things more fun.  The mansion sets are great.  That place must be bigger than the Museum of Natural History.  Some of the musical numbers are not bad.  The film is a lot of fun.
ZOMBIES ON BROADWAY (1945)
A pair of bumbling advertisers have to produce a real zombie for their gangster boss who is opening a voodoo-themed nightclub.  First they go to the local museum to meet a off-kilter curator to get advice and information.  Hilarious scene.  Off they go to an isolated Caribbean island to get the real goods.  They meet a comely singer who want to get back to the states.  She helps them find a local voodoo ceremony and they all end up at Bela Lugosi's jungle mansion.  There he is hard at work to come up with a full-proof zombie serum.  Other than the fact that he's nuts, WHY?  Along for the ride are two actors from the film I WALKED WITH A ZOMBIE, Darby Jones as (what else) a zombie, and Sir Lancelot as a calypso singer.  Great fun all around and my favorite of all the four films.

All four films have a great DVD transfer.  Highly, highly recommended.",1459641600,,3135,4.659380692167577

3913736,5,B002DY9KQG,"This is a great collection for fans of these two terror icons.  I purchased this mostly for Karloff's ""The Walking Dead,"" but I found the other films to be enjoyable also, especially ""Frankenstein 1970.""  ""You'll Find Out"" is great as well, very entertaining and fun.  You can't beat Karloff, Lugosi, and Peter Lorre all in the same movie together.  ""Zombies on Broadway"" is ok, but my least favorite of the four.  There are some good moments in this film, but honestly, Bela Lugosi was the best thing about it. Still, at only 68 minutes, it is worth the time to watch at least once.

Picture and sound quality are very good; and subtitles are available on all four, if needed.  ""Frankenstein 1970"" is presented in widescreen.  These are not the best films of either actor, but this set is a lot of fun, and I think Karloff and Lugosi fans would enjoy it.  :)",1456617600,2,859,4.525974025974026

3913739,5,B002DY9KQG,"It was where most people of my generation got their ""monster movie fix""--on Saturday nights. We didn't have any movie houses in town that specialized in B-movies, so every Saturday night we'd tune in to ""Chiller Theater"", hosted by our ABC affiliate's weatherman (TV stations didn't have real meteorologists back in those days) dressed up scary for a distorted camera. ""Mr. Chiller"" would emerge from his casket, singing his version of the old nursery rhyme; ""A tisket a tasket, it's time to get out of my casket"". In a way, Mr. Chiller had as much of a regional following as any of the stars of the films. We didn't have a color TV at the time, so the fact that this movie is shot in black & white is no surprise. They got an aging Boris Karloff for the title role--well, who else but Karloff for the role of Frankenstein. The film has this pseudo-futuristic aspect about it, being that it was made in 1958, and one gee-whiz gag is when a car pulls up to the Frankenstein mansion--it's gas turbine powered and it sounds like a Lear Jet or Gulfstream on the taxiway. This may sound like a plug (it isn't), but Donald Fagen's first album ""The Nightfly"" opens with a song called ""I.G.Y."" that lampoons the woo-woo view people of that era had of 'Duh FEW-churrrr'. But the scene that I remember most is when Frankenstein's butler and successor to good ole Igor (Schutter, played by Norbert Schiller) is carrying Baron Frankenstein's victim (Carolyn Hayes) down to his basement lab. She's pleading for Schutter to release her, but we hear Frankenstein's voice from downstairs; ""Bring her down heah, Shoo-tah"". Well, it doesn't take much to scare 12-year-old kids.

3913742,5,B002DY9KQG,"The Warner Brothers' classic ""The Walking Dead"" is worth the price alone. Not ""Frankenstein"" by any means, but still a great addition to any Karloff fan's library. Horror as a genre became kind of outlawed after Universal's ""The Raven"" with Karloff and the late great Bela Lugosi. The writing was on the wall before that but ""The Raven"" was the last nail in the coffin of the early 30's horror cycle, which Warner Bros. had an occasional entry (Dr. X, Mystery Of The Wax Museum, Freaks) - all brilliant in their way. It was also the temporary end of gangster films with the original ""Scarface"" doing to that genre what ""The Raven"" did to horror. The way Warners got around the anti gangsteer film was to make the good guys the central characters, making them just as tough and using the same actors to portray them (see James Cagney in ""G-Men"" and Edward G. Robinson in ""Bullets Or Ballots""). Another way  was to spoof them (Robinson in ""Larceny, Inc."" and ""A Slight Case Of Murder""). Well, The Walking Dead is a horror gangster picture, if you can believe that. Boris Karloff is fantastic as the returned to life protagonist scaring his enemies to death.

Along for the ride in this set is Karloff and Lugosi the Great AND Peter Lorre in the minor ""You'll find Out"". It's a fun picture if only to see these three titans playing opposite one another. Kay Keiser's inane musical schtick did nothing for me, but just listening to the two kings of horror and Lorre speak is worth the watching. Zombies On Broadway is worthy if only because of Lugosi. Rounding out the package is the interesting and fun later Karloff vehicle ""Frankenstein 1970"". Like ""Zombies"" it is worth just for enjoying Karloff being another mad scientist whose name happens to be Frankenstein. Fun stuff all around!!",1422835200,,1785,4.699680511182109

3913753,4,B002DY9KQG,"""You'll Find Out"" is an RKO film from 1940 featuring not only Boris Karloff, Peter Lorre and Bela Lugosi together in one picture and if that weren't enough, Kay Kyser and his band with featured performers Ginny Simms, Harry Babbit and Ish Kabibble.  It's a corny sort of comic haunted house story, but it's all in fun and gives younger people of today the opportunity to hear the sort of music that was popular in the 1930s and 40s.  Kyser's orchestra was what would then be termed a ""sweet band"" -- no bop jazz here.

Also of interest was the use of the electronic device called ""Sonovox,"" a sophisticated affair for the time permitting a speaking or singing human voice to take on the characteristics of musical instruments or other sounds.  This same device was used in making children's records such as ""Sparky's Magic Piano"" and ""Rusty in Orchestraville"" produced by Capitol Records in the 1940s.  The Sonovox was also used for the famous radio ad for Bromo-Seltzer,  The train whistle would sing ""Fight Headache Three Ways"" and the engine chugging ""Bromo-Seltzer, Bromo-Seltzer, Bromo-Seltzer.....""

3913759,4,B002DY9KQG,"Although this collection might be better titled ""Lots of Karloff and A Little Lugosi,"" these four films are actually quite a bit fun.

The Karloff disk features The Walking Dead and Frankenstein 1970.  The Walking Dead is from 1936 and, although it isn't really up to Karloff's early films at Universal or his later films at RKO, it is a surprisingly muscular film directed at a fast clip by Michael Curtiz.  In this one, a gang sets Karloff up for an unjust execution the better to hide their own criminal activities.  Unfortunately, Karloff is revived and sets about stalking the gang.  The film has a lot of memorable character actors, including Ricardo Cortez and Edmund Gwenn, and the DVD offers an entertaining audio commentary as well.  Released in 1958, Frankenstein 1970 starts of extremely well--the first five minutes or so of the film are quite remarkable--but it quickly goes south, less a ""B"" movie than a ""C.""  It is very fortunate indeed that it has a audio commentary; its almost the only thing enjoyable about the film.

The Lugosi disk offers You'll Find Out and Zombies On Broadway, neither of which are really Lugosi vehicles per se.  You'll find out centers around the antics of real life, big band Kay Kyser and The Kollege of Musical Knowledge, featuring such favorites as Ish Kabbile and Ginny Sims.  In this 1940 throwaway, Kay and the band are hired to play a gig in an old dark house where not only Lugosi but Karloff and Lorre lurk in the shadows.  It's silly and a lot of fun.  The 1945 Zombies on Broadway is indeed as foolish as its name, starring low-rent comics Wally Brown and Alan Carney and Lugosi in a mad doctor supporting role; its really Darby Joes and Sir Lancelot (essentially repeating roles they created for the earlier movie I Walked With A Zombie) that make the thing fun.  But it is an entertaining little movie that ends before it wears out it welcome.  Unfortunately, there are no audio tracks on either of these films.

The prints aren't flawless, but they are very good, and the sound elements are good as well.  I have to say that I can't really see myself watching Frankenstein 1970 more than once, but I'll probably revisit The Walking Dead, and I know I'll enjoy seeing You'll Find Out and Zombies on Broadway several times more.  Recommend for Karloff and Lugosi fans everywhere.

It was great fun to see these two in a humourous as well as frightening mode.  Walking Dead was a great film noir drama which proves once again how great an actor Boris Karloff really was.  Bela shined in Zombies on Broadway.  It was not always strictly ""PC"" but that doesn't stop you from laughing out loud. The fish eyed  zombies were really quite creepy. It was the first time I had seen that film and it turned out to be very entertaining all round. ""You'll Find Out""was a breezy comedy and with Boris, Bela and Peter Lorre in the cast you couldn't go wrong. Frankenstein 1970 completes this set.

every movie they made. The quality is better than the vhs copies

reason I bought this to have in widescreen. It was worth it.
The Walking Dead is one of my favorite Karloff roles. He's not
really a monster but he's as scary as ever. I like that it's
horror gangster mix same as universal's the girl and the monster.
You'll find out is worth having for Karloff, Lugois and Lorre
as they make the movie. I could do without the music numbers.
I guess back then it made sense. Zombies on broadway sounds
ridiculous but it's good! another horror/gangster mix with

give his best in any movie no matter how cheaply made. It is

3913768,3,B002DY9KQG,"No, not the Kirkman comic or the awesome television series based on the comic, but the 1936 film starring Boris Karloff. This tale concerns patsy John Elman (Karloff) who was set up by the mob, then wrongly convicted of murder, then fried in the electric chair. End of story? No way, because Dr. Beaumont (Edmund Gwenn of Santa Claus fame from Miracle of 34th Street) has been working on bring the dead back to life and who's the lucky corpse? You guessed it, Karloff! Look out baddies; he's back from the grave and looking for a little pay back! Note that the referred to ""payback"" in this movie is a complete letdown if your expecting some zombiesq or ever Frankenstein's Monsteresq revenge. However, the film was directed by the great Michael Curtiz, who went on the helm such classics as The Adventures of Robin Hood (1938), Casablanca (1942), and Yankee Doodle Dandy (1942) So with such a great director and cast The Walking Dead turns out to be a great slice of film noir with a bit of sci-fi horror mixed in.",1305331200,,1015,4.582417582417582
3913769,4,B002DY9KQG,"Horror classics is a bit of an exaggeration  when applied to these four flicks; however, they are rare and, with one exception, rarely made the rounds of 'Chiller Theater' or 'Creature Feature' back in the heyday of almost nightly horrorfests. Glued to the tube whenever they were on, I had to get this collection to add to my own. I'm a critical SOB, so take these words with a grain of wolfs bane as I attempt to deliver the down-lo on this set:

1) 'The Walking Dead' (1936) - A former convict, played by Boris Karloff, is set up by mobsters to take the fall for a murder he didn't commit. He is unjustly executed for the crime, but is resurrected by a scientist (Edmond Gwenn - 'The Trouble With Harry') in an experiment to unlock the secrets of the afterlife. But something just isn't right about the man brought back from the grave, and those who framed him meet swift and deserved deaths, coincidentally, when Boris is nearby. It's a poor man's 'Frankenstein' tale with a rushed ending, and although competently done, it's meager in its meal, leaving me hungry for more. But Karloff is always a marvel to behold as he dominates the scenery when on-screen. The picture is fair, with little contrast and more grays than blacks against the white. A rarity indeed as it wasn't screened much and hasn't been available on DVD.

2) 'Frankenstein 1970' (1958) - This flick made the rounds of TV frightfests religiously back in the 60's and, although a B-movie with a disappointing monster (tho no more disappointing than a lot of Hammer films from the late 60's/early 70's), if you're a Karloff freak like me, you're in for a special treat no matter how many times you saw this as a kid. First off, it's the most gorgeous print of this film you could ask for, absolutely pristine. Secondly, it hasn't been edited to add commercials as in the past, so you're likely to see scenes you haven't (is this a good thing? You decide). Thirdly, it's presented in widescreen, a first for us all, unless your daddy owned a movie theater back in the late 50's. And finally, Boris absolutely chews up every scene he's in and delivers some of the most chilling dialogue he was ever given back in his 1940's/50's film appearances. He's on fire for a man approaching 70 years of age and he makes this one the caviar in the collection. He'll make you forget that the monster is an oversized mummy with an even more overinflated head in a stillborn heartbeat. My favorite here.

3) 'You'll Find Out' (1940) -  Kay Kaiser was a big band leader (along the lines of a second-rate Glenn Miller) who was hugely popular back in the radio years, and had a program entitled 'Kay Kaiser's College of Musical Knowledge' that led him to star in a series of movies, of which this is one. In a typical-for-the-time spoofy spooky murder in a 'haunted house' comedy, RKO pictures dragged out three actors under contract when horror films were sagging at the box office - Boris, Bela and Peter Lorre. It's a lightweight farce that's not too painful to enjoy parts of, and Karloff and Lorre are superb during their brief but impressive screen time, especially the genuinely creepy Lorre, demanding attention and distracting from some of the film's sillier moments. If they had larger participation, this one would be cherished. Unfortunately, Bela was already a liability in most films (and I'm sure I'll get a ton of crap for this remark), and here he's one step away from an embarrassment altogether, as his reluctance to better his English language skills make him almost incomprehensible when he speaks. Sad but true. Another rarity that  seldom hit the airwaves, it's noteworthy for Boris and Peter, and the sets in the spooky house are a delight.

4) 'Zombies On Broadway' (1945) - A new nightclub is about to open in New York City, and the mobster behind the club's funding (Sheldon Leonard, always a typecast gangster and later a TV producer of 'I Spy' among other hit shows) sends two agents/lunkheads (think third-rate Abbott and Costello, and I'm being kind) down to San Sebastian in search of a real-life zombie as an opening week attraction (I thought zombies were real-dead?). Once there, the imbeciles encounter Bela Lugosi, playing his usual mad scientist role unintelligibly, and every lame clich from Bob Hope/Bowery Boys/the Ritz Bros./Abbott & Costello is used to absolutely no effect whatsoever. This one tanked in spite of a great title and OK premise, it was just devoid of talent and the necessary one-liners needed to pull it off properly. Poor Bela, I love his presence but he was already reduced to a Hungarian Horror Whore by this time. It's a damned shame...

So there you have it, two decent Karloff flicks worth  re-screening as an adult, one anomaly worthy of at least one viewing to catch Lorre scene-stealing, and a forgettable Bela flick I personally could've skipped without losing sleep - actually, it did put me to sleep, now that I think about it. But don't think about it, at the current price, it comes recommended in spite of my sarcasms...",1287792000,2,5046,4.71850170261067

3913773,5,B002DY9KQG,"I bought this set mainly because I love 'The Walking Dead' and all the classic monster movies. The set includes three other films from days gone by and I must say they are all at least fun! The 2 discs set includes a trailers for two films and commentary on two. It would have been nice if they would have included trailers and commentary on all the films, but it is a small grievance. The films look great and are presented in their original format, so I'm very happy to have them! If your a fan of the old horror classics than this is a no brainer. Oh and by the way......where is Island Of Lost Souls!? I know it's a Universal film, but really, it's a great film and deserves a proper DVD release!

1)The Walking Dead - 4 1/4 stars - This is the real gem of the set! Karloff plays a man who come back from the dead to deal with gangsters. One of the long lost horror classics. This one is worth the price alone.

2)Frankenstein 1970 - 3 1/2 stars - This is a fan favorite with Karloff playing Dr. Frankenstein this time around. This is pure hokey fun!

3)You'll Find Out - 3 3/4 stars - Surprisingly good and a lot of fun. How can you miss with horror greats Bela Lugosi, Boris Karloff and Peter Lorre? Combine that with Kay Kyser and his zany band Ginny Simms, Harry Babbitt, Sully Morgan and Ish Kabibble who give comic relief. I never saw this before and I thought it was very entertaining.

4)Zombies On Broadway - 2 1/2 stars - The least of the bunch, but I did truly enjoy this kooky zombie(old school walking dead with bulging eyes!:-D)/mystery yarn. Lugosi plays a crazed scientist once again. Not too bad and it runs a little over an hour.

All and all considering the wonderful DVD transfers and the fact that we get a couple of the trailers and commentaries, this is a fun set that should not be over looked by fans of classic and vintage horror.",1259798400,6,1860,4.2727272727272725
3913774,3,B002DY9KQG,"""Karloff & Lugosi Horror Classics"" is a rather strange DVD collection. Boris and Bela only appear together (with Peter Lorre added for good measure) in the 1940 comedy ""You'll Find Out"" - a missed opportunity that showcases Kay Kyser and his Kollege of Musical Knowledge. The genuine classic in this two-disc set is Karloff's ""The Walking Dead"" (1936), an effective Warner Bros. gangster thriller directed by the great Michael Curtiz. ""Frankenstein 1970"" (a 1958 disaster from Allied Artists) receives the widescreen treatment, yet remains a dreadful Karloff vehicle. Decidedly better is ""Zombies on Broadway"" (1945) - a curious spoof of ""I Walked With a Zombie"" featuring Bela in memorable form as a mad scientist. Lugosi fans will be disappointed with these mediocre RKO efforts, but Karloff devotees finally get ""The Walking Dead"" (which includes an excellent commentary track by film historian Gregory Mank).",1258934400,6,912,5.384615384615385

3913776,5,B002DY9KQG,"I urge you to buy this collection for the movie ""You'll find Out"".

One dark and stormy night... there was this gorgous 40's horror-comedy.

WHO: A beautiful young heiress. A few classic ""who-done-it"" guests. Plus, swinging ""Kay Kyser and his collage of musical knowledge.""

WHERE: A huge spooky mansion cramed full of attractive young girl friends, stuffed tigers, african tribal masks, and looming tikis.

WHEN: A dark stormy night, and (of course) the only bridge leading to town, is blown up, or ""...struck by lighting"" as Boris explains. They are trapped.

THEN: introduce the Unholy Three: the greatest villains of the 40's era silver screen - Boris Karloff, Bela Lugosi and Peter Lorre.

Lightning! Thunder! flickering Lights! Musical numbers! Spooky high camp fun.

Boris Karloff lurks from the shadows in his distinguished suave menacing best.

Lorre: ultra cool-creepy sleepy-eyed chain-smoking dangerously purrs and doubts the supernatural powers of Lugosi. So, what happens then?

WHAT? A Seance!

Bela: ""Very well. For you I will do it. But, I must warn you... for those who scoff at their exsistance, the spirits consider no punishment too drastic!""

The seance is the show stopper scene of the film. Lugosi commands elaborate props, floating objects, the ""fires of death"", evil spirits! Wonderful!

A beautiful transfer. Some great sets, costumes, and 40's effects. I dare you to watch the seance scene and not smile: Lugosi goes into a trance while Kyser conducts his band with a glowing baton. Before ""rock and roll"" there was ""big band"" music. Kay Kyser was big on stage antics. He was the Kiss of the 40's.  Karloff glares. Lorre smokes and plays detective. The art direction and ""Kitch"" factor are well off the scale on this one. Primo stuff for retro-film buffs.

The other big find in this collection is a rousing commentary for ""Frankenstein 1970"" by Bob Burns, Charlotte Austin, and Tom Weaver. What a delightful special feature! Lot's of behind the scenes stories, Hollywood memories, and even a discussion of the heart pounding ""1952 Armed Forces Radio"" Halloween ""gag-that-almost-went-too-far"" that was the core idea for this film. Very interesting stuff!

Well worth the money for these vintage treasures!

Buy it. Watch it. Love it.",1256860800,4,2261,5.153424657534247
3913777,4,B002DY9KQG,"As others have pointed out, what you're really buying this set for is ""The Walking Dead,"" a very nice little film (66 minutes)from 1936 starring Boris Karloff at the height of his horror-icon fame. The best of the many Karloff-back-from-the-dead revenge films,""The Walking Dead"" is actually more of a supernatural mobster movie then a horror vehicle. But it's nicely photographed and is directed by Warner's any-genre ace Michael Curtiz, who later helmed ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" and ""Casablanca."" Karloff gives a heartfelt performance and there are several familiar faces from the Warner stable in supporting roles. It's this film in this 2-disc set, that rates the 4 stars. ""Frankenstein 1970"" is a low-budget chiller from 1958(don't try to make sense of it)that is actually much better then I had remembered, thanks to a genuinely creepy opening scene and the presence of Karloff in the role of a Frankenstein descendent. The print, like all the prints in this set, is crisp and clean and as a bonus we get it in a striking widescreen version. ""You'll Find Out"" is essentially a Kay Kaiser comedy that gets a cred lift from the three horror heavies. You don't have to be smarter then Ish Kabibble to figure out who the bad guys turn out to be in this ""Cat and the Canary""-ish mystery, but Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre each play it straight and that along with a pretty good seance scene makes it worth your time. ""Zombies On Boadway"" is like a poor man's version of an Abbott & Costello-meet-a-monster movie. If you like this kind of stuff then you won't be sorry you bought it. Happy Halloween",1256428800,4,1600,4.800724637681159
3913778,5,B002DY9KQG,"I agree with those who feel that this two disc collection of four films featuring the two horror greats Karloff and Lugosi should NOT be subtitled ""Horror Classics.""  None of the films are true ""classics"" and only two qualify as strictly ""horror"" and even that is debatable.

Having said that, these movies are fun!  ""The Walking Dead"" directed by the versatile and famous Michael Curtiz is the best of the bunch and is a moody, thoughtful, quiet probing of the mysteries of Life and Death and Vengeance wherein the vengeance is quite Biblical in that the film actually fulfills the ""Vengeance is mine sayeth the Lord"" maxim.  A greatly acted, paced, filmed, scored film.  A quasi-classic.

The much-maligned ""Frankenstein 1970"" is due for another look-see - and we have it here, in pristine widescreen.  Karloff doesn't walk through this one, as many people claim.  I think his performance is extremely forceful and by turns frightening and tragic. (His soliloquy in the Frankenstein tomb is magnificent to watch being acted and paced and gesticulated perfectly by the horror Maestro.) The film, sadly, has a lousy, ridiculous monster....but the pluses outweigh the minues:  the music score is terrific, the sets are filled with atmosphere and the beginning of this movie is arguably the scariest beginning to ANY horror film ever made.  I won't spoil it for those who have not seen it:  but suffice it to say, it is scaringly scored, atmospherically set and paced and the camera angles set the heart pounding.  It is too bad that the film's frightening opening did not continue throughout the rest of the movie.

The other two films are comedies, more or less.  Not side-splittingly funny, but the plotlines are interesting and the settings, again, are perfectly Halloweenish (especially in ""You'll Find Out"") and there are creepy moments in both films.  The seance in ""You'll Find Out"" is quite weird, indeed.  Karloff, Lugosi and Lorre play their parts to perfection and play them straight against the comedy of Kay Kyser and others.  The zombies in ""Zombies on Broadway"" are also weird and could give youngsters nightmares!

Anyway - Halloween is at hand.  Buy this set and you won't be disappointed.  And these are movies that the whole family can enjoy.  Trick or treat?  Well, this dual DVD is much more treat than trick!",1255478400,6,2329,4.948453608247423
3913779,3,B002DY9KQG,"As a Karloff/Lugosi fan I was curious about getting this set, knowing that 3 of the movies Frankenstein 1970, Youll Find Out & Zombies on Broadway were all given less than stellar reviews..while The Walking Dead is supposed to be a great flick.
THE WALKING DEAD basically is about Boris Karloff coming back to life after being killed by electric shock in prison. He was accused of a murder which he didn't commit. He comes back to life and gets his revenge on those who have framed him. He is brought back to life from a doctor ( Edmund Gwenn who was Santa Claus in Miracle on 34th Street) This is a very good 1930s horror, where things were booming in the genre. Karloff is great as usual. This was a blend of gangsters with a touch of horror. If youve seen the Indestructible Man with Lon Chaney - it resembles that film in part , but The Walking Dead is much better. Karloff also did similar titles for Columbia like the Man with Nine Lives,etc..The transfer is pretty good - very good - it has signs of specs and age here and there but for a movie 60 years old it has held up pretty well..
FRANKENSTEIN 1970 - First off the transfer is GREAT and widescreen. In this Karloff is Dr. Frankenstein creating a monster using atomic energy. The cast is a really nothing special past Karloff and the film to me drags a little bit until the monster makes his grand appearance. The ending is pretty comical. This movie has been given some of the worst reviews ranging from Terrible to Awful to * star and well...I personally think the biggest die-hard 1950s schlock fans will enjoy it. I think there is a lot better cheese out there than this one ( Amazing Colossal Man, It Conquered the World)..it would have been a good Midnite Movie..
ZOMBIES ON BROADWAY - this was a ho-hum unfunny movie with Bela Lugosi as Dr Reanult working on making Zombies with an injection. Its about 2 Broadway agents (Alan Carney and Wally Brown forced to go an island to find zombies for a new nightclub called the Zombie Hut or something like that. The comedy duo gets into all kinds of mischief. They tried to be like Abbott & Costello but failed miserably. Tongue in Cheek with minimal horror elements. The zombies were creepy looking, but it didn't work for me in a comedy movie. The main zombie is the same guy from I walked with a Zombie  which is far superior to this..
YOULL FIND OUT has Lugosi , Karloff and the great Peter Lorre spoofing the horror genre with musicals (no less than 5 numbers). UGH..Kay Kyser is the real star. No horror to be found here either. It's a real shame that this is called a horror set. The word horror is really stretched here (think Fox Horror Classics Volumes 1 & 2 )
Well overall I did find the transfers to be really good, the packaging was pretty good..2 discs with 2 movies apiece of them. This has some bonus features such as commentaries which these movies might be better to watch with.
Is it worth getting just to have the Walking Dead ? This is a question I am still pondering because the other movies, unless you are really, REALLY into camp and horror spoofs , these movies just won't capture your attention or hold your interest. I could envision watching these on a cold winter day when you aren't really feeling that good and just want to lie around and watch something that you can doze off on. Karloff/Lugosi completists will want to get this no matter what I would say :-)
Just like the Fox horror classics in Volume 2 I think the word 'Horror' is getting a stretch again here..
Basically if audio commentaries along with good to very good movie transfers outweigh 3 lousy movies on a 4 disc set this ones for you",1255305600,4,3645,4.424107142857143
8366248,3,B002DY9KQG,"Like the girl with the little curl, when the movies in the Karloff & Lugosi Horror Classics are good, they are very, very good, and when they're bad, they're horrid. Few video buffs know Boris Karloff was in Howard Hawks' original, 1932 ""Scarface"" in a supporting role, but he proves himself perfect for the Warner Bros. gangster-themed ""The Walking Dead."" It's a terrific blend of crime thriller and terror chiller directed by the celebrated Michael Curtiz (""Angels With Dirty Faces,"" ""Casablanca""). ""Frankenstein 1970"" (made in 1958) is so awful, it very nearly gave me a migraine. Poor Boris, stuck in a stinker from bottom of the barrel Allied Artists (successor to Monogram Pictures). Bela Lugosi doesn't fare any better in ""Zombies on Broadway,"" from 1945 with the criminally unfunny Abbott & Costello wannabes Wally Brown and Alan Carney. Fortunately, Bela would play opposite the real Bud and Lou three years later drawing on the comic timing he first evidenced in Universal Pictures' 1942 ""Night Monster.""  Just behind ""The Walking Dead"" in terms of quality is ""You'll Find Out,"" which puts swing music bandleader Kay Kyser and his College of Musical Knowledge gang (including Ish Kabibble) at the mercy of an unholy three, consisting of Karloff, Lugosi and the new-to-America Peter Lorre (""M""). Kyser's antics and style of music may not be for everyone, but this solidly directed romp from David Butler is fast-paced and fun.",1518048000,,1435,5.1063829787234045

Zany & funny. I bet these stars had a barrel of fun making it! You can't beat Karloff, Bela Lugosi, Peter Lorre, & Kay Kyser's crazy band.",1509408000,,312,3.890625

8366254,1,B002DY9KQG,"I was very disappointed since the first movie I watched in the collection ""Frankenstein 1970"" played about a two-thirds of the way through, then the screen froze and it jumped right to the end credits. I tried replaying it, but even though the disk looks clean and unblemished the results were the same every time . After that I haven't even bothered to look at the other three included movies for fear of the same waste of time.",1499040000,,429,4.512820512820513
