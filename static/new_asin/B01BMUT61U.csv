7664334,1,B01BMUT61U,"It was just dumb and cheesy. Didn't bring anything new to the ""Christmas movie"" genre, plot was predictable, characters were uninteresting, acting was bad, romance was unrealistic. Just not a good movie.",1513814400,,203,5.375
7664335,3,B01BMUT61U,"Okay, this is not a great film. Actually, it's a made-for-TV (cable TV?) movie, shot in Canada, although the story is set in California.

Yes, it's predictable. A Christmasy, fish-out-of-water story with stereotyped characters. A workaholic mom who hates Christmas (yet another spin on Scrooge) finds herself in a picture-perfect small town that LOVES Christmas. Everyone pokes gentle, but affectionate, barbs at her for not loving Christmas (for her own good, of course). In the end she relents (due to the flimsiest of plot twists) and loves Christmas too.

And to top it all off with a predictably ""perfect"" ending, the real-life Santa makes an appearance. No, that is NOT a spoiler -- anyone can see from the moment that mom enters the town that Santa hangs out here. She even sees Santa early on, but doesn't believe it's him. Her 9-year-old son knows better, of course.

The script is no great literary work. It's very paint-by-numbers, broadcasting every plot development well in advance, and offering zero surprises.

The script is also very on-the-nose, spelling everything out; the characters broadcast their ""character types"" -- again and again and again - throughout the film. I lost count of how many times the mom said ""I'm practical."" and ""I'm a realist."" and that she doesn't like Christmas.

Likewise, the other characters are always saying how much they love Christmas, and espouse Christmasy philosophy like ""You gotta believe."" and ""You gotta have faith."" and saying that mom should not be so cynical. To which she always repeats that she's practical and a realist.

The script not only has zero surprises -- it has zero subtlety.

Even so, I kinda liked this film. It's bland, but pleasant. Yes, you know where the story is going, but you can say the same about slasher films -- and I love slasher films.

Now, if you want a funny, smart, quirky, authentically poignant romantic comedy/Christmas film, I recommend&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dinner-At-Freds/dp/B074TNTW9L/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dinner At Freds</a>. In it, Parker Posey has real chemistry with her love interest, Gil Bellows.

The same cannot be said for the ""romantic couple"" (mom and her Christmas-loving love interest) in CHRISTMAS TOWN. Zero chemistry.

Yet despite all those zero's, I enjoyed CHRISTMAS TOWN. I found the characters likeable and attractive, and enjoyed the ride even if I could guess every plot point ahead of time.",1513728000,,2474,5.32051282051282
7664336,2,B01BMUT61U,"Bad acting, starting watching it when relaxing a little, as it was free with Prime. Continued watching just to see how bad it really was.
Why do people even take the time and money to make such movies??",1513641600,,202,4.342105263157895
7664337,3,B01BMUT61U,"The acting is decent for a Christmas movie (usually the acting is horrible). The story is okay, but there is no real ending to it. Overall, it's just alright.",1513296000,,158,4.482758620689655
7664338,2,B01BMUT61U,"Not a good movie. Can someone please give a piece of coal to the child that is disobedient, disrespectful and spiteful?",1513296000,,119,4.714285714285714
7664339,1,B01BMUT61U,"I'm a sucker for almost any sappy Christmas movie, but I just can't believe someone actually got paid to write this drivel.",1513036800,,123,4.636363636363637
7664340,1,B01BMUT61U,Awful movie! Don't waste your time,1512864000,2,34,4.833333333333333
7664341,5,B01BMUT61U,"good, heartwarming movie.  family friendly.",1512691200,,43,7.6
7664342,2,B01BMUT61U,The leads who are supposed to fall for each other have NO chemistry at all. The lead actor looks craggy and sloppy like he was dragged backwards through a knothole. Cranky lead actress who never gets more charming. This is supposed to be such a Christmassy town and it looks like it is mid-July. I understand that Christmas happens in California but this had no Christmas feeling at all. The boy was an insufferable brat who was far too old to be still believing in Santa. Just an overall unfun Christmas movie. What is what all these good reviews???,1512604800,,550,4.565656565656566
7664343,2,B01BMUT61U,The story is cute but the wooden acting is unendurable. Whoever cast this movie should have rethought his or her actor choices.,1512604800,,127,4.818181818181818
7664344,4,B01BMUT61U,I thought it was fun. Cynical business woman meets the Christmas spirit and finds romance.,1512345600,,90,5.066666666666666
7664345,2,B01BMUT61U,literally worst movie ever. TOO much christ. watch if bored.,1512172800,,60,5.1

7664347,3,B01BMUT61U,Very cheesy.  Marginally acted.  The boy does not obey his mother once through the entire movie.  Just barely acceptable Christmas movie.,1511913600,,137,5.428571428571429
7664348,1,B01BMUT61U,the  worst christma movie I have seen!,1511654400,,38,4.428571428571429

7664352,4,B01BMUT61U,"Not a bad Christmas movie. Cliche, but entertaining. Unfortunately, the low production values detract from it, and the romance is... just not there. The hero is bland (and is he wearing a wig?), and there is absolutely not chemistry between him and the main character. But as a bit of fun Christmas fluff about a woman rediscovering the meaning of Christmas, I'd recommend it.",1504915200,3,376,4.890625
8750717,5,B01BMUT61U,This is a fun Christmas movie. Enjoyable to watch. The acting is very good. ( For the picky movie goer) There are a few things you can pick apart with the movie but if you enjoy Christmas movies I recommend tis one.,1520553600,,215,4.142857142857143
8750718,4,B01BMUT61U,"It is difficult to find a good Christmas movie that is not a single man or woman with children who move to some small town and meet the mate of their dreams, after some friction between them.  This is somewhat different and I enjoy watching it.",1519862400,,244,4.304347826086956
8750719,3,B01BMUT61U,"As Christmas movies go, this is decent with the typical ""cheesy"" bits and ""odd"" events taking place to make one believe in people from the North Pole.",1519430400,,150,4.592592592592593
8750720,5,B01BMUT61U,bought this for my mother (he loves hallmark movies and more specifically the xmas movies) and she loved it. its worth picking this movie up!,1517443200,,141,4.68

8750723,2,B01BMUT61U,"Yep. Its beyond "" bad holiday Rom com."" It is like horrible plot bad, predictable, and the male lead's hair WTH! Also, the kid isn't a very good actor either (sorry kid). They could've done a lot more with it and chose not to. The worst xmas movie I watched this season. Hallmark is doing it wayyy better and you know what that means.",1514592000,,334,4.234375
8750724,2,B01BMUT61U,"It's nice to watch a wholesome, family-centered movie, but it was just a bit two-dimensional for my taste. Two stars is generous.",1514160000,,129,4.909090909090909
8750725,1,B01BMUT61U,"Only kept watching because it was funny how bad it was, and I am not that picky about movies. The plot was insanely predictable, the script was cheesy, and the acting was cringy. After it finally ended, my dad literally said ""I wonder if that was the worst movie I've ever seen.""",1514073600,,279,4.384615384615385
8750726,4,B01BMUT61U,can you say CHEESY ROMANTIC XMAS MOVIE. hahah def a fun movie to watch with  someone you love,1513987200,,93,4.166666666666667
