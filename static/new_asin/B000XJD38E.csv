3003790,4,B000XJD38E,"Rebel is a treat for Matt Dillon fans.  This was made back in his cocky ""Outsiders"" era, so he's definitely got the swagger going on in this one.  His persistence to be with Kathy (the singer) is classic Dillon.  The story takes place in 1942 Australia, where wounded American soldiers went to recuperate--and go AWOL if they could escape the MPs.  Dillon's character meets a guy who can help him get on a ship and away from the war, and the story is basically Dillon's attempts to get on one of these ships.  The longer it takes for that ship to come in, the longer he has to fall in love with Kathy.  It's an engaging story, and there's enough tension to keep it going.  However, the 80s got all over this thing.  The music is way over the top for a 40s era film.  The stage performances seem oddly out of sync with the times.  However, Debbie Byrne does have a nice voice.",1212364800,9,875,4.280487804878049

8228545,2,B000XJD38E,I was disappointed this movie was not available with subtitles or closed captions for the deaf but otherwise the movie was fine.,1414108800,,128,4.863636363636363
8228546,4,B000XJD38E,"I found this movie eons ago in the very first movie store in our little town.  I watched it over and over again before returning it.  A few years later the store was closed and I was never able to find this movie again!  The storyline was interesting and the acting was very good.  But here's the clincher; over 25 years later, I can still sing the song that brings you to tears at the end of the movie!  I recommend this movie if you have a couple free hours and a box of tissues.",1404518400,,481,4.021052631578947

8228550,3,B000XJD38E,"Well, the only way in modern times to view this movie. Not available anywhere else it seems - no iTunes or
other download and the only other copies seem to be on VHS (good luck with that).

On the plus side - you get the movie and the great music.

On the minus side this DVD is clearly copied / reproduced from VHS and the quality is poor.

There is also NO way to extract the music as the encoding files do not exist separately.",1358985600,,430,4.035294117647059
