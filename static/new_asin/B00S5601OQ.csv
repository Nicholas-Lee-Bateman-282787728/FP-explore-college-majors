6959235,5,B00S5601OQ,I have bought all the seasons so far for my fianc. He LOVES Workaholics and enjoys rewatching every episode on our date nights. :),1437091200,,130,4.458333333333333
6959236,5,B00S5601OQ,Funny show,1435622400,,10,4.5
6959237,2,B00S5601OQ,"Sad, because I love the series. But this season was a huge disappointment. Not funny. I was so stoked to get this DVD set in my mailbox. I just finished the last episode and it was a complete let-down from start to finish.",1435536000,,222,4.186046511627907
6959238,5,B00S5601OQ,"Plain and simple,  best show ever!  Three of the funniest guys on TV!",1435276800,,69,4.230769230769231
6959239,5,B00S5601OQ,Brand new. Amazing show. Really good price.,1435017600,,43,5.285714285714286
6959240,5,B00S5601OQ,This show is just straight up funny. No more needs to be said.,1434931200,,62,3.8461538461538463
6959241,5,B00S5601OQ,"Yet another strong and weird season from my Workaholics bros Anders, Adam and Blake. There are some really strong episodes this season like ""Front Yard Wrestling"" with a cameo by Ben Stiller and ""Blood Drive"", and a cameo later in the season by Jack Black and even Booger himself Curtis Armstrong. This is a show like It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia or South Park, where in it's consistently good, humor and style and tone are consistent, and the episodes and writing are fresh and funny. I think one of my favorite episodes of season 5 is ""Trivia Pursuit"", mainly because of all the '80's references. But I am a product of the 1980's and was raised by T.V. so I guess that makes sense.

 Here we're getting all 13 episodes of season 5, bloopers, deleted scenes, behind the trailer and some more. Hopefully we get the Drunkementary (audio commentary with the cast just getting wrecked while recording, some of the funniest commentary tracks ever recorded), we got screwed out of that on Season 4. *UPDATE: NO DRUNKEMENTARY* Listen, if you're not watching this show, you should be. If you don't like this show, I don't like you. This is a fantastic show, this Blu-ray set is currently $12.99, that's some serious value, buddy. Can't wait for season 6.
