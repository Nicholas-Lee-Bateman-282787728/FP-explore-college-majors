8147333,5,B000IRV4H8,"Back in the ""1980's"" LYNDA CARTER became the spokeswoman for MAYBELLINE COSMETICS. She was encouraged to put together this video program as a result. This was one of my First VHS Programs. I would get out my cosmetics and mirror and follow right along with her. She show a variety of ""MAYBELLINE COSMETICS"" that she uses. Lynda offers up her beauty tips and tricks, with a young woman and an older woman, also applying make-up for women of their age range. Lynda's eye color make-up rule in the program was: There is no hard and fast rules about selecting eye colors. She encourages you to experiment with various color combinations, such as: pink and green or pink and brown. I wouldn't have ever come up with those combinations at that time on my own. I would have thought of something like pink and blue or green and yellow. Lynda teaches you some of her tips and tricks, using tools such as cotton balls, cosmetic brushes and powder puffs. She pulls her powder puffs apart and shakes some of the powder off of it before applying it. She pours her liquid make-up into her hand and applies it with her fingers. I used to place my finger on top of the bottle and turn it up. I was probably contaminating my whole bottle. Pouring some in my hand is definitely better. A bit messy, but more effective. Lynda continues applying make-up to her entire face, bringing you along with her until hers and your face is done. She then walks away and comes back in a few minutes to check it again. I think she does that because when make-up is first put on, it looks different a little while later. She then shows off some of her eye color combinations with various colorful stylish outfits. Wow! This is such a good make-up program. I wish it would become available on DVD. I know that LYNDA CARTER must have been asked over the years why isn't it available to purchase that way. VHS is OKAY, if you have a VCR. I no longer have one. I painstakingly gave away my copy to the ""Goodwill"", along with all of my other programs, movies and such on film.  Film wears out so quickly. Especially after running them over and over. MAYBELLINE probably owns the rights to the program. Maybe if her fans write to them to inquire about the program, maybe it would be released again. That would be GREAT!",1355270400,,2280,4.467625899280575
8147334,5,B000IRV4H8,"I recently purchased this Lynda Carter ""Secrets to the Perfect Make Up"" video and I love it!!  Lynda takes the viewer through her techniques for applying a flawless face.  She also has a young girl and an older woman demonstrate the tips on their faces.  I have always thought Lynda Carter was absolutely gorgeous and this video proves I was right.  She looks fabulous even without make up, but the cosmetic tips she provides make her look absolutely perfect.  She has always been a favorite of mine, as has Donna Mills.  I also love Donna's ""The Eyes Have It.""  Maybe it is my age, but there is a magic quality about these ladies whom I have admired since the 1980s.  Their tips are still relevant today.",1326931200,,705,4.5396825396825395
