3787680,5,B001T21R8M,I love cars especially the Maserati so this set was a must.  It's great and I especially enjoyed the Bentley factory and the description of how they spend hours just making the steering wheel by hand.  These cars are way out of my budget but they're fun to look at regardless.,1417219200,2,276,4.392156862745098

3787683,5,B001T21R8M,"Many of my English students are not serious about learning the content the school district requires of them. For this reason I like to add a dose of Ultimate Factories to my instruction. It shows ""real men"" who ""work with their hands"" doing incredible things. A series of high end cars are featured and how they are assembled. Watch as teenage boys gaze in wonder at the ins and outs of manufacturing.",1401235200,,401,4.583333333333333

3787687,5,B001T21R8M,"A couple of weeks ago I was viewing the National Geographic Channel and happen to see the ""Ultimate Factories"" of an automobile assembly, and decided I wanted a copy of the DVD for my own personal use and to share with my car club friends.

So, I went to Amazon.com and did some checking.  Then found that I could purchase a complete set of several super cars produced by National Geographic.

I purchased the entire set consisting of 5 DVD's which contain 13 automobiles for a total viewing time of 585 minutes.  What a fine job of being able to view all the factory assembly plants that build these fine cars.

Outstanding.  You will not be disappointed.  Get the complete set which is a far better deal than an individual DVD and enjoy the results.",1375833600,7,751,4.518518518518518
3787688,5,B001T21R8M,"When I bought this I really only was looking for the Ultimate Factory show for the Chevy Volt. I was in the market for a Chevy Volt and wanted to see this. Anyway I could not find the single show for the regular price of about 20 dollars. Then I saw this one that had all the super cars, or at least most of them. Lamborghini, Mercedes, Porsche, Maserati, Bugatti, camaro, Corvette, Viper, Challenger and even more than I can remember for only 5 dollars more. What a deal.  I highly recommend this.",1371859200,,498,4.354838709677419
3787689,5,B001T21R8M,"Absolutely worth the money.  I only wish National Geographic would release more episodes.  Whether you are a serious car-nut, gear-head, etc, this is a must have for your collection.",1363132800,,182,5.241379310344827
3787690,5,B001T21R8M,National geographic does a great job in depicting the ultimate factories that produce great cars. I think the 5 DVDs are worth the money. Enjoy them.,1359849600,,149,4.769230769230769
3787691,5,B001T21R8M,Was a gift for my Father-in-law who is a car lover. He enjoyed the video and found it very informative,1358726400,,102,4.15
3787692,5,B001T21R8M,I really enjoyed this dvd. This one have 5 dvds full of images from the greatest cars factories in the world. I would highly recommend this to any car fan.  Won't be dissaponted.,1357689600,,178,4.393939393939394
3787693,5,B001T21R8M,"Received on time.  If you like super cars or high end motor vehicles this
DVD collection is for you.  I watched many of them when they aired on
Nation Geographics Channel and could not wait for the DVD release.
Not only are the vehicles amazing... but the factories are astounding.",1357430400,,281,4.6
3787694,5,B001T21R8M,"This series first aired on the National Geographic cable channel a year or two ago, and though I had seen most of the shows, they were so fascinating I wanted to see them all and bought this 5DVD set.  As always with National Geographic, each is a quality show with some backstory of each car's history, and then an up close tour of the factory, how each car part is made, and each mechanic/technician's job as part of the process of creating fabulous, top of the line cars.  Each viewer will no doubt have a favorite car or episode, but my favorites were the Italian Lamborghini which is almost completely people-constructed despite this world of technology, and the Ferrari which has some very fancy robotics called Romeo & Juliet, a male-female team of valve seat tighteners.  Other episodes stood out as well, for example the American cars Camaro and Dodge are mainly robot-made, and these huge up & down machines look like something out of the Transformers, and are operated by expert computer tech/mechanics.  You develop a lot of respect for the people who work in the world's automobile industry, as each worker takes extreme pride in what they do, from a painter to a test driver.  This 5DVD set ""passes inspection"" with flying colors!",1337990400,11,1244,4.767441860465116
3787695,5,B001T21R8M,"As with other National Geographic projects that are thoroughly researched and produced in a top quality fashion, this DVD set is up to their standard. Very interesting and very well done. Worth the money!",1327881600,3,204,5.029411764705882
3787696,5,B001T21R8M,"If you love cars and have any interest in engineering, quality control and just plain curiosity then this set of factory videos is for you. For some reason, only the R8 is missing. Otherwise, it is complete.",1323648000,2,207,4.621621621621622

3787698,2,B001T21R8M,"I would recommend you watch samples before buying this - they are available on the most popular video-sharing site now.

I visited BMW factory this summer and was expecting coverage similar to what you get on a tour. Not even close!

Very little detail, camera jumps every few seconds, so you often cannot see what exactly is being performed and how. But you get a definition ""roadster is a car with two seats and long hood"". You get to listen to a nobody who just *ordered* Z4 and explains great handling as ""you press the pedal and the car just goes"".
(By the way they cover 1st generation soft-top Z4 that's been out of production for several years now.)

This is clearly not for auto enthusiasts. The target audience for this series seems to be 10-year olds who argue what is better: Ferrari or Lamborghini.

The presentation is very unpleasant - stressing every word, like in a cheap commercial.
I had to turn off the sound and turn on subtitles. But then it's NG, not BBC, so I should've expected this, I guess.

In Porsche episode the same facts are repeated several times; the same footage is replayed several times as well. The image quality is bad indoor and simply terrible in outdoor shots (washed out colors). At some point the aspect ratio is wrong (image is squeezed horizontally).

I'm very disappointed. But some people like it, apparently - so watch it before paying. I wish I did.",1322265600,15,1399,4.620967741935484
3787699,5,B001T21R8M,The other reviewers have correctly praised this series.  Of special note is the episode on the Chevy Volt.  This episode shows how a car goes through pre production before if goes into actual full production.  This series was enjoyable and informative,1321488000,2,251,5.073170731707317
3787700,5,B001T21R8M,"This video set is great!  It shows every step of the manufacturing process. Every disk is awesome. I particularly like the Chevy Camaro video.  It shows how Chevy has computerized most steps for efficiency, and to eliminate possibilities of human mistakes.  The opposite of the spectrum is Bentley, Rolls Royce and Lamborghini where there are automotive artisans which scrutinize every detail of each vehicle.

I must have for your collection.",1318291200,14,443,5.285714285714286

3787702,5,B001T21R8M,"I had the pleasure of getting Ultimate Factories burned for me,It's the only one that matters to me.

R footage from Sebring along with Mention Of Le Mans,despite it being Sebring. other than that,it's worth it for the VetteHead I will be soon buying this one to add.",1281312000,2,396,4.1558441558441555
