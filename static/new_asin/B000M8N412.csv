2726976,5,B000M8N412,"I have hoped and prayed that McHale's Navy make it to DVD. After all, practially everything else can be bought on this format. I praise Shout Factory for giving this wonderful show the treatment it deserves. I also heard on the DVD some of the original cast members have been interviewed. This is brilliant. Too many times we see on TV shows on DVD, but none of the surviving cast members are interviewed. To me, this is a waste. I would love to know what went on behind the scenes, and what the actors feel towards the series.

McHale's Navy is one of the best situation comedies from the 60s. I cannot wait to buy my copy. Thank you Shout Factory for putting such a wonderful TV onto DVD.",1173312000,11,690,4.348837209302325
2726977,5,B000M8N412,"Even though I have most of the listed titles on vhs (taped from a T.V. Land Marathon) I am really looking forward to having these shows on good quality DVDs. I have watched my o.k. quality tapes many times and always get a good laugh from them. I think like most long-running t.v. shows the best episodes tend to be in the beginning of the series. If these episodes coming out on DVD are of good quality, I will be buying any later releases also. Even the often-bashed last season has some funny moments and would be well worth having if only to complete the set.

I have pre-ordered from Amazon at a very good price which included free shipping.",1171497600,8,646,4.383333333333334
2726978,5,B000M8N412,"The boys are back!  Enjoy the antics of Lt. Cmd. Quentin McHale and his gang of misfits of the PT 73; Ensign Chuck Parker, Gruber, Christy, Tinker, Virgil, Happy, Willy & Fuji as they pull the wool over the eyes of ""Old Leadbottom"", Capt. Binghamton and his aid, Lt. Elroy Carpenter.  I was  ready to slam the releasing company Shout Factory for releasing colorized episodes.  My thanks to 'Michael A. Brown ""maniacmedia""' for doing the leg work on verifing that Season One WILL be released in glorious B&W!

For newcomers, the Tom Arnold ""McHale's Navy"" movie = the Will Smith ""Wild, Wild West"" movie so please don't judge this series by the lame movie version.  Do I need to say more?

This series pokes a satirical jab at the Japanese Navy, same as Hogans Heros did to the German Army.  Probably not very PC today, but most 40+ year-old TV & movies are like that anyway.

A very funny series with a lot of very familiar faces. Enjoy!",1170720000,13,936,4.523809523809524
2726979,5,B000M8N412,"For those of you who only think of the painfully bad Tom Arnold movie when you hear the name, ""McHale's Navy"" was much funnier on TV. Led by Lt. Commander Quentin McHale (Ernest Borgnine), the crew of the PT-73 were a little less than by the book. And remember, this was before political correctness.

They had their own POW/cook. They lied, cheated, stole, gambled, womanized... and these were the good guys. Joe Flynn was great as the straight-laced Captain Wallace Binghampton. While always foiled in his plans to catch McHale with his hand in the cookie jar, Binghampton suffered an incompetent aide (Bob Hastings) and the constant bumbling of Ensign Charles Parker (Tim Conway).

Now for the good news: Since there seems to be some question about it, I contacted Shout Factory directly. Because had this been the poorly colorized version, it would never get to my DVD shelf. So I asked, and they answered... ""The series will be in the original black and white format.  We will have a bonus episode that will be in color.""

There you have it. The original episodes in the original black and white. Let's hope we get the entire series and their two 1960's movies, ""McHale's Navy"" and ""McHale's Navy Joins the Air Force"".",1170720000,58,1223,4.781990521327014

Joe Flynn was brilliant in this show, and every line he spoke was hilarious. his comic timing was impeccable and right up there with Don Knotts as Deputy Barney Fife as one of the all-time great television characters. As far as I'm concerned, Flynn really carried the show. Can't wait to watch the cast reunion bonus feature with Borgnine, Conway, Ballantine and Bob Hastings. Precious. Look forward to purchasing the other seasons. Thanks Shout! Factory. Well done.",1170028800,7,552,4.882978723404255

I loved the show as a kid (when it aired 1962-1966) and never tired of the re-runs through the decades. Having not seen it for quite a long spell, I can't wait soon enough to slip the DVDs into the player. Tim Conway (as Ensign Parker) was a riot. Joe Flynn (as Capt. Binghampton) too.

Starring Joe Flynn, Ernest Borgnine and a very young Tim Conway, this farce of WWII PT boat crew will give you the laughs.  Much as Gilligan's Island did for castaways, McHale's Navy did for the Navy.

This came out between the Korean War and deep involvement in Vietnam.  Because of the relative ""peacetime"" feeling to it, it's lighthearted and farcical.  (Yes, that's a real word.)  It's fun and it's funny.  And it's even better if you know the ""inside"" stuff.  Best yet, Borgnine knows his stuff.

2727060,4,B000M8N412,"The first season of McHale's Navy (1962-66) follows the exploits of the crew of PT 73, stationed on Taratupa, a small island in the Pacific, during World War II.  Under the command of Commander Quinton McHale (Ernest Borgnine), the crew attempt to skirt military authority, and get by with doing as little as possible.

While the military comedy had been explored many times in film and on television, goldbricking and insubordination, in the middle of a war, had rarely been so bold.  In McHale's Navy, WW II often seems like an afterthought, something that only occasionally became a priority.  For McHale and the crew of PT 73, fighting the enemy might be a relatively rare occurrence, but when necessary they are prepared to do their duty.  Although making a positive contribution to the war effort, usually occurs as a byproduct of one of their wacky schemes.

While McHale's Navy may have a questionable point of view, it does have a great cast.  Ernest Borgnine an Oscar winner for Marty (1955), made the interesting career choice to come to television.  Quinton McHale may not be the most admirable fellow, but he is certainly a likeable rogue, and Borgnine plays him with great warmth and emotion.  Ensign Parker is written as goofy and over the top, taking full advantage of Tim Conway's unique style of bumbling physical humor.  McHale's loyal crew of ""pirates"", include seamen Gruber (Carl Ballantine), ""Tinker"" Bell (Billy Sands), George ""Christy"" Christopher (Gary Vinson), Virgil Edwards (Edson Stroll), and ""Happy Haines"" Haines (Gavin MacLeod).

Joe Flynn brought great energy and emotion, to his portrayal of Captain Binghamton, as his wonderfully crazy mannerisms, bring the character to life.  As the representative of military authority, Binghamton is essential to making the show work.  ""Old Leadbottom"", backed by his bootlicking aide Lt. Carpenter (Bob Hastings), is usually the only thing preventing total chaos from breaking out.

President John F. Kennedy having commanded a PT boat, leant the craft a certain mystique, and the ship certainly looks good in the various action scenes featured in the show.  Never meant to be taken seriously, McHale's Navy was about outrageously breaking the rules, and defying authority.  Light, trivial, and almost totally detached from WW II, the show does feature some fine comedic performances.  As outrageous as these adventures are, with naval personnel frequently dressed in aloha attire, and serviced by Fuji (Yoshio Yoda) their POW houseboy, they actually pale in comparison to what would come in the proceeding seasons, as the series would become an even more outrageous farce.

Shout Factory has done a fine job with the DVD release, which features 36 episodes on 5 discs.  The image quality looks a little flat, but is still quite good.  A reunion of some of the crew is the primary bonus material.",1355788800,,2870,5.118025751072961

2727064,1,B000M8N412,"Holy smokers! As a kid we watched these and now I know why--nothing else good must have been on. There are 36 episodes on here and, trust me, I couldn't handle watching more than about three or four before I gave up.

The humor is so cornball. The acting is decent but it does not date well at all. The whole thing is shot on some hokey backlot. Plus despite the color cover, the entire thing is in black and white (which it was originally in Season 1).

To think something could be even lamer than modern day ""Everybody Loves Raymond,"" but this is right up there.

I think it must have been the era as the scriptwriting is so bad. The jokes are all telegraphed and seem like things even guys who were in the US Navy in WWII would have thought beyond stupid. The whole thing smacked of that Uncle Milty type humor that in 2011 seems so dated now.

I will say I enjoyed the ""crew reunion"" extras and the actors did have a great rapport with each other. It's just shocking to realize how bad TV was back in the early '60s. This stuff can't hold a candle to genius of modern-day sitcoms like ""Seinfeld"" or even anything on the big screen by Peter Sellers maybe back in those '60s.",1314921600,2,1177,4.241071428571429

The B/W images are sparklingly clear with few or none of those bothersome little flecks which usually permeate old programs such as this. A wide-screen TV like my brother's requires much more picture information and these DVDs obviously have plenty to spare.

Actually, the show is refreshingly funny and inoffensive, at least compared to the modern fare.  The crew of PT 73 is amazingly old, in contrast to what would have been their real life counterparts.  And, of course, there were the three-point cheers when a submarine got blasted to smithereens.  Although, perhaps the enemy were all taken alive and fed three healthy meals a day.  At least Fuji was not treated in a demeaning manner.  Each character adds to the humor.  I was happy with the purchase- five one sided DVDs that played without a hitch on my cheap RCA.

This series is truly one of television's funniest shows ever.  The interaction between the Captain and Ensign Parker (Joe Flynn and Tim Conway) was fabulous!

The DVD shows are packaged nicely and the pictures quite clear.  My only beef is on first inserting the first disc, I had to sit through several ads for other DVDs--I could not fast forward or skip them.  But to see this great series again, it's worth that inconvenience.  On the first disc was a nice feature with five of the regulars recalling the series.

2727096,4,B000M8N412,"The early episodes of Season 1 of ""McHale's Navy"" are more low-keyed than the remaining three years would be, showing some traces of the show's origin as a 1961 Alcoa Theater drama ""Seven Against the Sea"" that featured Ernest Borgnine as McHale, but none of the other cast members (though some of the same character names). Watching Season 1 in order you can see the show focusing more on the strengths of the slapstick comedic relationship between Tim Conway and Joe Flynn as the year goes on, but the opening season's shows overall are really no more silly/serious than the plots for the first two seasons of M*A*S*H (and in fact, M*A*S*H's Season 2 opener, ""Five O'Clock Charlie"" was liberally taken from a Season 1 ""McHale"" episode ""Five O'Clock Charlie"" and coincidentally features Mike Farrell in a brief role). Season 1 also features stories from some fairly prominent writers for TV and elsewhere, including the pilot episode by Gene L. Coon (""Star Trek"") and others by Danny Arnold (""Bewitched"", ""Barney Miller""), and Joseph Heller (""Catch 22"").

Picture quality is decent on most of the episodes, though there are a few scratches here and there that show the 45-year-old age of the source material. Sound quality is also good, except for the muffled opening scene and titles from ""Movies are Your Best Diversion"" (the original episode had a slightly jazzier version of the opening theme on the main titles, and someone apparently decided to dub the more familiar version back on and did so -- badly). Definitely worth getting, though if you're looking for the Conway-Flynn slapstick antics ""McHale's Navy"" is most remembered for, you might want to start with Disc 3 in the set, or pick up the Season 2 DVD of the show first.",1183161600,4,1734,4.877966101694915

The productions technically are fine.  No flaws in the reproduction as I detected; it is the quality of the show that has not held up well with time.

All of the funny guys are still funny:  Joe Flynn, Tim Conway, Ernie Borgnine, and the guys in the crew.  Somehow, the humor now seems thinner than it did orginally and the plots a little too contrived.  Perhaps our expectations of TV sophistication have grown.  Perhaps Andy Griffith was ahead of its time.  Perhaps the characters in other shows are more memorable.

The show has not changed since it was first produced.  It is my perspective that has changed with age.  Perhaps a younger audience would find it as funny now as I did when the originals hit the TV screen, but somehow this classic has faded a bit with time.

2727113,4,B000M8N412,"This long awaited series has finally come to DVD.It's a wonderfully funny show that hasn't lost any of it's charms but there are problems with this set,not the least of which is picture problems in an episode,but more on that later.
All original 36 eps on five DVDs are included in this set. The Shout Factory who produced the set has now branched from music into DVDs and they have done a pretty good job here. Also included in the set is a small descriptive booklet and a small little square of tattoos!
The series star was academy award winning Ernest Borgnine as Lt Commander Quentin McHale a previous steam ship captain who plied the south-west Pacific before joining Uncle Sam. Tim Conway getting his first big break(which would lead to the Carol Burnett show and beyond) stars as McHale's second,Lt. Parker. He's a bumbler and a stumbler but he has a heart of gold. Joe Flynn plays Capt. Binghamton,McHale's nemesis. His last wish would be to see McHale in court martial heaven. Binghamton's second is played by Bob Hastings as Lt. Carpenter who snivles and grovels his way along as he tries unsuccessfully to please his boss at every turn. Keep an eye out for a hefty Gavin Mcleod as crewman Happy,his first major role before he went on to serve on another ship The Love Boat!
It was a marvellous cast and the chemistry was obvious from the outset. In fact where many shows take a few eps or even longer to get warmed up this show seemed to hit the ground running.
This show was one of the four big military comedy shows of the 50s and 60s,the others being The Phil Silvers Show,Hogans Heroes and Gomer Pyle...all good in their own rights. I seem to recall Mchale's Navy being easy to watch as it came on after another one of my favourite shows of all time Combat. Also I think McHale eventually got time shifted and then ultimately canned. The Neilson ratings for bad or good were THE last word for the TV head honchoes back then. They would install little black boxes in pre-selected homes and the data would be retrieved and analyzed as to the viewing habits of its' occupants. It was an inaccurate system at best. Many a show was time shifted on a whim to seemingly improve its' ratings only to be either relegated to a spot on a Monday or Friday night(low viewing times) or opposite a show who virtually ""owned"" its time slot like The Ed Sullivan or Jackie Gleason Shows. Inevitably the show was cancelled. Other shows that deserved a quick death were sometimes spared. It still baffles me to this day.
As I stated in my opening this set does not come without its' drawbacks. There are no close captioning options nor are there any scene selection options. The most glaring problem though that you should be made aware of is a picture problem with the ep ""Camera,Action Panic!"" on Disc five. For the first 13 minutes the picture steadily goes in and out of focus. After this period it is less prevelant but still occurs. It seems to be a film problem but something they should have warned us about nonetheless.
In conclusion I would say be forewarned of the picture problem before considering buying this set. Thankfully it's the only one with such a problem. As far as extras go the ONLY thing is a tantalizingly short segment with some of the original crew,that's it.
Despite its' shortcomings this sets' main core is the series itself and except for the one problem the majority the shows have been transferred quite well. And the humour of the show is as fresh today as it was some 45(!) years ago. The entire cast of characters all shine in their own right but Capt. Binghamton's reactions to McHale's crews' shenanigans have to be seen to be appreciated.
In the immortal words of Quentin Mchale:
""McHale's Island:the only place where the tide comes in with a head on it"".
I'll drink to that!",1177804800,3,3810,4.5797950219619326
2727114,5,B000M8N412,"I loved this show as a kid, and I'm pleasantly surprised to still enjoy it as an adult. There were a lot of great comedians on this show, Tim Conway, Carl Ballantine, Joe Flynn (who is funnier than I remember) with Ernest Borgnine as the ringleader. It also has Gavin McLeod in a very early roll in his career.

Truth be known, the shows are all pretty simliar, the boys get in trouble and the Captain thinks he can finally get rid of them and in the end the crew of PT 73 cook up a way to get out of their trouble or simply luck out of their trouble. However, each episode is enjoyable This is good clean fun suitable for the kids (unlike much that is on the tube today) I look forward to purchasing the other seasons.

The interview with some of the remaining cast members is nice to have, but disappointing. It's really pretty dull, but I guess that is to be expected when the youngster in the group (Tim Conway) is in his 70s.",1177459200,5,930,4.189944134078212
2727115,5,B000M8N412,"This dvd set was absolutely wonderful.  I haven't seen these episodes in years...at least  since TV Land last replayed them.  I fell in love with this series all over again.  Each episode was hilarious.  Joe Flynn as the sore-head and ill-tempered Captain Binghamton was an absolute riot as i remembered him.  Joe was also great playing grumpy Dean Higgins in the Disney movies during the 70's with the college kids as well.  What also surprised me was the reunion of series regulars Ernest Borgnine, Edson Stroll, Bob Hastings, Carl Ballantine, and Tim Conway and how well it came off.  Their stories were very interesting and entertaining.  I wish this segment would have lasted longer.  I was disappointed though that they didn't include other series survivors Bobby Wright, Yoshio Yoda, and Gavin MacLeod in the reunion segment too.  Maybe The Shout Factory can give us a longer unedited version when they come out with the season two collection, which i hope will be real soon!  If you're a lover of classic tv, then buy this dvd collection now!!!!  You'll laugh your head off!!!",1177027200,8,1084,4.8901098901098905
2727116,5,B000M8N412,"I hadn't seen these episodes for many years prior to getting this release, and seeing them now it amazes me how well written and acted this show was.  All the actors, especially Borgnine, Flynn, and Ballantine, were superb.  And it's fun to watch the show ""find itself"" as the first season unfolds.  It's strange that it hasn't had more exposure in syndication, which has resulted, I would suspect, in the show being almost unknown to younger members of the audience.  Anyway, as for the DVDs, the episodes look great and are completely intact.  It is easy to navigate through the menu.  There isn't much in the way of extras, but the one they did include is very enjoyable.  It has some of the cast members (Borgnine, Conway, Ballantine, Stroll, and Hastings) discuss the making of the program.  In conclusion, this is a wonderfully entertaining show and I recommend this DVD set to anyone who likes to laugh.",1176854400,5,910,4.751592356687898
2727117,5,B000M8N412,"McHale's Navy was a classic piece of Television. Done in 1962-1963, this first season showed the comedy like Operation Peticoat did for the movies.

Oscar winner Ernest Borgnine is Quinton McHale. Tim Conway (Pre-Carol Burnett or Disney movies) was the bumbling Charles Parker. Joe Flynn showcased what he did later for Disney films and embodied Captain Binghamton. The supporting cast included Gavin McLeod (long before the Love Boat), Magician Carl Ballingtine and Bob Hastings (Gordon on Batman the Animated Seroes)

When this classic comedy works, the laughes are freeflowing..and it works many many times over. Over 36 episodes, done in glorous Black & White, the DVD collection  is total enjoyable

M*A*S*H was a great show which was a combo of comedy and drama. This show took the drama out of the war and just made you laugh..and its what comedy is meant to

2727119,5,B000M8N412,".....and I have been. With laughter!!!

""McHale's Navy"" has become a new favorite here on the homefront. My dad and I both watch this show every night and laugh hysterically. It's that funny. It's too bad these are no longer shown on TV, because a new generation would benefit from all the outrageous hijinks.

McHale (the shamefully and criminally underrated Ernest Borgnine) always seems to get out of the most unusual situations, at the same time, getting under the skin of one Captain Binghamton (one of TV's funniest characters ever, expertly played by the late, great Joe Flynn) who wants McHale and his ""motley crew"" drummed out of his area (in this case, World

War II-era South Pacific). Also hilarious is Ensign Charles ""Chuck"" Parker, deftly played by a young, pre-""Carol Burnett Show"" Tim Conway. Even back then, Tim had it.

Oh, sure, I could go on and on, but I would take way too long. Plus in the time I'm writing this review, you'll have had enough time to have watched an episode or two, thus defeating the purpose. And, contrary to the above review, ""McHale's Navy"" is, in my opinion, ABOVE par with shows like ""MASH"" and ""Sgt. Bilko"". ""MASH"" isn't even in the league with the other two shows.

So, now we have, I think, three more seasons to go, as well as two series-era COLOR feature films, ""McHale's Navy"" and ""McHale's Navy Joins The Air Force"", both of which NEED to be released on DVD and fast! And, unless you're curious, don't even bother with the inferior '90's remake, though Ernest Borgnine does make an appearance, which might be the only reason I would even watch it. And if these do not come out soon, well....

2727122,5,B000M8N412,"I give up, Shout Factory. How do you get to the episodes? Do you really have to push ""forward"" on the remote four times to get to the menu? At least with previous Shout Factory releases such as Home Movies, the flagship show of Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block, you could push ""menu"" to get to the episodes. Like Rhino, Shout Factory, despite their ad flyer, betrays no love for classic TV, and shows no sense of what they're doing.

They also, like the entire TV industry, have a completely wrong view of the demographics of the viewing audience. If you think there's no market for classic TV, sit back and watch the sales. What there's no market for is Shout Factory's fumbled handling of this classic material. Next time leave out the ""collectible temporary tatoos"" and put the ""trailer collection"" in the menu, where it belongs. There's also no reason to have ""play all"" as a menu selection on TV shows, which are made to be watched one at a time. If studios want to stop bootlegging, try putting out DVD sets people will actually want.

The show, on the other hand, is hands down five stars. Long before MASH, this was a military comedy played for laughs, but with serious undertones. The writing is so good it recalls the early days of TV in New York, which began with filmed plays, and hearkens to the days when ""sitcom"" was not a dirty word. Ernest Borgnine is excellent as Commander McHale, and the young(er) Tim Conway is hyserical as Ensign Parker.

Looking backwards, this show tipped its hat to Phil Silvers and Sergeant Bilko, and sparked interest for other military- themed sitcoms like Ensign O'Toole. If Shout Factory had made a ship shape release, this would be a six star DVD set. I hope someone like Leonard Maltin, who loves and understands classic TV will get involved in the fight to improve DVD sets before it's too late. Season one includes 36 black and white episodes on five one- sides discs in a three sleeve box set.",1174694400,8,1947,4.589080459770115
2727123,5,B000M8N412,"I purchased this Tuesday the 20th as it came out. I'd had some concerns because I had read an uncomplimentary review last week where it was said the transfers were terrible. This could not be further from the truth as these are every bit as good as the year they came out on television, 1962. I think the problem with reviewers under the age of thirty is that they are spoiled and have been special effected to death and do not know the charm of the real deal when they see it. This is an excellent production and very watchable and as I understand completly re edited to 100% of each episode. If you grew up on this as I did and have been missing seeing them in syndication for what seems like forever, cheer up, this is a great purchase.",1174435200,35,739,4.24822695035461
