In times of tyranny and injustice when the law oppresses the people the outlaw takes his place in history, such as England at the turn of the 12th century. In Nottingham three are hoof beats in the night. Someone has stolen their seed grain. King Richard the Lion Heart is plundering his way back to England after ten years on his Crusade. Robin Longstride, an archer, is outlawed for defending the weak against the strong. Men approach a castle to attack it with arrows while others attempt to scale the walls. In London King John enjoys the company of a French noblewoman. There is a question of succession, his wife is barren. Elsewhere gambling leads to a fight, and punishment. Philip of France plots against Richard the Lion Heart. Back at the castle the King is struck by an arrow!

There is an ambush in the forest! Back in Nottingham the people need seed grain for planting. The survivors sail to England. Locksley delivers the crown to the Kings mother, who gives it to John. High taxes oppress the people, these are difficult times. A new Marshal is chosen. Robin Longstride seeks Sir Locksley, who offers him a deal to pose as his son to save his lands. A pigeon brings news that 200 French soldiers have landed. Robin and Marian ride their lands (without hats). Robin converses with Friar Tuck. The Tax Collectors come to villages and use force. Marshal tells the Queen Mother about Godfrey, who is in contact with the King of France. Isabella tells John, who reacts. The Sheriff of Nottingham is an ally of Godfrey. King John meets Marshal for advice. Godfrey plans to attack Nottingham.

Robin is told of his fathers fate. The Barons gather, Marshal speaks. King John arrives to warn about the French. Robin speaks next about building from the ground up, a Charter of Liberty by law. King John promises to do that. French soldiers invade Nottingham, killing, looting, and burning. Godfrey meets Marian, it is not friendly. The English ride there to attack the invaders and stop them. French ships arrive and get the signal to land. The English go to war. Their arrows fall like hail on the invaders. There is a cavalry charge and battle scenes. Then a duel between Robin and Godfrey. The French withdraw to fight another day. King John burns the Charter and declares Robin an outlaw! These outlaws have no taxes or tithes, or rich or poor. The legends begin.

This is not a good story. Too many dark scenes, and too different from the past legends and movies, such as the 1938 movie. It deserves to be avoided. But I don't know much about 12th century English history. Was the story accurate?",1523923200,,2630,4.673866090712743
