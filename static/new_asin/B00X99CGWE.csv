7166947,5,B00X99CGWE,"trim, tough, and unsparingly violent. This movie probably could not be made today. I know it couldn't because Lee Marvin is no longer with us or anybody that comes close to him. And let's not forget about the actress who plays Clarabelle. I think Clint Eastwood might have seen the ending and repeated it in Unforgiven.",1439769600,3,319,4.714285714285714

7166951,5,B00X99CGWE,"A fascinating piece of under-appreciated cinema. Poetic, off-beat, violent and humorous, this film contains Lee Marvin at his coolest and Sissy Spacek's glowing, ethereal  cinematic debut. Fans of genuine cinema won't be disappointed. The transfer is excellent with minimal extras.",1438560000,11,281,6.025
8715543,4,B00X99CGWE,"Good transfer of the film.  An older, but lesser known Lee Marvin film, & includes a very young Sissy Spacek & Gene Hackman.  Focuses on the rivalry between Chicago  mob, and  an upstart Kansas  offshoot.",1520812800,,204,4.714285714285714

8715545,5,B00X99CGWE,"Prime 'retro' from the '70s and definitely NOT for children, so be warned.  Interesting to watch Lee Marvin, Gene Hackman and Sissy Spacek back in the day.  JCH",1504224000,,160,4.678571428571429
8715546,5,B00X99CGWE,"Excellent copy of the movie ""Prime Cut"" a must see. I was hoping for more languages and maybe a fold out cardboard insert package but this is not a collectors copy.",1481500800,,164,4.32258064516129
8715547,4,B00X99CGWE,No sub titles. They should make note of that. Great movie.,1469232000,,58,4.363636363636363
8715548,5,B00X99CGWE,Prim Cut is one of Lee Marvin best outing with an all star cast Gene Hackman and Sissy Spacek are both very good in this movie.the bluray is excellent.,1457395200,,151,4.241379310344827
8715549,4,B00X99CGWE,It has been a long time since I first saw this movie and it is just as good now as it was years ago. Gene Hackman was icing on the cake!,1453680000,,136,3.4193548387096775
8715550,2,B00X99CGWE,"Talented cast in a quite bad film. Nothing in this plot makes sense: Marvin's an enforcer from Chicago, sent to punish Hackman for not paying the mob what he owes; the plot unfolds further, only because Hackman's character is guilty of too much self-confidence. He clearly needs an army, but only has a psycho brother and a handful of amateurs, so you can guess what happens in the end. Why Hackman's character owes the mob is never revealed, but we do know that Marvin's character disapproves of Hackman's character's dealings in drugs and prostitution, so presumably the  mob that Marvin works for is only into decent and moral crimes. In other words, prostitution's bad but mass murder's just part of the gig, right? It's better than a one star film, only because these actors walk through their parts so confidently. Spacek essentially delivers her ""Three Women"" persona, although in this case we're supposed to consider it cute rather than weirdly creepy. Too much of this film just feels improvised""How about using some of that farm equipment somehow?""and most of the ""action"" is tedious and should have been edited out. They should also have hired a couple more writers to come up with a few at least halfway believable scenes.",1443916800,,1234,4.904306220095694
8715551,4,B00X99CGWE,"Ever seen Film Noir in a Kansas wheat field? Here's your chance.
After Dirty Dozen, Lee Marvin was making some quirky, often dark movies. Prime Cut is such a weird slice of life, I've never been sure who to recommend it to. A Lee Marvin fan will certainly eat it up, but don't expect Cat Ballou or Point Blank. Marvin is a mob enforcer who has a code of honor as do his fellow henchmen. Or maybe it's that Gene Hackman's character is so evil practically anyone looks good next to him. Did I say he was evil? Gene could always play the villain, and he really locks it up this time. Ditto for his creepy, brutish brother. It seems director Ritchie is indicting the Sunbelt as a sinful wasteland as all the inhabitants seem evoke a sinister dark side. He emphasizes this with Hackman's thugs who are silent, blond, overall clad farmboys wielding shotguns and bloodlust. Marvin manages to lighten his grim task up with a twinkle in his eye now and then; just enough to let you know he's confident and competent to set things right. Give it a try, but be aware this is no kiddie show.",1442534400,4,1079,4.4
