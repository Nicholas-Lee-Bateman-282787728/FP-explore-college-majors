8272978,1,B00014NESA,"This is a very cheaply made film, and the plot is silly and unbelievable. The only thing that makes this movie even viewable is that the long lost Lamont Sanford ""Demond Wilson"" from the classic ""Sanford and Son"" has a small part in this film. It was neat to see him after all of these years. If you are looking for a film that is even remotely interesting however, do not waste your money on this one!",1212969600,,402,4.233766233766234
