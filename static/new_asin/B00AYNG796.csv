5528689,5,B00AYNG796,Even when he doesn't play monsters he brings something to no matter what role he plays.  What a talented actor.  He loved performing and put every bit of himself in every role.,1386892800,4,176,4.46875
5528690,4,B00AYNG796,All is good. Only problem: no subtitles. And very annoying the FBI opening advertisement (Warner want prison for movies of 80 years ago!),1377043200,2,137,5.0
5528691,4,B00AYNG796,"Great to see these 3 rare Karloff films released for the first time, all rather short (approx an hour each) and not his best work by far but if you collect Boris films they are great additions, showcasing his amazing range. Best of all, the disc is REGION FREE so no region restrictions, easily played on UK players.

Lets hope sales of this are good so that studios will continue to dig out and release the remaining Karloff films gathering dust.",1367452800,5,447,4.518518518518518
5528692,5,B00AYNG796,"Boris Karloff known as king of the monsters was much more than that and a hell of an actor.
He did many roles  but most only saw his horror movies. Here are 3 non horror roles. The
best if Devil's Island. A classic Karloff film that doesn't get it's due. He is sent to Devil's
Island and attempts escape and eventually found innocent of the crime! West of Shangai has
him again playing a oriental character which he plays excellent. I'm sure today it would be
considered racist! It's a great war type movie. Invisible Menance is a military movie but more
like a mystery movie and once gets going is pretty good. If your a Karloff fan you should get
these just to see a different side of Karloff which is brillant.",1359676800,17,713,4.360902255639098
8559297,5,B00AYNG796,great collection of rarely seen Karloff movies. Karloff is great as usual.,1529884800,,74,5.25

8559299,2,B00AYNG796,"Boris Karloff (1887-1969)  started in films in 1916 and up until 1931 he was a bit player in B films. Then came ""Frankenstein"" (1931), ""The Mummy"" (1932) and ""The Mask of Fu Manchu"" (1932) and he was off on a whirlwind career that lasted for decades, with Karloff usually playing the villain. It's clear from his classic works that he was an excellent actor, and though he was typecast in Horror films or as an Asian menace (e.g., ""Mask of Fun Manchu"", West of Shanghai). The films included here should be thought of as his ""lesser"" works and if you are a true Karloff fans you'll be interested, especially with ""Devil's Island"" as Karloff gets to play one of his rare hero roles. But the film itself is very ordinary",1450483200,2,717,4.515384615384615
8559300,5,B00AYNG796,Nice addition to my collection.  Quick delivery.,1433116800,,48,5.857142857142857
8559301,5,B00AYNG796,"Three films starring the master Karloff that you always heard about and saw pictures in magazines of but never got to see. What a treat they are. Not the usual horror roles. This is Karloff stretching his acting chops in three dramas and, as always, very good in each.",1423008000,,268,4.489795918367347

8559303,4,B00AYNG796,Good movie excellent performance of Boris Karloff like always,1409356800,,61,5.888888888888889
8559304,4,B00AYNG796,See Karloff as the underated actor that he was and is so brilliantly funny and corrupt as the Chinese general in Shanhai.  Worth the price of all three!,1407369600,,152,4.428571428571429
8559305,5,B00AYNG796,The quality of the movies was very good. I only bought it for Devil's Island which was the best movie of those three.,1400889600,3,117,4.130434782608695
8559306,3,B00AYNG796,"This disc has three B&W Karloff movies from the 1930's included.  The prints and the transfer are OK.
I bought the disc for ""Devil's Island"" and I like it.  The disc was expensive, however, all things considered.  Were these films licensed or in the public domain?  Next time, give us Karloff fans a break with the pocketbook.",1395964800,,326,4.666666666666667
