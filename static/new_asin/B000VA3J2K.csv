8217736,5,B000VA3J2K,Good old English comedy back to life. Tony Hancock was a complete legend and way ahead of his time and I'm so happy that this collection is available. I also have all the audio work too. Just hope the lost episodes turn up sometime. Miracles do happen!,1483488000,,252,4.382978723404255

8217738,5,B000VA3J2K,"Simply one of the greatest comedic talents the world has ever seen. This man will raise anyone's spirits with his self deprecating wit playing off against the brilliant (and villainous) Sid James. I remember his untimely passing over 40 years ago in Sydney, Australia and recall feeling at the time the world had lost of of the greats! I still feel that way all these years later. Every episode is good but the National Trust one where Hancock tries to get the English National Trust to repair his house by pretending Lord Byron once slept there is hilarious.",1392940800,2,559,4.714285714285714
8217739,5,B000VA3J2K,"I looked for these shows for years without success then, lo and behold I found them on Amazon.  They did not dissappoint.  Jim W",1376352000,,128,4.291666666666667
8217740,5,B000VA3J2K,"This is just a tremendous set that includes every surviving ""Hancock's Half Hour"" and
""Hancock"" episode. I was familiar with the classic episodes - ""The Economy Drive"",
""The Ladies Man"", ""The Blood Donor"" etc - they had been televised many years ago on
the ABC as ""Classic Hancock"" but every episode I have seen from this collection so
far is nothing short of hilarious. From ""The New Nose"" where Tony resorts to desperate
measures to change his old nose that happens to be the height of hilarity according
to all the girls he dates!! To ""Ericsson the Viking"" in which Sid tries to persuade
him to ditch comedy and take up historical dramas. There are times (in several of the
episodes) when no one can keep a straight face, when someone flubs a line and Hancock
saves the day by telling a joke or just cracking up!!
""The Set That Failed"" was an extremely topical look at how television had encroached
on British life in the late 1950s. Tony's set is broken and he grits his teeth determined
to spend the night ""setless"" but not knowing how!! When he hears the ""Robin Hood"" theme
he just has to find a working set, come what may!! One suprising thing - Tony and Sid
weren't always a pair of likely lads bunkering down at East Cheam!! The initial episodes
experimented with Hancock in a variety of occupations - as a lawyer in ""The Crown Vs Sid
James"" and as an airline steward in ""The Last Airline Steward Hancock"".
There is also a ""Face to Face"" interview with a very shy Hancock from 1960 where the
interviewer tries to probe into his childhood, what makes him laugh, his religious beliefs,
whether he prefers the country to the city to how he spends his wealth (""Mr. Hancock, there
are rumours flying around that the BBC is paying you 35,000 pounds a year"") and Tony
sidesteps the question very cagily. In a quite telling part of the interview he admitted
that comedy was his whole life and if he felt he had nothing more to give he just couldn't
continue on.",1365033600,2,1962,4.514044943820225
8217741,4,B000VA3J2K,"Comprehensive collection of Hancock TV shows, some excellent, some almost painful after all this time, but interesting souvenirs.  Easy to see why TH had perhaps less success on TV than on radio.  Discs play fine on my euro-laptop.",1323734400,,231,5.052631578947368
8217742,5,B000VA3J2K,"Before Monty Python there was Tony Hancock and Sid James in ""HHancock's HHalf HHour"".  I must have been about 7 years old when these first came out on TV in England.  Some of the episodes have been lost but this collection of 37 is just fabulous and just as funny as I remember.  Not that I remember all of them.

Hancock was the master of pathos - in some ways an earlier version of Basil Fawlty with his delusions of grandeur.  Sid James held up his end as the crafty con man.  Do not look for great production values.  This is old time TV in black and white and the recordings are what they are.  But this is classic Hancock at his best and it is wonderful to watch these shows over 50 years on and over 40 years after his untimely death at the age of 44.  A man ""of his caliber"" is sorely missed.",1303084800,5,800,4.076923076923077
