8676391,5,B00N5FW7EO,"Loved it.  I served in Korea and those memories from the LN's are spot on from what I heard.  The ROK Army has a great reputation, they are at least respected by American G.I.'s as much as we respect the Brits and the Isrealis.  This show lives up to that.  Love FSG Lee as being the natural leader, but SGT Park steals the show as being the archetypical ROK Army NCO.  He reminds me of my ROK Army SGM, SGM Beak.",1425081600,2,413,4.049382716049383

8676393,5,B00N5FW7EO,Great series. Shows both sides of Korea and the impact of the Korean War. Excellent acting and subtitles are spot on very realistic language usage. Americans speak English and Chinese speak Chinese. Recommended this series for anyone who wants to learn more about the Korean War and see what horror this conflict caused which is still in effect today. Very hard series to find recommend purchasing from Beverly Liu. Very professional and you will get series immediately.,1411862400,3,470,5.116883116883117
