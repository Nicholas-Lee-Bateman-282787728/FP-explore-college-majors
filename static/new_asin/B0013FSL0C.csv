3105954,1,B0013FSL0C,"Do not waste your time. I like Gabriel Byrne, I did not like this maudlin, whiny, depressing, disjointed series. (and I watched the whole first season, so that's not based on one episode..which were thankfully only a half hour long)",1207180800,,232,4.825
3105955,4,B0013FSL0C,"The series is thought provoking and very well acted.  The characters express themselves credibly and draw you into their lives without effort.  While sharing therapy with these patients, one is sure to find an issue which will strike home.",1207094400,16,239,5.102564102564102
3105956,5,B0013FSL0C,"What an amazing program.  The writing is brilliant as is the acting.  But more importantly the over all quality of this series is something you NEVER see anymore.  The thoughtful insightful details that went into this show, from the always present water theme to the overlapping and mirroring of the main character's issues is unheard of these days.  What a gem of forethought artistic endeavor and outstanding acting.  The actors are all a notch above anything I would have expected, even from HBO.  These are some of the most memorable performances I've seen on the small screen in a long long time if not ever.  So worth what ever it costs to have this in your library.",1206662400,22,672,4.6923076923076925
3105957,5,B0013FSL0C,"For some reason I had some resistance to watching this new series from HBO.  Was it going to be so-so like ""Tell Me You Love Me""?  Was it another ""John From Cincinnati"" that only 10% of it's viewing audience understood (or cared about)?

Where was the next ""Soprano's"", ""Six Feet Under"", ""Sex in the City""? Why was I even getting HBO - I've seen their movies over and over and anything new was not anything I wanted to see so as a last ditch effort to convince myself that I ""needed"" HBO, one cold and rainy Saturday, I decided to give ""In Treatment"" a chance (I have onDemand and had access to 7 of the 9 weeks of ""sessions"" thus far).

The deal was I only had to watch one or two of the 30 minutes episodes.  If I didn't like it, at least I could say that I gave it a chance.  Okay, you already know the obvious based on my title of this review how much I liked it, but I need to state it again, GET TREATED!  It's that great.  Beyond great as a matter of fact.

We get to follow the week-to-week therapy sessions of 4 individuals (including the therapist) and one couple.  If you've ever been to therapy, it's an instant recognition of the process.  If you want to spend time with an incredible drama with the sharpest, most relatable writing and actors that can't convince me they aren't actors but real players for the entertainment of us ""flies on the wall"", then this might be a series for you.  Gabriel Byrne, who portrays the therapist is phenomenal.

Does it sound normal that a person should get depressed and want to go into therapy to discuss why this season ending should affect me so?  Call me crazy and make me an appointment!",1206403200,115,1642,4.306188925081433
3105958,1,B0013FSL0C,"This wasn't for me at all. Just some chick talking to her shrink..boring. I didn't even finish it. Glad it was free so nothing lost but my time. I would have given ""no stars"" if it would have let me.",1206403200,,199,4.0
3105959,5,B0013FSL0C,"and if it gets 10 awards, then I won't be AT ALL shocked. very thoughtful. the cast is EXCELLENT. not one of the characters that has been ""in treatment"" lacked good acting skills.

the doctor is very intelligent and usually knows what he's after and how to get the current patients to open up...AND feel uncomfortable. he's on point with the questions and barely makes time to mess around.

to be honest when i first heard of it and saw it on many times over, i skipped right over it hoping it'd fade from existence. but i didn't know how well put together the show actually was! its excellence can be seen from the get go.

anyone who doesn't like this show is free to their opinion(s), but just so they know i'm -NOT- on their side!

end note: watch it and prepare to be glued on this jubilantly-addictive psychological drama.",1206230400,28,828,4.4635761589403975
3105960,5,B0013FSL0C,"The palette this series uses to paint emotive, empathic, and richly textured profiles of real problems with people has an alluring and self-therapeutic effect. This sounds cheesy, but after a few episodes you grow and feel a kinship with the characters.

I don't know how to describe how amazingly real this series is.  As someone's not only studied therapy and psychology academically, but who has also been ""in treatment"" for over 100 hours, this is the closest thing to real thing.  Byrne is exceptional.  Wise, smooth, suave, composed, compassiaonte, and real.  His supporting cast (the patients) are equally captivating.",1205971200,127,625,5.2727272727272725
3105961,5,B0013FSL0C,"This is a great series! I've watched three episodes and I am already hooked. The stories and acting are top notch, and the filming is excellent. I don't currently have cable TV service, but would actually break down and get it in order to watch other episodes. Believe me...that is saying a lot, because I have prided myself in not being a TV watcher. :)",1205539200,,354,4.461538461538462
3105962,5,B0013FSL0C,"Fine example of great television plot structure.  You can follow the large story arch's of each individual character or drop in for a single episode and still be engrossed in the story.  This show is made for television and not dvd like so many other tv shows today.  Thoroughly enjoyable, relies on good acting and good writing, not on gimmicks.",1205280000,33,346,4.733333333333333
3105963,5,B0013FSL0C,"This series is ""over-the-top."" It is a fascinating, spell-binding drama where the viewer is the ""fly-on-the-wall"" watching the relationships between therapist and client. Excellent writing and acting!!! Surely to win awards...",1204675200,37,226,6.32258064516129
3105964,5,B0013FSL0C,"This is an incredibly daring show. So simple yet so complex. Most of the episodes play out as two-handers. Admittedly, it could work as a series of one-act plays. It's just a therapist talking to his patients. There is a very high level of writing and acting going on here. Now, people will find themselves drawn to different character's stories and it can be a bit of a mixed bag because of that. But, there's so much material here, it's hard to knock it. Gabriel Byrne is really great in his role. He's convincing in his role as a therapist. And, what's more, he seems like a good one (foibles aside). This is by far the best season of In Treatment for one reason: Mia Washikowska, who plays ""Sophie."" Wow. What a stunning outing for a 13(ish) year old. There is a particular episode, the close of her arc, which utterly destroyed me. I'd made the mistake of watching the episode while waiting for a haircut and had to retreat to my car to bawl sans judgement. Her nuance, her honesty, her control are all way way way beyond her years. I always looked forward to her sessions during the series. All in all, it's a good series. You have to appreciate the daring of the format and grab bag of human stories.",1501459200,,1207,4.417040358744394
3105965,5,B0013FSL0C,"This is a series of thoughtful, gradual character studies of a psychologist and some of his patients, week-to-week.  It's in real time (or very close to it), lending a distant sense of ""reality"" TV, except with depth and storytelling.  The creator (Hagai Levi) and lead writer (Sarah Treem) are also paired in The Affair, a showtime series that aired several years later and which (I think) is better-known.  Their moody style; their focus on the difficulty of accurately assessing other people's motives and knowledge sets; and their interest in timing and the importance of place (even, in this case, a single room) are all recognizable between the two series.  So is the unnecessary amount of sexual detail, except here it's all verbal re-telling, so it doesn't feel as distracting from the plot as the borderline porn in The Affair.",1494633600,,836,4.9928057553956835
3105966,5,B0013FSL0C,"HBO's In Treatment is television at its best, its most creative, with insightful scripts and fantastic acting. I loved all three seasons, but Season One was my favorite, and it features a jaw-dropping, soulful performance from then newcomer Mia Wasikowska as Sophie - truly amazing. Gabriel Byrne is remarkable, he's the glue that holds everything together. These characters and performances are truly unforgettable - each episode is like a beautifully written one act play. If you haven't seen it, give it a chance to work its magic - it's something you won't soon forget.",1494115200,,573,5.1063829787234045

3105972,5,B0013FSL0C,"A nice nod to psychoanalytically oriented illumination of the unconscious in all of us. A great way to give an intimate look into a variety of personal stories and perspectives, all the while humanizing the therapist himself. Blurred boundaries, transference, dual relationships, safety, liability, all the ethical lines are explored and exposed. One of the only shows to depict the isolating and challenging parts of being a therapist.",1486598400,,436,5.426470588235294

By the end of the first episode, I was hooked! Gabriel Byrne's portrayal was gripping, going from a Father-like guidance figure to a rather petulant husband when not in office. Even though I have the 1st season on DVD, I would not recommend binge watching the show, it's quite intense in parts.",1485388800,,445,4.575

Gabriel Byrne is wonderful and this show really makes you think. At some point we will all see ourselves, know we are all just human and hopefully make us a better, understanding person.

3105992,5,B0013FSL0C,"Excellent, entertaining....fantastic writing. I absolutely loved the conflicts and insights brought up in the treatment...never a dull moment.
Gabriel Byrne is my new favorite actor. It was also refreshing to see a show with depth that addresses the human condition rather than all the shows out there that are action-packed and shallow with the only plot being 'finding the bad guy.'",1484179200,,384,5.311475409836065

The main character and his ""supervisor"" break so many APA ethics code, that seriously if I were to ever teach an ethic class, I would choose this show as a demonstration of what NOT to do in therapy. There are several scenes that are directly related to the specific ethic codes that are being broken. If the psychotherapist in this show was a real psychotherapist, he would've lost his license to practice.

Otherwise, I guess for viewers who are not in the field, it's entertaining. I just hope if you ever need therapy, don't expect your sessions to go the way they are portrayed on this show.",1478736000,2,917,4.767295597484277

3106043,5,B0013FSL0C,"Wasn't sure if I would continue to watch the show after watching the first few episodes. 90% of the time it's no more than back and-forth talk between Paul, the psychotherapist, and his patient(s). However, after a couple more episodes, I took a little more time to study the show, read through the synopsis, get a sense of the flow, etc. Paul has five cases (including himself!) that run sequentially over 50+ episodes - every fifth case being the same patient. Once I had a clear picture of what was going on, I actually went back and started all over - which didn't take a lot of time because each episode only lasts ~22 minutes.

I'm quite familiar with Gabriel Byrne - part of the reason I focused in on the show in the first place - and he does an excellent job. Guest stars include Diane Weist, former Law and Order DA, Blair Underwood from LA Law (why hasn't this show been syndicated or ???) - Josh Charles (The Good Wife) - and several others; all giving great performances. All in all it's a great show, but you do have to pay very close attention to the dialogue. A good bit of intrigue to: two patients meet on their way out/in and get involved; Paul has his own dysfunctional family issues to deal with all the while. So, if you like psychological thrillers without all the blood and guts, you're certain to enjoy this series.",1478304000,,1340,4.4471544715447155
3106044,5,B0013FSL0C,"The acting is excellent.  The psychiatrist seems troubled himself, but is very focused on his patient's well being and is persistent in his work with them.

3106055,3,B0013FSL0C,This product was ok. But to be honest not the type of shows I watch..,1477180800,,69,3.6666666666666665
3106056,3,B0013FSL0C,"I first watched the Sophie episodes only, and I thought, ""This is the most brilliant show I've ever seen. Amazing acting. Unbelievable attention to detail with facial expressions and body language, since half of the show's content is displayed in those most subtle indicators."" The episodes spoke deeply to me, I guess, maybe because my own psychiatric illness and therapy issues are most like hers. I don't rewatch shows, but I rewatched those.

Then I went back and watched the others.

On a subjective level,
I've had bad experience with therapists and therapeutic relationship boundaries, and the Laura episodes brought back flashbacks from that even though my issues weren't the same as hers. Warning to anyone else triggered by that subject!
I didn't relate to anything with Alex's circumstances or mindset, and my marriage is happy so I didn't relate to much of the couple's struggles either.

On an objective level, the show was incredible regardless of whether I could personally relate to the characters. I was better able to relate to a foreign mindset because of the show.

MY BIGGEST ISSUE: The sessions with Gina
WHAT THE HECK??? I felt sick by the end of every episode because he spent the entire time criticizing a kind, thoughtful woman trying to help. He threw stuff, yelled, belittled, and basically tried to destroy her. It was very, very upsetting.
It doesn't even make sense! He spent the rest of the week as a thoughtful person helping others, but then within three minutes of seeing an old friend, he rips into her? He backs down and says a nice thing ever five minutes or so and then goes against what he says while he rants about her evil motives and how she's just out to get him and just wants to cause him personal suffering. WHAT???
Just now in week four with Gina, Paul is telling Gina she has no empathy, that he thought she never even liked therapy, that why would she do something with people who seem so disgusting to her - all of which is clearly not true, so where is this coming from and what the heck is it doing in the show?
The episodes with Gina are why I reduced my otherwise 7-star review to 3 stars, not because her acting was bad but because the screenwriting was TERRIBLE.",1477008000,3,2219,4.653061224489796

We can aldo appreciate the profound process of healing and showing the reality that not everybody can handle it. I also love how they show the 2 sides by exposing Paul (the therapist) vulnerablities and insecurities and also taking therapy!

The unusual, and rewarding aspect is that there is no attempt to ""solve"" a problem in the short span of the episode.  The episode ends with my wife and I discussing the content.  The writers have enough respect for the audience to allow the audience to come to a ""conclusion"", if one is necessary.  Highly recommend the series.",1475798400,,474,4.8625

Extraordinary verisimilitude in terms of not only the counseling environment and interactions, but also the behind-the-scenes family dynamics that attend this profession.  (NOTE:  I was involved, at one time or other, as a substance abuse counselor, an adolescent sexuality counselor, and group therapist in multiple 12-step programs and also suicide prevention hotlines.)  Whether a LCSW, a psychologist, or psychiatrist--or other professional involved in social/relationship work--the industry of ""care givers"" is often plagued by ""burnout, addiction, and deep plunges into Nietsche's abyss.)  Yet what would we do without them?  As G.K. Chesterton intoned: ""We are all shipmates on a stormy sea and owe each other a terrible loyalty.""  He meant, of course, not BAD but rather ""fierce.""  This program and its extraordinary circus of cases and breadth of clients brings out vestiges of the worst...and best in all of us.  It takes a while for the drama to get rolling, yet fortunately it begins to achieve a momentum and rhythm of its own that puts the human drama in bit-sized pieces (segments are less than a half hour each.)  In this age where everything is dumbed down, twitterized, and relegated to 25-words-or-less without context or compassion, this Series is the only one I've ever awarded FIVE Stars, irrespective of its general popularity (either by other raters, Rotten Tomatoes, or pundits who want to put their often negative two cents in...because they can.)",1473984000,2,1510,5.382978723404255

3106153,5,B0013FSL0C,"The treatment of the therapy process is accurate. As occurs in the real world, everyone -- including the therapists themselves -- questions the value of therapy. By the end of the season, it is not clear that any of the protagonists have experienced happier or more fulfilling lives as a consequence of the therapy they experience. The drive to be honest and to let it all hang out is gut wrenching, and as the show illustrates, can yield tragic consequences. Sometimes it is better not to venture into the deep, dark recesses of the mind and heart. On the other hand, there are aha! moments when the patient's experience breakthrough insights that enable them to understand better why they feel and behave the way they do. The acting is first rate. Each of the five patients the doctor is treating is credible and, by the end of the season, worthy of our sympathy. Given that the nearly forty episodes of the show take place in the a therapist's office, it is amazing how the excellent script and fine acting keep us riveted to the drama as it unfolds.",1467590400,,1053,4.6063829787234045

I have seen too many movies that portray the therapist and the patient unrealistically. This episode rings true for both patient and therapist and accurately portrayed that type of session. I hope that the rest of the episodes follow suit. I am not sure how interesting these sessions would be for lay person but at least the series will inform the public what they could expect in psychotherapy. Of course, not all therapies are the same so that is the other variable that should be considered. But in general, so far, the portrayal is realistic enough to let potential clients what to expect and seasoned clients to see if what they see is similar ro what they are experiencing in their own sessions.",1457568000,,805,4.798561151079137

The manner in which transference was handled by the therapist was an example to model.

Some of the psychotherapeutic devices are a little trite, the patients can be very annoying at times, and Gabriel Byrne's character is gradually revealed to be deeply neurotic and fairly oblivious to the effect he has on people in his own life. All this is very realistic! My only quibble is Bryne's acting seems a bit off at some points, as if he's just not into it, or doesn't quite believe his own character would behave that way.

Gabriel Byrne is magical and captivating to watch as his quiet presence speaks volumes. I have never had the privilege of watching a series like this before. Mark Walberg, the Executive Producer, weaves life's biggest questions regarding moral code, ethics, societal norms and it's hypocrasies throughout each patient's struggles.

3106993,5,B0013FSL0C,"My intuition would have been that this series would not have appealed to me, but I have really liked Season 1 that I've watched. The writing is excellent as is the acting from the entire ensemble. Its an advantage when the most of the cast is relatively unknown so I had no preconceived ideas of the characters' personalities. I found the episodes gripping with the emotional interaction among the cast within what would seem to be a claustrophobic, single scene setting. I think the half hour time frame is an advantage as longer episodes would be emotionally exhausting and might become tedious as a result. This series is definitely not for someone looking for a lot of physical action or escapism.",1447027200,,701,4.801652892561983

3107009,5,B0013FSL0C,Insightful and excellently directed. I highly recommend this series. The world becomes a better place when people leave their own bubble to view and seek to understand the bubbles that others live in. Observance is a great teacher and this series embodies that. Gabriel Byrne does a great job of breaking down barriers and getting people to see their own reflections in a true light. The pathway to knowledge is understanding and not hiding. If people could learn to listen more than they talked the distractions of their words would no longer cloud what is really going on. Asking the right question is at the threshold of every solution! Kudos to all involved at the making of this series.,1446940800,,691,4.815126050420168

I thoroughly enjoyed the series, however season 1 was the best by far!! 4 stars for season 2, and 3 stars for season 3.  The series was very well written.  I loved the way the show portrayed Paul as the perfect/imperfect Therapist.  He was very influential in helping others, but struggled in his own personal life.  At times I felt as if I was also 'In Treatment' with Paul.  I highly recommend this series to those who appreciate mature dialogue.",1446076800,,519,4.410526315789474

I LOVE IT.",1445904000,,369,4.477611940298507
3107071,4,B0013FSL0C,"It is a great series if you like character development and the ability to discern there are so many life issues, especially while growing up, that can make you a psychiatric mess as an adult, tonnage in cheek.  It is not a series that concentrates on only one person /patient at a time . The story of each patient is carried throughout many episodes and many other patients are added in so you do not see a few episodes on one patient, then another patient for a few episodes, etc. The patient story may run through two seasons with other patients intermingled. Also the stories of the patients are different, in age, sex, personality, problem etc. Also the psychologist has his own story that runs throughout, with the patients interactions entwined in his life.
  It is a series that you can actually watch 4 or 5 episodes and not get bored. I have watched only a few series, as I had no idea there were so many on such a variety of subjects. Not a TV watcher per say. If I do watch, I normally channel surf until I find something that appears interesting.
  However, this series became addictive after  the first two episodes. With Amazon Prime and Netflix I have discovered that there, in fact, some very well written series and movies that I either was not aware of or thought it did not sound interesting.
  This series is one such series. My only complaint, so far, is that apparently everyone seeing a counselor talks back and tells him/her that he/she is incompetent and uses the F bomb freely-very freely.",1445731200,2,1515,4.564575645756458
3107072,4,B0013FSL0C,"Gabriel Byrne is always good acting and this one is consistently good as a psycho therapist over two years of sessions, playing weekly. The cases offer revealing personalities, only two were skimmed over, not tolerated. This was acting yet so realistic as therapy goes. The F word was overused and used by most all players. Our civilization is thus disappointing as such with words stuck in the teeth, I prefer a broken record.",1445731200,,427,4.863013698630137

3107113,4,B0013FSL0C,"A psychologist/psychotherapist interacts (if one can say that about a psychoanalyst) with an interesting and varied series of patients.

3107115,5,B0013FSL0C,"I have to be honest, I have not finished watching the entire series yet...but I love it so far. It is a very in depth and intimate look into peoples' lives through their sessions with their therapist and then how the patients lives had such an impact on the therapist. I never expected dialog between just two people in one room could be so emotional and so much more than just watching someone's actions. It is kind of having a story told to you (or even like just reading a really good book), and your own visions and thoughts of the story take over and become much more intense then what is ever shown on screen. I became so entranced with the stories of each of the patients, I had a hard time not staying up all night and day to watch all the episodes non-stop.

The patients in Season 1 really captured my interest. Perhaps not Amy and Jake right away, but later they became more interesting. Dianne Wiest as his alter ego, counsel, guide, whatever she happens to be in the episode, is an amazing actress. One of those rare breed of actors who lets me forget she's acting.

3107260,3,B0013FSL0C,"I was interested in the subject matter. This show is well done, and and began with great potential.

 I just became less interested when they went down the rabbit hole regarding the main character-intelligent psychiatrist falling head over heals in love with a long term patient, a lady known to him to be emotionally crippled, devious and sick... he then wrecks his own home life over this nonsensical fantasy.  Blech!  I expected more Intelligent behavior.

Tired of shows that dumb-down to cheap-thrills when the potential for so much more is right there.

3107319,5,B0013FSL0C,"When this show first came out on HBO, I tried watching it. After all, I subscribed to HBO, I was interested in psychology and psychotherapy, and I heard that the show was supposed to be good. However, I just couldn't get into it.

But over two years ago, I stopped subscribing to cable TV and started receiving all of my television through rabbit ears and Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu relayed through my Roku box. And, minus the distractions of the talking heads on cable networks such as CNN, I embarked upon a concentrated viewing of some of the greatest television drama programs ever including Battlestar Galactica (the remake), Friday Night Lights, Six Feet Under, Dexter, Deadwood, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, and Sons of Anarchy.

After that, I was primed and ready to try ""In Treatment"" again, and this time it grabbed my undivided attention from the very first episode and never let go throughout the entire first season. I found myself hanging on every word and gesture inside and outside Dr. Weston's ostensibly therapeutic inner sanctum and, like the therapists in the show, looking for the underlying meaning and significance of them all.

Virtually every scene in this superbly scripted and acted show is supercharged with crackling psychological intensity that engages the viewer, or at least this viewer, like no other program in memory. And, while ""In Treatment"" is arguably a little, or maybe more than a little, melodramatic in its depiction of what goes on in typical therapy, I think it's pretty realistic in its vivid portrayal of the bewilderingly complex, fluid nature of human psychodynamics, and a potent cautionary tale against exaggerated expectations for psychotherapists and their craft.

Judging from the first season, I think this is one of the finest and most unique shows in the history of American television, and I can't wait to start in on Season 2.",1442361600,,1899,5.0

3107435,5,B0013FSL0C,I'm a licensed professional counselor intern. We use this product in supervision to strengthen our counseling skills. As Paul sees his clients we observe/discuss what he does right and wrong as the therapist and what he could have done differently. We also use it to explore our counseling skills if we were working with such clients. Paul also sees a counselor himself which promotes the idea of self-care.

3107485,5,B0013FSL0C,"As a certified therapist, a physician and a psychologist, I was curious to see how the writers were going to handle the subject. I was very impressed with the verisimilitude displayed by both the writers and the actors. Yes, Virginia, there is a therapeutic relationship just like the one shown here. Of course, a real practice has more than 5 patients and  a whole lot less drama each week but otherwise it's an accurate picture.

That's the good news. The bad news is that this excellent writing and acting  seem to take a progressively steeper decline as the seasons progress. 5 stars for season 1, 3-4 for season two, and 1 for season 3. I'd suggest you stop watching after the first season.

SPOILER ALERT:
this intelligent and competent therapist turns into a real jerk who listens less and talks more as the show goes on. By season 3, You will find your self throwing things at the TV.",1441065600,2,892,4.591194968553459

The stories are told in the context of psychiatric sessions, and have powerful acting, since there's so many dramatic monologues and interaction involved.  Each patient goes from initial introduction to some sort of resolution of the issues addressed in his/her story, sometimes good and sometimes tragic.  It's possible to learn a lot about psychiatry, and it's engrossing trying to figure out the reasons for the behaviors brought to treatment.
I'm also hooked on how the good doctor will ever find happiness, himself.  Like some of his patients, I too am in love with him!!!",1440979200,,595,5.051020408163265

If I had no knowledge of psychiatrists or therapists, I would be very reluctant to start treatment with one, due to the behavior of this one, Jack. He has a weak sense of boundaries in his family relationships, and with his patients.  His supervising psychiatrist also portrays a lack of boundaries in her supervision of Jack. This may be the way the system exists, in some locations, but it made me very uncomfortable.

He enlist the support of his previous mentor , a retired psychologist to keep him in balance as he navigates the mucky waters of the ethical issues and boundaries clarifications  a therapist faces when confronted by patients who seek to entice them into crossing those clearly defined boundaries.

3107894,1,B0013FSL0C,"Barely made it through the first episode, and regretted hanging in there to finish it, as it never improved. Boring, one-dimensional, immature, unrealistic portrayal of therapy--plus. Gabriel Byrne apparently lacks the acting chops to pull off what is mostly a silent role--he's like a mannequin with a few lines. The character Laura goes on and on in lurid detail about a sexual encounter in a bar bathroom, which in real life any therapist would have redirected and challenged. Also, the actress decided to play it straight, when the only way to salvage that dialogue would be if she played it as trying to titillate and provoke the therapist. And in fact that would have created some much-needed tension in the interaction. Also ludicrous that the minute Laura confides her sexual obsession with the therapist that he wouldn't immediately explain that this is a common occurrence, it's called counter-transference, etc. etc. It's amazing that with a subject as potentially rich and compelling as therapy, they couldn't come up with even a decent first episode. I can't believe this lasted as a series.",1439164800,2,1104,5.104972375690608

3107897,2,B0013FSL0C,"Considering its immense potential for story lines, I found it sanctimonious and and formulaic. None of the characters (either their lines or their performances) drew me in and made me care about them one way or the other. The acting seemed to toggle between two modes: over-the-top crazy, beyond anything that the the subject matter warranted; or aloof disinterest as if the actors didn't want to be stuck in these roles and couldn't wait to go home.

DISCLAIMER: To be fair, I got so bored and turned off that I stopped watching it after two episodes. Maybe if I ever find myself even more bored than that, I'll give the series another chance. I would love an excuse to increase the number of stars I give it. But that's not likely to happen while so many other great choices exist.",1439078400,,783,4.5928571428571425

3107901,5,B0013FSL0C,"I'm nearly through the first season of ""In Treatment"" as of this writing after taking it in small doses, a show at a time every several days vs. blowing through a whole season in a day or two of binge watching. There's an almost claustrophobic quality to the show, each episode but one of which is a psychotherapy session set in the private office of the therapist around which the show revolves. The emotional charge of these exchanges in this relatively tight space, made all the more so by frequent close-ups on the actors, is a testament to the talent of those actors and of the writers of this show, but also lends it that closed-in, quality mentioned above. The most interesting and emotionally true pattern in these episodes is the lengths people will go to create and maintain self-deceiving thinking and behaviors on one hand, then run away from their own truth without looking back when their systems of self-deception collapse. This seems to be the message in ""In Treatment,"" and it is one that's well worth hearing.",1439078400,,1027,4.743016759776537

3108013,5,B0013FSL0C,"I happen to be a clinical psychology doctoral student and get very frustrated how the media incorrectly portrays psychotherapy. This is by far the closest representation of therapy. Now, I should be clear, the therapist in this series, Paul, is very psychodynamic, so please take that into consideration when I say closest representation. This is not a representation of CBT. So, not all psychotherapy appears to be similar to venting. I know a lot of other people who are not in the psychology field who love this show, as my tennis coach was the one who introduced me. It's very interesting and for sure captures some real themes encountered in therapy. For example in this season, transference is a very prominent theme. Also, even though episodes are only 30 minutes, there are over 40 in just this season alone. That is longer than most seasons with hour episodes. The acting is excellent. I found myself getting frustrated with a few of his clients in the sense that it was accurately depicting the issue/disorder. I promise this is not just for psychology nerds like me!

It is amazing, as others have noted, that an hour of psychotherapy is distilled into 30 minutes of very realistic and intense drama, mostly with two characters at a time and mostly in one room. The dramatic irony is off the charts in this series. As a client is speaking to an apparently objective therapist, the therapist registers only slight reactions, but we see through the client as he does. We also see when he slips up and how as a client himself, he falls prey to the same kinds of self-sabotage. We see how difficult it is to face reality. Evidence of exceptional talent is displayed in every episode as eyes and hands do so much of the acting.  Gabriel Byrne is a amazing.

So far, I've watched only the first season, and there are a lot of family dynamics that shape the people in session with this particular psychiatrist. Also we get to see how his issues as a child affect him as an adult as well, so I thought that was an interesting take on things.

3108250,5,B0013FSL0C,"I'm late to the party, having only recently (in 2015) started watching this phenomenal series.  The way in which Gabriel Byrne embodies the character of Paul and allows -- through expression and mannerisms rather than words -- to gain insight into the complexities of human relationships and communication is stunning.  There are phenomenal acting performances all around, but Diane Wiest and the young actress who played Sophie were two stand-outs for me.

I am not in the profession, but have participated in counseling so I do feel that the process is accurately represented here even if the specific situations are foreign to me.  There aren't many TV shows that mine the territory of the human mind in this way.  Tension in most movies/shows is usually marked by violence, or acts of intentional destruction.  Or the impending threat of something bad happening.  Here it's more of a ""slow burn"" as you watch Paul de-construct his clients' thoughts and reactions, then volleys interpretations and questions back to them.

Watching this process is illuminating for the audience.  More than one episode has made me think, ""Hmmm.  How often do I put situations in someone else's hands and push them to make a decision so I don't have to be accountable?""  Particularly with Alex, you see the games people play to control situations and other people (i.e. the coffee machine) -- some of which may be charming or even flirtatious, but manipulative nonetheless.

There are troublesome elements here as well, such as the flaws Paul displays in his own life -- although they are strikingly real and I can understand why his wife comes to loathe him.  It's been well-established (and I agree) that Gabriel Byrne/Paul is a handsome man -- and I think it's relevant to the story (particularly in his relationship with Laura).  Selfishly, I do enjoy watching him night after night because he is do darn handsome.  Still, I had to suspend disbelief a bit much to accept that all his clients could be so physically attractive.  I realize this is TV after all, but it would have been interesting to see a few more ""average blokes.""",1436918400,,2119,4.910112359550562

3108311,5,B0013FSL0C,This was a very real depiction of therapy.  It addressed the fundamental problem of not being able to fix things---but only teaching the tools to be able to fix the problem yourself.  Transference is a such a big part of therapy and it was dealt with honestly.  Gabriel's relationships with the woman in his life is unsettling as well as his own difficulty with self refection.  One only hopes that their therapist has successfully learned the skills needed to deal with their own demons.,1436400000,,488,4.773809523809524

It really wasn't necessary for the story lines & showed a lack of respect for the doctor, who later on used it himself.  It's a shame they have to express themselves using offensive language, as If they don't have better words in their vocabularies to describe their feelings.

3108664,5,B0013FSL0C,"Top notch.

Actors, writers, multi award winner. Authentic depiction of how a good therapist works and the toll his work takes on him and his life. A therapist is a human being who has taken years to develop his/her skills and to learn the meaning of confidentiality and client centered orientation.

Being human, Dr. Paul Weston wrestles with his own role as a person whom troubled people come to have their problems ""fixed."" He must help the patient understand that he can't fix anything. They must confront their own demons and make hard decisions as he gently and wisely gives them guidance. There must be a separation  a line that must not be crossed  between therapist and patient. Paul comes close to that line and briefly crosses it with a patient. We eavesdroppers come  as a result of great acting  to feel his emotions and his struggle to put this aside and think of what his patient's need, even as his own private life faces a crisis.

My primary career was as a physicist. Concurrent with my work in physics, I earned an advanced degree in counseling psychology. I practiced counseling for 10 years.

During my training, I had a few chances to sit behind a one-way window and observe a session. From playing the role of eavesdropper (viewer) to this process, I was able to observe other therapists working with diverse patients. I found that not all therapists have the same ways of approaching their clients. This is where the therapist's own background comes into play. ""In Treatment"" shows how one very skilled therapist has to face his own demons to be as helpful as possible. for his patients.

I wish I could have seen ""In Treatment"" years ago. It provides the one-way window that I had so few during my own training. If you are interested in watching a skillfully portrayed therapist through the one-way window that this HBO series provides, go for it.

 I am reviewing season 1, but have binge watched all 3 seasons and can attest to their quality
There are only a few top notch series available in reruns and this one deserves a place at the top. I highly recommend it.

3108797,3,B0013FSL0C,"There is altogether too much use of the F word in this show.  It adds nothing to the dialog and demeans the characters (much as it does in real life).  Other than that, the show has some characters in the role of patient that are quite compelling.  I particularly liked the story of a young teen who comes in looking for an affidavit that she is reasonably stable and not trying to end her own life.  The process of getting her to see herself accurately was exceptionally well wrought.

The other characters in the first season are not nearly as sympathetic and thus, far less watchable.  Unfortunately, the writers also decide to put the therapist's life into a tailspin.  The construct (while interesting at first glance) fails to enhance the story line.  Thus, the general premise is interesting, but flawed.  When it works, it is remarkable.  When it does not... it simply collapses under its own weight.",1432944000,,908,4.726114649681529

All the episodes are excellent, particularly in the first two years but the ones involving Sophie (Mia) in the first year are something very special. This time I began by watching all of Mia's episodes, one after the other; and it is still as powerful as ever. Gabriel Byrne deserves special mention because without his understated portrayal the episodes could easily have fallen apart. Melissa George and Alison Pill, who was wonderful as Zelda Fitzgerald in ""Midnight in Paris,"" also deserve special mention. Why is it that the women seemed to stand out over the men? I have no idea, but they certainly did, and this includes Diane Wiest who was Byrne's shrink. The other night, I watched one of Mia's most recent films, ""Tracks,"" a true story about a woman hiking through the Outback with four camels. It richly convinces you that Mia's performance in ""In Treatment"" was just the beginning.",1432857600,,1069,4.815217391304348

3108831,5,B0013FSL0C,"First of all, I have to confess that this review was pretty much provoked by reading the rather insignificant amount of ""negative"" comments regarding such a wonderful piece of television.

The arguments I read were mostly circling around two trains of thought:
1) ""I couldn't even get through the first ___ minutes. Oh my God, where is the action in this thing, it can't get any more boring than this...""
2) ""Oh, it is such a clich. Me, as therapist, would do something entirely different...and blah blah...""

Please don't pay any attention to such arguments. Well, let me get a little bit more precise: If your inner dialogue is as vast as a McDonald's commercial, please refrain yourself to even TRY this series. You WILL get bored. You WON'T feel any sort of empathy with any of the characters, either. And, given the fact you DON'T really have any conversations with yourself, please LIBERATE US from your excuses regarding that very subject.

This show is just AMAZING. Any way you'd like to interpret it, deception is simply impossible. Now, this is no ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Bold and Restless"" kind of sh! t. It will take you at least ONE FULL SEASON to engage with the characters (particularly if you've never been committed to REAL therapy yourself). NEWSFLASH: The very REASON you won't feel committed to such characters is ALSO part of the storyline. Because, you know, PATIENTS NORMALLY QUIT. Resistance is a HUGE issue regarding therapy, of course. And ACTUALLY TELLING THE TRUTH to your therapist (or yourself, for that matter) takes a great deal of trial and error.

(SPOILER ALERT)
If you FALL for the OBVIOUS plotline about Gabriel Byrne (SPOILER ALERT) feeling ATTRACTED by one of his patients, you will probably need a whole new scale to measure your stupidity. Having SEXUAL transferences with a therapist is just as NORMAL as it is PREDICTABLE. Therapy success is actually pretty much tied to those who can OVERCOME such SILLY ideas and meet themselves face to face. The remaining excuses (such as: ""oh, that was too deep"" or ""ooh, that was too boring"") are just irrelevant and dumb.

Inner dialogue's a witch. Really. But lacking such a thing is pretty much unthinkable to many of the human beings I've known. Anyhow, detractors of this show haven't even given more than 30 minutes to the entire storyline and its storytellers to develop and/or engage you. That, people, is usually THIER fault.

As your attorney, I advise you to WATCH A FULL SEASON before even considering writing a review. Stupid or not, positive or negative. Matter of fact is that character in this show are so DAMN real, it takes them a whole new season to APPROVE therapy in their lives. And that is just the beginning. Gabriel Byrne is superb. And so are their supporting actors as well.",1432425600,,2782,4.809623430962343

The lines start to blur between helping his patients and letting his feelings about them color his judgement. Every episode you can watch him work brilliantly to help his patients and see him cross ethical and professional boundaries as he reacts to the challenges his patients bring: a young woman in love with him, a couple who wants him to pick sides, a hostile Navy airman, and a gymnast who isn't honest about whether she tried to kill herself. Every week includes a session with his supervisor, Gina, nicely played by Diane Wiest, with whom Paul has a conflictual relationship, as he reluctantly starts seeing her, realizing he needs help but not ready to to make any changes yet. Paul's marriage is falling apart and he is middle aged, finding him at the top of his game as a psychotherapist while he loses touch with his family and becomes estranged from his better instincts. Every episode is well-paced and relies on the drama of the interpersonal relationships and the tension of what is said and not said. Well worth the time.",1431302400,2,1163,4.791044776119403

The quality and intensity of the acting is amazing. Watching these therapy sessions is like watching a slow motion train wreck. Byrne's character is humanized by revealing his human shortcomings and his struggle to maintain professional standards and his all too human reactions to his patients, which he must control.

My only problem is that these episodes are a few years old and Amazon Prime expects paid customers to pay for seasons 2 and 3. At least season 1 has over three and a half dozen episodes. But, come on Amazon!!

Also, his clients all seem to direct their anger and frustration at Paul. Surely, not all clients are that antagonistic toward their counselors. It is a clever concept that each episode is a treatment session, but it would be easier to watch if Paul wasn't the target of his clients' anger quite as much. Overall, I like it, but I don't love it.",1430006400,,490,4.433333333333334
3108902,5,B0013FSL0C,"Intense... yet very interesting. I enjoyed the ability of both the patient and and the doctor to say whatever was on their mind without the world falling apart like it would be in a family situation.  So truths are shared and looked at honestly.  The doctor had such patience with his patients but not with his wife, so his own marriage was falling apart.  He and his wife went to therapy and that was helpful to them, although the change in the doctor's attitude toward his wife, and hers toward her husband seemed almost unbelievably non negotiable.
 Since I was witnessing what he was going through, minute by minute, I had a lot of compassion for him and wished that his wife would be able to soothe him. It reminded me of the joke about the shoemakers kids who had holes in their shoes.  In life a marriage partner should be treated like a friend but most people find this hard to do and, unfortunately, let hurts overtake the focus of their life.  He had no patience or affection for his wife and that was sad.
A marriage needs to be nourished and it distressed me that his marriage was on the rocks.  There were many episodes to watch, and I, as a viewer, felt that I was in the room during the therapy sessions.  I did not like the sexy young female patient that the therapist fell in love with. There were ethical and moral concerns and his humanity and values were a struggle for him ... and I won't tell you the ending.  See the movie.",1430006400,,1446,4.365671641791045

3108921,5,B0013FSL0C,"Wonderfully realistic series of psychoanalytic sessions focusing on about four patients and psychologist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) who might be a little too good for the real world, but his insights as well as his foibles make him an endearing character. Patients typically come for a problem that they have externalized from themselves, so they are in effect dodging the issue and often become defensive as Dr Weston guides them skillfully toward seeing the true interior nature of their problem, at which point they enjoy some psychic relief. Transference proves to be a common problem in the therapeutic process, and <i>In Treatment</i> derives drama and conflict from transference as the attractive, paternal shrink struggles to deal with the patient's affections.",1429401600,,770,5.425

3108936,2,B0013FSL0C,"I appear to be in the minority on this one.  This truly is an ambitious project with incomparable talent, but for this viewer, very little rings true -- especially the dialogue, which is stilted, illogical at times, and overly dramatic..The script seems better suited to theatre where the actors could have emoted to the rafters while rending their garments and beating their breasts to great effect.  I blame the writers -- each entirely responsible for his/her ""patient's""  episodes.  (Which may explain why Byrne's character sometimes seems to lack continuity from patient to patient.)  They should have done their homework about what truly goes behind those closed doors.  (And Laura a doctor?  Seriously?  The writers could have fooled me.)  Melissa George's performance, sadly, was close to amateurish, as if she skipped rehearsals and just showed up for filming.

When push came to shove, I simply didn't care about any of the characters, and actually was repelled more often than not.

Dianne Wiest gets 5 stars, and her true-to-life performance is the only reason this viewer stayed with it long after losing interest.  Still, it wasn't enough to enable me to see it through to the end.",1429228800,,1195,5.0717948717948715

3108938,5,B0013FSL0C,"An intriguing psychological drama. Good writing, and strong performances by supporting cast. But in my opinion Gabriel Byrne gives an absolutely outstanding performance as a therapist struggling to treat his own patients, all while confronting his marital and family problems, and seeking (and not always accepting) advice and a constructive dialogue with his former mentor. Byrne's impressive acting ability is showcased in this powerful drama. He creates a character who is intelligent, thoughtful and truly loves analyzing and helping his patients. But at the same time, he struggles with his own marriage and other personal issues, and at times has difficulty seeing in his own personal life things he finds obvious while counseling others. If you want lots of action, this show is not for you. But the interractions of the characters with Byrne's character and all the dynamics that take place make for an addictive experience.",1429228800,,932,5.346938775510204

What I am not enjoying is this tortured soul/god-complex this therapist seems to be suffering from. Its a contradiction and gets a little old. His temper tantrums get old. But then, we humans are multi-faceted and complex.

3109007,5,B0013FSL0C,"I was completely hooked on this series after the first episode and had to limit myself to one ""week"" of treatments per evening and to take a break from In Treatment every couple of days. This show will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea.  If you don't enjoy thinking,  if you are not interested in how people's minds work - how frustrating and complicated people and their relationships are you will be bored or confused by what happens to the characters.  My first thought was that it must be terrible to be a psychotherapist.  What Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) goes through with his patients is traumatic for everyone involved.  Then you get to see Paul Weston with his therapist.  What an incredibly clever idea for a drama!  The acting is superb.  You feel for these characters.  Many times you dislike them or want to bang their heads together. Sometimes it is difficult to watch. But you find yourself rooting for them to find their way. If you like a lot of physical action you won't find it here.  About 4/5 of the show takes place in one room and the room itself almost becomes one of the characters.  The plot, like life, is completely unpredictable and there were no happily ever afters. Just, if lucky, another chance to try again tomorrow.",1427328000,2,1256,4.612612612612613

3109013,2,B0013FSL0C,I had high hopes but was disappointed with the first 30 minutes of the first episode and couldn't force myself to keep watching. Seems like a reality show in terms of watching someone going through therapy but with an actor (Byrne) as the Psychiatrist.,1427328000,,252,4.75

3109017,5,B0013FSL0C,Most original concept for a narrative.  Complex central character. Well acted all around.  I found the structure around patient visits coupled with Gabe's ongoing inner struggles more than enough to keep me watching.,1427328000,,216,5.515151515151516
3109018,5,B0013FSL0C,""" In Treatment"" is the very best series I have ever watched. To begin with it breaks the main rule of television by displaying a series that is all conversation and body language on a medium that is built for action and motion.
The writing is superb. It is engaging and involves the viewer in the lives of the characters to an extent that the viewer feels the he or she is a third party to the discussions between patient and psychologist.
Also, the brevity of each episode is perfect in that it ends in that ideal time between wanting more and getting too much.
Most highly recommended.

3109019,5,B0013FSL0C,"I saw this when it was originally broadcast and loved it then.  In viewing it again, the performances are so nuanced and the story line even richer than I remember.  Gabriel Byrne received an Emmy nomination for his performance, which was well deserved. Others in the very tight and highly talented cast, have continued to give stellar performances as they have moved to other projects.  It's really rare for HBO to not hit a home run, and this fits right in.

The pilot in the second episode is so irritating I wanted to punch in the TV screen.  If I'd been the analyst I would have told him that he was in the military and as an officer and a pilot should be setting an example for the others in his unit, so suck it up and get out of my office!  I wouldn't have even accepted him as a patient!  If these episodes are based on real therapy sessions I don't know how any therapist has the patience to put up with these whiners.  The show's concept is original and somewhat interesting, but the characters, aside from the therapist, are so annoying I would say that this show is an acquired taste.",1426982400,,813,4.2745098039215685

3109068,4,B0013FSL0C,"I'm only 75% of the way through season 1, but so far I have to say that the acting is top-notch across the board. The series is light on action, and heavy on dialogue, as it is set in a psychiatrists' office, and doesn't use flashbacks to show the episodes the patients discuss. So, although they are given high quality scripts to work with, most of the responsibility of creating the drama falls to the actors. Their delivery of the dialogue is great, but, for me, the best acting takes place in the silences between the words. In some ways, such as the minimal set changes, and the compactness of the space used, this series seems like it would be better suited to the stage, but it is in those silences that it takes advantage of the cameras ability to pick up amazingly subtle changes in facial expressions that are the essence of acting. So why only 4 stars? Sometimes it's so emotionally intimate, that it's almost uncomfortable to watch, which may be less of a critique, and more of an indication that I need to come to terms with my own voyeuristic tendencies. I'll have to ask my therapist.",1426377600,,1099,4.5

I keep wishing to see the characters just talk normally and do normal daily things after their therapy sessions.  So maybe the fault there is my own expectations.  But it would be interesting to see the characters act differently or become more functional somehow in the other parts of their lives, say, after having some kind of insight or breakthrough in a session.

3109119,5,B0013FSL0C,"The acting in In Treatment is superb!  The passion between the characters played by Gabriel Byrne and Melissa George is palpable, especially in the episode after she quits therapy but returns a couple weeks later.  In Treatment is intense acting as the scenes are relatively long and demanding.  Gabriel Byrne actually liked appearing in the Viking series because he knew his character would only last so long.  In Treatment features some of the best acting I have ever witnessed.",1425686400,,480,5.037974683544304

I've always like Gabriel Byrne. He handles his roll well. Sometimes I think he asks too many questions, but this is a TV series, not real life events. The producers and writers have to keep things moving. The patients/characters are whacked, but very much in a believable way. So far they've all portrayed their characters beautifully.

I did not like the character of Laura, so I suppose the actress did her job.  Sophie was the best in terms of progression.  The sessions with Gabriel Byrne's and his therapist were very good.  I was not pleased that seasons two/three were not included in Prime.  I will either be patient until they are included or not watch them at all.",1425081600,,494,4.50561797752809

The acting of the patients is particularly good but it does tend to bog down at times and the therapist does not look too sure of himself to me a lot of the time and takes a lot of crap from his patients.  I am only partially through season one and it may well be I move this down a star of so as i go along.  Oh well try and see if you enjoy.

Alex's father suffocated his own father in the mid-1950s so that would have made him at least age 20 or older when it occurred. With that said, his dad would have been born in the mid-1930's (or earlier), and would be age 80 years or older.

It appears he's working harder than his clients and he's getting way to personally involved. It would be great to look at his actions and compare them to our own - how we get mad at the people who are trying to help us.

3109222,2,B0013FSL0C,"This is a pretty good series, but the really boring thing about it is how sessions nearly always get around to wild sex. Naturally, this is baloney, but some of the other things about the show are a bit much. Any shrink that attacks a patient should lose their license or be put in jail. This is very unrealistic as it is just passed by. Next, the show certainly gives the message that any & all teenagers are rutting like dogs in heat with anyone they can. Not very realistic either. Some of the  sessions get pretty tedious & boring, but such is analysis. I'd say it is a fairly good series, but not that realistic. I've seen shrinks since I was a little kid as my late mom was seriously bi-polar. All of the sex crap in these supposed sessions never came up w/ us. Not a word about it. The various shrinks never attacked us either. Anyway, I'd give it about a C grade. The most interesting sessions are w/ the nutty teenage gal that is trying out for the Olympics for gymnastics. Naturally, she hopped in the sack w/ her coach too. This gets pretty boring after awhile.",1421712000,2,1072,4.333333333333333

3109225,3,B0013FSL0C,"If you're interested in Psychology or Sociology you might like this. However, it's a quiet talk-y show, no action.
  I'm almost done w/Season 1 - watching it on a friend's Prime account. This is an interesting show. It was slow going for me and I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue. I hated the first and second episodes because ""Laura"" is all useless drama and ""Alex"" in the second episode made me want to punch him. But then the show started getting interesting and now I'm almost done.
  Excellent performances!! The acting in this show is STELLAR.
  This is a slow burner of a show, but if you're interested human behavior it will hold your attention. You're going to hate some of the characters and relate to others. I bet if you're honest with yourself you could find a little bit (or a lot a bit) of yourself in each character, including Paul, the therapist. I hated Alex... omg I many times I wanted to skip over his episodes - what a toxic character!! I started to chill out about him really late in the season, in week six, when he started getting real and being honest for once. Didn't have much interest in the couple (although I love Josh Charles (from The Good Wife)) mostly because their relationship is awful and unproductive and totally childish, I just had such little patience for them, but the episodes are only 30 mins so I watched their sessions anyway. I could relate with a lot of ""Laura""'s feelings about herself in relationships and a lot of what she said resonated with me.
  But ""Sophie"" was really the character I felt a complete affinity for as she reminds me so much of myself in so many ways - I got very invested in her, completely felt her pain and totally understood her reactions to things, it was like looking in a mirror. The actress Mia Wasikowski and the writers of the show did an amazing and frighteningly accurate job writing for the ""Sophie"" character and Mia delivered a very touching, honest performance. I think it was ""Sophie's"" story that kept me watching this show.
  I've never been in therapy before, although should have been during many crucial times in my life but somehow made it out without it. I tried 2 different therapists in the past but couldn't trust strangers so I quit. So, I'm unfamiliar with the process and certainly not one to judge ""Paul""'s process, or approach, but I felt like there were some holes in how he handled things. He didn't establish boundaries with his patients, especially the ""Alex"" character, and I felt he should have terminated that relationship as soon as Alex started invading his privacy and becoming belligerent and antagonizing. Plus, how do therapists sit there all day listening to people's self absorption, petty dramas, narcissism and egos? I suppose that's par for the course to get to the root of their pain and suffering.
  This show held my interest enough to watch the second season when I'm finished w/season 1.",1421280000,,2916,4.651750972762646

3109227,4,B0013FSL0C,This series for me started kind of slow.  It is well acted but the down side of this series is that only the first season is free with Amazon Prime.  Why?  This is not a new show.  I'm not interested enough to pay for all the episodes,1421020800,,234,3.9148936170212765

3109229,2,B0013FSL0C,It became more and more interesting as the characters were developed but then we noticed a trend that the Lords name was being used in vain more and more frequently.  We stopped watching as it became rather offensive.  Not sure why movie and TV producers feel it necessary to result to such language.

3109243,4,B0013FSL0C,"I've watched the first 10 episodes.  It's an original series and the actors are first rate (interesting choices by the way). The 1/2 hour format works well here.  It's an absorbing series: you are introduced to several characters with varied problems (fighter pilot, teenage Olympic-hopeful gymnast, couple-in-crisis) who are deeply in denial about what the real problem is and their contributions to the problem(s). Byrne's performance is on point, believable, and his therapeutic responses to these clients ring true.  That being said, there is a reluctance on my part to watch more episodes because I don't really like any of the characters. They're all angry, selfish, and self-absorbed (of course that's often the hallmark of people who are in crisis and turn to therapy), and Byrne is downright nasty and ugly in his interactions with his ""mentor"", Diana Wiest.  It says something, however that I've written this much about the show so, now I feel obligated to watch a few more episodes to see if some of the characters resolve their issues and become better people as a result. 8-)",1420243200,2,1088,5.027777777777778

3109261,5,B0013FSL0C,"I watched only the episodes with Alex. I found the acting to be intense. Gabriel Byrne does an excellent job with his character refraining from giving direction to Drew Bledsoe. Bledsoe plays Alex to perfection. Totally in denial about having any problems for all of the episodes, he dodges all of Byrnes' attempts to get him to face a real issue. He is living his life on the edge. He is not the least bit centered, but he thinks that he is totally in control until near the final episode. However, his emotions and tears cannot overcome his need to be perfectly in control. The final episode brings the whole of Alex together. Let me say no more.",1419897600,,648,4.5

3109316,4,B0013FSL0C,"This was a fantastic character driven show. Unusual to have only two people in a half an hour show this cast pulled it off beautifully. I have one complaint, I don't appreciate having Amazon Prime hustle me into making me pay for the next season's. Netflix does not do that which is why I will never leave them. Amazon Prime is on a one year trial for me before I consider renewing. If this happens a lot I will not renew. To me they already have my money for the subscription. Don't charge me for more.",1419120000,,503,4.25

to some of the issues presented so it is very thought provoking. After watching each episode as it is presented, I went through again
watching each session of one particular patient from week one of therapy through to their last session. The continuity was helpful.

Thoughtful, compelling, mature, insightful windows into the complex/ troubled worlds of some very interesting personalities. The only (minor) negative: in two or three episodes in which the lead character is joined by his wife in a session with another analyst, he behaves uncharacteristically and insipidly clueless about how to deal with his wife's infidelity. Yes, I know that the intent is to demonstrate that no matter how well we might understand other's problems, we are all prone to being ignorant about our own issues. However, in these sessions, that message could have been conveyed very effectively in more subtle ways.",1418860800,,729,5.3478260869565215

Gabriel Byrne's accent, which drifts from American (sort of) to something indescribable to his more natural Irish (which he should have stuck with) is distracting but he's a good actor, that aside.  The actress playing the gymnast is fabulous, and Gina--the therapist Byrne goes to--is fantastic.  So, I'm a big fan.",1418256000,,466,5.092105263157895

3109419,5,B0013FSL0C,"A very different kind of TV show. Viewing it is very much like observing a real series of therapy sessions with a very good analyst. Even the length of the sessions is realistic. The problems of the patients may be a bit extreme, but perhaps not. The sessions of the analyst with his ""retired"" supervisor were quite well done and believable as well.

There is much value here that anyone can benefit from, even if none of the situations these patients find themselves in is directly applicable.  It is the process of analysis that is valuable, much food for thought!

Some of the language is a bit hard to take, but in a therapy session you are free to say anything you like, I guess it's just part of the realism.",1416614400,,714,4.435114503816794

3109432,4,B0013FSL0C,"Only saw season 1.  Great series with high quality acting that really simulates therapy sessions but the behind-the-scenes enactments of the therapist's life and his own relationship makes it feel like a) he is very troubled, too troubled almost to be helping people;  b) it's good to see his human side, but his ethical boundaries are not as strong as they should be;  c) all of this is done to sensationalize and dramatize the show which breaks you away from losing yourself in the reality of it;  d) the obligatory HBO sex is there but almost all of it comes out only in verbal description which made me happy;  e) I'm still trying to understand how he could fall in love with the person that he fell in love with---it really makes him look self-unaware and ""immature;"" as does e) the types of squabbles he has with his own therapist.

I suspend disbelief, and accept that he is a troubled man and still really like the show, particularly Gabriel Byrne and Diane Wiest.  Glad to see that Season 1 is free with membership in Amazon Prime---hope that they add more seasons instead of charging for them.",1416355200,,1103,4.596938775510204

I found the characters believable and distinct from each other. However, at times, I felt as impatient as the characters with the lack of progress they had made in actually changing their actions.

This is rather cerebral entertainment. If you enjoy salacious sex scenes, violence and the adrenaline rush of action scenes, this series will probably not interest you. If you are interested in human motivations, triumph over heart-rending experiences, and human failures, you may enjoy this series. I repeat, the acting is wonderful!

3109525,4,B0013FSL0C,"This program is very much like being a fly on the wall of a session between a therapist and patient. That is what is good about it and that is what is bad about it. The Doctor is fascinating because he seems utterly incapable of seeing flaws in himself. The patients are annoying, but very true to real patients in a therapy session (from what I know). Almost all of the patients resent paying a professional to listen to their worst fears and personal problems, but that is what makes it interesting to watch, and (to add another conjuntion) it is exactly what makes this program fascinating. Many episodes are worth skipping, but in season one the girl playing the young gymnasts really shines. I deplored the acting from most of the adult actors. The doctor and HIS therapist are some of the most interesting of the adult only sessions. I am irritated beyond description at Amazon's decision to make only the first season free on prime - I suppose I'll be driven to Hulu, or youtube or any myriad of fee t.v. sources to get the season 2 and 3 for free.",1413849600,,1055,4.471502590673575

His own issues play out with each of the patients, usually for better but sometimes for worse. Don't let my title suggest that one should view this as an example of ""how to do psychotherapy."" Definitely NOT. Nevertheless, it still can illuminate how therapy is different from other types of relationships and social interactions. But, to get maximum appreciation of that, unless you actually are a psychotherapist, it would be heuristic to read some classics, such as Sullivan's The Psychiatric Interview or almost anything of Freud, or Erickson or Erikson (Milton or Erik) while following this and subsequent seasons, if you are not familiar with orthodox and ""proper"" therapist behavior. There's probably a wikipedia article on it, too, but some therapy classics are worth reading on their own. That way so you will catch the ""story"" part of this - the deviations - as distinguished from the ""reality"" aspect. The supervisor, Dianne Wiest, also fits into the complex psychological structure, differently from the way the patients do, and gives an additional insight into the struggles Paul faces both as person and as doctor. If you don't have (or take my suggestion to get) an educated perspective on therapy and supervision, it still makes a good story, but you're missing an opportunity to learn something about one of the key paradigms of our times.",1412121600,,1465,5.108333333333333

During the course of a season, you'll meet his patients, come to love them or hate them, and see some kind of resolution of their problems.  In doing that, you'll learn a lot about them, Paul, as well as yourself.

You won't like everyone you meet here, but you will absolutely love Paul.  And he's smarter than you may give him credit for.  Just watch and learn.",1411430400,,586,4.429906542056075

I was so totally impressed by a young girl playng the part of a young gymnast who at (I think 14 or 15) had a sexual relationship with her coach and also an eating disorder plus suicidal tendencies. Just thinking how difficult it would be for a young actor to ""Act"" this role with such complete authenticity. Such difficult, confusing, dark and painful material and this young actor just NAILS IT. There are even scenes where no words are spoken but we just see her face as she listens to very challenging truths from her therapist and we get to see her emotions flash across her face, even with just her eyes alone. To have such awareness of self and skills at such a young age to control the look of ones eyes to convey a point in a script ..... Truly brilliant acting. The other patients are equally convincing I think I praise the young female actor most not because she was better but because she is so young. One at least hopes, she has not had the years to have experienced such complex and painful emotions which makes her ability to ""Act"" them so accurately just that much more impressive.. This show (while often dark and difficult material) is some of the best acting I think I have seen. Incredibly difficult material rendered perfectly.",1409443200,,1347,4.570247933884297

3109737,5,B0013FSL0C,"This show is an amazing accomplishment, and could be useful as a highly dramatized educational tool.

Most of the time when a character on a TV show visits the psychologist's office, it's to serve some arbitrary character development, usually to showcase some kind of weakness.  The thing I adore about ""In Treatment"" is its grounded approach.  Instead of offering up advice and a pity party, we see patient-led psychology sessions, which tends to be how these things go in real life.

Certainly, it's a drama -- meant to keep a viewer interested -- but if you're willing to buy into the premise, this show never breaks your trust.  I always found it grounded and believable.  There's been much discussion on whether the characters are ""likable"" or not, but I find that I don't care about that so much for this series.  The drama is involving and if you're trying to tell me that there aren't people out there who act just like this cast of patients do, you don't know people.  Sometimes characters are aggravating, just as they are in real life, but half of the drama is the way in which Gabriel Byrne's character handles it all.

I hate to throw around the word ""intelligent,"" because people will say that about any show they like that they view as under-rated.  I don't use it to describe most TV programs, because understanding a TV program -- even with an ensemble cast like Game of Thrones -- is never about intelligence, but passion.  Anyone can understand it on some level.  To that end, I maintain that anyone can understand this show on some level, but I would like to use the word ""intelligent"" in how it is all written, because of its grounded approach.  Lots of care went into the making of this program, and it absolutely earns my highest recommendation.",1409184000,2,1768,4.664516129032258

About 1/2 way thru the season the therapists' life starts to unravel so he then starts to see a therapist too.

3109801,5,B0013FSL0C,"I cannot imagine how I missed this incredible series when it was on TV!  Having spent my career in the field of psychology, I can attest that this series comes the closest of any out there to honestly replicating the ""process"" as it unfolds within the secure walls of the therapist's office.  Not only that, but the acting is so superb that the patients and therapists seem totally real; one might think the series is more a documentary than a fabricated drama.  Each patient is developed carefully and provided with a script that is sometimes painfully real and always stunningly articulate.  The same is true of the therapists.  This shows how deluded we all can be, and how often we project our delusions on to those we meet as well as the world at large.",1408060800,,758,4.5851851851851855

Yes, the kind of therapy they do here is endangered and may become extinct. But this episode captures the philosophy and the conundrums and the potential of psychologists and psychotherapy in 30 minutes better than anything else I can imagine. And it leaves the usual squabbles about theoretical orientation, ethics, and porfessional politics in the dust. This is what happens when very good psychologists deal with real issues in real ways.

Apart from the once a week marriage guidance sessions the dramatic drive is carried by just two persons in very intense interactions between patient and therapist, or therapist and wife and two of his children. And even the marriage guidance is often just one on one.

The young Australian actress Wasikowska steals the entire first series with a career- making ensemble performance of great intensity, authenticity and brilliant portrayal. Also very clever is inclusion of the doctor's own weekly therapy/counseling sessions with his former mentor, as his own doubts and conflicts are exposed. And his own self deception, as we see both the event he is characterizing and his miss-characterization of the event to his former mentor.

Brilliant.

The characters were very well written, the acting was incredible, and the show never stooped down to the level of stupidity most writers assume their audience to have.

I find it intriguing, but I reserve that final star because I do feel as though there are too many sexual references, and I am not really impressed by that particular method of attracting viewers.  There could be the intimacy and the intrigue without the sexual details and it would be far more cerebral and less erotic.  That would make it a five star program, in my opinion.  It is truly interesting that the therapist seems to have quite limited insight into his own miseries, and yet seems adequate in understanding his clients.",1406160000,,606,4.688679245283019

3109941,4,B0013FSL0C,I was a little captivated with this series. A little different than moist shows you see these days. Very good acting. The only thing that upset me was as a Prime member I anxiously went to Season 2 and you have to pay to watch. At 32 shows or more a season can't afford that. Maybe I'll get a gift card or something but til then I'll have to stay in suspense as to what happens.,1405814400,,378,3.986842105263158

You don't see each character every week you see them every 2-3 weeks because that is how thearpy works. Now I can skip the episodes of the characters who i don't find compelling and and continue with the ones i do at a faster pace. season one is 42 episodes.

(another major point for Amazon prime just when we thought it had reached a plateau)  In treatment is an interesting prospective with some incredible acting (for most of the season). But, just when say to yourself Amazon rocks!! you start season two and you are reminded that everyone is trying to get us use to a pay per episode model (the old Apple store model that has come to a halt-Has Hollywood not learned form the music industry model-its not working...). I can see some of us wanting to pay for a season of a show that we absolutely loved and want to keep a copy in our every growing digital garage. Most of us loathe cable companies and will gladly pay Amazon for access to this content. But,  at least this family is not likely to dish out a per episode charge.

I found myself needing to take breaks before returning for more of the sad and miserable lives of these people.  I felt that the acting was superb, especially by Blair Underwood and Melissa George from season one (the only season I have watched).  I was intrigued by the length and fluidity through which scenes played out with flawless editing to the eye.

3109976,4,B0013FSL0C,"A quiet, but fascinating series that chronicles the therapy sessions of several patients, including the doctor himself. Each day of the week is devoted to a single session, so the series enacts a typical week for therapist, Dr. Paul Weston (played with patience and occasional tense rancor by Gabriel Byrne). Each Friday is dedicated to Weston's own therapy with his former mentor, Dr. Gina Toll (the ever amazing Dianne Wiest). We see him and his patients through their personal struggles, their conflicts with one another, and their epiphanies about their own choices and situations. The acting is sublime and the casting choices are impeccable. My only criticism is that there is something predictable about the show and its pacing. I haven't seen beyond this first season, but it's fairly easy to predict how each character will react to Weston's theories about his or her problems. Every character at one time or another questions Weston's abilities as a therapist, and he is quick to lobby such criticism at Toll, as well. I assume it's typical for patients to resist the therapist's assessments, especially if they feel vulnerable, or see his remarks as less-than-flattering, so this is meant to add to the show's authenticity. This is a small criticism for a show that is otherwise intelligent, brilliantly conceived, and well acted. I highly recommend it. I only wish the other two seasons were available through Amazon Prime, as this will very likely deter me from watching the entire series.",1405123200,,1502,5.08502024291498

3109994,4,B0013FSL0C,This show is like a cliche in that the therapist who helps people heal their problems has myriad problems of his own. The writers added this level of complexity to make it more interesting I guess. But to me the therapist's family troubles are more of a distraction. The patients are thus a little less significant IMHO.,1404691200,,320,4.631578947368421

It is surprising to see how often Paul's patients feel free to attack him and insult him.  I find it riveting, even if a little off on the credibility of everyone's aggressiveness.  Lots of people are angry-- but not all of them all the time-- as depicted here.  Still the acting is wonderful, the dialogue is interesting, and the structure of seeing people in therapy from one week to another is fascinating in seeing them progress (or not) as the case may be.  It is also interesting how the patients interpret their therapist's comments.  And it is also quite fascinating to watch Paul the therapist in sessions with his own therapist/mentor who bear residual resentments and harbor simmering grudges against each other for almost a decade.",1404604800,,914,4.928104575163399

A lot of people don't believe in getting help for their issues and society does not look well on the topic of therapy as they should.  We have seen a lot of what can happen in this world when people feel they are not heard.  I was especially glad to see it released on prime from Amazon.  Even though I own the series, I still enjoy streaming the show so that I don't have to pull out my movies and put them back.  If you haven't seen this series, check it out.

Gabriel Byrne deserves an award @ least an Emmy for his performance as a therapist.  And the winner is.....................................Gabriel Byrne hands down.

I for one, fall asleep in action movies where things blow up for no reason, not kidding I do fall asleep, ask my friends. If you are like me, watch this. As for the professionals who object to Paul's ethics, they are possibly right but who cares? I'd take him over my impersonal, 'll l critically correct therapist .

He's so fine an actor, and writing was great, story lines were wonderful.  There's such a shortage of good programming on that it's a shame.

Thank God that HBO's still running a lot of good shows now; most I consider excellent, like Game of Thrones, for example.  Too bad True Blood ran off the tracks a little bit (was it the Maynad and related??!!), but I will be very, very sorry to see it go.  The most wonderful part about TB was the romance between Sookie and Bill.  Once that was over, or went crazy, the show lost a lot of fans and punch.

Good luck to all involved in your new endeavors.  And Mr. Byrne, please visit Chicago often.  I'd love to bump into you some day!!",1403222400,,850,4.096969696969697

Outstanding acting on the part of the actress who plays 'Laura'.

I am surprised the concept of 'transference' wasn't mentioned since that is common in therapy.

I think the therapist is vulnerable to come-ons from clients; his own marriage appears strained.

As an observant Jew, our tradition cautions against being secluded in an enclosed space with a member of the opposite sex.

I did not watch the conclusion of that case in season 1.

The therapeutic interactions seem authentic and insightful.",1403222400,,595,5.145833333333333
3110074,5,B0013FSL0C,"All the stories are fascinating, especially Paul's, whose tales with Gina often contradict reality.  Loved seeing Josh Charles in this different role.  He was excellent, as were all the actors.  I loved this series when it was broadcast, and I love it all over again.",1403222400,,267,4.888888888888889
3110075,4,B0013FSL0C,"Love this series, especially Gabriel Byrne.  A few of the sequences feel a bit contrived, but the acting is always superb.",1403222400,,122,4.809523809523809
3110076,5,B0013FSL0C,"very well done.  I will watch another season as the characters kept you interested.
I was surprised to see a cast like they had in this show.",1403136000,,141,4.222222222222222
3110077,5,B0013FSL0C,On the most realistic shows i've seen. It really exposes the society we live in. The skills of acting is out standing!,1403136000,,118,4.409090909090909
3110078,4,B0013FSL0C,This was an interesting inside look at psycho therapy. The combination of scenarios kept it interesting enough to compel me to watch all 43 episodes.,1403136000,,149,5.0
3110079,5,B0013FSL0C,I've only started the series but I'm already hooked. Gabriel Byrne is great in this role. Great cast and good story lines.,1403049600,,122,4.590909090909091
3110080,5,B0013FSL0C,Superbly done and quite addictive! So interesting to watch the therapeutic relationship with the client develop as the therapist slowly reveals his own trauma.,1403049600,,159,5.666666666666667
3110081,4,B0013FSL0C,"This show delves into the conscious and subconscious of four patients and one therapist.  Each story individually unravels week by week, as the patients tell us their stories.  The therapist has great insight to his patient's behaviors too.",1402963200,,240,5.2894736842105265
3110082,3,B0013FSL0C,"It was hard to give a star rating to this. I really wanted to like this show, and for the first 11 episodes I hung in there, finding things to like about the various characters. The problem was that I would have expected more progress into the patient's story lines. Instead once the characters are presented and enough information given so I had a good idea what the problems were they were seeking therapy for, they just STAY there, very little forward motion. Became so boring  I quit in the middle of episode 12 after 15 minutes of the episode discussing a coffee maker. Now I know the point was that it wasn't really about a coffeemaker, it was what it represented, but I found myself thinking, ""all right, I get it already, could you move it along now?"" So, 3 stars for the great acting of the characters even though their situations rapidly became static. 1 for the lack of any dynamic development. I'll probably come back and watch more of it, probably some night when I'm having trouble falling asleep. This show should do the trick.",1402963200,2,1042,4.542553191489362
3110083,5,B0013FSL0C,"I started to watch this show one afternoon on a whim, and I got hooked. Each episode deals with a patient's session with the main character, a therapist. I found myself drawn to all of them and how the therapist draws them out as he himself deals with his own demons. Excellent ensemble, good writing.",1402963200,,301,4.490909090909091
3110084,5,B0013FSL0C,This is a very well written show.  Best watched in binges since you don't see the same patient for weeks at a time.,1402963200,,115,4.0
3110085,4,B0013FSL0C,"I've always like Gabriel Byrne, so that's why I wanted to see this series. It's interesting so far, and the episodes are super short (less than 30 min) so it's easy to binge watch. Great acting and interesting story lines so far.",1402963200,,229,4.476190476190476
3110086,3,B0013FSL0C,"I'm going through the first season now on Amazon Prime Streaming. Overall the show is interesting and the acting is reasonable. My problem with it is that it's filled with contrivances and cliches... leaving pills in the bathroom so we can have a suicide attempt scene, the patient falling in love with the therapist, the depressed teenager, the gay-but-in-denial military man, etc. Considering the high rating of the series it seems that I'm one of the few viewers who are actually annoyed by these flaws. Maybe I'm just being a nitpicker. If you're anything like me, I would suggest going in with low expectations and being moderately pleased with the results.",1402963200,,662,4.972972972972973
3110087,4,B0013FSL0C,"I thought I would have to stop watching during the first half of the first show.  I thought each one was going to be one on one and that could be limiting.  HOWEVER, it is well written and because the issues are not solved, resolved, closed etc. in one session...which is real...it really becomes interesting.  I loved Blair Underwood performance...really good.  It brings up timely situations and leaves one thinking about their own take on each situation.  I like it very much.  Leaves you wanting to see the next session for each person....or...if they come back..",1402876800,,567,4.854166666666667
3110088,5,B0013FSL0C,I find this very entertaining and very interesting to get the insight of of the therapist and patient perspectives. Very engaging sessions.,1402876800,,139,5.363636363636363
3110089,5,B0013FSL0C,"Here is another show that I cannot believe that Ive missed until now..and also that it only ran a few seasons. It is truly a wonderful show..so please watch further than the first episode..it may come off kind of dull..but once you adjust to how its written and handled..you really will enjoy it. What brought me here was my love for Josh Charles aka ""Will Gardner"" from The Good Wife..which coincidentally is my #1 favorite and can be see here as well...and so far he is wonderful here. Your heart will hurt for ""little"" Sophie...what a tremendous young actress..and I have even gotten a crush on Paul..the lead played by Gabriel Byrne...or maybe its both! The show is excellent and Im only 1/3 into the first season!!",1402876800,,719,4.669291338582677
3110090,5,B0013FSL0C,Excellent cast. Real life story lines. Complex human intertwined life issues and problems. Evokes discussions with others who view the series with differing points of view expressed. For mature audience. Not light hearted. Deep plots that provoke deep thought not only about the characters but about your life and that of your family and friends. Recommend for those interested in serious at times disturbing real to life with real character actor story lines.,1402790400,,460,5.315068493150685
3110091,5,B0013FSL0C,I loved the way the therapist's  professional ethics become involved and how different counseling theories were demonstrated. It is a great way to show how intense sessions with a client can get and how attached you become with clients. It is also a great instrument to use for people wanting to go into therapy but scared to do so. It takes guts to put yourself outhere in front of another human being and tell them about your hidden self. The freedom of having done so and seek to find you own answers along with a therapist to guide you is invaluable to self understanding. I loved it!,1402704000,,588,4.4953271028037385
3110092,4,B0013FSL0C,"The therapy sessions are great. The added personal life struggles of the physiatrist have a ""Hollywood feel"" and are a bit over the top. But overall, awesome.",1402704000,,158,4.888888888888889

3110095,5,B0013FSL0C,The acting in this series is absolutely magnificent. I can't imagine how they accomplish these most sensitive acting roles. I do love Gabriel and wish he coule be my therapist! Well written and superbly acted.,1402617600,,209,5.0

3110099,5,B0013FSL0C,"We really enjoyed season one. There is so much emotion and depth to the characters, and also a strong romanticism to it without being sexually graphic. That seems so rare in a drama these days. Gabriel Byrne is amazing to watch.",1402617600,,228,4.585365853658536
3110100,1,B0013FSL0C,"I was totally disappointed in this and just didn't want to watch it. This therapist was so unprofessional that I felt sorry for his patients. I know it is a drama and not reality, but I just couldn't see the point.",1402617600,2,214,4.2439024390243905

3110103,5,B0013FSL0C,"This is not a ""fluffy"" - I'll watch it to ''escape for a while"" show. I haven't become so engaged with TV characters in quite some time.  Gabriel Byrne is GREAT! I couldn't wait to get season 2 (which, so far, is all most as good.)",1402617600,,231,4.021739130434782
3110104,5,B0013FSL0C,"I watched this show religiously when it first aired...and was delighted to see it on Amazon Prime so I could get hooked all over again.

First, what's not to love about Gabriel Byrne? Second, to like this show you must be seeking cerebral and emotional stimulation. You will discover what makes different types of people act the way they do, and the answers may surprise you.  Preconceived notions have no place here. Superbly acted and written. Masterfully placed pregnant pauses. You can almost feel the struggles within.

Now put Season 2 and 3 on Prime!",1402617600,,557,4.842105263157895
3110105,4,B0013FSL0C,kept me interested in what next. Variety of clients was a challenge. seeing the therapist's life challenges was also a back story worth seeing,1402531200,,142,4.958333333333333
3110106,4,B0013FSL0C,The Therapist seem realistic with appropriate affect and ethics. Some patients seem somewhat over dramatic I thought but a good start of this series.,1402531200,,149,5.25

3110112,5,B0013FSL0C,I love this series.  Gabriel Byrne is showing such a vulnerable side of himself and Diane Weist is to die for.  Great series,1402358400,,124,4.3478260869565215
3110113,4,B0013FSL0C,Very good story lines. Nice pace stories. Not for the depressed person.  But features a very sexy Blair Underwood. Who can resist such an unquenchable temptation?,1402358400,,162,5.230769230769231
3110114,5,B0013FSL0C,We love In Treatment and wish the program had continued. The acting is wonderful and the story lines really get you involved...often there are answers to problems you see in your own family/friends.,1402358400,,198,5.03030303030303
3110115,3,B0013FSL0C,"It's a bit hard to get into the characters at first; once I did I couldn't get into all of them, but the story lines I did get into were interesting....you have to be into psychology though...this show isn't for everyone.",1402358400,,221,4.414634146341464

3110117,4,B0013FSL0C,"This shows concept is so beautifully simple, and, when combined with a brilliant, witty, realistic script and great acting, is almost irresistible.

3110118,5,B0013FSL0C,"I'm not a fan of action adventure movies, so the dialogue-heavy nature of this series is something I found entertaining and interesting.  The writing is excellent as are all the performances. The viewer is present week after week as Paul, the psychiatrist, meets with his patients. There's little action beyond someone walking around in a room, the same room where the therapy session is, but multiple storylines emerge.",1402272000,,420,5.176470588235294

3110123,5,B0013FSL0C,"The acting was superb. The material may be disturbing to younger people, who find it difficult to deal with life's problems.  Turning rocky fields into smooth landscapes is hard work, and there are plenty of ruts and  stumps  that need clearing before the paths are smooth. The role of  man who guides the transition is difficult on his home life, as well. This film gives us a window into their private issues. Gabriel Byrne is great!

The show is entertaining with exceptional writing following the trials of everyday people and how they work out the problems dealing with traumatic events and relationships in their lives.

3110143,4,B0013FSL0C,"I loved this series, but anything about psychotherapy that doesn't involve pills, ECT treatments, and a horrible psycho ward, may not be everyone's idea of entertaining television. This drama centers around talking and human emotions, and you really get to know each patient (NO I'M NO IN THE THERAPY BUSINESS), over a period of sessions. Sometimes, it can be slow -- and there are some story lines I didn't particularly care for, nor did I find them especially believable (I won't mention which as that would require I give away a major plot line).

The acting is absolutely superb, with kudos to Gabriel Bryne Michele Forbes, Dianne Wiest; but the real star of Series 1 is Mia Waskiowska, as the young gymnast.

It is possible to watch select episodes and still follow the series -- so if you find you don't like a particular patient story, you can watch the Pilot (you sort of have to), and then select the episodes that are about the patient or patients you find most interesting. I actually watched the full series when it ran on HBO. I wish Amazon Prime had gotten the rights to Seasons 2 & 3 as just purchasing the full season is ruinously expensive.",1401926400,,1157,4.639024390243902

3110151,4,B0013FSL0C,"Ask yourself if you can really help anyone if you live in a bubble? This question presented in Season 1, Episode 40, Paul & Gina, week 8.

Interesting are these two, Gabriel Byrne, an Irishman and Dianne Wiest, an American with Scottish roots, both about the same age and of my own generation, within a decade.  Even more ironic is the writers and producers all appear to be Israelis.  (I grew up in California, Hawaii and Israel). Anyone my age who has done time in the therapist office will recognize some of these scenes. I get the personal impression this is an Anglo interpretation of a Jewish occupation: psychotherapy which has become something else in about one generation.

Gina invites Paul to look at his own perceptions of her. He has known her for decades. Or has he? Does he know HER? Or has he created a version her that fits what he needs her to be? Like a caricature, a cartoon? What do we really know about each other? Are all therapists actors, emotional, impulsive, with unresolved childhood issues who need the persona, the character they play to be controlled? Because they are struggling along with their patients, as much as their patients are with the same issues? Are the therapists USING the therapy for themselves? Is it a cult, this psychotherapy? A business? A racket? All of the above? Is it a religion? Does it only work if all parties believe in it? Only if it includes love, intimacy but not physical touch? Does it hasten divorces & suicides? Does it ever really lead to true love? Is there such a thing? Like the ever-elusive holy grail this search for truth and meaning is explored with refreshingly honest questions without answers.

I cannot say that therapy helps. I cannot even be sure whether it has helped me in my past, although I spent many years involved in various forms of therapy before rejecting it. It fills a need, an emptiness, a quest for meaning. And in a way, these films do the same thing.

We should by then know what her own dad is like as this is the direction to go in, as well as looking at how she is escaping her own reality. then I read that later in the season he falls in love with her and tells her.

The series is indeed action-packed, with intrigue, surprises along the way, sad endings and happy endings, but it is not in a physical way. IOt is all about dialogue; all the sessions take place in the therapist's office, expertly and empathically played by Gabriel Byrne. Some sessions take place at his clinical supervisor's office, that part equally well performed by Diane Weest. Paul's clients really test his patience and boundaries. It is good to show that even experienced therapists need to avail themselves of supervision from time to time throughout their career. Being a clinical social worker myself for years, it feels as if the  patients are real people with real life dilemmas. The therapeutic dialogue that takes place seems real and appropriate and surely must have been written in part by actual therapists. The therapist, Paul, does an excellent job with that sometimes difficult technique of staring and waiting for a long time to let the client talk first, the hugely pregnant pause as it were. However, I feel he offers ""interpretations"" too frequently, too lengthy, and some times off the mark, rather than letting the client take his/her time and eventually come to a meaningful interpretation on their own. I must say this series highlights some extremely difficult, angry, defiant, non-compliant clients, and if my caseload was filled with cases like that, I don't think I would have lasted over 20 years in the business.

I just finished the last two discs, and I am blown away all over again! I blame the acting, the directing, and of course, the writing. Absolutely first-rate!

If a show about 5 different people going to see a therapist sounds intriguing, give In Treatment a serious attempt. Each character or patient takes a while to get to the meat of their story. None of them really know what to expect in therapy, and they aren't able to trust the therapist. So as he slowly wins them over, and as they share their incredible stories- This show REALLY starts to materialize.

Did I mention it is intense? If I weren't such a big macho-type-of-guy, I might have almost choked back a tear or two here! Alright- They actually got me once. Don't tell anyone! What can I say? By the end of the season 2, I found myself deeply identifying with every single character. Even the ones I didn't like for a while! But, the one that really got me in this recent season, was the 23 year-old girl who was coping with her diagnosis of cancer. Her acting and the plight of her character just really had me wanting to help her. This show is Masterpiece Theater, evolved.

Unfortunately, I doubt In Treatment will ever be as popular as it deserves to be. I can't really recommend this to my friends. I don't think they would ""get"" it. I can picture them just looking at me like I was a nerd, but I've studied psychology in college and I've used therapy to get through some of my own tough times. I've been fascinated by the profession for a long time. I've seen how well it can help untie the knots in your thoughts, like a massage can handle the knots in your muscles.

That being said, I feel the need to comment on the roles of therapist as played by Paul, and the role of supervisor as depicted in Gina.
I think Paul is a good therapist, and that is saying something in this field that is populated by many who haven't a clue about how to do this work. He is very empathic - that is, he demonstrates an ability to understand the feelings of his patients. He is respectful always with patients who are difficult. However, he is totally unwilling to share himself and his history with patients who would benefit from it. This is a matter of judgement, but Paul is bound by the dogmatic and rigid rules of this profession, which are formulated and promulgated in order to insure that no patient is adversely affected by therapists who don't know how to do the work. Paul frequently answers a legitimate question with another question, which properly infuriates his patients, and which allows Paul to dodge the question. He is frequently too emphatic in his making of points, which scares his patients into non-responsive submission. He shouts when he could just talk. He is at times unprofessional, appearing in his sessions unshaven and wearing jeans.
Gina, as his ""supervisor"" comes across as all-knowing, patronizing, judgmental, controlling, and frequently off the mark in thinking about and reacting to Paul's problems. She is the epitome of the social worker therapist. She is a walking cliche, complete with dresses that cover her from neck to floor, the sappy, pasted-on smile, the fake ""little girl"" way she speaks, and her insipid manner. Faultlessly acted by this actor

I chose this rating because as a retired therapist I thought it gave a very authentic portrayal of both the therapist and patient's experience of therapy.  The script was outstanding as were the actors who were incredibly believable as the patients.

 The fact that therapist is portrayed as a flawed and conflicted human being much like his patients added to the series realism.  The contrast in his behaviour as the ever wise therapist and his angry and defensive behaviour in  supervision also felt authentic.  Gabriel Byrne, as the therapist Paul, gives an outstanding performance.

For those reviewers saying, ""a real world/real life look into psychotherapy,"" I can't help but wonder about what broad-based experience they may have with therapy, therapists, or those ""in treatment.""

Having much experience in work-related relationships with mental health professionals, having much experience personally in therapy working on my own issues, and relating to quite a few people in therapy with regular life difficulties and/or mental illnesses of different kinds, this Laura episode is very disappointing to me. It is simply cheap and disgusting, and takes away from what could be a truly great program. There've been good lawyer programs, and horrible ones. Good medical ones, and horrible ones. This theme of psychotherapy could be so great and interesting, as well as truly informative, instead it is trashy, so much cheap-garbage language and even bathroom sex in a TV show... it insults the whole idea, and that's too bad. The story line too was shallow and sappy, lacking in any genuine, intelligent creativity. I was really disappointed.

Disgusted, I bailed out somewhere around 12-13 minutes. I won't be wasting 1 more minute on this pathetic waste of time and energy -- maybe those responsible for this thing can get some good therapy and do better next time around.

3110214,5,B0013FSL0C,"""In Treatment"" has one of the simplest but most powerful premises for any TV series in history: various therapy patients come to the home office of Dr. Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) and lay bare their souls. ""In Treatment"" creator Rodrigo Garcia--adapting a series that originally appeared on Israeli TV--has assembled a fascinating group of characters. They include Alex (Blair Underwood), a hotshot Navy pilot beset by feelings of guilt and inadequacy; Sophie (Mia Wasikowska), a suicidal teenage gymnast; Jake (Josh Charles) and Amy (Embeth Davidtz), a mismatched married couple on the brink of divorce; and--most disturbing for Dr. Weston--Laura (Melissa George), a sexually confused doctor with an obsessive crush on Dr. Weston.

As the series progresses, we see that Dr. Weston himself is not without problems, and definitely not without character flaws that would be much improved by therapy. He is chilly and demanding toward Kate (Michelle Forbes), his increasingly fed-up wife, and he also has issues with Gina Toll (Dianne Wiest), his own therapist and former mentor.

The 43 episodes are extremely brief (the average length is about 25 minutes, but some are as short as 20), concentrated, and brilliantly written, often leaving viewers gasping for air. But it is the performances that really carry ""In Treatment"" and make it a must-see program. Every actor on the show deserves to be singled out for praise; however, I will say that Byrne is rock-solid as the show's anchor, and Wasikowska clearly reveals herself to be one of the finest actors of her generation. ""In Treatment"" isn't exactly cheerful viewing, but it will leave you totally fascinated.",1351900800,,1662,5.2443609022556394

I think In Treatment nailed it.  Good therapy, that is effective therapy that helps create lasting change is not about the therapist giving the patient a solution, or cure.  It is about the therapist understanding how to subtly encouage the patient to arrive at the solution himself.  Watching Laura's body language and listening to her story in the first episode, I thought I could predict where the session was heading.  It was very interesting to see Paul wondering about this too through his neutral reactions and very subdued way of offering her tissue and giving her a blanket. He was also affected by the seductive character of Laura's presentation as you could see when he started to play with his wedding ring and then stopped himself. Excellant writing, direction and acting. I am going to buy the whole series.",1345593600,,992,4.987878787878788

All the feigned pensive expressions (oh, wait - he took his glasses off!) and ""tell me mores"" had me literally sighing out loud. Second, who decided people in therapy shoved into a 30 minute segment was interesting or realistic?

If you've been to therapy, it ISN'T THAT INTERESTING! Not to mention, shoving 3 acts into a half hour promotes some fairly forced turning points that I personally found contrived at best.",1340064000,7,621,4.535714285714286

She was easy to talk too and very one on one. She gave me examples that I could relate too and not just telling me what a book says.

Alot like Paul, in fact I told her about the show and she loved it lol.
Paul was a therapist who was having a hard time in life ,he wasn't perfect and he wasn't a God. He was just a man who was trying to help others and I think in a way he was trying to help himself.

He made mistakes
and we see the battle that he has within himself.

3110221,4,B0013FSL0C,"I'm ashamed of myself - as a confirmed sceptic about the validity and efficacy of psychotherapy - but I found this series quite addictive. Following four patients over the course of nine weeks is intriguing in itself (despite the psychobabble involved) because the stories develop and build but what really kindled my interest was the fact that the therapist himself (played by Gabriel Byrne) is under treatment as well and in doing so is openly sceptical about psychotherapy and its use. The sessions between him and his therapist (played by Dianne Wiest) are crackling with animosity and cynicism; if it weren't for these I might not recommend the series. The rest is OK, the acting is sometimes excellent - particularly that of Mia Wasikowska, who on this showing has the makings of a great actress, and of Dianne Wiest, who already is just that - the various cases mostly keep a good balance between realism and drama, and Gabriel Byrne is always worth watching. He is blessed with one of those faces so redolent of Depth Of Character that he doesn't even need to act. He can just sit there and his face will do all the work for him.

Drawbacks? It could be extremely monotonous for some; virtually everything takes place in one room and it's almost all talk - anybody who begins to fidget after half a dozen lines of dialogue will find this very heavy-going. There are a few pieces of drama but probably not enough to satisfy on their own; if you don't enjoy listening to conversation you'd best leave this alone. As for the more prurient-minded, there is a certain amount of dirty talk (this being HBO) but once again probably not enough to satisfy.",1324512000,2,1655,4.706896551724138

The interactions are candid, fascinating, aggressive and confrontational.  Its like eavesdropping on a therapist with their most interesting patients.  The fact that this show has little action and is still so absorbing is a testament to how good the writing really is.

3110227,5,B0013FSL0C,"""In Treatment"" is riveting television.  The series' first season will never be surpassed, a point that can be made more definitively now that HBO has declared a quasi-end to the show after the third season.  [There was announcement of an end followed by some waffling by HBO, so who knows at this point.]

Gabriel Byrne is the engine that makes this show work.  His role of Paul Weston calls for long stretches of silence and active - almost aggressive - listening.  Then, when he talks, his words are sparse and impactful.  His understated delivery gives his observations a powerful punch.  Not everyone can pull this feat of minimalism off.  Gabriel Byrne can.  His casting is a masterstroke.

Season 1 provided us with one breakout star: Mia Wasikowska.  She's simply amazing as Sophie a young suicidal gymnast.  Those of us who caught Ms. Wasikowska here feel like we were in on a secret.  The rest of the world's caught on now.

I also relished the episodes with Embeth Davidtz (always a personal favorite) and Josh Charles (his 'Jake' here is a marked change from The Good Wife's Will Gardner) as well as those with Blair Underwood.  I always joke that Blair Underwood does Blair Underwood very well, but he opened my eyes here with some truly fine acting.

Melissa George's Laura episodes left me a bit cold and uncomfortable, and I simply never cottoned at all to Paul's sessions with Gina (Dianne Wiest) - they're just so combative.  However, I do like Michelle Forbes and felt like she was underused as Paul's wife, Kate.  I would have had more Kate, less Gina.

I'm fascinated by In Treatment's heritage as the Israeli show Be'Tipul (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Treatment-Be-Tipul-The-Complete-First-Season-Hebrew/dp/B001QWX850/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Treatment (Be'Tipul) - The Complete First Season (Hebrew)</a>).

An intriguing HBO series that has both; an overall theme and underneath it lies a brilliant underlining storyline that is never viewed with restlessness. This might not be for the action-packed, police/murdering, or mystery suspenseful audience but is extremely close to the reality of dealing with conflict/trauma using the tools of psychoanalysis. Not your typical ""shrink"" program.
  Introducing and delving into the human psyche. A mid-level psychological series which often catches and releases the viewer to ponderous questions of one's own consciousness. Storyline mainly involves 5/6 diverse characters with different but relative challenges. Follow characters through weekly sessions of discovery, denial, challenge, betrayal on their wayward heroes' journey, along with many twists of coincidence...or is it fate?
  Script is well researched and character development is extraordinary. Mia Wasikowska (Sophie)(Alice in Wonderland) establishes herself as a young 5 star actress who very well may be the best up-an-coming young actress I've ever seen in a television series, Gabriel Byrne (therapist) is flawless within duality roles of not only providing therapy but as a conflicted human. Melissa George (Laura) has the best script of character development on the show and has no problem playing the love/sexual transference witnessed with real-life patient/psychologist relationships.
  Why 4 stars and not 5...Season 2 is taking way to long to release on DVD.",1273795200,6,1566,5.816593886462882
3110246,5,B0013FSL0C,"As a clinical psychologist, I was pleasantly surprised to find Hollywood presenting an intriguing, more realistic world of psychotherapy than the typical ridiculous stereotypes.  The main character takes a psychodynamic perspective to therapy (I prefer cognitive-behavioral myself) and does so in a quick moving, confident fashion.  He is presented with numerous ethical dilemnas that he attempts to address in responsible fashions.  His clients are very interesting and realistic, as are the relationships between the therapist and clients.  I am looking forward to the second season!",1271894400,10,585,5.847058823529411

The doorway to the mind this series opens is toxic and provides no hope of any transcendent redemption.  Thank-you HBO for showing, better than any sermon from the pulpit could, just how sick we truly are when we have nothing to hope in other than pure intellect and self preservation.  Sadly, this is all ""therapy"", whether it comes on the couch or from a self help book, has to offer.  We debate Darwin vs. Creation as if ""survival of the fittest"" has no real relational consequences.  Are we all just highly intelligent animals?

That is actually impossible.  They can vary so much, but the quality in writing is so superior to network television.  I've watched westerns, cop shows, doctor shows, shows about dieing.  Comparing them to each other is sort of like comparing steak to pizza.  In Treatment is a wonderful example of what good writing is all about.  I thought ""the wire"" had an amazing story line that followed through 5 years.  I started to watch this show and found it slow to start with.  It was so different, but I gave it some time and by week 7 I had changed my mind.  This show would be so much harder to write for, because of the limited cast and the limited set.  This show makes you sit, sometimes squirm, and read peoples faces as well as listen to the words come out of their mouths.  It makes you think.  You get to think about your life and how your childhood has formed you into the person you are.  This show probably can't answer your own questions, or change your life, but it will work your brain.  If you want to think as you watch the screen, give it a chance.  It doesn't stimulate you like action shows do, but it is one fantastic show.  Give it a chance to work on your mind and your heart.

3110259,4,B0013FSL0C,"This series, translated from an Israeli prototype, takes us to the heart of psychotherapy. It stars Gabriel Byrne as Paul Weston, a somewhat rumpled and worn-out therapist, and six patients. Each 25-minute episode is a real-time view of a therapy session.

The first patient is Laura, a sexy doctor about to split with her boyfriend who reveals in the first episode that she's in love with Paul. Next comes Alex, an African-American ace fighter pilot who accidentally killed 25 children in a school in Iraq. The most gripping patient is Sophie played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She's a 15-year-old Olympic gymnast whose life has gone off the rails with a suicide attempt. Fourth are Amy and Jake, a couple whose marriage is falling apart. Finally, in the fifth episode, Weston seeks guidance and spars with Gina (Dianne Wiest), a former mentor with whom he has clashed in the past.

We meet each of these characters nine times during the course of the season. Other peripheral characters -- Paul's unfaithful wife and kids, Sophie's mom -- occasionally drift into the action but basically we're stuck in Paul's cluttered office watching him fiddle with his glasses as his patients pour out their troubles.

Occasionally, the translation from the Israeli-version strikes a false note. One anecdote is clearly drawn from the Holocaust. Transfering it to the South in the 1940s doesn't work. In another reference, one of the characters recalls the aroma of cakes baking on a Friday afternoon suffusing the apartment building of her youth. Yes, that happens in Israel on sabbath eve but not in America.

At the end of this series, we learn that Paul is at least as screwed up as his patients and that psychotherapy often doesn't work. Only one of the patients makes real progress toward a recovery. The others either stew in their juices or get worse -- in one case much worse.

Still, it's fascinating viewing, well-written and acted.",1257292800,6,1935,4.959876543209877

After four sessions with the same clients each week we see 'Paul' in supervision trying to come to grips with his own unconscious and counter-transference.

I have to watch the entire week (1 disc) before I can walk away.  I have to find out what each character is going to say or do next. I actually think about and worry about them as if they were actual people/patients.  The little girl is an awesome actor!

After a slower than expected start, the characters very quickly began to reveal aspects of themselves which built and built, forming incredibly complex people and interpersonal situations. I liked all of the characters but found myself looking forward to each new instalment of Sophie, the teenager with a 30 year old head on her shoulders and a venomous tongue born of painful emotional baggage. I found the scenes featuring Sophie and her Mum hard to watch but I believed totally all that I was seeing. My only issue with the writers is that while they go to the trouble of explaining and demonstrating ""transferrence"", I think the protagonist, Paul - a highly skilled psychotherapist - demonstrates ""counter transferrence"" without much insight into his own practice and feelings, particularly with Sophie and to a lesser extent, Alex.

3110275,5,B0013FSL0C,"In Treatment, a hypnotic HBO series, offers deep insight into the lives of others, other people's pain, suffering, wounds and neurosis. This excellent series operates within the structure of weekly sessions of six patients: One sexually-intense female doctor; one top gun; one teenage gymnast; a couple in trouble; and the therapist seeing his own therapist.

Gabriel Brynne does a grand job of portraying a therapist with great compassion and insight, and troubles of his own. Blaire Underwood does an outstanding job as an incredibly high achiever, and the list goes on with the great direction and the superb cast. The characters don't always fill the assigned professional shoes, i.e., the character that is supposed to be an anesthesiologist, as well as, a woman that uses sex as a sort of currency. The unbelievable part is that she's an anesthesiologist. Diane Wiest doesn't really seem like a therapist but pulls off the role by playing the role of a somewhat clichd, self-absorbed therapist with foibles of her own, very awkwardly.

The episodes frequently end very uncomfortably, which remains one of its many charms.

3110278,5,B0013FSL0C,"I highly recommend this series for those who are students of human nature and enjoy excellent writing, direction and acting. I am once again amazed at HBO's uncanny knack for tackling projects that lift and redefine the television medium. In Treatment is the most accurate portrayal of what happens in the private confines of psychotherapy that has ever been attempted by the large or small screen. The sheer appeal of this show is its unapologetic 'bareness', minimalism and pitch perfect honesty. Gabriel Byrne is understated in his brilliance; Blair Underwood gives perhaps the most sublime and compelling performance of his career; Glynn Turman (not often seen as an accomplished actor i.e. Cooley High, A Different World, etc.) blew me away with his brief but poignant performance; Dianne Wiest - an oscar-winning actress is incredible as the ""Therapist's Therapist"".

I have often wondered how anyone had the courage to do such an unadorned project - that is exploring pscychotherapy between 2 people. I think that the answer is that so many of us are secretly hurting and therefore enjoy a safe outlet to vicariously experience such a therapeutic environment. In Treatment delivers this and much more. In Treatment is now 'In Season' in our culture. If you are as fascinated by human nature and relationships as I am (I am a pastor) you will be riveted by this show. Buy the whole DVD series so you can watch it uninterrupted. I found Season 1 to be more riveting than the 2nd season although both are quite good.",1247184000,6,1520,4.9375

3110281,4,B0013FSL0C,"I realise 'In Treatment' is a remake, but I can't shake the feeling it still feels experimental...

Don't get me wrong, it's a terrific show. The emotions running through each character feel honest and believable and every single actor delivers a brilliant performance (there are NO weak-links). The script is sharp and intelligent, and despite the lack of different locations it draws you in. I was never once bored when watching the 40+, 30 minute episodes.

This show also feels realistic. For me shows that feature realism are always interesting but seem to forget the fact that the ultimate goal is to entertain it's audience. 'In Treatment' is aware of this and (especially in the first few episodes) feels like it's trying to make the audience ignore the fact that we're mostly just watching people talk. Some characters seem like they're monologing and just seem a bit too comfortable displaying every little emotion. This isn't a bad thing, and sort of gives it that indie (fore-mentioned ""experimental"") feel, but doesn't really make you forget you just spent the last 30 minutes watching a conversation.

Oh, and there are no extras on the DVD's (unless I'm totally missing something). The show's good enough, but I would've loved to see interviews with the cast (especially since there's a new cast for season 2). To me no extras just feel like a missed opportunity with DVD sets. I realise you're mostly buying the DVD's for the show itself, but considering you can stream most episodes online it kinda makes you think twice before purchasing this DVD set.

With television shows these days trying to 'out-create' each other, it's nice to see a series that truly does more with less. Despite my complaints, this show is definitely worth owning (at Amazon's price of $34.99 when everyone else is charging $50+).",1244592000,6,1823,4.947712418300654

I have very little patience for this sort of thing in real life; even less in my entertainment.

People have praised this as ""incredibly real,"" which perhaps is the problem I have with it.  There is not a narrative in each episode in any traditional sense.  There is story, yes, but no plot, and while I certainly don't need an ambitiously structured plot in stories, I do expect character-driven pieces to have interesting characters.  These characters behave like petulant children; these are not interesting neurotics.  And frankly, I find Byrne's ""incredibly real"" patience trying--I want him to leap up and start smacking them around and telling them to grow up!  They're that annoying!

Of course it's sped up to fit one client into one season, but it's pretty accurate in its depiction of how a psychdynamically-oriented clinician goes about work.

Weston's predictably banal responses to his patients could have been generated by computer. His reckless disregard for the boundaries of his profession are ludicrous at best, and dangerous at worst. Accepting an expensive gift from a patient -- the famous all-the-bells-and-whistles coffeemaker -- cheaply encodes the character's resistance. But it also irrevocably contaminates his therapy. The remaining clients fare as badly at Weston's hands -- for example, in the unchecked violence the couple display in Weston's office. Therapy is meant as a safe space, not as a danger zone. Rather multiply examples, of which there are many, I concede the show's single bright spot: Gina's scrupulous adherence to the canons Weston so flagrantly violates, and Dianne Wiest's brilliant evocation of a therapist who knows her business. This show's problem lies not in its acting, which is fine throughout, but in its overdrawn and needlessly melodramatic scripts. Interestingly, my psychologist agrees. But then, he sets and maintains boundaries. These frustrate the resistant client at times, but ultimately make for successful outcomes. Critical hoopla notwithstanding, the distressing portrayal of ""treatment"" makes this series one to avoid.",1243641600,17,1436,5.561643835616438

I am happy to say that the shows I have watched so far have been excellent.

3110297,5,B0013FSL0C,"As a psychotherapist myself, it is rare that I see an accurate portrayal of a therapy session on television or in a movie.  'In Treatment' is that rarest of shows, a very accurate portrayal of a therapist and his patients.  The therapist (Gabriel Byrne) grapples with all types of personal issues of his own as he tries to help his patients who often struggle with similar issues.  Concerns like boundaries, limit setting, clinical supervision and acting out during session are all dealt with.

Gabriel Byrne plays a very human and very caring therapist.  The viewer is privy to his once a week sessions with 4 different patients plus his once a week session with his own therapist.  We can see his emotional struggles as he tries to do the right thing in situations that are far from black and white.  He seeks clinical supervision but his past baggage with his clinical supervisor, Gina, (Diane Wiest) often gets in the way.

3110305,5,B0013FSL0C,"I just want to add a few thoughts to the mostly glowing reviews here.  Brilliant conception, astoundingly smart and believable writing, and most of all, microscopically brilliant acting.  The reason this series is as great as the very best HBO shows - including Sopranos, the Wire, Deadwood,etc.-- the ones that have broad visual canvasses lacking on the mostly one-room IN TREATMENT--is that you see as much going on visually on the actors' faces as you did in the striking settings (New Jersey lanscapes, bada bing, dusty Western saloons, dark brothel rooms, etc.) of those other shows.

If Gabriel Byrne did not spend a decade in therapy it's hard to understand how he aced the mannerisms and expressions of psychotherapists. Byrne's face was as active just watching his patients talk as it was when he was talking and gesticulating. And oh, what gesticulating. Every single actor who played one of his patients was not just good but jaw-droppingly good. Layers and layers of thought and emotion, often ones contradicting each other at the same split second in time, can be gleaned off their faces. (All you have to do is watch them as closely as Byrne does.)  Embeth Davidtz's arching eyebrows had so much attitude, her body language betrayed so much ache and anger beneath the  words that were drenched in denial.  Josh Charles peeled open his character over the eight weeks like delicate layers of onion. Blair Underwood's physical and attitudinal bluster was so believable that it was genuinely shocking when his confusion and heartbreak came pouring out toward the end.  Michelle George as Laura was a revelation.  Why isn't this woman a big-time movie star? As right for her character, the actress created a slippery sexuality at once seductive and suspicious; yet still, she managed to reveal a vulnerability perched right at the corner of manipulation and authentic pain. You could never make up your mind about her, which is exactly what was required by the story of this unnerving and unnervingly beautiful character. Dianne Weist couldn't have been more credible as a psychoanalyst if she herself had spent a decade in analytic training.  But perhaps most astonishingly of all, Mia Wasikowska as Sophie, the teenage gymnast, created the most indelible of all the patient characters.  Apparently without much prior acting experience, Wasikowska managed to embody all the contradictions of the most complexly written character on the show, and she brought dimensions beyond what was written.  Her voice, her physicality, her minute facial expressions could not have been any more revealing even when her character was doing everything she could to hide her painful truths not only from Paul the therapist but from herself. How she pulled it off is a miracle of genius acting from a relative neophyte.  The fact that she wasn't even nominated for an Emmy is bizarre.  Who are these people doing the nominating?  The NY TIMES did an article some weeks before announcement of the Emmy nominations calling for her nomination.  You'd have to be blind, deaf, and certainly dumb not to have been dumbfounded by her performance.  I guess she gets something of a last laugh; I just read that she was cast by Tim Burton as the lead in his upcoming version of ""Alice in Wonderland.""  HE was certainly paying attention watching her perform IN TREATMENT.

The direction and everything else was perfect, and the script, transmogrified somewhat from the Israeli version, was as layered and brilliant as the acting that fleshed it all out.  So I am thrilled to have also just read that the series has been renewed.  It is being filmed now, it seems, and will be aired sometime in 2009.  Maybe that's why they delayed the release of the DVD of season one - wanting it out just as the second season begins.

Don't miss this show; it's one for the ages, and I have a sense that it will become the humongous hit it deserves (I guess it was a moderate hit when first aired)when more people see the second season.",1226793600,34,4003,4.908011869436201

3110318,5,B0013FSL0C,"This is a powerful, deeply moving, intelligent, emotionally nuanced series. It consisting of nothing more than psychotherapy sessions between a cast of reoccuring characters, this show fills an important niche missing from most television -- the richness, complexity, and heartbreak of the ""emotional life.""

Are you tired of seeing thin, carbon-copied and cliched characters in movies and television shows? Then this is the perfect series for you, because here the whole point is to explore the inner lives of the characters.

Does the the fact that this series focuses a great deal on the emotions of the characters mean that there is no ""action?"" Only if you define ""action"" as soley encompassing explosions or giant robot attacks.

To me, however, there was more action in this show than almost any other I've seen: there was the complexity of coming to terms with the guilt of death, of a disintergrating marriage, of children torn between parents, of unrequieted love, of the intense pressures to be successful, of professional jealousy, of the quiet desperation of everyday life, and the pain and bravery of those trying to take control of their lives.

The writing is really quite incredible. I was time and again rivited by the ways in which the story tellers captured and traced the emotionally raw and complex workings of the human heart- the tangled web which constitutes human relationships.

Some detractors have said they find the characters ""annoying:"" these characters strike me as ""real,"" for, in life, people are themselves complex and full of paradoxes, at times annoying but at others deeply sympathetic. I came to be involved with all the characters, and, in the end, they all suprised me, up until the very last episode.

The acting is also superb. Gabriel Byrne (as the therapist ""Paul"") gives the performance of his lifetime, and Mia Wasikowska gives a star making performance as ""Sophie,"" a troubled gymnast.

This is a show for people who find themselves interested in the human mind and heart, particularly, in the complex ways in which we become entangled with our fellow human beings, and often punish ourselves, lie to ourselves, and hide from our own inner truths. What is the thrill of an asteroid threatening to destroy the Earth compared to the everyday struggle with such things as love, guilt, and the fear of facing another day on this planet.

3340461,5,B0013FSL0C,"This is an incredibly daring show. So simple yet so complex. Most of the episodes play out as two-handers. Admittedly, it could work as a series of one-act plays. It's just a therapist talking to his patients. There is a very high level of writing and acting going on here. Now, people will find themselves drawn to different character's stories and it can be a bit of a mixed bag because of that. But, there's so much material here, it's hard to knock it. Gabriel Byrne is really great in his role. He's convincing in his role as a therapist. And, what's more, he seems like a good one (foibles aside). This is by far the best season of In Treatment for one reason: Mia Washikowska, who plays ""Sophie."" Wow. What a stunning outing for a 13(ish) year old. There is a particular episode, the close of her arc, which utterly destroyed me. I'd made the mistake of watching the episode while waiting for a haircut and had to retreat to my car to bawl sans judgement. Her nuance, her honesty, her control are all way way way beyond her years. I always looked forward to her sessions during the series. All in all, it's a good series.

It's in real time (or very close to it), lending a distant sense of ""reality"" TV, except with depth and storytelling.  The creator (Hagai Levi) and lead writer (Sarah Treem) are also paired in The Affair, a showtime series that aired several years later and which (I think) is better-known.  Their moody style; their focus on the difficulty of accurately assessing other people's motives and knowledge sets; and their interest in timing and the importance of place (even, in this case, a single room) are all recognizable between the two series.  So is the unnecessary amount of sexual detail, except here it's all verbal re-telling, so it doesn't feel as distracting from the plot as the borderline porn in The Affair.",1494633600,,836,4.9928057553956835

There are several scenes that are directly related to the specific ethic codes that are being broken. If the psychotherapist in this show was a real psychotherapist, he would've lost his license to practice.

However, after a couple more episodes, I took a little more time to study the show, read through the synopsis, get a sense of the flow, etc. Paul has five cases (including himself!) that run sequentially over 50+ episodes - every fifth case being the same patient. Once I had a clear picture of what was going on, I actually went back and started all over - which didn't take a lot of time because each episode only lasts ~22 minutes.

I'm quite familiar with Gabriel Byrne - part of the reason I focused in on the show in the first place - and he does an excellent job. Guest stars include Diane Weist, former Law and Order DA, Blair Underwood from LA Law (why hasn't this show been syndicated or ???) - Josh Charles (The Good Wife) - and several others; all giving great performances. All in all it's a great show, but you do have to pay very close attention to the dialogue. A good bit of intrigue to: two patients meet on their way out/in and get involved; Paul has his own dysfunctional family issues to deal with all the while.

3340553,3,B0013FSL0C,"I first watched the Sophie episodes only, and I thought, ""This is the most brilliant show I've ever seen. Amazing acting. Unbelievable attention to detail with facial expressions and body language, since half of the show's content is displayed in those most subtle indicators."" The episodes spoke deeply to me, I guess, maybe because my own psychiatric illness and therapy issues are most like hers. I don't rewatch shows, but I rewatched those.

Then I went back and watched the others.

On a subjective level,
I've had bad experience with therapists and therapeutic relationship boundaries, and the Laura episodes brought back flashbacks from that even though my issues weren't the same as hers. Warning to anyone else triggered by that subject!
I didn't relate to anything with Alex's circumstances or mindset, and my marriage is happy so I didn't relate to much of the couple's struggles either.

On an objective level, the show was incredible regardless of whether I could personally relate to the characters. I was better able to relate to a foreign mindset because of the show.

MY BIGGEST ISSUE: The sessions with Gina
WHAT THE HECK??? I felt sick by the end of every episode because he spent the entire time criticizing a kind, thoughtful woman trying to help. He threw stuff, yelled, belittled, and basically tried to destroy her. It was very, very upsetting.
It doesn't even make sense! He spent the rest of the week as a thoughtful person helping others, but then within three minutes of seeing an old friend, he rips into her? He backs down and says a nice thing ever five minutes or so and then goes against what he says while he rants about her evil motives and how she's just out to get him and just wants to cause him personal suffering. WHAT???
Just now in week four with Gina, Paul is telling Gina she has no empathy, that he thought she never even liked therapy, that why would she do something with people who seem so disgusting to her - all of which is clearly not true, so where is this coming from and what the heck is it doing in the show?
The episodes with Gina are why I reduced my otherwise 7-star review to 3 stars, not because her acting was bad but because the screenwriting was TERRIBLE.",1477008000,3,2219,4.653061224489796

We can aldo appreciate the profound process of healing and showing the reality that not everybody can handle it. I also love how they show the 2 sides by exposing Paul (the therapist) vulnerablities and insecurities and also taking therapy! Not showing a hypocrite version of a ""perfect"" psychologist who is always in control and has the perfect treatment plan, etc.

The unusual, and rewarding aspect is that there is no attempt to ""solve"" a problem in the short span of the episode.  The episode ends with my wife and I discussing the content.  The writers have enough respect for the audience to allow the audience to come to a ""conclusion"", if one is necessary.  Highly recommend the series.",1475798400,,474,4.8625

3340583,5,B0013FSL0C,"Exceptional series.  Talented cast.  Extraordinary verisimilitude in terms of not only the counseling environment and interactions, but also the behind-the-scenes family dynamics that attend this profession.  (NOTE:  I was involved, at one time or other, as a substance abuse counselor, an adolescent sexuality counselor, and group therapist in multiple 12-step programs and also suicide prevention hotlines.)  Whether a LCSW, a psychologist, or psychiatrist--or other professional involved in social/relationship work--the industry of ""care givers"" is often plagued by ""burnout, addiction, and deep plunges into Nietsche's abyss.)  Yet what would we do without them?  As G.K. Chesterton intoned: ""We are all shipmates on a stormy sea and owe each other a terrible loyalty.""  He meant, of course, not BAD but rather ""fierce.""  This program and its extraordinary circus of cases and breadth of clients brings out vestiges of the worst...and best in all of us.  It takes a while for the drama to get rolling, yet fortunately it begins to achieve a momentum and rhythm of its own that puts the human drama in bit-sized pieces (segments are less than a half hour each.)  In this age where everything is dumbed down, twitterized, and relegated to 25-words-or-less without context or compassion, this Series is the only one I've ever awarded FIVE Stars, irrespective of its general popularity (either by other raters, Rotten Tomatoes, or pundits who want to put their often negative two cents in...because they can.)",1473984000,2,1510,5.382978723404255

By the end of the season, it is not clear that any of the protagonists have experienced happier or more fulfilling lives as a consequence of the therapy they experience. The drive to be honest and to let it all hang out is gut wrenching, and as the show illustrates, can yield tragic consequences. Sometimes it is better not to venture into the deep, dark recesses of the mind and heart. On the other hand, there are aha! moments when the patient's experience breakthrough insights that enable them to understand better why they feel and behave the way they do. The acting is first rate. Each of the five patients the doctor is treating is credible and, by the end of the season, worthy of our sympathy. Given that the nearly forty episodes of the show take place in the a therapist's office, it is amazing how the excellent script and fine acting keep us riveted to the drama as it unfolds.",1467590400,,1053,4.6063829787234045

The lead psychiatrist makes you want to love him and hate him at certain times for being so human. However there is no more after Season 3 and there is a lot they could do yet with him being single.

I have seen too many movies that portray the therapist and the patient unrealistically. This episode rings true for both patient and therapist and accurately portrayed that type of session. I hope that the rest of the episodes follow suit. I am not sure how interesting these sessions would be for lay person but at least the series will inform the public what they could expect in psychotherapy. Of course, not all therapies are the same so that is the other variable that should be considered. But in general, so far, the portrayal is realistic enough to let potential clients what to expect and seasoned clients to see if what they see is similar ro what they are experiencing in their own sessions.",1457568000,,805,4.798561151079137

I am hooked on this program and look forward to seeing the next episode in order to see how the patients are progressing. But it not only deals with the patients. The doctor becomes a patient as well. it becomes obvious that the doctor is human and has problems just like everyone else. He also gets mad at his therapist, just like a normal patient might.

There is a lot of ""dead air"" in it (no talking, no sound), supposedly because the subjects are thinking. Sometimes the dead air is aggravating (or maybe my type A personality is showing). It's also taking a long time for the patients AND the psychiatrist to reach some sort of decision or reach the point where they're psychologically ""fixed"".

Although the episodes are fictional, one becomes enthralled in the sessions between the therapist played by Gabriel Byrne and his clients, as well as his interactions with his own therapist, ""Gena"".

3341170,4,B0013FSL0C,"This series is very convincing with some excellent performances. The net effect is the viewer really feels like they are ""In Therapy"" along with the characters. Some of the psychotherapeutic devices are a little trite, the patients can be very annoying at times, and Gabriel Byrne's character is gradually revealed to be deeply neurotic and fairly oblivious to the effect he has on people in his own life. All this is very realistic! My only quibble is Bryne's acting seems a bit off at some points, as if he's just not into it, or doesn't quite believe his own character would behave that way. But I enjoyed Season I and I'm starting to watch Season 2.",1453507200,,653,4.637931034482759

Gabriel Byrne is magical and captivating to watch as his quiet presence speaks volumes. I have never had the privilege of watching a series like this before. Mark Walberg, the Executive Producer, weaves life's biggest questions regarding moral code, ethics, societal norms and it's hypocrasies throughout each patient's struggles.

The writing is excellent as is the acting from the entire ensemble. Its an advantage when the most of the cast is relatively unknown so I had no preconceived ideas of the characters' personalities. I found the episodes gripping with the emotional interaction among the cast within what would seem to be a claustrophobic, single scene setting. I think the half hour time frame is an advantage as longer episodes would be emotionally exhausting and might become tedious as a result.

3341506,5,B0013FSL0C,Insightful and excellently directed. I highly recommend this series. The world becomes a better place when people leave their own bubble to view and seek to understand the bubbles that others live in. Observance is a great teacher and this series embodies that. Gabriel Byrne does a great job of breaking down barriers and getting people to see their own reflections in a true light. The pathway to knowledge is understanding and not hiding. If people could learn to listen more than they talked the distractions of their words would no longer cloud what is really going on. Asking the right question is at the threshold of every solution! Kudos to all involved at the making of this series.,1446940800,,691,4.815126050420168

I thoroughly enjoyed the series, however season 1 was the best by far!! 4 stars for season 2, and 3 stars for season 3.  The series was very well written.  I loved the way the show portrayed Paul as the perfect/imperfect Therapist.  He was very influential in helping others, but struggled in his own personal life.  At times I felt as if I was also 'In Treatment' with Paul.  I highly recommend this series to those who appreciate mature dialogue.",1446076800,,519,4.410526315789474

I LOVE IT.",1445904000,,369,4.477611940298507
3341568,4,B0013FSL0C,"It is a great series if you like character development and the ability to discern there are so many life issues, especially while growing up, that can make you a psychiatric mess as an adult, tonnage in cheek.  It is not a series that concentrates on only one person /patient at a time . The story of each patient is carried throughout many episodes and many other patients are added in so you do not see a few episodes on one patient, then another patient for a few episodes, etc. The patient story may run through two seasons with other patients intermingled. Also the stories of the patients are different, in age, sex, personality, problem etc. Also the psychologist has his own story that runs throughout, with the patients interactions entwined in his life.
  It is a series that you can actually watch 4 or 5 episodes and not get bored. I have watched only a few series, as I had no idea there were so many on such a variety of subjects. Not a TV watcher per say. If I do watch, I normally channel surf until I find something that appears interesting.
  However, this series became addictive after  the first two episodes. With Amazon Prime and Netflix I have discovered that there, in fact, some very well written series and movies that I either was not aware of or thought it did not sound interesting.
  This series is one such series. My only complaint, so far, is that apparently everyone seeing a counselor talks back and tells him/her that he/she is incompetent and uses the F bomb freely-very freely.",1445731200,2,1515,4.564575645756458
3341569,4,B0013FSL0C,"Gabriel Byrne is always good acting and this one is consistently good as a psycho therapist over two years of sessions, playing weekly. The cases offer revealing personalities, only two were skimmed over, not tolerated. This was acting yet so realistic as therapy goes. The F word was overused and used by most all players. Our civilization is thus disappointing as such with words stuck in the teeth, I prefer a broken record.",1445731200,,427,4.863013698630137

It is a very in depth and intimate look into peoples' lives through their sessions with their therapist and then how the patients lives had such an impact on the therapist. I never expected dialog between just two people in one room could be so emotional and so much more than just watching someone's actions. It is kind of having a story told to you (or even like just reading a really good book), and your own visions and thoughts of the story take over and become much more intense then what is ever shown on screen. I became so entranced with the stories of each of the patients, I had a hard time not staying up all night and day to watch all the episodes non-stop.

Dianne Wiest as his alter ego, counsel, guide, whatever she happens to be in the episode, is an amazing actress. One of those rare breed of actors who lets me forget she's acting.

3341805,5,B0013FSL0C,A fascinating series; I have been riveted by these sessions and have grown very fond of all the people struggling to work their way toward a clearer understanding of their problems. Therapy is hard and these patients show bravery and determination. That the therapist himself is feeling his way through relationship crises makes the series particularly compelling.

3341816,5,B0013FSL0C,"When this show first came out on HBO, I tried watching it. After all, I subscribed to HBO, I was interested in psychology and psychotherapy, and I heard that the show was supposed to be good. However, I just couldn't get into it.

But over two years ago, I stopped subscribing to cable TV and started receiving all of my television through rabbit ears and Netflix, Amazon Prime, and Hulu relayed through my Roku box. And, minus the distractions of the talking heads on cable networks such as CNN, I embarked upon a concentrated viewing of some of the greatest television drama programs ever including Battlestar Galactica (the remake), Friday Night Lights, Six Feet Under, Dexter, Deadwood, Breaking Bad, The Sopranos, The Wire, and Sons of Anarchy.

After that, I was primed and ready to try ""In Treatment"" again, and this time it grabbed my undivided attention from the very first episode and never let go throughout the entire first season. I found myself hanging on every word and gesture inside and outside Dr. Weston's ostensibly therapeutic inner sanctum and, like the therapists in the show, looking for the underlying meaning and significance of them all.

Virtually every scene in this superbly scripted and acted show is supercharged with crackling psychological intensity that engages the viewer, or at least this viewer, like no other program in memory. And, while ""In Treatment"" is arguably a little, or maybe more than a little, melodramatic in its depiction of what goes on in typical therapy, I think it's pretty realistic in its vivid portrayal of the bewilderingly complex, fluid nature of human psychodynamics, and a potent cautionary tale against exaggerated expectations for psychotherapists and their craft.

Judging from the first season, I think this is one of the finest and most unique shows in the history of American television, and I can't wait to start in on Season 2.",1442361600,,1899,5.0

3341982,5,B0013FSL0C,"As a certified therapist, a physician and a psychologist, I was curious to see how the writers were going to handle the subject. I was very impressed with the verisimilitude displayed by both the writers and the actors. Yes, Virginia, there is a therapeutic relationship just like the one shown here. Of course, a real practice has more than 5 patients and  a whole lot less drama each week but otherwise it's an accurate picture.

That's the good news. The bad news is that this excellent writing and acting  seem to take a progressively steeper decline as the seasons progress. 5 stars for season 1, 3-4 for season two, and 1 for season 3. I'd suggest you stop watching after the first season.

SPOILER ALERT:
this intelligent and competent therapist turns into a real jerk who listens less and talks more as the show goes on. By season 3, You will find your self throwing things at the TV.",1441065600,2,892,4.591194968553459

3341986,5,B0013FSL0C,"I love this show.
The stories are told in the context of psychiatric sessions, and have powerful acting, since there's so many dramatic monologues and interaction involved.  Each patient goes from initial introduction to some sort of resolution of the issues addressed in his/her story, sometimes good and sometimes tragic.  It's possible to learn a lot about psychiatry, and it's engrossing trying to figure out the reasons for the behaviors brought to treatment.
I'm also hooked on how the good doctor will ever find happiness, himself.  Like some of his patients, I too am in love with him!!!",1440979200,,595,5.051020408163265

If I had no knowledge of psychiatrists or therapists, I would be very reluctant to start treatment with one, due to the behavior of this one, Jack. He has a weak sense of boundaries in his family relationships, and with his patients.  His supervising psychiatrist also portrays a lack of boundaries in her supervision of Jack. This may be the way the system exists, in some locations, but it made me very uncomfortable. I know that there are those with appropriate limits and boundaries, and that potential doctors and therapists should be thoroughly scrutinized before meeting with them.

He enlist the support of his previous mentor , a retired psychologist to keep him in balance as he navigates the mucky waters of the ethical issues and boundaries clarifications  a therapist faces when confronted by patients who seek to entice them into crossing those clearly defined boundaries.

3342391,1,B0013FSL0C,"Barely made it through the first episode, and regretted hanging in there to finish it, as it never improved. Boring, one-dimensional, immature, unrealistic portrayal of therapy--plus. Gabriel Byrne apparently lacks the acting chops to pull off what is mostly a silent role--he's like a mannequin with a few lines. The character Laura goes on and on in lurid detail about a sexual encounter in a bar bathroom, which in real life any therapist would have redirected and challenged. Also, the actress decided to play it straight, when the only way to salvage that dialogue would be if she played it as trying to titillate and provoke the therapist. And in fact that would have created some much-needed tension in the interaction. Also ludicrous that the minute Laura confides her sexual obsession with the therapist that he wouldn't immediately explain that this is a common occurrence, it's called counter-transference, etc. etc. It's amazing that with a subject as potentially rich and compelling as therapy, they couldn't come up with even a decent first episode. I can't believe this lasted as a series.",1439164800,2,1104,5.104972375690608

3342394,2,B0013FSL0C,"Considering its immense potential for story lines, I found it sanctimonious and and formulaic. None of the characters (either their lines or their performances) drew me in and made me care about them one way or the other. The acting seemed to toggle between two modes: over-the-top crazy, beyond anything that the the subject matter warranted; or aloof disinterest as if the actors didn't want to be stuck in these roles and couldn't wait to go home.

DISCLAIMER: To be fair, I got so bored and turned off that I stopped watching it after two episodes. Maybe if I ever find myself even more bored than that, I'll give the series another chance. I would love an excuse to increase the number of stars I give it. But that's not likely to happen while so many other great choices exist.",1439078400,,783,4.5928571428571425

3342398,5,B0013FSL0C,"I'm nearly through the first season of ""In Treatment"" as of this writing after taking it in small doses, a show at a time every several days vs. blowing through a whole season in a day or two of binge watching. There's an almost claustrophobic quality to the show, each episode but one of which is a psychotherapy session set in the private office of the therapist around which the show revolves. The emotional charge of these exchanges in this relatively tight space, made all the more so by frequent close-ups on the actors, is a testament to the talent of those actors and of the writers of this show, but also lends it that closed-in, quality mentioned above. The most interesting and emotionally true pattern in these episodes is the lengths people will go to create and maintain self-deceiving thinking and behaviors on one hand, then run away from their own truth without looking back when their systems of self-deception collapse. This seems to be the message in ""In Treatment,"" and it is one that's well worth hearing.",1439078400,,1027,4.743016759776537

3342510,5,B0013FSL0C,"I happen to be a clinical psychology doctoral student and get very frustrated how the media incorrectly portrays psychotherapy. This is by far the closest representation of therapy. Now, I should be clear, the therapist in this series, Paul, is very psychodynamic, so please take that into consideration when I say closest representation. This is not a representation of CBT. So, not all psychotherapy appears to be similar to venting. I know a lot of other people who are not in the psychology field who love this show, as my tennis coach was the one who introduced me. It's very interesting and for sure captures some real themes encountered in therapy. For example in this season, transference is a very prominent theme. Also, even though episodes are only 30 minutes, there are over 40 in just this season alone. That is longer than most seasons with hour episodes. The acting is excellent. I found myself getting frustrated with a few of his clients in the sense that it was accurately depicting the issue/disorder. I promise this is not just for psychology nerds like me!

It is amazing, as others have noted, that an hour of psychotherapy is distilled into 30 minutes of very realistic and intense drama, mostly with two characters at a time and mostly in one room. The dramatic irony is off the charts in this series. As a client is speaking to an apparently objective therapist, the therapist registers only slight reactions, but we see through the client as he does. We also see when he slips up and how as a client himself, he falls prey to the same kinds of self-sabotage. We see how difficult it is to face reality. Evidence of exceptional talent is displayed in every episode as eyes and hands do so much of the acting.  Gabriel Byrne is a amazing.

So far, I've watched only the first season, and there are a lot of family dynamics that shape the people in session with this particular psychiatrist. Also we get to see how his issues as a child affect him as an adult as well, so I thought that was an interesting take on things. They show us that doctors are human too, and that issues that affect the rest of the world affect them as well. Good show! I would recommend it.",1437436800,,589,4.175438596491228

3342747,5,B0013FSL0C,"I'm late to the party, having only recently (in 2015) started watching this phenomenal series.  The way in which Gabriel Byrne embodies the character of Paul and allows -- through expression and mannerisms rather than words -- to gain insight into the complexities of human relationships and communication is stunning.  There are phenomenal acting performances all around, but Diane Wiest and the young actress who played Sophie were two stand-outs for me.

I am not in the profession, but have participated in counseling so I do feel that the process is accurately represented here even if the specific situations are foreign to me.  There aren't many TV shows that mine the territory of the human mind in this way.  Tension in most movies/shows is usually marked by violence, or acts of intentional destruction.  Or the impending threat of something bad happening.  Here it's more of a ""slow burn"" as you watch Paul de-construct his clients' thoughts and reactions, then volleys interpretations and questions back to them.

Watching this process is illuminating for the audience.  More than one episode has made me think, ""Hmmm.  How often do I put situations in someone else's hands and push them to make a decision so I don't have to be accountable?""  Particularly with Alex, you see the games people play to control situations and other people (i.e. the coffee machine) -- some of which may be charming or even flirtatious, but manipulative nonetheless.

There are troublesome elements here as well, such as the flaws Paul displays in his own life -- although they are strikingly real and I can understand why his wife comes to loathe him.  It's been well-established (and I agree) that Gabriel Byrne/Paul is a handsome man -- and I think it's relevant to the story (particularly in his relationship with Laura).  Selfishly, I do enjoy watching him night after night because he is do darn handsome.  Still, I had to suspend disbelief a bit much to accept that all his clients could be so physically attractive.  I realize this is TV after all, but it would have been interesting to see a few more ""average blokes.""",1436918400,,2119,4.910112359550562

It really wasn't necessary for the story lines & showed a lack of respect for the doctor, who later on used it himself.  It's a shame they have to express themselves using offensive language, as If they don't have better words in their vocabularies to describe their feelings.

3343161,5,B0013FSL0C,"Top notch.

Actors, writers, multi award winner. Authentic depiction of how a good therapist works and the toll his work takes on him and his life. A therapist is a human being who has taken years to develop his/her skills and to learn the meaning of confidentiality and client centered orientation.

Being human, Dr. Paul Weston wrestles with his own role as a person whom troubled people come to have their problems ""fixed."" He must help the patient understand that he can't fix anything. They must confront their own demons and make hard decisions as he gently and wisely gives them guidance. There must be a separation  a line that must not be crossed  between therapist and patient. Paul comes close to that line and briefly crosses it with a patient. We eavesdroppers come  as a result of great acting  to feel his emotions and his struggle to put this aside and think of what his patient's need, even as his own private life faces a crisis.

My primary career was as a physicist. Concurrent with my work in physics, I earned an advanced degree in counseling psychology. I practiced counseling for 10 years.

During my training, I had a few chances to sit behind a one-way window and observe a session. From playing the role of eavesdropper (viewer) to this process, I was able to observe other therapists working with diverse patients. I found that not all therapists have the same ways of approaching their clients. This is where the therapist's own background comes into play. ""In Treatment"" shows how one very skilled therapist has to face his own demons to be as helpful as possible. for his patients.

I wish I could have seen ""In Treatment"" years ago. It provides the one-way window that I had so few during my own training. If you are interested in watching a skillfully portrayed therapist through the one-way window that this HBO series provides, go for it.

 I am reviewing season 1, but have binge watched all 3 seasons and can attest to their quality
There are only a few top notch series available in reruns and this one deserves a place at the top. I highly recommend it.

Other than that, the show has some characters in the role of patient that are quite compelling.  I particularly liked the story of a young teen who comes in looking for an affidavit that she is reasonably stable and not trying to end her own life.  The process of getting her to see herself accurately was exceptionally well wrought.

The other characters in the first season are not nearly as sympathetic and thus, far less watchable.  Unfortunately, the writers also decide to put the therapist's life into a tailspin.  The construct (while interesting at first glance) fails to enhance the story line.  Thus, the general premise is interesting, but flawed.  When it works, it is remarkable.  When it does not... it simply collapses under its own weight.",1432944000,,908,4.726114649681529

3343323,5,B0013FSL0C,"Spectacular. When I first saw this and witnessed Mia Wasikowska explode off the screen I knew that Hollywood would be on her in a hurry; and that is exactly what has happened. All the episodes are excellent, particularly in the first two years but the ones involving Sophie (Mia) in the first year are something very special. This time I began by watching all of Mia's episodes, one after the other; and it is still as powerful as ever. Gabriel Byrne deserves special mention because without his understated portrayal the episodes could easily have fallen apart. Melissa George and Alison Pill, who was wonderful as Zelda Fitzgerald in ""Midnight in Paris,"" also deserve special mention. Why is it that the women seemed to stand out over the men? I have no idea, but they certainly did, and this includes Diane Wiest who was Byrne's shrink. The other night, I watched one of Mia's most recent films, ""Tracks,"" a true story about a woman hiking through the Outback with four camels. It richly convinces you that Mia's performance in ""In Treatment"" was just the beginning.",1432857600,,1069,4.815217391304348

3343328,5,B0013FSL0C,"First of all, I have to confess that this review was pretty much provoked by reading the rather insignificant amount of ""negative"" comments regarding such a wonderful piece of television.

The arguments I read were mostly circling around two trains of thought:
1) ""I couldn't even get through the first ___ minutes. Oh my God, where is the action in this thing, it can't get any more boring than this...""
2) ""Oh, it is such a clich. Me, as therapist, would do something entirely different...and blah blah...""

Please don't pay any attention to such arguments. Well, let me get a little bit more precise: If your inner dialogue is as vast as a McDonald's commercial, please refrain yourself to even TRY this series. You WILL get bored. You WON'T feel any sort of empathy with any of the characters, either. And, given the fact you DON'T really have any conversations with yourself, please LIBERATE US from your excuses regarding that very subject.

This show is just AMAZING. Any way you'd like to interpret it, deception is simply impossible. Now, this is no ""Game of Thrones"" or ""Bold and Restless"" kind of sh! t. It will take you at least ONE FULL SEASON to engage with the characters (particularly if you've never been committed to REAL therapy yourself). NEWSFLASH: The very REASON you won't feel committed to such characters is ALSO part of the storyline. Because, you know, PATIENTS NORMALLY QUIT. Resistance is a HUGE issue regarding therapy, of course. And ACTUALLY TELLING THE TRUTH to your therapist (or yourself, for that matter) takes a great deal of trial and error.

(SPOILER ALERT)
If you FALL for the OBVIOUS plotline about Gabriel Byrne (SPOILER ALERT) feeling ATTRACTED by one of his patients, you will probably need a whole new scale to measure your stupidity. Having SEXUAL transferences with a therapist is just as NORMAL as it is PREDICTABLE. Therapy success is actually pretty much tied to those who can OVERCOME such SILLY ideas and meet themselves face to face. The remaining excuses (such as: ""oh, that was too deep"" or ""ooh, that was too boring"") are just irrelevant and dumb.

Inner dialogue's a witch. Really. But lacking such a thing is pretty much unthinkable to many of the human beings I've known. Anyhow, detractors of this show haven't even given more than 30 minutes to the entire storyline and its storytellers to develop and/or engage you. That, people, is usually THIER fault.

As your attorney, I advise you to WATCH A FULL SEASON before even considering writing a review. Stupid or not, positive or negative. Matter of fact is that character in this show are so DAMN real, it takes them a whole new season to APPROVE therapy in their lives. And that is just the beginning. Gabriel Byrne is superb. And so are their supporting actors as well.",1432425600,,2782,4.809623430962343

The lines start to blur between helping his patients and letting his feelings about them color his judgement. Every episode you can watch him work brilliantly to help his patients and see him cross ethical and professional boundaries as he reacts to the challenges his patients bring: a young woman in love with him, a couple who wants him to pick sides, a hostile Navy airman, and a gymnast who isn't honest about whether she tried to kill herself. Every week includes a session with his supervisor, Gina, nicely played by Diane Wiest, with whom Paul has a conflictual relationship, as he reluctantly starts seeing her, realizing he needs help but not ready to to make any changes yet. Paul's marriage is falling apart and he is middle aged, finding him at the top of his game as a psychotherapist while he loses touch with his family and becomes estranged from his better instincts. Every episode is well-paced and relies on the drama of the interpersonal relationships and the tension of what is said and not said. Well worth the time.",1431302400,2,1163,4.791044776119403

The quality and intensity of the acting is amazing. Watching these therapy sessions is like watching a slow motion train wreck. Byrne's character is humanized by revealing his human shortcomings and his struggle to maintain professional standards and his all too human reactions to his patients, which he must control.

My only problem is that these episodes are a few years old and Amazon Prime expects paid customers to pay for seasons 2 and 3. At least season 1 has over three and a half dozen episodes. But, come on Amazon!!

I enjoyed the ability of both the patient and and the doctor to say whatever was on their mind without the world falling apart like it would be in a family situation.  So truths are shared and looked at honestly.  The doctor had such patience with his patients but not with his wife, so his own marriage was falling apart.  He and his wife went to therapy and that was helpful to them, although the change in the doctor's attitude toward his wife, and hers toward her husband seemed almost unbelievably non negotiable.
 Since I was witnessing what he was going through, minute by minute, I had a lot of compassion for him and wished that his wife would be able to soothe him. It reminded me of the joke about the shoemakers kids who had holes in their shoes.  In life a marriage partner should be treated like a friend but most people find this hard to do and, unfortunately, let hurts overtake the focus of their life.  He had no patience or affection for his wife and that was sad.
A marriage needs to be nourished and it distressed me that his marriage was on the rocks.  There were many episodes to watch, and I, as a viewer, felt that I was in the room during the therapy sessions.  I did not like the sexy young female patient that the therapist fell in love with. There were ethical and moral concerns and his humanity and values were a struggle for him ... and I won't tell you the ending.  See the movie.",1430006400,,1446,4.365671641791045

3343418,5,B0013FSL0C,"Wonderfully realistic series of psychoanalytic sessions focusing on about four patients and psychologist Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) who might be a little too good for the real world, but his insights as well as his foibles make him an endearing character. Patients typically come for a problem that they have externalized from themselves, so they are in effect dodging the issue and often become defensive as Dr Weston guides them skillfully toward seeing the true interior nature of their problem, at which point they enjoy some psychic relief. Transference proves to be a common problem in the therapeutic process, and <i>In Treatment</i> derives drama and conflict from transference as the attractive, paternal shrink struggles to deal with the patient's affections.",1429401600,,770,5.425

3343433,2,B0013FSL0C,"I appear to be in the minority on this one.  This truly is an ambitious project with incomparable talent, but for this viewer, very little rings true -- especially the dialogue, which is stilted, illogical at times, and overly dramatic..The script seems better suited to theatre where the actors could have emoted to the rafters while rending their garments and beating their breasts to great effect.  I blame the writers -- each entirely responsible for his/her ""patient's""  episodes.  (Which may explain why Byrne's character sometimes seems to lack continuity from patient to patient.)  They should have done their homework about what truly goes behind those closed doors.  (And Laura a doctor?  Seriously?  The writers could have fooled me.)  Melissa George's performance, sadly, was close to amateurish, as if she skipped rehearsals and just showed up for filming.

When push came to shove, I simply didn't care about any of the characters, and actually was repelled more often than not.

Dianne Wiest gets 5 stars, and her true-to-life performance is the only reason this viewer stayed with it long after losing interest.  Still, it wasn't enough to enable me to see it through to the end.",1429228800,,1195,5.0717948717948715

3343435,5,B0013FSL0C,"An intriguing psychological drama. Good writing, and strong performances by supporting cast. But in my opinion Gabriel Byrne gives an absolutely outstanding performance as a therapist struggling to treat his own patients, all while confronting his marital and family problems, and seeking (and not always accepting) advice and a constructive dialogue with his former mentor. Byrne's impressive acting ability is showcased in this powerful drama. He creates a character who is intelligent, thoughtful and truly loves analyzing and helping his patients. But at the same time, he struggles with his own marriage and other personal issues, and at times has difficulty seeing in his own personal life things he finds obvious while counseling others. If you want lots of action, this show is not for you. But the interractions of the characters with Byrne's character and all the dynamics that take place make for an addictive experience.",1429228800,,932,5.346938775510204

What I am not enjoying is this tortured soul/god-complex this therapist seems to be suffering from. Its a contradiction and gets a little old. His temper tantrums get old. But then, we humans are multi-faceted and complex.

This show will definitely not be everyone's cup of tea.  If you don't enjoy thinking,  if you are not interested in how people's minds work - how frustrating and complicated people and their relationships are you will be bored or confused by what happens to the characters.  My first thought was that it must be terrible to be a psychotherapist.  What Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) goes through with his patients is traumatic for everyone involved.  Then you get to see Paul Weston with his therapist.  What an incredibly clever idea for a drama!  The acting is superb.  You feel for these characters.  Many times you dislike them or want to bang their heads together. Sometimes it is difficult to watch. But you find yourself rooting for them to find their way. If you like a lot of physical action you won't find it here.  About 4/5 of the show takes place in one room and the room itself almost becomes one of the characters.  The plot, like life, is completely unpredictable and there were no happily ever afters. Just, if lucky, another chance to try again tomorrow.",1427328000,2,1256,4.612612612612613

3343515,5,B0013FSL0C,""" In Treatment"" is the very best series I have ever watched. To begin with it breaks the main rule of television by displaying a series that is all conversation and body language on a medium that is built for action and motion.
The writing is superb. It is engaging and involves the viewer in the lives of the characters to an extent that the viewer feels the he or she is a third party to the discussions between patient and psychologist.
Also, the brevity of each episode is perfect in that it ends in that ideal time between wanting more and getting too much.
Most highly recommended.

3343516,5,B0013FSL0C,"I saw this when it was originally broadcast and loved it then.  In viewing it again, the performances are so nuanced and the story line even richer than I remember.  Gabriel Byrne received an Emmy nomination for his performance, which was well deserved. Others in the very tight and highly talented cast, have continued to give stellar performances as they have moved to other projects.

The pilot in the second episode is so irritating I wanted to punch in the TV screen.  If I'd been the analyst I would have told him that he was in the military and as an officer and a pilot should be setting an example for the others in his unit, so suck it up and get out of my office!  I wouldn't have even accepted him as a patient!  If these episodes are based on real therapy sessions I don't know how any therapist has the patience to put up with these whiners.  The show's concept is original and somewhat interesting, but the characters, aside from the therapist, are so annoying I would say that this show is an acquired taste.",1426982400,,813,4.2745098039215685

3343555,5,B0013FSL0C,"Interesting idea, to watch others' therapy as entertainment--and it works, in no small part due to the humanness of Gabriel Byrne. Engrossing and real, we see the psychotherapist's world in full: not only his sessions with  clients, but also Byrne's family and internal conflicts, his ability to compartmentalize (or not), and his own therapy with a former mentor/nemesis, played beautifully by Dianne West. Superb contributions by Michelle Forbes as Gabriel's wife, and by Mia Wasikowska, Blair Underwood, Josh Charles, Embeth Davidtz, and Melissa George as clients in season 1.

3343565,4,B0013FSL0C,"I'm only 75% of the way through season 1, but so far I have to say that the acting is top-notch across the board. The series is light on action, and heavy on dialogue, as it is set in a psychiatrists' office, and doesn't use flashbacks to show the episodes the patients discuss. So, although they are given high quality scripts to work with, most of the responsibility of creating the drama falls to the actors. Their delivery of the dialogue is great, but, for me, the best acting takes place in the silences between the words. In some ways, such as the minimal set changes, and the compactness of the space used, this series seems like it would be better suited to the stage, but it is in those silences that it takes advantage of the cameras ability to pick up amazingly subtle changes in facial expressions that are the essence of acting. So why only 4 stars? Sometimes it's so emotionally intimate, that it's almost uncomfortable to watch, which may be less of a critique, and more of an indication that I need to come to terms with my own voyeuristic tendencies. I'll have to ask my therapist.",1426377600,,1099,4.5

I keep wishing to see the characters just talk normally and do normal daily things after their therapy sessions.  So maybe the fault there is my own expectations.  But it would be interesting to see the characters act differently or become more functional somehow in the other parts of their lives, say, after having some kind of insight or breakthrough in a session. Oh, well.  Guess I'll just have to buy the following series to see if this idea has already been actualized by the writer in the characters' futures.",1425945600,,675,4.717948717948718

I've always like Gabriel Byrne. He handles his roll well. Sometimes I think he asks too many questions, but this is a TV series, not real life events. The producers and writers have to keep things moving. The patients/characters are whacked, but very much in a believable way. So far they've all portrayed their characters beautifully.

Naturally, this is baloney, but some of the other things about the show are a bit much. Any shrink that attacks a patient should lose their license or be put in jail. This is very unrealistic as it is just passed by. Next, the show certainly gives the message that any & all teenagers are rutting like dogs in heat with anyone they can. Not very realistic either. Some of the  sessions get pretty tedious & boring, but such is analysis. I'd say it is a fairly good series, but not that realistic. I've seen shrinks since I was a little kid as my late mom was seriously bi-polar. All of the sex crap in these supposed sessions never came up w/ us. Not a word about it. The various shrinks never attacked us either. Anyway, I'd give it about a C grade. The most interesting sessions are w/ the nutty teenage gal that is trying out for the Olympics for gymnastics.

3343722,3,B0013FSL0C,"If you're interested in Psychology or Sociology you might like this. However, it's a quiet talk-y show, no action.
  I'm almost done w/Season 1 - watching it on a friend's Prime account. This is an interesting show. It was slow going for me and I wasn't sure if I wanted to continue. I hated the first and second episodes because ""Laura"" is all useless drama and ""Alex"" in the second episode made me want to punch him. But then the show started getting interesting and now I'm almost done.
  Excellent performances!! The acting in this show is STELLAR.
  This is a slow burner of a show, but if you're interested human behavior it will hold your attention. You're going to hate some of the characters and relate to others. I bet if you're honest with yourself you could find a little bit (or a lot a bit) of yourself in each character, including Paul, the therapist. I hated Alex... omg I many times I wanted to skip over his episodes - what a toxic character!! I started to chill out about him really late in the season, in week six, when he started getting real and being honest for once. Didn't have much interest in the couple (although I love Josh Charles (from The Good Wife)) mostly because their relationship is awful and unproductive and totally childish, I just had such little patience for them, but the episodes are only 30 mins so I watched their sessions anyway. I could relate with a lot of ""Laura""'s feelings about herself in relationships and a lot of what she said resonated with me.
  But ""Sophie"" was really the character I felt a complete affinity for as she reminds me so much of myself in so many ways - I got very invested in her, completely felt her pain and totally understood her reactions to things, it was like looking in a mirror. The actress Mia Wasikowski and the writers of the show did an amazing and frighteningly accurate job writing for the ""Sophie"" character and Mia delivered a very touching, honest performance. I think it was ""Sophie's"" story that kept me watching this show.
  I've never been in therapy before, although should have been during many crucial times in my life but somehow made it out without it. I tried 2 different therapists in the past but couldn't trust strangers so I quit. So, I'm unfamiliar with the process and certainly not one to judge ""Paul""'s process, or approach, but I felt like there were some holes in how he handled things. He didn't establish boundaries with his patients, especially the ""Alex"" character, and I felt he should have terminated that relationship as soon as Alex started invading his privacy and becoming belligerent and antagonizing. Plus, how do therapists sit there all day listening to people's self absorption, petty dramas, narcissism and egos? I suppose that's par for the course to get to the root of their pain and suffering.

3343724,4,B0013FSL0C,This series for me started kind of slow.  It is well acted but the down side of this series is that only the first season is free with Amazon Prime.  Why?  This is not a new show.  I'm not interested enough to pay for all the episodes,1421020800,,234,3.9148936170212765

3343726,2,B0013FSL0C,It became more and more interesting as the characters were developed but then we noticed a trend that the Lords name was being used in vain more and more frequently.  We stopped watching as it became rather offensive.  Not sure why movie and TV producers feel it necessary to result to such language.  The show could have been written without this language and simply used vulgar language fitting to the characters without using blasphemy.,1420761600,,439,4.905405405405405

3343740,4,B0013FSL0C,"I've watched the first 10 episodes.  It's an original series and the actors are first rate (interesting choices by the way). The 1/2 hour format works well here.  It's an absorbing series: you are introduced to several characters with varied problems (fighter pilot, teenage Olympic-hopeful gymnast, couple-in-crisis) who are deeply in denial about what the real problem is and their contributions to the problem(s). Byrne's performance is on point, believable, and his therapeutic responses to these clients ring true.  That being said, there is a reluctance on my part to watch more episodes because I don't really like any of the characters. They're all angry, selfish, and self-absorbed (of course that's often the hallmark of people who are in crisis and turn to therapy), and Byrne is downright nasty and ugly in his interactions with his ""mentor"", Diana Wiest.  It says something, however that I've written this much about the show so, now I feel obligated to watch a few more episodes to see if some of the characters resolve their issues and become better people as a result. 8-)",1420243200,2,1088,5.027777777777778

3343758,5,B0013FSL0C,"I watched only the episodes with Alex. I found the acting to be intense. Gabriel Byrne does an excellent job with his character refraining from giving direction to Drew Bledsoe. Bledsoe plays Alex to perfection. Totally in denial about having any problems for all of the episodes, he dodges all of Byrnes' attempts to get him to face a real issue. He is living his life on the edge. He is not the least bit centered, but he thinks that he is totally in control until near the final episode. However, his emotions and tears cannot overcome his need to be perfectly in control. The final episode brings the whole of Alex together. Let me say no more.",1419897600,,648,4.5

In a way they are all separate story lines explained by patients seeking counseling. The deep part is that each story is reflected on the psychologist's life, Paul. At times it can be hard to bear but if you are into things that trigger unfamiliar thoughts and take you to places that that deep then probably this is a good choice for you.",1419292800,,511,4.446808510638298

Thoughtful, compelling, mature, insightful windows into the complex/ troubled worlds of some very interesting personalities. The only (minor) negative: in two or three episodes in which the lead character is joined by his wife in a session with another analyst, he behaves uncharacteristically and insipidly clueless about how to deal with his wife's infidelity. Yes, I know that the intent is to demonstrate that no matter how well we might understand other's problems, we are all prone to being ignorant about our own issues.

Even the length of the sessions is realistic. The problems of the patients may be a bit extreme, but perhaps not. The sessions of the analyst with his ""retired"" supervisor were quite well done and believable as well.

There is much value here that anyone can benefit from, even if none of the situations these patients find themselves in is directly applicable.  It is the process of analysis that is valuable, much food for thought!

Some of the language is a bit hard to take, but in a therapy session you are free to say anything you like, I guess it's just part of the realism.",1416614400,,714,4.435114503816794

Great series with high quality acting that really simulates therapy sessions but the behind-the-scenes enactments of the therapist's life and his own relationship makes it feel like a) he is very troubled, too troubled almost to be helping people;  b) it's good to see his human side, but his ethical boundaries are not as strong as they should be;  c) all of this is done to sensationalize and dramatize the show which breaks you away from losing yourself in the reality of it;  d) the obligatory HBO sex is there but almost all of it comes out only in verbal description which made me happy;  e) I'm still trying to understand how he could fall in love with the person that he fell in love with---it really makes him look self-unaware and ""immature;"" as does e) the types of squabbles he has with his own therapist.

I suspend disbelief, and accept that he is a troubled man and still really like the show, particularly Gabriel Byrne and Diane Wiest.

I found the characters believable and distinct from each other. However, at times, I felt as impatient as the characters with the lack of progress they had made in actually changing their actions.

This is rather cerebral entertainment. If you enjoy salacious sex scenes, violence and the adrenaline rush of action scenes, this series will probably not interest you. If you are interested in human motivations, triumph over heart-rending experiences, and human failures, you may enjoy this series. I repeat, the acting is wonderful!

concerns, the mistakes, the doubts expressed to himself by the protagonist. All absolutely exist, and are covered within training on ethics.  The tough story for me was Alex---I wanted to watch this again years later to see how early the therapist was clued in to his situation---and was pleased to be reminded he noted it almost immediately.

It also presents the emotional turmoil in his life as he has a friend who is a renown psychologist  and tries to help him. The patients range  from a teenager to an army pilot,and include  couples therapy. It starts out rather slow, but each time a layer of the emotional state of each is uncovered and the drama of their stories is presented.

The Doctor is fascinating because he seems utterly incapable of seeing flaws in himself. The patients are annoying, but very true to real patients in a therapy session (from what I know). Almost all of the patients resent paying a professional to listen to their worst fears and personal problems, but that is what makes it interesting to watch, and (to add another conjuntion) it is exactly what makes this program fascinating. Many episodes are worth skipping, but in season one the girl playing the young gymnasts really shines. I deplored the acting from most of the adult actors. The doctor and HIS therapist are some of the most interesting of the adult only sessions.

His own issues play out with each of the patients, usually for better but sometimes for worse. Don't let my title suggest that one should view this as an example of ""how to do psychotherapy."" Definitely NOT. Nevertheless, it still can illuminate how therapy is different from other types of relationships and social interactions. But, to get maximum appreciation of that, unless you actually are a psychotherapist, it would be heuristic to read some classics, such as Sullivan's The Psychiatric Interview or almost anything of Freud, or Erickson or Erikson (Milton or Erik) while following this and subsequent seasons, if you are not familiar with orthodox and ""proper"" therapist behavior. There's probably a wikipedia article on it, too, but some therapy classics are worth reading on their own. That way so you will catch the ""story"" part of this - the deviations - as distinguished from the ""reality"" aspect. The supervisor, Dianne Wiest, also fits into the complex psychological structure, differently from the way the patients do, and gives an additional insight into the struggles Paul faces both as person and as doctor. If you don't have (or take my suggestion to get) an educated perspective on therapy and supervision, it still makes a good story, but you're missing an opportunity to learn something about one of the key paradigms of our times.",1412121600,,1465,5.108333333333333

Since I am not a mental health professional I really don't know if the therapy was realistic or not. But seemed to go along the lines of how I would imagine it to be. Supporting cast was easy to believe and plots were well thought out. Now for the two star rating. Typical media content ploy. I have seen it on other sites too and I am a little sick of it. "" Unlimited streaming of TV and movies"", yeah right!  Watched season one and was hooked. Couldn't wait to start the other two seasons. WRONG! Oh we forgot to tell you that after giving you a taste of the series, now you have to buy the other two! I should have known. Sure puts a bad taste in your mouth when content suppliers.

I was so totally impressed by a young girl playng the part of a young gymnast who at (I think 14 or 15) had a sexual relationship with her coach and also an eating disorder plus suicidal tendencies. Just thinking how difficult it would be for a young actor to ""Act"" this role with such complete authenticity. Such difficult, confusing, dark and painful material and this young actor just NAILS IT. There are even scenes where no words are spoken but we just see her face as she listens to very challenging truths from her therapist and we get to see her emotions flash across her face, even with just her eyes alone. To have such awareness of self and skills at such a young age to control the look of ones eyes to convey a point in a script ..... Truly brilliant acting. The other patients are equally convincing I think I praise the young female actor most not because she was better but because she is so young. One at least hopes, she has not had the years to have experienced such complex and painful emotions which makes her ability to ""Act"" them so accurately just that much more impressive.. This show (while often dark and difficult material) is some of the best acting I think I have seen. Incredibly difficult material rendered perfectly.",1409443200,,1347,4.570247933884297

3344234,5,B0013FSL0C,"This show is an amazing accomplishment, and could be useful as a highly dramatized educational tool.

Most of the time when a character on a TV show visits the psychologist's office, it's to serve some arbitrary character development, usually to showcase some kind of weakness.  The thing I adore about ""In Treatment"" is its grounded approach.  Instead of offering up advice and a pity party, we see patient-led psychology sessions, which tends to be how these things go in real life.

Certainly, it's a drama -- meant to keep a viewer interested -- but if you're willing to buy into the premise, this show never breaks your trust.  I always found it grounded and believable.  There's been much discussion on whether the characters are ""likable"" or not, but I find that I don't care about that so much for this series.  The drama is involving and if you're trying to tell me that there aren't people out there who act just like this cast of patients do, you don't know people.  Sometimes characters are aggravating, just as they are in real life, but half of the drama is the way in which Gabriel Byrne's character handles it all.

I hate to throw around the word ""intelligent,"" because people will say that about any show they like that they view as under-rated.  I don't use it to describe most TV programs, because understanding a TV program -- even with an ensemble cast like Game of Thrones -- is never about intelligence, but passion.  Anyone can understand it on some level.  To that end, I maintain that anyone can understand this show on some level, but I would like to use the word ""intelligent"" in how it is all written, because of its grounded approach.  Lots of care went into the making of this program, and it absolutely earns my highest recommendation.",1409184000,2,1768,4.664516129032258

The season follows 4 ppl in therapy seeing the same therapist for 9 weeks so there's like 40 episodes per season. About 1/2 way thru the season the therapists' life starts to unravel so he then starts to see a therapist too. It's a five star show  but Amazon messed that up by making the 1st season free (prime) but then charging $$ for seasons 2&3! Why?? It's a 6yr old show for cryin' out loud, it's not like it's still on the air!! I'm not going to pay Amazon  $80 to watch season 2... I already paid that for my prime membership!

I really like Gabriel Byrne and so I attempted to watch this program.  If handled intelligently and placed in context counseling could be a fascinating basis for storytelling. And I think Byrne would make a great therapist.  Well this show certainly gets the storytelling right.  Close up views of the characters' faces, a bedroom audio atmosphere and explicit details of their inner most impulses and desires amid drab settings lead the viewer along a trail of worn out post modernist cliches that eventually just pile up until I had to turn it off and escape.",1408838400,,673,4.982142857142857

Perhaps a bit over focused on the combative side of therapy, but I understand that it makes for good verbal sparring from a dramatic aspect.  I was really enjoying the show and considered it first-class, but was very disappointed when the therapy took a turn for poor boundaries between the male therapist and his female client, which is probably realistic, but just too disheartening, and I lost heart in watching the show, moving on to something less depressing and disappointing.",1408752000,,606,5.163265306122449

All too common a problem with therapists. I do like the way he handled it in the end though. This is a show that you must watch from the beginning to see how the patients progress in their therapy.

Not only that, but the acting is so superb that the patients and therapists seem totally real; one might think the series is more a documentary than a fabricated drama.  Each patient is developed carefully and provided with a script that is sometimes painfully real and always stunningly articulate.  The same is true of the therapists.

3344346,5,B0013FSL0C,Gabriel Byrne plays the troubled therapist to perfection. His understated delivery communicates the anguish and loneliness experienced by psychotherapists around the world. His own therapy dovetails realistically into the suffering of his patients. Juxtaposing the sacrifices his family makes with the struggles of his patients is a well developed subtext.  His own therapist deserves a spin off series of her own. Each episode leaves me wanting to know more.,1407369600,,459,5.6521739130434785

Apart from the once a week marriage guidance sessions the dramatic drive is carried by just two persons in very intense interactions between patient and therapist, or therapist and wife and two of his children. And even the marriage guidance is often just one on one.

The young Australian actress Wasikowska steals the entire first series with a career- making ensemble performance of great intensity, authenticity and brilliant portrayal. Also very clever is inclusion of the doctor's own weekly therapy/counseling sessions with his former mentor, as his own doubts and conflicts are exposed. And his own self deception, as we see both the event he is characterizing and his miss-characterization of the event to his former mentor.

Brilliant.

The acting is very high quality from everyone. Utterly believable and compelling.",1406937600,,1098,5.257142857142857

I find it intriguing, but I reserve that final star because I do feel as though there are too many sexual references, and I am not really impressed by that particular method of attracting viewers.  There could be the intimacy and the intrigue without the sexual details and it would be far more cerebral and less erotic.  That would make it a five star program, in my opinion.  It is truly interesting that the therapist seems to have quite limited insight into his own miseries, and yet seems adequate in understanding his clients.",1406160000,,606,4.688679245283019

The only thing that upset me was as a Prime member I anxiously went to Season 2 and you have to pay to watch. At 32 shows or more a season can't afford that.

(another major point for Amazon prime just when we thought it had reached a plateau)  In treatment is an interesting prospective with some incredible acting (for most of the season). But, just when say to yourself Amazon rocks!! you start season two and you are reminded that everyone is trying to get us use to a pay per episode model (the old Apple store model that has come to a halt-Has Hollywood not learned form the music industry model-its not working...). I can see some of us wanting to pay for a season of a show that we absolutely loved and want to keep a copy in our every growing digital garage. Most of us loathe cable companies and will gladly pay Amazon for access to this content. But,  at least this family is not likely to dish out a per episode charge.

I found myself needing to take breaks before returning for more of the sad and miserable lives of these people.  I felt that the acting was superb, especially by Blair Underwood and Melissa George from season one (the only season I have watched).  I was intrigued by the length and fluidity through which scenes played out with flawless editing to the eye.

3344473,4,B0013FSL0C,"A quiet, but fascinating series that chronicles the therapy sessions of several patients, including the doctor himself. Each day of the week is devoted to a single session, so the series enacts a typical week for therapist, Dr. Paul Weston (played with patience and occasional tense rancor by Gabriel Byrne). Each Friday is dedicated to Weston's own therapy with his former mentor, Dr. Gina Toll (the ever amazing Dianne Wiest). We see him and his patients through their personal struggles, their conflicts with one another, and their epiphanies about their own choices and situations. The acting is sublime and the casting choices are impeccable. My only criticism is that there is something predictable about the show and its pacing. I haven't seen beyond this first season, but it's fairly easy to predict how each character will react to Weston's theories about his or her problems. Every character at one time or another questions Weston's abilities as a therapist, and he is quick to lobby such criticism at Toll, as well. I assume it's typical for patients to resist the therapist's assessments, especially if they feel vulnerable, or see his remarks as less-than-flattering, so this is meant to add to the show's authenticity. This is a small criticism for a show that is otherwise intelligent, brilliantly conceived, and well acted. I highly recommend it. I only wish the other two seasons were available through Amazon Prime, as this will very likely deter me from watching the entire series.",1405123200,,1502,5.08502024291498

Lots of people are angry-- but not all of them all the time-- as depicted here.  Still the acting is wonderful, the dialogue is interesting, and the structure of seeing people in therapy from one week to another is fascinating in seeing them progress (or not) as the case may be.  It is also interesting how the patients interpret their therapist's comments.

A lot of people don't believe in getting help for their issues and society does not look well on the topic of therapy as they should.  We have seen a lot of what can happen in this world when people feel they are not heard.  I was especially glad to see it released on prime from Amazon.  Even though I own the series, I still enjoy streaming the show so that I don't have to pull out my movies and put them back.  If you haven't seen this series, check it out.

Gabriel Byrne deserves an award @ least an Emmy for his performance as a therapist.  And the winner is.....................................Gabriel Byrne hands down.

I for one, fall asleep in action movies where things blow up for no reason, not kidding I do fall asleep, ask my friends. If you are like me, watch this. As for the professionals who object to Paul's ethics, they are possibly right but who cares? I'd take him over my impersonal, 'll l critically correct therapist .

He's so fine an actor, and writing was great, story lines were wonderful.  There's such a shortage of good programming on that it's a shame.

Thank God that HBO's still running a lot of good shows now; most I consider excellent, like Game of Thrones, for example.  Too bad True Blood ran off the tracks a little bit (was it the Maynad and related??!!), but I will be very, very sorry to see it go.  The most wonderful part about TB was the romance between Sookie and Bill.  Once that was over, or went crazy, the show lost a lot of fans and punch.

Outstanding acting on the part of the actress who plays 'Laura'.

I am surprised the concept of 'transference' wasn't mentioned since that is common in therapy.

I think the therapist is vulnerable to come-ons from clients; his own marriage appears strained.

As an observant Jew, our tradition cautions against being secluded in an enclosed space with a member of the opposite sex.

I did not watch the conclusion of that case in season 1.

The problem was that I would have expected more progress into the patient's story lines. Instead once the characters are presented and enough information given so I had a good idea what the problems were they were seeking therapy for, they just STAY there, very little forward motion. Became so boring  I quit in the middle of episode 12 after 15 minutes of the episode discussing a coffee maker. Now I know the point was that it wasn't really about a coffeemaker, it was what it represented, but I found myself thinking, ""all right, I get it already, could you move it along now?"" So, 3 stars for the great acting of the characters even though their situations rapidly became static. 1 for the lack of any dynamic development.

My problem with it is that it's filled with contrivances and cliches... leaving pills in the bathroom so we can have a suicide attempt scene, the patient falling in love with the therapist, the depressed teenager, the gay-but-in-denial military man, etc. Considering the high rating of the series it seems that I'm one of the few viewers who are actually annoyed by these flaws. Maybe I'm just being a nitpicker. If you're anything like me, I would suggest going in with low expectations and being moderately pleased with the results.",1402963200,,662,4.972972972972973

It is truly a wonderful show..so please watch further than the first episode..it may come off kind of dull..but once you adjust to how its written and handled..you really will enjoy it. What brought me here was my love for Josh Charles aka ""Will Gardner"" from The Good Wife..which coincidentally is my #1 favorite and can be see here as well...and so far he is wonderful here. Your heart will hurt for ""little"" Sophie...what a tremendous young actress..and I have even gotten a crush on Paul..the lead played by Gabriel Byrne...or maybe its both! The show is excellent and Im only 1/3 into the first season!!",1402876800,,719,4.669291338582677
3344587,5,B0013FSL0C,Excellent cast. Real life story lines. Complex human intertwined life issues and problems. Evokes discussions with others who view the series with differing points of view expressed. For mature audience. Not light hearted. Deep plots that provoke deep thought not only about the characters but about your life and that of your family and friends. Recommend for those interested in serious at times disturbing real to life with real character actor story lines.,1402790400,,460,5.315068493150685
3344588,5,B0013FSL0C,I loved the way the therapist's  professional ethics become involved and how different counseling theories were demonstrated. It is a great way to show how intense sessions with a client can get and how attached you become with clients. It is also a great instrument to use for people wanting to go into therapy but scared to do so. It takes guts to put yourself outhere in front of another human being and tell them about your hidden self. The freedom of having done so and seek to find you own answers along with a therapist to guide you is invaluable to self understanding. I loved it!,1402704000,,588,4.4953271028037385

First, what's not to love about Gabriel Byrne? Second, to like this show you must be seeking cerebral and emotional stimulation. You will discover what makes different types of people act the way they do, and the answers may surprise you.  Preconceived notions have no place here. Superbly acted and written. Masterfully placed pregnant pauses. You can almost feel the struggles within.

Now put Season 2 and 3 on Prime!",1402617600,,557,4.842105263157895

Turning rocky fields into smooth landscapes is hard work, and there are plenty of ruts and  stumps  that need clearing before the paths are smooth.

3344640,4,B0013FSL0C,"I loved this series, but anything about psychotherapy that doesn't involve pills, ECT treatments, and a horrible psycho ward, may not be everyone's idea of entertaining television. This drama centers around talking and human emotions, and you really get to know each patient (NO I'M NO IN THE THERAPY BUSINESS), over a period of sessions. Sometimes, it can be slow -- and there are some story lines I didn't particularly care for, nor did I find them especially believable (I won't mention which as that would require I give away a major plot line).

The acting is absolutely superb, with kudos to Gabriel Bryne Michele Forbes, Dianne Wiest; but the real star of Series 1 is Mia Waskiowska, as the young gymnast.

It is possible to watch select episodes and still follow the series -- so if you find you don't like a particular patient story, you can watch the Pilot (you sort of have to), and then select the episodes that are about the patient or patients you find most interesting. I actually watched the full series when it ran on HBO.

Some had even been sexually abused.  On the bright side, Gabriel Byrne is smashing as a therapist.  Mostly on account of the strength of the two performances, I gave it a high score.

3344648,4,B0013FSL0C,"Ask yourself if you can really help anyone if you live in a bubble? This question presented in Season 1, Episode 40, Paul & Gina, week 8.

Interesting are these two, Gabriel Byrne, an Irishman and Dianne Wiest, an American with Scottish roots, both about the same age and of my own generation, within a decade.  Even more ironic is the writers and producers all appear to be Israelis.  (I grew up in California, Hawaii and Israel). Anyone my age who has done time in the therapist office will recognize some of these scenes. I get the personal impression this is an Anglo interpretation of a Jewish occupation: psychotherapy which has become something else in about one generation.

Gina invites Paul to look at his own perceptions of her. He has known her for decades. Or has he? Does he know HER? Or has he created a version her that fits what he needs her to be? Like a caricature, a cartoon? What do we really know about each other? Are all therapists actors, emotional, impulsive, with unresolved childhood issues who need the persona, the character they play to be controlled? Because they are struggling along with their patients, as much as their patients are with the same issues? Are the therapists USING the therapy for themselves? Is it a cult, this psychotherapy? A business? A racket? All of the above? Is it a religion? Does it only work if all parties believe in it? Only if it includes love, intimacy but not physical touch? Does it hasten divorces & suicides? Does it ever really lead to true love? Is there such a thing? Like the ever-elusive holy grail this search for truth and meaning is explored with refreshingly honest questions without answers.

I cannot say that therapy helps. I cannot even be sure whether it has helped me in my past, although I spent many years involved in various forms of therapy before rejecting it. It fills a need, an emptiness, a quest for meaning. And in a way, these films do the same thing. They show us these unmet needs, these longings, these perceptions of failure and self-punishment are universal.",1401580800,,2058,4.6740331491712706

The series is indeed action-packed, with intrigue, surprises along the way, sad endings and happy endings, but it is not in a physical way. IOt is all about dialogue; all the sessions take place in the therapist's office, expertly and empathically played by Gabriel Byrne. Some sessions take place at his clinical supervisor's office, that part equally well performed by Diane Weest. Paul's clients really test his patience and boundaries. It is good to show that even experienced therapists need to avail themselves of supervision from time to time throughout their career. Being a clinical social worker myself for years, it feels as if the  patients are real people with real life dilemmas. The therapeutic dialogue that takes place seems real and appropriate and surely must have been written in part by actual therapists. The therapist, Paul, does an excellent job with that sometimes difficult technique of staring and waiting for a long time to let the client talk first, the hugely pregnant pause as it were. However, I feel he offers ""interpretations"" too frequently, too lengthy, and some times off the mark, rather than letting the client take his/her time and eventually come to a meaningful interpretation on their own. I must say this series highlights some extremely difficult, angry, defiant, non-compliant clients, and if my caseload was filled with cases like that, I don't think I would have lasted over 20 years in the business.

I just finished the last two discs, and I am blown away all over again! I blame the acting, the directing, and of course, the writing. Absolutely first-rate!

If a show about 5 different people going to see a therapist sounds intriguing, give In Treatment a serious attempt. Each character or patient takes a while to get to the meat of their story. None of them really know what to expect in therapy, and they aren't able to trust the therapist. So as he slowly wins them over, and as they share their incredible stories- This show REALLY starts to materialize.

Did I mention it is intense? If I weren't such a big macho-type-of-guy, I might have almost choked back a tear or two here! Alright- They actually got me once. Don't tell anyone! What can I say? By the end of the season 2, I found myself deeply identifying with every single character. Even the ones I didn't like for a while! But, the one that really got me in this recent season, was the 23 year-old girl who was coping with her diagnosis of cancer. Her acting and the plight of her character just really had me wanting to help her. This show is Masterpiece Theater, evolved.

Unfortunately, I doubt In Treatment will ever be as popular as it deserves to be. I can't really recommend this to my friends. I don't think they would ""get"" it. I can picture them just looking at me like I was a nerd, but I've studied psychology in college and I've used therapy to get through some of my own tough times.

That being said, I feel the need to comment on the roles of therapist as played by Paul, and the role of supervisor as depicted in Gina.
I think Paul is a good therapist, and that is saying something in this field that is populated by many who haven't a clue about how to do this work. He is very empathic - that is, he demonstrates an ability to understand the feelings of his patients. He is respectful always with patients who are difficult. However, he is totally unwilling to share himself and his history with patients who would benefit from it. This is a matter of judgement, but Paul is bound by the dogmatic and rigid rules of this profession, which are formulated and promulgated in order to insure that no patient is adversely affected by therapists who don't know how to do the work. Paul frequently answers a legitimate question with another question, which properly infuriates his patients, and which allows Paul to dodge the question. He is frequently too emphatic in his making of points, which scares his patients into non-responsive submission. He shouts when he could just talk. He is at times unprofessional, appearing in his sessions unshaven and wearing jeans.
Gina, as his ""supervisor"" comes across as all-knowing, patronizing, judgmental, controlling, and frequently off the mark in thinking about and reacting to Paul's problems. She is the epitome of the social worker therapist. She is a walking cliche, complete with dresses that cover her from neck to floor, the sappy, pasted-on smile, the fake ""little girl"" way she speaks, and her insipid manner.

 The fact that therapist is portrayed as a flawed and conflicted human being much like his patients added to the series realism.  The contrast in his behaviour as the ever wise therapist and his angry and defensive behaviour in  supervision also felt authentic.

Having much experience in work-related relationships with mental health professionals, having much experience personally in therapy working on my own issues, and relating to quite a few people in therapy with regular life difficulties and/or mental illnesses of different kinds, this Laura episode is very disappointing to me. It is simply cheap and disgusting, and takes away from what could be a truly great program. There've been good lawyer programs, and horrible ones. Good medical ones, and horrible ones. This theme of psychotherapy could be so great and interesting, as well as truly informative, instead it is trashy, so much cheap-garbage language and even bathroom sex in a TV show... it insults the whole idea, and that's too bad. The story line too was shallow and sappy, lacking in any genuine, intelligent creativity. I was really disappointed.

3344711,5,B0013FSL0C,"""In Treatment"" has one of the simplest but most powerful premises for any TV series in history: various therapy patients come to the home office of Dr. Paul Weston (Gabriel Byrne) and lay bare their souls. ""In Treatment"" creator Rodrigo Garcia--adapting a series that originally appeared on Israeli TV--has assembled a fascinating group of characters. They include Alex (Blair Underwood), a hotshot Navy pilot beset by feelings of guilt and inadequacy; Sophie (Mia Wasikowska), a suicidal teenage gymnast; Jake (Josh Charles) and Amy (Embeth Davidtz), a mismatched married couple on the brink of divorce; and--most disturbing for Dr. Weston--Laura (Melissa George), a sexually confused doctor with an obsessive crush on Dr. Weston.

As the series progresses, we see that Dr. Weston himself is not without problems, and definitely not without character flaws that would be much improved by therapy. He is chilly and demanding toward Kate (Michelle Forbes), his increasingly fed-up wife, and he also has issues with Gina Toll (Dianne Wiest), his own therapist and former mentor.

The 43 episodes are extremely brief (the average length is about 25 minutes, but some are as short as 20), concentrated, and brilliantly written, often leaving viewers gasping for air. But it is the performances that really carry ""In Treatment"" and make it a must-see program. Every actor on the show deserves to be singled out for praise; however, I will say that Byrne is rock-solid as the show's anchor, and Wasikowska clearly reveals herself to be one of the finest actors of her generation. ""In Treatment"" isn't exactly cheerful viewing, but it will leave you totally fascinated.",1351900800,,1662,5.2443609022556394
3344712,5,B0013FSL0C,"I have been practicing psychotherapy for 30 years have always been dismayed by the unrealistic presentation that movies and TV give this complex and fascinating process.  I think In Treatment nailed it.  Good therapy, that is effective therapy that helps create lasting change is not about the therapist giving the patient a solution, or cure.  It is about the therapist understanding how to subtly encouage the patient to arrive at the solution himself.  Watching Laura's body language and listening to her story in the first episode, I thought I could predict where the session was heading.  It was very interesting to see Paul wondering about this too through his neutral reactions and very subdued way of offering her tissue and giving her a blanket. He was also affected by the seductive character of Laura's presentation as you could see when he started to play with his wedding ring and then stopped himself. Excellant writing, direction and acting. I am going to buy the whole series.",1345593600,,992,4.987878787878788
3344713,1,B0013FSL0C,"I must be watching a different show than the 5 star reviewers - I must be. I'm not even CLOSE to jumping on board with this series.

First, I gotta question the casting of Byrne - and I usually like him. All the feigned pensive expressions (oh, wait - he took his glasses off!) and ""tell me mores"" had me literally sighing out loud. Second, who decided people in therapy shoved into a 30 minute segment was interesting or realistic?

If you've been to therapy, it ISN'T THAT INTERESTING! Not to mention, shoving 3 acts into a half hour promotes some fairly forced turning points that I personally found contrived at best.",1340064000,7,621,4.535714285714286

The cast was spot on in their characterization of their psychotherapy sessions. I would highly recommend the series to anyone. In treatment is fantastic!,1333843200,,437,4.64935064935065

  You are getting a view that many don't.. A complete unbroken down issue.  Not all therapist are the same. I have seen two in my life dealing with personal issues and the one that stood out for me was not very by the book
She was easy to talk too and very one on one. She gave me examples that I could relate too and not just telling me what a book says.

Alot like Paul, in fact I told her about the show and she loved it lol.
Paul was a therapist who was having a hard time in life ,he wasn't perfect and he wasn't a God. He was just a man who was trying to help others and I think in a way he was trying to help himself.

He made mistakes
and we see the battle that he has within himself.

I am by no means saying that what he does is always right
but we can't expect him too always be right
In fact when I see Paul , I think of many who have done a job for so long they
just tend to be very open and laid back about it.

3344718,4,B0013FSL0C,"I'm ashamed of myself - as a confirmed sceptic about the validity and efficacy of psychotherapy - but I found this series quite addictive. Following four patients over the course of nine weeks is intriguing in itself (despite the psychobabble involved) because the stories develop and build but what really kindled my interest was the fact that the therapist himself (played by Gabriel Byrne) is under treatment as well and in doing so is openly sceptical about psychotherapy and its use. The sessions between him and his therapist (played by Dianne Wiest) are crackling with animosity and cynicism; if it weren't for these I might not recommend the series. The rest is OK, the acting is sometimes excellent - particularly that of Mia Wasikowska, who on this showing has the makings of a great actress, and of Dianne Wiest, who already is just that - the various cases mostly keep a good balance between realism and drama, and Gabriel Byrne is always worth watching. He is blessed with one of those faces so redolent of Depth Of Character that he doesn't even need to act. He can just sit there and his face will do all the work for him.

Drawbacks? It could be extremely monotonous for some; virtually everything takes place in one room and it's almost all talk - anybody who begins to fidget after half a dozen lines of dialogue will find this very heavy-going. There are a few pieces of drama but probably not enough to satisfy on their own; if you don't enjoy listening to conversation you'd best leave this alone. As for the more prurient-minded, there is a certain amount of dirty talk (this being HBO) but once again probably not enough to satisfy.",1324512000,2,1655,4.706896551724138

This show is extremely well-written and directed. There are some odd fluctuations in picture quality, most noticeable in one couple's vignettes, almost as if they were filmed on a different (inferior) camera. For that matter, I preferred watching the show on HBO High def as opposed to DVD, but HBO does not seem to re-run this program. It was somewhat of a specialty show with narrower appeal than some other HBO productions.

The interactions are candid, fascinating, aggressive and confrontational.  Its like eavesdropping on a therapist with their most interesting patients.  The fact that this show has little action and is still so absorbing is a testament to how good the writing really is.  The therapist going to another therapist adds a whole new level of interest as he reveals what he really thinks about his patients as well as his own issues. The patient stories are told individually and have really interesting parallels.  I watched one episode and now I'm obsessed.  Five stars all the way.

3344724,5,B0013FSL0C,"""In Treatment"" is riveting television.  The series' first season will never be surpassed, a point that can be made more definitively now that HBO has declared a quasi-end to the show after the third season.  [There was announcement of an end followed by some waffling by HBO, so who knows at this point.]

Gabriel Byrne is the engine that makes this show work.  His role of Paul Weston calls for long stretches of silence and active - almost aggressive - listening.  Then, when he talks, his words are sparse and impactful.  His understated delivery gives his observations a powerful punch.  Not everyone can pull this feat of minimalism off.  Gabriel Byrne can.  His casting is a masterstroke.

Season 1 provided us with one breakout star: Mia Wasikowska.  She's simply amazing as Sophie a young suicidal gymnast.  Those of us who caught Ms. Wasikowska here feel like we were in on a secret.  The rest of the world's caught on now.

I also relished the episodes with Embeth Davidtz (always a personal favorite) and Josh Charles (his 'Jake' here is a marked change from The Good Wife's Will Gardner) as well as those with Blair Underwood.  I always joke that Blair Underwood does Blair Underwood very well, but he opened my eyes here with some truly fine acting.

Melissa George's Laura episodes left me a bit cold and uncomfortable, and I simply never cottoned at all to Paul's sessions with Gina (Dianne Wiest) - they're just so combative.  However, I do like Michelle Forbes and felt like she was underused as Paul's wife, Kate.  I would have had more Kate, less Gina.

I'm fascinated by In Treatment's heritage as the Israeli show Be'Tipul (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/In-Treatment-Be-Tipul-The-Complete-First-Season-Hebrew/dp/B001QWX850/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">In Treatment (Be'Tipul) - The Complete First Season (Hebrew)</a>).  I wish I could get an English subtitled Region 1 DVD of that.  Ayelet Zurer (The Ice Princess) and Lior Ashkenazi are two of my favorite actors.  They're the Laura and Alex equivalents in the original.  That kind of thing thrills me to know.",1305763200,5,2120,5.207100591715976

I find myself alternating between sympathy for Paul as he deals with his extremely difficult clients (I would hate Mondays if I had to see a patient like Laura every week), and frustration at his complete lack of his own self-awareness. The hostility that pervades each and every session and personal encounter in this therapist's life is EXHAUSTING to witness - but I'm sure that will play out in future seasons towards explaining his character more fully. I find myself hugely annoyed by him, rather than inspired as a psychotherapist - his rapid-fire interpretations, his stone-faced passivity towards the hostility and personal attacks by patients every day, his own childish anger-dumping and lack of insight with his therapist.

I hate you -- you wasted nearly 15 hours of my life. Blue balls. In the worst of ways. I hate you. I want to cry.

Do not watch this if you do not want to be preached to about morals and pseudo-psychology. There was no reason for the ending to be this way. In reality, it would not happen this way -- EVER. But in the end, the therapist turns out to be a spineless, disgusting human being who has no balls whatsoever. I hate hate hate the ending. I will not watch this or anything by anyone associated with this show and will tell everyone how awful and patronizing it is. What the hell? I cannot believe they actually want you to be like, ""yeah, Gina is right, he's such a good guy. He's a moral person.""

I have to admit that I didn't watch all of the sessions between Paul and his patients because, eventually, what I was the most fascinated by was his sessions with Gina.  Dianne Wiest was an absolute marvel and went toe to toe with Gabriel Byrne in their scenes together.  Sometimes just her facial expressions, with NO words were right on the money.

3344742,4,B0013FSL0C,"""In Treatment"" is an extremely underrated series that shines and displays amazing originality. An intriguing HBO series that has both; an overall theme and underneath it lies a brilliant underlining storyline that is never viewed with restlessness. This might not be for the action-packed, police/murdering, or mystery suspenseful audience but is extremely close to the reality of dealing with conflict/trauma using the tools of psychoanalysis. Not your typical ""shrink"" program.
  Introducing and delving into the human psyche. A mid-level psychological series which often catches and releases the viewer to ponderous questions of one's own consciousness. Storyline mainly involves 5/6 diverse characters with different but relative challenges. Follow characters through weekly sessions of discovery, denial, challenge, betrayal on their wayward heroes' journey, along with many twists of coincidence...or is it fate?
  Script is well researched and character development is extraordinary. Mia Wasikowska (Sophie)(Alice in Wonderland) establishes herself as a young 5 star actress who very well may be the best up-an-coming young actress I've ever seen in a television series, Gabriel Byrne (therapist) is flawless within duality roles of not only providing therapy but as a conflicted human. Melissa George (Laura) has the best script of character development on the show and has no problem playing the love/sexual transference witnessed with real-life patient/psychologist relationships.

3344756,4,B0013FSL0C,"This series, translated from an Israeli prototype, takes us to the heart of psychotherapy. It stars Gabriel Byrne as Paul Weston, a somewhat rumpled and worn-out therapist, and six patients. Each 25-minute episode is a real-time view of a therapy session.

The first patient is Laura, a sexy doctor about to split with her boyfriend who reveals in the first episode that she's in love with Paul. Next comes Alex, an African-American ace fighter pilot who accidentally killed 25 children in a school in Iraq. The most gripping patient is Sophie played wonderfully by Mia Wasikowska. She's a 15-year-old Olympic gymnast whose life has gone off the rails with a suicide attempt. Fourth are Amy and Jake, a couple whose marriage is falling apart. Finally, in the fifth episode, Weston seeks guidance and spars with Gina (Dianne Wiest), a former mentor with whom he has clashed in the past.

We meet each of these characters nine times during the course of the season. Other peripheral characters -- Paul's unfaithful wife and kids, Sophie's mom -- occasionally drift into the action but basically we're stuck in Paul's cluttered office watching him fiddle with his glasses as his patients pour out their troubles.

Occasionally, the translation from the Israeli-version strikes a false note. One anecdote is clearly drawn from the Holocaust. Transfering it to the South in the 1940s doesn't work. In another reference, one of the characters recalls the aroma of cakes baking on a Friday afternoon suffusing the apartment building of her youth. Yes, that happens in Israel on sabbath eve but not in America.

At the end of this series, we learn that Paul is at least as screwed up as his patients and that psychotherapy often doesn't work. Only one of the patients makes real progress toward a recovery. The others either stew in their juices or get worse -- in one case much worse.

Still, it's fascinating viewing, well-written and acted.",1257292800,6,1935,4.959876543209877

I have to watch the entire week (1 disc) before I can walk away.  I have to find out what each character is going to say or do next.

When something is as gripping as ""In Treatment"" I have to have all of a good thing. I devoured all 20 or so hours of Series 1 in two days - it's that good! After a slower than expected start, the characters very quickly began to reveal aspects of themselves which built and built, forming incredibly complex people and interpersonal situations. I liked all of the characters but found myself looking forward to each new instalment of Sophie, the teenager with a 30 year old head on her shoulders and a venomous tongue born of painful emotional baggage. I found the scenes featuring Sophie and her Mum hard to watch but I believed totally all that I was seeing. My only issue with the writers is that while they go to the trouble of explaining and demonstrating ""transferrence"", I think the protagonist, Paul - a highly skilled psychotherapist - demonstrates ""counter transferrence"" without much insight into his own practice and feelings, particularly with Sophie and to a lesser extent, Alex.

3344772,5,B0013FSL0C,"In Treatment, a hypnotic HBO series, offers deep insight into the lives of others, other people's pain, suffering, wounds and neurosis. This excellent series operates within the structure of weekly sessions of six patients: One sexually-intense female doctor; one top gun; one teenage gymnast; a couple in trouble; and the therapist seeing his own therapist.

Gabriel Brynne does a grand job of portraying a therapist with great compassion and insight, and troubles of his own. Blaire Underwood does an outstanding job as an incredibly high achiever, and the list goes on with the great direction and the superb cast. The characters don't always fill the assigned professional shoes, i.e., the character that is supposed to be an anesthesiologist, as well as, a woman that uses sex as a sort of currency. The unbelievable part is that she's an anesthesiologist. Diane Wiest doesn't really seem like a therapist but pulls off the role by playing the role of a somewhat clichd, self-absorbed therapist with foibles of her own, very awkwardly.

The episodes frequently end very uncomfortably, which remains one of its many charms.

3344775,5,B0013FSL0C,"I highly recommend this series for those who are students of human nature and enjoy excellent writing, direction and acting. I am once again amazed at HBO's uncanny knack for tackling projects that lift and redefine the television medium. In Treatment is the most accurate portrayal of what happens in the private confines of psychotherapy that has ever been attempted by the large or small screen. The sheer appeal of this show is its unapologetic 'bareness', minimalism and pitch perfect honesty. Gabriel Byrne is understated in his brilliance; Blair Underwood gives perhaps the most sublime and compelling performance of his career; Glynn Turman (not often seen as an accomplished actor i.e. Cooley High, A Different World, etc.) blew me away with his brief but poignant performance; Dianne Wiest - an oscar-winning actress is incredible as the ""Therapist's Therapist"".

I have often wondered how anyone had the courage to do such an unadorned project - that is exploring pscychotherapy between 2 people. I think that the answer is that so many of us are secretly hurting and therefore enjoy a safe outlet to vicariously experience such a therapeutic environment. In Treatment delivers this and much more. In Treatment is now 'In Season' in our culture. If you are as fascinated by human nature and relationships as I am (I am a pastor) you will be riveted by this show. Buy the whole DVD series so you can watch it uninterrupted. I found Season 1 to be more riveting than the 2nd season although both are quite good.",1247184000,6,1520,4.9375

One of the most charismatic of teachers we had said that in this work the ""pressures are enormous.""  since then I have worked in places where I was hit in the head by inpatients quite regularly, and that got to be tough going, but the show brought back the tensions and agonies of the psychotherapy work in a way that I have yet to see on TV, and I admired the gal Dr. Malfi in Sopranos.  I could only wish that that my own interventions were as nicely crafted as Gabriel's.  The patient's were fascinating and well portrayed.  I want to buy the dvds and study them.

3344778,4,B0013FSL0C,"I realise 'In Treatment' is a remake, but I can't shake the feeling it still feels experimental...

Don't get me wrong, it's a terrific show. The emotions running through each character feel honest and believable and every single actor delivers a brilliant performance (there are NO weak-links). The script is sharp and intelligent, and despite the lack of different locations it draws you in. I was never once bored when watching the 40+, 30 minute episodes.

This show also feels realistic. For me shows that feature realism are always interesting but seem to forget the fact that the ultimate goal is to entertain it's audience. 'In Treatment' is aware of this and (especially in the first few episodes) feels like it's trying to make the audience ignore the fact that we're mostly just watching people talk. Some characters seem like they're monologing and just seem a bit too comfortable displaying every little emotion. This isn't a bad thing, and sort of gives it that indie (fore-mentioned ""experimental"") feel, but doesn't really make you forget you just spent the last 30 minutes watching a conversation.

Oh, and there are no extras on the DVD's (unless I'm totally missing something). The show's good enough, but I would've loved to see interviews with the cast (especially since there's a new cast for season 2). To me no extras just feel like a missed opportunity with DVD sets. I realise you're mostly buying the DVD's for the show itself, but considering you can stream most episodes online it kinda makes you think twice before purchasing this DVD set.

With television shows these days trying to 'out-create' each other, it's nice to see a series that truly does more with less. Despite my complaints, this show is definitely worth owning (at Amazon's price of $34.99 when everyone else is charging $50+).",1244592000,6,1823,4.947712418300654

I have very little patience for this sort of thing in real life; even less in my entertainment.

People have praised this as ""incredibly real,"" which perhaps is the problem I have with it.  There is not a narrative in each episode in any traditional sense.  There is story, yes, but no plot, and while I certainly don't need an ambitiously structured plot in stories, I do expect character-driven pieces to have interesting characters.  These characters behave like petulant children; these are not interesting neurotics.  And frankly, I find Byrne's ""incredibly real"" patience trying--I want him to leap up and start smacking them around and telling them to grow up!  They're that annoying!

Of course it's sped up to fit one client into one season, but it's pretty accurate in its depiction of how a psychdynamically-oriented clinician goes about work.

In my 22 years of therapy -- that's right, 22! -- I've thankfully never encountered a Paul Weston, and would have ditched him if I had. Weston's predictably banal responses to his patients could have been generated by computer. His reckless disregard for the boundaries of his profession are ludicrous at best, and dangerous at worst. Accepting an expensive gift from a patient -- the famous all-the-bells-and-whistles coffeemaker -- cheaply encodes the character's resistance. But it also irrevocably contaminates his therapy. The remaining clients fare as badly at Weston's hands -- for example, in the unchecked violence the couple display in Weston's office. Therapy is meant as a safe space, not as a danger zone. Rather multiply examples, of which there are many, I concede the show's single bright spot: Gina's scrupulous adherence to the canons Weston so flagrantly violates, and Dianne Wiest's brilliant evocation of a therapist who knows her business. This show's problem lies not in its acting, which is fine throughout, but in its overdrawn and needlessly melodramatic scripts. Interestingly, my psychologist agrees. But then, he sets and maintains boundaries. These frustrate the resistant client at times, but ultimately make for successful outcomes.

Concerns like boundaries, limit setting, clinical supervision and acting out during session are all dealt with.

Gabriel Byrne plays a very human and very caring therapist.  The viewer is privy to his once a week sessions with 4 different patients plus his once a week session with his own therapist.  We can see his emotional struggles as he tries to do the right thing in situations that are far from black and white.

3344798,5,B0013FSL0C,"I sort of stumbled across this series quite recently when I got On Demand and HBO.  This show is broad-ranged and entrancing.  HBO was playing reruns, I think, of all the episodes in a row on one day.  I would tape and then watch most of them in one evening.

All of the actors are superb.  The writing is impeccable.  The stories are captivating.

I can certainly see why this was a hit in Israel and why it continues to be one over here also.",1238025600,8,444,4.152941176470589

Equally compelling were his confronting his own failings as a husband and father in his treatment sessions with a psychologist played by Dianne Wiest. Glynn Turman has one scene in this series that may contain the finest acting I've seen in a long, long time. Why isn't he getting bigger roles?",1235347200,4,466,5.397260273972603

3344802,5,B0013FSL0C,"I just want to add a few thoughts to the mostly glowing reviews here.  Brilliant conception, astoundingly smart and believable writing, and most of all, microscopically brilliant acting.  The reason this series is as great as the very best HBO shows - including Sopranos, the Wire, Deadwood,etc.-- the ones that have broad visual canvasses lacking on the mostly one-room IN TREATMENT--is that you see as much going on visually on the actors' faces as you did in the striking settings (New Jersey lanscapes, bada bing, dusty Western saloons, dark brothel rooms, etc.) of those other shows.

If Gabriel Byrne did not spend a decade in therapy it's hard to understand how he aced the mannerisms and expressions of psychotherapists. Byrne's face was as active just watching his patients talk as it was when he was talking and gesticulating. And oh, what gesticulating. Every single actor who played one of his patients was not just good but jaw-droppingly good. Layers and layers of thought and emotion, often ones contradicting each other at the same split second in time, can be gleaned off their faces. (All you have to do is watch them as closely as Byrne does.)  Embeth Davidtz's arching eyebrows had so much attitude, her body language betrayed so much ache and anger beneath the  words that were drenched in denial.  Josh Charles peeled open his character over the eight weeks like delicate layers of onion. Blair Underwood's physical and attitudinal bluster was so believable that it was genuinely shocking when his confusion and heartbreak came pouring out toward the end.  Michelle George as Laura was a revelation.  Why isn't this woman a big-time movie star? As right for her character, the actress created a slippery sexuality at once seductive and suspicious; yet still, she managed to reveal a vulnerability perched right at the corner of manipulation and authentic pain. You could never make up your mind about her, which is exactly what was required by the story of this unnerving and unnervingly beautiful character. Dianne Weist couldn't have been more credible as a psychoanalyst if she herself had spent a decade in analytic training.  But perhaps most astonishingly of all, Mia Wasikowska as Sophie, the teenage gymnast, created the most indelible of all the patient characters.  Apparently without much prior acting experience, Wasikowska managed to embody all the contradictions of the most complexly written character on the show, and she brought dimensions beyond what was written.  Her voice, her physicality, her minute facial expressions could not have been any more revealing even when her character was doing everything she could to hide her painful truths not only from Paul the therapist but from herself. How she pulled it off is a miracle of genius acting from a relative neophyte.  The fact that she wasn't even nominated for an Emmy is bizarre.  Who are these people doing the nominating?  The NY TIMES did an article some weeks before announcement of the Emmy nominations calling for her nomination.  You'd have to be blind, deaf, and certainly dumb not to have been dumbfounded by her performance.  I guess she gets something of a last laugh; I just read that she was cast by Tim Burton as the lead in his upcoming version of ""Alice in Wonderland.""  HE was certainly paying attention watching her perform IN TREATMENT.

The direction and everything else was perfect, and the script, transmogrified somewhat from the Israeli version, was as layered and brilliant as the acting that fleshed it all out.  So I am thrilled to have also just read that the series has been renewed.  It is being filmed now, it seems, and will be aired sometime in 2009.  Maybe that's why they delayed the release of the DVD of season one - wanting it out just as the second season begins.

Don't miss this show; it's one for the ages, and I have a sense that it will become the humongous hit it deserves (I guess it was a moderate hit when first aired)when more people see the second season.",1226793600,34,4003,4.908011869436201

I found the writing to be excruciatingly banal and nothing more than elementary. The psychological insight was about what you learned in Psych 101 freshman year in college.  Transference?  Really? And despite the best efforts of Gabe and Dianne, most of the actors were unable to bring life to the dreary writing. At work we decided about four episodes in that a different cast of exceptional actors could possibly have made good drama of this pablum, but the cast they had just couldn't do it.

I don't deny that some of it is 'over the top'. Such as Alex delving into Paul's private life and Paul not kicking him out and refusing to treat him anymore. Alex acted psychotic. But besides some perhaps 'unreal' things about the series, it IS a Drama! We are Supposed to be interested!

3344815,5,B0013FSL0C,"This is a powerful, deeply moving, intelligent, emotionally nuanced series. It consisting of nothing more than psychotherapy sessions between a cast of reoccuring characters, this show fills an important niche missing from most television -- the richness, complexity, and heartbreak of the ""emotional life.""

Are you tired of seeing thin, carbon-copied and cliched characters in movies and television shows? Then this is the perfect series for you, because here the whole point is to explore the inner lives of the characters.

Does the the fact that this series focuses a great deal on the emotions of the characters mean that there is no ""action?"" Only if you define ""action"" as soley encompassing explosions or giant robot attacks.

To me, however, there was more action in this show than almost any other I've seen: there was the complexity of coming to terms with the guilt of death, of a disintergrating marriage, of children torn between parents, of unrequieted love, of the intense pressures to be successful, of professional jealousy, of the quiet desperation of everyday life, and the pain and bravery of those trying to take control of their lives.

The writing is really quite incredible. I was time and again rivited by the ways in which the story tellers captured and traced the emotionally raw and complex workings of the human heart- the tangled web which constitutes human relationships.

Some detractors have said they find the characters ""annoying:"" these characters strike me as ""real,"" for, in life, people are themselves complex and full of paradoxes, at times annoying but at others deeply sympathetic. I came to be involved with all the characters, and, in the end, they all suprised me, up until the very last episode.

The acting is also superb. Gabriel Byrne (as the therapist ""Paul"") gives the performance of his lifetime, and Mia Wasikowska gives a star making performance as ""Sophie,"" a troubled gymnast.

This is a show for people who find themselves interested in the human mind and heart, particularly, in the complex ways in which we become entangled with our fellow human beings, and often punish ourselves, lie to ourselves, and hide from our own inner truths. What is the thrill of an asteroid threatening to destroy the Earth compared to the everyday struggle with such things as love, guilt, and the fear of facing another day on this planet.

Truly, one of the great shows I have seen- original, thought provoking, powerfully acted, intelligently written, and as deep and as rich a portrait of the human soul as we're likely to ever get on television.",1208044800,199,2591,5.0093023255813955

Yes, therapy is a complex process fraught with pitfalls and misadventures, but it is also a process that can and often does liberate and free the human spirit from the chains and fetters of the dark forces and shadows that plague us all until the final release that occurs at journey's end for each of us.

Blair Underwood was pitch perfect as a navy pilot; Turman, the actor who played his father, was amazing, I could believe they were really father and son. I love Gabriel Byrne, but this was a revelation in the choices of his mannerisms and reactions to the actors he was involved with; so believable with the exception to the bimbo he ""falls in love with"" and becomes obsessed over. I would have liked to see a bit more of his interaction with his family. How are his children? Is he as completely oblivious to them as the wife's point of view would have us believe?

I've only made it through Season 1 , and I'm hoping beyond hope Blair Underwood's estate wins the lawsuit.  The hostility Paul showed to that patient was ridiculous.  He should have referred that patient to another therapist when he himself became part of a sticky triangle.  And why on earth did he not report Cy to the authorities or to the underaged patient's mother?  Paul knew Cy was continuing to coach Sophie after he molested her.  And then his arrogance of complaining that he was tired of being a therapist.  Well, maybe he should have thought about that before he made many of his patients worse.  Of course, he talks about taking a teaching job.  Oh Lordy no, so he can train an entire squad of self-involved, manipulative, petulant therapists like himself?  Paul is delusional.  He really thinks Laura loves him.  She is nuts and manipulative.  And really, a 30-year-old hot anesthesiologist going for Paul?  I don't think so.  He should have known better.  Vanity equals Paul.

I'm not entirely sure that Sophie,the character played by Mia Wasikowska in this show, would approve of my doing so, she'd probably call me a tool and roll her eyes at me, but that's ok.
