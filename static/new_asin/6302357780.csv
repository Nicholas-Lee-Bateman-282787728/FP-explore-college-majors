7824893,4,6302357780,"What does it take to become a successful entrepreneur, especially if you are African-American? Oprah Winfrey, John Johnson (CEO of Johnson Publishing Company), and Joshua Smith (CEO of Maxima Corporation) share with you the seeds for success in today's highly competititive world.
  None of the above individuals came from wealthy homes or the best of environments. Yet the fact that they moved beyond their negative obstacles in life shows the same possibility for you. All of them stress a strong belief in God, hard work, belief in yourself and a good education as the vital areas which you need for success.
  The featured entrepreneuers candidly discuss their failures as well as successes. Throughout their discussion they remind you everything must be kept in perspective. Even failures and rejections are opportunities for growth and learning.
  The Entrepreneurs is a good video in inspiring potential African-Americans who wish to go into business. Dispersed through out the video are historical profiles of other African- Americans (Frederick Douglass), who were able to do the same thing. All three give sound and pragmatic advice about preparing yourself in the business world. These insights are the highlight of this great feature. I enjoyed it and would recommend it for youth and older African-Americans who aspire to become leaders in the business world.",993081600,,1372,5.328703703703703
