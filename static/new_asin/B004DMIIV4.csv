4332804,5,B004DMIIV4,"This filler arc features the straw hats falling from the sky and having to defend their selves and try and get out of the sticky situation of the commander Johnathon.
It has episodes 196-205 and the more we sell the more money funimation has to buy season 4 and meet Franky water 7 and CP9!!",1304208000,,291,4.3090909090909095
4332805,3,B004DMIIV4,one piece season 3 fifth voyage is a funny filler but i dnt consider it filler but thats just me my only complaint is we don't get eposide 206 which finishes off the g-8 arc i wonder why that was not included does any body no  but great filler all together just wish could of saw the end in this set,1302134400,,299,3.901639344262295
4332806,5,B004DMIIV4,"Yes, it's a filler arc DVD set, but I'll be darned if it isn't the best One Piece filler out there.  In this story, Luffy and co. land in the middle of a Marine base where they must avoid capture at the hands of the clever Marine Vice Admiral Jonathan.

This set is just pure fun.  Even if you've seen it in Japanese, the set gets new life thanks to FUNimation's stellar English dub.  Though it's just bridging the gap between canon story arcs, this is one bridge I want to cross again and again.",1301961600,6,496,4.189473684210526
4332807,5,B004DMIIV4,"Ok so a lot of people dislike filler arcs. However, in my opinion this is not just the best filler arc in One Piece, but in all of the anime I've seen, and believe me I've seen a lot of anime. This arc is right after Skypiea, and the Strawhats are trapped in a marine base. The Strawhats struggle to escape the base. This arc has a good story unlike other filler arcs. I highly recommend this arc because who knows, maybe we will never get another great filler arc like this ever again.",1300320000,12,486,4.180851063829787
4332808,3,B004DMIIV4,"Checking the site and the episode list on Wikipedia, i notice that this disc will only contain ten episodes rather than the usual thirteen and I cannot applaud enough FUNimation's kindness in realizing this. This disc is going to be entirely filler without any lingering manga-content episodes tacked on in an attempt to force fans to buy it. I won't be buying it and will wait for Voyage 1 of season 4, but I hope enough people do purchase it so as to encourage FUNimation to keep separating full filler arcs from major arcs (this is the second time they've been this kind to us and I have to say i really appreciate it. From what i hear this arc is pretty fun and, really, it doesn't do too much to create any plot holes, since the manga just has our Straw Hats drifting around for a little bit before arriving at Water 7 anyway.",1299369600,,831,4.367741935483871
4332809,5,B004DMIIV4,I am so glad they have decided to continue doing the One Piece funimation dub after cartoon network idiotically dropped the show almost 200 episodes in. Anyway this is my favorite filler arc but very distressed that they bumped the release date up to April 19th at the rate they release DVD's we won't even enter Water 7 in 2011. I think they have already dubbed all of the CP9 saga how come it will take years to release huh?,1296000000,7,426,4.3375
4332810,5,B004DMIIV4,"I know it's a filler arc, but I feel like it's one of the better ones in the series.  I mean they get dropped into a Marine Base and have to fight their way out.  Overall I really enjoyed these episodes.  Particularly in prep for Water 7 and CP9.",1295049600,,246,3.979591836734694
4332811,2,B004DMIIV4,"I am interested in how funimation dubs episodes 196-206 that are rumored to be included with this set. Even if episodes 207 and 208 are not included with this set, I still plan on preordering this dvd, although I am not a particular fan of filler arcs.  At least we get a new ending out of it.

now:G8 stronghold
Next:season 4:Davy back fight and filler memory loss arcs.",1293321600,2,371,4.4411764705882355
4332812,3,B004DMIIV4,"Frustrated that it's been a month since One Piece Season 3, 3rd Voyage came out a month ago and it will be another 2 MONTHS before 4th Voyage comes out?  Bummer!  Well perhaps you'll be glad that after one of the longest waits for a new installment of the adventures of the Straw Hat Pirates, the wait for 5th Voyage will be an all time low, a mere 21 DAYS!!
What you get after this brief 3 week wait is almost entirely filler episodes, but oh well.  These are actually fairly exciting.  We rejoin Luffy and Co. just after the Going Merry has descended from Skypeia with a mighty splash into the Blue Sea.  This doesn't fail to catch the attention of regiment of Marines who, uh, just happen to have a base here.  Uh oh!
What is more, this happens to be Marine Base G-8, perhaps the most isolated and unexciting Marine base on the Grand Line.  So when the G-8 Marines see a pirate ship fall out of the sky right into their base, they essentially say ""THANK YOU, JESUS!  LET'S HAVE SOME FUN CATCHING PIRATES!!  And nobody wants to make the most of this opportunity more than Jonathan, the commander of the base.  Although Jonathan's right hand man wants to annihilate the Straw Hats as quickly as possible, Jonathan wants to savor the moment and see how long he can keep Luffy and Co. running and searching for a way out.  Much like General Zaroff in the classic story, ""The Most Dangerous Game,"" Jonathan finds great sport in the hunt for a wily band of pirates, so long as he proves himself the wiliest in the end.
To make sure that the Straw Hats don't just try to run, Jonathan grabs the treasure they got from Skypeia and challenges them to get it back.  Thus, the Straw Hats are forced to split up and look for their loot while also evading capture.  They also find out that the G-8 Marines have a strong sense of kinship and humanity.  Some of them have actual family ties.  Sanji finds his way into the mess hall and gets to know the head chef, Jessica, who happens to be Jonathan's wife.  Although initially hostile toward Sanji, Jessica is quite impressed with Sanji's cooking skills and allows him to work in the kitchen.  Usopp, meanwhile, makes friends with the elderly ship mechanic, Mekao, who first spotted the Going Merry falling from the sky.  Chopper and Nami (disguised as a visiting surgeon and nurse) hide out in the infirmary and meet Dr. Kobata (Mekao's daughter).  Dr. Kobata, recently transferred from a pediatrician position, is ill prepared to face the serious battle wounds of a squad of Marines being brought to G-8 for treatment and faints at the sight of blood.  Good thing Dr. Chopper is there to take care of things!
Zoro ends up in the brig, and Usopp soon gets captured and imprisoned as well.  Meanwhile, a World Government inspector named Shepard has arrived at the base, determined to find a way to discredit Jonathan's competence as a commander and have G-8 shut down as a waste of tax money.  And what better way to discredit Jonathan than to capture the pirates that have been running amuck in the base himself?  Unfortunately for Shepard, Robin knocks him out before he can meet Jonathan, so when Robin arrives in Jonathan's office and says that SHE is the inspector, he is fooled and Robin is free to roam the base without suspicion.
All this time Luffy has managed to outrun and overpower the Marines that have come after him.  Luffy meets up with Sanji and, after learning Zoro and Usopp are in lockup, goes to break them free.  The four of them then run into the regiment of Marines that Shepard brought with him and have a thrilling battle.  Nami and Chopper, meanwhile, have given up their ruse in the infirmary.  Chopper joins up with Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, and Robin to face Shepard, who has regained consciousness and unleashes his secret weapon on the pirates.  Nami is determined to get HER treasure back and finds out it's in Jonathan's office.  With a little help from Luffy and a Clima Tact thunder cloud, she succeeds in her goal.
By now, Jonathan has figured out Shepard's motives and is only too glad to let the Straw Hat Pirates crush him.  But his game with the pirates isn't finished and it takes a tremendous effort for Luffy and Co. to finally escape.  Jonathan, grateful for the diversion brought by the Straw Hats and their role in driving off an unwelcome inspector, sheds no tears over letting them get away.
The end of the G-8 arc marks a major milestone for the series.  Starting with Episode 207 (which should be the 12th episode of this set).  One Piece takes on a crisper high definition format.  The eyecatches change from the windblown wanted posters theme to a theme where a spyglass gazes at the members of the Straw Hat crew along with their most prized possessions (only Luffy appears in these eycatches until about Episode 250).  Both the opening and closing music sequences change.  The fifth opening sequence of the series is one of my favorites (the music is great and there are previews of scenes from future episodes featuring Foxy, Admiral Aokiji, and Water 7).
If the manufacturers don't decide to cut it off at the end of the G-8 Arc (Episode 206), we'll get to see Bellamy the Hyena's death scene at the hands of Shichibukai Donquixote Doflamingo (quite funny actually) and the Straw Hats' arrival at Longring Longland, where practically everything has been greatly elongated.  They make friends with the resident hermit, Tonjit, and his giraffe-like horse Sherry.  Luffy and Co. offer to help Tonjit search for his son, but they run into a strange looking pirate captain instead.  This captain, Foxy the Silver Fox, has gained the reputation of undisputed champion of the Davy Back Fight, a contest with a wide variety of bizarre events in which the winning captain has the right to steal crew members from the loser.  Failure to honor the terms of the Davy Back Fight results in one's ship and crew being sent to Davy Jones' Locker.  Not really knowing what he's getting himself into because it sounds like fun, Luffy accepts Foxy's challenge and the game is on for the next volume, which I figure will be Season 4, First Voyage.

Next:  The Davy Back Fight and a mysterious memory loss!",1291075200,,6175,4.616300366300366

8425661,3,B004DMIIV4,"If a big fan of One Piece, but I was very disappointed when this came out. Normally I'm okay with the filler arcs, but I felt this fell a bit short from their other adventures and was a waste taking up a whole dvd set on it.",1312761600,,224,3.7872340425531914
8425662,5,B004DMIIV4,"most anime that does filler to catch up the manga is usually poorly done , i have enjoyed the two filler arc's so far an cannot wait for the next season of one piece.",1312761600,,166,3.911764705882353
8425663,5,B004DMIIV4,"In anime especially long running shows like OP it will have filler, luckily One Piece doesn't have a whole lot for the amount of episodes. This filler is the best I've seen of any filler. When I first saw it I figured it was part of the main story so it's good despite only being 10 episodes.",1310515200,,292,4.140350877192983
8425664,4,B004DMIIV4,"I'll keep it brief as i am an echo of most others who have reviewed. I loved the content and thought it was top tier for a short arc. However, in terms of pricing for the product - i was definitely underwhelmed in comparison to previous installments. Accepting that for whatever reason we have gone from 13 episodes per installment to 12 with no pricing change, I was really a bit turned off by the $43 prices tag for 10 episodes, regardless of the reason. If you only had 10 episodes left to sell from season 3, Funimation, then prorate the pricing accordingly please. I will keep buying, but am not real pleased with the pricing for the product. Did I mention I didn't like the price tag? Pricing keeps it from a 5-Star rating for me.",1304812800,,736,4.37956204379562
8425665,5,B004DMIIV4,This filler arc was very enjoyable and satisfying. I really only had one problem which is that the dvd was cut three episodes and no trailer for a future dvd.  My favorite segment (or segments) in this arc are with chief inspector. Especially at the end when the straw hats act so calm and cool about it.  We have about two more arc til they get to the main story so i suggest everyone stay tuned. If you are wondering how long i would say in about 2-3 dvds they'll be at water. A big thank you to funimation and everyone who brought us this. Keep up the good work.,1304294400,,565,4.127272727272727
