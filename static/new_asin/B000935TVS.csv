2261910,5,B000935TVS,"Having seen numerous Ring Cycles, live and on video, this set of performances is really one of the best and most satisfying. The singers are superb. The recorded sound could be better, but no real quibbles. Tomlinson and Evans as Wotan and Brunnhilde are magnificent.",1203292800,,267,4.955555555555556
2261911,1,B000935TVS,"Music is great-my favourite modern cycle. Now what in gods name does the end mean. And more than that-it distracts from one of the most glorious musical segments in history with an absurd and meaningless concept that really has no bearing on the rest of the opera(s). It really breaks all rules of good taste and shamefully disctracts the listener and viewer from what they should be feeling as Wagner concludes this epic. I am flabbergasted and appalled that such a crock of sh****T was allowed to ruin this otherwise wonderful production. I recommend the Die Walkure as the best part of this set.
The End--a group of people wheel out televisions and sip martinis while a blond boy and girl decide to hold hands.(In this ring--all walsungs have red hair so don't go there) It is even worse than what I have described because I am too upset to go on. FOR SHAME!!!!!!",1188259200,8,866,4.62987012987013
2261912,5,B000935TVS,"I saw this on VHS complete many years ago, well when it first came out, and the production, the concept of Kupfer directly parallels what Herr Wagner wanted as well as Barenboim's large massive scale sound he prefers to Boulez's more chamber-like reading. Boulez also had faster tempi and Daniel. I am sure they both discussed it together. . . . What did Herr Wagner Want?, a scaled down stage, reduced to the elements, the natural elements of power, Wind, Light, Magic, Rocks, Maidens,Giants,Swords of Power, Wealth, Gold,each is a metaphor for contemporary globalized capitalism, if you know where to look.all the things necessary to rule the globe. Wagner knew long ago of the complexities, the dramatic traps in the stagecraft, stage productions, and He got tired of his deferring to his assistant with pen in hand (or plume then)taking copious notes while he was speaking during rehearsals. ""Tell them not to move the Rhinemaidens so fast. . . "" or ""Alberich needs mores slim in his costume. . . "", and Wotan cannot sing in too far back on the platform. . . "",In this production, everyone seemed to miss the long vinyl leather coats here donned by Wotan and Brunhilde, with vinyl boots, shining provocatively and all. Hagen reminded me of Rob Snyder from ""Saturday Night Live"", he usually plays a good-for-nothing-mindless persona anyway, nothing amounts to much, self-centered and neurotic perfect for Alberich. The dragon was a nice touch as well, showing we know something of magic and the modernist canon; But then Alberich's ideology is what makes capitalism work well, so Herr Wagner seems to be telling us. So does Wotan, but Wotan needs a ""reality check"" at times, too much aristocratic baggage with too many of his ""seeds"" spread over the universe, but he is not one let a good deal, or a duplitous situation slip away from his staff,(the piece of wood) filled with past in default contracts un-honored for the most part.

The Rhinemaidens as well, here are not too slutty, nor intellectual, but more simply :water-children:Dippies ( Hippies who bath), AC/DC, slipping and sliding through the hydroelectric facility Kupfer provides, of large funnels, ducts and sewer pipes. We see them age when the gold is stolen and their longevity runs out. Likewise the rope of fate, where the Norns tell a tale, actually recapitualting the entire RING, so if you missed it, tune in to the First Act of Gotterdammurung. The gentle small white poles stringing this rope is wonderfully visual but from a distance.

The large continuous expanse of the stage the endless vast continuums of space is also a wonderful touch. Wagner's grandson Wieland in the early Fifties had a similar concept  for the productions he mounted. Light LICHT, was the thing, Light gives the voice room to sing and develop. The RING (don't we know it) is about singing, and although Herr Wagner wanted to reach out his conceptual tentacles to a Gesamtkunstwerk, he hadn't the time, (nor the genius) to think through the concept's countless paradigms, while trying/claiming to serve all the Arts simultaneously, he served none of them, well, the music is powerful and glorious, and each part has a different orchestration so to give a kind of Timbral ""signature"" to the entire proceedings. Wagner thought of the Cinema but how much of this could have materialized. Ludwig of Bavaria was already spending too much of his Empire on this RING.
I prefer this Kupfer/Barenboim to the Boulez/Chereau, with all the finisse and detailed-oriented-ness of the French, it was not as provocative as this more larger strokes full-tilt one. Well TIME does that, we like something first then discard it, the FREE Market tells us this as well, consume, and this RING is well worth consuming.",1185062400,4,3748,4.955484896661368
2261913,5,B000935TVS,"This is a splendid version of Richard Wagner's ""Gotterdammerung.""  This is the fourth and final opera in the ""Ring"" series.  The DVD  provides a rich visual component, with Patrice Chereau's production on display.  While some elements of his production may not be compelling to me (characters dressed in suits or Rhinemaidens at a hydroelectric dam), it is nonetheless powerful in its own terms.  Musically, this is strong, too.  Pierre Boulez well leads the Bayreuth Orchestra.  The cast is capable.  Gwyneth Jones is not necessarily the best singing Brunnhilde ever, but she provides a rich characterization and she sings in a  serviceable manner. Manfred Jung is a credible Siegfried.  Jeannine Altmeyer portrayed Sieglinde excellently in the Chereau/Boulez version of ""Die Walkure""; here, she is more than capable as the unfortunate Gutrune.  Other singers play their role as well.

Some of the greatest scenes in all opera appear in ""Gotterdammerung.""  The Prologue (the Norn Scene, Morning, and Siegfried's Rhine Journey) and the Immolation Scene (Act III, scene 3) are up there with other great scenes, such as The Mad Scene from ""Lucia di Lammermoor,"" Act I of ""La Boheme,"" Act I of ""La Traviata,"" and Act I, scene 3 of, dare I say it, ""Die Walkure.""

I'll briefly note a few scenes to provide illustrations from the work.

The Prologue is something else again.  The three Norns sing well and expressively, as they weave the rope; they summarize key events of the Ring saga up until this point in time, noting the decline of the gods as Wotan futilely conspired to gain control of the ring and the Rheingold.  As the rope breaks, the Norns leave the stage and we see Brunnhilde and Siegfried awakening on the Valkyries' Rock.  Jones and Jung sing their rousing duet well, capturing the feeling of their rapture for one another.  Then, Siegfried's Ring Journey (and a nice touch of Brunnhilde on the Rock slowly shrinking as, presumably, he rides off to do great deeds in Brunnhilde's name).  The reality, of course, is that he is heading to betrayal and becoming the agent of the destruction of the gods.

Act III, Scene 1 is the sparkling (and somewhat lugubrious) scene between the Rhinemaidens and Siegfried.  Set again at the hydroelectric dam where we first met them in ""Das Rheingold,"" they cajole Siegfried to return the ring and gold to them.  The banter back and forth is well sung.  The Rhinemaidens seem drained and tired; the dam is dilapidated,. Perhaps signifying the deterioration of conditions since Wotan's (and the gods') power was demonstrated to be in decline in ""Siegfried"" (when the hero shattered Wotan's staff with Nothung, his sword)?

Finally, Act III, scene 3 is powerful indeed.  Brunnhilde enters dramatically, ""calling out"" her betrayers and putting Gutrune ""in her place.""  She ""takes charge,"" organizes a funeral pyre for Siegfried (and for herself).  Jones sings powerfully and is charismatic as Brunnhilde in this scene.  As the fire engulfs the couple, the Rhinemaidens take possession of the Ring and the music swells and the orchestra closes out the opera with powerful musicianship.

This is one of the finer versions of ""Gotterdammerung"" (and the complete Ring cycle, for that matter) available.  The DVD weds the music with the visual tapestry created by Chereau to good effect.  This is surely worth a look and a listen.",1182643200,2,3369,5.025270758122744
2261914,4,B000935TVS,"This recording was fine.  I want to write on the copy of Siegfried that I ordered from you.  The DVD had obviously been repackaged.  The warning and bar code tapes over the sides of the case were missing.  Also, the disc sequence was different - side two was in the front holder and side one in the back.  This has nothing to do with the quality but it does show that someone was playing around.  I also received a message that I had the wrong region code DVD.  All in all, it was very disappointing performance on your part and resulted in a loss of trust in purchasing from you.  Clarence Bruce",1181174400,3,596,4.258928571428571
2261915,4,B000935TVS,"There is much to admire about this production.  The singing is almost without exception on a very high level as is the orchestral playing.  All the characters look their parts except the dwarf Alberich (maybe he's just big for his age) In the main Kupfer's penchant for keeping the characters moving does serve the drama although at a certain point one tires of all that lurching about.  It begins to seem like all the characters are on the verge of attacking each other at any moment.  By the time you've seen all of the Ring Cycle and get to Gotterdammerung Siegfried's silliness becomes a bit overdone.  He seems more an empty headed jock than a hero of heros. Still, one could just justify it all. But then, at the very end of the opera, he throws in somthing so stupid and incongruous that it ruins the effect of the whole cycle. When are artistic administrators going to learn to say ""enough is enough.  Lets stick to the composer's ideas."" Or doesn't the composer count?",1169856000,22,977,4.586206896551724
2261916,5,B000935TVS,"Let's get the technicalities out of the way first. The source material was high resolution (analogue) video and high-quality multi-channel ambient sound. It has been ably converted to the DVD medium. I listened in DTS 5.1; apart from a few occasions where the orchestra overpowered the singers (which it probably did in the original performance), the reproduction is perfect. The lack of audience was perceptable in the rear channel, but this isn't necessarily a bad thing; it's nice to hear the closing bars without the intrusion of early applause. And isn't it splendid to hear a Bayreuth production the way King Ludwig did?

The performances? Brilliant! Absolutely no cause for complaint. I'll just mention the highlights, but please don't interpret this as a criticism of the rest - they were all Ausgezeichnet!.

John Tomlinson's Wotan showed enormous presence, with a full command of the emotional range demanded by this part. Graham Clark's Loge/Mime was a clear indicator of the outstanding abilities of this character tenor. If you haven't seen it, check out his 'David' in Meistersinger.

Jerusalem was, er, well, Jerusalem. If you've seen him in the Met production, you'll be gratified that he may have gained a few years, but he can still portray the teenage Siegfried.

Waltraud Meyer, as Waltraute, was icing on the cake.

Now, the stage direction.

There were some surprising innovations, and if you'd like to see this production complete with surprises, please stop reading now.

The non-speaking use of Wotan and Alberich was nothing short of genius. I won't go into too many details, but such scenes as the horn interchange between Siegfried and Wotan, the trick with the Waldvogel, Mime mouthing 'Wotan', Alberich and Wotan skulking around Mime's humble abode... All brought an extra dimension to the Gesamtkunstwerk. I think Wagner might have approved.

On the other hand, the beginning and end of the cycle were much less satisfactory. Others have already commented on the preamble to Rheingold, but I'll just mention the very end. In the lead up to immolation, Hagen hovered around Brunnhilde like a pickpocket. Quite a clever concept (since he was trying to snatch the ring) but bloody irritating!.

At the final moment, with Brunnhilde on the pyre, what should we see but a non-singing Greek Chorus wheel a bunch of TV sets onto the stage, and proceed to watch Valhalla's ruin, while sipping a cocktail. We, the audience, didn't get to watch the program. The 'making of' bonus track implied that it was an eerie premonition of 9/11. Yeah, well, personally I thought it was a loose end.

To sum up - if you aready have the two 'good' rings (you know which ones I mean) add this one to your collection",1169510400,12,2808,5.021551724137931
2261917,5,B000935TVS,"Wagner would be thrilled with this visual and vocal treat. Barenboim's nuanced interpretation at Bayreuth is stunning. The cast make the emotions in the music accessible--so the ""big tragedy"" is all the more shattering. Siegfried Jerusalem is heroic, yet tender as Siegfried. Check out his ""birdsong"" in act 3, and then his dying greeting to Brunhilde. It has been said before; this hero sings his heart out. Ann Evans is exquisite; a heroic voice and no skeeching! The production is uncluttered and evocative. For instance, notice how everyone who is related to Wotan are all redheads-just like him; a kind of inside observation for ""Ring"" fans...This is the final chapter for the Barenboim/Kupfer Ring, and should be viewed with the other three operas, equally entrancing!",1169510400,9,774,5.2

8056948,5,B000935TVS,"Patrice Chreaus legendary 1976 centenary production of Wagners mammoth tetralogy Der Ring des Nibelungen was one of the theatrical events of the 20th century and this DVD set (recorded in 1980) is a mandatory purchase for all Wagnerians. For once Deutsche Grammophons sales spiel does not lie. Just like Stravinskys Rite of Spring decades earlier, this staging caused a riot when it was first seen, the Bayreuth audience split right down the middle in their hatred/love of what Chreau had done to their beloved Ring. Though there had been important precursors (Joachim Herzs 1973 Leipzig production for one), Chreau confidently jumped off in a fresh direction directing the cycle in a way that had never been seen before at Bayreuth. The fact that he did so in such an accomplished way (if it was technically shoddy it would have been easier to dismiss) at the very shrine of Planet Wagner sent shock waves across the world and changed Wagner production (and arguably opera production in toto) forever.

It was Chreau who more than any other introduced into the modern conscience (his ideas actually go back through Giorgio Strehler to Walter Felsenstein in the 1930s-40s and then to Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig at the turn of the century) the idea of regietheater (directors theater) to an art-form which had hitherto been the domain of traditional naturalistic/realistic obeisance to composers stage directions. On seeing Chreaus desecration traditionalists clamored to have their naturalistic Ring returned to them and Bayreuth duly obliged in 1983 with Peter Halls faithful, but ill-fated rendering. Then there was the New York Wagner style inaugurated by Otto Schenk, his 1989 Ring held up as a model production by some, but decried as a sterile museum piece with absolutely nothing to say by others. Regietheater (or produceritis as detractors call it) on the other hand has continued unabated with sometimes outstanding, but often ridiculous results, especially at Bayreuth. The last three shock at all costs Ring productions have barely turned a head, the fact that you could still buy tickets for this years cycle on the net even after the festival had started telling its own story as director-centered ego-trips continue to drive audiences away. In truth Chreau has a lot to answer for, but from where I sit there is obviously good traditional Ring production (Nikolaus Lehnhoff, San Francisco 1990) and bad (Schenk), just as there is good regietheater Ring production (Kupfer, Bayreuth 1988) and bad (La Fura dels Baus, Barcelona, 2007). An open mind is what is required. For me the Chreau is an example of top quality regietheater which works almost perfectly. It should be noted that at Bayreuth the volatility of its hostile reception was matched by the warmth of the 90-minute standing ovation it received at the end of its final performance in 1980.

Its perhaps hard for audiences now to understand the furor surrounding Chreaus production. There have been so many weird and wonderful stagings of the Ring since that the Chreau now looks decidedly old-fashioned and is probably the regietheater production that traditionalists will like the most. In the tradition of Felsenstein Chreau pays attention throughout to the text as sung, and also respects Wagners stage directions a lot more than is given credit for. We are given the Rhine, proper giants, Alberich turning into a proper wurm and then frog, a neo-classical Valhalla, a factory floor Nibelheim, real forest settings, a romantic mountain top quasi-Greek temple Valkyrie rock, a huge dragon wheeled around on stage and a neo-classical Gibichung hall set on the shore of the Rhine. Magic fire traditionally envelops the Valkyrie rock and the tetralogy closes with an immolation of real flames with Valhalla clearly burning in the background. Wagner would have recognized this Ring and outwardly there would appear to be not a lot to complain about.

However, place Chreaus production in the context of every Bayreuth Ring production that had preceded it and the grounds for complaint become obvious. Since the re-opening of the festival in 1951 there had been four different productions, two each by Wagners grandsons  Wieland (1951 and 1965) and Wolfgang (1960 and 1970). All four had emphasized the mythic timelessness of the piece with an abstraction that had contrasted markedly with the naturalism of the three pre-war productions that had also been directed by members of the Wagner family (Wagner himself, his widow Cosima and their son Siegfried) and the 1933-42 Heinz Tietjen cycle. The post-war New Bayreuth Entrmpelung (clearing out the attic) style served the double purpose of de-politicizing Wagner (ie; stripping it of those naughty Nazi trappings) as well as returning to the ideas of Adolphe Appia and Edward Gordon Craig wherein the stage is stripped of inessentials and the central dramatic idea is honed in on and emphasized along with character psychology. For Wieland in particular it was important to return Wagner to his roots and his origins in ancient Greek tragedy. In his productions characters were turned into virtual Greek statues which combined with the spare treatment of the mise-en-scne to make for music drama which moved the audience primarily through a combination of the music and the ambiguity of time and space. Detractors accused Wieland of turning his grandfathers music dramas into oratorios, but it is now accepted that the Entrmpelung style was one ideal way of producing Wagner. Many people in that first night audience for Chreaus Ring remembered Wieland and Wolfgangs productions fondly and what they now saw amounted to downright provocation.

For Chreau social context was everything and he flouted all convention by setting the Ring squarely in the modern age of an industrializing European society. Das Rheingold is set in the late 18th century pre-industrial world, Die Walkre in the stage of early capitalism with Hunding the first entrepreneur/factory owner, Siegfried in the age of 19th century industrialism, and Gtterdmmerung in the interwar period of fascist capitalism. The pin-pointing of time and place tells us that Chreau is trying to reflect the very world that Wagner himself lived in, and also that far from characters being gods, giants and dwarfs, actually they all represent different aspects of the human species. In this respect Chreaus basic concept (though he denied ever having one as such) is undoubtedly Shavian. George Bernard Shaw argued in The Perfect Wagnerite that the Ring is centrally an allegory on the collapse of capitalism from its internal contradictions with the world of Man waiting for a hero to cleanse away the lame and cramped government of the godsReally, of course, the dwarfs, giants and gods are dramatizations of the three main orders of men: to wit, the instinctive, predatory, lustful, greedy people; the patient, toiling, stupid, respectful, money-worshipping people; and the intellectual, moral, talented people who devise and administer States and Churches. History shows us only one order higher than the highest of these: namely, the order of Heroes. Chreau with his set designer Richard Peduzzi and costume designer Jacques Schmidt set about stripping the gods of their nobility and making all the characters as close to man (to the very people sitting in the audience) as possible with a clear emphasis on the old story of capitalism encapsulated in the pursuit of power wherein the key characters destroy everything including themselves to get what they want. This left wing socialist message was of course outrageous to the right wing Bayreuth audience who (with more than a little justification!) saw the production as an attack on themselves, a point driven home most of all in Gtterdmmerung act 2 when Siegfried wears black tie, ostensibly to resemble Gunther the weak industrialist who is used by the arch-fascist Hagen, but also of course to resemble the gentlemen of the audience also in black tie and also cogs in (what socialists see as) a fascist machine.

The pursuit of power through capitalism is emphasized throughout the production with the presence of giant factory wheels half-exposed on the stage side. The opening of Das Rheingold is the very image of man abusing nature to generate power in the hydro-electric dam run by the gold lying beneath it. Theres no depiction of ideally clean nature here, the idea of the Rhinemaidens innocent virginity going for nothing. Chreau turns them into Toulouse-Lautrec whores with Alberichs head up one of their skirts presenting sex as both erotic and sordid  an alternative power source to gold. Alberich stealing the gold is very much second best to the power of sexual love which he has to foreswear as part of the deal. This scene was hugely provocative to an audience used to seeing nature pure and unsullied before the arrival of Alberich, though it is in the text (if not the stage directions!) that nature has been violated before the Ring starts with Wotan tearing down a branch from the world ash tree and going on to fashion a spear with the rules by which he seeks to rule the world. These rules have made nature subservient to man (perfectly visualized by the dam and the prostitute Rhinemaidens), and especially subservient to the talented people who devise and administer States and Churches who we meet in the very next scene  Wotan and his fellow gods. Dressed in late 18th century finery and performing on a metal factory-like stage floor with those huge wheels to the side and the finished neo-classical Valhalla (based on Haus Wahnfried, Wagners Bayreuth home) in the background, the gods deal with the giants in the manner of a modern day business transaction. The descent to Nibelheim is a descent to the proletarian factory floor, the split class setting reminiscent of Fritz Langs Metropolis.

Deeply shocking was the violence of the raw physicality on display  Wotan hacking the ring off Alberichs finger with blood visible, Fafner bashing his brother to death with his bare hands, and so the provocation goes throughout Chreaus production. In Die Walkre Hundings hut is a fancy bourgeois establishment adjacent to a factory with the owner an entrepreneur surrounded by henchmen who later corner Siegmund for him to spear nastily through the testicles (the place which had violated his wife Sieglinde) with not one, but several malevolent stabs. Siegfried act 1 is centered round a factory forge with a mechanical contraption moving of its own accord as the sword is made a-new. Wotan would appear to be behind this as he is behind the caged wood-bird planted deliberately to guide Siegfried in act 2. This violates Wagners idea of Siegfried being a free hero, but it does accentuate the idea of the Wlsung race personifying Wotans will. By the time it came to Gtterdmmerung many in the first night audience had had enough. Siegfrieds seizing of the ring from Brnnhilde is viciously presented almost like a rape. The depiction of the Gibichungs uncomfortably close to themselves was the ultimate insult to the audience and when the arch fascist Hagen rammed his spear into Siegfrieds back repeatedly with sadistic relish many members of the audience yelled out, Genug! [Enough!] Many later productions have been even more violent and transgressive to the point that audiences these days watch expecting it. But in 1976 this was all new and incendiary for conservative audiences used to watching a different world disconnected from the twisted everyday realities we are all familiar with. Throughout Chreau denies us the Greek statuary of Wieland Wagner as well as the fairy tale winged helmets, robes and tunics of Norse mythology, forcing us instead to rub our noses in Our own dirty little corner. (Tom Sutcliffe).

Alongside the provocation though Chreau gives us a series of quite wonderfully-lit sets which provide for any number of arresting and deeply memorable stage pictures. The use of spotlights is particularly inspired, especially the strong beam drilling into Alberich and the stage beneath his feet as he curses the ring. The Todesverkndigung forest setting in Die Walkre act 2 is wonderfully atmospheric with soft light contrasting with the otherworldly haloes surrounding Siegmund and Brnnhilde which plays with a huge white sheet draped over the doomed hero in a moment of genius. The preceding Wotan/Brnnhilde encounter is also deeply impressive set in a Valhalla drawing room (not Wagners mountain top!) dominated by a huge Foucaults pendulum which Wotan stops on Das Ende!! at the end of his monolog delivered to his reflection in a giant full-length mirror which he covers with his coat because he can no longer bare the sight of himself. Best of all is the Valkyrie rock modeled after Arnold Bcklins The Isle of the Dead which for once suggests the right kind of ambiguity of both time and place. Like many of the scenes, Wotans act 3 farewell is intensely romantic as is the astonishing last scene of Gtterdmmerung with one of the most convincingly satisfying immolations in my experience, Valhalla burning movingly in the background.

Im not entirely convinced that a worthy Ring can strip away the timeless mythology and still work and I would agree with detractors in saying Chreau narrows the meaning of the tetralogy down too much. The Ring may be an anti-capitalist rant, but it is obviously about much more than that. By seizing on one textual reading Chreau loses sight of all the others. And yet, the romantic stage pictures he provides combine superbly with an astonishingly high degree of quality acting to completely carry us away and convince us that this is a truly great Ring. Chreau (now sadly no longer with us) was a true man of the theater who believed in long periods of intensive rehearsal between actors leading to the finished result which is both psychologically convincing and completely real. He reduces all the characters of the Ring to mortals, but he makes them feel for and against each other in a way that in 1976 was extremely rare in the opera house. That was the most important ingredient of Chreaus revolutionary take on Wagner, namely the introduction of serious theater into opera production which had hitherto been a matter of outdated static convention. All the central relationships (Wotan/Fricka, Alberich/Mime, Siegmund/Sieglinde, Wotan/Brnnhilde, Siegfried/Mime, Siegfried/Brnnhilde) are superbly drawn with singers basically becoming their characters for the time they are before us. The erotic abandon between the Wlsungs in Die Walkre is extraordinarily intense and giddily romantic, while Wotans farewell to Brnnhilde is a matter of great tenderness and held-in passion. Siegfried/Mime make an inspired double comic act in Siegfried act 1 and those intricate little encounters in act 2 are done with obvious relish by all. The awakening of Brnnhilde and the opulence of the closing duet is outstandingly rendered in that fabulous set as is the Gtterdmmerung prologue love music farewell. Possibly the greatest single span of music in the Ring is Gtterdmmerung act 2 and Chreau makes it superbly gripping, the setting combining with the way the singers react around each other to pitch-perfect electrifying effect. On a personally romantic level this Ring leaves almost all other productions for dead. The only other production on DVD that betters it for me is the Kupfer/Barenboim 1991/92 Bayreuth version which takes off from Chreau in the fabulous movement of the singers and their acting, but in a setting (the famous worlds highway) which effectively returns the Ring to timeless mythology where it rightfully belongs. One thing Chreau does do better though is the final immolation scene which is overwhelming in its effect. Kupfers ending is a disappointing whimper beside it, but on virtually all other points, he scores over Chreau. Especially Kupfer/Barenboim were blessed with extraordinary singing.

Musically alas, the Chreau Ring is flawed, but it is better I would say than any Ring coming after it except for the Barenboim/Kupfer production. Pierre Boulez was Wieland Wagners surprise choice to conduct Parsifal in 1966 and it was he who recommended Chreau for the centenary Ring a decade later. As with Parsifal (one of the fastest readings ever in the Festspielhaus) Boulez zips through the Ring very quickly blowing away the cobwebs with an extraordinary passion which belies his cold analytic reputation. The orchestra rebelled against him in 1976, but by 1980 they had been won over and on these DVDs we hear a wonderful blend which is much closer to Karl Bhm (1966) than it is to Barenboim (1992). The problems come with the singing which is uneven. There are no problems with the Nibelungs and the giants, all four voices commanding the sound picture as they should. Hermann Becht is an outstanding if not obviously evil Alberich, Heinz Zednik excels as his slippery brother Mime and steals the show completely in Das Rheingold as Loge. Hes the link between Gerhard Stolze and Graham Clark as great Bayreuth Loge/Mimes. Matti Salminen and Fritz Hbner make perfect baleful black as black giants. Salminen is my favorite Hunding on record while Hbner dominates the stage as Hagen with superb malevolence. The Wlsungs make a very good looking pair, Peter Hoffman singing with heroic ardor and making those cries of Wlse! long and spine-tingling. Jeannine Altmeyer is a slightly unsteady Sieglinde (not ideally pure of tone) and makes for a wobbly Gutrune. Hanna Schwarz makes a biting Fricka firm of tone and decisive (her appearance in Walkre act 2 is a highlight). The biggest problems come with the biggest roles and as they are on the stage the longest, this is a serious flaw. I have to say that I cant be completely objective about this recording. This was my first Ring recording, the one I listened to on LP endlessly as a teenager pouring over the libretti with an enthusiasm I can barely muster now. Inside me Donald McIntyre, Manfred Jung and Gwyneth Jones have always been Wotan, Siegfried and Brnnhilde, and I love their performances deeply, but when I later discovered the best Ring recordings of the 50s and 60s (Bhm, Krau, Knappertsbusch especially) I realized the shortcomings of what I had been used to. McIntyres Wotan is of the noble type, ideal for Das Rheingold, but ill-equipped to reveal the complexities we see in Die Walkre let alone the world weary bitterness of the Wanderer in Siegfried. His voice is soft, sometimes underpowered and never less than dignified, but he doesnt capture Wotan in his fullness (on record for me only Hermann Uhde, Hans Hotter and later John Tomlinson do that). Manfred Jung would be welcomed today as a savior among heldentenoren, but sadly the microphones reveal his less than heroic tone which must qualify a gallant effort. He gives much pleasure, but cannot get to the places Siegfried Jerusalem let alone Wolfgang Windgassen could. Jerusalem by the way gives a cameo here as Froh which is very effective. Dame Gwyneth alas is the biggest problem for me, a wildly unpredictable voice spreading at the top and wobbling at the bottom. As a teenager I was astonished by her thinking that her singing of the love duets and then the immolation was extraordinary, but when I heard Birgit Nilsson, Astrid Varnay and Martha Mdl do it I realized what I had been missing. One thing does remain with me about Dame Gwyneth and that is the way she sings Ruhe, ruhe, der got [Rest now o god] early in her immolation scene. That send shivers up my spine in a way that no other singer even has or probably ever will!

A mandatory Ring for all Wagnerians then, its a legendary production well worth paying close attention. Chreaus directing is outstanding in every way. Musically its not as great, but then I don't think its as bad as some have said, and certainly on DVD only the Kupfer/Barenboim Bayreuth Ring betters it. Finally I should mention that the aspect ratio is 4:3 as this comes from the days before wide screen. The images have been cleared up by remastering but ghosting is still inevitable in scenes where light and dark are contrasted in extremes. There are no problems with the sound which is full, bright and relays that amazing Bayreuth glow.

..........................................................................
Gotterdammerung by Barenboim review as follows:

The biggest surprise for me when first experiencing this set of the Ring was the effect of considerable movement - much of it fast and urgent. This is a concept far from the old style of `stand and deliver' and it achieves a considerable accumulative effect when followed through the whole set of four operas. However, for the purposes of this review I will restrict myself to this single opera.

Quick movement is important to this production as mentioned above. Considerable use is made of the vast stage at Bayreuth so that the settings can be built on an appropriately huge scale and so that characters can move rapidly around unfettered by limitations of space. This enables this entire production to differ fundamentally from many other conceptions that are more constrained by spatial considerations and which frequently have far less urgent movement and which have to rely upon other means to achieve their purpose.

Quite apart from the purely musical considerations, this set makes extensive use of laser technology. This is often in the form of shafts of light than can vary in thickness from narrow shafts to sheets of colour. Obvious examples are the flame effects or the Rhine waters at the end.

The time period is established as modern to futuristic but of an indeterminate moment as in Gunther's home or in the clothing choices throughout. Key dramatic staging moments are effective although I initially found Gunther's home rather sparse but finally effective as a stage for Brunnhilde. The sense of the epic is totally established throughout this set. This is drama writ large and Barenboim, the producer, the cast and the orchestra fully deliver on all counts.

None of this would be worthwhile of course if the musical values were inadequate. In this case the whole cast delivers consistently high standards with not a weak moment anywhere. It is a great advantage in having the same cast maintained throughout the Ring for the individual parts. Even in this illustrious company a special mention needs to be made of Anne Evans as Brunnhilde who is both a believably attractive partner for Siegfried and is vocally magnificent as an heroic character. The recorded sound throughout fully supports Barenboim's driving energy. Marvellous.

The recording dates from 1992 but has already been digitally enhanced and would presumably be a strong candidate for a future Blu-ray presentation. What cannot be solved is the considerable amount of trailing light as the film technology of the time could not keep up with the faster actions in the predominantly dark lighting. However I personally find the trailing image effects surrounding the various characters as they move swiftly about rather effective as it emphasises their essentially unpredictable and often unbalanced mental and physical speed. Strange, as normally I would find this a distracting visual problem but it is almost a total positive here. The sound is thrillingly 'real' and is presented in DTS 5.1 and stereo.

I also own the Blu-ray set by La Fura Dels Baus which is quite another type of satisfying experience and certainly not a direct competitor.
Nevertheless I unhesitatingly find that this is my benchmark preferred version and therefore equally unhesitatingly give it the full 5 stars even bearing in mind the 1992 recording issues as described above.",1342396800,,3958,5.243285939968405
8056953,3,B000935TVS,"Give me a break! For once I have to agree with those who carp about 'modernizing' opera productions. This Gtterdmmerung, with its manifold attempts at relevance and meaningfulness, renders Richard Wagner's doubtful drama hopelessly kitschy and pretentious. So much of the stage business and 'acting' simply distracts one from the only really worthwhile element of the opera, the music per se. I put up with the modernizing in the first three DVDed operas from the Bayreuth Festspiele, but in Gtterdmmerung it has gone too far. Indeed, as one previous reviewer groaned, what the devil was the stage business at the final curtain supposed to mean, when that crowd of everyday Germans of various ages trundled on stage with martini glasses and humongous TV sets? ""Don't be frightened, little Elselein, it's only a movie! It's not the end of the world!""

Ah, if only Wagner had written symphonies instead of his interminable music-dramas! He was a symphonist of craft and 'Kraft'. He could have thrown in some choral movements, as Beethoven and Mahler did, setting poems by Heinrich Heine or Walter von der Vogelweide. Instead we have to suffer through his meretricious librettos and his pernicious philosophy in order to get a dose of his orchestral majesty. Had he written symphonies, even over-sized and over-stuffed symphonic poems, he might have been a composer stature equal to ... Berlioz? Sibelius?

[Yes, of course I'm being provocative. Take it with a grin. ""Ein Lachs muss stromaufwrts schwimmen.""]

Now, about that libretto ... The whole Ring Cycle is a sordid tale of greed and lust, perfidy and betrayal, mostly achieved through sleazy tricks. It's not a wholesome parable for children. Wotan is an inscrutable megalomaniac, a typical God in short. Siegfried first appears, in the second opera of the cycle, as a boyish simpleton, not unlikable, but by his appearance in Gtterdmmerung, he's matured into a swaggering braggart without developing an iota of wisdom. His sheer narcissistic stupidity is the driving force in the plot. World Hero that he is 'anointed' to be, he's not truly Master of either his own Will or his own Fate. Der Willen und das Werden - vilja og vera - were the basic quasi-Manichean polarities of the old Norse/Teutonic mythologies, and to that degree Wagner was true to his sources.

And now, about that philosophy ... Wotan is of course the actual protagonist of the Ring Cycle, even though he doesn't get to sing in the finale. It's Wotan's over-reaching in the quest for knowledge, his hubris, that sets the whole conflagration going. The parallels with the Biblical account of Adam and Eve and the Tree of Knowledge cannot be ignored; mortals who aspire to be Gods will not be tolerated. Hey, Pride runneth before a Fall, nicht wahr? Oy, if only Wagner's 20th C German and Austrian admirers -- you know who?-- had understood that moral from the opera! But obviously Wagner was ambiguous even to himself.

On quite a different level, the Ring Cycle, especially its final installment, is a drama of racial conflict, essentially the subterranean Nibelungen versus the Upper Earth Humans and their lookalike Gods. And perhaps any racial conflict becomes a fight-to-the-death, a genocide, but what Wagner gives us is a Pyrrhic victory by self-destruction, self-cremation. How bizarrely prophetic!  Wotan and the valkyries in their black leather storm jackets! Those black-shirted stormers would indeed get immolation returned in kind by the RAF in 1944. Don't blame me for linking Wagner and Nazi atrocities; the linkage is implicit in this very production from Bayreuth. I'm simply explicating it on behalf of directors Harry Kupfer and Wolfgang Wagner.

Watch it? Sure! Everybody ought to read Homer, the Bible, and Shakespeare. Everybody ought to visit the Parthenon and other heaps of classical rubble. Everybody ought to hear Der Ring des Nibelungen.

Ibbidy, ibbidy, ibbidy, that's all, folks!",1323388800,4,3934,5.126365054602184
8056954,5,B000935TVS,"I've never seen a better and more imaginative production than this one, yet nothing is overblown. It's a timeless production. One would never guess it was made almost 20 years ago. The singers, too, are superb. This is  what I imagine Wagner himself would have liked: a Gesammtkunstwerk, or Total Artwork, combining the best in  staging, voices and acting with an orchestra conducted by the incomparable Daniel Bahrenboim. Wagner 'groupies' like myself only wish we could have been there, in the Bayreuth theatre, to see the live performance.",1289174400,,542,5.1477272727272725
8056955,5,B000935TVS,"Most productions of Gotterdammerung tend to drag until the exciting finale where Brunnhilde returns the Ring to the Rhein.  Because of Barenboim's diligence in ensuring that all the leitmotif ""signature tunes"" come through, this Gotterdammerung is less susceptible to the dragging periods.  Siegfried's and Gunter's swearing Blutbrudershaft is punctuated by leitmotifs recalling Alberich's curse and the doom that clouds this brotherhood.  It is a reverse image of Wotan and Loge as they bargain with Alberich, way back in Das Rheingold.  Barenboim sees that Wagner's leitmotif reminds us of that.

Just as Siegfried Jerusalem seemed born for the role of Siegfried (at least namesake wise), so Waltraud Meier makes an exceptional Waltraute.  Her admonitions to Brunnhilde remind us of why Gotterdammmerung is taking place:  the gold must be returned to the Rhein.

Gotterdammerung is only as powerful as its Brunnhilde.  Anne Evans delivers that power, maintaining a stage presence and seizing Hagen's spear, even breaking it in two.

Perhaps it's Wagner's reminder to take a look at mankind's history of destruction, but in the bonus section, Daniel Barenboim explains how the final scene was filmed before the terrorist attack in New York on September 11th.  Much as the world watched this horrible destruction on their tv sets, Gotterdammerung ends with ""the cocktail set"" watching the action on tv sets on stage.  Wagner seems to have wanted us to watch and reflect on what we had just witnessed.",1231632000,2,1500,5.309322033898305
8056956,5,B000935TVS,"Wagner was German without apology, loved being German, loved the Geman people at least as much as he ever loved or was able to love anything in his long, twistied and excruciating creative life.  The fervor of that love of his is so intense that even after more than a century we can warm our hands over its embers here, at century mark of his career's apex, with a view of the incomparable RING  This production once thought so controversial is typical of the period of its conception by Chereau and Boulez, because it is both conceptual and post-modern.  It is rather like one of the telephones one saw in those days, which were made of clear plastic and allowed you to examine and to enjoy the view and the function of the ""innards"" of the device as the transistors and wires lit up and flashed while the instrument was being used..

We should remember that before Wagner set anything to music, he wrote and published the libretti in verse that became, over time THE RING OF THE NIBELUNGENS.  He began around 1848 and finished orchestrating the final opera GOTTERDAMMERUNG,  in 1874.  However, the production dates don't seem to fit because DAS RHINEGOLD was presented in 1852; DIE WALKURE in 1856; SIEGFRIED (begun in 1848 as SIEGFRIED'S DEATH) in 1869.  What took him so long?  He was a sought-after symphonic conductor.  He'd already proved he could write opera successfully, when RIENZI was presented.  But ultimately, that work didn't please him, and is now neglected.  He wanted to get away from the School of Meyerbeer and the Franco-Latin tradition.  Though far from being a linguist, in suceeding years Wagner taught himself how to become not merely a librettist, but a dramatist.  He did this by studying the then new translations into German of the Greek Tragedies.  His model for declamation and versification and dramatic structure was Aschelus.  In sixth century BC Athens, Tragedy meant a series of narrative odes relating to the history of (a) god, or of other devine or heroic figures intersperced wth episodes --- in which some actor represented an adventure by means of narrative or dialogue with chorus.  It was Aschelus who invened the Trilogy and the Tetralogy.  And so, Richard decided to do what Aschelus did, but in the German language, and without compromising that languages peculiar characteristics.  Needless to say, it worked, and it is this production of THE RING which, preminently, allows me to examine and to delight in, not just the music; not just the singing, but all the aspects of the creation.

THE PROLOGUE begins in darkness as the Norns, three shapeless, occult females, spin, twist and snip the skien of life.  They are the German version of The Fates or Furies of Greek Tragedy.  As Erynyes they seek out and punish those who break oaths.  Here, they recite the story of Wotan and how he paid for his wife Frica with an eye, and how he came into his godhead.  It is this recitation that forecasts the tone of GOTTERDAMMERUNG in its entirety.  The Norns do not forecast anything, as the three ""midnight hags"" of MACBETH do.  In their trance-like state these witches only remind us of what has gone before.  And abruptly, without explanation, one of the life skiens snaps.  They are puzzled and frightened by the event and run off to ""the Mother"" who is probably Erde, (or Demeter) the Earth-Mother.

Now, Wagner undestood that when Aschelus and the other tradigians wrote, they wrote for an audience already intimately familiar with the material of his stories, which material was taken directly from Greek religion.  And he knew that this material had nothing whatever to do with the Judeo-Christian tradition.  Therefore, when he went to the old Norse Sagas and the lore of the Celts for material he resolved not to dilute it's religious purity with 19th century sentimentality.  He wrote for Germans as he imagined Tacitus to have seen  them when they were a semi-nomadic, partly civilized and nearly naked, loose association of tribes living not in towns, but in the woodlands and bogs that bordered the Roman Empire to the south.  Tacitus saw these folk as being a superstitious and magical-minded lot.  ""No people are more addicted to divination by means of casting lots,"" or rune-reading.  Everything, wih them, is suffused witm some occult meaning.  And that, to my mind, is the essential character of DIE GOTTAMMERUNG; It is like entering and wandering through a temple during an arcane ceremony, in which every symbl, every action has more than one meaning, and in which people of flesh and blood become possessed by invisible beings.  We surrender to the occultism in order to inhale like resinous smoke the atmosphere of a foreign world, to become intoxicated by it and, finally to understand and accept it.

When the curtains part on the second part of the Prelude, we see Brunnhilde who has risen from her marital bed before dawn, and paces the area outside the Walkyre rock where her cave and home is.  She appears to be a least distressed and puzzled by her new human state: She is not only a woman, but a married woman.  Everything she dreaded has come to pass.  Nevertheless, it is in his preliminary scene that she sees Siegfried sleeping, almost exactly as he first saw her sleeping in the same place and in the same pose, in SIEGFRIED.  Magnificen conceptt!  Siegfried wakes, shattering her reverie, and they exchange gifts.  She gives him her shield, armor and horse Grane, and he gives her his ring and title to all his Nibelungen wealth.  They embrase fervently, and he races off.  Tacitus tells us that ""Among them the matrimonial bond is strict and severe.  Almost singular among the barbarians, they cntent themselves with one wife.""  That ""the exchange of arms between a man and a woman IS the ancient German wedding ceremony, making the celebrants one, for as long as they live.  Siegfried acceptsher in exactly the same manner, a partner and an equal, and when she bestows her breastplate he says, ""In dises Schildes Schin, ich Siegfried uch ich nicht.""..etc.)  Or, ""By accepting your sheltering sheid I am no more Siegfried, but am now Brunnehilde's arm.""  The sacredness of their exhange of weapons justifies the welcome but otherwise incomprehensible glory of the music.  And the music is indeed glorious.  (How did Boulez inspire his orchestra?)  As one progresses through this opera one has the impression that the orchestra has gotten fresher and stronger and more dynamic as well as more lyrical, somehow -- particularly if one's watched THE RING from first to last.  Wonderful music throughout, of course!  But possibly its because although Wagner wrote the ""dramatic poem"" or libretto a decade or two before, he only orchestated it in 1874, when he was at the height of his powers.  An embarassment of riches.

Then, where's Grane?  Though some productions allow Brunnhilde to ride or at least to lead an horse on stage, this one does not.  Grane does not appear because he animal is unnecessary.  The animal is only a symbol of the Valkyre's occult power:  It is her totem, her familiar, the aura and vehicle of her divinity.  ""The Germans, "" Tacius writes, ""Are acquainted with the practice of divining from the songs and flights of birds, but it is peculiar to them - - - to derive admonitions and pressages from horses also.  Certain of them -- milk-white and untouched by earthly labor -- are pastured at public expense.  Priests and Kings ""observe their manner of neighing and snorting.  Priests consider hem as ministers of the gods, as privy to the devine will.""

Meanwhile, after spectacular music wonderfully well played, we find ourselves downrier at the palace of the Gibichungs and in the presence of yet another Chereau TIME TRICK.  Soon we will find that this latest reality is or will be Siegfried's destination.  The set is brilliant; simple and effective at offering the illusion of sumptuousness but without the clutter.  Four extremely tall columns of polished black stone set on either side of what must be a riverside terrace.  There's a narrow estuary or inlet just beyond, and standing on the opposite shore, the silouhete of what apears to be a twin of this structure.  Here, we find King Gunther, a tall, thin gentleman in evening dress, talking wih rather an ordinary-looking bearded man in a coarse, rumpled brown possibly tweed suit.  This is Hagen, Gunther's (almost certaily illigetimate) half-brother, and a sour, loutish fellow..  There's something disturbing about him; its not only tha he's dressed inappropriately for a palace, but that he exudes a kind of familiarity that looks like contempt, and we don't know why.  And Gunther?  Who is he supposed to be?  Is it a semi-historical Wagnerian portrait set into the opera like a trebel-entend?  Is he supposed to be Wagner's friend and one-time son-in-law, Hans von Bulow?  Franz Mazurka looks as t;hough he belongs on a podium.  The three of them sing very well, in character, but again, there's nothing lyrical about the writing; its just Wagnerian declamation.  And, it calls for the rare ability to sing at full voice -- and on pitch -- while giving the impression that one is talking.  That accomplished, one goes about acting the part of the character.  And then there's Gutrune.  Gunther's sister sauners on and her dress fixes us in a definate hisorical era; its 1932 - 1934, though her dark hair is later and her underwear is definately conemporary.  Jeanine Altemeier as Gutrune wears a floor-length white satin dress and a rope of pearls.  She is the kind of woman for whom such dresses are made, and though she is revealed to be without either character or intelligence -- and therefore deserving of Hagenn's scorn -- she looks wonderful, Altemeier can act, and she certainly sings very, very well.

What's happening?  Hagen (Fritz Hobner) is putitng a plot in motion.  It's a pity.  You play an unsympathetic character well, true to the character, and nobody likes you.  You know the story; he's going to use the Gibichungs to get Siegfried in his possession in order that he can kill him and get the ring and his treasure.  It' beautifully acted out here because it is so well directed.  When Siegfried appears, looking like an up and coming athletic  young man in a metal breastplate, Hagen gets Gutrune to slip him the nickey she's brewed up (J.I.C.) Siegfried drinks and stumbling, his long-term memory destroyed, he lusts drunkenly for Gutrune.  He says that he and Gunther will be as brothers, and that he will find a worthy bride for him.  They become blood-brothers and go off to find this perfect woman Siegfried recommends, leaving Hagen alone to sit in Gunther's chair.

It seemed to me that at this point the director chose to show us that the character of Hagen (whoever he may have been) is not who he seems to be.  His mannerisms, the spear, the color and texture of the suit?  If we recollect the scenes of McIntyre and Becht sneaking through the woods together in SIEGFRIED, their twin outfits of rough brown wool, sniffing around Fafner's cave, we can see that it is not Alberich who has changed, but Wotan.  The man Hagen has been overtaken by Wotan, and frequntly sounds like him.  Now and here, glowering center stage, he is much as Waltraute described Wotan, burning with resentment and anticipation.

CHANGE OF SCENE.  At the Valkyre rock Brunnhilde is left wiating and ponderin her state.  In this scene more than in any other, I'm made aware of the nature of Brunnhilde's power in the story:  She hovers over all the RING like Quan Yin, a Bhodissatva of Empathy who resigns her divinity to wait on Earth  until all lesser beings like ourselves, shall have attained Nirvana or Enlightenment.  She defies Time.  And it is probably in this aspet and for this unusual and very spiritual portrayal of the heroine that Gwenneth Jones will be long remembered.

At any rate, it is in this state that Walraute, who arrives as lightening crackles, finds her sister.  Waltraute is frantic with worry and she tells Brunnhilde that their father Wotan, distraught by his defeat at Sigfried's hands, now sits on his throne, glowering and silent, the pieces of his ashwood spear on his lap, and all the trees of his sacred Ash grove cut down and split into logs.  These lie piled up around Vallah and himself, like a pallisade of firewood.  ""Only the ring can save him.  You must give it to me,"" Waltraute pleads, ""In order that I can return it to him.""  Brunnhilde refuses.  They struggle for the ring until, triumphant, Brunnhilde says that whatever may happen, the ring was given to her by Siegfried, ""who loves me,,"" and whatever may happen, the ring is a token of his love, ""And I will never part with it.""  Defeated, horrified by the prospect of what is to be, Waltraute flees.

In this prolonged and emotionally intense scene, Jones is assisted by a great and sensitive director who, without diluting her persona as Brunnhilde, allows Gwendolyn Killebrew as Waltraute, everything needed to share the stage in an emotionally demanding duet.  Most effective!  One doesn't know if this is moot or not, but in this production the part of Waltraute is sung by a woman with a dark, brown face.  Myself, I'd noticed the actress earlier on the Valkyre rock with her sisters, but paid no mind.  We are so used to seeing black women on stage singing Opera now, that it didn't seem wothy of notice until, last night, when I wondered whether despite her obvious abilities, Miss Killebrew's skin pigmentation might have provoked some of the harsh reaction to this production?  In those days, might her non-aryan appearance at Beyreuth have been seen as a threatening novelty?  A token of disrespect for an old tradition of exclusivity?

Eventually, alone again, Brunnhilde examining and meditating on her wedding ring, settles into a contemplative quiet that is shattered when a masked intruder appears and accosts her.  It is Siegfried wearing his Tarnhelm and disguised as Gunther, and it is in Gunther's name that (as proxy) he takes Brunnhilde's wedding ring and forces her to bed wih him in her cave until moring.  In this ugly scene Brunnhilde is insulted by avin her marriage violated, and further demeaned by being put on the level of a common fornicatrix.  As a mortal woman she is immediately in danger not merely of being ostracised, but of being executed, for punishment for adultery is instant.  ""Among the Germans,"" Tacitus tells us, ""None looks on vice with a smile, or calls mutual seduction the way of the world.""

In ACT TWO, afer a haunting and protracted duet between Alberich and Hagen that feels more like an anxiety nightmare than anyhting else, we find ourselves in the mansion of the Gibichungs, and it is from this point on that, for me, the action of GOTTERDAMMERUNG truly begins.  I think of the music-drama as BRUNNHILDE'S HUMILIATION.  Hagen summons the townspeople and soon there's quite a lot of very fine choral singing.  Then, presently,  Siegfried will drag Brunnhilde into what now appears to be a town square, and present her as now belonging and betrothed to Gunther.  It is shocking.  I have never seen an enrance quite like it; never have I seen anything so illustrative of disgrace and abject shame.  Her disgrace is a kind of spectacle for the townspeople.  It seems in essence to be a symbol of all women who have ever been mistreated and abused, everywhere.  Jones handles it supremely well -- though I don't know she is able to hold the semi-supine posture for so long -- and things go along reasonably well until Siegfried, who's gone off to change, returns and wonders why the woman is behaving so ridiculously.  He approaches and tries to life her up.  She sees him and is aghast; he looks like a handsome young bridegroom in a rented tuxedo.  And truly, Jung has never looked better.  But the damn bursts and Brunnhilde accuses him of having first married and then seduced and then abandoned her; of haing tricked her from the beginning.  She rages and demands justice.  He denies everything, and everybody petends to believe him.  They drag her off to witness what had been expected to be a double wedding, as she howls for revenge.  Hagen asks her how to kill Siegfried and she reveals to him that her magic protects all of Siegfried's body except for a place high on his back.

ACT THREE:  After an extended orchestral passage of great beauty and mysery, we're at the hydroelectric facility on the river, and the Rhinemaidens appear to sing and twist and write around the pylons.  They appear to miss their gold and carry on abou it for a while, until Siegfried appears.  They flirt with him and try to persuade him to return the ring and the gold to them, but he has no inention of doing it.  (Although the girls are supposed to look old and tired, in this production they are most attractive and sing deliciously.  That he doesn't give way to their demands is a testament to his wooden-headedness, rather than to his character.)  Eventually the hunting party arrives.  It's what one does on one's wedding day; one goes hunting.  It's Gunther and the guys.  They've brought deer carcasses and feel the time has come to have a sit-down venison dinner.  Siegfried wants to sing, and does.  He jump up and begins a song that like some other arias in the opera, talks of something that's happened in the past.  In this case its a re-telling of his life with Mime; of his battle with the dragon, and of Mime's death.  Hagen gives him to drink what turns out to be an antidote to the drug he's already ingested, and knocked almost senseless, he begins to recall BRUNNHIHLDE.  And it is at this piont that Hagen kills him with the spear.  He doesn't die easily or quickly, but it is in the final third of his aria that Manfred Jung delivers what may well be the pinnacle of his performance in this demanding but unsympatheic role.  His performance throughout has been as full and convincing as his singing has been solid and right.  If he has not persuaded some to see him as an heroic tenor, it may well be that he is playing the part of a man who is flawed, and in a sense soul-less:  A suit of armor with a child inside.  But the part of Siegfried is certainly heroic in its demands.

There's that wonderful funeral march, which is played wonderfully, and soon we find ourselves on the quai of that proto-hanseatic town Chereau and company have given us, with all the townspeople present.  The body is presented, laid down, and after explaining to Gutrune and others that she was and remains married to Siegfried, she takes back the ring.  There is a great deal of singing by everybody, and the stage is indeed busy as the funeral pyre is being built, but towad the end of it Brunnhilde begins her mourning for Siegfried (and for her father too, it appears) and this seems to me to be one of the best things Jones does in the RING  For if her high notes are adequate but not remarkable, her mid-range is very, very good.  Her lament from ""Ruhe!  ruhe, du Got!"" is heartbreakingly sad and noble.  Eventually she lights the pyre, and throws the ring into the river.  As the flames rise she finds her way through the crowd to the fire and jumps into it as the music like the fire itself rises.  Hagen. follows after her still crying out for the ring.  Walhalla appears in all its splendor, burning until it too is consumed and tumbles like an old wood fire, into the river, which swirling around all, consumes all as the Rhinemaidens sing.

Caught up in all this and watching all those ordinary looking German people standing around staring into the flames, I asked myself, ""That horror!  What was it?  Dresden?""  And I didn't know, and don't know.  But I watch as all those men, women and children turn from the conflagration they've witnessed, to look at us, expressionless, as if to ask ""Did you see what we saw?""
