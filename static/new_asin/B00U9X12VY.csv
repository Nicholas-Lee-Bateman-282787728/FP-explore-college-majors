She is such an amazing teacher; I have learned so much from her in person and even though our classes have ended I will now have the tools, accessories, and knowledge from her training to enable me to perform as a better massage therapist. Now, you too can learn from her in this DVD set. Carol is deliberate, empathetic, and intentional in her teaching of massage therapy techniques. Carol loves to show forearm work and these DVDs are a great way to learn her methods.",1467676800,,567,4.568627450980392
