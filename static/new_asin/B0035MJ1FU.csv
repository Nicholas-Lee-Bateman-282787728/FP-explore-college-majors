8389180,2,B0035MJ1FU,"This is apparently one volume of the 4 volume set, of which there appears to be only one in existence.  So for me a better purchase was just the 4 volume set.  This telenovela is an abridged version in 4 disks, probably about 12 hours  of viewing out of an orginal perhaps 100 hours.  A telenovela is an extended series, a novel made into a long screen play that often lasts less than a year.  A telenovela is not an unending (yuck) soap opera.  The main virtue of ADconLG is that it is put out in the USA with Spanish captions (not on this disk set, however).  Only one network puts out telenovelas with both Spanish and English captions, Telemundo, which is not the broadcaster of ADCLG.
I say that the main virtue is the Spanish captions (for those wanting to learn Spanish), since ADCLG is a remake of the original (Mueca Brava), a great original telenovela, much better done IMHO.  However, I don't know of a source of Mueca Brava that has Spanish captions.

MB needs Spanish captions for those of us who are not native of Argentina.  MB has Espaol Argentino with slang and very rapid delivery.  Even if you know Spanish, you will probably have a lot of trouble understanding MB at times.  MB is on YouTube with English captions, however (also Greek & who knows what else).  Since ADCLG closely follows MBZ at first, one can use ADCLG to help one understand MB.  ADCLG apparently is a Mexican remake and much easier to understand, if you aren't from Argentina.

The two-stars is because the listings did not make it clear to me that this volume was superfluous if you had the 4 disc set.  By itself I would give it 4 stars.

I have been told that after a while ADCLG departs from the original MB story and has a distinctly different ending from MB.",1283558400,,1753,4.445141065830721
