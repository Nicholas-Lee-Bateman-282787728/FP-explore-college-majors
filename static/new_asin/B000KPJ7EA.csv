8158584,5,B000KPJ7EA,"I have most of the dvds of Sylvia Loch and some seem to me for the advanced rider. At least, I often felt I still could not grasp all the information that was presented in them and maybe it is because I should have had dressage training lessons.
I would recommend, before I go on, to watch Sylvia Loch dvds with those by Jane Savoie, since they are a good supplement to each other - and, they are both just great and enthusiastic horse people. You can always learn more, and the best instruction dvds are unfortunately too hard to find!
Having said that, this set is very good. I like for instance the part about how the stomach and back work together in riding, and how to 'think' forward with the body position. Many other gems are here. By merely explaining how we can mimic our own body position needed for a certain clue, whether it is the right canter lead, or shoulder in, we see how it feels for us. And then we see how it feels for the horse 'pressure wise'. Things like 'more weight on inside leg or stirrup' or 'moving upward' etc become finally clear since you can feel it for yourself. Many things are covered, like how to help with bodywork to stop (by thinking 'upward'!), and how to help with bodywork to get the right canter lead, how to do various dressage exercises etc.
Try to do the same walking exercises that the women on the video do to feel yourself how inside and outside leg, the hips and seat bone work! For instance, by walking a circle and then keeping on at the track in a straight line, you feel how your body position (upper body and legs) 'makes' the shoulder in. 'Copying' this position on your horse will make him mimic you, and it shows how body position alone has a huge effect on giving the right clue, more than reign aids would. I am new to dressage since I have an Icelandic horse and dressage is relatively new here in Iceland, but this will surely help me training myself to sit better and ride circles better and getting a go on shoulder-in. It should be on amazon.com too!",1380412800,3,2018,4.341269841269841
