8233248,3,B000YKYT2Q,"This is my favorite of all ballets, but given a lacklustre treatment and an unfortunate ballerina.  Komleva, whom I've seen live, never gets anywhere close to lighting up the stage in anything.  There are numerous better productions among which to choose, that this is only worthwhile for being the earliest full-length recording of it.  This is one of Petipa's masterpieces.  That this video doesn't live up to his vision, is hardly his fault.  There are two versions, one by Natalia Makarova and one by Rudolf Nureyev, for me Makarova's version, which includes the final act, is by far superior for that reason as well as for having cut some of the extraneous material.  Nureyev's version for the Paris Opera Ballet lacks the final act, but the company allows him to give us the spectacle Petipa's audience would have wanted.",1385251200,2,827,4.913669064748201
8233249,2,B000YKYT2Q,"I bought the ballet because of the Kingdom of the Shades part that I had seen on You Tube. This is a very attractive sequence of music, rather like the second act of Giselle, and I thought perhaps the whole ballet was as good. It was not. The entire first act is full of banal music and pointlessly hyperactive dancing that really hasn't much to recommend it. And I fear as a result my dislike even spread to the Kingdom of the Shades portion. There, as the women lift their legs periodically I could not help but think of dogs and trees.",1350777600,2,538,4.284313725490196
8233250,3,B000YKYT2Q,"The thing I like best about this 1977 Bayadere is seeing the older Kirov staging.  Some of the sets are grand and very imaginative, but unfortunately the staging overall is not even, nor the cinematography.  The technical excellence of the dancers in the Kingdom of the Shades is noteworthy, they have tremendous control.  One thing that I didn't like at all was the audience.  In the beginning they are fairly quiet, but as the filming went on, you can hear the same people yelling Bravo! and the audience as a whole gets braver with more clapping in the middle of dancing, and then afterward to demand an extra bow from the dancers.  Bah, after awhile it ruins watching the video, they sound like an inexperienced ballet audience.  So, this DVD has some plusses and some minuses, it suffers from its age, and probably should have been filmed without an audience.  The first third is the best part.

If you can only have one Bayadere, I too suggest the Paris Opera DVD, the sets are stunning, the dancers very accomplished.  (And no terrible audience to contend with, either.)

By the way, the Royal Ballet's DVD with Tetsuya Kamakawa as the Bronze Idol is worth having just to see the Idol dance.  It is really thrilling, the best Idol of all.  It's a newer production, very enjoyable.",1296086400,2,1287,4.671111111111111
8233251,5,B000YKYT2Q,"I only have this one copy of La Bayadere so I cannot compare it with others, as Ivy Lin is able to do. By the way, I like to read Ivy Lin's reviews for her honesty and knowledge of subject, and use her reviews to help me make purchasing decisions.

I will have to view this ballet several more times before I can say that I love the music of Ludwig Minkus. I must say that I liked the music of the act three Entrance of the Shades. By reading Ivy Lin's review I now know why I felt there was something missing from this story. That is, some sort of retribution for Nikia's murder. Prince Solor seems to be a real coward and does not deserve her continued love, even in an after life. There seems to be other versions of this ballet showing the destruction of the temple during the wedding of Solor and Gamzatti, which would be a fitting end after the treachery of Gamzatti and the Rajah. La Baradere is over 130 minutes as it is, and to add another act, would require another 10/15 minutes making it quite long indeed.

Someone said the costumes were somewhat dowdy, but seemed quite sexy to me. Especially the female part of the Indian Dance. She was ravishing, and she had more fun than anyone else. All the sets were very well done, and one must say the Russians must have the largest of everything including their theater stages and must have them filled to capacity with people (or elephants). There must have been 60/65 people on stage during the Betrothal Scene. The lighting was good even in the night scenes of the Shades, where there is proof that these ballerinas are human after all when, at the end of the dance of the Shades two of them including at least one of the soloists lose their balance and have to hop on one foot to keep from falling . I can't hold that against them, however, since I sometimes lose my balance just putting on my pants. One must remember, the young ballerina who nearly lost her balance had just done 37 exceedingly difficult arabesque movements as she descended the slopes of the Himalayan mountains, and was doing another when her knee buckled slightly. I forgive her, but I wonder if her boss did?

PS, I now have two copies of La Bayadere, this beautiful Kirov Ballet version and the Paris Opera Ballet version,,,,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Minkus-La-Bayadere-Guerin-Hilaire-Platel-Paris-Ballet/dp/B000294T5G/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Minkus - La Bayadere / Guerin, Hilaire, Platel, Paris Ballet</a>.... which is equally beautiful. The POB version has a sharper image due to the fact that it was filmed in High Definition. The sets in the POB version have only a slight edge in quality over the Kirov, but the dancing by the principles in both versions was very good. The corps de ballet in the POB had ""togetherness"" down pat, they were close to perfect. My version is imported (PAL), is a 3/4 video format version and the sound quality is excellent stereo and surround sound, and also available in Blu Ray. Color and lighting were good in both versions. By the way, I have grown to love Minkus' music. You won't go wrong with either version.......Richard.",1216425600,12,3146,4.758241758241758
8233252,3,B000YKYT2Q,"I agree with the reviewer who praises the dancing of Terekhova and Komleva-- but who also notes that the latter is a bit compact and not too glamorous. Since size is not a litmus test (but does matter), I made this my third Bayadere DVD and was neither disappointed nor transported.  It's hard to go wrong with the Kirov, and if this were the only performance available, I would give it a higher rating, because one must have a Bayadere.  But the more recent Paris Opera Ballet DVD (Nureyev's last choreography) with Guerin, Platel, and Hilaire is in my opinion by far the best.  By comparison, even the costumes in this performance seem dowdy.",1215216000,13,644,4.631578947368421
