8302093,4,B001FJLLRQ,"This show was sponsored by Motorola for ABC in 1950 when less than 20% of American households had TVs. As an early TV show it was more of a play than a movie, all taking place in one suburban home in the days following an H-Bomb attack. The 1st actual H-Bomb wasn't tested until 1952, and Russia didn't test one until 1953, so this qualifies the show as Science Fiction. The play was based on the SciFi novel ""Shadow on the Hearth"" by Judith Merril published in 1950. While simplistic in its treatment, it does provide a glimpse into public thinking about nuclear war and television production values of the time. Look for Walter Matthau who may be making his acting debut as the doctor.",1272758400,,687,4.504
