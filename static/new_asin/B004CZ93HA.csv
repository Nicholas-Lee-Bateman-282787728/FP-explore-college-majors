8628510,5,B004CZ93HA,"""Carmo, Hit The Road"" simply put, is delicious. Watching the film, you will find yourself seeing, tasting and hearing the experience so acutely, that you will need to watch it again to capture what you may have missed the first time. Mariana Loureiro's portrayal of Carmo, is magnificent as she navigates the edges of her character while giving the audience the privilege of watching her innate gifts as an actress- one who can emote great emotions from within you often without even speaking.

My only regret is the lack of the director's cut- I wanted to hear the back-story of how the scenes were composed and how the director was able to take the audience to those back roads with such sensuality and artistic humor.  From the music to the outstanding visual imagery, it is not surprising the critical acclaim that Sundance followers raved about- a must see.",1300406400,,862,4.8175675675675675
