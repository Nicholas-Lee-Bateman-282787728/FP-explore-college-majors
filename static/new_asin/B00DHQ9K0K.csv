8593351,1,B00DHQ9K0K,"Way too short, in this case a blessing! Action & blood,forget it! The lowest of low budget!
I spit on your grave, no way! Could this be the same  Camille Keaton?
5 - 10mins into movie 4 Teenagers? frolic with Keaton, sorry should have said raped! < pathetic! >
They are never seen again!
Friend gets raped & killed! < pathetic! > Keaton again gets raped! < once again pathetic! >
Arms herself with chainsaw, 1st victim trips & waits for retribution! he is sliced & diced, < only his face shown! >
She now arms herself with a sawn off shot gun, seeks out 2nd victim he runs away from her, she shouts out  Stop!
he does just that!  She shoots him in the crutch!  cameras on his face, No Blood or Crutch area shown!
His last words, - - -  You Cant Leave Me Like This!
All together now - - -  Oh Yes We Can!  < my words >
  FINI.
Fast forward to Extras!
  INTERVIEW.
Lot of the interview trying to justify  lack of action, special effects,low budget movie straight to video.
Save your money!
Out & Out  C**P!

It's simple, but it's got enough cinematically off things to be entertaining, for the most part.  Crazy soundtrack.  Ridiculous fashion.  And odd moments.  Great list of extra features.  If you're curious, you should check it out.  If you're new to the SOV genre, your entertainment level may vary, like every SOV movie.",1399507200,,402,4.91044776119403
