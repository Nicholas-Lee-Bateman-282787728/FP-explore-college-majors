2533647,5,B000ETRA3W,I have watched this DVD over and over.  If you love Sutherland and Pavarotti I think you will treasure this concert.  It moved me to tears watching and remembering all the wonderful work these two did together over the years.  You can tell they had genuine affection for each other and their voices fit together like hand in glove.  Turn back the hands of the clock to a time we will all remember with such fondness and relive the magic of those glorious voices together once again!,1194480000,11,482,4.505747126436781
2533648,2,B000ETRA3W,"This DVD has given me the opportunity to listen,see and enjoy, many times, these two great performers at their best. All the songs are the strongest of their repertoire and the presentation is great. I recommend this to all opera lovers.",1174176000,7,237,4.804878048780488
2533649,5,B000ETRA3W,"Even though Joan Sutherland is my favourit soprano I wasn't sure what to expect on this DVD. No reason to worry. Joan was in excellent vocal shape at the time of the recording and she is simply breathtaking. Her superb vocal technique, her artistry and simple joy while singing can arguably be matched by others, but not surpassed. Her Hamlet and I Puritani is sung with such understanding, mastery and ease, that no one can be untouched.",1152835200,15,438,4.701298701298701
2533650,5,B000ETRA3W,"Sutherland's HAMLET mad scene is worth the price of the DVD alone -- astounding, especially when one realizes she was 57 at the time. She sings rings around any coloratura since.",1147824000,16,178,4.774193548387097
2533651,5,B000ETRA3W,This dvd was absolutely magnificent!!  I would highly reccomend it to anyone. Well worth the money.  They are both in top voice and give their all to it.,1146096000,15,153,4.428571428571429

Without a doubt, Sutherland & Pavarotti have performed outstandingly
and one could not ask for anything more of them. The beauty of their
voices and the beauty of the lovely songs they sing take my breath

8114128,5,B000ETRA3W,"I gave this DVD to my aunt for Christmas because she wanted to see Pavarotti in the opera La Traviata.  (She has several of Pavarotti's operas but not that one.)  However, this was the only DVD in which I found excerpts from La Traviata.  She was thrilled with the quality and content of this concert w/Sutherland & didn't mind not having the whole opera.",1200700800,3,355,4.515625
