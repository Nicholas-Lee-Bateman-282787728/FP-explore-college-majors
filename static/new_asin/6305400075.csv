7888855,1,6305400075,"As A Mary J Blige fan, I bought this expecting to get some of her music videos, as they are not readily available and hard to find. So I bought this, very disapointed. Besides that there are only clips of her videos, they also advertise a lot of videos on the box which are not included, plus during the videos there is that annoying MAKE IT OR BREAK IT text covering the video, which is annoying. Dont waste your money, luckily i got mine back.",984009600,3,445,4.247058823529412
