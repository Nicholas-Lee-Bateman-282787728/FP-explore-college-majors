You will grow old watching and waiting for these films to arrive...I would not recomend buying these films unless you are looking for something to put you to sleep.",1304380800,2,300,4.788461538461538
8388667,5,B003549806,"This SCI FI collection, is far the best action in on pack of 4. Once you watch you will see robots that think, life on a pod with a serial killer and more.

I won't tell you the rest but if theirs action and explosions than a must to watch.

Double sided, with great colour.",1278201600,2,274,3.963636363636364
