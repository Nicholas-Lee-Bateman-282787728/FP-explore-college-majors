3848002,5,B00250MRVI,"This video is a great choice to buy so that you can learn how to throw a knife. I highly recommend this video if you are looking to learn about throwing knives. Great video, instruction, instructor, and information.",1324857600,,215,4.684210526315789
3848003,2,B00250MRVI,"Ralph thorn breaks down his video in to 4 levels(lvl).
Lvl1 was the most important lvl, teaches you the throw.
Lvl2 side throw, but if you can do front throw the side throw is even easier.
Lvl3 where he trash talks other techniques, and how his is superior.
  Jumps around, throwing at incredibly close distances that took me one day to master.
Lvl4 more BS.

Over all.. I think learning this technique really messed with my other styles.
He's barrowing other style's technique in to his own, but there are some defacts that I don't like.
And at the very end of the video he misses a throw, probably thought no one would see it..
If you have no better reference then this is it.
But look a little further, there are much better instruction book, DVDs out there.
Sorry mr thorn, I didn't not think this was a good investment. Personally.",1311465600,7,836,4.4868421052631575
3848004,5,B00250MRVI,"The DVD offers all I was looking for, the best throwing techniques thus far.

The main technique covered is the no-spin throw that Thorn developed. Also covered is the shuriken (bo-shuriken) throw, a long range under-arm spinning throw, and variations on Thorn's throw.

The video is packed with useful information. There's no fluff added to pad out the running time.

The only improvement I could desire in the video is the throwing footage being recorded in true high speed, so the knives wouldn't be blurred in flight. It's certainly not required to learn the throws, it would just help. MythBusters' 1000+ frames-per-second cameras have spoiled me. I know how expensive they are, but you can rent them.

Highly recommended.",1297123200,8,727,5.084033613445378
3848005,5,B00250MRVI,"Ralph Thorn does a great job explaining the no-spin technique, as well as show different variations in throwing. It's amazing the stunts he can perform with no-spin.  I recommend this DVD to anyone-- however, it does only teach how to throw no-spin.  To learn how to throw using the spin technique, you'd have to find another DVD.",1283040000,13,330,4.771929824561403
3848006,5,B00250MRVI,"This is what a training DVD should be. Straight forward, detailed, with plenty of examples, and easy to navigate through and re-view. If you are interested in the no-spin combat type of knife throwing this is the holy grail. Within one day of watching this one I was throwing from several positions with much better accuracy, speed, and power. Both my partners improved significantly too. Thorn covers all the essential points including safety considerations, targets, knife choices, and practice ideas. Just from seeing his knife throwing ranges I have built one suited to me. I would give this DVD ten stars if it was possible.",1264982400,20,629,5.0
3848007,5,B00250MRVI,Good video for learning the no spin technique.,1405555200,,46,4.875
3848008,5,B00250MRVI,Combat Knife Throwing very interesting to watch someone that can throw knives like that. I wish I could throw like that. Watching the video doesn't just make it happen it takes skill and a lot of hard work and practice.,1401062400,,219,4.5
3848009,5,B00250MRVI,"Good, clear instruction and explanation of techniques presented. I wouldn't exactly call the limited CG graphics top-notch, but overall the DVD is presented well. The slow motion segments are very clear enough to see how the blade travels through the air, and the author talks well. No magic or highly skilled finesse necessary behind this art. Just keep practicing.",1400803200,2,366,5.220338983050848
3848010,5,B00250MRVI,I needed this video to learn the details of how to throw. I will recommend this to other knife throwers,1374364800,,103,4.2
3848011,1,B00250MRVI,its a book not a video.not what i wanted. might be ok but i got it for a teen on vacation and he is not likely to read but he might watch a video. i paid 63.89 for the dvd and you sent me the 12 dollar  book,1373760000,3,207,3.3125
3848012,5,B00250MRVI,This video is very well done and Ralph Thorn is a good teacher. After 26 years of Martial Arts training this method is a good addition to my training. A good Martial Arts student is always learning new things and growing. I recommend this video to anyone who wants to learn a practical method of knife throwing.hanks Ralph !!!

3848013,5,B00250MRVI,"The dvd came prior to the anticipated delivery date and I was able to track it through the USPS tracking system.  Ralph Thorn opened my eyes to many options and I have had a blast doing this stuff even as a near 50 year old man.  I had heard of Bobby Branton but did not know that his knives were being used until Thorn mentioned it.  I love the Shur-knife design and come up with my own design using the PHI ratio as described by Thorn that I knew of from architectural studies and mathematical correllation of my professional back ground in construction.  The no spin method of throwing is tough to grasp initially but through repetition is hard to believe that it wasn't realized before through natural instinct.  In my opinion, Ralph Thorn is an awesome thrower and educator with a proven philosophy and method that delivers beyond expectations.  His innovation is what makes difficult things fun.",1368403200,2,901,4.670886075949367
3848014,5,B00250MRVI,I hate to think about how poorly I would have done without the side views of throws from this video.  It is very useful as a visual aid.,1366156800,,136,3.857142857142857
3848015,4,B00250MRVI,"not bad dvd, but actually, no one can teach you no spin, to learn this style, you have to experiment and find out what works for you.",1357344000,,133,3.962962962962963

8350921,3,B00250MRVI,"Pretty good except the video menues does not seem to respond.  More discussion of techniques would be appreciated (release point, arm positions, body positions and movement, adjustments for distance. etc). (I have been working a lot on this and my ""point first percentage ranges from ""no better than a monkey throwing a knife"" to 95% but only averaging about 67%...lot of study on body dynamics).",1461715200,,396,5.092307692307692

8350926,5,B00250MRVI,"Same as the book this is an excellent DVD. I have practiced martial arts non-stop all my life since 18, now 66, and never have I seen such well explained and at the same time interesting illustrations of techniques in any form of martial art.
The Thorn Style knife throwing is such a practical, no nonsense style that is very easy to learn. Knife throwing was completely new to me and I started following this DVD( and the book Combat Knie Throwing by the same author) from Jan 2, 2015 which is 10 days ago, and already sticking knives onto board 90 percent from 9 feet with my weak left hand.
