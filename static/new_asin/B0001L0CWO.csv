8014007,3,B0001L0CWO,"As several reviewers have remarked, the chief attraction of Sidney Lumet's film lies in its evocation of New York in the mid-Fifties. From its opening tracking shots of Broadway, showing the popular shows of the time (including SEPARATE TABLES), to the regular establishing shots of the cars and taxicabs moving endlessly up and down, the film makes us aware of the fact that the action will take place in a confined location, wherein everyone knows everyone else.

In this kind of environment, egos are both fragile yet inflated. Joan Greenwood's Rita Vernon offers a prime example - someone who believes in her abilities as an ""ACTOR,"" yet perpetually haunted by the belief that she could somehow lose her stardom. Hence her relentless pursuit of producer Lewis Easton (Henry Fonda). The sequence where they negotiate her future contract, while locked in a passionate embrace, is masterly, revealing how personal and professional issues are inseparable.

As the would-be star ""Eva Lovelace"" (the falseness of the name reveals how artificial Broadway life actually is), Susan Strasberg represents a breath of fresh air. While certainly not possessed of the acting-skills of her illustrious costars, she possesses a sincerity of purpose that proves extremely attractive. Her rendition of the balcony-scene from ROMEO AND JULIET at Easton's first night party is strangely haunting. Director Sidney Lumet understands this, which helps to explain why he shoots the sequence in a series of close-ups, focusing our attention on Strasberg's open countenance as she looks straight into Easton's face.

The story is a familiar one, as Lovelace takes over from Vernon in the lead role of a new play written by Joe Sheridan (Christopher Plummer) and shoots to stardom after the first night. Lumet wisely chooses not to focus on the performance itself, but rather on the backstage reactions: Strasberg's wide-eyed expression of disbelief at her achievement is contrasted with the superficial reactions of miscellaneous theatrical hangers-on, who come to congratulate her with the usual platitudes (""Dahling, you were marvelous, always though you'd make it""). The film's ending is perhaps too drawn-out, consisting of an extended dialog between Lovelace and Easton, but what emerges most tangibly is the fact that Lovelace has no real need to go and celebrate at Sardi's (as directed by theatrical custom). She is happy just to stand on the stage, looking out at the auditorium and reflect on what happened during the last two hours or so. Although very much implicated in the world of Broadway falseness, Easton comes to understand her state of mind and blows her a kiss (""just from me""). Sometimes sincerity can triumph over artifice.

STAGE STRUCK is full of intertexts: Eva's name is a direct sonic reference to Joseph L. Mankiewicz's ALL ABOUT EVE (1950), another classic expos of Broadway hypocrisies. At one point elderly actor Robert Hedges (Herbert Marshall) advises Lovelace to complete her education at the Actors' Studio, which just happened to be run by Strasberg's real-life father Lee Strasberg.

The basic plot of STAGE STRUCK might be familiar - as other reviewers have remarked, it is a remake of MORNING GLORY (1933) - but there are plenty of ingredients within the ninety-minute running-time to interest all types of viewer.",1413072000,,3332,5.2439024390243905
8014008,1,B0001L0CWO,"A so-so movie from RKO, but this Interglobal release is on an ultra cheap ""60 minute"" video cassette, taped at a lower quality speed to fit the media.  The picture resolution is fuzzy, with noticeable color bleed, and the sound is somewhat muted.

Don't spend more than a coupla bucks for it!",1378339200,,292,4.596153846153846

8014010,3,B0001L0CWO,"Warner's remake of Katharine Hepburn's 1933 Best Actress Oscar-winning MORNING GLORY, which made a star of Kate but failed to do the same for Susan Strasberg, daughter of the legendary acting teacher.  She gives a very mannered performance that works for the drunk scenes but gets monotonous later.  Daddy's lessons didn't quite rub off on Susan, who went on to have a rather odd career in B-movies.  Nevertheless, the film is also notable for Christopher Plummer's film debut; he's fine, as is Henry Fonda as an older producer who also falls for her.  And it offers a very interesting view, in color, of the late '50s Broadway community, with lots of names dropped.  But beware, this is an LP speed VHS Canadian import, which is apparently the only way to get this rare title.  Time for a DVD release!",1234310400,5,802,4.733812949640288
