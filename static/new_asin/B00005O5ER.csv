I believe this is the documentary which led to the creation of the Bones TV series.  It is an extensive interview with Dr. Kathy Reichs on whom the series is based.  Explores fascinating stories from the world of forensic anthropology including;  a visit to a ""body farm"", a visit to a Hawaii site where there is an ongoing study of insects and dead pigs, a respectful discussion of the identification of fallen military personnel from around the world, the excavation of a mass grave and identification of the remains, and a body found and identified more than 20 years after death.  Among others.

This documentary is for anyone who loves the Bones series, Dr. Kathy Reichs and/or forensic anthropology.",1483920000,,816,4.785714285714286
7948390,5,B00005O5ER,"As the National Director of Risk Management for Phi Sigma Phi National Fraternity, I found ""Hazing: A Deadly Game"" to be an authentic viewpoint of the ""Negative"" rites of passage most young people will face when joining an ""uneducated fraternity.""  Though many of the cases presented are what most would deem the ""special cases of tradition taken too far,""  the truth of hazing, combined with alcohol and a person's drive to fit in, can only end in tragedy.  We must find new traditions.  The ""rite of passage"" should not be a means to tear down;  but to build up.  It should not be to hurt;  but to help.  The rites of passage must bring about a change in character, to promote education, promote strength in free thinking, and at least in some way...provide the world with brighter, responsible, giving  citizens.",1055548800,,815,4.764285714285714
