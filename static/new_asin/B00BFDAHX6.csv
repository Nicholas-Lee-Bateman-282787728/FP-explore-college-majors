5614857,5,B00BFDAHX6,"The is a review of the Blu-ray version of the King of Thorn. The colors and animation were excellent.  It is rated MA, primarily because there are a bunch of monsters running around biting people's heads off, with blood splattered everywhere. The disk comes with a number of extras, mainly trailers of various sorts, although it does have something from the Director also. I listened to the Japanese and read the subtitles, so I don't know how the dubbing was. I also have not read the manga, as apparently many have.

The story has lots of plot-line detail, which I really like.  The closest thing I can compare it to is a combination of Chaos Head and the 1956 Forbidden Planet. If you had trouble understanding Chaos Head, you will also have trouble with this. As you can tell from product description, the Medusa Virus is turning the people to stone, and one group says it will put some people in cold sleep so they can be saved in the future. You just know something is going to happen when they say that a computer program will take care of the people when they sleep. The heroine wakes up to find thorns everywhere. At this point the plot line effectively changes to a search for the cause of all the thorns. One of the reviewers said the story was rushed, but the movie itself is nearly two hours long, so I think they did a credible job.

One of characters raises a good theological point, which I would like to discuss, but to do so completely fill this review with spoilers :(

The one bad thing about this is that after spending all the time looking for the cause of the thorns, they completely overlook the fact that the virus is still out there turning everyone to stone.",1349136000,4,1685,4.457792207792208
5614858,4,B00BFDAHX6,I didn't know what to expect when watching this but was pleasantly surprised. Nice quality and plot that keeps you guessing til the end that doesn't disappoint. This one delivers and i'll be able to watch it several times over.,1348617600,3,227,4.7
5614859,2,B00BFDAHX6,"I knew from the get go that this adaptation of ""King of Thorn"" would be entirely different than the manga. But I had no idea what I was in for.
The animation is wonderful! They use a very nice mixture of computer animation and good ol' hand drawn animation. the movements are very nice :)
Even the way they started the movie out was alright. It was good to explain what Medusa was.
That being said... so much was just wrong. I know I shouldn't give spoilers, but here it is:
1. Marco Owen wasn't a super sarcastic, offensive guy. He was very straight forward, and serious! And mysterious! That's what made him great! They didn't get into his expertise with computers, or how he went to jail. They didn't even get into the whole thing with his arch nemesis, who was ultimately behind this whole thing to start with!
2. Katherine! They got into how she was an abusive mother before, but they didn't show her fear of Medusa or how the virus effected her as she turned to stone! which brings me to my next thing! THEIR PORTRAYAL OF MEDUSA WAS STUPID! They weren't supposed to just magically turn to stone. It was supposed to be painful. And slowly change your skin to clay like material that cracks and breaks when you move. :(
3. Peter wasn't so evil! He wanted to know about level 4, that was all! It was his work, and they just took it away from him! And he WAS infected with the virus!
4. The Italian senator wasn't supposed to die the way he did. He was supposed to be eaten alive as they traveled through underwater hallways infested with fish-type things that hunted based on movement! Otherwise, his personality fit the manga perfectly :P He was a jerk!
5. Ron wasn't supposed to die of the disease!
6. and HOW DARE THEY KILL OFF ALICE! She was a key character!
7. Shizuku was supposed to be manipulated by the antagonist, and she was supposed to be the large creature first shown in the elevator. :/
8. they didn't even bring in Zeus, the main antagonist in the story!!!!!!!!! >:(
9. and Vega wasn't supposed to be alive. He was supposed to blow his brains out!!!

Sorry for the rant...
They ruined the story by leaving the most important things out. I would have loved it if I hadn't read the manga first. Now, I can't accept it :/
Please people, read the manga. It is one of the best things I've ever read. The plot (in that version) is the best. The characters are wonderfully developed, the artwork fits the scenarios, the fear and anticipation builds up better, and it's no possible to put the story down!!!",1348185600,11,2517,4.412903225806452
5614860,2,B00BFDAHX6,"All of the characters origins and purposes were changed. As one who has owned all 6 volumes of the manga, this might as well have been a fan fiction, or an alternative universe. It's almost a shame that they share the same title. For those of you that have enjoyed the manga as I have, you'll notice more than one serious plot point has been erased or made so that it was never even going to happen. The rising action that happened in the manga was never even so much as spoken of, and while the ending was the only thing that was even remotely similar to the original, the dynamic changes will leave original fans a lot to be desired. I'd recommend the manga to anybody, not the movie.",1346630400,9,686,4.2846153846153845
5614861,4,B00BFDAHX6,"Now I can't say that I've read the manga (which I have not), but all things considered this was quite good.  While there is blood and grue, I can't say there is anything along the likes of UROTSUKDOJI or GENOCYBER (which are vomit inducing)... but don't think there isn't Nightmare Fuel in this (the scene with the elevator left a big impact on me).

You might feel it gets a bit convoluted near the end, but compared to pretentious stuff like DEATH NOTE (which has a great idea but has melodramatic execution) it's better than what you would expect.  Some really cool ideas, a nice pace and under 2 hours... what more can you want (other than more US anime)?

BTW, NINJA SCROLL was just released on blu in Japan and looks FANTASTIC!",1345852800,8,733,4.488721804511278
5614862,3,B00BFDAHX6,"The manga is great. The anime adaptation not so good. Main characters are changed---and not for the better. Probably still worth watching for the animation. However, if I had a choice between watching this again or reading the manga again, I would choose the manga. Sorry I can not give it a better review. I really wanted to like it.",1343865600,16,334,4.583333333333333
5614863,2,B00BFDAHX6,I hate to say it but the movie really disappointed me. It messed up a LOT of the original story from the manga books. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars is because the action and animation was really good,1469145600,,207,4.073170731707317

5614879,3,B00BFDAHX6,I expected better from this show after watching the trailer. Its a decent show if you like plenty of action and suspense but theres not much gore after the initial attack. Other then that the animation and musical score was decent. It just lacks the added steps to make the show great.,1427673600,,285,4.5
5614880,3,B00BFDAHX6,"Too much repetition of scenes, a cool plot though, but needed to be edited better and less flashbacks to the same scene, it was like they were struggling to lengthen it.",1426204800,,169,4.483870967741935
5614881,4,B00BFDAHX6,"It was a decent anime.  The animation itself was fair if not amazing.  the story keeps you interested although the characters are a bit clich.  It has some twists that annoying clever people who won't shut up and have to tell you what's going to happen next will figure out.

Its a fair edition into my collection.  Nothing memorable to cosplay though.",1425254400,,352,4.612903225806452
5614882,4,B00BFDAHX6,It nice!,1421452800,,8,3.5
5614883,3,B00BFDAHX6,"This is a peculiar film. Not in that it has odd concepts to deliver or is filled with multiple mind-blowing twists (though there is one that is possible to understand on your first viewing), but that it doesn't seem like a lot happens in 2 hours. For a horror film, it seems very unoriginal in that there are only two ways in which lead characters die (there are seven lead characters), and most of the film is spent running around to escape terribly-rendered CGI monsters. The animation can range from beautiful and breathtaking to banal and laughable (the latter applies to the absolutely horrendous computer generated animation). The plot itself is simple: survive. It thickens in the last fifth, and all that happens before are merely discoveries. The characters aren't your typical stereotypes (save one), but that doesn't make them interesting. I really don't care if these people get eaten along the way or not because, quite frankly, they are a bore. Some of the science mumbo-jumbo is hard to grasp in reality, and there are plenty of questions left over when the movie is finished that you don't care to ask because you honestly couldn't care less. So, then, you might be wondering what exactly is so great about this film? One word: atmosphere. This anime is a suspense-thriller because of the picture it paints with the scenery, situation, and music. The main song is haunting and melodious, and fits in perfectly with the scenario and the setting. The facility itself is spooky, as if some foreboding presence is hovering over the entire building. The fact that the characters seem to be completely abandoned with the facility adds to the atmosphere, and draws you in with the mystery of what happened to the rest of the world. Not all questions are answered, but not all of them need to be; it adds to the worrisome feelings all the more. It's not a masterpiece, but I fully enjoyed what I saw. The biggest disappointment, I think, is just how much better King of Thorn could have been if it stuck more along the storyline of the manga. That would have been magnificent to see, but, for something less, it still plays out satisfactorily. I recommend King of Thorn for the edge-of-the seat atmosphere that keeps you hooked throughout; take my word as you see fit.",1421280000,9,2276,4.764556962025316

5614890,5,B00BFDAHX6,"I really liked this movie. The suprises were refreshing because they caught me off guard instead of them being cliche and predictable. This movie is based off of a manga and after watching it I read the manga to see if they were different. The manga is much better in comparison but that was not a suprise because of the differences in length. I thought the movie did a good job of using the story in the manga and editing it to suit its needs. This is not to say that they didn't edit quite a bit because they did but, I liked both forms of this story. I would reccommend watching the movie and then reading the manga so you are not dissappointed with the changes that were made to the movie's story because you will probably love the manga as well.",1402099200,2,750,4.251748251748252

5614915,3,B00BFDAHX6,"This movie is a lot like Resident Evil. Kasumi is put into a cold sleep while the world searches for a cure for the Medusa Virus. The Medusa Virus turns people into monsters. Venus Gate attempted to find a cure and put 150 people into a cold sleep. Kasumi and the other subjects are awakened to a world consumed by monsters and plants. After many people die, the survivors learn that they have only been asleep for 2 days. How could this have happened in that short amount of time.

The virus has come form outer space and it gave a girl named Alice the ability to turn her dreams into reality. That is what the Medusa virus is. Venus Gate attempted to harness this power for themselves and create a new reality. But during their experiments everything went out of control. How will Kasumi and the survivors deal with the new world? Can they make things right? Or will they all die in pain, scared, and alone?

This movie isn't too bad. I actually enjoyed watching it. There were some twists, action, and a little drama. I did expect more though. If you've seen any of the Resident Evil movies, you know exactly what to expect. Usually anime films are pretty original. I think that's the reason I was disappointed. It's nowhere near a 5 star movie, but it isn't bad. Even though I enjoyed it, I'm gonna give it 3 stars b/c the idea had been beaten to death over the past 20 years. It's a good watch, but I don't think it's a movie that you'll watch more than once or twice. I recommend renting it and making your own judgement call.",1356998400,4,1532,4.371929824561404

VIDEO:

""King of Thorn"" is presented in 1080p High Definition and is HD Native.  And as one can expect from an animated film, especially from Sunrise, the amount of detail on the art backgrounds are fantastic.  Colors are vibrant, character animation is features detail and shadowing but the most amazing aspect is how CG was incorporated in this animated film.

AUDIO & SUBTITLES:

""King of Thorn"" is presented in English and Japanese Dolby TrueHD 5.1.  Because the animated film features a lot of action sequences, there are a lot of gunfire, a lot of rampaging eels and vines attacking their prey.

EXTRAS:

JUDGMENT CALL:

""King of Thorn"" is one of the most complex manga series out there.  Fascinating, bleak and in some ways, the story reminds you a bit of films such as ""Aliens"", ""2001: A Space Odyssey"",  ""Matrix"" films, ""Sunshine"" and ""Flatliners"" (and other sci-fi related films), there is so much story featured in the original manga series that for its film adaptation, Yuji Iwahara had to simplify it for those who would watch the film but never read the manga.

And surprisingly, director Kazuhoshi Katayama and Hiroshi Yamaguchi were both able to accomplish it through their film adaptation by not following the manga 100%, but using the characters featured in the manga series. Having read a few volumes of the manga series, while not faithful to the original storyline, on its own, it does make for a fascinating yet complex anime film.

For one thing, when it comes to differences, for those who read the manga series may be disappointed to find out that Zeus, the antagonist is not even in the film.  And also situations have changed for certain characters, as well as having a completely different ending for the animated film.

While some may cry foul by the change of the film vs. the manga series, in Japan, for those who have watched animated films based on an anime or manga series have grown accustomed in seeing animated films that are different from its original source.  Fortunately, if one is entertained by the film,  possibly then after, they can pursue reading the much better, original manga series.

With that being said, ""King of Thorn"" is a film that combines horror and fantasy.  At first glance, the animated film plays out like survival horror/disaster film, with survivors who have awaken from their hibernation capsule find out that the entire lab have been filled with monsters and large plants with thorns.  And you try to figure out which one of them will survive by the end of the film.

For the most part, the film is exciting with a lot of tension and plenty of action scenes that look and sound great on Blu-ray!  But because of the corruption that has taken place in the lab, there is this whole entirely different element  that is introduced to the whole ""survive the entire ordeal"" storyline, situations that make you start to doubt the characters in the film. Are these people genuine?  Are these people crazy?  Needless to say, I found myself having to watch the film twice and had to rewind many times, because I felt I was missing something.

The film can get complex and confusing and unfortunately, even discussing the complexities of what I was confused about, would be spoiling the film.  But let's just say that once you get to the big reveal at the end of the film, you kind of feel cheated.  In a way, ""King of Thorn"" is a perfect example of a complex manga series that would have benefited from an 13 or 26-episode anime series rather than a 110 minute film.

As for the Blu-ray release, Sunrise did a magnificent job in providing us a film that looks incredible and features beautiful artwork, the lossless soundtrack for both English and Japanese soundtracks were well-done and was pleased to hear the soundtrack of ""King of Thorn"" being immersive.  And it was great to have a few special features including the talk event at Cinema Sunshine Ikebukuro and giving us the opportunity to understand what Kazuhoshi Katayama was trying to accomplish for this film.

Overall, ""King of Thorn"" is a film that will entertain those who enjoy action, horror and fantasy.  But also can appreciate a complex film that is not too banal or simplified. With that being said, it's one of those films that probably requires multiple viewings.

Featuring beautiful artwork and animation from Sunrise, ""King of Thorn"" may be different from the manga series it was loosely-based on, but still manages to be an enjoyable film worth watching!",1354320000,4,6454,5.035849056603774
5614920,4,B00BFDAHX6,"I gotta say, this was a well done movie. I love apocalyptic movies and this one hit the spot because it was so well animated. You get to know the characters on a decent level and it had some plot twists you wouldn't expect. I liked it, nuff said.",1352073600,2,246,4.040816326530612
5614921,5,B00BFDAHX6,"The movie was very simple, deadly virus infects the world, nobody knows how to stop it, so science takes over and BAM crazy survival horror movie time. I really enjoyed the movie and the animation it was very well done. As far as the characters go, they were all pretty basic, and if you don't watch the entire movie you will probably be wondering what the heck is going on.

Overall the movie brought something new to the table especially with the origins of the virus, and the twist at the end of the movie.....I really enjoyed King Of Thorn",1351209600,3,543,4.43
5614922,5,B00BFDAHX6,"This was a very great full length movie based on the King of thorn movie.
People who read the manga are too over dramatic and need to watch the extras to see that even the Author approved the changes.  It also explains why they were made.

I do agree if they were given more time or two parts it should of been more based on the story. But this is a great story based off of king of thorn and thats how we should view it ""based"" off of.

Looking upon the movie only,
The art in the movie is amazing. They combined 2D and 3D into one to make amazing visuals.
The sound is top notch, and is in HD Format.
Extras include Trailers, the cinema interview with the directors, another one on one interview and intro/exit songs.

I'd say pick this up and support more full length anime.",1349395200,2,777,4.16

8567675,3,B00BFDAHX6,"This film contains beautiful imagery and a lot of action. Definetly not for the young crowd. It feels kind of like a post apocalyptic take on Sleeping Beauty. It is hard to follow, I personally would advise watching it for its beauty and not try to follow the story particularly near the end where they suddenly decided to try to jam a complex idea into less than ten minutes and then bring the movie to a quick close. Worth the watch, but it would have benefited from more time and slower pacing towards the end.",1514160000,,513,4.410526315789474

8567677,4,B00BFDAHX6,"It wasn't disappointing, rather quite unexpectedly refreshingly delightful, however you will need to have a region two (2) player in order to view this Dvd, and just when you've figured it out, a whole new twist. Wonderful
Well worth the purchase price.",1500508800,,253,5.0476190476190474

8567679,5,B00BFDAHX6,"In the near future, Earth is being ravaged by a new kind of virus  - the Medousa Virus, so named because after a period of incubation it turns its victims to stone.  As doctors race to find a cure and learn how it originated, an international conglomerate develops a means of cryogenically freezing infected victims, with the hope of waking them up when a cure is ready.  Infectees around the world buy their way into a lottery of sorts, and those whose names are drawn head to the corporation's compound to be put to sleep.  Then, one day, they awake.

It's immediately apparant that something has gone terribly wrong: they appear to have been frozen for a much longer time than intended, as the compound, devoid of human life except for the newly awakened, is overgrown with huge, thorny vines, and bizarre monsters soon appear to wreak havoc.  A small group of survivors bands together and makes their way through the mazelike compound, looking for survival and answers.

Rather than have a single major twist at the end, King Of Thorns is chock full of them every few minutes.  It definately takes a viewer's full attention to figure out what's really going on, and even so the movie calls for multiple viewings (not a bad thing in my opinion).  I'd really rather not hint at any of the pivotal reveals, so I'll pull my review up short.  But if you like well-animated, imaginative anime full of good characters, ambiguous mystery, bloody horror and truly surprising revelations, get King Of Thorn.",1484697600,,1501,4.7384615384615385
