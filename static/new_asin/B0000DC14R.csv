1923830,5,B0000DC14R,"I was skeptical early on when it became apparent that syringes and sperm would be recurring themes, but this turned out to be an interesting and unique movie with the predominant theme of artificial life redeeming and giving context to some of the others.  It is certainly well written and produced, thought provoking scifi, and manages to be non-violent without getting boring (to me at least).

If you feel like something interesting but laid back this may be a good choice.",1350777600,,476,4.864197530864198
1923831,3,B0000DC14R,"maybe its shallow, but i like to find my leading ladies attractive- she,  in her obviously wigged 'scientist', ruby and olive personas, looks like a pale emaciated alien guy in drag, so much so I looked for an adam's apple. was it the pale green eyes? no eye shadow? thin eyebrows? what? only 'marinne' (red hair pulled back) seems normal and attractive looking.

i loved the color schemes

the 'semen' tea grossed me out, and boiling condoms in a plastic ziploc bag bothers me on two levels- 1)chemicals in the plastic leeching into the water, and 2) cooking denatures protein, so whatever is in semen they need would be changed by heat. the injection, not so much, except they don't rotate their injection sites! (i am such a geek)the webbing between thumb and index finger might be dramatic, but is i'd think your start developing some scar tissue after awhile.

i like the little car

lets not go into why she(ruby) doesn't know what money is with all the films she watches, or why anyone would know what they heck she's talking about when she asks for ""succulent protein"", or computer code infecting humans (resulting in impotenence and a barcode on the forehead)...or why the clinic doc whispers...or how all 4 live in the same house yet she communicates with them through a computer screen. wierd movie.

yuki-onna-esque.

1923832,2,B0000DC14R,"This film's really strange. Tilda Swinton plays four characters;  Rosetta/Ruby/Marinne/Olive. One is the creator, the others are clones.

A definciency in the clones means that one must regularly go out and have sex with men in order to harvest their semen, which she collects in a condom. Then she takes this back and makes a tea out of it which they all drink from, as well as they inject themselves with another by-product.

It's too weird",1181433600,7,442,4.7894736842105265
1923833,4,B0000DC14R,"This has everything I like about Tilda Swinton's best movies, plus some of what I dislike about her lesser works. Dislikes include low-budget effects and cryptic finales, but maybe that's part of the charm of these movies.

The good, of course, comes from Swinton. She plays a geek girl (Rosetta Stone), but plays the role with respect. She's shy, especially shy around men, and fiercely intelligent. Swinton also plays Stone's three clones: Ruby, Olive, and Marinne. It's a bit ham-handed, but the four roles are distinguished by very different wigs, and the clones by color coding: red, green, and ultramarine. Swinton's real achievement is in her physical presence[s] - the body language of each character is distinctly the character's own. Rosetta is especially good in her my-gawd-i'm-a-mother moments, painfully but realistically unsure, and over cautious as a result.

The plot device is a bit odd: almost vampiric in an AIDS-era kind of way, but with a computer-y angle and a gentle resolution in the end. Rosetta and Ruby each find romantic resolutions of their own. Olive and Marinne seem to find each other - and something more. ""As easy as baking brownies."" The end is enigmatic, but good enough, and leaves a few questions open.

It's a good indy movie. That means it's not for everyone, but I came away happy.

1923834,5,B0000DC14R,"There was Teknolust and if the roll continues someday there will be a big budget sort of ""fight club"" for the ladies - till then - and oh yeah - it is porn but of a most thinking sort - the disclaimers of other viewers notwithstanding.  It is a 5/5 when you understand it was done on a nickel - very little edit or post production - but genius - raw - you bettcha.",1095724800,5,364,3.918918918918919
1923835,2,B0000DC14R,"I honestly didn't think anyone would be able to sincerely enjoy this movie.  Guess I was wrong.  I found everything about this movie to be lacking.  The plot is pretty dumb. The dialogue is way too over-the-top.  Watch, for example, the balcony scene when two of the characters try to explain that the reason no one is happy is because they don't get the chance to find their true ""essence.""  Whatever.  The writer obviously fell into that dangerous trap of thinking that every line has to be dazzlingly profound.  Sometimes simple, everyday dialogue can say as much as existential musings.  While the acting wasn't altogether bad, it did feel very uninspired.  All three of the clones and their creator were played the same way. I realize perhaps that's cause they're clones, but jeez, mix it up a little.  The only way to tell them apart is by physical appearance.  And I completely agree with the reviewer who didn't find Tilda attractive. Depending on which clone she played, she either looked freakish, disturbed, or even a little manly (Ruby looked more like a drag queen than a woman). Only the green clone looked halfway attractive, and I'm pretty sure that's because her hair covered most of her face. Speaking of color schemes, the imagery in this movie is too much Cat-in-the-Hat for my liking. All in all I could find little or no redeeming value in this movie. And I did watch it at 1 in the morning. Apparently that's the only time Starz will show it.",1093996800,7,1465,4.68359375
1923836,1,B0000DC14R,"Okay... I read the back of this DVD before I rented it, and thought to myself... ""you've got to be kidding me... cloned women who need to eat sperm to live.""  I figured this was a thinly veiled porno that had enough plot to make it to a rental shelf.  Boy was I wrong... so wrong.  It has a plot alright... a droll and ponderously slooooooow plot.  A scientist makes copies of herself, but removes their reproductive ability, which makes them dependent on protein from sperm.  (If you had visions of hot women givin' endless BJs to a horde of guys, look somewhere else) Long story short... the three ""clones"" and the scientist are all played by the same chick, who is not hot, does not get naked and poorly interacts with her other ""blue-screened"" selves.  If you are going to have a sexually based movie, (...) It may be ""low brow"" to say something like this, but the title is called ""TEKNOLUST"".  There was absolutely ZERO lust in this movie, as the clones equated sex with eating vitamins... and had no passion whatsoever when getting their ""protein"".  The clones were color-coded like power rangers which made this movie even more retarded.  I hate being duped by souped up dvd/vhs movie box cover art.  This movie has the distinction in being in a small class of movies I actually had to fast-forward through because I was so bored/disappointed. In fact, if you watch this after having read my review, you need to send me a dollar for being that stupid.",1083628800,33,1458,4.573076923076923
1923837,5,B0000DC14R,"i was hardly expecting this film to be beautiful; i thought it would be weird & that's about it.
it was weird- but it was so amazing.
tilda swinton is compelling and ultimately lovely as the four characters she embodies.  the story of a lonely scientist who clones herself into 3 different selves: half human/half computer-is so deliciously odd- and bordering on a creepy reality.
but, there was nothing creepy about this film, & with such a strong message of love & sweetness carried out through the ending... i dare anyone not to be delighted.
highly recommended!",1076457600,19,565,4.824742268041237
1923838,4,B0000DC14R,"I enjoyed this film thoroughly, but I'm afraid it will suffer unnecessary criticism from a lot of viewers disappointed to find no actual erotica in it anywhere. Instead, it takes a relaxed, funny view of virtual sex, which happens entirely off-camera. What endeared the film to me was the truly original female sensibility of it all. There are no ""bad guys"" in this story; every character is likeable. There are no long, boring adolescent male videogame cyberbattles. The tension is not caused by a conflict of wills or an effort by anyone to get the better of anyone else; instead, it centers on the struggles of the characters, both human and virtual, to understand and connect with each other. As I said -- it's a female sensibility. And as far as I know, that's never been done in this genre before. Kudos to Leeson; it's time women started envisioning the potentialities of virtual reality at last. (Oh yeah, and I couldn't take my EYES off Tilda Swinton. What a great face!)",1071964800,39,980,4.7368421052631575
1923839,2,B0000DC14R,"The movie revolves around a Professor who has created copies of herself in an illegal experiment. The problem is that her copies are deficient in X chromosome and therefore have to drink and inject themselves with male mojo!! Everything seems to be going fine till they start infecting the men they harvest.
Maybe its just me, but this movie failed to connect with me at any level. The acting is stupid and the story loses its footing 5 min into the movie...",1071532800,4,458,4.597560975609756
8000607,5,B0000DC14R,"Rosetta Stone (Tilda Swinton), bio-geneticist creates three artificial sweeties, Ruby/Marinne/Olivia (Tilda Swinton), each with her own color coordinated environment. She uses her own DNA and hopes to have created something better than people. They soon gain their own personalities. By sneaking into the outside world, they eventually teach Rosetta how to live in the real world.

This has the feel of an independent low budget film. There is no correlation to reality; so real techies would barf. But other than that this is an interesting story and lots of color and sound. The science is appalling and amusing. The lust part of ""Teknolust"" is so mild that you need to look closely. About the time you get used to it the 85 minutes are over.",1504483200,3,744,4.952
