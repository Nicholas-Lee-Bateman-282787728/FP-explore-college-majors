With this workout, you will feel like you worked out for one hour in a half hour.  It is challenging and fun.  It has been a long time since I sweat with a half hour workout video.  Awesome.  I highly recommend this workout video.  I am never disappointed with Tamilee Webb.",1235865600,12,444,4.214285714285714

8237430,4,B00109KN84,This high energy video will definitely give you a good workout!  Even my husband works out to it and loves it's high energy.,1400284800,,124,4.391304347826087
8237431,4,B00109KN84,"I really like this DVD because it's short, sweet and you can enhance it as you like. I never feel like it drags on forever as I do some others of the same length! Weird but true. I don't feel like I'm too winded as the routines progress but still feel worked out afterwards. She does not add-on and repeat which is one reason it keeps my interest. The moves are understandable, doable but not too boring.
I didn't think I would like Tamilee but I do!  Wish she had more similar routines out there.",1384646400,,497,4.231578947368421
8237432,1,B00109KN84,"DO NOT NOT NOT NOT NOT BUY THIS!!!!!!  This is not compatible with US players, which fact is fraudulently not disclosed in the product description. Unfortunately, due to a back injury I did not try this workout until my return window expired, so Amazon has hung this loyal customer out to dry!  SHAME!!!",1383955200,,303,4.69811320754717
8237433,2,B00109KN84,When I received the tape I checked it out and found it was not what I was looking.  I wanted the series of Tighter Assets that was shown on T V with Tamilee by Jake.  I sent back and got a store credit.,1379721600,,202,3.6744186046511627
8237434,5,B00109KN84,"I really like this dvd, easy to follow, excellent workout for 30 minutes! It will definitely get you toned & tight.",1366934400,,115,4.523809523809524
8237435,5,B00109KN84,"I am a former step instructor (15 years), pilates instructor and personal trainer. I got a workout and love, love love that you can ease into it. You work up a sweat without knowing it. Even my teenager loves this one for the workout.",1364083200,,234,4.340909090909091
8237436,5,B00109KN84,"I love her attitude and energy, so I was happy she made an aerobic 30 minute workout.  I'm dyslexic so I expect that workouts will be difficult for me when there's a lot of coordinating arm and leg movements, and I'm also just beginning to get back into exercising. I just didn't jump around as much as they do, but I'll get to it. It left me something to work on so I can match all the steps and eventually do everything and jump around with them.  The movements FEEL good.  Since I usually don't like calisthenics very much, this will very likely be my go-to video when I need something motivating.  And, I was surprised that it was done so fast.

Charlene Prickett's ""It Figures"" is great for a good sweat, but it's much harder and is 60 minutes - I'm not really ready for such heavy cardio yet.  This is a good in-between.",1313366400,,826,4.296774193548387
8237437,1,B00109KN84,"This dvd did not want to play the first time I tried to use it. I have another one of Tamilee's dvd's and the quality is terrible on it as well. Not sure what is going on there. Well Tamilee don't take into consideration that we are not all buff babes like she. She don't give beginners a chance. I started this dvd, had it in for about 2 minutes and took it out because I couldn't keep up. I do exercie regularly but this is not for me. Her dvd's too are to time comsuming to get started. Terrible waste of money.....",1298332800,,518,4.038834951456311
8237438,5,B00109KN84,"This training is simply amazing I'm so glad this DVD Tamilee Webb is lovely and this is the funniest of all his training, it makes me sweat too much because I always rise above all the moves on the race or other movements do not have a lot of space. ... Training is not a choreographer and that to me is very important since they are already the most uncoordinated legs and arms together to create difficulties for me. Highly recommended.",1296172800,,438,4.419753086419753
8237439,5,B00109KN84,"I have many workout videos but this is one of my fall-back favorites because it only takes 35 minutes, you don't need any equipment, and you feel great afterwards.  You use your muscles more than you normally do with aerobics.  Tamilee's energy is motivating and fun without being annoying.  The moves vary quite a bit throughout but they're easy to follow.  It's a good intermediate workout.",1293580800,4,392,4.893939393939394
