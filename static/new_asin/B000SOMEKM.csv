2888558,5,B000SOMEKM,"I loved DOS! I don't know how the makers picked their 3 aspiring writers, but they succeeded in getting an interesting cross section of differing approaches.  Two have day jobs, and one has left work to better concentrate her efforts.  One is already partnered with an aspiring director, another is working in a do-it-yourself capacity, and the other utilizes professional help from consultants.  All are well spoken and likable.  In showing how each struggle with their craft, their day-to-day difficulties (day job, family...) and their own doubts and foibles, and combined with pithy interviews with established pros, DOS offers keen insights and lessons for all creators, not just writers (I am a visual artist). Ultimately it is poignant. As we are reminded throughout, it is a business of rejection; few make it. Luck is good, but persistence is key! The dvd extras feature extended interviews with the pros, and more excellent advice and anecdotes.  DOS is imaginatively shot and well crafted, and it is inspiring and involving, whether you share these dreams yourself, or just enjoy the drama of real people who fight the odds to answer their calling.",1271289600,,1159,5.111111111111111
2888559,1,B000SOMEKM,"It's like they chose deadbeat wannabe types instead of actual writers on the verge of selling something.  It leaves one with a bitter aftertaste.  Imagine a documentary about actors that are trying to make it, and then watching people who will never make it desperately try to break into the business.

It is also a weird structure they use in this documentary.  They intersperse those aspiring writers with professional writers, with little clarification or introduction, as if the two groups were one and the same.  Only the professional ones made it, we are supposed to think.  Of course, they show an aspiring writer printing out her ideal cast list.  That made me think, ""What kind of writer is this?""

Some of it was interesting, but I found it depressing.  It also has poor production value and not much of a unifying theme.

One caveat: this film is interesting in a psychological sense, a case study of how persistence is not always great.  I think people need to have a lot of moxy and political smarts in the business, and this documentary showed three people that seemed a bit out of the reality of it all.

Thoughts of the girl who was ""producing her own scripts"" comes to mind.  She was already casting her ideal movie, printing cast lists, etc... And I am thinking: ""What are you doing?""  Write a good script!",1257897600,,1324,4.675324675324675
2888560,5,B000SOMEKM,"I loved this documentary. It's a real eye opener. I had a retired script analyst help me learn the basics of screenwriting and with my experience, I think the analysist in this movie is just milking the screenwriter for his money. Without actually reading their screenplays, these people seemed doomed to fail. Even though this is real and the people and events are real, I could easily imagine Christopher Guest and those people who made those movies like Waiting For Guffman, making this as a movie. Christopher Guest would be the guy who morgages his house to produce his screenplay into a movie. There was one scene where the one screenwriter was eating with his wife and daughter at a restaurant and all he could talk about was hold he was trying to get Teri Hatcher to read his script. The wife looked miserable. One guy in the film actually succeeds and gets his screenplay made into a movie called Behind The Mask but he pays a price.",1257033600,,942,4.613095238095238
2888561,5,B000SOMEKM,"""Dreams on Spec"" is a DVD every screenwriter should have in his or her film library.  Daniel Snyder brilliantly juxtaposes successful screenwriters' advice with the stories of new writers trying to break into Hollywood.  The ups and downs of the screenwriter's life are exposed here honestly and realistically.  But seeing those who have made it and are here to talk about it reminds us that the dream is possible.  The words of wisdom shared by the working screenwriters are priceless.  I would have watched two hours of Nora Ephron just by herself.  She is AMAZING!!!!!!  I love this DVD--it is the perfect gift for all the writers you know.",1234656000,,643,4.844036697247707
2888562,3,B000SOMEKM,"not a very edifying documentary of the screenwriting business.  First, the main subjects appear to have been chosen for their dramatic potential rather than writers who are slightly more rational about their commercial need to sell a script.  This is okay, as I suppose filming a documentary about the travails of three or four very ordinary, unexciting screenwriters would be boring - a little more informative, perhaps - but admittedly boring.  Second, these screenwriters were submitting specs to what appears to be independent film companies.  I know that indies have been eating up their share of the market, but it seems like doing business with large production companies would be more likely for most aspiring screenwriters - Granted, this too would probably result in a drastically short film, as I understand large producers have a very efficient rejection systems.  In any event, the film was good overall, but not quite the exploration of Hollywood screenwriting that I expected.  To be fair, though, the filmmakers did share the purely business nature of the film industry - it was sharply contrasted by each subject's burning desire for their ""vision"" to be made into film (honestly, the guy who kept protesting product positioning and character re-writes as violations of his ""vision"" for a slasher film?).  I would think that a more level screenwriter would approach at least their first few scripts as purely business propositions.  Then, if (and it is clearly a very big ""if"") one becomes famous and more marketable, a screenwriter can start writing about their ""art.""  ""Dreams on Spec"" is still good viewing, though - non-writers will probably find the documentary subjects entertaining.  Writers can capture a glimpse of the movie business.  I recommend it.",1232928000,,1777,5.2
2888563,1,B000SOMEKM,"As an aspiring screenwriter I looked forward to watching this documentary. I was quickly disappointed. It starts out recounting the dismal chances any screenwriter has of ever selling a script and then goes downhill from there. The doc follows three aspiring screenwriters on their quest to sell their scripts. Interspersed are ""interviews"" with professional screenwriters where they mostly whine about how terrible the job is. The video and sound quality are also pretty bad. This movie is a complete downer. Unless you want to quit writing screenplays, do not watch this one.",1206748800,,577,5.282608695652174
2888564,5,B000SOMEKM,"Dreams on Spec shows the many contradictory aspects of the writing life; discouragement vs. determination, art vs. business, ambition vs. obsession.
Although the focus of the documentary is on screenwriting, it poses the same questions that writers face everyday: How far are you willing to go to try and make your dream come true? Are you prepared to spend the next five months or five years working on a project, knowing there is no guarantee of success? Dreams on Spec is a sobering look at the price screenwriters are willing to pay in pursuit of a career writing for Hollywood, and it's a potent reminder of the work that goes into every successful movie.",1203206400,4,660,4.798245614035087
2888565,5,B000SOMEKM,"The journey of an artist is filled with many ups and downs.  Many people think the arts are just fun and require very little hard work or discipline.  At times, the journey does seem arbitrary with some people getting opportunities, which open many doors to success and others who work just as hard can't seem to find a building with a door at all.

DREAMS ON SPEC sheds light on the journey of several screenwriters' pursuing the dream and shows you relentlessly just how difficult it is to maintain the dream.  The documentary is filled with interviews and stories of many successful screenwriters', in addition to following a few up and coming dreamers.

Being a fan of movies in general, and pursuing a screenwriting career myself, I found this DVD inspiring and difficult to watch at times.  What compels us to continue writing when there is so much rejection?  We are a strange breed indeed and Dreams On Spec seems to validate us stories tellers ~ the new shamans'.  This DVD is a must buy for any dreamer.",1203206400,,1013,4.651685393258427
2888566,5,B000SOMEKM,Dreams on Spec is an uplifting and entertaining documentary! It is full of encouragement for all writers wherever they are on their writing journey.  At times the writing path can seem like a long arduous hike towards your destination. We prepare for the journey by getting advice from those at the pinnacle of their careers such as the writers of Seabiscuit and Liar Liar as well as the prolific Nora Ephron and Carrie Fisher.  They are like the beacons of light guiding you along the writing path.  We also encounter three aspiring scriptwriters who have set out on the adventure of their lives.  We learn as they learn about the screenwriting process.  Dreams on Spec is an inspiring reflection upon the writing profession.,1199664000,3,726,4.869918699186992

8206177,3,B000SOMEKM,"The only thing I got out of this is that there are those who put money, blood, sweat and tears into producing good quality screenplays.  However, judging from the low budget movie offerings these days, these hardworking writers are passed over for crappy screen plays.  Even the one who did have his screenplay made into a movie had his vision usurped.

This documentary was really quite disillusioning and depressing.",1423267200,,418,5.028985507246377
8206178,5,B000SOMEKM,"If you like watching documentaries to get a better sense of reality, this is the documentary for you.  Very real.  Probably too much so to be mainstream.  Whereas ""Tales from the Script"" spends time discussing how tough it is to be a screenwriter in Hollywood, the fact that just about everyone you are seeing is wildly successful makes it a pretty fun documentary.  ""Dreams on Spec"" isn't always so fun.  While it does include interviews from such writers as Paul Guay (""Liar Liar"", ""Little Rascals""), the majority of the film focuses on struggling writers who have very limited success.  People say it's a hard industry, and this is the documentary to watch if you are curious what they mean by that.",1377561600,,702,4.760330578512397
8206179,4,B000SOMEKM,"I'd seen this on television and bought here on Amazon to show to my screenwriting students. When I did, they thought it was very depressing, but all of them thought the writers in the documentary were idiots. ""That's not me,"" they said.  Yeah, right.  All new writers are idiots. They have high hopes and only a small chance of ever seeing something they've created come to life. But if you're a true writer, you never give up. The successful ones continue to learn, and to perfect their craft.

The value of this DVD is to show the career paths of three struggling and aspiring screenwriters who experience various levels of frustration, success and failure. Sort of a train wreck, we can't help but watch.  The nicest parts of this documentary are the bits of well-earned wisdom from successful writers in the trenches.",1373328000,,821,4.76056338028169

The writer gets to discuss with the director the vision of the film and visit the set, though is not able to watch any filming.

Another writer who actually had a film 'Crazy Jones' but it was not released, has a table reading where actors read through the screenplay.

There are interviews with accomplished writers one of which is Carrie Fisher. An interesting venture into the world of film.  It is said that 400 films a year are made. It mentions that there must be thousands of screenplays that are written but never made.  Sad, considering some of the material at the metroplex that is hardly watchable.  Says quite a bit about the honcho exects greenlighting the product.  They, rightly so, just care about what they think it will produce. ($!)

Moving, emotional, some is sadly raw emotion. Very watchable.",1372032000,,1163,5.8
8206181,4,B000SOMEKM,"Aspiring screenwriters comprise Davids challenging the Goliath of the film industry.  ""Dreams on Spec"" offers a dose of that humbling reality without being a total downer.  Writers will identify with at least one of the hopeful profiled in this pic.",1349740800,,249,5.2
