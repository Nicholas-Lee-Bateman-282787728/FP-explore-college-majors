8311729,1,B001J23SUM,"The problem with this disc is that it does not contain the complete concert (or anywhere close to the entire show).  In fact it misses the real transcendent highlight.  The show has been available in bootleg form for years and one might be better served to search our a torrent for that version.  Especially in light of the high price being charges for this show.  For $12.99 it is a good bargain... For over $70... just avoid it unless you have money to blow for substandard audio, video and portions of the show.",1409184000,3,514,4.494623655913978

This historic concert was a benefit for Springfield Creamery, owned by a friend of Ken Kesey's and Ken, himself, is naturally on hand for the festivities.  The film is a testament to another era as the camera crew spends almost as much time documenting the colorful audience as it does the Dead's amazing versions of China Cat Sunflower, Jack Straw and I Know You Rider.
