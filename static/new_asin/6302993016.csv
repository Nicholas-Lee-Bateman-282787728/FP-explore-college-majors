528045,4,6302993016,"If your a true fan of Speed, than this ones for you! It all begins with a race, No duhh! This time speed is racing the Sahara (Egypt). Part way through the race Speed comes upon ""Dr. Digger O. Bone"" who is being attacked by a death-dealing airplane. The doctor eventually dies, but....with his last breath he asks Speed to find his daughter ""Calcia"" who, along with his assistant ""Split Femur"", have mysteriously disappeared while searching for Cleopatra's tomb.
Trixie Comes along and screws things up. So, once again it's up to Speed to save the day and mabey get the girl...or Two! As always Spridal And Chim-Chim are good for a laugh and dig those cheesey names, ""Split Femur, Calcia, Dr. Digger O. Bone"". What genius thought up those names!
Ever with the lack of the mysterious Racer X ""The Coolest character on the show"", this is still a strong episode.",980208000,3,859,4.657894736842105

528047,5,6302993016,"This episode mixes the plot of ""Prince & the Pauper"" with ninja spies and Formula racing!  Sprital nearly causes an international incident when he trades places with Prince Jam, a young Asian prince who  some how looks exactly like Sprital. The real prince gets spanked by  Pops,teased by Trixie and is subjected to all the problems Speed's little  brother deals with dailey.  Sprital, as the prince, is targeted for  assassination by a would be usurper to the throne.  He gets to fight ninjas  along side his brother and actually gets a chance to participate in a  real,genuine car race, and a Formula One race at that.  As one might  expect, any episode that focuses on Sprital rates high on the laugh-meter.  This is one of the funniest Speed installments ever. It's also got plenty  of action and interesting animated backgrounds. Essential viewing for any  Speed-o-phile.",945648000,2,876,4.951724137931034

It's the late 60s early 70s.. when the world was perhaps a bit more fushed up, but also had a lot more artistic pizzazz.

528200,5,6302993016,"Mostly everyone I know considers Speed Racer to be the 'Godfather' of all Anime. Released here in the 60s, it quickly had people here clamoring for more Japanese cartoons and with good reason. Speed Racer, Volume 2 has Speed racing around the globe in the Mach 5 and continuing his adventures.
This season, he goes up against the likes of:Ali Ben Schemer, Cornpone Brotch, Mr. Cumulus, Kim Jugger, and even Racer X.

I'll admit, I loved the first season. But, I love this season even more. There a couple of memorable episodes here that are my favorites. I highly recommend this to any anime fan or fan of the Speed Racer movie that recently came out.

There's very little in the way of extras but, still, it's well worth getting to see a big craze in American history. America loved its' Speed Racer back in the 70s!!!!",1235952000,,820,4.571428571428571
528201,5,6302993016,"I remember this show back when I was a kid. I was an absolute nut over the show then. When I found out it was on DVD now, I had to get it to add to my collection of animation. Boy, am I glad I did. The old adventures that thrilled me back then, along with the sleek automotive: the Mach 5 was well worth waiting for on DVD. This first DVD collection contains episodes 1 through 11, which-basically-tells how Speed Racer came to be who he is. See, Speed Racer wants to become a professional racer, despite the fact his father doesn't want him to. When Pops quits his job after the company he'd worked for had declined the production of a modified engine for his new racing car, the Mach 5, he thinks of creating his own family owned company, Racer Motors.  Speed takes it upon himself to obtain the money for Pops to produce this modified engine. Using his driving skills to do so, Speed decides to enters a race. Pops conceals his plans for the Mach 5's new engine on a windshield. When the company he worked for finds out, they go after Speed to get it back. Speed soon realizes that the Pops had hidden the plans on the windshield and fights to prevent them from getting it. He shatters the windshield so the company doesn't get it. Speed ends up winning the race but doesn't get the money due to the company's interference. So, Speed apologizes to Pops for this and, thus begins, the adventures of Speed Racer. I really love this first collection. If I had to pick a character, besides Speed, that I loved..it'd have to be Racer X. Him and his car, The Shoooting Star, were awesome.

Admittedly, you can tell the show was made a long time ago. It looks nothing like cartoons of today. Rightly so, as todays' cartoon are digitally done...instead of the cell animation of old. This might disappoint some of you out there who have recently seen Speed Racer(the motion picture) and are expecting this to be something newer. The vocal work is a bit dated as well but nothing to get upset about.

At any rate, I, personally, loved these old cartoons. They thrill me now just as much as they did then.",1235692800,,2097,4.399484536082475

Also the same thing was done with the ending credits.  New Credits were digitized over what appears to be a copy of the animation at the end.

This is the second volume of a five volume series, and contains episodes 12 to 23 of the famous cartoon series of the sixties.

It starts off with ""Race for Revenge (Part 1)"" and ""Race for Revenge (Part 2)"".  In these episodes, Speed works with Inspector Detector to track down a mysterious black car known as the X3.  The main clue is the phrase ""Melange still races"", which leads them to a brother/sister team named Slash and Lilly Marker.

The next two episodes are titled ""The Desperate Desert Race"" (Parts 1 & 2). Characters named Kim Jugger and Ali Ben Schemer co-star, and things get hot for the Mach 5. Schemer is a trusted member of the Flathill rebel forces, until he ""rebels against the rebels.""

Next come ""The Fire Race"" (Parts 1 & 2), and the return of Racer X in a fast paced politically oriented thriller.

Quote from Racer X:

""I've risked my life to save your treasure.  Now, you gentlemen must come to some agreement.  Compromise.  Open your borders to the world some of the time.""

""The Girl Daredevil"" (Parts 1 & 2) introduces the skilful Twinkle Banks, black panthers, a bad guy named Cornpone Brotch and a circus full of tricks.

`The Fastest Car on Earth"" (Parts 1 & 2) follows, with the theft of a powerful engine named the GRX and a villainess named Oriana Flub.

The grand finale is ""The Mach-5 vs. the Mach-5 (Parts 1 & 2) with Dr. Nightcall making a copy of the Mach 5 for the evil Professor Cumulus.

There aren't any extras listed, but each pair of episodes has links to some hidden information and clips.

Recommended for all new Speed racer fans with one comment - make sure you tell your kids that hiding in car trunks only works in cartoons, and they should never try it for themselves.

528261,3,6302993016,"This FIRST set is GREAT!  The first 2 episodes detail the Mach 5, it's development history, and enough character history to add much enjoyment and fun to the rest of the series.  Now as an adult I really appreciate that the art and production quality for the first episode is the same as for the very last; no rough beginning that loses value after watching refined episodes later on.  And the stories in this first set are the best introduction to this Great Classic racing (and adventure) series.  They'll make devoted fans out of you, leave you anxiously yearning for more, and prepare you to get the most enjoyment from the rest.

Speed Racer was my favorite cartoon growing up. I would pass up an after-school KickBall game to watch Speed and the Coolest Car on Earth. I always laughed myself onto the floor watching Spritle's tears spraying out like fountains. These cartoons were crude ... but they had a unique character and spirit that made refined art, sound, and production irrelevant. In fact the mismatched mouth movements (seemingly due to more than translation) and coarse animation only added to it's unique charm.  I've waited a long time for a collection like this.

These characters are beyond endearing.  You just love them; even the villains!  And the voices are so perfectly cliche, and in that way so uniquely Speed Racer; they're hilarious!  The main characters have such great personalities and charm.  And you've got to love the 60s/70s music and pop culture as well as the fun Japanese interpretation (and Japanification) of it that stands out to western audiences (like Trixie's sort-of full-bodied winking peace-sign expression and stance).  And you'll never forget that great opening sequence in which Speed is frozen in that Groovy Racing/Go-Go pose that spins around in a 3D effect.  And the Mach 5!  It's as beautiful today as it was so long ago!  To me, it's the most beautiful car EVER conceived.  I Treasure this great show!

HOWEVER, I agree with other reviewers in that Lion's Gate should have included the original Japanese theme song, and it would have been GREAT to have included a whole episode in Japanese as it aired in Japan.  Interviews with voice-cast members and the Japanese creators (who've got to be the Grooviest most interesting guys!) would have been nice.  Such extras would have made this a much better collection. But they provided none of those things in any of the 5 sets.

Also, they should have put forth some effort to improve the video quality. I have a VHS tape that provides better image quality. It's as if they did not use original masters . . . or perhaps those masters have not been well kept (although it's not bad by any means).

I'd give the Series itself every star in the Universe, but I have to give the collection only 3 Stars.  It could and SHOULD be so much better with the extras and improvements I've mentioned.",1210550400,3,2891,4.763052208835341

528311,5,6302993016,"With the imminent release of the ""Speed Racer"" live action film, a review of the cartoon series that spawned it is in order. This cartoon series having been made in the sixties, shows the simplistic animation prevalent in Japanese cartoons of the period. It's peers, such as Astro Boy, Kimba The White Lion, Gigantor (which were released in Japan under different names) and others, all display this type of animation. There are many adults today, who grew up with these cartoons, that hope the ""Speed Racer"" Live action film meets or exceeds their expectations. Today's kids won't care, obviously, as their knowledge of this cartoon series is slim to none. It is this reviewers' hope that it WILL be good, and thus possibly reinvigorate interest in the cartoon series.

528312,3,6302993016,"This release contains the first eleven episodes of the series, as well as a few extras; however, only the English dub versions of the episodes are included.

There are a few special features included in a section labeled as, ""Speed Racer Files.""  The special features menu is designed to look like file folders, and you click on the tab of the ""file folder"" you want to look at.

""Production"" gives a text-only history of Tatsunoko Productions, the company that produced Speed Racer in Japan.  There is also a text-only history of the U.S. adaptation of the series, a page of lyrics for the Speed Racer theme song and a text-only history of the theme song (including a link to hear the song), and the credits and information for the American voice actors.

""Mach 5"" shows the various controls on the steering wheel of the Mach 5.  Speed Racer can be heard explaining what a control does when the viewer clicks on it.  You can also ""see the feature in action"" (which is footage from the show).

""Villains' Gallery"" includes brief profiles and pictures of eight of the villains.

""Speed Lives On!"" provides two links: ""Sequels & Spin Offs"" and ""Speed Merchandise.""  Under ""Sequels & Spin Offs"" there is a text-only explanation of The New Adventures of Speed Racer (and the opening credits of the series can be viewed), and a text-only explanation for a Volkswagen commercial that included Speed Racer (however, the actual commercial itself is not included).  Under ""Speed Merchandise,"" this is a gallery of merchandise; however, it contained only five items.

My biggest disappointment watching this DVD was the fact that, even though it has chapter marks, they're useless for the viewer.  When watching the DVD, you can't use the ""skip"" function to move ahead to the next chapter; you're forced to use the fast forward button.

The episodes on the disc are actually pretty good.  However, I think the design of the DVD menus are a bit clunky, the extras are a bit underwhelming, and I'm disappointed by the fact that the chapter marks are useless for the viewer.  I wish that instead of trying to cram eleven episodes onto one disc, that this had been released as a two-disc set with some better bonus features.

If you're a fan of the original Speed Racer anime, this is worth picking up to have the first eleven episodes in your DVD collection.  However, just don't expect anything terribly spectacular in the way of special features.",1210118400,6,2435,4.798561151079137

528319,3,6302993016,"I dunno! I felt a bit compelled to write this review only in response to some other reviews I'm reading on this series. People praise this show as ""good family viewing"" with ""entertaining characters"", but there are a few things about this show that elude me. Although I am aware this is mainly a children's show (though I heavily doubt that a great number of today's children would watch it), I still find myself questioning certain things about it... Things most people hardly pay attention to...

For starters, how can one call the characters featured on this show interesting or entertaining when they are vurtually invulnerable? Like, nothin hurts any of them!!! Not even a fall off a cliff!

Then, what fun is there in watching a show about someone who wins all of the time? Can't Speed Racer occasionally lose? Then there's this Spritle Character who's supposed to be a kid right?--more like a midget that looks like a kid. His parents hardly watch him. He goes off on his own all the time, with that monkey, to follow Speed (his older brother) by hitching rides in car trunks and sometimes airplanes or other vehicles--did I mention virtually invulnerable?--then at the same time, he goes around commiting murder constantly: his prime victims usually being sub-intelligent adults with IQ's lower than even mine!!! I wonder if this is actually so good for kids to watch at all...

Maybe we should be thankful that most of the people who watch this are yesterday's kids, who would know better than to take these things seriously. But anyway, I just wrote this to get it off my chest because I'm too dumb to understand this cartoon's psychology--not that I still don't enjoy it at times--but I fully welcome ANY comments someone may have explaining the derrogatory psychology of this show.",1186099200,,1793,4.833876221498372

The other following volumes are only ok. I mean they're good each on their own, but nowhere near as great as this first release of the set. The quality of the show went downhill as can be seen throughout the volumes subsequent releases.

In my opinion, there is an episode in this set that is so much better than the others (which are very good, also), that makes watching the others a little less pleasure.

This episode is so full of action, the race itself so absurdly dangerous and fatal, that you are at the edge of your seta for the most part of the episode. 96 drivers entered the race and only two survived!!",1167868800,,494,4.25531914893617

It has been a long time since I've watched the episodes on television, so I can't comment about lack of quality due to compression or shorter lenght of time in some episodes. But I sure think the producers should have put all 52 episodes into one single DVD box.

Technical aspects aside, the episodes are timeless. Adventure, friendship, charismatic villains, cool cars, clever plots. Of course, the potential is limited due to the quality (or lack of it) of some Japanese animated productions.

There is another package, though, which *looks* exactly the same but is just ink on paper made to look like a tire tread.  Caveat emptor!  I assume the disc is the same, but IMHO the ""real rubber"" package really makes this an extra special item.

I'm not overly disappointed in the quality of the video as some appear to be, but it's true that it could be better.  There are some scenes where the digital artifacts are distracting or obfuscate important details.  Bummer.  Perhaps they'll redo it for BlueRay and cram all 50-odd episodes onto one disc!

Yes, the animation is not the best. No, the plots and dialogue are not on par with CITIZEN KANE. But, this cartoon gem showed loads of imagination and was just such escapist fun, you couldn't help but watch.
The DVD has some nice extras, is smartly packaged in genuine tire rubber, and has good sound and picture.

I like many other 40+ year olds, used to run home from school just to watch Speed Racer & Gigantor on channel 11. Man those were good cartoons. Not too violent,(for me that is) no real hidden political agendas. Just good clean japanese cartoon fun! The Japanese cartoons of today are SOOOOOO stupid and uncreative, it's just a shame that so many kids think that these crappy cartoons are good! Garbage cartoons such as Yu Ghe oh & that little yellow piece of crap Pinkachu or the ridiculously named cartoon, Satch Bell? What the hell did they get that name from? Are the people that created these cartoons out of their minds or were they just high on some bad speed? (no pun intended for Speed Racer) The way these japanese cartoons are drawn today, you would think that the cartoonist must have been a drug user or alcohol abuser, or just plain violent! MAN THEY'RE BAD! And I mean BAD in the real meaning of the word, not the ""cool"" street lingo it can also mean. THESE JAPANESE CARTOONS TODAY REALLY REALLY SUCK! Plus the storylines are geared towards the older teens not the 5 to 12 year olds that could watch Speed or gigantor or Marine Boy, which unfortunately, I can't find any DVDs for. My son is just turning 5 & he is going to know what good cartoons were like. So I am going to buy these DVDs of Speed Racer, Gigantor and when available, Marine Boy. Hopefully,in the future, I'll be able to buy another great japanese cartoon called Tobor, the eigth man, again when it's available.

528363,5,6302993016,"This second of a projected 4-volume set collecting the entirety of the 1960s Speed Racer features several solid adventures and two of the character's very best. Speed Racer episodes are about evenly split between one- and two-parters. All the stuff here is two-parters: 12 eps, six stories.

""Race for Revenge"" pits Speed against the radio controlled ""ghost car,"" number X3, the Melange. A decent story but the weakest here, in my opinion.

In ""The Dangerous Desert Race"" Speed travels to the Middle Eastern country of Sandoland, there to race against the arrogant Kim Jugger and his Black Tiger. Unfortunately Part 1 of ""TDDR"" is a noticeable example of a problem that would haunt the middle episodes of Speed Racer: its artwork is much more simplistic and the animation quite limited versus the series' better eps. The good news is that in Part 2 things improve immensely.

""The Fire Race"", though it doesn't have the aclaim of, say, ""The Mammoth Car"" is one of the best Speed Racers. The artwork and animation are among the finest we'll see in the series. It's also one of the most inventive storylines, complete with an entire underground (under-volcano) deserted ancient city, whirlpools hiding huge statues, a giant flesh eating plant, a pirahna-filled river and some fairly graphic - for a cartoon of its vintage - scenes of them stripping a leopard and man, corridor walls studded with a king's ransom in diamonds, the Mach 5 racing through the ribcage of a brontosaurus skeleton, and so on. It co-stars Racer X.

""The Girl Daredevil"" is one of the most frustrating Speed Racers. The ""girl daredevil,"" Twinkle Banks, is in many respects the perfect match for Speed. Not only is she drop dead gorgeous, she matches him in driving skill and overall guts. Twinkle makes Trixie look pale indeed. It may be silly to speak of ""chemistry"" between cartoon characters, but every moment Twinkle and Speed are together you get the feeling these two were made for each other. What irks me about this story is it's the premier example of one of the few real problems I have with the Speed Racer series, its underlying sexism. It's one thing to have Speed's occasional comments on what are and aren't appropriate actions for a ""girl"" (never a woman); at least they never really affect the storyline. In ""The Girl Daredevil"" however I found it absolutely unbelievable that Twinkle, who introduces herself by leaping off a skyscraper as a publicity stunt, would faint under stress while driving, requiring rescue by Speed. Even as a kid I said, ""Oh, come ON.""

""The Girl Daredevil"" also has the most glaring example of a story point changed in the translation from Japanese to English. Twinkle says her lion tamer father's circus went bankrupt because he loved the animals so much he fed them only the best, most expensive food. (Blech!) Watching the pictures that go with the words, it's obvious he lost his nerve after being mauled by the big cats. This makes it far more dramatic when, late in the story, he must overcome that fear to save his life. Perhaps the English language crew thought the whole ""mauled by lions"" thing a bit too high octane for kiddies in 1967. Puzzling that, considering the scenes throughout the entire series of people being shot to death, crushed, beaten, killed in explosions, etc. but there it is.

""The Fastest Car On Earth"" is one of the series' most fondly remembered adventures, in which Speed finds himself both behind the wheel of and also racing against the GRX, a car so fast it breaks the mind of anyone trying to drive it. As a kid I loathed the idea there could be any car faster than the Mach 5. But I have to admit I loved it when, late in the story, Speed, totally strung out and terror-stricken from the effects of drugs he's been given that allowed him to drive the GRX, has to overcome his fear and push the Mach 5 to the limit in a race. Not simply to win, but to prove to himself he's not a coward, that NOTHING can break him, not even the GRX. This story really highlighted what made Speed Racer, the character and the show, special.

In ""Mach 5 Vs. Mach 5"" Speed's opponent is armed with his own version of the Mach 5 - only instead of the homing robot it has a destructive ray beam, and it can fly. The whole ray beam thing was like, eh, okay, but the idea of a flying Mach 5....well let's just say I hated to admit it but I thought Mr. Cumulus' car was (gasp) even better than Speed's. Sacrilege, I know. Worth noting: in the 1997 Japanese revamp of the show, Speed's Mach 5 could fly, too. Obviously the makers of the '97 Mach Go, Go, Go remembered Mr. Cumulus' flying Mach 5 and how utterly cool it was.

Each new volume in the Speed Racer ""Limited Collector's Edition"" series has its own ""gimmick packaging."" Volume 1 had the rubber tire tread slipcover. For volume 2, when you press a certain spot on the slipcover, the Mach 5's headlights glow and part of the theme song plays. When I first heard about that, before I actually saw it, I thought it sounded cheesy as hell. Having now tried it, I think it's wonderfully fun. Every time I press that ""secret spot,"" the Mach 5's headlights come on and I hear ""Go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer, go Speed Racer go...."" I can't help but smile.

No disrespect to those 2 characters though, it wouldnt be Speed Racer without them. Fans of the show can now own the first 11 episodes, which are great in setting up the rest of the series. How Speed is such a good racer, how Racer X came to be are some of the questions answered in these first episodes. The rubber tire packaging was a great touch and for what you are buying this is a great price. This is a series adults and kids alike will enjoy so I recommend picking it up. Who can resist the antics of the Racer family and Speed's great races? As far as extras there is nothing great here. There is a trailer for the 90's series, and it looks terrible. It is an abomination to animation. This series will seem even better after you see that so enjoy episodes 1-11 of Speed Racer, then buy Volume 2 with episodes 12-23. Episodes on this set are:

The Great Plan (1&2)

Challenge of the Masked Racer (1&2)

The Secret Engine (1&2)

The Race Against the Mammoth Car (1&2)

The Most Dangerous Race (1,2&3)",1090627200,6,1105,4.3707317073170735
528372,5,6302993016,"The eleven episodes of Speed Racer on this DVD are a surefire way to bring nostalgic parents and their wide-eyed children closer together. I just got this and my four-year-old has barely watched anything else since it went in the DVD player. I'm not the world's biggest Chim-Chim and Spritle fan, but my son can't get enough.

 All I remember of the show from my childhood is the catchy refrain in the theme song and that I loved watching it. Personally, the problems people have had with the opening and closing titles being different aren't a big issue for me. And I'm not watching with a stopwatch, so time compression isn't a big deal either. The shows themselves are what I got the DVD for and as far as I'm concerned, they're great.

 That's not to say the DVD is perfect. I've noticed an occasional audio ""chirping"" glitch here and there, but not enough to be a problem. My biggest problem is that your viewing choices are limited to ""play all"" or each episode individually, and that you can't chapter advance while ""playing all."" So if I want to watch the three-part ""The Most Dangerous Race"" I can sit through the first 8 episodes or after watching episode 9, I have to push ""play"" again for ep. 10 and then again for #11. Not the biggest of deals, but along with the fact that the episodes aren't broken into chapters, either (if you stop watching 2/3rds of the way through, be sure to set a bookmark, or be ready to fast-forward forever), it makes it difficult to watch the DVD the way you want to watch it.

 The extras are nice, but nothing incredible (although the footage of the mid-90s remake makes you appreciate the original even more). A trivia section, explaining things like why Speed has a ""G"" on his shirt, or why cars change colors halfway through the big turn in the opening sequence, would have been nice. Granted, most of that is available on the Internet, but having it on the disk would have been better than pictures of a few items of Speed memorabilia with no context attached to them.

 I know this review has been mostly drawing attention to the DVD's flaws, but I still stand by my 5-star rating. The individual episodes are wonderful. The stories, while occasionally hokey, are engaging and fun. The artwork and sound are great. And then there's that theme song ... whoa Nellie! Minor gripes aside, this is a great DVD for young and old. Don't miss it.",1089331200,10,2387,4.547785547785548
528373,5,6302993016,"At a low price, you get some of the better Speed Racer episodes from the 1960s cartton series. This isn't any recent Speed Racer movies or any further cheapening of the original, this is the original featured in its original form.
These are the next installment of six episodes [two half-hour segments a piece]. Included are some of my all-time Speed Racer episodes: ""The Fire Race"" (with the mysterious Kabala), ""The Dangerous Desert Race"", and probably my all-time favorite Speed Racer episode: ""The Fastest Car on Earth"" (where Speed must race against a car so fast and dangerous that no man can drive it).
Speed Racer is a highly original and unique series that never got the recognition it deserved. It's high quality animation for all ages. I loved Speed Racer as a child growing up in the 1970s. They don't make cartoons this cool anymore.
I highly recommend this DVD for fans. There's a few extras too. But overall, the original episodes are presented in decent quality with good sound quality as well. You won't be disappointed. At a low cost, this set can be considered a ""volumne two"" to complement last year's Speed Racer DVD package.

528407,5,6302993016,"I find this particular episode interesting because something rather unusual happens here. Speed Racer manages to surprise (or shock) the  viewers, including yours truly, by stealing the sleek, gold-tone race car with the super-natural ""GRX"" engine under it's hood. Because of his scrupulous up-bringing, it is unusual to see Speed commit a crime. He's ""Mr. goody two shoes"". Always trying to do the right thing. But Speed did not have the benefit of a ""special treatment"" GRX race car drivers receive before they're allowed to get near the car. Without this treatment ,as Speed will soon learn, which is administered by the car's owner (who also grave-robbed the GRX), a driver has NO chance of keeping the GRX, which travels at an unearthly speed, under his control. This treatment is supposed to enhance a race car driver's reflex - to enable him to react (and, or act) to the car's sudden movements as he's driving it. Without it, the driver goes insane; and usually ends up killed, or seriously injured in a spectacular crash. Fortunately, Speed's father, ""Pops"" Racer, his little brother, Spritle, and Spritle's pet chimpanzee, Chim Chim are in hot pursuit. What follows is a hilarious rescue attempt by Chim Chim; Spritle and Chim Chim always privide welcomed, comic-relief. And I loved the way Pops Racer mixes it up with the brutes. As a former pro wrestler, he handled himself (and the brutes) really well. This is one of my favorite episodes.",1082937600,3,1452,4.950819672131147

They follow Speed Racer to an Arab country, where he will participate in a desert race. The other reason I enjoyed this episode: Speed meets, and clashes with an arrogant, arab prince who will also compete in the race. But they both join forces, later, to fight the prince's unscrupulous associate who tries to take over the kingdom his father rules. This is a ""feel-good"" episode; one of my favorites; because Speed Racer is always putting his life on the line to help others. But, I was especially touched by the arab prince; because, despite his arrogance, he reaches out to save Speed's life first when Speed doesn't realize he's in danger.",1082937600,,750,4.813953488372093

528411,5,6302993016,"I'm proud to say that I'm one of Speed Racer's FIRST generation American viewers. I distinctly remember seeing this fantastic series for the first time in late '67--when I was a mere 14 yr. old growing up in northern New Jersey--and it blew me away from the get go. There was nothing to compare it with--the beautiful animation and snappy dialogue was WORLDS APART from what the Hanna-Barbera people were doing at the time--of course, back then, I was way too unsophisticated to notice or care about such droll distinctions--all I knew was SPEED was COOL and Trixie was a BABE!! hehehe (never could ""get"" the whole Spridle,Chim-Chim thing, though.....but I guess that was part of SR's over-all charm, I suppose..a little strange incongruity doesnt hurt, does it?) As I view the series now--well into middle-age, a WONDERFUL NOSTALGIA overwhelms me--as I'm sure it does for all those who grew up with this quirky, yet seminal cartoon (I cringe at having to refer to SR as a ""toon""--- because it means SO much MORE than that to me---but, alas... that's what it was, after all).... A truly BELOVED cartoon that will never be forgotten by  so many of us over a certain age. I thank from the bottom of my heart all those brilliant Japanese artists and American voice actors who brought us this glorious work of art so many years ago. This dvd is a MUST for those that adore the show.",1071532800,11,1378,4.670781893004115
528412,5,6302993016,"I've loved Speed Racer since I was a little kid. When Ted Turner's first television station, WTBS, Channel 13, started up in Georgia in the mid-70s, he had all the great old shows, The Munsters, The Brady Bunch, Get Smart, The Addams Family, I Dream of Jeannie, The Partridge Family....all part of his afternoon lineup. Speed Racer came on at 3 PM, Monday thru Friday. Every weekday for years I'd get out of school at 2:30, the bus would take me home, I'd rush into the house and turn on the TV just in time for the theme song. I never got tired of it.

(Just an interesting point of trivia - I think - in a book on Speed Racer I read the results of a survey where Speed fans were asked what they considered the single most important reason Speed Racer is so popular. The #1 answer: the theme song.)

I've seen some TV shows I loved as a kid, years later when they were released on video, and wondered how I ever could have enjoyed them. Being three years old is no excuse. The prime example being 8th Man. But I watch Speed Racer today, and while I'm well aware that, because of my history with the show, the fact it was such an important of my life while growing up, I love it perhaps more than can really be justified by what's there....some episodes still DO it for me. And that's pretty darn cool.

What in America we call Speed Racer actually began in the Sixties in Japan as a manga (comic book) called Maha Go Go Go. In America you'll usually see this partially translated as Mach Go Go Go so that's the terminology I'll use from here on. Grand prix auto racing was very popular in Japan at the time, almost a national obsession. To Tatsuo Yoshida, the creator/artist/writer of Mach Go Go Go, the opportunity presented by this situation was obvious: create a series about a teenage Grand Prix driver. I have reprints of several of the original manga. At least some of the anime episodes (more about which shortly) were adaptations of previously published manga stories.

The ....Go Go Go part of the title was a triple entendre. (1) ""Go"" means the number five in Japanese, it was a reference to the car's name, the Mach 5. (2) In the original manga and anime, the main character we call Speed Racer in the US was named Go Mifune (or Goh Mifune, I've seen it spelled both ways), a homage to Japanese actor Toshiro Mifune (Yoshida was a huge fan) which explains why ""Speed"" has a yellow G on his shirt and his support crew is called the Go Team. (3) The American word ""Go,"" i.e. ""Haul it, dude.""

The big red M on the Mach 5's hood, which in America we commonly assumed stood for ""Mach 5"" was actually the emblem of Mifune Motors, Pops Racer's car company. Likewise this explains the M on Speed's helmet. Trixie had an M on her blouse because in the original manga/anime her name was Michi Shimura. Sparky lucked out; the S on his chest happened to match both his Japanese name, Sabu, and American renaming, as well.

One thing that never made any sense to me, when watching Speed Racer as a kid, was that Racer X had the ""Mach 5 symbol"" on his chest. It makes even less sense once you learn this is the Mifune Motors emblem. ""Hello Speed, I'm secretly Kenichi Mifune, your older brother who ran away from home years ago. In order to hide this fact, I will....wear the emblem of the family business in foot high lettering on my chest!"" Good plan. They'll never figure that one out. And of course, they didn't.

In the original manga - and this is something we never really got from the anime - Michi (Trixie) was the spoiled, willful, rich daughter of the head of a rival car company (which explains how she owns her own helicopter - something I always wondered about as a kid - and drives a Mercedes). She first met the Racers when she was sent to spy on them. Wouldn't she know it, she fell in love with Speed which kind of scotched that plan. In my early teens I couldn't understand what Speed saw in Trixie. It's only with adult sensibilities that I appreciate what a total little hottie Trixie really was.

Of course I hated the bratty kid brother. And the monkey! Don't get me started. WAY too much unneeded so-called comic relief in what should have been - and was - a really exciting, dramatic adventure series. I took my Speed Racer seriously. I could never understand how a guy as cool as Speed could have such a whiny little snot-nosed punk of a brother.

All 52 episodes of the original Mach Go Go Go anime were translated into English and in 1967 began airing in America as Speed Racer. The series is about equally split between stand alone eps and two-parters (there's only one three-part Speed Racer). The series has a very self-contained air, with a beginning, middle and an end. It begins with Speed's first professional race and ends when he wins the world championship. In the late 80s thru early 90s the entire series was released on video tape. I bought about half the series, all the tapes I could find, at that time. Just a few months ago the first 11 episodes were released on DVD. You better believe I bought that one. (Hopefully we'll eventually see all 52 episodes on DVD.) All the video tapes that were dupes of DVD eps I then turned around and gave to my next door neighbor's teenage son. Spreading the glory and majesty that is Speed Racer to a new generation. And he really liked them. Obviously there's hope for America's future, after all.",1067472000,34,5378,4.418768920282543

If you grew up on these like I did, you're in for a treat! If not, this DVD may not be for you. But you probably wouldn't be looking at this if you weren't already into Speed!
As for the DVD itself, I have had some problems. I have a couple of players. My older Toshiba (which is usually picky) plays it fine, but my Apex (which normally plays ANYTHING without problem) doesn't. It's like it's in some kind of ""single frame"" mode, playing about one frame every couple of seconds and no sound. Haven't tried it on my PCs.",1059350400,4,689,4.267175572519084

I remembered watching Speed Racer in the 70's as a kid and loving every minut, but dreading the cliff hanger endings because you couldn't always be sure to see the second part (without VCR's to record a week in advance we missed a lot!) Now, not only could I watch the first 11 episodes at once if I chose, but I could share Speed Racer with my kids (aged 7 and 4).  I had a hunch they would be hooked... and you know, I was right!  Speed Racer is like the precursor to Pokemon... without the monsters.  In fact a lot of the poses Speed makes are like Ash Ketchum... The action... quick and cut away is similar at times.  But that is beside the point, my kids were mesmerized by the story lines and the cliffhangers (perhaps it was cruel, but I forced them to watch only one episode a day...not the whole DVD as they would have gladly done... afterall, that is actually part of the experience.. that delayed gratification of seeing Speed beat the odds.)
If you remember watching Speed Racer as a kid.. don't hesitate to buy this for your own and your kid's enjoyment... Speed Racer is awesome!",1057708800,,1192,4.375565610859729

That's bad.
Also bad is the misspelling of Jack Grimes' name as one of the voices. On the videotapes, it is correctly spelled Grimes; on the DVD it is Crimes. That, along with the fast playback on some of the episodes shows that little care was used in putting this DVD together. Family Home Entertainment should be ashamed.

528487,4,6302993016,"Speed Racer is the kind of cartoon that can make a deep and lasting impression. Though it had been nearly thirty years since I had last seen it, the memory of the characters and basic storylines, remained very much intact. Watching these episodes, and hearing the music and sound effects again, the memories quickly came flooding back. And while I didn't remember exactly what each button on Speed's steering wheel did, viewing the cartoon again was still a pleasant trip down memory lane.
The action adventure cartoon from Japan, follows the exploits of Speed Racer, an ambitious and sometimes headstrong, 18-year old racecar driver. His automobile, the Mach 5, is equipped with numerous high tech features that enable Speed to deal with a variety of hazardous situations. The concept of a super slick racing car, driven by a squeaky clean hero type is a good one. The Mach Five, is probably the coolest, most famous, animated racecar ever. Though the car itself has great appeal, it is the interaction between Speed, and his family and friends, that holds your interest. Sure, the plots don't always make too much sense, and level of realism isn't very high, but this is after all, only a cartoon.
Though done in a light-hearted manner, like many cartoons of the time, Speed Racer is pretty violent, with lots of action, fights, explosions, gunplay, car chases and fatal crashes. And while it may be tame compared to the animated features currently on TV, this still may not suitable for little children. In one episode (The Secret Engine), though in self-defense, Speed even appears to cause a death in a rockslide.
The credits list only three people as providing the voices, and that seems entirely possible, as listening to the cartoon, similar sounding voices frequently reoccur among the various characters. This tends to make the cartoon a little monotonous aurally. The music however, is quite stimulating, and is used effectively to complement the action, especially in the episodes featuring the Mammoth Car, and The Most Dangerous Race.
Visually, the transfer to DVD is excellent. The images are sharp, and the colors are solid and clear. There is minimal evidence of flaws or deterioration in the images. The DVD, is an excellent value, as it contains the first eleven episodes of the show, and clocks in at around 262 minutes. The ""Limited Edition"" has a sleeve that slides over the DVD case. The sleeve has glued to it an image of Speed set against the background of a tire tread, made of real rubber. The presentation is not without flaws however. For some unfathomable reason, there are no chapter stops, and without them, jumping around the disc is no easy task. Design of the menu is poor as well. The ""extras"" on the DVD are not very noteworthy either.
So while the DVD comes up short in the ""gravy"" department, the ""meat"" is all there. For fans of Speed and the gang, this disc is definitely a must have, and is available at a very reasonable price. Get your copy today. ""Adventure's waiting just ahead.""",1053993600,7,3025,4.852998065764023
528488,5,6302993016,"I highly recommend the Speed Racer episodes 1-11 to anyone who wishes to see what the 1966 classic looks and sounds like on DVD!. I have been a fan since I  first saw Speed Racer premiere in March of 1967 on local TV. It's first-run ended in April of 1968 and then was re-ran through the late 70's. The Japanese company who made and copyrighted it in 1966 and it took them another year for it to be dubbed in English and distributed in US and Japan in 1967 and 1968. The original Trans-Lux credits; I could never forget seeing the 1966 on them when it first came on. I see someone made a misconception about the year it was assembled and later released in Japanese and US markets, no big deal. The US company that bought Speed Racer in 1993 had to replace the original Trans-Lux credits ( beginning and ending titles ), because the company was no longer in business that year and that is legalties for you. The ending animated credits are the same, except the computer credits are off the original video masters that Speed Racer Enterprises made off 35 negatives and later Cartoon Network bought the show and they time-compressed the show for commercial spots. Someone made a mistake with Jack Grime's last name Ha! I have them on VHS with the old white-lettered opening credits and and rarely play them, the DVD so much easier.  Some of my friends work in the video and audio field and as soon as the DVD arrived, we all sat down for almost 5 hours and watched it on a giant 53 inch Hi-Def TV and progressive scan DVD player. Nothing was time-compressed on the DVD/video and the audio as well. A subtle, if perhaps faster intro with the opening title, which was replaced years ago when Trans-Lux in NY, who bought and marketed the show for TV in 1967, decades later went out of business in 1993, but it was barely noticable, if at all on the DVD the new titles. The video quality is pristine and what artifacts I did see were from the original 35 mm film itself. My DVD player did not freeze up at all. That also depends on the quality of your DVD player. Any artifacts, so minor you would not even spot them, especially on a giant screen TV! The clarity of DVD is so powerful! The colors are perfect and details are so easily seen, that I missed on TV and old VHS cheated us out of for years!  This reproduction by Artisan surpasses the DVD set issued by Speed Racer Ent in 2001 here in the US. That set was done decently and with limited funds in 2001, and I compared both, and the SRE DVD box set ( which had visible artifacts and more edge noise to a much more higher degree ), is inferior to the new Speed Racer episodes 1-11 by Artisan. I am not complaining though. I enjoy them all!  Now let's get episodes 12-52 on DVD's from Artisan by Christmas time when they give us the pre-ordering date! They said later this year, I hear Santa's bells ringing! As for the Japanese version, no one would be able to understand it unless they lived over there or we would all have to pay for a translater!

528489,5,6302993016,"FIRST, the ONLY obvious difference from TV-run versions, is a new ""SPEED RACER"" title logo.  THAT'S IT.  The ending credits (as original as ever)--are still as smudgy as they were originally aired in the US with its early use of crude-looking video-over-animation titles (AND still horribly misspelling Jack Grimes' name as ""Crimes"")...if they were NEW titles, I think they would have corrected that legendary goof (considering the voice-over cast bios--including the correctly-spelled 'Grimes' in the Extra Features.)
As for any blurred images...there were a few ""dramatic"" film dissolves between scenes--that was all the blurring that could be seen in any of the 11 crystal-sharp episodes.  And the colors are absolutely vibrant, causing me to assume that these episodes were taken from master prints.  True, there are a few specks here-and-there, but you're talking about a much-handled, imported, re-dubbed animated show from 1967!
The only time the video portion ""freezes,"" ...if anyone recalls the original episodes, is when, after the first minute-or-so, as each story begins, there was/is a dramatic freeze-frame image of the main subject of that particular episode (my guess is that the original Japanese title was inserted at that point).
There's honestly no way to be truly disappointed with this release--even being lucky enough to finally see the series (begin) to be digitally preserved.  Any high-tech analysis down to the exact frame of video should be quickly dismissed and considered downright silly.  There's approximately 4.5 hours of SPEED, and with Bonus Material (however minimal), this single and highly-affordable DVD (no flipping, even!) merits nothing short of 5-STARS!",1052697600,19,1696,5.528957528957529
528490,1,6302993016,"...I compared the ""Race Against The Mammoth Car"" episodes contained here and on the ""Speed Racer - The Movie"" (SRTM) DVD.  The SRTM version runs the same speed as the Japanese DVD version. The ""Episodes 1-11"" DVD version of this episode runs *faster* than both of these... (Try it yourself by running SRTM on one player and ""Ep. 1-11"" on another. (I used my computer's DVD drive for the second player.) You'll find the ""Ep. 1-11"" version start to get ahead of the SRTM version immediately and it will continue to move away as you watch.
While doing my research, I also discovered that the ""Ep. 1-11"" version was EDITED FOR CONTENT! There is a scene where Sparky is hauled into a room by a wrench-wielding bad guy. Both the SRTM & Japanese versions include a shot of the wrench being raised to hit ol' Sparky on the head. The ""Ep. 1-11"" version is missing this small scene. I can see why this scene may be cut on TV to prevent kiddies from being traumatized, but it shouldn't be cut from a supposedly ""uncut"" home video release! (FYI, the Japanese version includes a sound effect of Sparky actually getting conked, while the SRTM version just has the bad guy chuckling...!)
The ""Ep. 1-11"" version also suffers big time in the audio department. When you watch it and then switch to the SRTM version, you'll notice a marked improvement in audio. The ""Ep-1-11"" version sound very flat in comparison...
And, of course, the video quality of the ""Ep. 1-11"" version pales when you compare it. Its bit rate runs at less than half of the SRTM version. When you use the ""step"" mode of your DVD player, you get fuzzy ""transition"" frames most of the time. The SRTM version doesn't have these transition frames and steps smoothly & clearly (as it should).
Finally, many people have commented on the credits (both opening and closing) being changed.  Well, I also compared the ""Ep. 1-11"" version with an old (now out of print) Speed Racer laserdisk, and I can tell you that BOTH sets of credits HAVE been changed!  The orignal opening credits start with a ""Trans-Lux Television Presents"" credit, and has a white Speed Racer logo that slowly ""dissolves"" after it's on screen for a few seconds.  The new version eliminates the Trans Lux credit, and the new red & yellow Speed Racer logo is obviously computer-generated.  The opening credits have also been sped up and now run 5 to 10 seconds faster than the orignal...
The closing credits have also been altered.  The orignal version has a very distinctive font and typical filmed credits.  The new version has computer-generated credits, a completely different font, AND to show how the producers really don't care about quality, they misspelled Jack Grimes' name (He's now ""Crimes""...).  The original version has his name spelled correctly.
So, if you want 11 episodes of Speed Racer that have been digitally compressed too much, time compressed, edited for content, and had the opening & closing sequences changed, go for this. If you don't, then I suggest bypassing this low-budget offering.",1052438400,12,3028,4.787356321839081
528491,5,6302993016,"A terrific DVD... great picture, sound, and everything is well organized.  And you actually get a lot more than the rubber wrap-around outer box says you get... the outer package says you get 120 minutes of cartoons, but in reality you get a very generous 360 minutes (the actual DVD box lists the correct running time).  Also, some readers have observed that the opening and closing credits are different or revised from the original broadcasts.  I don't know about those folks, but the credits seem to be exactly as I remembered them as a kid... the theme song, incidental music, what you see, etc. (for example, the closing credits have all the main characters driving old cars that slowly evolve into more modern ones, just as I remember from when I was a kid).  Perhaps there were different credits in different markets, or the credits changed in later episodes, I don't know.  Anyway, the stories hold up very well, and are still very entertaining for the adult me.  They all have a great combination of thrills, adventure, whimsical humor, and great imagination (remember the ""Mammoth Car""?)  In any event, if it isn't clear already, this disc is highly recommended for anyone with a more than passing interest in the world of Speed Racer.",1052352000,3,1246,4.821596244131455
528492,2,6302993016,"It shows they did not put much effort into this remastering if they couldn't include the original Japanese language track. Absolutely a crime to not do so in my opinion. Dubbing movies and television shows into another language is possibly the worst thing that happened to movies, and this is no exception. (Sorry people who never saw the original series living on nostalgia, but it's true.) Also, many scenes were cut for the American broadcast for 'violence'. So please, why the edited version on DVD? 2 giant reasons not to buy this set, but if you're a collector and want a rubber tire for your DVD collection, I can't stop you. But you have been warned along with countless others giving this DVD a mediocre review.",1052006400,3,720,4.722222222222222
528493,5,6302993016,"At first I was a bit hesitant to buy this DVD;I kept thinking to myself,""Do you really,REALLY want to buy this DVD?"" After watching the first five minutes,I was extremely happy that I did!
Everything was as I remember,and let me tell you,no kid's anime of today can beat Speed Racer! The action and plots are really cool, and nothing is better than watching the comic stylings of Spritle and Chim Chim ^__^I was only going to watch a couple episodes a night,but I  got addicted and ended up watching all 5 hours in one sitting!
 There is also of course alot of ""in humor"" that cult fans of the show will find priceless. For instance how often we are reminded that ""Racer X is in fact Speed's older brother Rex who ran away from home many years ago"".Or how anything great or going well is ""groovy"";and of course how Trixie can fly a helicopter no problem,but she looks absolutely dumbfounded when Speed asks her to drive! Little things like these are all gold nuggets that make the show even more popular..and I loved it!
 The bonus material on this DVD is also really cool,such as the villain's gallery,the interactive Mach 5 control demonstrations and let's not forget the sing-along lyrics to the theme song! There is also alot of interesting information on the director/ translator Peter Fernandez,and all of the voice actors. I had no idea that Carrie Orrington (voice of Trixie/Spritle) also did the voice for ""Snuggle"" the fabric softener teddy bear on commercials! Lastly the DVD cover made out of rubber tire material was pretty clever,and just another reason to buy this  set. By the way,everything is all on one disc,which makes for  quick easy viewing.
 About five years ago,Cartoon Network used to play Speed Racer quite a bit...then they only played it late at night...then not at all.(Sigh) I guess they thought Dragonball Z and Pokemon were cooler;well shame on them! Now I can watch REALLY great anime whenever I want,and I look forward to buying more episodes. Go Speed Racer Go!!",1051574400,4,1997,4.757225433526012
528494,5,6302993016,"Certainly a bit dated in a number of ways, Speed Racer is still an excellent and highly enjoyable cartoon from the early days of Japanese cartoons.
The first 11 episodes (which include my personal favorite arc, ""The Most Dangerous Race"") have been crammed onto one disc, and with pretty good results. The opening credits and end credits look pretty bad, but the episodes, for the most part, look better than they have in years. (The intros and some of the eps seem slightly blurry when the camera is moving, but as far as I can tell, the episodes haven't been time-compressed or any other garbage like that. More than likely, it's a sign of shoving so much data onto a single disc.)
The special features are a bit basic (cast bios, production info, etc.), but aren't entirely unwelcome, just not as plentiful as one would expect. All in all, though, this set is a fine start to the series on DVD.",1051228800,9,896,4.571428571428571

Contains 11 episodes, Some are 2 parters, there is 1 three part episode. There have been some MINOR changes though...they changed the opening titles....other than that, everything is the same as I remember it. Go get Speed Racer, GO!",1051228800,3,408,4.927536231884058
528514,2,6302993016,... the quality is horrible. It seems to stem from the digitalization process that any time there is motion within the frame (which is all the time) the image blurs. The people at Family Home Entertainment seem to have realized this because they superimposed new titles throughout the disc. This is very noticeable as the font used is quiet different than the originals. In addition the image seems washed out and the speed of the cartoon tends to vary especially during the opening theme. None of these problems are apparent in FHE's VHS versions of the episodes offered. Yet another serious drawback of this release is the lack of commentary from Peter Fernandez & Corine Orr the original voices on the show as was offered in the Speed Racer Movie released some time ago. What extras they do offer are .... In FHE's defense the idea of this release was great in packaging the first 11 episodes in order on one disc but any serious fan of this series would be FAR better off owning the VHS tapes.,1051228800,,997,4.606741573033708
528515,5,6302993016,"This is a nifty little package at a great price, complete with rubber front case. There really isn't much to say outside of the DVD contains the first 11 episodes (all paired, so basically, it's the first 5 stories). I am strongly hoping there will be a future release box set that will contain all the episodes. I was a big fan of this series when I was a kid, and probably will be for life.
The DVD mastering is great, the picture is sharp and clear and looks great. The sound is good too. There aren't a heap of extras on the DVD, but there really doesn't need to be.
Great cartoon, great DVD - buy it today and enjoy!",1051228800,2,621,4.140495867768595
528516,2,6302993016,"So, you waited MANY years to finally get the original Speed Racer show on DVD!  (I know I did!) Well, you may be disappointed with this release. (I know I was!)  Why was I so upset?  Well, read on:
First and foremost, this is NOT the same version of Speed Racer we grew up with! Both the opening credits sequence and the closing credits sequence have been re-done. Gone are the original ""Trans-Lux"" credit and the exciting swirling white animated ""Speed Racer"" logo. Now, the opening boasts cheesy yellow & red titles that were obviously created by computer. The lousy graphics were then placed over a re-edited opening sequence that uses the original Japanese version as its base (You can see the swirling red Japanese title in the middle of the wheel). This is where the computer-generated credits are used (with jarring, ham-fisted edits!). The closing credits also feature computer-created graphics that are superimposed over out-of-focus background animation. The closing theme also appears to have been re-recorded...
Look, I know you shouldn't base your purchase solely on the fact the opening and closing credits were changed, so let's look at the episodes themselves:
The colors are very good, as it does look like the producers of this DVD went back to the original Japanese masters. The problem is that the producers decided to pack *5 hours* of material onto *one* single-sided DVD! The episodes have been compressed too much! The bit rate fluctuates from only 2.1Mbps to about 4.5Mbps. (Compare this to the 6.9Mbps to 10.0Mbps bit rate of Rhino's ""Battle of the Planets"" DVDs.) The Speed Racer episodes suffer from quite a bit of digital artifacting. My disc's video also freezes from time to time.
Maybe the producers of this think they are being generous by including 11 episodes. Well, I think they could have given us 11 episodes over 2 discs, or at least one double-sided disc. They compressed the material too much, and the final results are very disappointing.
Beyond the video compression the producers used to cram 5 hours of material onto one DVD, many of the episodes have also been ""time-compressed"", meaning they have been sped up.  This is usually done so stations can air more commercials, but for a home video release, it's inexcusable!

So, how do I know they have been time-compressed?  Well, I compared the actual episode content (minus the opening & closing credits) of the first eight episodes to the Japanese version.  Of these first 8 episodes, 3 run faster than the originals.  Now, the US-version is edited in a few places, so that will shorten their runing time, but identical portions should run the same speed.  Sadly, they don't.

When you watch the episodes side by side (something my TV is capable of doing), the US Speed Racer episodes start getting ahead of their Japanese counterparts.  Episodes 1, 7, and 8 all immediately start running faster than the originals.  The running time for the first episode is 21:31.  Compare that to the 22:45 of the Japanese original (1:14 faster).  That's enough for 2 more commercials!  Episode 7 is 1:35 faster, and episode 8 is a minute faster.

I don't want to speculate on why the producers felt the need to time-compress these episodes, but it shouldn't have been done!
The Japanese release of ""Mach Go Go Go (Speed Racer's original Japanese name) came out on a total of 9 DVDs. They cost a lot more than this disc, yet they feature a much better picture, with less compression. I only wish the US-version was of the same high-standard as the Japanese-version. Sadly, it's not.
Finally, to emphasize how [bad] an operation this whole DVD is, look at its ""1966"" copyright date. Well, ""Mach Go Go Go"" wasn't released in Japan until 1967, and the US version didn't come out for another year or two...! Why 1966? How can a company release a truly definitive version of Speed Racer when they don't even know when it was made..?!",1051228800,196,3910,4.839580209895052
528517,4,6302993016,"It's great to finally see this released on DVD. The picture quality is great. The sound is mono, but in it's own way adds to the memories of the original series. I had a slight problem with the following:
1. No chapter selections within each episode. Once you select an episode you're stuck with using FF or going back to the main menu.
2. The end credits are not original. Nitpicking I know, but if you are going to give us the original, make it all original.
Having said the above, the stories are still fresh. It was fun watching and remembering sitting in front of the old black and white waiting for the next episode. Can't wait for the next volume.",1051142400,3,654,4.368852459016393
528518,3,6302993016,"...a quibble - you decide how minor.  The opening credits aren't original.  The original white ""Speed Racer"" title's been replaced by the newer red, trademarked logo.  That in itself isn't all that big a deal (unless, like me, you still think Star Wars oughtn't say ""Episode IV"" no matter what George Lucas says), but what is a big deal is that the whole credit sequence is obviously the time-compressed version from when the series aired (briefly) on MTV.  For those of us who were glued to the TV every day after school watching the show, the obvious ""rushing"" of the theme music is jarring - and given the format (DVD and not broadcast TV) inexcusable.",1051056000,10,655,4.6695652173913045
528519,5,6302993016,"I can't tell you if every episode of Speed Racer will be released as a box set sometime in the future, but there is no reason to wait!  This DVD is a GREAT start, and at a terrific price too.  The first 11 episodes will do for now.  (Hey - they could have given us just two or four episodes!)
The picture quality looks great, very bright colors, and the audio is fine too.  I didn't notice any soundtrack noise or picture scratches.  There is a ""play all episodes"" features which allows you several uninterrupted hours of Speed, or you can just play individual episodes.  I found the episode  menu easy to use.  It breaks down each complete episode on a separate page, two or three parts each, making it easy to select just the episode you want.
On the negative side, there are no USEFUL chapter markings.  I don't know that you really need them for a short episode, but the chapters that do exist are fairly nonsensical.  Some episodes have several chapters while others have none.  It appears the chapters actually correspond to the bonus material.  For example, track 1, chapter 4 is the same as track 3, (yet it is track 3 which is used for the bonus material.)  I can't understand why the main episodes (on track 1) need these chapter markings.  Perhaps those who understand such technical things can explain!
The bonus features are nice, but there is nothing that is particularly enlightening or new.  You can see the Mach 5's control panel in action via clips from the episodes, but you're going to see that anyway when you watch the episode!
I would like to have seen the 1996 Volkswagen commercial - it is mentioned but not included on the disc.  Likewise, biographies but no photos of the voice cast.  I guess you can check out the official 30th Anniversary Guide by Elizabeth Moran if you really want all the details.
I give this DVD 5 stars for the episodes and fine quality.  Buy it for the episodes, not the bonus materials.",1051056000,7,1938,4.5201149425287355
528520,5,6302993016,"Well, well, it's about time!  The BEST Japanese anime show of its time, and loved by every one of us who watched it religiously while growing up, ""Speed Racer"" FINALLY comes to DVD with the first 11 episodes!!

1. The Great Plan pt. 1
2. The Great Plan pt. 2
3. Challenge of the Masked Racer pt. 1
4. Challenge of the Masked Racer pt. 2
5. The Secret Engine pt. 1

11. The Most Dangerous Race pt. 3
""Mach V vs. Mach V"" is one of my very favorites, but this is a great start, and will buy every DVD ""Speed Racer"" set that comes out.  What a great addition to the collection of anyone who likes anime, nostalgic tv, and the dangerous adventures of Speed, Racer X, Pops, Trixie, Sparky, and of course Spritle and Chim Chim.  Some sites say there are 55 episodes total, from what I have checked there are 52, but either way can't wait to own them all!
Trivia: Do you know what the ""M"" on Speed's helmet and the ""G"" on his shirt were for?  I never did, until recently, but here's the DL: in the original Japanese version of the cartoon, titled ""Mach Go Go,"" Speed's name is Go Mifune - so the ""G"" stands for Go (his first name), the ""M"" on the helmet for Mifune (his last name).  Finally, THAT riddle from childhood solved!
GET THIS SET!  Unless they really mess up the transfer, this is the best DVD animation news in years!
