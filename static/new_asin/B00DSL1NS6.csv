8597212,3,B00DSL1NS6,"This is a nice dramatization of the French Revolution, but it only portrays what happened to a handful of characters, i.e. the most important actors (the King, Marie Antoinette, Desmoulins, Danton, Robespierre, a few others).  It gets the events right and the acting is quite good.  Unfortunately, if you want a wider portrait of the society, including some explanation of why things took the courses that they did, this mini-series has almost nothing to offer.

The story centers around the friendship of Desmoulins and Robespierre, who went to the same school.  Once they are grown, Danton joins them as things reach a boil while the French monarchy repeatedly proves itself incompetent.  Once overthrown, the revolutionaries take over, becoming progressively more violent and perhaps insane as the terror ensues for the sake of preserving the ""purity"" of the revolution.  Threats come from  outside and within.  The ending is abrupt, as  the Robespierre-dominated committee turns on itself as the excesses escalated.

I know the history somewhat and was disappointed there was not much historical depth.  What goes unexplained is how the new government structures functioned, what motivated the various actors, and the impact it had on the wider society and indeed on Europe.  Sure, aristocratic privilege was swept away, opening an era of equality and opportunity, but the viewer gets little more than that.  Instead, it is much more a melodrama.

Also, it is in French with subtitles in English only, though it was shot in both languages.  Please note that the format is Region 2, i.e. not American.

This is fun, but I can't say I learned anything from it.  Recommended with these reservations.",1465689600,5,1700,5.168498168498169
