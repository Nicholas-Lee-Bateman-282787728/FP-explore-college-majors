4164741,5,B003PNKM5W,"This is an unblinking journey into a taboo world. I found it fascinating and stereotype-shattering to hear the models speak for themselves about their motivations and experiences, and to see the artistic vision of the founder of insex.com. The dynamics of power and money at this porn site seem little different than any other workplace. Barbara and Anna have shone a bright light into a dark corner of our society without judgement. Congratulations to them and thanks for offering this to us. See it! I laughed and cringed, but come away with my preconceptions turned upside down.",1268352000,41,581,5.0
4164742,1,B003PNKM5W,"This movie totally missed its mark. Instead of talking about one of the biggest bondage sites on the internet, why not show what made them the biggest and most notorious. Show what acts allegedly made them a terrorist funding site. Instead the viewer is treated to boring verbal accounts of what happened. The actresses were already were paid for the scenes so why not use them to show exactly how far the site would go and what was deemed ""terrible"" by the government. Im so glad I waited for the price to drop. Its too bad I couldn't  have picked it up for free, that would still be to much for this stinker. From what little video scenes shown and I stress little , insex had some really creative and interesting scenes with the female actresses. Their bravery and courage is totally missed in verbal accounts from other people who were there filming or assisting. This isn't the fault of the actresses, camera personnel, assistants, or Brent the man in charge of insex, it is solely the fault of the director of this documentary. It might as well have been a book, no need for visual or audio presentation since there was very very little visual examples of the sites work. This is the perfect example of a swing and a miss. SAVE YOUR MONEY !!! Buy a book or better yet... just imagine the work of insex, you will not get any examples from this video...",1338854400,8,1357,4.493927125506073
4164743,5,B003PNKM5W,"Well this review is indeed like no other - while I'm living full-time as an transsexual female and living the fetish lifestyle in its professional capacity and personal capacity, and educating people while being known as Sarah Lovecraft (my preferred name whilst Christopher Dugger is my legal name), as an BDSM educator with a psychological and philisophy background, I found this video Graphic Sexual Horror to be amazing seeing I own it in my collection of horror flicks, romance and action flicks as well my own personal brand of videos I made of bondage art at its coolest and most kinkiest yet. I have found this documentary to be awesome and educational for the fetish lifestyler to truly know what started it all with the internet porn industry and what changed it all as well - Insex (now known as InsexArchives) rose and fell with pride and is by far the best damn website ever made - BDSM at its most rawest and purest form of art yet. I give this movie (which I have a copy of) 5 stars and enjoys doing so with pride seeing I'm from the BDSM community openly. I do hope people can watch this for years to come with an open mind and buy this - I highly recommend watching this for educational purposes for the BDSM community and the sexual alternative community. I also highly recommend this documentary to those just breaking into the BDSM filmmaking landscape and its industry if you wanna survive as an filmmaker and photographer or those wishing to model. This is superb for a educational video in some way for those who are kinky. As for those just hearing about it over the years, well enjoy - and try to have a strong gut without throwing up - this doc is disturbing indeed but I damn well loved it!",1328054400,4,1717,4.52411575562701
4164744,4,B003PNKM5W,"I wanted to give the film 5 stars but frankly as a documentary, it seems a little too in love with the subject to attain adequate distance - this subject certainly requires a wider context, especially if you wish to speak to anyone not already familiar with the subject.

This is about a very personal fetish/addiction/compulsion for viewing young women being elaborately bound, sexually humiliated and objectified, who also assume the appearance of being tortured - it has then been carefully funneled into a form of artistic expression. It's also about the women who almost need to be the subjects and focus of that expression. Fun fact about the internet is that as long as what you've expressed is authentic, someone out there is likely to share your passion.

What I found most satisfying after viewing this film is the very obvious ambivalence that the women participants feel about their ""enthusiastic"" and/or ""willing"" performances in the bdsm scenarios conjured up by Brent. With him, they access profound issues relating to early (childhood/pubescent?) trauma - they have found an echo in another person, one who implicitly promises to normalize the chaotic urges which are accessed, even while they remain un-normalize-able. It's a truth which flies under the radar in our desperate-to-be-glib-with-our-addictions culture. There is an obvious psycho-sexual dance between the dominant and submissive which has little to do with simple sex as it does with sexualized power and eroticized subordination.

I have always felt uncomfortable with kink.com (a popular descendant of insex.com) and it's family of sites at how they play interviews with performers after each performance. Performers speak with giddy joy at the delicious delights experienced by one or other aspect of the often brutal treatment that they'd received, ignoring the entire subject of HOW such outr experiences could be wished by (or to) anyone. This film doesn't address this aspect other than in passing, but it doesn't hide it either. I am very glad the film exists and hope it does provoke conversation about a very complicated part of our varied communal experience. I'm glad it doesn't attempt to cleanly explain away these profound urges, but a part of me wishes it tried.
A highly recommended documentary.",1325289600,9,2293,5.225543478260869
4164745,1,B003PNKM5W,"I was hoping for something titilating.  Did NOT get that with this DVD.  The interviews with the former models weren't interesting either.  BORING.  This is NOT porn, not instructional, not anything otehr than a sad waste of my time and money.  DO NOT BUY IT.",1295827200,9,259,4.666666666666667
4164746,3,B003PNKM5W,"I am deeply conflicted by this piece.

The good:
It offered a broad overview of Insex
Lots of access to PD and other important members of the production crew.
The cinematography is pretty good, in general.

The bad:

I found the editing in interviews jarring, and it always seemed that answers were being taken out of context, even if they were not.

The people interviewed (Claire Adams, Princess Donna, 1201, 912, Cyd Black, PD) were the ones who, for the most part, had positive experiences with the site. Those models who shot once, or did a partial shoot due to disliking the circumstances of production (see: the 'Canagirls' series of Insex videos), were not included in this documentary. Their perspective on the production would have given a strong counterpoint to what I took to be a positive-skew in the responses to Insex while also keeping with the director's wishes to refrain from using outside experts for commentary. Perhaps the anonymity inherent in doing pornography made finding these models impossible. The directors discuss this trouble in this interview: [...]. Although the citation escapes me, I also remember reading that pd had some input as to what footage of his interviews was shown. If this is the case, these omissions would further distort the reality of Brent Scott.

The inclusion of anonymous member statements, while understandable, also detracts from the credibility of the response to the film.

And, honestly, the imagery and video shown in this film was not sufficient to capture the horror of an actual Insex shoot. I admit there must be a balancing act to get the film carried by any sort of distributor, but I didn't want to vomit the same way I did when I watched the actual thing. Maybe I'm just getting jaded.",1289433600,11,1755,4.892255892255892
4164747,5,B003PNKM5W,"This is probably the most fascinating thing I ever downloaded.  I was actually planning on being stripped naked and tortured by PD, but I kept putting it off, so I was VERY disappointed when I heard that Bush and Cheney hassled insex to death.

THIS IS AN AMAZING VIDEO for anyone studying the internet academically, and is MANDATORY for insex fans.  You even hear about a phone call from a model's parents!

Ignore the title.  I think they made it that to catch people's attention.

PD is my hero, and he can torture and rape me anytime he wants!!!!!!!

Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some old insex vids, and some nubbin rubbin' to do...",1286928000,19,641,4.474137931034483
4164748,5,B003PNKM5W,"I can only agree with the other reviewers, like Amos Lassen.

This is a fascinating documentary giving insight into the driving forces behind the INSEX site and the people involved in it.
As always, different people have different interest. If you are turned away by some aspects of the human psyche, you should probably consider seeing another of my favorite films; ""Notting Hill"" instead.

If, however, you are intrigued by what human beings can not only endure but also enjoy in the right set of circumstances this is your film.",1286064000,16,531,4.888888888888889
4164749,5,B003PNKM5W,"If there are authors, Peter Acworth is certainly not one of them as he leads the main concurrent company against Insex and its offsprings. The only authors are Barbara Bell and Anna Lorentson.

I am quite sure that all of the 35000 previous members of Insex will find GSH very interesting and instructive.",1284854400,3,305,4.754716981132075
4164750,1,B003PNKM5W,"It is pointless to present an argument explaining or at least mitigating the so-called evils of Insex, when the very title of GRAPHIC SEXUAL HORROR seems ludicrous to anyone who has seen a number of complete Insex episodes. (And you have not seen one at all unless you have seen it all). (I never joined the site, but Insex episodes were once viral in the newsgroups and elsewhere, and I discovered the site by accident through browsing.)  I personally found the site rather boring, since bondage is of no real interest to me.  But now and then a girl without experience in making bondage videos would liven things up, as opposed to the veteran practitioners of bdsm who almost always were the ""tortured"" women on the site.

No, what I consider a true horror in the listing for this video is the use of the word PHENOMENA in the singular.  Shall we return to the ""torture"" of ninth grade spelling?  Nouns of Greek neuter origin which end in -ON in the SINGULAR, like CRITERION, become CRITERIA in the plural.  It is inexcusable for anyone entrusted with the writing of Amazon product descriptions to use an expression like A PHENOMENA.  It is precisely the same as writing A MEN.  ""I saw a men at the scene.  There were twelve of him.""  One rare PHENOMENON.  Twelve rare PHENOMENA.

Compared to this atrocity, the worst lashing or prodding on Insex was an actual contribution to civilization.  If I remember correctly, the chief ""torturer"" was a fairly articulate man.",1281139200,8,1468,4.709803921568628
4164751,4,B003PNKM5W,"Pornography on the Internet has arguably changed the sexual and moral landscape of people world-wide, perhaps more than the sexual revolution of the 1960s. It was also the first category of Internet business to make a profit. Insex was fabulously successful financially, and has spawned dozens of imitators. This film employs interviews and behind-the-scenes shots to document the pioneering, and perhaps the most misogynistic of the hard-core sado-masochism web sites. The film was made by people who have a long-standing relationship with the site and with those who ran it. It offers unique insights into one of the driving forces behind the beginning of a social-sexual change that continues today. This is invaluable for anyone who wants to understand the current evolution of sexual morals. This film is already controversial and difficult to acquire. See it while you can.",1279238400,26,879,5.330935251798561

8402040,4,B003PNKM5W,". . . about the heavier aspects of commercialized BDSM then this documentary is a place to begin. I was contemporary to this phenomenon yet missed out entirely due to being in the wrong place with the wrong people at the wrong time. Like many of us with a great many things we are limited to experiencing the world by DVD and we are hostages to the documentarians.

Fortunately these filmmakers allow much of the storytelling to be done by the people who participated in the actual events. We meet models and performers and by the end of the film we have come to know P.D. pretty well. He tells his story candidly, grief and all, and I finished the film feeling as though he had held little back.

Does the subject end up looking foolish? Few people do not end up looking foolish when they speak on camera about a deviant or esoteric interest and this video is no exception. I feel compelled to defend the people in this film against criticism then I remember, with the help of this film, that on a great many subjects it is better to avoid the circles of criticism all together.

As far as graphic footage of the actual Insex productions there is enough here to tease the curious. What was shown affirmed for me that what I was seeing on the internet was consensual and real. That alone is enough to change the way the world looks in imaginative and astonishing ways.",1501027200,,1368,4.442231075697211

8402043,2,B003PNKM5W,"What really stood out for me was the way PD's cruelty and sadism were presented for the most part as something ""different,"" but ""normal"" at some level. Anyone who has ever taken a course in Psycho-Sexual psychology can spot the pathology of these sickies right away. The main character clearly violated boundaries and went beyond ""safe words!"" How can a woman express the ""safe word,"" as described by one of the desperate victims when her mouth is gagged? This man, PD, should be behind bars, plain and simple. But even more curious to me was the nonsensical drivel Barbara, one of the directors, was expressing in the special feature trying to normalize and justify the whole enterprise, saying things like how this twisted behavior tells us all something about ourselves or the human condition. Bullshit! It's a portrait of a thoroughly evil worm, and the sick women who play his game, for money, mainly. Don't waste your money on this one.",1405123200,4,942,4.857142857142857
8402044,2,B003PNKM5W,"Reviews might be more objective if the reviewer was not compelled to fill this field in.  Even filling the field in is not enough, a minimum number of words is required.

8402046,1,B003PNKM5W,"I have taken classes regarding this subject, between sex and gender class, sexual behaviors, and psychology of women.  I graduated with a bachelors in psychology, my minor in sociology, and certificate in behavioral forensics.  What I have learned is that porn like this adds to the desensitization of violence and rape against women.  Sure, the females say they are okay with it and it isn't all real but the majority of those who watch it don't know this at first glance.  The women could be just desperate for money and like women in music videos that are masogynistic do it for the money. I went into this with a clear mind since I watch a lot of horror movies where women are killed in brutal ways.  But I know these movies are fake. These internets videos confuse people, especially young males.  I say take this documentary with a grain of salt.  It's not a good thing overall and no matter what the women say doesn't mean its okay.  I do not say I'm anti s and m but this is one step too far.  The one guy said he didn't know if it was real at first and that he thought it was like a serial killer - well thats how it happens. Look up BTK.  I watch a lot of documentaries and always go in with no bias but this I just couldn't accept.  This is too far and there is too much violence already and this is completely unnecessary.  Please this may be interesting but this is sick. One thing I 've learned is that hard core porn leads to violence against women.",1355875200,6,1464,4.283636363636363
