3559594,5,B001F12J02,"I just received this collection of Gregory Peck films and while I already owned one of them(To Kill a Mockingbird) already, I just had to get this collection. Arabesque is one of my all time favorites and I have been waiting for years for it to be released on DVD. Very good transfer to DVD and well worth the cost.",1228780800,7,315,4.266666666666667
3559595,5,B001F12J02,"If you're a DVD movie collector and don't already have TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD or CAPE FEAR, this is a must, because it also contains one of the most stylish Bond-era thrillers ever made, ARABESQUE (in which Sophia Loren appears at her most stunningly beautiful), and three interesting and rarely shown films.  The inclusion of the three lesser-known movies makes this a special and unpredictable collection.

TO KILL A MOCKINGBIRD is a true classic, with fine acting, gorgeous black and white photography and a compelling musical score.  Most of all, it's a fascinating and well-written story.  CAPE FEAR may not approach MOCKINGBIRD as a classic, but it's certainly a minor one; much better than the gratuitously violent remake.  This is my second favorite Robert Mitchum performance, behind his other great villainous role in NIGHT OF THE HUNTER.  Gregory Peck is perfect as the guy trying desperately to protect his family.  His wife, played by Polly Bergan, a good, too. it's too bad she made so few movies of any note, because she's not only attractive, but a superb actress.

ARABESQUE is one of my all-time personal favorite thrillers.  It's been unavailable in the United States for a long time, and it's good to finally have it on DVD, and it's a gorgeous print, to boot.  Sophia Loren's first entrance in the film, in a stylish, black evening ensemble, ranks with the most sexy moments in her career, and all she does is walk into the room!  Her character is fun, because it's not clear for some time into ARABESQUE if she's with or against Mr. Peck's harried college professor.  He's on the trail of a coded heiroglyph containing vital information regarding an assassination plot.  This is one of Peck's looser, more humorous performances, too, as he seems to be having great fun, being chased by thugs and trying to crack the code, and he's got such good chemistry with Loren.  His drug induced bicycle ride through oncoming traffic on a rainy night is a memorable scene, and SO sixties!  The stylish art direction, psychedelic photographic effects and catchy score by Henry Mancini combine to make this a worthy followup to Donen's CHARADE, although many prefer the previous film. I find ARABESQUE equally enjoyable, with its flashes of witty humor and tongue-in-cheek political intrigue.  It's all pretty fake, like a paste jewel, but it sparkles just the same, as if it were a real diamond, beginning with the wonderful opening theme and 007 Movie-like titles, designed by famous titlemeister, Maurice Binder.

Of the three other movies in this boxed set, I like CAPTAIN NEWMAN, M.D. the best.  I don't know how I ever managed to miss this one.  It's a fascinating, if somewhat dated, study of a psychiatric facility's military doctor treating traumatic mental injuries in young soldiers during war.  Peck is very good in this, but the ones who steal the show are Tony Curtis as a wisecracking intern, Bobby Darin as a guilt-ridden airman recovering from a tragic plane crash that killed his buddy, and most of all, Eddie Albert (!) as an army colonel suffering from violent delusions.  This could easily be Albert's finest moment.  Angie Dickinson is the only weak link, miscast as an army nurse, although her acting does contain a few screen moments that feel emotionally genuine.  Otherwise, she fails to make much of an impression (on me, anyway).

The other two films are entertaining fun, if not A-List.  MIRAGE is a so-so mystery lifted above its routine script by excellent performances by Peck as a man with amnesia, and Diane Baker as another ambiguous female (is she with him or against him)?

The last movie is an okay swashbuckler with Ann Blyth as the love interest.  She's pretty dreadful, and the costumes are way over the top, Hollywood travesties of historical research.  Redder lips were never seen, and Blyth's odd mouth is all one can look at in some scenes.  But Peck is fine as a barely moral seafaring rogue, and Anthony Quinn is great fun as his unabashedly immoral foe.  This film is worth seeing once, but it's tied with MIRAGE as the weakest of the six movies here.

Because three of these movies are so good, and one of those is otherwise hard to get, I give this Five Stars, considering the other three films as icing on the cake.",1226707200,34,4274,4.829670329670329
3559596,4,B001F12J02,"I'd like to comment of three of the lesser known films in this set:
1. Captain Newman, M.D. - a wonderful W.W.II comedy/drama with a great supporting cast including Tony Curtis, Angie Dickinson, Eddie Albert, Larry Storch, James Gregory, Robert Duvall and in his academy-award nominated supporting role: Bobby Darin.  One of my favorite films of the 1960s.
2. Mirage-a suspenseful black and white film-noir, filmed on location in New York co-starring the very attractive Diane Baker and Walter Matthau.
3. Arabesque-suspense thriller co-starring Sophia Loren.  Directed by Stanley Donen, this was an attempt to replicate the success of Donen's previous thriller ""Charade.""  While not as good as that classic, it is still good fun with a great score by Henry Mancini.
I can't wait to see these three films again.",1225843200,48,811,5.175572519083969
3559597,5,B001F12J02,"A couple of these I have been waiting for.

""The World in His Arms"" (1952) stars Gregory Peck as a seal hunter enlisted by Russian countess Ann Blyth to take her to Alaska so she can evade marrying a Russian diplomat. When Blyth is kidnapped, Peck and rival Anthony Quinn race to save her.
Sig Rumann, John McIntire co-star. Peck portrays WWII military psychiatrist ""Captain Newman, M.D."" (1963) in this acclaimed comedy-drama, administering help to the battle fatigued. With Tony Curtis, Angie Dickinson, and Robert Duvall.
Peck is an amnesia victim whose attempts to discover his identity may also turn up a murder plot, in the gripping ""Mirage"" (1965). With Diane Baker, Walter Matthau.
In director Stanley Donen's James-Bondian thriller ""Arabesque"" (1966), Peck plays a language professor hired to decipher a secret code, scrambling to outwit hired gunmen and save the life of an Arab prime minister. Sophia Loren, George Coulouris co-star.
Seven-disc set also includes the Special Edition of ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" and ""Cape Fear"" (1962). 10 3/4 hrs. total. Standard/Widescreen (Enhanced); Soundtracks: English, French; Subtitles: English (SDH), French, Spanish.",1220313600,15,1168,5.417582417582418

3559659,5,B001F12J02,"Even though I haven't seen everything yet, what can I say? I've always loved Gregory Peck. These films are a great collection. I wasn't sure I'd ever seen Mirage before, but I loved it. When Peck sees a horrific event, how he portrays the hero getting what used to be called ""hysterical"" amnesia - wow! Powerful. To Kill a Mockingbird is one of my all-time favorites. The World in His Arms is Ok, and even though I wouldn't call it spectacular, it was fun. I have a hard time watching Cape Fear, because Robert Mitchum is so creepy in it. I haven't seen the bonus material yet, but I'm looking forward to it, when I get some time.",1392854400,,630,4.3474576271186445
3559660,5,B001F12J02,"Thus far I have only watched one of the five movies in this set, Captain Newman, M.D., and for me it alone was worth the price of the set. My search for this movie was initiated when I saw Gregory Peck's son interviewed on TV and heard of this work with veterans who have PTSD. When he was asked about what led him to that work, he referred to this movie in which his father played the role of Captain Newman. Apparently, during WWII Capt. Newman was the medical doctor who helped achieve some recognition of the need for medical treatment for all service men (or women) who develop PTSD. As a former university professor of criminal justice, several times I interacted with former or current military persons who suffered from this illness. I also saw how university administrators, professors, and staff can and do help address their needs. Note that PTSD also affects military personnel (females & males) or civilians who experience rape or other types of violations of human dignity and rights. In this vein the film, The Invisible War, is an excellent supplement to Capt. Newman. The Invisible War focuses on the continuing failure of our military and government to exercise adequate justice  and care for victims who are raped or sexually harassed while in the military. The film, North Country, is another powerful, real world example of how rape and sexual harassment on the (civilian) job can produce PTSD.",1392681600,2,1415,4.823045267489712

  You know you have quality when you have films that have survived this long, and they still stand up and stand out as great film! I know you have to pick and choose what films go into a set like this and, great choices!
  I would recommend adding The Big Country to this set to make it perfect, however, you can just do what I did and order that movie as well.
  These are movies that prove what makes a great movie! Todays film makers could learn a thing or two from these films! No I'm not saying there aren't any great films today, or that there weren't a bunch of stinkers back then, but when you have these as great examples, use them!

Two of the films were of especial interest - MIRAGE, a fine thriller, which he made with the excellent Diane Baker, and THE WORLD IN HIS ARMS, a rousing Raoul Walsh actioner (beautifully photographed in Technicolor) in which he co-starred with the lovely Ann Blyth.  (Question - why has Universal never released these two movies in the UK, either on video or DVD?)  The other three pictures all repay watching, CAPE FEAR, much superior to the Scorsese remake, CAPTAIN NEWMAN MD, with Tony Curtis and the delectable Angie Dickinson, and ARABESQUE, a felicitous teaming of Peck and Sophia Loren.

3559684,5,B001F12J02,"Gregory Peck is an actor who has always been at the top of the Hollywood ""A List"" icon charts.  His is a name that is instantly recognized by everyone who has ever had an interest in film history as one of the best actors the Studio System ever produced.  I have always been a fan, ever since I first saw his movies in the theaters and on TV in the 1950s and 1960s, and one would think that his films would be among those in my classic film collection, but they are not.  I admit that my admiration for his work is based on only a few selected films I have seen over the years, ""Captain Newman, M.D."", ""Twelve O'Clock High"", ""How the West Was Won"", ""Arabesque"", ""The Omen"" and ""MacArthur"" among them.

Yet I also admit that I didn't purchase this boxed set collection of his films because of my admiration for Peck's film work.  I was looking to purchase one specific film of his, ""Captain Newman, M.D."", a movie I had seen in the theaters during my formative teen years in the early 1960s, but the single DVD of this movie was $32 and I decided it would be wiser to spend six dollars more to buy it in this boxed set of six films rather than to pay the $32 asking price for the one DVD alone.

What a hidden treasure I uncovered for those extra six dollars!  I watched ""Captain Newman, M.D."" first, of course, and enjoyed it just as much as I did when I first saw it in 1963, but then I began watching the others in the set and I realized what I had been missing all these years.  The classic ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" is one of his films I've always wanted to see but admit I have never watched and I now realize why it is a classic!  I've viewed it three times, now, and I can't get enough of it!  ""Cape Fear"" is such a powerful film, and Robert Mitchum such a perfect villian, that I wonder to myself why I have never taken the time to sit down and see it in its entirety before.  ""Arabesque"" and ""Mirage"" are two spy genre films I did see in the theater during my college years and it was good seeing them again (both are very entertaining in a ""007"" kind of way), but ""The World in His Arms"" is one of those cut and dried adventure films from the early 1950s that are best left to Saturday Matinee goers who have nothing better to do.  I did enjoy each and every one of these films, though, and for less than $7.00 per DVD (shipping included) I can't say that I've ever spent my money more wisely for a boxed set of films.

I thoroughly recommend this Gregory Peck Film Collection to anyone who loves quality classic films.",1271203200,3,2527,4.174897119341564
