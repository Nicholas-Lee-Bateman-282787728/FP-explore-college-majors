4854793,5,B005OUJRKK,"I knew nothing about the magic world when I watched Make Believe - wasn't really even interested in magic. There were two things that made me love the movie: 1) the magic is kind of a side bar. Really this is about teenagers finding their way. figuring life out. working hard for something. dealing with the real world. the film captures each of the main figures facing different problems, different emotions and we watch them process and grow. 2) the magic is cool. i admit, i was fascinated by the magic itself, in spite of myself. sometimes what they do seems way beyond the properties of physics. its awesome.

I've watched the movie with my nieces and nephews (ages 7-12) and they all loved it. A fascination with magic ensued, and the extras teaching a few magic tricks were a great bonus. Fun all around, for the whole family.",1351468800,,833,4.590604026845638
4854794,4,B005OUJRKK,"I envy these kids. Not because they can perform magic, but because each one has found a skill which they want to develop and feel a passion and commitment for. I don't think a person would have the energy and drive to keep perfecting their magic skills unless they really felt something for it. I thought the Japanese teen was the most amazing - he taught himself how to perform magic with very little resources compared to the other teen. I liked how he incorporated nature into his magic, and practiced for hours. What talent!",1350950400,2,528,4.568421052631579
4854795,5,B005OUJRKK,"I'm a bystander when it comes to magic. I've loved being the audience and not the magician. However, this is not a movie just for magicians and those interested in becoming more involved in magic. It is entertaining for all.

Right at the start, I was amazed to see the skill level of this group of teens. They were true professionals right off the bat. They took their 'job' seriously and it was a huge driving force in their lives for many years.

I was so pleased to 'meet' this select group of amazing kids. Each had a unique story, each had struggles and issues to overcome but each had the same goal of being crowned Teen World Champion in Las Vegas. But this documentary was not just about getting to the competition and who won but traveling the globe to bring in participants from Japan, Africa and many points throughout America.

The participants, their families and their journeys are all unique as were their acts. Without giving a spoiler, I will say that I was crying at the end when the winner was announced. I felt like I was in it with these great kids and they were all in it with each other as well - supportive, and good friends to each other.

Make Believe gives you a small glimpse into the skill and time it takes to make the art of prestidigitation look like anyone could do it.

The movie ends with a 6 month follow-up on the teens that were featured and has some added bonus material on each teen as well as tips and tutorials for performing a few magic tricks. It should be noted that there are a couple of places that minor swears are uttered and there is a slang word used (for 'chest') that made it a little uncomfortable for me to hear in front of my 8 year old - but don't let these be a reasons to not watch the movie - it's all part the documentary feel.

I was provided a copy of the movie by Passion River Films for an honest review.",1350777600,,1870,4.268361581920904
4854796,5,B005OUJRKK,"""Make Believe"" is a documentary following six young magicians as they compete in a teen magic competition pitting the best young magicians from around the world. Three of them are from the United States, one from Japan, and two from Africa. It was heartwarming. In fact, I was a little teary eyed when the winner was announced and the one I was rooting for won. I even googled him, because I'd love to see the kid on tour.

My children were captivated, although I admit to cringing with the occasional crude language. They noticed it less than I did. The DVD includes a tutorial section on mostly card tricks that were basic but pretty ingenious. The kids immediately began trying to perform them. This film may have just inspired some budding artists. My husband and I can't get away from them trying to show us competing card tricks.

Overall, the children both enthusiastically rate this documentary five stars. I thought it was excellent. Very well done.

4854797,5,B005OUJRKK,"it's rare to find a documentary in which pretty much every single character seems an underdog. so thank goodness tweel made a film about teen magicians. now granted, his underdogs run the gamut, from oddly snotty to hopelessly lonely to totally wicked awesome. but they all personify, in a myriad of different ways, the awkward high school experience common to all of us, everywhere, globally. the competition maintains the pace, and the magic itself is often quite spectacular. but the real magic is mined in meeting social loners who find a perfect, cozy little niche - on stage.",1348012800,2,581,4.938775510204081
4854798,5,B005OUJRKK,"This movie chronologues the progress of several young magicians from the United States, Japan and South Africa that come to Las Vegas to compete in a contest.  Footage for many of the contestants goes way back into their past and shows a commitment by all to win over judges and then most importantly their audience so they can win first place.  If one can identify with the characters as they're presented one can feel anxiety, pressure, concern and then at last the thrill of victory or the agony of defeat.  In this case it seems to convey that only the winner will succeed as a magician; however, it also shows a non-winner willing to devote a major part of his life toward a skill that may be ultimately non-gratifying. There are lots of ""good"" magicians around; however, the number who remain in people's memories is very small.  For aspiring performers it should provide a clear picture  of what is required to be among the best magicians.  They can then decide if they want to pursue this as a career.",1318204800,,1009,4.608938547486034
4854834,5,B005OUJRKK,"A really fantastic documentary about the journey of a handful of children looking to make it big in the super competitive world of magic. The movie not only shows you some really cool ""behind the scenes"" type magic, but it makes you cheer these kids' successes and really feel their failures. An absolutely amazing flick.

The only reason I'm giving it five stars is because Amazon doesn't let me give it six.",1351728000,,409,4.680555555555555
4854835,5,B005OUJRKK,"This movie is a masterful piece of film. The director sculpts a story of the coming of age, the right of passage if you will, through this small group of would be magicians. A must see.",1351728000,,185,4.166666666666667
4854836,5,B005OUJRKK,"Our kids fell in love with magic when they saw this movie, and as parents, we loved watching it.  It's a great story about growing up and teens - such a great gift for the holiday time!!",1351641600,,186,4.027027027027027

4854838,5,B005OUJRKK,"""Magic"" is the medium indeed...but a different kind of magic is created on the screen as each young magician is transformed before your eyes.  This is truly a wonderful and heartwarming story for ages 10 - 100.
The movie is about so much more that magic, but I gained a whole new appreciation and respect for this craft. I was blown away by the incredible amount of time spent and skill needed to master a ""trick"". The young people are so intelligent, dedicated and passionate.  You can't help but love and admire each teen and pull for them as well as their families.
You can't go wrong with this film.",1351555200,,603,4.472727272727273
4854839,5,B005OUJRKK,"I am a fan of documentaries already but it is so nice when you see a movie that you can LITERALLY recommend to every person you know!  It is so smart and clever, and incredibly sweet.  The directors gentle hand in guiding it's audience is an exceptional skill.  Fun for the entire family and for movie buffs who appreciate a well crafted film.",1351555200,,343,4.412698412698413
4854840,5,B005OUJRKK,I absolutely loved this story and following these kids through their highs and lows - I loved that the kids had found something they were so passionate about - I think having felt this deep passion early on in their lives will help to keep them inspired and passionate throughout their lives - I watched it several times and cried everytime -,1351555200,,342,4.532258064516129
4854841,5,B005OUJRKK,"Once again J. Clay Tweel makes me cry.  In a good way.  As with King of Kong Fistful of Quarters, you can't help falling in love with these characters as they reach for the stars.  The story flows nicely following an international bunch of teen magicians and you start to care deeply even if you're not interested in the documentary topic itself.  But, it's MAGIC, so of course you're interested in the documentary topic.  This is a fun movie that made me chuckle and evoked a few tears and I liked it.",1351555200,,502,4.413043478260869
4854842,5,B005OUJRKK,"""Make Believe"" was thoroughly enjoyable on several levels.  First, the peek into the world of magic was fascinating.  Second, seeing how the commitment to excellence impacted the lives of these teens from all over the world, offered an insight into the transformative power of dedication to achievement.  Third, it revealed that magic, like any worthwehile endeavor comes from hard work as welll as inspiration.  Clay Tweel's creative approach to following such different and engaging young people from their homes along the path of competition to the pinacle of their art is engaging nost admirable.  By the end of the film, it is impossible not to be caught up in the tension, thrill and wonder of the competition.",1351555200,,716,5.085470085470085
4854843,5,B005OUJRKK,"this movie's a sure hit for any audience - kids, teens, adults, families. as previous reviewers have noted, this is much more than just a film about magic - although the magic is indeed incredible! this is a great film to watch and even better to give as gifts because this movie truly has universal appeal.",1351468800,,307,4.5

8481959,5,B005OUJRKK,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

I have loved magic since I was a child. I would watch the old clips of Houdini wondering how he was able to escape from what I believed to be certain death! David Copperfield, Doug Henning, Penn & Teller, Lance Burton, and even Harry Anderson (the judge from TV show Night Court). I loved watching them all. I had no idea there was even a magic competition for young magicians.

I really like how this documentary puts the young people front and center. The cast themselves mention all the magicians I knew and a few I had never even heard of. The teens are all wonderful and very dedicated. The personalities covered a wide emotional spectrum. The kids are shy, and introverted, but they are also confident, and hilarious. All of the emotions are right there at the surface (these are teens after all). The filmmakers went further though, and showed the true depth of feeling each person has. They all truly love what they are doing.

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++ +++++++++Small spoiler here!! Skip it!!! WATCH OUT!! +++++++++ +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

There was only one off-putting person/moment in this movie. I believe it is worth mentioning though. There is an older woman magician. Supposedly she was great back in the day. I didn't know who she was. She started off great, and seemed to be taking a couple of the performers under her wing. Then her attitude and input turned very coarse and inappropriate when speaking with the only girl performer. She advised the young girl, who I believe was 16 or 17 years old, to use her body to be more famous. The older woman used crude and very offensive language with her ""advice"". Did not like her at all.

++++++++++++++++++End of Spoiler+++++++++++++++++++

Overall, the entire movie is very real and touching. The film shows what can be done with a documentary using an honest approach with no agenda. If you love magic, or your children do, watch this movie. It shows how hard work, dedication, and practice truly have a huge impact. Even if you aren't a big fan of magic, I bet you will still find the heart of this movie to be genuine, and universal.",1469836800,,2231,4.983870967741935
8481960,5,B005OUJRKK,"Thoroughly enjoyed.  Great story, great pacing, fantastic characters.  Felt vested in the characters' success.  Also, appreciated the recap at the end of the film.",1411603200,,163,5.708333333333333
8481961,4,B005OUJRKK,This is just a documentary of Krystyn Lambert's increasing decent into madness. The blank emotionless stares she gives makes me worried for anyone who tries to compete with her.,1405814400,,177,5.137931034482759
8481962,5,B005OUJRKK,My son is really into magic and we were made aware of this film by people in his magic club. We downloaded it to my Kindle Fire HD and then connected it to our TV.  HD format and quality of the film was what we hoped for. The film gave you a good idea on just how much time these people spend in perfecting their skills. It also gives you insight into the the competition side of performing a magic act if that is the way you want to go.,1359244800,,437,3.8555555555555556
8481963,5,B005OUJRKK,"Such a great movie!  Truly inspirational.  Shows how much passion some teenagers can have and the result of their hard work and determination.  This should be a movie watched by all young children to motivate them to pursue their passions, no matter the obstacles.

I loved how the director/writer chose/focused on such diverse individuals.  From affluent teenagers to poor teenagers all over the world.",1357948800,,403,5.234375
8481964,5,B005OUJRKK,"Obsessions in youngsters aren't necessarily bad as MAKE BELIEVE proves. On the surface this is a film about a competition for magicians of a young age and as such it explores the fascination and need and the other painful aspects of adolescence that center on being noticed, accepted and to feel OK about themselves. That is what make this films work and why it has become an inspiration for so many young people who are trying to follow their dream - a trait too many of their subsequent generation have forsaken or found inappropriate in the dog eat dog world of making a living.

Along the say in this beautifully paced docudrama we meet six contestants who will vie for the title of Teen World Champion in the World Magic Seminar in Las Vegas. Each of these contestants captures our hearts and through their penetrating focus on preparing for the competition and the notice from the public, from their families and from each other weaves a story that revisits what it is like to dream - in the vulnerable time of adolescence. This is not a peek into American teens' lives - this is a journey around the globe where we meet teens form many countries, and the disparities and similarities among these youngsters who are likely inclined in the same field is a lesson in sociology and psychology and coming of age.  It has moments of sadness, moments of anxiety and moments of humor all blended into a surprisingly entertaining and heartwarming film.  Grady Harp, December 12",1356220800,2,1475,4.709302325581396
8481965,4,B005OUJRKK,"""Make Believe"" is a surprisingly entertaining documentary covering the quest of young magicians competing to become the Teen World Champion at the World Magic Seminar in Las Vegas. This is a look at some of the most talented of the contestants before, during, and after the competition. There is a subculture for almost everything and this documentary shows that the magician culture is very much alive and active.

I enjoyed seeing how the kids balanced their daily lives with the demands of preparing for the competition. These are very dedicated and determined performers that literally spend hours a day practicing and refining their acts. The filmmakers did a great job capturing the emotions and sense of anticipation in the days leading up to the event.

It is easy to forget how young these magicians are when you see the first rate magic they perform. It is also easy to forget that they are competing for a title that will help propel their magic careers and land them on TV specials if they win. Which leads to the only part of the documentary that I found somewhat distasteful, it involves an older woman ""has-been"" that encourages a girl contestant to flaunt her body and uses a crude term that has no place in what would have otherwise been a kid friendly family video.

The ""Extra Features"" include a deeper look at the young contestants lives and a collection of instructional magic tricks, ranging from simple to amazingly difficult, that you can learn by watching the video.

This was an entertaining and informative look into a world I didn't even know existed.

8481966,5,B005OUJRKK,"Fantastic Documentary.  The kids in the film provide imaginative onstage magic that has you rooting for each of them, but the real magic comes from the moments when they discover things about themselves and connect with each other.  Everyone needs some magic in their lives and this film comes through in a way that will touch you.  Can't wait to see what is next from director Tweel!",1352073600,,384,4.701492537313433
8481967,5,B005OUJRKK,"This is a great film that I've watched several times.  I think it really captures young people's dreams at becoming 'the best' at something.  Not everyone can be the best, but it's moving to see how hard they work, and what they get even when they don't 'win it all.'  Another aspect of this is the international flavor of the contestants.  Ever since seeing this I've followed on Facebook one of the contestants (I won't divulge which one so as not to hint at the ending, but it's amazing to see this contestant's success).  Kids of all ages can watch and enjoy this, especially if they are interested in magic.  Definitely a great documentary for the whole family.",1351987200,,666,4.601694915254237
