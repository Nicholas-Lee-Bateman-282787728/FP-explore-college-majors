4992194,3,B006IXRI2G,"The movie is primarily a spoof of ""Troy"" but tosses in some other film bits for good measure. Will Sasso stars as the blue collar Awesomest Maximus, legendary general of Troy. His wife, Hottessa (Kristanna Loken) is the princess. Her brother is named Orlando instead of Paris (Gary Lundy) who is gay. He absconds with Ellen of Troy (Sophia Monk) in order to make the King of Greece jealous. Ian Ziering plays Testiclees in the manner of Brad Pitt. His incestuous mother looks like Angelina Jolie from ""Alexander."" I think you get the idea of the satire.

When the movie is not spoofing other movies, the humor is overly sexual. When you divide National Lampoon films into classics and not so classics, this falls below the line. If you enjoyed the film ""Your Highness"" you might try this one too.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (background strippers mostly, no stars)",1331942400,10,857,4.783783783783784

4992220,5,B006IXRI2G,Netflix took this off their streaming video.  I had to have it as we watch it and laugh a few times every year.  And the sound and picture are best in blu-ray anyway.  Could be ny favorite film!,1419120000,,194,4.052631578947368
4992221,5,B006IXRI2G,Excellent satire,1416441600,,16,7.5
4992222,5,B006IXRI2G,This was a funny movie with great potential but it overused foul language and crass humor. It seemed they tried to put as much of both in as they could for no purpose but to use it. You could edit the majority of it out and it wouldn't affect the move one bit.  It was a fun watch but the I was taken out of it often by those two elements. Over all worth a watch. I don't know about a second though.,1416355200,,399,3.8072289156626504
4992223,1,B006IXRI2G,"this is a shockingly bad movie... the ONLY thing that kept me watching, wasn't hope it would get to a merely kind of bad level, but the semi regular nudity.  This is like  a softcore porn flick that has incredibly low production value and an  intentionally bad script linking bits of semi nude and beautiful women.  Will Sasso is wasted in this mess.... I can't recommend to anybody.... this truly gets my lowest rating.",1414972800,,420,4.635135135135135
4992224,1,B006IXRI2G,"Remember when a movie with ""National Lampoon"" in the title meant
Creative satire, well written dialogue, and clever double entendre?

This is NOT one of those movies.

The movie is bad, Awsomest bad.  It is surprising that a script that is so poorly done would ever make it to the point of being filmed.

I am also surprised that Will Sasso and Rip Torn would be associated with a big steaming pile of c--- like this.
Fans of these actors will be particularly disappointed.",1388188800,,473,4.595238095238095

4992226,5,B006IXRI2G,This movie puts forth the same humor that originally made national lampoon so great in the beginning. I can't even look at the Dvd case without giggling.,1374192000,2,153,4.703703703703703

4992228,5,B006IXRI2G,The main reason I got this movie is because of the main star of the cover he is always funny on mad tv and knew he would be just as good on here and he was. this is not for kids so put them to bed when watching this and get a great laugh,1355529600,,237,3.4074074074074074
4992249,5,B006IXRI2G,"if you are a lover of parodies and you see this title your probably thinking oh great another spoof about warriors and greece, but awesomest maximus by far rocks the others. it is so original and its produced by national lampoons rather than leslie neilson so you totally get a new feeling to it, also unlike other spoofs this has no advertising no annoying repeating things or stupid lame jokes made by the characters, i watch this movie over and over again. i am very suprised it was not advertised  as much as other spoofs are so you have to get lucky to find it. i totally recommend this film for anyone and ignore the ppl that gave it low ratings cuz they don't know a good comedy when they see one. its a BUY you won't regret. YA DAWG!!!!",1351296000,4,744,4.314285714285714
4992250,3,B006IXRI2G,"Having seen some of the many movies that have National Lampoon above the title, it's refreshing to see one that actually has some funny moments.  It's inconsistent in delivery, exceptionally crude (duh!), with language, topless girls (that's a good thing!), and is far from the worst. A parody of modern sword-and-sandal A-movies like Troy, Alexander, 300, and Gladiator, it throws out as many gags as it can.  Much better than the similar sword-and-sandals parodies. I was surprised.",1346976000,,484,5.2727272727272725
4992251,3,B006IXRI2G,"Bottom line, this is a gutter humor movie.  It's not my thing. I'm not a prude by any means, but gutter humor is for the simple minded. That being said, I didn't know this before I watched it. This movie for the most part was down right gut busting laugh out loud hillarious, but went too far in some cases, and a lot of the crude scenes were completely unnecessary, and didn't add to the movie at all. Don't watch with the wife, and definitely don't watch with the kids if they are under 18. In fact, just don't watch with your kids or family at any age. The title of my review says it all.  This movie is a guilty pleasure best enjoyed alone.",1343952000,,644,4.144
4992252,4,B006IXRI2G,"This movie is awesome until the last 30 seconds completely screw it up. If you want my advise the second it fades out hit stop and never watch the last bit, it ruins the experience.",1339632000,,181,4.2
4992253,4,B006IXRI2G,"I was high when I saw this on TV a few days ago. I'm not sure if I overanalyzed the movie because I was high, but it seemed like every single scene took the dialogue way past the point of relevance. Each character would go off into a rant about something that otherwise might seem stupid, but I thorougly enjoyed the movie being in the state of mind that I was in. Kind of like ""House Of Payne"", it's stupid unless you're under the influence of something. I loved MadTV, so it was nice to see Will Sasso. This is much better than the 3 Stooges movie he was just in if you're wondering.

I recommend watching it, but don't expect much.",1338076800,2,634,4.19672131147541

4992256,4,B006IXRI2G,"I bought this movie because I'm a huge (no pun intended) Tony Cox fan.  And it was worth it just for him.  He can deliver a line like no other and because ""Revenge of the Nerds"" was one of my favorite films when I was a young'un.  Oh, and that ending ""torture"" scene. One for the ages.  If you're looking for a flick to watch when you just want some good fun, pick it up.",1333843200,,371,3.9066666666666667
4992257,2,B006IXRI2G,"I bought this because Kristanna Loken was in it...simple as that. Silly and at times, goofy low budget spoofing of the genre has its moments, but overall, not for me.",1333324800,,166,4.566666666666666
4992258,1,B006IXRI2G,"There was a time when the name National Lampoon meant something. It was the breeding ground for a large number of comics and writers, first with the initial magazine and later with its radio and road shows. When it took the dive into feature films it splashed big time with ANIMAL HOUSE and VACATION. But that all changed. Each item connected with the original name died out. The last to go it seems is their films. Every time a new movie comes out with the name National Lampoon attached to it I cringe just a little. And they never disappoint me: they're always bad.

The latest to have the words National Lampoon attached to it is NATIONAL LAMPOON'S THE LEGEND OF AWESOMEST MAXIMUS. The story revolves around...well never mind. It doesn't matter. This movie was so bad it would be a disservice to waste time talking about it in depth. Suffice to say its a broad parody of the sword and sandal films made over the past 20 years, everything from BRAVEHEART to 300.

The jokes told here are the type that you might have told when you were reaching puberty and the subject of oral sex and naked boobs was enough to send you into a laughing frenzy. Where as National Lampoon had a subtle sense of humor to it, a bit of class even when discussing such things, this one goes for playground mentality and achieves it quite well. If only those on playgrounds were the intended audience this movie would have made a mint. Instead it went straight to DVD and doesn't even deserve that.

Note to Will Sasso: if you continue playing a bumbling idiot in all of your roles you will play nothing but a bumbling idiot forever. So far that seems to be the case. Move on.

I honestly tried watching this movie but had a difficult time getting past the first 15 minutes it was that insulting. There is a place for crude humor, for gross out jokes and for puns based around sexual acts. That is when it is done with style. This movie has no style whatsoever.

I knew I was in trouble when watching the trailer I kept seeing National Lampoon saying their own movie was good and different actors in the cast commenting on how good the other actors were in the printed blurbs on the screen. Anyone associated with this piece of crap owes each and every filmgoer a personal apology for wasting time, space and the money it took to make it. With so many lost scripts held hostage and placed on shelves in Hollywood perhaps the person who deserves to be horsewhipped the most is the one who thought this movie was the one worth investing in. I have images floating in my head at the moment of those classic horror films where angry townspeople are carrying torches in search of the monster. We need to do this and find the person responsible for this so called movie. It truly is that bad.

Just so we're clear, the only reason I gave this movie 1 star was because zero or negative stars are not an option.",1332201600,8,2882,4.428301886792453
8498994,3,B006IXRI2G,This movie had such great potential but it had way too many naked women which made it feel like a porno and not a comedy. Take a page from Walk Hard if you're going to add nudity to comedy and show both in funny ways.,1513814400,,217,3.8444444444444446
