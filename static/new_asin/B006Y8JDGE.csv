8506385,4,B006Y8JDGE,"The ""Prisoner Cell Block H"" series is a brilliant examination of how humans organize society.  It is worth half a dozen courses in political science - and students of history and political science will benefit greatly from watching it.  It belongs on a shelf with Aristotle, Machiavelli, Marx, Nietzsche, Durkheim, Etzioni, Weber, and Wyndham Lewis's ""The Art of Being Ruled.""
  I live in Auburn, NY, site of one of the world's most famous prisons (first was built in 1810, where the world's first electrocution was performed in 1890).  The depiction of prisoners, prison officers, and ""the games people play"" is quite realistic.  The prison system is an extreme form of the bureaucracy found in every facet of life - school, corporation, government.
  The psychological portraits are riveting, particularly in the revelation of how inmate leaders  ""Queen Bea"" Smith, Sandy Edwards, and Marie Winter are constrained by the demands of their subjects in what they do to mete out ""people's justice"" and ensure their welfare against the dictates of the ""screws.""
  Politics of class, gender, and sexual preference are also explored.  Upper middle class and celebrity inmates, though rare, are able to ""work the system"" through their outside contacts to their advantage while working-class women have difficulty securing justice and are subject to bias because they are less ""respectable"" and thus have a propensity for crime.
Corrupt officers such as Jock Stewart demonstrate how hierarchies lead to injustice and tyranny, -- how the automatic reaction in any conflict that the prisoner must be lyng while the officer is telling the truth allows evil to flourish.  The inmates often reflect that most of them are inside because of a problem caused by some man, while in this particular volume Sr. Officer Meg Morris's husband is resentful of his wife's career and [spoiler here] leaves her when she receives a long-sought, well-deserved promotion to Deputy Governor.  Judy Bryant, a long-serving, large lesbian with a large heart, is always at risk of being smeared as a ""predator.""
  This particular volume includes Dr. Kate Pedersen's (magnificantly portrayed by Olivia Hamnett) descent into madness - a concrete examination of how prison, rather than improving miscreants' character, makes them worse, even to the point of destroying them.
  In addition, in volume 8, there is a strong storyline in which Deputy Governor Collen Powell's daughter is kidnapped (by chance, due to a robbery gone wrong)and raped.  Powell begins to abuse her authority when a female accomplice of the rapist ends up in Wentworth.  There are more examples of the corrosive effects on social relationships of petty dishonesty, misunderstandings, and distrust.  A society in which no one can trust anyone is a nightmare.
  Over the years ""Prisoner"" was criticized for poor quality sets (wobbly walls), bad acting, and improbable story lines.  The program was not perfect, but such complaints suggest nitpicking rather than judicious scrutiny.  Sheila Florence's Lizzie Birdworth perfectly captures the trials of the aged inside or outside, for whom old age itself gradually becomes a prison.  Patsy King's governor ""Empress Erica"" walks a tightrope between the demands of a public seeking protection and retribution, and the moral imperatives of common humanity, of offering hope. And as for storylines... well, Margo Gaffney's brief spell as ""top dog"" makes Genet seem like Mr. Rogers.
  In the summer of 1980, I was in Philadelphia for training on the IBM System/38 computer.  In the subways there were advertisements above the doors: ""These doors will open... but not the doors of Cell Block H.""  I remembered that slogan for 30 years.  Thanks to DVD's, I have finally been able to view the series.  It was well worth waiting for.",1353110400,,3808,5.2224052718286655
8506386,5,B006Y8JDGE,"Volumes 8 and 9 of Prisoner: Cell Block H feature one missing element - a nasty screw. Following the departure of Vera Bennett (Fiona Spence) in episode 224, we start this discset with episode 225 and we see Colleen Powell (Judith McGrath) keenly stepping into Vera's shoes. Colleen never turns out to be as nasty as Vera was, but at the evry end of the next volume we will be introduced to the far nastier Joan Ferguson (Maggie Kirkpatrick).
Episodes 225 - 256 feature a riot, a kidnapping, a suicide, an arson, a job promotion, a hospitalisation, a transfer to Barnhurst, a fresh start for Lizzie Birdsworth (the late Sheila Florance) and two new prison officers (played by Kate Shiel and the late Wayne Jarrett). Meg Morris (Elspeth Ballantyne) seems to be very easily talked into returning into her Wentworth greys. New inmates include Kate Petersen (the late Olivia Hamnett), Sandy Edwards (Louise Le Nay) and Marie Winters (Maggie Millar). Watching the story involving Kate Petersen is certainly one of the best in the entire series and Kate is certainly a welcome addition to the series. She is certainly a welcome replacement for Alison Page (Fay Kelton). We also get another rare outing for Erica Davidson's (Patsy King) home. Also the homes of Janet Conway and Meg Morris are also featured quite alot.
Originally screened in Australia at the end of 1981 (episodes 247 - 256 screened in early 1982).
The end credits no longer feature the instrumental version (last used in episode 221) and the end credits do make some confusing reading - the copyright year states 1980, however these epsiodes were all clearly made in 1981.
If you're missing Vera and earger to see The Freak's arrival, do not despair - you are not too far away from
- cough cough ""Where do I sign on?"". The famous first few words of the woman who would go on to terrorise everyone in Wentworth (episode 287).
Well that's next time. Enjoy a Vinegar-less Wentworth!",1327190400,,1940,4.794029850746269
