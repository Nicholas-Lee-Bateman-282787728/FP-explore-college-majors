If you want to get back into shape, but still do not (or will never have) the balance, strength, and good back and knees needed to perform standing leg exercises, well then...this compilation of workouts is ideal.  I agree with the other reviewer that there really should be more from the very first volume with Susan Harris, but I say...just get the first volume and go to the floor workout.  If you want more variety...then get this workout and soon you may just have the stamina to go to the standing workouts.

Pilates (real Pilates) is all done on the floor, and strength classes for dancers always includes this kind of floor exercise. This and the other original Firm workouts have gotten me back in shape time and time again...even when I thought there was no hope.

Please...put this workout on DVD.  I still own my VHS copy as I own many of the first...oh...I'd say 10 workouts on VHS, and they were expensive, but so effective that still...after all this time...nothing has come out that is as effective or has stood up as well.  I've had about four combination DVD/VHS players break down, but these tapes have stood up beautifully.

If you own a combo player, can stand period 80's/90's fashions and music (I like it myself;).  This tape plus the 5-day Abs will help you get back a beautiful youthful shape, and also make you feel good.  The workouts are tough, but doable for most.  You honestly don't need some of the equipment either, and can use substitutes...like a chair or small box for the fanny lifter or step box (I used a ""Rubbermaid"" kitchen stool for a long time), and different things around the house until you can purchase weights (which are quite inexpensive these days).  The weight that is red (by the way) is just a small ankle weight that can be wrapped around the toes.",1347235200,,1851,4.626911314984709
8021972,4,B000248XHQ,"This workout contains lower body floorwork from the classic Firm Volumes 1-6.  There is a good variety here, bridgework and tablework for the hamstrings and behind, plus inner and outer thigh work as well.  There is also some pelvic floor work included in the last lower body segment before the cooldown.  All the segments include the use of ankle weights or dumbells sometimes both, but the exercises could be performed easily without either and still be effective.  In one segment you will even see the use of toe weights which were sold by the Firm years ago.

This workout is just short of 30 minutes including warmup and cooldown.  Even though I have had this workout for many years, looking back on it I am surprised there weren't more clips from volume 1 which is famous for it's lower body floorwork section.  Most of the clips from this video are from volume 3.

Regardless this is a good choice if you are looking for a lower body workout with good variety that hits all the muscles of your backside thoroughly.  This workout is also known as Firm Parts: Lower Body Sculpting, which they renamed after it they first named it ""Floor Legs"".",1143936000,3,1148,4.643564356435643
