1896454,5,B00009XN8M,"Im Eva Mendes number one fan. She loves me, just acts a lil stuck up cuz i haven't beat up enough people yet. With the right traighning and conditioning i will beat up anyone who wants a piece of Stitch.",1257552000,,203,4.1
1896455,2,B00009XN8M,"From 1999 comes this outing featuring the young Scarlett Johansson, whose career since then has been remarkably ascendant.  ""The Horse Whisperer,"" made at about the same time, is a far better barometer of the talent this fine actress can display.  ""My Brother the Pig"" is more appropriately aimed at the Saturday Matinee at the Movies crowd.  Eva Mendes and Judge Reinhold are on board to help, but it's all very predictable and suitable mainly for an audience of elementary school mentalities.",1241308800,,494,5.074074074074074
1896456,2,B00009XN8M,"For those who say this is 'fun for the whole family' I must disagree.  Everything about this film is substandard and as an adult I found it extremely tiresome.  After reading some favorable reviews I kept watching, hoping that it would change for the better.  My kids didn't care for it much either.

As a fan of Scarlett Johansson I found this to be one to avoid.  All of the dialogue and acting is sub-par.  The only bright spot is Eva Mendes as the nanny, who may not have turned in the best performance of her career but is at least believable.  If you really feel you must then rent it for the kids.  If they truly love it then buy it.  But don't pay more than one or two dollars.",1231891200,3,685,4.1679389312977095
1896457,1,B00009XN8M,"I watched this movie the other day and it just made me angry.  First of all, I was just appalled at the character Scarlett Johannsen plays.  She's a petty, whiny, obnoxious teen named Cathy who just spouts venom at everyone in her life, and no one puts a stop to her.  I guess her attitude is supposed to be considered ""cute and sassy.""  She is a physically beautiful girl, but her character is so hateful, sulky, and melodramatic that I found myself annoyed every time she came out on the screen.  Then there is Eva Mendes' as the Mexican nanny of the two priveleged white children.  It's so shameful that as a proud Latina she would actually take on this degrading role.  She plays the stereotypical ignorant, ""Ay yay yay! Si senor, si senorita, anything you say"" Mexican nanny with a fake, thick accent. There is a scene where they go to Mexico and it's just the most bucolic village straight out of the 1800's, with a fountain in the middle and more stereotypical, backwards Mexican characters. (There was even one sleeping on the floor with a sombrero!) Hollywood doesn't dare put out scripts anymore where blacks are portrayed as ""mammies"" and servants, because that would be considered racist. They'll write a role for a white criminal over a black one so as to not offend anybody. The day is not yet here when people of all cultures and nationalities are portrayed with dignity and respect.",1214956800,4,1398,4.658536585365853
1896458,4,B00009XN8M,"Although I had never heard of this movie before I bought it for my little boy, I was glad I did.  He loved it and I thought it was very cute.",1202688000,2,141,3.5483870967741935

1896490,1,B00009XN8M,"This is an okay flick.  It would have been given 5 stars if it wasn't for the teen cursing at her brother, gratuitous use of the Lord's name in vain, a semi-nude scene of the babysitter, and  use of magic and potions.  Not for a true Christian household.",1425772800,,254,4.25

1896498,3,B00009XN8M,"Note: I saw this movie on TV.

I was intrigued by the premise of this movie and Ms. Johannsson. Ultimately, the film is a minor disappointment. SPOILER ALERT!!! I wished that Kathy was more loving to her brother at the end, though he was an anoying jerk throughout the film. SPOILER ALERT OVER!!! (I wish the camera had shown Eva Mendes naked). Those are my only quibbles with the film. Rent it.",1318723200,,395,4.486111111111111

7994105,5,B00009XN8M,"Very Mild fun. Scarlett Johansson's acting is actually good in this kids movie. The Mexican guy that chases her with a butcher's knife was meant as a gag; but he actually wouldn't get far (these days) without getting shot down by some eager handgun packing beaver. Her parents seem clueless, yet nice. Her nanny is from lala land. The world is fully of annoying people and they exist to send Kate (Scarlett Johannson) over the edge.",1456272000,,432,4.697368421052632
