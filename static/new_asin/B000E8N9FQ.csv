I remember being glued to our big, mahogany television set watching Ramar in the 1950's and the years of re-runs all through the Sixties. This low budget, cult TV series starred Jon Hall as Dr. Tom Reynolds (known as ""Ramar"" or ""white doctor"" to the jungle folk), along with his assistant Professor Howard Ogden, and their faithful Cockney valet Charlie with his pet parrot Walter.

""Ramar of the Jungle"" only aired with first-run episodes for two seasons (1952-53, and 1953-54). After that it was released to countless television stations nationwide where all of the 52 episodes were aired hundreds of times over the years.

One way the owners of the series were able to squeeze more dollars from the Ramar series was to edit a number of episodes into four feature-length films for theatrical release in 1953 and 1955.

Then in 1964 seven feature films were compiled from Ramar TV episodes and made available for television release.  This brings us to ""Ramar and the Jungle Voodoo."" It was one of the seven features with each film running about 80 minutes and leaving 10 minutes for commercials.  Of these seven Ramar made-for-TV feature films, ""Ramar and the Jungle Voodoo"" was thought to be lost until it was somehow discovered by Alpha Video and released on DVD.

I would have given this DVD release a five star rating except that the picture quality leaves something to be desired. It is watchable, but, for the most part, the picture is pretty washed out. The sound, however, is okay.

The DVD's box states that this feature is comprised of four Ramar TV episodes, edited down and linked together by an off-screen narrator who, by the way, does not know how to correctly pronounce Ramar's name. He says ""raMAR"" instead of ""RAmar."" But that only adds to the fun of this movie.

There are actually five edited TV episodes that are contained in ""Ramar and the Jungle Voodoo:""

1. ""Doomed Safari"" - Ramar treats a badly-sprained ankle of lovely newly-wed Phyllis Coates while her husband, against Ramar's advice, goes into a forbidden part of the jungle looking for uranium;

2. ""Mask of Kreenah"" - A woman steals the jewels from the eyes of a ceremonial mask that is worshiped by a tribe of natives. The tribal king forces Ramar to track the thief by following her murderous trail through the jungle;

3. ""Danger in Disguise"" - Ramar saves two greedy hunters from some hostile natives. Later that night, the two men steal Ramar's experimental serum in hopes of marketing it back in the States;

4. ""Contraband"" - Two bloodthirsty ivory poachers attempt to kill Ramar, Howard and Charlie, but are routed from Ramar's camp. Later the poachers decide to rob the local trading post of its recently-acquired ivory supply;

5. ""The Sacred Monkey"" - Legend has it that an unknown species of monkeys inhabit a remote jungle mountaintop and have the ability to live 90 years or longer. Ramar is determined to discover if the legend is true. He hopes to be able to study the monkeys in an effort to prolong human life.

There is also a ""bonus feature"" on this DVD, a Ramar TV episode entitled ""Dark Justice."" It's one of the better episodes, but it suffers from only fair picture quality. The story is about a husband and wife who come to Ramar's area of the jungle looking for the grave of the wife's uncle who died the year before. The husband is acting in a hostile manner toward everyone, and Ramar soon begins to suspect that the husband knows more about the death of his wife's uncle than he wants to admit.

To my knowledge, ""Ramar and the Jungle Voodoo"" is the only Ramar ""feature film"" available on DVD. If you don't mind a picture that is far from ""TCM quality"" (and Africian natives who talk like Tonto), you might enjoy this Alpha release.",1344556800,2,3787,4.69939577039275
