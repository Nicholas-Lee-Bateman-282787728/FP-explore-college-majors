2359888,3,B000A59PZQ,"Deena Martin (Hilary Swank) is a profoundly troubled 15-year-old with a history of wild and abusive behaviour. Deena's mom Cynthia Martin (Joanna Kerns) turns to alcohol, and father Todd Martin (Dan Lauria) escapes in his work. They're unaware their Boy Scout son, Adam (Adam Hendershott), 13, sips from a vodka bottle hidden in his bedroom. And the problems in this dysfunctional family continue to worsen.

Argument flames when Cynthia confronts Deena about skipping school. The girl slaps her mother and runs from the house. Later Deena admits her truancy, but manipulates her mother into covering for her by lying to the principal. Enraged by her father's demands to do her homework, Deena slams her bedroom door on his fingers, breaking them.

When her father objects to her going to California with her boyfriend Garrett (Andrew Kavovit), she threatens him with a kitchen knife and hits her mother. Arrested and taken to a juvenile detention centre, she's ordered to begin therapy while staying with her aunt Judith (Kathleen Wilhoite).

Meanwhile, Adam's secret vodka stash is discovered. His father, realising they all desperately need help, arranges for the whole family to meet with Deena's therapist, so their problems can be brought into the open and healing can begin.

Before she became a two-time Oscar winner, Hilary Swank appeared in such hard-hitting TV movies as Terror in the Family. The actress is cast as Deena Martin. Deena struggles to get her life under control, but the film's script makes it abundantly clear that the problem isn't hers alone. Both her mother and brother are alcoholics, and her distant, self-absorbed father would have been just as happy if neither of his children had ever been born.

That said this is still an entertaining movie and gives us somewhat of a bleak look into the lives of a dysfunctional family.",1367107200,2,1856,5.072131147540984
2359889,5,B000A59PZQ,"As teenagers rebellion would set in to the point where we would sneak out the house with friends. This movie details that. It also takes on the violence in the home, alcoholism, and criticism within the family, and the running away. My teen days were like that, except for the violence (it was mostly anger, and I did get help too). As the family realizes the damage they've caused, they also get help as well. Their teenage daughter gets probation, breaks up with her no-good boyfriend, and starts over.",1358899200,,504,4.674157303370786

8074496,4,B000A59PZQ,"...is the all consuming, frequently draining, complex yet rewarding job of raising children. In the very best of circumstances, all you want as a parent is to properly guide your kids, while providing the safest, loving environment and still allow them the freedom to discover themselves. You would think that communicating and keeping them safe and happy while providing appropriate boundaries they can both respect and understand, should be the easiest job in the world. Then...the ugly suprise rears its head and you discover that you have no idea what you're doing. This film does an exceptional job of illustrating the baseline importance of communication, boundaries, actions vs. consequences and mutual respect within the family unit. As usual, both Joanna Kearns and Hillary Swank bring their absolute best to their performances which adds an additional layer of enjoyment to this high-quality drama. My only wish with TV movies is that they had just a little more time to conclude this type of family drama in a more realistic way. Other than that, I don't believe a single member of a struggling family unit, could not benefit from watching this film with and open mind and a full heart!",1437436800,,1197,5.05050505050505
