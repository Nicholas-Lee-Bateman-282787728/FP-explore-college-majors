8748719,5,B01AX083PA,Very good film about the tragedy on Everest. I'd read about it years ago in National Geographic. I'd also read that Everest is a trash dump from base camp to Everest with abandoned Oxygen bottles and broken equipment. Something else popped into my mind while watching this film. Where do the climbers poop? There must be frozen poop and pee from base camp to the top of Everest. YUK!,1467504000,,383,4.565217391304348
