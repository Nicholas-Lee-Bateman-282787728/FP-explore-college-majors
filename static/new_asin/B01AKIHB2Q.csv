7606845,5,B01AKIHB2Q,"Item was in great condition.  I loved the Aladdin movies, and was pleased with this purchase.  It also came with the Disney Movie rewards points code, and the digital copy for your ultrviolet accounts, which is great.  Now I can own three copies of these movies, the Blu-ray, DVD, and the copy for the cloud.  These movies are classics, especially the first.  Rest in peace to Robin Williams. We all love you!  Without a doubt, I recommend!!!!",1481241600,4,443,4.688311688311688

7606847,3,B01AKIHB2Q,"I know these movies were low-budget, straight-to-video productions, but it would've been nice to get better quality transfers on this Blu-Ray. It's definitely an upgrade from VHS, but the image quality still seems a bit blurry for Blu-Ray, like they just put the DVD versions on Blu-Ray. Also, maybe it's my imagination, but the movies look a little dim.",1460937600,8,354,5.016949152542373

8747624,5,B01AKIHB2Q,I was so thrilled to see both movies together on Blu Ray/DVD. I grew up watching these. They came fast and it's even more fun watching as an adult.,1534377600,,147,4.103448275862069
8747625,3,B01AKIHB2Q,I am disappointed in these Blu-ray's they are not a great improvement over the DVD's that came with the set.  The only a little bit better.  The main problem with is 5.1 audio.  I tested this audio vs the DVD versions and the DVD 5.1 Dolby Digital is better than the Blu-rays DTS 5.1 track.  You lose more sounds in Blu-ray version.  I  will probably take the audio from the DVD's and create a bluray with DVD audio.,1532390400,,416,4.269230769230769
