1909866,1,B0000C0UTP,"I love animals, big cats in particular and was very excited after watching the special on this movie.  The movie wasn't a movie, it was more like a home movie with no plot of any kind.  It would have been more interesting to watch a documentary on how they lived with these animals.",1126051200,6,282,4.30188679245283
1909867,5,B0000C0UTP,"Roar is a perfect treat for a Bigcat Lover. Don't mind the high price, 19.99, it sure is worth it.

But the DVD could have been made more interesting if they had provided more footage of ""movie in the making"". And the movie would have rocked if they have showed the fight interaction (if any during the filming) between the Lion & the Tiger.

Nonetheless, ROAR is just one of a kind movie...Go for it.",1106179200,5,401,4.333333333333333
1909868,5,B0000C0UTP,"This movie breaks all the barriers when it comes to interaction between the BIG CATS and humans. The scenes in this movie are simply breath-taking yet at the same time very heartening to watch especially when the big cats show their love and affection for the actors in the movie.
Its an ideal family movie one which everyone will love to see especially you're a big cats fan of lions-tigers-jaguars-leopards etc.

1909870,3,B0000C0UTP,"""Roar"" is a film I got a lot of enjoyment out of as a child and watching it as an adult was as entertaining as ever. What catches my attention this time round is the danger that the cast were putting themselves in working with these animals. Any film that attempts this type of drama should certainly be remembered a bit more than ""Roar"" has.
Since details on this dvd are so difficult to find on the web, I'd like to tell you what ""Roar"" has. First of all, the widescreen is good in that it shows the film as it should be viewed but it's not 16:9 for widescreen tv's. However the picture is quite strong anyway for zoom.
The short interviews are decent enough but one must wonder that there's got to be a great documentary somewhere on this 11 years of film making. Probably more engaging than the film itself.
The sound is not 5.1 but stereo surround as it was originally. Now I could be wrong here but I'm sure this film is cut. Within the first 15 minutes I'm sure there was a scene with Tippi Hedren and her kids discussing how they gave the husband/father the wrong arrival time and another bit with the two sons having an argument which lead to a fight. One of the sons trys karate on his brother. These two scenes are missing from my dvd. On top of that I'm sure at 84 minutes this dvd goes for is way too short from what I remember of seeing this film on video. Without that first scene the film doesn't make sense. We don't know my Noel Marshall thinks his family arrives later that night.
If I'm totally delusional here please correct me. It's not a major disapointment. I've had worse and I'll get over it quick enough. ""Roar"" is a definitely worth a look.",1082332800,17,1668,4.281645569620253
1909871,5,B0000C0UTP,"I first saw this movie at a young age and loved it! I have grown up with this movie and have never grown tired of it. I am amazed by the interaction between this crazy family and the hundreds of wild animals. Not only is this one of my favorite movies of ALL TIME, but my friends all love it too. There have been numerous times where we vote to stay home and watch Roar for the 30 millionth time rather than go out and see whatever new movie has come out that particular week.  P.S. My favorite part is where John hides from the lions in the water barrel!",1070236800,9,555,4.045454545454546

7998108,5,B0000C0UTP,"<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Roar/dp/B0000C0UTP/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Roar</a>It turns out that birds aren't the only critters to have given actress Tippi Hedren a rough time on screen! In ""Roar"" (1981), a film that Tippi and her then-husband Noel Marshall--along with sons John and Jerry and daughter Melanie Griffith--star in (Tippi and Noel also wrote, produced and directed), all manner of wild animals turn up to give the actress some fairly tense moments. In this virtually plot less film, a mother and her three kids go to Africa to visit their scientist husband/father after an absence of three years. Dad's not at home when they arrive, but around 30 large cats--lions, tigers, jaguars, etc.--are, and proceed to chase the family all around the abode. These animals are never shown in a bad light, however; this is very much a pro-conservation film that espouses all wildlife causes. That is all well and good, but the film's primary appeal, it must be said, is the Marshalls' fearless interaction with the big cats. Seeing Noel dive into a group of fighting lions and come out bloodied but happily beaming is really quite remarkable. Tippi reveals herself to be quite an extraordinary stuntwoman, too. Just watch her get tossed about by an elephant, fall off a tipping ladder into a pond, climb down a waterwheel, and roll around with the lions! We are told at the picture's beginning that no animals were harmed during its (11-year!) filming; I for one could use a further reassurance about the movie's humans! Siegfried & Roy eat your hearts out; no lion tamer act will ever seem impressive after one sees what Noel and family do during the course of this film! ""How did they ever make this thing?"" is the question that springs to mind constantly during a viewing of ""Roar""; the human-animal interactions shown are like nothing you have ever seen. In that, it is a completely sui generis experience, and, despite a few genuinely scary moments, perfectly suitable for watching with the kiddies. Very highly recommended.",1280275200,3,2076,5.181547619047619
7998109,4,B0000C0UTP,Why is this film so rare?  It makes me bloody sick when something that I want comes out as a limited edition and I find out about whatever the item is such as ROAR when it's been out for years and now rare and expensive.  Who is going to pay $99.99 for a brand-new copy?  Even a second-hand copy is over-priced.,1262649600,,311,4.065573770491803
7998110,5,B0000C0UTP,"The movie ROAR is an entertaining account of Tippi Hedren and her husband, Noel Marshall's struggle to make a fun, family-orientated, movie worthy of these magnificent creatures. In the movie, Noel Marshall, in one of the... bravest, most amazing acts ever to be recorded in film, while surrounded by big cats, with bare-hands,injects himself into the middle of a fight, breaking it up. This is an actual fight between two very large, aggressive, mad, African male lions, Wow!...And that's ""No Act""! One of the many astounding scenes that you will find in this movie.

Another scene, is with Tippi accidentally falling down on a log while trying to escape this entourage of lions following her... only to have them continue on across the log stepping all over her in the process. One of them actually stops to punish her, a little, just for being in her way. A moment that Tippi will always remember as one of her personal war wounds.

It is a movie that you will never see the likes of again, with that many huge cats interacting with humans! It is a ""One-of-a-Kind"" fun, movie...and, definitely a movie worth watching !",1220832000,,1121,4.77319587628866
7998111,4,B0000C0UTP,"If you're a die hard fan of panthera XXX (fill in the blank as you wish, you'd be correct), this movie is for you. Hordes of lions, male and female, tigers and leopards are constantly milling/leaping/roaring/ around all corners of the set almost literally from start to finish. An inordinate amount of human/animal interaction should keep those who derives great pleasure from seeing big cats acting docile and manageable around human beings very happy. Do not expect a robust story line or inspiring acting. That can't be what you buy this DVD for these days, anyway unless you're a Melanie Griffith worshipper. A very young version of the actress is featured in the movie. In short, treat this as a big cat documentary, not a movie.",1212883200,2,734,4.833333333333333
7998112,5,B0000C0UTP,It is just mind blowing to see how all those cats have interacted with each other and the actors!! Never mind the story...although it is not bad but that's not the reason why should watch the movie.  It is the footage which is incredible.,1168300800,,238,4.409090909090909
