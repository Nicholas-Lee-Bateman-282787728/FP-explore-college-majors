324886,2,6301216210,"I still think this movie is okay. I liked it a lot when I was younger, though. I liked it more than E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial. This is like E.T. but it has a different story to it. A kid struggles to find his alien friend's family in the desert. When they do find it. A lot of danger occurs between the two friends. But there is a happy ending, of course. I think this one is more of a family favourite than E.T.
If you are really serious about renting it. Then do so. It ain't quite that bad.",994982400,2,494,4.0
324887,5,6301216210,"This movie is totally awesome - great Sunday day entertainment.  Although  the acting was not top of the line, the strong plot and heartfelt moments  makes this movie one of my top ten of all times.  At times, I was literally  on the edge of my seat waiting to see what could happen next to the little  alien Mac and his wheelchair ridden bud.",969235200,3,343,4.28125
324888,5,6301216210,"I recommend this movie with high remarks.  I could watch this film over and over again!  That's gotta say something about it.  It's definitely  cute, fun and somewhat of a tearjerker.  Great family movie!  The bond that  the little boy(Jade Calegory) and Mac(creature) come to share is beyond the  true meaning of friendship.  I went to high school with Jade and he's as  every bit sweet as his character!  If you haven't seen it, please, take the  time to rent it!",966556800,3,465,4.604938271604938
324889,5,6301216210,"I see nearly everyone dislikes this film. Everyone either gives it one or no stars. ""Video Movie Guide 2000"" gave it the ""turky"". After I got it I read the positive and negative reviews. And now I'm glad I  was able to enjoy. Yes, it is a pale clone of ""E.T."" but that is  what makes all the more better. Nothing is better than ""E.T."",  but this is right next to it! Perhaps there won't be a sequel because of  how poorly it did with the box office. But it DEFINATLY didn't deserve  ""Worst Picture""!",964569600,2,499,4.2105263157894735
324890,4,6301216210,"Whilst 'ET' was largely empty sentiment from a director more at home with the visceral shocks of 'Hook' and 'Always', this absolutely essential science-fiction drama for children of all ages has a charming innocence  about it that more highly-budgeted films lacked. Concerning the adventures  of ultra-cute space traveller Mac (who, in a deeply ironic twist, is  sustained, like so many of us, with McDonalds' hamburgers) in the confused,  confusing world of the 1980's, this knocks spots off other, more cynical  cash-ins such as 'Flight of the Navigator' and 'Millenium'. Combining  amusing comedy with a positive message about disability, as well as plenty  of amusing references to vital elements of modern culture (our heroes drink  an awful lot of a particular soft drink), it's a laugh riot.
It's a  terrible shame that, whilst most of the above-mentioned films are available  on DVD, this isn't. It reflects the 80's more accurately than a fistful of  'Miami Vice' videos, and seems set to follow Philip Michael Thomas into  relative obscurity. A terrible shame indeed.",961977600,4,1077,5.233918128654971
324891,2,6301216210,"I actually saw this as a youngster and was rather more bored/disgusted than enchanted.  This film, which no matter what they say IS just a bad ET clone, wins the all-time product placement award (edging out Wayne's World  for a tinge of insincere plugging) for the McDonald scene and the  ""Coca-Cola as panacea"" overtone.  If I can't go into further  detail, it is because the film doesn't lend itself to lasting impressions,  rather to the evil arms of corporate extraterrestrialism.",961372800,5,484,4.9875
324892,5,6301216210,"""Mac and Me"" is one of Hollywood's most over-looked pieces of classic science fiction. Fun for the whole family, ""Mac and Me"" will take your heart from the introduction of the film's protagonist: a  cute little extra-terrestrial. Don't jump to any conclusions! This is no  ""E.T."" knock-off. Mac has a mind of his own. After a fabulously  choreographed scene in a Mc Donalds, Mac and his handicapped friend (me)  get into some hefty trouble with the law. Excellent pyrotechnics and  special effects! A true classic...",952905600,7,516,5.023529411764706

After finally buying it and watching it, I understand him much better. This is a great movie if you don't take it too seriously and simply enjoy it as one of those weird 80's things. Yes, it's kind of an ET thing but it's got enough of its own thing that its okay. The aliens are one of the creepiest I've ever seen.

This, however, was not one of those. Despite a few laughable moments, overall it was just a very bland and dull bad 80's flick. Yes there is product placement everywhere and yes it is a discount ET with some nightmare inducing characters, but none of those things make this movie really worth watching. If you really wanna waste your time watching a crappy but entertaining movie,  I recommend ""The Room"", ""Troll 2"" or ""Showgirls"". Watching this movie to me was a waste of time, and those aliens are just scary, and I didn't really need or want horrifying images of those creepy costumes in my head.

I like seeing movies where characters who are supposed to have disabilities are actually played by actors with disabilities.

I love this movie.

After E.T. showed corporate executives everywhere that you could sell tons candy to kids if you put the candy in a movie they like, some cynical Hollywood people cranked out this pathetic E.T. rip-off mostly to sell kids Coke, McDonalds, and Skittles.

While not quite up to the same high entertainment standards provided by&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Plan-9-From-Outer-Space/dp/6305760403/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Plan 9 From Outer Space</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Starcrash/dp/B003NHMYHO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Starcrash</a>, Mac and Me is still one of my favorite bad movies.  If you love unintentionally hilarious trash, you will love this movie.  So many things about it are just so wrong.  Why would a single mom move from Chicago all the way to California just for an in-store position at a Sears?  How does she afford such a house with such a job?  Why doesn't that house have a fence in the backyard if, as soon as the property line ends, it turns into a steep hill that goes straight off a cliff?  If the FBI are trying to capture the alien using a giant metal cage, why would they bring it to the site in a normal sedan so the cage is hanging out of the sedan's open trunk?

Many have already highlighted the wheelchair scene and the McDonalds dance contest (something I've been hoping would happen to me any time I've gone to McDonalds since seeing this movie, maybe I need to move to California) and those are truly wonderful bits of bad movie awesomeness, but I gotta give my two favorite moments to other scenes:

First, when they finally locate Mac's family dying in a mineshaft and looking all the world like dead-by-starvation POWs (horrifying, no doubt, to any children actually watching this movie) only to have them revived via Coca-Cola.

Second,  the part later on when the cops get into a Mexican standoff with the aliens only to have the kid intervene right as the cops decide to fire, which for some reason makes the strip mall behind the aliens explode in a bigger fireball than the when the white house went up in Independence Day.  I could not stop laughing at that.  I must have replayed that scene five or six times when I first saw it.

There are so many laugh out loud moments in this film.  There's tons of crappy movies, but very few are actually worth watching.  My only complaint is that the DVD is fullscreen (does anyone know if an Anamorphic WS edition exists?).

""Mac and Me"" is rare in that it is absolutely terrible, yet remains one highly entertaining film.",1365033600,4,2660,5.1157407407407405
325561,5,6301216210,"I was laughing uncontrollably well into the credits roll. I almost had an asthma attack. This movie is FANTASTIC!

Really, why should a movie have to conform to our preconceived notions of being ""good"" or even ""competent""? To hell with Roger Ebert and, for that matter, the audience!

The thing is, day to day, I go around thinking Hollywood produces such schlock. But this movie shows you that even run-of-the-mill ""bad"" movies reflect a substantial amount of talent and care. You don't really think about it until you see a movie like this - what Hollywood is really capable when they take their foot all the way off the gas. And then fall asleep at the wheel. And then drive off a cliff. This movie is a train wreck that happens right on board the Titanic as it's going down into a volcano.

Everyone seizes on the McDonald's dance scene. But my favorite is the scene where the song comes out of nowhere while Eric and Janet go jogging as MAC simultaneously joyrides in the toy jeep and then wrecks, with the action then cutting back and forth between Janet tousling Eric's hair on the jog and MAC stuck in the tree while the dogs are yapping at him. Oh, man, I don't know how you cut something like that! I don't think you could produce something like that on purpose. It's just too perfectly noncontrivedly off.

What's weird is, this movie is exactly of my era - I would be the same age as the characters Michael and Courtney - but I never saw it until now. I just remember hearing at the time it was really bad. (And I remember a lot of promotion for it at McDonald's.) Now I feel like I missed out. But I don't know. Maybe it's good I didn't see it then, because now I can appreciate its (apparently) accidental brilliance. With the benefit of hindsight, you can see that this movie arguably makes all other movies of the 1980s irrelevant.

The aliens' appearance can be described as strange, goofy or even slightly disturbing. After 22 years, I've finally decided to revisit this film. It's actually not bad, though there are a few issues. It does bear similarities to E.T., but then, who said E.T. had to be the only one of it's kind? Mac and Me is very much an 80s film, and takes every opportunity to remind you. That's fine with me, as I love the 80s and early 90s. Everything was carefree back then, and it's reflected in films like this. It's fine for kids, though like me, they might find it pretty weird. The acting and characters are great, or at least I thought so. It's also chock full of 80s archetypes, from the dance styles and boom boxes to the clothing and musical themes. There's also a distinct lack of obvious CG work, unlike E.T., which made unashamed use of it to the point of being very obvious. Now, the shopping mall confrontation is pretty ridiculous, and speaking of coca-cola, it's everywhere. But really, who cares if a drink is featured in a film? So what? The cops and federal agents are all portrayed as dumb and stupid and incompetent. For instance, they try to order the aliens around in English.

325607,1,6301216210,"I would like to first, thank the producers of this film for their ability to rip off another movie without feeling any pity.  There were too many unintended flaws to summarize, but I will do my best to elaborate on most of them.

***SPOILER (If Possible)***
We start this amazing film with aliens in the middle of the Arizona desert, and the ""father"" is getting his fix by drinking ground water.  Aliens hitch a ride back to Earth and escape the military.  Boy in poorly designed wheelchair befriends E.T. and they experience hilarious adventures, including tragedy.  Movie ends and wheelie-boy still has no father.  The End.

Okay, so I missed a considerable amount of detail, but this movie has to watched to truly understand the brilliance of film-making.  I am unsure if anyone whom participated in the making of this film (i.e. producers, director, gaffer) ever worked again.  I am not saying that this movie is bad, it is horrible, yet hilarious.  The first time I watched this masterpiece, I was begging for more.  It ended so abruptly and they made a promise they couldn't keep (you will see at the end).

So, the kid that they have to play Me, er, Derek, er, Eric was a fine specimen of an actor.  Had zero acting ability and his wheelchair skills were not up to snuff.  In the infamous scene, he obviously had not tested wind speed nor trajectory.  Lets just say he won't be participating in any wheelchair high-dive competitions.  His landing was all wrong, so I will go with the judges and give him a 6.5 for height and 5.7 for the landing.  No wonder he was left off the American team.  Honorable mention goes to his new girlfriend, Debbie.  She spends most of her time spying on her neighbors and whines a lot.  Her sister is hot though and works at McDonald's, so thats a plus.  Anyway, Debbie likes to annoy people and fly around the room wearing a vacuum on her back.  She is a girl of many talents who will go far in life.

Let's talk about MAC; the hapless adorable squirrel-cat that is the root of all evil.  He has all the best lines in the movie and is hopeless romantic.  All he wants to do is drink soda and sleep.  His former college roommates stated in an interview that he trashed the dorms on a regular basis.  If it weren't for the Roid-rage, he might be fun to hang out with at the local arcade.

Everyone else in the movie gets my star of approval. If there is anyone whom I felt truly sorry for, it would have to go to Christine Ebersol (mom), and Robert Davi (cop #3 - of Wishmaster fame).  Mom was cool even though she and her family had the worst couple of days that anyone can experience. Mr. Davi - well, we all need to get are start somewhere.

Watch this movie with friends, family, and relatives.  I just wish they made a sequel.  So, if anyone is interested, I have ideas to re-make this classic.  All I need is about $173.21.",1298332800,4,2867,4.420650095602294

325612,2,6301216210,"""Mac and Me"", ""E.T."", rip-off, et cetera, et cetera.

If the endless comparisons of ""Avatar"" to ""Ferngully"" taught me anything, if you're going to copy something, copy it very well.  Unfortunately for ""Mac and Me"", it's anything BUT right.  ""E.T."" was such a whimsical movie because of its mystery and wonder; the alien was hardly visible for a good while, which build the curiosity and became rewarding once the alien appeared.  The movie spend time developing the relationship between a child and a foreign creature, and overtime they become a engaging pair.  It has an riveting story and treated the characters with care; okay, it pulled the most asinine Deus Ex Machina to resolve a tragic scene, but otherwise it's a fantastic family movie.  With ""Mac and Me"", the mentality of the movie seems to be, 'Hey, we dropped an alien on your doorstep, go nuts.  Isn't he cute?'  And that's another thing, I don't find Mac to be cute at all.  E.T. may not look like a cute alien, but he had a variety of emotions that displayed its humanity, making him adorable.  Mac had these oddball eyes, that permanent ""O"" face and his horrible wobbly body, he looked like Rodney Dangerfield's aborted fetus; what's funny is that he has very tiny legs, and yet he walks, he suddenly grew to have human child-like legs.  I never liked how cartoony he's treated during many physical jokes, which pushed me away from him.  To me, he's more creepy than cute.

The biggest issue with this movie is the story and how it's told.  It's seems like most of the characters are improbably clairvoyant in how they drive the narrative.  The evil government knew exactly the house of where the alien is located and which car they should follow out of tens of houses and cars within the vicinity, without displaying any evidence to prove they're correct; even the government guys from ""E.T."" took a meticulous amount of time to guesstimate the alien's location.  The main character, a wheelchair-bound kid named Eric, sets up traps by using cans of soda and straws to lure the alien in his house, and how did he know those are what the alien liked to use?  And much later in the film, when Eric and his friends found Mac's family, they know which gender belongs to which alien; first off, they all appear pretty asexual, so how could they tell which is which?  Without even properly explaining how these events are established, the movie became haphazard in its storytelling.

Now, about its notoriously blatant product placements.  They are certainly prevalent: Eric often left a bag of Skittles on his pants in plain view for the camera to shoot, there's lots of Coca-Cola cans for MAC to drink, MAC is named after a Big Mac, and speaking of that, there's a length sequence where the family went into the McDonalds restaurant and Ronald McDonald was in it; during that sequence, everyone started dancing in unrealistically perfect unison and MAC goes along with the choreography in a teddy bear outfit. Yea, the movie's rubbing the advertisements in my face, but to be honest, they didn't really bother me.  The movie isn't more obnoxiously sold in its product placements than in Adam Sandler's ""Eight Crazy Nights"" (gee, Mr. Chanukah, I SURE like to hear a song about going to Ben and Jerry's).

""Mac and Me"" is pretty harmless, and I do like its music score by Alan Silvestri, but I can't see it as any more than a shameless cash grab to a more successful and substantial movie.  However, it is worth a look just for its utterly ridiculous scenes.  One was the infamous wheelchair scene where Eric rolled into a steep hill and suddenly felt into a lake, the other is a chase scene across a downward slope, where Eric in a speeding wheelchair miraculous grabbed a bumper of a car without crashing it.  But my favorite ridiculous moment is the explosion scene near the movie's ending, because how it was done was so over-the-top and out-of-proportion, it made me laugh out loud.  The latter was worth the movie's three-dollar purchase.",1282867200,3,4006,4.736311239193084

325616,2,6301216210,"""Mac and Me"" isn't a good movie. This was a fact long before the internet perpetuated it with clips of the infamous wheelchair scene, causing many people to assume this conclusion without even seeing the whole film themselves, but for once, the assumption isn't inaccurate. It's tough to creatively criticize a movie that's been bashed from hell to breakfast like this one, but luckily, I have a personal complaint to elaborate on. You see, being the mushy kind of guy I am, I could have forgiven the shoddy acting, lackluster special effects, and shameless product placement if the movie had capitalized on its ""a boy and his alien"" premise...but, as you can tell by my rating, it didn't pull it off.

The story: accidentally abducted by a NASA probe, a family of aliens is separated from their son on earth. With government agents tracking him, ""Mac"" must forge a friendship with wheelchair-bound Eric Cruise (Jade Calegory) and his own family if he ever hopes to be reunited.

I'll admit it again - I'm a sucker for ""child-and-their-strange-friend"" stories. Movies and media like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lilo-Stitch/dp/B00005JL96/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lilo & Stitch</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dragonworld/dp/6303122183/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dragonworld</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Digimon-Tamers/dp/B002BPRK6Y/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Digimon Tamers</a>, and of course&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/E-T/dp/B000A2IPP0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">E.T.</a>&nbsp;found their way into my heart by such means, and even though the rest of the movie stunk to high heaven, a well-rendered friendship between Mac and Eric could have saved it in my book. Sadly, the movie doesn't even try: the extent of their kinship is Mac looking mighty confused while Eric ignores all common sense in defending him, angrily claiming that Mac's not dangerous even after he's demolished his living room for no reason and lured him to fall off a cliff. The entire alien family is like that: unintentional hilarity occurs at the end of the movie when Eric's brother (Jonathan Ward, who'd voice Zak in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/FernGully-The-Last-Rainforest/dp/B00005UW9S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">FernGully - The Last Rainforest</a>) repeatedly hollers ""They're not gonna hurt anyone!"" at the police, even after we've seen them cause a massive traffic accident and literally blow up anything they touch earlier in the film. With ""E.T."" having been released six years earlier, the audience is clearly expected to assume a similar emotional template and feel sorry for the aliens simply for being aliens. Lazy, huh?

So that's it: Eric more or less just drags Mac around, feeding him Coke and Skittles, deciphering his weirdo clues as to where his family is, and trying not to let on that he's dealing with a poorly-articulated puppet. I wish there was something else to the film to redeem it, but even though it's more technically sound than most ""worst-ever"" movies, the story elicits a blah-some emotional response at best due to scenes of actual peril being limited and all of the characters being illogical buffoons. My personal favorite of these is Eric's mother (Christine Ebersole,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Amadeus/dp/6304712936/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Amadeus</a>), who seems pretty nice at first but goes off the condescending deep end when, after Mac's done his thing, she accuses her wheelchair-bound son of turning their home into an atrium overnight - actually assuming that he was capable of moving vast amounts of plants and rocks into the house and even sticking them on the ceiling. Director Stewart Raffil will never be remembered as a hero, but this really is something; how could he deliver a certified comedy of errors that's still so very emotionally numb? Again, the guy's not a genius, but he directed&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Ice-Pirates/dp/B0006J28MS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Ice Pirates</a>, after all - did he blow his creative wad on that one entirely?

As far as Coca-Cola and McDonald's pushing their products in this film, I think that aspect has been blown out of proportion by bloggers - save for the instance when Eric attempts to bait Mac by leading him to a cup of Coke via a trail of straws, which even I have to admit feels really forced. In all, ""Mac and Me"" isn't outright bad enough for me to include it on the list of worst movies I've ever seen, but it's still best left forgotten by everyone who enjoys halfway-decent cinema.",1272585600,3,4807,6.033674963396779

This is what this film is a bad E.T. clone/rip-off, whatever you like to call it. The title is even a reference to a working title for that film- ""E.T. and Me"". As for the film itself it's just plain bad, you get obvious filming mistakes all over the place like a visible track up the wall for the hoover when he is sucked up, the mother saying a different line in the Sears scene from what is heard in the film (obviously dubbed after), the aliens looking really, REALLY pathetic, a plot-hole with MAC up in a tree with no mention of how he came down with a crappy song playing, tons and tons of constant references to McDonald's (no wonder why the alien is called Mac), Skittles and Coca-Cola making this film also a blatant advert. When all put together alongside the most stupidest ending ever, creates the biggest ever horrific film to be recorded to tape in a very long time.

325631,5,6301216210,"The movie Mac and Cheese portrays a druggie alien whose main goal in
life was to kill The Wheelchair Boy and steal his Coke. The sex scene
in
the movie is great. Let's talk about Mac: He's a mutated meerkat, whose
addiction for Coke made him leave his planet to come to earth...just to
get one fix. While strung out on Coke, he was driving his Power Wheels
down the street and had a fatal Power Wheels accident, giving him fatal
head trauma...but luckily he survived. The coroner said that drinking
and driving is bad for meerkats while operating Power Wheels. I believe
him. He would never lie to me. Except for that one time when he lied
about having a crush on me. But, anyways. Now let's talk about Cheese:
aka The Wheelchair Boy who loves falling down cliffs. I learned one
lesson from that scene: Wheelchairs are heavy and gravity doesn't like
you. Too bad Mac was strung out on Coke when he tried to save him. He
ended up killing Cheese. He was giving him CPR while still in the
water.
I cried for hours. God, I miss Cheese. I miss him so
much!!!!Ok...that's
better. Now Mac is upset at himself and he wants
vengance...uh...against
himself. So he has a mass Coke-spree, even drinking Sams Choice when he
is low on cash. Wanting to waste away in this sad world of tasty
carbonation addiction known as Coke. The last scene in Mac and Cheese,
Mac is sitting in Ronnie McDonnie's, sobbing, drinking a Big Gulp.
Thinking this ""Oscar-worthy film""-(hulk hogan), is over, something
unexpected happens. This is truly the climax!!! Cheese's rotted corpse,
wheelchair and all rolls into Ronnie McDonnie's, and picks up Mac's
lifeless body, and rolls out into the sunset...leaving you

Don't worry he is saved by the title alien Mac (get it like a Big Mac sandwich) who apparently needs to drink Coca Cola to stay alive.

First of all the movie is the most obvious E.T. ripoff ever. (1) A family without a dad and two boys(2)Older brothers name is Michael,(3) Girls name Debbie vs Gerdie, (4) Alien tricked into the house with food/beverage (Coke replaced the Reeses) (5) Alien talks, (6) Chased by the Government, etc. There was even a scene which LOOKED like the playground scene where the van stopped so they could plan. Man I was waiting for the wheelchair to start flying.

After I watched this I felt a sudden need for a value menu at McDonalds with a Coke and some Skittles. The product placement was non stop-always placed in a way the viewer could see perfectly. As the movie was in the final scene I thought the barrage was over until I saw MAC has a MCKIDS shirt and I just started cracking up. For reference you may remember it- the scene where the alien family gets citizenship in the US and then drives a car!

Honestly this movie is only for kids. Any adult would watch that McDonalds dancing scene and know it was cinematic awfulness. Two stars because its honestly in that rare ""so bad its good"" but only to laugh at and only once.",1210809600,17,1371,4.368627450980392

The coke cans are turned toward the camera so the logo shows, the girl is mostly always wearing her McDonalds uniform during the movie, etc.

The part I remember most is near the end when wheelchair boy goes boom.  His friends bring him over, and one shouts ""He's breathing, he's going to be ok"".  Then another guy comes over, looks at him for literally 2 seconds, and says ""There's nothing I can do for him"", and hurries off.  Everyone starts crying.  HELLO?  CPR Anyone?

This is the most hilarious scene I have ever seen. He is just falling and screaming and flailing his arms. I laughed so hard and long my mom started crying.

And in the biggest hosing in the history of the Academy Awards, Ronald McDonald gets snubbed for best supporting actor.

Well, it isn't. Actually it is almost indescribably awful. Never mind the E.T. cloning job (similar in a way to the roomful of hideous, botched Ripley clones in ""Alien Resurrection"".) Don't even think twice about the incredible product placement. Those things are too well known to need discussion. What makes this thing so abominable is that the characters are so shallow and the script so idiotic that it's almost impossible to think that the people emoting before the cameras (I won't pollute my keyboard by calling it ""acting"") didn't realize what cultural sewage they were in up to their hips (or, in Jade's case, knees.)

Truth be told, I found this filmed chunk of vapid stupidity to be so bad that I couldn't watch it in one sitting. I think the fimmakers were deliberately trying to see what they could get away with, and this insult was the result.

I have no idea what motivated these people to sign up. Being in this did nothing for Calegory professionally, and I'm sure Jonathan Ward wished he'd never signed on the line. I'm sure these two are quite successful today in their chosen fields, but whenever the Ur-'80s totally rad older brother appeared toting his all-but-obligatory skateboard or the disabled kid with  hair like aluminum rolled-in and spoke in his grating, irritating squeal, all I could think was, ""You putz.""

325661,1,6301216210,"At the end of the day, even bad publicity is publicity after all. I guess that McDonalds and Coca Cola must believe that phrase, because ""Mac And Me"" hardly can be considered a movie. It's more like a 95 minutes commercial, and an awful one for that matter. Not only this is one of the most blatant rip-offs in movie history, but it's also a poor movie in every aspect.

Even the music (composed by Alan Silvestri, an usually great composer) sounds uninspired and formulaic, and that's the highlight of the movie. ""Mac And Me"" tried to steal E.T.'s formula: a single mother (or divorced, who cares) and her sons meet a little alien, who's lost in the Earth. The little creature makes a special connection with the younger boy. The little Alien has special powers. And, oh by the way, he and his family can only survive if they drink Coca Cola. He can dance if you take him to a McDonalds, as well.

This movie has a lot of awful issues that avoid the connection with the viewer: first, the plot is silly, uninspired, not original at all, boring, pathetic. And then there are the creatures. It's impossible to care about these ""Aliens"" when every time they appear on screen all you can think is ""hey, that's an ugly puppet"" or ""that rubber mask is ridiculous"".

The characters are poorly developed, every single character is like a collection of walking cliches and stereotypes, it's hard to care about a bunch of underwritten, one dimensional characters. But the worst thing about ""Mac And Me"" is that the filmmakers tried to emotionally manipulate the viewers with ""cute, emotional"" scenes, and in the process, they tried to sell us a burger and a Coke. And the final scene is just pathetic: the aliens become U.S. citizens. Oh, I guess that the entire Universe is willing to travel across galaxies and planets to achieve the ultimate goal: to drink Coca Colas, dance in McDonalds, and of course, to become an U.S. Citizen.

But it's so much more.  In an age where we are over-quick to over-praise cold-hearted films like ""Godfather"", ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""The Lion King"", ""Mac and Me"" stands out as a movie with a heart, something sadly missing in today's filmgoing world.
""Mac and Me"" was where I first understood that aliens did not have to be the bloodthirsty monsters of ""Alien"", ""Spaced Invaders"" and ""Invaders from Mars"" - they could be our friends.  ""E.T."" may have had a similar message, but that flying-bike scene was just too reckless. . .kids could hurt themselves trying to copy it.  ""Mac and Me"" was wholesome and friendly.
Perhaps I am the only member of the population who feels this movie is more than ready for a DVD roll-out, or possible theatrical rerelease.  Perhaps I am the only one who cries, even today, on what must be my thirtieth viewing on a cassette that has long since passed the point of audio/visual clarity.  Perhaps I am the only one who still feels that movies need a heart.
I hope not.",1081209600,7,1318,4.489539748953975
325666,1,6301216210,"If one were to set out on the conceit of volubly explaining the macabre masterpiece of gut-wrenching jocundity that is Mac and Me, you would indubitably exhaust the bounds of your vocabulary in the process.  Mac and Me verily competes with the most exemplary of films that manage to agglutinate equal parts of horror and comedy.  The only problem is that all of this is unintentional.  Mac and Me is the soulless eventuate progeny of a small coterie of conspiring corporations who attempted to deftly base a 90 minute commercial on Steven Spielberg's Hassidic Holiday classic E.T.  Now, I'll freely admit that E.T. blew like a Trenton hooker for a Singapore Sling and a crooked smile, but Mac and Me defies the conception of just how schlocky and fraudulent a film can be (more so than E.T.).  The aim here was pure profit, and the splay-legged perpetrators of this film spread their cavernous  orifices incomprehensibly wide in order to facilitate the rapacious reaming they received at the behest of their financers.  Had the commercial aspirations of Mac and Me succeeded, they would have made the national grosses of E.T. look like Spielberg spinning his baby-seal-eyed dreidel for matzo balls.
So there's this wheel-chair-bound Aryan rollerpig named Andy the peg-legged mental defective who's got this terrific-sized Mongoloid skull.  The trepanation ensues when his maladjusted family makes a pilgrimage to San Fran where they can participate in an immeasurably humorous cycle of comedic situations that manage to retain their Christian nobility and family appeal - which means none of that promoting of salacious decadence where half-clad harpies sell their God-given twatty pelvic beards for inguinal stimulation on the m-tee-vee.  Suffice to say, homoeroticism, hilarity, and libidinous boyhood reverie follow, respectively.  So the mysterious alien creature (MAC, oh you bet your ass its clever) bobsleds his pock-marked spine into oncoming traffic where he is discovered by our lovable stumpy-legged hero, Andy.  What follows is enough charming, thought provoking humor and witty dialogue to placate the most ardent Samuel Beckett aficionados.  There's a myriad of things to enjoy here, like the synergistic chemistry of Toulouse Lautrec in a wheel chair and the deracinated Mac - the repugnant phallic monster from planet sh*thole.  Then there's the whistling, oh my god, I can't believe I nearly forgot to tell you of the mighty fine whistling (which sounds vaguely similar to the huffs and heaves of a constricting sphincter.  Oooooooweeeeeeeeee that's good fun!)  From the opening shot of a planet that resembles the tonsured head of Michael Stipe to the terpsichorean dance routine that breaks out (like a foul plague of inconceivable pestilence), this movie sufficiently beats you into submission, and when the final credits roll the cast cues read like the docket at Nuremberg.  But defendants of this film invariably resort to the duplicitous claim that though Mac and Me may be an unoriginal masturbatory exercise in corporate frotteurism, they believe the film to possess a heart of gold.  And while I sincerely doubt the verity of such a hyperbolic claim, I do know it was driven by some kind of currency.  They also attempt to traduce you into thinking that this movie is pabulum for children who are handicapped (handicapable, non-omnifunctional, whatever trite appellation you assign to the lil' nipple nibblers), that it compels them to try and succeed.  It indeed does prove that if you are an untalented paraplegic with a complexion like a Kaiser roll and a haircut like a member of Supertramp, you too can capsize your own piece of celluloid dross.  By the way, to the people who feel the corporate proselytizing does not detract from the movie:  when every conceivable event revolves around the opportune placement of a product (in deep monotonous voice: ""say Jim, where the hell can we place this towering Valvoline billboard so it isn't conspicuous or as imperious as blatantly imploring them to buy the product?"" or ""hey, how's about Coca-Cola serves as an efficacy to the extinction of the alien race""), it tends to draw attention to itself.
I envision a future where criminal offenders are deported to an isolated isthmus flanked by an endless queue of barbed wire and encompassed by sex-starved agitated sharks in a large sea of human waste, stained suppositories, and Magic Johnson's used prophylactics.  On this truculent plantation and reformatory will reside a large formless building.  Inside this edifice (aptly titled Aushwitz fun camp) will be a theater with a series of noxious zyklon B dispatching shower nosels appendaged to the ceiling, a floor scoured with farragos of scarabs and scorpions and june bugs that give you prostate cancer, the faint aroma of carrion from the sanguinary maxipads under the seats, and an unfortunately large screen that will forever play Mac and Me on a loop that will continue until you've learned your lesson.  Beware.",1074816000,15,4997,5.17888198757764
325667,5,6301216210,"I would just like to say in Mac and Me's defence, that purpose of the moive was not to be an E.T. rip off. It was to should young childeren that even if you are disabled like Jade Calegory is that that shouldn't stop you from enejoying life. Plus the director gave half of the money made from the film to a childerens charity!
I know all of this as I have the original copies of the Mac and me scripting,cast info, film synopsis and the films purpose package that Stewart Rafill used.
So before you go and write this movie off, think about why it was created and also think about the actor Jade Calegory who has to spend his whole life in a wheelchair. It was to help disabled kids feel better about life not just an E.T. rip off.",1064707200,6,730,4.147887323943662

Very, very very bad E.T. rip-off with tons of horrendous acting, bad script, poor pacing, bad special effects and not to mention the insulting Mcdonald's dance sequence ( almost made me vomit).

It's almost worth watching just because you don't really believe something like this could be made. Watch it if you like train wrecks.,1043971200,12,422,4.4935064935064934
325683,5,6301216210,"Steven Spielberg could learn a few lessons from ""Mac and Me"".  While someone felt the need to re-release ""E.T."" as a 20th anniversary edition, one can only stop to think - where is our theatrical re-release of ""Mac and Me""?
Next year marks the 15th anniversary of Stewart Raffill's ode to a boy and his alien, and this reviewer hopes that ""Mac and Me"" receives the special edition DVD treatment and theatrical re-release it so richly deserves.
""Mac and Me"" picks up where the movie ""E.T."" left off.  After a tragic accident, Elliott is now confined to wheelchair and E.T. has changed his name to Mac (magical and cool?).  Don't expect to see the cute and cuddly E.T. in this movie, not only has he changed his name, but now he has taken on a new appearance... now he's even MORE adorable.
The relationship between Mac and Elliott is genuine and touching.  The story consists of numerous trips to McDonald's, an on-the-edge-of-your-seat skateboarding chase, and a truly delightful group break-dancing scene.  Stewart Raffill and Steve Feke's screenplay is whitty, emotional and leaves you wanting more.
Shortly after the release of ""Mac and Me"", Raffill received bad reviews for this film.  Some critics called Raffill a ""hack"" and an ""overly-commercial filmmaker"".  Those same critics called his movie, ""a 90-minute McDonald's commercial"", ""absurd film-making"" and ""an `E.T.' rip-off"".
Fortunately, for all of us fans of ""Mac and Me"", Stewart Raffill got the last laugh, when just three years later, he directed the successful sequel,  ""Mannequin 2: On the Move"".

325685,1,6301216210,"Mac and Me is simply put the worst film ever made. It sucks so bad my reaction is not one of disappointment but one of utter psychotic rage, nausea and hysterics. There is an indescribable form of excitement that shudders through my body when I witness Mac shoot straight up the wall with that vacuum cleaner...or when our endangered hero rides downhill with his handicapped friend to an almost certain loveable and fun exchange after a comfortable landing. Oh how delightful...and don't give me that silly ""It's just a kids' movie"" either, so was The Wizard of Oz, Charlie and Chocolate Factory, Labyrinth, the Dark Crystal and Something Wicked This Way Comes and they don't use cheap devices like modern cultural hooks and product placement. The clichs are countless from the wheel-chair bound protagonist to the ""We'll be back (let's hope for a sequel...keep your fingers crossed, tee-hee-hee)"" ending.

Even though Mac and Me is the worst film in history, it might fall down to the three or four spot were it not for one specific and enduring scene which is easily the worst piece of cocaine influenced garbage ever. The scene starts with our friends pulling up to a McDonald's restaurant. This is the McDonald's that Wesley Willis had been singing about. In the parking lot we see a fully choreographed sequence of break dancers in some fluorescent clothes and stripes on the sides of their flat top hair-dos. It's not bad enough that I despise the existence of McDonalds in our diet as a culture but that we actually thought that dancing, dressing and acting like this was cool. I still hold out hope that we don't but Mac and Me has yet to break the top 100 worst films ever on the Internet Movie Database site so I continue to fear for the worst...but I must soldier on. As the dramedy unfolds we see that our handicapped little boy character has decided it's a bad idea to bring an alien into this idiot's paradise and instead dresses him as a teddy bear so he can enjoy the shenanigans with everyone else...and boy do the shenanigans ensue. In addition to the people outside, everyone inside of McDonald's is also dancing...in fact you'd think they'd served ecstasy. As the dancing around him becomes too much for our alien hero to handle, he decides to screw being caught and dissected by the government...'cause it's time to f**ckin' boogie! Our teddy bear disguised Mac (now passing off as a robotic teddy bear?) does a full flip into the air and proceeds to get the whole place even more involved in burning off those calories. It is enough to make one kill their family and pets and burn their home to the ground. Other than that I have no strong feelings on the matter.",1006819200,17,2685,4.688559322033898
