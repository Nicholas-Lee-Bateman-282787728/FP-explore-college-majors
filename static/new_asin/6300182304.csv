218547,5,6300182304,"This movie was wonderful from all aspects.  Not only did it tell the story of one of Country Music's greatest stars, but it did it honestly.  Sissy Spacek and Tommy Jee Jones were perfectly casted in this movie as Loretta and her husband Doolittle.  Beverly D'Angelo was good as Patsy Cline as well.  It was refreshing that she and Sissy sang their own songs on this film, and that there weren't dubbed over voices.  Sissy Spacek is one of the best actresses to come along in my lifetime and certainly Coal Miner's Daughter was one of her finest performances.  A must have for any serious film collector.",973036800,3,604,4.598130841121495
218548,5,6300182304,"After reading the book about 4 times I can say with a reasonable amount of certainty that it is a little better than the movie, but not by much.  They  are both excellent.  Following her life from Butcher Holler all the way to  international stardom, this is a compelling look at an interesting woman,  not just a country star.  In other words, it is very much worth watching  even if you are not a country fan.  Long live Loretta!",967939200,,431,4.367088607594937
218549,5,6300182304,"I went out and bought this movie because I enjoyed it so much. And more recently, I found and read Loretta's biography because I loved the movie so much. The movie is surprisingly true to the book.
I love Loretta's story  because she was a real underdog. Raised in abject poverty in the Kentucky  Mountains, she rises above it all, bit by bit, with her husband's love and  support.
Doolittle (husband) bought her a guitar one year because he told  her, ""I like the way you sing."" I've heard that the best  marriages are ones where the spouse is our number one cheerleader and  that's what Doolittle Lynn did for Loretta. He cheered her on. He supported  her, loved her and believed in her.
The movie also touches on his  shortcomings, but in the book, Loretta makes it clear that the good he did  outweighed the bad and their marriage and relationship can not possibly be  judged by anyone outside of the relationship.
Loretta is a strong woman -  even as a 14 year old she speaks her mind and isn't afraid of much.
What  do I love about this movie? It shows the infinite possibilities of life and  that any obstacle can be overcome through persistence.
The acting by  Spacek, Jones, D'Angelo, Helm and the entire cast is superior. The  characters are very real - not Hollywood mock-ups, but real people.
It  is probably one of my top three favorite movies of all time. It is a  treasure.",956880000,4,1388,4.51004016064257
218550,5,6300182304,Sissy Spacek was Incredible as Loretta Lynn.&Tommy Lee Jones was also very convincing. Beverly D'angelo was also very solid in this film. To Bad Todays Country Artists Aren't Made to watch Real COuntry Music being  Made&done.cuz the music now is so Watered down. Loretta Lynn&Patsy  Cline are Pioneers of Country Music. You Respect their Battle&Success  even more after Viewing this film.,955152000,,388,5.327868852459017
218551,4,6300182304,"This brilliant character study features two astounding performances by Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones. Spacek is Brilliant as the 'first lady of country music' Loretta Lynn, she is very convincing, she even did her own  singing. Tommy Lee Jones also shines as Loretta's husband who pushed her  into making a career out of her singing. Great insights into the country  music industry. Great performances, attention to detail and a real life  rags-to-riches story make it interesting and entertaining. The pace kind of  drags in the second half, but ultimately a satisfying experience. From a  scale of 1-10 I give this film an 8!",953942400,,630,5.009615384615385
218552,5,6300182304,Coal Miner's Daughter is a well written story.  For a person who really doesn't listen to country music at all. Will enjoy this movie with its down home country feeling.,930268800,,169,4.633333333333334

218599,5,6300182304,"The story of Loretta Lynn is quite a remarkable unique American story. She began her life in Bunker Hollow, Kentucky with a large family in a log cabin. Loretta Lynn was beautifully played and well-deserved Academy Award winner, Sissy Spacek. She embodied Loretta's spirit and voice. The story begins with a young Loretta and an older Doolittle Lynn, a soldier. Levon Helm played Loretta's coal mining father. The British film director, Michael Apted, filmed on location in Tennessee and Kentucky too. I just loved to see the Ryman Auditorium (the original home of the Grand Ole Opry) in Nashville, Tennessee. The Grand Ole Opry moved to a larger space in the early seventies but the Ryman is still there.

I was fortunate to see Loretta Lynn singing ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" at the Grand Ole Opry in 2008. Tommy Lee Jones should have earned and Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his performance as Doolittle Lynn. Beverly D'Angelo should have earned an Academy Award nomination for Actress in a Supporting Role for playing Patsy Cline. I loved seeing William Sanderson (Larry from Newhart) in the film.
 I loved the special features especially seeing President George H.W. Bush praising the film at the American Film Institute in 1989. There are interviews with Tommy Lee Jones and Loretta Lynn. The British film director, Michael Apted, interviewed Loretta Lynn at her home. Loretta comes across real, candid and lovely. She hasn't forgotten her coal mining roots or her family history. She is quite proud of her ancestry and her home is open to tourists from around the world.

The special features celebrate the film's silver anniversary. Sissy Spacek did a commendable job in becoming Loretta Lynn. The film is a must see if you love a great film overall. The love story between Loretta and Doolittle was quite complicated and controversial. She was only 14 years old when she married him. Their marriage would last 48 years until his death in 1996. They had six children together.",1520467200,,1995,4.967065868263473

218944,5,6300182304,"Loretta Lynn, one of the most famous female country singers in the world. Born in Butcher Holler, Tennessee, married at 15, had six children, and became famous world wide.

Loretta had a rough life, lots of love, enough found, but that was it. Married young to Dolittle, who loved her, but he was a back country boy with little education. However, he knew Loretta had talent, and he pushed her and the music producers. Her early music was someone else's , and she did not do well with them. She started writing songs. Her first well known song, 'Honky Tonk Girl', and it is still memorable today. At the beginning if their marriage she and do moved to Bellingham, Washington. It was here her music started, and they visited every radio station across the US. Loretta made herself a name, and Do helped to make her famous. She was frequently confused with Kitty Wells, and she needed to find her own style.

Her daughter says Loretta has the Kentucky twang with the West Coast beat, that is the sound that made her famous. She hooked up with other singers and they traveled across the country. Every year, she became more well known. 'Coal Miner's Daughter' may be her most famous, then, 'Don't Come Home ADrinkin With Lovin On Your Mind'. Real life songs that everyone could identify. A beautiful country voice, fame and fortune, and Loretta stuck by her man. Dolittle was her only husband, and she loved him. Her children are still her loves.

This film with Sissy Spacek follows her life. Sissy became Loretta, and they became great friends. Patsy Cline became a great friend, and helped her with her stage presence and other style issues. She became a member of The Grand Old Opry, and a star was born. This was such a beautiful film, filled with the love and life of Loretta Lynn.

219213,5,6300182304,"I have always enjoyed this wonderful rags-to-riches movie based upon actual accounts. This film tells the story of an Appalachian family and one of their musically inclined daughters, Loretta. Her father is a coal miner and they feel deep in their hearts that's all their people will ever be: coal miners. The teen eventually is courted by a returned soldier and marries him. Between raising babies and keeping house, she sings folk songs and learns to play a guitar. Her husband soon realizes he may have a cash cow in his young wife and encourages her to record on vinyl. With his moral support, the young woman becomes a famous singer, but will fame be the downfall of their simple values, even their marriage?",1473811200,2,713,4.758064516129032

219216,5,6300182304,"This is a really great movie.  Sissy Spacek won an academy award as best actress and performed her own songs.  This movie made me a permanent fan of Sissy Spacek.  The first review I read on this site was that of Benjamin Burgraff dated 2005.  He stated that one does not really be need be a fan of Loretta Lynn to love this movie.  I completely agree.  I do happen to be a fan, but I also agree with Mr. Burgraff.

My favorite country singer from the past is Patsy Cline.  Beverly D'Angelo plays Patsy Cline.  I enjoyed her portrayal very much, but not so much her singing.  She also did her own singing.  I certainly respect her for her effort.  I would never have even tried.

One does not need to be a fan of either Loretta Lynn or country music to completely enjoy this movie.  I happen to be both, but I truly do not believe it is necessary.  Thank You...",1471910400,,861,4.196319018404908

219230,5,6300182304,"Great film!  I'm about as far away from being a fan of country music as it's possible to get, but that's hardly the point.  This film is fascinating on many levels.  Sissy Spacek easily deserved her Academy Award for her portrayal of the legendary Loretta Lynn, and all the other players in this production are first-rate.  The production values are on a similar level, with on-location filming in Kentucky and Tennessee lending an authentic depiction of mid-20th-century Appalachia.  There have been many ""biopics"" of this sort, but few as masterfully made as this one.  Hugely entertaining, not rarefied cinema by any means, but if it were, would it be true to its subject?  ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" certainly is.  You'll not be disappointed.",1471132800,11,743,5.032786885245901

219392,5,6300182304,"I had lost my dvd of ""Coal Miner's Daighter"" that I watch several times a year, especially on my birthday.  Im love Loretta Lynn so much I even tried to get my rabbi to let me skip Kol Nidre because it was the one and only time she sang at the Warner Theater her in Torrington, CT.  Of course , he said no, no matter how many times I said ""But Rabbi, it's Loretta Lynn!""  I went to Kol Nidre and learned I missed a wonderful concert.  Loretta is special and so is Sissy Spacek.  Her performance is phenominal.  Whether one lives alone or needs a family film, put this one on.  I usually don't check the bonuses, but they were just as exceptional, as the film , bhecause,those involved with making the film, gave me more for the next time I watch it.  And I agree with Loretta, Tommy Lee Jones diserved as much recoignition as everyone else!",1462147200,2,840,4.238993710691824

219459,5,6300182304,"I always like movies about musicions and this one is a fine one too.
Sissy Spacek was always stayed in my collections and be watched from time to time. My best is <BADLAND> and <CARRIE>,
It was kind of amazing that she acted from 15 to all the way up to maybe like 40s.
Not like other musicians, it was not her intention to be a singer. It was her husband that bought her a guitar and when he figures out that she sings well, she brought her to this bar and asks the band to give her a chance to sing just one song. Everybody loved her singing and she ends up with sing another.
Then they recorded in a studio. The husband Tommy Lee Jones took his time and sends the record to every DJs in the radio broadcast.
They eventually appeares in the Cashbox chart and slowly she becomes famous.
I think she owes a lot to her husband Tommy.
She on the other hand leanrs that she truely enjoys singing in public.
But in one point, she crashed down. Maybe it was all so quick and she couldn't go on like that.
After a short break, she goes back to her singing career.
The movie ends up with her singing Coar Miner's Daugher. It was a beautiful ending.
She grew up with a poor family. Her father was a miner and always covered with black faced after the work.
Sissy's husband was also a miner too before Sissy becomes famous.
The story doesn't have a major crisis but the music, the effort of Tommy to make his wife known for the audience are so good to watch.
It was a memorable night for me knowing this film.",1458345600,3,1500,4.158075601374571

219481,5,6300182304,"This movie deserved re-watching from time to time. It captures perfectly the hard-scrabble life of a West
Virginia coal miner and his family. Then it explores the development of Loretta Lyn's great singing career as well-portrayed by Sissy Spacek. Sissy did all her own singing in the film, and captured Loretta Lynn's personality and singing style beautifully. Spacek believably plays Loretta from 14 through adult-hood. Tommy Lee Jones was excellent as Mooney, Loretta's  husband, who was the person that kicked off Loretta's singing career at the beginning. Beverly D'Angelo does a fine turn as Patsy Cline, and she also performed her own versions of Patsy's songs. This movie deserves re-watching on a regular basis -- every nuance in it is portrayed beautifully.",1457308800,,767,5.286885245901639

219983,5,6300182304,"Back in 1980, I went to see the movie Coal Miner's Daughter in the theater.  I'm not sure why, since I didn't actually go to the movies much back then.

I at first thought the story was made up, thought it was a nice story, and was very touched by the movie.  When I found out it was a true story, however, it became my favorite movie of all time.  The story is simply astounding - how an impoverished country girl from a small town in the hills of Kentucky rose to be the Queen of Country Music and a Country Legend.

I didn't know about the Law of Attraction and Universal Laws back then, but lately I've been thinking about this movie and it became clear to me that Loretta Lynn was without knowing it a magnet for manifestation.  Let me explain my take on this, from what I have gleaned from the movie:

Loretta grew up in a poor household, but there was much love in the home.  Love is the highest vibration there is.
Loretta was grateful for everything she got.  Gratitude is also an extremely high vibration.
Loretta was conspicuously devoid of negative emotion such as bitterness and anger over her circumstances.  Those emotions can block manifestation.
We know from the Law of Attraction that vibrating in Love and Gratitude is a powerful manifesting force.

Loretta had to work very hard, but the planets also aligned for her as it were.  The Law of Attraction doesn't necessarily dump things in your lap; you still have to do necessary work.  The ""perfect storm"" of circumstances happened so she wound up in the national spotlight.  She simply allowed these events to unfold (Law of Allowing) and took inspired action as it was needed.  She had a very strong supporter (her husband) who cheered her on all the way, whom she attracted into her life, marrying at 13!

She simply put one foot in front of the other, not thinking ""this is impossible, it will never happen"" (a manifestation stopping thought).  Or if she did entertain those thoughts, the more prominent thoughts had to have been of success, and visualizing it.

Here is another important point:  Loretta truly loves and appreciates her fans, thinking of them as friends.  She loves her family and wanted a better life for them.  This brought to her ample compensation (abundance) for her efforts.  She is much beloved in return.

She had a very strong desire to be a singer.  Because of this, she was able to write lyrics and melody and sing chart topping hits without any training - no vocal training, no music training.  She taught herself to play the guitar!  Her presence on stage is very graceful in old videos on youtube - she looks so comfortable and not nervous at all.  She looks like she is simply enjoying herself.

She was also adept at taking care of herself - not to put a spoiler out there for those who may not have seen the movie, but at one point she doesn't want to go on stage (she knew her limits).  She knew she was tired and needed a break.  She was pushed to go on anyway and collapsed during the performance.

The story is so powerful that Sissy Spacek won best actress that year for her brilliant portrayal of Loretta Lynn.  Tommy Lee Jones was catapulted in his career playing Loretta's husband in the movie.

The 25th Anniversary Edition of the movie came out ten years ago, and I have just ordered my own copy so I can see the movie again.  After 35 years and my new insights about how the Universal Laws work, the movie is even more of a favorite than ever.",1428969600,,3461,4.4848

220240,5,6300182304,bought as a stocking stuffer for my wife. The Blu-ray version was cheaper than the DVD which was an added plus. Great movie. Shows a lot of her history and aspects of coal country. Sissy Spacek nailed the accent which is not easy to do if you know actual people from that region of the country.

He was very impressed when I told him that Sissy Spacek sang all her own songs in the movie. I didn't realize until I read the credits this time around that Beverly D'Angelo (Chevy Chase's long-suffering wife in the ""Vacation"" movies) also sang all her own songs as Patsy Cline in this movie. Sissy Spacek is an incredible actress and she played this part very well.

220318,5,6300182304,"Loretta and Doolittle (Doo) were a young couple from Kentucky. While Loretta was reticent and diffident, Doo, the antithesis, was brash and bumptious. Doo marveled at Loretta's dulcet singing voice, and he wondered if others would too. So they go to the local honky-tonk bars and taverns and the crowds do adore her. Doo was the motivating force behind her and a constant source of encouragement to her confidence and self-esteem. They spend some time on the road, on an itinerant schedule visiting one radio station after another throughout Kentucky and Tennessee. Traveling much as a politician, going from county seat to county seat, to get their message out. With their ebullience and blarney, they are adroit at currying favor and cajoling disc jockeys to play a recording of Loretta on the air. After many months of peregrination, she eventually appeared on a hits chart at number 14. This will gain her entry for a performance at the Grand Ole Opry.

220442,5,6300182304,"Love the realistic portrayal of poor country life.  Hard work, love and family.  This movie feels like a trip home for many of us of a certain age. I well remember spending time at my grandmother's house: she kept an outhouse, chamber pot, coal oil lamp & well just in case. We drank water (from the.new sink) using the well dipper. It tasted better. Grew her own fruits and vegetables. Had a smokehouse. No a/c. No TV. Hot as blue blazes in the Louisiana summer? Yep. Boring or sad? Never. Great memories of a simpler life. ""Nothing lives there anymore,"" but I go often to pick daffodils or sit under the pear trees with my memories. When I can't make it, I watch Coal Miner's Daughter.

220453,5,6300182304,"Loretta Lynn etched a gallery of memories in my childhood, what with my dad having had the radio perpetually tuned in to big band stuff and to country music stuff. Back in the 1970's and '80s, I'll say Loretta Lynn, controversial and groundbreaking, ruled the roost, never mind that it was Tanya Tucker on whom I crushed on. Anyway, I'm not one for biographical films, so it took me a bit to sit down to Coal Miner's Daughter, and that was a few days ago when it aired on TCM. What the hell was I waitin' on?

I am gobsmacked at the awesomeness of Sissy Spacek. Given, other than in Carrie, I hadn't seen much of her. But I am blown away by her performance - which is indelible - as Loretta. In the poverty-stricken mining community of Butcher Hollow, somewhere in the hind end of Kentucky, hard livin' sucks you dry from the day you were born to the day that you die. Ain't much in the way of prospects: the coal mine, the moonshine, or movin' on down the line. Loretta Lynn - to quote her from that one song - was born a coal miner's daughter in a cabin on a hill in Butcher Hollow. And I couldn't help but marvel at Sissy Spacek's ability to portray her from age 13 on to, what, 35 or so? Spacek inhabits this role. And she convinces us her character is at this or that age without the crutch of CGI or fancy make-up but rather by posture and mannerism. For most of the movie, she goes without make-up which I always think is a brave choice for an actor.

Loretta Lynn, who exerted some influence in the making of this film, didn't sugarcoat the more troubling aspects of her life. The plot charts a familiar route: the rags-to-riches story, the personal pitfalls, that sense of the artist being consumed by her worshipping fans, the backstage meltdowns, the triumphant return... You've seen this before.

What sets this film apart? There's Michael Apted's surehanded direction, his knack for capturing that rich sense of place - in this instance, the poor rural south. There's irony in that it took an Englishman to shine such an authentic light on this stark slice of Americana. It is damn hard livin' in Butcher Hollow. Coal Miner's Daughter honors its subject matter even as Apted keeps it tethered to reality. There's almost this documentary vibe, so good is Apted at drawing real, natural performances from his cast, and the cinematography is brilliant.

More than anything else, the movie lives and breathes thru the pitch perfect performances of Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones. Yeah, man, let's not forget about Tommy Lee Jones who, as ""Doolittle Lynn,"" turns in the second-best acting of his career (after The Fugitive). Jones adds so many layers to Doolittle, who was a complicated cat or, put another way, a real flesh-and-blood human being. Doolittle is at times despicable and downright mean and just no good, but then he turns around and shows his kindness and his smarts and how hard he works and his absolute pride at Loretta's God-given gift. Flaws and all, Doolittle is the love of Loretta's life and the demanding driving force of her career.

How remarkable is it that Spacek sings the songs herself? Or that Loretta Lynn fought for Spacek to do the singing? (Because the studio suits weren't so inclined.) You'll have to wait half the movie before you hear her, though. Before the dazzle, the movie reveals, in matter-of-fact fashion, insights into the culture and spirit of the place what raised Loretta. We get to know her as a child helping to raise her siblings, and then as a skittish child bride at 13, and then as a young mother of four. It's a prolonged peek into Loretta's impoverished upbringing. But we note that, despite that she and her brothers and sisters were often left wanting when it came to material things, they weren't ever deprived in the ways of being loved and nurtured and being raised right and having that sense of belonging. Levon Helm, who really isn't in the film that much, is quite good as Loretta's caring father who only wanted the best for her yet finally standing aside to let her fly away. My favorite Loretta Lynn song, no surprise, is the film's title. The lyrics to ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" simple yet evocative, distills its singer to her bare essence. Listen to the words and you'll know what Loretta Lynn is all about.

""We were poor but we had love
That's the one thing that daddy made sure of
He shoveled coal to make a poor man's dollar""

You don't have to like country music to appreciate this movie. Sure, it doesn't blaze a new trail. You can guess the story's trajectory. But it's such a well-made film. And Sissy Spacek and Tommy Lee Jones create magic onscreen. And Sissy, crazy mimic, sings Loretta's songs so very well. And let's not never mind Beverly D'Angelo who terrifically covers Patsy Cline's classics. There's warmth and good taste and an intelligence and a keen empathy in how Apted approaches this material. And I love that things sort of happen in a low key way. There's no trumpeting the big moments. It's like real life. Sissy Spacek ended up winning the Academy Award for her role as Loretta Lynn, and that's real life, too.",1410220800,,5113,4.612087912087912

220455,3,6300182304,"Saw this movie in a theatre when it first came out and was flabbergasted. Saw it again last Saturday night and was less impressed. Sissy is cute, and she gets Loretta Lynn across, but I had to suspend my disbelief a little more consciously when it came to her accent. At least she didn't method act, nor did the even better Jones who stole the movie. And, I thought Beverly D. was dreadful as the great Patsy Cline. The mention of her death is given almost nothing in this film, so I disrespect that. L.L. comes across as a good old girl entertainer who filled a needed role in country music, but no way was she a singer like some of the greats. l also thought it was dumb and self conscious for Spacek, and even moreso D'Angelo, to do their own singing. As I'm fond of saying and am self satisfied to state, having first realized this in high school, just because you can sing doesn't mean people want to listen to you. So listen up singers, including American Idleists, do you truly believe anyone would listen to you of their own volition? There's no need to strain to meet the consensus taste if you don't agree.",1409961600,,1116,4.3701923076923075

220493,5,6300182304,"I saw this utterly adult film in the theater as a child, and, on some level, I believe it set the stage for my love of drama. I prefer it to Altman's panaramic ""Nashville,"" a near equally extraordinary film with a heartbreaking ending that captured time and place in a literary manner. Both rise above the conventions of the mere 'country' film, but ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" offers a deep, unsentimental glimpse of one woman's life.

Sissy Spacek's and Michael Apted's work has never been better, and I am including Terence Mailick's"" Badlands"" for Spacek, who had the ability to capture naivety in a sweet, hardwon manner; Loretta's evolution throughout is undergirded and hastened by her husband, given life with a realistic, honest to time and place performance by Tommy Lee Jones, who had only begun to take his place in cinema history.

As I mentioned I saw this film as a boy, and it stayed with me. While I did not I watched it as an adult, and the nuances came to life. Another 'odd' film for a child to like was the more popular ""The Graduate,"" by Mike Nichols -- on TV. I somehow identified with Hoffman's portrait of lonely Benjamin Braddock underwater. I did not not completely understand each, but I was not conscious of that, and the pacing, the quality acting, and set decoration in these films left their mark.

I will always remember Spacek posed in front of that blanket.",1408665600,,1388,4.680327868852459

Unfortunately, as someone elses review foretold/warned the COMMENTARY by Sissy Spaceck (IS listed/displayed in the EXTRAS) but only returns to MENU and apparently there is NO COMMENTARY on this 25th Anniversary Edition.  Apparently the manufacturer screwed up on a HUGE batch of these DVDs.  Never the less, it is the commentary that is missing NOT THE FILM.  The film is truly excellent with Sissy Spaceck at Loretta Lynn, her perhaps second role after playing a hillbilly (once or twice) on The Walton's and hand picked for the part by Loretta Lynn as the interview states.  Sissy Spaceck sings MANY of Loretta Lynn's hit songs in this film. Tommy Lee Jones is great at her husband Doolittle and Beverly D'Angelo is wonderful as Patsy Cline!  Highly recommended.

220735,1,6300182304,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

 Coal Miner's Daughter is the type of film constructed that seems to recreate meager events as important, but in reality they are nothing more than fabricated fluff which attempt to move us in some way.

What we have here is an endeavor to create a ""bliblical epic"" about a disproportionate life of poverty. There's no Marxist analogy though, just an acceptance of lousy conditions under the brutal and greedy mine companies. The noble life of poverty is supposed to make us side with the righteous Loretta Lyn, played like a spiritless doll by Sissy Spacek.

Enter the ignorant young girl who dreams of a better life. She meets up with an abusive drunk loser and falls in love. Simplistic, even idiotic. Such are the films of Hollywood.  She's vicious at heart, loathing both her brothers and sisters, even her parents, who are warped by an infatuation with Appalachian Christianity, complete with moon shining hypocrisy, or blood feud swaggering, etc. Her claim to fame, shown in an uncritical light, is that she can sing like an injured cat.

What appeal this would have to intelligent people is beyond me, obviously it is made for the masses, who cry at such nefarious laid-back stories, that are ideal for showcasing lies which manipulate emotions. It's biased, and only casts Loretta Lyn as a benign genius who can sing and act like a saint, everything really human about her, including her faults, which would make the story interesting, is left out.",1391385600,,1499,4.881889763779528

Yes, we love our kids and want to do for them, but how many would work so hard to insure that the needs of their families are met?  How many children would be satisfied with a pair of shoes or a dress? Good to love kids, but anymore we mind wash them to expect the best just to be handed to them.

Spacek does her own singing, as does Beverly D'Angelo in a magnificent supporting role as Patsy Cline.  Spacek took an Oscar for her sensitive, vulnerable, brash but nave portrayal of Loretta Lynn.  Watch especially for the moment when, following a pretty serious tiff with her man, Loretta composes a song about the disagreement, ""You Ain't Woman Enough to Take My Man.""",1388620800,,653,4.954128440366972

Although it is listed on the disc's features list, the Commentary With Sissy Spacek & Director Michael Apted is not there. What gives with that Universal?? I very easily could have done without the George Bush Sr. Salute To AFI, but to not have on the disc the primary star's commentary is a great disappointment. I've been a long time fan of Ms. Spacek & was eagerly looking forward to her commentary. 3 stars to what could have been 5.
Also a note to Amazon: Customer Reviews should APPLY ONLY to the SPECIFIC item that the customer purchased. To see this review also being applied to other different releases, eg: Universal's 100th Anniversary copy, is flat out wrong. Lets get it together Amazon.",1374710400,4,782,4.757352941176471

221026,4,6300182304,"I will only focus on ""The Best Little Whorehouse"".  This film was a hit in 1982.  In 2003 it looks cheap and tacky like a 1970's green-shag carpeted home.

I don't think the writer-director of this film (Colin Higgins) got a firm grasp on the material.  The film caters to ""Burt Reynolds"" and makes him the focus of the story.

The play however was much better and Colin Higgins seem to of ignored what worked with the play.

It has been over 30 years since this film was released. A remake should be done.  I am hoping that maybe if its not done for a theatrical release then HBO or SHOWTIME will step up.  If they film is made right you can count on the awards coming in..

The House of ""Girls"" could be cast with well known singers.",1364256000,,735,4.23021582733813

I was born (but not raised) in KY and I think the eastern KY scenes were accurately done. People were honest and hard working back then. To me this movie is inspirational as Loretta goes to the top of country music in those days. I think the movie could have done without all the cussing by Doo but I guess it makes things more realistic.,1342915200,,431,4.204819277108434

221218,5,6300182304,"""Coal Miner's Daughter"" remains a fantastic film even 25+ years after it's debut. This true life rags-to-riches story has it all.

The film chronicles the rise of country music icon Loretta Lynn. From her youth spent in absolute poverty in the hills of Kentucky, to her stormy relationship with her husband Doolittle (Doo), to becoming a country music superstar. What I loved about ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" is that it feels like an honest portrayal of a real person, it's not a glossy fluff film along the lines of ""The Blindside"" and on the flip side it doesn't set out to tear down the person's image it's depicting like ""The Babe"".

Sissy Spacek does such an outstanding job as Loretta Lynn, you almost have to remind yourself that you're not watching the real Loretta Lynn perform some of these numbers. Tommy Lee Jones as Doo is also amazing to watch. At times you'll hate his character, and at others you have to admire his drive and determination. One of the better underrated performances of the film is given by Levon Helm (yes....the drummer/lead singer for ""The Band"") as Loretta's coal mining father. When he tells Loretta how sad he is about losing his little girl when she sets off to meet Doo in Washington state, the he feels like a thief has stolen from him the years of watching her grow, you can't help but get choked up.

On top of the fantastic perfomances, you have the stellar soundtrack. One classic country tune after another comes dripping out of the speakers and with this revised Special Addition, the soundtrack sounds better than ever.

This is a classic film and well worth adding to your collection.",1311638400,,1630,4.72887323943662

221287,5,6300182304,"Sissy Spacek won the 1980 Academy Award as Best Actress playing country music legend Loretta Lynn. Spacek was actually Loretta's first choice when asked who should play her. Based on the autobiography by Lynn, ""Coal Miners Daughter"" continues to be one of the best biopics Hollywood has ever produced. Loretta's hardships growing up in a small coal mining town in Kentucky, her marriage at 13 to the man of her dreams, the birth of her children, and her eventual stardom, are all covered nicely in this beautiful film. Tommy Lee Jones is excellent as Loretta's husband and Beverly D'Angelo is superb as Lynn's best friend and idol Patsy Cline. Both Spacek and D'Angelo also did all their own singing for the movie.
 Among the many special features on this DVD are interviews with Loretta Lynn, Sissy Spacek, and others. There is also a wonderful commentary track by Spacek and Michael Apted who directed the feature.
 The movie is a little over two hours long and comes in anamorphic widescreen.
 For lovers of country music Hollywood is currently working on a feature film about one of Loretta's best friends, Dolly Parton. The movie is expected to be released in the next two years.",1247097600,3,1184,4.851485148514851
221288,5,6300182304,"Released in 1980, ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" tells the true story of Loretta Lynn and her amazing journey from a poor Kentucky Coal Miner's daughter to the ""First Lady"" of Country music.

Let me stress that you don't have to like Country music to enjoy this movie. Heck, I'm into the heavier side of metal and the film had no problem pulling me in. As a matter of fact, I wasn't even in the mood for this type of film last night, yet after a mere 35 minutes or so I was spellbound until the end; not to mention I found myself today watching music videos of Loretta Lynn and Patsy Cline on youtube (!!).

Sissy Spacek and a young Tommy Lee Jones play Loretta and her husband, while Beverly D'Angelo has a small-but-significant role as Patsy Cline. The acting is so stellar that it seems like you're watching real people.

It's useless to cite best scenes because this is the type of of high-quality film where you just press 'play' and enjoy from beginning to end.

One segment I'd like to comment on, though, is where Loretta and her husband (Oliver ""Mooney"") come back to Kentucky from Custer, Washington, for the funeral of Loretta's dad. After the funeral Oliver points out that, if they're ever going to make it in the music biz, they have to act now and travel to all the radio stations and push her first single. They put in the time and sweat and the song -- ""Honky Tonk Girl"" -- became a breakthrough hit. What's the point? We must be sensitive to the critical times in our lives when we must step out in faith and ACT if we want to be successful in our chosen call. If Loretta and Mooney hadn't put the meddle to the peddle at that critical moment you probably wouldn't be reading this.

There are numerous other great segments, including Loretta's relationship with Patsy Cline and her moving breakdown on stage near the end.

The film runs 2 hours and 5 minutes and was filmed in Kentucky, Tennessee and Virginia.

This movie is really good and tells the story well of a gal who was born in Butcher Holler Kentucky to a poor family and was the daughter of a coal miner who earned a poor mans dollar and then she courts as well as marries at a young age a man who is older than she is wild as the dickens and then he treats her like trash but no matter what she goes through she still loves him very much and he does do a good job as her manager turning her into a well known country music star.  All of the cast in this movie all do a great job portraying the story of country music legend.  If you want to get a great movie I highly recommend this movie for your enjoyment seeing a young lady who is a great country music singer making it up to the heights of country music stardom as the Queen of country music.

Sissy Spacek won the 1980 Academy Award for Best Actress, and deservedly so. Tommy Lee Jones is also fantastic as Loretta's husband. An astounding cast beautifully directed by Michael Apted. Just a feel good film all around.

As a result of viewing this film, I even began following the career of Ms. Lynn, and read her autobiography of the same title. I guess I can now quote Ray Charles on his love of country music, ""it's the stories"". And no one can tell a story through song like Loretta.

221376,5,6300182304,"Sissy Spacek won raves and awards (including the Oscar) for her brilliant performance as country music sensation Loretta Lynn in this 1980 biopic `Coal Miner's Daughter' based on the auto-biography Lynn wrote with George Vecsey.  Chronicling her rise to fame, `Coal Miner's Daughter' serves as much more than just a canvas for Spacek's acting for the script itself is deserving of heaps of praise, following her life story with candor and authenticity, never over looking important points or focusing too lengthily on nonessential ones, this film serves as a template for all biopics to come on how to cover a persons life with grace, respect and justice.

At just thirteen years of age Loretta Webb marries hotshot Doolittle Lynn (Tommy Lee Jones in a performance that should have at least nabbed him an Oscar nomination) and quickly is thrown into a life she never imagined would be her own.  There's quickly marital problems, some due to her lack of experience `pleasing' her man, most due to Doolittle's temper, but by the sweet age of twenty she is raising four children and she's far from home.  Honing in of his wife's love for music, Doolittle decides to buy her a guitar for their anniversary one year and this sparks in her a drive to success, igniting the road they soon travel in order to make her a country music sensation.

`Coal Miner's Daughter' covers her life accurately and fulfilled, leaving no rock unturned sort-a-speak.  Littered with flawless acting on the parts of the two leads as well as Beverly D'Angelo who plays the late, great Patsy Cline not to mention the fabulous singing done by the stars themselves (I was floored, I mean they both sound amazing), this film is sure to please any fan of the biopic, anyone interested in the life story of one of country music's leading ladies or any fan of films like `Walk the Line' then this is a movie you are sure to enjoy over and over again!",1165449600,,1916,4.738738738738738
221377,5,6300182304,"Some movies are so excellent that words are insufficient. Such is the case with ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" a movie that relies on an effectively told story of Loretta Lynn to carry the film rather than flashy special effects and action. The script is brought to life by the incredible talents of the actors, most especially Sissy Spacek, in one of the best performances of her career.

""Coal Miner's Daughter"" spans the era from the late 1940s to the early 70s, focusing principally on Loretta Lynn from age 13 to her rise to fame as the best-selling female country artist. It's easy to look at Loretta's early life as an artifact of some ancient time, but in fact Loretta's life and the life of her family was quite typical in some rural areas in The United States in that era, and many of us are the children or grandchildren of similar families. This movie is thus not only the story Loretta Lynn, but is also the story of many Americans.

Sissy Spacek sang all the songs for the movie, which is available on CD. Sissy received an Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Loretta Lynn, the only Oscar awarded to the film of the seven nominations. Sissy sounds so incredibly like Loretta Lynn that sometimes I find it difficult to know whether a Loretta Lynn CD or the movie soundtrack is playing. Sissy's phenomenal acting talent made her Loretta Lynn.

Sissy was well supported in her role by other excellent talents. The multi-talented Tommy Lee Jones played the part of Loretta's philandering husband Mooney Dolittle. Tommy Lee played the role very well within the limits of the screenplay. My only complaint is that I felt that Mooney was portrayed in a much milder way than his actual personality. I believe most viewers will perceive traits in Tommy Lee's character that are hints of the real Mooney.

Beverly D'Angelo is outstanding as brash and outgoing Patsy Cline, for a time Loretta's idol, best friend and mentor in the country music world. Patsy had a lot of influence on how naive Loretta perceived the world and how she reacted to things. Beverly sang Patsy's songs and matched Sissy in the quality of her performance.

Also appearing in this movie were Levon Helm and Phyllis Boyens as Loretta's parents. I read that Loretta was shocked by the appearance of Levon Helm in his makeup and clothes because he looked so much like her father. This couple in role could have easily been the models for the picture ""American Gothic."" Another appearance worthy of note was that of Earnest Tubb as himself.

Loretta Lynn's story is a grand story because she exemplifies the dream we all have of making our way in the world. Loretta's father was, as the title suggests, a coal miner. Coal mining is a difficult, dirty job with a lot of risk. During the time of Loretta's youth coal miners would typically get their paycheck and then go to the company store to buy food and pay their debt. In many ways working for a mine in those times was nearly like slavery or indentured servitude. Mooney and Loretta escape by first traveling to the west coast, and ultimately by capitalizing on Loretta's abilities as a singer and songwriter. Loretta became a multi-millionaire with a wide range of business interests. This movie presents a rags-to-riches story to inspire us all.",1157846400,2,3273,4.723292469352014
221378,5,6300182304,"Coal Miner's Daughter is the story of Loretta Lynn from the age of 14 to her rise to Country Western star to her breakdown to her return to performing.

Doolittle Lynn has just gotten out of the Army and is hustling to make a living.  When he returns to Butcher Holler, he sees the 14 year old Loretta and decides that she is going to be his wife.  After a short courtship they are married but working in the mines is not what Doo wants to do.  He leaves a pregnant Loretta to pursue better opportunities out west.

Doo raises enough money to bring Loretta and their daughter out to him.  Over the next few years they have three more kids.  Loretta is busy raising her family but Doo wants more and sees her talent for singing.  He drags her out to a local bar and she finds out that she likes to perform.  Next he has her record a single.

They go out on the road to promote the song and this is where Loretta blooms.  She finds out that she has a natural charm that everyone likes and the song becomes a hit.  Her star rises and Patsy Cline takes notice and has Loretta join her on the road.

Loretta thrives on the road but Doo doesn't like being second fiddle.  He and Loretta decide that he should go home, find what will make him fulfilled, and raise the family.

Loretta becomes a superstar but the road eventually has its toll on Loretta and one night she collapses.  But this gives Loretta and Doo time to reconnect with each other.  After her rest, Loretta comes back even stronger.

This film was an early success for Sissy and Tommy Lee but when  awards time around only Sissy was recognized for her stunning performance but Jones' performance slipped through the cracks as did a great supporting turn by another up and comer Beverly D'Angelo as Patsy Cline.

This is a great film biography of a truly amazing perfomer.

221382,5,6300182304,"My mother hails from the Tennessee Smokey Mountain region, not at all unlike Loretta's Kentucky. Admittedly, her parents came from a certain level of wealth, so she is not a ""coal miner's daughter"" but she does, to this day, exemplify the quiet dignity of a woman who's life has been marked by beautiful vistas combined with hardship. Prior to her entering high school, the wealth of the family farm was ultimately lost, causing a move to Memphis, where things really got rough. Not dirt paths instead of paved roads rough, but rough nonetheless. Moreover, though long since lost to the west coast of California, her accent and values remain strong.

From my youngest memories, I saw a significant amount of her in Loretta Lynn (after all, both cooked with Crisco!). When an opportunity to see Ms. Lynn at a county fair show came along in shortly before this movie's release in the late 70's, I made it a point to be there. There's nothing like a country concert in the rain at a county fair. Sitting amongst all the big buckled men & high-haired ladies (none under umbrellas) Loretta and band kept all spirits above the rain as it fell just after she took the stage. How appropriate that a scene like this exists in this film.

Further, there is nothing quite like an actor who braves, and succeeds, in actually vocalizing a role, instead of cheating chance by lip-synching (ala Jamie Foxx in ""Ray"" or Jessica Lange in ""Sweet Dreams""). Even Beverly D'Angelo, who even won the praise of Patsy Cline's producer, Owen Bradley, for her perfect interpretation of Cline's classics (let alone, rehearsing on the bus). What a shame that Hollywood felt the need to cast Jessica Lange over Miss D'Angelo in the aforementioned ""Sweet Dreams."" Oscar voters should have to consider that the actual voice of the actor is PART of the art of acting.

Tommy Lee Jones is perfectly cast as Lynn's adoring, abusive, die-hard, hard-living husband ""Doo,"" in spite of the fact that her real husband was not tall - he was still towering, brutish, intimidating. He should have been recognized with at least nominations. Also worthy of note are Levon Helm (his acting debut) and Phyllis Boyens as Loretta's parents.

This film is a perfect ""re-imagining"" of a woman's life & career that continues to overcome, persevere, and succeed. Great plus in the 25th anniversary edition is actual interviews with Ms. Lynn. And this from one who is NOT a big fan of Country music.",1150848000,2,2445,4.800475059382423

The acting is so good. The actors make the Kentucky accents so believable, not hokey like the Beverly Hillbillies. The music is also fantastic. Sissy Spacek does Loretta Lynn justice. This movie is good for Loretta fans and even those that aren't. I guarantee that after watching this film, everyone will be a fan. It is also very accurate. Loretta Lynn herself has said that she can't watch the movie because it's so true to the way that it actually happened. The movie showcases such historic places such as the Ryman and Earnest Tubb's record store. I cannot stop raving about this movie. It's a must see!",1143417600,4,768,4.613138686131387
221384,5,6300182304,"To me, the success of a film biography isn't whether fans of the personality will watch the movie; they will, whether it is any good, or not...the true measure of success is how the film captures an audience who DON'T know the person, and wins their hearts.

""Coal Miner's Daughter"" does this, better than nearly any other 'biopic', and the film is as passionate and wonderful today as it was in 1980.

There are several reasons for the film's 'staying' power; first, British director Michael Apted, making his first American feature, brought an unbiased eye to the lifestyle of poor but proud rural America. Eschewing the clichs of the ""Smokey and the Bandit"" and ""Dukes of Hazzards"" stereotypes, he cast many 'locals' in the film, and attempted to recreate, as realistically as possible, the world Loretta Webb/Lynn knew so well.

Second, the film boasts not one or two, but three powerhouse supporting performances. Tommy Lee Jones, who Apted picked over Harrison Ford, is a revelation as Doolittle 'Mooney' Lynn. With only a handful of credits when the film was released, he demonstrated the dazzling combination of humor and sensitivity that would eventually win him a place as one of our finest actors. Levon Helm, making his dramatic debut as Loretta's father, Ted, is even more impressive. Low-key, but irresistible, he offers so much love and power in his portrayal that it's easy to see why he would remain influential to his superstar daughter, long after his passing. In a brief but sparkling portrayal, Beverly D'Angelo channels Patsy Cline to perfection (I may be alone in my opinion, but I prefer her portrayal over Jessica Lange's, in ""Sweet Dreams""). With earthy charm and worldliness, she would change Loretta's image from 'cowgirl' to 'royalty', and her shocking, early death would shatter Loretta, much as it would for everyone who loved her.

Of course, without a strong, charismatic performance in the lead, nothing else would matter, and Sissy Spacek is nothing less than spectacular! Handpicked by Loretta Lynn, herself, from a photograph (Spacek would admit that she felt 'wrong' for the role, and uncomfortable about Lynn proclaiming the actress as ""her"" choice on national TV, but as she was preparing to turn it down, ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" came on a 'classical' radio station she was listening to, and she suddenly knew she was 'meant' to play the part!) Contrary to popular opinion, she had to learn Lynn's Southern accent, and spent grueling weeks learning how to sing her signature tunes (including a week with Loretta, herself). The end results are stunning! Despite only a passing resemblance, Spacek so totally captured the talent, vulnerability, feistiness, and strength of Loretta Lynn that she won the 1980 'Best Actress' Oscar (over Gena Rowlands, Ellen Burstyn, Goldie Hawn, and Mary Tyler Moore), and is still identified with the role, today.

I knew little of Country Music in 1980, and even less about Loretta Lynn, but the film captured my heart...and after 25 years, it still moves me!

country music or not. And I dislike 99.99999% of it. However,

this is a good movie of a poor southern girl growing up

She goes from a shy girl, to abit of a rebel,(her parents

don't approve of Dolittle)a nd finally becomes a woman

a big music star. Things head downhill abit... Her and

Dolittlestart to have problems and Patsy Cline passes away

due to  a terrible plane crash.. On top of all that, the

tough and grinding touring starts to wear on Lynn and she breaks down.

Never really a dull time in the entire movie. The acting and

emotion keep you into the movie and you actually can care

The last concert where Lynn (Spacek) tells her fans about becoming ill, they were not expecting it. That scene was not rehersed, it was shot for the first time and then it was a print. The director wanted to capture the true emotion of the fans in the crowd. Very good direction!!!! I was glad to learn Lynn was pleased with the film about her life. This film is full of outstanding scenery, acting, and directing!

221399,5,6300182304,"""Coal Miner's Daughter"" is one of those films that transcends musical tastes, cultures and social classes to touch all viewer's hearts.  Even I, someone who was not previously familiar with the ""first lady of Country Music"" (the great Loretta Lynn), and certainly not a huge country music fan, found myself entertained, engaged and moved by this inspiring and affirmative film.

The story starts in Kentucky, as thirteen year old Loretta (masterfully played by Sissy Spacek, who went on to win an Academy Award for her role), one of eight children and the daughter of a dirt poor coal miner, is helping to raise her siblings and just survive in her impoverished surroundings. It is then that she meets ""Doo"" (Tommy Lee Jones), a man ten years her senior, who has returned from his military service, and they promptly fall in love.  They end up getting married shortly after one month's time.  It is ""Doo"" who first recognizes her singing talents, as she sings to the first of their four children, buys her a guitar and pushes her into singing professionally.  Of course, this is only the beginning of a greatly successful performing career.  Loretta took her experiences with her husband, as well as her humble beginnings in Kentucky, and set them to music in her numerous songs.  Through the power of these songs, she always remained close to her roots, and, with her music touched many, who either related her songs or were simply touched by the honesty of her lyrics.

This film worked for me on so many levels.  I appreciated the respect paid to Loretta, througout the movie, and that it wasn't at all exploitative.  Though, she had her share of ups and downs, we see her struggle with great dignity (e.g; her husband's philandering, her breakdown on stage).  The acting was marvelous.  Tommy Lee Jones' and Sissy Spacek's on-screen chemistry as a couple was, both, believeable and honest.  Also, I thought it was wonderful how Sissy Spacek did all of her own singing!  If you ever hear some of Loretta's actual recordings, you would have a hard time telling the two women apart.  She captured the tone and style beautifully and convincingly.  As did Beverly D'Angelo (as Patsy Cline), a great inspiration to Loretta, who was her friend and confidante, on and off stage.

This is a great film that can be enjoyed by people of all ages and generations.  It is truly a great glimpse into the life of a wonderful and inspiring performer, who came from modest means, went on to become one of the greatest country singers, and still maintained a strong sense of self that came through the gift of personal struggle and adversity.
I give this an A+ all the way.",1111190400,7,2659,4.75599128540305
221400,5,6300182304,"Sissy's well-deserved Oscar for one of the best screen-bios ever. Based on the book of the same name, by Loretta Lynn, Sissy knocks `em dead as the country bumpkin turned country music star. Director Apted's clear vision of the story magnifies his ability to show a more primitive life (see also *Gorillas In The Mist* and *Nell*), and moody cinematography perfectly captures Loretta's Butcher Hollow, Kentucky upbringing - where 13 is not too young to get married, and the coal dust and poverty-stricken conditions guarantee that life will be short. Along comes the brash and determined Dolittle Lynn, confounding the parents and sweeping Loretta off her feet. Tommy Lee Jones plays the character as a hot-headed and directionless young man who comes to believe that his wife may be a talented singer. His life's direction becomes clear, and he makes Loretta his career. It is impossible to cover and entire life and career in 2 hours, and important details are sometimes necessarily dispensed with - but, again, we get to watch Sissy re-invent herself before our very eyes, taking Loretta from being the ill-nourished daughter of a coal miner to being the glorious ""First Lady of Country Music"" Beverly D'Angelo is the seminal Patsy Cline - brassy and tender, and her brief turn in this film is everything that *Sweet Dreams* with Jessica Lange should have been, but wasn't. The soundtrack was a smash hit, and Spacek and D'Angelo are remarkable for doing their own singing and this helps in securing the film's place as a top tribute. Of the bio genre, there are few to compare with the superiority of this film. *Lady Sings The Blues*, *Your Cheatin' Heart* and *La Bamba* are nice tries, but only *The Buddy Holly Story* comes as close to capturing the true essence of the subject. In the Country Queen realm, television's *Stand By Your Man*, the story of Tammy Wynette, starring Annette O'Toole, did a stand-up job of telling Wynette's story, but, O'Toole's fine performance aside, the production values simply don't hold a candle to the excellence *Coal Miner's Daughter*.",1106438400,,2080,4.9798850574712645

221415,5,6300182304,"Some movies are so excellent that words are insufficient to describe that excellence.  Such is the case with ""Coal Miner's Daughter,"" a movie that relies on an effectively told story of Loretta Lynn to carry the film rather than flashy special effects and action.  The script is brought to life by the incredible talents of the actors, most especially Sissy Spacek, in one of the best performances of her career.
""Coal Miner's Daughter"" spans the era from the late 1940s to the early 70s, focusing principally on Loretta Lynn from age 13 to her rise to fame as the best-selling female country artist.  It's easy to look at Loretta's early life as an artifact of some ancient time, but in fact Loretta's life and the life of her family was quite typical in some rural areas in The United States in that era, and many of us are the children or grandchildren of similar families.  This movie is thus not only the story Loretta Lynn, but is also the story of many Americans.
Sissy Spacek sang all the songs for the movie, which is available on CD.  Sissy received an Oscar for Best Actress for her role as Loretta Lynn, the only Oscar awarded to the film of the seven nominations.  Sissy sounds so incredibly like Loretta Lynn that sometimes I find it difficult to know whether a Loretta Lynn CD or the movie soundtrack is playing.  Sissy's phenomenal acting talent made her Loretta Lynn.
Sissy was well supported in her role by other excellent talents.  The multi-talented Tommy Lee Jones played the part of Loretta's philandering husband Mooney Dolittle.  Tommy Lee played the role very well within the limits of the screenplay.  My only complaint is that I felt that Mooney was portrayed in a much milder way than his actual personality.  I believe most viewers will perceive traits in Tommy Lee's character that are indications of the real Mooney.
Beverly D'Angelo is outstanding as brash and outgoing Patsy Cline, for a time Loretta's idol, best friend and mentor in the country music world.  Patsy had a lot of influence on how nave Loretta perceived the world and how she reacted to things.  Beverly sang Patsy's songs and matched Sissy in the quality of her performance.
Also appearing in this movie were Levon Helm and Phyllis Boyens as Loretta's parents.  I read that Loretta was shocked by the appearance of Levon Helm in his makeup and clothes because he looked so much like her father.  This couple in role could have easily been the models for the picture ""American Gothic.""  Another appearance worthy of note was that of Earnest Tubb as himself.
Loretta Lynn's story is such a grand story because she exemplifies the dream we all have of making our way in the world.  Loretta's father was, as the title suggests, a coal miner.  Coal mining is a difficult, dirty job with a lot of risk.  During the time of Loretta's youth coal miners would typically get their paycheck and then go to the company store to buy food and pay their debt.  In many ways working for a mine in those times was nearly like slavery or indentured servitude.  Mooney and Loretta escape by first traveling to the west coast, and ultimately by capitalizing on Loretta's abilities as a singer and songwriter.  Ultimately Loretta became a multi-millionaire with a wide range of business interests.  This movie presents a rags-to-riches story to inspire us all.",1075161600,7,3339,4.748700173310225

221419,4,6300182304,"At long last, ""Coal Miner's Daughter"" has come to DVD. This biopic tells the tale of country music legend Loretta Lynn, spanning her early years of poverty in Butcher Holler, Kentucky through her steady rise to fame and fortune to become the queen of country music. The film details the highs and lows of that journey with both heartfelt humor and pathos and contains incredible performances from the entire cast.
One need not be a fan of Loretta or country music to enjoy this film. Director Michael Apted has crafted a movie of depth, detail and emotion, especially in the early scenes which depict Loretta's early years growing up dirt poor in the Appalachian mountains. Apted's attention to detail allows the viewer to really understand what it was like to grow up in such an impoverished environment. Apted obviously respected the material he was working with and does it justice.
Sissy Spacek, as Loretta, is simply superb. Earning a well deserved Oscar for this performance, she is never less than captivating. Starting out as a shy, naive 14 year old, then slowly building confidence and self-awareness, to emotionally crumbling under pressures to great for her to handle, Sissy is completely believable in all stages of Lynn's life. On top of it all, Sissy does her own singing in the film! This is one talented woman. Tommy Lee Jones is equally compeling as Mooney, Lynn's husband, who's confidence in his young bride started it all. Jones does a great job displaying Mooney's determination, frustrations and insecurities. Also of note is Beverly D'Angelo's performance as Patsy Cline. Although she has very little screen time in the film, her impact in the overall film is undeniable. She too gives a pitch perfect performance and does all her own singing as well. Alas both Jones and D'Angelo were overlooked when the Oscar nominations were announced that year. (They were both robbed!!) These three powerhouse performances are backed up with an equally strong supporting cast, including Levon Helms and Phyllis Boyens (both of whom where not actors by trade) as Loretta's parents.
The DVD provides extras such as a commentary track with Apted and Spacek (not the best commentary track I've heard but worth a listen if you like that sort of thing), interviews with both Tommy Lee Jones and Loretta Lynn (worth a peek) and a totally useless clip of President Bush (Sr. that is) saluting the AFI. He mentions the title of Coal Miner's Daughter once in his speech. That warranted it's inclusion in the DVD!!?? Alas there are no deleted scenes or ""making of"" documentaries which I enjoy watching but I don't want to sound like ""a big ol' bear a growlin"" so I won't complain.",1059609600,3,2682,4.909691629955947

Okay, I'm one of those folks who knows this movie up and down, back and forth, word-for-Kentucky-word, and proud of it!
I remember seeing this film on the big screen in 1980, when I barely knew who Loretta Lynn was, and I loved it dearly from that moment on.
If this film hadn't been up against my other all-time favorite movie for the Best Picture Oscar in 1980, it should have (and would have) won, hands-down.
I waited for years for this film to finally be released on DVD, and I wasn't disappointed. My VHS edition, while as wonderful as a pan&scan movie can be, was worn out from repeated viewing. The quality of the picture and sound on the DVD is superb, as are the special features, including an interview with Director Michael Apted and Miss Loretta Lynn herself, as well as a rememberance by Tommy Lee Jones.

The story of the backwards, backwoods,  painfully shy little girl whose simple, self-penned, biographical songs made her a huge star with almost unequaled # 1 country hits, is just as touching and great as when it was released. Tommy Lee Jones is perfect as ""Doo"", the man who stood by his woman, and Beverly D'Angelo gives a memorable performance as the legendary Patsy Cline. The fact that Spacek and D'Angelo so effectively do all their own singing, considering the shoes they had to fill,  just makes this film all that much of a wonder. Levon Helm, of The Band, is also very good as ""Lorettys"" daddy. Just an all- around terrific film, with many touching moments from a by-gone time, when a little girl with a record could tap on the radio station window one day, and be a star a week later. Sissy Spacek's Oscar winning performance makes for a total class production about a total class lady. Loretta Lynn became one of this city boys favorites since seeing this film, and she remains so... a true, greatly admired, humanitarian *star*, who could teach most other celebrities a thing or two about ""stardom"".
