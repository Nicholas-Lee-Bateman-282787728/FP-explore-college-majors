2934134,4,B000V9KF7S,"Based on the true story published by NY Times reporter Dena Kleiman, the made-for-TVer A DEADLY SILENCE covers a delicate subject.

To protect her younger sister from the intimate assaults she herself endured, a teenaged girl hires a schoolmate to kill the perpetrator.

In February of 1986, Long Islander Cheryl Pierson (Fairfield) arranges for the murder of her electrician father, James (Haid). She'd been a victim of incest at his hands for five years, and as this story reveals, friends and family members who are aware of such horrendous acts may keep quiet instead of protecting the helpless victim. At her trial, Cheryl's attorney (Farrell) pleads ""not guilty due to extenuating circumstances.""

This well-done film isn't a popular one, but that's understandable considering the subject matter. (Watch here for a pre-Friends David Schwimmer, also veteran actor Jeff Corey as the judge.)

8217530,5,B000V9KF7S,People need to start asking questions when they suspicion about abuse. Our children depend on us to protect them if they our children or not! I don't think she should went jail but pray for her and many out there like her,1522886400,,221,4.285714285714286
8217531,3,B000V9KF7S,They couldn't have cast it better! David Scwimmer as the bf that's too much of a punk to do it himself AND rats out his own girl to boot. If there was any justice he should've gotten 25 years for being a bitch instead of his bro that did the job. Or perhaps I just have an irrational hatred for him being the most punch-able character ever on Friends?,1520208000,,351,4.101449275362318
8217532,4,B000V9KF7S,"I wouldn't call this a five star movie but it was very good. No stars that I know. But the moral is never trust fathers who neglect, abuse, and sexual abuse their children. Of course she kept it quiet because her father made her too. They are the greatest manipulators. Behind closed doors, the government doesn't know what's goin' on in a house, full of family. Fairly good movie.",1518652800,,381,4.536231884057971
8217533,3,B000V9KF7S,This was an okay movie dealing with a sensitive topic.  It was interesting to me that so many people had suspicions but no one reported anything to the proper authorities.  Also interesting that the sister (Strothers) refused to believe it despite overwhelming testimony and the statement of fact from the judge.  Overall not a bad movie considering the dated feel of it.,1518652800,,371,4.951612903225806
8217534,4,B000V9KF7S,"I'm a big fan of True Crime TV shows and films because they give me strong insights into human nature as well as the difficulties and limitations inherent in our legal institutions. Though a little dated (released in 1989), this film covers a lot of broad territory concerning the problem of incest. Even though I worked with children and teens for many years in social service settings, I still learned a lot from it. So I recommend it for anyone who is at all interested in the subject.",1518220800,4,488,4.556818181818182
