6286921,4,B00IR6Q6VQ,"Caution: Be prepared for unfiltered, explicit adult content.

If you are not offended by explicit love scenes, complicated lives, and movies with no conclusive endings then this is for you. To me this movie is about a kid who found lust and was constantly chasing the next high that it comes with. He is lost in a complicated mix between love, lust, and addiction. His story leaves you feeling lost, and uncertain of when, or how the cycle is going to end. It's a great film for all of you Indy movie lovers, or people who just want something to make them feel better about there personal life (As his is a train-wreck)",1499817600,6,619,4.477876106194691
6286922,3,B00IR6Q6VQ,"Objectively I can see how this can be considered a work of art. I can appreciate it's artistic value. Subjectively, I thought it was boring. It was a sexy movie and to be honest those were the only parts I actually enjoyed. The story itself was depressing and dragging. But like I said, that's my subjective view. And truthfully, that's life oftentimes. So while I wouldn't watch it again, it gets three stars for its raw truth and for it's sex appeal.",1499731200,4,452,4.524390243902439

6286926,5,B00IR6Q6VQ,"This is a story about two relationships merging into one. It is certainly a love story. That love, the resulting passion and the sex - explicit certainly and scintillating often - concerns not only the three central protagonists but also, the times they are together in bed. The heading to this review - 'this is how it can be' - will be recognised by people who have experienced such things. The structure of the film is a series of juxtapositions, oscillating between the present, the past and the future. For those students of the erotic, this is definitely one to appreciate!",1494720000,,579,4.742574257425742

6286930,2,B00IR6Q6VQ,"I was interested in this film because I heard it was a deep emotional drama, a search between sexual raw pleasure and real love. I knew it had gotten several accolades. But, honestly, it is nothing more than a porn film in which one of the girls gets pregnant and results in the male character's remorse. I am sure others will absolutely dispute this view, but if you want to see a great art film, this is not it. If you want to see an ""art"" film with actual sex scenes, it's yours for hire.

6286937,5,B00IR6Q6VQ,"Gaspar Noe's movies were always controversial. He dared to show the inner desires of most men and women. The movie had a lot of raw sex and nudity. It was  not about normal sexual behaviors but more a dare to push the limit of one's sexual

Viewers whose prurience doesn't shut down their forebrains should get the very blunt hint at the misery and wretchedness that is coming when the movie pauses to display ""MURPHY'S LAW: ANYTHING THAT CAN GO WRONG WILL."" In bold, block letters covering the screen.  It is a sexually explicit, depressing downer of a movie if you can think past the sex scenes.",1475539200,2,489,4.855421686746988

6286942,3,B00IR6Q6VQ,"While the cinematography (color schemes, backgrounds) is excellent, the scenario is hard to follow. If one is not very attentive, the story line becomes confusing. For example, it is at times difficult to discern which woman it is who is in the male protagonist's company. It would seem that the director has created a male protagonist who is an ""ugly American"". Particularly towards the end of the film, the French social value system is depicted as being superior to the American way.",1471910400,5,486,4.939024390243903

Had Gaspar Noe made this film a bit less autobiographical and more universal it could have been a high water mark in cinematic history.  Instead it is brought don't by its tragic cynicism.
The quality of the acting is shockingly good given the explicit demands of Noe's script.
Regardless of its weakness I believe it to be a fearless leap forward in cinematic storytelling.",1460160000,2,474,5.142857142857143

His real love disappears from his life, in large part because of his own reckless sexual actions and he is unable to contact her.  The movie is the troubling story life of two sexual active people, but who still love each other yet cannot resolve their sensual needs beyond their own relationship.

6286961,1,B00IR6Q6VQ,"Where to begin on just how pretentious and dreadful this film is.. It is nothing even remotely more than porn disguised as ""art"". Art? Gimme a break. Watching some guy ejaculate directly into the camera lens is probably as imaginative as filming an upclose shot of a toilet after someone took a large s***. The main character is a whiny, weasly little castrato (despite the multitude of evidence to the contrary) who mumbles and stares blankly at the camera for much of the movie pining over the loss of his ""love"", another lifeless drone. The script is absolutely God awful and awkward and the dialogue is forced, fake and terribly acted. The scene where he confronts his ex-girlfriend in her apartment hallway was more poorly acted than any student film in history. The scenes are excrutiatingly long and spend literally minutes staring at the exact same shot, many times where the actors are literally doing nothing. I have never seen longer shots of someone's back in my life.  The sex scenes are not in the least bit erotic either with the exception of maybe one or two that were fast and not so incredibly drawn out and repetitive. Even the threesome was a snoozefest. If I want to watch porn, I'll watch porn but I didn't want to watch porn when I watched this, I wanted a story. If these writers/director wanted to make a porno into a love story (which could have been highly erotic) wow, this was a colossal failure at what maybe was an interesting idea. There is no ""Love"" in this movie between the main characters who just seem to have sex and take walks with absolutely no indication as to why they are supposedly so in love. If the writers had developed the non-sexual passion between the two characters and then shown their heated physical passion, that could have resulted in an original and sizzling hot production. No such luck. Big yawn.",1458345600,8,1855,4.672782874617737
6286962,5,B00IR6Q6VQ,One of the most interesting films I've seen in a while.  Ending seemed a bit unclear or perhaps unfinished.

6286966,5,B00IR6Q6VQ,"An acid trip of a love story. People have panned it for being ""pornographic"". What's gross about porn is that it is merely intended to stimulate erotic urges, rather than aesthetic or emotional feelings. That's exactly how Gaspar separates himself in this work. Unlike pornography, it's not about sex, it's about LOVE.  This journey is a stylish exploration of love lost and how one never really forgets about a great love despite their best efforts. A great love will stick to one's soul like a possessive demon with malicious intent. Gaspar deftly explores this notion with a mix of bitter and sweet. He's one of the kings of style in cinema. His work is always thought provoking and subsequently labeled ""dangerous"". Someday his brilliance will be celebrated in the streets with ticker tape parades in his honor. Until then, he's a dope hip pocket under ground cinematic god. I mean... he scores a sex scene with John Carpenter's Assault on Precinct Thirteen intro. He's one of the very best ever.",1456531200,24,1000,4.882352941176471

6286968,5,B00IR6Q6VQ,"It's traditional French film cinema, French genre in terms of the film's length. That didn't bother me. It moves slow but well worth the pacing later as the crescendo builds. The plot is not resolved in some neat package like a Hollywood 'typical' film made for the masses. If you like foreign films, then this is right up your ally. If you like Indie type French Foreign film for the 21st Century that pushes the envelope then yes, you will like this movie. Everything you read about the highly charged erotic sex scenes is true. Regardless if you agree or not with the creative license the director and producer's took, it's a good modern film about young people in love, destruction, broken promises, drugs, bad choices, threesomes and more -- it's all woven in short flashbacks and vignettes, and is quite poetic really.

The cast is handsomely portrayed, though the actual underlying dialogue is quite sketchy and not I'll to the level of the photography.

The threesome scene in the first half hour is definitely hot and the guitars playing during the scene set the tone for more freaky things to come. It turned me on and definitely turned my woman on,if you are open minded and don't mind explicit sex through 85% of the film this movie is for you.

It jumps back and forth between the narrator's frustrating present with a woman he doesn't really love, and their infant, and the woman whom he yearns to recover. If you have any phallophobia, or would rather not be blasted with graphic sexual scenes, then avoid this film. I'm troubled by his rendition of a three-way experience.  It seems to be a warning against threesomes and a  puritanical yearning for a monogamist love despite all the sexual content. A very confusing message indeed.

I bealive this movie is great, but only if you watch it on 3D, cause the Director really make a good use of this technology in and ""Erotic"" type of movie.

One of the biggest problems with this movie is a little bit too long. And also you can clearly see how the Director don't know how to finish this film. How to put and end on this one. That gives you the impression that probably the script wasn't finished when they start filming it.

Anyway I recomend this movie, but you need to be in a mood to whatch it and with your couple or friend with benefits next to you.

But remember is almost 3 hours long!!!",1451952000,2,852,4.053571428571429
6286992,4,B00IR6Q6VQ,"I thought it was a beautiful film overall. I enjoyed the musical score, the cinematography... I do think there could have been more to the story and hate that it leaves you hanging. I like that many scenes are more moving in an abstract expressive way rather than filled with heavy dialogue, but at the same time I would've liked a little bit more.
On that same note though I think the director really just wanted this to be about love, in a very simple yet understandable and relate-able way.
Murphy experienced love and being loved by someone, and the loss of it all and how it hurts. Love is really complex and beautiful, even for young people who use drugs have wild sex and are impulsive and maybe not the most likable characters... love still exists for all. And everyone can relate to that.  I enjoyed it overall",1451865600,15,819,4.496644295302014

6287016,2,B00IR6Q6VQ,"From my print review

I n flagrante delicto. So opens the very first shot of Love, the fourth feature from one of France's leading brokers of transgressive cinema, Argentinian-born writer-director Gaspar No.

The scene, of a man and woman engaging in various forms of manual sex, is explicit, erotic, perhaps pornographic. (Where does art stop and pornography begin, the film asks rather awkwardly?) It gives no warning, makes no excuses. It's just there, in your face.

It's a provocative way to being a film. And we'd expect nothing less from No, who galvanized critics with his second movie, Irrversible (2002), which featured an excruciatingly long, explicit rape scene.

No's follow-up, Enter the Void, was no less extreme, but also achieved a level of lyricism that was thoroughly enchanting.

With Love, No seems to have de-evolved, abandoning the artistic control and balance he achieved in his previous picture. Self-indulgent, ridiculously overlong at 135 minutes, Love provokes the audience for the sake of provocation alone.

Love is a Bildungsroman about a young would-be filmmaker named Murphy (Karl Glusman), living in Paris and desperately in love with a Gallic beauty named, of all things, Electra (Aomi Muyock). But she leaves him when he gets their mutual friend and sometime sex partner Omi (Klara Kristin) pregnant.

Think of it as a Portrait of the Young Artist as a Young (Sexually-Hyperactive) Man that uses montage and flashbacks to simulate something akin to James Joyce's stream-of-consciousness prose.

No gives us a buffoonishly written backstory that explains why Omi could never consider having an abortion, so Murphy is forced to stay with her and the baby.

Told entirely from Murphy's point of view - a shame, given that he's a silly, pretentious narcissist - the film consists of all the things that go through his head during a single day after he gets a call from Electra's mother.

Preoccupied with her, he daydreams about his relationship Electra. For all its avant-garde bells and whistles, Love is a very conventional story about a depressed guy who feels trapped with a wife and baby he can't stand. So he spends his hours obsessing about an ex.

One wonders why an artist of No's talent would bother chronicling the inner life of such an annoying little jerk. Or why he thought it justified to film every thought, feeling, and fantasy that passes through Murphy's head - including, of course, the memory of all the sex he had with Electra. And why No felt compelled to show all of it in X-rated detail.

Worse yet are the scenes that have Murphy, who seems to think he's the Italian director and intellectual Pier Paolo Pasolini reborn, pontificate about his theory of art. ""I want to make movies out of sperm, out of blood and tears,"" he tells Electra.

No seems unwilling to accept that art requires editing - it is, by definition, artifice. It demands the artist make choices, rather than try to cram an entire catalog of experiences down the viewer's throat.

What's saddest about Love is that every once in a while, the film gives us flashes of near-sublime visual poetry, only to crash and burn again on the shores of Murphy's puerile existence.",1447891200,33,3194,4.956928838951311
6287017,3,B00IR6Q6VQ,It was interesting. GasperNoe always has weird shots. Some sort of weird editing style. The color of the film was pretty awesome for a late night viewing. There is gratuitous sex that boarders on graphic most times. That is a lot of the film actually. It takes place in Paris and has an interesting sex club scene as well as a group ayahuasca scene. There isn't much closure at the end of the film like I had hoped for which led me to leave it as a visually stimulating film and really not much more. The score is pretty repetitive but in a good way I guess. Evoking a tranced like viewing. I was surprised to hear a Death by Vegas song in there though. All in all it almost seems kinda tame for Gasper Noe but maybe that's because I'm desensitized by sex on screen.,1447804800,5,766,4.2534246575342465
