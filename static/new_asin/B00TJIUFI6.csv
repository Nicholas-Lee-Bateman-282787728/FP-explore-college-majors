7011671,5,B00TJIUFI6,"This isn't Jamie Kennedy's first attempt at playing a psychotic character.  He was in the movie Forclosure and played a pretty decent maniac killer in that movie.  He did much better here for Buddy Hutchins.  Very believable I thought.  Talk about a guy with bad luck where everything bad that can possibly happen does and boy does he snap. He owes everybody money and as much as I'd like to blame it all on the wife, he clearly had serious issues before he got into debt.  This man ultimately has a psychotic breakdown and it turns into a disturbing slasher film and he becomes a serial killer within 5 minutes.  Overall, Im giving 5 stars. Kennedy's performance was great, everyone else pretty sub par but I chuckled, I smiled, laughed and even got grossed out. Glad to see Kennedy out & about again.",1460073600,4,802,4.573426573426573
7011672,4,B00TJIUFI6,"I actually was kind of deceived by this movie.
During the first hour it was quite boring but all of a sudden the script heats up and things start happening, ten minutes later I'm thing... oh yeahhh now we're talking.

Not perfect but a very enjoyable movie.
If someone would ask me to quick summary of the movie.... I'd lit up a smoke and would say... sh*t happens you know? and sometimes you can clean it up.",1459382400,,409,4.311688311688312
7011673,5,B00TJIUFI6,Gets off to a slow start but has a great soundtrack!!,1456704000,,53,3.909090909090909
7011674,1,B00TJIUFI6,"Put simply, Buddy Hutchins is confounding.

The premise is simple, but the methods taken by writer/director Jared Cohn to tell such a tale are severely misguided.

-Nearly every interior scene has a fog about it, as if something was continuously burning on set.

-Light set-ups are placed directly outside windows (so that the night scenes constantly appear as though someone's high-beams are blasting in)
-Curtains are nonsensically draped about entryways like a high school play (to essentially block viewers from realizing that they just shot the previous scene's location in the other room).

-Numerous shots aren't framed properly or are blatantly out of focus.

-The color wasn't matched properly and even changes mid-scene, right in front of your eyes.

-Continuity is horrendous (that awkward dinner scene with Buddy, his daughter, mom and brother is a top offender) and just gets worse the longer it goes on (especially when Buddy gets blood on him, his suit constantly alters from being covered in blood to clean again).

-NOTHING makes sense. Everything is written from a kid's perspective of the world; one which has no concept of reality. Cops? Yeah, they'll just show up out of the blue. Hospitals? Yeah, they totally just tell patients that they're not going to give them aid and send them on their way. A person is assaulted and the cops arrest said victim, but let the assailant walk? YEAH, THAT'S TOTALLY HOW THINGS WORK.

-Characters just appear, disappear at the drop of a hat. One guy is beaten to near-death with a baseball bat to the chest and head before being shot... And then shows up at the very end talking about how he was shot... What?

-Events just happen to progress Buddy's ""bad day"" with little to no logic and characters don't react realistically to anything. One guy witness another man have his arm and head chainsawed off and DOESN'T EVEN ADDRESS IT, but instead speaks like the attacker spilled milk on the rug.

-The whole ""snowflake"" thing Buddy has with his daughter is just weird and awkward.

-The ending is hilariously bad and just when you think it's over, it has another ending. And then when you think it's over again, it has ANOTHER ending. It's as if three different dudes directed their own finale and then just played them one after the other.

The best part about it is probably the actor who portrayed Buddy's gay brother--he did quite a good job. Jamie on the other hand is definitely trying something different/a little bit more dramatic, but he goes from somber to flat-out unlikable pretty fast.

As a film, Buddy Hutchins is an Uwe-equivalent travesty. But if you wanna get drunk and laugh for all of the wrong reasons than it might be worthwhile.",1441929600,2,2706,4.856521739130435
7011675,1,B00TJIUFI6,"I applaud Jamie Kennedy for attempting to portray a maniac but his acting chops are porky. Ham fisted and bloated. Im about his age and we both are aging poorly. All that fun shows wear on our beautiful faces. It was a fun attempt at playing a character who hit a pretty bad streak and he finally snaps. Some decent gore effects and tons of cheese for the Z grade movie fans. Its worth watching to get a chuckle here and there and one of this years best/worst movies. Its no Malibus Most Wanted, Scream, Kickin' It Old School or Sol Goode but it was memorable and fun to see him play a psycho.",1441497600,,593,4.2105263157894735
7011676,5,B00TJIUFI6,"Really good movie, Jamie getting better everyday. Good watch. Recommend",1424044800,2,71,6.2
7011677,2,B00TJIUFI6,"Buddy (Jamie Kennedy) runs a failing dry cleaning business. His son (Richard Switzer) hates him. His wife (Sara Malakul Lane) has become distant. His only real love is his daughter Molly (Milana Lev). Buddy also has a drinking issue. After losing everything to his cheating wife in a divorce and the bank foreclosing on his business, Buddy goes postal. and takes care of all the things that bother him.

This is a slow developing slasher film. We never got to like Buddy or feel sorry for a guy who is his own biggest problem. As he becomes our only protagonist, we find ourselves in the awkward position of rooting for the guy slicing folks up.

May have some cult appeal, but the characters were just bad.

8702079,5,B00TJIUFI6,"Buddy Hutchins begins showing a man leaning against his kitchen cabinets holding a gun to his head with the cops approaching outside.  The story begins 60 days earlier.  Business isn't going so great for Buddy.  His business is falling apart.  His employees quit and say they can't work for free.  His brother drops by and gives him 12 grand to help with his store.  That's generous!  The brother likes men and is afraid to come around home since he thinks his mom will reject him.

The brother invites his boyfriend over to mom's house anyway.  Buddy picks up an electric guitar and plays an awesome line.  I swear that melody came from an old NES game involving wizards and goblins but I can't remember the name.  Buddy and his brother discuss the boyfriend and how he made a jerk of himself when Buddy's daughter did a song and dance and he said ""That's it?""  When Buddy picks up his daughter from school his brother's boyfriend comes around.  Buddy laughs at him for some reason and walks away giving him a mean look.  Buddy sneaks around and finds his wife cheating on him with another man.  He punches the man, the cops come by and Buddy gets arrested.

Buddy drops by to get his things but his wife won't let him in because she thinks he's becoming a monster.  He demands his guitar and clothes.  She won't let him see his daughter Molly.  The wife walks out the door with custody papers.  She also wants his house and cuts his phone number.  Wow, that's some hidden anger!  Buddy found out that when his mom bailed him out of jail it cost 10 grand.  He sells his cleaning business to pay for it.  In court the wife says Buddy's never been around and has a drinking problem, and she thinks she can support the children based on her teaching career.  Buddy says the relationship failed because she cheated on him.  The court shows no sympathy towards Buddy and the judge immediately thinks he's wrong no matter what he says.  The judge asks Buddy's kids if he ever lashed out violently.  The son says he'd often get intoxicated and pass out in front of the TV.

The judge asks the mom if she thinks his son is an alcoholic since he's had four DUI's.  The judge mentions he was three times over the legal drinking limit and almost caused an accident.  Thee judge easily awards the wife full custody of the children and makes Buddy pay $300 a month in child's support.  Buddy owes an employee $400 and won't pay up.  He opens his wallet and hands her money.  He gets kicked out of the cleaners.  While at home Buddy's son calls him an alcoholic and sides with mom by saying it's his own darn fault.  Buddy calls up his ex-wife drunk.  He cusses her out because she won't let him see Molly.  He staggers to his ex-wife's front door.  Buddy smacks his son when the family walks out the door.  The cop recommends walking away so he won't get arrested.  The cop seems forgiving almost, and again later on.

A mean man drops by Buddy's mom's house and says Buddy owes him 10 grand.  He writes a warning on a piece of paper that next him he's going to come in and take Buddy.  He says he's going to find him.  Dude, all you had to do was ask the mom where he is.  I'm sure she'd say!  Mom becomes hysterical and says he doesn't want his son to end up like his father.  Buddy says he'll figure out what to do while playing with his guitar.  The bank denies him a second loan.  Buddy calls his brother and says he needs help.  The brother says things always come up when he's drinking.

Buddy hangs out with a friend and says people are pieces of crap when the friend asks why his wealthy brother won't pay him money.  The mom has a heart attack according to the nurse, but says if she has a blockage she can't do anything.  When Buddy asks why the nurse says his mom doesn't have insurance.  Buddy calls his brother, explains the situation and says mom will be fine.  How does he know that if Buddy's the one sitting by her side at the hospital!  Buddy gets a hospital bill.  Yeah, that's the last thing he needs.

Buddy finds a newspaper in the garage that says his father killed his own brother.  Buddy asks mom at the hospital and she says he had his dark side.  Right when she's about to reveal the truth she dies.  Well that's not good timing!  Buddy travels to his father's home and asks how his brother died.  He says ""I think it's time you left Budd!""  The father gets angry when he says he had to kill his own brother.  The father says his brother is actually Buddy's father because the mother was a wh...  The guy says if he could do it all over... he wouldn't change a thing.

Buddy's ex-girlfriend's boyfriend confronts Buddy and makes him pay up.  The man threatens to destroy his guitar.  Buddy retaliates and smashes the guitar over his head.  He's had enough, but why waste a good guitar?  He tosses his ex-girlfriend around when she walks in a moment later.  When the cop comes by at night Buddy says he's doing some gardening. ""In a suit?"" says the cop.  When the cop hears his ex-girlfriend scream Buddy instantly gets violent and smacks the cop around.  He then shoots the cop and throws him in a hole in the backyard.  He hides the cop car in the garage and visits his daughter after she performed in a play.  Buddy calls sexual names to his ex-wife and says he hates her.  When he drives home a detective asks him what he was doing.  He also tells this guy he was gardening!

Buddy tells his girlfriend his predicament.  He went to visit his father who he found out was his uncle, and his uncle killed the man who was his real dad.  They were both banging his mom who just died. Who he loved very much!  His son won't talk to him.  His wife is banging a substitute French teacher, he just killed his girlfriend's black boyfriend and his dry cleaning business is gone.  He fires up the chainsaw and cuts up his ex-girlfriend.

Buddy calls his brother and the brother recommends he make himself a drink and stir it with his whiskey weinee.  Buddy shows up to his brother's house with a chainsaw.  The brother asks if he's here to chop some trees.  He cuts the boyfriend's head off for that little ""That's it?"" comment towards Molly in the beginning.  Buddy mentions the predicament with his father and uncle to his brother.  The brother asks if he's going to kill him since he has cameras all over.  Buddy says ""Let them watch!"" and takes the chainsaw to the top of his brother's head.  ""That's for mom!""

While covered in blood he stumbles into his friend.  The friend asks if everything's okay.  Buddy drinks a beer.  Buddy storms into his ex-wife's home after telling his daughter's friend to hide in the outside tent.  Buddy tells his daughter to wait out in the car so he can have a discussion with the ex-wife's boyfriend.  He tells the boyfriend that he has a question for him.  ""How long have you been having sex with my wife?""  ""Two years"" the boyfriend responds.  Buddy asks about sexual positions.  The boyfriend won't answer.  Why not?  :)

The boyfriend says ""I don't like it when you break into my house and talk to me this way!""  Buddy says ""Cry me a river!""  The boyfriend punches Buddy repeatedly, but Buddy is able to smack him with a bat.  He shouldn't be laying there defenseless.  At least not right away.  One smack which was more like a push and the boyfriend can't get up!  Buddy pulls out a gun and shoots the boyfriend getting the attention of the little girl in a tent.  Buddy tells the little girl he didn't mean to kill her father but he was having sex with his wife, and she'll understand one day.

Buddy drives away with Molly as the cops follow.  Buddy says no matter what happens he'll never hurt her.  Buddy takes a hostage, hides in the house then shoots the guy's legs. The cop tells Buddy to surrender for Molly.  Buddy tells Molly to walk outside even though she doesn't want to.  He turns on the stove and grabs a container of gasoline that happens to be under the kitchen sink cabinet.  Huh, who puts gas there?  He lights a match and boom boom!  Buddy escapes out the side window.

The cops say to Buddy's ex-wife and Molly that he's sorry for their loss.  Meanwhile Buddy goes downtown to put a band together in some room.  I guess he'll need a new guitar, lol.  Molly and Buddy's friend come in.  Not sure how they knew he was hiding there.

This movie's awesome!  Lots of action, and a solid story about a man who keeps getting crapped on time and time again due to money problems to the point he can't tolerate it and snaps.  The ending's pretty lame though.  We needed more storyline there I think.  Otherwise a great easy to follow movie.",1500768000,,8602,4.375634517766497
