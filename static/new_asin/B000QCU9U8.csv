8195569,1,B000QCU9U8,The  double DVD of cattle Queen of Montana and Tennesse's partner were both a very poor transfer and also both were in 4.3 aspect instead of 1.85 cattle queen of Montana and 2.00 for Tennesse's Partner (Superscope)so I would not recomend this DVD to anybody who Likes their Movies in the correct aspect ratio.,1279670400,4,309,4.722222222222222
