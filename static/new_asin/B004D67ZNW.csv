8595694,5,B004D67ZNW,"This is a story about surf culture and tradition...One California Day is a journey up the coast, through six distinct coastal regions, exploring California's surf experience through the surfers who live it. Not just another 16mm film, the film includes a killer soundtrack, and some great cinematography. Go with the 2 disc version if you can afford it. The special features are awesome, and you can't go wrong with a tour of Greg Noll's shape shack. ;)",1323993600,,453,4.896103896103896
