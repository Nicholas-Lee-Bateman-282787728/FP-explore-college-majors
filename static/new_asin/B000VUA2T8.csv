2953530,2,B000VUA2T8,"I bought this video because I had liked Michelle's other videos (Basic lesson and drum solo), however I was totally disappointed when I watched it. This video presents exactly the same material as in the other 2 but shortened! What a rip-off...I wish this had been mentioned, that's why I gave it only 2 stars. The material itself is quite good for serious learners of belly dance.",1199059200,59,381,4.701492537313433
2953531,4,B000VUA2T8,"At first Michelle is kind of intimidating, the warm up is a little fast to begin with but she definately knows what she's doing. You can tell she is also a personal trainer. I like the open dance studio look with a mirror behind her so her, you feel like your are at a lesson. The only 2 things I didn't like is in one part she's talking to the mirror and the cool down leaves quite a bit to be desired. All in all it was a great work out. I can feel my thighs and abs working the whole time and my heart got going. If you want a more toned down and informative video Amira's Bellydance 101 is also a great choice.",1198022400,9,614,3.92
2953532,5,B000VUA2T8,"Oh my gosh my legs are on fire! I really felt the burn after doing the section on core conditioning. She is one very fit and talented dancer.
The things I liked about this DVD was
1)she explains the movements briefly, not over and over like some others I've seen/heard
2) the way its broken into segments so I can just click on the workout section I want to review
3)she is warm and calm, never shows any diva attitude, nice smile
4)Easy to follow
5)she instructs facing a mirror which is SO mush easier to follow along to, than having to reverse your movements because the teacher is facing YOU
6)the lighting and mirror/backdrop is not distracting at all-no funky computer generated backgrounds
7) the bonus performance at the end with the beautiful and talented Zaheea
8)she wears workout clothes that show what her body is doing, no skirts that cover up what her knees are doing
9) the camera angles show her whole body, not just shots of her face or specific body parts that happen to be moving
I only wish it was a tad longer with perhaps another different workout with a little more traveling. But still, its very good and you will get crisper isolations following this video continually. LOVED this DVD and I'm going to buy all the others she has out too. Michelle is truly a dancers dancer.",1193356800,97,1299,4.531914893617022
2953533,5,B000VUA2T8,"A really good workout - which is kinda rare in bellydance workout DVDs. Plus, it teaches real belly dance technique.  Good for people just wanting some kind of different way to get fit, but a really good introduction and foundation for the dance.",1193270400,20,246,4.72093023255814
2953534,5,B000VUA2T8,"I took belly dance lessons at my local community center, but wanted to continue practicing at home. I like the instruction format and layout of the progression. I would recommend this to anyone interested in belly dancing. Beginners and experienced dancers can use this video as a work out.

2953535,5,B000VUA2T8,"I have no coordination.  I like to dance but I'm not that good at it.  I'm in decent shape but can definitely lose more than a few pounds.  This DVD makes me move, work up a sweat and seems to be something  this klutz can handle. If I can do it - you can do it. The ""exercises"" or ""moves"" are easy - don't worry if you look like an idiot in your living room - no one is watching.  This video gave me noticeable results in a week or so.  I felt my core tightening , my butt a bit firmer and I felt a little sexier.  Stumbled upon this video.  I am now a fan.",1310515200,5,557,3.700854700854701
2953536,5,B000VUA2T8,"this DVD seemed to have everything I needed for continued belly dancing instruction. I try to learn everything I can on my own and this DVD is very well broken down and the right important things are stressed...however the instructor is WAY more limber than I am...it makes me confident that I will get to that point which is also a goal of mine.

I have been using belly dancing in combination with Physical Therapy as a way to strengthen my core and back due to my Scoliosis going untreated for 20 years which has caused a straightening of my neck and at least one herniated disc in my neck. I've been in constant pain for 10 years.  the posture alone is helping to reduce the amount of pain in my neck, back, and shoulder.

I should say however that I did not do any belly dancing with out clearing it with my doctor before hand. He was very impressed by my progress, commenting on my last session with him that I was in better shape than him in the abdominal department. I felt this was very telling and made me very proud of my progress!

this is the PERFECT companion to Princess Farhana's ""belly dance basics"" dvd. and I swtich between the two to balance my work out!

also PERFECT for the beginner!! for anyone interested in Belly Dance this is a keeper!!! it's beautiful and fun and you don't know you are strengthening and toning your body...you are just having fun!!!",1307750400,4,1378,4.430830039525691
2953537,5,B000VUA2T8,"I definitely recommend this DVD to everybody: the workout is simply perfect, well explained, easy to follow and really effective (muscles burn, indeed!).

2953538,4,B000VUA2T8,"This video is great for those lacking coordination-the reason I state this is, the cuing is great and the moves are explained in detail. Also, what NOT to do is explained. I will use this video and improve coordination and tone up!!!",1292716800,3,233,4.571428571428571
2953539,1,B000VUA2T8,I bought this product for my sister she was incredibly disapointed because this product would not work in any of her 4 dvd playes and computer. This product is cheaply made please do not waste your time and money on this product.,1279670400,,229,4.476190476190476
2953540,1,B000VUA2T8,"As someone else has written about this product, the DVD wouldn't play.  It would play the song over and over, but I was unable to click on any of any of the titles to get the workout started. I am overseas now so I can't return it.",1276646400,,231,3.9148936170212765
2953541,5,B000VUA2T8,"When I started working out with this video I was out of shape. Really out of shape. I liked this video because it worked with me for a long time. I was frustrated when I began, but the instructor was not annoying and the workout was fun so I stuck with it and eventually got to a point where I could work through the hard parts. I've just now begun to think about getting one of her more advanced videos  after a year of dedication with this one.

I would say this is a great way to begin belly dancing, but don't expect to be perfect at it over night. You'll feel like you've worked out after the video but it will take you a while to be good at it if you are a true beginner. Just keep with it and do the best you can. I lost a lot of weight with this video and feel great so I would definitely suggest that anyone who is interested in something new to start here.",1270252800,4,866,3.942857142857143
2953542,5,B000VUA2T8,Want to learn belly dancing and tone-up while doing it?  This video will definitely get the job done.  I have had it for quite some time and I always review it from time to time to maintain my core and touch up on sexy dance moves.  Gotta love this!!!!,1267056000,3,252,4.1020408163265305
2953543,1,B000VUA2T8,"First of all, from the very start the video was chopped up and confusing. The workout segments wouldn't raise the heart rate of a 90 year old and the whole thing was a complete failure. What it really looks like is a bored house wife with very little belly dance expertise who wanted to make a video. I feel completely ripped off!",1264809600,2,330,4.338709677419355
2953544,4,B000VUA2T8,"I've noticed a lot of people warning more advanced dancers off of this DVD, but it's still decent for drilling if you add in some arms and/or traveling for an added challenge, and her warmup is one that all dancers would benefit from.  While this DVD isn't as useful to me as when I first got it, I still really enjoy Michelle Joyce's approach.  Her camera person is almost always where s/he needs to be, her instructions are clear and precise, she uses the mirror well and she thinks to lift her pants when you need to be able to see what her legs are doing.  Beyond that, her introduction to posture and how to properly achieve it was one of the simplest, yet most clear, I've ever seen.  My only real quibble is the section where she ""puts it all together.""  She's not the only instructor I've seen do this, but I'd love it a lot more if she'd call out the moves she was about to do.  I've always felt one step behind her.  The other drawback is that despite the decent muscle workout, I've never had more than a slightly elevated heart rate from doing this particular DVD (even with added movement).  Other Joyce DVDs provide a superior cardio workout for those who are looking for it in a bellydance DVD.",1263600000,4,1209,4.366071428571429
2953545,5,B000VUA2T8,THis was the perfect purchase for a beginner.  She really breaks down the basic moves so that you really understand what it is you should be doing.  I wouldn't recommend it for someone who already has a good background in belly dance.  If you are new to belly dance it is a must have.,1255478400,2,284,4.222222222222222
2953546,5,B000VUA2T8,"So, after looking around at several belly dance videos, I settled on this one. I am very pleased I did! The workout is broken down nicely, with a warm up section, core strengthening, breakdown of moves, where she explains each move she will do in the video, and then putting it all together, in which she turns the exercise into a dance. The setting is very nice, as she's in front of a mirror with limited decorations to distract you. She explains how to do each move, and what it helps work out. The camera is good about focusing on what you need to see. Also, there is no neo age language going on. She doesn't ramble about being goddess' or anything like that. I don't have a problem with talk like that, but when I'm trying to work out, I'm not interested in it.

I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an introduction to basic belly dance moves who wants to get in shape.",1246233600,3,891,4.335329341317365
2953547,4,B000VUA2T8,"I have used a bellydance video before (the ""bellydance twins""), and so I have a tiny bit of experience with it.  I do like this DVD; the instructor talks in a personable way, not the usual breathy or ""you can do it!!"" type.  The moves are broken down in such a way that it's easy to understand what you need to do and goes slow enough that most people could keep up without a problem.  My only issue is that the DVD is more instructional in bellydance than a workout.  Once you have the moves down pat, then you could move on to the advanced portion and that would be a workout, but the first segments go far too slow.  I ""felt the burn"", but that probably has more to do with being VERY out of shape than the difficulty of the routine.  If you work out on a regular basis, this would be something to shake up your weekly routine but you probably won't be physically challenged.  I will use the DVD, and I hope it might improve my flexibility and core, but I don't expect to really burn calories from this until I can make it through the advanced segment.",1239926400,3,1055,4.193069306930693
2953548,1,B000VUA2T8,"I received a defective DVD - the thing was stuck on the intro and just played the same song, over and over.  I returned it for exchange and received yet ANOTHER one, with the same problem.  I attempted to play both of these on more than one machine and got the same (non)results.  Retirned for refund and will not order from this seller again.",1236124800,,343,4.328125

2953553,1,B000VUA2T8,"I find this dvd very boring.  There is no flow to the exercise section, just individual segments.  I usually end up forwarding through much of the dvd because I find the music annoying & I don't like how the instructor spends so much time breaking down the moves.  That is fine when you are just learning but not when you have already watched it a couple of times & just want a good, fun workout.  I don't really like her outfit as she seems to spend too much time adjusting her pants so we can see what her legs & feet are doing.  I much prefer the video tape (yes, a tape) I have by Veena & Neena Bidasha.  I have had that tape for years & still work out to it.  I still get a burn in my shoulders & arms.  I am going to purchase an actual dvd of their before my video tape dies...",1224979200,4,783,3.9426751592356686
2953554,5,B000VUA2T8,This is great if you have never bellydanced before.  It is easy to understand and also gives you a great workout.  Its a lot of fun and is a good intro into bellydance.  I would recomend it to anyone who is just starting out.,1223251200,5,225,4.068181818181818
2953555,2,B000VUA2T8,"I found this video to be on the amateur side-the instructor was not good at explaining the moves (at one point saying ""you know""-no I don't know!) and the video looked as if someone had made it in their basement. It is a cheap, basic video but not well-produced.",1221004800,5,262,4.36734693877551
2953556,5,B000VUA2T8,"For 80 minutes worth, this by far is one of the best bellydance instructional dvds for the absolute beginner. Michelle is a great teacher, a great dancer, she is kind and encouraging but at the same time you can tell she is serious is about what she teaches, she speaks in a clear, professional tone and voice, explains things slowly and carefully, and always gets to the point of things. She starts off with these excellent warm-up exercises and yoga-type conditioning, then begins to break down basic movements, moves on to some not-so basic movements, puts all the movements together, and teaches you 2 pre-shimmy drills. Plus the music and bellydance performance at the end by Zaheea is priceless. I highly recommend purchasing her ""Perfect Hips"" along with her ""Pop, Lock, & Shimmy"" as it is truly intermediat level. Also, it would be a good idea to also purachese ""Drills, Drills, Drills"" and ""Body By Bellydance"" as it teaches layering techniques and some more advanced layer combos, plus finger cymbals!

2953557,4,B000VUA2T8,VERY PLEASED WITH THIS BEGINNERS VIDEO. I HAVE NO EXPERIENCE AT ALL AND THIS VIDEO WAS EASY TO FOLLOW. GREAT STARTING POINT,1219017600,,123,4.636363636363637

2953559,4,B000VUA2T8,I feel this is a great video for those just beginning to bellydance. The only downfall would be that you cant forward to different sections. You have to watch it virtually all the way through even if you only want to practice a certain move,1215216000,3,240,4.355555555555555
2953560,2,B000VUA2T8,"I'm so glad I had some belly dancing experience, because I would have been lost without it. this dvd might be useful for an in shape belly dancer who wants to keep in shape. It is NOT an exercise tape for anyone who is out of shape.

The first problem is the set up. There's a lot of forwarding through stuff you don't need to watch more than once, or are too out of shape to do. You end up feeling bad for ""skipping"" things you physically. can. not. do.

The second problem is the ""warm ups"" A beginer is going to have a hard time getting into that cross legged position, and one stretch requires you to remain in a wide stanced squat for the better part of five minutes.

The ""cool down"" consists of her telling you that cool downs are important, but she doesn't actually walk you through any cool down stretches. Stretches can be vastly different depending on which muscles you worked.

Unless you already know your stuff, I wouldn't reccomend this.  I'll suffer through it once a week, but only out of stubborness to get my money's worth (It's going to take awhile)",1211932800,9,1069,4.378787878787879
2953561,5,B000VUA2T8,"This DVD is great!  Perfect for the beginner-it doesn't make you feel stupid or clumsy!  She really breaks down the moves-it does take several tries to really get them (or at least it did for me) but it is very cool when you do. At the end of the work out you feel worked out and sexy-that's a new combo for me.  It is fun and a great break from regular old exercises.

I highly recommend this for beginners",1211328000,5,407,4.113924050632911

But if your simply starting out and trying something new, this is the one! the only one thing is that perhaps the instructor fussed with her hair a little to much, maybe should have used a pony tail..laffs",1206489600,20,537,4.2745098039215685

Although I'm not quite sure if I will ever have ""perfect"" hips, I am sure that this dvd will help me get back in shape quickly. Michelle Joyce has come up with a fun workout that not only covers basic bellydance movements but gets your heart rate going as well. The excercises may be a little challenging at first for someone who is totally out of shape but none of the moves are high impact so even the most devout couch potato can use this workout without fear of serious injury or heart attack! Michelle has a friendly personality and a warm, conversational approach to teaching that makes it a pleasure to follow along with her instructions and demonstrations.

It is also probably as close as anyone is going to get to an ""all-in-one"" instruction and workout combined. Michelle breaks down the moves clearly so that even a total beginner can follow along, yet it is still athetically challenging enough for a more experienced dancer. I would definitely reccomend this DVD to anyone interested in bellydance or fitness.",1204502400,5,487,4.879518072289157
2953567,4,B000VUA2T8,"Let me start by saying the meat of this DVD is great! I have been belly dancing for about a year now, and purchased this DVD to add to my home workout rotation to supplement the classes I take. Even with that experience I still found the workout a good challenge.  There's even a more 'advanced' section that includes shimmies. Michelle's breakdown section even put a few more things into better perspective for me, so that's another big plus.

These are the things that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating:

The warmup and cooldown are a bit lacking. The thing you need to watch out for is one of the first moves in the warmup is a rather aggressive stretch. If you haven't been dancing for a while or are fairly sedentary before you start using this DVD... Warm up a little bit even before the workout's warm up. Once you get beyond that first part, it is a decent warmup. The cooldown, I felt like 'why bother with putting it in there?' I just do my own stretching instead.

The overall production of the DVD. I really wish the menu were broken down even further than it was. On other DVDs I have, there is the main menu which has the sections, but they break each section down even further. This works better for those of us who pick out sections to focus on. Yes, that's a bit nitpicky I admit, but I think the production looks a lot more pro when its broken down like that.

Is it worth the money? Yes. I'll be including it in my DVD workout rotation. My thighs and hips definitely felt the burn. And, I can't stress this enough...anybody who is starting to work out or do any form of belly dancing, pay attention to your body and work within its limitations.",1203811200,27,1668,4.31629392971246

I was so excited to use this video, but I decided to pay for another class at the YMCA and won't be using this DVD.

I only wish it was a tad longer with perhaps another different workout with a little more traveling. But still, its very good and you will get crisper isolations following this video continually.

3188033,5,B000VUA2T8,"this DVD seemed to have everything I needed for continued belly dancing instruction. I try to learn everything I can on my own and this DVD is very well broken down and the right important things are stressed...however the instructor is WAY more limber than I am...it makes me confident that I will get to that point which is also a goal of mine.

I have been using belly dancing in combination with Physical Therapy as a way to strengthen my core and back due to my Scoliosis going untreated for 20 years which has caused a straightening of my neck and at least one herniated disc in my neck. I've been in constant pain for 10 years.  the posture alone is helping to reduce the amount of pain in my neck, back, and shoulder.

I should say however that I did not do any belly dancing with out clearing it with my doctor before hand. He was very impressed by my progress, commenting on my last session with him that I was in better shape than him in the abdominal department. I felt this was very telling and made me very proud of my progress!

this is the PERFECT companion to Princess Farhana's ""belly dance basics"" dvd. and I swtich between the two to balance my work out!

also PERFECT for the beginner!! for anyone interested in Belly Dance this is a keeper!!! it's beautiful and fun and you don't know you are strengthening and toning your body...you are just having fun!!!",1307750400,4,1378,4.430830039525691

I was frustrated when I began, but the instructor was not annoying and the workout was fun so I stuck with it and eventually got to a point where I could work through the hard parts. I've just now begun to think about getting one of her more advanced videos  after a year of dedication with this one.

I would say this is a great way to begin belly dancing, but don't expect to be perfect at it over night. You'll feel like you've worked out after the video but it will take you a while to be good at it if you are a true beginner. Just keep with it and do the best you can.

3188041,4,B000VUA2T8,"I've noticed a lot of people warning more advanced dancers off of this DVD, but it's still decent for drilling if you add in some arms and/or traveling for an added challenge, and her warmup is one that all dancers would benefit from.  While this DVD isn't as useful to me as when I first got it, I still really enjoy Michelle Joyce's approach.  Her camera person is almost always where s/he needs to be, her instructions are clear and precise, she uses the mirror well and she thinks to lift her pants when you need to be able to see what her legs are doing.  Beyond that, her introduction to posture and how to properly achieve it was one of the simplest, yet most clear, I've ever seen.  My only real quibble is the section where she ""puts it all together.""  She's not the only instructor I've seen do this, but I'd love it a lot more if she'd call out the moves she was about to do.  I've always felt one step behind her.  The other drawback is that despite the decent muscle workout, I've never had more than a slightly elevated heart rate from doing this particular DVD (even with added movement).  Other Joyce DVDs provide a superior cardio workout for those who are looking for it in a bellydance DVD.",1263600000,4,1209,4.366071428571429
3188042,5,B000VUA2T8,THis was the perfect purchase for a beginner.  She really breaks down the basic moves so that you really understand what it is you should be doing.

3188043,5,B000VUA2T8,"So, after looking around at several belly dance videos, I settled on this one. I am very pleased I did! The workout is broken down nicely, with a warm up section, core strengthening, breakdown of moves, where she explains each move she will do in the video, and then putting it all together, in which she turns the exercise into a dance. The setting is very nice, as she's in front of a mirror with limited decorations to distract you. She explains how to do each move, and what it helps work out. The camera is good about focusing on what you need to see. Also, there is no neo age language going on. She doesn't ramble about being goddess' or anything like that. I don't have a problem with talk like that, but when I'm trying to work out, I'm not interested in it.

I would recommend this product to anyone looking for an introduction to basic belly dance moves who wants to get in shape.",1246233600,3,891,4.335329341317365
3188044,4,B000VUA2T8,"I have used a bellydance video before (the ""bellydance twins""), and so I have a tiny bit of experience with it.  I do like this DVD; the instructor talks in a personable way, not the usual breathy or ""you can do it!!"" type.  The moves are broken down in such a way that it's easy to understand what you need to do and goes slow enough that most people could keep up without a problem.  My only issue is that the DVD is more instructional in bellydance than a workout.  Once you have the moves down pat, then you could move on to the advanced portion and that would be a workout, but the first segments go far too slow.  I ""felt the burn"", but that probably has more to do with being VERY out of shape than the difficulty of the routine.  If you work out on a regular basis, this would be something to shake up your weekly routine but you probably won't be physically challenged.  I will use the DVD, and I hope it might improve my flexibility and core, but I don't expect to really burn calories from this until I can make it through the advanced segment.",1239926400,3,1055,4.193069306930693

I usually end up forwarding through much of the dvd because I find the music annoying & I don't like how the instructor spends so much time breaking down the moves.  That is fine when you are just learning but not when you have already watched it a couple of times & just want a good, fun workout.  I don't really like her outfit as she seems to spend too much time adjusting her pants so we can see what her legs & feet are doing.  I much prefer the video tape (yes, a tape) I have by Veena & Neena Bidasha.  I have had that tape for years & still work out to it.  I still get a burn in my shoulders & arms.

3188053,5,B000VUA2T8,"For 80 minutes worth, this by far is one of the best bellydance instructional dvds for the absolute beginner. Michelle is a great teacher, a great dancer, she is kind and encouraging but at the same time you can tell she is serious is about what she teaches, she speaks in a clear, professional tone and voice, explains things slowly and carefully, and always gets to the point of things. She starts off with these excellent warm-up exercises and yoga-type conditioning, then begins to break down basic movements, moves on to some not-so basic movements, puts all the movements together, and teaches you 2 pre-shimmy drills. Plus the music and bellydance performance at the end by Zaheea is priceless. I highly recommend purchasing her ""Perfect Hips"" along with her ""Pop, Lock, & Shimmy"" as it is truly intermediat level. Also, it would be a good idea to also purachese ""Drills, Drills, Drills"" and ""Body By Bellydance"" as it teaches layering techniques and some more advanced layer combos, plus finger cymbals!

3188056,4,B000VUA2T8,I feel this is a great video for those just beginning to bellydance. The only downfall would be that you cant forward to different sections. You have to watch it virtually all the way through even if you only want to practice a certain move,1215216000,3,240,4.355555555555555
3188057,2,B000VUA2T8,"I'm so glad I had some belly dancing experience, because I would have been lost without it. this dvd might be useful for an in shape belly dancer who wants to keep in shape. It is NOT an exercise tape for anyone who is out of shape.

The first problem is the set up. There's a lot of forwarding through stuff you don't need to watch more than once, or are too out of shape to do. You end up feeling bad for ""skipping"" things you physically. can. not. do.

The second problem is the ""warm ups"" A beginer is going to have a hard time getting into that cross legged position, and one stretch requires you to remain in a wide stanced squat for the better part of five minutes.

The ""cool down"" consists of her telling you that cool downs are important, but she doesn't actually walk you through any cool down stretches. Stretches can be vastly different depending on which muscles you worked.

Unless you already know your stuff, I wouldn't reccomend this.  I'll suffer through it once a week, but only out of stubborness to get my money's worth (It's going to take awhile)",1211932800,9,1069,4.378787878787879

3188064,4,B000VUA2T8,"Let me start by saying the meat of this DVD is great! I have been belly dancing for about a year now, and purchased this DVD to add to my home workout rotation to supplement the classes I take. Even with that experience I still found the workout a good challenge.  There's even a more 'advanced' section that includes shimmies. Michelle's breakdown section even put a few more things into better perspective for me, so that's another big plus.

These are the things that kept me from giving it a 5 star rating:

The warmup and cooldown are a bit lacking. The thing you need to watch out for is one of the first moves in the warmup is a rather aggressive stretch. If you haven't been dancing for a while or are fairly sedentary before you start using this DVD... Warm up a little bit even before the workout's warm up. Once you get beyond that first part, it is a decent warmup. The cooldown, I felt like 'why bother with putting it in there?' I just do my own stretching instead.

The overall production of the DVD. I really wish the menu were broken down even further than it was. On other DVDs I have, there is the main menu which has the sections, but they break each section down even further. This works better for those of us who pick out sections to focus on. Yes, that's a bit nitpicky I admit, but I think the production looks a lot more pro when its broken down like that.

Is it worth the money? Yes. I'll be including it in my DVD workout rotation. My thighs and hips definitely felt the burn. And, I can't stress this enough...anybody who is starting to work out or do any form of belly dancing, pay attention to your body and work within its limitations.",1203811200,27,1668,4.31629392971246
