1061816,2,6305710392,"The anticipation of this event was phenominal but once i read the card, i thought it was gonna be a flop. About 3 of the 9 matches actually had stories behind them, why is D'Lo/Godfather fighting Bossman/Bull Buchanen,  i thought this match was ok for a bossman match but why was this match on  the card along with about 4 others. It did have some good matches like the  Triangle Ladder Match and the Main Event but to see HHH, the WWF's biggest  heel to walk out of WMania the champ was wrong. This is the 1st WM where  the heel walks out champ and it spoilt the event. Mick Foley or the Rock  should have won the title, more ratings and sales would be produced if one  of those guys won. In my opinion, hardcore WWf fans buy it, but if you just  wanna see some action, buy the Rumble, more action and better storylines.",955065600,,821,4.217948717948718

P.S  Buy it",954633600,,302,3.7777777777777777
1062001,3,6305710392,"Clearly this event was heavily hyped up, especially the Triangle Ladder Match and the Fatal Four Way Elimination featuring Mick Foley in his last offical match (of the year).

It stirs nostalgia from the days I used to watch in early 2000, and hearing the electrifying screams given to Foley and The Rock before their match is... well, electrifying.

But looking back... it sucked!  The event, aside from one or two matches, utterly sucked!

The Godfather and D'Lo Brown vs The Big Boss Man and Bull Buchanan
Ugh... this got off to a wretched start with Ice-T performing Godfather's theme (from WWF Aggression) live.  And as another reviewer put it, ""an awkward musical performance"" doesn't do the sheer rigidity and lack of force in the song justice.  It was just dead.  And it felt like Ice-T was sputtering on the mic, repeating over and over and over ""Pimpinain, pimpinaint easy man, pimpinain, pimpinain't easy man, pimpinain, pimpinain't easy man, pimpinain, pimpinain't easy man, pimpinain, pimpinain't easy man, pimpinain, pimpinain't easy man.""

When the match finally DID start, I was only impressed by Boss Man and Buchanan, who managed to both enter and exit in unison, and perform with a very strong chemistry between them.  Other than that, the match was a massive bust.  And not like the Godfather's hos (stupid joke).  (3/10)

13 Man Battle Royal for the Hardcore Championship
For fifteen minutes, the bottom of the barrel WWF Superstars attempted to condense an entire legacy of great, classic, and comic moments from Hardcore Championship battles, both matches and outdoor events caught on camera, and it failed miserably.  All your favorites like Headbanger Thrasher and Headbanger Mosh beat up on Bradshaw and Crash Holly, while Rodney and Joey Abs throw around the likes of Viscera and... Hardcore Holly.  The match had nothing going for it, except to have as many people as possible hitting each other with random hardcore objects as much as possible.  That was about it.

Also, botched ending: Hardcore Holly was supposed to go for the pin with only two seconds left, and thus not win because time would run out.  Hardcore went for the pin too early, and the referee was clearly hesitant, as he didn't hit the 3, even though it did come down.  There was definite confusion as Crash took the title and started heading up the ramp while Howard Finkel said, ""The winner of this match... and new hardcore champion..........................Hardcore Holly!""  Jim Ross kept strongly pushing that Crash got his shoulder up in time, when replays clearly show he was down, and never lifted a thing.  (2/10)

They also removed the funny promo done later on where Hardcore Holly calls Michael Cole a shithead.

Al Snow and Steve Blackman vs T&A
Not to enforce Mick Foley jokes, but clearly the crowd was simply dead here.  There will be no Best of Al Snow tapes with matches like these littering his career.  It was dull as an Al Snow match outside of ECW, and the Hardcore division in the WWF could be.  And Steve Blackman really didn't look very good out there with Test and Albert.  Al Snow's mascot sucked, too, and I'm usually prone to liking stupid ideas like that.  (0/10)

Triangle Ladder Match for the Tag Team Championship
The Dudley Boys vs Edge and Christian vs The Hardy Boyz
This match is a classic, and for good reason.  A vast amount of effort was put forth by everyone involved, with great spots coming regularly, and well spaced apart to keep it random and involving.  Rather than typical ladder matches which start slow, build up, peak, and then wind down, this one was like a plateau, rising up, stagnating at its best, and ending with a small bang that didn't outdo the previous spots in the match.  Rather sluggish at times, but clearly the WWF's best.  (10/10).

Terri Runnels vs The Kat
THANK YOU WWF!  I WAS HAVING TOO MUCH FUN IN THAT LAST MATCH!  I NEEDED A LAME AND COMPLETELY UNNECESSARY AND UNENTERTAINING CAT FIGHT TO COOL ME DOWN!  I ENJOY HOW VINCE GIVETH, AND VINCE TAKETH AWAY.  Although I did enjoy seeing Mae Young kiss Val Venis.  (0/10)

The Radicalz vs Too Cool and Chyna
All of the Radicalz (including GUY WHO NEVER EXISTED, according to the WWE) are phenomenal athletes, and even in the WWF, with their wings clipped, they managed to fly a bit.  This match had everything going for it except one loose end.  Everyone was on their best, from Eddie and Dean and Perry, to Too Cool.  Chyna was an absolute mess.  She botched several moves, made half-hearted attempts at punches and clotheslines, and really made an awkward scene in her time in the match.  Shocking that such a great athlete as her could have bombed so badly in a potential mid-card showstealer.  (6.5/10)

Two out of Three Falls match for the European and Intercontinental Championship
Kurt Angle (C)(C) vs Chris Jericho vs NO ONE ELSE
This is supposedly a classic... but it was no technical feast like NONEXISTENT PERSON's matches in ECW, or Chris Jericho's ECW run, or matches like Eddie Guerrero vs Dean Malenko in WCW.  This one felt hesitant, like the superstars weren't allowed to pull out their best.  Aside from some high spots, this one was few and far between, with Jericho winning a title, and PERSON WHO DOES NOT EXIST winning another, leaving Angle without titles.  (4/10)

Road Dogg and X-Pac vs Kane and Rikishi Phatu
Barely five minutes were given to this ordeal, which seemed little more than an excuse to feature Too Cool and Rikishi dance, and Kane beat up on Pete Rose for the third year in a row.  Everything else was completely and utterly forgettable.  And watching Kane glare at the chicken mascot dancing with Too Cool was awkward, especially considering Kane being a face and thus not supposed to attack Too Cool.  It was even more awkward watching Too Cool dance a little to Kane's music as he left.  (1/10)

Fatal Four Way Elimination Match for WWF Championship
Mick Foley vs The Big Show vs The Rock vs Triple H (C)
There was a McMahon in Every Corner, with Shane behind the Big Show, Vince behind The Rock, Stephanie behind Triple H, and Linda behind Mick Foley.  While a novel concept, it really was too much, and by the end of the match, completely overwhelmed the match itself.

For nearly forty minutes, these four had a mostly dull match featuring the very best (or worst) in clotheslines, pillowstrikes, stomps, and the occasional DDT or Suplex.  This was no classic brawl like Dude Love vs Stone Cold Steve Austin, or a classic semi-athletic bout like The Rock vs Stone Cold Steve Austin (is that a theme running here?) and clearly Mick Foley was completely past his prime.  He was right in retiring when he did, but this match was clearly one too many.

It was literally sickening to hear Mick Foley as he attempted an elbow drop to The Rock laying on the Spanish Announcer's Table outside... only to completely miss The Rock, and smash his sternum into the table.  It was a terrifying sound, and sounded and looked far worse than Foley's bumps in the 1998 Hell in a Cell match.

After being pinned, Foley received a heroic sendoff, with a standing ovation from the audience as he headed back... but not after returning to hit Triple H with the barbed wire bat (which surprisingly, HHH didn't blade to!).

Just with The Rock and Triple H left, the match became secondary to the conflict with the McMahons, with Shane and Vince brawling outside the ring, until Vince turned on The Rock, allowing Triple H the win, while Steph and Vince hugged, and Shane got knocked down again by his dad.  Truly a horrific main event which didn't have that much potential to begin with.  The one highlight is that The Big Show looked incredible in it, with him and the rest beautifully selling his large size and power, without making him invincible.  (4/10)

All in all, the Triangle Ladder Match was the showstealer, and everything else was a letdownw for one reason or another.  Clearly an inferior Wrestlemania, and definitely overrated in my mind.",1193788800,,7990,4.753812636165577

1062005,5,6305710392,"Fatal Fourway No DQ McMahon in every corner match.

The match started at a good pace, All 3 men attacked the Big Show, as the Big Show was domernating the first five minutes, but just when you thought Big Show was going to fight all 3 men, then shane McMahon tried to distract The Rock, but to no prevail as the rock rock bottomed The Big Show, to get the elimination after 7 min. The match slowed down a lot with Mick Foley and The Rock ganging up on HHH, It turned suddenly as Mick Foley turned on the Rock. Foley also missed a jump from the top ropes which surely broke a rib or even a rib cage, Foley continued as Rock went through a table, as soon as Mick Foley got in the Ring, HHH gave him a thunderess Pedigree, but Mick kicked out, The crowd went wild, the HHH hit mick with a chair on his head then went for the pedigree on the chair, Foley was eliminated. Foley then thanked the crowd, but as soon as Mick was leaving the ring he gave HHH a look and came back and hit HHH with the barbed wire 2 X 4. Mick Foley left with the crowd going mad, The Rock came in and covered HHH, but HHH kicked out, The match went on four another 20min, with HHH going through a table, Shane McMahon came out and beat the crap out of Mr McMahon, and cut him open, the Vince had to be taken to the back and as soon as Shane was going to screw the Rock, Vince came back and destroyed Shane, The Rock the Rock Bottemed HHH, and he was looking like he was going to get the win untill Vince hit the rock with a chair, but rock still kicked out, then Vince hit rock again. HHH covered the the rock for the 1-2-3. The Rock was madd and Rock Bottomed Vince, Shane and Stephanie McMahon. The crowd were throwing litter in the ring, then The Rock hit Stephanie McMahon with the peoples Elbow.

2. 15 Minute Hardcore Championship Battle Royal

champ Crash vs. Tazz vs. Head Bangers vs. A.P.A vs. Kainetia vs. Viscera vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Mean Street Posse- This was a nice way to back up just an okay start to a wrestlemnaia. LOts of hardcore action in this including a boxed fan, a couple of paddles, a shopping cart, a fire extinguisher, some kendo sticks, some trash cans and trash can lids, a glass jar, and more than a fair share of street signs and cookie sheets. Lots of blood as well and lots of title changes. No wrestling at all but deffenitly surved it purpose. WInner and new wwe hardcore champ Hardcore HHolly. Match Rating 7.5/10.

3. TNA w/ Trish Stratus vs. Steve Blackman and Al Snow w/ Head Cheese- This match remided me of the first match it was just okay and i think it runned a little to long for a wrestlemania card. Not a whoile lot of talent in the ring but it was not to awful more of a filler. Winners TNA. Match Rating 6/10.

4. Dudley Boys vs. Hardy Boys vs. Edge and Chrisitan in a triangle ladder match for the wwe tag team titles- This was match of the night in my opioion and could have been considered a MOTY canidate. Non stop action all around. SOme sick part were jeff hardy did a swaton bomb off of a 20 foot ladder and crashed thropugh buuba ray was on a table. Lots of other table parst including one were devon jumps off a ladder and crashes through a table. ALso near the end matt hardy takes a sick fall off a ladder throguh a tbale give it up for all three teams awsome stuff. WInner and new wwe tag team champs Edge and Christian. MAtch Rating 9.5/10.

5. Terri vs. The Kat Cat Fight with Val Venis as Special Referee- This was a toital watse of time but at the same time i can see why this was put in here. This was an entertainment facxtor and it was a good way to cool the crowd down after that good match. One thing i can say is both women looked good and i will give them two points for that. Winner the kat. Match Rating 2/10.

6. The Radicalz vs. - This was another decnent tag match. at this point in the night i was sick of the tag matches so i really could not get into it being it was already the forth of the night but besides htat the match was soild.

7. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle (""Euro-Continental"" champion Two-Falls Match for the Intercontinental/European Championships- This was a great mid card match. I was hoping for a little more out of this match but it was just fine. If u are  looking for 3 mid carders you can look right here and you won't find any better three. This was a good 18 minute match and was placed well in with the card lots of fast paced action and techinal wrestling good stuff.

After that really good stuff chairs trash cans barb wire and table spots. Hrd to see foley leve. Than a soild finish between HHH and the rock lots of near falls and a huge turn at the end. Winner and still wwe champ HHH. Match Rating 9/10.

1062128,3,6305710392,"My main purpose for writing this is to stand up for the Main Event. I thought that the Rock/Show/HHH/Foley fatal four way was pretty damn good. The story behind was great. The rivalry were great. The match told many stories. And the wrestling action was good. What more can you ask for? HHH vs. Y2J and the biggest spectacle of the year for the greatest prize in wrestling? I don't think so. The Rock even laid the Smacketh Down on Stephanie for the fans. Not to mention Foley saying goodbye to HHH the hard way, the Rock's resiliance, and Vince's heel turn. Hell the was the turning put for the WWE in 2000. Also the Phenominal 5 star classic Triangle Ladder match. Every wrestler in the match put blood, sweat and tears into it. I can watch that match forever without getting bored with it.

Now there is a reason I gave this event 3 stars. Not one on one matches. Not a one. That sucks. Some good multi-wrestler matches like the Ladder Match (Hardys/Dudleys/Edge&Christian), The Hardcore Match, and Beniot/Y2J/Angle, but that about it. Every other match on the card was 2 1/2 stars or less. The opener really sucks. A wrestler that uses his women to get attention (Godfather), A guy that thinks he's still Ic Championship caliber (Dlo), A hasbeen (Bossman), and another guy (Buchanan).

The best thing about this Wrestlemania was Tori getting the tombstone and the stinkface whereupon a three hundred pound samoan in a greasy, unwashed thong sits on his opponent's face and rubs it around.  We're left to believe that Tubby farts in the no good jezebel's mouth, too.  And that's the only reason this gets 4 stars.",1137888000,,568,4.936842105263158

Also the first ever fatal four way with a McMahon family member in every corner of the participants ended in quite a controversy for the World Title...

D'lo Brown and the Godfather vs. Bull Buchannon and the Big Boss Man:

Okay match to start the show. Ice T accompanies D'Lo and the Godfather to the ring, rapping his then new song on one of his CD's. The Big Boss Man and Bull Buchannon use a lot of power moves while D'lo resorts to some big man moves as well as fast paced moves mixed in as well. The Godfather doesn't do much, but does get the crowd into the match. Bull Buchannon lands a near perfect leg drop off the top rope and gets the win. 7.5/10

13 man Hardcore Battle Royal
Crash [Champion] vs. Hardcore Holly vs. Tazz vs. Viscera vs. 3 members of the Mean Street Posse vs. Kai En Tai vs. the APA vs. The Head Bangers:

Don't expect to see a single headlock in this match. I believe everything but the kitchen sink was used by these men on each other. The weapons included: a boxed fan,  a couple of paddles, a shopping cart, a fire extinguisher, some kendo sticks, some trash cans and trash can lids, a glass jar, and more than a fair share of street signs and cookie sheets.

Crash Holly lasted about half a minute before Tazz got the pinfall, only to lose it to Viscera a few seconds later. There were more than 10 title changes in this match, and most of the changers were comical and cool to see. My favorite quote from this whole match was when one of the Mean Street Posse members wins the title with blood pouring down his face and Jerry Lawler says out loud, ""Look at Pete! He IS hardcore!"" The ending ended in controversy as it looked like Hardcore Holly won the title but Crash claimed he did. 8.5/10 A good match to watch for fun.

Al Snow and Steve Blackman vs. T&A:

Eh, it was okay. That is until Al Snow lost his mind and called out a guy dressed up in a cheese, literally!, outfit. This was back during some storyline and unfortunately I started watching the WWE in mid 2000 so I can't help explain it. On top of all that JR and The King had some commentary problems as their mikes kept dying. Just skip it. 5/10

WWE Tag Team Championships
Triangle Ladder Match
The Dudley Boyz [Champions] vs. Edge and Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz:

Ah, the deaf defying moments know only as TLC matches. This was great, best match on the disk [In my own opinion] Lots of high flying moves. Edge spears Jeff off a ladder, the Hardy Boyz both leap off ladders onto Bubba Ray Dudley, E and C double suplex Devon off two ladders, and the Dudley Boyz destroy everyone as they bring out maybe 4 or five tables.

Best moments include Bubba Ray powerbombing Matt Hardy off the spanish announce table through another table that was set up. Devon then missed a splash onto Christain and crashed through a table. And of course Jeff's famous swanton bomb off a 20 foot ladder onto Bubba Ray Dudley. Unreal. E and C win after Edge pushed Matt of a couple of ladders onto another table and grabbed the belts. 10/10

A Cat Fight
Val Venis is special guest referee
Terri vs. the Kat with the Fabulous Moolah and Mae Young at ringside:

Okay, watching this after the ladder match was pure torture. I would not have minded if it was just the Kat and Terri, but this was just too weird. It's okay for a laugh maybe once every ten years, but I advise you to skip this one. 3/10

The Radicalz vs. Too Cool and Chyna:

Ah Eddie, how I miss your great antics in the ring. This was during the Chyna/Eddie love feud. All 6 people give it their best and Chyna even takes down Dean Malenko and Perry Saturn in some hard hitting moves. Grand Master ""Sexsey"" [I don't know how to spell his last name.] and Scottie Too Hottie do a lot of dance moves that really seemed unnecessary, but hey it got the crowd riled up. The Radicalz lose after Chyna pins Eddie. 6/10

Intercontinental and European Championships
Triple Threat Two out of Three Falls Match
[First fall is for the Intercontinental title, the second is for the European title]
Kurt Angle [champion of both belts] vs. Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho:

What a great way to get back into the wrestling mood of Wrestlemania. All three men were great; submission move here, wrestling holds and switches there. Jericho even goes to the top rope and gets pushed off and lands almost on the announce table outside after Benoit pushes him off. Benoit wins the Intercontinental title after throwing angle into the ringside seats and hitting the flying headbutt onto Jericho for the pin.

The second match wasn't as long as the first, but it still was full of submission holds and great near falls. Jericho wins the European title after pinning Benoit. Kurt Angle lost both his titles without being pinned once. 9/10 [Good match]

Road Dogg and X-Pac vs. Kane and Rikishi:

Pete Rose continues to be assaulted by Kane at a Wrestlemania. Don't watch this, unless you were a fan of Rikishi's ""Backside"" 4/10

WWE Championship
No Disqualifications Fatal Four Way Elimination Match
Triple H [Champion] with Stephanie McMahon vs. The Rock with Vince McMahon vs. The Big Show with Shane McMahon vs. Mick Foley vs. Linda McMahon:

This was looong, but also very good. All four men held nothing back and a lot of weapons were used in this one. Mick Foley even had The Rock on an announce table and tried to give an elbow through it off the top rope but missed and damn near broke his rib cage after hitting the side of the table. The Rock then later gave a suplex to Triple H through another announce table and smashed it to pieces.

Big Show is the first to be eliminated, then Mick Foley after HHH pedigreed him onto a steel chair. Mick did not go quietly and hit Triple H in the face with a barbed wired 2 by 4 he pulled out earlier in the match. There were a lot of spots in the matches where weapons were used. Chairs, steel steps, announce tables were broken, and chairs were dented.

When it was down to Triple H and The Rock, Shane McMahon reappeared and attacked Vince. Vince fought back after being busted open and had to be led to the back. The Rock had the match won, but Vince came back out and turned on the Rock by hitting him with a chair for Triple H to get the win. 9.5/10 [Lots of weapon's but the screwjob ending ruined it for a perfect score, although it was exciting to watch.]

I recommend this for the Triangle Ladder Match, the Hardcore Battle Royal, the Two out of Three Falls Match, and the Main Event. This was a good Wrestlemania, maybe not THE best WM, but definitely not wasting any money if you buy it......",1137369600,6,6918,4.398590446358653
1062131,4,6305710392,"I remember watching this one live on PPV.  Watching events live is always a more enjoyable experience than watching DVDs and looking back at them.  ""WrestleMania 2000"" has some good stuff, but overall hasn't aged very well.

The Godfather & D'Lo Brown vs. The Big Bossman & Bull Buchanan
---After Godfather and D'Lo enter with an awkward musical performance from Ice-T, the Alabama boys come in and take charge.  The Godfather doesn't do a whole lot, which is disappointing.  Bossman & Buchanan execute some vicious teamwork, and D'Lo has always been a very good wrestler.  An odd choice for a PPV opener, but solid overall.

13-Man Battle Royal for the Hardcore Championship
---For 15 minutes, these guys go at it for the Hardcore title.  Once the time limit expires, whoever has the title wins the match.  I'm glad to see the 24/7 madness get put aside for tonight.  Also, the match is sometimes hilarious to watch, then suddenly a very rough battle.  However, the big problem is that it wears thin very quickly --- too many superstars & too many weapons.  Mildly amusing, but ultimately dumb and repetitive.
""5.5 out of 10""

Al Snow & Steve Blackman vs. T&A
---A strange presentation with J.R. and King having some headset issues throughout the match, plus the crowd isn't into it.  Who are we supposed to cheer for, anyway?  There's an Al Snow mascot gag that's just weird, too.  Test & Albert are very powerful wrestlers, and I always enjoyed their tag matches.  Not bad, but most didn't seem to care.
""6.0 out of 10""

Ladder Match for the Tag Team Championships
Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz (champions)
---Just when people thought the ""No Mercy 1999"" Ladder match and the ""Royal Rumble 2000"" Table match couldn't be topped, here this one comes along.  I didn't think I'd enjoy this one after over 20 Ladder & TLC Matches since April 1 of 2000.  But it actually holds up very well.  I think that's because the wrestlers aren't so desperate to top themselves.  No crazy spots from before to surpass; just 6 guys performing naturally.  Even though I still can't figure out why The Dudleyz wasted 5 minutes to set up tables, this classic is as superb as it was years ago!
""9.0 out of 10""

Cat Fight with Val Venis as Special Referee
Terri vs. The Kat
---I actually get a huge laugh out of this one.  Yeah, it's dumb and unnecessary, but it's not like anybody's taking themselves seriously here.  A guilty pleasure meant to give us a good time cooling down from the Ladder Match.
""6.0 out of 10"" (stupid yet funny)
________________________________________________

The Radicalz vs. Chyna & Too Cool
---I know Too Cool can wrestle a good tag team contest, and Chyna is as tough as they come.  Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, & Dean Malenko need no introduction.  But this is basically The Radicalz being embarrassed by the happy-dance tag team, which is a shame.  These six competitors were capable of stealing the show if they wanted too, but a lazy showcase that embarasses The Radicalz & hypes up the happy-dance tag team gimmick that annoyed the snot out of me.  By the way, The Worm is the worst finishing move EVER!
""5.5 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Two-Falls Match for the Intercontinental/European Championships
Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle (""Euro-Continental"" champion)
---First off, the DVD has three alternate commentaries for this match that everyone should listen to.  So how's the match?  I admire this match more than I love it; what's sad is the unrealized potential.  I got the feeling that what I saw was very good, but more of a sign of better things to come.  The two falls' finishes come just when a classic is being born.  Don't get me wrong, it's a very good battle between three of the best technical performers to ever grace the business.  But a quiet crowd and rushed finishes kind of hurt this one.  However, it's worth noting that this match made the WWF's ""Best of 2000"" VHS tape...not the Ladder Match!  All three men have had better matches later in their careers, but this is one of the evening's best contests.
""8.0 out of 10""
________________________________________________

Road Dogg & X-Pac vs. Rikishi & Kane
---I respect cool-downs for a main event, but this one doesn't hold up too well.  I don't expect a classic, but these four guys give us a very lazy contest.  Not terrible, but forgettable at best.  Plus, the Pete Rose thing got old after ""WM 15"".

No DQ Elimination Match for the WWF Championship
A McMahon In Every Corner
Mick Foley (w/ Linda) vs. Big Show (w/ Shane) vs. The Rock (w/ Vince) vs. Triple H (champion - w/ Stephanie)
---It was easier to keep track of the nWo roster than explaining the McMahon Family's storylines.  You won't care if you love Elimination Matches, but this was main event didn't live up to the great hype and well-documented history.  I can watch either of these 4 guys in one-on-one matches and have a good time.  But put 3 or 4 of them in the same ring at a time, you get nothing more than slugfest.  The one word to sum this up would be ""EPIC""!  The main event clocks in at a monstrous 40 minutes before all is said and done.  I'm afraid some viewers will get tired of this one, because it goes for a long time.  When it gets down to the final two superstars, it gets pretty good.  But then there are several run-ins that gave me a shock, but then just made me feel jipped and puzzled.  Sorry to say this, but not one of the better ""WrestleMania"" main events.
""6.5 out of 10""
________________________________________________

I think the PPV is a disappointment, but then watch WWF use the DVD format to show off the goods (unlike today's WWE PPV DVDs):

*  Disc 1 has the Triple Call Commentary for the Jericho/Benoit/Angle match, each very good.  Angle brags about his success, and whines about getting screwed.  Jericho is his usual sarcastic self, and just seems to have fun watching the match.  Benoit gives us some background on his overseas travels, keeping things grounded and calm.  Again, the Triple Call is an excellent bonus.  Disc 1 also has histories on a few of the matches, and a brief behind-the-scenes featurette.

*  Disc 2 was amazing for its time, and it's still pretty good.  Each of the first 15 WrestleManias gets their own 12-to-14 minute coverage.  Some of them are very well covered, while a few are quite the bore.  Keep in mind, that there are barely any interviews or non-kayfabe moments.  Also, some ""WrestleManias"" have all matches recapped, while some just focus on the main events.  I hope the WWE considers improving upon for future ""WrestleMania"" DVDs, because I'd love to see this good first-try evolve into greatness.

1. Big Bossman & Bull Buchanon vs. Godfather & D-Lo Brown

Decent match, althought I don't think it should have been the opener.  Ice-T is a very annoying in the entrance of Godfather and D-Lo.  (6.5/10)

2. Hardcore Battle Royal (Hardcore Title)

It was a 15 minute match and whoever had the title at the end was declared the champ.  Good match with a lot of blood and weapon use.  The ending gets a little screwed up.  (9.5/10)

3. Test & Albert vs. Steve Blackman & Al Snow

Al Snow and Steve Blackman were pretty funny in the match.  Other than that, there is really nothing going on.  (6/10)

4. Dudley Boys vs. Edge & Christian vs. Hardys (WWF Tag Team Title - Triangle Ladder Match)

Many people think this was a TLC match, and although it eventually turned into one, it was originally a ladder match.  Too many high spots to even comment on.  You have to see it to believe.  Best match of the PPV, one of the best of the year (right behind TLC I).  (10/10)

5. The Kat vs. Terri

Women's match.  Who cares.  They do look hot in the match though. (3/10)

6. Chyna & Too Cool vs. The Radicalz

Okay match.  Chyna actually puts on a good performance.  The Radicalz did not wrestle very well in the match.  (6/10)

7. Kurt Angle vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit (Winner of the first fall wins Intercontinental Title, Winner of the second fall gets the European Title)

Very good match, although I do not think it was as great as everyone made it out to be.  The crowd was pretty much dead for this match.  It annoys me that the first fall was for the Intercontinental Title because it seems to be more prestigous than the European Title.

8. Kane & Rikishi vs. DX

Pretty decent match.  Pete Rose gets it from Kane again.  (7.5/10)

9. Triple H vs. The Rock vs. Mick Foley vs. Big Show (WWF Title - Fatal Fourway Elimination/No DQ)

There is one McMahon in every mans corner for this match.  Man, they really are a messed up family.  Great performance by all competitors, espcecially the last two, as they are in thier together for about 30 minutes.  Good surprising, crazy ending.  (9/10)

Disc 2 contains a history of Wrestlemania from 1-15.  It chronicles about 15 minutes per Wrestlemania.

I definately recommend picking up this DVD, although it is very hard to find now and really exepensive.

This was a brilliant match, with the title changing hands a lot. Loads of weapons are used, and a few people are busted wide open. It's very entertaining and could have been higher on the card. 9/10
T & A with Trish Stratus V Al Snow & Steve Blackman
This was a pretty boring match. Al Snow's mascot Chester McCheesington was funny though, especially when they beat him up. It was really just a crowd calmer. 6/10

Dudley Boyz V Hardy Boyz V Edge & Christian
This was a show stealer and should have been higher on the card. One of the best matches I've seen. Loads of crazy moves using ladders and tables. Lots of tables broke even though it's a ladder match not a TLC match. All 6 put massive effort in, and it was all worth it, making a fantastic match. 10/10

Kane & Rikishi V X-Pac with Tori & Road Dogg
Yet another match used to calm the crowd, this time before the main event. There were way too many of these. Again it was an ok match despite what it was for, better than the other calmer/fillers. At the end Too Cool came down to dance with Rikishi which was funny, and there were some other exciting points. 7/10

Triple H V The Rock V Big Show V Mick Foley
This was a great main event to the show, with various weapons like chairs, barbed wire and the annonuce table being used. Big Show goes out first, then Rock and Foley team on Triple H. It's a good triple threat style section between the three. Foley finally goes out after 2 Pedigrees. Triple H and Rock then fought for a while, using the announce table at one point. At the end Vince screws Rock, marking the first (and only) time a heel has ever left Wrestlemania with the WWE title. This was a great match, but Rock should've won it. 9/10
Overall

Most memorable moment had Stephanie McMahon getting a Rock Bottom and People's Elbow from The Rock.

1062281,4,6305710392,"WrestleMania returns to Anaheim for the first time since 1996 where the legendary 60 Minute Iron Man Match between Bret Hart and Shawn Michaels emanated.  WM2000 was a fairly good pay-per-view but as the WWF/WWE learned from this WrestleMania that one-on-one main events, for such a prestigious pay-per-view such as WM, are still better in promoting and more beneficial for the match itself.  In my honest opinion, the Fatal Four-Way match had an interesting twist with a McMahon in each corner, but it didn't carry WM as well as it did the previous year with The Rock vs. Stone Cold Steve Austin in '99.  A rundown of the matches:
1. The Godfather & D'Lo Brown vs. Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan.  Despite Ice-T rapping and Godfather's voluptuous ho train, this match was a rather dull opener which didn't do much to fire up the crowd in Anaheim. (1/5)
2. 15 Minute Hardcore Battle Royal.  This match probably should have been limited to 10 minutes but nonetheless, a pretty entertaining match with lots of headshots and other hardcore spots. (3/5)
3. Test & Albert with Trish Stratus vs. Head Cheese (Al Snow & Steve Blackman) with Cheesy McCheeserton.  Pretty funny bathroom pre-match segment between Al Snow and Steve Blackman, but a rather tedious match anyway, with a cheesy ending. No pun intended. (2.5/5)
4. Triangle Ladder Match for the Tag Team Championship: The Dudley Boyz (Champions) vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian.  Match of the night.  Fantastic hardcore spots throughout and those Damn Dudleyz really stole the show, despite Jeff Hardy's climactic swanton bomb off the ladder to Buh Buh Ray Dudley through the table.  Jeff must be swimming through Memory Lane at home without work in the WWF/E. (5/5)
5. Terri Runnels vs. The Kat.  Amusing backstage dressing room scene between Kat and Mae Young before the Triangle Ladder Match.  Good cooling-off match, if you want to call it that, with funny moments after an excellent ladder match. (3/5)
6. Too Cool & Chyna vs. The Radicalz.  Borderline between a dud and an okay match.  Eddie Guerrero spends a lot of time taunting his ""Mamacita"" and Jerry Lawler on the mic repeating over and over about Eddie's Latino Heat. (2.5/5)
7. Triple-Threat Match for the Intercontinental & European Titles: Kurt Angle (IC & Euro Champion) vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit.  Great technical display between three of the best technical wrestlers the WWF/E has.  At the time, I believe Kurt was undefeated but he wasn't exactly defeated to be defeated twice. Solid match. (4/5)
8. Kane & Rikishi vs. Road Dogg & X-Pac.  Not a bad match, although it would have easily been a dud had the crowd been in an ineffective nonfactor.  Kane & Rikishi basically cleaned house through most of this match, highlighted by Pete Rose being humiliated by The Big Red Machine once again. (3/5)
9. Fatal Four-Way Elimination Match for the WWF Championship: Triple H (Champion) with Steph vs. The Rock with Vince vs. Big Show with Shane vs. Mick Foley with Linda.  This match had pretty sizeable hype, not as significant as the past WM main events (i.e. Austin vs. Rock, Austin vs. HBK), but WWF did a credible job at making this match a toss-up.  Anyway, the match made sufficient use off of the underlying storyline and it was pulled off nicely.  The ending breaks WrestleMania tradition as a heel, Triple H wins the main event, all thanks to Vince's screwjob of The Rock. (4.5/5)
All in all, a good pay-per-view.  It's not exactly up to par with the other WrestleManias, but as the following year had shown, WrestleMania 17 was a much better improvement, from top to bottom, which made WM2000 look like a shoddy WCW pay-per-view.",1053648000,,3669,4.819776714513557

The 2-Disc DVD has some great footage on it, the 1st Disc has some random interviews with crew and they show you how they got Wrestlemania 2000 up and running. There is also a play by play feature with Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, and Kurt Angle commentating on their match with Kevin Kelly.
Next, the 2-Disc DVD is the entire Wrestlemania History showcasing interviews with wrestlers and match clips and feuds of the big matches.
This is defenitley not a perfect PPV but the DVD definintley makes up for the average PPV. If your looking for better Wrestlemanias, I recommend these:
Wrestlemania XIV: Steve Austin vs. Shawn Michaels, The Rock vs. Ken Shamrock, Undertaker vs. Kane, Tag Team Title Dumpster Match
Wrestlemania X-7: Steve Austin vs. The Rock, Undertaker vs. Triple H, TLC Match, Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle, Hardcore Title Match, Street Fight Match
Wrestlemania X-8: Hulk Hogan vs. The Rock, Triple H vs. Chris Jericho, Steve Austin vs. Scott Hall, Ric Flair vs. Undertaker",1040688000,,1850,5.009740259740259
1062284,5,6305710392,"Best PPV ever! Every match deserves 10/10! Here's what I think of them.
1st match: Godfather and D-lo vs. Boss man and Bull Buchanan. Great moves throughout the entire match. 10/10.
2nd match: First-ever 13-man Hardcore battle Royal for the Hardcore title. Awesome! The most hardcore action you could hope to see. Best Hardcore title match to date. 25/10.
3rd match: T&A vs. Al Snow & Steve Blackman. Good action and you see a guy in a cheese suit slap his ... 10/10.
4th match: Triangle Ladder match for the Tag team titles. Dudley Boyz vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge and Christian. Best of the night! There were high risks, tables, ladders, and chairs. (oh, my). Amazing match with astounding end.  A must see at 1000/10.
5th match: Cat fight. Kat vs. Terri. Cool match with Val Venis as Referee. A few nice views of Kat and Terri. 10/10.
6th match: First-ever Two-fall Triple-threat match for European and I.C. Titles. Y2J vs. Benoit vs. Angle. One of the matches of the year. Pure WRESTLING. Angle had both titles at the beginning and ended with nothing. 10/10.
7th match: Too cool and Chyna vs. Radicalz. Chyna beat the holy ...out of that...Eddie Guerrero. Amazing moves by everybody in the match. 10/10.
8th match: Kane and Rikishi vs. x-pac and Road Dogg. Fast-paced action. Kane and Rikishi dominated. Pete Rose gets a chokeslam and a stinkface. (hahahahahahahahaha).
9th match: First-ever Fatal four-way elimination match for the WWF title: a McMahon in every corner. HHH with Stephanie vs. The Rock with Vince vs. Big Show with Shane vs. Mick Foley with Linda. Foley's last match. And what a way to leave. Big Show eliminated first with a Rock Bottom. Foley eliminated second with two pedigrees. Rock back-stabbed by Vince and eliminated last. But, Rock delivers a Rock Bottom to Stephanie and gives her the people's elbow. Nonetheless The match gets a 100/10.
The PPV gets a 100/100. BUY IT!!!! I GUARENDAMNTEE YOU WON'T BE DISAPOINTED!!!!!!!!1",1035072000,,1949,4.870481927710843
1062285,3,6305710392,"Overall, this PPV didn't stink. It was simply good, but not too good. The triangle ladder match for the WWE tag titles was pretty tight, but nothing compared to the tables, ladders, and chairs matches at Summerslam 00' and Wrestlemania X-7. Still, Edge & Christian, the Hardy Boyz, and the Dudley Boyz gave us a heck of a match. The hardcore title matchup was also pretty cool. The main event for the WWE Championship: The Rock vs. Triple H vs. Bigshow vs. Mick Foley in a fatal-four way elimination match. This wasn't a bad match but not a really great one either. The ending of the match is cheap and distasteful. Vince McMahon, who was supposedly in The Rock's corner, runs into the ring with a chair and takes out The Rock. HHH pins The Rock and wins the match following McMahon's betrayal. Afterward, angry fans fill the ring with garbage. The Rock, after being [cheated] for the millionth time, rockbottoms everybody in the ring including Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley. Big deal! This PPV was O.K. but could've been a little better. My advice: don't buy this video, rent it instead.",1034380800,,1085,4.746031746031746
1062286,4,6305710392,"Wrestlemania 2000
This 2 disk DVD features both the pay per view Wrestlemania 2000 and the History fo Wrestlemania 1-15. Wrestlemania 2000 featured the 4-way World Title match, some people liked it, others didn't thinking a traditional World singles match HAS to be the main event. I liked the match, I thought it was a great Event overall, The Ladder Tag Team Match is worth the DVD alone and is considered to be one of the best tag matches of all times, with lots of spots galore. It also features the ""Eurocontinental"" 2 fall triple threat match, for the Intercontinental and European Heavyweight belts, this was also a great match featuring Kurt Angle, Chris Benoit and Chris Jericho in a great...match. Almost all the matches on the card were good execpt the god awful Head Cheese gimmick, even the fans in attendance were in compelte silence of the [stuff]. (Also Fans at the event didn't seem to like Ice T's rapping all that much, but I'll let you judge on your taste of music) I would recommend it if you havn't seen it, the ladder match is a great ...match.
Also on the Wrestlemania 2000 disk it has some special features, like commentary from Chris Benoit, Chris Jericho and Kurt Angle on there Triple Threat match, it was ok since they kept going in and out of character (ie. Kurt says there was a consiracy for him to lose both titles, then the next minute he says they put on a great match). Also features backstage [stuff] and talks about Axxess event.
Onto Wrestlemania history disk. This disk features clips of each Wrestlemania and important matches. It's a lot better than the DVD with Wrestlemania Book. I'm not gonna review the matches since there all cliped. Only thing I don't like about WWF history videos is they being very picky and only show matches they think are good. They only show matches that involve current wreslters or wrestlers that are on decent terms with WWF, which is stupid, if there gonna make a Best of DVD, they should show Best of all, Not best of people that were good friends with Pat Patterson.
I would recommend the DVD, good DVD overall and has a lot of history in it",1034208000,,2118,4.591029023746702

al sno and steve blackman vs Test and albert(3/5)good action but could have been on heat instead.
first ever triangle ladder match edge and christan vs hardy boys vs dudley boys(6/5)Great match better then the main event itself. Especially Jeff hardys swanton bomb off of ladder onto buh-buh ray dudley.

The matches that stood out the most was  the main event which was good but  i thought foley woulda done some thing memeroble as it was his last match in the wwf. But was a good match, silly at 1 point as the mcmahons have a fight so rock and hhh just lay in the ring doing nufing for like 5mins. I like ice-t singing the entrance for  the godfather.
And the show stealer is most defanete  the triangle ladder match..this was unbelievable.high spots included a 450 splash on the ladder, jeff faling from the ladder to outside the ring ,swanton off the top of a giant ladder, the whole match was just a high spot!
What was the matter with the rest of wrestlemania 16? well the answer for that was head cheese match, chynas match against the radicals,the tag match with kane/rikishi vs xpac/road dogg, what were these matches doing in a wrestlemania?These are a raw openers or mid card matches! some even jakked metal matches!
If you want to see a true wrestlemania get 17 or 14 they were wrestlemania at its very best.
this gets 3 1/2 stars for the main event and the incredible 5star ladder match which displayed a new meaning to the word of high risk!!!!",1009324800,,1234,4.3755458515283845
1062375,3,6305710392,"The entire evenings matches were great and entertaining, the Triangle Ladder match is my personal favorite, but the main event was so bad.  The way they had HHH retain the title was simply embarrassing to the Game.  Everyone knows he could beat Rock Flat, and McMahon wasn't need to assist, HHH had it under control.  It was just horrible the way they did the main event, and Big Show was embarrassed as well being in the match for a good 7.5 minutes.  Where's tradition and respect like at WM6???
The DVD is well worth a buy even if you have the VHS version because with the history of WM, you can see how traditional was slowly thrown out the window.  Do the right thing and get the DVD.",1008028800,,689,4.3515625

THE BEST OF WRESTLEMANIA 1-15 is without a doubt the greatest wrestling disc so far this gives you highlights, matches, and storyline creations on the ""biggest spectacle in sports entertainment."" with that said i have one imperative to say:

This had to have been at least the 5 or 6 time the McMahons were at eachothers throuats yet still got back together within 4 months.

1062379,4,6305710392,"I give the actual event 3 star's, but it gets bumped up to 4 stars for the extra DVD Disk. Why? .. Read on:
Matches (out of 5 stars): 1. The Godfather & D'Lo Brown Vs. The Big Bossman & Bull Buchanan - Ice Tea does a special apperance and raps The Godfather's entrance music, does a good job too. Average tag team match but the crowd was way into it, so a great start to a Wrestlemania.  **1/2
2. Hardcore Battle Royal - 13 Men fight it out for 15min. Street Fight-type match. The competitors: Champion Crash Holly, Hardcore Holly, The Acolytes, Viseria, Tazz, The Headbangers, Kaientai, and The Mean Street Posse. The object is to pin whoever happens to be champion at the time and avoid being pinned till time's up. About 13 title changes took place here! It's a good idea that unfortunatly gets old really fast. Pete Gas is a bloody mess at the end of the match.  *1/2
3. Headcheese Vs. T&A - Gosh this [was bad]! I love Al Snow's humor but this was REALLY [poor]. Snow does a Aesai Moonsault and a little dude in a cheese suit gets beat up, but still: 1/2*
4. Dudley Boys Vs. The Hardy Boys Vs. Edge & Christian - Tag Team Triple Ladder Championship Match - Ohmygod! What a match!! I still think this is a better match than their jaw-dropping future TLC matches. The object of the match is to climb a Ladder and grab the tag team belts. Unfortunatly 4 other guys are doing anything they can to stop you. Some crazy, insane and VERY dangerous bumps are here including, but not limited too, Jeff's 450 splash onto a ladder. Matt Hardy eats lumber twice, once off a modified scaffold! A Swanton offa 15ft A-frame ladder! Etc, Etc,.. much more but you need to see it for yourself. *****
5. The Kat w/Mae Young Vs. Terri w/The Fabulous Moolah - Cat Fight - The Special referee is lady's man Val Venis - Very confusing and ... stupid match. Well I wasn't expecting Steamboat/Flair so I shouldn't be too critical. No.. it [was bad].. Terri and the Kat are hot but this whole idea falls flat as soon as 80yr old Mae Young tries to take her top off. Oh, the first woman to be thrown over the top wins the match if anyone cares.. DUD
6. Dean Malenko, Perry Saturn & Eddie Guerrero Vs. Chyna & Too-Cold (err.. Cool) - What do you get when you have 3 of the best wrestlers in the world take on 3 clowns?  Uhh, you get this match, which wasn't *that* bad I guess. Guerrero makes the match with his heel role and Too-Cool does their typical annoying stuff, if you like that. It's Interesting to see what happened to these guys 16 months later, 2 are gone, 1 talks to a mop, and poor Malenko's parking cars.. The horror..  **1/2
7. Kurt Angle Vs. Chris Jericho Vs. Chris Benoit - IC and European 2-Falls Championship - This is a 2-fall match: the winner of the 1st fall get the IC belt, the winner of the 2nd fall gets the European Belt. Kurt Angle held both belts at the time. Great match with the usual fanatasic moves by all three competitors. Jericho takes a NASTY head-first fall onto the Spanish announchers table. Great timing by all three made a great match to watch.  ****
8. Kane & Rikishi Vs. X-Pac & Road Dogg w/Tori - X-Pac stabbed his former partner Kane in the back and stole his girlfriend Tori. So now Kane wants revenge. I really couldn't get into this match. Kinda entertaining but nothing special. ""Stink faces"" galore in this match. **
9. Triple-H w/Stephanie McMahon Vs. The Rock w/Vince McMahon Vs. The Big Show w/Shane McMahon Vs. Mic Foley w/Linda McMahon - WWF Championship - This is a 4-way no DQ elimination match so when someone is pinned or gives-up, their gone and the match continues. Like in a soap opera, all 4 wrestlers have a McMahon (the family who owns the WWF) in their corner. And of course all the McMahon's are mad at one another :-) Mic Foley came out of a brief retirement to fullfill a life-long dream and headline a Wrestlemania. A critized, but in my opinion, a great great match. Foley had to have broken somethin' when he hits the announcers table. The Big Show press-slams Triple-H and The Rock! And the Rock and Triple-H battle all through the arena. A Controversial finish but one I really enjoyed. It's worth a look! ****1/2
DVD Extra's: 1st Disk - For the actual event, a 2nd audio Spanish Audio track is included as well as various match Retrospects. A real gem is that all 3 wrestlers involved in the Three Way match, Angle, Benoit and Jericho, supply commentary and their match. A really nice touch as all three do a great job and give the fans ""their"" perspective of the match.
2nd Disk - A GREAT Documentary of the first 15 Wrestlemania's! For old school WWF watchers, like me, this is a great addition. I don't know the exact running time but I think it's between 3 1/2 and 4hrs. No full matches are shown but various clips of ones with their original commentary are provided.
All in all, with the 2nd disk, a good buy!",997315200,,4868,4.386489479512735

To start off,the 13 man Hardcore Battle Royal was very unique and was great to see the  title change hands so many times. I have to admit,the Godfather+Dlo VS BossMan+Buchanan was a slight letdown,But the T&A VS Al+Blackman match was good. That legdrop by Al on Test was Amazing,And the addition of ChesterMcCheeserton was Entertaining! The Triangle ladder match was Brilliant,and outdoes The Micheals VS Razor match,if i dare say it. There were so many Breathtaking Elements in this Contest,Such as the Swanton off the Ladder,& the Buh Buh cutter. The Catfight was not too good for the only 1on1 match,But TooCool&Chyna VS The Radicalz was Good,Especially the Double Worm! The 2/3 Fall triple threat match is the best Triple Threat Match iv ever seen,seeing as though the Stakes were so high. The Kane&Rikishi VS RoadDogg&Xpac was thrilling,especially seeing the return of Pete Rose & The Famous Chicken! The Main event was the 1st of its kind at a Wrestlemania,and in my view the Best.

The actual main event was a flop, with people selling longer than they should have just so the Mcmahons could divert the action away from the wrestlers. Mick Foley and the Big show's presence in that match was clearly just for appearance's sake. Most other matches are forgettable. The one great match was the Ladder Match, but it still wasn't the Shawn Michaels-Razor Ramon Ladder Match, nor did it save Wrestlemania 2000. Go look for another PPV.

1062430,4,6305710392,"After this PPV many people said to me that it was the worst one they have ever seen.  I feel differently.  I thought that it was excellent.  The triangle ladder match was one of the most entertaining matches I can remember.  The three teams put on a wonderful spectacle.  The ladders were used in such creative ways and some of the usages really burned images in my mind.  For instance the fall of Christian and Matt off the ladder to the outside.  Also when Jeff ran on the security wall and was hit in the midsection by a ladder in mid air by Buh Buh.  The Buh Buh cutter off the ladder was incredible, as was 450 by Jeff missing Buh Buh and landing on the ladder.  When The Dudleys pulled out the Tables the crowd went wild followed by a series of events that left me in awe.  The 13 man hardcore match was also very entertaining.  My favorite part was when Bradshaw began to nail people over and over again with a cookie sheet.  The glass jar at the end was also really cool.  The 2 fall match was ok, its comical with Jericho on commentary.  To top it off was the Fatal 4 way.  Why did this get such bad reviews?  It was a great match.  I can see the fact the Mick didn't win was a dissapointment, but other than that, it was a wrestlemania worthy main event.  Mick's elbow drop off the turnbuckle was fouled up so badly, but ended up looking very painful when he bounced off the annouce table.  The shot to HHH with the 2X4 wrapped with barbed wire was cool.  Big Show was impressive in the opening of the match.  He was dominating.  The McMahon fights ouside of the ring were cool too with a really good chair shot to Vince by Shane.  The Rock and HHH one on one at the end was a great physical contest.  I was very satisfied with it, and between the matches I have reviewed, it was well worth the money.

But on April 2nd,2000 the new breed of WWF superstars steped foot into the squared circle for Wrestlemania 2000.  It was a great card except for 2 matches but other than that the card was strong and better than some of the past Wrestlemania's.  The card needed to be strong without the rattlesnake Stone Cold Steve Austin the WWF steped up and brought the fans a great show.

Jericho/Angle/Benoit was a good match...I liked the main event once Big Show was gone.....the tag matches were kind of worthless but kind of funny on the same token.
But what this boils down to is the second DVD, the extras. This is amazing. It has 15 minutes of coverage for each of the 15 prior wrestlemanias, pointing out my favorite points of each one. Great production work.  4/5.",980035200,,556,4.398058252427185

1. First-Ever Fatal Four-Way Elimination Match for the WWF Championship: A McMahon in Every Corner: Triple H (champion), with Stephanie vs. The Rock with Vince vs. Big Show with Shane vs. Mick Foley with Linda--Great match. Would have been better if Foley had won the belt and retired on top. But, since I'm a huge fan of DX, I'm glad Hunter retained (thanks to Vince).
2. First-Ever Two-Fall Triple-Threat Match for the Intercontinental and European Championships: Kurt Angle (champion) vs. Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit-Everybody has this match as a match of the year canidate. I don't really see why. I was really bored out my skull through this match.
3. Triangle Ladder Match for the Tag Team Championship: Dudley Boyz (champions) vs. Hardy Boyz vs. Edge & Christian-This is the reason you should buy this tape. It ""totally reeks of awesomeness"" as Edge and Christian win the tag titles for the first time.
4. First-Ever 13-Man Hardcore Battle Royal for the Hardcore Title!--This is another reason why you should buy the tape. The title changes hands many times. From Crash, Viscera, Tazz, Mean Street Posse, Funaki, Thrasher, and Bob Holly. It's great if you like the hardcore matches
5. Cat Fight: The Kat with Mae Young vs. Terri with The Fabulous Moolah with Special Guest Referee Val Venis--Kind of a turn-off. It really was bad.
6. Kane & Rikishi vs. X-Pac with Tori & Road Dogg--Only high point is when Pete Rose comes in.
7. T&A with Trish Stratus vs. Al Snow & Steve Blackman--Chester McCheesyton? This was OK.
8. 6-Person Tag Team Match: Too Cool & Chyna vs. Eddie Guerrero, Dean Malenko & Perry Saturn--Just plain sucked.
9. The Godfather & D'Lo Brown vs. Big Boss Man & Bull Buchanan--Worst match in Wrestlemania history.",977875200,,1876,4.775384615384615

Austin.

The under-card was all booked at the  last minute and it showed with the main event and Tabble-Ladder matches  only getting any build-up in the weeks previous. The fatal four way was  kinda strange, Big Show got eliminated in the first minute and Mick Foley  soon followed, it was soon down to HHH vs. The Rock, some how I think it  would've been better for these two to have been in the main event on their  own (apparently The Big Show has a stipulation in his contract that states  he has the right to be in the main event at this Wrestlemania - if only for  ten seconds!) so he HAD to be in it. The three hour pay-per-view finished  and then an extra hour was scheduled for interviews, in actual fact the  last hour was 30 minutes showing highlights of all the matches which was  really annoying, then a quick interview with Hardcore Holly and Mick Foley,  nothing special, with the final ten minutes going to Vince McMahon. The  McMahon interview is what I was waiting for, sitting through forty minutes  of highlights I felt was worth it at the time, I was wrong. ""I did  what I had to do!"" That's it! What!

It featured a 15 minute hardcore battle royal which left just about everyone  bloody and beaten; a very entertaining match.  Also of significance was the  3 way tables and ladders match between the Hardys, Dudleys, and  ""Canadian Mafia"" Edge and Christian.  The Hardys take so many  sick bumps this match, including Jeff's 450 splash onto a ladder, a senton  bomb through a table off a 20 foot ladder, and several other breathtaking  moments.  You will want to see this over and over.  Benoit/Jericho/Angle  live up to their good workrates and put on a technical clinic in their 2  fall match.  You should really buy this tape, don't get me wrong, but I was  not happy to see Mick Foley come back *out of retirement* only to be  eliminated rather shortly in the main event 4 way elimination match.  After  the Hell in the Cell at No Way Out, he really went out on his terms, in his  kind of match.  His presence in this match, while it adds a lot of  psychology and rare alliances into the match, it just doesn't sit well the  way he loses this one.

This WrestleMania was hyped up so much that the fans were expecting nothing short of the greatest pay-per-view of all time, which it wasn't. The tables and ladders match was simply awesome, but the rest of the card was lackluster. The fatal fourway main event was supposed to be a classic, but it just didn't deliver.
My main gripe is the quality of the tape. This [tape] ... subpar audio and visual quality. This is really surprising, since WrestleMania is the biggest event of the year, and WWF Home Video's product has really improved since it was born in late '97.

Hardcore Holly defeated Crash Holly, Tazz, The  Acolytes, Viscera, The Headbangers, Kaientai and Mean Street Posse - In a  match that saw the Hardcore title change hands at least ten times, Hardcore  Holly regained the championship named after him by taking out his cousin  Crash Holly and Tazz just as the time expired.
T & A with Trish  Stratus defeated Al Snow and Steve Blackman with Chester McCheeserton -  After losing to T & A, Al Snow and Steve Blackman took their  frustrations out on their first and last mascot.
Edge and Christian  defeated The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley Boyz - Edge and Christian climbed  the ladder of success to defeat their rivals, The Hardy Boyz and The Dudley  Boyz en route to become the new WWF Tag Team Champions.
Terri Runnels  with Fabulous Moolah defeated The Kat with Mae Young - Val Venis was the  real winner as he got a kiss from both of the women. Terri Runnels won the  match, but lost her pants!
Chyna and Too Cool defeated The Radicals -  Even though he lost the match, Eddie Guerrero was already stoking the  flames of the ""Latino Heat.""
Chris Benoit defeated Chris  Jericho to become the WWF Intercontinental Champion and Chris Jericho  defeated Chris Benoit to become the WWF European Champion - A frustrated  Kurt Angle lost both of his titles without even getting pinned!
Kane with  Paul Bearer and Rikishi Phatu defeated X-Pac and Road Dogg Jesse James with  Tori - For the third consecutive Wrestlemania, Kane took care of the Hall  of Famer, Pete Rose! The San Diego Chicken danced in celebration with Too  Cool after the win.
Triple H with Stephanie McMahon-Helmsley defeated The  Rock with Vince McMahon, Mick Foley with Linda McMahon and The Big Show  with Shane McMahon - After a quick start, The Big Show was eliminated by  The Rock. Shortly after that, Mick Foley was sent off to retirement - for  the second time!

In this match, the Bossman, Bull, D'Lo, and Godfather exhibit their  great athletic talent.  The ending was some what anti-climatic though.  Then the Hardcore Title Battle Royal with as many title changes as  possible.  There were ten!  It was a very entertaining match.  then T&A  vs. Snow&Blackman.  There was a closeup shot of the T before the match,  but Snow had his own entertainment for the crowd.  After the match, The Kat  had a suprise for the viewers that she probably didn't intend.  Next was  the possible match of the year, with tables, ladders and insane moves in a  Tirangle Ladder Match for the Tag Titles.  The Dudleys defended against the  Hardys and Edge&Christian.  Next up was a boring, unentertaining cat  fight. Terri's Titan Tron video was the best part.  Next up was a good,  technical six-person tag team match.  Too Cool teamed with Chyna against  the Radicalz.  Then the two-fall title match that for some reason, you will  want to watch more than any other match after you see it once.

The first match, Bossman+Buchanan vs Godfather + D'lo was a waste of time but the hardcore battle royale was  exciting with lots of weapons and blood.  T+A vs Head Cheeses was bad but  Trish Stratus looked great.  The Triple Tag team ladder match Dudleys vs  Hardyz vs Edge and Christian is one of the best matches I have seen, plenty  of jaw dropping stunts especially from J.Hardy, tables were also used. The  Cat fight was average with The Cat ripping off Terri's trousers and Mae  Young snogging guest referee Val Venis.  Then an average six man/woman tag  team, Too cool+Chyna vs Radicals and then an entertaining triple threat  match for IC + European Jericho vs Benoit vs Angle its true, its true. Kane  + Rikishi vs DX was fun. THen the hyped up Fatal Four way elimination Foley  vs Rock vs Big Show vs the Game.  This went on for ages and was good fun  but not as good as expected and a shocking ending to the match.  But the  best bit is after the match when the Rock Rock Bottoms the Mcmahon family  including Stephanie and he gives her the people's elbow!",955152000,3,1176,4.336405529953917

7893287,5,6305710392,"On April 2nd, 2000 the first Wrestlemania of the 2000s kicked off from Anaheim, California at the Arrowhead Pond  and it was definitely a great PPV to end 2000's Wrestlemania season

1.) The Godfather and D'Lo Brown vs Big Bossman and Bull Buchanan

The first Wrestlemania of the new millennium kicked off with a decent Tag Team match from D'Lo, Godfather, and the team of Bull Buchanan and Big Boss Man. Ice T lead D'Lo, Godfather and his Hos to the ring singing Godfather's theme Pimpin Ain't Easy (which can be found and heard on the WWF Aggression CD). Buchanan and Boss Man get the win, working over D'Lo with a nice double team move

2.) 15 Minute Hardcore Time Limit Championship Match: Tazz vs Viscera vs Joey Abs vs Pete Gas vs Rodney vs Hardcore Holly vs Funaki vs Taka Michinoku vs Headbanger Mosh vs Headbanger Thrash vs Bradshaw vs Faarooq vs Crash Holly (c)

Hardcore matches in the Attitude Era were always fun to watch and this one was no different. The stipulation was that the title could change hands as many times possible throughout 15 minutes but the winner at the end of the 15 minutes would be the new Hardcore Champion. Every weapon you can possibly think of, was used in this match. A fan, street signs, trash can lids, cookie sheets, etc. Nearing the 7 minute mark, the match goes backstage for a short bit. Both Crash and Pete Gas are bleeding badly at this point. At the end, Hardcore nails Crash with a candy jar to win the match. An exciting and enjoyable match.

____________________________________________

3.) Al Snow and Steve Blackman w/Chester McCheesyton vs T&A (Test and Albert) w/Trish Stratus

Trish's first Wrestlemania in quite an eye staring attire! Not too long after the match begins, J.R's headset dies and Jerry Lawler improvises for the time being, cracking a few jokes. Jerry Lawler is a hoot during this match! Chester tries to grab Trish during the match and Lawler refers to him as ""Chester the Molester"". Funny stuff! Anyways, Test and Albert get the win following an elbow drop off the top from Test to Blackman. After the match, Snow and Blackman turn on Chester and attack him for being a distraction during the match

____________________________________________

A funny backstage segment with The Kat nude in her locker room with Mae Young getting ready for her match. Lots of sexual references made but Jerry Lawler's comments made it even funnier. Lawler was the man back in the day!

____________________________________________

4.) WWF Tag Team Championship Triangle Ladder Match: Edge and Christian vs The Hardy Boyz vs The Dudley Boyz (c)

What can I say about this match, other than it was truly exhilarating! For the first time ever, these 3 teams, all making their in-ring Wrestlemania debuts, met each other in the ring for the Tag Team Championships. Action left and right with a lot of sick and high-flying spots. There were a couple of times where D-Von really sold some of the moves done to him. In the end, Edge and Christian came out on top as the new Tag Team Champions. All 3 teams pushed each other to the limit in this match. Lucky for us, we'd see them go at it once more later that Summer in the debut of the TLC Match and one more time at the following Wrestlemania in the same match

____________________________________________

5.) Catfight Match: Terri w/Fabulous Moolah vs The Kat w/Mae Young  (Special Guest Referee: Val Venis)

This was back before the WWF had an established Diva's Division with talented divas so this match is all for show. Another sex appeal match type of match from the divas. This match is a complete bummer. Terri wins around the 2 minute mark. After this 2 minute atrocity, Mae Young attacks Moolah and gives her a bronco buster, while Kat strips Terri down to her thong

____________________________________________

6.) The Radicalz (Eddie Guerrero, Perry Saturn, and Dean Malenko) vs Chyna and Too Cool

Now back to some wrestling. This was a nice and enjoyable tag team match. Seeing how Guerrero and Malenko were both technical wrestlers, this match was bound to deliver. Nice show of athleticism and agility shown from all competitors in the match. In the end, Chyna performs a sleeper slam on Eddie to get the win

____________________________________________

7.) 2 out of 3 Falls European & Intercontinental Championship Match: Chris Jericho vs Chris Benoit vs Kurt Angle (c)

Put 3 of the greatest technical, athletic submissionists from the Attitude Era making their Wrestlemania debut in the ring, fighting each other for 2 of the company's coveted championships and you get a top-tier match that may have stolen the show. The first fall was for the Intercontinental Championship which was won by Benoit, pinning Jericho after a diving headbutt. The second fall was for the European Championship, won by Jericho after pinning Benoit, following a Lionsault. Angle lost both titles without ever being pinned or tapping out. This match had some nice spots, but delivered nothing much else in a deep way which is something you would of loved to see from these guys. Too bad these 3 never had a rematch

____________________________________________

8.) Road Dogg and X-Pac w/Tori vs Rikishi and Kane w/Paul Bearer

In the 5th Tag Team match of the night, the odd and unlikely team of Kane and Rikishi teamed up to take on DX's Road Dogg and X-Pac. This match was as generic as they come. This match was moreso about Kane getting his revenge on X-Pac and Tori than it was fighting, which would probably explain why Paul Bearer and Kane were stalking Tori every 30 seconds or why Rikishi tried to put his big butt in Tori's face. In the end, Tori gets a Stinkface and Kane Tombstones X-Pac to put away this pointless match. Pete Rose tried to jump Kane with a baseball bat afterwards for the previous 2 Wrestlemanias but suffered a Chokeslam from Kane and a Stinkface from Rikishi. That was the final chapter of the Kane/Pete Rose Wrestlemania saga.

____________________________________________

9.) WWF Championship Fatal 4 Way Elimination Match: Mick Foley w/Linda McMahon vs Big Show w/Shane McMahon vs The Rock w/Vince McMahon vs Triple H I(c) w/Stephanie McMahon

This was a really great main event. One of my favorites and I really can't see why it's disliked by so many people. A McMahon in every corner was the tagline of the Wrestlemania and it was what this main event was all about. Mick Foley stated that he'd retire if he didn't win the WWF Championship. Really, The Rock and Mick Foley were the two favorites going into this match. Many were expecting Triple H to lose and I don't think anyone thought Big Show had a snowball's chance of winning. The action and this one was really fun to see. No DQ and you had to eliminate each opponent until there was only one left standing. All 4 men really gave a great showing but the ending shocked many fans that saw Vince McMahon turn heel and join forces with Triple H and Stephanie, costing The Rock the title at the same time. Vince pretty much screwed over everyone in the Attitude Era, didn't he? Aside from the typical McMahon this was a great main event that lived up to the hype. 2000 pretty much promised to be the year of Triple H

Overall: After a lackluster Wrestlemania the previous year to close out the 90s, WWF came back in high gear with a top-notch Wrestlemania for 2000. The only matches that were a drag were the Kat vs Terri match and Rikishi/Kane vs X-Pac/Road Dogg match. Every other match delivered on certain levels and that's all that matters",1396224000,,7594,4.813989239046887

This is the WrestleMania that kicked off the new decade and millenium of WWE. And to look back 9 years ago wwe has come along way. A lot of the action at this event just seems boring in comparison to today's wwe. But there are a few matches that keep this wm from being a sleeper.

The Godfather/D'Lo Brown vs Big Boss Man/Bull Buchanan
To kick off WM 2000 Ice-T brings in the Godfather/D'Lo Brown with an entertaining Performance. As for the match, i usually quickly get distracted since there's nothing special about it. The only pop is when The Godfather does the Ho Train thing. Boss and Bull pick up a clean win. 2/5

Hardcore Championship/Hardcore Battle Royal
This was definitely an innovative match for WWE. This match actually entertained me. Basically a 13 Man Extreme Rules Match with people like JBL, Tazz, Viscera, and others jacking each other up. This match also has one of the more controversial endings in WM History with Hardcore Holly questioningly winning the Hardcore Title. 3/5

Test/Albert vs Al Snow/Steve Blackman
This is undisputedly the worst wrestlemania match off the decade. The crowd was completely silent. Only pop for Trish Stratus. Test and Albert Win. 1/5

Tag Team Championship Triangle Ladder Match
The Hardy Boyz, Edge/Christian, The Dudley Boyz. The Three best tag teams of the decade put on one of the most entertaining performances in wm history. All 6 men put on their best, but the spot the made history was when Jeff Hardy hit the swanton bomb on the outside. Extremely innovative match with Edge and Christian winning the tag belts. 4/5

The Catfight
Another pointless match. I could only see this as a bathroom break. Dont even bother. 1/5

Too Cool/Chyna vs The Radicalz
Finally a decent tag match in the night. Pretty fun especially to see the storyline between Chyna vs Eddie Guerrero. A good match. 3/5

Two Fall Triple Threat Match
Chris Jericho, Chris Benoit, Kurt Angle. Three of the best technical wrestlers ever put on a classic with the most fast-paced match of the night. This is one of the more overlooker wrestlemania matches. Chris Benoit wins the IC Tile while Jericho gets the Euro Title both from Angle. 4/5

DX vs Rikishi/Kane
Basically just for entertainment. Pete Rose comes in and gets jacked up by rikishi and kane. 2/5

Fatal Four Way Main Event
Another WrestleMania Classic as The Big Show gets put out early so it ends up being Rock n SOck vs Triple H all three gets great spots. Then Triple H retires Mick Foley leaving it to the game and the great one. THese to took most of the match tearing the arena apart until vince turned on the rock and helped Triple H retain the title. Then The ROck came back and ended wm with destruction of the mcmahons. 5/5

Overall this must of been what wwe was like in 2000, cause it was slightly unorganized and dull for someone like me. But it is what it is. This Wm gets a 2.7/5",1247875200,,2905,4.643274853801169

7893291,3,6305710392,"After watching WrestleMaina 15, I had enough time to watch anther PPV so I watched this one.

The Godfather & D'Lo Brown vs. The Big Bossman & Bull Buchanan: I don't think one fan cheered during Ice T's performance as D Lo and Godfather walked out. A good opener but nothing really speical.

13-Man Battle Royal for the Hardcore Championship: As I said in many past reviews, they need to bring this division back. Alot of fun to watch and probably my second favorite match on the card.

Al Snow @ Steve Blackman VS T @ A: Wow. I never notice how WWE use to put so many crappy matches on the biggest show of them all. This one could have been saved for Raw. Albert was always impressive to me but I hate Test.

Ladder Match for the Tag Team Championships Edge & Christian vs. The Hardy Boyz vs. The Dudley Boyz: The greatest match on the card by millions. I actully forgot about this match. These three teams never upset a crowd when the faced off against one anther. Hardy Boys steal the show in this one. Edge and Christian always did seem to win during this high caliber matches...hmmmm

Cat Fight with Val Venis as Special Referee Terri vs. The Kat: Yawn, anther Raw match put on PPV.

The Radicalz vs. Chyna & Too Cool: I never liked Chyna as a wrestler, then again I hate women's wrestling. Its too bad Malenko and Saturn were never given much to do. Then again look at what Vince did to the invasion angle.

Chris Jericho vs. Chris Benoit vs. Kurt Angle: Three of the greatest wrestlers to ever step in a ring. There is three different audio tracks to hear with each wrestler given his take on the match. A short match that was good but could have been longer.

Road Dogg & X-Pac vs. Rikishi & Kane: Bathroom break before the main event.

No DQ Elimination Match for the WWF Championship A McMahon In Every Corner Mick Foley (w/ Linda) vs. Big Show (w/ Shane) vs. The Rock (w/ Vince) vs. Triple H (champion - w/ Stephanie): This match lasted over fifty minutes. The action was kept at a good pace so fans wouldnt get bored. I thought Big Show was eliminated way to early.  This was the dawning of the McMahon-Hemsley era so the end was near for WCW and alot of WWE fans. Triple H wins of course in the end with help from Vince and that makes me sick and reason why I stopped watching wrestling for a few years.

A decent WWE PPV but not as good as the WrestleMania's that would soon follow afterwards.",1195948800,,2407,4.314855875831485
