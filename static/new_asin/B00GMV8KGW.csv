The problem with the Coen Brothers is that in every one of their movies, they're looking through a glass half empty and never half full. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no exception. Oh yes, you'll find the usual excellent cinematography, casting, acting, direction and neat recreation of bygone eras. But what you'll never find is sympathy for your protagonist. The Coen Brothers always pride themselves on standing above the fray and looking down on their anti-heroes. In essence, what they're saying is, 'we're good at exposing the underbelly of the dark side of Americana; applaud us.'

The failed folk artist, Llewyn Davis, is prototypical of their one dimensional view of things. Are there really people like the fictional Davis (supposedly an amalgam of real life musicians including Dave Van Ronk, Phil Ochs and Ramblin' Jack Elliott)? People so clueless, so narcissistic, that they never listen to feedback from anyone else, so that they never change. It's a rare individual who is so misanthropic, like the Coens' Llewyn, that you will ever run into him, in real life. But even if there is such a character, does he really deserve to be immortalized in film? I hardly think so.

The Coen brothers had no problem in admitting that 'Inside Llewyn Davis' has little plot. More important is the fact that the story is devoid of a concrete antagonist. The only antagonist is Llewyn's internal demon-- which takes the form of myopia, cluelessness, and narcissism. The demon never emerges into Llewyn's consciousness, so that perhaps he can reflect upon where he is going wrong. Instead, we're asked to sit through a 104 minute chronicle of an unlikeable mediocrity, who pursues a wrong-headed quest for fame and fortune in the folk music world of the early 60s.

Llewyn Davis is much more caricature than a real human being. The Coen brothers go out of their way to show just how much of a loser this guy is. Are there really people like this? Consider their catalogue of Llewyn's shortcomings: He originally was part of a Simon & Garfunkel precursor type group, Tom & Jerry, but his partner committed suicide; he has no money and sleeps on acquaintances' couches; he's forced to carry some friends' cat around with him after he locks himself out of their apartment; he impregnates a woman but doesn't have to pay for the abortion, after he learns from the abortion doctor, that a previous girlfriend, never went through with the procedure; he drives all the way to Chicago, only to learn that a music manager never received his latest record in the mail and doesn't think he has any commercial potential; he heckles a woman during a folk concert and is later beaten up badly by the woman's husband, outside in a dark alley.

'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the ultimate sad sack tale. And unfortunately, sad sacks never make for good drama. What the film does have is lots of atmosphere. There are some neat cinematic scenes, notably the one involving John Goodman as a sleazy, heroin-addicted jazz musician, who is a passenger along with Llewyn, on that trip to Chicago. I also liked the attempt to recreate NYC in 1961, particularly various streets in Greenwich Village.

Rather than consulting all the positive reviews from 'professional' critics on Metacritic, you'll find some much more honest and insightful reviews in the review section of IMDb. There, at least, is a sense that Llewyn Davis is not a believable character and if by chance, such misanthropes truly exist in real life, their journeys are certainly not worth being looked at, given the lack of change or growth. If you like a straw man, Llewyn Davis is for you. The Coen brothers are experts at shooting straw men down--but such a maneuver should never bring praise and accolades; that's reserved only for the gullible!",1389916800,6,3823,4.8919753086419755
6089756,3,B00GMV8KGW,"If you're looking for an example of a powerful performance that will launch an actor into stardom  or at least get him some substantial roles going forward, search no further than Oscar Isaacs distinguished portrayal in the 1960s period comedy-drama, Inside Llewyn Davis.

Directed by Joel and Ethan Coen (Fargo, No County for Old Men), Inside Llewyn Davis stars Oscar Isaac as struggling folk singer, Llewyn Davis.  Its the winter of 1961 and the film begins with a melancholy musical solo by Davis in a somewhat famous New York coffee house, called the Gaslight Caf.  Shortly after the conclusion of the performance, Llewyn receives word from the clubs owner, Pappi (Max Casella), that theres a man in the alley waiting to speak with him.  The mysterious man, unrecognizable to Llewyn, proceeds to physically assault him  and thus sets the stage for Llewyns current down-but-not-out state of living.

The next scene shifts to morning time where Llewyn awaken in a friends apartment.  He leaves and heads out to see his other friend, Jim (Justin Timberlake).  Unfortunately, Jim isn't home  but his girlfriend, Jean (Carey Mulligan), is, and she wastes little time informing Llewyn that shes pregnant (presumably with his child).  Clearly angered, Jean eventually tells Llewyn that she has no intention of keeping the baby  since theres a chance it could be his.  Planning to have an abortion, she tells Llewyn its his responsibility that its his responsibility to come up with the money  even though hes broke.

Once again, the news about Jeans pregnancy continues with the general theme of Llewyns life.  At one point, he was well on his way with his music  making a successful hit, If I Had Wings, with his musical partner, Mike.  However, Mike is no longer around and Llewyn is hard-pressed to sell himself as a solo act, especially since he only plays folk music.  He takes gigs from time to time, at least when Jim is able to help him, but he makes mistakes, like signing a contract for a one time cash deal and waives potential royalties (if the song becomes a hit).

Many people clearly love Llewyn, while other find him to be a massive disappointment to others  yet he is accused of holding himself back from hitting it big.  Tired of criticism, he sets out for Chicago, sharing a car with a jazz musician, Roland Turner (John Goodman) and the driver/poet, Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund).  Once in Chicago, his mission is to play for an influential club owner, Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham).  And, what this man says to Llewyn might just dictate the future of his musical career.

Theres a lot to love and a lot to hate about this particular picture.  For starters, Oscar Issac gives a tremendous performance as Llewyn Davis.  He not only nails the role, but he also does all of his own singing  and let me tell you, his voice alone is worth the price of admission.  Sadly, his character has very little to look forward to, constantly struggling to find his way in the world.  Not only does he have struggles with his new solo career, but he also struggles to find a place to sleep each and every night.  Without a doubt, hes doing his best to face down depression.

Even despite the constant dejected tone (which never dissipates), Isaac has plenty of memorable scenes, the best and most memorable of which include John Goodman, plus the performances of Justin Timberlake.  Now, all of the Justin fans out there should be warned that hes only in this film for a handful of scenes, so if thats your selling point, you might want to rethink your decision to sit through the film.  Still, the song that has received the most attention is the performance of Please Mr. Kennedy.  Does this song ever sound way, way outdated and almost laughable  at first, but just give it a few moments to let it fully sink in.  As the song progresses, it really does become an eye-opener, fitting into the story perfectly.  In fact, I wonder how many takes it took for them to get it right

The major downside of the film is the fore-mentioned state of constant melancholy.  Most will assume that a plot that constantly hammers away at Llewyns character is all leading up to his big break  translating into a moving, uplifting moment that would likely take place in the climax.  However, thats not the type of story this is, nor is it traditional by any other means.  Certainly, this film is fresh, dramatic, and commendable  but like many of the Coen brothers pictures, this one progresses with a real-life mentality.  To that end, failure is a major possibility, which leaves viewers stuck with an ending that will not only leave a bad taste, but also largely disappoint.

Overall, Inside Llewyn Davis (named after the characters solo album) is a fresh, yet ultimately random film.  It follows a character thats struggling to get by, never pulling its life blows along the way.  There are scenes full of wonderful music, brief snippets of comedy, and finally, scenes that make you wish you could just help this character find his way in the world.  For lovers of the Coen brothers, this film will likely appease your demands, although it doesnt necessarily stand out when compared to their other films, like The Big Lebowski or No Country for Old Men.  Also, on a side note  theres plenty of folk music in this flick to be sure, with some songs being better than others.

6089757,4,B00GMV8KGW,"Theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.

Ethan and Joel Coen are as good as anybody and writing and assembling quirky comedic dramas.  While this film has plenty of humor spilling from the mouths of their characters - well except for Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund) who just grunts - this has a more serious tone than most of their films.

Llewyn Davis (an excellent Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer who was just getting started as part of a duo when his partner (seen only in photos) commits suicide by jumping off the George Washington Bridge in NYC.  As a washed up jazz musician (John Goodman) who gives Llewyn a ride says, ""Why the GW Bridge?  There's no class in jumping off that bridge.""  An example of the dark humor.

If you've ever known anyone like Llewyn (I have) you can empathize yet, he's not a very likable character.  He's a good singer and writes good songs for a limited if fervent audience.  But he can't quite get over the hump.  He has some skills but not the wherewithal to win over producers or audiences.  The last scene is a punch in the gut to what might have been.

Since he rarely has any money, he has no real place to call home, so he mooches off friends, former lovers, a sister and anybody else who has a couch.  He struggles and he seemingly never gets a break.  That's pretty much the story.  And that is pretty much the problem.  There's just not much there, there.  Just snappy dialog and occasional scenes that come to life, generally when music is playing.

The film has a strong cast.  Carey Mulligan is a former lover who turns up pregnant with what may or may not be Llewyn's child.  Justin Timberlake is her current beau and good friend of both.  Adam Driver and Alex Karpovsky (both from TV's ""Girls"") have minor roles.  Llewyn Davis is certainly better than most films that come out but it has to rate as one of the Coen's lesser efforts.",1389657600,,1892,4.4678362573099415
6089758,3,B00GMV8KGW,"The one thing one can always expect from a Coen Brothers film is that it will be interesting.  And Inside Llewyn Davis does deliver in that aspect at least.  But that said, when it was all over, I was left wondering what the point was.  As a Coen Brothers fan, I think it's worth seeing.  But that said, it's not one that I think I'll ever want to see again, let alone keep in my collection.

The film is set in February of 1961 in New York City's Greenwich Village when the folk music scene was just beginning to take hold there.  Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer trying to make a name for himself but not doing very well at it.  The reasons for his lack of success are many and varied, but top of the list is the fact that his singing partner, Mike (sung by Marcus Mumford), committed suicide about a year earlier. The album that they did together - If We Had Wings - had what seems to be a modest success, but Llewyn's recent solo album - Inside Llewyn Davis - isn't selling at all and people aren't exactly lining up to offer him gigs at any of the clubs.  As a result, he has no money and is sleeping on the couches of friends and acquaintances, rotating his way through them like a migrant guest as he drifts about ever in search of work, his welcome becoming steadily thinner with each cycle.

As the film progresses, you begin to see that a lot of Llewyn's problems are self-inflicted. He doesn't think things through, frequently makes bad decisions, is not the most considerate person on the best of days and generally rubs people the wrong way, especially when he opens his mouth. This might all be overlooked if he were a major talent, but even there he seems to be lacking as it gradually becomes obvious that the only songs people seem to want to hear him sing are the ones he did with his partner Mike.  Add to all this the fact that he's increasingly bitter and resentful towards pretty much everyone in general, blames everyone but himself for his failures and yet keeps expecting people to help him out.

In fact, there are not a whole lot of likeable people in this movie.  Some of them are interesting - like John Goodman's Roland Turner, a pompous and aggressively annoying jazz musician who staggers about like a drug-addicted Orson Welles, and Garret Hedlund's Johnny Five, a muttering beat poet acting as Turner's chauffeur, who Llewyn ends up sharing a ride to Chicago with in a desperate attempt to see if he can attract the interest of impresario Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) who has a major club there. About the only characters who are in any way likeable are Llewyn's friend Jim (Justin Timberlake) at whose apartment he crashes and a guest of Jim's named Troy Nelson (Stark Sands), a painfully clean-cut and earnest young soldier trying to break into the folk music scene.  But in many ways Jim and Troy are too nice to be really believable and only seem to be there to make the unpleasant characters even more unpleasant by contrast. In truth, it says something about Inside Llewyn Davis that the only genuinely sympathetic character in the film is a cat.

In the end though my biggest problem with Inside Llewyn Davis is that when the film ends, nothing has changed.  Llewyn is still exactly the same as he was at the beginning of the film, as is everyone else, making you wonder what the point of the film was.  Why did we follow the life of this somewhat pitiable but mostly unlikeable character for a week which seems to have made no difference for better or worse in the man himself?

To be fair, Oscar Isaac (Won't Back Down, Sucker Punch) does a marvelous job of bringing out the complexity of Llewyn Davis as a character, even if the character isn't a particularly admirable or likeable one. He's already been nominated for a number of critics' awards and will likely be getting an Academy Award nomination for Best Actor for his portrayal. And Inside Llweyn Davis won the Jury Prize at Cannes last year and has also picked up a number of nominations in various categories for other awards including the Golden Globes.  So there is something there that critics at least are responding to. It just didn't work all that well for me as an individual.

Recommended for fans of the Coen Brothers, and for Oscar Isaac's performance, but not much else.",1388880000,13,4310,4.523809523809524
6089759,3,B00GMV8KGW,"Inside Llewyn Davis (a reference to the title of his only, and failed, solo album) is one of those films whose anticipation falls below the actual event. I really wanted to love it, based on my respect for the Coen Brothers and my growing up in New York Citys early folk scene. My first live concert was hearing Dave Van Ronk at the Gaslight Caf (a venue in the film) in 1964 when I was fourteen.

The Gaslight is where we first meet the fictional Llewyn, crooning a ballad in the dark, smoke-tinged interior. We soon learn that whatever talent he enjoys is more than offset by his rotten personality. The guy is a true jerk, the kind of acquaintance we all have, the one who taxes our kindness but gets away with it only because we respect his gifts. Davis lives from couch to couch (he has no home, New York is one big crash pad for him) and gig to gig, borrowing money, insulting those who befriend him, and waiting for the big break. Nothing goes right for this fellow, proof that the law of karma was in operation even back in 1961. The plot follows a week of his aimless life and ends abruptly, leaving his character in an alleyway, beaten up and deflated.

Right before, after concluding his gig at the Gaslight, Davis is followed on stage by some skinny kid from Minnesota with a brow of curly hair. Settled on his stool, he blows into his harp and starts strumming cords.  And so the Sixties really begin.

Otherwise, the soundtrack is quite sparse. There is no grand panoramic sweep of American musical heritage made iconic in O Brother, Where Art Thou.  What tunes are sung, most by the actors involved, are good enough, especially a heartfelt rendition of  500 Miles by Justin Timberlake, Carey Mulligan and Stark Sands.  Oscar Isaac has a serviceable voice that is just right for his almost-but-not-quite-character.

Visually, the tone is bleak as if all color was de-saturated in Photoshop. Even on a sunny day, New York is drab, filthy and claustrophobic. No doubt, this was intentional to match the mood of the protagonist. If so, I hope the Coens someday do a biopic on Joni Mitchell.

Knowing the directors, it is not a spoiler to state that there is no happy ending here. No producer sees Davis in concert and signs him, to a million dollar contract. The movie just ends and that is apt.  For every Bob Dylan, there were dozens like Eric Anderson, Tom Paxton and Malvina Reynolds who, although highly respected in their circles, never achieved widespread fame or fortune. Folk music, itself, morphed into folk rock, disappeared for several decades only to be resurrected back into popular view as American Roots music by the same team of the brothers Coen and T-Bone Burnett.  For this alone, they all deserve our thanks and appreciation.",1388620800,3,2757,4.640657084188912
6089760,4,B00GMV8KGW,"The Coen brothers are geniuses (genii?) who knew there was a movie star lurking out there, tragically overlooked. Their Oscar-winning music arranger T-Bone Burnett (""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"") was a sure-fire gold-plated winner. With numerous nominations and wins for this film at festivals in Europe, and the Gran Prix (Audience Award) at Cannes under their belt, it was time to bring this baby home. And what have they done with all this bounty? They consigned Garrett Hedlund to a bit part as a chain-smoking driver! I was soooo looking forward to hearing this gifted guy sing again. To me, HE is the star tragically overlooked. Aarghhh!

The story is a week in the life of a folk singer striving for a breakthrough in 1961 Greenwich Village, at a time when folk singing arguably is in decline.

The cast:
  * Oscar Isaac (""Won't Back Down"") is the Coen brothers ""discovery."" This fellow has worked third-tier roles for years. If he is just learning to sing and play guitar, why learn to do it with his eyes closed? I find it annoying!
  * Carey Mulligan (""Never Let Me Go"") is the lovely singer everyone wants (and gets!).
  * John Goodman (""Trouble With the Curve"") is a jazz musician who derides folk music while nurturing his own demons.
  * Garrett Hedlund (""Country Strong"") is totally, utterly wasted here. There must be more to this choice than I have seen. This talented singer/actor could easily have replaced any of the other singers in this cast!
  * Justin Timberlake (""Runner Runner"") is here for two songs and does them well. If only the rest of the film had such entertaining music.
  * Stark Sands (Lots of TV) impressed me with his sweet ingenuous character. A Tony-nominated performer (""Kinky Boots"" and ""Journey's End""), he has been in musicals since high school.

This R-rated drama/musical has lots of profanity, discussions about abortions, adult language and an irritating ""hero"" who is adrift. T-Bone Burnett mounts the music with his usual verve and uncanny ear, but... sigh.... I hesitate to disclose what little story there is, because anything I say would be a spoiler.

Oh well, the 60s are nicely re-imagined: the vintage cars, the S&H Green Stamps, the clothes and the furniture. See? I can find things that I like. Oh! ...and the cat, which the Coens added to plump up the story. Maybe the DVD from Amazon would include a song by Hedlund in the extras. In that case I would buy it in a heartbeat.",1387411200,,2434,4.7595238095238095
6089761,4,B00GMV8KGW,"""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (2013 release; 105 min.) brings the (fictional) story of a folk singer named Llewyn Davis as he tries to build fame in 1961 New York. As the movie opens, we see Davis perform at the famous Gaslight Caf in what appears to be just another routine performance. Soon thereafter, we learn that Davis has no money and literally couch-hops from one night to the next between friends. We get to know Davis; friends Jean and Jim, and later learn that Jean is pregnant and she is not certain who the father is although she thinks it's Llewyn, not Jim. Out of money, Davis bitterly complains to his agent that he didn't get an advance on his recently released solo record (called ""Inside Llewyn Davis"") and surely he should get some royalties? Now he is desperate and he decides to go to Chicago to meet with the legendary Bud Grossman, an influential guy in the music business. To tell you more about the film 'plot' would ruin your viewing experience, you'll just have to see for yourself how it all plays out.

Several comments: first and foremost, there has been quite a bit of speculation in the press and elsewhere whether this movie is intended as a parody or send-up by the Coen brothers of the early 1960s folk scene. I can tell you that this is not the case at all, and that this is actually a straight take on that era. Second, the movie takes some inspiration from the real-life NY folk singer from that era, Dave Van Ronk. Third, the Coen brothers have admitted in interviews that 'there is no plot in this movie, reason why we threw in the cat'. Yes, the cat owned by the Gorfeins (friends of Davis) plays a role but to the Coens' point: this movie provides a snap-shot of that era, and does not focus on plot twists or even plot resolution. It didn't bother me one bit, as I was fascinated with the impressions of that era as painted by the Coens. Fourth, this movie oozes great performances, starting with Oscar Isaac in the title role, but check out Carey Mulligan as Jean, in her best role since ""An Education"" and Justin Timberlake as her husband Jim. But make sure to watch for F. Murray Abraham in the small role of Bud Grossman. After Davis does an on-the-spot audition for Grossman, Grossman comments dryly and devastatingly to Davis ""I don't see a lot of money here"", wow! Towards the end of the movie, Davis comments to the Gaslight Caf audience ""it's never new and it never gets old, it's a folk song"", and that about sums it up.

I saw this film during a recent family visit in Belgium, and the theatre where I saw this at was reasonably well attended, which surprised me a little bit, given the heavy American tone and focus of this. I guess some people in Belgium do care about the New York folk scene from the early 60s after all. If you are a fan of that era, this movie is a must-see, but even if you are not, I would recommend it. I know I enjoyed this from start to finish. The movie is finally coming out shortly in the US, and is already rumored to ne in line for multiple award nominations, and deservedly so.

6089907,5,B00GMV8KGW,"It's gotta be one of their best--the Coen brothers. Such a great film, one of my favorites now in a list I'll never keep track of.

If you love the bros, then this is it right here. Consistent with everything else they've done done, a stand out piece I would say.

If you appreciate the 1960s in a historical, cultural, social, and whatever else aspect, this movie is a goldmine of those things. A period piece that really covers an under-covered time and place in history--specifically, the folk culture of the early '60s.

If you love folk, there is a plethora of some great songs and performances, beautiful stuff.

God, the story is so well crafted and the dialogue so stark and understated and brilliant. I'd like to write a lengthy review, but this is not the place for it. And the camera, the way the Coens guide it and the way they cut, is superb. I know there is no explanation for why their technique is so good here, but I have not the ability to comprehensively verbalize it, especially after just watching it.

I hope you take this advice if you're pondering watching the film. Watch it. I don't remember ever feeling this involved with a film before.

The Coen brothers are great filmmakers, and I hope someday all of their films, not just the obvious/famous ones, but all of them are appreciated to the extent they should be--especially this one.

If you're going to watch it on Amazon Video, go ahead. But I'd also recommend getting a DVD copy if you liked it enough after watching, for the DVD resolution will bring new light to the Coen brother's film, as it will for many good films. Specifically speaking, it will bring new light to the light, meaning the Coen brother's lighting choices made which were fascinating and original in this film--at least I assume it will; I have only seen the Amazon Video version, but I do plan on buying a DVD eventually.

Another thing: this movie is very funny. It is subtle, but if you get the references, many of them related to the time period the movie is set in, you may find yourself cracking up. This movie is a true dark comedy and very Coenesque (what else would it be?).

Warning: this movie is bleak, barren, stark, depressing, cold. But it is, in my opinion, a masterpiece, although it's always best not to be too quick to judge. And there is always light at the end of the tunnel, we can hope.

Hope you watch the movie and enjoy it.",1493424000,2,2401,4.486238532110092

The next moment he's getting battered in an alley. You'll learn the backstory.  He's so talented, but burned out and bummed out by a serious loss, the scarcity of gigs, missed opportunities, and bad luck (if that's what it is). His own flagging drive, sour personality, and poor choices contribute. In contrast to his soulful music, his empathy is de minimis. The circularity of all that mix is obvious. It's pretty clear he has a hand in these negative outcomes. He feels some responsibility for Jean (Carey Mulligan), the friend's wife he impregnated and for the tabby cat he caused to escape from one setting where he crashes, but not too much. That couple is perfectly cast: Robin Bartlett as Lillian Gorfein, Ethan Phillips as Mitch.  John Goodman is stellar as the bombastic Roland Turner. All the cast is exceptional. The singers/musicians create a knockout score.  The cinematography (Bruno Delbonnel) is wonderfully moody and atmospheric ; the transitions are smooth and smart. The writing, directing, and editing are all the fine work of  Ethan Coen and Joel Coen. This is a pretty serious sober piece with snippets of humor.  There is little of that satirical comic counterbalance present in ""A Serious Man,"" one of my all-time favorite films.

This movie has a depiction of one of the worst road trips ever (from NYC to Chicago in winter) with John Goodman's character being the last person you'd ever want to be on a road trip with.

The character of Llewyn Davis is not always likable, but still you want to see him succeed because he is talented. I enjoyed seeing this glimpse into the life of a struggling musician and a time period from before I was born.

I now believe that the brothers could entertain any theme, any point in time. As a Dylan fan, their recreation of Greenwich Village early '60s has a special resonance. All of the characters are well cast and superbly written. A special tip of the hat to Oscar Isaac in the lead role, and Carey Mulligan as a fellow folk singer and sometime girlfriend.

6090176,5,B00GMV8KGW,"I received the DVD of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" as an early holiday gift and watched it for a second time on Christmas Eve. It is an enigmatic film set largely in Greenwich Village during a single Winter week in 1961. The Coen- brothers directed film explores the early folk music movement and ends with a performance by a young newcomer, Bob Dylan, which radically changed its nature. I remember Bob Dylan's early days when I was taken with him as an adolescent and some of the early performers of the folk movement. Later in life, I developed an interest in the blues which was something of an offshoot and which experienced a revival through the folk singers. The Tom Lehrer song ""Folk Song Army"" aptly satirized much of this movement.

The film explores its title character who is central to every scene and who receives a remarkable performance from Oscar Isaac  Davis is a young, bearded shabbily dressed singer and guitarist whose performing partner has just committed suicide. The suicide is a major part of Davis' depression and difficulty.  He struggles to make it on his own through poverty, rejection, and finding places with friends and acquaintances to spend the night. He has slept with a young woman who has become pregnant and agrees to fund an abortion.  He also acquires a tabby cat who apparently belongs to a well-to-do couple who admire his music and help him out.  The cat becomes Davis' companion for much of the film.

The movie invites reflection on Davis' life.  He is self-centered with a probably unjustified regard for his talents and at the same time unambitious. He has a gift for alienating people.  At the same time, he appears to be devoted to his music to a much greater degree than other faddish or commercial musicians and their fans. He is a loner with little education and some background in the Merchant Marine which he shares with his aged, near -comatose father.

There are many bitingly satirical scenes in the film as well as many moments of sadness. The film is slowly paced with shadowy cinematography on New York streets and clubs and on a mad road trip that Davis takes to Chicago and back. The movie uses a great deal of symbolism with the cat, a shadowy, violent stranger, and above all the music. The film gets ""inside"" Llewyn Davis by its in-depth portrayal.  Some will see Davis as a  modestly talented, self-centered, and dislikable figure while others will see him as a person of artistic and personal integrity who is struggling to make his way. So to with folk music and the years of the early 1960s.  However one understands Llewyn Davis and folk music, the film makes clear that he, unlike other performers, will not become successful.

This is a thoughtful, sad, beautifully done film about a loner whose ambitions almost surely exceed his abilities. The film also takes a probing look at the ambitions themselves. It is a sad film that poignantly explores tensions in the way many Americans tried to understand themselves in the mid-late 20th Century.

""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" was not a film based on Homer's Odyssey, except in the most contorted way. Likewise, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is not about Dave Van Ronk, or even the pre-Dylan folk music scene, except as pretext. It is a film about living with grief and the loss of innocence, both as an individual and as a society. On the individual level, Llewyn Davis is dealing with multiple levels of grief - the suicide of his partner and the decline of his father, among others. His feelings and actions can only be understood in terms of these losses. Similarly, the Coen Brothers have set the film in the midst of the last wave of American innocence before the JFK assassination, Vietnam, Watergate and the rest. Like Llewyn Davis, we have had to learn to live with our losses, and find our peace at the end of our journey (another common CB theme).

6090530,3,B00GMV8KGW,It's a bleak slice of life type of picture that reminded me of Midnight Cowboy. There is no attempt to make the main characters appealing. It was a nice idea to make a film about the pre-Dylan folk scene. But there's really not all that much music. The story stops for about 6 or 7 songs. Another 3 or 4 song performances blend into the background which was unfortunate especially when a Clancy Brothers song was used toward the end. Most disappointing was that John Goodman's role only lasts about 15 minutes and he was unconscious for nearly half of that. Maybe if a really good singer like Teddy Thompson had been given the lead role the story would have worked better for me. Another misfire by the Coens.,1476748800,,709,4.503875968992248

And that orange alley cat is perhaps the best actor in the show.

I had always been curious about these folksingers who were pretty big back when i was a kid; now i guess i'm not curious about them anymore.  I remember a line from a Sixties Bob Dylan song -- ""she's a humdinger; folk singer.""  hehehe.  Anybody else sees this movie, though, maybe they can  tell me why the guy in the first couple minutes was so angry at Davis that he met him in the dark alley out back of the Gaslight and punched the bejesus out of him, just like that.  My guess is that he was pissed off at him for singing ""his"" song, or somebody's song; apparently these folkies were real possessive about like, ""Hey, man, that's MY song, that I open with.""

 I found this to be one of the finest films put out by the Coen Brothers.  It told a story that I feel should speak quite loudly to many today (whether anyone listens remains to be seen), and was beautifully illustrated.  Like every movie these guys do, the soundtrack adds a lot of character, as if every note was carefully selected for emphasis on the scenes.  Excellent film, excellent acting.

This film is a character study and look at a time/place, successful imho in both parts. Not much plot, and Davis is not presented as heroic or even a nice guy, but so much the better for an honest portrait. Not laugh-out-loud funny, no melodrama, either. Oscar Issac is the lead ( Timberlake has a brief featured role) and he's terrific. Plays and sings well, too. Very good if inconclusive film.",1473465600,,608,4.8

So if you like jerks with nice voices but no character development, this might be your movie.  I kept wondering why I should care about this guy?  He's a bad friend, bad son, bad brother, bad lover, bad animal owner.  I appreciated the way it was shot-mostly natural light--and other nice ""film"" touches...but god.

I appreciated the film's timeless depiction of the trying-to-make-it musician's precariousness, unpredictability, and randomly bizarre circumstances of his day-to-day existence in Greenwich Village over the course of a week.  It illustrates the often thankless hard work and determination of a struggling singer-songwriter trying to just survive, let alone ""make it set in the rapidly changing music scene of the early 60's.  It conveyed the commitment-phobic character flaws common to many floundering musicians, the familiar dysfunctionality between the musician and his family, and also his lack of business sense all-too common among artists even today.  One take-away is that singing for your supper is more often what you must do and not just what you want to do - depending on what day of the week it is.",1472774400,2,952,5.418918918918919

The father remained an enigma.  The character of Davis himself was a bit too explosive to be believable (at least without a better understanding of what was underlying that tendency).  Who, really, were these guys who picked him up as he headed to Chicago?  I kept wondering what details I'd missed.  And given the fantastic folk singing and playing, are we really to believe he could have been so easily dismissed by the music industry?

6091065,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Here we are, thirty plus years after the CB revolutionized what we now call ""Indie"" movies with possibly the best debut film of all time, ""Blood Simple"". Since that date independent films have grown by leaps and bounds. Many of the ""indie"" artists cite the CB as inspiration, and if they don't they are in denial. This movie looks and feels like an ""indie"" movie, very personal. Much of what CB fans may come to expect is nowhere to be found. However, anti-heroes, references to the Odyssey and great car scenes, should keep purists happy.

When I watch Llewyn Davis, I see a young, hungry musician who is not heard by many, and liked by even fewer. His passion is real, but what can a person do when no one cares about one individual's dream?

I am not a fan of folk music, but I love CB movies. Truthfully, I've always wondered why the CB are as popular as they are (I know the answer: you can't hide talent). But I know that their popularity will ebb and flow and eventually become like Donnie in the wind. Disagree? When was the last time (besides right now) you heard the name George Carlin? Uh huh. There should be an entire state devoted to George Carlin as far as I'm concerned. But I digress. I guess what I'm saying is the CB are my Folk music. Like Llewyn Davis, I will enjoy them and celebrate them well after most others have moved on, so to speak.

Now as a musician, I enjoyed this film much more then I did as a CB fan. I know what it's like to stick to your guns against all common sense. When it seems like the world is completely against you and you're still trying to connect to them. To be constantly surrounded by pathological liars, to be physically assaulted for performing, to lose the people close to you....and still chase after it.

I am a Coen Brothers fan.  This is more like Barton Fink (w/o the supernatural) than Raising Arizona.  Dark, painful but still with the subtle, macabre humor in dialog they are known for.

My biggest gripe is the lack of good music in it.  The film based on the soundtrack-honoring concert (Another Day, Another Time) is SO amazing that I hoped the movie was awash in these tunes, but really just a couple make the film.

Not surprisingly, the outcome is a pretty boring story. There is nothing specific about the story that makes up for the lack of character development to make it feel worthwhile. It isn't funny. The one scene where the dialog could be funny is very gloomy and never really gives you a vibe that you should be laughing. It isn't quite sad either. Sure it's kind of sad how Llewyn's career goes, but he really doesn't deserve to be successful. He doesn't even seem that passionate about music. He just does it because that's what he does.

The story just isn't quite fulfilling and it isn't outstanding on any levels. The plot events are never really gripping and the emotions of the characters never really strike a chord.

It's the Cohen Bros so that should clue you in as to what you're getting- NOT a Hollywood movie with a happy ending or particularly nice people! What you get is a great story told, shot and recorded in a way that shows Hollywood up for its lack of meat, and delivers simply a great film. The main character Llewyn, thinks that by sleeping on couches, and bumming off people, sleeping around he will become a great star. Not once in the film do you see him practicing his craft. Llewyn has talent, you see that when he sits in and recording a single he's not heard before for his friend. But he does not pursue it but sits and waits for it to happen. A number of Cohen events take place which push him in to situations which he cannot handle well. Well, that and a huge heap of bad luck!

There's no humor, only imagined poignancy, and a lot of singing. While there are a few excellent lines here and there, it's a lot of waiting between the pearls. They aren't that shiny as it is. Poor Carey Mulligan is reduced to a shrill, one-note character. In fact, all of actors are poorly served by this underdeveloped screenplay.

The worst part is that at one point, he runs over a cat which stumbles into the underbrush & he does not try to help it. I hate scenes with animals suffering so if you care about animals, don't watch this movie.

6091581,1,B00GMV8KGW,"I had hoped that THIS would finally be the first Coen Brothers film since ""Raising Arizona"" I would actually like.  It would be about a period of music I grew up with as a small child, the early 60's folk scene. I had to turn it off as it turned my stomach. The immediate historical errors were sloppy and disjointed. From little details like a public telephone that wouldn't exist until the end of the decade, to singers singing songs that weren't released in 1961 ( Tom Paxton's ""Last Thing On My Mind"" and PPM's reworking cover with their gorgeous harmonies and caesuras of Hedy West's country tune ""500 Miles"") I was put off.

Then there was the cat.  This schmuck lets the cat out of the apartment, lets it get away in the subway, then finally, opens the window and lets the cat escape.  Siskel and Ebert called that ""Idiot Plot"" where EVERYONE in the audience knows what the character shouldn't do, and the idiot does it anyway. Having spent hours and days painfully searching for lost cats and dogs, I had had enough.  That was the end of  ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" for me!

6091586,4,B00GMV8KGW,"....The lighting is great and subtle, the photography is great the light shades of colour are divine. We anticipate dark thoughts when we visit the Coen Brothers unknown and familiar themes that enter along a corridor that runs on a threadbare thread that connects in a world of early morning travel.

In a gentle way, this is lovely film, and subtle with its comedy - with one strange act of violence that reappears as though the film is set in rotation? But there never seems an end or a conclusion from the road of travel to the arrival of another gig.

A ginger cat accompanies the songwriter, and I guess this has a meaning in a sublime of thought of creative freedom? The strange faces we see, bearing on an expressionless thought of life black humour turns to grey -with light and pastel colours to gentle our ride..... We are watching a film that is set in a musical key of C major that cries out to hear a sour minor key of musical chords..... We are looking at the artistic adventure paralleled with the freedom of the ginger cat along with the anxiety of the Songwriter..... The viewer though, becomes mildly tired on a journey of creative and artistic adventure of anticipation.

 The film is great though, but flawed in identification: The anti film: like a rolling stone that gathers no moss. We are never allowed to forget the hallmarks of a Coen film; strange though it may seem -are we missing a third Coen brother to make the film three dimensional?",1469750400,,1467,4.566539923954372
6091587,3,B00GMV8KGW,"A somber, often morose walk through the self-imposed daily miseries of a struggling musician at the onset of the '60s folk revival. Strangely paced and often lingering, like many Coen brothers films, it's densely packed with backstory that, while only hinted, reverberates as though it had been fully explored. Llewyn carries several weights with him; a disintegrating family, several failed relationships, a constant need to seek out empty couches for the night and a personal guilt for never quite cracking the big-time. He's a cold character, quick with angry outbursts and hurtful words, but we see a hidden warmth when he wraps his arms around a guitar and steps up to the mic. The film as a whole cherishes such musical interludes, shines them like a flashlight upon each character's innermost spirit: troubled, worried, silly, it's all out in the open on the stage, no matter how guarded the individual may be away from those bright lights. The plot doesn't have a lot of direction - at the core, it's a relatively unspectacular week in the life of a nobody - and that can make it dull and plodding at times. It touches a lot of emotions, though, from laugh-out-loud funny to quietly desolate, and the quality of the music makes up for a lot of its shortcomings. A worthwhile journey, if not a spectacular one.",1469232000,2,1317,4.831858407079646

The silly adventures have some fun moments, its a nice easy watch, it is NOT purely biographical about Dave Van Zonk, just loosely based/inspired by him. All these into account, its a nice blu ray package for the price. I enjoyed it and thought the time flew.

The aspect I love about this film above all else is how when songs are played by the lead character, played by Oscar Isaacson, the song is played in its entirety. As a musician I can't thank the Cohen Brothers enough for this.

At first glance i thought it was pathetic and ordinary, but like the cohens tend towards, it is laced with depth, even more so than most of their other films.  This film, to me, feels like a warm safe place to be an individual.  I think folks could benefit from understanding the genre.  It is a comedy indeed, the main character is an unwilling hero, and like unwilling heros, he realizes his errors by the end of the film.  It is also a period piece I guess, and is about the folk movement that began in the 50s.  Beyond that, if the subtle humor and oscar issac playing a moron a-hole folk guitarist doesn't appeal to you, the film is not for you. My wife for example doesn't like the cohen movies.  I'm a 32 year old guy who is also die-hard into the craft of music, so i have a better shot at relating to the main character, but i'd watch oscar issac in anything.  I think Cohen humor fits my personality, and i think they are doing their finest work with these unwilling hero comedies like this one and a serious man.  But, at the end of the day and after my kids have worked me to death, I think a little herb and inside llewyn davis is my idea of a good way to unwind.  I am ecstatic about this movie, and i always see more subtlety with each watch.  Oh, and I think the other actors in the movie are brilliant and help make the movie what it is.

6091847,4,B00GMV8KGW,"Inside Llewyn Davis can be a slow movie at times... in fact it *is* a slow movie, the entire way through.  It's about Oscar Isaac who's an American folk singer.  He performs for audiences but can never find the kind of success he's after (the success he deserves in fact- hey he's good!)  This movie blends fiction with nonfiction.  Oscar's definitely a real singer of the early 60's New York folk scene, but his real name is Dave Van Ronk.  I guess this is loosely inspired by Dave's career and struggles but I don't know much about Dave Van Ronk to say what's real and what's not.

Anyway Oscar Isaac often comes across like he's a clueless, unmotivated lazy musician, however as the story unfolds you begin to realize he just finds himself in all kinds of unfair situations while living in his New York apartment and talking to other musicians.  The storyline often focuses on his orange cat.  Oscar cares a lot about this cat but the poor animal always finds himself running away from home, or sneaking away at the most inopportune of times (such as whenever Oscar steps outside his door with his guitar and ready to perform downtown, only for the cat to sneak out resulting in misfortune for Oscar).  Oscar just has a lot of compassionate for cats and spends his time chasing after the sneaky animal.

Another aspect is that Oscar has a pregnant ex-girlfriend, and to say she's a little bit angry at the way the relationship ended would be an understatement!  She flat out despises Oscar, often calls him a total screw up, and constantly cusses him out.  I guess it's safe to say she wasn't happy the away the relationship ended.

There's something appealing about the second half of this movie.  This is when Oscar travels to Chicago in the middle of winter in a car with a couple strangers (one of them a sleepy extra talkative and somewhat obnoxious John Goodman).  I can't explain why this part of the movie was so good.  The atmosphere is really quiet and drab, but yet it captures the feeling of loneliness, the long roads and tired days and nights that this struggling musician must've been going through.  This scene could have lasted 20 minutes longer and I've have loved it.

Anyway when Oscar performs for a grumpy record/music producer, it's immediately clear Oscar's style of folk is very different from the traditional folk dominating the scene at the time.  It's just Oscar and his guitar being original and emotionally honest, but he's constantly persuaded to join harmonies with others which is something Oscar despises because he's a loner and wants to make music his own way.  When he delivers what I thought was a really amazing and well ahead of its time performance to the record producer guy in the hopes of making a positive impression only for the guy to patronize and turn Oscar down... that must have been really hard to take.

But that's how it was back in the 60's and 70's- often times the artists coming up with something original weren't given the acknowledgement they deserved.  Based on this performance I immediately sensed Oscar's style was far ahead of its time compared to other folk singers of the 60's, and almost in the same category of uniqueness as Bob Dylan or Nick Drake.  But I'm unsure if Dave Van Ronk had a similar voice, lyric writing and guitar style or if this was all made up for the purpose of telling a story.

Overall, well Inside Llewyn Davis is a very slow moving storyline and you have to really be into the idea of watching a musician try to make it big only to end up facing struggles and disappointment along the way in order to really appreciate it, but I thought it was really enjoyable.",1441670400,,3656,4.615146831530139

Therefore, it pains me to report, with complete honesty, that this is easily the worst, most disappointing film the Bros have ever made. There is absolutely nothing throughout this entire film - from the perfectly manicured (and inaccurate) hairstyles, to the bright white teeth, to the incorrect wardrobes, to the (lack of) atmospheric nuance, to the phony dialogue, and to the music itself - that rings true to the historical period it attempts to portray. Any film set in early 1960's New York City must now measure up to Madmen, with regard to production values and historical accuracy to detail. This film fails on every level to even come close. Oscar Isaac, as an actor and musical performer, is a weak character/folksinger (compare Issac's inadequacies here, for example, to Paul Dano's uncanny channeling of a young Brian Wilson in the more recent musical biopic 'Love and Mercy'). Not only that, but the storyline itself is stunningly boring, thoroughly lacking in interest. I had such high hopes when I heard about this film and could practically not wait to see it.

Fargo, The man who wasn't there, and A Simple Plan round out the top for me.  Those are more entertaining and easy to watch films.  This movie is not for anyone with short attentions span or ADD.  There is a lot of subtlety, nuance, symbolism and hidden meanings.  Virtually ever word spoken is significant.  No wasted dialogue (good thing).  Oscar Isaac deserves mad respect..and and Oscar ( no pun intended).  I plan on buying this DVD, because it was meant to be re-watched to pick up things missed....in fact, it is like a song loop.

I'm not a fan of folk music, but the songs in this are all worth sitting through, and some really shine.
Personally, Dear Mr. Kennedy is a hoot, and a great original tune, written for the movie.

This makes me wonder whether any of their other movies are as dense. I definitely got frustrated with A Serious Man, since I know the book of Job front to back through Christian theology, but I'm too ignorant of Judaism to take it all in, and my weak attempt to read up on the long history of a people and religion only cracked open one theme/joke for me.

I can understand how Inside Llewyn Davis could be unenjoyable if the surface narrative is relied upon to move through the whole story. Also I can see how viewers with painful personal experience with mood/personality disorders could be prodded uncomfortably in wounded areas. To those who disliked this movie I saw keep digging into it. It is awfully weighty for a movie with a sense of humor, but it is also a timeless story perfectly adapted to the contemporary moment - through the prism of fad that happened a half century ago LOL.

If you are watching this movie thinking, ""I hate this guy, why is he doing all this, and who are all these implausible characters?"" my advice is to look up Homer's Odyssey and Freud's structural model in movies. The basic idea of the movie seems to me to be this: What if Odysseus were a 1960's folk singer with severe mood disorders, enduring epic adventures that are cyclical, unproductive, and invisible to everyone around him? I think maybe the Coens started with that idea and got further fleshing out a world and story than they ever have before. Either that, or like I already said, I just missed most of the details in their other movies.

O Brother Where Art Thou is also built on the framework of the Odyssey, but in that movie it's more like, ha ha ha this is how you translate to hayseed - like if Jeff Foxworthy had grown up in an erudite household and majored in classics at an ivy league school. This movie is more a soulful folk song in tone, and the ethic seems to be, let's see how far we can push the development of these ideas. OBWAT is their funniest ever IMHO, but Inside Llewyn Davis is a staggering achievement.

I'm no expert on cinema - I have no authority with which to make broad assertions about this movie's place among the best movies. I will say that I got the same feeling watching this as I did with Kubrick's 2001. I feel like this a new level of attainment in filmmaking, at least among movies I've seen. My education is in music - I'm more like the people they ridicule in this movie LOL - but in my own personal experience Inside Llewyn Davis rates as one of the top two or three pieces of art in its medium. To me it is satisfying, profound, and engaging on every level. I don't seem to tire of turning it over and over, considering every facet and the interrelatedness of all its parts. It really is a wonder.",1420416000,3,3263,4.406301824212272

6092102,2,B00GMV8KGW,"This film missed the mark for me, since the publicity promised much more than the film actually delivered. I hadn't caught it in the theaters, but I finally got the DVD. I approached the film as someone who had personal experience with the people and scenes of the ""Urban Folk Era"" in the 60's. I had worked as a singer-songwriter in the late 60's and early 70's. I was prepared for a film that looked into the essence of what drove Llewyn Davis as an individual artist within his microcosm, even as the macrocosm of the folk revival in Greenwich Village and the entire country was building all around him. I heard in interviews that I'd see a little of the Chicago scene (a room said to be The Gaslight, as it turned out), and maybe even Boston-Cambridge (where I was), and other key places -- possibly a major folk festival. I found little of the Village, let alone the other scenes.

Instead, the Coen Brothers, able as they are, gave us a small story about a dysfunctional young working class male, who happened to be a folk singer. There was very little about his music or his performances. We don't get a good look ""inside"" Llewyn Davis. We never find out what drove him to be a folk musician in the first place. As I recall of that time, discovering or writing compelling music was ""the grail"" for those in the folk music scene. Something essential to our culture was propelling people into it. For Llewyn Davis, however, the music only seemed to get him out of working as a merchant marine sailor like his dad, and it made him interesting to a number of women who took him to their beds -- one of whom he casually impregnated. That was likely accurate about life in the Village, but getting laid and getting abortions (illegal at the time) were coincidental, albeit, as with the ""Counter Culture"" to come after the ""Folk Era,"" a wide variety of mistakes and rip-offs were common enough among the players, and, as within any Bohemian subculture, morality is always a constant experiment.

Around Llewyn Davis's urban folk ""nightmare,"" there was a growing generation of self-styled folk singers, mentored by folk icons like Pete Seeger, who had not only ridden freight trains with Woody Guthrie, he had earned his degree from Harvard (and he wasn't the only university grad on the scene). Something more than freeloading off rich fans or bilking prosperous supporters or taking loans from club owners overshadowed Llewyn Davis's small life, leaving it irrelevant to most in the end. Davis, as depicted, was clueless about his path to success or significance. In those days, you had to do more than just carry a guitar to be in the folk scene at all. It wasn't about making moves on admirers, it was about taking out your guitar, stepping up to the mike, and letting something bigger than you come through you to move people. Often the performer was as surprised as the audience, when it finally happened. There were the perks afterward, but you still had to step up again and again and again to be relevant (or paid).

I had read that ""Llewyn Davis"" (Welsh roots, like mine) was an amalgamation of several performers, including Dave Van Ronk. Van Ronk may have been many things in his time, but he was at least respected as a voracious collector and interpreter of urban blues, jug band tunes, and a whole lot of other tunes. We younger players were in awe of that, if nothing else. A look at his discography will easily show why. His guitar-playing was his own amalgamation and a competent one -- very respectful of and always fitting his material. He was fiercely conscientious as a performer and knew many other performers, as well as some foundational figures of The Blues whose music that had been collected from the South over the previous three decades. Van Ronk's tenure as the ""Mayor of Bleecker Street"" suddenly trailed off when a younger singer-songwriter rival, Bob Dylan, literally changed his tune and left Van Ronk and many others irreversibly in the past, including the fictional Llewyn Davis. Dylan's ascendency and its impact might have inspired a character-driven film, but the Coens chose to follow Llewyn Davis down (to coin an Eric Von Schmidt line).

Was Davis just another variety of Coen sociopath? If so, why spend precious budget on this one? Llewyn Davis appeared to be unaware of civil rights or anti-war efforts or the Beat Generation, to say nothing of the folk music lineage that was flowing like a tidal surge into the Village. As depicted, Davis was also very casual about performing his own music, even though some of it clearly came from mining the same sources of English and Irish ballads that Joan Baez and others mined at the same time. It was the early ascendancy of the singer-songwriter, but Davis was not ascending. He appeared throughout the film as a loner and a user to no good end but mere survival. Many others who failed to ""make it"" as folk singers left the scene to find more productive paths. (Others moved to Florida or California, etc., for less stress.)

Young white urban folk singer-songwriters be could be heard singing studied laments about trains leaving stations without them, a common Delta Blues theme. So we watched Davis's personal train leave without him, in the scene where a rapidly evolving Bob Dylan took the stage as Davis was leaving the club (The Bitter End?) feeling sorry for himself. Dylan was performing his newest, soon-to-shake-the-world music, vs. earlier material he had learned from the work of Woody Guthrie, other senior folk singers, and various musicologists. As we learned later, Dylan had met, loved, and was deeply moved by Suze Rotolo, who became his musical catalyst, but there was no woman around Davis who inspired him anywhere above the waist.

How could the Coen brothers fall so short? They are, after all, celebrated authors and directors of fascinating character-driven films. Ideally, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" could have been one of those. They might have portrayed a singularly-driven white urban folk musician, possessed by a passion to achieve something of genuine worth with his music, such that it ruled his life and set all his priorities in relationships, finances/business deals, living arrangements, etc. I don't see the Coens making a film like that, but one can hope...

Instead, we see a weary Davis in Chicago during his pivotal encounter with ""folk music godfather"" Albert Grossman (whom I knew much later), having been referred to Albert by his club-owner friend (Fred Weintraub?). Albert brusquely shatters Llewyn's rainbow. He assures Llewyn that he doesn't have it. Albert has no use for him as a headliner -- no money there -- find a partner or maybe not. It is brutal feedback. This is when Albert was building up the careers of Peter, Paul, and Mary, Bob Dylan, and others. In the film, Davis had endured a hellish journey from New York to Chicago in the ice and snow, so one might infer that this shot was important to him. Yet there is no fire in Davis when he meets his possible destiny. There is no vow from Davis afterwards to fight on after, with or without the Grossman touch. As Davis returns, defeated, to New York, there can be no tragedy, because Davis had no critical mission, no holy grail to find, nothing greater than his own appetites and self-deception to fight for. He will not be a vessel or conduit for greatness. He will not make a difference. He will continue to be his own victim. If he doesn't care, why do we?

That kind of scenario no doubt occurred for various others -- perhaps the Coens knew about someone who lived it. Even in my own story, however, the music and the scene were everything, but the music business was not, and so I turned to other ways to make a living -- I'm glad for that now. A happier outcome occurred more often than what was depicted in the film, but not for this kind of character. Besides, there was the Vietnam War just heating up, and soon a single male outside a college would easily draw a ""1A"" Draft classification and be bound for Southeast Asia, far away from the Newport Folk Festival. Llewyn was likely headed that way, and not with the Merchant Marine. There were many challenges that prevented most of us from taking up a folksinger's life, attractive though that may have seemed. I'm sorry the Coen Brothers chose to tell such a small story set in the Village of that era -- a story that ended not with a bang nor a whimper (to coin Eliot), but just a sigh.

Though the film was about a character, not the ""folk scene,"" I recall so many more memorable characters from that time -- some of my favorites involving couples, like Ian and Sylvia (down from Canada) or Richard and Mimi Farina. Not all had happy endings. There is a whole book-full of them -- ""Baby Let Me Follow You Down,"" by Eric Von Schmidt, a key player in the Boston-Cambridge scene. I recall the subtly significant contribution of ""Mr. Tambourine Man,"" the young Bruce Langhorne, whose electrified, bell-like Martin guitar arpeggio's graced a number of key albums of the era, including Dylan's ""Bringing It All Back Home"" (with Albert Grossman's wife Sarah on the album cover). And what about Dylan's muse, Suze Rotolo, who is shown walking with him arm-in-arm in the West Village on the cover of ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan""? Suze Rotolo's largely untold story would seem worthy of a film, if not a Coen Brothers film (she was not flawed or wounded enough, perhaps). She was an historical-stature muse and we know the 20th Century had them -- lots of prime material for a character-driven film. Of course, none of these characters were obvious sociopaths, or the victims of sociopaths, and so they may never drive a Coen Brothers film.

Perhaps the Coens will embark on another project addressing a more compelling character in the Folk Music Era in New York and elsewhere. (Does the character have to be a sociopath?) ""Inside  Llewyn Davis"" only used the Village of the 60's as a set, not the character it deserved to be. I am glad this movie allows me a small taste of those times and those people.

1. Joel and Ethan Coen have been making movies for 30 years. This movie proves they still have the ability to come up with compelling quirky comedies full of even quirkier characters.

2. This movie shows a week in the life of a folk singer, Llewyn Davis, in 1961 New York. Its based loosely on a real folk singer named Dave Van Ronk.

3. Llewyn is a talended singer-songwriter, but his musical career has just never caught on. Hes trying to decide whether he should keep trying.

4. Llewyn has a rather miserable life. He doesnt have a place to live, he just couch surfs through the city, staying with whatever friend isn't currently mad at him.

5. As the movie unfolds, we see that his problems come from a mixture of bad luck and bad decisions. Mostly the latter.

6. While this is a comedy, its a melancholy comedy with a kind of dark heart. Its about coming to the realization that nobody cares about your dreams but you.

7. Justin Timberlake plays a small role as Llewyns friend. And Coen staple actor John Goodman deserves Best Supporting Actor of the Year with his portrayal of a cranky jazz musician.

8. Characters sing a lot of folk songs in this movie. Im not a big fan of folk songs.

6092174,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Such an interesting film, for various reasons! If you just watch it and expect a happy ending or various other cliches then you are in for some disappointments. But do not fear, as this film succeeds in telling the tale of life. This film is unique and special, and I personally would watch it again. I will analyze it from a few perspectives. Acting wise this film did great, with various people that blur together and pop up when needed. Mainly this movie focuses on one mans journey, and his name is Llewyn Davis. Llewyn is just a regular down on his luck kind of guy trying to get out into the world.

The whole idea of the film can be summed into a simple phrase: ""One man trying to succeed at what he loves doing."" The movie follows the journey of Llewyn Davis and his various travels.  In the beggingin of the film Llewyn is beaten up because he heckled a perfomer on the stage of his local club, after this he proceeds to play a song the net day. Throughout the film you see how not many people ""like"" Llewyn, and that's understandable. He's had a rough life, losing his best friend and musical partner, his dad lacking strong mental capacity, and the girl of his dreams hates his guts for getting her pregnant.

All of these things factor into why Llewyn doesn't see much to life. But after day in and day out of the same ol' thing, he decides to do something about it. After travling a rough trip to seek out a famed music producer, he is turned down. As he is lacking what he needs to be famous, a musical partner. Realizing that the one thing he needs is gone forever, Llewyn returns home. Deciding that he will never make it in the music industry he decides to go back to sea as a seaman. The shipping union he was previously left now requires he pay back is late dues, which Llewyn does not have. Left with nothing he goes back to the club he always plays at. He heckles a performer, then scene cuts to the next day where he is playing the song from the begging of the film, where afterwards he makes the same comments he did before. As he leaves the club, the audience hears/sees Bob Dylan begin to perform(he is unknown at this moment in time) Llewyn then gets beaten up in the alleyway as he did at the beginning.

This film shows that no matter what seemingly random act Llewyn committed, he always ended up back at home. No matter how he tried to escape fate, fate pulled him back. Seeing Llewyn smile in the alley at the end makes you realize he knows that, and his miserably journey was not pointless, but it indeed ended with him realizing he belonged where he always was.

Inside Llewyn Davis is perfectly compared to Oedipus Rex, in the sense that no matter what seemingly free choice the protagonist made they always were redirected back to the path they were always fated on. What a work of art this film is. Plus the music is great.",1413936000,5,2859,4.336448598130841

6092234,1,B00GMV8KGW,"Inside Llewyn Davis seems, on the surface, to be making a simple point: creating art is difficult and rarely turns out like the happy tales which adorn the lucky few who become successful and notable. Beneath this thin cover, we have utterly ghastly condemnation of human nature.
Absolutely none of the characters in the film display any noble traits whatsoever. The protagonist is a fairly good musician, who like so many in real life, can't and don't get the Big Break. From that bitter locus we have radiating out a dismal miasma of horrible people and horrible circumstances.

A cheating agent and his utterly callous secretary. A foul mouthed, perpetually angry and needlessly scathing love interest. A scolding and perpetually angry sister. A father who can't be bothered to speak. A lecherous vile club owner. Vapid, uninteresting contemporaries. Bitter and judgmental characters without punctuation or distraction.

It's an orgy of self-piteous, disappointed and disappointing schmucks. The environment is relentlessly cold, wintry and grey. It is miserable.

The protagonist's musical partner is understood to have committed suicide jumping from New York City's George Washington bridge prior to the events which transpire in the film. The parting shot in which the protagonist shouts ""au revoir"" after the taxi transporting away a shadowy, husband who, moments before, has savagely beaten the protagonist in an alley, can only be viewed as a suicide note.

The character has nothing left. His music is a failure. His family is a failure. His love life is a failure. His day job is a failure. He is utterly friendless and alone in the world. His next option seems but one.

And in a truly vile and reprehensible way, it's as if the authors of the film stand jeering just off camera urging ""jump, you loser"".

Luckily life is not, cannot EVER be, this bad. In many ways, it is deeply irresponsible to bring such a horribly discouraging and depressing work before the public. It is such a lopsided portrayal of living as to be laughably unrealistic.

I for one, have lost loved ones, been homeless for an extended period, lost lovers, jobs, hopes and dreams. There is and always will be some light and joyful counterbalance in the universe even in the darkest moments. Perhaps the Coen brothers need to go to a good church service, or minimally watch a Monty Python movie. Smile a bit.

To display such great contempt for the subject, at a certain point, simply becomes self-referentially contemptible.

""Life is a tale told by an idiot ( or ""King Midas' idiot little brother"" ), full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" That is the message this film has for you. Avoid it. Sadomasochistic, vicious intellectual smut.",1410393600,6,2728,5.017699115044247

6092236,5,B00GMV8KGW,"This is a review of the Blu-Ray version. There's only one special on it which is very good.

I like the Coen Brothers but delayed seeing this for quite some time based on the trailer. I didn't think I would care for it. I didn't. Not the first time, or the second time. But then I started to really ""see"" the movie the third time I watched it. Each time I watch it, the movie gets better. It's all about the dialogue and the music.

When one sees the road trip with John Goodman, one starts to realize this could be seen as a sequel to ""O Brother, Where Art Thou.""  The music, I think, is better than that in ""O Brother""; but unlike ""O Brother,"" there is no plot per se. It's all about the journey, not the destination.

All I can say is this: if you watch it and don't like it, watch it a second time. If you still don't like it, watch it a third time, really late at night when you have no other distractions, and watch it from the perspective of a film critic. By the third viewing, you will be hooked, and will watch it again.",1410220800,,1030,4.059113300492611

6092290,1,B00GMV8KGW,"This was an unpalatable mess of a movie. My hubby posited that perhaps one of the Coen brothers was a fledgling folk musician rejected cruelly at an impressionable age and this film was some sort of retaliation against the industry. Only somebody who detests folk music, the folk scene and musicians in general would make a film about the early folk scene this unflattering and depressing. Sometimes darkly brooding, sometimes maniacally yelling, Davis runs around for an hour and forty minutes acting like an absolute a-hole; heckling other musicians for no apparent reason, ruining the life of any animal he comes near and causing women within a 10 ft radius to scream and froth in rage at him. All the other musicians in this film were caricatures. We had them all - the silent one, the pontificating jerk-face, the screaming shrew, the ""gee-willikers"" bumpkin, the educated bohemians excusing abusive behavior because, you know, art... none of these characters are fleshed out in any interesting way. If you are looking for stereotypes, you've come to the right movie.

After sitting through the entire film, I was especially annoyed at the muddled, Groundhog Day cop-out ending. So I crafted my own final scene: The gal with the autoharp traps Davis in the alley and bashes him over the head with it. While he is hovering in and out of consciousness the cats come along and piss on his head. The end.",1408665600,4,1405,4.878661087866109

6092295,3,B00GMV8KGW,"It's as if a setting (place and time) were chosen at random and a Coen brothers story (pretty much the same misanthropic one they always tell) were inserted into it for no particular reason. So the early-sixties Greenwich Village scenery (buildings and cars, etc.) is meticulously recreated, but the scene (in the slang sense) is conspicuously missing. Yes, presumably there was, in real life back then and there, likely some rivalry and jealously among performers, but there also had to be camaraderie, a sense of common purpose, and political discussion--a movement--or the ""folk revival"" could never have happened. In the movie it's every man for himself--or, rather, one man for himself, with various flat caricatures floating in and out. Even the character of that one man is never really explored, however. In particular we never learn why he's a folk singer in the first place, what that music and that culture mean to him.

It's not altogether a bad movie--and I particularly enjoyed the music and some of the jokes--, but it's not nearly the movie I hoped to see. (I found the John Goodman character, by the way, implausible, nothing like any jazz musician I ever heard of.

6092317,4,B00GMV8KGW,"Inside Llewyn Davis - Coen brothers direct- fictionalized depiction of the bleak life of gruff folksinger Dave van Ronk (and cat) on Bleeker Street. Not fun or upbeat , but very authentic. The New York folk scene in 1961. Impoverished folkies get ripped off by record companies and play at the coffeehouse Gaslight and the Kettle of Fish, the Caf Wha?, the Bitter End, etc. They passed the hat after a night of performing their hearts out and audience tossed whatever dollars or change the audience felt like into the hat to be split by folksingers.  FYI this is where many of the most famous folk-rockers of the late sixties started, playing daily for pennies, learning to play guitar, sing, and sing harmonies and write songs.

The Byrd's Roger Mcguin, Jefferson Airplane's Jorma Kaukonen, Paul Kantner, Loving Spoonful John Sebastian, PP&M Paul Stookey, CSNY Steven Stills, David Crosby, Karen Dalton, Mamas & Papa John Phillips, Papa Denny, Mama Cass, Tom Rush, and many more all worked this NY folk scene . Bob Dylan was originally an unknown backup harmonica player for folksinger King of Bleeker Street, Fred Neil. The reason that the music of the late sixties was so great was that performers of the era spent years, half a decade, learning to play before a crowd, sing, sing harmonies and write songs and melodies before they ever cut their first album....

That Fred Neil, one of the most talented of them all, with a spectacularly deep baritone voice, wrote standards ""Everybody's Talking at Me"" and ""The Other Side of this Life"" (no, he isn't in this movie). Fred got angry and fed up with living a life like Lleywn Davis' and quit the NYC folk scene never to return. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" might as well be the Fred Neil story.

  Best actor. sometimes grim, but also Coen Brothers satire with offbeat dry humor. understated, In intentionally desaturated color.

6092427,3,B00GMV8KGW,"I've been a longtime admirer of the Coen Brothers, and they have made some of my favorite films. Still, most of them have been accessible in some way. This one was quite a hard nut to crack. INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a loose story about a down-on-his-luck singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac). To name a few problems, his former musical partner committed suicide, one of his sexual flings is pregnant and it may or may not be his, and he was recently let go from his record company. In other words, life is hard for him. To make matters worse, he isn't too sympathetic of a character either. His go-it-alone nature and tendency to speak his mind get him into hot water with a whole host of people he meets over the course of the film. And yet he keeps on going, devoted to pursuing his chosen profession. That was my way in, and what eventually helped me get into the movie. Despite what life threw at him, he never gave up. Not only that, but there were some truly soul-stirring songs peppered throughout which helped to lighten the mood, even if they did describe things like saying farewell and being hanged. I also enjoyed the color palette and general visual aesthetic of the film. It was almost like chiaroscuro with muted blues, grays and browns. Also, like most Coen Brothers films, this was a comedy, although there was more of a greater tragic/melancholy tone this time around. The closest comparison I can make is with their previous effort A SERIOUS MAN, which dealt with similar themes of a man against the world and falling victim to circumstance. However, LLEWYN DAVIS is played straighter and has a more uplifting resolution, if one can call it that. Overall, though my patience was tested at times, it was rewarded somewhat in the end. As far as technical filmmaking quality and the performers/performances involved, this some of the Coens' best work, even if it was a little dense for me at first.

The main character is totally unsympathetic, so I never really cared about him or became engaged in his struggles. The film was actually boring!

A Mighty Wind came to mind, with some of that.  I also thought that Justin Timberlake's song that he, Oscar Isaac, and Adam Driver performed, was hilarious.  I was alive during this timeframe, albeit a kid, but I do remember NYC in the early 1960s.  Nice to see that time again.

6092444,5,B00GMV8KGW,"I think the Coen brothers' most profound gift is their ability to translate any message, text, or emotion to film. To me, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is so special because of its brutal honesty of what it looks like, for most people, to pursue your artistic dream. And it's a damn shame. We see people come and go every day with the talent of Llewyn Davis, the titular character at the heart of the film, but through a very distinctly Coen combination of situation, lack of luck, and very particular misjudgments throughout the course of his life prevent him from ever reaching the reputation he may or may not have deserved (but could very well have reached it under different circumstances, which is the larger point).

Oscar Isaac completely disappears into his performance as Llewyn Davis, someone who may appear as a very average person in the streets of New York who has as many dreams and ambition as anyone else. But he's not a perfect person he doesn't have the foresight or moral flexibility it might have taken for him to have made a more comfortable living out of the passion of his life. Oscar is able to wear this character like a perfectly fit glove, but he made it fit; years from now, people will be wondering why he wasn't aptly recognized for this work in his own time. The performance itself is an intricate, if modest, masterpiece.

Another strength of the Coens' is their ability to bring out the best of their cinematographers. The camerawork from Bruno Delbonnel will, at any given moment, visually clue the audience into the place, position, and state of mind into this central character's mindset through color, focus, framing, and detail. Cinema is, first and foremost, a visual medium; and, as such, both Joel and Ethan Coen know what director of photography to trust most to convey the thousands of words they have to say with each frame.

Finally, what makes this more than a worthy look is the work of Mr. T-Bone Burnett himself.  The soundtrack of this film is easily the best in the world of music in its year and helps this film to transcend into a world of poetic irony that has little else but the decibel of its own understated 60s-era East Village earnestness to cry out with.

The Coen brothers themselves tend to seem like shy and introverted individuals. And it's only them who could have painted such a rich and painfully honest portrait with the very artistry they excel at. This is a look at art that crosses every possible medium. The Coens are asking us, ""how many geniuses have slipped through the crack? What kind of beauty has been made in any field that I've never been privileged enough to experience? Are we ever really at the ends of the spectrum of possibility of the art we so enjoy to indulge in when such brilliant voices can never quite break through?"" It's almost a message of humility that their ability to tell this man's story is the minimum they can offer back to their audiences for the good fortune they themselves have had to be able to tell such stories in the first place. And, appropriately, they've crafted a film that wasn't properly appreciated by their own successful peers in its own time. The truthful tone will turn many audiences off from its message, but INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is one of the most essential film offerings of the new millennium thus far.",1404604800,7,3320,4.649063032367973

6092468,2,B00GMV8KGW,"Intentionally or not, this film savages every element of the scene it presents to the viewer. While superficially presenting itself as a narrative of the main character and his associates in the pre-Dylan folk revival of the early 60's, the film manages to render almost every character and sitiation as superficial, crass, effete, narcissistic, or in some other way ultimately closed and repulsive. There is something of a nostalgic, sweet veneer to the film, but that is entirely the cointribution of the viewer and audience and is in no way established by the film itself. ""Inside Llweyn Davis"" is neither an accurate fictionalization of the time and place (which I know, and yes, there was a lot of crssness, elitism, and condescension to it in some ways: thus, ""A Might Wind"") nor a creative invention in its own right.

These are very believable characters who are dealing with some not so ordinary problems. What I have a problem with, is I really wanted to like the character Llewyn - he's obviously a very talented singer and songwriter, and you want the best for him. But I really, really didn't like him at the end of the movie. Ok, I started not liking him early on. That's not a flaw in a movie, for sure, but the plot never rises above seeing him fail, be a jerk about it, and fail again. I wanted him to grow.. but maybe that's the point... there are some people who never overcome their past, destined to repeat it, while others, who love and want the best for him, offer guidance that this person never sees or follows.

6092477,1,B00GMV8KGW,"It's hard to believe that the same people who created masterpieces like ""Raising Arizona,"" ""Fargo,"" ""The Big Lebowski,"" ""A Serious Man,"" and many others, were responsible for this depressing mess. The film opens with the lead character giving a mediocre performance of a marginal folk tune, then getting beaten up for no apparent reason. Unlike other Coen Brothers films, we are not immediately drawn into an interesting world, and make no connection to the protagonist. Think of the opening of ""Fargo,"" with the ominous music and the sudden appearance of what looks like a monster, the shock of the first few scenes of ""No Country for Old Men,"" or Sam Elliott's rambling, yet fascinating introduction to ""The Big Lebowski.""

The film is shot in a depressing, muted palette of blue-gray, corresponding to the lead character's depressing life. A marginally talented, annoying jerk, he misses connections with the other people in his life just as he misses opportunities to succeed in music. The ending offers no catharsis - just as the folk music scene is about to take off, Davis will no longer be part of it.

The Coen Brothers are entitled to make a few duds - I never saw the point of ""Barton Fink"" outside the irony of a blocked writer unaware of the fount of inspiration his neighbor could provide, and ""Intolerable Cruelty"" was forgettable despite a few great lines (""the Massey pre-nup has never been penetrated!""). But ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is their only film that I would have to call abysmally, unredeemably awful. The Coens proved that they have an ear for music with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"", but despite the potentially great material available from the era the film is supposed to take place in, the soundtrack is nothing special. The stupefying performance of ""The Auld Triangle"" even leaves out the final verse:

In the female prison there are seventy women
and I wish to God it was with them that I did dwell

As always, John Goodman's performance, this time as a mysterious traveler, steals the scenes he is in. The film could have been improved with a little more humor. As it is, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" can only be recommended for Coen Brothers completists or those who have committed to seeing every film ever made.",1403395200,3,2239,4.853403141361256

As a generalized statement, Llewyn lived the life of many musicians of that era continuing into the 60's folk, folk Rock scene.  He was a self serving two timing pile of irresponsibility that thought only of himself.  I'm a musician and a painter (and from that time period) and I know what it is to live ""just a little outside"" of the general populace's mainstream thinking.  ""Outside looking in.""  Weird!  And I personally know musicians like Llewyn - just like you, Rick - that lived only to please themselves and to hell with everyone else.  And I've seen the devastation that living a life like his has left in it's wake.  I'd seen the sub-human creatures that were on the receiving end of it, winding up hating humanity because of their involuntary addiction to people like Llewyn.  Inside Llewyn Davis is a stereotyped cliche that was unfortunately true.  Just look at most of the successful crossovers that played that NYC scene and read accounts of their lives.

So it is not surprising that the directors made ""Inside Llewyn Davis""  the title is inspired by ""Inside Dave van Ronk,"" a 1964 album by an American folksinger Dave van Ronk  a film about a gifted musician one step short of great success.

Though homage to the New York music scene around the year 1961, Inside Llewyn Davis is not a biographical film. The films protagonist Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) represents any struggling artist who somehow misses chances to be like Bob Dylan. He is prone to making wrong decisions. Even when recording a novelty song like Please Mr. Kennedy, a hilarious parody of Larry Vernes hit Mr. Custer, our hero makes a big mistake of taking cash without royalties.

The Coen brothers make their point clearly. And once they do, there is not much left to be told in the films (intentionally, I think) repetitious story. Llewyn Davis has nowhere to go, just like its eponymous character.

6092506,4,B00GMV8KGW,"This would be anyone else's 5-star movie.  A command performance by Oscar Isaac.  It is an interesting psychological study about a very talented but self-absorbed young folk singer in early 60s Greenwich Village, suffering from a deep identity crisis, a profound sense of loss, and a spate of plain old bad luck - although some of it self-inflicted.  Sounds like fun?  The Coens infuse this tale with their characteristic sense of humor, interesting character portrayals by a fine cast of actors, and very believable stylization - 60s NYC, the folk scene, and the hangers-on.

This gets only four stars though, because it is far from the Coen Brothers' best movie.  It is not as deep as others, not as funny as others, perhaps not as interesting as others.  It wanders and drags a bit, and Llewyn can be frustrating.  You almost want to slap him straight as you get to know him.

Perhaps his biggest flaw is his own integrity. The path to success is in reach, but the only way to achieve that success would be to compromise his artistic vision, and because he refuses to do so, he is lower than dirt. Oscar Isaac as the title character is spellbinding. Not only is he a fine actor but he is a serious musical talent, playing the guitar and crooning better than just about any folk singer ever. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, and F. Murray Abraham round out the cast of Llewyn's drearily cyclical existence. The music...oh boy, the music! Most of the film's musical numbers are performed fully live, and they are truly mesmerizing. Songs range from fun and lively to beautiful and heart-wrenching with not a rotten apple in the bunch. Not only does the film have the best soundtrack of the year, but possibly one of the best soundtracks ever. It's that good. The reason Inside Llewyn Davis doesn't have a higher rating is that its focus felt weak and the ending was not entirely satisfying.

6092568,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Inside Llewyn Davis is both about the early 60s folk movement set in Greenwich Village,loosely based upon features in the life of David Van Ronk,a folksinger who had established his music,moving from jazz/blues in New Orleans to singing folk music in the Village. But it is fiction(just like Fargo was,though prefaced by `based on a true story') and it is a well made film,which looks beautiful (based upon the LP cover of `Freewheelin' Bob Dylan') with a great attention to detail. And it is a Coen Brother's film,who have hired T Bone Burnett to produce the live music to breathe life into the live performances of their fictional folk legend. He did this previously on O Brother,Where Art Thou? with its soundtrack of blues,bluegrass and gospel songs performed by Krauss and Welch and veteran country stars. That was country music but this is urban folk with its shift from communities to its role as a carrier of internalised individual narratives. The story in ILD lives and dies by the music,where whole songs(`Hang me,Oh hang me','Fare thee Well','The Death of Queen Jane'et al) are performed ,employed as plot points and emotional markers.

The Coens have done an impressive piece of archaeology. They've also unearthed an impressive new actor,Oscar Isaac,who can also sing and play a guitar. This is an acted film with impressive performances. The plot is kick-started by him getting beaten up outside Guerde's Folk City and it comes back full circle at the end,but on a more hopeful note. There's also the use of a ginger cat,which is used as a plot device and a way of staying close to the character's humanity. The cat escapes,then he finds what he thinks is the cat,then he knocks a cat over on the way back from Chicago,then the real one comes back. This reinforces the story's circularity,sealing the insularity of the film as the Greenwich Village part drops away and we get this individual's story. Set in a bleak,wintery landscape of overcast skies and subdued colour-tones.

Isaac imbues the part with warmth,humanity and a desultory pathos. He is a Coen loser,who is not ambitious,doesn't know what he wants,is going nowhere,sleeping on various friend's sofas for the night,waiting for a break,having lost a singing partner to suicide (but refusing to join a Peter, Paul & Mary set up when it's offered him by Bud Grossman). The songs he sings are mostly all traditional,done to earn a living not done for friends. He often sings on other people's songs as he is humorously shown to on a song written by Jim(Timberlake),but gets no royalties,only a one-off paycheck. Jean(Mulligan) his ex is pregnant,she castigates him as an a**hole(which he is) but you sympathise with his plight. Jean is always screaming at him. He's homeless,penniless,only human,struggling with commercial pressures to express his art,pondering whether to give it up and go to sea.

The trip to Chicago to meet a new manager(his old one doesn't pay) is a masterstroke. Jazzman Roland Turner(John Goodman) and his silent driver sidekick accompany him. Goodman chews the scenery as a sleepy,drug-addicted, head-banger, putting a hex on his life(as if needed).There are depressing scenes in the Gaslight Caf. Strugglingto make it as a musician,against insurmountable obstacles,some of his own making. His sister throws all hisbelongings out, so he can't go back to sea. He arranges an abortion for Jean. His music combines innocence and old age,he will miss the boat as his talent is not quite good enough,he's half in love with failure. At the end, he sings his songwith the line ""fare thee well"" and then Dylan comes up and does his own ""fare thee well"" number that is a work of genius.

6092569,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Inside Llewyn Davis is not a film bursting with action or suspense.  It is not loaded with contrived Hollywood melodrama, nor glowing with optimism and inspirational moments of courage and determination.  Inside Llewyn Davis is a film that feels more true to life.  As with most Coen Brothers films, there are moments you might find dull, and there are scenes where you might ask yourself, What exactly is the point of all this?  This is the subtle touch that makes this work feel so real, but it will also serve to frustrate many viewers.

Like the best folk songs, the art and beauty of Inside Llewyn Davis comes from the details and the intimacy felt between the singer and audience.  This intimacy is established immediately with the films opening shot: an extreme close-up of our title characters face as he sings the first song.  Throughout the film, this closeness is never lost or diminished.  The screenplay and the excellent direction of the film constantly keep us close to his thoughts without ever having to resort to voice-over or clunky, expository dialogue.  Thanks to the excellent performance of Oscar Isaac, we know just enough about Llewyn Davis to understand him and care about his story, but we are never forced to like him.  Llewyn is as lost and flawed as the characters that are portrayed within his genre of music, and though we cant help but empathize with him, we don't always like how he acts.

The details of Inside Llewyn Davis craft a world that subtly supports the feeling and mood of the film.  The attention to visual detail is incredible.  The color palette of the film is very noticeable.  Awash with browns, greys, and dull blues, and lit almost entirely with stark white lighting, you can truly feel the winter closing in about you.  Reoccurring imagery makes new scenes feel familiar, as cats, narrow corridors, and subway shots remind the viewers of the repetition and redundancy of the protagonists life.

The film is a quiet one, and rightfully so, but it is not monotonous.  The most silent or uneventful scenes are immediately followed by a tiny climax.  Small revelations, moments of emotional poignancy, and somewhat startling contrast cuts break up the film in a way that is organic and compelling.  Of course, like life, the film is not without its laughs.  The Coen Brothers signature dry, witty humor is peppered throughout the dialogue, and constantly breathes life and energy into the production.

Inside Llewyn Davis is like a good folk song: the power is in the feeling that comes with it; the personal closeness felt between the viewer and the character; the minutia that builds on itself to establish beauty and depth within the relatively simple framework of the film.  Not everyone will like it, but those that do will walk out of the theater moved and still find their minds wandering back to the entirely missable moments that in fact made the film so exceptional.",1401926400,3,2925,4.843058350100604

While there are a few good jokes peppered throughout the film, the story is a mostly bleak tale of a loser musician and his bumbling misadventures. Told as a more experimental or natural piece, there is no overarching story or big struggle, simply a series of episodes in the man's life.

While some may appreciate the avant-garde novelty of the work, I think fans of the Coens will be disappointed by the simplicity of the film, as it lacks their trademark style like inventive camera work, snappy editing and zippy dialog. Their normally lush cinematography looks too washed out and muted here. But the film does have a beautiful and elegant soundtrack of contemplative folk songs.

It does not really help the experience that the protagonist is a jerk. His grating, stubborn attitude and resulting lack of sympathy certainly shows the Coens' intentions of making a more mature and non-commercial film. Their next work is supposedly an old-fashioned screwball comedy which will hopefully get them playing to their strengths again.",1401408000,,1140,5.090909090909091
6092605,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Inside Llewyn Davis. Deep script, great performances. Spoilers.

""Inside Llewyn Davis"" begins and ends with a pair of scenes so similar that for a moment at the end, we think ninety-nine percent of the movie might have been a flashback. But internal evidence makes this impossible. The life of Llewyn (Oscar Isaac, in the performance of a career) is merely a cycle.

Llewyn is a folk singer in 1961 Greenwich Village. He screws up almost everything. Almost. He lives in other people's homes. He values least the people who treat him best. His friend Jim (Justin Timberlake) lives in blissful ignorance with a woman, Jean (Carey Mulligan), who is pregnant, possibly by Llewyn. (Llewyn's relationship with Jean is a model of dysfunction; their deception of Jim is the least of what's wrong with them as a pair.) Llewyn has an alternative career in the Merchant Marine, but he does not do the minimum to keep it as a source of money when he needs it. He is jealous, and he heckles his usual nightclub's new talent, doing no one any good. He appoints himself, after several twists of fate, or, rather, twists of incompetence, to be the guardian of someone else's pet--a project in which he fully plays out for us his unfortunate personality.

But he's always on time, even early, for the gig. He always fumbles all the way to the finish line. He will do whatever he must to make that session, or that audition. His heart is in his singing career.

Llewyn's performances are earnest and tuneful, but workmanlike. He could make a living as a studio musician, or in an act with the right partner or partners. But he feels he must go it alone. He won't succeed, because he's nothing special. He does not have a heart-stopping voice like the young Joan Baez, or natural showmanship like the young Bob Dylan, who are just about to come to notice. Llewyn is a drone.

Llewyn had a partner, Mike, who killed himself. So powerful is Llewyn's talent for screwing up that it really wouldn't surprise us to learn that Llewyn managed to bungle Mike into it, possibly by impregnating Mike's woman. Jean certainly blames Llewyn for Mike's death. After savagely insulting Llewyn, she explains by saying, ""I miss Mike."" And Llewyn can't bear now to sing duets; his conscience bothers him.

The movie has wonderful performances by John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund as Roland and Johnny, a pair of strangers who meet Llewyn when they pick him up in a mutual friend's car for a ride to an audition in Chicago. Roland is narrow-minded, pompous, and belligerent to a puzzling degree, a probable taste of what the inflexible Llewyn will become, especially if he ever feels anything like the crippled Roland's physical pain. Roland rants a lot, sleeps a lot, and has a habit of staring with glazed eyes at the ceiling and stopping at restrooms, where he stays for a mysteriously long time. He calls the homosexual Johnny his valet, which at first seems to be a joke. But Johnny attends to Roland as efficiently as Mervyn Bunter ever attended to Lord Peter Wimsey, with an apparent sense of commitment. Roland proves to be a heroin addict, which explains a good deal, and he is probably past any sexual activity; furthermore, he calls homosexuals ""queers."" But Johnny clearly plans to honor his own commitment to the end. A police officer approaches the car while an extremely hopped-up Roland is lolling in the back seat. There is no telling what might have happened had Llewyn been in the driver's seat, but Johnny picks a fight with the cop so promptly and efficiently that he gets himself taken to the police station, keeping the cop's attention off Roland. Johnny wisely takes the car keys with him, and Llewyn has to get out and hitchhike the rest of the way to Chicago, where a club owner and agent (F. Murray Abraham) bursts, or rather, temporarily dents, his bubble.

Llewyn hitches back to the east coast with another stranger, doing all the driving for the car's sleepy owner. He considers a detour into Akron to look up an old lover, the mother of his unknown two-year-old child. (The movie has several sly references to unknown or unborn children.) Llewyn feels a pull toward his child, although he mocks Jean's dreams of a conventional life. But he has a shocking experience outside Akron that reminds him of what a piece of blundering bad luck he is, and he hits the road without jinxing his old lover and their child with a visit. He then bungles his way through Manhattan, where he blunders into the final scene.

One thing I like about the Coen Brothers is the way their films all seem to be patches in the same quilt, as with Alfred Hitchcock. There are characters in this movie named Ulysses, Jean, and Grossman. (Surely we've heard of them before.) And the Coen Brothers continue to tap the ""loner-loser"" tambourine, making a statement about the pointlessness of life. The unanswered questions are tantalizing. At one point during the drive to Chicago, the usually silent Johnny complains about a successful show that could have run longer, but ""the cops closed it."" Llewyn asks why. ""Long story,"" says Johnny. No doubt. I can think of possibilities. (Was the show obscene? Did Roland OD on stage? Was Johnny turning tricks in the men's room to support Roland's habit? Nah. Too predictable, too banal. You're in Coen country. Perhaps it will make another script.)",1401321600,7,5354,4.755651237890205

6092637,3,B00GMV8KGW,"As a member in good standing of the generation of 68, and a child of the early 1960s folk minute I was all ears when I heard that the film under review, Inside Llewyn Davis written and directed by the Coen Brothers had been released (although I was not sure that the guys behind Fargo, Raising Arizona and the like would have the proper appreciation for that minute). You all know all about that folk minute or have heard about it, the time when old songs and new versions by troubadours and vagabonds located mainly in places like the Village, Harvard Square, Ann Arbor, Old Town, and North Beach threatened to put rock and roll on its ear. Of course that rock and roll in the early 1960s was stuff like Tell Laura I Love Her, Teen Angel (and about seven other angelic songs), Moon River and the like. Certainly not the Elvis of his early hungry days with things like One Night, Jerry Lee with High School Confidential, Chuck Berry with Sweet Little Sixteen, or Bo Diddley with Who Do You Love or the later Stones and Beatles explosions which would put that minute in the shade. But with the likes of Bob Dylan, venerable Pete Seeger, Joan Baez, Judy Collins, Tom Rush, Tom Paxton, Phil Ochs, the Clancy Brothers and Tommy Makem, and Dave Van Ronk there was enough talent to give it a go.

That last named singer is important, important for this film because at least superficially the mood of this piece had been said to be inspired by that old folk-singer/songwriter, historian and curmudgeon, Dave Van Ronk. Daves loving biographer, Elijah Wald says no, and from the number of times I saw him perform in person over the years in substantial concert halls and rundown coffeehouses I agree with Brother Wald. But surely the music (literally) is Daves and the mores and culture of the folk scene presented on screen seems about right (although my vantage point was from Harvard Square in Cambridge). You know the struggling folk artists up all night working their trade, bumming cigarettes, drinking wine, maybe smoking a little weed, cadging food and lodging where  they could all for, well, all for art.  And as the plot unfolds our man, Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) struts his stuff in just such a manner.

Seems though Llewyn is at wits end since losing his partner (to suicide) and is not making it very well in the Gaslight 1961 era just at the opening edge of that folk minute explosion. He is hustling for gigs, working for the basket, trying to keep body and soul together but is not making it in the Village. So on a tip he grabs a shared expenses ride to Chicago to check out the scene there. This section of the film is the best since beat poet Johnny and hipster jazz man Roland (played by John Goodman) are his traveling companions. Before they hit Chicago though Johnny has a beef with a cop and is arrested and old style be-bop hipster junkie Roland slides into a heroin overdose leaving Llewyn to travel that last stretch alone. In Chicago though it is no dice, no go, and so he heads back to New York. While he tries to hustle some work it is still no go and so he decides to go to sea, go work as a merchant marine (after he settles his union dues and papers issues). In a fit of hubris he spends his last night at the Gaslight mocking one of the performers, a performer whose husband took umbrage and beat him down in the back alley behind the Gaslight. Yeah, vagabond Llewyn, even with all his talent and dreams, is a guy fresh out of luck just then. Just like a million other guys and gals later after that folk minute flamed out. But as the film ends a new scraggly guy from the Midwest with a gravelly voice is shown in outline playing a song, Farewell, that seems to be speaking to that audience.

6092641,5,B00GMV8KGW,"There was a time when a movie released by the Coen Brothers was cause for celebration. Fans flocked to theaters to watch their movies and they could do no wrong. But for some reason their latest film gathered little attention from critics and fans alike. Which is sad because INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS actually quite a good film.

Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a folk singer on the verge of stardom. Still playing the Greenwich Village circuit for low pay with an album that's not selling at all, Llewyn goes from friend to friend, sleeping on any couch that is offered and trying to remain the creative artist that he is. We're given glimpses into a past that involved a partner but no clue where he is now.

The folk scene is still hip in 1961 New York with people still flocking to the local clubs to hear the latest music. But Llewyn is disappointed in the music he hears now. It's not the soulful music rooted deep in not just the early folk music that was there but in blues as well. The current crop of performers, including his friends Jean and Jim (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake), are talented sure but they lack that certain something he feels will prove their worth. In the meantime they're a hit with club patrons and Jim is recording a new album at Columbia.

Looking for work, Llewyn goes from place to place seeking help from his friends and colleagues. At the same time he refuses to break down and forego the life of a performer, working the day to day menial jobs like his father before him. Having once been a merchant marine, he no longer wants to return to that life. And so he moves forward in the hopes of creating music and getting that lucky break.

But as the movie slowly unrolls we get a glimpse into the real world that Llewyn live in. Jean is pregnant and unsure if the child is his or Jim's and thus wants an abortion just in case. Her resentment of Llewyn putting her into this position is tinged not with guilt so much as anger since she wants children with Jim. Llewyn's agent always collects his fee but rarely ever seems to do much for his clients. And Llewyn's sister just wants him to make something of himself. All of them push hard at Llewyn with no sympathetic ear to offer him.

Word reaches Llewyn of one of Jim's friends making a trek to Chicago to meet with Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), the owner of the biggest folk club and producer of many who have made it in the field. We move from Llewyn trying to find his way in New York to his finding a ride with a quiet driver for an eccentric named Roland Turner (John Goodman). Cajoled and insulted by Roland, Llewyn stays with the duo as long as he can. The meeting with Grossman could change everything.

There are two movies at work here in this film. The most obvious is the quest of Llewyn Davis to find vindication in his work, in his art. He wants to be loved not in the form of a paycheck but in the form of adoration while at the same time holding himself above all of that. At the same time we're given a history of folk music of that time period. The early sixties was a transitional period for folk music, moving from the classic standards of the past to a more personal and youthful sound that was moved forward by Bob Dylan. This film takes place right in the middle of that change.

More than any other Coen film, this movie relies heavily on the music found here. I watching the extras you learn that each person involved played their own music and most were recorded straight through as they performed. To think that these actors could not only act the scene but perform the music as well says much to the authenticity they bring to each character.

The story that we're made privy to here is a sad one in some ways but with a glimmer of hope shining through at the end. And yet we have no idea when it's all over just what will become of Llewyn and that's how it should be. This is no cardboard cutout look at the music world where all things happen in 90 minutes, crisis stated and solution found. This is the world of an artist who is still seeking that elusive muse that will allow him to be discovered by the world.

The Coen Brothers have done it once again. They've transported us to another place in time, a world that we might have heard of but most have never experienced. And in so doing they expose us to some well played music and some incredible actors who appear to be the characters they're portraying rather than acting. In so doing we're given a movie that entertains both visually and aurally. It's a movie that's worth watching and perhaps even adding to the collection.",1400630400,3,4604,4.375438596491228

Inside Llewyn Davis is a poetic, metaphorical insight into the bitterness, self-doubt, and infinite love for music of a struggling folk-singer in a stylized 60's beatnik New York, all with the signature dry humor of the Cohen Brothers.

WARNING: if you don't like the Cohen Brothers, you'd probably want to chose a different movie.

Throughout the film, Llewyn (played by Oscar Isaac) bears a world set against him. He subsists on hand-outs but refuses to be pitied. He hates everything about himself but only has his pride. He's a true artist, not in the sense of success or recognition, but in a sense of talent that cannot be beaten down by rejection.

Of course, the big laughs will play for those who enjoy the Cohen Brothers' understated sense of humor. Still, the high points of Inside Llewyn Davis come from the moments of genuine sentimentality. It's rare to see the Brothers embrace real emotion without spinning some snarky joke to taint the moment, but here we see deep into all of Llewyn's deepest needs, including his dark, primal sense of survival and his surprising capacity to love. All scored with a spine-chilling soundtrack of folk songs, the story unfolds non-linearly and not necessarily to a happy ending, but with a sense of heart and character not romanticized by a contrived rags-to-riches plot.

If you aren't afraid of a film that paces slowly, treats its characters as flawed human-beings, and leaves many of the themes to subtext, please watch this movie.",1400112000,4,1751,4.902027027027027

6092697,4,B00GMV8KGW,"I love the Coen Brothers. They are, for my money the best contemporary filmmakers out there. So it was an odd feeling for when last year they put out Inside Llewyn Davis, a movie that explores a singer who is part of the Greenwich Village scene of the early 60s, a music scene that produced Bob Dylan and many others, but the titular character is not the subject of a fictional rags to riches, A Star is Born treatment. Davis is part of the flotsam of that scene, the almost-could-have-beens. I couldn't bring myself to watch it. But it just came out for home viewing and yesterday I finally brought myself to view it.

Inside-Llewyn-Davis-catWhy was it so hard for me to watch it you might be wondering? Mostly because I was afraid that Id watch it and see myself in Llewyn Davis, all the possibility, all the flaws, the debilitating overconfidence and self-aggrandizing zealotry, the weakness and neediness. And I was right. As I watched the film I saw a representation of my 10 years in New York City as a hopeful songwriter and performer unfold in my mind. No one else would see it, but thats the beauty of art. You bring yourself to it. It brings you out of it, like a magician pulling a rabbit out of a hat. It was probably one of the most difficult films for me to watch, but I watched it. And I enjoyed it. And it brought me back to the place where I was the most weak andjust a little bitreminded me I could be strong. Maybe.

I read an article in the New Yorker that discussed how the trip to Chicago was really part of Daviss quest he saw in that journey the choices he would have to make to be what he wanted to be and couldn't make them. When the Grossman character listened to his (really beautiful) song and said I don't hear any money in it I was crushed. But in a good way, I guess (not really).

That whole thing rang very true to me. I seemed and artistic representation of choices we all have to make. It reminded me specifically of choices I definitely made that resulted in my eventual downfall as a musician. I could have tried to take the talents I had and mold them to something that was more commercially viable, but I wanted to write my own stuff. I could have done many things differently. I worked as hard as I possible could for about 8 or 10 years in NYC.

One thing I came to know is that at a certain point talent is a given and luck, or placement, or even looks, become what separates. It feels maddeningly arbitrary. But maybe thats just a story I tell myself to get through the night. Maybe I quit too soon. I spent more time than I wish I would have envying the success of a few others. Some of you know who they are. Maybe they envy as well. I try to be OK with it. I try not to second guess my choices, but its hard not to.

Should I have taken the record deal we were offered in 2000 even though the terms weren't the best. After I turned it down I heard that our lawyer was shocked I didn't take it. He told a friend that hed never seen an artist turn down a first deal like that, or something. And he was one of the people who advised me not to take it.

Should I have asked the 2 dudes who quit the band in 96 to stay for the SXSW gig where we had several major label folks coming with potential deals on the table instead of curling up in a ball? The Old 97s had occupied the same spot on the bill we filled that year. I don't know. I don't think I would have been able to do that at 24. Curling up in a shock-induced ball was probably the only possible reaction for me at the time. 375499_10150425602802717_42759962_n

For about 10 years I felt like things were possible. Good things continued to happen along with the not so good. People seemed to think that I was building something, that the next step would come, that I was building a resume. And then it just felt like it was over. Or maybe I was just done with it. Or did I lose my nerve? Errol was there for most of it. Steve was there for some. David and Nancy for a goodly part as well. At any rate, sometime in my 33rd year I just felt like I had deflated and it was over. Was that when the drinking really started? Or had the drinking been going on all along and thats part of why it never happened? I could kill myself with questions if I let myself go on.

Thats what Inside Llewyn Davis brought out in me, and I kind of knew it would. Thats part of the success of the film. It shows the grinding of an artistic life, no matter how small, pointless or ill-advised. it shows the choices people make even when they don't understand they're making choices and the audience can feel how those choices will ripple out and resonate in the mind of the chooser for the rest of their lives.

There are plenty of excuses I could make. Star City put out our last record right before 9/11. We were enjoying a lot of critical buzz at the time. After 9/11 we had to cancel tour dates and we never regained our momentum after that. The record deal stuff I mentioned above. We happened to be gaining momentum just as the music industry was dying. Etc. Etc.

Im still extremely proud of the work we did. I would put it up against other stuff that had more success and feel like it stands up, if not outshines, much of that stuff. But in my darkest moments thats cold comfort. I had a dream. Im not even sure these days what specifically that dream entailed, other than Get a record deal, make records, do that forever. It seems painfully naive now. Its incredibly hard not to be bitter and sad about it. Sometimes I succeed in that. Sometimes I dont.

Sometimes I wonder if Im actually insane. They say that the definition of crazy is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting a different result. A couple years after I receded from my music career I ended up coming to Iowa to become a writer. And of course I had early signs that maybe I could build something from that. And then the publishing industry fell apart as well. The only difference is this time I knew to expect it. I still get up and write, even though I know not many people in the larger scheme of things will probably ever read or hear my work. I try every day to be thankful for those who have and hopeful that I was able to add something to their lives with that work. And I know I have to just let it all go. But I keep doing it. Does that mean Im insane? I like to think no.

Its hard. Were conditioned as a culture to define success in a certain waypublic, spectacular, mythical. And because of that Ill always feel like a failure. Next month Im playing a show with Jason Isbell (a songwriter very similar to me but much more successful). I worked really hard to get that gig. And now I wonder why. Every time I think about it I try to see myself through his eyes, which is pointless but I cant stop myself. And I see him seeing me as a sad, failed hobbyist. It breaks my heart to think like that. But thats what it is.

And thats OK, right? Or itll have to be OK. I don't have a lot of choice in the matter. So thanks, Coen Brothers and Inside Llewyn Davis, for helping me dredge all this back up and explore it in the most narcissistic way possible. Id be remiss if I didn't admit that while Im typing this Im secretly hoping one of the Coen Brothers reads it and wonders, Who is this heart-wrenching forgotten artist? We must know him and bring his work to the world!

6092781,3,B00GMV8KGW,"Of course the movie ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was well done. It is by the Coen Brothers and all that, but I do have one complaint. The time period between the waning of the influence of the Beats and the rise of what we call The Sixties was just those few years from, say 1959 until the summer of 1965 when the Grateful Dead band formed. Yet those years were not a dead space or a pause, but a very active transition time indeed. However, there has been very little coverage or documenting of that time. Here comes ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" from the Coen Brothers, said to document just that very time in 1961 before the advent of Bob Dylan.

Well, that would have to be the winter and early spring of 1961, because Dylan was fully there in late spring. I know because I happened to be traveling with Dylan in New York City in June of 1961 along with my good friend Perry Lederman, one of the great guitar instrumentalists of that era. All three of us hitchhiked together. So it was with great anticipation that I looked forward to seeing this particular film. And now I will explain why for me it was such a disappointment.

I am no stranger to movies. After all, I founded the All-Movie Guide, one of the two largest movie databases on the planet, so I have seen my share of movies and then some. My family would testify to this.

And so it came as a shock for me to see the gray and somber tone of ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" flavored more with a Beat or Existentialist tone than the actual experience I remember from the time, which had its downs, of course, but especially it had its ups.

After all, Bob Dylan and I were twenty years old in the spring of 1961. Think about that for a moment. Life was fresh, and it was too early to be soured by either age or experience. It was filled with promise and enthusiasm. Sure, we had watched too many Ingmar Bergman movies and thought we were in love with the dark European shtick of those times, but that was just a veneer we tried hard to maintain. Inside we were ebullient Americans and young ones at that. That time was very exciting indeed and we were totally up for it.

Unfortunately, the Coen Brothers showed the glass as half-empty, but failed to point out that it was also half-full. This was a big disappointment, because perhaps we will never get another movie about that time period, and this movie does not do the reality justice. It is way too dark IMO.

I am happy to see any coverage of this period as compared to none, but the big news of then was not the dying of The Beat movement with its drab and ""so serious"" take on life, but just the opposite, the first signs of husking that faade off and the discovery that we young Americans wanted to live and love life, which the later 1960s would prove.

So thanks Coen Brothers for thinking of us and those times but, in my opinion, you missed the main point of way back then. To paraphrase Dylan, those not busy dying were busy being born.

We were busy being born and that experience, dear Cohen Brothers, would have made a great film.",1399248000,3,3038,4.3268892794376095

can be dark toned and subverting with the humor; for me--too much of the former and not enough of the latter.
But technical issues put me in a foul mood right away. The movie stalled for the entire two hours. The picture froze,
but the sound kept going. Oddly enough,I didn't feel like I was missing anything! Then the whole thing stopped. Fortunately,
Amazon somehow noticed this and issued a full refund a few days later--without me having to complain; and probably keeping me as a customer. O.K.--the film! The protagonist was possibly one of the most unlikeable of all time. Obviously he never got the memo: ""No man is an island"". Whether his self absorbtion led to bitter impregnated ex-lovers, deceased bandmate, offended benefactors, lost cats, and lost opportunities to climb the folk music scene; Llewyn showed his gift of alienation in spades. The soundtrack was a T-Bone Burnette disappointment--no ""Brother Where Art Thou?"" grammy here! The story was slow, slow, slow--because Llewyn was a first class bore. I've liked John Goodman's bizarre Cohen Brother's film cameos in one film--and it wasn't this one (it was Barton Fink). The recording scene with Justin Timberlake and Adam Driver was the crowning glory of the film--absurd and flat out funny!

The lead, Oscar Isaac is phenomenal as Llewyn Davis.  He is a brooding anti-hero, who can't get out of his own way, or even see that he is his own biggest problem.

In a low profile the story of Llewyn Davis unfolds, and like Barton Fink-but in a less grotesque way-this is a no way out story of an ambitious artist who believes he's somebody and he deserves better, whereas the truth is he's nobody(like everybody else) and he deserves nothing. This is not a story of how unfair show business can be-although it is also that, in a first layer-but the story of the human fate in the gutter, to say it in a poetic, maybe, way;it's the best way, since we are dealing with a piece of great modern art, and I'm glad that cinema can be that sometimes.",1398211200,3,937,4.229050279329609

I did see Dave Von Ronk in the village he stepped on my foot once and always had his wife at every show and did bring his cat to some shows, it's true that part.  What I don't get is why try and make him so unlikeable even the part where he leaves the abandon car he also leaves the cat if he had taken the cat i might've given this 4 stars because it meant he had good intentions.  Now in the movie he did show some good intentions and maybe he had integrity but they didn't show that enough.  What was the reason behind not wanting to join a folk group when offered by Dylan's ex-manager...we know why but it wasn't clear enough.  Also they didn't really reveal even a decent personality, I've seen Dave Von Ronk perform and he did tell charming stories and he did little side acts that were funny like he'd go into his pouch looking and looking for guitar picks.  Plus the movie was very dark and the audio was very low for the most part.  I just didn't get the movie and why it was done this way.  Personally i would've had alot alot of shots of the village because it's an endearing place as it is.  Musicially they did a pretty good job but they could've done better.  You had to have a fake dylan even a small part the part where he sang a few lines of an unreleased song wasn't enough.  You also don't get enough of a camadrie of the folk singers, I know the Tom Paxton character was there in the military guy who slept on the couch while the Dave character slept on the floor by orders of the semi-girlfriend who hated his guts but didn't stop her from making love to him on that dreadful night.  I get he wasn't the perfect human being or a saint by any means...but maybe that was the point...it seems alot of people are really mixed on this, personally i never saw such an even mixture of 1 to 5 star reviews ever before...usaully it's lopsided...I will watch it again because maybe i took the movie too seriously maybe that wasn't the intent to take it seriously.",1397433600,,2041,4.205128205128205
6092957,5,B00GMV8KGW,"I'll admit right up front, this movie is not for anyone. It has almost no semblance of any plot, and many of the ideas the film is exploring are buried pretty deep down.

I'm a huge fan of the Coen Brothers, and I've seen almost every single one of their movies. A lot of die hard fans will probably say I'm jumping the gun, but I really think this is one of their most focused, and frankly, one of the best movies they've ever made.

Strictly technically speaking, this movie is already a masterpiece. The dark, shadowy cinematography is some of the best I've ever seen (which is surprising considering it's the first movie in a long time that they haven't worked with Roger Deakins). It completely sets up the setting of a dark and melancholy, 1960's New York.

The title character is a fictional folk singer struggling to find his place in an ever-changing musical scene. Llewyn is a traditional folk singer, which means he sings traditional folk songs. One of the best lines in the entire film, ""It's never new, and it never gets old. It's a folk song."" However, with the recent death of his partner, he no longer knows how to be an artist. Together with his partner, they created an uplifting, sweet sounding record. On his own though, Llewyn has too sad a voice to be commercially successful.  So, Llewyn embarks on a mythological journey of self-discovery. Should he sell out and join a group like Bud Grossman advises? Or should he just continue making music because it means something to him? And what is his position in the new folk world as Bob Dylan emerges on the scene?

There's so much depth and emotion to this movie, and every single note out of Llewyn's mouth strikes a cord deep within the viewer. Oscar Isaac isn't just good in this movie, I honestly think he's the only person who could play. He is the perfect balance between actor and musician (he played and performed all the songs live). He communicates much of Llewyn's plight with just facial expressions.

I could go in depth a great deal about this movie, talk about the position of the artist, the influences of the mythological hero's journey, the significance of the cat (yes, it does mean something) but all those things are better left explored by each individual and they mean more when personally explored.

This movie still features the Coen's signature dark humor. ""Have you ever heard the expression it takes two to tango?"" My personal favorite. But there's a depth here that is even more than other Coen brothers movies, I would liken it the the deeper themes that are present in No Country For Old Men or A Serious Man. If you don't already like folk music (i do) then the amount of time dedicated to on screen performances might turn you off a bit, but I can't see how. They are beautiful and timeless. This movie really isn't for everyone, but if you like movies with tons of depth, that you can think about months after you've seen it, then this is the movie for you.

The point I guess is that karma gets back at him for this because others with better attitudes prosper all around him.  He is clearly depressed because of the suicide of his singing partner, but his behavior is so consistently unforgivable that you can't rally develop much sympathy for him (oddly, put me in mind of the Wolf of Wall Street).

6092988,5,B00GMV8KGW,"The Coen Brothers travel down memory lane for this one; and if you love folk music and the early folk scene in Greenwich Village, you will love this film. Llewyn Davis is a fictional character...a composite with characteristics of real folk singers like Dave Von Ronk, Ramblin' Jack Elliot, etc. The Coen's received inspiration from Von Ronk's posthumously published memoir; but Davis is meant to represent the many singers on the folk scene in New York who never made it to the big time. Oscar Isaac delivers an inspired performance in the lead...both as a singer and as a dramatic performer. Set in 1961, virtually all the songs that are performed are from the early folk music scene and virtually all are performed in their entirety...the sound track is arguably the best part of this film! In addition to Isaac, look for a fine performance from Carey Mulligan, who we last saw in ""The Great Gatsby"". Mulligan has developed into a talented actress with excellent range...she is half the folk duo, Jean and Jim; the other half of the duo is played by Justin Timberlake. The always dependable John Goodman does well in a support role. Toward the end of the film, listen for the biggest talent to emerge from the 60's folk scene, Bob Dylan. We catch a glimpse of the actor who plays him too, as Dylan sings one of his early folk gems, ""Farewell""...""So it's fare thee well my own true love/We'll meet another day, another time.""",1397174400,,1427,4.712

6092991,3,B00GMV8KGW,"Fans of the Coen brothers will find a number of their trademark strengths in ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" but if they're like me, they might agree that the whole is less than the sum of the parts. The attention to period detail -- here mostly Greenwich Village and environs c. 1961 -- lends authenticity, and the atmosphere of the smoky little clubs, as well as the small cheap apartments seems right. There are telling images of Llewyn edging to the end of an apartment-building corridor that seems to be getting narrower as it goes, and that seems a perfect image for his ""progress"" in the movie. The subdued tones in the cinematographer's palette have their effect too. Then there's the quirky humor -- here the business with a ginger cat and the near-immortal line, ""Where's his scrotum, Llewyn?"" The cat has another function, though, for it seems to like Llewyn when few others do. He seems to alienate almost everybody -- his friend's girl, played by Carey Mulligan as shrewish and unattractive, his sister, his dad, and, at least temporarily, the cat's owners and the guy who runs the club where we see him perform. But Llewyn as a person has no interest for us (nor do any of the other characters). We can be intrigued for a while by an unpleasant guy who does take his music seriously and wants to succeed in it -- but that's a one-trick pony over an almost two-hour movie. The Coen Brothers have a great feel for the use of music in movies, and this one is no exception -- the actors do their own singing, and it's good, and the songs are given their due -- no snippets of performance here. It's the fact that we hear the songs out, so to speak, that enable us to believe that Llewyn is serious about music if about nothing or no one else.

There are two very effective scenes: in the first, Llewyn sings Ewan McColl's great song ""The Shoals of Herring"" to his alienated and by now apparently demented father. ""Here's one you used to like, Dad,"" he says. It's poignant but a bit less weighty than it might be if we knew more about the source of the tensions in the Davis family. The other great scene is in Chicago at the Gate of Horn club, where Llewyn discovers that his agent has NOT sent his demo disc but where the club owner, played by an intent and sober F. Murray Abraham, gives him an audition anyway. He then tells Llewyn, not unkindly, that he's not quite good enough. Would he consider joining a trio? Llewyn doesn't want to be part of a group, but he listens to the club owner patiently and without animosity. He respects, you sense, a man who knows what separates a good performer from a special one, and he leaves quietly. It's perhaps his finest moment in the film. Back in New York, we see him undertaking the gig we saw at the movie's beginning and realize that everything in between is a flashback.

What blows a hole in the movie, though, is the long trip by car from New York to Chicago, where Llewyn grabs a ride with a freaky beat poet called Johnny Five and an obese drug-addicted jazz man played by John Goodman. I'll spare you the details, but this whole section drags. Neither jazzman nor poet is remotely interesting, nor is Llewyn interested in them. Goodman can't generate any comic energy out of his character, nor can Garrett Hedland out of the poet. It's a dreary episode in an episodic movie, and while the other episodes are less dreary they aren't all that much more compelling.

Don't be afraid to see the movie, though -- it is OK. The look and the music are good, and the actors do what they can with the material. And there's a glimpse at the end, as Llewyn leaves the club, of the act that follows him -- young Bob Dylan, his hair like a halo, singing in a voice that has the distinctiveness that Llewyn's lacks. The movie, though, like Llewyn himself, isn't quite good enough either.",1397088000,,3829,4.467142857142857

When the film was released this winter I missed the art house showing, but consoled myself that I knew I would buy the disc. All Coen brothers movies (except Ladykillers) are worth owning. I had to plug my ears when some of my friends were telling me how great it was - I didn't want to spoil my later enjoyment. I heard a couple of cuts from the soundtrack, which whet my appetite. Wow, Justin Timberlake actually sings something good! When I finally saw the movie, I wasn't disappointed - how could the Oscars have ignored it? The performances were spot on and the depiction of the era seemed accurate.  I hadn't heard of most of the main actors before, but I hope Joel and Ethan use some of them again. John Goodman was hilarious as a disgruntled junkie jazz musician. I really like jazz, but know that some of the (white) players hold such grudges. The folk music on the soundtrack is preformed well, and though somewhat predictable, it gives a newbie a good overview of that style. The movie correctly portrays the arrival of Dylan as a watershed event that would transform the scene.

6093079,4,B00GMV8KGW,"This Coen Brothers film, about the burgeoning folk scene in the early 60s had me wincing, laughing, and absorbed for its 90 minutes. The film opens in Greenwich Village in 1961 at a precise time just BEFORE Dylan burst onto the scene.

Llewyn Davis (an excellent performance by Oscar Isaac) is an utterly self-obsessed, careless, narcissistic musician. He is however a man of talent, self-belief, and creativity. And also laziness, prickliness and melancholy.

So the nub of the film is the self-obsession and belief which the artist MUST have, if they are to be putting their creative vision out there  married with the fact that the person themselves may not be particularly likeable. We (the consuming public) half forgive the often careless and badly behaved artist if their WORK touches us.

The Coens present us with this  in many ways Davis is a rather unlikeable human being, careless of everyone elses feelings, tender of his own. At yet, there is a curious vulnerability about him which is attractive enough to allow him to use people, because they see something in that vulnerability which they want to protect, not to mention a sense that what the artist creates may be much finer than the artist himself. So, as that fineness of creation is IN the artist, this means they must, surely, be a better person than they appear to be. Well, that I think is the theory that has artists forgiven for what would be unindulged  behaviour in non-artists.

Maybe we do believe, unlike what Orwell says, that an artist IS a special kind of man!

Davis stumbles through, journeying from New York to Chicago and back, in pursuit of fame and fortune, insulting people wittingly and unwittingly, coercing his way into places to stay, meals to be fed  and making at one point a terribly wrong decision around a recording session which the audience knows will sting. Davis is careless and selfish, sure, but he is also gauche and possessed of a certain gullible innocence  he both exploits and IS exploited.

Im sure Im not alone is also rooting for the parallel ginger cat story, one of those wonderfully real Coenesque eccentricities,  which left me, as a cat fancier,  wondering and worrying about one development. (cant say more, spoiler avoider)

Llewyn Davis has a Dylanesque musical style and voice, and indeed Oscar Isaac has some of that intense street-waif sexiness of the young Dylan, as in the album cover of the Freewheelin Bob Dylan, and there is almost a sub-text of could this be a version of Dylan. There is a neat barbed moment around this in the film, which had me wincing and laughing in equal measure.

With a great musical trawl through, in terms of live performance and soundtrack music, this was a thoroughly enjoyable film

Other performances of note in the film are the sweet faced, sweet voiced, foul mouthed and angry character played by Carey Mulligan, John Goodman as a fairly obnoxious jazz musician and Garrett Hedlund as Johnny Five, a beat poet, in the road/Chicago section of the film.

The 40 odd minute extras have a certain rough-cut charm, probably particularly to musicians.

I have one  small criticism of the sound quality of the spoken material, which seemed unusually quiet and muttery from some of the performers, so I had to have the volume turned up beyond normal levels to properly hear much of the dialogue.

Llewyn Davis is what one of the characters in the movie calls a ""loser."" That is, a struggling folk musician in 1961 Greenwich Village who's so bad off he doesn't even have a place to call his own. Instead, he's been reduced to sleeping on friends' couches for as long as they're willing to put up with him. Then it's on to someone else's place (he seems to have a rotation system set up amongst a group of regulars). Llewyn has also recently become a solo act following the suicide of his partner, and no one seems much interested in hiring Llewyn to play on his own. To further complicate matters, it seems Llewyn might just have impregnated his best friend's wife during a recent one-night stand, a woman, by the way, who really can't stand a thing about Llewyn, least of all the prospect of being a mother to his child.

In comparison to the flamboyance of some of their more recent works such as ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Burn After Reading,"" ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" finds Joel and Ethan Coen at their most subdued, spare and inward-looking. More somber mood-piece than narrative-driven drama, this is what we get when the boys decide to compose in a minor key. As such, the movie may try the patience of some in the audience and appear too slight to others, especially with its lack of a clear-cut resolution come fadeout time. The movie becomes especially stripped-down when Llewyn heads off on his own to Chicago in search of a gig, sharing a ride with an enigmatic and eccentric musician/heroin addict played by who else but John Goodman (this IS a Coen brothers movie after all).

Llewyn finds his identity and purpose in music and in the counterculture persona he displays to the world. The only trouble is that, while he feels superior to all the unenlightened ""squares"" whom he sees as having sold out to the Man and to crash commercialism, he's still dependent on those people to lend him a helping hand. After all, what's the point of being your own man when you have to keep throwing yourself on the mercy of others just to find a warm place to bed down for the night? Llewyn's troubles seem to be the result of a combination of factors: a lack of ambition, grief over his partner's death, and his decision to hide behind nonconformity as a justification for never growing up and never accepting the responsibilities that come with being a man. It could also be that he's just a bit of a jerk by nature.

Oscar Isaac gives an effectively understated performance as the title character, and the rest of the cast (including Carey Mulligan, F. Murray Abraham, and Justin Timberlake) is fine as well. Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is starkly beautiful, especially in those scenes set against the bleak landscape of a wintry Midwest.

""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't quite the engaging survey of the music scene or of Bohemian life in that specific place and time that the critics have claimed it is (the soundtrack is not really all that impressive), and it is no crowd-pleaser by any stretch of the imagination, but if you lower your expectations a mite, you may just get find yourself getting into its subdued portrayal of a social misfit.",1396137600,,3162,4.659498207885305

6093143,5,B00GMV8KGW,"It surely took me back to The Day. This movie, with its mostly dingy sets and costumes really did recapture the seedy, competitive, mellow, unique, early days of the folk revival where gentle fingerpicked guitar accompaniments nestled around lovely songs, both ancient and newly composed. There was probably some wisdom in underplaying the lead character claimed to be based on well-known singer Dave Van Ronk who I remember as having a more raucous, abrasive persona than appears in this movie. Llewyn Davis is, instead, an ordinary, mostly likeable, forgivably flawed, everysinger, anykid who ever practiced his guitar and his singing seriously enough to develop a halfway competent sound that stood out enough from the ordinary to earn set time on a spotlighted coffeehouse stool, but never developed the originality, star quality, and discipline required to actually function in that cruel, nefarious business that masqueraded as an uneasy amalgam of homey kitchen and antiques mall. That most songs are performed in their entirety throughout the movie is a delight and will result in hefty album sales, though maybe not quite as profitable as the music of ""O Brother Where Art Thou"" which appeals to a wider audience. Llewyn's rootless, penurious lifestyle so captures the actual situation of many of the young singers who managed to survive just short of starvation and homelessness while they waited (mostly in vain) to Happen in New York and, yes, even in lesser cities. The vulnerability of these young people to exploitation and abuse portrayed in the movie is true to life as is Llewyn's willingness to risk repeated betrayal and frustration in his quest for the featured spot. Once I got over not recognizing Dave Van Roink in Llewyn Davis, I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. The ending was just delicious, exactly how it felt when the music evolved!!! Inside Llewyn Davis did recapture a remarkable time in our cultural history that many of us remember more fondly than it deserves.",1396137600,45,1993,5.135384615384615

I had no expectations prior to viewing, but have always been a fan of the early folk scene (esp NY) and anything from the 60-70s music has always sparked my interest.  The film gives a both raw and romantic view of character Llewyn, his everyday struggles and overall ongoing journey.  It is probably similar to a lot of struggling artists from that time that were fighting to have/find their own unique voice amongst the wave of generic 'trendy' (soulless) commercial-oriented music.  Something I think that is also totally relevant for today (regardless of what genre you're talking about).  To me, the film was about fighting to find and hang on to one's own artistic integrity and individuality (and faith in one's self and one's dreams), in spite of the seas of bullsh*t around you.  I found it very inspiring.  At the end of the day, your personal success and fulfillment is up to you - no one else.

I watched a story about a truly gifted but unlikable adult trapped in (condemned to) a cyclical journey of failures due in large part to his social shortcomings and self-sabotage. (I think if any elements of Greek mythology are pointed to... perhaps it is the futility of  Sisyphus, the absurd hero.)

I also feel like I just watch a folktale pointing to the truth of what awaits many gifted adults/artists who never quite find their place. We briefly follow Llewyn's life which tells us all we need to know about his fate as the 'suffering artist' who never quite makes it or ""connects"" with people. Along the way, we also get a glimpse of other tortured artists whose fates all too often meet with drugs, incarceration, or even suicide.

Artsy folk will somehow spin this into a deep character study while a person who knows good movies will call this crap. Save your money and do not waist your time.

Luckily, I was home, and didn't have to run screaming from the theater. But as Leon Russell once said, ""I wrote a lot of songs, I made some bad rhyme""  And everyone gets to write a stinker or two, but my friends, this is a film FILLED with bad rhyme! The ""Clancy brothers"" sweater guys thing was pathetic---The REAL Clancy brothers should sue!

6093179,5,B00GMV8KGW,"This is a fantastic movie.  The first thing that should be mentioned is that the music is excellent, in every sense of the word.  The songs are brilliant. Not hardcore folk, and not hippy protest music.  Just great songs performed very well.  What struck me most (but I'm kind of a nerd about this) was how well the songs were recorded. I absolutely flipped over the sound.  The next thing is that this movie is very, very funny.  Not ""Spinal Tap"" funny.  Not Judd Apatow funny.  But also not art-house, only-me-and-three-other-Nihilists-get-it funny.  For the first 10 minutes you think, ""Is it just me or this movie really that funny?"" Half way through John Goodman's performance, you're thinking, ""Holy crap! This movie is really funny!""  The guy who plays Llewyn Davis is sure to get no consideration for any major award.  Ironically, it's because he's so good.  He seems to be just playing himself.  However, a new award should be invented just for John Goodman and those who wrote his character.  Call it the Alec Baldwin ""Coffee is for Closers"" award.  Goodman and his character, though different Baldwin's character in ""Glengary Glenross,"" are just as exceptional.  ""This will interest you"" will forevermore be a loaded phrase in my mind.  Finally, if you got the humor of the movie, you'll get the ending. It's not an obvious ending, like in ""Blue Jasmine"" or ""Crazy Heart."" It's been a week, and I still haven't been able to decide whether the ending is comic, tragic, or neither--just somehow apropos.  Maybe both?  You can chew on the ending for weeks, if you want.

I can't explain why so many people failed to connect to it, maybe they sought a tongue-in-cheek O Brother Where Art Thou or their own interpretation of the Greenwich Village folk scene and the Great Folk Scare. Has anyone read a novel? The Coens have brought us a made-for-the-screen a novel of that time, complete with all the understatement, atmosphere, and complexity of character. You can make your characters lovable and fun or you can make them real, and I'm glad the Coen Brothers attempted the latter. Llewyn Davis is a man out-of-step with his time, once hungry for praise and acceptance, now just hungry, seeking a living at the only thing he knows he does well. He dislikes most of his friends, even his sexual liaisons, justifies living off of others for that reason, and identifies more with a wayward cat than any humans he knows. His partner threw himself off a bridge--there really is no mystery there. Was he different before this loss, or was it the rejection of the music world that left him who he is when we meet him in the movie? That's left for you to figure out.

We all must choose whether to be independent or conform, and this is a difficult question for all of us, but even more so for a starving artist.

6093268,4,B00GMV8KGW,"Oscar Issac, who plays Llewyn Davis, is a gifted actor and vocalist; a voice well-suited for the village and subsequently national folk music of the early 60s. When I first heard him sing I heard remnants of Dave Van Ronk, one of the fathers (and my favorites) of the early NY folk scene. Stay with the credits for more good music; Dave van Ronk closes them out.  The movie mirrors Dylan's description of the New York scene in his autobiography titled bob Dylan, Chronicles: Volume One (been waiting several years for Volume two); a description in which he's paid tribute in the movie's last scene.  The harsh winters in the movie parallel the main character's  harsh struggles to make a living doing what he loves.  John Goodman's brief appearance is good stuff; worth the price of admission.  In short: See the movie...unless you're only into romantic comedies, though it has plenty of ironic humor",1395705600,,900,4.818181818181818
6093269,5,B00GMV8KGW,"The Brothers Coen -- Joel and Ethan  have a lot of love for Folk music. Ever since making their movie O Brother, where art thou?(2000), which featured a folk music soundtrack, they have been itching to do a film about this form of US traditional music. And they finally did it, and splendidly succeeded, with the very passionate and penetrating Inside Llewyn Davis.

They idea behind the film was to basically recreate New Yorks Greenwich Village musical scene before the arrival of Bob Dylan. For that purpose, we are transported to New York in 1961, to a place called the Gaslight Caf&eacute;, where we meet Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), who is playing for an attentive and receptive crowd. Once he finishes the set, he is told that a guy wanted to talk to him in the alley. He goes there and the fellow beats the hell out of Llewyn, apparently for something that happened the previous night. From then on, we are taken to the recent past, where we see a very talented Llewyn trying to get a chance to show his art, singing folk songs. However, he just cant get that evading break. You see, the man just has bad luck, as he has a pregnant ex-lover (or not?) who tells him, Everything you touch turns to s..t, and verbally abuses him to no end. He is also trying to find a cat that he looses while sleeping in one of his friends (and protector) apartment. All these situations are enough to destroy a human soul, but Llewyn keeps trying against all odds. I truly enjoyed Carey Mulligan, as the abusive ex-lover, and John Goodman, as a junkie jazz musician. And Coen Brothers found gold in Isaac, who can actually sing and act  a rarity.

Inside Llewyn Davis doesnt only represent the microcosm of Llewyns life, but also the daily existence of any struggling musician in the Greenwich Village scene during those creative years, especially during the nasty winter days. It is real and important. Justin Timberlake also plays a singer trying to make his mark. The DVD includes a very complete making-of documentary. (USA, 2013, color, 104 min plus additional materials)

6093275,5,B00GMV8KGW,"If you liked A Serious Man, you'll like this. It isn't as subdued as A Serious Man, but of a similar tone. I loved both. If the user reviews are any indication, some viewers apparently want to be more entertained than they're going to be watching this. I don't dispute that - it's your business what you like. It's not Raising Arizona or Fargo or Oh Brother; it's nonetheless excellent.

April 16 - A month (roughly) later. I've seen it twice more. This is a remarkable piece of work. It achieves - in its soundtrack - an amazing degree of verisimilitude. The construction of the novelty song, Please Mr. Kennedy, which is exactly the sort of song that would be a ""folk"" hit, is sufficiently well-wrought that, had that been the ONLY song in the movie, I'd have been impressed. But there are many others, each one of a stripe that tells precisely who the character performing the song is. There are the ""pretty,"" popular songs performed by the light-weights, and the ""genuine,"" true to form songs performed by Lllewyn. So much thought went into the music that I'm blown away, but then it is T Bone Burnett, from whom I'd expect nothing less.

Also of interest is the timeline, which is one of the cleverest I've seen. The movie is like a mobius strip; it begins and ends with minute variations of the same scene, one in which the cat gets out and one in which he doesn't. The movie is about ALMOST making it, as if to say that there's just a hair's breadth (cat gets out, cat doesn't get out) between making it and not. Llewyn performs on a hit record, but needs his money right now, and so declines his royalties. Bud Grossman (think Albert Grossman)offers him a chance to sing with another guy and a girl if he'll sing harmonies, trim his beard back to a goatee, and stay out of the sun. That describes exactly a group that DID make it: Peter, Paul and Mary. His first/last performance he's sharing the basket with guess who (HINT: it's a nasal guy who sings Fare Thee Well). So he's forever just missing the boat (literally and figuratively). Not only that, but he's ALMOST a good guy. His performances are heart-felt, quality affairs, but in real life his act is not so good. He ALMOST cares for the cat. He loves Jenny, but can't quite be nice to her; consequently, she has long since stopped being nice to him. The Gorfeins adore him, but he isn't consistently polite, to say nothing of nice, to them either.

So, does he deserve not to succeeed, or is he just unlucky? I think that's the real point. We just live our lives, and we simply can't tell what's driving our fate. Or if it matters.",1395446400,,2598,4.465263157894737
6093306,3,B00GMV8KGW,"Joel and Ethan Coen are among the quirkiest of mainstream filmmakers. Their films often hit just the right note of bizarreness to offer  richly textured characters and oddball plots. They definitely march to their own drummer and have, for years, defied traditional thinking about what a feature film should be.

""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is their latest film, which takes place in 1961 and focuses on the Greenwich Village folk music revival that was at its peak before Bob Dylan entered the scene and shook up traditional folk with a new sound, blending blues, folk and rock.

Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is thoroughly embedded in that scene. We meet him after a partnership has broken up due to tragedy and he's been forced to go it as a solo. But things aren't going that well. He has no permanent home, crashing for days at a time here and there, with any kind soul who has an empty couch to offer. His frequent gigs at the Gaslight Cafe have failed to draw critical attention, his solo album is selling poorly, he's gotten Jean (Carey Mulligan), the wife of a friend, pregnant, he has no coat, and he's responsible for letting the pet cat of one of his hosts escape. Life looks bleak.

Llewyn seems locked into a routine that only offers him disappointment, disillusionment, and stagnation. It's as if life is dragging him into an ever-widening abyss.

The Coens are not the types to present a completely depressing film, so it is filled with interesting little episodes, colorful characters, and vignettes that capture an early 60's vibe. Folk music was sometimes rooted in man's struggles, but could be woefully pretentious as well. Llewyn is serious about his music, but makes a lot of decisions that stunt his career.

When he gets a studio gig as second guitarist accompanying friend Jim (Justin Timberlake), it's for a dopey novelty song filled with topical references called ""Please Mr. Kennedy,"" as far from folk music as you can get, but with an insistent beat and funny lyrics that make it the kind of song that just might become a hit. Llewyn looks on this not as a tremendous opportunity, but as a chance to pick up some quick bucks. Labeling Llewyn self-destructive may be too easy. He's more complex than that, and it's that complexity that draws us in.

One of his biggest problems is connecting with an audience. He doesn't have boyish good looks or on-stage charm. A fellow who crosses his path, Troy Nelson (Stark Sands), is a marked contrast to Llewyn -- self-effacing, handsome, and talented. Llewyn watches opportunities pass him by as others succeed, failing to look within himself to discover the cause.

Mr. Isaac, a graduate of New York City's Juilliard School, performs all his own songs and handles the dramatic scenes effectively despite a fairly skimpy acting resume. His performance incorporates arrogance, anger, frustration, disdain, bitterness, and resignation.

Often in movies, music is heard in pieces rather than as a whole, so that dialogue can be interspersed and pace kept brisk. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" departs from that convention by allowing full songs to be performed. And it's during these performances that we see that Llewyn has real talent and that he could be successful were it not for his ability to disrupt his own life and the lives of those with whom he comes in contact. So his tragic flaw, if you will, is his own onerynees.

The movie is akin to a day in the life of Llewyn Davis, though the events depicted cover a greater time span. The Coens present an assortment of characters who interact with Llewyn in different ways, ranging from the vituperative venom pouring from Jean's mouth to the painfully candid assessment of his singing by record promoter Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) to a rambling tirade by jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman).

Rated R, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is a character study of a not very enviable person. Mr. Isaac manages to have us care about Llewyn as the Coen Brothers magnify his unremarkable life for the cameras, enlivening a 50-year-old era vividly.

He is one of those pragmatic characters that just seems to internalize EVERYTHING yet so much is happening inside of him. I just wanted to jump inside and make love to his mind. I never even knew of Oscar Isaac until now. How is this possible? And with that VOICE??? Hot damn!  The cat sidestory is hilarious and conceptually genius. I

And Justin Timberlake is in it!!! I did NOT know this until I started watching it. I have never been a fan of JT... although I acknowledge he's a great performer... but, in this role, his voice really stood out and I like that he took this humble role. Made me actually like him. Why Amazon says him and Carey Mulligan are the main actors though is beyond me. Oscar Isaac is first and foremost in this film and should be recognized as such.

John Goodman, as always, is spectacular. Grumpy, frumpy drug addict. His acting is superb.

6093313,5,B00GMV8KGW,"A folk troubadour in 1961 Greenwich Village Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) travels the circuit strumming and warbling his offerings receiving polite applause and eking out a living with what is collected in the hat that's passed around.  Davis is no better or worse than the average performer his songs hitting the right clichs about war and peace.  Equal parts self loathing and narcissism he is too pathetic to truly hate or love for that matter.  His music is merely passable enough to get him a different couch to sleep on every night if not relegated to the floor.  This is a daring effort by the Coens  painting a portrait of mediocrity and inviting the audience to empathize with him to some degree.  The look and feel of the film is captured meticulously by the Coens and I particularly liked the song score by T-Bone Burnett.  It's easy to write good songs but it must have been a real chore writing forgettable ones.  Davis' songs are contrasted early in the film by those of Jim(Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan) and later by the master himself, Bob Dylan.  Davis may be a good craftsman but his work lacks the spark to be truly transcendent or as the record executive tells him in an audition, ""I can't sell this"".

The soundtrack seemed ordinary at first but when I heard it again, I found some solace in its sweet melody. This is one of the year's best films and we all know 2013 was a knockout year that kept on surprising us with drama upon drama. Llewyn Davis has everything, it has a steady visit, some grounding music, beautiful sets and scenes,  a cute cat, a strange lady who doesn't know who's baby she is carrying, some hilarious scenes and LLEWYN DAVIS of course.

Yes, we all love the Coen brothers--but this one is weak. Maybe it's because it's about the folk music scene of the early 60's. But the problem was not so much the 'scene' but the boring as hell portrayal of it. The dullest acoustic, ""folk"" music I have ever heard. Peter Paul & Mary were astoundingly good--and their music was gorgeous. This stuff was plain-as-mud dull. This was the big issue for me. But I loved the cat. Actually, that was what I liked best. But the girlfriend, played by the brilliant, Carey Mulligan, was so hostile and cruel, I felt the main character was a total wuss to put up with her. Then there's his sister, another bitter, unlikeable woman.

The professor, however, was a bright spot, but the main character's tantrums made it too hard for me to care about him as well. Sorry, but this movie was a drag--despite some nice touches in captivating a certain mood of the times and John Goodman's character, who was another awful person, but the acting was so superb, he was somehow bearable.",1395100800,,1160,4.572115384615385

6093525,5,B00GMV8KGW,"The Coen Brothers' ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" follows a week in the life of a frustrated folk singer (partly modeled on the real life Dave Van Ronk) in the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961, when the beat generation is giving way to the hippy movement.

This strikes me as a cinematic masterpiece that walks a thin tightrope between being darkly melancholic, absurdly comic, as well as life affirming, and I found it to be one of the smartest and most profound works of existential art ever produced in any medium. The moral journey of Llewyn Davis (maybe the Coens' greatest character) through what seems to be the worst week of his life serves as a metaphor of the human condition.  In fact, his journey is really his 'Odyssey' (to emphasize this, the wonderful cat in the film -- Llewyn's closest relationship -- is named 'Ulysses').  I even think of the myth of Sisyphus (existential? ...think Camus' ""Myth of Sisyphus""!) spending his life working repeatedly to push a huge boulder up a steep mountain to have it keep rolling back down again).  Like Laurel and Hardy pushing that piano up the countless steps, I see Davis more as someone with whom we can empathize as he continues to crap out; others see him as a slimeball.  Take your choice, but I think not to identify with him is to negate the universal meaning of the film.

Appropriately, the film has a muted color palette by the great 56-year-old French cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel (known for his images of 'fantastic realism' for Jean-Pierre Jeunet films like ""Amelie"" and ""A Very Long Engagement"").  It provides the perfect melancholic mood for the protagonist's journey and Delbonnel consciously worked to replicate the look and feel of the cover of ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" record album, succeeding to make the film appear ""slushy"" as a New York City winter.

It has a sense of deep humanity in every performance (especially Oscar Isaac as the serious-minded, existential 'hero' who conveys brilliantly his interaction with the other people around him), a wonderfully evocative song score (most of which is recorded live), and not a single false scene or shot thanks to Joel and Ethan Coen's cinematic mastery.  It deservedly won the Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Film Festival, was picked by the National Society of Film Critics as the year's best film, and is easily my choice as the finest film of 2013.

As far as the transfer, the muted and 'slushy' look of the film ironically requires Blu-ray because of its clarity.  I find the DVD doesn't do justice to the film even though the transfer is probably perfect.  Also, the Blu-ray has a wonderful 42-minute documentary on the film's making (spending most of its time on the music recording), so I'd splurge for the Blu-ray.",1394928000,6,2751,4.842217484008529

6093588,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Oscar Isaac's career pretty much mirrors the story of this film. He's magnificent in his portrayal of a guy who has something to offer but can't cut a break. He's totally enjoyable. Many have said that the film has a mean spirit, but it's only out of the greed of the moguls at the time (no different than now). Sure, Llewyn isn't perfect, regarding social skills, but not enough is said about the suicide of his singing partner, which is my only argument with his character. The Coens, in their wisdom, chose to have you see Llewyn as he is, and not as he thought he'd be.

He's fragile, more than you think. He's triggered by simple things, but there's an innate subtext of survival and a joy of life. The cat is more important than you think. His scenes with John Goodman reflect perfectly how much he hates phonies. His scenes with Carrie Mulligan reflect perfectly how he views himself in the worldly scheme of things. He's flawed and knows it.

He;s been duped by so many people, he's become a self-serving maverick, since he no longer knows who to count on or believe in. His apathy toward the subject of abortion is simply a sign of the times.

The film took place in early 1960's Greenwich Village, long before Dylan, Peter Paul & Mary or Joan Baez. Not too long after Kerouak. It was a time, after Eisenhower's administration, when life was fairly relaxed and comfortable. The song, ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" was a rousing and fun moment, not political at all.

I eagerly await the next one.

After thinking about it for a couple of months I saw it again yesterday.  It seemed to provide a relentless parade of faces collapsing or exploding with the detonation of hurtful words.  In that relentlessness of hurtful words I was put in mind of P. T. Anderson's ""Magnolia,"" which on its opening week tested my capacity for loud fighting and cruelty such that I saw the second half for the first time when I tried again a year later.  I cherish the experience all the same.

It takes one to know one.  Were Jean and Llewyn drawn to each other by a shared fluency in withering profanity and an ancient need for a sparring partner?  Jim does not know what he's got.

6093626,5,B00GMV8KGW,"The Coen Brothers are one of the most beloved directing duos (possibly THE most beloved) in all the world, and its easy to see why.  Both Joel and Ethan Coen have done their best to cultivate and maintain a pretty impressive resume of films that span genres, themes and circumstance and yet all rest comfortably in the flare of their stylistic dead-pan writing.  They understand humor and how it incorporates itself comfortably into drama, and they know how to spin tales so bizarre they feel authentically human.  Yes, they fail from time to time (and when they do its usually pretty awful) but theyve earned to right to fail.

Their best is better than most.

Since their Oscar win back in 2007, the Coens have been dwelling comfortably in Oscars good graces, racking up nominations for their writing and their films and their actors and their directing and have pretty much become an Oscar staple, so it was easy to see why so many presumed Inside Llewyn Davis was going to be another big hit for them.  It received unanimous praise at the festival circuit as well as upon its theatrical release, and it looked primed for Oscar acceptance.

And then it received a Sound Mixing nomination and NOTHING else.

What makes this all the more depressing is that this is possibly their finest film since Fargo!

While the rest of the world was devouring their every output, I was reluctantly holding off until they delivered something that felt tighter, stronger and more in the vein of what I expect from them.  I really like No Country for Old Men, but to me that wasn't a true Coen Brothers film.  True Grit had a stronger sense of their whit about it, but it still felt muffled under the guess of two beloved directors trying to test out their range.  A Serious Man felt like a return to their roots, their true form, and yet it was messy and incoherent and really needed some elaboration in parts.

Inside Llewyn Davis is everything that A Serious Man tried to be and more.

The film is kind of a non-story about a musician drifting through life, bouncing from couch to couch and alienating everyone he knows because hes, well, not a very nice person.  When the film opens, Llewis is in an smoky bar bellowing a folk song and our attention is instantly stolen and propelled into this journey of self-discovery that feels deeply enriched through the sounds and sights around us.  Using music as a springboard for many other things, Inside Llewyn Davis is a swell of celestial sounds that heightens the atmospheric presentation and delivers one of the Coens finest composite films.

To say this is lesser Coen is a joke.

I love the way that the Coen Brothers present such deeply rooted life lessons without saccharine overtures, dealing out a film that feels uniquely human, if it were.  The interactions between Llewyn and those around him spiral off into splinters of his own life, his own demons as it were, and present a universal truth about the struggle to create, to perform, to live and ultimately to conform.  Llewyns journey feels authentic and gives us a reason to root for such an unsavory character.

With star performances throughout, this is an all-around gem of a film.  Carey Mulligan tears apart each of her scenes with a sharp and biting presence that escalates with each passing scene, and John Goodmans brief appearance adds an unexpected depth of mystery to the plot and the themes presented, but obviously this is Oscar Isaacs film to carry, and boy does he ever!  He encompasses Llewyn Daviss every attribute, and his line delivery is laced with an ingrown sadness that permeates his actions and endears us to him, despite his repulsive attitude.  This is a star performance if I ever saw one and it makes me so excited to see where he goes from here.",1394668800,7,3774,4.683333333333334

6093632,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Rooted firmly in the NYC folk scene of the 1960s (before Dylan came along and turned it all around), INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS follows a troubled, mostly unlikable folk singer as he bounces like a parasite from friend to friend, stranger to stranger.  Davis is trying to find himself, and his music, after the suicide of his former partner.  He's self-centered, unaware of the effect he's having on people.  He's also uncertain what to do with the cat that's tagged along with him, or even the feline's name and gender.

Oscar Isaac carries the show; he gives a nuanced, detailed performance and loses himself utterly in the role.  The supporting cast comes and goes, but each actor brings along their A-game: Justin Timberlake, Carey Mulligan, Adam Driver, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund, and others.  The soundtrack is intoxicating, and the cinematography puts you right in Greenwich Village, circa 1961.

Like all of their films, the Coen Brothers bring their own special blend of dark humor, poignant emotion, and nihilistic chaos.  The humor is flat, dry, and quick, often followed by a throwaway scene of gut-bursting emotional brutality.  Like all of their films, at times you may find INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS hard to watch.

6093650,4,B00GMV8KGW,"This review is fairly lengthy but I think those interested in the ""Folk Music"" aspect of the film will find it worth reading.

First, a point of information: Amazon has a policy to group all reviews of ALL formats of a film (in theaters,streaming,DVD, and BD) together. It is important to note which version the reviewer is commenting on and to note the date of the review (you can sort by Newest First.)  With that said, this is a review of the DVD. It will not be released until  March 11, 2014 but I was sent a copy by the studio in advance.  I did see the film in the theater in December and my review of the film itself will be based on what I wrote then.  The film on the DVD is no different. And, I'm told that Bluray has the same ""Special Feature"" and the print should be the same.  In an ""about face"" from my usual reviews, I will discuss the ""Bonus Features"" - since there are 26 reviews before mine about the film itself.

The ""bonuses"" are really singular: One 42-minute ""making of"" featurette titled ""Inside Inside Llewyn Davis"". There is not a trailer - or even previews of other films.  While much of it concerns the music in the film and how the pre-recording was done in a studio for ""practice"", though the performances in the film were done ""live on set"", there are interviews with both Coens, the costume designer and music producer T Bone Burnett.  The rehearsal scenes appeared jump on my HD TV screen and the sharpness varied throughout the featurette. One thing you notice when scenes from the film are included is that the Coens used lots of muted blues and greens in the color palette. They are in sharp contrast from the brighter colors (though still not very bright) of the interview scenes.

For those who saw the film in the theater (as I did and will comment below) and wondered why many of the ""real facts"" were wrong, the Coen interviews here will shed some light.  Near the beginning of the interviews, Joel says "" I asked Ethan, ""Wouldn't it be fun to start a movie with Dave Van Ronk being beaten up outside Gerdes' Folk City, and he gets beaten up by Jean Ritchie's husband?"". And Ethan replied "" Who's gonna beat up a folk singer, for goodness sake?"".  Even Burnett - in his interview - says ""we may use real Van Ronk songs, but the rest is a `made-up movie'.""
So that's what you can expect on the DVD. I'll now discuss my take on the film itself.

This review is aimed primarily at those who want to know how it represents the ""folk music"" of the era.

Inside Llewyn Davis is the newest film written and directed by the Coen brothers and - because of all the music included, with T-Bone Burnett on board as Music Producer - it will certainly be compared with the Coen's O Brother Where Art Thou. But even the Coens say (in press note quotes) that is a  different style of film. One of the reasons is that most of the songs featured in the film , and on the Soundtrack CD (coming next week from Nonesuch, a month in advance of the film release), are performed in their entirety. After the name of the film studio (CBS Films/Studio Canal) appears on the screen, we are immediately presented with Isaac (as the ""folk singer"" Llewyn Davis) singing the traditional song ""Hang me, Oh Hang Me"" in the Gaslight coffee house in Greenwich Village in 1961. (The film's title refers to the title of a solo album by Davis that was a sales disaster.)  The song is performed in it's entirely at over three minutes.  Then the story begins. . Davis leaves the coffee house and is attacked by a stranger. Over the next 100 minutes we learn what caused this event.  It's the Coen's version of the Greenwich Village music scene until 1961, when Bob Dylan arrived with his new songs.  The brothers admit that they are too young to have been there in those years and decided to base the title character very loosely on folk music icon Dave Van Ronk and the posthumous autobiography that was finished by writer Elijah Wald after Van Ronk's death in 2002 at age 66. The word ""loosely"" is important here. Isaac neither looks, nor sounds like Van Ronk (viewers will hear Van Ronk's distinctive rough voice in a reprise of the Len Chandler song ""Green Green Rocky Road"" over the closing credits). And, except for the fact that DVR was sang mostly traditional folk songs (though he did write a few), was in the Merchant Marines and travelled to Chicago to try to get a gig at the ""Gate of Horn"", there is little of DVRs life in the script.

In the earlier parts of the film there are performers who are ""composites"" of musicians of the era (of which I experienced firsthand) with a soldier from Fort Dix who is obviously based on Tom Paxton (and the actor - Stark Stands - sings Paxton's ""The Last Thing on My Mind""). There is an attempt to show how Peter, Paul and Mary were formed with the Stands' character joining actors Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake - as a duo named Jim and Jean - to sing a ""novelty: song -(composed by a ""committee"" including Timberlake, Burnett and the Coens) titled ""Please Mr. Kennedy ""  and release it as by the ""John Glenn Singers"" . It's the only new song in the film and on the soundtrack album. Reading the lengthy press kit I kept being struck with how little the Coen's (and honestly Burnett) knew about the music of the period. First, though there was a real husband/wife duo named Jim & Jean (the Glovers) who had a huge hit with ""Crucifixion"" written by Phil Ochs - who was Glover's college roommate, Ethan Coen is quoted as saying ""There was a real act called Jim and Jean but all we essentially took from them - from their act - was their name. I have no idea who they were as people. Jim and Jean, as they are in the movie, they are our invention"".  And - re: the Kennedy song, Burnett says in an interview that it was based on a real song from 1960s called ""Please Mr. Kennedy, don't send me off to Vietnam"" by Tom Lehrer (who Burnett says he loves. Well Lehrer never wrote such a song. The closest he ever wrote was ""We'll All Go Together When we Go"" and the song in the film is probably closer to Larry Verne's 1960 top ten hit ""Please Mr. Custer"".  There was a recording - in 1962 (a year after the film takes place) titled ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" by a little known group called The Goldcoast Singers, but I'm sure that is not what Burnett is referring to. And the film notes state that state - though not attributed to anyone - that ""other musicians who played on the tracks were Punch Brothers, The Lost City Ramblers, and John Cohen, who played banjo"".  Honestly, I've never heard of TLCR though there was a legendary NYC 60s group, The New Lost City Ramblers, with John Cohen, Tracey Schwarz and Mike Seeger - though Seeger died in 2009 and the group no longer exists.  So much for creditability.

Honestly I liked the film. I can't say I loved it. I knew there was a new young cast but I hoped it would be more historically accurate.  If you approach it as a Coen brothers' film - with quirky narratives and monologues (John Goodman's monologue as an obese jazz musician -loosely based on Dr. John or Doc Pomus, though, from what is left in the film, you can't tell that he ever played an instrument- is a classic Coen brothers ""riff"") - you'll enjoy it. And maybe - just like O Brother - younger movie goers will have their music tastes peaked to learn more about Van Ronk and the other Village folkies.

Speaking of music, the Coens decided to have all the songs recorded by the actors in a studio first to get them in the mood. Then, during filming (all of which, by the way, was filmed in New York ; even the Chicago scenes), they played and sang live again. It's my understanding that the ""soundtrack"" album is, in fact the studio recordings and not what you are hearing in the film. But I can't be certain.

I've been listening to the album for a few weeks and do like it (though it takes some time to get used to Isaac's version of ""Green, Green..."" .

For those who are knowledgeable of the REAL characters in Van Ron's life, I'd like to make you aware of a discovery I found only after I re-read the cast credits. Near the end of the film you will see (and hear) a woman playing the autoharp. She's a pivotal character - though only on the screen briefly. You may not recognize her but that is Nancy Blake, who with her husband, Norman was part of the folkie/bluegrass movement in the 1960s.

Before I finish this review I want to give special kudos to one of the cast members not previously mentioned.  It's not a human but a male cat (actually played by four different ones). The cat's name is mentioned only once near the end and - surprisingly isn't listed in the credits (or even an internet search) but he/they play a major role in the film as you will see.  Cats are not as easy to train as dogs and this cat is funny!

I hope you found this review both informative and helpful.

6093651,4,B00GMV8KGW,"This is probably the Coen brothers' most polarizing film - either you see it as a beautiful, if disenchanted, evocation of the New York folk scene of the early 1960s, or as a hundred-minute downer about a self-loathing dead-ender. It's neither, really, but it's also more than the sum of its parts. In truth, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't particularly interested in the folk scene as such; it's really more of a setting for the Coens to bemusedly watch a singer (Oscar Isaac) lose the last vestiges of whatever led him into music to begin with. Llewyn Davis has been part of the Greenwich Village scene for awhile - long enough to have been part of a semi-successful duo and to get a couple of girls pregnant - but he's stuck living on the margins, running in a hamster wheel of endless club gigs. The film charts the myriad ways he both shoots himself in the foot with his few remaining friends and tries, and fails, to break out of his rut.

In other words, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is really about disenchantment: how the world, the commercial world especially, will grind down the things that give your life joy and meaning. When we watch him perform at the film's beginning, Oscar Isaac conveys not only Davis' expressive talent, but also what these tunes have meant to him and how they have sustained him. As the film batters away at him - literally at times - we watch that already faint light grow progressively dimmer until the Coens' deliver their ultimate cosmic joke: a Minnesota kid who debuts on the stage after him and just as Lewis is getting pounded behind the club.

""Inside Llewyn Davis"" establishes a cold-sober tone; there's no warm nostalgia in the Coens' recreation of the early 1960s. If you're hoping for a romanticized vision of the early folk scene, look elsewhere. And while the film is quite funny, this is a particularly vinegary comedy where the humor always comes with a nasty sting. The Coens have made it their stock-in-trade to dissect, often cruelly, those that fail in American life (""Barton Fink,"" ""Fargo,"" ""Lebowski,"" ""No Country For Old Men,"" ""A Simple Man"") and ""Llewyn Davis"" is their bitterest film yet.  Personally, I liked the Coens' determination not to be likable or to go soft here, but I can well understand why many critics and others have found this film so off-putting. They don't yield Llewyn Davis, or us, an inch. For some, this will seem like punishment but, for me, it is mark of integrity -- ""Llewyn Davis"" is about anyone who's ever had to cash out their aspirations and join the real world.  I didn't always enjoy it while I was in the theater but, two months later, it has stayed with me far more than any other recent film I've seen.",1393113600,5,2690,4.644957983193278
6093652,5,B00GMV8KGW,"First you have to rate this film as understated and clever. It isn't like any other film the Coen Bros. have done but there are glimpses of their other films within. The humor of a folksinger pillaging around Greenwich and literally burning every bridge to the waterline not to mention being insulting is not fodder for the lighthearted. What you will find is glimmers of genius within the cinematography, script and soundtrack contained in this film. The brilliance in the film is how much you completely buy into the acting and music hook, line and sinker. We all know someone like Llewyn. A genius, yet severely troubled and their own worst enemy. It is completely relatable on that level of premise alone. Everyone wants their Llewyn to succeed but of course they completely screw up everything and everyone they come in contact with. In the end you throw your hands up and ask ""why???"". Ultimately this type of main character gives up their self-worth and takes a day job. The best part is that you know this person and only a few folks have access to a best kept secret. Furthermore ""Another Day, Another Time"" , the live concert in NYC Town Hall is the perfect companion to knock this out of the park after screening this movie. Absolutely beautifully done performances on caliber with the film. I'll never understand why this film wasn't better received but that's the beauty.

6093653,5,B00GMV8KGW,"As being a Welshman I was curious about the name Llewyn Davis it should really be spelt Llewelyn Davies. I did not think anymore about this until I was reading about J.M.Barrie the novelist and playwright. When he came to London he met the Llewelyn Davies Boys and they inspired him to write the Peter Pan stories. Nobody seems to have noticed this.

I am sure the Coen Brothers knew this. Bob Dylan another Welsh name , certainly to me was the Peter Pan of the Folk Music scene in the 60,s",1392595200,5,490,4.326086956521739
6093654,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Set in Greenwich Village in 1961, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS dramatizes the life of the eponymous hero (Oscar Isaac), who tries to carve out a career as a solo folk singer after his partner commits suicide.  The film vividly recreates the atmosphere of the Gaslight Cafe, a real-life venue that opened in 1958 and closed in 1971, where acts such as Bob Dylan, Bill Cosby, and Luke Faust performed.  The Caf attracted high-profile patrons: Jimi Hendrix was known to visit one night.  Llewyn is never going to be that popular; but we have to admire his spirit as he tries his best, despite numerous obstacles placed in his way.  The 1961 setting is significant: the Coen Brothers' film recreates a significant moment in American popular culture when people broke free of their conservative shackles and began to express themselves in much more basic terms.  Politics became a legitimate subject for popular music, rather than the anodyne lyrics characteristic of many chart-topping hits of the late Fifties.  Llewyn tries his best to emphasize the significance of his songs, but no one appears to listen to him.  The film suggests that the music business was a cut-throat world, in which talent went unrecognized and agents only promoted the tried and tested, rather than the experimental.  This is brought out in a significant exchange where Llewyn travels to Chicago, only to be rebuffed by the seedy-looking Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham).  The film is full of significant moments and quirky casting: I particularly admired the casting of Justin Timberlake as Jim, another would-be folk musician who tries to change his name to guarantee success, but ends up on the musical scrapheap, just like Llewyn.  Deliberately shot in low-key color, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS befits repeated viewings, in order to make sense of its multi-leveled structure.  Potentially a contemporary classic.",1391731200,6,1873,5.128289473684211
6093655,5,B00GMV8KGW,"Let me cut to the chase first. With Inside Llewyn Davis, we are being given a version--just one version--of Llewyn Davis's story. A couple of people noted that the ending was not QUITE like the opening--Dylan is on stage, the cat doesn't escape, etc.--which cues another version of the story (in our imaginations). The Cohen brothers know a fundamental fact about folk music, folk tales, any folk performance--that each performance is unique, subject to the interplay of performer and audience, a fundamental aspect of what has been called ""performance theory"" in academic folkore studies. In the late-ninteenth century Francis James Childs's published his monumental collection of Anglo-American traditional ballads, giving variant versions for nearly every ballad from various performances and texts. By 1961, Child's collection (generally referred to as ""Child ballads"") would have been known to every folk singer in America, England, and elsewhere, and those singers were fully aware of the contingent nature of folksong performance. So we've been given the Coen Brothers's version of Inside Llewyn Davis, with a clear hint that there are other versions possible. It's almost as though they've invited us to offer those versions.

When I saw Inside Llewyn David for the first time, I was relieved that the Coens did not try to present a blow-by-blow history of the 1950s-60s folk song revival, but kept their focus on Davis's story. Oscar Isaac was actually credible--no. much MORE than credible--as a professional folk singer trying to make it in a world where traditional balladry was about over as a popular music genre. (in only 4 more years, Dylan would go electric at Newport.) Isaac's performance is simply the finest by any actor this year.
I saw the movie twice, just to make sure that the scenes at the beginning and end were in fact different, and that the performances were as brilliant as I first imagined. If anything, the performances were even more enjoyable. No wonder this film was credited for having saved the Cannes film festival this year after the festival's dismal opening days.

The movie does have some apparent references to real people, e.g., Mose Asch, Albert Grossman, the Clancy Brothers, Jean Ritchie. But this isn't what makes the movie feel authentic. For this you have to credit the wonderful ensemble of actors, and the Coen brothers. I have no doubts that Inside Llewyn David will be seen in future years as a true masterpiece.",1391644800,5,2468,5.121588089330025
6093656,5,B00GMV8KGW,"The Coen brothers have created another powerful masterpiece in their latest, Inside Llewyn Davis. Sad, funny and impeccably designed, this is a truly great film, even further elevated by the wonderful musical performances (buy the soundtrack too!).",1391558400,13,248,5.72972972972973
6093657,4,B00GMV8KGW,"We're accustomed to seeing the super-fortunate lives of celebrities.  Inside Llewyn Davis takes us inside the life of a struggling artist, and it isn't pretty. The film reminds us that for every Bob Dylan who makes it big, there is a world full of Llewyn Davis's who despite talent, passion and effort, can't seem to catch a break and gives up on their dreams.

Llewyn is a folk singer who is clearly a talented artist.  We know this from the opening scene where he gives a moving performance that is warmly received by a cafe audience.  His heart is in the right place; he means well and tries to do the right thing.  And yet the universe seems to conspire against him.  The gatekeepers of the music business are blind to his talent and interested only in money.  The people he trusts betray him.  The people he needs are disinterested or unavailable.  No one seems to understand him.  And anything that can go wrong in his life does.

Llewyn tries to deal with the adversity, but as things go wrong for him, and as he confronts the reality of how much of his soul he would have to sell to succeed, his bitterness and resentment build, and it seems he can't help but alienate and anger those close to him and those who could help him. And so he sinks into an angry, self-sabotaging cycle.  It's painful to watch.  In the end, he is literally beaten down.

So why make a film about a failing artist who catches every bad break and seems to make things worse for himself?  Because it is a Coen brothers film.  The scenes are gritty but hauntingly beautiful.  The characters are finely drawn and larger than life.  And the dialogue and performances are pitch perfect.  In short, expect to be moved, if not inspired.

The storyline makes a point to show us how close Llewyn is to breaking out.  The tantalizing prospect of success hovers throughout the film.  He could have had big royalties from his performance in a hit song; he could have been part of Peter, Paul & Mary; he could have been discovered like Dylan. But somehow he is always in the wrong place at the wrong time making the wrong choice.  It makes his self-sabotaging character feel that much more tragic.

Don't expect a happy ending.  In fact, the film ends as it began, which I suppose is the filmmaker's device of showing us the talented artist going nowhere and getting beaten down by the struggle.  But at least we are all better off for having gone along for the ride.",1391472000,4,2438,4.484090909090909

This film isn't hard to figure. It is set in Greenwich Village during the week prior to Bob Dylan's arrival. Dylan remains among the most revered talents to come out of the Village, and a great number of people have a vivid idea of what was going on in lower Manhattan after Dylan took center stage. But it was a crowded lot before he got there, and most were carrying on the same way folkies had been doing for a number of years. Most were singing the songs people had been singing for the past 100 years and putting very little originality into it. Llewyn Davis fits the mold. The superstar from Minnesota changed all that. Sort of the same way a couple of Minnesota brothers added a new twist to independent filmmaking a few decades later.

The music in this one is good but not as good as in O Brother Where Art Thou. The acting is very good and the movie is OK but again if you aren't a Coen Brothers fan you may not totally get into it.

6093660,3,B00GMV8KGW,"The Coen brothers have made plenty of notable movies, including ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", and ""No Country for Old Men"". Their latest film, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", has also been receiving great praise. It has already been nominated for numerous awards, with nods from The Oscars and Golden Globes. Boasting a fantastic cast, it definitely looked like an interesting watch.

Oscar Isaac stars as Llewyn Davis, a young folk-singer navigating his way through the Greenwich Village music scene of 1961. Against heavy obstacles, some of them of his own making, we follow his struggle to make it as a musician. Only spanning a week in his life, the movie falls a bit short.

It has its fair share of awesome songs, but I never really connected with the characters. Llewyn isn't exactly a likeable guy, and it's hard to root for him on his journey. The cinematography and music may be strong, but it doesn't make up for the thin story that never really gets going. Rated R for language, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" doesn't quite live up to the hype.",1391212800,,1037,4.787709497206704
6093661,2,B00GMV8KGW,"First of all I'm pretty tired of people ""after the fact"" claiming that this movie is completely fiction and we shouldn't assume that the Coen's ever meant it to be indicative of the 1960s Greenwich Village folk music scene or of Dave Van Ronk.  If that's the case then why did they bother to pepper the movie so full of direct references to both?
Why did they call the club the Gaslight Cafe?
Why did they use the actual names of a singing duet - Jim and Jean?
Why did they not even bother to change the last name of the owner of the Gate of Horn?  Albert Grossman was the original owner.
Why did they use the exact anecdote of Grossman asking Dave Van Ronk if he wanted to be in the new MMF trio he was putting together (ultimately peter, Paul and Mary)?
Why did they use use the exact cover of Van Ronk's album ""Inside Dave Van Ronk"" as the cover for Davis's album ""Inside Llewyn Davis?
You can't make that many (and more actually) direct references to a specific scene and people and then later claim ""Oh... but it's all supposed to be fiction.""  NONSENSE!

But, for the sake of argument let's completely forget that Llewyn Davis is not Dave Van Ronk. Let's forget that there are historical inaccuracies in the scenery and other parts of the film (the Gaslight was tiny, not the cavernous club in the film, there was no alley behind that cafe, I'm somewhat doubtful that Davis would have been playing a 1928 or 1929 Gibson L-1 that looked so clean, when Llewyn is playing guitar in the car on the way to Chicago, he's using a Shubb capo. The film takes place in 1961; Shubb capos weren't available until 1980, while Llewyn is making a payphone call on the elevated subway platform (Woodside/61st Street), a modern 7 train pulls into the station on the opposite track, despite being set in 1961, Llewyn passes a poster for Disney's ""The Incredible Journey"" which was released in 1963, there is a Lava Lamp shown in one scene. The Lava Lamp wasn't invented until 1963 and wasn't available for purchase until 1965) let's forget everything and just approach this as a complete work of fiction.

Plot: The story doesn't seem to go anywhere. The main character tries to find his way in the folk music scene but doesn't have much success, nor does he seem to put anything resembling a passionate effort into it. He goes through some moves and attempts a few things, but they seem half-hearted. Maybe he's just completely discouraged but he doesn't seem to invoke much sympathy in his attempts. Things just seem to happen to him and the people around him, oft-times for inexplicable reasons. Which may be due to...

Characters and their development or lack thereof: There just doesn't seem to be anyone likeable in this movie. Llewyn Davis is just not a very likeable character. He's belligerent to the point of being hostile, self-absorbed, seemingly uncaring about the people around him, even his fellow performers. And yet he sings beautiful folk ballads about royalty and people and you wonder how the hell is he connecting to these songs when he can't seem to connect to actual humans? Now maybe that's supposed to be part of his ""mystery"" but I just find it confusing. There is no joy in Llewyn Davis' life, and so it's hard to really care about him. In fact it's hard to care about anyone, they're all pretty self-absorbed and unlikeable.

Jean (Carey Mulligan) is another mystery. We know nothing about her other than she had a brief affair with Llewyn and hates him for it, is married to Jim (whom she says she cares about), but there's no character here... who is she, what does she think, where is she going? There's nothing to really like or dislike about her - she's just there.

Jim (Justin Timberlake) is a cipher. Who is he and what does he want? He floats in and out, sings a song, gets a record deal for a commercial ""folk"" song he wrote (we have no idea how that came about other than to surmise that a John Hammond Sr-like figure had something to do with it)... he's a clean-cut nice guy but why should we care? He seems completely oblivious to what's going on around him.

Troy Nelson (Stark Sands) may be the only likeable character in the film because he seems to actually like the people around him. But he's depicted as a Forrest Gump-like character, so even his likeability needs to be tempered.

Jazz man Roland Turner (John Goodman) is a junkie who dislikes everything except for the really bad beat poetry that his ""valet"" Johnny Five (Garret Hedlund) spouts out. It's a relief when he's finally out of the film.

Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), a not-even thinly disguised Albert Grossman, owner of the Gate of Horn club in Chicago, has nothing to make anyone like him... but then neither did Albert Grossman. He's only in it for the money and that's just the way it was.

Pappi Corsicato (Max Casella), the owner of the Gaslight Cafe, is thoroughly sleazy and only books women who sleep with him.

Al Cody (Adam Driver) is another folk singer who Llewyn crashes with and he might be a likeable soul, but he's another nonentity.

None of these or the other characters ever really develop a persona other than their surface personalities that just seem to be people you really wouldn't want to hang around with.

Music: Some of the songs are quite nice, but what seems to be missing a lot of the time is the joy and passion that one would expect from this music and this time. Many of the songs are rather syrupy versions of songs that originally had more of an edge to them.

In all fairness the film probably does a relatively decent job in depicting the transition from people singing actual folk songs to the singer-songwriter school of folk music that Dylan, Paxton, Neil, Ochs, Anderson and others would soon usher in. But unlike ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", or other Coen Brothers films there's really nothing about ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" that's going to make you want to go back and see it over and over again.

Buy Dave Van Ronk and Elijah Wald's ""The Mayor Of MacDougal Street"" , get some of Dave's albums (especially the new Smithsonian release Down in Washington Square) and have yourself a really good time!",1391126400,7,6174,4.588021778584392
6093662,4,B00GMV8KGW,"Because this reviewer's January 21, 2011 review explaining N.W. Refn's ""Valhalla Rising"" has generated many positive responses, with over 90% of respondents describing that review as helpful, here is the same former police detective's interpretation of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"":

THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERS

To their credit, if the Coen brothers made ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" with the intention of creating a film full of hidden meanings and subtle symbolism, then they managed to conceal all of those meanings and symbols extremely well. I will be the first to say that ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" did not make a lot of sense to me at the time I saw it. Admittedly, I don't know who or what Llewyn Davis is/was supposed to be.

What I do know is that the Coens appear to be quite fond of allegory and symbolism. I also know they are huge fans of ""The Odyssey"" (as seen in one of their best films ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""). So, I did a bit of research online, and this is what I came up with. Of course, as with the review I wrote for ""Valhalla Rising,"" I'm not entirely sure if any of what I have written below is, in fact, what the Coens wanted to convey with their film. Likely, I'm way, way off base. But here are my off-base thoughts anyway, for what they're worth....

First of all, I wondered about this one thing a lot: Why did the filmmakers made such a point of telling their audience that ""Ulysses"" (a.k.a. ""Odysseus"") was the name of the marmalade cat that Llewyn Davis spent much of the film chasing down?

I also started thinking more and more about the shadowy man in the wide-brimmed hat, who beat up Llewyn Davis outside of the Gaslight Club at the beginning of the film (and again at the end, replayed), and why the filmmakers didn't want to show the audience his face.

This will probably sound rather silly, but the more I thought about it, the more I imagined ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" to be perhaps yet another Coen brothers' retelling of ""The Odyssey"" by Homer, but this time the story was told from the perspective of one of the Suitors of Penelope.

Perhaps the filmmakers, once again working within the context of Homer's Odyssey, intended for the Llewyn Davis character to represent one of those false-hearted suitors. But in this case, the ""mistress"" that Davis wanted to woo and win over was the ""spirit"" (muse?) of that particular artistic movement circa 1961, a movement that many of the people who grew up during those years still recall with approbative phrases, such as ""defined an era"" and ""voice of a generation.""

And, as it was in Homer's Odyssey, suitor Llewyn Davis was a man wooing with a false heart. At various times, I got the strong impression that Davis's heart just wasn't in it anymore, not since the death of his friend and collaborator Mike Timlin.

At one point towards the middle of the film, when Davis got angry during a performance of ""Fare Thee Well"" at the Gorfeins' dinner party, he shouted at them something like: ""This is what I do for a living! This is what I do to pay the bills!""

When I recalled that scene, I thought the filmmakers might have been trying to convey that the part of him that had loved folk music died when his collaborator Mike Timlin died. Or maybe Mike Timlin himself was in the end only a symbol, and in that sense he was supposed to be the actual part of Llewyn Davis that had loved folk music, and that part of Davis was now dead.

I started considering that if a certain place and time and group of people can be said to possess a certain ""spirit"" or ""embodiment"" that directs its artistic development - its ""muse,"" in other words - (and I'm talking about the SoHo neighborhood during the early 1960s, where Bob Dylan and his contemporaries got their start) then maybe Llewyn Davis's failure to become a legendary folk-singer was intended to be seen as that particular artistic movement (or its muse or Grecian-esque spirit) rejecting his advances. The audience gets to see Davis's repeated attempts to woo her, and her repeated rejections, just as Penelope rejected all of her false suitors.

So, after Davis gets rejected by that artistic movement - because of his heart not being in it, and because of how he mocked the hammered dulcimer-playing folk singer near the end, shouting at her: ""I HATE FOLK MUSIC!!!"" - I imagined that maybe Odysseus, the man himself, at last showed up (kind of), and he rid his Penelope of that false Suitor, Davis. But instead of killing him, as was done in Homer's Odyssey, this version of Odysseus merely beat Davis up in order to express his condemnation of him.

Other little clues:

1) Davis brings the wrong marmalade cat back to the Gorfeins, instead of the real ""Ulysses"" cat. Maybe it's another indicator of (or metaphor for) Davis's own false-hearted suitorhood?

2) Llewyn Davis went to The Gate of Horn in Chicago (a real place, of course). In the theater, I remember thinking, ""That's an unusual name for a venue. I wonder if it has any significance?"" Yes, as it turns out. Unfortunately, Amazon doesn't allow the insertion of links to Wikipedia, so you'll just have to Google the article called ""Gates of horn and ivory"" and read about how Homer's Odyssey refers to these gates.

So, if the ""gate of horn"" has a particular significance in the oldest examples of Greek literature, then those dreams which do not pass through the gate of horn are supposedly false dreams.

I then considered that Davis, after he's completed his long ""odyssey"" from NYC to Chicago, in a way finds out that he's not the real Odysseus. Instead, he's just a suitor trying to woo, and like the suitors in Homer's Odyssey, his character views a lucrative, career-defining record deal with Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham's character) as merely a prize to be won, a feather in his cap, but in truth there is no actual love (for the art of 1960s folk music) in Llewyn Davis's heart.

As stated in the Wikipedia article above, Penelope in the real ""The Odyssey"" feels that her dream suggesting that Odysseus will return to her is not a true prediction of the future; she feels that her dream of her husband did not pass through the symbolic ""gate of horn."" Similarly, Llewyn Davis fails his audition with Grossman at The Gate of Horn club. Did the Coen brothers use this scene to convey the idea that Davis is not the real Odysseus coming home? He failed to pass through the Gate of Horn; therefore, Davis's vision of himself, as a folk-singer of the talent and the caliber that could impress Grossman and make it big, is a false vision.

3) Llewyn Davis drives past the exit for Akron on the way back from Chicago to NYC. Maybe that's supposed to be telling the audience - again, in a different way - that Davis is not the real Odysseus. According to the story, Davis's son (a stand-in for Telemachus?) and his son's mother are both waiting for him in Akron, OH. I guess placing them in Ithaca, NY would've made it too obvious?

""Akron"" is a Greek word meaning ""high place."" Did the Coens intend for this to mean that Davis passed up the chance (or perhaps lacked the strength of character) to climb out of the ""depths"" of his situation, and ascend to that ""high place"" where his son and his son's mother were waiting for him, in a way that could be seen as analogous to Telemachus and Penelope waiting for Ulysses to return to Ithaca? I don't know, honestly.

As I stated at the beginning of this review, I don't know if any of the above conjectures about the film are accurate or not. I just kind of used the Coen brothers' other film ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" as a shaky starting point for what the filmmakers might have been trying to convey, and went from there.

UPDATED: My SO corrected what I wrote above, that Davis's son and the mother of his son were ""waiting for"" him in Akron. She pointed out that the scene in which the abortion doctor informs Davis that his former paramour, without bothering to say so much as a word to Davis, decided instead to carry her pregnancy to term and move to Akron with her newborn son, that this action plainly shows that mother and son were not in fact ""waiting for"" Davis, that she only wanted Davis out of her life, and indeed she would have wanted nothing to do with him even if he had showed up on her doorstep.",1390867200,4,8261,4.560053981106613

6093664,5,B00GMV8KGW,"(This review is for the theatrical release.)

I've read a lot of commentary about Inside Llewyn Davis failing to deliver a pay-off.  Oddly, this was one of the aspects of the film I enjoyed the most.  It is devoid of the glamour and artifice of an uplifting underdog story; Llewyn's story begins and ends in the same alley, no redemption found, his only prize the blood on his lips.  Throughout the film, there were many moments I found myself wishing Llewyn would just say, or just do, this instead of that, find a way to overcome his weaknesses and flaws.  But he always says, or does, exactly as Llewyn would do.

This is what I find so refreshing about the film, the screenplay driving it and the performances delivering it.  The characters on-screen act with the same perplexing unpredictability as we all do.  They never know just what to say to each other.  They talk at each other rather than to each other.  They are weak, and often unlikeable, and often uncomfortably vulnerable.  Our expectations as an audience, sculpted by decades of formulaic Joseph Campbell-driven story arcs, are of no consequence here.

I think our desire for packages with bows on them stems from our yearning for life to follow suit.  But it doesn't, does it?  We are all little islands of feeling trying desperately and confusedly to express some sort of identity and to find a voice that will connect us to others.

I think it is essential to the film that we don't know the details of Llewyn's story.  His relationship with Jean, his estrangement from his father, the loss of his musical partner; these things are vague hints, and as such, we can't take sides.  We can't make Llewyn a hero or a villain.  And so we must perceive him only as a man.  A man who is somewhat pretentious, who maybe only knows how to express himself through an art form both nostalgic and exploited, a man who is selfish and yet heartbreakingly exposed.

The screenplay, the performances, the cinematography, and the sound direction are all superb.  It is an earnest film.  It tells a truer story than most.",1390176000,408,2074,4.65564738292011
6093665,3,B00GMV8KGW,"At the end of the credits is an image declaring the film ""Kosher for Passover"". Now, the Cohanim (plural of Cohen) are the priestly family of the Jewish people, members of the Tribe of Levi. The books of Exodus and Leviticus describe the responsibilities of the Cohanim, which include the Temple service and blessing of the people. What I think the Coen Bro's are up to? Well, anyone can see that they have an acutely sardonic sense of humor. So--Comparing the career of Llewyn Davis and Bob Dylan, are there any New Testament parables that spring to mind? Well, at the beginning of the film, we see Llewyn Davis cast into the outer darkness, where he is left weeping and gnashing his teeth, and at the end of the film we see the arrival, in the Gaslight Cafe, of the Anointed One (singing ""Fare thee well"" to the Old Folk Laws)--(before we see Llewyn left gnashing his teeth, again). A sower obviously went forth sowing seed, and some fell on barren ground and yielded naught, and some on fertile ground and yielded one hundred fold. And there is another example, consider the judgments that Llewyn passes against his fellow artists--(""4 Micks and Grandma Moses""), and the somewhat absolute judgement rendered upon him by Bud Grossman. Judge not, indeed. And certainly, peace was not brung, but a sword instead, for the members of his household, i.e. his sister, became his enemy, and even the friends that fed him and sheltered him endured his wrath. He sure did kick the dust from his heels when he fled the Village to seek the Gate of Horn. No pearls before swine for him. Just ask the Gorfeins.

But, other than the shoehorning of the Greenwich folk scene into Biblical fables, there is no story structure, no plot, no picaresque. Just a sequence of set pieces and performances. The set pieces are largely lifted from Dave Van Ronk's biography, but Dave Van Ronk was a charming and entertaining performer, well loved by everyone who knew him, and far far from the obnoxious, socially toxic loser portrayed by Llewyn Davis. And--What is up with Ulysses the cat? And--Why does Jean hate Llewyn so? Well, that becomes obvious as the story unfolds, but these questions are all connected by the most desultory scenarios.

Then there are the performances. Troy Nelson's rendition of Tom Paxton's That was the Last Thing on My Mind was truly moving, and 500 Miles, was sweetly done. But Llewyn Davis seems somewhat oddly out of place among this milieu-he's too polished, he tries to hard, he doesn't seem to be having any fun. I can see why Bud Grossman stated he could see no money there, and why he should seek a partner, just as I could understand his claim that Troy Nelson had a special gift for connecting with audiences. But the whole point of the film is that many are called but few are chosen. In Greek mythology, mortals displaying Hubris offended the Gods. Hubris is sometimes characterized as pompous inflation, but the Greeks regarded it as an expression of irreverence. Llewyn Davis can gnash his teeth and wail all he wants. He had an invitation to the wedding, and he showed up without a wedding garment. If he truly knew his folk traditions, he would have known how the rest of the story goes. The deepest irony of the story is revealed at the moment when Llewyn is getting smacked down in an alley--and in that moment, Dylan is getting discovered by a critic from the NY Times who would go on to write a positive review of Dylan's performance. Llewyn, with his honey'd voice and proficient finger picking, is the anti-Dylan. The Coen's go a long long way to encourage you to look closely not at Llewyn, but at Dylan, and wonder at the sheer mystery of the magnitude of his artistic achievement. Llewyn, BTW is Welsh for 'shining leader' and Dylan is Welsh for 'son of the sea'. There is a strange inverted harmony in that fact.

I've always appreciated Dave Van Ronk, but there is a story in Chonicles 1 that sheds a little light. When Dylan began working with John Hammond, around the time of his first album, Hammond was getting ready to re-release the original recordings of Robert Johnson on Columbia, and he gave Dylan a sample of the LP in a white generic sleeve. The album had not been released yet. And he rushed over to Dave Van Ronk's place to listen to it with him. Van Ronk was like a mentor and and older brother. And Van Ronk listened, and proceeded to identify, itemize, and list every influence on each song, how he clearly got this element from this prior artist, and this element from that blues influence, the way an entomologist would dissect a newly discovered insect. But what Dylan heard was this--the power of Johnson to impact his audience, and Dylan wanted that too--the ability to connect with, and move, the listener. Van Ronk wanted to build a Taxonomic tree, but Dylan wanted to capture lightning. And there, in a nutshell, is the difference between adherence and innovation, between the study of history, and the making of history. Between the seismograph, and the lightning rod.",1390003200,16,5027,4.6843891402714934
