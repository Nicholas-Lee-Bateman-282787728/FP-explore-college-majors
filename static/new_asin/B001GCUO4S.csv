3598653,3,B001GCUO4S,"I really enjoy the Final Destination series. The only reason I'm not giving this 5 stars is because the plot is great but is a little too predictable considering every movie basically has the same plot ""Leading Guy/Girl have a death premonition/vision, Everyone dies in some particular order,..and so ob. Of course each move has very  cool effects and are enjoyable after multiple viewings!
As for Amazon I'd give my Prime Membership 5 Stars!  I Love the quality of the movies, the music & the rest of the perks. Oh & the Customer Service is top notch & very professional!

3598679,4,B001GCUO4S,"Not only is it really confusing that the Final Destination 4 in the series is just simply called 'The Final Destination', but there is also 2 different 3D releases that can also be hard to distinguish.

A lot of used copies are still selling the older, first 3D release that uses the old 3D anaglyph technology with red and cyan glasses.

- If the blu-ray cover lenticular slip says ""includes 2D version"", and contains two separate discs for 3D and 2D, includes red/cyan paper glasses, you have the cheap anaglyph version.
- The new release that uses REAL 3D with Active/Passive glasses is just a single disc that contains 3D and 2D together.
- You can also check the back of the case and it should say 'in Full HD Blu-ray 3D' and 'Compatible 3D glasses'

The Final Destination series are actually engaging, and that is why there are so many of them like Fast & The Furious series. It is guilty pleasure. Sometimes you just want to shut off your brain and see something ridiculous.

Many seem to not like this one in the series the most, and it has pretty bad reviews, so I really was not expecting much.

The acting and behavior in this film is extremely laughable... I mean, it REALLY is bad... The acting in Final Destination 5 is Oscar worthy compared to this one. I mean, this film has it all to stoop really low on the bottom meter level... this is definitely not for kids... besides the over-the-top violence, it has a totally unnecessary pornographic sex scene and racism (Blacks and Asians)

This film probably made me flinch the most out of any 3D movies I've seen. A lot of flinching moments have to do with nails and pieces flying at you... it's not the pleasurable 3D effects where you have time to reach out and grab things; it's coming at you so fast that it makes you flinch.

This movie actually feels like a TV comedy episode... it's really rushed; it goes by pretty fast, but at the same time, it feels like not much happened.  Final Destination 5 actually feels like a solid theatrical movie with better acting, Tom Cruise look-alike, and way better build-up suspense.

I bought this mainly for the 3D, and as a collector of 3D films, I don't regret owning it. The ending being done in X-ray CG was actually underwhelming and disappointing... they should have just showed it raw for more shocking impact... that would have been a traumatic lasting sight to see. The film still has its moments. Final Destination 4 definitely made me flinch more than the 5th one; however, the 5th one is easily a better movie.",1446854400,6,2529,4.552863436123348

3598715,5,B001GCUO4S,"Let me begin by saying I am not a huge fan of the horror genre.
I was compelled to give it a chance because the antagonist is Death himself- There is definitely hints of a 'conscious' entity at work, apparently in dire need of entertainment from not just mass death - he toys with the mind of the main protagonist, making a game out of the whole ordeal by throwing hints his way.

Unlike most horror films the antagonist cannot be killed, so they have to find another way to stay alive (More than that I will not say because I don't want to spoil it)

It's got enough comic relief to ease the tension a little, making them less like real people and more like cartoons, so you might find yourself more amused than horrified (Especially if you like the ""Superjail"" series)",1420675200,,770,4.3776223776223775

Number 1 was the best of them all; number 2 at least had Ali Lautner in it, although had a weak story; number 3 had the roller coaster and number 5 pulled all together. Number 4 (The Final Destination) is meaningless and bad. Why?  First off, the ""U.S' in this movie is actually Florida (thus so fitting for racing) as opposed to Vancover-ized version of the U.S.as in the other 4 movies. You have absolutely no connection with any of the characters, either because they just are all awful at their craft, or just because you have no empathy for them (the 4 leads are just stiff in their roles).The story is too convoluted in that it does not follow the structure of how premonitions and death work as opposed to the other 4 installments. It is the one movie that is left out there on its own, with no point of reference to the original movie in any way shape or form (the other 3 touch on Flight 180, or have Tony Todd in them to remind us).
I actually sat through this movie checking the remaining time left on my blu-ray player as to how much more of this I had to endure.
DO NOT use this as a starting off point for the franchise as it will disappoint. Buy the first one and then other 3 as they all connect. This is a ""stand alone"" movie whihc adds nothing to the franchise.",1376956800,,1539,4.2457337883959045

3598826,3,B001GCUO4S,"This is about the 2-D Blu-ray (I'm not enamored with 3-D as a concept). The Blu-ray transfer is excellent as is the audio. Technically it's a well executed Blu-ray and for that I'd give it five stars.

This was touted as the *last* ""Final Destination"" (aka FD4) but that means nothing for a film franchise that may still be profitable and so there's a FD5 following this one. It's plenty ""scary"" in terms of startling events. The concept, however, is growing stale with essentially the same plot: trying to determine the sequence in which people will die and outwit Death before it claims the last one or two survivors. Just change the circumstances of the original vision containing the mass casualty event, the names of the characters, and the manner of their horrific deaths. Watching these in sequence starts to get boring after FD2. By comparison, I've watched Kurosawa's ""Yojimbo"" and Sergio Leone's ""Fistful of Dollars"" back-to-back and not been bored by it (Leone cloned Yojimbo nearly scene by scene and was successfully sued). Nor have I been bored watching the ""Resident Evil"" series (there's at least a varying story line with continuity through them). Giving this three stars, not for technical aspects of the Blu-ray, but for the film itself. I've got FD5 (bought it about the same time as FD4) and will very likely pass on any more from this franchise unless there's a radical departure from the plot ""formula"" that's been used for five films now.",1366156800,,1462,4.871485943775101

The included glasses worked wonders and if you have an advanced pair of glasses then you know as well as I do that this film was released properly and the color isn't too washed out for anaglyph. Also the image does stick out in your face when your tv is properly adjusted. Enjoyed this dvd very much and have it in dvd and Blu Ray.

3598843,4,B001GCUO4S,"The Final Destination series is really only about one simple formula: Guy/Girl has a premonition of a disaster, gets a bunch of his friends and some other people to safety, then the disaster happens and everyone dies except them. Cue Death, who steps in to finish the job, since those people were supposed to die then and didn't, and Death does not like that one bit. Death then goes around one-by-one and sets up catastrophic and hidden ""accidents"" for each person that survived.

Death is clearly a sadist, since he could just, like, give them an aneurism or something, but instead he tries much more painful and sadistic methods to get his work done. So here we are, at the fourth movie, after three films of a whole lot of teenagers dying in freak accidents. For those who want more, here you go.

Really, this one isn't exactly terrible and the death scenes do show a little originality, but the previous three really get the job done much better. Death #1, which, if I remember correctly, involves a tow truck and someone being set on fire, isn't all that great. There's very little suspense, as it all happens very quickly, and you never get that suspense you really want from the scenes in which you know someone's going to bite it somehow. The first death scene is a little over the top, and isn't constructed with much suspense. He's there, then he dies with a little help from Death, but not a lot. There's nothing special about the character himself, and the death is over quickly and isn't all that exciting.

The second one is a bit of a curveball, since the whole time you're expecting something else to kill the character, but then she randomly dies from something completely different. That ""something"" happens to be a goddamned stone, but whatever. It's not very good, particularly since the character in question dies immediately and without knowing what hit her. It kind of leaves you disappointed at how little the scene really adds up to.

Number three is probably the weakest in the whole series. It doesn't work on any level at all. I can stand a lack of realism for stuff like this, but only to a point, since it's pretty hard to die from being in a damned swimming pool. Somehow, the pressure when draining the pool is on the level of a singularity, and causes the character's intestines to be ripped from his...uh...underside. It's really stupid, honestly, and a total throwaway.

Then we've got the rest of them. Again, nothing special for any of them. Often, like the others, they're over far too quickly, with no room for suspense, and it's pretty clear they went for quantity over quality here. There are more deaths here than any other FD film, but they're also far shorter and less carefully constructed. One after another, they inevitably go down, until the final climax when the day is supposedly saved (everyone knows by now it never is and Death doesn't just give up because you're determined enough to avoid it--even Clear Rivers learned that the hard way, and she was voluntarily placed in a padded cell to keep herself safe, and she still ended up dying early), and then the remaining characters all die in a spectacular fashion. Really, the climax of this movie is the best part. It's big, explosive, violent, and exciting. It loses a few points for avoidably poor realism (one does not bleed out their mouth from having their foot crushed), but at least it's hectic, and then the ending was supposed to conclude the series...until they made a fifth one. But it still works.

This is probably the worst FD movie thanks to too many deaths with too little suspense involved in them. I've heard some people complain about the opening disaster, but I didn't have a problem with it, I just had a problem with everything after it.

So, let's check off the things that really matter to the majority of us!

Level of gore: 7/10. The stuff that's implied to be extra horrific is censored, but it's still bloody and gory. It gets the job done well enough.

Creativity in kills: 3/10. No good. Very little suspense, and it's nothing all that exciting. It gets a couple points for the kills at the very end with the main characters, which was nicely done...they die twice.

Character variety: 1/10. Yuck. Cardboard cutout stereotypes all around, with not one single person we should care about. Kind of a shame, really, considering the previous FDs had characters we gave a damn about. There isn't a single one here that is worth noting, though, including our main character, who is just a kid with no discernible traits worth mentioning. He's a generic good guy who has the premonition, and that's about all we care about from then on.

Overall satsisfaction: 6/10. Again, it's not awful, and at least the kills are gory, but the suspense is seriously missing. Final Destination 2 this certainly isn't. Some say FD 3 was the worst one, but I have to disagree. This one shows even less creativity.

Other problems: Sorry kids, no Tony Todd this time around. A real shame, since he's a staple of FD, and the one single recurring character up to this point. Even the one person who survives into the second film, Clear Rivers, ended up biting it in that one, to some people's dismay, as they wanted her to be a recurring character, too. I mean, if anyone could survive, she could...but no one can survive, so that's sort of a moot point. She went up against Death itself, for Christ's sake. How did she expect to win? But yeah, no Tony Todd. Lame.",1325635200,,5474,4.65527950310559

There is quite a blood fest in this one .They took surprise element of death away by showing vision even before the creative way death takes place to claim a body .If director had avoided that it could be great suspense. May be they don`t want to categorize themselves as horror genera. So visions were there.
Story wise actually there is none what so ever,Bunch of people saved in accident and now death following them but 3D wise especially ""LAST 20 MINUTES "" don`t miss them. Its where movies really takes off in 3D .There are many Out of screen and blood gushing effects throughout the movie.

if you want to chose one out of two final destination movies in 3D .i prefer Final destination5 3D over this one.

3598856,5,B001GCUO4S,"This review is confined mainly the the 3D effects,audio and video quality, and not to the movie itself.
Yes, the film will not appeal to many people due to its gory, bloody and disgusting nature. However, this blu ray edition is SIMPLY OUTSTANDING!!!
It appears that this movie was shot with the same 3D technology as that used for AVATAR. I don't know if this is true or not, but this movie simply pours out the best of 3D effects in every single bit! Almost every 5 min, something will pop out (truly, POP OUT!) of the screen, to satisfy your 3D cravings. In the scenes without 'pop-out' effects, the 3d is still brilliant. You can sense great depth in the frame. Try the opening scene in the stadium. You will literally feel the height, depth and layers of the stadium seats. The blu ray video quality is outstanding with breathtaking clarity and sharpness. Color saturation, contrast and overall quality of the HD transfer is nothing but best in every single scene.
Having owned many blu ray 3Ds, I can definitlety say that this blu ray 3D is THE Demo disc for your 3dtv system! This is almost equivalent to the Disney PIXAR Toy story 3 3D in terms of Full HD 3D presentation. Yeah, there is gore (and a lot of it), but if you are trying to see the limits of your 3D system, stop here. The audio is mind blowing, that can put you right in the middle of the scene. Simply brilliant by all means!
This disc includes the 2D version of the movie too, and for those who are wondering, this newer version of the blu ray is designed for today's 3D TVs. This blu ray does not have the red-blu 3D glasses. You can use it with your active (shutter) glasses (for those who have either Samsung or Sony). For one disc, the price is bit high (considering that you can get Disney's 4 disc sets in the same price range), but the 3D HD quality compensates for it.",1325116800,5,1850,4.3652173913043475

3598864,3,B001GCUO4S,"I saw this back in 2009 it was tense fun and funny. I enjoyed every minute of it except a few things. The ACTING was a huge letdown and sure the FD movies have never been known for high caliber acting but still this was a letdown.

The 2 girl characters were extremely grating everytime they talked horrible actors and just flat out annoying. The main character was very good looking but bland not that interesting to say the least. The stereotypical jerk guy was very cute and someone I was rooting to die the whole time. Mikael Williamson I think thats his name anyways was pretty interesting as a former alcoholic who had lost his family due to an accident. Was not pleased with what happened to him that is all I will say. It was cruel extremely fast and just plain cold.

The deaths ranged from meh to pretty good won't say which or whose deaths in case someone has still not seen this movie.

The 3d was awesome for the most part but after a while it got boring with stuff popping out every few minutes. After a while it became predictable. The ending however I did not see coming and thought it was a great twist. Will not give it away but suffice it to say you should never think for one minute that you are SAFE in a FD movie. Overall a good entry to the franchise a great opening sequence at a race track some good acting some horrible and a clever twist at the end I did not see coming. This is not by no means the BEST FD not by a long shot to me the 2nd one was the best so far.

There, a group of obnoxiously moronic, attractive, foul-mouthed college kids are the focus of a catastrophe about to happen. One of the boys has a premonition of a disaster, which begins as a multi-car mashup culminating with vehicles and various auto parts and even the stadium itself becoming shrapnel missiles attacking spectators.

In a blink, everything's back to normal the way it was just prior to the accident. It was a vision but suddenly everything in the vision prior to the disaster is identical. From here, the film becomes a menagerie of how creative can we see someone die. And the basic question is this: do we control our fate, or does fate control us? Also, what happens if we thwart fate by intervening and saving a life? The answer in these films seems to be: fate gets really pissed! I've found these films to be a good mindless excursion, actually funnier than films that are made to be so. Maybe these films should be labeled Horror/comedies.

3598876,2,B001GCUO4S,"The Budget of this movie was $43 million according to IMDB (International movie data base) and that in my book is huge for an R-Rated movie especially a horror movie and what amazes me the most is that it made $186 million worldwide... how is that possible? This film wasn't even that good.... it is basically the biggest money maker worldwide in the Final Destination Series yet it In my opinion and I am sure I am not alone that this is the worst Final Destination of the series... but it was much better than Halloween II and I only say that movie because they both came out on the same day!

Plot: After a horrendous racing accident a group of survivors must fight death in an unoriginal and overdone story that lacks a lot of things..... Death after death the survivors soon realize that there is a pattern to the deaths according to where they were sitting the higher up you sat and survived the longer you would have to live!

Review: Boo.... I expected more from David R. Elis. Especially after his impressive ""Snakes on a Plane"" and this years decent creature feature ""Shark Night 3D"". The deaths were cool but looked completely fake especially the CGI blood that looks like it was made by a 9th grader while he was goofing off on a computer in a study hale for an hour!!! There is very few decent quality from this movie... the acting was okay.... the soundtrack was cool, and the death scenes were actually I have to say that I was only impressed by the creativity of a few death scenes the rest were unoriginal and stupid!

Acting: I only recognized Krista Allen (""Silent Venom"" and ""Feast"".) She is a decent actor and the rest were as well but none of them really stuck out above the rest!

Gore: lots of fake blood and gore, people get crushed and burned several times, a rock has a rock blast through her eye, decapitations, and impalements, and lots more... I just wish it looked more real but I do believe this is the goriest/bloodiest out of them all!

Bottom Line: I don't know about this movie.... it was pretty bad but I didn't absolutely hate it.... it was a little under decent all in all.... but it was too unoriginal and cheesy that deducted a point right there!

3598879,1,B001GCUO4S,"""Final Destination"" was a fun, creepy and unique horror film. The cast was good, including Devon Sawa, Ali Larter, Seann William Scott and Tony Todd. The second movie also had Larter, Todd and not much else and the thrid film had more of a no name cast. All three films involved death coming after the survivors of a certain terrible accident that occured in the beginning of the film.

""The Final Destination"" has a virtually no name cast and it all starts with a Nascar like event, where a terrible crash happens in a vision by Nick O'Bannon (Bobby Campo), so he alerts everyone he can about the crash and his girlfriend, a few friends and a couple of random cahracters manage to escape.

Of course the typical formula follows, death starts coming after everyone in the order they were supposed to die in the crash. The deaths are sadly not very cool, at least not compared to the others, some are just laugh out loud fake looking.

The acting is very, and I mean very subpar even for a horror film, again the cast isn't very noteworthy, on the plus side there are some attractive girls in the cast, especially Shantel VanSanten. The pacing isn't very good, there is some good humor, even a few laugh out loud moments, mostly at the death scenes. It's really not worth watching unless you have some friends and want to blast it with your own commentary. * out of 4 stars.",1317859200,3,1373,4.506024096385542

The other day I bought the collection of Final Destination 1-4 because I've only saw numbers 2 & 3 previously. I liked 1 and 2, 3 was ok at best, and 4 was unwatchable.

The first thing that struck me was the bizarre choice of cast. One of the main characters seemed to be a half-hearted attempt to create a comic relief. Its like putting an American Pie character into a horror film, just doesn't work. And the acting in general is horrible compared to previous films. It was horrible compared to any film really......

Second thing I noticed is that the beginning (as well as most of the movie) was pretty lame. I know this is personal opinion, but a race track in the middle of the day?

This brings be to my third gripe. Its obvious a race track was chosen so they could take advantage of the then newer 3d effects. When watching the movie in 2d, it was very evident the parts that were meant for 3d. These parts looked cheesy and out of place in the 2d version.

While previous movies relied on creative untimely (albeit) cheesy deaths, this one relied on... well... 3d effects. The deaths were uncreative and liked to exemplify tons of explosions.

Unfortunately one weakness in the whole series is plot holes. This time the main character has dreams that give him hints. Also, he has more than one ""premonition."" This really doesnt do something except take up extra time and give the movie the ability to show of the same explosion several times..... Seriously, they had to be running out of ideas.

In conclusion, this movie seemed to have been made to appeal to the rise of 3d technology in movies. If your watching this for plot, acting, or intelligence, save yourself the time.",1314316800,2,1696,4.504885993485342

immortalize criminals, drunks, and druggos through their movies and/or media newsreels

instead of passion and/or consensual acceptance between adults, which in those latter
instances are immoral for them because there is no violence to show, in all to please the
taste of moviegoers' weirdos without taking in consideration of the taste of family

A lot of out of screen effects in the first half of the movie which don't really work well with anaglyph but the second half of the movie kinda calmed down on wowing the audience and went more for depth which worked very well.

The film starts off pretty rushed. In fact, the film is rushed altogether. You feel as if the filmmakers wanted to get through with the film. The laziness is so apparent in here that you're wondering how much the executives offered in their salary. The film is so lazy that there are even glaring plot holes in the hackneyed script! How the hell does a film that is based on something ridiculous have plot holes? The film--better yet, the franchise, spends most of its time in setting up rules on the order people are going to die yet this film ignores practically everything and kills people in any order it feels like!

Even the clever foreshadowing from the previous films is quite blatant here. The laziness is also extended to the death scenes. Remember, quality, not quantity. Even though this film has the most death scenes compared to the previous entries, most of them suck and even that word wouldn't give the deaths that much justice. We all have to admit it sooner or later but we see these films for the death scenes. What is the freaking point in watching this film if they turn out to be lazy to an extent that some death scenes are rehashed from previous FD films? Exactly. There is no point.

Another problem about the death scenes is that there is barely any suspense when people are about to get killed. Usually, in the FD films, seeing the set up of the Rube Goldberg-like death scenes IS the suspense, but in here, they feel as if they come out of nowhere because of how rushed everything is. They're surprising, yes, but the surprises wear off very quickly. Google up Alfred Hitchcock's definition of ""suspense"" to learn the difference between surprise and suspense.

Let's move on to the next problem: CGI. With the 3D technology, it's obvious the filmmakers wanted to add more CGI effects so the images could pop out on the screen. The problem here is that the FINAL DESTINATION series is always known for their practical effects. The premonition sequence in here works well in 3D, sure, but the CGI is terrible! They look so fake that I questioned how this film wasn't released direct to DVD.

You know you have a bad film when a franchise that was supposed to be scary and mysterious now turns into something that pokes fun of itself. It has happened many times before, most notably, the NIGHTMARE ON ELM STREET franchise. It's as if the filmmakers were aware that the franchise is dying and that their last attempt was to add self-aware characters and idiotic, dumb lines in the film with the many problems the film already has.

Even the characters are more like an excuse to kill them off later. It's apparent that this isn't a movie but more of a carnival ride, waiting to see who dies and how they will die. That's how low this film has gone. You'd also be surprised to find out that the most fleshed out character is, in fact, not the protagonist, but a supporting character, played by Mykelti Williamson. He gives a laughable and forced performance but that's nothing compared to Bobby Campo, who is easily the worst premonitionist in the franchise. He can't act to save his life. And the less we say about the others, the better. However, I'm willing to admit the only character I did feel sympathy for was played by Krista Allen, who plays a motherly role with an extremely short running time.

However, there are other few things that I liked about the film (emphasis on the word ""few""): There's a sequence in a salon and a car wash that have at least SOME suspense. I don't know if this counts but I also liked the opening credits, which I thought was ingenious, a montage of the previous films' memorable death scenes. And that's about it. Three things. What an accomplishment!

I guess it isn't hard to tell but this is, by far, the weakest in the series because there's nothing new. You'd expect that a mythology so easily expandable would be explored here but no. By the end of the film, you feel underwhelmed. You wished they could have done better. In fact, you KNOW they could have done better. If they were to make a fifth film, they better put some thought into it. If you're thinking about watching this movie only ONCE, you should see it in its intended format in 3D AND in theaters, but I don't see why anyone should waste their money on this film.",1288656000,3,4871,4.533560864618885

3598921,1,B001GCUO4S,"I liked final destination 1 & 2, especially the way Death put time and attention into killing one person at at time and making it look like an accident.
Take that teens!!!
Then in 3, death takes a few bystanders along with some cast at the end. Maybe they were saved from some other near death event.
And now, since there wasn't an asteroid nearby that could be slammed into the earth. Death just wants to kill as many people as possible.
Some of them as CGI skeletons!!!

PROS
- 2 deaths were interesting.
- There is a recap at the start of all the great deaths of the series.
  Although whenever there is a recap of previous excellence in a film, you know you should worry.

CONS
- Liver failure!!
  Scared of animal livers lying around signifying someone is dead?
  Avoid this film like an idle animal liver then.
  Since it looks like they reused the same one multiple times after someone died.
  In fact, instead of the classic ""show a grave after you seen the person surprised"", just drop a few livers.
- Lazy car crashes. The cars in this film don't crash, they transform into explosions!!
  No need for wreckage, they just completely explode, cause it was friday afternoon where CGI was made.
- 3d ""effects"", meanly household items move closer to the screen, telling us all how the next event will happen.
  Creepy, no with, awful, considering if you're not watching it in 3d you get the same effect by picking up something with your hand
  and MOVING YOUR HEAD CLOSER TO IT!!!
- Characters you couldn't care less about.
  I liked the security guard, he deserved an original death, instead he got a recycled death.
  Every other character is so annoying you wish they died at the start and the film was 10 minutes long.
  Honestly, you wish they all just fell down some stairs or something.
- Disbelief!!
  Death is after us, thats crazy!!! I don't think its possible that death is STILL after us EVEN THOUGH YOU JUST SAVED ME FROM DROWNING!!!
- Death can't count!!
  So a handful of people were saved at the start, well i guess death should KILL EVERYONE IN A CROWDED MOVIE THEATRE.
  Yeah, death is balancing the scales like a drunk accountant who HATES his job.
- Some die as cgi skeletons.
  Because these guys couldn't even act like they were dead, which means being covered in blood, eyes open, and LIVERS!!
  And this was probabaly too much for them.",1286755200,,2365,4.513002364066194
3598922,3,B001GCUO4S,"I've seen all 4 final destinations now, and this one was the worst. I liked the 3 before but, I dunno about this one. The acting wasn't all that great or convincing and, after awhile, the same storyline just gets old. How many times can a group of people cheat death just to have it come back and hunt them down? Back to the acting.. The main characters in this one, as I stated, weren't very convincing at all. Normally, in real life, when you lose a friend or see a gruesome death happen up close you're traumatized, shocked. (Yes, I know this is a movie but it's supposed to be convincing right?) Not these people. They didn't even act like the deaths bothered them. They acted like they were going out for ice cream instead, you'd get about the same reaction that you got from these actors. It was just the same ole same ole and the storyline just felt routine. Nothing shocking happened, nothing. No surprises but, then again, how can there be a surprise when you've seen the same movie with the same plot 3 times before? I was excited to see it because the first 3 rocked but this one was a disappointment. Felt like it was thrown together too fast and the 3D didn't help. I'm not a fan of 3D and it just seemed dumb to have this one in that form. If you are looking to buy this movie to add to the rest of your Final Destination collection then, by all means, go ahead. Buuuttt, if you're looking for a good movie that's entertaining then you might wanna pass this one up. It's just not as good as the first 3.

  This 4th movie in the series is called THE Final Destination (2009) a.k.a. Final Destination 4, because, at the time, it was meant to be the last film.
  Hunt (Nick Zano) and his friends Janet (Haley Webb), Nick (Bobby Campo) and Lori (Shantel VanSanten) attend an auto race instead of going to the movies. Hunt just wants to see an auto crash.  After Nick comes back with the drinks, first his wooden bench begins to split. Then he notices the concrete structure is not so solid above him.  Nick begins to sense something is about to happen and indeed it does.  A series of events happen causing a car to jump and crash, the wheels fly over the fence and hits where our Hunt, Janet, Nick and Lori are. A burning car flies through the fence and also lands where they were seated.  They made a quick getaway, but this isn't over yet.
  Nicks premonitions was right on.
  All four of our main characters survive as well as other people at the stadium thanks to Nick and his hysteria to get people to move. He is a hero.
  However, Nicks premonitions continue and the fate of death is going to continue in a chain of events.  All of his friends and the others at the stadium that did not die then are still in danger.

3598942,5,B001GCUO4S,"You know, I tend to find the Final Destination series to be among the SCARIEST of all the horror films out there.  This is because the actual horror comes in the way of REAL possibilities.

Alright, so they are real possibilities *greatly* exaggerated for the sake of creating a quality horror film, but when you stop and really think about it, the Final Destination series could really mess with your head, and perhaps even permanently screw up your mental state.

That is, if you choose to take it seriously and believe in this kind of stuff.  You know, believing the death of every single person on the face of the planet is meant to happen for a reason, and we're all just ticking clocks waiting to die.  For someone like me, it's hard *not* to take a film like this somewhat seriously.  Death is just unbelievably fascinating to me, and this interpretation of it makes it even more exciting.

After all, the way people die in this film involve cars, fires, heavy objects falling on top of people and crushing them, and several other realistic possibilities.  It's hard for me NOT to think some of this stuff is actually entirely likely to happen.

Of course, the odds of a domino effect coming together and forming the perfect strategy to eliminate a human being is EXTREMELY unlikely to actually happen, but well... sometimes in real life, only a couple things have to come together in order to take out a person.  With *this* in mind, now you know why I find this series a bit freakier than other horror films.  It's exaggerated, but not entirely out of the realm of possibility.

The movie writers who come up with the storylines for these kind of films must be exceptionally smart and clever.  They must sit there and actually think up the most bizarre and creative ways that a person can die.  Like I said above- these creative and incredibly graphic deaths are highly unlikely to happen in reality, but the fact so much attention to detail was given makes me really think the movie writers have a special talent for these specific kind of horror films.

Anyway, another aspect of the Final Destination series that gives me a distinctly cold chill is whenever a death is about to happen, and you see a black shadow forming around the area or object that will eventually play a major role in killing a person.  It happens very briefly before the shadow fades away (along with a creepy sound effect to indicate it's there) but it's a special attention to detail that I REALLY like.  Good job to the movie writers for including it.  It actually makes me wonder if similar kinds of shadows can be seen in real life as a warning sign right before someone dies.  You never know.

Anyway, what makes THIS Final Destination even better than previous ones is the fact that there's a *lot* of death scenes this time around.  Not only that, but the death scenes you witness this time around are EXTREMELY graphic, bloody and disgusting.  I sure hope you have a strong enough stomach to handle it!  They lay it on really thick and heavy for this one.

Overall, yes.  Death is freaky.  Believing everything happens for a reason and certain people are meant to die is a *very* dangerous line of thinking (believe me, I've thought about it hard and heavy for several years now, and it's NOT healthy).  But do yourself a favor and check out a really superb way to handle the horror genre in the Final Destination series.  It's mind-bogglingly creative and just terrific.",1281312000,14,3464,4.625204582651391

3598970,2,B001GCUO4S,"Like ""Wash, rinse, repeat""...The Final Destination's refrain is laboriously repetitive.  The fourth film in the series offers nothing new over its predecessors other than the novelty of being in 3D.  Now sure, if there was ever a series perfectly suited for 3-D it's the Final Destination series with its in-your-face kills.  Unfortunately, 3-D on home TV pretty much sucks.  While technology has advances in theaters, home 3-D still has not managed to do any better than the same blue and red 3-D glasses that have been around for decades.  If you can sit through this and not develop a migraine from the glasses then you're a winner!

This film begins as all the others, with one of the characters having a premonition of a terrible disaster.  This time it takes place at an auto race as Nick (Bobby Campo) has a vision of a crash which will spill into the stands killing dozens of spectators.  Nick gets his friends Lori, Hunt, and Janet out, as well as some nearby spectators just before the carnage unfolds.  And carnage it is with, among other kills, a woman who gets crushed by a car's engine.

From there you know the story.  Death isn't about to let the group get away.  It's not long before each of the survivors of Nick's vision gets killed in one gruesome way after another as Nick tries to somehow break the chain and throw death off their track.  Like elaborately placed dominos, the death scenes unfold with chance circumstances leading to the big payoff.  But the entire film trudges from one death to the next.  The group sits around trying to figure out who is going to be next on the hit list, arriving just seconds too late to stop it, before the entire cycle starts over.  Even the Friday the 13th series managed to forward the character of Jason somewhat in each film.  Here there's not even the attempt to understand Death's...or Fate's motives.  The director merely wants to play with the 3-D which is lackluster at best.  Even the actors play their roles like soldiers doing the same drill for the hundredth time.

As has been the case with the series, the opening mass-killing is the highlight of the film but this one has little to keep the viewer's interest beyond the first twenty minutes.

3598971,1,B001GCUO4S,"Well, they managed to sunk this franchise further below (spoilers below).

The thinny (but eventually engaging) premise made this franchise survive more than the only one film that it deserved. After all, it was a clever idea: who can be a stronger vilain than Death itself?

The previous three movies did never bother to even try to explain the following questions:

a) Why the main character has/acquires the premonition power?

b) Why Death goes through all the trouble to plan extremely intricate plots to get his victims after they survive its first plan?

c) Why all the teen characters, when faced with such tremendous odds, appears to have no relatives, parents, friends, contacts, anyone who could help them?

This fourth chapter bothers even less with answering those questions. Also, it's extremely more cruel than the others before: there's not even a hint of hope for the characters to survive (and they don't) And the cast sunk to a new low: performances were uniformly lousy, to a point that you simply don't care. You simply doesn't know nothing about them: if they are students, if they work, whatever.

To make things worse, the writer planned a ""twist"": after all the struggle fighting Death's inegenious plans, the main characters figures that Death had planned for them to die that wat all along. Naughty Death...

Anyway, this is indeed the worst of the four movies.

But they will make another, be sure of that... At least, they could gather an audience by promising to explain why the premonitions occur...",1273708800,,1530,4.9453125
3598972,3,B001GCUO4S,"""The Final Destination"", released in some countries as ""Final Destination: Death Trip 3D"", continues the series with barely a reference to the previous 3 chapters, and with a fair degree less effectiveness.  It admittedly had a high bar to live up to though, and is still worth watching.

  In the Final Destination series, a number of catastrophes have been avoided by a character having a premonition which directly results in them, and a group of other people, avoiding that forseen fate.  Death then seems to come after them, though, as if it's deliberately trying to reclaim each person who survived because of that premonition.  In Parts 2 and 3, vague hints that could have been the beginning of links tying the separate incidents together were forming, but that's been dropped here and we get right to an all-new scenario and all-new characters.  In fact, one watching this movie without being aware of the others might hardly guess that this was actually the fouth and not the first entry.  Expecially since they dropped the ""Part 4"" and simply added ""The"" ahead of the title.  In any event, this chapter opens at a Nascar-type racetrack, where a multi-car crash-up spills into the stands and kills quite a few spectators.  It's reminiscent of the highway disaster in Part 2 but not as effective.  After the character of Nick (Bobby Campo) foresees these, he creates a commotion that gets himself, his friends, and a few nearby strangers thrown out of the stadium right before the explosive crash-up.  Shortly thereafter, death starts coming for the survivors.

  One weakness is with the way death comes this time.  In previous entries, the incidents were usually spectacular, and at the same time could have each, by themselves, been written off as once-in-a-lifetime freak accidents.  Only the way these freak accidents continue happening, targeting survivors, reveals that there's something far bigger and stranger than coincidence at work.  Here, the individual incidents (of what I think of as Death's ""Backlash"" effect) are not only a bit weak (for the most part) compared to the previous movies, they make less sense.  For example, some water spills on a countertop.  For some reason this causes a drink container to slowly slide across the counter until it hits a lever, which causes something to short out and kill somebody.  Now, there's a way to take this wonkiness in cause and effect as something that actually works, if they want to follow up on it in any future sequel.  Death could be getting stronger, perhaps Because of the whole premonition/backlash effect.  So say early on, it could take a one-in-a-milion probability and make it happen; now it can take something so far out that it wouldn't likely be seen as simple coincidence, more like a one-in-a-billion probability, and use that to its advantage.  Just a thought, because otherwise many of the deaths in here seem very contrived.

  Okay, there's the negatives.  Positives - not all of the death backlashes are that weak, and some - even allowing for far reduced cause-and-effect, do come off pretty impressive.  The production values are very high as is par for the course in Final Destination; the female cast members are gorgeous, as is par for the course; and at the very end the movie finally re-captures a sense of grandeur.  I can't really get into that without giving away the ending, but something about it struck me in a particular way that just adds to my thinking that they may be planning the introduction of some really new elements for the future.  That something bigger may be coming.

  The characters, admittedly, weren't as strong this time out.  The acting itself was fine, and I thought Mykelti Williamson (George) and Haley Webb (Janet) managed to milk the most out of their roles.

  Now onto the 3D.  I've seen both the 2D and 3D versions of the movie, although the 3D wasn't in a theater.  Actually, because the town I live in doesn't have RealD technology in its theater, I've yet to see the new wave of 3D and how impressive it's supposed to be (Note to self: this summer, get yer rump to the nearest city that Does have a 3D theater in time for Piranha 3D and/or Resident Evil: Afterlife 3D).  However, based on the home viewing experience, The Final Destination made possibly the best use of 3D I've yet seen, not in the stunts it went for but in the visual quality.  One home sets (I don't have a thousand dollar flatscreen but my set isn't a bottom-of-the-line piece of junk, either) the 3D is still impressive, but sometimes the picture's hazy or the color scheme takes a beating, tending toward black-and-white on certain, mainly a bit older, releases.  The 3D on The Final Destination was sharp, for the most part holding its color and its clarity.  The 3D improved on the 2D experience in another way.  Most of the Final Destination series has had very good special effects.  In this one, there are a few times where they don't look nearly as real, but these generally improve when watching in 3D compared to 2D.  Perhaps they were specificall designed for the 3D format and looked Really good on a RealD screen.  But there should be a way to keep them looking good in 2D as well.  None of the sequences were awful in 2D, just not always up to the standards of the series.

  In the end, this is still very much worth seeing.  It's behind the others in most ways, but judged on its on merits is still a very enjoyable movie.  And the Final Destination concept lends itself exceptionally well to the 3D format.  Note for connosseurs - the 3D hologram cover is pretty impressive itself.",1272326400,,5606,4.771309771309771

If you're expecting a clever end to the series with someone finding a way to defeat death without it finally catching up with him or her, think again. While the 3-D doesn't make the weak effects look any better or make us forget that we've seen this all before. No wonder Michael Bay is putting Transformer 3 in 3-D. We'll get the same story and the same actors running around in slow motion and plenty of explosions, but this time in....3-D to try and distract the viewer from the fact that we seen all that before.

  The Final Destination just has someone having a vision of himself and his friends dieing at a race car show. The bad accident then really happens, but his friends and others get out safe. But...oh no, death had a plan for them to die too and now they are dieing in the same order that they would have at the show.

Bad casting and acting (none of the characters are memorable and you don't really care what happens to them).

The violent deaths are too obvious, silly and gimmicky as though they had to find excuses to include shots that would work with 3D.

3598996,2,B001GCUO4S,"I love Final Destination (2000). It's scary, even if it doesn't take itself seriously - much like Scream, back in '96. One of the things that came out as distinctive, or 'original', about it was the fact that death itself was chasing these characters who were meant to die but escaped.

Now, ten years and 3 movies later, plotwise, there's absolutely nothing original about these movies. They've basically remade the original movie 3 times, and people keep coming to the theatres mainly to see how different the deaths are.

Even the death scenes have gotten increasingly worse since FD2. FD2 was, yes, a ""remake"", but a worthy sequel nonetheless. The opening was absolutely fantastic, scary, crazy stuff. Made me terrified to go home by car. The deaths were a bit cartoonish but not cartoonish enough to make me laugh (FD3, FD4.)

These movies are not (supposed to be) comedies. I guess that's the problem. There was a ominous, malevolent presence in FD and FD2 that I just wasn't able to see in FD3 and 4.

I wish they came up with a ORIGINAL Final destination movie. Enough with the premonitions. stop making us roll our eyes. make it scary. bloody does not mean scary. make a good movie. remind me why i am/was a fan.",1265760000,3,1221,4.665116279069768

I can honestly say that I found myself laughing at both the dialogue and insane amounts of gore (you have to see certain scenes to believe them, and even then they don't make much sense). This is a fun movie, but not an Oscar-worthy one.

If you want over the top bloody, gory fun, then this movie is fine.  Don't expect the script to be anything but messy, and don't expect spectacular cinematography.  It looks great on Blu-ray (but the 3-D scenes obviously don't have the same type of impact that they would have in theaters).

I bought it to add to my collection and expected to be on the edge of my seat like with all the others. I do like the storyline as having it all start at the raceway but there seemed to be a lack of characters and the characters that were portrayed weren't the brightest in trying to survive. I don't know if it was because they really didn't care if they lived or died or if they just weren't smart enough to do their research on past similar events. I was a bit confused because the other 3 movies were related. Every part after part one mentions what happened in the part before and how it effects the new characters. I was also wondering what happened to the surviving cop and girl from part 2.

3599055,4,B001GCUO4S,"This is a very bizzare movie. It is like a Final Destination installment on loads of crack. Think ""Crank: High Voltage"" and you've got a clear view of this movie, almost.
This movie is covered in CGI, which is done for the 3-D. It is so strange, with some really overly cartoony effects, including falling concrete, a flying motor, etc.
It's somewhat of a self-parody almost.
I really enjoyed the opening scene with the race cars; I thought it wouldn't be up to par with previous movies but it was. The car wash scene was also very well done. Some deaths were so insane, like a guy being pulled through a overcharged pool drainer, a woman getting a motor on top of her, a man being hit into a fence and parts of him being cut in squares, etc. The ending with people seeing a 3-D movie brought self-awareness.
What it does lack in further plotting, though the agressive vision style, and one character accepting death so he can see his wife and kids I thought worked well.
Other parts were funny like a character being referred to as ""the racist"", the incompetence of the main character, one extremly stupid guy, and a lot more.
Some people will hate this movie for what it represents in the franchise; a total exploitation of silliness and way too much fun that it can't possibly be enjoyable. But it is.

I for one hope they make Final Destination 5 on a cruise ship, with death being a real thing. Keep the CGI but make it a lot darker and the franchise will keep going strong. ""The Final Destination"" will always be noted as the wierd one, and I think it's a good thing.",1264291200,2,1573,4.424137931034482
3599056,2,B001GCUO4S,"Horror movie sequels perfectly illustrates the concept of diminishing return in economics.  FD4 is however a sharp drop in quality from the previous three entries in the profitable teen horror franchise.  FD1 formulates the general ideas (i.e. death and destiny) for the franchise.  FD2 is a great continuation.  FD3 has many great kills though the formula has got stale by then.  FD4 offers nothing new in terms of the story.  Kills are derivative and dull.  Digital blood and sanitized gore look laughably fake.  The opening race track crash and end theater explosion are sub par, comparing to the rollercoaster and subway train accidents in FD3.  The beauty parlor scene is a pale imitation of death by tanning beds in FD3.  The FD4 ending is so abrupt.  It left me scratch my head.

I suppose that the main attraction is the 3D technology.  I saw it in 2D theater.  I doubt that 3D enhances the experience given an inept script and kills.

3599083,2,B001GCUO4S,"Well guys, look at it this way. The Final Destination Series has now made its fame in the horror movie world: the gory accidental deaths, the premonitions leading up to each, the shattering conclusions. We get it... Final Destination. And if anything, this better be ""The Final Destination"". How many installments have we endured already? Oh right, 4. I forgot since we have had so many fly our way.

I very well enjoyed the first movie. It was original, it had a cool concept that we hadn't seen before, good acting, some good gory deaths, and also some good aspiring actors that are still in movies today. The second one I enjoyed, but not as much, but I still enjoyed it. And hell, I'm man enough to even fess up to enjoying the third one, even though it was slightly retarded, but I still liked it- it had that kid from the opening scene of The Ring 2, it solidified my fear of roller coasters (I don't think I'll be going on The Mind Bender anymore or going tanning after seeing it), Had lots of gore, and that (choose their fate) thing was fun to play with.

And then I saw this one. I missed its 3D theatrical release which is something I regretted. But recently tonight I sat down and watched it in 2D on Blu-Ray, and I guess I don't regret missing it in 3D. This movie is pretty much a confirmation that the series is pure straight dead in the water (no pun intended).

The movie begins with the four principal characters: One's a guy named Nick that looks like my friend Nick, two are sexy chicks: Lori and Janet, and another guy, named Hunt, who has hair that is but a hint to how big of a douche bag he is. They are all gathered at the speedway for a bit of the ol' Speed racing... in a VERY OLD speedway. After smuggling Jack Daniels into binoculars (*makes JD smuggling plans for the coming U2 concert*... OK!!! I'm joking!!!! God, take a joke, will ya?), tampons as ear plugs, and an obnoxious racist redneck behind him, a car crash is caused by a flat tire, and the guy's car basically collapses on the speedway, and... well... its parts shoot out towards everyone! And furthermore... *dramatic music*... the speedway collapses!...

...oh, well, it was just a premonition. So like in the other movies, our heroine, Nick saves everyone... except one who escaped! Anyways, so after. Basically, there's a memorial at the speedway after it actually happens, and thus like in the other movies, a bunch if far-fetched deaths and other stuff happen, and Nick tries to ""rip up Death's list"", yada yada yada. And I don't need to summarize the rest because you hae seen the other three (or at least I hope you have), and so you basically know the turn of events.

Now let's take a look at the movie in general. It's called ""THE"" Final Destination. The ""the"" is emphasized for a reason: it's THE Final Destination. Thankfully it is. At 80 minutes, this movie goes by fast. Thankfully it does- the movie is an 80 minute re-hashing of movies 1-3, but with more deaths and gore, more of everything basically. More nudity, more douche bags, more hot girls, more... need I continue?

See the problem with this movie is that as virtually plot-free as it is, it's also criminally BORING. Maybe it's because of the nausem of the first three movies. But there's nothing new, nothing exciting here. This is basically just the entire series in autopilot mode- with nothing but more deaths and gore. You can basically say this movie is The PERIOD Final Destination, but then again you could say that for the others too. And Ellis tries to fill in the void with some CG, but even that fails, because it is virtually fake looking and cheap.

Also, despite this movie being THE Final Destination, the ending leaves the gates open for a fifth movie. But why I would want to sit through a fifth installment after an arse-numbing 80 minutes of a fourth installment is beyond me. But then again, a completist, my inner hypocrite will see the fifth movie. Who am I to break up a series?

So basically, by skipping this movie, you aren't missing anything. Just what you saw in movies 1-3 again, and what you will continue to see for years to come.

IN TOTAL:
Entertainment: 4/10- wasted potential
Sex: 3/10, and NOT of the good kind (more like the douche bag kind)
Violence: It's a FD movie, okay?/10
Gore: I'm keeping my *eye* on you/10
Jerk hair: 10/10
Death by pool drains: Will have exhausted outdoor pools for months to come
Car Washes: Well, there's a new definition of ""suddy water""
Seen it all before: 10/10
Superfluous dreams: Holy crap! I just had this CRAZY dream where I saw this stupid movie called ""The Final Destination""!... I wish.
Should this series end now? You know the answer, it's three letters

In ""The Final Destination"" (in 3-D!), Death has its eyes fixed on a Nascar race, and when an assortment of spectators escape their fate, they find themselves receiving their comeuppance in the most grisly and brutal ways imaginable, of course.

By now, the formula for these films has been worn down considerably, and unfortunately the fourth installment in this inventive franchise does little to push the envelope, save for some gory and outrageous deaths. Switching back to&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination-2/dp/B00005JLZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination 2</a>&nbsp;director David R. Ellis, it should come as no surprise that the film is yet another guilty-pleasure carnival of carnage. At this point, you know what to expect, and while the plot is skimpy at best, this sequel pulls no punches and, at the very least, doesn't make you feel like you wasted your time. What it lacks in good characters and original story, it makes up for in its money shots (a.k.a. the death scenes).

The 3-D gimmick helps the film out a bit, but unfortunately it's not put to as good of use as it was in the ""My Bloody Valentine"" remake. You'll get giddy during the opening sequence (which is introduced brilliantly by pummeling you with Shinedown's hard-hitting hit, ""Devour"") and get slight satisfaction out of seeing a few less-than savory characters get what they deserve (it's all about that pool scene!). Fans of the franchise will no doubt squeeze some entertainment from ""The Final Destination,"" but as for its future as a lasting franchise?

As he freaks out some people out of the seats it comes true as the rest of the people in the stadium dies horrificly becoming one of the worst accidents in the city's history. But it's not over yet as some of the survivors such as a sexy mother (Krista Allen), a security worker (Mykelti Williamson), and others are in danger for the Grim Reaper wants to kill them as well and only Nick can save them.

Improves over the weak third entry and it goes in 3D as it was amazing in theaters but still nice on home theater viewing. The director of part 2 returns in the director's chair as this installment takes the franchise even futhur and goes for the jugular on the graphic gore and accidents that pushes limits much like the similar ""Saw"" series was. You gotta see some of the deaths in this movie to believe it such as the pool-drainage death which is horrifying, the acting is bad including some dialog but this is a 3D ride to hell done right like last year's pleasant suprise ""My Bloody Valentine 3D"".

The end result however offers up a few decent shocks, but is an otherwise forgettable teens dying in horrible ways dirge.  This time around, a group of friends manages to survive the destruction at a racetrack when one of them (Bobby Campo) has a premonition of their impending, bloody doom.  As said before, The Final Destination offers up some decent shocks and reasonably impressive and creative deaths, but what's in between them is nothing that hasn't been seen plenty of times before.  Combine that with the illogical plotting, terrible dialogue, stiff acting, and the fact that the 3-D moments are more few and far between then they really should be, and the end result is an installment in a franchise that is definitely on life support.

Really it's just ""Final Destination"" 4, but they added a The in front of the title to set it apart from the original 3, for which the original 3 must be grateful. Actually they should have stopped at #2 with it's appocalyptic highway crash from hell(the first premonition) and the hilariously gruesome finale with a dismembered barbequed leg complete with tennis shoe landing on a family picnic table. Number 3 was ok with its rollercoaster disaster and there were some imaginative ""deaths""-the nail gun scene was perfectly timed for suspense.  The first movie was very good and while some may argue it was the best, I still prefer #2 as the best of the bunch.

Now comes the latest in the franchise and ""The Final Destination"" fails on all counts-The characters and the actors playing them are boring-the ""deaths"" are surprisingly tame and even lame. The budget on this installment must have been pretty small because most of the gore is missing which is unusual since this series usually is pretty graphic with its guts and gore. Maybe most of the budget was consumed by the 3-D effects but you know they also squandered this too when the best 3-D effect is a popped champagne cork. And wearing those crappy cardboard glasses is no joy either.

(4.)

First, there was the plane explosion, then there was the pile-up, followed by a roller-coaster disaster, now we have a race car track catastrophe. My biggest question is, what can they do next? The answer, alot! I don't want this franchise to end just yet. The critics totally missed the point of this series, it was far more original than any 'slasher film' I've ever seen, and I've seen my share of good and bad.

Starting off with the accident sequence, I was already bummed they couldn't think of anything different since an accident involving cars was already used. But I thought mabye they could make it as intense and crazy as that accident, wrong!
While some of the deaths are interesting, most of the accident is just people running around screaming with obvious CGI around.
Then comes the death scenes. They are by far the worst in the series. The only one that was semi jump inducing was the hair salon death. All the other ones were bland and just not interesting.
The other thing that really put a damper on this movie was the character development, there wasn't any! The other FDs at least gave you a coherent backstory and some reason to care about what happens to the people. But this one, it doesn't even bother with that. Not to mention the acting is bad and and some points its even laughable. It was way too rushed which is ultimately what ruined the movie.

Acting, bad. The younger actors have no talent! They don't seem to have the same appeal as the actors from the other movies. Barely any character within the characters, and when they do, it's the same as the other movies(jock, slutty girls, good girl, weird person, etc.), predictable.
The deaths, original, yet boring. Unlike the other movies, the deaths are pretty boring, and unrealistic, though yes the other movies were pretty unrealistic (besides #1), they were believeable enough not to point them out.
It seems like there was no character interactions. They would go after each person and then they would die. The characters were just pawns to have more bloody deaths.

FD3 was ok, but was no where near as good as parts 1 or 2, and I did not expect this 4th installment to be as good as either of those, so I was not that disappointed when this 4th one finished and I thought, ""I knew it""

The plot of this one is much the same as the others, the group of people in this one survive being victims of a Nascar crash that caused havoc in the stands of spectators. Then one by one, death catches up with them. However, the plot and finding outs in this one did not hold up as well as the first 2, or even the 3rd one for that matter.

I decided to post this review to inform people of the 3D BluRay version.  The disk itself has both the typical 2D version of the movie, and an Anaglyph 3D version.  For this reason, I have to say, do NOT buy this movie if you are expecting an amazing 3D experience.  Many of the scenes were shot with dominating red or blue hues which play havoc with the Anaglyph (red and blue lenses) 3D format.  Many scenes are more of a headache to watch in 3D than are justified by the addition of 3D.  You will find yourself taking off the glasses and switching to the 2D version of the film within the first 45 minutes.  If you were going to buy this movie based on the 3D experience, your money is better spent elsewhere.  For fans of the previous films, they will not be disappointed.

Soon enough the AVC-3D codec will be released and allow for polarized screens/glasses that don't destroy the colours in the film you are watching.  Until then, 3D Anaglyph blu-ray disks are just novelty, no more.",1260403200,7,1263,4.2384937238493725

3599148,3,B001GCUO4S,"At heart, all horror movies operate on the human response to mortality.  Your average horror fan gets a thrill from the films because they are a sort of spice for life, they are the seasoning that makes the mundane parts of life all the more richer.  Watch a bunch of people get sliced and diced by a monster or madman, and that adrenaline rush makes you feel as if, on some level, you yourself have cheated death.  For awhile or more, it's nice to be alive.

The FINAL DESTINATION films utilize the same premise, but instead of creating a defeatable or relatable villain, it makes the very act of dying the villain.  Watching the movies, it's very much like they decided that the force of Death, after a millenia of ending lives, has grown bored and has decided to put some spice into his job.  In all of the movies, Death awards a young soul with a premonition of a huge catastrophe, and when that soul saves him/herself (along with a handful of others), Death gleefully sets up cat-and-mouse games with the survivors and watches as they scream and skitter.  The question is never Will They Die?  It is How Long Can They Hold Out?

Because everyone dies, sooner or later, and it's rarely at the hands of a zombie or a Leatherface.  Car accidents are far more common.  Fires.  Mechanical failures.  The FD films make Death a snarky, sadistic force without ever showing his face.  Instead, Death operates basically through three cards -- wind, gravity, and passive human interference -- and with these three things, he orchestrates the deaths of dozens and dozens of characters.  These films are filled with pointless scenes of people screaming that they're in control of their lives, scoffing at the idea that Death lurks everywhere.  Then they die.

The real fun in these films lies in the complex machinations that Death sets in motion with the leak of a pipe or the flutter of a bird.  If you're expecting interesting plots, complex characters, or realistic dialogue, prepare to be HEAVILY disappointed.  In fact, these elements of the films get steadily more and more wooden and cartoonish, until by the fourth installment, they are laughably bad.  The makers know that what you're really waiting for is to watch Death do his thing, investing everything from quarters to fishsticks with a sinister menace.  To that end, I have provided here a summary of the only thing about each of these films that is worth watching: the death scenes.

In the first film, Death's premonition is visited upon a young student on a plane.  The ensuing plane accident (5/5) gave me nightmares for a week.  When the student leaves the plane along with others, he then experiences more premonitions (most of them cheesy reflections in windows) indicating that Death is now hunting them down.  Of all the movies, this one features the most personified version of Death.  A dark mist accompanies each death, and you can even see Death pursuing some characters, especially in a tense bathroom scene (4/5).  Some of the deaths feature complex sequences of domino-like chains (there is a catastrophic house fire (4/5) and a menacing electrical storm (4/5)).  Others are less creative (the bus and train accidents are both unimaginative throwaways (2/5)).  The final death (by sign) is a cheeky nod at the movie's premise (4/5).  Notable in this film: Death has a soundtrack, which turns out to feature, over and over again, ""Leaving on a Jet Plane.""

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination-2/dp/B00005JLZK/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination 2</a>:
Death isn't so hung up on music this time around, but that's okay because he's a bit more creative.  This film's opening highway accident is by far the best beginning out of any of these films (5/5), and when the storyline later ties the survivor's lives to the events of the first film, it's actually interestingly done.  Not as interesting as the deaths, though.  You've got a tongue-in-cheek apartment fire (4/5), a crushing visit to the dentist (4/5), and an unusually persistent elevator (3/5).  In one case, the jaws of life have the opposite function (4/5), and in another case a flying fence executes a mortal ballet (5/5).  There are also three explosive deaths that are a little cheap (2/5).  The characters this time around all get premonitions (again, mostly just false reflections in windows), and they spend a lot of pointless time trying to cheat Death's plan (their ideas mostly centering around a ""new life"").  The final scene, just as in the first film, is an over-the-top nyuck-nyuck moment.  ""It's all in fun,"" Death seems to be saying.

This time around it's a roller coaster catastrophe (4/5).  The movie has a creative idea by putting the premonitions into poorly shot yearbook photos, and Death continues to get up in people's faces with ominous/ironic songs and smug little omens (before one death, characters at a drive-in watch as the word ""control"" disappears from the digital menu).  The first ""catch-up"" death in a tanning salon is perhaps the best of the film (5/5), although there's a nicely intricate set-up later in the film that involves a nail-gun (5/5).  A runaway truck and horse and a falling sign constitute some of the film's weaker executions (2/5, 3/5, and 2/5, respectively).  Elsewhere in the film, the movie's token ""I'm Gonna Live Forever!"" character battles death in a weight room (4/5).  The movie concludes with an intense subway scene that is kinda cool, but also sort of a rip off as far as endings go. (4/5)

The opener here is the weakest of the franchise.  It takes place at a racing track, and so all of the subtle connections and coincidences get lost in the sprawling chaos of the catastrophe (3/5).  The premonitions this time around are ridiculously aggressive hallucinations, and they forecast some rather uncreative demises.  One man is murdered by a tow truck in a way that almost makes sense (1/5).  Another character bites it at a hair salon in a rather unsatisfying fashion (2/5).  There's a clever little two-fer where two characters simultaneously battle watery deaths, although both are almost too cartoonish to be all that scary (4/5 - car wash; 3/5 - swimming pool).  The movie's real saving grace (aside from the 3D, which does its job without much fuss) is it's final theater/mall debacle, which is witty, self-referential, and fairly intense (5/5).  The close of the movie (and, ostensibly, the franchise) is an unceremonious vehicular accident that is only notable for the X-ray vision it is finally shot in.",1252972800,42,7129,5.35278276481149
3599149,4,B001GCUO4S,"I admit, I was skeptical when attending a screening of the latest installment of the Final Destination franchise.  Yet, it served on many levels and succeeded in being an entertaining diversion.  Yes, it doesn't offer up much different than previous chapters, but the approach was fresh.  The musical score by Brian Tyler was fun and complemented the montage of CGI visuals peppered throughout the piece.  The actor portraying the security guard was great, and the teen cast, although expendable, kept things interesting.  It was very tongue-in-cheek--the filmmakers are probably surprised by the popularity of the theme and are trying to push it to new limits.  I myself am looking forward to another sequel, especially if the creative team behind this horror venture continues to layer the twists and turns so that audiences keep guessing.  Kudos to the creative forces behind the main titles and the clever x-ray flashbacks to previous FD kills.",1252713600,4,948,5.197368421052632
3599190,5,B001GCUO4S,"I give this movie 5 stars because i am a fan of the movies. However, i didn't like this one as much. Maybe because the first three were older, whereas in this one feels like they're trying too hard to recreate the old ones. Even the deaths are repetative. In FD2 a woman gets smashed with a bus, and in FD4 the same thing, only with a guy this time. Too repetative, deaths aren't creative, and i really hope they don't come out with a fifth, but i will go see it if they do..",1252540800,,475,4.010526315789473
3599191,2,B001GCUO4S,"I know why ""The Final Destination"" was released in 3-D. It's to distract you from the fact that you're being told the exact same story all over again, only with new characters and a plot stripped so bare that the word ""simple"" hardly begins to describe it. What started as a clever and frightening idea back in 2000 has grown tiresome and derivative, and while it isn't quite campy, it definitely takes itself less seriously. I think I heard more laughing in the audience with this film than I did watching ""The Ugly Truth."" Consider an early scene in which a couple of boys cover their ears to shut out loud racetrack noises; their mother provides them with tampons to use as earplugs. Another scene late in the film shows a man trying but failing to hang himself: ""I've been trying to kill myself all day!"" he whines, after which he goes through a list of other failed suicide attempts.

Of course, the 3-D process itself is the majority of the problem. Apparently, death scenes are lot funnier when objects come directly at you. That definitely explains shots of a man's head getting impaled, a golf ball whizzing through a woman's eye socket, and a tire flying through the air before decapitating a young woman. Never mind the horror of it all; if you're in the right mood, you will be in for a good laugh.

In ""The Final Destination,"" the fourth in the series, an equally hapless group of young people find themselves in a frantic struggle against Death. When attending a racecar event with his friends, the burdened Nick O'Bannon (Bobby Campo) suddenly and inexplicably has a premonition that a car accident will kill many people in the arena, himself included. Panicked, he causes a fuss and gets himself and his friends kicked out of the arena, along with a select group of people. Lo and behold, there's an accident, and many people are killed. That should be the end of it, but hold on--it now seems that Death is going through the accident survivors one by one and picking them off. Nick foresees every event, naturally, although he can't quite make out who the event is intended for. That changes when he remembers his initial vision; through a process too inconsequential to describe, he determines the order in which each survivor will die.

It now becomes a matter of Nick breaking the chain and stopping Death in its tracks. But how? His supportive but rattled girlfriend, Lori (Shantel VanSanten) doesn't seem to know, and neither do his callous friend, Hunt (Nick Zano), and his skeptical girlfriend, Janet (Haley Webb). Maybe George Lanter, the race track security guard (Mykelti Williamson), will be able to help Nick figure something out. But they had better hurry; the list of survivors is dwindling fast, and Nick and his friends are next.

Usually, I provide a plot description first and then get into the deeper aspects of the story, such as characterization and theme. In the case of ""The Final Destination,"" the plot is the extent of the film's depth. You want to know about Nick, Lori, Hunt, and Janet? Look no further than what I said in the previous two paragraphs. The actors in this movie weren't hired to play human beings; they were hired to mindlessly stand in a scene and wait for their cue to die a horrible death. Think of it in terms of Sid from the original ""Toy Story"": He saw toys not as prized possessions but as worthless objects, and he liked to destroy them just for the fun of it. Destruction, I admit, can be fun, especially in a horror film. But when all you have at your disposal are drones that have absolutely no life to them, there's no sense of fun or entertainment. There's only a sense of emptiness.

That being said, I realize I haven't said much about the 3-D process. I'll say this much: It achieves what it set out to achieve. This is especially true of the opening and closing credit sequences, which feature animated x-ray images of people being killed in all sorts of nasty ways. Bones break. Teeth shatter and fly right at you. Skullcaps get sliced off. A drill bit seems to be aimed right at our heads. Does this sound appealing to you? If so, fine. If not, be aware that it's probably the best the movie has to offer in the way of cool graphic imagery. Not even a carwash mishap or a movie theater explosion, both effective, have the same power and punch. And shots of Death manipulating objects to cause a disaster stopped being clever a long time ago.

Why are they making more of these movies? Didn't the first one say everything that needed to be said? The insinuation is that ""The Final Destination"" is the last in the series, but I've repeatedly observed that the word ""final"" is meaningless when it comes to a popular horror franchise (""Friday the 13th"" used it twice, and they were proven wrong both times). If the 3-D process is the only way left to make this idea fresh and exciting, if the purpose is no longer to be scary but to film a series of gory death scenes, if the actors are given roles with no depth, then it's probably time to let go and move on to something else. Even Death needs a break from time to time.",1252368000,4,5096,4.570021881838074
3599192,4,B001GCUO4S,"The Final Destination: Movie Review

Grade: B

For my first 3-D movie experience in theaters I picked none other than The Final Destination, despite not really liking the only other film in the series that I had seen,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Final-Destination-3-Widescreen-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B000FC2HS6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Final Destination 3 (Widescreen Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>. The kills to me weren't executed well to me, and overall, it really just failed to impress me. That's were The Final Destination improves: the kills, though a little too coincidental and predictable for my taste, are fun to watch and imaginative, especially in full and vibrant Real-D 3-D.

By now just about everyone walking into the movie knows the series' mythology, and that it's basically about finding inventive and cool ways to kill off annoying and stereotypical people, so I won't waste really waste much time there: After a group of twentysomethings (Actually, the audience never really knows; there is no character development whatsoever) escape from a fiery racetrack explosion, death finds ways of getting them back, whether it's via escalator, car washes, ambulances, or bathtubs. Like I said before: coincidental, but oh so fun to watch.

So yes, the only saving grace is the 3-D, but fear not: The Final Destination will still always entertain you, whether its flinging body parts at you, throwing tools in your way, or just plain out painting you, and the town, a bright red.",1252108800,,1545,5.7336244541484715

3599195,1,B001GCUO4S,"I don't review too many movies and those I do, I either love or hate. The last ""movie"" I saw that was this bad was ""Ruins"" (and I didn't think it was humanly possible to make anything worse than that). Well. . .I was wrong.

As I've seen most of the movies currently playing, my choices were very limited. So. . .after reading the blurb in front of the theater (which was the same mistake I made with Ruins), I decided to try Final Destination (and, sadly, they also didn't have a poster displayed - now I know why). There was so much blood and gore during the first five minutes, along with some of the most asinine and insipid dialog imaginable, that one has to question what type of morons would actually create such nonsense, as well as the intelligence of anyone who would pay money (let alone sit through the entire ""movie"") to see this. Normally, I don't give away the plot but Final Destination obviously doesn't have one. Of course, if you are so feeble-minded that you are entertained by human bodies being mutilated, in every possible conceivable (and non-conceivable) manner, have aspirations of becoming a serial killer, or have never had a brainwave in your life, this movie is certainly for you. Oh, I forgot to mention the ""dialog"" (if that's what it was supposed to be) - stupid teenybopper/college age (but certainly not college bound) kids boozing it up at a demolition derby certainly didn't require a script writer. The racist comments about a Black security guard by some of the lowlife trailer-trash characters, (""There goes the neighborhood"") while another moron whistles Dixie was certainly insightful into the clear lack of intelligence of the movie's creators. Then, they added a little more ""fun"" - every trite and utterly insipid ""special effect"" was not only used to emphasize the dismemberment of countless cast members, but it seemed like there were at least twenty ""actors"" who were impaled with only God knows how many planks, stakes, or anything else that might be used, during the first few minutes.

After seeing enough blood and guts plastered across the silver screen (there was enough blood to fill both the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans) that I literally walked out as the opening title was being displayed. I immediately had my ticket refunded and saw another movie instead.

Perhaps the most disturbing thing of all is that people not only spend money to produce fecal material such a ""Final Destination"" but that other people actually spend money to watch it. Of course, the movie was also shown in 3-D to assist ""audiences"" in enjoying the relentless splattering of body fluids - heck, it might be just about as much fun as going to a slaughter house or cutting off your own extremities with a dull knife.",1251763200,5,2748,4.781052631578947
3599196,2,B001GCUO4S,"The first three films in this series were nothing great, but they had decent scripts and some very unique kills. The kills are what really kept this franchise going, but the ones in Final Destination 4 lack the imagination of the others. There is no mystery this time around (the trailers and TV ads showing way too much didn't help) because it is just so obvious how someone is going to die. The script, dialogue and acting are really bad, even for this kind of flick. I mean it didn't seem like anyone was even trying. If you don't mind paying a few dollars more, the only saving grace is the 3-D. Having body parts and tools of death flying at you from all directions is pretty cool. I wouldn't even think about watching this movie in regular 2-D. I wish I could be more positive, but death should have found this series before this newest release, though I have a feeling plenty more people will be sliced and diced in Final Destination 5 and beyond.

2 and 1/2 out of 5 stars (for the two hot chicks and some neat looking 3-D deaths)",1251504000,6,1038,4.350515463917525
3599197,5,B001GCUO4S,"The 4th, and what is billed as the final ""Final Destination"" flick, reaches a new level with its fantastic 3D presentation.  The storyline is the same; the plot is the same; the ""out-of-your-seat"" suspense is the same; but when you add 3D to the success of the three previous classics, this one is a total winner.  If, in fact, this destination is now final, I think a 4-movie marathon is in order...with the first three being upgraded to 3D!  If you have not been a stout follower of this series, the 3D version will totally blow you away (no pun intended).  Director David Ellis has shared directorship with James Wong since 2000, when the first (and best) film hit the screens.  Wong was the director of 1 and 3, Ellis of 2 and 4.  If asked which is the better director in this supporting role, I would have to stick with Wong.  There's nothing Wong with Wong...everything is right!

While watching this film in the theatre this afternoon, a mom brought her younger children (I'm guessing 8 and 10 years old).  DON'T BRING THE KIDS!  This is much too intense for them...especially in 3D!!!  The kids kept asking their mom if they could leave...but she just told them to shut up and sit down.  Don't make that mistake.  This film will be highly traumatic to kids...and adults if they are not accustomed to a gruesome gorefest like this (and all 4 destinations).

I give this final edition 5 stars because of the 3D element.  Don't wait to see it on DVD.  If you do not see this on the BIG screen...in 3D...""The Final Destination"" will simply be viewed as part 4.  You need the glasses and the popcorn in surround sound.",1251417600,7,1621,4.515463917525773
3599198,2,B001GCUO4S,"Early Screening Review:

 Final Destination really has gone down hill. I am a big fan of the first two, but these last two attempts have been atrocious. There is absolutely no character development, the kills aren't anything spectacular and not even 3d could make this attempt work for me. In the first couple the characters were actually likeable and as far as I'm concerned when Clear Rivers died at the end of the sequel, so did my interest in the series. In the end it's not the worst film you'll ever see, and it's far from the best film you'll see this summer. Overall Final Destination 4 is a weak attempt to cash into viewers pockets. Maybe they'll rebound with the inevitable fifth sequel.",1250380800,11,698,4.620967741935484
