997722,5,6305169187,This movie was all that and then some. It dragged every possible emotion from your inner body to bring this movie to an explosive end. Recommended for anyone over 14 -- just AWESOME!,911347200,,182,4.545454545454546
997723,1,6305169187,"Warning: Do not watch this movie if you are scientificly inclined. Do not watch this movie if you cannot suspend your disbelief at an asteroid the size of Texas being ""diverted"" from its course when it's less  than 20,000 miles from earth (it's a gravitational impossiblility people!).  Ok...so it's a fun romp. But don't expect it to inspire your children to  become astronauts. More likely they will want to be oil rig workers. Good  pay in that.",911260800,,448,4.779220779220779

997935,5,6305169187,"The 'Criterion Collection' release of 'Armageddon' was a surprise; I didn't think that they would offer a release of 'popcorn' movies like this one. Having said that, the release of it shows a good deal of extra material not seen on previous releases. A few minutes of additional footage is woven into the film here, mostly when Harry visited his elderly father (played by Laurence Tierney, I believe) and some additional footage with Harry & Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) at the Johnson Space Center. Additionally, TV spots and a long list of trailers are available, as well as interviews with some of the cast & crew, including 'background' players such as Jessica Steen (NASA pilot Watts), William Fichtner (Col. Willie Sharp) and Marshall Teague (Col. Davis). Outtakes are also seen in places, and some interesting commentaries are included, such as those from NASA officials as well as scientists familiar with the very real threat asteroids such as this fictional one might pose. The 1 problem is the aspect ratio that it's presented in; it doesn't fit my widescreen HDTV. That's the only complaint I have which isn't really enough to undermine it.

This is worth picking up for any fan of the film!",1509840000,3,1207,4.916666666666667

I have been some of the other reviews.  I think in their totality pretty much everything is captured.  One person used the term ""popcorn flick"".  Words like ""fun"", ""entertaining"", ""cheesy"" are used.  I feel all apply.
I thought I might try for a new word ""cliche"".  However that is there too.

I am glad that I was able to see this movie.  I don't know who first said, ""It makes sense as long as you don't think about it"".  That is pretty much how I feel about this movie.  Thank You...",1493510400,,621,4.126050420168068

I thought it was hillarious that they used the SR-71 as a modern day background shot....built in the early 60's. Surround sound is OK, but the movie is so, so, so corny it just made me want to treat it as a comedy. Once we treated it as a comedy, we were able to beter tolerate it.

998939,2,6305169187,"Spoiler Alert-

This was a really bad movie. I gave it two stars because of the action and special effects. And all of that occurred in the second half of the movie. I simply do not understand how the dialogue in this movie ever got past anyone's desk? The premise of the movie is very serious, the possible destruction of Earth by a giant meteorite. Everyone besides the principal players in the movie were completely serious. But the five or six stars, all talented and well known, delivered nothing but cheesy and supposedly funny lines. It's like Oliver Stone's JFK meets Animal House. I couldn't even count how many times the very talented Liv Tyler was filmed for just a few seconds looking worried back at NASA. What was so strange about this movie was it could've been good. But someone decided that this incredibly serious movie needed constant comic relief. And this comic relief was only provided by the principal actors, while everyone else, I mean everyone else delivered dead serious lines. If I ever had a chance to ask any of the stars of this movie if they ever had any reservations about the silly and unfunny dialogue, or the concept that oil rig workmen all have the mentality of a 13-year-old, was just about the money, or did they notice that the lines that they were given in the script were completely ridiculous. The best I can figure is that someone decided that if there were going to make a really exciting and serious possible Armageddon movie, that they needed to pull in children or individuals who actually might find the inane dialogue to be entertaining. Make a really serious movie and have the stars not be serious at all, while everyone else was completely serious. I recommend skipping the first half of the movie and just watching the action and special effects, and maybe even turning down the volume so you don't have to listen to impossible dialogue from unrealistic characters.",1470441600,,1920,4.731343283582089

This is a great story line that you'll go back to many times, and unusually for what I consider a science fiction movie, it's got a great music track.  Bruce Willis plays . . . well, he always plays Bruce Willis, doesn't he?  But he's pretty good as the head of an oil drilling outfit that is called upon to save the earth.  He's a tragic character, especially because of the ending, but a heroic one.  All the other actors and actresses are great in their roles.  I don't want to give away the ending, but it's a good though sad one.  Liv Tyler, really the only main female lead in the film, is actually pretty good.  I'd never heard of her before this film.  Ben Affleck is excellent as Willis' beloved pain in the neck employee.  Billy Bob Thornton is memorable in his role, and William Fichtner is outstanding as Willis' nemesis turned admirer.

999405,4,6305169187,"This movie is a lot of fun.  It's a thrill ride, with realistic characters.  Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Live Tyler, and Billy Bob Thornton make up the main characters.

Bruce's character, Harry Stamper, is the most skilled driller on Earth.  Ben Affleck's character, AJ,  was Harry's 2nd in command.  AJ was also engaged Harry's daughter - Grace. .  Harry's team had successfully pulled off drilling jobs that had been considered impossible.  They're an assortment of Rough Necks.  Crude and individual men, united only by there loyalty to each other.

To stop the asteroid, NASA needed Harry's help.  He picked the best of his people to operate the drills.  The FBI was sent to collect them, with great difficulty.  They were an obstinate lot.  Only when they were actually brought to Harry did they start cooperating.  Police,FBI, and National Security - They couldn't have cared less.  Harry was their employer, leader, and brother.  Things only got real for them, when they saw Harry needed them.

2 shuttles were sent to the asteroid, each with the necessary equipment.  One was lead by Harry, the other by AJ.  Harry's shuttle had a rough landing, AJ's crashed completely.

AJ's team had to escape the from the shuttle wreckage.  Then had to drive nearly 30 miles across the asteroid.  That journey included using the asteroids low gravity, to jump over a massive canyon.  Harry's team was forced to drill in an area with high iron content.  Drilling through that burned out his drill before he drilled deep enough.  Then to everyone's delight the AJ's team arrived, bringing their own drill with them.  Together Harry and AJ successfully drilled to the required depth.

The climax is always thrilling.  Harry stays behind to blow the asteroid.  He sacrifices himself for the others and for Grace.  The asteroid is blown in half, the 2 pieces miss the Planet.  Then the crews return to Earth.  The crews reunite with the loved ones and are celebrated across the world.  The end credits have pictures of AJ and Grace's wedding.",1457740800,,2032,4.896755162241888

Yes the science is pretty bad, but it's not a documentary, it's fiction and it's fun. It's an entertaining movie with comedy, romance and thrills and even a bit of thriller in there I guess.
It's one of those movies that I just had to have in my collection and I got the Blu-ray version and am very happy with it, it's crystal clear with excellent audio.
The actors work, even with Bruce Willis trying to do a southern style accent, at least I think that's what he was going for, but it works.
Michael Clark Duncan is a favorite actor of mine and it's sad he died so young and he's great in this movie, a bit of comic relief with him, he always plays great parts I think.
I've never cared for Ben Affleck personally and Liv Tyler isn't the best actor but provides some eye candy anyway. Then again this isn't the type of movie where you would expect the acting to be Oscar worthy anyway o they play they parts and it works out in the end.
Great action/comedy/romance/sci-fi/thriller style movie overall.
If you're looking for stuff based in science then look elsewhere and just enjoy the show as it was meant to be enjoyed. If you're looking for some meaningful story line then go somewhere else, if you're looking for some fun to just get away from real life then this is it. It's an action movie at its heart, it's science fiction and it's not meant to be taken seriously.
I don't know, I'm just tired a reading reviews form people getting down on this movie as unbelievable story and plot holes and this and that, it's fiction, it's meant to be entertainment, it's not meant to teach you about astrophysics and space travel etc, it's a fun movie. I don't see people ripping apart Star Wars as an unbelievable story or plot, and yes I love Star Wars too.

999896,5,6305169187,"I, as i'm sure apply's to many of you, just love these apocalyptic type movies with bucket loads of special-effects.
The story tells of a giant 'Asteroid' hurtling toward earth with little over a couple of weeks before impact, a 'team' are gathered together, put through a 'crash' course training regime to enable them to travel into space ,along with an experienced crew, land on the Asteroid shifting through space at 22,000 m.p.h., drill a '800 ft deep hole then plant the 'Nuclear Bomb' to separate the Asteroid, then...try to escape before detonation........not a huge task ?
'Bruce Willis' leads the cast list as 'Harry Stamper' - 'Liv Tyler' plays his daughter 'Grace' 'Ben Affleck' plays 'Grace's' suitor and
fellow 'driller' and mission companion to 'Harry'
This is an exciting and tense roller-coaster ride, maybe a bit 'gun-ho' as many of this type of films are, but putting that aside...it's great fun......'great 'Blu-ray' material.

Most haters complain that it's not scientifically accurate.  Yes, there are many scientific inaccuracies in this film.  However, this is a popcorn flick meant to entertain, not a documentary.  The other common complaint is the hyper-active editing where most scenes last only seconds.  I can see how this may turn some off, but it doesn't bother me and keeps the pace fast for this rather long movie.  I love this movie because it's full of action, comedy, adventure, and gets very emotional at the end.  Some of the visuals are truly spectacular, and it has one of the best original music scores of any film I've ever seen.  The music really gets the emotions flowing.

1000213,5,6305169187,"This was a big budget Hollywood special FX extravaganza with some big name stars in it and a decent soundtrack to boot, both the score and the music borrowed were terrific.
As for the movie? It's raining meteors, the shuttle gets destroyed, NYC is left in shambles and they find out an asteroid the size of Texas is coming in 18 days to destroy us and inbetween, there are meteor strikes in various spots as NASA prepares Bruce Willis and his team of oil drillers to journey up to the asteroid to drill a hole 800 ft to drop a nuke in to split the thing in two and avert disaster.
That being said, someone said this was the worst film they have suffered through, I've seen films of this genre that were an abomination compared to this one. The problem with some people is, they set the bar too high for movies like this and are disappointed when THEIR CRITERIA FOR REALISM isn't met, it's a shame too because for what it is, this is an excellent movie.",1439251200,,952,4.324022346368715

Easy right, not exactly, this movie is very well paced out with lots of action and lots of drama, the cast is perfect all round which helps make the movie enjoyable and believable, Bruce Willis is the perfect actor for saving the world, great roles too from Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler, Michael Clarke Duncan, Ben Affleck, the action is tense and really thrilling, Michael Bay style is always over the top and crazy yet totally entertaining, there is some good humour in the movie too, the effects are all top notch of course and still look great even compared to todays standards, and of course the soundtrack score is epic and makes the scenes even more dramatic! if you want a great disaster movie then this one is always worth going back too again!

believable and hit close to home while the action is great and not
over-thought. Some of the props do raise questions, such as why have
bulky AND HEAVY machine guns in space? Great fun for the story so maybe
I am looking a little too closely. The question we all must think about,
could we sacrifice ourselves to save others? Anyway, lots of action,
good human story line and a well done cliff hanging conclusion. This

This movie is filled with explosive action, suspense, and some humor. The riveting story grabs your attention in the very beginning, and keeps it until the final curtains close.

This is one of those movies we can watch over-and-over, and still enjoy. Special Effects are awesome, and highly entertaining. This has become one of our old-time favorites for our growing collection of movies. Enjoyable, and highly recommended!",1415923200,,575,5.388888888888889

1000990,5,6305169187,"In life, there is one question you must answer before God.  That question:  Armageddon or Independence Day?  Go into any bar in America and you could start a riot by asking this question.  This actually happened to me one time.  The place:  Spanky's bar in Manyunk PA.  Some loud mouth was telling me to stop blatantly seducing ""his"" girl.  I turned to him and said, ""Fine bro, but let me ask you this, Armageddon or Independence Day?""  This blew his mind and started a discussion among all his friends on the matter.  Long story short, it was straight up Jets and Sharks going to battle with broken bottles, knives, wrenches, and awesome karate moves.

Armageddon is one of the greatest movies of our time.  B-Dub, check.  Ben Affleck in his prime, check.  ""This is a Russian Space Station!!!"" CHECK!  The story here is so crazy that it's awesome.  A meteor is coming to earth and about to go boom.  Some eggheads drum up some plan to get dudes who work on an oil rig to drill a hole in the meteor and blow up a nuke.  Lolz ensue.

Did I mention that Aerosmith features prominently in this movie?  Yeah, Liv Tyler is B-Dub's daughter and is Ben's love interest.  There's a completely so cheesy it's awesome scene in which Ben is cuddling with Liv outside talking about life and ""Don't want to miss a thing"" starts blasting.  It's incredible 90's cheese and I tear up thinking about it.

This movie also includes the greatest acting I have ever seen in my life.  Whoever plays the president of the United States was straight up robbed for an oscar that year.  In the scene the president gets news of the full extent of the devastation the meteor will cause on earth.  The camera then zooms into his face and he slowly turns and says, ""MYYYYY GOOOOOOOOOOOOOD"".  I challenge you to find better acting than that!

I summary, Armageddon is awesome and I recommend that you buy this dvd immediately.  Every time I watch this movie I gain another little nugget of awesome.",1415577600,,1966,4.537142857142857

1001446,3,6305169187,"If there is one positive thing about Michael Bay and his movies, it's consistency. From his very first film, it was clear what he was about: explosions, hot women and awkward humor. In almost 20 years, nothing has changed and upon watching ARMAGEDDON, it seems like this is probably his purest film marketed to the widest audience possible (since R-rated movies are limited to ages 17 and up). The story is about an asteroid which is headed towards earth. NASA recruits a team of deep core drillers to be trained as astronauts, so that they dig a hole in an asteroid where a nuclear bomb will be placed. Along for the ride is one of the most impressive ensemble casts ever, although a lot of them don't really get to do that much. Most of them are also nothing more than caricatures rather than fully developed characters. The best performances come from Bruce Willis as Harry Stamper, the leader of the drilling team, and Billy Bob Thornton as Dan Truman, the NASA guy who recruits Stamper in the first place. There's also Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi, Liv Tyler and several other recognizable actors who round out the cast. So, what worked? For starters, the filmmaking and cinematography was appropriately epic and restrained, especially compared to the hyper-kinetic style which Bay was to use with the Transformers movies. With the exception of a few intense sequences, one has a sense of place and the action is fairly easy to follow. This film also has impressive visual effects, probably the best that 1998 had to offer. Of particular note are some outer space asteroid sequences and a nicely done destruction of Paris. There was also rather good practical effects and use of miniatures, which was a nice change of pace from today's CGI-obsessed blockbusters. Moving on to where this movie falls short. One would think that with such a great cast that the movie would be outstanding as a result, and you'd only be partially correct. While the film does have a lot of individual moments that are funny, or touching, nothing really coalesces. Instead of fully-formed characters, you mostly have stereotypes and caricatures, which is rather sad for a movie that lasts 150 minutes. There's also a romantic subplot between Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler that could have been completely left out. Of course, then they wouldn't have had an excuse to include one of the sappiest songs that Aerosmith has ever recorded (and whose lead singer, Steven Tyler, is Liv Tyler's father). There was also some pacing issues, namely that the first hour compresses about two weeks of training, and then the remaining 90 minutes takes place over the course of about one or two days. And of course, we get all the standard Michael Bay-isms. There's a ridiculous amount of explosions, misplaced ""humor,"" leery shots of scantily clad women (from one scene in a strip club), upward facing camera angles and lots of slow motion (although not as much as some of his other work). Put together, the various ingredients which make up a Michael Bay movie do, for the most part, work here. It's not deep, and it's not trying to be either. This is popcorn entertainment at it's finest, and for sheer spectacle this is one of the best summer blockbusters ever made. That being said, I usually demand more of my movies and prefer not to have to turn off my brain very often to enjoy a movie. There are lots of people who absolutely love this stuff, but I'm not one of them. I thought it was passable entertainment, and certainly not one of Bay's worst (I'm looking at you, Transformers 2).",1403913600,,3555,4.763371150729336
1001447,4,6305169187,"This film was definitely action-packed.  But the errors regarding space travel were so numerous that NASA now tests it's managers-in-training by having them spot all the errors.  While I'm no space expert, some of the errors are pretty in-your-face.  So I'll just go ahead and deduct a star from the film's rating for that.  Otherwise, this film had plenty of action and explosions and some decent acting.  My favorites by far were Steve Buscemi and Michael Clark Duncan.  Buscemi was wonderfully funny throughout and I'm pretty sure there's a law that says that Michael Clark Duncan has always and always will remain awesome for all eternity...check the books...I'm pretty sure it's in there.  I also liked Billy Bob Thornton as he played a great straight-man in this extreme fish out of water action thriller...I totally believed him as he ran things over at NASA.

The special effects are pretty good.

The plot is silly, and the science is just absurd.

The character portrayed by Bruce Willis gives a pretty good heart tugging speech at the end before he detonates the A bomb he is figuratively sitting on (a bit of a plot spoiler, but nothing you should not expect).

Despite the many flaws in the movie, I enjoyed it. And that is what I really care about from most movies I watch - entertainment. I do not watch movies or TV to be educated or enlightened.

1001513,5,6305169187,"A global killer asteroid as headed to earth at 25K mph which will kill all life on the planet, including bacteria.  It can't be stopped.  There are 18 days before impact.  Nasa calls upon an oil-drilling team to fly with astronauts to the asteroid and plant a nuclear bomb 800 feet inside to cause it to split into two halves which will then fly by the earth.  Bruce Willis plays Harry Stamper who is known to be the world's best oil driller, taking on projects which others can't do.  His crew consists of ex-convicts, social rejects and hard-core testosterone-driven roughnecks, complete with tattoos, beer bellies and big muscles.  They fail every test Nasa gives them, but the situation is desperate, and Nasa certifies them for space flight.  There is extreme humor when they bandy with Nasa medical personnel over their physical conditions.  But there is one thing they have: plenty of GUTS.  One of the drillers is in love with Harry's daughter, and Harry shoots at him with a shotgun when he catches him in bed with the daughter.

The movie has action, romance, humor, drama, science fiction, tragedy, sentimentality and Biblical references.  It points out the real important things in life, with the ultimate action of self-sacrifice for loved ones.  It is fast-moving with excellent special effects and acting.  It even has a Russian cosmonaut involved to fully cooperate in order to save the planet we all are dependent upon.  He, along with most of the other characters, is critical in the success of the mission.  He becomes a great friend of the American astronauts.

This movie will make you cry and feel exhilarated at the same time.  It shows hope for humanity in the stark face of final destruction and the total end of mankind... It's one of my all-time favorites.  It's superb entertainment.",1398556800,4,1811,4.862745098039215

The quality was so bad that I did not understand anything from the movie and did ruin my experience. So, please if you are thinking of renting or buying a movie through Amazon Instant Videos think again, and save your money.

Leaving On A Jet Plane Lyrics - John Denver

Once again the world is threatened by Armageddon. A dangerous asteroid, it is heading straight for Earth. Our only hope will be to send a team of roughneck drillers to dig a hole big enough to place a bomb and shatter the meteor.

This movie is lots of fun on many levels. It is a parody of disaster movies; however the characters don't know that they are parody and play it straight. This allows us to have fun without having to listen to a bunch of campy over-the-top one-liners that don't match the movie. It's a father daughter story; and of all things the father would have to be Bruce Willis who brings his killer formula to the story and fits his part perfectly. The daughter played by Liv Tyler (before her The Lord of the Rings fame) adds a great catalyst to the story. The rest of the team is rounded off by contemporary actors of which you will recognize immediately.

The graphics and action both explosive and human will hold you to the end.

This movie is worth watching over again so you can see the nuances that were missed the first time through.",1393027200,3,1206,4.299559471365638
1001750,5,6305169187,"I have seen this movie many times and for one simple reason...it moves me.  Lots of people harp on the plot or characters, or science, etc.  But the simple point is this to me, it is entertaining and it hits on so many personal levels that it is impossible not to get caught up in the moment.  The fact is, that is the exact reason why I love this movie so much.  I WANT to get caught up in it.  I WANT to be moved.  I WANT to feel what I feel throughout this movie.  I think the characters are great, the plot is great, and the experience is unmatched.  If you want to pick it apart, that is your prerogative, but at the end of it all how can anyone NOT love all aspects of this movie?  It offers an emotional rollercoaster like no other and, even though it is very dramatic, that's the experience that I want.  If you allow yourself to simply be a viewer and enjoy it, you will find that it is entertainment at a level that is hard to find anymore.  It is...simply the best.",1393027200,,976,4.057591623036649

1001912,4,6305169187,"Bruce Willis puts on a spectacular performance in Armageddon.  This is truly a classic film.  I had to watch it in HD with the blu ray edition.  For those who have watched it a long time ago, and for those who haven't.  It is definitely worth purchasing the blu ray.",1386806400,4,266,4.26
1001913,5,6305169187,"There are as many summaries of the plot, opinions on the acting, music, portents as there are reviews here so I will only focus on the quality of the actual Blu Ray transfer and my rating is based upon that.  Often with technical reviews much depends upon the T.V. and home theater system the reviewer is using and how they see and hear things.  My own 7.1 system if quite esoterically high end and the monitor I am using is a Panasonic ZT 65"" plasma.
While I have watched the Standard Def DVD many times which was not badly produced at all, the Blu Ray is a significant upgrade. This review, however, is not a side by side comparison, that said, I wish Amazon would please separate the Standard Def, Instant Downloads and Blu Ray reviews from each other.  It would make it that much easier to find a review that fits your needs and interests.

VIDEO.
  Extraordinarily clean transfer with no artifacts that I could see anywhere.  Grain did not seem to be present nor was there any haloing saw during CGI scenes.  Blacks were extremely deep without sacrificing details in even the darkest of shots.  Contrast is excellent throughout the film.  Color grading appeared to be very normal, warm actually until they get to the asteroid where the color grading becomes decidedly cool with a very slight bluish tinge.  This is one of the better transfers to Blu Ray I have seen with Mbps rates generally averaging in the low to mid 30's.

AUDIO.
  The audio is a lossless 5.1 DTS MA HD which I wish also came with a 7.1 option.  Dialogue was clean and transparent throughout and there was no need to reset your remotes volume control due to audio roller coasting; it stayed consistently set.  Armageddon, in its own way, comes with one of the very best audios to be found.  All channels are widely used, especially so during the outer space action scenes.  In this case, discreet directionality steering of audio to the surrounds is found more with expansive ambient audio rather than small foley fx.  Unlike other films with fantastic audio directionality like U-571 or Das Boot where the surrounds discreetly use the dropping of a pencil or the ticking of a clock, Armageddon uses the massive sounds of the jets flying by left and right, meteorites whizzing by and exploding to fully immerse you in the scenario.  Armageddon has some of the very best ambient audio on any disc with not only front to rear but rear to front panning and a very engaging surround experience.

EXTRAS
  Not a whole lot, the Aerosmith music video, a trailer and teaser.  I really don't see any difference between a trailer and teaser.
The one really negative thing on this Blu Ray and many more are the 6 separate advertisements (they call them 'previews' for other films.  I really do hate these things as they just take up more room on the disc which causes for more compression of the actual film you are paying for.  Besides, who needs or wants advertisements for movies released ten years ago.

Despite the ads, the Blu Ray of Armageddon comes well recommended.
I do hope that this review has been of some help to you in deciding your purchase.

1001916,2,6305169187,"Loud noises; big explosions; huge special effects...Check, Check, and CHECK.  This film was made for the cable show ""Movies for Guys Who Like Movies"".  I can take a lot of liberties with reality when watching a science fiction movie, but this was a bit much (and this from someone who can buy off on the Transformers movie).  Michael Bay recently came out and spoke honestly (ie negatively) about the movie, which is a saying a lot.  After about half an hour, the film becomes a grouping of short, one liners, that are woven together to make a storyline that is too advantageous.  I am still waiting for the the day the Aerosmith song doesn't haunt my dreams.

It took a while to finally get the price down but it was worth the wait. This is also presented in the 2:35:1 Aspect Ratio which means you see the whole film as the Director intended it to be seen and not some 1:85:1 chopped up version. I can't comment on the Audio as I am currently listening through the tv speakers only. Yeah I know that sucks but what can I do? It sounds good to me anyway & will probably sound much better with the proper system. The Special Features are almost non existent. The only thing you really get is an Aerosmith video: A Trailer: and some Sneak Peaks. These people who put these movies out should be ashamed of themselves for not adding much more features. How sad.

1002154,5,6305169187,"I've always taken exception to the title of this movie.  Armageddon is the site of a battle of Biblical proportions, not a lazy generic term that's needlessly applied to every disaster known to man.  And in spite of a scary opening narration by Charlton Heston, this is not the end of times, just another gigantic asteroid on a collision course with Earth flick.
This movie is both frustrating and fun.  On one hand, the lack of reality is alarming, on the other hand, it's a frantic action packed thrill ride of destruction (both Shanghai and Paris are wiped in between a few comic bits!).  The high body count is implied but never dealt with.  The salvation of the world rests in the hands of a bunch of over-aged juvenile delinquents.  They're not fully developed characters; they're nonstop comic relief.  Everything about this movie is highly manufactured purely for effect.  A lot of shortcuts are taken to push the right emotional buttons.  And while everyone is at the height of cavalier distain, up pops some military subterfuge in a sneaky attempt to blow up the asteroid from without rather than from within, negating the need to place a lot of yahoos on the darn thing in the first place!  Everything about this movie is utterly preposterous.  It's an insult to common sense.  It's a chain reaction of impossibilities and momentum, nothing about it should work.

And this is the part where I say I absolutely love this wreck of a movie anyway.  It's junk food for the senses, a barrage of fancy technology placed in the right order.  The world is on the brink of annihilation but thanks to Bruce Willis, calamity is narrowly averted at the very last minute!  Yea!

It's corny, it's dumb, it's bereft of any artistic merit, but I do love to watch it every few years.",1371859200,,1777,4.680645161290323

Lol, okay maybe it suffers from too much modern blockbuster syndrome, but I couldn't help thinking that 1998's ""Armageddon"" was the 1990's ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" I visualize the sci-fi progression something like this:

1968: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/2001-A-Space-Odyssey/dp/B004L9GMBC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">2001: A Space Odyssey</a>""
1979: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Trek-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B000HZHBIM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Trek: The Motion Picture</a>"" (which towers alone in the Trek franchise -- a profoundly spiritual TRIUMPH)
1986: ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Aliens-Two-Disc-Collector-s-Edition/dp/B00012FXAE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Aliens (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)</a>""
1998: ""Armageddon""

Some might object that I omitted ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Star-Wars-Episode-IV-A-New-Hope-Two-Disc-Widescreen-Enhanced-and-Original-Theatrical-Versions/dp/B000FQJAIW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Star Wars: Episode IV - A New Hope (Two-Disc Widescreen Enhanced and Original Theatrical Versions)</a>"" (1977), but it really doesn't fit the list. Don't get me wrong, it's excellent for what it is, but it's just too kid-oriented.

In any event, I hated ""Armageddon"" in the late 90s and never cared to see it again. My dislike was a combination of the whole ""blockbuster"" syndrome with its fast-editing to please those with ADHD approach and, believe it or not, Roger Ebert's scathing denouncement, which illustrates the power of words.

Well over a decade later I picked up a copy earlier this year (super-cheap) and finally viewed it a couple nights ago. Wow, was I entertained! Despite my dislike of fast-editing techniques, the story pulled me in right away and held me to the end. Yeah, some of the melodrama is too much, like Willis' scene with his daughter (Liv Tyler) near the end (rolling my eyes), but the filmmakers actually put some depth into the story and it mixes well with the action and humor. Their best move was to focus on character so that we knew and identified (with) the many individuals before the last hour's non-stop suspense and action kicked-in.

Speaking of the humor, there are some laugh-out-loud lines, like the one on not paying taxes, ever.

Furthermore, the star-studded cast is great and I especially appreciated the inclusion of Keith David and Michael Clarke Duncan (RIP).

The film is rather long at 2 hours and 31 minutes (the DC adds two additional minutes), but the story maintains your attention and the suspense, action and F/X are literally senses-shattering.

FINAL WORD: Yeah, it's a shameless, over-the-top ""blockbuster,"" but it tries so hard to entertain that you can't help but respect it. Besides, in addition to the disasters, action and humor, there's some actual depth to the characters and story. Take, for instance, Willis' character stumbling upon Affleck and Tyler during an intimate moment where Affleck literally covers her with kisses while she just eats it up. Willis stops, looks, and reconsiders his stubborn position. Then you know why he does what he does at the end.

For the first (and only) time, actors were given NASA's permission to use the multi-million dollar high-tech outfits. Previously restricted NASA facilities, such as the buoyancy lab and closed-down launch pad where the 1967 Apollo 1 disaster occurred, were made available. Filming was also allowed on top of a space shuttle launch tower and on an actual deep water oil rig.

SYNOPSIS--
A life-killing asteroid hurtles towards Earth as two drilling teams try to save the planet by landing on the massive boulder, burrowing 800 feet into it and implanting a nuclear device. Humor-laced but overlong disaster flick fails in part due to touchy-feely subplots, one of which is a boring romance between Affleck and Tyler. Stormare's pushy Russian cosmonaut is great fun, as is Buscemi's space-demented turn as super-genius and super-sexed Rockhound.

(6.4) Armageddon (1998) - Bruce Willis/Ben Affleck/Liv Tyler/Steve Buscemi/Billy Bob Thornton/Will Patton/Michael Clarke Duncan/Owen Wilson/Shawnee Smith/Charlton Heston (narrator",1352160000,,1361,6.345945945945946

1002560,5,6305169187,"This movie is very farfetched for a semi Sci-Fi movie but I loved the action and the roles the actors played. It is entertainment and not a science lesson and from that aspect I enjoyed it.

The movie opened with a narration of the asteroid just 6 miles wide hitting the Earth and killing all of the dinosaurs on Earth 65 million years ago. Now an asteroid the size of Texas is heading towards the Earth and it will arrive in only 18 days. This will cause a global extinction event and this time we are on the list of creatures to become extinct!

A plan is developed to place a nuclear bomb deep into the asteroid to try to detonate it and beak it into two chunks that will miss the Earth. (I know, it's not possible but it is a movie for entertainment) NASA has the spacecraft and equipment to get there but not the drilling know how. Since the schedule is so tight they are forced to use the best deep sea oil drilling team to have them train the astronauts on how to use the equipment. Time is of the essence and they wind up sending the misfit drillers into space to get the job done.....

This movie is funny, exciting, and full of action. It is not the best movie out there but it is so entertaining that it makes up for its shortcomings. The cast is an all-star cast with Bruce Willis, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson and Michael Clarke Duncan. Throw your science books away, put your brain in neutral, get a bowl of popcorn and a coke and enjoy yourself.

1002565,3,6305169187,"Facts that can be learned from watching Armageddon:

* Fire doesn't burn in a vacuum; it rages.
* Mir is capable of generating artificial gravity.
* It can be daylight in the U.S. and the Middle East at the same time.
* Space vehicles come equipped with machine guns.
* A stellar object 1/50 the size of the Earth can generate similar gravity (except when somebody  jumps).
* A single nuclear weapon is capable of splitting a piece of rock 500 miles in diameter.

Anybody who complained about inaccurate science in Deep Impact should best stay away. The science in this movie is nothing less than laughably absurd. However, while the science may be more accurate in Deep Impact, this is the more enjoyable movie. That's because it's a lot more fun to see meteors crash into buildings than it is to see Elijah Wood trying to emote.

The plot has Ben Affleck fall in love with Liv Tyler whose father, Bruce Willis, has a major problem with their romance for some reason. They are also oil drillers. This is important because an asteroid the size of Texas is heading for earth and only Willis can stop it. By drilling a hole 800 ft. deep and dropping in a single nuke. This will split the asteroid down the middle, allowing both halves to miss the earth while vaporizing all the smaller chunks of asteroid which have been striking the earth's major cities, thereby preventing the destruction of the earth and any more major cities. Oh yes, Bruce Willis also gets a very sad and noble death sequence. (Who else but Jerry Bruckheimer would come up with the idea of a testosterone tear-jerker.)

It goes without saying that this is a very silly movie. But it's much more of a manly movie. It celebrates manliness and the love of macho activities like getting into drunken brawls at strip clubs. You will see more acts of testosterone driven sexual insecurity than if you dropped my high school football team into the middle of a gay pride parade. Sample dialogue ""This b**** needs drilling."" (The 'b****' is the asteroid. Just in case you had other ideas). Almost everyone in this movie is male. Liv Tyler doesn't have much purpose except cry, look emotional, and as an unsuccessful attempt to make this movie about anything other than manly-men trying to prove their d**ks are bigger than the asteroid.

This movie is pretty bad but it's also a lot of fun if you're in the mood for this kind of thing",1338940800,,2395,4.610328638497653

I despise Michael Bay to the point where I want him dead for ruining the Transformers cartoons with his shenanigans. The only good movie he did besides this bestie was The Rock. Everything else he did after those is average to nothing really.

Armageddon is a doomsday disaster movie consisting of a damn-near ridiculous plot, but aims to be a realistic movie in terms of emotion, love, connection and outstanding reminder that life is short. When a N.A.S.A. director finds out an asteroid the size of Texas is due to hit and obliterate Earth in 18 days, it turns out Earth's survival will be on oil drillers who must take to the asteroid, drill a nuclear bomb in its core and detonate it before its too late.

1002633,5,6305169187,"I've waited a long time for this movie to come to Amazon Video on Demand and in November, 2011 it finally did.

I'll be honest, I don't buy many movies on blu-ray, even less through Amazon Instant Video. But I am an Amazon Prime member, have a Kindle Fire, like Bruce Willis and am a Sci-Fi/Fantasy movie fan. So what makes a movie like this worth buying on Amazon Instant Video or on blu-ray? Several things: great story, excellent actors, great acting, amazing visuals, top-notch picture quality and sound (The blu-ray is rated at the GOLD LEVEL for picture quality by avsforum dot com).

What makes this movie worth buying for $10 on Amazon Instant Video. Let's start with: Exploding oil rigs, asteroids flying through outer space, a space shuttle sling shotting around the moon, police chases, gambling casinos, a dramatic crash on an asteriod, an exploding space station, fiery asteroid fragments with smoking tails hitting the earth plus some gorgeous sunsets/skies/panoramas shots. And although the surface of the asteroid and even the Earth control center are semi-dark areas, the use of smoke and white, blue and green lighting to create atmosphere is perfect. Everything in this movie is about visual detail, color and sound. When you watch a movie like this, it's a delight to the eyes. Everything looks good and you find yourself almost wanting to watch it alone because you don't want to miss out on a single visual shot. Good re-watchability because there's so much to see you're bound to miss something.

By the way, this movie also looks great on the Kindle Fire. Since the movie is not available for rent as of this post date, at least if you buy it you can download it to your device.

I shook my head and just giggled at silly inaccuracy after silly inaccuracy, but I was enjoying the film too much to care. The characters are familiar. They've all been seen before, but that doesn't mean we can't enjoy them again with the right framing and casting. This is not a classic movie for the same reason Citizen Kane is a classic. It does not hold any appeal as a work of art. This film is valuable purely as entertainment for entertainment's sake.

We can see the reviews, see the plot holes and how incoherent they really are, how bad some of the acting is, and yet we remain nostalgic for these films. Armageddon came out during the summer after my freshman year of high school; a time when I didn't care whether a film's scientific principles were in line with reality and plot took a backseat to action. Having said that, I would still argue that Armageddon is possibly Michael Bay's second best film after The Rock.

I'm sure you already know the plot for this film but here's a recap just in case: Earth is threatened by an asteroid the size of Texas and NASA director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) is tasked with finding a way to keep this asteroid from obliterating life on the planet. In desperation he turns to the best oil driller he could find, Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), and his team to land on the asteroid and implant a nuke into the asteroid to blow it apart and avoid hitting the planet.

If anything Armageddon is a fun movie. A large part of the reason for this is the cast, in particular Stamper's team of oil drilling misfits which includes: Ben Affleck, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, and Ken Hudson Campbell. The interactions between these roughnecks and the scientific community at NASA is what brings out a lot of the humor in the story, and the script co-written by JJ Abrams (Lost, Alias, Fringe, Star Trek, Mission Impossible 3) mines that territory for all that it's worth. I also feel the need to give a shout out at this point to the always brilliant Peter Stormare (Fargo, The Big Lebowski) as the vodka soaked cosmonaut Lev Andropov, he's quite hilarious!

Not all of the performances hit the proper marks though. Ben Affleck does an overall serviceable job, but at times his performance is slightly over the top when he veers into more comedic territory which doesn't help with blending the character into one cohesive whole. The worst offender though is Liv Tyler, who in my opinion has only proven to be a fully competent actress in the Lord of the Rings trilogy. Her ""performance"" ruins an emotionally climactic scene toward the end of the movie.

Michael Bay's sense of patriotism has always proven to be a blessing and a curse when it comes to his flicks. On the one hand he ends up getting a lot of help from the government, which here meant a lot of unbridled access to NASA facilities and even some of their developing technology from the time. This access allows for a sense of authenticity that some other filmmakers are unable to attain. At the same time though, he shows some ignorance when it comes to America's importance in global matters as we see the entire world listening to a presidential address on a global issue. Most Americans wouldn't be listening to the address let alone in other countries.

Being that this is a Michael Bay movie there's very little need to comment on the plot, if you go into a Bay film expecting anything less than an extremely over the top and somewhat implausible plot than you have no idea what you're getting into. It's a blessing and a curse of Michael Bay films, and it's really up to the viewer to determine at what level they can suspend disbelief. To me a bigger problem with Bay's direction, though, is his inability to set up establishing shots and to stop moving the camera. Sometimes setting up a single shot without movement allows more intensity than continuous movement, something that Bay rarely seems to understand.

All in all this is a serviceable movie, a lot of fun with great magnetic characters. The plot is over the top and slightly incoherent at times, but it's also packed with action and humor. For that reason I give it a partial recommendation, and that's still largely for nostalgia's sake. If you haven't seen it maybe you should give it a try.

2.5/5

1002709,4,6305169187,"The summer of 1998 was mostly unremarkable, with the majority of films failing to impress. The overblown Godzilla was a humongous letdown, as was Armageddon's rival Deep Impact. Armageddon came out champ of the summer season (along with Saving Private Ryan, Lethal Weapon 4, and There's Something About Mary). But none of these films managed to push past $217 million, which would be absolutely unthinkable now, inflation or not.

Despite the relatively low box office returns (just a smidgen over $200 million), the marketing machine for Armageddon was in our faces everywhere, and I feared it might burn-out audiences before release. I know I felt a little cynical when I went into the cinema that day, my expectations very low.

I've said before that Michael Bay does himself no favors. The man knows how to make a blockbuster, but he's utterly clueless when it comes to making a good film. Armageddon is the only film in his entire resume that I find watchable and entertaining, though he still should have held back some scenes (the notorious animal cracker love scene really should have been dropped).

A big boulder of iron ferite hurtles through space, knocking smaller meteors toward Earth (thinking of breaking a frame on a pool table). NASA recruits immature oil driller Harry Tasker and his band of roughnecks to go into space and nuke the comet before it ends all life our little blue planet. With an 18-day countdown it's going to be very, very close.

Although it took a total of 18 writers to staple the screenplay together, Armageddon succeeds in almost every area where Deep Impact failed, plus more. The soap opera is kept to a minimum while the action is ramped up, delivering one hair's-breadth escape after another, all to the sound of Trevor Rabin's amazing score, which the life blood of the movie. The huge cast of fine actors, the SFX, and the action would all be significantly inferior without Rabin's soaring tunes, which turn many of the key scenes into wordless music videos of visual storytelling.

That's not to say that the acting isn't notable. As a matter of fact, Bruce Willis is surprisingly effective, as is Will Patton, who rarely gets a decent role in mainstream movies. Though, as with Con Air a year before, Steve Buscemi owns every scene he's in (tying with Peter Stormare). Just ignore the horribly miscast Ben Affleck whenever he appears. He's the only real weak link of the movie, to the point where you ought to switch off during his screen-time.

As the only truly exciting blockbuster of the 1998 summer season, Armageddon defines a lackluster year, and elevates Michael Bay's classless resume. It's exciting, colorful entertainment, and none-the-worse for it.",1297641600,7,2709,4.942857142857143
1002710,2,6305169187,"Michael Bay's films are ones of disdain. Disdain toward the viewer and cinema itself. Throughout ""Armageddon"", as he does with his other films, Bay wastes no time in insulting the intelligence of the viewer with implausible scenarios (using a gatling gun, attached to a planetary rover, to shoot through the debris of a space shuttle), cliche imagery and dialogue (witness the scenes of Americana supposed to represent some non-existant ideal of this country found only in boring Norman Rockwell paintings), and his signature use of hyper-kinetic filming and editing. Bay's style of filming and editing, learned from his days as a commercial and ""Playboy"" director, eschew the conventional, letting a scene linger, allowing the viewer to take in the nuance and ""read"" the film for him or herself. Instead, Bay uses this hyper-kineticism to seemingly propel the plot forward, adding layer upon layer of absurdity which leaves the viewer no time to realize just what he or she is watching (and indeed may explain how people continue flocking to his films). It is to Bay's advantage that he does this, however. ""Pearl Harbor"", his following film, does away, for the most part, with this style of filming. Rather, Bay focuses on scenes, slowly taking in the imagery and actors. Doing so reveals Bay's films for what they are: disgustingly trite and with no substance or redeeming value whatsoever.",1295827200,3,1393,5.114035087719298

This movie shows a wide range of emotions that these people went through and how different people in the same circumstances deal with their fears or inadequacies some rise above them and others let them take over. When Bruce Willis lets Ben Affleck live even though Ben was willing to make the sacrifice it shows how much a father can love his child and I know that is one of Gods greatest gifts the love of our parents. No matter what we do they want us to be happy even if it means sacrificing their happiness or life for it. This part in the movie makes me cry every time I watch it.

1002776,4,6305169187,"If spacesuits used in ARMAGEDDON seem real, it's because they are! For the first (and only) time, actors were given NASA's permission to use the multi-million dollar high-tech outfits. Previously restricted NASA facilities, such as the buoyancy lab and closed-down launch pad where the 1967 Apollo 1 disaster occurred, were made available. Filming was also allowed on top of a space shuttle launch tower and on an actual deep water oil rig.

SYNOPSIS--
A life-killing asteroid hurtles towards Earth as two drilling teams try to save the planet by landing on the massive boulder, burrowing 800 feet into it and implanting a nuclear device. Humor-laced but overlong disaster flick fails in part due to touchy-feely subplots, one of which is a boring romance between Affleck and Tyler. Stormare's pushy Russian cosmonaut is great fun, as is Buscemi's space-demented turn as super-genius and super-sexed Rockhound. Both actors portrayed the kidnapper/killers in FARGO (1996).

1002777,3,6305169187,"This is very fun action scifi, with Willis as a macho driller with a heart who sets out to save the Earth from an asteroid crash with his crew.  The special effects are extremely good, with memorable scenes like the destruction of Paris, but also the landing in an alien asteroid field.  For realism, plenty of things go wrong in the desperate gambit.  There is a great subplot, in which his daughter, who stays behind, is engaged to one of his team with Willis' disapproval.  A lot comes out with that little melodrama, which shocks the dad and reveals a funny side that is always present with Willis and makes his films better than most.

REcommended.  This is not great scifi with some vision of the future, but it is  adventure as solid as the asteroid core they have to drill through.",1288828800,,789,4.514084507042254

1002779,1,6305169187,"I wanted to like this film. The special effects folks did their job well. But the script had less substance than a weekly action strip written for 10 year old boys in a Sunday paper. The dialog was a parade of pretentious Hollywood action film cliches. I went from wanting to like this film to rooting for the Astroid, hoping it would vaporize the building where this script was brainstormed by the ""writers"", and then skips to the director and producers' homes - with their families gone of course - on some vacation. The dialog got so tiring I almost muted the rest of the film so I could at least appreciate the special effects. What a waste of something I suspect was a decent story until the movie folks got their hands on it before production. I would find it hard to believe the original story wasn't shredded apart by rewriting pin heads. The film was so awful I actually had to throw in my 10 cents, and made a mental note to avoid the director's work in the future. Unless, of course, I was a 10 year old boy again. I hope this fellow grows as a writer who develops a sense of reality regarding how people really talk to each other. Having a film with a script like this validates the perception of how patronizing, pandering, and out of touch Hollywood really is. I have only done this once or twice in 52 years, but if I had paid money at a theatre to see this instead of renting it, I would have asked for my money back.",1287014400,3,1433,4.291512915129151

And, just as I remembered, it's one terrible action movie cliche after another with a preposterous save-the-world plot, dramatic CGI destruction sequences of world landmarks (weird to see the World Trade Towers standing, and undamaged, in the opening moments) and plenty of superfluous stuff that blows up ... It's also really good, blockbuster fun that--I'm a bit ashamed to admit--always makes me cry (the little boy who doesn't know his father kills me every time), even when I KNOW it's shamefully manipulating my emotions.

Seriously, I think this might be the best-ever example of a summer, popcorn save-the-world movie. Great, cheesy fun that holds up, even a decade after its release. It walks that line between action, humor and emotional excess perfectly ... Unlike basically everything else director/producer Michael Bay has ever touched. (<cough cough> Transformers ... Ugh!) Sure, Ben Affleck (whom I've actually liked in lots of other things) and Liv Tyler are pretty terrible, but the rest are perfectly cast, including Bruce Willis (this movie reminded me why he really is a movie star), Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Busemci, Will Patton and even Owen Wilson who, frankly, I'd totally forgotten was in this film. Somehow they manage to deliver dialogue that would induce eye-rolling coming from just about any other actor and make me actually believe the absolutely ridiculous things they are saying.

The scene where Willis visits his father explains the ""God gave us children so we would have roses in winter."" With the storage capacity of blu-ray the only reason I can think of for them leaving out the extra footage is they want to package another blu-ray verison later and get us for another $20-$30.

1002852,3,6305169187,"Armageddon and Deep Impact were released back in 1998, and ever since they were seen in theaters, these two films have been compared by both critics and audiences. It's because both deal with meteors, space travel, and the possibility of human extinction. Critics seem to favor Deep Impact more, while audiences appear to prefer Armageddon. I don't think that these two films can be compared, because both of these films are drastically different from each other. Deep Impact is more of a human drama, while Armageddon is more of a Hollywood-style action film. But in the end, both films aren't very great; they're more average than they seem. They have their flaws, but they also have some very good material in either the plot or the action. Let's first take a look at Armageddon.

Michael Bay is notoriously known for creating mindless action films such as Bad Boys II and the live-action Transformers films. I do like The Rock (one of my favorite action films), but the rest of his films aren't much to me. I think Armageddon is better than Transformers, but it's certainly not as great as The Rock. The special effects do look great, particularly the NY meteor shower and the asteroid rockstorm. Most of the action scenes, however, feel like filler. For example, the scene in which the Russian space station is about to explode could have easily been taken out of the movie as it kind of detracts from the story. The dialogue in this movie is pretty silly. Lines such as ""I've been drilling holes in the Earth for thirty years, and I have never missed a depth that I aimed for,"" can unintentionally raise a few eyebrows. And also, did we really need that Affleck/Tyler romance subplot? It's not necessarily corny, but it is unbelievably boring.

I guess you can say that Armageddon isn't really a bad film. It has some spectacular moments of action and suspense, most of the characters (especially Buscemi's) are likable, the special effects look amazing, and the music is really nice to listen to. But of course, the silly dialogue, the unimpressive romance, and much of the filler scenes keep this one from being a great film. In the end, this film is adequate at best. It has its flaws, but it's still watchable.

1002853,1,6305169187,"Armageddon is in the running for worst sci-fi movie of all time, if not one of the top 10 worst movies in general.  There is SO much that is either factually wrong or just plain impossible here that this is ***fantasy*** -- NOT sci-fi!  You might as well be dealing with talking dragons and Vikings with ray guns.  Preposterous plot, trite dialogue, and not one credible performance, either, save for poor, struggling Liv Tyler (struggling against the lousy script, that is).  The *really* annoying thing about this film is that some people who have seen it think that any of this absurd plot can really work in space.  Sheesh!!!

If you want truly entertaining futuristic fantasy (that is, devoid of any attempt to even hint at reality), watch The Fifth Element instead:  at least that film can laugh at itself and has some good lines.  Armageddon is nothing but hackneyed melodrama that gets just about everything wrong, and its plot is based on an impossible 'solution' (and a really dumb one at that).  Only the completely scientifically illiterate wouldn't be disturbed by this flick.  Armageddon requires not just suspension of disbelief but complete suspension of taste, good sense, and the laws of physics, too.  It's no longer entertainment when you find yourself yelling at the screen because of the sheer stupidity you're forced to watch here.  Give yourself a break and instead of Armageddon, re-watch a really worthwhile film -- 2001: A Space Odyssey -- and leave *this* mishigas in the trash where it belongs.",1270771200,7,1523,4.929411764705883

1002884,1,6305169187,"I mean that literally, as my reviews keep getting taken down.  Maybe the list of unacceptable language has expanded.  To try hard to stay within the boundaries, apparently I am reduced to saying that I profoundly disliked this film.  It appeared to be a cynical manipulation of a large segment of the public, using thickly-strewn special effects, rapid cuts, and a tremendous number of cliches as a substitute for an actual story, plot, believable characters, and some sort of dramatic tension.  Almost every previously-used stereotype in history shows up somewhere in this rather bad movie, including stereotypes of fathers, minorities, eggheads, Americans, women, and if they could have found a way they would have stereotyped the asteroid as well.  The behavior of the characters obeys no logic recognizable on the planet Earth, except the logic that says ""You must behave this way next, so that we can use the next cool special effect.  Yeah, take this machine-gun to an uninhabited asteroid.  We know that it makes no sense, but shooting and blowing things up appeals to a large segment of the viewing public, so we're throwing it in.  And, based on our marketing research, you'll be flying the Shuttle in a tuxedo and bow tie while carrying a silenced Beretta in a shoulder holster.""  As a result, this ranks with Jaws 3-D and My Dinner with Andre as the only three movies I have walked out on before they finished.

The story is that Ben Affleck asked the director if it wouldn't make more sense for NASA to teach astronauts to drill a hole, rather than trying to teach a drilling crew to be astronauts.  The director reportedly told him to shut up.  Now I ask you: What has America come to, when Ben Affleck becomes the voice of reason?",1268438400,4,1744,4.776666666666666

I am no astronaut, nor do I work for NASA or even worse ever read a book about space, and yet I found load of things  when I saw this in the movies 12 years ago that it was impossible for it to happen, but yet since it is for entertainment purposes I tried not to care much for it. The asteroid shower being all of a sudden unexpected in the beginning of the film can be an insult to moviegoers IQ and the fact that you have to drill in a huge asteroid -supposedly the size of Texas- a warhead in order to destroy `the bitch' might be as well too fiction, but in the long run it is a typical blockbuster film and not a documentary from the Discovery Channel.

This movie has one of the craziest and most implausible plot points in movie history. They get great actors to sound excited about the perils and pitfalls of drilling into the hardest metal imaginable on an asteroid headed for earth. The U.S. Space Shuttles can barely reenter our own atmosphere without pieces falling off of it. YET, they manage to land on an asteroid that makes Moab in Utah look like a safe haven for supersonic touchdowns. I'm going to ask my physics professor buddy about the actual effects of explosions or A-bomb detonations in an atmosphere of no oxygen. He said, no way!

This was my number #2 bad movie of all time until I rented a wacky space drama with NO movie stars at the Red Box machine, and the previous renter even wrote ""This is the worst movie ever"" right on the disc, it was. This movie entry gets knocked down to a tie with Day After Tomorrow as the third worst ever. Without really good actors here, I guarantee you that no one would ever have given Armageddon more than one star. It is ONLY star driven, and NOT a plot driven movie. If you call it a popcorn movie deluxe, better add in plenty of cocktails with that buttery treat, and a good nap before it is over. Reviewers and fans hate giving movies bad reviews that have good actors being caught in bad movies, because they have done good or great movies. Billy Bob, Willis, Buscemi, Duncan, and more stars, have made classic movies in their own right.

The number three worst ever, I'm watching it right now, until something better falls on my head, Day After Tomorrow. Fun scenes of diaster in 5.1 sound, but ridiculously unbelieveable. You ask, what is the worst, The Core. Same scenario, great actors doing scenes that you couldn't dream up in a million years.

And that makes it so much more unique and fun to watch because no other end-of-the-world movie takes themselves less seriously than this one. I hate watching a movie and being preached at (like ""2012"" did.) Instead, ""Armageddon"" removes itself from the equation and the producers, writers and director were all intelligent enough to realize that this is a movie, and people want to be entertained.

Bruce plays Harry, an oil driller who is recruited by NASA to go into outer space to save the world from destruction. Bruce played this role as he did any of his other signature characters with perfection and precision. Even though he wasn't in every scene (there is a very long list of very talented actors in this, including Ben Affleck) his presence could always be felt. And in the scenes that Bruce was in he almost stepped back and let the others take control, his larger than life persona did not overtake any of the other cast members. Only a very generous and humbled man could accomplish such an endeavor. But like they say, slow and steady always wins the race.

Once Harry tells the NASA head (Billy Bob Thornton) that he needs his team to get the job done the fun in inner space really starts. His entire team (everyone from Steve Buscemi to Michael Clarke Duncan) were all hysterical. The story was so ludicrous and implausible that you just have to laugh at it.

*Spoilers*

If I were rating ""Armageddon"" based on the first 45 minutes or so alone, I'd probably give it a solid four stars, maybe even five. The movie starts strong, with a canny blend of immediate disaster and relevant exposition (as opposed to some disaster movies that force you to sit through 30 minutes of character set-up before you get a whiff of nature-turning-sour) alongside humorous character introduction. The triangle between father, daughter, and lover is an amusing one, and Tyler in particular shines as she balances a complex tightrope of emotions - distance and frustration, anger, worry, and a touch of amused contempt. The high note continues as the obligatory Introduction/Recruiting scenes start rolling, and the film is canny enough to drape everything in over-the-top humor - the men want to be reimbursed for their efforts by knowing ""the truth"" about JFK, having their parking tickets overturned, and being taken permanently off the IRS rolls. Even better, Billy Bob Thornton plays the straight man to all this and plays it well, highlighting the wacky fun and exposition.

Unfortunately, about the time after lift-off, the amusing chuckles become less frequent. Frankly, the movie's biggest failing here (in my opinion) is the decision to put so much focus on Affleck. I've got nothing against the man as an actor, but the entire set-up with him being sectioned off with the crazy Russian astronaut solely and specifically for the purpose of him (a) ramping over the moon Dukes-of-Hazzard style and (b) climatically showing up at the last moment when everything has conveniently broken is just so much tedium and is far too long. Frequent shots back to Thornton and Tyler on earth are included here to heighten the tension, but without Willis to play off of, the shots fall relatively flat and begin to occur too frequently.

Ultimately, ""Armageddon"" is a decent disaster film, and probably one of the best known, but I find I can no longer sit through the entire movie without fast-forwarding through a good deal of the filler middle. I can't help but feel that the final product would have been better if all the side stuff with Affleck had been cut - either such that he was never separated in the first place, or such that his trek back to the others takes place largely outside of the actual movie. I understand wanting to ramp off of moon cliffs as a director - after all, it's cool and it was also probably intended as comic relief - but ultimately I just feel that ""Armageddon"" is a little too long and a little too bloated at the middle, despite the strong beginning.

Most Americans don't care if the gravity was accurate or not.  They made us believe the rotation of the asteroid gave a certain amount of gravity.  It's a movie and not a documentary.

1002975,4,6305169187,"Earth is in trouble once again. An asteroid the size of Texas is headed straight for our planet. Life will be extinguished once it hits. Every plan that NASA or any government agency from any country seems futile. Except one. The plan is to drill 800 feet into the asteroid and drop a nuke down there to blow up the asteroid from the inside and hopefully ejecting the pieces far enough from each other to completely miss Earth. Though NASA is trained in many things and are geniuses at many things, drilling is just not their forte. So they look for the number one driller in the country... Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis). Harry runs an oil rig out in the ocean with his rag tag crew along with his daughter. Wherever he goes, they go. So when NASA proposes/begs for Harry to help them, he says he'll do it as long as the rest of the crew comes with. With only 17 days until the asteroid hits, they have 12 days to train and then launch into space along with actual astronauts to dig a hole into a rock and blow it up.

Michael Bay, whether you love him or hate, can put some crazy action scenes together. Sometimes they are really good, and sometimes they are edited just enough to where you can't really see what's going on. I am a sucker for a Michael Bay film though. I'll watch them all. I might not like them all, but I will watch them all. I liked Transformers, yet I hated it also. And I'll definitely see Transformers 2. I know the man isn't the best director in the world but I'll go into his movies every time shutting my brain completely off and enjoy the heck out of some crazy intense action scenes.

The first time I saw Armageddon was about 5 months after I had joined the military. Group of us went to see this in the theaters, and every one of us sat back and enjoyed the ride. All the action, the funny lines, the military/NASA scenes, space, explosions, and hot women were everything us boys were looking for in a movie. Even today, while I've grown up over those last 11 years, it's still a fun ride. Eye rolling yes, but fun ride none-the-less. To really enjoy a Michael Bay movie, you really do have to throw reality out the window. I'll give just ONE example of what I mean. While watching this the other night, me and my friend were commenting on the `things that just aren't right' in the movie and one was fire. There was fire in outer space. One of the space shuttles crash onto the rock and pieces of it were on fire. Really? There's no oxygen, but it was burning like a camp fire. I said it, my friend laughed, and then said ""let it go."" And that's what ya gotta do with these types of movies.

Though you can constantly pick out the bad from a Bay movie, there is just a lot that is usually good also, but people tend to try and ignore it, or just plain out don't care and just want to bash it anyways. Bruce Willis plays, once again, a great apple pie eating American hero. He's just made for it. And it works 100%. From his funny lines, to his `I won't take no for an answer' attitude, and to his sweet and protective fatherly moments... he's just the man. Liv Tyler is great as the `sort of angry at her father daughter, yet slightly shows it in her eyes that she loves him' daughter. She's great at the water works and definitely tries to pull the strings on mine when lets it go. Ben Affleck is definitely funny, but sometimes a little over the top. But it's ok with me because I'm a fan of Ben. Yeah I said it. I think he's funny. Watch some commentaries with him, especially with Kevin Smith (Silent Bob), on some movies he does, and you probably will bust out laughing. Because of his commentaries, and outtakes, and other little things he does, I've grown to like him more and more as an actor. Steve Buscemi is a god of course in just about everything he does and it's the same here. I didn't like the whole space madness thing at the end with him, but still, at least he's funny. It's not only the actors themselves that are funny, but the whole chemistry between them. Everyone just seemed like they were having a good time making this movie and it really shows when you see the groups of guys together doing whatever they are doing at that time.

I didn't watch most of the extras on this Criterion, but I did watch the outtakes (I always watch those). It was pretty funny, but wow there were a lot of F bombs. I don't mind at all, but I'm sure most do, so be prepared. Most from Billy Bob...hehe. And the trailers were pretty good to. I like how you think Armageddon is going to be some love story between Affleck and Liv Tyler, and then all of a sudden, BOOM, meteorites are flying through NY tearing it to shreds. Funny trailer.

In the end, if you like your popcorn summer action flicks where you don't really have to think that much, then step right up and watch Armageddon. I still love this movie to this day no matter how over the top and silly it can get.

P.S. When I watched this in the theater I was without about 10 military guys. One of the guys, who was sitting a row in front of me, started to sniffle and turn his head. I said ""Hey ""enter name here""... you crying man?!?!"" pretty loud and he said ""NO!"" with sniffles and tear wipes. Hilarious considering he's was one of those `I'm hard' types of guys.

Finally, they take off to intercept the giant pet rock from hell, but unfortunately, this is where the overabundance of prefab crises overwhelms any entertainment value the movie had in the early reels.

When I saw this film, it was apparent that no thought, no research, no intelligence went into the writing at all.  Let's start with the basic premise of the film. An asteroid is discovered and we have 17 days until it hits. What do we do? In the real world, we bend over and kiss our butt goodbye. There is absolutely *no* way a mission such as this could be planned, trained-for and executed in this time. 17 days wouldn't be enough time to prepare a standard shuttle launch, much less one with this type of mission. This movie blindly ignores this fact.  I am always distressed when films treat people as mere cattle, props to use while pounding a point home and then forget. In the open of the movie, New York is hit with a barrage of fragments, presumably causing untold death and injury. In the real world, people might even see fit to comment upon this with the people they meet. In Armageddon, this scene is presented as eye-candy (it *does* look pretty good) and then is promptly forgotten by everyone involved. No one talks about it. No one cares.  There is so much that is wrong with Armageddon. The science involved in splitting an Asteroid the ""size of Texas"" with a nuclear bomb implanted only 800 feet into surface (trust me, when you have driven 800 feet into Texas, you haven't driven very far.) The idea that that bomb could divert the two large fragments enough to cause them to miss the Earth in the time they had left. The amazing ""gravity"" on the asteroid.  The thing is, I can enjoy a good fantasy movie. Films do not always have to work by the rules of the reality I live in. I can accept ""The Force"" and other such fanciful ideas, as long as the movie is true to its own reality. But Armageddon chose to place itself in *our* reality, and should have attempted to follow the rules that apply here.  Put simply, this movie is pure trash. It was by far the worst movie I saw in 1998, a year rife with embarrassing tripe. Save your time, save your money, save your brain. Don't see it.",1224028800,2,2074,4.376623376623376

As for realism, yeah most of that stuff probably wouldn't fly realistically but if the only way to save our planet was to drill a hole in the sucker, would I prefer astronauts be given last minute instructions on how to drill or would I prefer some guy who has done it for years?

the misunderstood father, the misunderstood daughter, suspense, comedy,
the bumbling bureaucrats, the rough-edged construction workers and of course, highly improbable drama.  it's the full playbook crammed together, and because of that, it's virtually an educational guide about what not to do.  it's a total mess overall, and horrible science fiction, but grabs your attention here and there.

Armageddon is ultimate distillation of Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer's commercial action movie formula, a formula that they introduced in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Bad-Boys-Special-Edition/dp/B00004STUL/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Bad Boys (Special Edition)</a>, improved upon in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Rock-Criterion-Collection/dp/B000059TPN/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Rock - Criterion Collection</a>and finally, post-Armageddon, ran into the ground in Pearl Harbor.  Later Bay films like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Island/dp/B000BO0LH2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Island</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers-Two-Disc-Special-Edition/dp/B00005JPNO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers (Two-Disc Special Edition)</a>are informed by this formula, but none of them come close to this masterpiece of 1990s action.

As you almost certainly know, the plot of Armageddon involves a gigantic asteroid on a collision course with the Earth.  The only ones who can stop it are a rag-tag crew of oil drillers, who hitch a ride with some astronauts on a pair of fighter-jet space shuttles to blow the rock to bits with a well-placed nuke.  Sounds silly?  It is, and the film has a couple of winking acknowledgements of its own silliness.  Mostly though, the film believes in itself, and it is easy to become caught up in the (false) grandeur of the undertaking.

Lots of people will bad-mouth this film, but those people are movie snobs.  Armageddon was one of the most popular movies of 1998, and it was a defining element of the popular culture of the time.  Ignoring it just because you dislike its style or story is to put on cultural blinders.

Personally, I felt that Armageddon's most interesting cinematic characteristic is Bay's use of a kind of cinematic short-hand.  Much of Bruce Willis' character is defined by previous Bruce Willis movies, creating a kind of ready-made character who already feels familiar when he first appears.  Likewise, the sequences involving the military are largely understandable only because you know how the military acts in this sort of movie.

But the best example of this shorthand is the character of Billy Bob Thorton.  At one point he mentions that he was formerly in the astronaut program, but dropped out.  There is a very short, perhaps less than 1 second, shot of a pair of leg braces.  With just this flash of visual information, Bay has established an entire history for the character.  Anyone who says that Bay is lacking in cinematic skills is ignoring his great gift at conveying information in a fast, visual way.  A great example of showing, not telling.

This Criterion DVD has all the usual extra features you might expect, and they are as good as you might expect.  The DVD commentary is entertaining and informative, and Bay is quite open about his commercial and pragmatic sensibilities, such as the story he relates that a certain beauty shot of a car was included so that the car-maker would give him money to build a bizarre set that was not included in the budget.  Many of the cast members also contribute to the commentary; Ben Affleck is the highlight, obviously well trained from doing Kevin Smith commentary tracks.  Bruce Willis is as laconic as his reputation would suggest, but his few comments are sometimes hilarious.  This version of the movie is also slightly extended, with some scenes involving Willis' character's father, and a few slight extensions that add character beats to some of the minor scenes.  Nothing major.

The second disc has lots of interesting features on the making of the movie, a collection of deleted scenes and a few bloopers.  Most of the deleted scenes are comedy bits with the actors riffing in character, and all of them are entertaining but it is easy to see why they were cut out.  The best blooper is an appearance by Michael Eisner (Disney's Touchstone division produced the film), who tells Willis that his casting isn't working out and the studio is replacing him with Kevin Costner.

All in all, this is a fantastic DVD of a highly entertaining movie. Don't let the movie snobs shame you into not getting it.  If you enjoyed this movie back in the late 90s, you'll find plenty to still enjoy here.  It has aged very well, and, from a film history standpoint, this DVD set is almost a time capsule of the bloated studio action pictures of the time.",1217721600,4,4805,5.586206896551724

1002998,5,6305169187,"Armageddon when first released and viewed by the mass media was slated for it's unrealistic setting but was praised for its entertainment value. It's one of those movies that if you're going into it looking for scientific inconsistencies then you could genuinely write a novel on them, but if you're going into the movie looking to be entertained for over 2 hours then it will certainly deliver what you want. Ben Affleck, Bruce Willis, Steve Buscemi, Owen Wilson, the list goes on and on for really big name actors that helped generate the high box office takings and give us one hell of a reason to come out of the movie theatres smiling from ear to ear. The chemistry between Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler who played his daughter in the film was something to enjoy in itself but the alternate chemistry between Affleck and Willis was also something to really enjoy as Willis would constantly insult and chase Affleck away from his daughter.

The plot outline is simple, an Asteroid is heading towards Earth and if it hits it will destroy mankind as we know it, so a team of oil drillers must be sent up to the Asteroid to drill a hole in the Asteroid and plant a Nuclear device in the middle to destroy the Asteroid. The sub-plot is also simple, Harry Stamper (Willis) is the worlds best oil driller and while working on an oil rig his daughter Grace (Tyler) is in a secret relationship with A.J. Tyler (Affleck) but even with the dangerous risk of Harry finding out the love is destined to survive whether Harry likes it or not. When being requested by the NASA Administrator Dan Truman Harry would only agree to take part in the mission if the only people in the world he trusted could come with him, they only happen to be some of Americas biggest misfits.

The side characters including Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan & Owen Wilson really give us the comic relief of this movie and along with come of the more saddening scenes they have the ability to lift us up with their antics. Billy Bob Thornton plays his role as Dan Truman, the tortured soul with a broken dream well and puts the stamp of this character in our minds.

The CGI and other huge settings are great and make it at times over the top and yet they come across as realistic and cool. This is a genuinely fun movie but is something that in order for you to enjoy it you need to leave your brain at the door and just enjoy the swearing and destruction.",1213747200,,2420,4.470588235294118

1003000,5,6305169187,"If Norman Rockwell and Orson Scott Card had a child, in a bizarre new world, they would have written the screenplay for ""Armageddon"".  An uncompromising look at what goes into the word Americana, Michael Bay has crafted a story that is pumped full of so many clich&eacute;s that it becomes an entertaining, full-throttle action film that can be watched again and again.  With a surprising cast and superb special effects, Bay uses the camera to create powerful artistic images coupled with the staples of what makes films of this nature unique.  In this reviewer's eyes, ""Armageddon"" is one of those films where Bay has tricked the common audience.  It is a typical summer blockbuster in every sense of the word, there are explosions, there are great lines, there are out-of-this world scenes, but he does this while incorporating hidden messages throughout.  Perhaps I am looking a bit too deep into just another science fiction action film, but when ""Armageddon"" came through the DVD player, I wasn't ready.  I was a nay-sayer to Criterion for adding this film to their collection, but now - in 2008 - it makes perfect sense.  Michael Bay has created a picture-perfect image of America.  He has taken our desire for the inanimate, our non-perfect hero, slices of us through images of the Midwest (or of a time that we may have forgotten), and our religion to be the best and transformed it into a film.  Yes, this is a science fiction film, yes this is the film about the big asteroid that only Bruce Willis can stop, and yes - Ben Affleck does attempt to act - but it is perfection.  If our country was eliminated, and we needed a film for our history books - I wouldn't argue with ""Armageddon"".  Now, let's let the argument begin.

The acting, come on, it's ""Armageddon"" people, but Bay is notorious for at least creating enjoyable characters.  Buscemi is always worth the screen time, while Will Patton rounds out the voice of reason.  The looming voiceover by Charlton Heston seemed to suck me into the story, while Willis and Affleck's banter seemed over the top, and at times annoying.  They played their parts perfectly, yet it still had me on the edge of my seat.  Liv Tyler gave it her all, and the way Bay filmed her (less words more emotion) was perfect.  She carried the weight of her father and soon-to-be fianc&eacute; well into the asteroid.  Compliments should be handed to Mr. Thornton as well, the man has a pair of chops on him, and if he could avoid the angry comedian films, he could remember that he has the talent.  He was the epitome of NASA, the genius that had to work on the worst budget to save the world.  Rewinding back to the notion that this is America in all of it's glory, these characters work perfectly.  Willis' character reminded me of a mortal superhero.  His ability to drill anywhere was his power, and his sense of nationalism, his idea of patriotism, bled from the screen.  ""Armageddon"" played like a comic, with your muscling characters, cheap jokes, picture-esque landscapes, and simple fix to a big problem.  Again, it was clich&eacute; - all of these characters can be seen in any other film close to the same nature or entitled ""summer blockbuster"", but with Bay, he seemed to be saying more.  Affleck was the only downfall on the character side.  He was Ben playing Ben; there wasn't that sense of anything outside of comic timing and love interest needed.  He wasn't Bruce, he wasn't anyone except filler.  Yet again, for this film, it worked.

The story was simple.  Bay simply used the K.I.S.S. method to compile the script (the Keep It Simple Stupid), asteroid headed to Earth, nobody saw it, and it is up to Bruce to surrender to the beast.  It is Mr. Michael Bay that must be complimented for this film.  While other critics will argue that this isn't anything but drivel, I found it to be symbolic, surreal, and honest all at the same time.  While other films will show America in a way that only the educated will see it, Bay throws it right in our face and we are unable to stop it.  Golf on a cruise liner, Willis portraying this ""everyman"", the types of cars that our characters drive, the fact that upon completion of this task everyone want inanimate objects (power, sex, money), one cannot help but wonder what Bay is attempting to say about our culture.  Michael Bay is the director of gluttony.  I can attest that I couldn't stand this film upon viewing it the first time.  I was horrified to see it in the Criterion gambit, but watching it again - older and wiser with film - I am happy to see it in the collection.  ""Armageddon"" is America.  It is the birth of the superhero, it is the clich&eacute; Americana that we face everyday; it is exactly what makes American cinema - well - American.  Bay, in this film, has captured the truth.  What makes this summer blockbuster even more enticing is that there is just a sprinkling of explosions, and most don't happen until the final third of the film.  He has tricked us, made us believe that this is a no-brainer of a film, when it is in fact chalk full of symbolism that the faintest of film aficionados can smile under their breath.

Overall, as I begin to sound more and more repetitive, ""Armageddon"" [the Criterion release] blew my mind for the first time although it was my second viewing.  A new found respect for Mr. Bay's work has been discovered, and while ""Transformers"" will never live up the hype, the early work of Bay remain pivotal instruments in American cinema.  I am eager to re-watch again Bay's ""The Rock"" which also found a Criterion release, with skeptics on both sides.  The Norman Rockwell vision, the lack of any real science fiction until the third act, and the detail of the characters without devoting hours upon hours to them, made for strong - unparalleled cinema.  Students could study this film, they could ask themselves if this is the vision of America, if this is the Americana we all love - work hard, play harder and maybe, just maybe, you too could play animal cracker safari on some girl next to the latest BMW model.  Who doesn't believe this is the American dream?

1003001,3,6305169187,This movie starts off with some great effects and some good scenes featuring the drilling crew.  It sets up a very predictable plot and is not that exciting by the end.  But for a good price it is worth getting.,1207094400,,211,4.25
1003002,1,6305169187,"I have only seen this movie once. It been like early 1997, but that's only a good thing. Deep Impact came out the same time this movie did. Each movie recieved good reviews. Which movie would fair better for me?
It cannot really be a contest because Armegeddon was no where near good. My grandfather saw the movie with my father and I and even he thought it was terrible.

The movie starts off with a NASA Space Shuttle being attacked by little Flinstone size pebbles of a media, eventually getting bigger and destroying the shuttle. The plot is the same as Deep Impact. That is to destroy an asteriod to save Earth. If the space shuttle got taken out, I am surprised that the meteor didn't knock out the planet all at once. Deep Impact did not start offf with a Space Shuttle being destroyed. The scientists in that movie discovered by satellite that there was a big meteor storm coming; more reasonable than what hapened in Armegeddon.

What was worse about Armeggeddon is that it made fun of Earth's environment (in a way). There was this big huge muscular cowboy on board an oil tanker messing with his wrench. They had a golf tournament playing with a golf ball, hitting it from one oil tanker to the other in the middle of the ocean. Worse of all is when a bunch of hickey's got together to save the planet earth and some other disturbing scenes. I don't even want to talk anymore about the movie. It also discriminated against Deep Impact in a way and was not up to my expectations.

1003042,3,6305169187,"Armageddon is a movie that focuses too much on the over-dramatization of characters rather than on the plot.  For example, the scene between Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis where Affleck is supposed to detonate the bomb (thus sacrificing his life) and ""hero"" Willis decides to do the job is so over-dramatized that it almost becomes unbearable to watch.  Add to that, one of the beginning scenes has Willis shooting at Affleck because he found his daughter in bed with him and at the scene mentioned earlier, Willis is calling Affleck's character, ""my son"" and something to the effect of I have always seen you like my son?!!!!  That is just one example of the sort of over-dramatized scenes and over the top acting and characters.

I would recommend ""Deep Impact"" over this movie anytime because in my opinion, it is a more intelligent show and the focus is well-balanced between the plot and the actors.

1003043,4,6305169187,"The film opens with the twin towers standing proud and tall in New York City. We are in 1998. The US had not yet been the victim of that deep fit of terror fright which is just as frightening as space fright. It was a time when the US were already deeply obsessed by the end of the world (as always and ever in their short history), and since the USSR did not exist any more, and China was not yet seen as the new contender, they were exploring the danger from outer space anew. They could accept the idea of more or less showing a few Moslem pictures along with dominant Christian ones. The strict separation of religions had not yet reached Hollywood. The enemy that the US mind needs to be able to think the proper way was a big piece of rock coming from far far away in space and the size of Texas, read my lips of course. But why do the US always think the world as having to come to an end and why envisaging this end as having to be a fight, even against a piece of rock? If the world has to have an end, and it sure has to because nothing is eternal, why not prepare for death that may occur any time? If humanity has to have an end too and it will have an end since it had a beginning, why not just getting ready to meet that end in dignity? Why always see that end as a catastrophe? What's more why do the US always end at once thinking of themselves as the saviors of the world as soon as they speak of that end? The world will have to come of age and be able one day to face its future, no matter what, in other terms than a savior and a mass of repenting and grateful individuals? But the film is a lot more interesting when seen ten years after its shooting. The world can be saved by the human race itself. Good. We had not reached the great paranoia of climate change yet. To save the world one individual will have to sacrifice himself for it and that one is the father and not the son. That is a complete inversion of the Christian myth. But even better, in fact worse, that savior, that redeemer, that self-sacrificial person is a man, as if women were not yet of age for that kind of selfless sacrifice. But note that father has a daughter and there is no mother anywhere. Is it a sign of our times when families are broken up everywhere? Or is it a sign of the superiority of men, though there is another divorced couple with a son and the son is taken care of by his mother (inverted situation). So where is the real truth about this question? I personally have the impression that the film is ten years old and that in Hollywood they could ten years ago still produce such films that are definitely slightly male chauvinistic with just a light, very light touch of female liberation if not only female presence to avoid any gay ambiguity. Slightly pass, and also a little bit long as for the scenes on the meteorite.

1003044,5,6305169187,"In 1998, Hollywood was beginning to show interest in the impending new millennium, which led to a fascination with disaster films showcasing the end of the world, as we know it. The first film that year with this theme as its focus was the lackluster ""Deep Impact"" starring Morgan Freeman and Elijah Wood. This movie really failed to find much of an audience, mostly because it just wasn't all that exciting or entertaining. This was exactly the kind of reaction that Touchstone Pictures was no doubt hoping for, so that maybe their upcoming Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay collaboration called ""Armageddon"", starring Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler would find a much bigger audience, a more welcome reception, and hopefully gain huge box office success while avoiding the pitfall of its predecessor.

When meteorites bombard a team of NASA's astronauts during a space mission, resulting in NASA learning that a much bigger meteor is heading on a collision course with Earth. NASA's Executive Director Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton), with the authorization of the President of the United States, seeks the help of the world's most unlikely group of heroes, a team of oil drillers. This group of roughnecks, led by Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) is chosen to assist NASA in an ambitious endeavor to save the planet from impending doom by flying into outer space and blowing up the deadly asteroid. With time running out will these oil drillers succeed in becoming the heroes the world needs or will ""Armageddon"" prevail?

Where the movie ""Deep Impact"" failed to find an audience, Michael Bay's powerhouse action film ""Armageddon"" succeeded with flying colors. The impressive visuals, along with the dramatic, emotion-filled story, and talented cast of actors combined with Jerry Bruckheimer's ability to produce excellent action films, and Michael Bay's sleek sense of style and high-octane direction made this the must-see action film of the year.

The story though implausible, was very solid and highly enjoyable. Delivering to audiences an emotionally heavy action film that didn't feel too sappy or over-dramatic. The comedic elements sprinkled throughout served as nice reprieves from the intensity of the rest of the picture. Excellently written by J.J. Abrams (""Alias"" and ""Lost"") and Jonathan Hensleigh, ""Armageddon"" did a wonderful job of balancing visually stunning special effects sequences with plenty of story and character development, which no doubt served to make this one of the biggest disaster movies of all time.

The all-star ensemble cast of characters led by Bruce Willis was comprised of an impressive array of acting talent; from the veterans, Will Patton, Billy Bob Thornton, and Steve Buscemi to rising young stars Ben Affleck, Liv Tyler, and Owen Wilson. Every actor made each character fun and engaging, taking full advantage of whatever screen time his or her respective characters were given no matter how small. No character felt wasted or underdeveloped, and each actor/actress was given a decent character arc to make their characters more believable and accessible to the audience.

The visual effects were some of the best I had seen at the movies up to that time. Even with the advancements made in technology used in special effects today, I still don't know if anyone else could do the disaster sequences any better than Michael Bay did in this film. Every visual effects action sequence was masterfully put together, firmly cementing Bay's place as one of the best action directors of all time.

""Armageddon"" is the type of 'end-of-the-world' disaster film that ""Deep Impact"" wished it could have been, and others aspire to be. The movie is extremely entertaining, and features an emotionally moving story that will take you on a ride that you won't soon forget.

This movie is just plain FUN and that's all it needs. Michael Bay's movies often have a lot of explosions, destruction and devastation. Don't blame the director if you don't like that sort of genre. It's just the way his movies are and it's why me and my friends love them.

Armageddon, unlike its twin Deep Impact, cuts to the good part at the very beginning. A meteor shower devastates New York City in a spectacular fashion. Some of the meteors even punched a few holes in the World Trade Center although I guess no one thought it was a big deal at the time. It then turns out that the meteors were preceding a much bigger asteroid that will wipe out all life on Earth within 18 days unless a nuclear bomb can be detonated inside the asteroid to blow it apart. Bruce Willis plays Harry Stamper, the leader of the drilling team that's been hired to save the world. There are plenty of colorful characters on the team and the level of comic relief is strong enough to give this movie a warm atmosphere. Particularly funny is Peter Stormare's performance as a half-crazy Russian cosmonaut. That's not to say there are no sad moments since not everyone survives the mission. In addition to the main plot of going into space and blowing up the rock, there's also a love story between Harry's daughter Grace and Ben Affleck's character that Harry doesn't approve of. It is rather predictable, but then again, what love story isn't? There are quite a few `ticking-time-bomb' moments throughout the film, which make good thrills considering that the world is at stake.

Many have complained that Armageddon has many mistakes and scientific inaccuracies but that's really unavoidable considering the movie's far-fetched scenario. If you're not an astrophysicist then these things shouldn't bother you too much. Armageddon has a lot of special effects which is a good thing for a space movie. The Space Shuttles' flight through the meteor field is incredible. The scenery on the asteroid is very beautiful and the jagged cliffs and canyons create a stunning otherworldly environment.

I strongly recommend this movie.",1187308800,3,2596,4.908883826879271

From what I recall of the press around this movie at the time it came out, there is not shot in this great stain on our cultural landscape that lasts more than five seconds. That might be fine if the shots that were in the film were of a higher quality. Alas, this is not the case.

This movie is loud, obnoxious, annoying and generally sucky. Its single redeeming virtue is that it's better than the American version of ""Godzilla"". Screening this film before detainees at Gitmo would likely constitute a violation of the Geneva Convention.

The SFX in the film are good, not great. The science is miserable. Not quite as bad as, say, having a shark roar, but bad. The acting is sub-par, which is really sad given the talent in this movie. The directing is about what you'd expect from Michael Bay. The man loves to use orange filters while shooting aircraft in flight. Don't even get me started about the overly jingoistic, rah-rah, Go, America!, nonsense at the end of the film.

This movie is a brutal, unforgiving, assualt on our senses and an insult to our intelligence.

It takes a lot to get anyone to watch a movie several times over and over, especially with the enourmous number of movies out there to chose from, but the wit and storyline just really flows together and the one liners are hilarious.

One of my all time favorite lines came from this movie, from the character ""Rockhound"" played by Steve Buscemi:  ""You know we're sitting on four million pounds of fuel, one nuclear weapon and a thing that has 270,000 moving parts built by the lowest bidder. Makes you feel good, doesn't it?""

The roster of all-star cast members is amazing and in my opinion, they all showed why they are all-stars, it was a great performance from everyone.

Everyone complains that the movie isn't realistic? It's a sci-fi movie for goodness sakes.  If your standard for a good movie is that is has to be feasible then you might as well completely wipe out more than a few entire categories of movies altogether.

Okay.

The science fiction part of this left a lot to be desired. Being the closet geek that I am, I have to honestly say, I was completely disappointed with the science fiction part of it. The technical details, the reasons they wanted THIS man instead of someone trained for space duties... I just find that my suspension of disbelief fails me here, and I simply found myself saying, ""Yeah, right.""

However, that being said, the humor of the story is great. It's subtle, not in your face, and Willis, as always, has some excellent sarcastic zingers done in such a subtle way, that the laughter just sneaks up on you. Comedy is a nice twist for him.

In the end, I honestly have to say that I was not expecting what happened. I figured, ""Oh, this is going to be sad, the kid is going to die, and Willis's character will learn a lesson, and him and his daughter will be so close...blah blah blah - blech!""

When that WASN'T what happened, I must honestly say, I was both pleasantly surprised, and I cried. Yes, me, the woman who very rarely ever cries at any movie, cried at the way this one ended. When he called him his son, I just lost it.

First of all, the thought of NASA, and the entire world for that matter, relying on a bunch of moronic drillers to save the planet by flying two space shuttles to an asteroid that is hurtling towards the earth to drill into said asteroid and insert a bomb in the middle...well, that's a mouthful of stupid.  Whoever thought of this idea for a movie should be castrated.

Let's get to the specifics.  Space shuttles don't quite fly around like planes; they just aren't that maneuverable.  Secondly, if someone is driving a go-cart on an asteroid, which doesn't quite have the gravity of a planet like Earth, the vehicle will not be able to perform any jumps and then land back on the surface of the asteroid.  Also, when a space shuttle crash lands on an asteroid, chances are there will be explosions and few survivors.  Finally, there is NO WAY IN HELL that the world would be able to put together a plan to save the planet in just over a week, when an asteroid suddenly appears to be on a collision course with the planet.  There are, however, redeeming qualities to the movie.

Michael Clark Duncan steals every scene in which he appears.  His tough guy with mental issues is spot-on and hilarious.  Steve Buscemi as the deranged, slightly insane second-fiddle is a perfect compliment to the stars of the show.  Billy Bob Thornton performs well as a subdued, but worried NASA chief in charge of figuring out how to save humanity.  Liv Tyler is beautiful and competent as usual, playing the daughter to Bruce Willis, the most experienced driller on the planet, and a guy who rules with a little laissez faire and a little iron fist.  Unfortunately, Ben Affleck ruins the otherwise decent acting.  His unbearable scene with animal crackers made me vomit just a little bit.  Whatever Affleck was trying to accomplish, whatever feel, look, or emotion, it never worked.  It was off the entire movie, and he nearly took the rest of the cast down with him.

MY TAKE ON ARMAGEDDON: SOME GOOD SCENES .. BUT -

This is one of those notorious features that is a really bad film with some really good parts. Billy Bob Thornton playing NASA executive director Dan Truman turns in a believably impressive performance and leaves me wanting to see him in more scenes. Unfortunately, the melodramatic, over-the-top love subplot which begins the movie with Willis [Harry S. Stamper] literally taking shots at his daughter's [Liv Tyler] bed mate [Ben Affleck] establishes the tone for this flick. After this, my expectations were lowered to a more realistic level. Very little of what followed was believable even in a fictionalized, fantasy sort of way. The first-rate special effects were overdone to the point of inducing vertigo in me. I noticed many others in the theater wincing and/or turning away to avoid some of the dizzying special effects scenes in space, which seemed to come far too often and last far too long during the second half of this far too long 150 minute flick.

The premise of this film and the talent on hand made this a potential powerhouse epic. Well, it still did well at the box office but it was neither an epic or powerhouse of a film.

IN THE END - Armegeddon is still a very difficult word to spell! Armegeddon finally boiled down to me, to be, $150 Million in Special Effects + a 2 Cent Romance which equalled a Headache. Nevertheless, the DVD plays very well and the award nominated special effects look extremely vivid and are really in your face for a very visceral experience.

Sure there are a lot of haters and bashers of the film but like what other's have said, you should take it for what it is, an action film with special effects.  Although everything is not 100% accurate in terms of reality, however the point is appreciating the visuals, the audio, and the overall roller coaster ride of a storyline.  This movie has other deeper themes such as honor, sacrafice,love, and reconciliation and redemtion. For what it's worth I belive the deeper themes to the movie make it more of appreciated and show the better side of humanity.  Our heros in this film have their own personal hangups, baggage, and flaws but make a difference in what they do.  Personally, I'd recommend this film for these reasons more if anything.

They have to venture out into space so they can land on an asteroid the size of Texas.  Their mission is to drill a very large hole so they can blow it up before it reaches Earth.  But no only does it have alot of action it also is a serious tear jerker.  It made me cry at least 4 different times.  The sad parts don't over throw the humorous parts.  Althought the whole story plot may be a bit of a stretch the graphics and actors help to make it more believable.  Bruce Willis as in all of his other movies was top notch and awesome' while Ben Affleck wasn't at his best.  The soundtrack also kept your foot taping, some songs by Aerosmith.

Can we all agree the very premise of this movie--along with all the wacky, physics-defying pseudo-science--requires a suspension of disbelief the size of, say, the Milky Way Galaxy?  Can't we all just get along?

ARMAGEDDON isn't a scientific treatise on how to successfully stop an asteroid the size of Texas from destroying the earth; it's a white-knuckled, strap-it-on and strap-it-up, grit your teeth and enjoy the ride roller coaster.  This movie delivers nonstop action like a law firm cranking out past-due statements; ARMAGEDDON's got it all, from a slingshot lunar ride, to thrills and chills with a nuclear weapon, to even one spaced-out Russian cosmonaut.

All viewers please check quantum physics at the door.

Bruce Willis, a cantankerous leader of a bunch of renegade roughnecks (roughnecks who must fly to the asteroid and drill through 800 feet of solid metal and drop a nuke in the hole, mind you), is solid.  Ben Affleck reminded me of a whiny, annoying teenager; Liv Tyler had me more solid than the meteor itself.  Billy Bob Thornton. . .yeah, okay.

1003256,2,6305169187,"Armageddon is an action movie with serious delusions of grandeur. Michael Bay's blockbuster is a sort of comic book brought to life, an over-stylized apocalyptic spectacle born of a generation raised on music videos--something that is especially evident in sequence after sequence edited to fit with the film's Aerosmith-dominated soundtrack. The pacing is frantic from the first fiery frames. Visual effects are clean but clearly overdone. The cast is bloated, with many of the comic back-ups overshadowing a set of forgettable heroes, and though the script makes great efforts to grant most of the lead characters an emotional moment this only serves to emphasize the cruel disregard offered to the movie's many victims. Those emotional moments almost always seem sentimental or forced, though they're soon lost in a wash of action and disaster. At one point Billy Bob Thornton succinctly promises the asteroid approaching Earth will bring ""basically the worst parts of the Bible,"" and this is what the film goes on to deliver. Suffering greatest of all amidst all of this is the film's credibility. Armageddon is, first and foremost, almost utterly unbelievable. This is a critical flaw that weakens the integrity of the plot from the first scenes set at NASA control. It's rare that any element, from design to dialogue, reinforces the dramatic reality of the situation or its consequences. It's a big movie that tries to be much, much bigger--truly, as apocalyptic epics go, Bay's Armageddon is petty and easily overshadowed. At its best, Armageddon entertains on the basest levels. At its worst, it cheapens a great many potent images and potentially powerful themes with its flashy approach. Unfortunately, it's not difficult to fathom that a movie this expensive could ultimately seem so cheap.

1003258,1,6305169187,"Having produced over 70 films, Jerry Bruckheimer has been affiliated with a very large share of cinematic trash (ex.: Bad Boys II, the rediculous Pearl Harbor, Kangaroo Jack, etc.), but one of his worst affiliations comes with this poor excuse for a film.  The acting is bad, the story is bad, the directing is bad (Michael Bay directs another awful picture), and everything else about it is bad. In his review for the Chicago Sun-Times, Roger Ebert said ""The movie is an assault on the eyes, the ears, the brain, common sense, and the human desire to be entertained. No matter what they're charging to get in, it's worth more to get out.""  There could not be more truth in a review (For more hysterical reviews, see I Hated, Hated, Hated this Movie by Roger Ebert).  There is absolutely no reason that this movie should have ever been made.  I do agree with some of the other Amazon reviewers in that Willis does his best with what he was given.  Certain actors can still be good and be in one of the worst movies of the year, so hats off to him.  For the rest of the poor souls that acted in this movie (Affleck, Tyler, Buscemi), I think you should fire your agents.  There is no room in this world for Michael Bay.  Jerry Bruckheimer has produced some good ones (Remember the Titans, Black Hawk Down) but he should have stayed away from this one.",1140480000,4,1349,4.455284552845528
1003296,5,6305169187,"I don't belong to the apparent elitists who despise Michael Bay's filmmaking because he's entertaining for it's own sake.  Michael Bay is what he is the same as Hitchcock directed psychological thrillers or George Lucas directs science fiction.  He makes films that are loud, fast, action-packed and quite frankly, fun to watch. Isn't that what movies are supposed to be about?

Armageddon was probably the most (other than maybe Saving Private Ryan) anticipated movie of 1998. I'd rank it in my top two or three of 1998 (The others being Saving Private Ryan and American History X). It's not the next Schindler's List and it doesn't strive to be.  It stars Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler in the main roles.  The supporting cast is underrated, well-balanced and fun to watch, from Michael Clarke Duncan and Steve Buscemi down to lesser know actors Marshall R. Teague and Jessica Steen.

Yes, the plot and premise may not be the most believable. But neither is King Kong, Lord of The Rings, Star Wars or whatever.  These pseudo-critics on Amazon.com whine about ""poor science"" behind the movie, or the poor plot or the stereotypical cast.  You know what?  Who friggin' cares?  It's a movie that's made for sheer fun, for entertainment, for bringing your family to enjoy a couple of hours of action, thundering explosions, fast vehicles and a little romance.  Armageddon, despite what the Ebert and Roeper apprentices in here think, is entertainment at its best.  Stop whining and enjoy yourself.

We are all familiar with the story by now. An asteroid the size of Texas is on path to impact with Earth, which would destroy all forms of life on it.  The world only has 18 days until impact. The only way to stop it is to blow it up from the inside by drilling to its core.  For that, NASA recruits the worlds's best deep-core driller in Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his renegade drilling crew.  The crew, along with some NASA astronauts and an unlucky Russian cosmonaut, journey to the asteroid and embark upon the mission to destroy it and with that, save the entire planet.

Along the way, the crew endures despite losing lives, having to overcome huge obstacles, and having to make decisions that will affect not only the world but their own personal lives.  The movie is filled with a few emotional moments that will bring tears to some eyes.  The score is grandiose and is a large part of the film.  The film strives to be patriotic and the cinematography reflects it.  I couldn't help but feel patriotic and moved while watching the movie.  The sound and visual effects in the movie were awesome, which its four Oscar nominations reflect.

This movie is a lot of things. It's fun, it's moving, it's sad and it's romantic.  Above all, it's one of the more entertaining movies I have seen. The cast had a lot of chemistry together and seemed to have a lot of fun which is reflected in the film.  This was Ben Affleck's first big box-office action movie and he gives a good first effort.  Bruce Willis takes on the role of Harry Stamper with ease like the action movie veteran he is.  Liv Tyler is sweet as Harry's daughter and their emotional goodbye is to be remembered.  (Home theater aficionados will also appreciate the visual and sound effects in this movie).

Armageddon was the second-highest grossing film of 1998 narrowly behind Saving Private Ryan.  That might be something for critics to think about, because obviously A LOT of people saw this movie.  All in all, don't listen to the critics here trying to become the next ""Top 500 reviewer.""  See the movie, it's a blast.",1139529600,51,3618,4.7300319488817895

1003299,4,6305169187,"""Once again this is rumor control, and here are the facts"". A review should be an opinion with supporting facts. Unfortunately, many (including the editor above), offer opinion with additional opinions given as facts. I see gripes about the physics and astrophysics of this movie but those complaining have got to get the basic physics correct before trying to address the astrophysics. The effect is that the movie proves its scientific validity to those who know the sciences of it. It's a GOOD MOVIE.

First,before the science part, on stereotyping, most of those stereotyped according to the editor above were characters that may have been seen for MAYBE one minute and you may also notice that they are using their own characters from their typical stand-up comedic professions. Not all are comedians though. For example, the chinese buisenessmen that are clients of Willis' company. I guess to avoid being tossed up as stereotypes they should have been speaking french while visiting the rig in the South China Sea. Or maybe they should have just been of french nationality. Two African American characters are in the entirety of the movie, one, an emotional gentle giant biker and the other is serious and by the book Air Force brass. Yeah, I recall those stereotypes from all over the place. By the way, the brief appearance nationalities are all given as stereotypes but he fails to mention the Russian that becomes part of the mission. The Scottish apparently got pulled into the fray by the character Max saying his favorite dish is haggis.

The editor and some reviewers seem to have led sheltered lives. The character types listed are normal in life, especially in manual labor occupations, and they also would tend to make referances like ""bitch that needs drillin"" (Watch your punctuation Mister Ed. and I thought profanity wasn't permitted). I notice that he never mentions the AF and NASA pilots DON'T display the same kind of behavior as the oil drillers.

Now let's hit the science. Shuttle maneuverability. There are no objects of easily recognized scale to use in establishing how maneuverable the shuttles are. The best thing available is the other shuttle and that doesn't help much at all. In other words, you can't determine how much space they are using to make their maneuvers. And I know I never saw any snap rolls or anything like that. They appeared to me to use a reasonable amount of space to make their maneuvers. I grew up in aircraft.

Gravity equal to Earth in some parts, a lack of gravity in others. This falls under astrophysics so I can only give possibilities based on views. The rotation of the asteroid gets fouled up and it begins to pivot on three axis which to my mind could upset gravitational effects. But more importantly, pay attention to the makeup of some parts of the asteroid like where they were drilling. ""Compressed iron ferrite"" and add to it the various types of radiation in space such as electromagnetic that could easily magnetize iron ferrite and cause false gravity by attracting anything containing ferrous metals. As Watts says after they land, ""The guages will not read. They're all peaked like we're plugged into some kind of god****** magnetic field.""

About the shuttle crash-landing at ""thousands of miles per hour"" and having survivors. If two objects collide head on, their two speeds are added together to come up with the force of impact. The shuttle wrecks on the asteroid from behind, both traveling the same direction. Therefore, the speed of the asteroid is SUBTRACTED from the speed of the shuttle to get the force of impact. So, the shuttle wrecked at about 500 MPH across the surface which means it is a glancing blow which further reduces the severity. This as compared to say plowing directly into the back of the asteroid which would have been a catastrophic impact at 500 MPH.

""And now for something completely different."" Why carry a machine gun on a mission in space. How often does the military NOT carry guns? Remember, Air Force is involved. There's the possibility it was on board to be tested on some mission. But the real question here is why would they unload it onto the surface of the asteroid for this movie? They obviously wouldn't have time to even test it on this mission. So, this is a valid complaint. I'm not even sure how the idea of including this part even came to be because it's nonsensical.

NASA mounting a multinational mission this quickly. Multinational? The only multinational part of it is docking with a Russian space station for refueling. Six US AF and NASA and eight oil rig workers from one company (US based). With Earth to be destroyed in 18 days, I would say they wouldn't have a lot of choice but to ditch some safety practices and such and force the mission into execution quickly. Apollo 8 was prepared for in just 4 months and that was only the second manned mission of the Apollo project, most of the equipment had only been used a couple of times, and it was back when we knew so little about space flight. It is a scarey thought these days though after the loss of two shuttles due to idiotic problems compared to the safe return of Apollo 13 in 1970 following its critical malfunction.

The unknown space station with its own gravity. The station has simulated gravity caused by firing rockets that cause it to spin. Did you happen to notice that they never state what station? I don't believe a year was even given anywhere in the movie. These little items are obscured, likely intentionally, to avoid certain limitations. I prefer when they do this. It's like watching ""Escape From New York"" now in 2006 while the movie is set in the future - 1997...

Now here's mine. Why didn't the landing gears shatter when the shuttle landed on the asteroid? Unless heated, they likely should have in such extreme cold. But that issue was never addressed. You can assume one way or the other or decide it isn't worth worrying about. Personally, I don't think it's worth worrying about.

Just a little note on speeds given in the movie. If you've ever wondered about the speeds given in the movie (approximately 22,000 MPH asteroid velocity and shuttles hitting 22,500 MPH). Apollo 10 hit 24,791 MPH on its return trip in 1969. That'd be 2791 MPH faster than the asteroid's velocity in ""Armageddon"".

So I'm takin' the high road, folks.  I'll say it: I'm a Michael Bay fan.  Yup.  I like this movie, especially the Criterion edition.  Unlike the other Amazon reviewers, I enjoy the ridiculous gravity simulations and all the other little inconsistencies.  Hell, that's a staple of the Michael Bay film.  Remember The Rock?

Anyway, back to the case at hand.  If you know Criterion, you know why their editions cost almost double the regular studio releases--often much more if the title is out of print.  If not, check out their homepage at [...]  I wouldn't buy the Criterion edition of Armageddon unless, 1) you've seen the film, like it, and want to own the definitive version 2) are a Criterion collector, and you've ' just gotta have it.'  If you're just looking to watch the movie and then throw it on a shelf, I'd go with the Touchstone version available on Amazon for under $12.

What's the difference between the two?  First of all, the Criterion transfer is digitally remastered and is beautiful.  In a movie governed by special effects, it really makes a difference.  Also the sound is far superior to the Touchstone release.  If you don't have a home stereo set-up this may not be relevant to you...but even if you don't the movie's going to sound better on Criterion.

The gag reel on the Criterion is exclusive to the Criterion release...and is rather crude.  That's why I like it.  They show what the guys in the film were really like during filming.  If you are offended by certain four letter words, stay away from this part.

There is an analysis of the special effects that's real cool, as well.  All I could think while watching the movie for the first time was, ""Wow.  This must've cost a LOT.""  And I was right.  The special effects reel shows you how they composed a few of the action sequences.

Finally, the Criterion edition is real hard to find.  Try searching for it in your local retailers.  Bootlegs of the DVD seem to floating around, as well.  Amazon is a quick, easy way to secure an authentic copy.

That's about all I've got to say, and frankly, Amazon ain't paying me a dime for these words so I don't care if this review was helpful to you or not...

I love big, dumb action movies as much as anyone - GOOD, big dumb action movies. Arnie movies (well, some) spring to mind, or Face Off - dumb as a bag of rocks, but still cool.

Then there's this. It's dumb, it's loud - and it's really, really BAD.

So the world's going to end, a big meteor is gonna come smashing into earth. Who ya gonna call? Er, Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck and Steve Buscemi, amongst others. Not my immediate choice, but Bruce and Steve can pretty much do no wrong in my eyes (well, until this..) so fair enough.

To say the script is piffle would be too nice. It is full of some of the most overblown, mawkish drivel I've ever heard (the ""Animal Shapes"" scene has to be seen to be believed) and any film, ANY, that succeeds in making Steve Buscemi annoying(!) is just plain evil in my books.

His directing style is poor, as he literally believes that an edit every second is the best way to make a film. I don't think it's possible to physically count the number of cuts and explosions in his films within one human lifetime.

1003326,2,6305169187,"Just what where they trying to do here? Is it a science fiction movie or an MTV music video? I haven't seen so much Hollywood claptrap put together in a single movie since... well I have to admit. Hollywood does put a lot of claptrap on a fair amount of movies each year. Either way Armageddon is one of those movies that tries way too hard to be cool, stylish and sexy all the while alienating any decent storytelling in the process.

Everything starts off well enough with the government going over the situation and some interesting side story at Stamper's oilrig. Even during the training scenes everything seems entertaining and even fun at times. The second the space shuttles launch you get an entirely different movie. It's an attention deficit disorderly's dream. You can pretty much time every single camera shot at about three seconds or less. Shots going back and forth between the spaceriggers and mission control and Liv looking soulfully into space and back again are dizzying and mind-boggling at times. It's like a music video gone mad. There is no room to just soak up the situation as director Michael Bay decides to just overwhelm you with bits and pieces instead.

I will admit the movie does look nice. Liv Tyler is cute and the lights and cameras are in all of the right place for some perfect poses. The problem is most of the movie seems to be about nothing more than all the lights and cameras being in all the right places for those perfect poses. The script slips up big time in a few places like where Rockhound decides to go crazy for no reason and when the government went to go gather Stamper's men. I mean do these guys leave the oilrig that quickly and get their lives going all over the nation in just a couple of days? Not to mention one of them starting his own business. Can you say plot hole? Then there is the unbelievably stupid tragic ending, which I still cannot for the life of me figure out why they did it that way. It just didn't make sense for a family man to make the ultimate sacrifice (hope that didn't spoil too much... aw who cares...).

Still the acting is very good when you actually get a chance to see it (like before the shuttle launch/MTV music video movie starts). Billy Bob Thornton probably gets the biggest kudos for being the ultimate professional military man with a brain and a way of people to match. Michael Clarke Duncan probably stands out more for me as well because of a particularly entertaining scene regarding a psych evaluation.

I know Armageddon was a blockbuster and that people all over the world sings its praise. Well I don't! In my opinion this movie is nothing more than a clich-ridden fluff that is to science fiction what pre-fab boy bands scantily clad teen divas are to the legitimate music world. Crrrrrap!

Michael Bay's ""technique"" is so totally awful.  Not just this, ALL of his films.  The fact this guy is ""allowed"" to make films at all in Hollyweird just goes to show ya that ""talent"" and ""creativity"" have little to do with whether films get to the big screen or not.  Michael Bay is a HORRIBLE ""director.""  Simply horrible.  I haven't seen (thank the Lord, whatever you may conceive him/her to be) all of his films), but if you catch ""Pearl Harbor,"" another of his horrors, you'll notice that this guy is IN LUST with close ups, shaky camera, shaky camera close ups, fast TV commercial-like cuts and editing, and more and more and more and more of the same.  Is all of this supposed to add up to enjoyable film entertainment?  I think not, unless you're all crystal-methed up or something.

The story and characters are so cardboard cut-out, and all of it is so annoying, one hardly knows where to begin to diss this mess.  But I won't even try.  And do you know why?

It's because this is LOWEST COMMON DENOMINATOR filmmaking.  And lots of folks will love this crap, not knowing any better (Forgive them Lord, for they know not...).  The basic idea here could've been something special, but Michael Bay and whomever his Hollywood co-horts and associates are, turned this into ONE OF THE WORST BIG BUDGET HOLLYWOOD FILMS EVER!

Besides the crappy, by-the-numbers characters and plot, besides the ""patriotic"" nonsense (the rest of the world also threatened by Armageddon basically doesn't exist, or simply doesn't matter), virtually every shot, every scene, is so choppy, mostly extreme close ups (even when action scenes demand something else), and so cornball, that I wonder how anyone with half a brain could sit through this and actually find value in it.  And ""science?""  Forgettabout it.  This film's scientific value is non-existent.  Even the special effects add up to zilch.

As I write this, I even find I'm wasting my time.  Why waste time at all on pure filmic garbage?  Hollywood and the ""studios"" have offered us a helluva lot of great films, despite obvious limitations and compromises.  In my heart, I'd like to believe that in times of deep reflection and honesty, Michael Bay himself would even admit that this film is pure crap.  But this is not a movie I have any ""heart"" for except for total contempt and the first time I saw it was enough.  Further excerpts caught on replays on TV have only confirmed my original thoughts.

This movie makes ""Independence Day,"" another pretty bad movie, look like a masterpiece.  This is a 4 Tylenol special, and have on hand plenty of eye drops.  Michael Bay should be banned from making any more films.  There may be worse ""filmmakers"" out there, but none of them are making any money, and are probably working at your neighborhood 7-11.

Okay, I am punished for having an engineering degree, and therefore being actuely aware of how ridiculous the science was and, more importantly, how NEEDLESSLY ridiculous the science was. So many of the things that just blasted my suspension of disbelief were throwaway lines of dialogue that could just have easily been written so that they weren't horribly wrong, e.g. the ""13g turn"" around the moon, which would have reduced our heroes to chunky salsa, could just have easily been a survivable 8. I know to some it seems like nit-picking, but I hate any movie that punishes me for having a brain.

But let's set that aside. This movie is very Michael Bay, in that it is a loud, frequently, and very visually intense. This one, though, is TOO loud. It is just dominated by the sound effects, and a lot of stuff just needlessly blows up or is shattered. The film audially, and ultimately, visually is just so far over the top that it is difficult to enjoy without watching some slightly less large and ridiculous movie before it.

Okay, so we turn to acting. Here Bruce Willis continues to confirm my belief that his choice of movies will cause him to be forever underrated as an actor. He gives a fine, if slightly stiff perforance to lead this movie. A decent Ben Affleck bats second in the order, and from there it is a series of ridiculous cardboard cutout characteristics trying to be characters. Granted, for a summer popcorn-cruncher, you aren't looking for Shakespeare, but that still doesn't alter the fact that there is not much there. As a result the movie tries overpowered it's fault with frequent, large explosions, tragedies, destruction, etc. etc.

This movie has actually caused me, in normal conversation, to pull the mind-bending linguistic feat of referring to ""Independence Day"" as ""restrained"" in a sincere fashion, which should tell a potential viewer a lot. I can't completely hate this movie, because there is some quality here, and I know ""The Core"" exists, so I have to be able to rate something lower than this. If you have a true home theater, I can see how this thunderous film can be fun, but on any regular tv, this one is a snoozer.",1109030400,4,2180,4.716535433070866
1003363,5,6305169187,"I cannot believe all the negative feedback ARMEGEDDON has recieved.  Why, it is one of the most greatest action films ever made, and it is brought to us by action director Michael Bay (He is my favorite movie director).  I have liked this movie even before I knew he directed it.  I rememeber seeing this in theaters when I was ten years old back in 1998, and it put me on the edge of my seat.  It had such great special effects, alot of intense action scenes, some great comedical moments, and even some very emotionl parts at the end of the of the film.  Yes, I know it was a very long movie, but the movie will make such an impact on you that you'll never notice.  It is ALOT better then that other sappy disaster movie, DEEP IMPACT.  DEEP IMPACT was more of an emotional movie while ARMAGEDDON is more of an action thrill ride.  Although most people prefer DEEP IMPACT, I would rather would watch this.  Here is the plot.

When a space shuttle and half of New York city is unexpectantly destroyed by a meteor shower, NASA tracks down another cosmical object heading toward for us.  The difference, is that this one is enormous, it the size of Texas.  And to make matters worse, we only have 18 days to destroy it-BEFORE IT DESTROYS US!  Now, the only was to demolishing it is by planting a nuclear weapon 800 feat below it surface.  In order to do that, NASA must get the Worlds best deep core driller.  That guy is Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and his crew AJ (Ben Affleck), ""Chick"" Chappelle (Will Patton), Bear (Michael Clarke Duncan), Max (Kan Campbell), Oscar (Owen Wilson), Freddy Noonan (Clark Bolly), and Rockhound (Steve Buscemi).  These have 12 days to train how to become astronauts.  All the time in the world is all they've got.

In my opinin, I think this is the best movie directed by Michael Bay.  Its has all sorts of great elements- Action, comedy, and drama.  Sure the plot is a little obscure, our fate is in the hands of a bunch of oil drillers?  I know it sounds dumb, but it does make a great pop corn flick.  What was also good about this movie was the relation ship between AJ and Harry's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler).  Besides the asteroid, the movie was also centered around that relationship.  AJ and Grace love each other however Harry does not like AJ.  Loving Grace was sort of the real reason why AJ was saving the World.  He is doing for her.  And slowly throughout the movie, AJ was earning Harry's respect.

Now let me talk about this DVD.  I suggest getting the regular edition DVD, not the criterion collection.  I remeber paying alot of money for the criterion collection, and while the movie is fantastic, the dvd lacks even though is is a 2 disc set.  Every piece of veiwing material on the 2nd disc is only ten minutes.  I can probobly watch everything on the second disc in less then 45 min.

1003367,4,6305169187,"Armageddon and Deep Impact bear a striking resemblance to each other. They are both disaster movies. They are both big budget US ""summer"" movies. They both made lots of money at the box office. They both revolve around the premise of a cosmological object striking the Earth, annihilating all life. They both have pretty much predictable plots - filmmaking by numbers as it were.

There are differences between them, however. In Armageddon, the enemy is an asteroid. In Deep Impact, the enemy is a comet. In Armageddon, the US president is white and up-beat. In Deep Impact, the US president is black and sombre (Morgan Freeman). In Armageddon, the emphasis is more on the amazing special effects and the gung-ho attitude of the Earth's saviours. In Deep Impact, they concentrate a little more on the human response to impending annihilation.

Of the two movies, I preferred Deep Impact myself. However, Armageddon is no slouch of a movie, either, and is more of an arcade thrill ride than Deep Impact. Just don't expect anything other than a spectacular thrill ride, and you will not be disappointed.

For example, when the nuclear weapon is about to detonate, he calmly tells the pilot that he has never failed.. e.t.c. and that he won't accept failure.. e.t.c. - he doesn't once look at the timer, and draws out his sentiments as though he has all the time in the world.

I actually can give this movie one star, not just rate it at one and lament that I can't give it zero stars. I give it that one star for belonging to that wonderful category ""So Awful It's Fun To Watch.""

With a less talented cast, this movie would simply be so torturous as to violate the Geneva Conventions. But in the hands of Billy Bob Thornton and Bruce Willis and Liv Tyler, the DOA screenplay actually comes off comically, almost as if the actors know just how bad the dialogue and story is, and they are playing parodies of their own characters.

Every character is a caricature, a stereotype of some sort, from Bruce and Billy in the major roles, to Ben and Liv as teens in forbidden love, right down to the scientists who appear on screen just long enough to deliver a howler and make the entire scientific/engineering community look like the textbook definition of ""geekboys"", as well as a pair of Korean tourists who can't be bothered with meteors destroying New York and insist on going shopping in the midst of the chaos.

Every scene is a classic B-movie scene, from the cliche ""war room"" scenes of the president and his men trying to understand the imminent disaster, down to the ""which wire do I cut?!"" scene, and the final ""daddy I love you"" from Liv Tyler. You have seen all of these scenes before in other movies - Bay simply does his job in stringing them together into something resembling a plot.

And every other line of script is a howler. I have read many reviews of other disaster films in which critics lambaste films for packing X number of cliches in two hours, but this movie sets the standard.

And yet, it's still dumb fun, if that's what you're looking for. Don't expect to be swept up in the story or to be dazzled by the sci-fi effects.

This movie was watchable, but it was not an entertaining experience. ""Armaggedon"" is a movie that is bombastic, nonsensical, cliched, ridiculing, and is an insult to a moviegoer's intelligence. The Jerry Bruckheimer/Michael Bay team is the worst Hollywood duo next to Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich. Sure, ""mindless fun"" can have its moments, but ""Armageddon"" pushes this way too much.

The summary in a heartbeat: An asteroid ""the size of Texas"" is on its way towards Earth, and the US government hires oil drillers to drill into the asteroid's center to nuke it internally. The writers seemed to reach for some undesired effect here. So what if the asteroid is the size of Texas? You don't need an asteroid that size to wipe out Earth. A city-sized asteroid is all it would take. Were the filmmakers paranoid that the movie will lose flavor if the asteroid were only the size of Seattle? And despite it's size, an asteroid does not have the same gravitional pull that the Earth or even the Moon does, yet the astronauts walk on the asteroid as if they're strolling through the city park.

""Armageddon"" plays like a montage on steroids. It just does not know how to enjoy the scenery. Camera angles shift and change so fast like an MTV-style music video, as if the filmmakers wanted to prevent you from taking a better look. It felt like the film was going to short-circuit on me. The disaster scenes are among the worst ever filmed. Closed-up shots so that the audience can't comprehend the mayhem is an insulting and annoying film gesture.

The script is one that is completely dry of original ideas. The usual world in peril and average Americans have to save it. The usual sentimental farewell of the sacrificial hero. The usual love complications. The usual fumbling of high authorities. Cliched scenes like having to decide whether to cut the red or blue wire before the bomb explodes. This movie ridicules everybody, and it's not done in good taste. It ridicules NASA. It ridicules the President. It ridicules Russians. It ridicules average citizens. Everybody is a half-witted pawn for the plot's progression. The movie lovingly sets up human beings for doom as if they're too stupid to know what's coming. There are a number of scenes were the filmmakers decided ""Hey, let's insert a disaster here!""

The movie is littered with other kinds of nonsense. At the end of the movie, Harry says to AJ, ""I've always thought of you as a son."" Right. At the beginning of the movie, he was chasing him around the oil rig with a shotgun. Then there's a scene where the nuke is about blow in less than a minute, but Harry takes his time to talk about his determination to drill his mark. Then the asteroid is about to hit the zero barrier mark, but Harry takes his time to say a final goodbye to his daughter. The world is about to end, for crying out loud. Giving lengthy banal eulogies seems more important to the director.

""Armageddon"" is an ugly, frantic, burdening experience and is a movie that makes you wonder if the filmmakers even went through any edits in the screenplay. Another asteroid movie ""Deep Impact"", while not great, still wipes the floor with this one. Hopefully this movie will serve as an example of what NOT to do with making disaster films.",1089676800,11,3434,4.726210350584307
1003464,5,6305169187,"For me, this is an incredibly difficult movie to review and critique.  I feel that the movie did a phenomenal job of developing the story; however, the acting in the movie left something to be desired.
In case someone has not seen the movie, I do not want to give much of the story away.  An asteroid, classified as a global killer (a global killer meaning that if it impacts earth, there will be total destruction of life), is on a collision course with earth.  NASA comes up with the idea of landing on the asteroid, drilling a hole, and dropping a nuclear weapon in the hole and blowing up the asteroid with the intent of splitting it in two and altering its path so it misses earth.
While it is a simple story, the movie does an exceptional job developing the plot into a 2-hour movie.  The movie incorporates a ""gloom and doom"" plot with a second story of love, romance, and hope.  The first plot is about an oil driller and his band of misfits attempting to work with a group of highly educated astronauts and military pilots to drill a hole on the asteroid (and of course the work together as well as Worcestershire sauce and ice cream).  The second story line involves one of the oil drillers falling in love with the owners daughter.  The relationship reminds me of a terrible ""teen-age"" relationship with the seemingly perfect love that young people share coupled with a resentful father who seems to not want to lose his daughter.
It is difficult to explain how well the two story lines integrate without ruining the movie for someone who has not seen it.  While the plot is superb, the acting in the move is just so-so.  I thought the acting of the three headline actors (Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, and Liv Tyler) was weak at best; they had their great moments, but mostly their acting seemed almost emotionless.  I did think a couple of the lesser known actors (mainly Michael Clarke Duncan as ""Bear"" and Peter Stormare as the Russian astronaut) were incredible in this movie.
Personally, due to the overwhelming depressing plot about the end of the earth, I don't think this is a movie I would cuddle with on the couch with a new date.  However, I nonetheless think the plot is excellent  and I do highly recommend seeing this movie.  I give the movie 5 stars for how the movie integrates the two story lines together and develops them into a great plot, not the acting in the movie.",1089590400,,2397,4.520833333333333
1003465,1,6305169187,"Oh, man, I tried to find something useful to say about this movie, but all I can do is shake my head and wonder why this kind of movie exists. So empty and unsatisfying. So cold and improbable beyond even science fiction.
And adding to the pain is an excruciatingly bad Aerosmith ballad on the soundtrack.
Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay must be stopped.
Just stay away if you haven't seen it yet. Run screaming. Save yourself.",1087948800,8,429,4.584415584415584
1003466,4,6305169187,"While Deep Impact gave me more of an experience, and it more the type of movie I'd watch at home, Armageddon is more the type of movie the mainstream movie-going public wanted back in the 98. Armageddon serves as effective action movie, a very effect romance movie, and all-around great pop-corn flick.
Armageddon is based on the Idea of an asteroid on a collision course with earth and a team odf deep sea oil drillers (lead by bruce willis) that is sent along with a team of traditional astronauts to land on the asteroid and plant nukes to destroy it. if this sounds familiar it's because it was done very similarly though with a different attitude in ""Deep Impact"" which was released around the same time. While ""Deep Impact"" was a Disaster movie in every way, focusing on the effects of this natural disaster on society, individuals lives and the world in general... Armageddon is told from a more... ""hollywood"" viewfinder.
Instead of taking on the persona of a disaster flick, Armageddon does a nice job of transitioning a sci-fi/disaster movie plot as a medium via which to deliver an action romance movie. The romance in Armageddon is done well, with Bruce Willis's daughter and one of his crew being involved in a passionate love affair that is going on underneath daddy's nose. The 'disaproving father' dynamic isn't the most original but makes an interesting emotional angle, especially at the end. The effects in armageddon are good, but the movie is more centered around the action-based and love-inspired events of our characters rather than the ramifications this disasterous event would have on our planet. You'll see some nice CGI impacts, but most of the effects are space based here.
The real way in which armageddon becomes a good movie is the way the action, romance and intermittent humor is in a very nice balance throughout. You'll laugh... you'll cry (or want to cry)... and you'll be on the edge of your seat more than once. This is what the mainstream asks of a movie, and in the end is the main reason Armageddon is remembered as being better than deep impact by most people I know. Indeed Armageddon does feel like a better, more consisten cinematic endevour than it's rival, though it lacks many dimensions to it that ""Deep Impact"" picked up perfectly.
All things considered most people will be pleased with Armageddon, whether you're looking for a fun, action movie to pass the time, or a heart throbbing romance. The end of the movie will leave you feeling satisfied, and entertained, where as the end of Deep Immpact will leave you feeling sad and disconcerted as you ponder the sobering realities of the basis of the plot. I saw this movie in the theater and everyone enjoyed it.",1086393600,3,2714,4.788912579957356
1003467,3,6305169187,"After watching Armageddon I am sort of reminded of the release of The Arrival and Independence Day where both movies dealt with a similar plot and one tried to be somewhat realistic while the other went the campy B route.  The same can be said of Deep Impact and Armageddon.  Like Independence Day, Armageddon is a big budget B movie.  Also like Independence Day, it is a lot of fun.
In this movie an unseen comet slams into the Asteroid Belt and sends a bunch of rocks toward Earth.  A brief, but very destructive, meteor shower precedes the main event that will be played by an asteroid the size of Texas.  In the eighteen days that Earth has left a team of the world's fines oil drillers is assembled and sent into space to plant a nuke to blow up the asteroid.  A simple plot.
During the course of the movie we realize that the writers no nothing about Oil drilling, oil companies, astronomy, NASA, gravity, or most any other topic raised in the movie.  There are a number of things I found particularly amusing.  The first was the rough-neck driller (Bruce Willis) who is also the owner of the Drilling Company and drilling rig and is also a multi-millionaire.  The rest of the drillers also seem to earn far more that their real-life counterparts.  I was also amused at the fact that with all life on Earth being threatened, including bacteria, that the President of the United States has the authority to scrap the mission to save the world (there are at least five countries directly involved in the operation).
Among some of the other amusing points are the space shuttles (with a metal skin and not ceramic tiles) have the maneuverability of an F-14 Tomcat.  They do some wonderful daredevil flying that is a credit to Top Gun (and without atmosphere yet).  The asteroid, which resembles a giant black snowflake, has some gravity.  There is enough that people don't move any differently than on Earth but little enough that a jump can carry you for miles or break out of the gravity well.  Then there is the aging space station that blows up.  Although the fuel is in a pod at the end of a long extension, there seems to be highly explosive material in every inch of the station.  The first meteor that hits lands next to a guy arguing with another guy.  The other guy is struck dead (no pun intended) and resulting in a hole that goes through to the subway system but leaves the first guy just a little dusty.
While Armageddon is a B movie it does have elements of other classic films including The Right Stuff.  I also liked the pro NASA and pro Space Program plugs that keep popping up (Thornton is excellent).  This is a fun movie but the plot and continuity have more holes than the average storm-door screen.  If you want a fun movie, this is the one to watch, if you want something a bit more serious, check out Deep Impact instead.",1085702400,4,2849,4.495145631067961
1003468,4,6305169187,"Director:  Michael Bay
Cast:  Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Tyler, Will Patton, Steve Buscemi, Michael Clarke Duncan.
Running Time:  151 minutes.
Rated PG-13 for violence and some language.
""Armageddon"" opens with a NASA spacecraft being torn apart by numerous small asteroids, destroying the ship and killing all of the inhabitants.  Large cities across the country are then bombarded with meteors, causing NASA to investigate the strange phenomenom.  They conclude that a massive, mother asteroid the size of Texas is on course to directly hit the planet Earth, killing all civilization and life as they know it.
NASA excecutive director Dan Truman (Thornton) decides that the best way to defend the world against this devastating threat is to hire a group of oil diggers (?) and actually send them onto the meteor (?) in order to plant an explosive inside the middle of it (?) so it can be destroyed before it makes contact.  Bruce Willis stars in an adequate performance as the leader of the ragtag team of riggers, taking his team (which includes daughter Tyler and her lover Affleck) to the core of the planet's brink of elimination.  While the story is so farfetched and ridiculous to be that realistic, fine performances throughout coupled with some hilarious, quirky dialogue saves this film from being a run-of-the-mill special effects guru blockbuster.
Superb special effects, riveting and off-the-wall cinematography created by the one-and-only director Michael Bay (""The Rock""), a fantastic musical score featuring the Aerosmith great, ""I Don't Want to Miss a Thing"", and a touching, powerful ending. Fun, enjoyable; this rock-em, sock-em roller-coaster of a film is what summer movie-going is all about--even if its on DVD.",1085356800,2,1758,5.257142857142857
1003469,4,6305169187,"What would you do if you knew that tomorrow the world was going to come to an end? Who would you talk to? What would you accomplish or attempt to accomplish before the end was to come? Where would you place yourself as you waited for that fateful moment to arrive? These are the questions that are constantly ignored within disasters films throughout the history of cinema and most recently in the latest surge of disaster flicks that have ranged from erupting volcanoes to catastrophic natural disasters to world-ending cosmic forces such as asteroids and comets colliding with Earth, thus ending all life on this planet. 1998 was a classic year in which two disaster films faced off against each other within a two month time span dealing with the same basic plot line (space-rock colliding with Earth while a space team tries to prevent such a disaster from occurring) but selling each one in a decidedly different style and audience base. The first was Deep Impact (Dreamworks) which rushed out of the gate with $40 million in its opening weekend but failed to show legs by ending its run with $140 million. Less then two months later, Jerry Bruckheimer set to conquer space with his action-drama, Armageddon, and show how these disasters flicks are to be done correctly.
The story centers around the rag-tag team of ""astronauts"" that are sent into space to divert a space rock from colliding with Earth, which, in result, would end most life on the planet, if not all. It seems like any other day in New York City ... That is before large explosions occur throughout the city destroying office buildings and towering structures and resulting in the deaths of hundreds, if not thousands, of individuals. The United States Government, believing this to be an attack of terrorism, asks NASA to discover the source of the problem but when they do, they get a decisively different answer then they had ever anticipated. What caused the explosions in New York weren't missiles ... they were small meteorites (about the size of basketballs) that trailed off the enormous asteroid (about the size of Texas) that is on a direct collision course with Earth. With only about two weeks until the asteroid is estimated to hit, NASA brings aboard Harry Stamper, the best deep core driller on the planet, to train astronauts to drill into the asteroid, drop a nuclear device, blow apart the asteroid, and divert the two pieces from colliding with Earth. Claiming he is only the best because he works with the best, Harry forces NASA to recruit his rag-tag team of drillers to fly into space and save the world. But that is easier said then done as they not only face difficulties in the training program but unforeseen tricks that the asteroid throws at the ""astronauts"" in their attempt to accomplish the task at hand. The story for Armageddon, as outlandish and over-the-top as it may be, works exceedingly well in presenting a combination of fast-paced action sequences, sarcastic and, at times, irreverent humor, and dialed in emotions, even if they may be over played in several moments within the course of the film.
One of the great things that Jerry Bruckheimer films are known for, outside of the well-choreographed explosive action sequences, are his talented group of actors that are brilliantly cast in their roles. And Armageddon once again proves the truth of that statement, despite a few performances here and there that apply to the contrary. Bruce Willis, in the same genre that basically defined him as a key actor in Hollywood, takes center stage in almost every action sequence he's featured in and fills the screen with his sarcastic-toned humor and gritty, rock-solid attitude that works extraordinarily well with his character. Despite this being one of his few major release performances, Billy Bob Thornton still manages to give an excellent performance as the director of NASA who coordinates the mission to save the planet. Though his character isn't featured as much as the others, Thornton still realizes he is a centralized character and the emotions he expresses in his scenes will be needed to reflect the actions that are occurring or will occur later in the feature. Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler are perfect together as the film's romantic couple, though at times Affleck's performance was a tad on the wooden side, of which his acting ability has often been described by critics, but this time that being so only when he was asked to cry and near the end of the film when everyone, not just Affleck, seemed to wind down as the feature wrapped up. And another note ... Never let Affleck sing in a film ever again. Singing is definitely not his strongest talent and he proves that so in this film. And the most notable and worthy highlight of the cast has to be the marvelous, facetious and humorous performance given by Steve Buscemi, who has yet to portray a role that doesn't work for him in the least.
Overall, whatever quips you have with Jerry Bruckheimer, Michael Bay or the disaster genre in general, Armageddon is decisively one of the best action flicks in years and raises the bar for all others like to follow in its footsteps. Though his films are famous for their outlandish action sequences, the combative scenes in this film go beyond the normal expectation ten-times in that their choreography and set up transcend the amazing special effects that are used to execute the sequence. Though there are many things to compliment the filmmakers on in this film, the feature is far from perfect but not so much so that it is an utterly unbearable disaster (no pun intended). At times the situations involved are too unbelievable and far-fetched, though it to be suggested that they may not have been intended to taken seriously in the first place, that it takes away some of the film's credibility. It would have been better if the situations were more down-to-earth (once again, no pun intended) for the audience to take the plot of the film more seriously. And, yes, several moments in the feature are over-drawn and clichd but with the overall tone of the film being quite entertaining, one can forgive the filmmakers for such mistakes. Clearly if you don't enjoy action films or can bother leaving your head at the door (not entirely but for portions of the film) then Armageddon isn't for you but Bruckheimer flicks have the weird effect of making the most unlikely people fans of his work, so give it a shot before passing judgment.",1082160000,2,6470,4.8297297297297295

Interesting concept using a well drilling team to place charges on a large asteroid.
Much of the movie involves the relationships of those on Willis's drilling team.  There is comaraderie and infighting, yet, they get more serious as they get closer to take off and the rendezvous with meteor.
The special effects are a little more spectacular than those on Deep Impact, yet the scenes on the meteor itself are a little bit unreal.
The cast is an interesting broad spectrum of characters, many whom have come into their own since Armageddon.  I think for special effects and action Armageddon is much better than Deep Impact, yet the plot and story of the latter is much better.

 What I want to know, is: Why can't Bruce Willis appear in films with a plot that has some semblance of reality to it? ""The Sixth Sense"" and ""Pulp Fiction"" are great films, but then there are films like ""Armmagedon"", ""Tears of the Sun"", ""Die hard III"", ""Last Man Standing"", ""Hart's War"" and so on, ad nauseum.

  Michael Bay turns in great piece of work here which is not always the case, see""BadBoys""(stinky cheese).

1003528,4,6305169187,"Although, I do remember someone lending me this DVD ages ago, and it had a gag-reel on it. Mine doesn't :( Poor me. Anyway, watching this film on DVD was terrific, having only previously watched it on video (which no one wants to buy!!!) This movie has some of the cutest guys in it - Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Michael Clarke Duncan and Billy Bob Thornton?! My eyes must deceive me, as he always looks virtually unrecognisable in films, to what he looks like normally - unkempt, sleazy looking, and a craggy looking old man. (Is it just me?) And yes, I do have a thing for older men! This movie shot Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck to A-list stardom, and gave them Lord Of The Rings and Jennifer Lopez respectively.
I was quite surprised to see a couple of scenes that I hadn't seen before on the video. During the segment where the ""astronauts"" get the night off, you see Oscar praying, and Harry visiting his Dad. I literally did a double take when I saw these, especially since I've watched the movie many times. There was also another scene, but I forget what it was, or where it was now.
I own the 2-disc edition (which I can't find for the life of me on Amazon), so there's a lot more extras than listed here. Most of them are pretty tedious though, and I'm still fizzing about the gag-reel. It's so funny! I'll maybe watch the commentaries sometime, as there's two on this - the one with the NASA experts will be terrific on a night when I can't sleep. But the other one has Ben Affleck and Bruce Willis, which should be interesting. The extras are tedious, as they go through the special effects used for various scenes in the movie, and you've got some glorified assistant, who really had nothing to do with the movie, going into lengthy detail about the smallest thing. And use lots of fancy jargon, which definitely stupid people (like moi) can't understand. And never will understand. The DVD should have a warning sticker on it - ""Do Not Watch Extras If Stupid"".
You also get the music video to ""I Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" (one of the best love songs), and I'd seen this video many times, so I wasn't expecting there to be an introduction to the video by the members of Aerosmith! Cool.
Name one girl who hasn't cried at this movie. I am definitely not in that category. I originally saw this movie in the cinema, and had to go cry away to myself in the toilets afterwards (highly embarrassing). And then when I got it on video, I couldn't stop crying!!! People may say it's only a film, but it's so sad!!! Thankfully, I didn't cry at the first watching of this DVD. I did get a little teary, but not full-on crying. Oh guys crying get me going!! Anyone crying gets me going, who am I kidding!

A side plot introduces us to an oil-drilling platform in South Asia, with their personality conflicts. The owner is the most experienced oil driller; he is summoned to solve the problem: drill a hole in the asteroid to blast it into relatively harmless pieces. There is no excuse for failure.

The other overshoots the landing spot, and lands where it is hard to drill. They fall behind schedule. NASA now considers whether to remotely detonate the bomb. The film questions the judgment of Official Authority. The special effects of this film is better than 'Star Wars'. There is a blow-out on the drill; the attempt has failed! But the other drilling rig shows up just in time, and completes the job. The remote detonator has a problem; someone must stay and set it off. Harry Stamper volunteers to save the world. The space ship takes off, the bomb explodes the asteroid. This is an entertaining film in spite of the many, many cliches.
This story recalls ""Ragnarok"" by Ignatius Donnelly, which analyzed the common legends of mankind and explained them as the remembrance of a comet hitting the earth and causing great climatic changes.",1075161600,,1949,4.838323353293413

Really, don't bother with this one, unless you plan to turn the sound off and enjoy the movie purely on its visual merits.  In that department it is a home run.

Even if you don't mind the extreme camp value of it, the scenes of young children running around dressed as astronauts and playing with space shuttles was too much. the film is filled with factual errors and flaws that look as if the producers just didn't even care.  I'm perfectly capable of suspending disbelief and enjoying a science fiction movie, but Michael Bay seems to be under the school of thought that more explosions/drama = better movie.

The above being said, I like Bruce Willis. I like Liv Tyler. I like movies about space and the end of the world.  If you can get around all of the absurdity in this film, and just enjoy it for the action-filled special effects-laden popcorn movie it is, it does have some redeeming value.

1003534,4,6305169187,"Normally, the ""Criterion Collection"" is reserved for only the very best and most brilliant films but their additions of the Michael Bay blockbusters, ""The Rock"" and this, a big loud apocalyptic joy ride would indicate that even they need to make ends meet. I label Michael Bay films as a ""guilty pleasure"". They are often big, dumb, and loud movies with predictable crowd-pleasing endings and plot holes big enough to hold ""an asteriod the size of Texas"". Anyways if you too are a fan of these movies then you will no doubt want to add this to your collection.
""Armageddon"" is everyone's favorite disaster flick gone wild with a romantic subplot tacked on to please everyone. It seems that after a violent meteor shower destroys major sections of New York that high-level NASA officials have discovered that the worst is yet to come. We've got a giant asteroid (described as a ""global killer"") on its way here and it's up to the world's greatest deep-core driller (played by who else but Bruce Willis) to stop it. NASA seems to have pinpointed down to the last second how much exact time we have before it hits us but only Willis the hillbilly driller knows how to truly stop it.
After an hour of training mission montages, Willis and his group of slack-jawed sidekicks are off to do battle with the asteroid. Along the way, they lose about half of the crew and pick up a very annoying Russian astronaut. They end up landing a few miles outside of their planned destination and trouble ensues. The boys back home don't seem to have too much confidence in our heroes and want to remote detonate and call it a day. Bruce isn't having it though as he takes control of the mission and declares to anyone listening that he ""promised his girl he was coming home"". It seems that the satellite hook-up only works when Bruce has a cheesy overwritten line to perform.
If you're a fan of movies that boast action and special effects over any type of sensical plot then this is your movie. This particular DVD features ""The Director's Cut"" of the movie with alternate scenes. There are some scenes that have been omitted to make way for the new stuff but hey, you can't win them all. Lawrence Tierney shows up as Bruce's dad in this new version and gives him a cheesy speech about the joys of parenthood for him to use in the ""alternate version"" of his goodbye speech to Liv Tyler. The movie also comes with a hilarious ""gag reel"" and equally-entertaining audio commentaries. Well, the actor one is good but there is one with a bunch of real-life NASA folks that just goes on and on.
If you enjoyed ""Armageddon"" as much as I did then you'll probably want to own this double-disc collector's edition. If not, it's only a matter of time before the good people at Criterion decide to give ""Con-Air"" it's just due.",1069632000,4,2798,4.586826347305389

1003575,5,6305169187,"One of the biggest box office smash hits of 1998, ""Armageddon"" was a well-deserved box office hit and sometimes one of the most unfairly criticized movies of recent years. I'm surprised at the negative reviews that I've been reading on here and the low rating of 3.3 (as of writing this review) stars. This movie deserves at least a 4.3 on the rating!
Starring Bruce Willis as the disgruntled, often excessively strict drilling expert Harry Stamper, ""Armageddon"" is a chilling but at the same time, fun film about a giant asteroid around the size of the state of Texas hurtling straight towards earth, threatening to destroy all life and possibly the planet itself in approximately 18 days and mankind, under threat of extinction, looks up to the expert drilling knowledge of Harry Stamper and his crew of grouchy disgruntled drillers to drill a large hole in the asteroid, send a powerful nuke down the hole and blast the asteroid apart by detonating the nuke. It all begins on an oil rig in the middle of the Pacific Ocean or somewhere around there with the outrageous Harry Stamper playing golf against a Greenpeace ship, and the Greenpeace guys ducking for cover to avoid getting hit by the flying golf balls. It's actually quite funny to watch even though I would lean more towards the Greenpeace people and also Harry laughing at and ridiculing them. However the laughs are instantly ended when a team of government officials arrive on Stamper's oil rig and bring him to NASA headquarters to tell him about the crisis of the approaching asteroid.
While Bruce Willis' character Harry Stamper is the main character in the movie, my favorite character is the odd goofball Russian astronaut Lev Andropov (Played by Swedish actor Peter Stormare). His funny personality adds quite a bit to this movie. My other favorite is Rock Hound, with his bumbling and highly eccentric personality and watching him mess up or goof off provides some good laughs. Most of the rest range from good to excellent to downright annoying.
The romance between Grace Stamper (Liv Tyler) and A.J. Frost is pretty contrived and could've been left out but that's just my opinion. Most of the negativities are negated by the pros of this movie. ""Armageddon"" is an extremely adrenaline-pumping action flick with a highly intense visual assault (in a good way), and a good amount of comic humor occasionally in parts of the movie. Many seem to dismiss this as more Hollywood pap but I beg to differ. ""Armageddon"" is just plain fun but also it is rather unsettling because the possibility of being hit by a global killer asteroid is always present but also there is the possibility of being able to prevent such a disaster from occurring. It's for these things that to me, makes this movie so awesome yet scary at the same time. No wonder it was a smash hit at the box office. I wouldn't necessarily say that I highly recommend buying this movie but ""Armageddon"" is definitely worth checking out for those who missed it when it was on the big screen. This is just my opinion but man this movie was a brutal, thrilling ride when seeing it on the big screen and when it came to the small screen, the punch was greatly reduced but still, it's an awesome popcorn movie. Just sit back and enjoy the ride. Doomsday has never sounded like so much fun.",1062806400,,3315,4.737024221453288

I give this movie a 5 because it has all aspects that I love in a movie: action, stars, love and a teary patriotic ending. I agree that Pearl Harbor looks a little TOO similar to Armageddon, especially the end. The girls are practically wearing the same dresses!
Yes, I'm sure there are a lot of bloopers, mistakes and aspects that are totally unbelievable, if not disbelievable, but I don't care. I didn't first watch the movie to look for mistakes, or look into my NASA handbook to make sure that everything was to code.

3. The small meteors that hit New York would have burned up in the atmosphere before they even reached earth, and if some survived they would be to small to cause any damage
4. The asteroid doesn't even look like one. A large asteroid would just be a large rock. It wouldn't have all those spikey rocks and other chunks of rock
5. At the beginning of the movie, it says that the asteroid that killed the dinsoaurs struck with the force of 10,000 hiroshima bombs. That isn't even close. The asteroid that killed the dinsoaurs was close to about 1 billion hiroshima bombs
6. WAn asteroid of that size wouldn't just leave a crater,it would split the earth in two
7. If the scientists discovered an asteroid 700 miles across 18 days before it would hit earth, they must not have very good technology

Ben Affleck co-stars with the daughter of Aerosmith's Steven Tyler, Liv, as well as Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi (who is very comical here), Owen Wilson, William Fichtner, and Will Patton.
The movie was very well done, and the action carried throughout.  What I didn't like about the movie, and what kept it from reaching 4 maybe 5 stars is the lack of reality it possessed.  Just the idea of having two, not one, but two space ships land on a meteor traveling at millions of miles per hour is crazy.  I realize it's a work of fiction, but come on.  Some sense of authenticity should be present.  I liked the movie, don't get me wrong, there was just some parts that lost the intensity for me.  Other than that the movie was excellent.

1003637,4,6305169187,"I recently saw ""Armageddon"" for the first time on DVD and thought it was a fantastic example of movie entertainment.  It's an excellently-produced science fiction/action/adventure movie.  The special effects are top-notch and truly breathtaking.  Script and character development are above average for this type of film--but of course, this is NOT ""Othello""!  The storyline is extremely interesting and the movie's pacing is packed with edge-of-your-seat suspense, with just enough deadpan comedic relief.  I found no fault with the actor's performances--Bruce Willis does his usually-good ""John Wayne"" and considering this is sci-fi, the others gave FAR less wooden performances than, say, would be seen on ANY episode of ""Star Trek: The Next Generation.""  The movie could've done without the dumb Aerosmith tunes in the soundtrack, but that's a minor criticism.
Since I thoroughly enjoyed the film, I was dismayed to see a lot of negative comments by Amazon.com reviewers who appear (in my opinion) to be ""cinema snobs.""  And after ""reading between the lines"" of these reviews, I see a pattern of thought--which I thoroughly disagree with.
The underlying ""theme"" of ""Armageddon"" is simply that for the most part, Americans--in addition to American values and technology--save the world.  The attributes that Americans (although certainly not exclusively) are known for--courage, heroism, patriotism, both stubborn individuality AND one-for-all/all-for-one team determination--are very much a part of this story.
I wonder if many of the negative reviewers were put off by the ""Rah-Rah USA!"" tone of the film.  There is a certain type of liberal/artsy, anti-American, anti-NASA, anti-patriot attitude that would loathe a movie like ""Armageddon""--and such a mindset would probably color such a reviewer's comments.  That's unfortunate, because although ""Armageddon"" is very much an ""American"" story, it also exhilaratingly examines some of the very BEST elements of the all-inclusive human spirit.",1042070400,,1996,5.69023569023569

1003641,1,6305169187,"""Armageddon,"" which is at the top of my list of the most awful and embarrassing films ever made, is not entirely worthless. It is a lesson in how not to make a film. It's bombastic, monotonous, loud, over-staged, emotionally empty, crude, humorless, unsophisticated, over the top, and entirely irrelevant. Now, I can already hear the rejoinders: lighten up, it's only a movie. True, but then again, nothing is ""only a movie,"" given that ""Armageddon"" cost millions upon millions of dollars to make, earned even more, and was seen by countless numbers of people. And given the centrality of film to our culture and the ways in which filmgoers personalize, love, hate, and discuss film, we can't be so complacent to say it's ""only a movie.""
Michael Bay is the kind of director who wields his camera as if it were a jackhammer.  Jerry Bruckheimer has his name on many an expensive and high-grossing film but has yet to make a single noteworthy and intellectually important cultural contribution. Put the two together and you get a disaster. ""Armageddon"" has caricatures for characters, a silly and wholly unoriginal premise (how many ""save the world"" films must we endure?), forgetful and unintelligent dialog, ultra-thin human relationships, comical situations (even though the situations are supposed to involve danger and seriousness), and, above all, what could possibly be the most god-awful, empty, annoying, and artless visual style ever to make it to the silver screen. Michael Bay's visual language is the celluloid equivalent of the Tower of Babel. The rapid-fire editing, in which no image seems to last for more than five seconds, might seem unique and impressive (some excellent films have been made with this type of MTV-style approach), but Bay's style doesn't work because he has nothing to say with his camera, nor does he employ his technique with any sense of authority or judgment; he doesn't understand nor realize the artistic and ideological aspects of such jarred aesthetics. There's nothing deep underneath the surface, and, what is more, the frenetic pacing and editing become monotonous and meaningless the second it becomes clear that Bay does not understand changes and nuances of tone. Instead of being awed, the viewer is pummeled. It's incredibly stupid, to put it blatantly.
Everything in the film is on the surface.  Even though a huge meteor is hurling towards the earth (and will wipe out all life -- oh my God!!!), there's no sense of urgency. The emotions are obvious, simplistic, and ham-fisted, cued with visuals and music that tell you what to feel and when (Hollywood films in general are adept at doing this). There's not even a remote sense of passion between Affleck and Tyler (Affleck's delivery is as wooden and perfunctory as usual). And the characteristics of the other characters are presented in the same ham-fisted, egregious manner: yes, yes, we know that Buscemi has some odd quirks; yes, yes, we know that William Fichtner takes his job seriously. And, gee, thanks Mr. Bay for the close-ups of Billy Bob's leg brace, just in case I didn't notice that he was crippled.
Of course, one could argue that ""Armageddon"" is a fun romp, but it's evident that Bay and Co. intended the film, aside from a few apparently comic situations (which aren't funny at all), to be a serious disaster movie. Well, it's not serious, but it certainly is a disaster.",1040860800,10,3393,4.992932862190813
1003642,2,6305169187,"Armageddon is the low-intelligence, B-type film that seems to have become so typical of uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer, with the exception of last year's Black Hawk Down, which I have not seen, yet, and which has gotten positive reviews. The plot structure is very weak, and the characters are paper thin.
The film opens with a meteor shower raining down on the earth from space, debris from an asteroid the size of Texas. After a sequence of mass destruction taking place in a big city, the government learns of the Texas-sized asteroid, and that it's going to strike Earth, which would result in the end of mankind.
The solution is to form a group of expert drillers who must travel to the asteroid and drill a hole through it, so the asteroid splits in half. That way, hopefully, the split asteroid chunks would miss Earth on it course through space. So a misfit group of oil drillers find themselves the ones for the job. The fate of planet Earth rests on their shoulders . . .
In my opinion, Armageddon is worth the rental price, nothing more. The film is miscast, and, as I've said before, the storyline is weak and the character development is almost nonexistent. In my opinion, at least. Rated PG-13. 2 stars out of 5.",1040083200,5,1227,4.63302752293578

The summer of 98 featured two wanna-be blockbusters that featured ""big asteroid hitting the planet and everybody dies"" scenarios; Deep Impact and Armageddon.  Armageddon was the worst of the two, and is clearly just another mainstream, crowd pleasing piece of film from wanna-be hotshot director Michael Bay (Bad Boys, The Rock, Pearl Harbor).  Bruce Willis stars as the leader of a group of oil drillers who are recruited to drill a hole in the big rock, drop a nuke, and go back home.  Naturally all doesn't go well, and we get an overly healthy dose of explosions, thrills, chills, and things we've all seen before.  Plus, there is also a love story in all of this (naturally) between driller Ben Affleck and Willis' daughter played by Liv Tyler.  Predictability is abound here, you'll know what will happen before it happens, and while Armageddon may be entertaining for some, it is mindnumbingly dull, and sometimes downright stupid.  The large cast also features Billy Bob Thornton, Owen Wilson, Michael Clarke Duncan, Steve Buscemi, and Keith David among others.  My only question here is why is this part of the Criterion Collection?  Who is Michael Bay paying to have this released on Criterion?

Billy Bob Thornton is also worth mentioning as he adds a touch of class to the star-studded cast.

The only way to destroy the asteroid is to drill down into it and plant a nuclear warhead inside to blow it up.  Enter Willis, the owner of an offshore drilling rig, Tyler, his daughter, and Affleck, an employee of Willis' who is in love with Tyler, much to the disgust of Willis.  Willis is regarded as the best offshore driller in the world.  Thus, he is summoned by Thornton to help destroy the rogue asteroid.  Willis and his band of misfits are sent to NASA to undergo space training in preparation for liftoff into space aboard 2 space shuttles.  The object is to land on the asteroid itself, drill the hole, plant the bomb, and escape before it detonates.  One shuttle is lost, but Willis and his crew manage to land on the asteroid and drill the hole.  However, there is a malfunction with the bomb, and the only way to detonate it is manually, so someone must stay behind and sacrifice themselves for the good of the earth.
There are some neat moments in the film, such as the group singing ""Leaving on a Jet Plane"" and the actual space scenes are good as well. Steve Buscemi's character was my favorite.  I enjoyed his wise-cracking remarks and cynical views throughout the film. This is a good action packed, fun film to watch more than once.",1028592000,2,1427,4.586614173228346
1003682,2,6305169187,"Movies are a chance to lose yourself and escape reality for a while, so I'm usually willing to let a few implausible ideas slip by.  But in Armageddon, there are so many major flaws that it becomes unforgivable.  The premise of the movie involves a huge asteriod--the size of Texas, implying a few hundred miles in diameter--which is heading towards earth.  To stop it, NASA has decided to detonate a nuclear weapon after landing on it and drilling down to...800 feet? Futhermore, this powerful blast is going to blow the asteroid into exactly two pieces, both of which will just miss earth provided the weapon is detonated In Time.
Since a highly trained team of astronauts apparently can't learn to drill a hole, NASA instead is convinced to let a drilling crew learn a crash course in being astronauts.  Bruce Willis leads the crew, challenged for authority constantly by Ben Affleck, who is dating Bruce's daughter played by Liv Tyler.  The crew land on the astronaut, where they encounter hazards galore.  Here is where the reality suspension really occurs.  After an explosion, one astronaut is sent spaceward by the lack of gravity; yet, another astronaut is able to grab them and pull them back to the surface.  The asteroid's surface is ""iron ferrite"", which if it existed would be a compound between iron and...iron.  Things continue at this pace for the duration of the movie, leaving me wondering if Jerry Bruckheimer was absent the day they taught science in science class.  This movie was featured on the web site, ""Insultingly Stupid Movie Physics"", if that gives you an idea of the degree of bloopers.
The movie is of course full of edge-of-your-seat action, with the race to get the hole drilled In Time.  The action is intense, and there are some scenes that stir the emotions.  But the emotion is cheap, as is the story itself.  In the end, it is a totally mindless action movie that requires complete suspension of logic and realism.",1028505600,6,1953,4.811377245508982

Throw in a group of equally skilled misfits and a love story subplot between Ben Affleck and Bruce's daughter, and non-stop action with killer special effects and a soundtrack to match, and you've got a great evening's entertainment.
The plot is simple:  a killer meteor is heading toward Earth, and Bruce and his crew of drillers are sent to drill a hole in it, drop in a nuclear device, and detonate it as they speed back home.

1003709,4,6305169187,"I am walking a thin line here. Contrary to my previous review, ""Armageddon"" has been a personal favorite action movie of mine for some years. But even I admit that it has as much intelligence as a pop-up book. However, I will try to avoid being a serious critic in my review and I will also avoid patronizing.
The story is set in the present day (Or in Summer 1998. You decide). A giant asteroid the size of Texas has been spotted coming towards Earth. NASA, led by Dan Truman (Billy Bob Thornton) is totally unprepared for such a thing. Worse, they have only 18 days to stop it. The only hope for Earth is to send the world's best deep core oil driller Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis) and a team of his drillers to combat the threat. If you don't spend too much time laughing at the improbabilities, you might find some of the dialogue (Intentionally) hilarious. Steve Buscemi is particularly likable as ""Rockhound"", a horny geologist (""Do you think we'll hazard pay out of this""). However, General Kimsey (Keith David) is pretty much correct when he states ""The fate of the planet is in the hands of a bunch of retards I wouldn't trust with a potato gun"".
The problem with ""Armageddon"" is lack of focus. Apparently, the screenwriters think that by putting a romance story into the plot that a larger audience will be attracted to the film. So, a subplot between Stamper's daughter Grace (Liv Tyler) and one of his top drillers A.J (Ben Affleck) is put into place. This only drags the film's length and, to add insult to injury, variations of Aerosmith's ""I Don't Wanna Miss a Thing"" are played during these scenes. I also never felt much for the A.J and Grace characters, since the only signs that they ever love one another are shown by using pretty close ups.
I, for one, try to relax when I watch popcorn flicks like this. However, even I noticed how phony this film is. And I am not talking about the plot either. I mean, if you thought ""2001"" was unrealistic in it's space travel depiction, check this film out. The sets look like that; Wood and cement, rather than rock and iron. So where did that budget of $100 million or so go? Must have been the bill given to McDonald's for all that merchandising.
In my previous review, I mentioned that the military is shown negatively in this film. While the depiction isn't always positive towards them (The higher ranking leaders attempt to detonate the nuclear device on the asteroid's surface and they don't put much faith in NASA's plan to use drillers), the producers had to have military cooperation in this movie. Thus, most of the scenes showing the training have expensive, high tech military gear and planes as props or in the background shots. Come on, your going to have a briefing in the same hanger that is also occupied by a B-2 stealth bomber and two SR-71 Blackbirds? These civilians (Both on and off the screen) have more opportunity to admire these advanced warplanes than do many of the same military servicemen training them.
But, like I said earlier, it would be moronic to take this movie seriously. Like ""North by Northwest"", ""Star Wars"" and The James Bond Series, this is one movie not to be treated in the same class as ""The Godfather"". It's a disaster flick, like ""The Poseidon Adventure"" or ""The Towering Inferno"" and if you take it as fun, pointless and overall escapist entertainment, you will do fine and probably even get a kick out of it.
Now as to whether this film deserved treatment from the Criterion Collection. No doubt, this is a great special edition set, with two audio commentary tracks, a special director's cut and various documentaries on the movie's making. I am just surprised that it is preserved by such a brand name company. But it's satisfying and worth shelling out the dough for.",1023840000,5,3780,4.626488095238095

1.  The only quality performance came from Bruce Willis and it was an uphill battle to make his character 3 dimensional, handicapped with the script and some really cringingly bad (funny) speechs he had to make.  Most of the oilworkers were so stereotypical it defied belief.  ""Let's see... we need a big biker guy, and a new age mellow guy, and a guy who loves to hang out with stripers.  That was the extent of their personalities.  I felt like I was watching card board cutouts.  I don't need to mention how awful Afleck was.
2. Everyone else has pointed out the scientific and story plot blunders, inaccuracies, and problems so nuff ced.
3. Obviously Bruckheimer/Bay et al have no concept of the phrase, ""Less is more"".  Does everything have to be loud?  Can you they go more than 3 seconds without an edit?  I felt like the had about 15 minutes of a movie and threw everything else in a blender until they got the 2 hours +
4.  The most glaring problem: The script.  I would have laughed if I wasn't in so much pain from this reallllly bad dialogue.  Professionally, I felt bad for the actors.  Of course they were well compensated financially.

I read one review from a reviewer who was annoyed that so many people rated things as a '5' when that top rating should be reserved for movies or CDs etc, that we'd all still be talking about 50 years from now. I disagree. Ratings are here to give us a rough idea of how good something is in the scope of today, not in the scope of half a century.
That being said, Armageddon earns a four in my book, and for several reasons. Enough people have reiterated the plot so I won't go into that. As for the movie as a whole, yes, it assumes you're looking for a good time and not a real end-of-the-world, religious allegory. But the point that a lot of this movie's bashers are forgetting to take into account is that the movie knows this and does not try to be anything else. It goes all out (WAY to the extreme) to have fun, and for this film, it works. It's big, it's loud, it's grandiose - and it wouldn't have worked any other way. The only reason I take off a star is b/c, yeah, granted, it's definitely not Oscar material (not that the Academy always picks the most deserving films anyway) and the dialogue could have been a little better. And the shot were we get a close look at Affleck's full mouth of capped, sparkling white teeth is really disturbing.
For a summer flick - and taking into consideration how much time of the movie's two hours was spent either in a space shuttle or in an action scene - the film does quite a better than average job of at least TRYING to give just about each character a little bit of dimension, which I appreciated. And the effects are great, that goes without saying.
But my fav. part of the film was the score - it still gets me every time when the scene with the president's speech comes on and the drillers are getting on the shuttle. Yeah, it's cliched, overdone, and cheesy but who cares? And the scene where Harry is talking to Grace right before he's about to make the ultimate sacrifice? Let's just put it this way - last summer, I didn't go to summer school and I had so little to do, I just watched tv all day. My movie of choice was always Armageddon and even though I ended up watching it maybe more than 30 times back to back, I cried every time.
This movie is one of my secret guilty pleasures along with ID4 (which other ppl are coincidently putting down for lack of intelligence, but I thought did a great job for what it was supposed to do) and whenever I want to give my brain a break and just have some fun, a good laugh, and an exhilarating ride, I pop it into the VCR.

The script of ""Armageddon"" attacks the threatening rock with the idea of landing the roughnecks and nuclear weapons  onto the rock itself. Only when planted as deep as 800 feet below the rock's surface - accessible only by the wonder drill machine pioneered by Bruce Willis's character, will the nuke be able to destroy the rock. Besides the expected problems - that just getting to the rock will require sneaking past a murderous screen of smaller asteroid fragments the bigger rock carries around like a private asteroid belt, that getting to the fault will require drilling through metals and minerals never encountered on earth and facinf deadly pockets of trapped steam - will be the roughnecks themselves, led by Bruce Willis and staffed by guys like AJ (Ben Affleck) and Rockhound (Steve Buscemi). (They're geniuses, but like Rockhound chose drilling because it gives them a chance to use their intellects and lots of explosives).
""Armageddon"" is a better flick than critics - guys who complain about ""popcorn movies"" and who like to diss this flick as another testosterone-filled Bruckheimer/Simpson production - give it credit for. The action is relentless, but you never get punch drunk, and the typical macho characters - tough generals, brilliant scientists and a patriarchal president who looks inspired by FDR (not unlike the guy who played the president in ""The Rock"") - are never as heroic as the rebel-roughnecks who save the Earth.

The visuals and FX are fantastic and Bay's direction is thankfully lees frenzied than his previous films Bad Boys (1992) and The Rock (1995). Silly and jingoinistic in parts, it's still a great action film as only Bruckheimer could deliver. Enjoy.",1018656000,,632,5.205882352941177

If you're upgrading to a widescreen TV thinking this DVD will showcase the new technological wonders of prograssive scan and 16x9 flat screens you'll be sorely disappointed when you find that there is no anamorphic version on this disc. That's right, friends, even with all the other extras, they couldn't be bothered to include the one feature that truly showcases the cinematography and special effects (which are, let's face it, this film's halmarks cuz it sure ain't the acting and script).

1003748,4,6305169187,"I surprised myself by liking this film on the whole. It does have some weak points, which I am only too happy to point out, but this is not only the most spectacular film since ""Titanic"", it is also an example of how digital special effects can succeed in the hands of a top notch professional crew.
Before I surprise myself too much, let me point out that ""Armageddon"" is scientifically sophomoric. Time and again, the story defies the laws of physics.
As in ""Independence Day"" and ""Deep Impact"", we are expected to believe that an object in outer space the size of Texas could get to within a few days of Earth before we detected it. This is especially silly in ""Armageddon"" because the killer asteroid is depicted as a very bright one. Any child could spot it without binoculars.
This time the United States government turns to a bunch of lovable roughnecks, whose occupation is drilling for oil. I suppose the capitalist in us can buy the idea that the planet would be saved from a natural catastrophe by people who spend their days plundering it. In the last several years, America has been increasingly portrayed in movies as the unofficial ruler of the world. Other nations are cast as either obedient or unruly children. When disaster strikes, we call all the shots. I have no political stance on this point of view, but it seems to me that, if this is the best team we can find to save the world, the kids are in a heap of trouble.
What puts ""Armageddon"" head and shoulders above its competition is that its makers created an escapist entertainment with wild abandon. I don't think they expected it to be anything more than a comic book emotionally. The emphasis is not on intellect, it is on craftsmanship. First they created state of the art special effects. Then, instead of dwelling on their accomplishments, they edited these scenes into numerous very fast cuts. They were so confident that some scenes are shaky and out of focus. The result is a feeling of being on a thrill ride.
There are four great actors in ""Armageddon"" - Bruce Willis, Billy Bob Thornton, Liv Taylor and Ben Affleck. They have a large presence in the film and are allowed to ham it up as much as they want to. This works. On the surface, they give their usual great performance. Underneath, they convey to us that this movie has nothing to do with the end of the world and everything to do with entertainment.
It is getting tiresome, by the way, to find so many people connecting pictures like ""Armageddon"" with the Millennium Doomsday Machine. In truth, this flick is a direct descendant of the Granddaddy of all disaster films. This was a 1961 film called ""The Last Voyage"". It set the tone for all future works on the subject. The current crop of end of the world movies actually reverse themselves. Mankind is now seen as able to avert anything that comes its way. We were annihilated way back in 1959 in the excellent ""On the Beach"". In 1983 we became extinct twice, first in ""The Day After"" and then in ""Testament"". The last time we faded into the sunset was in ""The Rapture"" in 1991.
""Armageddon"" is about as good as its type of movie gets. There is no need to put your thinking cap on or to analyze anything. Just enjoy the ride. If you have a home theater system, the audio is amazing.",1017273600,,3281,4.534569983136594
1003749,4,6305169187,"I enjoyed 'Armageddon'. I generally back off from mainstream Hollywood stuff, since it tends to be inane and cliched. 'Armageddon' treads a very thin line, for it borders on becoming just another annoying populist flick, but it manages to avoid such a calamity for the most part.
That is not to deny that there are a few cliches here and there, and one or two cringeworthy moments of the type that made 'Independence Day' such a travesty. But such moments are commendably brief, and are easily forgiven in the light of some of the film's delights, as are some of the more commercial, mainstream elements which never quite manage to override the finer qualities of the film. Visually, it is stunning and original. The cast are simply fine, and are given a decent script to work with. Amongst the supporting actors, Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi and Owen Wilson shine. The film moves between witty comedic moments and tense drama with no noticeable awkwardness or disjunction.
You will enjoy this apocalyptic tale, though after the events of September 11th, its undertones may seem darker and more real than we might otherwise have thought.",1015459200,,1142,4.922279792746114

Notice alot of the same people directed, or starred in those movies. point is they were all made with a fast paced plot that makes it enjoyable (exclude WWWest) but when it is all said and done was it a good movie, for me, indepence day and mib were, the rock and godzilla were not, of course WWWest was awefull but nobody liked that flick so its not really worth mentioning. Sometimes because of the actors that are playing the roles make the movie funny enough, cause we know the action will be good the movie becomes good. I think armageddon was good. not very good, not great, but good, good+ maybe. and in the world of over the top blockbusters thats all you can really ask for.  if you noticed the first half played like a comedy and the 2nd half like an action/suspence show.  I liked both parts. (...) Oh yea i forgot to mention i thought pearl harbor was bad.  I really really enjoyed it the first time i saw it, now i don't as much but i am going to drive an hour and a half to get the criterion collection of armageddon for a decent price, locally its 50.00 clams ouch,i can get it for 24.96 or some similiar price.  Liv tyler is crossed eyed though i will agree to that, and not that pretty, and not a very good actress (no disrespect liv, keep truckin!!!!) Ben is not a good actor and i didn't really realize that until i watched some special features on jay and silent bob strike back. im still debateing on buying good will hunting, maybe maybe not. i do have to say i really notice and hate the time frame used in the last 30 minutes of the show, or last 13 minutes maybe where they keep saying can you dig this deep of a hole in some amount of time then after they do that, we got 38 minutes to get the bomb down there, then after than we got 18 minutes to lift off. seems a bit unrealistic but oh yea were talking about armageddon. oh yea one last complaint at one point billy bob thorton tells willis to tell the press he has never failed, willis says he has never quit and billy said that will have to do. but later willis say ""i have never missed a depth i was aiming for"" or paraphrase you have never failed, does anybody understand the neverending stream of (...) that flows from my fingers. ok i liked it goodnight",1015286400,,2490,4.266949152542373
1003771,3,6305169187,"And it is many things.  It's a guy movie, with lots of cool explosions and electronic gadgets.  It's a science fiction movie (emphasis on the word FICTION) with errors so enormous, I'm sure actual scientists found it pants-wettingly funny.  It's a terrific showcase for American stereotypes not just of themselves, but of the world around them.  Note how the entire world is hanging on the president of the United States' every word.  Excuse me, but would the French be listening to Jacques Chirac, their President?  Wouldn't the Iraqis be listening to Saddam Hussein?  Wouldn't the Indians be listening to PM Vajpayee?
Another stike against this movie is that it was done before in almost exactly the same way the year before...in the movie ""Deep Impact,"" which was considerably better because it focused less on the comet hurtling towards Earth and more on the main characters' ways of coping with what seemed like certain death.
Of course, despite some tense moments, the guys come through, just like the crew in Deep Impact, though their heroism is somewhat more poignant because they don't actually get to go home.  Armageddon's cast isn't nearly as good, either, mostly due to Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler, who is cast more as scenery than as a serious character.  I still don't understand why people think she's beautiful...she's cross-eyed and looks too much like her father, which brings me to my next complaint about the film...that damned Aerosmith song.  Normal people stopped listening to Aerosmith years ago, and their descent into the white trash niche is pretty much complete in this film.
In closing...good special effects, stupid plot, some good performances by the supporting characters, Willis Affleck & Tyler were all terrible, no research done on theoretical physics or space travel, and a destruction of New York that is probably too real still for some people to watch.",1014854400,2,1890,5.048231511254019

1003778,3,6305169187,"Armageddon is not my favorite movie, I will admit.  It is highly improbable, fairly predictable, overly-patriotic, and emotionally manipulative.  But in its defense, anyone who sat down to watch this movie expecting Oscar material was a fool to begin with and deserved to be disappointed, and certainly had no grounds for writing some of the absurdly critical reviews that have been submitted to this forum.  For heaven's sake, it's a Bruce Willis movie; of *course* things are going to be blown up.  It's an action movie; of *course* it's going to be male-dominated, and the one or two female characters will be there solely to provide a romantic interest for a male protagonist and/or to provide eye candy for the predominantly male audience.  You didn't have to sit down to watch the movie to conclude the plot is improbable; just reading that it's about drilling on an asteriod while scanning the back of the box in the store would tell you that much.  And people of different ethnicities and nationalities were not nearly as grossly and offensively stereotyped as the characters in other recent sci-fi movies like Star Wars Episode I.
Armageddon is what it is.  It's an entertaining, visually impressive, over-the-top action movie.  And with smart actors like Billy Bob Thornton, Steve Buscemi, and (arguably) Ben Affleck, it's smarter and funnier than most other big brash blow-em-up flicks.  Heck, do what a lot of college kids do--sit down to watch it with a beer or two, and every time there's a gratuitous shot of a US flag, take a drink.

So you have an oil drilling rig crew turned astronaut to drill a 200 foot hole in a iron asteraoid the size of Texas?  So what's so unbelievable about that?  Having seen the flexibility of drilling crews lately have you?  LOL!  Well anyway, I especially liked the Russian Space Station sequence.  ""Don't touch nothing!""
Well I guess I appreciated this film a little more than the average person after having some core drilling experience myself.  Knowing what the Willis's crew had to do, I had a little more respect for the undertaking.  Drilling ain't easy folks!  Drill down one pipe/auger and then disconnect, add another, reconnect, drill it down, repeat ad nauseum.  Then when you're done, just reverse that method.  Very fun indeed.  So yeah, I had a little more appreciation for the film for this very reason.

And what better (or shall I say worse?) to drive this point home than the insipid 1998 blockbuster ARMAGEDDON?
If you ask me this is nothing more than one of those really bad 1970s disaster films with an all-star cast and a bigger budget.  There is not one original character or subplot.  The jokes are so over-recycled that you can almost hear them begging to be buried in a landfill.  The only thing really worth watching - don't think of me as bloodthirsty - are the scenes of carnage and destruction.  But not even those scenes can save it from the plot holes that are so big that a the Texas-sized asteroid could easily fit inside.  And here are just a few:
1.  How could a group of oil riggers (no disrespect toward real oil riggers) as idiotic as those in the movie make a group of well trained astronauts look like bumbling nincompoops?
2.  How is it that the smaller asteroids only hit huge cities like New York City, Paris, or Shanghai?
3.  How could the asteroid be cut into two neat pieces without smaller debris (like a piece the size of Rhode Island) falling to earth?
4.  How come it is called ARMAGEDDON when the world gets saved?

Well, a group of oil drillers being chosen to save the world is quite impossible & the circumstances that followed were quite unbelievable, but the film & its set had its fine moments.  The drillers were funny at times & of course, the brewing romance between Bruce's daughter & his drilling colleague adds a little spark.  They try to make it a tearjerker at the end by making the great father/hero of the world sacrifice his own life to (1) save the earth & (2) be a martyr & take the place of Ben Afleck who was supposed to be the one to press the stuck button & die on the surface of the meteor.  Hhhmmm, again, there's the Hollywoodish commercialism head leering again giving the viewers a blow in their common sense.  Anyway, it's entertaining just the same.  Oh & yeah, great soundtrack.

Micheal Bay is also the worst Director teamed with the worst producer Jerry Bruckheimer to creat a movie so superficial and MTV flashy (very particular of their style of film making) that only the dull-minded really enjoy this movie. Several reasons why this movie was bad other than the forementioned people/ideas: 1: Wouldn't it be easier to train astronauts to drill vs. drillers to be astronauts? 2: The OVER-dramatic scene where the ""drillers"" are walking to the space shuttle cutting back (flashy, MTV style, mind you) to Liv Tyler and Billy Bob Thorton looking toward the sky each in a different pose behind an American flag ALL while an Aerosmith song is playing in the background... 'nuff said. 3: The bad dialogue and ... one-liners including stereotype comic-reliefs (or would that be relieves???) 4: a Michael Bay and Jerry Bruckheimer film. 5: Phantom's Ben Affleck (though awesome in Kevin Smith films). If you want Superfical, unrealistic, MTV, Aerosmith, One-liner after One-liner see: ...-a-geddon. If you want a realistic movie about cometary evolution (which armageddon is supposed to be about) see: Deep Impact.

In fact, the editing is so schizophrenic and so unyielding, that the barrage of images flashing across your TV screen is likely to induce an epileptic seizure, even if you aren't prone to having them. That could be forgiven perhaps, if the story had enough intelligence to make it worth the risk. Unfortunately the plot in Armageddon is nothing more than a vehicle to drive the action sequences. And what a perfect topic they chose to accomplish their goal! I mean, whenever the action lets up for more 30 seconds, all they have to do to get it going again is shower meteorites on the unwitting population of Earth. Wheeeeee, what great fun, and lots of cool explosions too! This movie is obviously geared towards Attention Deficit, adolescent teenagers.

From all the people that i know who have this DVD, they all treasure this DVD because of the great audio commentary. I can honestly say that I've yet to watch the film by itself. I can only watched this movie with the audio commentary, because frankly the film is very bad.
The four principles in the main commentary track, Director Michael Bay, Producer Jerry Bruckheimer, Bruce Willis, and Ben Affleck all bring in their viewpoint of what happened during the shoot. But the greatness of the commentary track is how it makes us realize how badly the film was planned and executed. Ben Affleck's input towards the commentary is hysterical! He absolutely rips everyone in the film. I'm very surprised how Michael Bay was able to hire him as the lead for Pearl Harbor after how much he rips into Armageddon.
In the New York Times, critic Elvis Mitchell did an interview with the president of Criterion Collection. Mr. Mitchell commented that one of his favorite DVD is Armageddon. So for those ""serious"" film buffs who are ashamed of owning this DVD, don't!

1003895,4,6305169187,"To all those out there who criticized this film, I say ""Dude, what's yer problem?!"" This is NOT a film justifying Einstein's theory of relativity! It is a high tension, physics go to hell, tongue in cheek sci-fi THRILLER that does NOT have one dull moment. You got problems with the real physics? Well, so do I, but GET OVER IT! Bruce is Bruce. Liv Tyler may not exude acting skills, but she does a good job of showing her emotion, and giggles okay during the `animal cracker in the low plains scene' with Ben Affleck (watch the movie. You'll see it). Okay, now to the brass tacks.
This film came out about the same time as Deep Impact, another excellent `end of the world by comet' movie. But where DP has Tia Leone as the star, Armaggedon has Bruce. This is a much `harder' film, and a total guy flick with a `take no prisoners' attitiude towards the action and story. That's all there is to it.
A lone retiree with a huge backyard reflective telescope discovers a rogue asteroid the size of Texas. He notifies the military, who discover the asteroid is on a collision course with Earth. Our scientists determine it to be a `planet killer'. Just firing nukes at it will not change the course, the nukes will have to be placed inside the asteroid. Hence, the government decides to drill. The best driller in the world? You guessed it. Bruce. With only 18 days left before total annihilation, it's decided astronauts can't be trained to drill as quickly as drillers can be trained to survive 24 hours in space. Hence, Bruce's team. And his team, is a group of total misfits. Owen Wilson is the free spirited inner space guy, Steve Buscemi is Rockhound (possibly the horniest man on earth). Michael Clarke Duncan is Bear, a HUGE man (imagine, holding the government hostage unless they let him spend the summer at the White House). BUT they and the rest of the crew hold the fate of the world in their hands. The government physicals and mental evaluation scenes of each team member show them to be borderline psychotics.
And into space they go. First to meet with a Russian Space Station. And from there, the action, the color, the tension, and the absolutute beauty of the CG's is non-stop.
Those who have read my reviews know I try not to give away the store. You have to see the movies for yourself. This movie is cutting edge. It is a masterpiece of light, flash, and color. Guys, the surround sound and special effects of meteors hitting the earth is room-shaking and has to be experienced at high volume.
The action cinemagraphics use quick cut scenes to enhance the urgency and the soundtrack keeps these scenes fluid. Although the asteroid/comet looks a bit contrived, that's okay. It's a freakin' MOVIE!
There are tongue in cheek lines throughout, and they keep the seriousness of this film toned down just a hair.
By the way, Leonard Maltin is WAY to critical. Probably saw to many Swedish films. Give him a beer, and he'll love this. I guarantee it. And I am never wrong.",994464000,,2982,4.575700934579439
1003896,1,6305169187,"What a waste.  Those were the words that echoed thru my mind as the movie ended.  What a waste of an outstanding Trevor Rabin soundtrack.  What a waste of the considerable talents of Jerry Bruckenheimer and Michael Bay.  Not to mention an all-star cast that includes Bruce Willis, Ben Affleck, Steve Buscemi and Liv Tyler.
The fatal flaw of this movie is that it can't seem to make up its mind what it wants to be.  NASA locates an asteroid the size of Texas heading straight for the Earth, and everyone seems to think it hilarious.  After the laughter settles down, NASA hires a bunch of oil-rig drillers to go up and take out the asteroid.
So, what we end up with is a movie full of slapstick comedy, combined with good special effects.  However, every once in awhile a sentimental, tender moment is stuck in.  Can you imagine someone trying to integrate a serious, emotional moment into a movie like ""Airplane!""?  No?  Well, that's what they did with this movie.  The result is nothing less than absurd.  And I won't even ask why NASA deemed it necessary to take gatling gun  into space with them.
Don't get me wrong:  I'm all for fun movies.  ""Con Air"" and ""Gone In 60 Seconds"" are two of my favorite movies as far as pure entertainment goes.  It's just that there is something about the threat of an asteroid hitting the Earth and making the human race going the way of the dinosaur which seems incompatible with a slapstick comedy.

The ""action sequences"" were so loud and out of proportion with the rest of the movie, I had to cover my ears.  I wish I could have covered my eyes at the same time.
The plot is absolutely worthless and there is no point getting into it.  I saw ""Deep Impact,"" and even though the basic concept is just about the same I found that movie immeasurably more entertaining.  And ""Deep Impact"" was NOT that good.
The characters and the development are SO RAZOR THIN and formulaic that I actually waited until the end of the movie, hoping and praying that the asteroid would hit the Earth and kill them all.  Let's see... Steve Buschimi (one of my favorite actors) as a platform driller, even though he has, what? two (2) PhDs or something like that???  Ben Affleck is overrated because he's good looking.

I swear, Michael Bay's answer to any action sequence is the desperate last-second escape, and this one-trick pony strings scenes using this tired device one right after the other over and over ad nauseum. How many numeric  apocolyptic countdowns can you throw into one movie?
To say the action sequences are insulting to one's intelligence is a huge understatement. In one space-drilling scene (and my personal favorite), Steve Buscemi's character unwittingly fires a gatling machine gun at his comrades, which causes all sorts of wacky mayhem. Even if the government was stupid enough to issue heavy, unnecessary bulky weaponry for a drilling mission in space which required exacting precision (maybe they were afraid the Martians might attack) why wouldn't they train their people on the use of such equipment? Or at least say something like 'This is a gun. Don't touch. Very bad.' Suspension of disbelief is one thing. This movie require you to suspend your entire brain.
The love triangle is the basic Bruckheimer/Bay formula (Just check out Pearl Harbor if you have any questions. No, I haven't seen the movie ... I just know.) You know SOMEONE has to sacrifice himself during a B/B movie. We all feel bad. He died for us (sob.)  It's an emotional rollercoaster!

Armageddon on a whole is simply terrible. Everything feels artificial and forced. Let's build sympathy for Bruce. Let's feel sorry for two young people in love ... . Let's believe that NASA will send idiots into space to save the earth. All of the emotion in this film was so staged and fake, that it was hard to feel for these characters. I have to wonder about people who said they cried when watching this film. I also never felt a sense of doom like I did when watching movies like Independence Day or Deep Impact.

In the hands of someone like James Cameron this might have worked.  Cameron has a feel for the down-to-earth expertise of blue collar professionals.  Not here.  A good cast is wasted with repellant characters and dialogue no actor should be forced to spit out.  There isn't a real emotion or scene anywhere in this piece of junk.

This is the worst kind of Hollywood movie.  A tremendous amount of money and talent in the service of a trash script.  If you want to see a movie with a similar theme done with intelligence and insight, with some real emotion and characters that approximate actual human beings, and excellent special effects that actually service the story, see Deep Impact.

1003962,4,6305169187,"Armageddon
Score: 74/100
If you are making an explanation of the ingredients that an 100/100 film would need, it is best not to use Armageddon's flavours. But, if you are making an explanation of pure entertainment at it's best, then Armageddon is a great example to use. This film opened up to the world as a major blockbuster with Razzie potential from some critics. However, some movie-goer's, like myself, happened to enjoy this film, and as a shooting star of a moneymaker, Armageddon soars high in the universe.
A giant, global-killing asteroid, like the one that killed off the dinosaurs 65 million years ago is 18 days away from hitting the Earth. NASA's been caught with their pants down and needs a new plan to stop the rock. They enlist the help of Harry Stamper (Bruce Willis), an expert deep core driller, to train their astronauts and help them drill into the asteroid and plant a nuclear bomb. But Harry figures the astronauts can't be trained in time and opts to go with his own oil drilling crew.
To get the flaws over and done with, Armageddon is sometimes too far-fetched that it becomes a little bit laughable, and Bruce Willis' character, Harry, is the hero. He isn't likeable one bit, unlike Willis' former heroic gun-aimer's and space travelling characters. But those things are quite minor, and great performances from Liv Tyler and Ben Affleck - especially Tyler, as the beautiful and Earthly young girl who sends her two most important men into sport - make up for Willis' half-effort. Also, a star-studded cast supports the three stars, including the never bad Steve Buscemi, giant Michael Clarke Duncan, the calm Owen Wilson and the weirdly watchable William Fichtner. All these actors play their roles well, and each have more faith in the story than some of the other main stars alone. Michael Bay controls his crew well, and he works excellently with the special effects team to create a stunning view of space, and some awesome blasting sounds that will unnerve you.
Armageddon is not as bad as you may of heard, and even though it isn't Best Picture material, it is still an excellent form of entertainment, a film that is able to mix romance, thrills and full-on adventure nicely and without struggle.",985996800,2,2235,4.822916666666667
1003963,3,6305169187,"The one good thing about ""Armageddon"" is not in the story, not in the special effects, but in the emotion it is able to instill through the performances of its actors. That, along, remains the only positive aspect of a film that is predictable and tedious, testing patience while stretching credulity. The story fails to do any justice for the film's intended ideas, and the special effects overpower the movie during most of its running time.
The movie begins with a pretty nice retelling of the origins of Earth, as well as the extinction of the dinosaurs. Pretty soon, we're watching a space shuttle being bombarded with small meteors in space, and this sends NASA into a frenzy to figure out the nature of the accident. There troubles escalate when an intense meteor shower rains fire down on New York City (what other city, right?). This is one of those sequences simply put into the movie to try and instill fear and tension, but this is ruined by the writer's placement of small comical relief in the form of a taxi driver who has a way with words. The movie is full of trying to make tense situations funny, putting into under an identity crisis of sorts.
The movie then takes us to an oil rig, where Harry Stamper spends his days hitting golf balls at environmental protestors and yelling at his daughter Grace, who has been the adult of the pair all her life while her father plays the small child. NASA sends a chopper to pick the two of them up, and the situation is explained to them as well as the audience: an asteroid the size of Texas is heading for Earth, and will hit in 18 days unless they can send a crew of (wouldn't you know it?) drillers to the rock's surface to impregnate it with a nuclear warhead so that it will blow up and cause a brilliant light show for everyone on Earth that's waiting in suspense.
That last sentence pretty much describes the movie, which gives us a story they think we want to see, when in fact, there is so much more I wanted to see. For instance, we are never given a chance to care that Earth is going to be destroyed because, besides the characters being placed on the asteroid, we never get a chance to know anyone on Earth to give it a human feel (unless you count Dan Truman, the NASA guy who keeps pouring on the foreshadowing of doom and death). Interspersed through the movie are small shots of people listening to their radios and pointing to the sky as eventful things happen. This really does nothing to add human drama to the movie's plot, and by the end, you'll wish the rock would just end everything and get it over with.
The movie also does not live up to the ideas it so badly wants to embody. The movie brinks on giving us a story of perseverance and courage, but instead is ruined by substituting these traits for predictable scenes and far-fetched plot elements that ruin the entire experience with a cry of ""Oh, come on."" First movie magic plot twist off the assembly line is the movie's placement of the rig workers into an twelve-day astronaut training program for their venture into space. Twelve days? There is no way, especially since most of the time is spent going through useless psychiatric tests and medical exams, which are humorous but unaffecting in terms of plot development. The movie also has so many situations in which things are about to go wrong, but right at the last minute, our heroes save the day. The missile quarrel on the asteroid is a prime example; NASA overrides the system and starts the countdown from Earth's remote control link to the bomb, and with just seconds left on the timer, our heroes find the right wire and cut it to stop the explosion, which allows for more running time more than story. This is not only totally predictable, but totally unbelievable in reality, making the movie mindless and an insult to its own ""intelligence.""
Special effects seem to dominate most of the picture, and while they are dazzling, they do nothing in terms of what the movie wants to portray. ""Armageddon"" is about a big asteroid, so why not show us a big asteroid? The only times we ever get to see it is through the windows of a space shuttle or while they are drilling on its surface, and rarely do we get a faraway shot of it in its entire. So why, exactly, are we supposed to believe that this is going to mean the end of Earth? The effects do a good job of creating some tension, but only to a certain point, and that's if the plot's hokey machinations are absent for a few minutes.
One redeeming feature of this film is the emotion that it contains, and believe it or not, there actually is some. The drillers are shown as having lives outside of their work: one has a small boy who lives with his mother, while the plot also goes into a bit of romance between Grace and AJ, one of the drillers. This gives the movie a chance to exercise more of its father-daughter angle, which it does to a point without ever becoming preachy or tedious. The group's journey into space also is aided by the performances, playing out all the situations nicely and with ease, giving the story a feel-good attitude while adding some tension.
The cast is comprised of many well-knowns, all of whom shine in their unique roles. Bruce Willis is the ideal choice for Harry Stamper, being able to balance his rough and tough macho-isms with an equal amount of emotion and feeling. Liv Tyler plays Grace, his daughter, and their onscreen time together is believable and affectingly acted. I enjoyed watching these two at work the most, for they are able to make us feel for them as they experience their perils. Ben Affleck plays AJ, and while his role is not Oscar-worthy, he still does a good job of interacting with the story and the other actors' roles. The group of drillers includes Owen Wilson, Steve Buscemi, Will Patton, and others, all of whom bring slight touches of comedy to the movie while adding energy and feeling to the plot.
You have to give producers Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay credit for knowing just what audiences want in their summer movies, and that is lots of action harnessed by clichs and predictability, so as not to take away too much focus from the special effects and sequences of intensity. For me, this just wasn't enough. I did, however, feel that the movie has a solid emotional aspect that was brought into play by the performances of the actors. The movie does make one cry, yes, but in the end, it has its flaws that keep it from realizing its full potential.",985219200,,6487,4.517006802721088

This movie reminded me of ""Deep Impact"" and ""Independence Day"".  I mean, they even called one of the shuttles Independence didn't they?  However, I have to say that I truly enjoyed this movie.  I even might have cried at the end a little (so sue me).  I won't go into specifics of the movie, because, really, all you need to know is, a meteor is crashing to Earth, and will or won't they save it.  Of course, it's predictable, how else could it be?
I liked the fact that the movie didn't completely bore you right from the beginning.  It started our fast and remained fast.  Usually.  At times it was slow.  It is, after all, a long movie.  I don't know that I could have sat through it in the movie theater, but that's what is great about renting in your home.  I liked the interaction between the characters, and I enjoyed Bruce Willis' performance, as well as Ben Affleck.  Predictable as well, but I didn't go in expecting an Oscar worthy film.
Overall, I enjoyed the movie and I would see it again.  However, I think that $25 is a little steep for a DVD, particularly this one.  Because I had a rented version of the movie, it didn't have any extras except the trailer and Aerosmith video (*yawn*).

Three stars for ""Armageddon"".  We both enjoyed this movie for it's entertainment value.  (Frankly, I'm wishing I'd seen it on the ""Big Screen"".)  Allowing for questionable science (this is Hollywood, after all, not MIT) we both felt that the first half of the movie was well-developed.
We were more disappointed with the second half of the picture.  What scientific credibility still remained, was stretched to the breaking point and beyond.  (For an asteroid with no atmosphere, that was one seriously strong wind!)  Also, too many disasters happened to too many people for the survival of any to be believable.
However, the special effects were outstanding!  No complaints at all there.  The relationships were developed in a reasonable fashion, and the scenes of prayer from various countries, cultures, and religions around the world was a nice touch.

They seemingly enjoyed it, but for some reason, I was left feeling like something wasn't quite right with this film. After discussing it with soe people, I came to the realization that I was overwhelmed by visuals and none of the plot had come through.  There is literally none of the good plotpoints that I appreciate in films, just characters trying to smart off to the camera and more.  There are basically sure signs all over this film (aside from all those billboard ads and newspaper articles that summer):
1)Overture narration to destruction, by Charlton Heston (He was Moses & President of the NRA.  And he seems to be the king of religously overtoned narration).
2)Small meteor destruction in: NEW YORK CITY?!!  Whenever anything wants to be destroyed, we go straight to New York. Why? simple, big buildings to crush, more people to annihilate to make your sympathy meter rise, and the basic fact that a meteor in the middle of the state of Iowa might be realistic, but who'd watch it?
3)The oil drilling lot: yep, those guys who drive tough ford trucks and chevys.  These guys who don't take crap, work long hours, and look good in suspenders.  The everyman,who doesn't take crap from anyone: and they are going to save the world.
4)The hardware to prepare for a meteor the size of Texas: yep, NASA has had these super-heavy duty rockets sitting around for years, as well as this 6 wheeled space rover.  Another prime example of how did this get here?  That's the American tax dollars at work: covering up the truth til the time comes.
5)love scenario: boy loves girl, girl has dad, dad is boy's boss, dad does not like boy fooling around with girl, dad tries hates boy, but boy wants dads respect.  The plot is so corny (as well as the ""animal cracker discovery channel"" segment) that I did not find anything romantic about it.
6)Possibility of mission failure, we can detonate a nuclear warhead and kill everyone up there, saving ourselves, but they can turn it off, but wew turn it on and we have a man up there trying to keep it on, but he may have doubts about seeing his little girl again and so we have to work togehter with about 10 seconds left on the clock to save our hides(whew!).Now that was just corny!
Well, that should be enough, but it seems only natural that the American public would flock to this movie making it the hit of 1998 (the only other time I've seen a worse flocking to a film was for MI:2).  Now, with ""Pearl Harbor"" coming this summer, will Jerry Bruckheimer and Michael Bay stick to their ""American as apple pie"" style of movie making?

Ben Afleck, fresh from the set of Good Will Hunting, gives a great performance as the man who is in love with Liv Tyler's character, Willis's daughter. My favorite actor in this though is Steve Buschemi, who is hilarious as one of the oil drillers. He has some of the best lines in this movie.

Oh yes, our American, down to earth boys are going to save the world, who else? The wipeout of a city like Paris is only good for a nice FX and that it might be useful to get help from the rest of the world never occurs to the NASA scientists. Well, if you've seen ""Deep Impact"" you know the drift.
Then let's talk about physics - the way it is treated in this movie would make Mr. Newton spin in his grave. Gravity on an asteroid the size of Texas? And apparently just as much as on earth, the way the protagonists moved? Well, to get that going the asteroid would have to have the weight of Earth on as much room as Texas has. The density would be so high that no matter if you used a 10000 watt drill or a toothpick to dig a hole the result would be the same.  But somehow the gravity also seemed to fade out on story-line convenience, when one of the landing vehicles is able to drift over a wide valley on the asteroid by a little thrust of its boosters. We are not even talking about ""why"" these vehicles were armed with heavy guns.
Now about the actors: Liv Tyler is a fine young woman, although not a fine young actress. Bruce Willis as her father is like Arnold Schwarzenegger as Ghandi. Overall the entire cast seemed to not really know what they actually should be portraying, so the fault might not be on the actors, but on the bad storyline.
If this movie would not pretend that it has to be taken serious, you could actually enjoy it - as a movie rental for a boring Saturday night. But if you are into patriotism go for it, anyway.",978134400,7,1730,4.148809523809524

1004036,2,6305169187,"Jerry Bruckheimer's Armageddon is a lavishly and expertly produced space epic full of great effects and big stars.  It's just too bad they didn't work on the story.
Armageddon begins with a destructive metor shower over New York city.  This catastrophe signals the arrival of a doomsday meteor the size of Texas which will crash into the earth in two weeks.  In an attempt to destroy the meteor, NASA officials enlist a rag tag group of deep core drillers led by Harry Tasker played by Bruce Willis in a very smirky performance.
The first hour of the film is Harry assembling his crew.  These scenes are the most entertaining in the film as we meet the various characters in their wild surroundings.  Director Michael Bay does a fair job of giving each supporting character a certain cinematic flair, and non more evident than in the Steve Buscemi's character of Rockhound.  This segment of the film performs much like a comedy as we the audience view the heroes go through a grueling NASA training course.  There are genuine laughs here as these scenes are editing together like a music video.
Where the film slows down is in it's romantic subplot and the entire second half.  Ben Affleck and Liv Tyler are the young heroes of the film who fall in love against the approval of Harry Tasker (Bruce Willis) who is the father of Tyler's character.  Affleck and Tyler are Armageddon's answer to Jack Dawson and Rose.  Their romance is so unimportant to the main thrust of the film that it slows the story down.  The film would be nearly an hour shorter if this subplot was dropped.
Another problem are the unsatifying space sequences.  I don't believe that Bruckheimer or Bay have an affinity for space action.  Space has a certain elgance in movies and in the right films (ie, Star Wars, Star Trek, 2010, Apollo 13) space action can be very effective.  In Armageddon, the effects shots are too fast, the editing is too music video choppy, (we have Bay to thank for that), and the asteroid itself is completely wrong in terms of art direction and design.  This asteroid looks like V'ger from the first Star Trek movie.
The film has some saving graces, the humor and acting are fine and the theme song from Aerosmith is very good.  But the testosterone level mutes any nobility that these characters should be presented in.  These guys are saving the world, and Michael Bay gives them scenes and attitudes which would be more appropriate in a beer commercial.
The Criterion DVD is somewhat satisfying with a commentary and some special features.  The commentary sheds some light as to why this film wasn't as good as it should have been as Michael Bay and Bruckheimer arrogantly discuss what makes a great science fiction film and harshly critize the other asteriod movie ""Deep Impact"" which I suprisingly found to be superior to this film.",974592000,12,2836,4.729674796747967

This is like watching Superman and nag because he can fly or because he wears red underwear over his thighs. That this is not entertaining? Come on, this is way much better than the pathetic Deep Impact, which tries to be profound (everybody crying, everybody saying goodbyes) and ends up being stupidly pretentious.

The commentary includes interesting details, including background information on the characters and filming locations.  Note:  The commentary is raw and sometimes laced with profanity, although the movie itself is rated PG-13, for reasons explained in the commentary.
Although it's not much, this collection is also a Director's Cut and has a couple scenes added, notable of which is Harry Stamper's character visiting his father before launch.  Some other scenes are cut slightly differently, adding some depth to the story.
The Gag reel on the second disk is extremely funny, raw, and not your typical ""behind-the-scenes"" documentary.
The second disk also features a tremendous amount of information on the special effects and includes many different trailers and promo material.  The Aerosmith song video is also included.

Only one person has identified the meteor, and although the world gets alerted to it (you'll see why) they coudln't know until it was too late.  Second of all, the NASA guys perform the tests on the drillers because they don't want to use the drillers, Thorton (Truman) pushes them to use Bruce's team.

The NASA guys seem to think nobody knows  about the crisis, even after New York City is decimated by an asteroid  shower.  NASA also wastes time doing psychological tests on the driller  guys, even though they're the only people who can do the job and there's  barely enough time to train them as astronauts.

While this will doubtless raise the rancor of  lots of so-called sci-fi fans, this movie really stunk!  Am I ever glad  that I saved my theater ticket $ and waited for this show to come out in  the video stores.
The story line was completely unbelievable...give me  a break, NASA, which has a huge cadre of excellent engineers can't come up  with a better plan than a hard-living, hard-hat oil man who has no problem  with running around his own off-shore rig shooting a shotgun at his best  worker!  Then, NASA gives up control of its resources to him, not to  mention one of its flights, to allow completely untrained oil workers to go  into space!  I won't even mention the extremely dark side of the whole  film.
This whole movie was about two things and two things only: special  effects and making money.  Oh, there's nothing wrong with making money, but  if you're going to spend some to make some, why not spend it to get top  notch special effects that show things that have a chance of being  scientifically and technologically possible, and that don't slam the  intelligence of the audience.
The acting was barely passable (and I kind  of like some of Willis' other shows) and the premis was awful, but the  worst thing about the film was that it required absolutely nothing of the  audience than that they hand over their cash and let their minds go  blank.
By contrast ""Deep Impact"" which also came out in 1998  was, in my opinion, a far superior piece of sci-fi than Armageddon.  It had  character development, more believable on-earth developments, and while the  off-earth action was still a major stretch, the FX wasn't the tail that  wagged the dog...there was better acting, better story line, and more real  emotion involved.
So, why did I give Armageddon 2 stars?  The reason I  gave ""Armageddon"" two stars was that some of the special effects  were pretty cool to watch, but that's it.  Sorry.
I'm sorry that not  every film, CD, or book is worth 5 stars.  You may not agree with my view  on this film, but that's one of the beauties of the Amazon.com customer  review forum -- to share ideas and thoughts.

Even after watching both discs  (the film disc + the supplement disc), I still cannot understand why  Criterion would pick this particular film out of the thousands of classic  movies that are available worldwide and which are infinitely better than  this drivel.  I will admit that the movie does have some suspense and the  special effects are fantastic.  But the movie is bogged down by glaring  script errors, predictable plot, unnecessary vulgarity, and some downright  terrible acting (and in Liv Tyler's case, complete lack of acting talent).  The added footage doesn't help...it just makes the whole miserable thing  longer!  The commentary tracks are interesting, but not spectacular or  particularly eye-opening.  The booklet that is enclosed with the DVD  contains an essay by Jeanine Basinger, director Michael Bay's former Film  Studies Professor at Wesleyan Univerasity.  How she gushes on about the  film is a definite sign that she probably hasn't seen the movie herself and  that she must have been paid a hefty sum for writing that saccharine.  As  far as the Criterion ""extras"" are concerned, you shouldn't really  bother unless you're an ardent film buff whose life is dedicated to movies  in every way or a Criterion series collector.  The material is very good  and interesting (with a couple of exceptions), but once you've seen it,  it's enough.  The famous gag reel earns its name well: not only is it  unfunny, but it's outrageously vulgar (I'm no prude, but must one be so  filthy so much of the time?!), and reinforces the fact that many of today's  movie ""stars"" don't know the meaning of the word.  One look at  the compilation of deleted scenes and you'll clearly know why they were  deleted.  The segments on visual effects, storyboards, and production  design are excellent and definitely up to usual first-rate Criterion  standards.  Movie theater trailers and TV ads are included, and they're an  interesting diversion but nothing more.  The Aerosmith music video ""I  Don't Want To Miss A Thing"" is included, and is definitely better  heard than seen.  In summary, if you *must* have Armageddon on DVD, I'd  suggest the standard edition:  it's shorter (you can thank me later) and it  costs a lot less.

The picture and sound  quality of this DVD are awesome!
Now the movie itself is an eye-popping  but still character-driven fun ride that'll have you laughing, screaming  and crying. When the world is threatened by a asteroid the size of Texas,  NASA comes up with a plan to send a team of oil drillers, led by Harry  Stamper(Bruce Willis), into space to blow it up from the inside by drilling  a hole and detonate a nuclear bomb in it before the asteroid hits earth.  Now this team isn't prepared to travel through space but it sure as hell is  prepared for drilling.

The cast: Bruce Willis is pretty  much the coolest  guy in the universe. Who else is gonna  save the world?  Ben Affleck... well he's good lookin'  and a fine actor.  There's Billy Bob Thornton who is one  hell of a charismatic guy.  Liv Tyler, Michael Clarke Duncan, Owen  Wilson and Will Patton....  Steve Buscemi: The perfect  freak.. what  can I say.... The music:Trevor Rabin has written an  emotional  theme, that will never get out of your  ears  and I guess I don't have to mention  Diane Warren's ""I don't  want to miss a  thing"", performed by Aerosmith. Director:  Michael Bay (The Rock, Bad Boys)and  his collaboration with Jerry  Bruckheimer  is unique in many ways. He tells the  story  with so much energy and those  brilliant images. There are so many  colour tones in this movie, that enrich  the emotions  and there's an irony to all  the patriotism but still you want to  stand up and sing the U.S. National  Hymn.

Yes, both movies have outstanding video and the digital 5.1 is used a  lot in this movie.  But that's where the comparisons end because the  regular version of the DVD has no extras.  The Criterion Collection version  is loaded with extras.  I mean fully loaded and each segment in the special  features are quite long.  One of my favorites happens to be the gag reel.

If you want this deluxe version, you love the movie.  So, you want to know, is the extra  expense worth it? I've just got five words for you: Yes, Yes, Yes, Yes,  Yes!  This two disk edition provides hours of behind the camera information  and insight. The first commentary track is with the director, producer and  stars of the movie.  The director, Michael Bay, passes on interesting  information on the making and origins of the film.  I did find his  personality to be somewhat abrasive and harsh. I guess some directors are  like that.  Bruce Willis seems to be very low key and Ben Affleck is a  riot.  All in all, a very interesting track.  The second track is with the  director of photography and various science consultants.  I found this  track very enjoyable.  The information provided by the DP is technically  oriented and provides great insight into the art of cinematography.  The  scientific commentaty is also very interesting. To my surprise, many of the  things that happen in Armegeddon(for example, the dual shuttle launch)are  within the realm of possibility.  Disk number two is packed with goodies.  There is a blooper reel that is so so.  I think it is funnier for people  who were involed in the production of the movie.  I thought it was OK.  There are tons of conceptual art and matierial on the SPFX and design of  the movie.  This disk will keep a fan busy for hours on end.  The transfer  for the set is razor sharp and the sound is spectacular.  Unfortunatly, I  do not have a home theater hook up.

Given enough money, Hollywood producers tend to believe that big bucks equals big movie  equals big payoff - wrong, in too many counts to recall. The thing is, Armageddon  is definetely, not a bad movie. Is stretches plausible fiction to the edge,  rips it apart, chews on it for a while and then spits it out matter-of-fact  way, everybody-will-believe-this style. It's not deep as the rather  underrated Deep Impact, which belies a story, a purpose and 3  dimensionality to the plot - for once, America stands defeated - other than  Mars Attacks! it's largely unprecedented in box office blockbusters! Back  to the movie, it's wonderfully scripted, tightly following the best  Hollywood has to offer, the soundtrack is rather excellent and image  quality, specially in this DVD outing is superb. Bruce Willis plays  himself, as usual, the quiet, sarcastic, my-way-or-the-highway type, and  pulls it off with the usual savvy. Will Patton is underused but still  manages to impress by his serenity, Buscemi goes bonkers (again) Liv Tyler  goes for the attitude-child approach and nearly falls flat in  her(admittedly pretty) face, Ben Affleck is the I'm-so-cute-you'll-puke  rebel, vaguely remembering his lines, but pulling his act together in the  last 15 minutes. It's not Capra, Hudson, DeMille or Spielberg, it's not  Cameron or Tarentino (or Rodriguez, for that matter), but it is a splendid  way to spend a couple of hours, surrounded by Dolby Digital sound, facing a  50 inch screen, with some popcorns and some lovely company. It's what  movies should be (chewing gum), and not films (food for the brain). Enjoy,  live the moments, cherrish the feelings and sensory overload, forget the  inconsistences and plot-nots, then go on living.

The scene where Affleck sings to Tyler is almost too  painful to watch.  There are some talented actors here which enticed me to  see it, so it was disheartening to watch them phone in their performances  for a paycheck.

I would have had two Russian cosmonauts on  MIR, and one of them sneaks onto one of the shuttles, but that's just me.

It knows it's  corny, it knows it's crazily larger than life, it knows it's out to push  all those staple movie buttons, and so it does it all with a terrific sense  of humour and, more importantly, on a scale that simply beggars belief but  which - crucially - works fantastically. Contrary to what some people say,  director Michael Bay does a simply tremendous job of making the whole,  massive juggernaut of a movie bolt along at a terrific pace, and even more  remarkably, manages to engage your emotions even while you're laughing your  head off at all the hokum. Other people complain about the characters, but  I struggle to recall a movie that crammed so many memorable - if  unbelievable - people into a single movie. Basically this film is pure  cinema. Sure, it's not an Ingmar Bergman film, but it never wants to be it.

  1. The part about our object-tracking budget allowing us to track only 1% of the sky is pretty accurate. There's little  chance we's see such an object comming.  2. As stated in the movie, an  explosion from the outside would not be effective in diverting the  trajectory of an asteroid of this size. Too much energy would be lost into  space.
  3. In response to another reviewer's comment about using a nuke  on something ""as big as texas"", a single modern nuclear device  could have the capacity to level every square inch of texas.
  4.  Although I doubt anyone would send oil drillers to plant a nuclear device  on the asteriod, drilling is a sensible option. A subsurface explosion,  even if it was only drilled in a bit, would be far more effective than,  say, a missile srtiking it.

It doesn't come off as  a father who has always been unable to tell his daughter how much he loves  her saying goodbye before saving humanity.  It comes off as a jerk actor  reciting lines, while thinking about his twenty-million paycheck and how  he's making the audience cry.",924739200,4,849,4.687074829931973

1004856,5,6305169187,"Why do I give this movie 5 stars you may be thinking?  Well, I personally believe that this film deserves 4 stars but others have given it one star which I definitely feel this film does not deserve bringing its average  down to 3.5 (half a mark below what I want it to be).  Sure this movie  lacked some acting (Liv Tyler for ex.).  They could have picked any actress  over her, but then they may have not gotten the awesome soundtrack from  Aerosmith.  What matters to me when watching a movie is that I enjoy it.  This must be one of the most exciting films I have ever seen.  Deep Impact  leaned more towards the characters than effects but seemed a bit long  overall.  This 151 minute film seems to go by in less than 2 hours which is  a very good thing.  The ending kinda touched me to (which surprised me).  I  DO NOT KNOW WHY!  Overall, I feel this film had lots of class and is the  best DVD out there due to the 2 DVD set.  It's amazing to have over 5 hours  of features (over 7 1/2 hours with the movie).  Since it just came in  yesterday I obviously have not seen everything yet, but I am very pleased  with what I have seen so far.  Oh yeah, I think you will be surprised how  many trailers there are!  With the teaser there must be like 30 on there!!!  It shocked me!  Shows how much time and money they spent on advertising.  I agree with some critics whom say this movie is like a roller coaster  ride.  I suggest that you either buy the Criterion Collection or go to a  friend's house and watch it for yourself.  The quality is amazing!  (not as  good as A Bug's Life but the second best I have seen so far on DVD) One  more thing, see The Rock!!!  Bad Boys, another film by the duo (and Don  Simpson) is worth seeing too.  Actually, see all the movies produced by Don  Simpson and Jerry Bruckheimer!

Unfortunately, this movie FAILS to evoke the meaningful  thinking and emotional impact of ""Deep Impact"".
Next, there are  a number of TECHNICAL ERRORS associated with the movie:
  1) Liquid  oxygen (LOX) IS NOT ""rocket fuel"" by itself - it's only an OXYGEN  SOURCE for REGULAR FUEL like gasoline, kerosene, liquid hydrogen, etc.
  2) Unlike water, LOX IS NON-CONDUCTIVE! therefore, if any were to leak on a  live electrical circuit, NO ""SPARKING"" WOULD OCCUR!
  3) At the  speeds suggested by the movie for the ""quick"" moon trip, the  shuttles WOULD NOT have enough fuel to maintain a constant thrust profile,  much less have enough to circle the moon, ""chase down"" the  asteroid, land, then take-off again (assuming they survived the  landing).
  4) An asteroid ""only"" 97 miles across would have  NEAR-ZERO gravitational attraction.  Even using a ""thruster  augmentation"" suit as portrayed in the movie, ""a wrong step""  will still send the occupant flying into space.
  5) The ""Evel  Knievel"" armadillo sequence was LUDICROUS! there's no way it would've  survived even a ""minor"" impact with the asteroid projections,  much less ""sailed away"" over the chasm like it did.
There are  other glaring scientific errors in this movie.  Unfortunately, the writers,  directors, etc. preferred ""flash and glitz"" over any sense of  accuracy or believability.
Therefore, if all you want is a ""special  effects extravaganza"" movie with a loud soundtrack, this is the movie  for you.",921974400,2,1671,5.1773584905660375

The different camera  angles, slow motion, and panning shots were spectacular.  The same was true  for Michael Bay's next movie ""The Rock.""  Which brings me to my  review of Armageddon.  The movie was your typical summer action movie.  BIG, LOUD, and FULL OF SPECIAL EFFECTS.  I didn't expect much going in, but  I did look forward to Michael Bay's choice of camera angles and slow  motion.  Michael Bay is the kind of director that gets me to see his movie,  even when I'm not interested in the story at all.  I rank him up with the  likes of John Woo and Brian De Palma.  Back to the movie though, it was  predictable, fake, but most importantly...FUN!  I think everybody needs  about two hours to just sit back and be entertained.

Anyone concerned about Buena Vista's poor DVD track record and weak support for the format (i.e. no anamorphics) can  breathe a sigh of relief.

Incredible detail, colors fully saturated, and  amazing contrast-- even on the asteroid scenes which were shot in murky  blues. The DVD version will be 20% sharper and more detailed (though I'm  wondering how that could be possible, this picture was amazing and  indistinguishable from even my best DVD's). The 5.1 Dolby Digital track,  which is certainly to be the same one used on the DVD, tops even FACE/OFF  in its brilliant, inspired use of split surrounds, fiery depth, and broad  front sound stage. Take back 1/2 a star for some initial level surfing in  the center channel; the mix kept me guessing where to put that center  level, and is occasionally (and intentionally) overwhelmed by the  pyrotechnics and ongoing rock concert.

It'll make you laugh, cry, and cheer!",1525219200,,530,4.418367346938775

7886163,1,6305169187,"How in the world does this get more than 1 star? Are people really that half-brained to get anything out of such ridiculous film making? Isn't good sci-fi supposed to actually seem like it ""maybe could"" happen to tickle your imagination? I could go on for hours describing the pathetically stupid antics, effects and other crap that just completely take away from any semblance of reality, but that's just it, it would take hours, and with a couple thousand reviews already, no one is going to read it. This movie is the epitome (not like it's the one really, most Hollywood garbage fits this bill) of ridiculously stupid and unrealistic. This is a perfect example of how pathetically stupid Hollywood thinks we average nobodies are to think that anyone would be entertained by this. It's ridiculously stupid...the storyline is stupid, the acting is stupid, the writing is stupid, the ""realistic ness"" of events is especially stupid...I can't watch it past the first 75 minutes...seen it before, now I remember why I've never seen it again. Once was too many. Changed the channel to South park, far more intelligent than this!",1522108800,,1126,4.931578947368421
