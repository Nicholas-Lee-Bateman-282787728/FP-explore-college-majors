8217040,5,B000V79SNC,"Gurdas Maan play the lead role as the 18th century sufi saint'Waris Shah', who is inspired by his guru (teacher) to go to a particular place (Malkahans) and write 'Heer'(a revered love story epic).....waris shah heeding to his teacher advice goes to this place and the story moves on from there about his stay, his own flegdling love and his writings at the village Malkahans.

Without any doubt this is the best punjabi movie ever made. Wonderful and engrossing script is well supported by equally inspiring 18th century set of a punjabi village, cinematography is at its best, music is melodious and well composed, late director Manoj Punj did a remarkable job in managing his cast and as ever gurdas maan excels infront of camera.

Movie is full of verses from the original 'Heer' which are recited from time to time, these verses are in typical punjabi language and some people will not be at ease with these (especially non native speakers)

The only weak link in the movie is actress 'Juhi Chawla', she is clearly not at ease with punjabi language, 'Divya Dutta' who might actually be the lead female character (has more scenes) is at her best after veer zarra.

Movie was well received by critics and won numerous awards in both India and abroad, Gurdas Maan received the best actor award at berlin film festival, this movie was the first punjabi movie ever nominated for Oscars.

Overall, this is not a typical masala movie but infact a masterpiece of punjabi cinema that should serve as benchmark for other punjabi movies.

If you want to buy DVD go to local Indian store (preferably Punjabi), original movie retails for $10/-",1195516800,2,1635,4.800711743772242
