She is a wonderful actress and this movie shows what she is capable of. I love her ability to play any kind of Latina roles, her multilanguage skills, and her astonishing presence. This is real Penelope; and this is great Italian cinema.",1175385600,,376,5.180327868852459
2295495,5,B0009JKVTM,"Don't Move is in the same category as Lina Wertmuller's Swept Away, which is to say that it is about passion love which is anti-rational and which breaks through all the barriers and conventions of middle class respectability.

Penelope Cruz is not beautiful in this film, at least in any conventional way.  However, she magnificently portrays the passion that inspires Sergio Castellitto to leave everything for her. This lower class Italian woman who, in an operatic way, is named Italia, says to Castellitto that she will kill him if he lies to her.  The line perfectly expresses the passion love that is ignited from the beginning, and exemplifies the operatic undercurrent of the film.

The rape that occurs at the beginning, is of mythic proportions and is certain to draw the ire of American feminists.  But it is the first of a series of commands: Don't Move (from my life) which express the underlying theme of the film, that the people whom Castellitto has loved the most have moved away from him.

A flashback depicts an argument between the small boy Castellitto's mother and father and ends with the father abandoning the family for good.  The movie opens in the present when his fifteen year old daughter, by his wife, has sustained a severe head injury and might not live.  And then comes the flashback which is the story of the film: Castellitto's love of Cruz.  He is swept away by Italia.

For an instant Castellitto thinks Cruz is a prostitute and that he has done nothing more than take something that he should have paid for.  But he learns that she cleans hotel rooms for a living, which is enough to allow the birth of love.  The birth of love in Cruz takes much longer, of course, but when Castellitto tells her he loves her she allows herself to believe that he might be telling the truth.  There are several scenes of fierce erotic ecstasy that recall the rape, but they are portrayed as natural and completely mutual.

Castellitto's wife, who is played by the conventional nordic beauty Claudia Gerini, represents what is successful but decadent about Italy.  The couple live back-to-back lives and Gerini is portrayed as having a parallel successful career.  One scene shows her attending a drunken party without Castellitto.  Castellitto chides her about a certain mutual friend who might be a boyfriend.  In another scene, she tells him she doesn't want to have children and says, ""I wouldn't even know how to hold a baby,"" as if his desire to have children with her is ridiculous. Their relationship is shown to be a marriage of convenience between a beautiful woman of modest middle class origins and a successful surgeon: When she gets pregnant by accident, she expresses the hope that she won't have a girl because she might inherit his ""ugly nose.""  And the scenes which depict her family show superficial, deeply boring group of people who care more for their animals than each other and who live in a shabby middle class apartment.

It will be difficult for many Americans to believe that a successful surgeon would think of leaving a beautiful, sophisticated Northern Italian woman for a skinny, badly dressed woman whom he has raped.  It will be even harder for us materialists to forgive him.  But any American who loves Italian opera will believe it,  and will place this film in the same category as Swept Away, Cinema Paradiso and Il Postino, to name just a few Italian film masterpieces of the past.",1165881600,2,3443,4.788494077834179
2295496,4,B0009JKVTM,"While the character played by Sergio Castellitto may be misogynistic, there is no denying his love for Italia (and I don't mean the country).  Considering that there was a completely unexpected rape scene early on, I was surprised by how moving this film was. His line comparing losing a loved one to 'rivers, dogs & trees' hit me especially hard. It may be manipulative, but it is never boring.  When it was over, I was very surprised to see that the running time was over two hours.  I also gained a respect for Cruz's talents that apparently are never put to the test in her American productions.",1164499200,3,599,4.579439252336448
2295497,5,B0009JKVTM,"'Non ti muovere' ('Don't Move') requires a lot from its audience - concentration, understanding about the extremes of control versus passion, and a willingness to stay with the nonlinear method of storytelling that novelist Margaret Mazzantini and screenwriter/director/star  Sergio Castellitto have elected to use.  This may be a little film about a few people, but the exposition of the story feels epic in its proportions (over two hours in length) and in the flamboyance of its production.  In the end the demands of the film, in this viewer's mind, reward the viewer handsomely.

The time is the present, a rainy day when a fifteen year old girl experiences a motorbike accident. The victim is immediately transported to the hospital where her head is shaved and she enters neurosurgery in what seems like a futile attempt to save her life.  Coincidentally one of the prominent surgeons at the hospital is Timoteo (Sergio Castellitto) and he is informed by a staff nurse Ada (Angela Finocchiaro) that the victim is Timoteo's daughter. Devastated by watching his young child undergo surgery his mind flashes back to the time of her birth, a time when, married to a beautiful but cold woman Elsa (the beautiful and talented Claudia Gerini), he has an affair with a common woman Italia (an extraordinary performance by the gifted Penlope Cruz).  Timoteo's usual controlled model surgeon and husband had thrown reason to the wind as he became obsessed with the raw passion of a sexually dominated relationship with the tacky appearing but genuine and emotionally abused Italia.  Their relationship may have started with a rape but it develops despite the misgivings of both Timoteo and Italia into a profoundly felt love.  Italia becomes pregnant, knowing that Timoteo is married: she is willing to take any part of him she can have as her only other memory of a relationship was an abusive one when her own father raped her as a young girl.  Timoteo is conflicted: his wife Elsa becomes pregnant yet he wishes to run away with Italia.  The wise but vulnerable Italia aborts her pregnancy and opens the door for the manner in which she works out her history with Timoteo.  All of this story Timoteo confesses to his daughter Angela, lying comatose after her surgery.  And all of the elements of the story coalesce.

The performances by both Cruz and Castellitto won many awards and well deserved they are.  Cruz proves that she is one of the most gifted actresses before the cameras today and it seems a shame that her Italian and Spanish movies acknowledge her gifts while her American movies place her in rather silly roles where her natural beauty seems to be more important.

While this film is not without flaws, the power of becoming involved with the characters is sweepingly forceful.  This may not be an easy movie to watch but committing to it intellectually is most rewarding.  Grady Harp, October 06",1160179200,10,2912,4.922290388548057
2295498,5,B0009JKVTM,"""Don't Move"" is an Italian film starring Penelope Cruz ('Vanilla Sky') who is doing what other actresses (Juliette Binoche in 'Cache') have done. After scoring big as an American actress in American films, she returns to her Italian-roots to be in an Italian film. ""Don't Move"" is an interesting film, it's told out of chronological order. The movie is centered around a disaster, while the main characer flashes back. The main character, by the way, is Timoteo (played by the director Sergio Castellitto). The movie opens with a beautiful shot of rain falling, when we see a young girl being raced into a hospital after apparently having an accident. A few moments later, a nurse walks up to Timoteo (who's a doctor) and tells him that it's his daughter Angela. Flashing backwards, we see Timoteo breaking down in a small italian town and meeting Italia (Cruz). After going back to her house with her, Timoteo rapes her...It's not a vicious rape scene, it's actually pretty tame. It doesn't even really look like rape. Rest assured, this is far from Monica Bellucci in ""Irreversible."" Well, Timoteo returns to his life and proposes to his girlfriend...But eventually returns to Italia to set things right; But then he continues having an affair with her. I think the ending is kind of predictable, you know which way the romance is heading throughout the entire thing but I don't think the writers gave a damn whether you knew that or not. This movie has some beautiful scenes and beautiful dialogue, which probably wouldn't work in an American film. Director Castellitto is a gifted director that is also a wonderful actor, he really puts his heart into his performance. As for Cruz, she's great too. She gives an Oscar worthy performance but, oddly enough, she looks like crap. I don't know if they didn't let her wear makeup or just put too much on. I mean she really looks terrible in this movie. If you think Penelope Cruz is hot, don't see this movie because it might ruin your view of her. Also, if you're renting this movie merely for sex scenes (the cover strongly implies that there are some) this isn't your movie. There's several sex scenes, but there's little nudity in this film. The only nudity is shown during hospital scenes. But, if you're into foreign films that are wonderfully done and have incredible acting. Then check this movie out.

2295499,4,B0009JKVTM,"Dr. Timoteo Rossi (Sergio Castellitto) has the perfect life: a beautiful wife Elsa (the glorious Claudia Gerini), a smart daughter and a medical practice that is the envy of all his friends.

There is only one problem, though he loves his daughter, he's not really in love with Elsa because he can't get Italia (Penelope Cruz) out of his mind, thoughts and even actions. Everything reminds him of Italia and his brief but fervent affair with her.

Castellitto, who also directs here, has fashioned his film with more than a nod towards Roberto Rossellini and the Italian Neo-Realism films of the 1950's: Cruz is even made up to look like a new millennium Sophia Loren. But that is about the only similarity between the two for Cruz has a tenderness and vulnerability as Italia that Loren never had and that Cruz has never, up to this point, exhibited on the screen.

Cruz's Italia is average looking and takes nothing for granted: she is content with having only as much as Timoteo is willing to give her, as she says to him: ""I don't care if you come back once a week, once a month or once a year...just come back.""

There is a heart-breaking scene close to the end of the film between Italia and Timo that is performed only in close-ups: the camera moving back and forth between the two, which is a textbook treatise on film acting: eyes, face, eyes... that says volumes without any dialogue.

Castellitto, so good as an actor in ""Mostly Martha,"" has directed a film with a master's eye. His scene compositions are beautiful and his astute sensibilities, particularly in the scenes between Timo and Italia, mark him as a director in possession of uncommon grace and a transcendant inner fire that hopefully will stay light for many films to come.",1149638400,14,1748,4.680781758957655

2295503,5,B0009JKVTM,"It seems I have given some not so posivite reviews, but this one makes up for the rest.
In my opinion this is an incredible movie about obsession and love and the fact that
you simply cannot choose who you fall in love with. The mystery of what love is and why you fall for
someone that you could never imagine in your right mind to be with - and yet....there you go with
all the pain and confusion that you have to face. Emotion over mind, but not just pure lust, that is the good news.
In the true sense of the word it is real love that surpasses all and everything. Very touching without being sentimental.
If you can relate to ""Damage"" you will also want to see this movie -  which I appreciate more because of the characters - the acting - is it really ? - of Penelope Cruz is amazing and very moving.
The bonus and deleted scenes are really worthwile watching and make you respect Ms Cruz even more.

2295504,4,B0009JKVTM,"This movie certainly keeps you riveted to the screen.  It's two+ hours, but the time flies by.  However, we were a bit taken aback by the brutality of Sergio Castellitto's Timoteo.  Given that the movie dances back and forth between two periods 15 years apart - and occasionally back further still - we assumed at some point that we'd get some type of insight into Timoteo's roughness (or his misogyny, as others here called it).  That never comes.  Instead, the viewer is left somewhat mollified by Timoteo's gradual softening and, ultimately, true affection towards Penlope Cruz's Italia, the object of his reckless, physical ardor. Still, in the relationship's early stages Timoteo's writes ""I raped a woman"" in the beach sand for all to see, and blurts out the secrets of his aggression to a cleaning lady (apparently the least consequential person he can find).  He's clearly unhinged or at least hanging by a thread.

Rough-hewn Italia is indelibly played by Ms. Cruz.  When the film came out in 2004 she was at the tail-end of a period where she (or, more appropriately, her agents) was starring in a pile of so-so releases in the U.S.  But she burst out with her awesome performance here (she steals the film going away).  It sets the stage for&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Volver/dp/B000N3T0DW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Volver</a>&nbsp;(where she deserved an Oscar and didn't get it) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Vicky-Cristina-Barcelona/dp/B001DJ7PR8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Vicky Cristina Barcelona</a>&nbsp;(where she won the Oscar that should have gone to Rebecca Hall in the same film).  Regardless, her performance here - in Italian, no less, - is a revelation.  She's elevated herself into the upper echelon of actresses.",1251072000,,1837,5.788104089219331
2295505,5,B0009JKVTM,"Ms Cruz has done some excellent work (e.g., Captain Corelli's Mandolin), but I think this is her best. A wonderful film!

Correction: She did not return to her ""Italian roots"" to make this film; she's Spanish, and had to learn Italian for the film. Also, in this film, she's supposed to look ""awful""; it's part of the character.",1195776000,2,328,4.655172413793103
2295506,5,B0009JKVTM,"Timoteo (Sergio Castellitto, who also directed) is a surgeon whose car breaks down in a working class neighborhood of a great Italian city.  Italia (Penelope Cruz) is a denizen of this part of town who lets Timoteo use her phone.  She works as a cleaner of hotel rooms.  She is crude, a little desperate, uneducated and so passive that she more or less allows Timoteo to rape her, a rape that she experiences without emotion, as something that society perhaps has taught her to accept as her due.  Timoteo comes back a day or two later to apologize.  He says he was drunk.  He had drunk two vials of cold vodka while waiting for a mechanic to fix his car.

Italia sniffs at this privileged man who took advantage of her.  There is nothing she can do.  Her word against his.  Just move on and forget it.  But part of her is wondering if there is more to his interest than the quick gratification of lust.

He takes her again, this time though, it is clear that his passion is especially for her.  It is something about her that turns him into a sexual beast, and not just the fact that she is a woman who cannot complain.  It is interesting to note that when he returns and catches her carrying groceries home, she looks at him with some inquiry on her face, nothing more, no anger, no recriminations, no judgments.  When he apologizes and says he was drunk, she swiftly picks up her groceries and turns away.  She was looking for something deeper from him.  She wants the reason that he raped her to be NOT that he was drunk but that he was so drawn to her that he couldn't help himself.

It is during the third scene a few days later that she accepts his passion for her and finds some of her own.  And it is after this third scene as she serves him spaghetti that he realizes that he loves her.  The moment comes when he reaches for the bottle of beer on the table at the same time she reaches to pour it for him.  They accidentally tip the bottle over, spilling the beer onto the table and floor, and their hands meet.  He holds her index finger in his hand for a moment, and it is at that moment that he knows he loves her. And she sees it in his eyes.

All of this is shown in flashback as Timoteo awaits the fate of his daughter who has suffered a massive head injury from a motorcycle accident and lies in a coma in his hospital.  His meeting with Italia took place some fifteen years previously, or I should say it was a relatively brief but ultra passionate love affair that ended fifteen years in the past at the time his daughter, from the womb of his wife, Elsa (Claudia Gerini), was born.  It was his passion for Italia that spilled over into Elsa that brought about the conception.  Ironically--and this is part of the terrible tragedy of this story--Italia too becomes pregnant at nearly the same time.  What Timoteo does not realize until it is too late is the depth of feeling that Italia comes to have for him.  This is a love affair that, to quote the words of LA Times film critic Kevin Thomas, ""makes most of today's screen romances seem undernourished by comparison.""

Penelope Cruz's performance is nothing short of spectacular.  I invite the reader to view the special feature on the DVD in which she discusses her character with Castellitto.  Here we can see the incredible passion and attention to detail that Cruz brings to her performance, and also that of Castellitto, who is outstanding both as an actor and a director.  Cruz, whose first language is Spanish, must become this noble wretch of a desperate woman who must speak Italian with a street accent and behave in way that belies her great beauty and the fine finish of her own character.  It is a shame that most Americans only know Cruz from some television commercials and being Tom Cruise's ex.  Penelope Cruz is without question--and she proves it in this deeply moving performance--to be one of the finest actresses working today.

A couple of other points.  Elsa knows of course that her husband had fallen in love with someone else.  She can sense it in the new passion he brings to making love to her.  She can deduce it in his absences from her and from the change in his manner.  But she never says a word.  That is interesting.  Perhaps she knows it will pass.  And it does, but not before Timoteo performs a ""marriage ceremony"" at a hotel restaurant near the place of Italia's birth with Italia, and with the ""reheated soup"" and the wine and cheese as witnesses, and not before he fantasizes aloud with her of leaving his wife and newborn child and going to some far off place with her alone.  Only tragedy, it would appear, prevents his leaving Elsa for the love of his life.

But time does heal this wound to their marriage, as Timoteo prays that time will heal his daughter.  And the passion of yesteryear perhaps is the more glorious because, like a portrait, it does not age.  And perhaps there is some solace in knowing that the love that one finds in a wife and a life's companion is different than that found in a fiery mania of long ago, but taken in total, no less deeply felt.",1186531200,4,5085,4.413533834586466
2295507,4,B0009JKVTM,"The movie started with the daughter of a doctor being sent to a hospital for emergency surgery. Akin to people with near death experience where they saw flashbacks, he went through the same ordeal.  Then, we were introduced to Italia (Penelope Cruz), a kind-hearted Albanian who he raped in the heat of summer & under influence of alcohol. Somehow, the doctor returned to her again & again. The sex was always rough & overpowering. As it progressed, we were shown of the doctor's childhood where he was powerless over the breakup of his parent's marriage.  Despite that he's married to a beautiful and intelligent wife, it was pretty much a loveless marriage where she refused to have a child with him.  Over time, a sense of frustration & rage were built up within him & perhaps, Italia was where he could vent his resentment.  Italia never expected anything out of him & as time progressed, he started to fall for her.  Just as when he was about to leave his wife for her, a twist of event prevented that from happening.  As a result, Italia did something unthinkable that would bring this movie to its fruitful conclusion.  This is a moving movie which in the end, we would feel compassion for two main characters, who were shaped by their early life circumstances.  An engaging love story of a different kind that shall not be missed.",1184976000,2,1338,4.663829787234042

8061959,1,B0009JKVTM,"this is a shallow, heavy, dull, and pretentious soap opera calculated to make spiritually empty, corrupt, and lazy cinema viewers feel they have been morally transformed by ""high art."" it is one of the most dishonest films i've seen in quite a while. it is also -- assuming one is not part of the target audience-- astonishingly boring to watch.

people who compare this film to fellini's ""nights of cabiria"" (one of the masterworks of cinema)  should have their driving licenses revoked.

the drama-- such as it is-- is on the level of the cheapest tv serial. a girl is injured in a motorcycle accident and her father-- a surgeon-- stands outside the operating room waiting for God (and other doctors) to decide her fate.

as he does, he remembers a sordid love affair he had fifteen years ago-- precisely at the time his daughter was conceived.

the love story is with a girl who is presented as a cheap tramp. she appears to be a prostitute, and the surgeon (who is presented as living a passionless life) follows her home and rapes her. inexplicably, she falls in love with him, and we find out that, far from being a prostitute, actually she's an angelic immigrant who cleans up hotel rooms (i.e. other people's messy lives; i.e. she's a saint).

on the other hand, when she is not presented as a docile madonna who likes being raped, she does scream a lot, which while not interesting in terms of character development, i suppose was calculated to address the surgeon's (and audience's) sense of guilt, which ultimately is the main theme of the film, even though it is dramatized in the most infantile manner imaginble.

much of the film's running time is spent watching some astonishingly unpleasant sex scenes, visually favoring the physically unattractive male lead (who also happens to be the director). the directorial/narrative strategy of these scenes is quite ambiguous. we are also treated to a lengthy shot of the star/director urinating on a potted plant.

i think this was one of the longest shots in the entire film, and remain confused as to the dramatic intent except to think it was perhaps it meant to illustrate the contempt for which the protaganist views the natural world (he p****s on flowers the way he deflowers his victim herself) in any case yuck! it also must have wasted the skills of a large team of physical effects technicians.

in any case, it's another example of the dishonesty of a film which wants to be taken as a character study but in fact is esssentially an exploitation drama with an antonioni delusion. the characters, incidently are paper thin, though penelope cruz does an admirable job presenting the surface characteristics of this updated ""gelsomina/virgin/waif"" stererotype. and claudia gerini (as the rapist's wife) deserves serious praise for making the most of a criminally underwritten role. sergio castellitto-- normally a very watchable actor-- does remarkably little with his role here as the surgeon/rapist. it's as though the strain of exhibiting his sexual energies and urinary prowess had left him bereft of his usual acting skill and common sense.

but back to the extended flashback story. our angelic waif who falls in love with her surgeon/rapist now is pregnant with the surgeon's child--and does what victims are supposed to do in cheap melodramas like this: the poor girl has an unsafe abortion and develops peritonitis. the surgeon tries to save her (his medical heroics are utterly ridiculous but are intended-- i guess--to display his love for the girl). despite all the bathos, the girl dies.

however, just so the hero (and audience) can walk away with a clean conscience, in the parallel story, the hero's daughter survives. and so, like magic, you have a happy ending. morally despicable, yes. like a cheaply bought absolution for a medieval murder, it wreaks of a fundamental decadence of the soul.

i realize this story sounds like a long forgotten 19th century opera or perhaps a Bombay Musical, but this is actually the story of a 21st century movie! and this phony ""art film"" derives all of its supposed drama from prolonged and ugly sex scenes and from prolonged and ugly scenes of two young girls on their death beds.

this is the stuff of a fifties ross hunter B-movie weepie, but it is presented with with the somemnity of antonioni. (the filmmakers are seriously deluded about their intellectual qualifications). worse is the utter moral corruption of the point of view, in which the audience is encouraged to identify with the ""hero's"" state of suspense about his own daughter's fate, which is metaphorically presented as a kind of judgment about his own soul.

this is primitive absolution fantasy reasoning. the drama of the story never actually forces the surgeon to transform-- or confront himself. everything happens to him, so his pure narcissicm (and the audience's) is never disturbed. his daughter survives so he can put away the bad memory of his crime, and go on and do whatever he wants. (maybe next time he'll rape his own daughter), but surely he'll be absolved for that too).

to underline the facile and puerile point of view, the writers even give the two women signifying names: the daughter is angela -- a kind of beatific (because in coma) metaphoric replacement for his lover, whose name is Italia, which has obvious and infantile meaning for this perfect virgin/whore, who perfectly serves the purpose of her dishonest, violent, and ugly macho rapist. incidently-- and astonishingly-- a fair number of italian males seem to be able to relate to this character. the relative success of this film in italy speaks volumes about the moral, spiritual and creative condition of italian society.

i won't waste time describing the final shot of the film, which presents a grotesque symbol of the hero's casting off the shadows of the past, but suffice to say it is as cheap and vulgar and ending as one could imagine. the crass pop song that accompanies it seems to hit exactly the right note so to speak. that is to say: water finds it's own level.

in short: truly a wretched film: dishonest, ambtious, pretentious, pseudo-intellectual. i suppose if you're a lapsed catholic with vague leftist leanings and no real intellectutal or moral spine--and suffering a life long existential crisis-- it might appeal.

in the meantime, check out the films of paolo virzi-- a young italian director whose films are fun to watch and yet honest and penetrating. a true humanist in an age where solemnity too often passes for seriousness. i like ""caterina goes to the city"" and ""my name is tanino,"" films which attempt to reclaim the old traditions of italian films like the comedies of monicelli, germi, and dino risi. italian film used to be fabulous, which makes travesties like ""non ti muovere"" all the more to be denounced.",1391731200,,6822,4.912250217202432
8061960,2,B0009JKVTM,"The series of flashbacks are distracting, and the plot is ok.  If you're a Penelope Cruz fan, you'll appreciate her almost perfect Italian and great acting, but the film is a giant punch against men.  Basically, the film paints men as misogynists and all-around jerk-offs.
it gets old real quick, especially if you're a male viewer.  Too bad, I had high hopes for this one.",1366675200,,373,4.707692307692308
