8437717,1,B004PJP6R4,Remember seeing A Sensitive Passionate Man on the movie of the week on tv and always wished I could find a copy of it. So I jumped when I saw this but was very disappointed because the transfer copy was awful. Had to return it.,1406246400,3,227,4.066666666666666
8437718,5,B004PJP6R4,I love David Janssen anyway but this movie was great. It is too bad he died at such a young age. He and Angie Dickenson made a great couple in the movie.,1388707200,,153,3.8125
8437719,3,B004PJP6R4,"This was a very moving story, and I couldn't help thinking how much it paralleled David Janssen's own final years. It was rather painful to watch, but it also showed how such self-destructive behavior may be beyond the ability of people help those they love.",1360368000,7,258,4.7555555555555555
