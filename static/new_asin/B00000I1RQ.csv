1218904,5,B00000I1RQ,This video is all the funny things that can happen to and/or around  people.  But this video has a little twist; it is all the things that they  couldn't show you on tv.  A must have for your next party!  ~Mr. Noodles,961027200,,217,4.071428571428571

1218906,4,B00000I1RQ,"During some parts, my husband and I couldn't contain ourselves!  This dvd is great!  We didn't see the TV version very often, maybe that's why almost everything we saw was new.  But, about 20% of it wasn't all that funny,  though.",948931200,3,230,4.536585365853658
1218907,2,B00000I1RQ,"If you really like AMERICA'S FUNNIEST HOME VIDEOS the television show than you'll love this video.  You'll love it because it's more like a collection of old clips that we've already seen on T.V. with a clip or two of nudity.  However to be fair, the new and uncensored clips were quite funny (I found  myself laughing aloud a couple of times).  But I felt a little cheated that  I brought it.  So I would suggest renting it if you can.  If not and you  have some spare dollars than buy it for a couple of laughs.",948067200,4,513,4.216494845360825

7909455,4,B00000I1RQ,"First of all, despite what is written above this was made in 1999 and does not have Tom Bergeron in it, the host is Steve Carell. The hosting segments are on the set which John Fugelsang and Daisy Fuentes used in 1998 and 1999. For the most part it was shot like a regular show except there are no shots of the audience which I am sure is because there was no live audience, and there is no prize giveaway.
As for the clips, not only had I already seen many of them, I had indeed seen many of them uncensored. However, to be fair, I did see many of the uncensored clips in later years under the heading of ""The Naughty Files"" which, for a while, was a regular segment on the shows hosted by Tom Bergeron.
It does contain some uncensored nudity and some profanity and there are way more gross clips than usual for the TV show. But if you like the TV show and do not find the nudity, bad language, and grossness too offensive I am sure you will like this one. On the other hand, I see no reason for it to be so expensive, it is not that special either.
As far the clips which were censored on the TV show, this show starts with about three and a half minutes of nudity. At least most of these were at some point shown on TV with a black bar censoring the nudity. This includes seven clips showing women's breasts, one clip of a teenage boy seen fully nude from the front when he is surprised in the shower, and three clips showing bare male butts. This three and a half minutes also includes three clips where someone was embarrassed but the clip did not actually show a bare body part clearly. The ""Bonus Footage"" also includes some nudity, it starts with a prank using fake male genitalia, followed by nude male skiers, and later shows another woman exposing her breasts. The ""Bonus Footage"" also has a very long clip of a walrus laying on his back playing with himself, this was never on the TV show.
There are a number of clips which include profanity, however I believe there were only two clips where the profanity was of such importance to the clip that omitting it would truly hurt the clip. Most of these clips were eventually on TV with the profanity omitted.
For the most part the rest of the clips were probably not shown on TV prior to making this show because of gross or inappropriate behavior. This includes various animals humping things other than the female of their species, several groin hits, various pranks, animals and people passing gas, urinating, or defecating, plus babies throwing up or sneezing. Many of these eventually made it onto the TV show, some with black bars but many with no censoring.",1401321600,,2623,4.388090349075975
7909456,4,B00000I1RQ,The product got here in time also it was in good condition but I couldn't get it to run on my old DVD player,1291680000,,108,3.5416666666666665
7909457,4,B00000I1RQ,"Oh yes, I cannot deny that it was so much fun... and much better than that boring Bob Saget's comments!
But the DVD extras were not that much, mostly repeated or humiliating and not funny!
Still if you need a good laugh, I think you should go for this one and better watch it alone first before inviting your family :-)",987897600,5,319,4.245901639344262

But this was the funniest stuff I've ever seen, especially the the section with the cussing in it, the little kids were saying F**k  this, and There's all kinds of s**t out here.  This is hilarious.  If the  TV show was like this it would still be on today!",963187200,,349,4.149253731343284
