6120342,5,B00GWBQK28,"Finally, my favorite Bogart movie along with my favorite Edward G. Robinson movie ALL on one DVD!! The Big Sleep is Bogart's greatest film noir performance. While Maltese Falcon has the overall superior cast (how do you improve upon Sidney Greenstreet, Mary Astor and Peter Lorre?) , it is Bogart at his best in Big Sleep. And in Key Largo you have hands down E.G. Robinson's greatest film performance. How he didn't get an Oscar nomination for this ( or Sea Wolf for that matter) is beyond me. Even by today's standard of portraying cold blooded, calculating murders on film, Robinson's performance from the 1940's easily matches them in ruthlessness. Kudos to John Huston for bringing this out of Robinson in this film.",1414281600,,721,4.869918699186992
6120343,5,B00GWBQK28,Bacall and Bogart were sizzling in The Big Sleep. Their chemistry just jumps off the screen. I really loved how the director let the story unfold through they eyes of Detective Marlowe. It kept me guessing until the very end. The dialogue was witty and intelligent. The best interactions was the banter between Bacall and Bogart and then the small scene between Bogart and Dorothy Malone in Acme bookstore. This was a really good movie.,1414022400,3,436,4.826666666666667

6120378,5,B00GWBQK28,"1946s THE BIG SLEEP directed by Howard Hawks is interesting to watch and equally interesting for its complexity. Many viewers have found it easy to become lost and confused by the films surplus of dubious characters falling in and out of shadows and some just falling dead as a doornail. Visually, there is a certain allure to all this. After all this is a film noir classic.

THE BIG SLEEP is based on the Raymond Chandler novel and I am starting to get confused already. Is this another case of style over substance? Not exactly because Humphrey Bogart is Philip Marlowe and we all know by now that he is a hardboiled, hard drinking, chain smoking and tough talking private detective. I love this stuff.

Basically, Philip Marlowe gets involved in a case, after he takes on a new client General Sternwood. That turns out to be more than meets the eye and more than Marlowe bargained for. Mrs. Vivian Rutledge in the form of Lauren Bacall is General Sternwoods daughter who informs Marlowe that he father had another motive for hiring him. It all begins there. I recommend that you just enjoy this really agreeable and engrossing film noir classic. And no noir classic from Warner Brothers would be complete without a Max Steiner score. I just had to throw that bit in.

1948s KEY LARGO directed by John Huston is one of my favorite film noir classics. The element of reality and intimacy between the characters makes me return to this film time and time again. Humphrey Bogart is ex-Major Frank McCloud and he travels to Key Largo to a hotel where the family of George Temple, a friend from the Army who had served under him and was killed in the Italian campaign in WWII reside. Lauren Bacall plays George Temples widow and Temples father is the wheelchair bound Lionel Barrymore. Eventually other guests awaiting the arrival of gangster Johnny Rocco played by Edward G. Robinson take them hostage all while a hurricane approaches them.

What is important here is tension that builds and perhaps the lethargy in Humphrey Bogarts character and performance that builds in some sort of odd psychological battle that cuts to the bone and heart armed with witty dialogue. This is a great film. It is film noir, but it has a somewhat different look to it. The darkness is within its characters yearnings and needs, their faults and weaknesses. On the outside it is bright and looming as the storm approaches, but to what end. It is a time of reflection.",1414972800,5,2450,4.703962703962704
6120379,4,B00GWBQK28,"Key Largo & The Big Sleep

These are two popular movies from the late 1940's that feature Lauren Bacall (former model) and Humphrey Bogart (who played criminals or private detectives in most of his movies). These actors were also married to each other, a rare combination in show business. They follow the usual plot where something unusual happens, it is researched, a criminal is exposed, and justice is done. Just like in real life (or so they say). Read the individual reviews on each movie for more details. TBS was Raymond Chandlers first novel, it tells about the influence of the wealthy on society.

The Big Sleep (1946) tells about an investigation into the gambling debts (or blackmail?) of a young and wild wealthy heiress, and the disappearance of a trusted employee. Marlowe visits the casino and learns about other activities controlled by Eddie Mars. Marlowe visits two book stores to gather information. He finds a body and reports this to the police. At the end he makes an appointment with Eddie Mars to meet at Geigers house. Marlowe arrives first. The problem is solved with an ironic ending. [The book is better, as it usually is.]

Key Largo (1948) takes place in the Florida Keys, the islands south of Florida. They predict a hurricane so people prepare for bad weather. One hotel stays open, a deported gangster returns secretly to America. Rocco also bought counterfeit money from Cuba and will return. Frank is asked to pilot a boat. Will the good guys win? [This story echoes The Petrified Forest.]",1414540800,,1526,4.861538461538461
