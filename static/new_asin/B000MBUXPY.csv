8167693,4,B000MBUXPY,"Paul Cox is one of my very favorite filmmakers and I'm methodically working my way through as many of his productions as I can get my hands-on (which is a bit of a challenge here in the U.S.). Recently, I purchased a copy of ""My First Wife"" and, having been through a divorce and knowing the pain caused by it (as well as a cheating ex-wife), figured that this film was a must-see for me personally. I also realized that it might be a challenging film. As it turns out, I found that after I'd viewed ""My First Wife"" both of these aspects proved to be true. As with all of Cox's work, this is an excellent production with top-notch performances (John Hargreaves work in particular) that's beautifully & carefully crafted. Still, it's a harrowing ride. To watch the marriage of John & Helen suddenly end, then witness John's pain as his personal & professional life disintegrate makes for very difficult, uncomfortable viewing. Interestingly, this work is supposedly based-upon Paul Cox's personal life, yet much like his later&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Innocence/dp/B00006SFMX/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Innocence</a>, ""My First Wife"" presents a very detached, almost documentary-like view of infidelity and divorce. I suppose that such a gifted filmmaker & storyteller consciously chose to avoid presenting an extremely difficult experience in an emotional manner so as to steer-clear of melodrama, yet his morally ambiguous viewpoint left me feeling cold despite being once-again impressed by the overall production. In other words, I can't claim to like the film, but I can safely say it's another first-rate work in Cox's canon.",1364515200,,1680,5.416030534351145
