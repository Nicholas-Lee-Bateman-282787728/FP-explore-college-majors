7815289,5,6301758137,"As with every Park BasiX DVD I've seen, this does an excellent job of providing an overview of the park. My favorite aspect of this DVD is the hiking trails section, where they take the viewer along for the hike, giving you a good idea of what's in store if you decide to take the trek yourself.

Rocky Mountain National Park is one of the gems of the park system, and this DVD puts you right there, whether you're planning your first trip, or remembering a past visit.",1340582400,,469,4.329545454545454

7815291,4,6301758137,I have found all Park BasiX to be very helpful in planning trips and vacations. Sometimes for what to do--sometimes for what to avoid! It is about the basic skills so expect some repetition of trail etiquette. What's wrong with that? NOT a National GEO movie odyssey or even Ken Burns! Just good useful advice and practical trail tips. Nice way to spent some time waiting to go for a hike as time allows.,1322956800,,404,4.472972972972973
