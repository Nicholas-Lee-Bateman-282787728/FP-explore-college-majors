8384361,5,B002YPWHQE,"I put the DVD in the car'dvd player and in two weeks I realised she news her numbers. that 's was a excellent DVD. My daughet is 4 years old. My son is 2 but I didn't hear him telling is number. For both of my kids arabic is a third language after english and french.
The DVD has really good picture and nice songs.",1297555200,,315,3.8615384615384616
8384362,5,B002YPWHQE,"The DVDs and the CD are a must buy if you want your children to learn useful Arabic words in a fun way.  I have a daughter and son who both absolutely love them.  We got the Animals DVD first and they started watching it at 6 months. They were hooked. It really helped them learn the names of all the animals and subsequently the colors, shapes and numbers and many nursery rhymes in Arabic.  We can't wait for the next one to come out.",1291334400,,436,4.105882352941176
8384363,5,B002YPWHQE,"I bought all four videos in the series although he only has two presently because I've been giving them as gifts.  (He will get the one on colors for Eid next month, and then the shapes for his birthday in November).  At first he loved the animal one, because he was on a big animal kick.  The animal video is much shorter than this one, though, so if mommy's trying to cook, the number video is a better choice because it's longer than 20 minutes.  Also, because of the longer length, the first couple times he watched he lost interest before the end.  Now, he loves the whole thing, though, and often requests it bringing me the DVD case and saying ""watch.""",1282089600,2,659,4.368852459016393
8384364,4,B002YPWHQE,My daughter enjoyed this video but I don't think i like it as much as I like the last three ones they produced. Songs were fast and filming was fast. The first three ones were really very benificial and they spent good amount of effort to film them.,1276473600,,249,4.208333333333333
