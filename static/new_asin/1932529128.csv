We plan to use it in many different venues at Pacific Lutheran University,  Christ Lutheran Church in Lakewood, and through the parish Nurse program at a local high school.",1264896000,3,269,4.804347826086956

7801541,5,1932529128,"With several years of running assisted living and memory care communities and being a direct caregiver once myself, I was AMAZED at how much I learned with this video. I used it to train all of my caregivers before they started working with any of my seniors, no matter how much experience they came with. All of them said they learned something from it when they were done. Module one was great to show families during educational family nights or to allow families who were struggling with the process to take the DVD home and have a better understanding.
Teepa is great at explaining the process without too much of the medical jargon and the pictures are eye opening to say the least. This should be a requirement for all medical professionals who are working with or may work with someone who has memory loss.",1392249600,3,814,4.620689655172414
7801542,5,1932529128,"This is the most wonderful primer for how to care for someone with Alz. It's great not only for the professional caregiver, but also for family members and friends of the person with Alz. It's expensive, but worth the price. We shared it amongst all the family members and all ended up in a place of shared understanding, which is really helpful when there are many kids in the family. Teepa Snow is so good at teaching and providing examples. Don't get put off by the fact that most of the people they are working with here have moderate to severe dementia. Our Dad is in the mild range, but it was still super helpful.",1384300800,3,620,4.4

Will make a helpful training tool. There's much to be learned.",1371513600,2,119,4.95
7801544,5,1932529128,"We made this video part of our education for both our clinical staff and office staff.  The video is amazing.  Our staff who have been in the field for many, many years said that no one has ever explained Dementia to them so simply.  This is a must have for staff education for any facility, home health, hospital or hospice program.",1346371200,7,333,4.426229508196721
7801545,5,1932529128,I watched this DVD before I purchased it when a local hospice came to our caregiver support group.  The DVD addresses the wide range of Alzheimers and dementia behaviors and why their loved ones behavior is changing and how they can best communicate with them to avoid frustration.  It is a layperson's DVD and the response from our support group was very positive.  I bought the DVD as a resource for the new caregivers joining our group.,1342742400,7,439,4.675324675324675
7801546,5,1932529128,"You will not believe your eyes when you see Teepa Snow teach dementia care by literally becoming a whole range of dementia patients. Her ability to teach by giving an unbelieveably accurate portrail of every aspect of Alzheimer's Disease is uncanny.  The ideas and techniques for providing care and understanding for this population is second to none.  The ideas and techniques set forth in these DVD's are inexpensive, common sense, and loving approaches to care.  In my over 10 years in health care I have not found a better and more humanist way to care for dementia patients and residents in all stages of the disease process.  Teepa's classes are not only educational but fun and interactive.  The series is the ultimate teaching tool and every dementia facility of any type, any at home caregiver, or daycare service would be well served to use these groundbreaking DVD's to achieve the very best in dementia care.",1323216000,13,920,4.909677419354839
7801547,5,1932529128,"My grandfather is in this video. His name is Frank Timberlake. He died 8 yrs ago (3/12/03) this coming Saturday because the same assisted living/discovery unit home that he lived in was ran by an unitelligent person, that gave him a cigarette (regardless of the sheet we signed to not allow him to have cigarettes unless we were there) and she turned her back on him, he got dizzy, fell and broke his hip...I'm watching this video right now, because I miss my grandfather...",1299628800,3,474,4.654761904761905
7801548,5,1932529128,"My home healthcare agency makes caregiving videos available to its employees, and I have watched this DVD again and again, and I get something new from it every time.  How often I have wanted to purchase this DVD and give it to the families of the people with whom I work!  How often I have recommended it to them!  In clear, concise language and with memorable demonstrations the people in the DVD help the viewer to understand dementia and how it affects its victims, and then demonstrates caregiving techniques that enable the caregiver to provide better care with compassion and understanding. It is pricey, but it's also the best of its kind, hands down.",1294272000,8,659,4.7631578947368425
