2349085,5,B000A1GEUE,Paul's DVD is clearly presented with information that helps students and teachers understand the body better....That many of our challenges in yoga come from how our skeleton is put together not because of lack of effort or flexibility.  It has helped me to become a more aware teacher and taken the pressure off many of my students who couldn't understand why others had a different flexibility than they did.  It will also help  you understand the action of poses better as well.  This is a must for any yoga teacher and very helpful for the serious student.,1160611200,4,560,4.742268041237113
2349086,5,B000A1GEUE,"This is an amazing DVD, it is so easy to follow! It brings into perspective the fact that no two bodies are the same and teaches you how to work within physical boundaries as well as how to allow an individual to explore their full range of motion. There are alot of visible examples on live models and the explanations and terms are easily understood. I highly reccomend it!",1160611200,3,375,4.449275362318841
2349087,5,B000A1GEUE,"This DVD should be required viewing for all yoga instructors. Paul explains anatomy so clearly and uses real people to demonstrate concepts. This DVD does not teach you how to practice yoga, but is really geared toward the yoga teacher, who is learning to identify people's abilities and limitations. I used to find anatomy boring, but Paul made it facinating and easy to understand! A must-own!",1160611200,2,395,5.0
2349088,4,B000A1GEUE,"I agree that this DVD does gloss over a lot, and is hardly authoritative, but, it's a DVD not 14-week college course.  Given the time restraints, I think this DVD does provide a great deal of useful insight.  I think his technique of using live models of different body types really helps the viewer retain the key points he's making.  I think some of the areas are more complicated that he's got time to address -- in particular hip rotation -- but no one would watch, let alone buy, a 12-hour dvd set.  As it is, it's the best 2-hour introduction (or is it 3?) to anatomy for yoga that i've come across.  Of course any yoga teacher interested in this approach should also have the Anatomy of Hatha Yoga, a book which will take you way, way more than 2 hours to read.",1160611200,10,768,4.305555555555555
2349089,1,B000A1GEUE,"Nice try. With respects to the body and looking at it very narrow minded as well as very western science it is a nice attempt to fit something really big into a small box.

Not only is Paul's information not correct about bone on bone, it becomes a n excuse why someone might not ever become flexable. There is some truth to it but not when the depths of yoga are explored. Paul uses normal orthopedic range of motion testing to show you how tissue is restricting or bone is on bone. He even doesn't get some of the orthopedic tests correct. (radius rom test, is with a bent elbow not a straight elbow)

The video is just a recording of some of his workshops but is put together well and to the under educated it pulls the wool over your eyes very well too. If you just want to learn more anatomy from a western view, take a class at your local college. If you want to learn more about yoga read the Hatha Yoga Pradikipa or other ancient texts, build your own practice and stop going to classes. You will learn more with the private practice than anywhere else.",1148601600,39,1061,4.27363184079602
2349090,5,B000A1GEUE,"Solid, clearly presented anatomical breakdown of yoga postures, free of dogma and jargon, yet respectful of yoga (and Taoist) philosophies and the concepts of yin and yang qualities in relation to the yoga practice.

Most importantly Grilley separates limitations in range of motion into two kinds:  Muscular tension (changeable with practice) and skeletal compression...i.e. one bone meeting another and stopping motion at that point (fixed).

Key poses are performed by students with a wide range of body types and bone structure in order to demonstrate how this comes into play in postures involving pivotal joints (shoulders, neck, pelvis, spine, etc.)

Overall, Grilley's theories about working within the unique body to create a suitable personal practice present yoga (rightly) as inclusive and liberating as opposed to fixed, systematic and binding.",1132358400,33,857,5.62015503875969
2349091,5,B000A1GEUE,"Paul Grilley has given me an entirely new outlook on yoga and why someone like me (who is fairly flexible to begin with) cannot do lotus pose easily...while my husband who (along with other muscles)has the tightest hamstrings on the planet, can do it with ease.  It's all in your bones!  If you are a teacher, serious yoga practitioner, or just would like to understand why you and some of your yogi counterparts differ so dramatically in the appearance of your postures...you must own a copy of this dvd.

We have to stop beating ourselves up for not looking a certain way during our yoga practice, and start tuning into ourselves, and the sensations achieved rather than aesthetics.

Have confidence in exploring your own full range of motion, while always being aware of the 2 major limitations explored on this dvd...is it tension (muscular) or compression (skeletal).  Tuning into these sensations can make all the difference, and allow you to explore modifications, or alternate postures altogether.

Paul Grilley is a very thorough presenter, and very easy to listen to and learn from.

They say you usually retain 10-15% of what you hear in a lecture, I retained at least 90% of what I heard in Paul's demonstrations.

I highly recommend this dvd for yoga practitioners of all levels.",1127347200,56,1292,4.894495412844036
2349092,5,B000A1GEUE,"Paul Grilley has made a name (sometimes infamously) for himself in the Yoga community with this informative DVD on anatomy and Yoga.  Grilley is a proponent of ""Yin Yoga,"" an approach to practice that focuses on long, passive stretches as a way to gently mold the muscular, ligamentous, and fascial tissue into a more pliable state.  His anatomy DVD comes out of that conception of the human body, which will fascinate some and irk others.

The main component of the DVD is a lucid exploration of anatomy through two major themes: compression and tension.  Tension is something that most of us are familiar with: relative tightness or tone of a muscle.  Most yoga practices focus on ""tensile"" stretching, which seeks to lengthen and stretch the belly of the muscle to create greater flexibility.  Because of this, according to Grilley, most Yoga practitioners ignore the ""compression"" aspects of a practice.  Compression occurs when two surfaces (bones, soft tissue, body mass, etc) ""hit"" in such a way that more movement is not possible.  Compression, Grilley argues, has more of an impact in practice than we would normally think, leading to frustration as we try to go ""deeper"" into poses, thinking that the restraint is muscular.  Occasionally, Grilley says, this is really boney or structural blockages, and this is something we will not be able to get around.

The DVD journeys joint by joint through the body, with Grilley providing a number of excellent examples through audience members .  Each person demonstrates either an extraordinary amount of mobility or an equal extraordinary lack of it.  Both are fascinating, especially as the models take some classic ""problem"" poses, such as Urdhva Danurasana (Wheel), Adho Mukha Svasasana (Downward Facing Dog), and Virabhadrasana B (Warrior II).  Yoga instructors will find their jaws hanging in amazement as seemly intractable problems with students become instantaneously more clear: it's not the muscles, it's the bones!  Any yoga instructor worth their salt will watch this DVD and immediately apply its principles to the ways they approach asana practice, and such thorny areas as hands-on adjustments in particular poses.

A part that may irk some teachers is his presentation of hypermobility in certain joints (elbows and knees) as being natural, and one that should be exploited.  One can almost hear that agonized yells of exercise science graduates, for whom the idea if nearly heretical, if not downright dangerous.  However, Grilley's thoughts on the issue are sound: why shouldn't people explore, in their own practice, their range of motion, regardless if hyper or hypomobile.  I do not think that Grilley is suggesting that people should lose their ability to control these joints through muscular ability, which is the primary concern of exercise science.  Instead, he is focusing on the capacity as no more or naturally than ""average"" mobility or hypomobility.

Grilley's excellent presentation, humor, and use of real-live models demonstrating hyper- and hypomobile ranges of motion make this one of the most immediately practical tools on the market.  This is an essential part of any practicing Yogis library, and indispensable for teachers.",1125273600,129,3218,5.270588235294118
2349093,5,B000A1GEUE,"This DVD is packed full of great information on anatomy for yoga. He goes into details on how some alignment cues may not work for all bodies, and why that's so. Great info.",1474675200,,173,4.2727272727272725
2349094,5,B000A1GEUE,Awesome presentation! Any instructor needing to dive in to more anatomy should give this a go!,1474243200,,94,4.9375

2349100,3,B000A1GEUE,"This is just ok. I was expecting a lot more after all the hype about Paul Grilley. I didn't really learn anything that didn't almost seem like common sense for a yoga teacher, and some of the model demos were very extreme.",1450483200,2,222,4.309523809523809
2349101,5,B000A1GEUE,"This DVD was amazing and incredibly informative. It answered so many questions about the ""why"" in my own practice and gave me a much better outlook on how yoga is very personal to each individual body no matter how much you might practice. Paul presents the information in a manner that's obvious through use of various yoga practitioners. I was also relieved to finally hear someone say that backbends are lumbar instead of being told they're thoracic and the reasons why. Every yoga instructor should be required to either watch this DVD or take full out anatomy classes to understand what they think ""alignment"" means. Anyone practicing yoga should watch this DVD to understand where you may achieve a posture or have to alter it.",1449014400,4,733,4.872

2349103,5,B000A1GEUE,I was pleasantly surprised by how great this video is! Definitely a great source for yoga students and instructors looking to learn more about anatomy and how it relates to yoga practice.,1445126400,,187,4.875
2349104,5,B000A1GEUE,"The main point that I learned from this DVD, is that everyone has different bone joints, and that these bone joints can limit how far we will be able to stretch in certain poses (asanas). He shows various joints to prove his point.
 Therefore, it is not only the connective tissue that allows some people to do or not do certain poses. And he shows 'how to decide whether it is a bone joint or our tight connective tissue limiting a stretch (or pose)'.",1440201600,,452,4.380952380952381
2349105,4,B000A1GEUE,"SO boring but the information is so necessary to anyone! truly anyone, not just yoga teachers can seriously benefit from this film. There isn't really an exciting way to teach Anatomy and I think Paul did a great job!",1434844800,2,217,4.589743589743589
2349106,4,B000A1GEUE,This DVD is awesome. Paul Grilley transformed my view on the body. If you are looking for basic anatomy this might not be enough but it really helps yoga students and teachers understand why their poses look different and helps us appreciate our body and understand our bone structure.,1432857600,,285,4.836734693877551
2349107,5,B000A1GEUE,An essential for yoga certification aspirants as well as for the general public. Learning the limitations and strength of your own human body is a great way to learn how to care for yourself.,1432512000,,191,4.647058823529412

2349112,3,B000A1GEUE,Found the work on the bones very interesting & helpful for my practice & teaching. I was disapointed that there was not more on the muscles that move the hard structures of the body.,1422748800,3,182,4.382352941176471
2349113,5,B000A1GEUE,"I can't say enough good about this.  We watched it in our yoga teacher training and I had to buy it.  I have been practicing for several years and always thought that at some point I would just have a break through to move beyond where I thought I was stuck.  After watching this and realizing that I was probably just dealing with anatomical restrictions, I have developed a much more loving practice.

Although I have exacerbated multiple endstage osteoarthritis issues in my knees, neck and shoulder since then which TAUGHT me a lot and I am now a student in a Yoga teacher training course; I found this DVD illuminated to me what all the Required Readings on Anatomy did not!

The bottom line I received from this DVD is to LEARN and TAKE from ALL- then pick The BEST for me!

PS: Wabi-Sabi is the Japanese art of finding beauty in imperfections and celebrate the cracks, crevices and all the other marks that time leaves behind.

Paul Grilley is both knowledgeable and humorous, which kept me alert during the entire video.  I recommend not watching the entire DVD in one sitting because you will experience information overload.  I took lots of notes and reversed to watch certain sequences repeatedly to clarify information.  Definitely worth the purchase price if you plan to teach yoga.",1401062400,2,527,5.226190476190476

2349129,5,B000A1GEUE,"Two things really stuck with me from this DVD:

1. If range of motion in a pose is limited by compression, it's not going to change. I either need to find different alignment that removes the compression, or accept this is where I am at.

2. Every person's body really is unique. There are some poses I will never be able to move as deeply into as the person next to me. Our bones are different. That's just a fact of life.

Both helped me move away from comparing my practice to the other people in the yoga class. I always knew I ""shouldn't"", but this DVD explains very practical reasons why.

Paul's presentation style is humorous and engaging. He uses multiple unique people to demonstrate each point, and that makes all the difference in understanding the material.",1390089600,7,770,4.557971014492754

2349142,3,B000A1GEUE,I was expecting anatomy about muscles.  this is just him lecturing about joint movement.  also the info he presents about fascia is outdated (I do realize that the sudy of Fascia is moving at a quick pace).  I kept waiting for more info about the muscles around the joints.  The info about the mobility of joints is good...I was just expecting more.,1356566400,9,349,4.580645161290323
2349143,5,B000A1GEUE,"I am a yoga instructor who teaches anywhere from 18-20 classes a week all around town.  What Paul speaks of in this DVD is what I see in classes.  Vastly different bodies all with differing ranges of motion and for different reasons (age, injury, bone structure, muscular restriction, facial restriction).  I believe it is important as a yoga instructor to understand which of these can change and which can't and to give students safe and proper instruction on how to change what can be changed while not giving them false hope or dangerous ambitions about what can not be changed.

Also I believe it is important to recognize as Paul points out that ""it is not about how it looks but about how it feels.""  Oddly it is the teachers I know who seem the most obsessed with ""proper alignment"" to supposedly keep people safe in their classes who I hear the most complaints about people getting injuries from.  Work WITH your students not AT them.  You can only come to understand their bodies along with their help, not by trying to shove their bodies into some idea of what you were taught in teacher training.  This is a unique living human form with a history, not a piece of clay for you to mold into the perfect asana.

I wish more yoga teachers would both watch this DVD and listen to what Paul is saying.  It of course makes our job as instructors harder, and takes away the false sense of control that we have that we can somehow keep people safe by saying the right words in class.  Once we accept what Paul is telling us we no longer have an instant fix for every problem and we are facing the great unknown.  We have to start asking questions when a student has a problem and perhaps tell a student that we don't know exactly how to help them right away.  We have to allow exceptions to the ""rules"" and cues we use in class.

Its so funny how in yoga we are trying to get people to start being in touch with their bodies but then we insist on them ignoring what their body is telling them so they can look like they are doing the asana the way we think it should look.  Again, it does not mean that it can't be better, that the first expression of a pose that they come to is ideal.  You work WITH them to find the best expression of the pose that they can, but ultimately for some bodies that is going to look vastly different then what is on the cover of yoga journal.  Some very basic fundamental alignment cues are just wrong for certain individuals and put an unnecessary strain on that individuals body.

To paraphrase Paul ""there are exceptions to every rule"" and as yoga teachers it is more challenging for us to open the pandora's box that we don't have all the answers and that people should question what we are saying if it does not work for them.  The things we say to students are supposed to be helpful but we should be alert and awake enough so that we can see when an exception is staring us in the face.  Trust your students, have faith in them, let them help you help them.  There really is no other way.",1351900800,7,3031,4.319787985865724
2349144,5,B000A1GEUE,"I will start out letting the reader know that I am a very new practitioner of yoga; I've been at this for about four weeks.

I would recommend any person starting out in yoga (or any sport) should view the DVD Anatomy for Yoga with Paul Grilley.  This excellent video gave me worlds of insight into how the bones work (or don't).

It has greatly improved my approach to some of the yoga poses.  And though I have far to go before I get past tension and face compression, I am now able to practice yoga mindful of not just what the muscles and tendons are doing, but what the bones are doing.  I can now really focus on what the pose is meant to achieve and....

Well, I don't know how to explain it, but there's just something about knowing what the bones are up to that helps.  Perhaps it's that it lays to rest a bit of the mystery of what's happening to the body and thus some of that restraining fear dissapates allowing a freer yoga practice.

I suppose once I have been doing yoga awhile and am in a 'different place' I will use the tools Mr Grilley's DVD has given me in different ways, but for now it's simply comforting to know my bones a little better!

While compression/tension was a main focus, the section on proportion was eye-opening as well.  I sort of had a 'thing' about using props because I thought 'hey, if I use a crutch, I'll never improve.'  Wrong!  What a sad misunderstanding of what props are!  Now my little blocks sit right next to my mat waiting to make my short little arms a little longer so I can properly achieve triangle pose.

I almost wish this video were titled 'Bones: A DVD for people who have them.'  It seems such a shame that this DVD's title might limit it to people who practice yoga.  Everyone should watch it!",1307232000,12,1757,4.2948328267477205
2349145,5,B000A1GEUE,"I am a yoga teacher, and this dvd helped me understand the movement of the body so much more than anything I have read. It has helped me improve my teaching skills:)",1302134400,3,165,4.1875
2349146,5,B000A1GEUE,"This DVD informed my practice like nothing else. I have super short femur and humorous bones. There are some things I just cannot do in yoga that others with different proportions can easily accomplish. This information not only helped me enjoy my practice, I am safer in it. I listen to my body with much more intelligence now. Compression or tension? Proportion or practice?",1299888000,4,376,4.890625
2349147,5,B000A1GEUE,"Paul Grilley is a wonderful teacher.  He packs a world of material into his 4 hours of education time that all yogi's can benefit from, as well as PTs, dancers, and other body movement enthusiasts by skeletally explaining why bodies are so different and so why individual ability and range of motion for each of us is so unique to us...due to the nature of our bones, whether genetic or due to other reasons like injury.  It is a different kind of anatomy course than the more dry & usual ""...this is a femur, this is a pelvis"" kind of thing...b/c of how it translates to movement and a pose, but most importantly how we as teachers see the students we work with every day.  It is very absorbable & I highly recommend it.",1298160000,4,721,4.365671641791045
2349148,5,B000A1GEUE,"We watched this video in my yoga teacher training class, and afterward I had to buy a copy for myself. It was so informative, teaching the difference between compression and tension in a yoga posture. It's priceless information for a teacher especially in making adjustments. And for the student, it helps you to better understand why your expression of a pose may or may not look like the cover of Yoga Journal.",1298073600,2,412,4.736111111111111
2349149,5,B000A1GEUE,"In many of the reviews many people recommend this as a must for Yoga instructors, but it is as important, if not more important for students to see it. You are the only one that can really tell how your body works and feels. It's important that you know what it is, exactly, that you are feeling. This DVD, is a must see for anyone practicing Yoga, teacher or student. Despite the name, and length, this is not a complete anatomy, but a skeleton anatomy. At first you may wonder why you need to know about the skeletal anatomy.  The reason is, that is what ultimately restricts your movement. Tight muscles and connective tissue will stretch over time, but your skeletal structure will remain the same, and you need to work around it. If you try to push pass the restrictions of your skeletal system, you could seriously injure yourself. And that is the whole point of this DVD, to learn what is simply tension that can be worked through, and what is compression caused by the alignments in your skeletal structure.

The DVD contains almost 4 hours of lectures divided up into sections covering the various points of movement in the body, including places that you wouldn't normally think about, like the scapula.  Paul starts each section with an overview of what he is going to be covering in each section, then gets into more detailed discussion. He explains the difference between tension, and compression, and how you can tell the difference, so that you don't injure yourself, and get the most out of your Yoga practice. He show how the different joints work, using a model skeleton, and how minor changes in the bone and joints can affect the way the joints move. He then brings up people with differing skeletal structures to show the types of restrictions that you would see in the joints and how they would look in different poses. This is immensely helpful, especially for people new to Yoga. If you are just trying to look like other people doing the poses, but don't understand the difference between muscle tension, and joint compression, you could hurt yourself. What Paul stresses throughout these lectures is not to worry about looking like everyone else. You need to get a feel for your body, and if you run into skeletal restrictions, you need to learn to work around them, which he also covers.

Overall this was a very interesting and informative DVD. I actually learned a lot about some points of compression that I had been fighting against thinking that it would loosen up. I am now working around those restrictions. Paul is a very good teacher and covers the subject thoroughly, while still keeping it interesting and easy to understand. By first showing how the joints work using a skeleton, and then bringing up real people to show how differing skeletal restriction actually look in certain poses, it makes it much easier to grasp the whole picture. I highly recommend this DVD for all Yoga practitioners.",1279324800,8,2934,4.747058823529412

2349153,5,B000A1GEUE,"Time has come for this DVD. Though it was released a few years ago, it is gaining more popularity now. A no-nonsense program, it is high time someone gave the valuable message of `realistic' yoga for the average practitioner. In the West, where Yoga has become a `fashion' and even cult, more and more versatile forms are constantly `invented' to the point of absurdity. The message given by publications is `perfect' postures as displayed on some magazine covers with a young female in sexy clothing holding flawless-looking postures.

Here is a program that tells us that we are all the same in the inner levels of our being, but unique on the physical level. We are built differently, and we must do Yoga our unique way. Of course, we know that all of us are not equally flexible and cannot do all asanas perfectly, but a program like this reinforcing this idea is helpful to the student who cannot `keep up' with the next person in the class.

The presenter's background is obviously in Taoism and follows Yin Yoga. His teaching is effective and the demonstrations are excellent. All his statements may or may not be anatomically correct, but that is not the point. He deals with each and every joint in the body in a style understandable to all. He encourages everyone to do the Yoga that our bodies can accept, and be our unique selves.",1256428800,6,1342,4.658227848101266

I also liked the way that the information is organized on the DVD and extras such as the interactive skeleton. However, for me, it was not a keeper. I sold my copy on Ebay immediately after watching.

First, anatomical knowledge is benefitial for yoga practice because it explains what each pose does, what it's supposed to do, and how to prevent harm. Second, Grilley's view that everyone's different is valuable in a competitive society, where everyone wants to be the same. Accepting ourselves, our good and bad qualities, is something that yoga helps with. To be dogmatic about yoga may be contradictory. So, Grilley's words are both insightful and reassuring.

After watching this video, I realized that, while the weight-training did help, the CORE of my problem was short arms and short legs...relative to my torso!  I will ALWAYS need props (blocks) when doing yoga simply because of my body proportions.  I also realized that I will NEVER be able to do certain poses (such as headstands)...again, because of physical proportions (arm length) and lack of adequate neck extension relative to arm length.  With the information in this dvd, I was able to immediately modify my power yoga in a way (using props) that allowed me to get the maximum benefit of various poses without feeling that I was 'cheating'!  While I recommend this dvd to everyone doing yoga, I especially recommend it to individuals who have short arms/legs!  With blocks, I can now maximize the benefit I get when doing my poses!

8072016,5,B000A1GEUE,"After coveting this DVD set for some time, I finally purchased it awhile back.  As both a yoga practitioner and a teacher, Yin yoga is one of my favorite styles, and I thought that I could learn from this DVD.  It has A LOT of content, and I still need to spend time watching the lectures in greater depth, as I've mostly just skimmed so far.

The first DVD is Grilley's lectures, all 108 minutes of them.  I will have to come back to list the chapter breakdowns.  Basically, Grilley covers anatomical differences and how this impacts individual practice.  He discusses what makes yin yoga unique and how it complements more yang yoga practices.

The second DVD contains the yoga practices themselves.  These focus on yin yoga, naturally, although a few yang routines are offered as well.  I'll provide the menu listing and then describe details.

Yin Practices
*Hip Series, 70
*Spine Series, 62
*Infant Series, 63
Yang Practices
*Warrior 1:35 Play Lop
*Flying Dragon 2:38 Play Loop
*Golden Seed 1:22 Play Loop
*Custom Yang Sequences
Special Features
*Bonus Yin Practices

The heart of this DVD is the yin practices.  For each, Grilley instructs a class of four students (including his wife), each of whom displays the poses showing different modifications and levels.  Grilley states that the Hip Series focuses on the area above the knees to the lower spine, and it is designed to increase the range of motion in the lower pelvis and hips.  The Spine Series places emphasis on the pelvis, sacrum, and spine; it includes several twists.  Finally, Grilley describes the Infant Series as the ""least yin"" of the three.  There is more work for the spine in a horizontal position, including a standing warm-up.

The yang practices aren't really follow-along routines, as they feature Grilley and his wife Suzy moving through flowing postures, often facing away from the camera.  The Customized Yang option does provide a bit more in the way of actual practice choices, as here the viewer can mix and match practices to create short yang flows.

Finally, the Bonus Yin Practices opens a separate submenu.  The routines themselves are in slideshow format, with a still photo to display the pose combined with Grilley's very brief voiceover cues naming when to come in and out of the pose.  This menu is as follows:
*How to Use the Bonus Practices
Opening Practices
*Butterfly Opening Sequence - 28:40
*Dragonfly Opening Sequence - 28:25
Closing Practices
*Snail and Roots Sequence - 28:35
*Shoelace Sequence - 22:00
*Saddle Sequence - 25:02
