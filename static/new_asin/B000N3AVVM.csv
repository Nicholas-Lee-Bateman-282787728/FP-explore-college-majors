If you ever saw the TV game show ""The Dating Game,"" this is partly a corny spoof of that, with lots of T & A thrown in. For the ""game,"" this exaggeratedly nerdy guy is choosing among 4 ladies to ask out on a date. Nerd's question: ""Since I'm kind of a numbers geek, how far can you recite pie?"" Girls's answer: ""Cherry, so you can lick it off me."" Nerd's question: ""If you were an ice creme cone, what flavor would you be and why?"" Girl's answer: ""I would definitely have to say neapolitan, because I would love to promote cultural diversity."" Nerd's question: ""Which street on the Monopoly board would you most like to have whoopie?"" Girl's answer: ""Since I'm into bondage, I would want to be sent straight to jail."" And the nerd's comments are even worse than those samples, so not much humor here!

The ladies are Jaime Hammer, Lisa Daniels, Aubrey Taylor, and Nikki Kane - all of whom are very sexy. Fortunately, the boring game show just runs about 10 minutes before we get into the striptease segments that are in various settings off the game show set. These are quite well done. My favorite segment, which you get if you choose a certain girl as the winner, has all the girls writhing around in the buff on each other and on the nerdy guy, so I wish this had more of that sort of thing. Also, the soft focus is overdone to the point of blurriness on some segments, including the scene I just mentioned. Otherwise, picture quality is OK, with a 1.33:1 ratio. The whole DVD runs about an hour. The bonus stuff includes a 6-minute segment of bloopers and outtakes, a decent photo gallery, and trailers of other Peach DVDs.

So, all in all, the sexy ladies save THE PERFECT MATCH from the ashbin of history, but there are a lot better similar DVDs out there, although I don't know of any great ones with a game show theme. This at least inspires me to look for more DVDs with Jaime Hammer and Nikki Kane!",1239580800,2,2050,4.349869451697128
