7821728,5,6302142288,"This picture is dedicated to the US Army Air Corps officers, enlisted men, and ground crews. Blackie and Heathcliff are working at a carnival. There is an old attraction that uses physical comedy. The owner fires the boys, they dine out to celebrate. The boys will join an air academy for training. There are more comic skits at the lunch counter. The boys get in without a pass, but there is a price. More comic skits follow, then a song and dance. There is a comic skit on the telephone. Mr. Roberts knows his technical details. An accident makes Heathcliff tired. Later we see a carnival that provided entertainment in those days. Heathcliff enters a haunted house. The confusion over the twin sisters ends.

Jinx Roberts figures out how to make Jim Morrison fly solo! Jim walks away from his landing. Blackie and Heathcliff get into a trainer and provide the comic flight that is the highlight of this film. The ending shows single wing trainers that replaced the wood and canvas biplanes. Both radial engined. There is trouble at the end when a parachute gets caught by the tail of a DC-3. Jinx rescues the man in a daring rescue, and redeems himself. Blackie and Heathcliff have a comic ending. All's well that ends well. [This film was intended to be a recruitment aid.]",1198886400,2,1277,4.6755555555555555

  Trivia (from imdb.com): (1)This was originally planned for production after ""RIDE 'EM COWBOY"" (1942). The huge success of Abbott & Costello's previous service comedies, ""BUCK PRIVATES"" (1941), and ""IN THE NAVY"" (1941), caused Universal to produce this first. The War Department also announced a recruitment campaign called ""Keep 'Em Flying Week"" which Universal could use as a patriotic tie-in. (2)For the torpedo chase, Lou Costello did his shots in front of a rear projection screen. For the long shots it's Pat Costello, Lou's brother, doubling for him.",1125014400,2,2450,5.016129032258065
