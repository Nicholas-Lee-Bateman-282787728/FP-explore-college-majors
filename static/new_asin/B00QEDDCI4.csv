6866203,5,B00QEDDCI4,"BBC ""Life Story"" crew spent 1,900 days filming in 29 countries on six continents, generating 1,800 hours of footage. Renowned naturalist Sir David Attenborough has a remarkable treasure trove of stories following his 6-year career with the BBC. This series will bring to life some of his most memorable. This production is in the same line as the Earth collection. What a privilege to watch wild animals undisturbed in their natural environments and no one accomplishes that like the crew of BBC and the talented, dedicated and educated David Attenborough. I wish David lots of health since he is truly indispensable. No better way to watch a nature documentary other than having David as the narrator with his unique accent and personality. These are amazing stories, survival stories of different animals in the wild. Amazing work. Bravo, bravo, bravo.

8691049,5,B00QEDDCI4,For those who said it won't play. You may have bought the wrong region version. I had a similar issue with human planet and I had to return it and bought the north American version. Alternatively it is on comcast - if you have DVR and comcast- on demand you will just miss out on sound since it's only stereo,1434499200,,308,4.15

8691055,5,B00QEDDCI4,"(The title of this one may be a bit confusing: Don't mistake this with Attenbourough's more personal 'Life Stories')

So it's been two years, and the BBC produced another flagship nature documentary series. I've been watching dozens of these for 30 years now and I keep expecting to get tired of them, but I figure either I really like nature documentaries, or the BBC is just that consistently good. But then again, I've watched several that didn't grab me, and this one is definitely an exciting and interesting one. (By the way, they also produce many 'lesser' documentary series that are only available on the UK site, the best of the recent lot being 'Monkey Planet').

Thematically, this is not new, covering the challenges of life at its different stages for a wide variety of animals: First Steps, Growing Up, Home, Power, Courtship, and Parenthood, for a total of six episodes. This theme was used in 'Life' as well as 'Trials of Life'. But the content itself is mostly new, with a very dedicated team working for years to capture incredible scenes of animal behaviour never before caught on film.

Some behaviours have been covered before by the BBC, such as the fights amongst turtles underwater while the male hangs onto the female (Life in Cold Blood) or the often-used drama of turtles trying to get back from the beach into the sea after laying eggs, and the first attempts at flying by albatrosses with sharks standing by to eat every failure (Trials of Life), as well as the often-used meerkats and bower birds.

But the majority is new and there are many surprising, dramatic or funny scenes. The one that stands out is the mind-blowing scene of young barnacle geese jumping off a cliff and bouncing their way down very painfully, some not making it alive. And then there is the unbelievable, underwater 'crop-circle' made by Japanese puffer fish, the dancing male peacock spider that tries to seduce a very aggressive female that only wants to eat him, mantid kung-fu, Arctic foxes hunting by torpedoing their faces into snow, and a line of hermit crabs sorting themselves by their size while waiting to move into a new home.

It's Gunton producing this one, so you get surprising behaviour in the vein of 'Life' rather than the postcards of 'Planet Earth'. And we get the usual ten-minute diaries at the end of each episode so that we can empathize with the hard work of the team.

David Attenborough's voice is showing its age a little this time, but after thirty years of listening to him, there is nothing more soothing to my ears.

The image quality is stupendous. Obviously.",1420675200,7,2599,4.775055679287306
