8574723,5,B00BWF84NC,Gundam is great for its action but its even better when it comes to the emotions and political stories. this really is one of the highlights of the show so far and I'm looking forward to the final ep.,1383004800,,200,4.153846153846154
8574724,4,B00BWF84NC,"Vol 6 of Mobile Suit Gundam UC, probably has the fewest mobile suit action sequences of all the volumes that have come out so far, and probably less then what number 7 will have. Instead it focuses on the other great aspect of Gundam, the philosophy of why humans keep going to war with one another. Additionally we finally learn Full Frontal's plans for Laplace's Box.

So yeah...there is a lot of dialogue in this one.

However there is still a high level of tension throughout the episode, stemming from the fact that the crew of the Nahel Argama have to work with Neo Zeon in order to survive being chased by the Earth Federation ship General Revil. As you can imagine the Federation crew is not happy working with the group responsible for the death of their comrades. It does not help that the majority of the Neo Zeon group criticize and treat the Federation crew as inferiors. I won't say how it ends but by the end of the episode it is established where everyone's loyalties lay.",1367712000,4,988,4.5139664804469275
8574725,5,B00BWF84NC,"well, considering that this was originally supposed to be the final episode it disappoints me.  but the fact that they have extended it to what is rumored to be a movie length episode, who knows, this episode has served as a great set up for the series conclusion.  with some more character development and revelations abound and a retarded epic cliffhanger ending this was most definitely a fantastic episode as was the whole series to date.  and with the extension of the series we get to see more of the story that we might have missed out on had they not extended it.  haven't received my copy from right stuf yet but watched it on psn the first day and can tell you its well worth it.",1364169600,,689,4.4015748031496065
8574726,5,B00BWF84NC,"We got 1 more episode left till it all ends. This was a great episode and its all culminating to a hell of
