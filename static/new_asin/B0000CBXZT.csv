7998715,3,B0000CBXZT,"This was a pretty good DVD, particularly the first one, which discusses the value dogs add to our lives from- service companions to herding animals and how they are trained, and what work they can be used for (such as rescuing skiers, and working with the military). While I did enjoy the DVD set, I felt it got a bit bogged down with the training aspect of the dogs especially since this is recapped again in the second DVD. I guess if I want training show I will watch the dog whisperer. It felt a bit like filler to me.

The second DVD, while filled with cute puppies was less interesting, and sort of meandered about with the family trying to decide on what dog 'works for them' and following the one girl who was training the dog for the blind. While these are worthwhile endeavors for the girl, as audience-fare it was a wee bit boring. They already covered guide-dogs for the blind in the first DVD.

I would've liked to see different dogs than simply golden retrievers and shepherds. There are many smaller dogs doing interesting things, and they omitted discussing the running dogs like whippets and greyhounds.

Overall, this was good, but not something I really think has a lot of rewatch value for me.",1325030400,2,1213,4.555045871559633
