7031172,5,B00U8ZYV2U,"This is a back to basics Slasher .With good practical effects. It starts with a tale about the legend of a young deformed Charlie and his cannibal family.

Of course some not so smart people think it would be a good idea to visit the farm,investigate and camp. All except  Tara Reid,who weighs all of 80 pounds! Charlie himself was quite menacing and huge at 7 feet tall and 350 pounds. His creature makeup was done nicely too.

So when Reid and Charlie meet it isn't actually a fair match up! The odds are much better when Charlie takes on Kane Hodder's character.

As I said before it's back to basics ,but I like formulaic Slashers. They're what I grew up loving and still do! There were quite a few brutal kills with a good amount of gore and the lighting was sort of dark during these scenes because they were usually done either at night or in a dark barn. So it made them look all the more real. There were a couple of kills in the daylight and one was a (WTF) I have to rewind this about 5 times moment!

I can't say that I really cared that much about the characters as to be disturbed if they got offed. It's not that they weren't likeable, they just really didn't resonate with me. I enjoyed it and definatley recommend it to other Slasher lovers.",1446508800,10,1258,4.291139240506329
7031173,5,B00U8ZYV2U,"This movie is a must for horror fans, a great modern slasher with all the right elements, not since Hatchet have we had a really powerful on screen maniac, Charlie certainly is one character I want more of! The movie is by the book slasher, a very simple set up and easy to follow story and plenty of mayhem, the movie is about a group of friends who decide to out in the Australian outback to explore Charlie's farm, there is an urban legend around the farm about the psychotic family that lived there who murdered and ate people, its believed their boy Charlie is still alive and lives in the outback somewhere, it borrows many ideas of course from many other old horror movies from the 80's and 90's and mixes them up, but the old formula always works and never gets old no matter how many times its done, the movie is a great throw back to classic 80's slashers like Texas chainsaw massacre and Friday the 13th etc, there is certainly plenty of violence and brutal bloody death scenes all done on a great budget, all the effects are practical and look great, the movie starts at a slightly slow pace but really kicks in as it goes and gets nasty and bloody especially toward the last half hour, the movie has a decent cast I thought, your usual dudes and babes waiting to be hacked up, Tara Reid hasn't been in anything this decent in a long while, Kane (Jason Voorhees) Hodder gets a small role which is always cool and Bill (House of a 1000 corpses) Mosley has a good part too, Nathan (Mad Max fury road) Jones plays Charlie and does a great job, a huge scary looking actor who has a great make-up and wardrobe in this movie, this is certainly one to pick up, its fun its funny its a better than average bloody slasher gore movie, I just hope we get to see Charlie return soon!!

7031174,4,B00U8ZYV2U,"Three young adults and Tara Reid decide to go ""out west"" camping in the outback at the infamous ""Charlie's Farm"" which was owned by John (Bill Moseley). There is a flashback segment showing us the family as cannibals and the mentally challenged son escaping.

Tara Reid plays a major role in this horror film, who plays roles where she gets bloody and survives for the sequel that normally never happens. Kane Hodder of Jason Voorhees /Victor Crowley fame has a small role. The slasher Charlie is played by a mountain of a man, Nathan Jones aka Megaman who competed in the World Musclepower Championships. He is clearly the next Tor Johnson, for what it is worth.

Standard slasher film. Takes about an hour to kick into the meat of the film. 3 1/2 stars

I only watched it because of Tara Reid, the action wasn't there, it ISN'T a horror movie, more like I know what's going to happen and it takes me 1 hour and 10 minutes to FINALLY get there! There IS no horror I guess you could say that the horror is in the killing of people but that doesn't start until about 1 hour or so into the movie! All it really is, id a movie about backpacking and exploring ""urban legends"".
It reminded me of a dumbed down version of Wolf Creek which was 200% better then this! The blood is bad, the acting isn't wooden and it DOES seem like they are friends but still.... NOT plausible! The killings were okay not the best but a little imaginative..

7031178,5,B00U8ZYV2U,"I just got this from my girlfriend,she picked it up at a local store cuz she saw it in my wishlist. This film is like an Australian version of TCM  & that is a great thing. It is a group of 4 backpackers and there looking to go somewhere exciting. Tara Reid has a strange and bad feeling from the start,and she is rightfully scared. The group goes out searching for this farm,against the locals advice at the pub. So the story in short is that this family used to kill people and eat them as they worked on their farm. they would kidnap backpackers and torture them til' death. well the townspeople got sick of the screams and sickness they imagined was happening out at the farm,so they kill both little Charlies parents. Fast forward to present time when the kids backpack  they meet up with a few more hikers looking to find Charlie....Well,they do ! There are 12 kills in this film & they are all cool. No ridiculous CGI just oldschool makeup effects and suspense,all around a creepy and desolate farm area. Well Charlie is all grown up and hell bent on devouring everyone who intrudes on the property.

However, the script was weak and I'd give an additional star if anyone other than Tara Reid was in this movie as she brought it down with her horrible acting (she is thin as a rail also).  Tara Reid got a couple Razzies because she is a bad, bad actress.  Her being in a movie only works with something like Sharknado which is very over the top fun and humorous!

7031195,2,B00U8ZYV2U,"I was looking for a horror film.  The reviews on this made it my choice.  I was very disappointed.  The saddest part was it could have been very good.  The problem is in the story and the script.  Generally, they say, a story has 3 parts- Beginning, the meat of the story with Herculean obstacles, and the resolution.  ""Charlie's Farm"" had two and a half parts.  It was never resolved because the Herculean  obstacle had no Hercules to defeat it.  Perhaps there will be a ""Charlie's Farm, part 2"".  In this case ""Charlie's Farm, part 1"" should have been abridged and told as a campfire story; which would lead into 'part 2'.
  Also, I read about this 'Kane Hodder' being this huge monster.  He may be but the skin he wore covered him up [at least most of the time] and when he was in action the shots were so close that you couldn't made out scale or nothing around him created mass.  I'm sure that he's at least 6' 2"", but maybe he's 6""' 8""; I have no idea.
  If this were the original ""Texas Chainsaw Masacre"" it would have ended when the girl in the white pants went unconscious- before she woke up at the dinner table with Grandpa.  That would have been a terrible ending.  But maybe it's Australian, and their stories end with everybody dead but the killer.  But that's 2.5 parts of a story.  ""Nobody knows, because everybody died.""  So all e see are a bunch of scenes, never to be resolved- unless there are sequels.
  Had it been 3 parts it likely would compare well  to ""Texas Chainsaw Masacre"" or ""The Hills Have Eyes"".  Good filming, adequate cast, for the most part very good quality throughout.",1455235200,,1606,4.417808219178082

7031203,4,B00U8ZYV2U,"There aren't many modern slashers that id consider very good but Charlie's Farm is definitely one of them. It also helps that it has Kane Hodder & Bill Mosley in it. Unfortunately it also has Tara Reid which is probably one of the only downsides. Basic plot is 30 or so years ago there was a family that killed & ate people, the towns people fought back, Charlie grew up (grew big too) & is still around killing. Young group of people decide to go to the place in the legend (Charlie's Farm) and im sure you know what happens next. Some of the kills are very brutal & one in particular will have guys everywhere flinching in pain. Charlie himself is a very menacing figure. Big, strong, brutal & merciless is how id describe him. Another downside (beside Tara Reid being in this) is the disc doesn't have any special features at all, just some trailers. If you are a fan of slashers & want to see a brutal one then watch this film, horror fans won't regret it.",1451779200,4,960,4.338888888888889

Charlie is also made out of flesh and blood, and bone and gristle, so when Tara shot him at point blank range with the high power rifle, that should have solved that problem. It was a little disappointing to see him get back up as if he had just awoken from a nap, so I gave it three stars. I think horror moves can be more effective when you make them semi-believable.

8704739,4,B00U8ZYV2U,"When you hear the tagline, you cant help but to think these people (i.e., the cast of victims) had it coming Two couples (including Tara Reid; Urban Legend, A Return to Salems Lot, Sharknado 1-6) venture Australia's outback to intentionally visit Charlie's Farm, a place with a horribly violent history. Now why would you go and do that?

Naturally, our vacationing explorers ignore the stereotypical harbinger and proceed to their ill-fated destination despite the fact that the two girls in the group find his creepy warnings more than a tad compelling.

Written and directed by Chris Sun (Boar), this Aussie Texas Chainsaw-ish movie is as troped as it is gory. It opens hard and brutal, then slowly drags for an hour of insufferably weak dialogue and exposition before releasing the Australian Kraken for the final (and thankfully exciting) third act. Its not unlike Hatchet II (2010) and Victor Crowley (2017), in terms of pacing.

Flashbacks illustrate Charlie (Nathan Jones; Boar, Mad Max: Fury Road) as a child, his messed-up father John (Bill Mosely, The Texas Chainsaw Massacre 2, House of 1000 Corpses, House), and the environment that reared his monstrous psychopathy. Such a childhood would easily yield a Leatherface or Victor Crowley, without a doubt.

As Charlie Nathan Jones is immense, working in the films favor. And, although the intensity of his presence has a short shelf life on screen, the head crushing, penis-slicing and force-feeding, lower jaw-ripping, and some nudity keep things rather lively.

At some point a concerned parent (of these twenty or thirty-somethings) heads out to look for them. Its a nice role for Kane Hodder (Smothered, Death House Hatchet 1-4, Friday the 13th parts VII-X), and the Hodder-Jones fight more than a little satisfying even if the action lacked splendid choreography.

The movie strangely ends right on a kill. I guess they couldn't be troubled to try and wrap it up. Or perhaps that was just another simple chapter in Charlies tourist-slaughtering Summer. But overall this was dumb gory fun, it was cool seeing Nathan Jones using his immense size to play a monster, and I enjoyed it for what it was.
