8597278,3,B00DSQ81S6,"Great to have the Ashes highlights but this is an abysmal DVD.  Feels like it has just been thrown together with very little thought.  There are no extras at all, very limited interviews [almost only captains at start of match] unlike earlier DVD's. An interview with Alistair Cook ends suddenly after a couple of sentences. There is no analysis [which exists on the 2009 DVD]. In addition to the poor content the menu doesn't allow the user to play the whole test, you must select each day.  That's about it!
I gave it three stars because it does have the highlights but every thing else about the DVD is a resounding 1!",1414368000,,621,4.526785714285714
