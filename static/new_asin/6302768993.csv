7830894,5,6302768993,"If you ever wanted to feel as though you could have the amazing guitarist Alvin Lee in your home talking directly to you, this is the video to buy.
He shares some very personal things about his life and career and makes it feel as though he is a close friend.
The video songs are awesome with Alvin's special brand of playing that no one else has ever been able to master as he does.
He takes you on his musical journey and what a ride it is!
He truly is a ""Guitar Legend"" unequalled!",1275955200,,484,4.105263157894737
7830895,5,6302768993,"First time I saw Ten Years After was in 1972, I had to see Alvin Lee since I was and still am heavily into the best and fastest guitarists, and the band did not disappoint. Same thing in 1978 when I saw Ten Years Later.

This 1993 release has some great 1969 Fillmore East footage along with videos from his Zoom album and some other bonuses. If you'd enjoy some truly rare TYA footage and are interested in Lee and TYA this one is for you.",1123286400,2,440,4.116279069767442
