2549587,5,B000F2CAJ2,"For many critics, it's very tempting to lump hard-to-categorize cinema with films from the same country.  In a way, Beat Takeshi does deal with some similar issues that Miyazeki/Gibrli Studios addresses in films: the old Traditional ways verses the Modern culture, history verses embracing the new, technology verses nature and ritual verses anarchy.  What's more confusing is that American viewers who aren't familiar with Japanese culture and mythology may miss symbolism that Japanese Traditionals and international folklorists are familiar with in storytelling, thus missing the depth of The Great Yokgai War (see Peter Carey's journey into Japan for a further explanation).  However, there is an audience for this film.  For those who loved the off-beat nature of The Happiness of the Katamuras (Beat), Tampopo, Monty Python films, Gilliam's films, the puppetry films of the '80s and Harryhausen's creature features, this film is a must-have.  While there are no common place symbols such as red gates, wells or kitsunes that frequently populate Japanese fantasy, this story is based in quirky product placement (post modern references to beer, anyone?) and swampy revelations with innovative, but traditional puppetry/CG work. Yes, it does posess some of the typical fantasy characters: a cute (but not in an annoying Disney way) poppet of a boy, a fuzzy creature that will make some viewers become obsessed with possessing a stuffed animal that looks like a sunekosur &, a wise & old guide, but somehow it works and the tongue-in-cheek attitude makes it rise to level of Time Bandits.  The dialogue superb and in this way, Beat's influences are more similar to say, Gilliam's or Itami's films than the corny dialogue that ruins otherwise impressive anime (ie. Howl's Moving Castle).

By far, this is my favorite 2006 film so far (have yet to see The Prestige or Gilliam's Tideland).  Sadly, it looks like Miike's latest release will suffer McKean's & Gaiman's Mirrormask's fate in 2005 as one of the most overlooked and misunderstood films of the year.

If you enjoy this film, I highly recommend reading Murakami's The Windup Bird Chronicle which deals with similar concepts and complexities and checking out Wolf's Rain, one of the strongest anime series that incorporates Japanese folklore.",1157241600,6,2300,5.279452054794521
2549588,4,B000F2CAJ2,"Yes, I watched this at the Brattle Theatre in Cambridge, MA and I have to say I thought it was AMAZING!!! I don't know how it'll be on DVD, but up on the big screen, it was tons of fun. Lots of crazy monster costumes, some tongue-in-cheek humor, and Grandpa's song about Azuki beans! (They are good for you!) No clue what American kids will make of it, but I loved it.",1152576000,5,368,4.125
2549589,2,B000F2CAJ2,"Only the second Miike film I could make it all of the way through, I doubt that I could watch THE GREAT YOKAI WAR again. Instead, I think I'll rent THE NEVERENDING STORY in the near future as Miike's flick seemed highly reminiscent of this kid's movie. Apart from a few moments of self-reflexivity, I didn't find much to entertain me in this bizarre monster movie. I can see enjoying it more if I were a few decades younger but, as a 33 year old, I was rather nonplussed by this drawn out classic good versus evil / messiah tale. The effects were good, especially the make-up effects, and the little kid lead (Ryunosuke Kamiki) didn't annoy me. 'Nuff said.",1149292800,4,656,4.475
2549598,5,B000F2CAJ2,"The movie is great, I've seen it before. I was drawn to this specific product because they advertised it as a double disk special edition. I ordered it and when I got it (earlier than they said I would which is nice) the wrapping says it's doubled disk. I opened it and there is only ONE (1) disk! Looking back on here to see if I ordered the right thing and I have, just the company that distributes this DVD lied about what you would get. I would return this but according to the disk I got and what is shown here is that the disk I got has special features while the 2 disk does not, so thanks for that.",1356912000,3,606,4.016528925619835
2549599,1,B000F2CAJ2,"I am very disappointed with this product, the Double-Disc Special Edition was ordered, but the regular single-disc edition was delivered. Before the disc could be returned, it was wrapped and given away as a birthday present, by my kid to his cousin, which was opened then played, the kids and I loved the movie itself, its a great fantasy that's both scary and funny. Wonderful. But, it was not the Special Edition that I payed for, so I was cheated. Perhaps they ran out of the Special Edition and thought they could replace it with the regular but inferior edition, and no one would notice. If the disc hadn't been given away as a present it would have been immediatly returned, but I can't take away a kid's birthday present. Very disappointing.",1354147200,2,749,4.681818181818182
2549600,5,B000F2CAJ2,"Seeing this movie reminds me of Alice in Wonderland.  It starts from the begining of the movie, there are good Yokai who want to help and there are bad who want to bring down the humans.  The bus ride to safety part in the movie is a total blast.  Pay attention who is the lead demon and the helpers, they are important to the finish of the movie.  The dubbing is good and easy to follow so is the video transfer.",1335312000,,413,4.061728395061729
2549601,5,B000F2CAJ2,"If you've gotten to this listing, chances are you're already familiar with the works of Takashi Miike. Doesn't the guy's versatility just astound you? From the hip-deep-in-gore classic ""Ichi the Killer"" to the unsettling ""Gozu"" and ""Auditon"", to his myriad gonzo Yakuza films, to his unclasiffiable movies (""Happiness of the Katakuris"", ""Bird People In China"") - Miike can do anything. Having recently seen ""Zebraman"" and then hearing about this, I was eager to see how Miike would do once again in a more family-friendly vein. Once again, he makes something in a different genre that also manages to bear his distinctive stamp.
I knew nothing about Yokai before I saw this. Simply explained: imagine if many places, animals, and situations had a sprite or spirit attached to them - that's a Yokai. Although it does turn out I had some knowledge of them: the concept of kappas from ""Kappa Mikey"" and the character of Tengu from fighting him in the game ""D.O.A. 2"". Using them in a children's movie provides many instances for innovative and sometimes shocking creature makeups, using everything from CG to hand puppets. Make no mistake -everything in this is well done; this isn't ""Godzilla vs Megalon"". And that brings to mind the laugh I got from the Gamera joke near the end.
Now while some us might want to think we can just plop this movie down in front of our kids, it's not so easy. The machine demons (and often the yokai as well) could be scary to a child who wouldn't be ready fr it. And there are dark turns taken in the story, particularly in regards to the small furry Sukemosori.
And speaking of non-child fare, did anyone else notice the faint thread of sexuality running through this? You have the dangerously sexy Chiaki Kuriyama (Gogo from ""Kill Bill"" - why has it taken her this long to be in a Miike film?), who's often provocatively dressed. Then you have the sensuous River Princess - there's some subplot involving her thighs. And the real head-scratcher involves the boy who plays Tadashi; a beautiful child. There's that scene that's intercut of all the yokai talking along with Tadashi putting on his armor. When he takes of his shirt and hikes up those shorts, it made me wonder what Miike was up to. Maybe this is just my perception; I don't want to make a judgement call...
Overall, if you're a Miike fan, don't hesitate to add this to your collection. It's a quirky (but enjoyable) little film that manages to take some dark turns toward the end: I was almost expecting Kato to rape the River Princess...",1301011200,4,2534,4.72234762979684
2549602,5,B000F2CAJ2,"The Great Yokai(Monsters) War!!!
Really interesting movie, I first saw it in Japan and looked for it everywhere, and Amazon was the only place that had it.

2549603,1,B000F2CAJ2,"What can I say?  I am a huge fan of all Japanese movies (anime and live actions).  The monsters in this movie were creepy (disgusting creepy).  My kids didn't like it from the beginning and left the room.  I finished it with fast - forward mode.
It is a good story, but because of the extreme make up and the hideousness of the monsters, it became too much to watch.  Sorry, I was fooled by the title and the reviews.",1236988800,,417,4.1625

I REALLY got into it.  I whipped out the Lightsaber app on my iphone and was wielding it to help the kirin rider prevail. (There was a shameless product plug for Kirin Beer, but it was worked in comedically, and actually made the movie more endearing.)  This movie was a walk into the world of the imagination, when we let go of the world we walk as a matter of daily course.

2549607,4,B000F2CAJ2,"Looking for Halloween costume ideas?  Have I got a movie for you.  I recall heaping praises upon the massive gallery of imaginative monsters brought to life in Guillermo del Toro's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hellboy-II-The-Golden-Army/dp/B001F7MSFW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hellboy II: The Golden Army</a>.  Well, leave it to Japan's most prolific and unpredictable director to outdo Hollywood at every turn.  ""The Great Yokai War"" is Takashi Miike's bizarre-yet-endearing homage to the creatures of Japanese fantasy folklore and the fantasy film genre in general.  Nearly 100 different kinds of them make an appearance in the film.  Some you may recognize, most you will not, but all are insane.  This movie is just a flat-out wild ride full of kooky humor, filming techniques new and old, and lots and lots of crazy costumes.  Join me, yeah?

The story follows a young boy chosen at a festival to be the village's Kirin Rider, a legendary hero said to be the rightful owner of a powerful sword kept by the Great Tengu in the mountains.  Everyone assumes this title to be a fun little yearly tradition, but this year is different.  There's evil afoot in the form of a couple of villains who are imprisoning yokai and transforming them into killer robots by throwing them into a big pot.  Yeah, I know, but work with me.  The young boy begins seeing monsters and then meets a cute little fuzzy hand puppet monster who becomes his friend.  Soon, he's introduced to many more yokai; some terrifying, some hot, some both, some friendly, and at least one who is just plain obnoxious.  That would be the ubiquitous Kappa.  Not sold?  Chiaki Kuriyama (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kill-Bill/dp/B00005JMEW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kill Bill</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Azumi-2/dp/B0013XZ6RU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Azumi 2</a>) in a white beehive hairdo.  Oboard now?  Good.

The story is nonsense, the humor is inappropriate, the special effects are uneven, and the tone is childish.  And yet you must see this movie.  Why?  Well the uneven special effects are because Miike uses every filming technique in the book.  There is some outstanding CG, tons of costumes as I mentioned, and best of all.....stop-motion animated robots, baby!  You know you love it.  Fans of both old-time fantasy and more recent works like the anime films of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Hayao-Miyazaki/dp/B0010O0154/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Hayao Miyazaki</a>&nbsp;will love the many homages to the classics new and old.  Spotting the different kinds of monsters is a blast.  Be on the lookout for the lovely Yuki-onna -which was featured in Japanese horror classic&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kwaidan/dp/B00004W3HF/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kwaidan</a>- as well as any other classic Japanese beasties you can conjure from memory.  I could swear I even saw the crab villain from Miike's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zebraman/dp/B000Z6GT72/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zebraman</a>&nbsp;in the mix.  And believe it or not, there is some damn creepy stuff here among all the childish glee.  A few scenes had me feeling downright uneasy.  Bravo.

Okay, the humor.  Any fan of Miike knows that inappropriate comedy is a trademark of his, but he really tries to hit it out of the park this time.  As if seeing our heroes hanging onto a plane's wing in flight wasn't silly enough, the picture freezes and a ""kids, don't try this at home"" caption appears. Also: I'd never seen urine successfully used as a weapon before; now I can no longer say that.  As an awesome-looking flying beast so massive that looks like it could swallow Godzilla whole flies over Tokyo, one spectator simply dismisses it by saying that it's only&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gamera/dp/B00096S31S/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gamera</a>.  And don't get me started about the climax.  Some people may well be turned off by these off-the-wall and out-of-the-blue bits of lighthearted fun at the viewers' expense, but that's the stuff that kept me smiling long after the credits rolled on this one.

Okay, so you've got nearly 100 costumed critters and a sword-wielding little kid battling&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Terminator/dp/B00005N5S5/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Terminator</a>-meets-<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Transformers/dp/B000VR0570/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Transformers</a>&nbsp;stop-motion animated robots, Kuriyama-chan in her best role in years, lots of goofy humor, fantasy homages by the ton, and even a sexy water nymph.  What's not to like, really?  The adult in me loves Miike's use of practical effects and old-school filming techniques along with some very effective CG as well as the flippant humor. [morphs to child]  But the kid in me loves the crazy costumes, sweet killer robots, nutty characters, and hot chicks.  Sorry, morphed back into a grown-up on that last one. If you're in the mood for a light-hearted fantasy romp the likes of which you haven't seen since the 80's then ""The Great Yokai War"" is for you.  The disc features a gallery of all the yokai featured on the film. It's quite lengthy, but a great feature for anybody looking to research the folklore behind the critters featured in the flick.

Soon, he is drawn into an epic battle between creatures from Japanese folklore known as yokai and a spirit created from the detritus of human civilization that uses technology to do its bidding.

Director Takashi Miike has produced a truly odd film.  Americans without some background in Japanese culture will not be familiar with these creatures, but they are well-known figures in Japan.  Therefore, they are not explained very well for the audience.  Just sit back let the strangeness wash over you.

If you know the folklore about the MANY Japanese spirits in this movie, you will have a big advantage over the casual viewer. The price is pretty steep, but if you are a diehard fan of Japanese live action and Folklore get it. Everyone else I suggest renting it first.",1221955200,3,545,4.494949494949495

If you know Miike, than just the thought of him directing a childrens movie is out of this world, and true to fashion he delivered another bazarr movie that is like nothing we have ever seen. This movie was just so much fun, I laughed through the entire thing.

Unlike most zealots in America, I WOULD recommend this to children.  Yes, it is intense.  Yes, at times it is a little nuts.  But its no worse than some of the movies I grew up with and my parents took me to see.  Ghostbusters always weirded me out.  Would I keep my 8 yr old from seeing it?  Hell no!
We have a habit of tryiing to shelter our kids.  This movie is now inappropriate for young viewers.  Its no creepier than ""The Neverending Story.""  I remember horses dying, an offscene evil presence, and many other aspects.  This movie is no darker than Harry Potter.

2549620,5,B000F2CAJ2,"I've never seen the English dub but I'm gathering if I saw this as a kid I would have been scared but would have watched it ever weekend afterward.  Now that I read, I've watched this movie countless times in Japanese, and honestly some of it only makes sense after I make up a reason for it being that way, but its not the kind of film watched for its Oscar plot but for it story telling and the costumes.  I mean japans acclaimed horror director made this children's ghost story Takashi Miike. Director of such films a Audition, and Gozu and here he is making a film for kids and his treatment is dark but true to the original sours.  Yokai a old suit monster movie from the 60s and 70s. Three of the major film is here in America the rest still not released here.  But that's ok, this films here and here to stay.

Also the acting from the supports and the main kid are superb, the kid actually scared me with his ability during some of the battle scenes.  And I'm not going to say the graphics are good there not but the par for Japanese pop films of our age.  And again you don't watch a Japanese monster movie for the CGI but for the people in Suits.  And you won't be disappointed in this film, ever in the extra features there's a monster file where you can look at ever costume made for this film.

The thing that makes this film for me is that in America right now, American are become so scared for darker material is never seen in our cinema anymore and definitely not for kids programming, but a outlet needs to be there and with these amazing Japanese ghost tales your child can have that outlet safely constructed to come to the conclusion of berries made of love, cast way the evil.

2549623,5,B000F2CAJ2,"Miike does it again! Just when you think you've got this guy figured out, he does something different and somehow makes it his own. THE GREAT YOKAI WAR is a fantasy movie in the same vein as NEVERENDING STORY, DARK CRYSTAL, ALICE IN WONDERLAND, LOTR, and LABYRINTH. However, by successfully integrating Japanese folklore and contemporary stylization, something new and fresh is created. While there is no overly didactic messages, elements of anti-consumerism and environmentalism are hinted at. Essentially the themes are as simple as believing in yourself and the magic of childhood.

Tadashi Ino is an introspective kid living with his mother at his grandpa's house after his parents divorce. When he is bitten by a puppet dragon (a kirin) at a festival, he is told by the local kids that he is now the Kirin Rider. Takashi takes the duty seriously as it becomes more evident throughout the film that this folklore is true. Soon enough this kid (who's a very good actor, by the way) is up to his chin in monsters and adventure! He teams up with a motley crew of spooks and weirdos (including the rock star of yokai, the KAPPA), gets an awesome sword, fights robots, and saves Tokyo from the forces of evil.

One of the greatest things about the film is the inventiveness of the yokai costumes themselves. All kinds of masks, suits, makeup, puppets, prosthetics, and digital effects are used to create an epic rouges gallery of monsters. Miike always works with great physical effects artists and designers. Also, Miike taps his large pool of veteran actors like Kenichi Endo and Renji Ishibashi to play some of the yokai. He creates a sort of yokai theater that both children and adults can get lost in. There are a few small scenes that might be a little on the scary side for very small kids, but overall this is a very colorful and light-hearted fantasy film. I'm glad this genre is making a comeback (MIRRORMASK comes to mind), and I'm happy to see that Takashi Miike dove right in there and gave us this gem.",1161734400,24,2016,4.724431818181818
2549624,5,B000F2CAJ2,"Kappa. Tengu. Yuki Onna, Kawa Hime. Chochin Obake. Kasa Obake.  Japan's fantasy monsters, called Yokai in Japanese, are an unending list of bizarre creativity, from a culture that spawns goblins for almost every situation.  Something of a national obsession, there are books and comics and movies dedicated to packing as many of them as possible.

Takashi Miike's ""The Great Yokai War"" (""Yokai Daisenso"") is the latest flick  to gather all the yokai together, sending all the kids of Japan running for their copies of Shigeru Mizuki's yokai encyclopedias to see if they can name that obscure creature that popped on the screen for a few seconds.  While Miike is best known in the US for his controversial hard horror films like ""Audition"" and ""Visitor Q"", this is not his first jaunt into light-hearted kid's films, having previously made the superhero film ""Zebraman.""  ""The Great Yokai War"" is a remake of a 1968 film of the same name, that was released as ""Yokai Monsters: Spook Warfare"" in the US.

All in all, it is lots of fun.  The story is pretty typical of children's fantasy, with the young boy Tadashi Ino being a nobody at school, the target for bullies and abuse. Tadashi is one day chosen at a local festival to be the Kirin Rider, for which he receives a small flag and a special lunch.  Although Tadashi doesn't think this actually means anything, he finds himself drawn in a yokai war, acting as the chosen human champion to help fight the evil Kato, who is merging yokai spirits into machine technology in order to create an army to take over the world.  Tadashi gets some help along the way, with his fighting companions being a kappa, the red-faced Kirin Herald, and the childlike but seductive River Princess.  Of course he has a magic sword.

The yokai are the real stars, and Miike has used modern special effects to create them in a realistic but amusing fashion.  Some of them are scary, some are ridiculous, but they are all actual creatures from Japanese folklore.  It is pretty cool seeing them all on the screen and moving around, especially the bizarre Kasa Obake, a haunted umbrella with a long wagging tongue.  Along with his digital monsters, Miike has pulled in some of Japan's great modern actors too, including the ubiquitous Takenaka Naoto (""Shall we dance?"" ""Waterboys"") and Kuriyama Chiaki (""Battle Royale,"" ""Kill Bill 1"").  It is really great seeing veteran actor Sugawara Bunta (""Battles without honor or humanity"") playing Tadashi's grandfather.

Lots of comparisons can be drawn between ""The Great Yokai War"" and other children's fantasy films like ""Neverending Story,"" and the similarities are obvious.  However, ""Neverending Story"" is a great flick, and what works there works here too.  Tadashi is a believable child-hero, and the yokai are as charming and funny as any of Bastian's companions.",1157673600,12,2840,4.928571428571429

(Once, America emphasized moral lessons in their films - the early 1900's - (Such were replaced by pure, often mindless Entertainment) And use their mythologies to dramatize them, along with offering life lessons learned by Japan
as a venerable, flexible yet centered culture. This film sure evidences all of the above.

Also TGAW offers, graphically beautiful, action-packed adventure with stunning effects. I collect Asian films
and art and have become a fan of their graphic institutions, from Manga, early watercolors, sculpture,architecture, product design and as here, motion pictures. (Much of which I acquired via Amazon, with more Asian arts than any online purveyor...)

A young boy is the hero, hassled by bullying school boys; a common, often-seen plot ploy (But he moves on to be most-often surrounded by adults, human and otherwise). 'TGYW' puts on a particularly Japanese spin. Look/listen for philosophical and spiritual injections amid monsters, morphing's (metaphors all), battle issues and family values, personal conviction/character/sacrifice. All presented in ways both children and adults can catch and think about together. TGYW's a particularly good see-together family film -  but the action and bizarre scenes (not even a PG  rating let alone R and up) Still, it can be appreciated from teens on. No one can be offend or confused by words or pictures.

I viewed the two-disk set which offers one of the best 'making of' rendition of the creative process I've seen, particularly exploring Japanese attitude of their artisans. It's an education, comparing Asian and Western Minds working, creating. Again, feasts for thought and discussion.

Akin to 'Yokai Wars'; here are some recommendations: (Amazon's usual 'insert' function was absent (?) at this writing...) :

THE LOST EMPIRE (Chinese, via 20th Century Fox), DREAMS (Akira Kurosawa, Japanese), WHY HAS BODHI-DHARMA LEFT FOR THE EAST? Chinese Classic), SPRING, SUMMER, FALL, WINTER, SPRING (Korean, classic). There are many more Asian films which can be enjoyed while opening Western Minds (just as Western movies have/can expand millions of minds in other countries... For better or worse) Last shot, two surprising films: THE TASTE OF TEA and DEATH NOTE (Japanese).

8116535,5,B000F2CAJ2,"This is a cute little Japanese film about a guy who becomes a hero even though at first he doesn't want to be. He saves the spirits in trouble, and it's a fun film for the whole family.",1372118400,,185,3.8947368421052633
8116536,5,B000F2CAJ2,"This engaging and entertaining film never takes itself too seriously, and you will enjoy it if you adopt a similar approach. Green-headed monster men? Check. Multiple-headed Terminator cyborg knock-offs? Got'em. Sword-slinging sweeties? Present and accounted for. Grab the popcorn and an extra helping of silliness. A fun martial arts Good Guys vs. Bad Guys romp for kids of all ages.",1366761600,,384,5.416666666666667
