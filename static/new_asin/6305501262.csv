Well, okay, although five stars might be a little much, if you're looking for a very enjoyable, totally mindless, obviously slapped together, completely unpretentious Hong Kong action movie, this delivers. Although there are some very disturbing and violent scenes involving a glue sniffing slasher who stalks women, throughout the rest of the movie, I laughed so hard tears came to my eyes. (Er. . . I don't know if it's really a comedy or not, and a lot of people would just find this stupid, but I enjoyed it.) It involves a bumbling woman-cousin (Moon Lee, who does a great job of looking cute and confused when she's not kicking people) from the rural Chinese countryside who goes to Hong Kong to visit her relatives. She discovers that her (male)cousin has been mistaken for a glue-sniffing pyscho-slasher taxi driver. Naturally she has to rescue him by catching the real killer which she does by running around confused and getting into kung fu fights. (Real dialogue: ""How is your family?"" -""My father is still coaching the national kung fu team and my mother is protecting the pandas in Szechuan."" But mostly she yells, ""Quick cousin! After him!"" and they run and they run and they jump out windows and chase people and run away and it's just great.) It includes some very strange and funny dialogue throughout.
Rollerskating kung fu, ugly crossdressing cousins disco-dancing, lots of fighting, screaming and yelling, and even a black face scene. (They have to disguise themselves you see.) For those of you want an in-depth insight into Chinese linguistics, with it's multiple dialects, whenever this woman has to speak in secret to her grandfather (the cops have tapped the phone) she just shouts ""Wuki-nuki. Wuki-nuki"" and he shouts back ""Wuki-nuki. Wuki-nuki.
This probably is not a good first date movie",1385337600,,1918,4.975077881619938
7890682,4,6305501262,"Originally released in Hong Kong under the title ""The Nocturnal Demon"" this film has just about everything but the kitchen sink! There's plenty of humor ranging from inane to crazy to downright disgusting. There's also plenty of action and tense/suspenseful moments as well. And it stars the adorable Moon Lee!
Moon plays wawa - a seventeen-year-old visiting her blind grandfather and cousin in Hong Kong while there's a serial killer that plys his trade when it becomes night. The threesome end up getting involved in the investigation with some wild results!
The highlight of this film is seeing Moon Lee use kung fu on Yuen Wah (one of the seven fortunes) while wearing roller skates. This scene is a classic and a favorite among hardcore Moon Lee fans. The only reason I gave this movie 4 stars instead of 5 is because this version has cut out most of the nastier humor which is probably better for some.",993168000,,908,4.753164556962025

But the grandfather always knocks them out with ether before they can get the translation.
