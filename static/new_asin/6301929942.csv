378433,5,6301929942,This movie is Beautiful and meaningful !!! Filled with eye candy & laughter and Love. The small town pics are really Great also. Very good movie and will watch again & share with friends that aren't conservative with closed minds.,1353628800,,230,4.775
378434,2,6301929942,"Another movie that ended up being a lot more lame than what the reviews led me to believe.  I'm glad others were so moved, but this film was pretty much pure cheesiness.  The relationships between the three brothers, for that matter the whole family, was pretty superficial and unconvincing.  It was nice to see the actors in their younger years, but for me there just wasn't much more to appreciate about this film.",1323734400,4,416,4.671232876712328

378437,4,6301929942,"I remembered seeing this on cable quite a few years ago and decided to search this movie out and as luck would have it, I found it here on Amazon.com. The first reviewer ""A Customer"" describes this movie perfectly. Good actors seen in their younger days handling family and life situations that are seemingly real here like Melinda Dillon, Dermot Mulroney, Sean Astin, Daphne Zuniga, Stockard Channing, Dinah Manoff (a fav of mine from ""Soap""). The characters are well defined and likable. The script is peppered with comedy, feeling and dialog you didn't usually find in films from the late 80's and early 90's. I don't buy many movies a year let alone older films but this was well worth the money I spent. Unforgettable scene: Sean Astin burying his face in a pantyhosed Dinah Manoff's large bosom while she's trying to change for work. Cheeky devil.",1250294400,16,853,4.809523809523809

378530,4,6301929942,"It's pretty good.  An engaging story and decently acted.  Father throws sons a curve ball by selling chicken restaurant which sons had expected to inherit, and it unnerves them plenty.  Oldest son rebels and departs, refusing to acknowledge father or to talk to him until it's too late.  The plot is a bit gooey and weepy but ultimately it's a feel-good movie because guess what?  Bad son grows up and reunites with what remains of his family.  It's ok.  Not grand cinema in the tradition of Gandhi and Lawrence of Arabia, but decent entertainment for a Saturday evening.",1486598400,,571,4.76530612244898

378533,5,6301929942,"Pretty good movie! Told a great story of a father who was dying, didn't want his son's to know, so he pretended everything was normal every day. The boys loved what they did and thought they would do it forever, ""The Family Business""; but it was not to be. The mom was really good at being understanding and ready for what was going to happen. All of the actors were fine at crafting their characters. EXCELLENT FLICK!!!!",1486166400,4,421,4.48051948051948

378591,2,6301929942,I watched a little over half of this movie waiting for a plot. Then I realized...it's a spot on portrayal of boring people in a boring small town living boring lives. It had some promise at the beginning (Stockard Channing) but wasn't worth watching to the end because I didn't care about any of the characters. You know it's bad when 1/2 way through the movie you stop to read the reviews to confirm how bad it is.,1485302400,5,415,4.333333333333333

379262,5,6301929942,"I cannot tell a lie, I got this movie that was released in 1989 and got it mostly for Sean Astin and Dermot Mulroney. Then I saw Tom Quill was in it and Stockard Channing and Daphne Zuniga and well let me save you the individual kudos....everyone was magnificent and definitely touched my heart and made me laugh. the 3 Brothers Sean, Tim and Dermot are out of this world and I bought that they were brothers because they had such an east way about them. the story is an old one and has before and since been done with maybe a few exceptions but rarely done this well. I highly recommend it.",1437091200,4,591,4.238938053097345

379312,5,6301929942,"I love the cast in this movie. To be honest, I had no idea what it was about before I rented it. I just went by the list of actors involved. Now I own it.  There are a few stories going on... there isn't 1 ""star"" that this film is centered around.  A great movie about brothers, growing up, forgiveness and helping each other through the rough spots.  LOVE this movie.",1379980800,,368,4.154929577464789

7816832,5,6301929942,Once you get past the crude sex scenes and drugs this is a great movie. It is real not fake choreograph sex scenes we are so used to seeing. Its about a family whose mom kind of lets her kids run the house. They live a carefree life until the dad becomes ill. He sales the business without telling the kids so he can have enough to provide for his wife after he is gone. Lets face it they were immature and would nt have been able to care for her. They all deal with having to grow up and find a job in their own way. It tells a story of a real family with flaws no fairy tale people here who figure out life.,1499644800,,609,3.8412698412698414

7816835,4,6301929942,"As far as movies in this genre goes, this is really a good one. While the music in the film and some of the styles dates it as an older one, it stands the test of time. The acting is good and without going overboard on ""heavy"" it does have enough to engage the senses in other ways. This movie is weighty on coming of age sensuality, as well as the bond between family members, which at times can be both light hearted and tense. The small town setting lives larger than one would expect and is a more progressive one too. If this film was re-done for today, they wouldn't have had to do much to make it translate, especially if they threw in current events or political messaging, which is so popular in todays movies. But that would ruin it. This film does suspend time a little and lets you appreciate it for what it is...a simple but beautifully rendered production with fab actors, many whom you will recognize as successful industry actors today. This is not a film for young children, but would be OK for older teens or others who can appreciate the script and the acting.",1495238400,2,1079,4.373134328358209
7816836,5,6301929942,"OMG EXCELLENT!!!  I wish this was made into a series on tv. no joke, this movie has a plot, family, love, drug & alcohol problems, lost love, the price you pay for selfishness, goals, illness, losing someone, lost careers, and just a shocking ending that was downright excellent. Well written, well acted, and as the audience, you disparately care about the characters and yes you want them to stay together.",1494720000,2,408,4.828571428571428
