3853353,5,B0026GDVAW,"I am 54yrs and only 15 lbs over my ideal weight, but my osteopenia is getting worse. I do not want to start drugs, so excerise and supplements here I come. I need to build muscle and the treadmill alone is not good enough. I had back surgery 30 years ago and I do have degenerative disc disease of the neck and spine. I can only do low impact excersises without hurting myself. I really liked this dvd. I was breaking a sweat without gasping for air. I need to strengthen my upper body, so this video fits the bill. I am really a clutz and cannot walk and chew gum at the same time. Unlike most excersise videos I have tried, I was able to follow the moves without getting confused or frustrating, yet they were not boring. Nothing is worse than getting a video and you still can't get the moves after SEVERAL attempts and just quitting. I also like the fact that this video includes shorter and longer works that I can do based on the time I have available to excersise. I am so glad I bought this video. I would like to try her other ones as well",1262995200,13,1048,4.167487684729064
3853354,5,B0026GDVAW,"As a long-time Leslie fan who was looking for something new, I had almost given up. I've tried Biggest Loser and several others, but found some of the moves just insane and painful. I'm still overweight, so fast deep knee lunges and some of the other moves that are on DVD's I've tried out are just impossible. Debra has been fat, so she knows how to work out larger bodies very effectively without hurting people. As others have said, she is super motivating. My arms ached after this workout, and according to my heart rate monitor, I was in the fat burning zone for almost half of it -- and that was the short workout!  Her DVDs are great bargains because the different 'mixes' section offers shorter and longer workouts, in addition to the basic workout which runs about 35 minutes. I've been walking several miles on an outdoor track and doing Leslie's 4 mile DVD's with jogging - and truthfully, Debra's workouts - when I give her all I've got - has me well worked out and sweaty!  Give her a try -- she's upbeat without being preachy or overly chirpy, and motivating without belittling. I'm a beginner/intermediate (according to my coach), so if you fall into this category, you might love Debra too.",1252540800,36,1207,4.609302325581395
3853355,5,B0026GDVAW,"I own all 4 of Debra's DVDs and this does not disappoint! Doing this DVD for the first time, I actually worked up a good sweat with 3-5lbs dumbbells which really surprised me! I have several Cathe Lifting DVDs and do moderate to very heavy lifting in the gym, but I am growing more fond of ""Functional Fitness"" vs pure strength. While it's nice to do a Cable Row with 225 lbs, lifting all that weight doesn't do anything for injuries or weak joints that I have. In this DVD Debra works on interval training with a few minutes of weights, separating different body parts with cardio. The strength count and patterns are usually 2 sets of 8 reps followed by 2-3 sets of 8 reps with Super Sets (working two body parts or combining 2 exercises together). She trains everything head to toe with quite a few shoulder exercises which are great for those of us with weak shoulders and/or shoulder-rotator cuff injuries. One crew member even uses ankle weights for added resistance during the entire workout! Her cardio is very basic here, it resembles Leslie Sansone almost with walking-style movements. The music is great and her positive attitude are so inspiring! I absolutely love Debra and I pray that she comes out with more DVDs! This DVD and this series for that matter make you feel strong, empowered, healthy, vibrant, sexy, and confident just the way you are! I highly recommend this DVD for anyone that desires or enjoys more functional fitness while getting in a great sweat! I literally had it running down my back and legs which rarely happens, but Debra makes it happen every time! I'm an intermediate+ Exerciser and Debra is my New ""Go-To"" Gal and absolute Favorite instructor!",1251072000,26,1686,4.71864406779661
3853356,5,B0026GDVAW,"I actually didn't care for Debra's first workout, but I thought I'd give her cardio/weight workout a try.  I am SOOO glad I did.  I love walking workouts, but needed a break from the ""walk, walk, walk!"" woman, and Debra fits that bill very nicely.  Even though I am not overweight, I do want to keep fit, and aerobic workouts with turns and steps just don't work for me ... I end up getting frustrated and quitting.  The cardio in this workout is a step up from my ""regular leader"" (okay, I'll just say it - Leslie Sansone) in that Debra adds some fun steps (mambos and cha-chas; dancey but NOT DIFFICULT!) and uses weights for better upper body work.  Debra also has a very encouraging, positive attitude ... something to look forward to in the morning!  Plus I LOVE the upbeat music!  :-)",1249430400,41,790,4.444444444444445
3853357,5,B0026GDVAW,"I have worn this DVD out!  This is my third copy.  This is not the most challenging work out, but it is great for an intermediate workout.  Add ankle weights and a weighted waist belt for additional challenge.",1425168000,,209,4.447368421052632

3853364,5,B0026GDVAW,This is my husband's account but I love this Debra's dvds. They are perfect for anyone is looking for a great workout without overdoing it. I will purchase more of her dvds. I would recommend this dvd.,1412121600,,201,4.45945945945946
3853365,5,B0026GDVAW,First time this morning with my Shapely Girl  DVD with weights. Debra is motivational and gives instructions without a lot of extra chit-chat. Makes it easy to stay focused. The whole DVD is very good.,1393977600,2,201,4.742857142857143
3853366,4,B0026GDVAW,"i should say firstly that the cardio element in this DVD is extremely low impact and for cardio my advice would be to try a different DVD.  If however you want strength training then this is the DVD for you. By selecting the ""mix"" option you are able to choose the ""weights only"" workout eliminating the cardio.  Without the interrupton of the cardio moves it becomes a much tougher workout.  Debra uses the same weights throughout but I have found it more effective to begin with lighter weights,changing to heavier ones as it progresses.  Also I do use the leg weights finding it adds a great deal to the leg toning session. The time taken is approximately 30 minutes and it is time well spent.  Since the muscles do get a good workout it is best to give them a 48hr break between workouts to enable proper recovery and reduce risk of injury (I usually do it Sun, Tues and Thursday).  As a result I now wear a lower dress size and am firmer than I have been since my twenties.  A great DVD to used alternatively with a brisk cardio DVD to achieve maximum results.",1376179200,3,1065,4.403061224489796
3853367,5,B0026GDVAW,This is a positive and good workout for plus sized and non plus sized women.  I love her workouts.  I am trying to get back or into shape been overweight a long time. Her tapes allow me to workout and feel good doing it.,1373673600,,220,3.977272727272727

3853369,5,B0026GDVAW,"This woman has a distinctive personality, but it's not in the least annoying (and actually a refreshing change from the typical fitness leader). It's a real workout too (most so for me heart-rate wise than a lot of The Firm circuit workouts that I so love). It's close to an hour total and is a circuit type workout. It would be good for those of any age and most any fitness level (although it leans toward the moderate level, you can alter it to fit any fitness level).  I have a lot of fitness DVDs and this is one of my top 20% DVDs.",1365811200,2,537,4.163461538461538
3853370,5,B0026GDVAW,I love this DVD workout. It really gets my heartrate up. I feel like I am working all parts of my body. It gives you extra choices to diversify your daily routine.

3853373,5,B0026GDVAW,This is the best overall cardio and toning DVD I have found in a long while.  Usually do a lot of the power walk DVDs as I am a gal in my 50s.  But was looking for something with a bit more intensity.  Debra Mazda instruction is simple and so are the moves but you work up a sweat and you will feel it in every area.  I have purchased this as a gift for friends who also think it's an awesome workout routine.  Overall about a 30 minute workout but you will be wiping your face off and puffing a bit unless you are already in top notch shape and even then it would be a great workout to start the day!,1351987200,6,601,3.8536585365853657
3853374,4,B0026GDVAW,"I am the target audience for this DVD: a plus size woman getting back into fitness after a long hiatus on the couch. I've been doing gradually increasing cardio workouts for about two months (including Debra's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Shapely-Girl-Let-s-Get-Moving-with-Debra-Mazda-Low-Impact-Cardio/dp/B0028P4WJA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Shapely Girl: Let's Get Moving with Debra Mazda, Low-Impact Cardio</a>&nbsp;video, which is fabulous), and have started adding in this video about twice a week for toning. This kicks my butt! In a good way, I mean. Everything I love about Debra's first video is here as well: the movements are appropriate and reasonably paced for a beginner, periods of 'active rest' keep the heart rate up while tired muscles relax between exercises, and Debra is upbeat and encouraging without being annoying. I'm only using 2 pound weights so far (not the 3 pound weights Debra uses), and by the time I finish the video I'm dripping sweat, a little trembly, and feeling proud of having pushed myself through.

BUT. I do have a nit to pick with this video. Despite her mention in the intro/warmup how important it is to use good form and promising that we would work on that, Debra does a very poor job throughout the video of explaining good form for each move. She doesn't talk AT ALL about key safety measures for weights and toning, like not snapping or locking the joints or how to do a safe and effective forward lunge. Fortunately I'm familiar with these principles from other videos with better instruction, but this is a serious omission for a video that may be many users' first experience with hand weights and toning. This could and should have been solved with an ""instructional"" session that could be viewed separately from the workout itself.

Nor does she consistently do a good job of explaining where you should feel the pull/burn/stretch with all the exercises; I would have very much appreciated some notes in the ""core"" section telling me which muscles I should feel working while I'm extending the weights up and across my body, the sort of direction that would help me self-monitor to make sure I'm really using my core and not just my arm and shoulder for that maneuver.

Despite the mediocre instruction, this will definitely stay in my rotation 1-2 times/week. I really enjoy the workout, Debra and her Shapely Girls are fun to start my day with, and I am very much looking forward to getting stronger and being able to move up to 3 and eventually 5 pound weights.

UPDATE ONE YEAR LATER: A year later and this video is still one of my favorites! Graduating to 3 and 5 pound dumbbells, and adding ankle weights, has kept this video challenging and fun even while I have lost weight and gotten stronger and more toned. I'm really pleased with how relevant and useful this workout has stayed, and how well it has ""grown"" with me.",1336521600,8,2930,5.047520661157025
3853375,5,B0026GDVAW,"I just got this one a few days ago and I LOVE IT..  I have very little upper strength and this is really is going to help me build that up. The first time I did it, I was sweating and that was such a good feeling.  I have been doing the cardio and weight combo workout and look forward to the day I can do it twice in a row...  Going to start using it, 3 to 4 times a week.",1317168000,3,373,3.524390243902439
3853376,5,B0026GDVAW,"I have a sizable library of exercise dvds; recently I came across Debra Mazda's. Workout dvds which cater to 'full size' people, are uncommon. I was intrigued, so I bought 2 of hers. I liked them, so I bought this one, with the weights. Dont let the light weights she uses fool you. This is a real workout, you WILL be puffing, and sweating by the time you're done! Most important to me, is her motivation to 'get off the couch and keep moving'. Her 'circle time' discussion with her exercisers is very helpful. If you need motivation, as a full-sized person, to get up, get to exercising and feeling better about yourself, your body and your life; PLEASE try her workouts. They are NOT easy, they are WORK. But she is so good to motivate you to try, keep trying and NOT GIVE UP.",1310774400,5,779,4.379310344827586

3853379,4,B0026GDVAW,"This is a great video for older people, very overweight people, or just anyone who does not get up and go on a regular basis.  The video is a great low impact way to get the heart rate up and get the body moving. Requires no getting down on the ground, strenuous lifting or acrobatic movements.  A great place to get started on the path to better health and fitness.  I also find Mazda's delivery to be less annoying than the other popular walking video from Sansome.  I own and use both videos, and I find the workouts are similar but sometimes I'm just not in the mood to listen to Sansome's animated commentary.",1295568000,2,614,4.359649122807017
3853380,4,B0026GDVAW,"I love this workout, but the layout could be better. The choice of chapters is limited. They should have enabled mix and match for all the chapters. The way it is now -choosing between only one long workout , with a repetiotion of the main program ,or separate shorter workouts, is a little disturbing. I wish it was more flexible and more varied. The program itself is paced well and takes care of most major muscles  while benefitting from  some aerobics as well. A nice workout for beginners-intermediate exercisers, and a nice change from the eternal :walk, walk,walk! from Leslie's production line.",1293840000,2,603,4.901960784313726

I love that the girls in the DVD are ""Shapely"" girls, and not super fit skinny muscle women.  This fact is why I chose Debra Mazda, and I have since ordered a second DVD by her.  It is easier for me to feel comfortable with the workout, when I can see women like myself doing it on the screen!

Ms. Mazda's instructions are very clear and she sets a realistic pace.  She also warns of changes and gives you sufficient time to adjust before starting the next move.  She encourages you to do the best you can so you don't feel intimidated and clumsy if you miss a few reps.  A most enjoyable workout time that goes by quickly.",1268784000,15,560,4.355769230769231

She is an inspiration to those ladies who are overweight and looking to get in shape. You will need a set of hand weights (or could use cans or water bottles with sand) Debra uses 3 lb weights. I used 2 lbs because that's all I had under 5 lbs. I didn't think it would do anything for me with the lighter weights, but with repetition, it worked out fine. I did work up a sweat, but did not feel sore afterward (probably due to the weights being too light). All in all it is a good solid workout.
