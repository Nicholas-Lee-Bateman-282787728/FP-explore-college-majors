8173917,4,B000GDYS1S,"Over a half-century after its 9/13/54 television debut on NBC-TV, the doctor series MEDIC retains a modern appearance. The four half-hour examples from Season 1 presented here deal with electroshock treatments for depression (""Break Through the Bars""), breast cancer (""The Wild Intruder""), coma (""My Brother Joe"") and a physician so caught up in the lives of patients that he neglects his own family (""General Practitioner"").

True case histories supplied this show's plots. Many episodes were filmed in actual hospitals with real doctors and nurses in peripheral roles. Well-known actors often guested and Richard Boone was top-billed as host. MEDIC aired 59 installments in two seasons, ending its run on 8/27/56.
