8414788,5,B0043DW48G,"Alot of this film footage was filmed right after Bruce Lee passed away. The music is kind of depressing though. But it is a great documentary, I have been looking for it for years in the states. It's ironic that I found this movie from a distributor in Italy that had the movie! It's a region B movie so I have to play it from my PC, but I am happy that i finally found it. If you are a Bruce Lee fan you need to have this in your collection.",1369267200,,442,3.868131868131868
