8308148,5,B0001DHSGA,"If you are new to Pilates, this is a perfect video.  It takes you step by step through the basics.  All the movements are slow.  I personally stop the video at certain points that I find more difficult for me.  I give myself the necessary time to do the exercise at my own pace, then restart the video.  I love the instruction book that also comes with the package.",1388793600,3,365,4.231884057971015
