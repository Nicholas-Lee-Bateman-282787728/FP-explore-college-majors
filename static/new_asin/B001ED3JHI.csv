8297794,5,B001ED3JHI,"Great early racing footage.
Silly story, but remember when it was made.
Love the high-speed driving with the Packard ambulance... THAT had to be a handful !!!",1377216000,2,158,4.888888888888889
8297795,4,B001ED3JHI,This is a great race car movie. I wouldn't have thought that Mickie Rooney could pull off this part but he is so young in the movie that it works. It's a black and white movie but still a must have for race fans.,1326585600,3,212,3.840909090909091
8297796,5,B001ED3JHI,"""High Gear"" is not high art, but if you can get past the fundamental inanity of the plot and just have fun watching the amusing leads, this movie turns out to be surprisingly enjoyable.  It's only 65 minutes long, and there is enough action as well as contemporary cultural references to make it highly watchable and interesting.  Parts of it might be unintentionally amusing, but if you're not too cynical this won't impair your enjoyment.",1291593600,4,440,4.8533333333333335
