8285473,2,B001C0NMWU,"This show is funny but I hope this grown man and cast is acting for the cameras. If not he is in for a wild ride....seemingly marrying the wrong woman (she wants everything he doesnt) and terrible in choosing friends it will be fun to watch his life fall apart. I hope no 46 y/o old man really can be so self absorbered. It will make you feel very good about yourself and see that money and fame might only complicate and diminish a full life.
If you have cable I think you can get on-demand if you just want to watch.",1207094400,6,518,4.088235294117647
