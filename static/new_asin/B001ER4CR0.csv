3557288,5,B001ER4CR0,"MXC is a hilarious take at a dub of the Japenese show ""Tokashi's Castle"".  Much like the current ABC show ""Wipeout"", contestants go through a series of obstacles with often ""painful"" failures but you can't help but cheer when the folks make it through!

The commentators are quite funny and quite un-politically correct.  The show definitely is not for someone with delicate politicial sensibilities as the commentators make fun of everyone from Hollywood's Jilted Wives to the Meat Packing Industry.

One feature missing in the later seasons from the first is a recap of the season's ""Most Painful Eliminations"" which was a hilarious addition to the first season.",1265846400,,664,5.12037037037037
3557289,5,B001ER4CR0,"This is a very funny show. You should get many laughs from watching people trying the crazy stunts, and listening to the dubbed english ""translation"" of the Japanese commentators. A must buy!",1260748800,,191,5.0
3557290,5,B001ER4CR0,"The humor gets funnier every time I watch it. There's just nothing like some quick-witted quips to accompany people bailing out into big mud puddles. It's a great season, just like all of them. I hope to own all of the MXC seasons soon. It is more adult jokes than anything, but that's because it's shown on SpikeTV here. But everyone can enjoy the fantastic attempts that people hurl every few minutes. Very fast-paced show, so pay attention and you'll be laughing the whole time!",1249776000,,481,4.670588235294118
3557291,5,B001ER4CR0,"What can I say it's MXC at it's finest! If you love the show as much as I do this new DVD was long overdue!!! Hilarious, Funny, and kept a smile on mine and my wifes face for days!",1244419200,,180,3.641025641025641

3557294,5,B001ER4CR0,"This set contains 26 episodes on 4 DVDs-all of the remaining season 3 episodes (including the CSI and Master Debaters shows that were not on Volume 3) and all of season 4. (A fifth season of 13 episodes was produced after these, which will hopefully end up on a future volume 6). I checked the running times of the episodes and all of them are uncut.
This set also includes two full-length episodes of the original ""takeshi's castle"" with english subtitles-one of which is the infamous ""Snow Special"" which MXC fans will remember from season 2. (there's a LOT of hilarious stuff in the takeshi's castle version).
This is a great deal, and I highly recommend it for MXC fans. (oh, and if you liked ""wipeout!"" on abc...this is where they got most of their ideas from.)",1226361600,29,766,4.598540145985401

3557298,5,B001ER4CR0,"Only watch this if you want to laugh uncontrollably at others peoples definite lack of athletic ability and willingness to ""Bif it"". I can sit there watch episode after episode of people throwing themselves at the seemingly Not-to-difficult obstacle course only to get thrown back on their face in rejection of poor technique. You aint gonna learn anything here, this video is recommended for times that you don't want to think too much but want to laugh a whole lot! The voice-overs done to the Japanese characters are quite outragous. They have at least a half dozen insults for every competitor and triple that for each other. These two hosts go back and fourth for the whole show ripping on each other and lodging allegations of perverse lifestyle choices at each other.",1422316800,,774,4.871212121212121

Could've had more bonus features, instead of just the OG episode of Takeshi's Castle (haven't watched it yet). Maybe a farewell compilation or something, I don't know.

I own every episode of this show.  The show is super witty, and has so many jokes packed into each line that you literally have to watch it over and over to get them all. It is one of my favorite purchases from Amazon. The two gentlemen who are narrating this show never ever miss a beat! In fact the women's voices (usually in the background) are usually what I key into and laugh hysterically at. I never cease to be amazed by this show. you will NOT regret buying it!  If you think this is like the show Wipeout, its not! The only small similarity is that there are people running through obstacles trying to reach the end on behalf of a team. That is where the similarity stops! :) GET THIS SHOW! In fact, do like me get ALL of the episodes you will be laughing for a VERY long time, and we all know that laughter is one of the best medicines to put us in a good mood!",1346803200,3,1388,5.481308411214953

I was laughing so much at times that I had to pause the disc just so I can savor the moment and not avert my attention and miss out on the next scene. Hands down, this is a must for MXC fans.

3557322,5,B001ER4CR0,"Came across these shows by accident on cable TV in Australia and they are now firmly established family favorites having bought the DVDs online.

What these guys have done to overdub the original crazy Japanese game shows and build new characters around the originals via the voice overs is just insanely funny and very clever stuff.  Our family now regards Kenny Blankenship, Vic Romano and Captain Tenneil as our most respected TV personalities.

Not for the politically correct, but for anyone with a sense of mischief and humor the laughs are plentiful and some of the one liners will stay with you forever.

A great substitute for normal boring team sports as the titanic physical contests are eye watering and the sports commentary amongst the best and funniest you will ever hear.",1311120000,,787,4.9393939393939394
3557323,5,B001ER4CR0,"Seasons 1 and 2 were great, volume 3 was lackluster, but volumes 4 and 5 are the best MXC episodes ever assembled on DVD so far. Volume 4 = Second half of season 3 and Volume 5 = season 4. Here you get everything you want from MXC, whether it's great Vic and Kenny moments, Guy interviews, short skits, and of course, the elimination challenges with every contestant giving a hilarious shout-out. There is so much replay value!

By the way, a fifth season was aired of MXC in 2007, but it was never released on DVD. It had equally awesome episodes as volumes four and five, and would have been released as a volume 6. The only way to watch it now is to buy it off of itunes for the computer exclusively... `",1298246400,,707,4.237037037037037
3557324,5,B001ER4CR0,"""MXC"" Volume Four and Five is 526 minutes of some of the most politically incorrect humor ever to air on cable television in the US. ""Most Extreme Elimination Challenge"" is taken from a truly bizarre Japanese game show called ""Takeshi's Castle,"" dubbed with completely ludicrous dialogue, reformatted and made into a true delight complete with the most unusual color commentary imaginable. Every episode pits two oddball teams (e.g. ""Las Vegas vs. Sesame Street"" or ""Malcontents vs. Baked Goods"") against each other in four challenging games with names like ""Sinkers and Floaters,"" ""Irritable Bowl Syndrome,"" ""Rotating Surfboard of Death"" (one of my personal favorites,) and ""Dope on a Rope."" These games range from modestly difficult to seemingly impossible. Many of them involve falling off of things, getting extraordinarily dirty, or general humiliation. In other words: it's a perfect recipe for comedy.

I have seen a lot of actual Japanese game shows on television (mostly in Hawaii; my favorite is ""Electric Rod Challenge"",) and they are true marvels of ingenuity. Add amusing editing, great writing, a lot of lowbrow humor, and commentary from hosts Vic Romano and Kenny Blankenship with unique field reporting by Guy LeDouche and genteel hosting from Captain Tenneal (""Well you're wrong!"") and MXC makes for great comedy, far better than even actual Japanese game shows. The set also contains two episodes of ""Takeshi's Castle"" for those of you who want to get the gist of the source material in its original form, which I highly recommend. It's particularly fun to watch the hosts and compare them to the personalities they acquire when they're dubbed in the US (I've often wonder what the actors think of MXC.)

These are some of the best episodes in the series, and if you're after politically incorrectness and cheap laughs, this show is hard to beat.",1281225600,7,1865,5.151815181518152
