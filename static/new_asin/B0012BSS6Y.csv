8244988,5,B0012BSS6Y,"Wonderful, a good account of how a conservationist/fisherman approaches life.  Continuing what he writes in his books with a personal approach to his love for fishing.  Wish there had been a little more on his great craftsmanship (his rods are excellent tools and are a joy to use--I have one.) Wish a lot more people would approach our outdoors with the thought and passion that Jerry expresses so well.  He can also back up his talk with technique too!",1337904000,,454,4.7215189873417724
