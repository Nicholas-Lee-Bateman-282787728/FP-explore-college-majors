6798843,5,B00PH1H7V2,"Saw this on BBC TV at Christmas. Loved it

Second time I have bought this DVD. The first was for my sister in Australia.

Today I have bought the DVD for my ballet loving daughter's birthday.

I love the mixed media style and if anything Shakespeare's play gains in translation to ballet. What is too silly to be said can be danced!

Most of the other reviews have said it all so this review is short and sweet.

I really ought to buy a DVD for myself!",1430784000,,452,4.149425287356322

6798845,5,B00PH1H7V2,"Despite the emotional roller-coaster, this ballet is an enormous amount of fun! It is packed with great stagecraft, acting, choreography and, of course, great dancing. The opening scenes are a bit sad with King Leontes  going insane with destructive jealousy, accusing his pregnant wife, Hermione, with cheating on him with King Polixenes. We see Leontes' insanity expressed through grotesque movements and we get to see some of his imagined moments of his wife's transgressions(to emphasize that these moments are only his imagination, the lighting is dimmed and they are clearly transitory; his wife is not actually cavorting with Polixenes!). After these beginning moments, the ballet becomes more cheerful.
This is a modern ballet and utilizes classical ballet choreography quite consistently. The women dance on pointe. The choreography expresses the story line very nicely. There are many solo variations and pas de deux as well as other groupings. This ballet has an enormous amount of dancing, more than most that have come along lately! You can become out of breath just watching this.
The music is also great and contains neo-romantic, neo-classical, and neo-baroque episodes--all of the ""neos"". Joby Talbot's style is becoming recognizable, somewhat along the lines of a gigantic theme and variations(I don't mean that as a negative).
Adding to the excitement is fantastic lighting and stagecraft, which should make this fun for even the youngest audience members.
This is one of the most exciting ballets to come along lately and it should appeal to all lovers of ballet.
There is a nice special feature on this DVD of interviews with those who created this ballet.",1429833600,10,1677,5.280898876404494
6798846,5,B00PH1H7V2,"Christopher Wheeldon at the top of his form as a choreographer.  He has set himself a Herculean task here--transforming Shakespeare's complex, multi-toned late romance as a narrative ballet.  He does it with superbly crafted movement and sure dramatic instinct.  Strongest are Edward Watson's sudden attack of jealousy as Leontes and Zinaida Yanowski's long limbed, patient, nurturing Paulina.  However, everyone is in the vein and all dance and act seamlessly.  The danse d'ecole is stretched, varied to suit the scene but always balletic, always there.  I suppose if this work belongs to a tradition it is the line from Fokine through Anthony Tudor.  The original score is wonderfully crafted for dance.  I will want to watch this wonderful work again and again.",1427241600,4,764,5.256198347107438

6798849,2,B00PH1H7V2,"I had looked forward to seeing this, both because of Wheeldon's brilliant work in some other ballets, and because of the excellent Royal Ballet casting.  Unfortunately, it was a disappointment.  The play ought to be easy to translate into ballet because, like Shakespeare's other later romances, it has a fairy-tale quality, a simple (double) plot, and very straightforward characterization.  Leontes, King of Sicilia (Edward Watson), wants his dear friend, Polixenes (Federico Bonelli, king of Bohemia, to prolong his visit to the Sicilian court. Polixenes is set on leaving until Leontes's pregnant wife, Hermione, persuades him.  Leontes then goes mad with jealousy, accusing Hermione of committing adultery with Polixenes and rejecting the baby daughter she bears as not his own.  It's important that it be clear that Hermione is innocent, but in the ballet she and Polixenes dance away from the others off into a sculpture gallery and intertwine their bodies.  Edward Watson, who has been a delightful cavalier up to this point, warps himself physically in order to convey Leontes' twisted psyche.  Lauren Cuthbertson has been a splendid Hermione up to this point -- what extensions! -- but, as in the play, she becomes abject and then disappears, supposedly dead, to reemerge near the end.  That's why it's so important that she be an innocent victim, not someone who made love with her husband's friend among the statues.

The baby Perdita is conveyed by Leontes' order to a seemingly desolate coast.  We next see her as splendid Sarah Lamb, a piece of perfect casting.  She and Florizel (Polixenes' son, of course) fall in love.  Steven McRae is, as ever, a wonderfully gracious partner for Lamb and excellent in his own solos.  Most of the second part is a pastoral festival with a lot of ensemble dancing.  The trouble is that the ensembles and the two principals are scarcely made to relate to each other.  They're often on stage at the same time but seem to inhabit different spaces.

In the third part, the lovers arrive at Sicilia, where Leontes by now know his terrible mistake, and is made to move even more distortedly so as to convey this.  He does it very well, but I missed the brilliant dancer of the early part.  He does have a few good moments left after things get sorted put, Hermione turns out to be alive, and Polixenes returns and is reconciled with his erstwhile friend.  Bonelli and Watson get to do some excellent dancing, all too briefly.

This production has to be classed among Missed Opportunities.",1424476800,7,2533,4.943262411347518

Christopher Wheedon in this video.  It is gorgeous and it tells the story in so beautifully, words fail me.  If you like ballet, if you love ballet, if
you are not sure about ballet, this is a worthwhile investment.",1472342400,2,350,4.523809523809524
8687843,5,B00PH1H7V2,"While the second and third acts drag a bit, the first act alone is worth the purchase price. Edward Watson of the Royal British Ballet breathes true madness into Leontes that won't soon be forgotten. This retelling of Shakespeare's tale of madness and redemption is a tour-de-force for the unconventional principle, Watson.",1470182400,,323,5.230769230769231
8687844,3,B00PH1H7V2,"This ought to have been a fabulous ballet -- choreographed by the brilliant Christopher Wheeldon, and with splendid principal dancers.  Lauren Cuthbertson is superb as the wronged queen -- her suppleness and her long line are splendid, and Edward Watson is perfectly cast as her pathologically jealous husband.  But his jealousy is expressed through grotesque, spavined movements that become, frankly, boring after a while.
(It isn't like Roberto Bolle in ""Notre Dame,"" where the character's physical deficiencies are the basis for some highly inventive choreography.)  The long sequence in which Cuthbertson and Federico Binelli dances through a gallery of statues is beautiful, but it seems to mean that Hermione really is in love with Polixenes, while of course the whole point is that Leontes is out of his mind. The ballet is partially redeemed by the beautiful pastoral act in which Sarah Lamb and Steven McCrae display marvelous lyricism as the lovers.",1463875200,,959,5.296052631578948
8687845,5,B00PH1H7V2,"See this! See this! See this! Just saw National Ballet of Canada perform it in DC at the Kennedy Center. A joint project of the Royal and NBC.

8687847,5,B00PH1H7V2,"This Blu-Ray DVD from Opus Arte features Edward Watson as Leontes (and what a marvelous job he does bringing forth his characters suspicions into the kinetic language of the ballet form), Lauren Cutherbertsons Hermione is captivating, Zenaida Yanowsky is simply stunning as Paulina, and Federico Bonelli as Polixenes is wonderful as Leontes boyhood friend.  And Sarah Lamb and Steven McRae are beautiful as Perdita and Florizel, the young lovers.

Part of the challenge of this work is essentially how to express Leontes suspicion of an affair between Hermione and Polixenes, and Christopher Wheeldon deserves an insane amount of credit for coming up with physical language with Mr. Watson to convey not only the pain of the emotions from Shakespeares text, but the physical manifestations of what each character is experiencing.  This is masterful work on a number of levels, and it bored straight into the heart of this viewer.  The rawness and simultaneous grace of the movements of the performers coupled with the magnificent score as conducted by David Briskin is just simply breathtaking, and the sets and lighting thereof form a cognizant whole that is possible only when everyone is committed to giving everything they have to give.

As the second Act unfolds, it is clear that Ms. Yanowsky is completely emotionally invested in her performance, and what she does on stage with Mr. Watson is so painfully beautiful that it is difficult to put into words.  This quality of work is why some of us go to see live ballet, in the hope of witnessing this kind of magic with our own eyes.  But having it captured on video is a delightful thing indeed.  The entire sequence when Hermiones statue comes to life is incredibly moving, and both the dancers and the orchestra complement each other in a way that is pure poetry that spans the senses.  Yes, this is that good.

The DVD itself has extras that provide insight into the specifics of the kinetics of the dancing itself, as well as the composition of the music and the challenges faced by Joby Talbot, the composer, in bringing the story to fruition via the medium of sound.  The lighting is gorgeous, and everything about this production is simply top-notch.  This is artistry of the highest form, and a delight to watch unfold.  It is one of the jewels of my collection, and I highly recommend it.",1451779200,,2354,4.869674185463659
8687848,4,B00PH1H7V2,"Ballet is not a medium I often enjoy.  My favorite ballet involves elephants and crocodiles.  But, because I want to enjoy the best of everything, I give ballet a try every now and then.  The best live performance I've see was in Abbington Virginia, a great Midsummer Night's Dream.  The worst was a performance of the Nutcracker in Patterson New Jersey were the music was played on a phonograph and one of the dancers fell down.  I recently watched this modern ballet version of The Winter's Tale, and it was -- pretty good.  If you like ballet, you'll probably like it a lot.  Pay attention to how they deal with the famous stage direction, ""Exit, pursued by a bear.""",1433548800,,669,4.571428571428571
8687849,3,B00PH1H7V2,"I wish I could give five stars to this Royal Ballet production, but I found it a clear disappointment after the fantasy and effervescence of Alice's Adventures in Wonderland by the Royal Ballet. This is a dark story, and very convoluted. Christopher Wheeldon is a master at choreographic adventure in Winter's Tale, and the protagonist Leontes twists himself in contorted positions which display the twisting of the soul characterized by envy. The first act is very tragic, the second act inexplicably rosy and bright, full of dance display by the corps and by the peripatetic Steven McRae and the beautiful Sarah Lamb. But it all doesn't add up to an enjoyable ballet film. The ending is quite touching. But many scenes, like the dancing in Act II, go on too long. I have to say that Steven McRae lights up whatever he steps his toe on, he is a true find. And his pas de deux's with Sarah Lamb are inventively intertwined. But I can't say I enjoyed this ballet as a whole.",1431129600,4,973,4.630057803468208
