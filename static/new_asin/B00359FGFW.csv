8388761,5,B00359FGFW,Use this at church to give me 5 minutes to set up. Kids love it!,1428364800,,64,3.3333333333333335
8388762,3,B00359FGFW,"This is an outstanding DVD -- clever, hysterical, fantastic animation. This has been one of my granddaughters very favorite ends for 2 years (she's 4 now). Even grandma enjoys it! The reason I am giving it 3 stars is because our copy had major issues with it ""sticking"".  Very disappointing and frustrating.  I should have returned it but didn't end up doing so.  My granddaughter loved it so much that I bought another copy from a different company.  However that one ""sticks"" terribly as well. (No, it's not my DVD player as I don't have this problem with any other dvds.) I was going to throw it away but my granddaughter still tries to watch it. When it gets stuck she pretends she's pausing it!",1426118400,,699,4.568
8388763,5,B00359FGFW,This is a hit with all ages from 2-12. We watch this at least 3-4 times a week and my kids don't get tired of it! They request it and laugh throughout the whole movie.,1423008000,,167,3.8
8388764,5,B00359FGFW,I used Jungle Beat at church as a children's pastor.  It was great for when we had a few minutes left before service was over and the kids were waiting for parents to pick them up.  The kids loved the DVD and would beg for it.,1420675200,,226,3.891304347826087

8388766,5,B00359FGFW,This video is enjoyed by kids and adults alike in our house.  The short length of each video is great since we can watch a few or the whole hour.  I appreciate that the kids need to use their imaginations and think about what's happening in order to figure things out since there is no dialogue.  The animation is appealing and effective.,1394928000,,338,4.419354838709677
8388767,5,B00359FGFW,I got this DVD for my sin. It arrived quickly and was in excellent shape. He loves animals and plays the DVD all day long in loop.  I am satisfied with this purchase.,1394841600,,166,4.03030303030303
8388768,5,B00359FGFW,"These shorts are fantastic.  Our son absolutely LOVES them and laughs so hard he's practically falling off the couch!  We first saw a few shorts while he was watching Smile of a Child on tv.  So, we looked online and we were very pleased that they offered the DVD of the shorts.  They are very well done - great animation and so creative!

Note - the other DVD with the four frames on the front contain the same shorts as this one does.  The Amazon page says that they are often bought together...but keep in mind they are the same!  The only difference may be is that this one has more languages (which is not a big deal since there really isn't any talking that I can remember in them...perhaps it's for selection titles and such.)

Anyway, we highly recommend this. It is fantastic and your kid will love it!",1331337600,,811,4.36
8388769,5,B00359FGFW,"I have not seen this entire video, but I have seen many of the Jungle Beat clips on tv that are on this video.  My kids ask to replay it over and over and over, laughing hilariously!!  It is fun to watch for adults as well!!  I was so excited to see it video form (and just ordered it) so I don't have to watch for the short clips on TV and replay then over and over!!!!!  It is not your ordinary show, and it is a funny, refreshing change, obviously made by someone with a great sense of humor!",1287792000,,495,3.92
