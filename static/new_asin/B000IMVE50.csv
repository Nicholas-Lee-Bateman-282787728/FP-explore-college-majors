2659146,4,B000IMVE50,I watched all of these movies one night and they are all pretty good. They all have creepy atmosphere and would be great to show at Halloween.,1323216000,,142,4.296296296296297
2659147,5,B000IMVE50,"Picked up the EVIL ANIMALS triple pack for GRIZZLY, and loved the set.

Off of that collection I picked up the DEMONS triple feature and the MUTANT MONSTERS triple feature.  I finished the entire 3 films of the DEMONS box in one day, they were all a blast.

The Other Hell is one of the few Nunsploitation films that is actually a horror film over straight trash sinema.  No nudity to speak of, but some cool bizarre ""medical room in the nunnery"" scenes that are worth it, and a decent ending twist if you don't mind that out-of-the-blue type film twist.

The Ogre: Demons III is not the 3rd film of Lamberto Bava's Demons and Demons 2 film series, but it IS written and directed by Lamerbto Bava and had a great atmosphere of freaky and cool effects with a winning Goblin-esque sound track.

Lastly is Black Demons, a later entry into the schlock horror genre that is a trip back to 80's gorehound days.  Enjoyable despite being mostly a retread with a little infusion of voodoo flair.

If anything in these descriptions sounds up your alley, then pick this set up and you'll have a grand ol' time!

2659149,5,B000IMVE50,"The Shriek Show packs are always a great deal and this one is no exception. The three films included (Black Demons, Demons 3: The Ogre, The Other Hell) are all okay, not great, films on their own, but here you get them together, and at a cheaper price than getting any one of them on their own. Also, each is the same DVD that is sold individually, so its not like those deals at Walmart where you get a free dvd at the cost of getting fullframe or rated instead of unrated or whatever the case may be. Each one is the same all around package as you'd be getting on its own, so if you're looking for any one of the three in here, this is the obvious choice.

As for the films themselves we have Black Demons which follows some tourists in South America who stir up the vengeful dead upon an estate in the jungle. Some okay gore and an overall creepy feeling. A little convulted like most of these Italian films, but if you've seen more than a couple of them along the same lines, it's nothing you can't handle.

Next up, we have Demons 3: The Ogre. It's a franchise title stealer, so don't come expecting the likes of Demons or Demons 2. We have the story of a horror writer who heads out to a castle and begins to feel that she is being stalked through the castle by a monster that haunted in her youth and has been the inspiration for all her writings. It's an alright film, but really drawn out and with a ridiculous, uncertain ending. Still, the tension between the woman and her husband, who doesn't understand her paranoia in the least, is interesting to watch.

Finally, there is THE OTHER HELL, a story about nuns gone wild. But not naked. Not a lot of gore here. Or story. Or acting. Good to watch once if you're into this sort of thing(and if you're looking at this pack you should be) so whatever. I was cool with the other two films, and this one wasn't BOTTOM of the barrel(mostly because it wasn't shot on like three cameras with two lights) so okay.

It's a good set. Two decent movies, and one movie worth a looking at anyway, all for less than the price of any one of these movies on their own.",1220227200,11,2111,4.243781094527363

8146423,2,B000IMVE50,"""The Other Hell"" is the best of the three contained in this boxset. Decent story of possession in a convent. ""Black Demons"" has one or two cool gorey kills and some well edited depictions of a voodoo ceremony but mostly wastes its potential with cliched characters, what feels like a half written plot, and totally crap sound (everything is muffled). ""The Ogre"" should never have been made. I watch a lot of Italian b-movies, so I can forgive a lot in the name of overall ""cool vibe"" but this was a turd.",1432944000,,504,4.489130434782608
8146424,5,B000IMVE50,"I don't have room for reviews for all the films in this set, so I'll give you my review of THE OTHER HELL:

Really bad Italian nunsploitation film that opens with a nun embalming another nun (who died while getting an abortion), who suddenly goes insane (or is she possessed?) and starts stabbing the dead nun in her private parts while ranting, ""The genitals are the doorway to evil!"" The film quickly goes downhill from there. After several nuns are found brutally slaughtered, the head of the convent, Mother Superior Vincenza (Franca Stoppi; CAGED WOMEN - 1982), calls in Father Inardo (Andrew Ray) to investigate. Almost immediately, his Bible catches on fire, he sees visions of owls and bats and one of the nuns shows signs of the stigmata (bleeding of the hands and feet, mimicking Christ crucified on the cross), so Father Inardo begins the rites of exorcism to rid the convent of evil, but he is cut short (What is in the attic that the Mother Superior doesn't want him to discover?) when the stigmata-afflicted nun disappears, leaving nothing but bloody clothes and sheets in her wake. The Catholic Church decides to replace the elderly Father Inardo with the younger, more modern Father Valerio (Carlo De Mejo; THE GATES OF HELL - 1980; THE HOUSE BY THE CEMETERY - 1981), who believes the Devil is merely a symbol for the evil in the human heart. The church sends him to the convent to investigate the murders, where he acts more like Sherlock Holmes than a Catholic priest. He uncovers a history of abuse and madness in the convent, which dates back to the mysterious death of the convent's first Mother Superior many years ago. A stubborn Father Inardo, who refuses to believe in Father Valerio's new methods (which includes videotaping his exploits), sneaks back into the convent to perform an old-fashioned exorcism and pays for it with his life when a fireplace spews out it's flames and sets him on fire. As things get stranger and deadlier at the convent, Father Valerio still refuses to believe anything supernatural is going on. He's wrong, of course, because Mother Vincenza is hiding a deadly secret in the attic: Her horribly burned telekinetic daughter, who was quite possibly the result of a sexual assault by old Scratch himself. Maybe now Father Valerio will believe in the supernatural. Oops, too late! Mother Vincenza drives him completely mad when he discovers her secret. In my best Edward G. Robinson voice, let me say this: ""Where's your Savior now? Yeah, see!""  Deadly slow and atrociously dubbed, THE OTHER HELL is a chore to sit through. It doesn't help that director Bruno Mattei (ROBOWAR - 1988; SHOCKING DARK - 1989; THE TOMB - 2004), here using the pseudonym ""Stefan Oblowsky"", films many of the scenes without the benefit of any artificial light, making the viewer squint frequently trying to make heads or tails of what the hell is going on during the gore scenes. The script, by Claudio Fragasso (the director of MONSTER DOG [1984] and the classic badfilm TROLL 2 [1990]), plays fast and loose with the facts on display. While the final denouement leads us to believe that all the deaths committed at the convent were by human hands (albeit with telekinetic abilities), it's frankly hard to believe, because some of the deaths, including that of convent caretaker Boris (Frank Garfeeld), couldn't have possibly been by human means. Mattei does try to keep our minds off the absurdity of the plot by tossing in some gore (several bloody stabbings and a baby being thrown into a pot of boiling water) and the unfortunate scene of a live chicken having it's head chopped-off (the Italians have no shame when it comes to showing real-life animal violence), but the film is so static and uninvolving, it's hard to comprehend just what type of audience Mattei had in mind when he made this. It starts off as a nunsploitation flick, turns it into a quasi-Giallo film and then ends with a CARRIE-inspired finale, complete with a jump-scare final shot. I found the whole exercise a boring mess. This was released to U.S. theaters under the title GUARDIAN OF HELL in 1985 and is also known as THE PRESENCE. The electronic score, by Goblin, was lifted from Joe D'Amato's BEYOND THE DARKNESS (1979; a.k.a. BURIED ALIVE), which also starred Franca Stoppi. Also starring Francesca Carmeno, Susan Forget, Paola Montenero and Sandy Samuel. If you must watch this, pick up the widescreen DVD from Media Blasters/Shriek Show. The VHS tape released by Vestron Video in the mid-80's is a badly-cropped, overly dark fullscreen print that is the R-rated edit, missing small bits of nudity and gore. Mattei (who died in 2007) freely admits in an interview on the DVD that this is one of his least favorite films in his rather huge canon of films. Not Rated.",1430265600,,4778,4.832722832722832
8146425,5,B000IMVE50,"BLACK DEMONS
With nice locations because it's filmed in Brazil, this is a slow-moving film that lacks action and a high body count. We've got stuff like what is obviously a real scene of a chicken's head being cut off during a ritual, nice scenery, some good atmosphere, and very graphic and effective gore scenes. The directing is good, and the acting can be considered to be below average or decent; I've seen worse acting from other low budget Italian horrors. I also thought the soundtracks are excellent, which helps the film a lot. The slow-moving zombies are well designed and menacing with rattling chains and wielding weapons, and there's an effective sequence when you see the old cemetery ignite with fire with a tombstone bleeding when the zombies awake. Unlike other zombie flicks, the zombies don't eat anybody in this one. They kill with the weapons they wield, and the graphic sequences should definitely please fans of slasher flicks and gore.  However, the film is slow. It takes around a half hour for the first murder, and then it takes over 25 minutes for the second one. As I said above, it's slow moving and doesn't have much violence; although when the gore scenes happen, they are nice and graphic. If you want sex, nudity, and fast-paced action, then this isn't for you. I thought it was an excellent and well done horror film, but the slow pacing may be a problem with some.

Interviews with Lenzi and Olga for the extras, as well as trailers. The DVD quality is great. The quality on this one is the best out of the three.

DEMONS 3 THE OGRE
This family travels to this old and exquisite stone mansion or castle. The place is secluded with only a small old-fashioned town nearby. There's a nasty ogre in the place that I thought was well designed, but this is a really slow film. It has hardly any violence whatsoever. It takes almost 70 minutes for the ogre to get the babysitter, and you see nothing because it cuts away. He just starts to tear off her shirt, sort of like the other girl in bed that he feels up a bit. There's some topless nudity in a tub scene that also has some very difficult to see full male nudity, (the guy gets out of the tub really quick while nude, but you can't really see anything) and there's a little boobage when the ogre feels up that girl in bed; so it doesn't really deliver if you're looking for nudity. We also get some decomposing corpses in an underwater scene that was obviously inspired by INFERNO. That ogre doesn't do much throughout the entire film, and don't get this one if you want gore. I didn't have any problem with the acting or directing. It also has excellent soundtracks, very good scenery, some nice atmosphere, and I thought the monster looked really good and ugly. It's a good flick to watch at night, but this slow film really lacks action and will be tedious to some; I really liked it despite the fact that it's a film that has only a limited amount of stuff actually happening. With some trimming of some scenes, it could get a PG-13 rating.

DVD quality is really good, but the picture blacks out for a couple seconds or so in one part. You get a BAVA interview and trailers.

THE OTHER HELL
This has some gore in the beginning with a topless nun laying dead. This is the only nudity in the film. It's slow in parts and may feel kind of lifeless at times. It takes place in and around an old convent with nuns. The soundtracks are intense and great, but some may find the scenery bland and uninteresting. It also would've been better if they used more atmosphere in parts. It's a dark toned film about a cruel nun who apparently had a daughter with the Devil. The place is cursed with the Devil doing assorted supernatural stuff. Some of the violent scenes are effective, but it may be tedious to many and lacks action overall. It's gory in parts, but the film, overall, isn't overloaded with gore. The film contains a real scene of a chicken being decapitated. Whether or not you like the directing depends on if you like Bruno Mattei's other films. It also doesn't have the fun factor of some of Mattei's other movies. If you want a fast-paced and fun film with loads of gore, violence, action, and a tone that isn't really dark, then I wouldn't recommend it. It has a great 80s feel, and the great soundtracks added a lot to the film. I also liked the entire grim climax.

DVD quality is very good. You get an interview and trailers as well.

All three of the DVDs come in separate cases. The packaging is nice.",1408233600,,4505,4.479902557856273
8146426,5,B000IMVE50,"The best movie out of this triple feature box set is BLACK DEMONS (aka Demoni 3). The other two are OK. I'd have to say that THE OTHER HELL is better than DEMONS III (The Ogre). One fault is that during one scene in THE OGRE the picture blacks out while the sound is still heard. It seems like a glitch in the pressing of the DVD. It is very noticeable! I had to go back to the scene to make sure it wasn't my player. It wasn't! It is a DVD glitch for sure! So far that is the only imperfection I found. Apart fom that, this is a collection I highly recommend. BLACK DEMONS and THE OGRE are a must for those who own the Argento DEMONS collection - seeing that both of these movies were/are known as DEMONS 3.",1373932800,,708,3.992957746478873

8146429,3,B000IMVE50,"The packaging good, it looks cool, but the movies are all very like Italian Art House or something, very slow and all about tension or mood, not really the horror or exploitation I was expecting, and not really great examples of moody dramatic horror, I love films like the Blind Dead series for example, but these didn't really do it for me. I love these Shriek Show sets and have at least 6 or 7 of them, and this is the only one I really found dull or boring. If you look up the titles on amazon individually all three have a reviewer average rating of 2 stars.",1329091200,2,564,4.231481481481482
