8517699,5,B007IPQ3CE,"A lovely and deeply moving portrait of a great singer who quickly rose to recognition and appreciation and sadly, very sadly died young of cancer. There is much striking footage in this film, and much that will cause your eyes to tear up, for sure. As accompaniment, there are boxed sets of complete recordings on EMI and a second on Decca. I will review that separately but the Decca box is a must-have to accompany this touching portrait of Ferrier.",1359158400,3,451,4.65

8517701,5,B007IPQ3CE,"I was 10  when Kathleen Ferrier died, and I still feel I have lost a very dear friend. Listening to her singing will always be a source of joy and comfort deeper and richer than words can express. Kathleen was born to sing.",1344988800,4,223,4.186046511627907
