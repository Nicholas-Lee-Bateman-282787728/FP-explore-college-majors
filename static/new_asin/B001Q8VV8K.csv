That in itself wouldn't matter to me if the movie was in pristine shape and looked sharp. Here's the thing, I tried to play the disk in 3 different NTSC DVD players and none of them will read it. My HD DVD player gave me the error that the disk wasn't in DVD format. Nice hu? And it's only $15. Ummm No thanks",1249344000,5,476,4.129032258064516
