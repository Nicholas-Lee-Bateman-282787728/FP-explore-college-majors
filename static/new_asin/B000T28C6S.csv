2891944,3,B000T28C6S,"If someone who is spiritual wanted to create a horror movie, this would be it. Apparently coming back to life from the dead is quite common. What I don't understand is how the body regenerates once you escape hell and climb back into it. How is it that it is only young people at the funeral home? How is it that dead women all wear tight black pants with spiked boots? Are they all skilled in martial arts?

The chase scenes had a ""Terminator"" quality to them. The movie was too complex for what they were trying to do. Coming back from the dead and trying to avoid the Reapers is movie enough, but they added a twist in a dead, now alive, guy's (Sam) missing girlfriend. If that wasn't enough, they blindside you with an incredible plot twist, involving his brother, the dead girlfriend, and a once dead oriental man, who apparently has eluded the reaper for quite some time now.

This is a low budget film. Normally I judge low budget film the same as a $200 million dollar film. In this case I thought this film was worth the view so you can see the quality film $15,000 can get you. The script needed some tightening up, but I liked the concept.",1275782400,2,1150,4.344186046511628
2891945,3,B000T28C6S,"I ordered this movie 'cus Jaimie Alexander was in it.
Only problem is that she is barely in it.
I love Jaimie and will watch anything she does, and although this movie was tolerable, I really missed her presence. Her all too brief appearences were at the beginning and end. So, as a Jaimie fan, I was disappointed with The Other Side.  }:o(

ps (02-16-13)- for those folks that my entry did not help because of lack of movie review... sorry! But, there are plenty of good reviews to read. I'm not a horror genre fan and my focus was as stated, I'm a Jaimie fan. As such, this was intended to help others that like all things Jaimie! Hope that clears it up for those reading the reviews. }:o)",1253059200,3,691,4.3076923076923075
2891946,5,B000T28C6S,I loved this film! I saw it in Atlanta at the film fest and it rocked! The cast was amazing under the direction of Bishop. Nathan Mobley - Samuel North was phenomenal. He reminds me of an early Matt Damon. I give 5 stars - check it out!,1196553600,2,236,3.9375
2891947,4,B000T28C6S,"Part of the fun of reviewing low budget horror films is finding that diamond in the rough. It may only happen once in every ten films but when it does, it makes it all worthwhile. The Other Side does make the grade as a surprisingly entertaining horror film made on a miniscule budget. It's not a true horror film in that there really aren't any frights...it's more of an action/drama with horror elements.

Sam (Nathan Mobley) is returning home from college early as a surprise to his girlfriend Hanna. They've made a date that afternoon at their favorite spot in the woods next to a waterfall. Sam waits and waits but Hanna never shows up. Just as he's about to leave to go and find her, a pickup truck slams into Sam's car, forcing him over a ravine and to his death. Sam awakes in a terrifying environment...a dank, dark place, which surely must be Hell. Two others grab Sam and force him out of the Pit. Oz and Mally are two other condemned souls who have escaped Hell on more than one occasion, and are set on trying to redeem themselves and get into Heaven. But Hell does not give up its souls so easily.

They send three unstoppable killers after the escaped souls. These reapers are almost un-killable. Kill them and they just jump into the nearest dead body and once again pursue the trio. Only be killing them far enough away from and possible host bodies can send the Reapers back to hell. Sam not only has to avoid the Reapers but he must find out what happened to Hanna, and who murdered him.

The Other Side is a well-made film technically. Too often low budget films try to pull off special effects and make-up and it just comes off looking bad. Director Gregg Bishop knows the limitations he has in terms of money and thus forgoes futile attempts, concentrating more on character development and plot. This fact alone make the Other Side better than many other low-budget horrors. While inexperienced, the cast does a credible job. They seem comfortable and deliver their lines in earnest. You might recognize Jaimie Alexander from another recent horror film, Rest Stop, which wasn't nearly as good as The Other Side.

The film does have it's weaknesses...the mystery of what happened to Hanna and who killed Sam is pretty easy to guess early on. Also, it was a little too cute that whenever the female reaper got killed, the body of another young Goth chick, who dresses in black, was always readily available. I would have preferred to see their looks completely change with each new body they possessed.

Solid film and worth a rent.

REVIEWED BY TIM JANSON",1194566400,3,2577,4.615720524017467
2891948,4,B000T28C6S,"Samuel North (Nathan Mobley) is skipping his college graduation to get back to the woman he loves, Hanna Thompson (Jaimie Alexander).  A cell phone conversation sets up a rendezvous at their favorite spot, but the meeting never takes place.  One of Hanna's co-workers tells a little lie to get some jerk to leave her alone, and that sets the jerk on Hanna's trail.  As for Sam, he begins the victim of a strange car accident and wakes up in a hospital bed, where he learns that Hanna is missing and that all those strange dreams he had while he was unconscious were memories of time he spent in Hell.  The bad news is that Sam was killed by the accident, but the good news is that he has escaped from Hell, which results in more bad news because Hell has sent a trio of demon bounty hunters known as Reapers to fetch him back.  So Sam has to find the missing Sarah and avoid the Reapers, aided and abetted not only by Peter (Stephen Caudill), a friend who happens to be a cop, but also Oz (Poncho Hodges) and Malley (Cory Rouse), who have also escaped from Hell and provide the brawn and the comic relief Sam need to get out of this situation alive (depending on how you define ""alive"").

Writer-director Gregg Bishop supposed made this 2006 film guerilla-style for $15,000 in Atlanta, and by that standard the results are pretty impressive.  While watching the film I was wondering why they seemed to always being filming during the day time and not having the money to shoot at night, or on real sets, or with lots of special effects, would pretty much explain it.  That being said, it is ironic that ""The Other Side"" reminded me of ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Matrix/dp/B00000K19E/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Matrix</a>,"" but that would be in regards to the basic situation: guy who thinks he is normal discovers he is in a different ""world"" where there are sides and strange stuff happening.  Ironically I had watched the pilot for Kevin Smith's ""Reapers"" on television a couple of weeks ago, and I was a devotee of the Grim Reapers on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dead-Like-Me/dp/B0001GF2F6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dead Like Me</a>, but none of them would stand a chance against Bishop's Reapers.  There is a limited amount of blood and gore here, because the emphasis is more on action, which explains why I want to think of ""The Other Side"" as being much more of a supernatural thriller than a horror film.  Plus there is a great little gag involving those Neighborhood Watch signs.

I had some concerns over the basic situation here once the rules of the game were laid out, but I took all of that with a grain of salt because I picked up on the fact that there were clearly things we did not know that would better explaining what is going on.  That indeed proves to be the case, but they are not predictable things that you can figure out before they are sprung.  What Bishop has going for him in ""The Other Side"" is that he takes his story and runs with it; things are always moving in this film and that forgives a lot of faults, especially when the cast commits to what they are being asked to do.  I admire the effort more than I enjoyed the results, but there is much to be said for a film where the problem is the production's lack of money rather than a lack of brains by the people controlling the creative process.  When you think of all the low-budget dreck you have seen in your life, especially in the horror genre, this little independent film helps restore your faith that there are people out there who can do a lot with a little.",1192579200,13,3654,4.739747634069401
2891949,5,B000T28C6S,"I remember viewing The Other Side at its west coast premiere in Hollywood, California back in 2006.  This film not only has amazing special effects but it also has a very personal story that usually lacks in mainstream films today.  Gregg Bishop's unique story telling technique and the non-stop action will constantly have you at the very EDGE of your seat.

2891950,4,B000T28C6S,"Though this definitely could have benefitted from a bigger budget, more experienced actors, and a little more polish on the editing and directing sides, this is a solid effort offering up some fun action and a clever storyline. Infused with some genuinely funny moments, an impressive score, and some startling violence, this is an action thriller that doubles as a mystery with a supernatural twist. In summary, an impressive little film, an interesting find, and I applaud everyone involved; they clearly put a lot of energy and artistry into this, and it pays off.",1189209600,18,567,5.042553191489362

2891973,4,B000T28C6S,Put this team together with the Dead Files team and they could heal the nation! Talented group of investigators. If not a  bit green but they'll learn. I was surprised that there isn't anyone familiar with Christian tradition or demonology. Never needed to get holy water? Really? Especially if you are using devices for yes or no answers and getting letters of names. That's essentially a Ouija board and anything can come through and lie. I believe both the Aboriginal and Christian methods are needed to address spirit on this continent. And you have to have a medium with powerful spirit guides.,1497744000,,599,4.872549019607843

It is one of the most original types of ""ghost hunting"" shows that I have ever seen.  It's well formatted, shot, and executed.  It is not a ""normal"" or ""chilling"" type of show, but it does make you pay attention, and keep you occupied and interested as to what is coming up next.  The show also gives you a really good complete background of the building/area that they are investigating.  Definitely a show to watch!",1476230400,,544,4.4

2892104,4,B000T28C6S,"Wholly predictable, certainly not original, and a tad bit melodramatic.  But you know what?  This film works.  It works on a visceral level-the stunts and action sequences are spectacular when you consider the miniscule budget.  In fact they are pretty good overall regardless of taking the budget into account.  The film also works on an emotional level-you buy this love story, hook, line, and sinker.  The final reel might even inspire a tear or two; it is that effective.  You really have to hand it to director/writer/everything else-man Bishop, who is able to do some great things here with so little resources.  The acting, while not overly spectacular, is spot on, especially a couple of the supporting actors.  Don't miss this film.  Whatever it lacks in originality it makes up for with the style and flair of an obviously committed filmmaker in Bishop and a rather convincing love story (as aforementioned).  Movies nowadays are a waste of money, which is why I haven't seen a movie in the theater in over five years despite being a rabid film-addict.  ""The Other Side"" is that tasty video treat that rises above the Hollywood machine and provides good old fashioned entertainment that's fun, stylish, and convincing, backed by an earnest cast, action sequences that rise above the budgetary constraints, and obviously bear the marks of a passion project (courtesy of Bishop, who literally does it all here).  Don't miss it.",1414108800,,1435,5.0042194092827

2892109,5,B000T28C6S,"The first time I saw this movie was a couple of years ago, I rented it from the local video store, not even realizing it was a low-budget film. I just liked the description on the back and it seemed like something different that what's been done and redone thousands of times. I was not disappointed! This is not a normal ""horror"" movie, similar to how ""Lost Boys"" was not a typical horror movie. They did an amazing job throwing in some comedy, drama, and action. Too often horror writers take themselves way too seriously, and it destroys the movie. This was overall an awesome movie with a terrific storyline. The low budget is obvious from the start, but that doesn't take away from the quality at all. I think if it was a mainstream movie then the pressure to make money in hollywood would have destroyed it. I loved it so much, I rented it at least 5 times then bought it. One of my favorites of all time.",1375142400,,911,4.364705882352941
2892110,4,B000T28C6S,"First off, if you want THE OTHER SIDE, you can get it ""cheaper"" as part of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Fright-Fest/dp/B008L0YMXC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Fright Fest</a>&nbsp;package - 12 horror movies for about the same price. So you get THE OTHER SIDE, plus 11 other films.

THE OTHER SIDE is not quite a horror film. It's more of a theological thriller/action film. A young man escapes from Hell, along with others. Back on Earth, they are hunted by ""reapers"" -- kick-ass demons who seek to return them to Hell.

There are three ""Reaper"" demons. Two men who dress retro -- trench coats and black fedoras. And a young goth chick who is your typical&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Lara-Croft/dp/B000MX7V70/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Lara Croft</a>/<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Resident-Evil/dp/B000MPEIF6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Resident Evil</a>&nbsp;leather-clad, kick-ass femme soldier. (She was poorly cast in this film -- the actress is petite, and the role calls for a tall, Amazonian, bodybuilder type woman).

Even so, the entire cast performs competently. That's rare for a low-budget film. (The filmmaker claims it cost $15,000, but it looks way more expensive -- of course, filmmakers often lie about budgets, so who knows if it's true in this case?)

THE OTHER SIDE has some very impressive stunts and martial arts for a low-budgeter, especially several falls from balconies -- including one in which the guy lands in the back of a moving pickup truck.

The script is well-plotted, with some nice twists and turns, some unexpected.

This is not a scary horror film, but an action-packed theological thriller. The escapees from Hell must redeem themselves while back on Earth before the Reapers inevitably kill them. If they do, they go to Heaven when they die again. If they don't, it's back to Hell.

Why did this young escapee -- who seems like a nice guy -- end up in Hell? That's one of the film's surprises.

An enjoyable film, impressive stunts and effects, good story and themes, and a competent cast.",1365465600,3,2162,5.819620253164557

I really like that the Aboriginal views and religious traditions are included as they should be, they are not taken into consideration in the US shows which I find rather irritating.  Some of the EVPs they get are super clear and amazing.  The conversations they are able to have through various means and the info they get from them is pretty cool.

I really like & agree with the investigators respectfulness of the spirits, the spirituality they include in their investigations, & how they try to help some spirits cross over.  They actually try to help the spirits that seem to want help, which is a facet sorely lacking on other shows of this type.  Why disturb beings if you can't offer them any aid, right?!

OMG this is the best you guys can do? ""I'm uncomfortable"" is all she kept saying. If I sign up for a GHOST SHOW I better be prepared otherwise get out. Just like Ghost Adventures, lately all the do is scream and run, not scary. 2) The spiritual healer, OUT! He is not credible. Every time he talked I just wanted to turn the TV off. 3) Bill i thought was awesome. He was the backbone of the show, he was ready to go there. No fear. He would just walk in and do his thing. Shame that this show can be cancel because of the Priscilla and Spiritual Leader. Bill seems ready to take this show to the next level and he is being held back. This is why I gave it 3 stars, because of him. The other guy, well, I still don't believe he knows much. I'm not convinced. The show needs new editors, a lot of talking, I don't care what you think, I want to see some investigations, some EVPs, not them talking. Waste of time. Show more investigation footage.
Sorry for the long post guys but needed to vent hahahaha. Just annoyed with this show because the potential is truly there and feel bad for Bill lol",1502150400,,1244,4.1234567901234565
