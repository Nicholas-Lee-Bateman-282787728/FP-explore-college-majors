1950942,5,B0000VD0MY,"Great Soul collection at a reasonable price.

It makes me want to pull out my Jumpsuits, dust off my platform shoes, and grow my 'Fro again!

But my wife of 37 years gently tells me ""Once was enough with you!""

So I tell her ""This SweetBack is all yours now,"" as we cuddle up to look at these movies and reminisce together.

Peace.

8003719,5,B0000VD0MY,Cooley High has always been my favorite movie had it on VHS for years I'm happy to have it on DVD now.  Beware these are not for younger audience. Had a great time watching them Pam was the Queen of the black spoliation area.,1399939200,,225,4.113636363636363
8003720,5,B0000VD0MY,I could have done without Cooley High - but to be fair even it has its place in Black history.  I just loved the Black action movies back then.  There were some very good ones.  And some corny.  But I've also seen a lot of other corny movies - so seeing my own people represented - and knowing lots of Black actors were working at that time - made me feel good about making this purchase.,1397865600,,388,4.065789473684211

8003724,5,B0000VD0MY,"You'd only buy these oldies if you dig the movies.

And I dig seeing women fighting bullying men back!

Pam Grier is my girl!

And I had to have I'm Gonna Git You Sucker in my collection. That is one of the funniest flicks ever!
