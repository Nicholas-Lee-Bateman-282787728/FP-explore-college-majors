903477,5,6304634242,"He once embodied one of the most flagrant abuses of power ever exercised by an out of touch president, but in 1994, Oliver North took to the campaign trail, in a bid for a U.S. Senate seat in Virginia. From beginning to end, North's campaign seems to embody all the dark and hypocritical realities that American citizens suspect, but don't generally believe, our elected officials embrace in running for office. North's ruthlessness in plotting to use sexual rumors against his opponent, Senator Chuck Robb, contrasts sharply Robb's naive but honest political hayseed public persona. North is willing to stoop and crow, which may sadden those who always saw him as the fall-guy in the Iran-Contra scandal. Taylor and Cutler juxtapose North's Congressional testimony, admitting that he lied to Congress, to his ""on the campaign trail"" act, proselytizing to high school students about honesty.  North comes off even worse than his right-wing counterparts, for while they enjoy abusing their naive opponent, they seem to know that their mean-spiritedness is a tactic, whereas North seems to enjoy the prospect of punishing Robb more than the idea of being elected.
North's campaign advisors make just as interesting a spectacle as North himself. They are, without exception, hard-working, extremely successful people. They make their living by being the sort of people who get called to either back up, or respond to, threats, attacks, complaints, schemes, and calamities. Their bravado thickens the air of the chaos that bleeds through the entire documentary.
The most revealing moment of the entire documentary is when, upon writing North's concession speech, his campaign advisor pauses in a rare moment of reflection and remarks that, while running for office is about building walls up between people, governing is about tearing them down and coming together. We soften towards him in the end, as his eyes well up upon hearing North deliver the speech, part of it being lifted from a poem inscribed on a coffee mug belonging to his grandmother.
Only upon reflection during the rare calm moments can the audience occasionally sense his disquiet. In high school civics I read that extremism in defense of liberty is no sin, but I now wonder if schmoozing, snarling, misleading, browbeating and back-scratching are.
A Perfect Candidate gives the audience a glimpse into the heart of American electoral politics.",1017360000,16,2410,5.227390180878553
903478,5,6304634242,"A bare-bones documentary, I wish it could have been longer. The back cover had a shot of North and his manager having a conversation with Bob Dole. I would have loved to see the conversation in the movie.
This is perhaps a one of a kind political documentary. It is emblematic of the North campaign's arrogance to have allowed this kind of access behind the scenes. It is an insider's shot for the outsider, to see internal campaign discussions. One of the discussions was of the need to convince a public unenthralled with Chuck Robb, to settle for Ollie North. Everything else beside it, that was the central effort of that campaign: get the voters to 'settle' for Ollie North. They didn't pull it off.
Right away, with the convention speech, we see in full force the kind of mind-numbing demagoguery that was Ollie North in 94. Most Republicans, in a conservative state like Virginia, couldn't abide hime, since they realized his polarizing effect was a danger to the party internally and externally. Only the most uneducated reaganites bought into his brand of blather, mainly because it was so boringly obtuse. Most reaganites, being educated people, couldn't buy into his program after the way he had served the President in the 80s. The Ollie scandal was THE most serious political threat to Ronald Reagan to erupt in two terms.
It was dreadfully amusing to see North lie to the highschool kids, saying he hadn't lied to Congress (since his conviction had been overturned, according to his reasoning), when the documentary begins with immunized testimony of North declaring, ""I lied to Congress."" One way or the other, the man is a liar; just not a very skilled politician.
Probably the most painful, hysterical, and unforgettable clip is Chuck Robb scuttling through the grocery store, desperately trying to find someone's hand to shake. The hapless Robb should have been able to slam dunk North, as an incumbent with a whole political party united behind him. When the Robb and North campaign managers chat during the candidate debate, it's perfect insight into the candid cynicism.
The campaign manager is the real star, a disgraced fringe player in Republican politics trying to make it back into the big time. Watching the behind the scenes campaign was discomfiting. ""Adolescent"" was the word that kept coming to mind. Watching their smugness and arrogance, and their ""wit,"" was like watching teenage boys finding themselves very very amusing. That's why I'm afraid this film will be a one of a kind.
The candid moments of the campaign manager, his ""bread and circuses"" segue and his observations on the political process, were touching. We can't help but feel sorry for him watching him try and fight his way back from the boonies. At the same time, we can't help but feel contempt when watching him gloat over the North ""acceptance"" speech on election day. This is a unique documentary, worth watching a couple times.",1008806400,4,2932,4.925252525252525
903479,4,6304634242,"What's most fascinating about A PERFECT CANDIDATE is the inability of North and his staff to see what's going on around them: openly despised by a large percentage of their own party, publicly rebuked by fellow Republican and wildly popular US Senator John Warner and campaigning in the shadow of some of the largest negative polling figures in US political history, the North For Senate people still arrogantly assumed the office was theirs for the taking.
Seeing their stunned faces on election night is worth the price of this tape.",991353600,13,535,4.955555555555556
903480,4,6304634242,"A fascinating documentary about Oliver North's failed US Senate race that parallels the apex of political power held by the Religious Right in the US.
As a former Democratic campaign staffer and consultant myself, the documentary captures the trials and tribulations of any busy statewide campaign and should be shown to all political science majors seeking a career in politics.  However, I recommend that you view this film more than once, because by the end of the film, it can be argued that the filmmakers put the Democratic candidate, a very wishy-washy Chuck Robb, in a poor light.  The scene where he was running around a supermarket looking for a hand - any hand - to shake was as hilarious as it was pathetic.  By the end of the film, I thought that Chuck Robb was a nice guy who was willing to say anything to get elected, and North was a creepy demagogue who pressed a lot of populist buttons out on the stump.
I also felt that the filmmakers successfully captured North's ruthless and egocentric campaign manager as he struggled with the campaign and even some of the ""big questions"" of his life.  He was the most fascinating character in the entire film, and I'm glad that the filmmakers paid so much attention to him.  They had this leftie actually ** rooting ** for North's campaign manager by the end of the film.
Although they also are won't to show North and some of the far-right characters who supported him on the campaign trail, the documentary-makers did a fine job of stripping the film of any ideological bias and freely savaging both characters.  Again, a must-see for political junkies, and a worthy view for the rest of the viewing audience.",988761600,20,1670,4.7020547945205475
903481,4,6304634242,"As a veteran of a statewide campaign myself, ""A Perfect Candidate"" brought back a flood of memories from the statewide campaign. Following around the ill-fated Ollie North for Senate campaign, I  was reminded of the tremendous highs & lows one feels during a  campaign. Likewise, the movie has its own highs and lows, tedious and  repetitive at times, smart and quick at others. Perhaps not the best movie  ever made, a fun movie for any political veteran missing the campaign  trail, or any political observer looking for insights into life in the war  room. A warning: this movie is not for all movie-goers. If you don't like  politics, you're not going to like this movie.",954633600,6,675,4.817391304347826
903482,5,6304634242,"""Lesser of two evils"" is the only way to describe this race, and this movie does a great job of showing that. I was living in Fredericksburg, VA in 1994, and the Robb-North fight was fascinating to  watch. Virginia deserved better, but at least we don't have the shame of  sending Ollie to the Senate.",928886400,5,301,4.454545454545454
903483,4,6304634242,"A Perfect Candidate is an entertaining documentary for anyone with the political bug. For those not remotely interested in politics, it may be less interesting. The documentary focuses primarily on the  behind-the-scenes activities of Oliver North's campaign staff, and also  follows a Washington Post reporter as he reports on the campaign.  For  anyone who wonders why Oliver North ever had supporters, or why he lost  despite having some very committed supporters, this movie should answer  most of your questions.",911347200,5,517,5.481012658227848
7875078,5,6304634242,"This is a great doc film covering the 1994 Virgina senate race,between Chuck Robb(D) and Oliver North(R).I enjoyed this,but I thought it was a little bit biased. I thought the filmmakers were trying to make North out to be more of the enemy,than compared to Chuck Robb. Going more for the Iran contra issue,than all of the corruption that was hiding in Chuck Robb's closet. I also thought the ""Hey Hey Hey Goodbye"" tune toward North at the end of Robb's victory,was a jab at us conservatives,to gloat in their victory. Obviously,all of this showing that the left,had some kind of involvment with the making of this film. Although,I would wished for a different outcome and seen North win the senate seat,I still enjoy this movie. I highly recommend this,to both conservative and liberal viewers.",1355616000,,795,4.896296296296296
7875079,2,6304634242,"This film sounded interesting but my training as a historian prompted me to investigate the authors of the film.  Cutler and Taylor have made careers out of agenda driven reality shows.  Left-wing agendas...  It doesn't matter that the topic was Oliver North, George Bush, or the so-called religious right the mission was to impugn the reputation of those being filmed.  This was different when Cutler made his famous ""The War Room"" and the new war room movie.  The left was made to look to look competent and honorable though now we know some of the cheats pulled by the 1992 Clinton campaign.  They never appeared or were hinted at by Cutler.  So watch this movies with your eyes wide open and your skeptic program running full speed.",1248220800,3,736,4.748031496062992

7875082,5,6304634242,"As a prof, I sometimes need a break from lecturing. It's true, I don't always like to hear myself talk. When this happens I like to show a movie about American politics. This is one of the ones, usually a way to cover campaigns and campaign strategy. It does a great job of informing students about what these topics are by showing vibrant examples of both. My only complaint is that the movie is getting a little long in the tooth. Most of my freshmen were born after Iran-Contra, so they just don't bring the knowledge to make this movie great. It's just before their time. If you have nontraditional students, they can help get the others up to speed and make the experience great. Anyway, a great flick for class, and break for the prof. If you need a ""younger"" movie, try see how they run.",1180569600,,794,4.408163265306122
7875083,4,6304634242,I actually thought A Perfect Candidate was pretty good. I've been a huge fan of Oliver North since 1994 when he ran for U.S. Senate. I recommend A Perfect Candidate to anyone on the right or the left who is interested in politics.,1172016000,,230,4.372093023255814
7875084,5,6304634242,"Isn't it interesting how little things have changed: the right kowtowing to the religious, stooping for votes. The pathetic sight of candidates trying to keep fake smiles etched on their faces for fear of showing an ounce of humanity. While the GOP can go straight to hell as far as I'm concerned, this fascinating doc doesn't exactly paint Dems as all the better. It shows how desperate people can get to achieve their goals (walking in grocery store aisles pretending to be friendly). You watch this and begin to understand why no one who could truly benefit society won't participate in the electoral process. You have to pander and be a fraud for the most part.",1142899200,2,665,4.741379310344827
7875085,4,6304634242,"An obvious comparison can be made between this film and Journeys with George.  While the latter is more entertaining (Bush makes a much better movie star than North), this film is brutally honest in how it portrays politics in America.  With that in mind, A Perfect Candidate is the better choice if you're looking for more than entertainment.

Like all good documentaries, this film doesn't come across as having an agenda.  If there was an underlying agenda, it doesn't come through.  The film allows you to be a fly on the wall during this campaign and I was truly amazed at what North's campaign team did and said in front of the cameras.  They came across as making no effort to hide any of the bad or cynical things they did or said.  At several points in the film you'll find yourself rewinding just to make sure you heard these guys right.

I don't think this film would appeal to casual observers of politics the way that Journeys with George would, but anyone that follows politics seriously will enjoy this film, regardless of your partisan or ideological leanings.",1135814400,4,1076,4.6861702127659575
7875086,3,6304634242,"A Perfect Candidate is an interesting and thought provoking documentary on the Senate race between Republican Oliver North (of Iran Contra fame) and scandal tarred incumbent Deomcrat Chuck Robb.

The movie tries to make the case that no matter what your positions are on the issues it is better to vote for someone who is a idealogue than a moderate. It demeans the very notion of someone who may be conservative on some issues and liberal on others. Before that it is a celebration of Oliver North because of his perfect conservatism. When North starts to make mistakes and Robb starts tearing into him the movie becomes more interesting because the filmmakers obviously never thought Robb could win re-election.

The great thing about this documentary is all of the scenes with Douglas Wilder. He was the first black governor of Virginia and ran as an independant in the Senate race for a while. The racial issues explored is the main reason why this is worth getting.",1127001600,,970,4.837349397590361
7875087,5,6304634242,"This is a refreshingly crisp look inside a major statewide campaign.  Robb (D) had major support from his national party and still struggles to win, while North (R) was really abandonded by his national party and yet still comes close to a victory. The movie really exposes how much major media bias and closed door armtwisting can alter a campaign outcome.  The viewer begins to wonder by the end movie if North might have won had he hired a more professional campaign manager?  The major support clearly given to Robb's campaign by the White House seems to go unanticipated and unnoticed by North's campaign.  This movie also highlights the Republican attitude of constantly underestimating and misunderstanding the left's continual and abhorent use of the race card to win elections.  Most Republicans (including this one) see all citizens as Americans -- not by race.  Democrats  prove they can only win by dividing and this is a great example of how their strategy worked (with a little help from the Clinton White House).

Captivating Movie.  A must see for all budding politicians.",1126742400,2,1088,5.0
