it has more energetic and dancing songs than praise baby collection i own. i hold my baby upright and wiggle her as she laughs.

I sing too like a prayer. my daughter goos and i thank God for her with a singing heart.

note: im a stay-at-home mom so i review when my baby likes something. im typing while holding her.",1266105600,2,886,6.954954954954955
