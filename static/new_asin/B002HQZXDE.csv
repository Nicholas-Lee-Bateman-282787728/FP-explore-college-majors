8427797,4,B002HQZXDE,"i watched this movie once before online and it was broken and pieces were missing so i didn't get the full movie.but then i had a chance to watch it again and it was actually a really decent film in asian horror. i was pleased with the plot of the 5 young campers going off into the woods,which seems innocent enough until night time comes and they begin to disappear one by one...the acting wasn't as bad as i thought it would be and the deaths were gruesome enough with the decapitation to the groin stabbing of one of the girl's in the group by her now walking dead trance.soh yi-hyun did what i thought was a good job to play the main girl.i love asian horror and i will be adding this one to my collection...what can i say i liked it!",1277078400,2,739,4.174825174825175
8427798,3,B002HQZXDE,"It seems like they are really scrapping the bottom of the barrel with Asian horror films lately, releasing amateur works that look like they were shot with a borrowed video camera and friends for actors (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ghost-Gate/dp/B000QCU9GW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ghost Gate</a>&nbsp;anyone?) and they all seem to be part of some ""Horror Series"" of bad flicks.  So it was with some trepidation that I approached ""Dark Forest of Death"" (""Jugeum-Ui Sup""), the first in a four-series ""K-Horror Collection.""

Imagine my surprise that this is actually a decent little film!  With a nice, moody orchestral soundtrack, decent special effects and solid production values, ""Dark Forest of Death"" was an enjoyable ninety-eight minutes.

The ""K-Horror"" series was produced by Ahn Byung Ki (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Phone/dp/B000FVQYW2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Phone</a>) in order to bring some life and new blood to Korea's horror film genre.  Each story is done by a different director adapting the short story works of writer Yoo Il Han, and concentrates on a different subtext of the horror genre.

""Dark Forest of Death,"" directed by first-time director Kim Jong-Min, takes on the haunted forest motif.  Four campers head into the mountains to a remote location, where they are away from cell phone service and all contact with civilization.  One of the girl's starts to have psychic predictions of a terrible fate, but of course no one pays her much heed.  Until the car breaks down and night falls, and the group realizes her visions may be more than just fantasy.

The plot is not the strong point of ""Dark Forest of Death,"" and there are some twists and turns that just don't make a whole lot of sense.  However, Korean-drama actress So Yi Hyun, making her first film appearance, was pretty enough that I didn't worry about the story too much.  There are also just some great scenes in the film, like when a man's head is cut in half with a shovel just like digging a hole.  Nice and slow.

All in all, I can't say that ""Dark Forest of Death"" was a great film, but it was definitely worth watching.  It is a B-movie, but more of a B+.  If you come to it with the right expectations you will have a good time.",1256515200,,2314,5.196765498652291
8427799,1,B002HQZXDE,"This was by far the worst Asian Horror movie I have ever seen. This movie made no sense. Five hikers go into the forest and if you get cut in anyway the forest comes to life and kills you. Then you come back as a zombie and try to kill the rest of your friends. If you love Asian horror stay away from this movie. I found it very hard to watch and as the movie progresses it gets worse and worse. The storyline is pathetic,the acting is pathetic and the money you waste on this movie will be pathetic. Stay away,you have been warned.",1252281600,,533,4.085714285714285
