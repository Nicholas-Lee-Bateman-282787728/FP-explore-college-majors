Little did I know that the first call would lead to so many call from all over the world showing love and support to all the couples who simply wanted to show love and support of the same sex couples getting married in San Francisco. I was lucky to receive a call from Peter Daulton soon after who asked if he could follow me to city hall and film a documentary. Peter turned out to be a great guy and his wife Catherine Craig was and is another great person. Peter and I have kept in touch and we developed a bond of great friendship and respect during the filming. Little did I know how the film would turn out but Peter did a lovely job with the utmost respect to all those involved. To have been included in this documentary and this part of history is one of the highlights of my life. I encourage people to watch the film. It's sweet,and very touching .",1435708800,,1035,4.18

8048260,5,B0007LGJ4S,"As a filmmaker (Freedom To Marry), I appreciated Flowers from the Heartland, for its clarity, sincerity and honesty.  In February, 2004, thousands of same-sex couples rushed to San Francisco hoping to marry before an injunction was passed that would put an end to this momentous opportunity.  Peter Daulton's documentary took me into intimate moments of unconditional love between empathetic strangers who sent flowers to same-sex couples who were marrying without the chance to plan their wedding or invite family and friends to share their joy.  These fleeting moments captured on film were profound and unforgettable.  Flowers from the Heartland reminded me of the beauty that comes from giving - simply giving because it feels like the right thing to do and the joy same-sex couples experienced by being given a surprise bouquet and congratulations from people they'd never met - totally strangers who really cared.  Two thumbs WAY UP!!!  I recommend you buy this film and share it with family, friends, neighbors and co-workers.",1127174400,,1033,5.2682926829268295
