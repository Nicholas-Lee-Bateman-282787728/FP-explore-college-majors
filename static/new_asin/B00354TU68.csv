4069909,5,B00354TU68,"At first when I saw this on the History Channel, I was skeptical. But as I watched it further I came away impressed by it. In that this series showed some of the ""Great"" Men and Woman to be some really nasty folks. I was also impressed by looking at them from a Psychological manner that addressed on how they became the monsters that they became. All in all this DVD is well worth the time & coin in my humble opinion.",1294444800,,419,4.121951219512195

8 Episodes on 2 Discs (2010)

""Ancients Behaving Badly"" are documentary-style episodes from the History Channel about eight of the most brutal and feared leaders of the ancient world: Caligula, Attila the Hun, Julius Caesar, Alexander the Great, Cleopatra, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, and Nero. They cover the latest historical finds to support or disprove claims made about each of these leaders and the treatment of their subjects, their battlefield strategy, and how they achieved and maintained their power. Interviews are taken with experts and are combined with on-location footage and some illustrated CGI reenactments.

There is a scale used to judge the bad behavior at the end of each episode comparing a range of Psychopathic Killer to Goal-Driven Character. It also dictates how they rate with Narcissistic Personality Disorder to get terrifying historical personalities. Certain acts indicate a logical approach and keen insight and other acts apparently diagnose a psychosis. The experts interviewed are historians and also occasionally scientists or other experts. They work to figure out what things like what type of poison Nero may have used on his stepbrother and if it was possible for Nero to rig a canopy to fall on his mother to crush her while she sailed on her boat.

The historians like to compare the ""ancients"" to more modern historic figures like Hitler, Mussolini, etc. One historian calls Caligula ""Freddy Krueger in a toga."" Attila the Hun ""makes Hannibal Lector look like Mother Teresa.""

It is a very interesting and eye-opening show that takes rumors and stories you may vaguely remember for a textbook and get to the bottom of them in all their naughty glory. For example, a rumor about the appearance of Attila's Huns was proven by finding deformed skulls made from wrapping children's heads with bandages tightly at a young age to make them protrude more like a conehead than a regular human skull. Attila is said to have fed his barbarians raw uncooked meat warmed on horseback so some men test this and find out it is not indigestible due to the tenderizing that takes place in the constant motion of horseback riding.

After an intense debate about whether or not Julius Caesar had an STD and if so, what kind, the experts eventually diagnose him with Chlamydia. Some of these ancient figures' histories were kept hidden for years in the public interest of trying to forget about them, just to be resurrected by later leaders to make themselves look better by comparison. One thing is for sure, there was no shortage of drama or limit to the deceit these ancients could engage in.

Like the recently reviewed ""Hoarders"" season on A&E, for some reason, this DVD set does not have a ""Play All"" function on the front menu. When you select an ancient, say Julius Caesar, it takes you to a scene selection list with a ""Play All"" function as if you wouldn't want to automatically see the episode. A minor complaint but an annoying one!

If you're a history buff and like to get all the dirty gossip, this series is for you. It goes beyond textbook and is pretty interesting. I'll admit, the first episode made me fall asleep, but all the rest stood up to the caffeine test so if you're dying to know more about Alexander the Great, Attila the Hun, Julius Caesar, Caligula, Cleopatra, Hannibal, Genghis Khan, or Nero, check it out.

4069918,1,B00354TU68,"Once again, the ""HISTORY"" channel, I use the term loosely, tries to put out an educational program of some of the greatest minds of the ancient world.  Too bad it shows like a ""Real housewives"" program with high drama and useless commentary.  Why are we looking at the ancient world through a modern day lens???  To do this is to ""dumb down"" some great history.  Of course the Romans were wild and ""debauched"", that is how it was back then!!  That was the norm, there were no sins, morals, or ""take the high road"", it was a matter of survival of the fittest.  How can you say anything bad about Alexander the great, whose military campaigns are still studied today??  One commentator called him a ""boogeyman"", really??  Same with Caesar, who is still considered one of the greatest military generals who walked the earth.  Every one of these ancients had huge contributions to their societies and changed the world as we know it today.  Oh, did you know Cleopatra married her brother?  Duh, it was ancient Egypt, that was how they believed they kept their bloodlines pure, and had done so for the last 2500 years.  This program tries to stamp a modern slant which doesn't work.  History channel needs to go back to making better historical programs, not historical fiction and save the drama for the Bravo network.",1406505600,2,1314,4.685589519650655
4069919,5,B00354TU68,"Ancients Behaving Badlyis everything all about the ones featured, from Caligula to Hannibal. They show graphic cartoony pictures, but they serve a great importance in the understanding of that historic person. Also, they really use many scientific tests to prove of their wrong beings, such as how Nero pulled off the murder of his step-brother Britannicus.  Lastly, they use the help of a forensic phycologist to analyze their demonic ways.",1396224000,2,441,5.3
4069920,4,B00354TU68,"I found Ancients Behaving Badly an entertaining look at a handful of ancient monarchs and leaders, such as Cleopatra, Genghis Khan, Caesar, and Hannibal. Combining commentary from some of my favorite historians and archeologists with nifty animation, the series hinged around the difference between being anti-social and violent, but otherwise constructive, and simply being a monster. So far, so good, and frankly it is one of the better modern offerings from The History Channel, which seems to have degenerated into being about anything but history.

For me, where the series really passed it is that it managed to engage my nephews. I bought the DVD as a present for them, thinking that the animated bits would help them engage with the useful, educational subject matter. BINGO! They liked the series so much they watched episodes without me. Mission accomplished!",1392508800,2,869,5.251798561151079
4069921,5,B00354TU68,"Is there ever justification for such brutality?  According to this series, yes there is as long as you can get away with it.  Fortunately for the world, most of these tyrants died young.  The 2 most notorious, Caesar and Khan, cast such long shadows in history because they had long bloody lives.  I know others seemed more deviant but these 2 killed millions, annihilated entire nations, and no one cared.

4069923,1,B00354TU68,"I will just summarise a few things that i didn't like about ""Ancients Behaving Badly"".

1. very dumbed down content which will show an ancient site..and then switch the camera to maybe some scientists dressed up in white coats viewing DNA in a labratory at some university or research center in the USA? or might show a cartoon getting his head chopped off..or might show an ""Expert"" talking very excitedly ,like a used car salesman, about some topic,,etc. (all in 3 minutes)..so you are feeling kind of irritated they ever turned the camera away from the ancient site during that 3 minutes of time.? The problem is this continues on throughout and feels like you are on a roller coaster for people with ADHD.

2. Cartoons or ""Anime""? are used throughout the documentary. I didn't want to watch a documentary that seemed to be co-produced by ""the Cartoon Channel""

3. American Foot ball players in a foot ball stadium are used in one segment to dress up as gladiators..(one example of ""Very dumbed down content"")

4. An old van is used as target practice of an ancient weapon...kind of not what i was hoping for with such a nice cover for this documentary. (another example of ""dumbed down content"".)

5. Ironically, an extremely narcissistic seeming ""psychiatry expert""..from "" The University of Maryland""..who seems to be one of the main ""hosts"" for this documentary (I really did not like this aspect of this documentary) discusses and rates each of the ""ancient conquerors"" as being either (forget exactly the titles..but something similar to as follows)..1. ""Psychotic ruler""..2. ""Narcissistic ruler"".. or a 3. ""A Goal driven Ruler"".. (maybe had a few other titles too..but...what right this ""psychiatry"" expert had to judge men from such a far away time ,,i don't know. It is not really what i consider ""scholarship"" and just seems to maybe have an ulterior motive? ..(i am not sure reason why this was included). Maybe to help sell pscyhotic medications for drug companies? help promote this field of ""psychiatric"" health"" at ""The University of Maryland "" or other universities? I am not sure. Besides that,, the producers could have at least picked someone who was not as seemingly as distasteful as this narrator's personality seemed to be like.",1345680000,5,2254,4.9523809523809526
4069924,3,B00354TU68,"Not a bad show overall. Some interesting facts in it, also a lot of speculation - with that said, I still enjoyed every episode.",1341878400,2,128,4.375
4069925,5,B00354TU68,"ANCIENTS BEHAVING BADLY...

The following is a 2 disc DVD that will cover:

1. Alexander The Great
2. Atila the Hun
3. Julius Caesar
4. Caligula
5. Cleopatra
6. Hannibal
7. Genghis Khan
8. Nero

Each episode corresponds to each of these leaders. You will get a small biography, with their beginnings, as well as important moments for them. They will talk about how they ruled the world, and what they did to reach that status; most of them did it at any price, even if it meant getting rid of their own blood.

The team that works on this documentary traveled to each location when studying each leader. One of the greatest things is how they challenge what is described in books corresponding to the time of each leader. For example when it is known to us by sources that such leader destroyed walls in such a matter, today, with their technology they put it to the test to see if such comment was true or fictional. This is awesome! You will be surprised.

I honestly don't know how some people could rate this documentary so low; I have seen so many of them and, in general, I would have to say that almost always these documentaries do not dissapoint.

I hope you do give it a try and see for yourself... you don't know what you're missing. Believe it!",1337385600,10,1256,4.415584415584416
4069926,1,B00354TU68,"The History Channel has obviously decided they can acquire a wider audience by resorting to puerile pandering and that's a shame. Any commentary made about the individuals in this DVD is reported as factual, no matter how specious the source. Hannibal's segment is a perfect example. The fear and hatred the Romans felt for Hannibal caused him to be characterized as a bloodthirsty monster by the citizens. Plays were performed exaggerating the most vicious aspects of his campaigns and inventing out of thin air all manner of atrocities. Roman parents used the spectre of Hannibal as a kind of boogeyman to frighten unruly children. Of course, the makers of this DVD portray the words of Hannibal's most implacable enemies as indisputable fact. If you must watch this unabashed sophistry, you should balance things out by doing further research on the individuals being portrayed.",1329868800,4,881,5.1678321678321675
4069927,1,B00354TU68,"After watching this series I want those hours back. Most of the narrative seemed juvenile and overly dramatic for no good reason. I expected a bit better from the History Channel. After watching this series I just lost a lot of respect for basically everyone involved. How they even developed this Behaving Badly ""scale"" to rank these historical figures I'll never know. You might as well just pick one of these labels out of a hat and be done with it.

The most appalling part was where they referenced that these figures learned these exact behavior from the cradle and yet they are labeled as psychopaths, etc. Psychology is not an exact science especially if you're doing a profile of a person from centuries ago based on secondary, tertiary or more references. I dislike the definitive nature of these labels.

We aren't suppose to compare their values in their times to our own accepted norms of this era. We see it as an atrocity, yes but we have to keep in mind that it was the behavior during war or struggle for the throne, etc. Especially since rulers in that age did not last very long and then repeat with the next successor. It doesn't make it right but we have to take a step back and view it objectively, which is something this documentary does not do very well.

 Even the history we think we know may be misleading as many of the surviving accounts were written hundreds of years after the fact. So we may never know but if you like disgusting tabloid style entertainment then this is the video for you.
