4213000,5,B003W4GDN4,"""UFOs in South America"" is a DVD brought to us by UFOTV. The first episode, which deals mostly with Ecuador and Brazil, is available free on Youtube. The second part about Mexico and Mayan prophecies is only available on this DVD, so unfortunately I haven't seen it. This review is therefore based on the first part only.

I admit I was fascinated by UFOTV:s magnum opus ""Out of the Blue"". ""UFOs in South America"" is built around the same concept: military personnel and other respectable people talk about their UFO encounters (occasionally spectacular ones), and it turns out that government authorities habitually classify UFO observations and even videos of purported UFOs sent in by the public.

In Ecuador, investigate reporter Jaime Rodriguez waged a sustained battle to get his government to declassify UFO reports. His dream finally came true when President Rafael Correa appointed an official UFO investigation, giving Rodriguez full access to previously classified material. A kind of Condon Committee in reverse, since Rodriguez is a ""true believer"" rather than a sceptic - he sounds new agey and believes in Mayan prophecies about a shift in consciousness around 2012. Some kind of political conflicts between Ecuador and the United States are hinted at. President Correa is left-wing and closed down all CIA operations in Ecuador, which coincided with his sudden pro-ufology turn. Interestingly, Rodriguez had also tried to lobby a previous left-wing president, Lucio Gutirrez (who later turned to the right). The documentary hints at an explanation: the demand to classify all UFO reports came from the United States military. With a more nationalist government firmly in place, the secrecy could be broken.

I admit that I'm somewhat ambivalent towards the evidence shown in this documentary. Some of the UFO footage is just too good to be true! Footage, as we know, can be faked - not to mention the staggering amount of ridiculous flying objects humanity sends up into the air every day...  Perhaps it's just me, but somehow I found the oral testimony of the military pilots more convincing. Why would an experienced military pilot lie about being worsted by fast, luminous objects in the sky? The fact that both the US and other governments habitually classify UFO observations is also intriguing. Somehow, that doesn't square with the official scepticism towards the phenomenon...

The most sensational part of ""UFOs in South America"" is about Brazil. The Brazilian military supposedly organized a veritable exploration of the Amazon in search of UFOs. They found lots and lots of them, and even made contact with the aliens, at which point the Brazilian high command ordered the investigation to stop! The problem? This ""Operation Prato"" is still classified, so nobody can talk about it openly...

I'm not sure how to assimilate the Hispanic flying saucer situation, but one thing's for sure. The Condon Committee really is yesterdays news... ;-)",1350777600,,2967,5.196652719665272
4213001,3,B003W4GDN4,"So here I am thinking that the Ecuador government and others have opened up with their ufo files. Ok, maybe they did, but it turns out they don't have a lot of information to share. The bulk of what has been ""released"" is simply videos they have on file sent by the general population. I've seen these kinds of videos many times, and it's not what I hoped to find here. I hoped to find them discuss bodies, communications, technologies, whatever. I hoped they might reveal a ship they might have. But no. Maybe they've opened up, but it seems they just don't have much to hide. The ""drama"" about the US not letting them disclose their ufo information was described and over in about four minutes. It was a mere mention and left many questions to be answered.

The bonus second film, ""Mexico Contact Point"" was a little more interesting. It mentioned how the Mayans predicted the begining of Alien contact and how the plethura of ufo sightings began at the time they said. It also showed different kinds of ufo's that were new to me. Those things were interesting enough.

Footage of ufo's doesn't impress me too much. That's old news. I'm waiting for the bodies, crafts and communications. No such things are presented in this video. The best ufo/alien video I've seen so far is ""Out of the Blue"". If you haven't seen it, I recommend it. Hopefully we'll all have more information in the near future.",1335139200,7,1399,4.592
4213002,5,B003W4GDN4,"This is a Great Product!!  A visual experience with all the fotage on video.  This DVD contains an update of the latest videos (a lot of them I didn't see them before) with good quality, and a lot of explanations (I'm mentioning this because there are DVDs that collect a lot of fotage, but zero explanations about where, when or who made those videos).  I really enjoy it, and I'm really fascinated with this collection of videos, and also with the explanation about how they got filmed.  About the videos from the second part (Mexico's UFOs) I already saw them on film before, but the explanations gave me more clarity on what I already knew about how they got these videos -they focus more in the ""living-like-snake"" UFOs that relase small spheric ones.",1324944000,,756,4.661654135338346
4213003,5,B003W4GDN4,"As an American ex-patriate living in Colombia the last 5 years, this is a great summary of the UFO phenomenon in this part of the world. Case studies are focused on Ecuador and Brazil, with smaller snippets from Peru and Uruguay.

While there are TV / video programs (From History Channel, others) that might focus on - some - of these countries more in-depth, this production brings it all together succintly as a regional summary. The Ecuadorean material I have not seen in any other program (While I have seen a lot of UFO related video, haven't seen it all)

Stories relate to recent revelations / declassifying (From 2007+ - Ecuador) of older material. Though more recent video (2007+) is also shown.

We tend to accept more readily things we are able to identify with, so I would recommend this to/for anyone from the South American region who might have an interest in UFOs. Hint - you can find this online for free from the publisher!",1322438400,13,942,4.662650602409639
4213004,5,B003W4GDN4,"This is a fascinating documentary about the many UFOs that seem to be filling up the skies over South America.  Many are familiar with the spheres that have been filmed over Mexico during the last 20 years or so, but few are familiar with the incredible array of obvious craft seen and filmed by the different military forces of these countries, and how seriously the governments of these countries take the matter.

Beyond the startling footage, most of it new to American eyes, is the analysis of just how the Ecuadorian government had to purge its intelligence apparatus of the `corruption' by American intelligence agencies.  They had been effectively owned by the American intelligence community for many years, and had actually worked to prevent the release of UFO-related information.  The Ecuadorian President spent several years to clean that up, having to purge the Ecuadorian intelligence leadership, demanding that those Americans who had been involved were expelled from the country through diplomatic channels, and the granting of permission by the President for military personnel to come forward to civilian investigators.

Other than the astoundingly clear footage of UFOs is a new  (to Americans) aerial phenomenon of what appears to be some kind of biological `craft' that have been filmed expelling white spherical objects into the Latin skies.  These seem to be proliferating, and are readily seen and filmed by all kinds of people.  The documentary also sheds light on the many dedicated investigators (including one tenacious person who, due to physical debilitations, films from one small window in his apartment and gets amazing footage) who have been tireless in their pursuit of the truth.

This is a professionally produced documentary, with high quality production values, a no-nonsense approach to the subject and not a hint of derision.  For those interested in this enigma, this is a must-have DVD.",1320624000,17,1930,5.257328990228013
4213005,5,B003W4GDN4,"I feel like I got my money's worth when I viewed this DVD. It was well edited and has great footage that is quite compelling. If you are like me, very interested in the subject matter, you will find this video quite thought provoking and downright entertaining. As a UFObe, I keep track, via the internet, of UFO events on our beloved planet EARTH but this video actually had events that I was not aware of and surprised me. This is one vid that I am keeping, at least for a few years. To review and think about.",1300060800,23,512,4.23469387755102

Here's a clue: Ecuador is the ""meat"" in a Columbia-Peru sandwich. Now are we on the same page? Don't get me wrong, I love bananas and I am a certified UFO weird-o... But Ecuador? Ok, there is some other stuff on here; some of it quite fascinating. Like the 10 second cell-phone video from Costa Rica (which can be seen on YouTube for free). Mostly, there are ""flotillas"" of little translucent metallic spheres which are decidedly NOT balloons, but they might as well be. A man with Lou Gherig's Disease is Mexico's most successful UFO videographer--Who knew? At least you can be sure that none of this is fake because WHO WOULD EVEN BOTHER? There is a second disc with more of the same. Oh! ""Something huge"" did happen in Brazil in 1977 involving the Military and an enormous cover-up. Unfortunately, the people involved are still bound by secrecy laws--Too bad.",1416182400,,986,4.738372093023256
