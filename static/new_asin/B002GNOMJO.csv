3924947,3,B002GNOMJO,"Synopsis: Three women differing in age, race and gender preference find themselves sharing time and space in a steam bath at a local gym. They are: Doris (Ruby Dee) a 60 plus black woman trying to come to grips with the recent death of her husband, Laurie (Ally Sheedy) a 42 year old divorcee and Mother wondering if love and romance has passed her by and Elizabeth (Kate Siegel) passive but rebellious college student fighting to break free from her parents and Catholic upbringing to embrace a lifestyle of her own choosing. As you might expect, as their individual stories unfold and are shared within the confines of the steam bath they discover that maybe they aren't so different after all.

The 2008 movie 'Steam' is a watchable though overall unoriginal chick flick containing the necessary elements expected in this genre of film. The older, experienced wise woman to point the way, the 40 something, attractive but aging divorcee attempting to rediscover her inner beauty and start again and the young, inexperienced girl awakening to an unexpected sexuality that challenges the beliefs of family and faith. The usual grist for the mill. If you fit into one of the three categories mentioned you'll most likely enjoy the film. Otherwise I'm no so sure.",1256083200,2,1262,4.924882629107981
3924948,5,B002GNOMJO,"I absolutely loved this movie. The variety in couples, actors and actresses made it very appealing, and the storylines were very entertaining. I laughed a lot during this movie, and am highly recommending to friends and family.",1252281600,12,227,5.162162162162162
3924949,5,B002GNOMJO,"Such a beautiful movie is all I can say! You have to check this movie out.  It details 3 different relationships and one just so happens to be a new-lesbian/bisexual female encounter.  Very touching and on point with reality and the trials and tribulations in life and relationships, regardless of the dynamics.",1403568000,,311,4.961538461538462

3924951,2,B002GNOMJO,"Not very good acting, not interested to watch entire episode. I am not interested in offering personal opinion. Too much work.
Please do not request reviewa in the future????",1400457600,,174,5.0344827586206895
3924952,5,B002GNOMJO,"I loved the movie! It had a great theme overall, great acting! Ruby Dee as always is excellent, so authentic!",1398729600,,109,4.5
3924953,5,B002GNOMJO,"i enjoyed this movie. There were 3 women.  the oldest lost her husband of many years. met a man and brought happiness back into her life. middle age women meet a younger man.. he too changes her life for the better and the youngest woman .. college age.. come out and hads to come to terms with herself but more to her parents who are devote baptist and controlling.  All 3 women met at a gym in a steam room and tell their story... the steam room is ..  as you watch it.. you find out whats the meaning of the steam room and what brings them together.

one of these ladies said to  her man  as she crying ""You brought back color into my life, Thank you""  it was very moving.

it had a very good ending.",1397865600,,703,4.043478260869565
3924954,4,B002GNOMJO,"Three women one in each category who play their parts well! It's a bit slow in the beginning as the film builds our interest in the main characters. Once there we can start to appreciate the humor in this story, but also the serious issues that challenge so many of us in everyday life and love! Stick with it and you will be happy you did!",1397779200,,340,4.166666666666667
3924955,4,B002GNOMJO,"Although this movie isn't for the woman looking to find a good lesbian tale, it's a good story. Especially, from the older woman's perspective. Honestly, I was searching Amazon for a dirty lesbian tale because I'm a lesbian and that's what I was looking to watch. lol I ended up watching a story about three different woman in three different stages and situations in their lives. I was touched and even teared up to the elderly woman's story. As for the ""lesbian"" I don't want to ruin the movie but the chick always ends up bi... you know what I mean. ;) I give this movie four stars because it had a good story with the elderly woman, enough so that I even teared up, that's saying a lot! If you're looking to see lesbians, look else where but if you're looking to hear out the stories of woman that have gone through so much, give it a shot.",1395878400,,844,4.314465408805032
3924956,1,B002GNOMJO,"God, I hope this moron gives up filmmaking. I saw him at a festival one time- such a blowhard. The acting is alright, the writing sucks, and the director only thinks he's a director.",1395273600,,182,4.382352941176471
3924957,4,B002GNOMJO,This was a wonderful drama about the lives of three women who met in a steam room at a health club.  Their triumps over lonliness and their strength in achieving happiness.  Highly recommend.,1395187200,,191,4.757575757575758
3924958,3,B002GNOMJO,"Some of the acting was a bit sub par, and two of the ladies' personal stories just weren't that interesting.  I did really enjoy the story of Ruby Dee's character, though.  I also thought it was a bit strange that these three ladies never even introduced themselves or even hinted at what their personal issues were.  This being said, what was the point of the steam room scenes.  The title seems to indicate that the steam room meetings would have some significance, but there really is none.  The movie was entertaining though - just not the highest quality movie.  It was free though, so I really can't be upset about it.",1393372800,,624,4.576576576576577
3924959,5,B002GNOMJO,This movie was surprisingly very good. I wasn't expecting it to be good because I never heard much about it but it was emotional and the story line was very good.,1392163200,,162,4.258064516129032
3924960,2,B002GNOMJO,"Three women meet in a steam room and share their stories...it is nether compelling nor interesting. Find another movie- The Hours, perhaps.",1391731200,,139,5.363636363636363
3924961,1,B002GNOMJO,I don't care for stories that have a homosexual couple as a main part of the plot and that appears where this is headed. Just not for me.,1390867200,,137,3.9285714285714284
3924962,3,B002GNOMJO,Ruby Dee is absolutely adorable!  A very good movie that adults of all ages could easily enjoy.  I actually would give it 3 1/2 stars.,1390262400,,134,4.32
3924963,5,B002GNOMJO,"Knowing the director and where the movie took place - I'm sure gives me an advantage.  However, I went to premiere or Steam in MD and adored it!  Ally Sheedy has played in numerous films I highly enjoyed such as High Art.  Steam was uplifting, enlightening, and charming.  I highly recommend it!",1389916800,,295,4.615384615384615
3924964,3,B002GNOMJO,"I thought the subject matter was good, but the acting was lacking.  It did keep my attention though.  Real world events.",1389657600,,120,4.666666666666667
3924965,4,B002GNOMJO,"Characters were relative and interesting.  I would recommend it to others.  (I just hate tear-jerkers, but again, I cry watching puppy commercials.)",1389398400,,148,5.681818181818182
3924966,5,B002GNOMJO,I very seldom write a review. But I thought this movie was great. Made me smile and laugh and cry. Just a simple movie about life and 3 ladies at different stages in it. Absolutely great!!!,1388620800,,189,4.277777777777778
3924967,5,B002GNOMJO,"Each story took me or a friend to a place where we could have been..
This is taken from a lesbian who is tired of seeing b****** and unrealistic stories/films made by people who don't know and who are only trying to make a buck.",1386460800,,228,4.088888888888889
3924968,4,B002GNOMJO,"Different lives and ages but the same human reactions to experiences.  I don't know the other actresses, however, Ruby Dee is an American icon.",1385683200,,143,4.958333333333333
3924969,3,B002GNOMJO,"Enjoyed the concept of the steam room as the place of commonality between the women as they silently shared their common ""relationship struggles""",1385164800,,145,5.3478260869565215

3924972,5,B002GNOMJO,I loved it. I rented it because Reshma Shetty  was in it. I love this Woman and would watch anything she is in.,1377907200,,111,3.8260869565217392

3924974,5,B002GNOMJO,this was one to the best movie I have ever seen in a while and Ruby D p;lays her part well.,1355788800,,91,3.380952380952381
3924975,4,B002GNOMJO,"Glad I bought this one. It had quality in both story and acting. It was provocative, sad, tender, and actually uplifting. Three very different women all find themselves through new loves in life. Even though those loves do not endure, they are meaningful and help bring each woman to a new beginning in their lives. The steam room was an interesting focal point, evoking laughter, sadness, caring, etc. - used to set the mood of each next scene.",1317340800,5,445,4.717948717948718
3924976,5,B002GNOMJO,"This a great little relaxing movie about falling in love of
all gnerations and genders of love.

I especially love Ruby Dee love story.  Nice to touch base on
senior citizens falling in love.  There is also a lesbian love affair.

If you like love stories and falling in love you will love this
movie so head on down to the steam room and relax.",1315785600,3,345,4.2615384615384615
3924977,1,B002GNOMJO,"I'll confess first that I couldn't finish this movie.  There are three story lines -- one with each of the leading female characters.  The college student is caught between her nasty totalitarian parents with their rigid expectations of her and a nasty totalitarian lesbian with rigid expectations of her. Some choice!  We, of course, are supposed to take the lesbian's side -- after all her cause is sooo politically correct.  The overall impression I get, however, is that neither her parent's nor the lesbian give a damn about her.  Sad.

The old woman is accosted by a group from her church who try to intimidate her into coming back to church.  Then she is picked up - in a very nasty way - by a man at the grocery store.  She has him over for dinner.  Throughout dinner he is pushy and manipulative.

The third woman is seduced by her son's coach (not that she's not interested).  It is hard to figure out whether the son's coach is more like some sort of religious fundamentalist or someone likely to be sexually assaultive.  There follows a torrid affair.

There is little humanity in this movie, and much petty nastiness.  Nauseating.",1271116800,4,1143,4.678391959798995
3924978,1,B002GNOMJO,"This movie is 3 short stories in one, with scenes from a steam room used as the story dividers.  The first story regarding the older widowed woman is my favorite story of the 3.  It is heartwarming, touching, and the only story which I could relate to. The second story involves a single divorced woman with no job, no self esteem, and a mentally abusive ex-husband.  This story made no impact upon me as the actors/actresses were sloppy and their dialogue was juvenile.  The third story involves a 20-something college student who is trying to break free from her parents as well as enter her first lesbian relationship.  The actors who portrayed her parents were so awful, and their lines so scripted, that they were a joke.  In every scene that the parents were in, I didn't listen to the dialogue because I was distracted by the dad's robotic voice.

I originally was going to give the movie no stars, but decided to give 1 star because of Ruby Dee's performance.",1258675200,7,967,4.619883040935672
8369842,4,B002GNOMJO,"The Seller was very professional and shipped my purchase quickly. The movie wasn't horrible, but it also wasn't a film with a big ""wow factor""... however, I don't regret purchasing it because 1) it was cheap, and 2) it's now become another 1 of many lgbt inspired films in my extensive collection, so for those reasons alone I'd recommend this seller and this movie to anyone that's looking to see a ""nice"" movie with lesbian-interest.",1496361600,,435,4.8133333333333335
