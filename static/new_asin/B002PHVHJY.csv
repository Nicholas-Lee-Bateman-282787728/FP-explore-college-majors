3964558,5,B002PHVHJY,"As much as I like Caroline Quentin (love Blue Murder too), the writers went too far in her spiteful nature. I just watched all of season four on youtube and found them excelent. His new companion, Carla seems to have better interaction with him, than the botched personality of Mady, in later seasons. The mixture of comedy, murder, romance, make for a wonderful TV experience.

3964559,5,B002PHVHJY,"I have 1 thru 3 and loved them all. I wish we would not have to wait so long to see more of this fun and well acted series.
 There is something about Alan Davies that makes him a joy to watch.
 Some people are afraid that Jonathan without Maddie will spoil the series for them. I am not one of those people. She was good, but there were times when her punishment for Jonathan's male ""cluelessness"" bordered on mean.  It was not cute or funny.  Of course, that is how it was written, but it did have the effect of making me dislike her a little.
 As long as there is Alan Davies being Jonathan Creek, I will be buying these and hoping for more.
 Will we ever get a dvd of the specials ?  Hopefully !!!",1258934400,23,700,4.028985507246377
3964560,5,B002PHVHJY,Jonathan Creek is a well acted & presented british production from the BBC.

3964562,4,B002PHVHJY,"Season four of ""Jonathan Creek"" sees a change in the central dynamic of the show. With the departure of Maddy Magellan (Caroline Quentin) for America, Jonathan is teamed up with television presenter Carla Borrego (Julia Sawahla), first introduced in the Christmas Special&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Satan-s-Chimney/dp/B000T2USME/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Satan's Chimney</a>. Now married to producer Brendan Baxter (Adrian Edmonson), she's rather displeased by Jonathan's reappearance in her life, especially when her husband becomes enamored by his mental acuity. Against their will they're made the presenters of a new crime-show that purports to solve seemingly impossible crimes, with Carla's onscreen persona backed up by Jonathan's puzzle-solving prowess.

The change from Maddy's book-writing to Carla's television-presenting gives writer David Renwick the chance to poke fun at the disingenuous nature of TV broadcasting, touching on everything from dishonest editing to ratings grabs to appealing to the lowest common denominator. Jonathan moves through various stages of disgust at the publicity tactics, gross materialism and general sordidness of the industry, whether he's seeing a hound-dog dressed as Sherlock Holmes, the reenactment of a brutal murder for television, or a bunch of wannabe celebrities wallowing about in a pig-sty for ratings.

But of course, there are still the mysteries! The basis of this entire series has always been the truly mind-bending mysteries that Jonathan has so solve, where people are murdered or artefacts disappear in baffling ways.

""The Coonskin Cap"" involves a serial killer on the loose in London, targeting young women with floral-themed names. Carla and Brendan are eager to milk the situation for all its worth, bringing in Inspector Ted Parnevik for an interview on their new show ""Eyes and Ears"". But when the Inspector's college (and lover) Heather Davis is killed in an empty gym, no one can fathom how the killer managed to escape.

""Angel Hair"" is a somewhat unique episode given that no real crime takes place during its length. Dudley Houseman is a rather dissatisfied husband, married to the beautiful Sally Ellen Oakley, but only attracted to her pop-star persona. An affair is imminent, but things take a turn for the weird when a videotape of his mistress is discovered, apparently the victim of a kidnapping. Yet Dudley can't fathom how she managed to grow her hair back in such a short space of time - though the kidnappers cut it all off in the videotape, he knows that she had a full head of hair when he was with her earlier in the day.

Yeah, the stakes aren't particularly high for this one, but it's a fun little ""lite"" mystery that's backed up with a subplot involving Jonathan dating a woman who seems to be using him as a replacement for her recently-deceased cocker spaniel.

In ""The Tailor's Dummy"" legendary fashion designer Marco Bergman commits suicide by throwing himself out of an upstairs window. At least that's what everyone assumes: his children and niece were eye-witnesses, but Jonathan can't understand why on earth the man would throw his parrot out of the window before taking the leap himself. He thinks it's murder, but is having trouble figuring out how.

""The Seer of the Sands"" has an American business woman arrive on a small coastal town to grieve the loss of her boyfriend Justin Mallory, who recently died in a boating accident. She can't understand why a fax sent from her, declaring that her husband would soon agree to a divorce, could upset her boyfriend so much that he would get drunk and crash his boat. The mystery deepens when a gypsy woman offers to answer five questions from Justin, only to uncover a bottle buried in the sand beneath her that contains the answers she seeks. Jonathan is certain the whole thing is a set-up, but has trouble convincing everyone else.

""The Chequered Box"" is probably the most straightforward case this show has ever had; so much so that it's easy enough to figure out the mystery as it's actually happening. Respected officer Inspector Fell has been caught on camera at a murder scene, wiping fingerprints and sneering at a dead body. He insists that he's innocent, and Jonathan believes him - though it's hard to argue with the evidence.

Finally, ""Gorgon's Wood"" is simultaneously the best and most frustrating episode on this DVD set. That is to say, the first half is one of the most elegant mysteries this show has ever had, dealing with the disappearance of a stone figurine from a small museum. The second half goes off the rails a bit, with the mystery veering off into new territory that involves the unlikely scenario of a lookalike. It's one of my favorites, yet I can't help but wish it had a different resolution.

Although this season is entertaining throughout, it's clear that David Renwick is running low on ideas. The mysteries are still baffling, but there are two things that mark out these episodes from previous ones: a tendency to split the mystery into two distinct puzzles (""The Tailor's Dummy"" for example not only deals with Marco Bergman's suicide, but also a subplot involving a journalist being attacked in her hotel room that's only tangentially related to the main crime), and a sense that the run-time is being padded out with lengthy comedic subplots (as well as Brendan Baxter, Jonathan Creek's boss obnoxious boss Adam Klaus is another comedic foil).

There are also some strange elements that are introduced only to be completely dropped. In one episode Carla finds out that her husband was once married to a man - after initially freaking out, the storyline is dropped and never brought up again. In another, comedian guest-star Bill Bailey returns as terrible magician Lenny Starkiss, who finds himself caught up in a kidnapping ring. This ends on a cliff-hanger with Lenny being carted off by moss-bosses and is never resolved. It's...pretty weird.

So the quality isn't quite as good as in previous seasons, and Maddy is sorely missed. Carla may not be as outrageous as Maddy, but she's also not as lovable (say what you will about Maddy's sometimes b*tchy personality; she still had a social conscious and would write out of a commitment to seeing justice done). Carla is more interested in her career and has a slightly colder personality - of course, there's nothing wrong with either of those things, but she's less fun to watch and her dynamic with Jonathan not as interesting.

After this ""Jonathan Creek"" more or less came to an end: though there were three more Christmas/Easter special and a three-episode season five, the quality dipped dramatically. It's a shame, but I loved ""Jonathan Creek"" while it lasted, and though it went out more with a whimper than a bang, I'm still grateful for the ingenuity and humor of its initial run.",1399680000,,6883,5.091312056737588
3964563,5,B002PHVHJY,"My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed Season 4 of Jonathan Creek. We were used to Jonathan's original partner, and it took us a little while to get comfortable with his new partner, but after watching an episode or two, we were back into the groove again. We loved it! Highly recommended!",1397606400,,283,4.568627450980392
3964564,5,B002PHVHJY,"I like the light tone this series set. Not grim, funny at times, and a mystery to boot. Sorry it ended.",1361318400,,103,3.9523809523809526
3964565,5,B002PHVHJY,"This is another season of rather complex crimes.  A new sidekick, more impossible crimes, more fun. Creeks brain works a little differently than most so he is called upon to figure out how the crimes were accomplished. How is the question in each of the crimes, and he always explains.",1352332800,,285,4.7
3964566,3,B002PHVHJY,"What a way to start,on the product detail Caroline Quention is listed in season 4 which she is not,Amazon should get it's facts straight,might not look so good that someone screwed up. Julia Sawalha is in series 4 plays Carla Borrego and in my mind she was not a good choice,no chemistry at all between her and Alan Davies,her character just does not work,the stories are not as good either ,the best one from this season was taken off and put on the specials dvd,the only reson I give it three stars is Alan Davies as J C still if you like the show you might want to take a look.",1316131200,4,580,4.2342342342342345
3964567,2,B002PHVHJY,"Season 4 simply doesn't live up to the high standards of seasons 1, 2, and 3.  The new female is introduced with insufficient storyline transition from Maddy's character in the earlier seasons. Further, the new female is a boring ditz who doesn't stitch the story elements together. Jonathan's interest in her ""endowments"" doesn't ring true. I miss Maddy's humorous personality defects that made her seem ""real.""  Even without the annoying new blond, this season is a mess. In every episode, small potentially interesting subplots are introduced but never picked up again. It is as though the writers (or editors) had to fill in a few minutes, and did so with random bits that have NOTHING to do with the main or secondary plots.",1284508800,12,729,4.91869918699187
3964568,5,B002PHVHJY,I quite enjoyed the new updated version of JC. I was wondering how the switch was going to be handled with Maddie going...but I thought the transition was good. I like Julia Sawhala and think she compliments Jonathon. The program is more verbally sexualy explicit than the old one and poor old Adam Klaus seems to be getting it in the neck at every turn. The closed room puzzles work as well as they ever did and are always entertaining. I always keep an open mind when series change format or characters but this one has done it quite nicely.,1280793600,,543,4.44
3964569,5,B002PHVHJY,"Like many other reviewers I did not know how I would react to series four without Caroline Quentin. While I did find Maddie to be mean sometimes, she was an original female character and could match wits with Jonathan's genius. I rented this series first to see whether I would like the new partner for Alan Davies. Lo, and behold, here is Lydia (Julia Sawalha) from the 1995 'Pride and Prejudice' all grown up, (although I guess she was 27 when she played Lydia) which is the only other time I've noticed her. Carla, too, has issues with Jonathan, and has a prickly relationship with him - what is that writer's problem with women. She is not as smart as Maddie, which works because Jonathan gives her the clues and she, like us, can't get it at first. But over the first three episodes I was totally hooked by the new venue - a TV show - and the new situations. So I bought the series. I, too, wish they would get this series out faster for those of us in the US. Alan Davies mentions that they are in series 7 and here we are in 4. This is a series like Midsomer Murders<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Midsomer-Murders-Set-13/dp/B001V7YZD4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Midsomer Murders: Set 13</a>&nbsp;where you never tire of the characters. I can watch these over again even when I know the solution because I enjoy the humor just as well. highly recommended.",1268179200,16,1400,4.861924686192468
3964570,4,B002PHVHJY,I had like the first three DVDs in this series and was hesitant to get this one because of the new female lead but it was still very good. Although I do miss Quintin,1267920000,3,165,3.8823529411764706

8376997,3,B002PHVHJY,Great show...just missing the last two minutes of the endings.. Really disappointing as I love the series.

New watcher should be able to imagine the endings...just very disappointing they are missing.,1502496000,,294,5.125
8376998,3,B002PHVHJY,Love Alan Davies...cannot get enough of him on any series. Caroline Quentin is definitely missed though. We didn't get season 5 because we just didn't think the series was up to previous standards,1496707200,,196,4.96969696969697

They were so clever and so fun!  This series didn't slowly fade in its last season, it shown brighter.  In conclusion, in a crazy world, I have found this whole series to be a delightful little vacation from the cares of the world.  I highly recommend it.  Cheers!",1426032000,,437,4.5256410256410255
