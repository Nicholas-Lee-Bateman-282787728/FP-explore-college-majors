8684063,3,B00OL09O3E,"If you look at the illustration on the dvd  box, you'll readily perceive the problem with this movie.  That's actress Julie Harris depicted in the embrace-- a twenty-seven year old stage veteran, playing a twelve-year-old girl.

Harris has fervent supporters (she's a good actress, she was fine in the stage version, I'm sure), but there's no getting around it---in this movie, she was woefully miscast.  In harsh black and white, showing every freckle and blemish, Harris sometimes passes for sixteen, but now and then looks almost forty.  Never does she look as young as the character, and her Peter Pan presence fundamentally alters and distorts the meaning of the novel.  Frankie Addams (played by Harris) is a troubled, sensitive girl, but here she is just a freakish tomboy with a voice that drops into adult tones when she gets emotional... which is all too annoyingly often.

Scenes where Frankie explores the Southern town she inhabits are severely truncated, probably because outside the home setting, Harris' oddness became even more jarringly pronounced.  Focusing so much on the interiors also made the movie very ""stagey"", and since McCullers' book depended much on the sense of place, the movie suffers even more.

The miscasting even extends to other characters.  Ethel Waters plays Berenice, the housekeeper.  But where Berenice in the novel wore an eyepatch over a glass eye, and was a complex middle-aged character, Waters reduces her to a grandmotherly mammy, completely comfortable to 50's moviegoers.

Even Brandon de Wilde, who really shines in a minor role as ""John Henry"", will remind older viewers of ""Froggy"" from the Little Rascals in his wire-rimmed glasses.

If this movie were ever remade, you can be sure that the producers would cast a believably young actress in the key role... one who would look and act like a truly young girl.  One also hopes they would also resist the currently fashionable idea that Frankie's dilemma had to do with lack of acceptance of her sexuality.  Nowhere in the book is there the slightest hint that Frankie was anything but heterosexual.",1433116800,,2102,5.069767441860465
