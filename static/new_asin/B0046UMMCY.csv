8417459,5,B0046UMMCY,"This is indispensable if you want to learn how to integrate boxing type strikes into combatives. There are many reasons not to use these strikes, but McCann will show you when it may be useful and appropriate. As stated before, this is the closest to ""advanced"" techniques McCann gets. This is not about boxing. It is about using boxing striking techniques in close combat self defense. It is excellent and I recommend it highly.",1365552000,3,429,4.8108108108108105

Even though he teaches one of the most popular combatives programs in the U.S., he emphasizes in this DVD that there is no such thing as advanced combatives.  This educational DVD is for anyone who desires to augment their basic combative program with some effective punching techniques.

As someone who has always loved boxing and other punch oriented systems, this 2 disc set is most welcome.  It is important to note that even though Kelly teaches the basic boxing techniques in this DVD,  the focus is still on street combatives, not playing at the sport aspects of punching.  The first disc covers the important basic concepts and reasons to include boxing techniques in your combatives training.  He also explains basic safety equipment, gloves, various striking bags and pads.  He shows how each bag should be employed in training.

The second disc Kelly teaches how to deliver the jab, the cross, the uppercut, the hook and the overhand right.  He also adds elbows, knees and kicks to the mix. He demonstrates how to perform each technique on the bags and how to defend and counter attack.  In my opinion, one of the unique features of this DVD is the numerous combative sequences demonstrated.  These are pure combative sequences with closed fist, elbows, shins, and knees.  He emphasizes that these are only drills and you should create your own scenarios for using the closed fist in combatives.

In conclusion, if you love punching techniques and want to include them in your combative program, you need to get this excellent DVD.  It is worth the price.
