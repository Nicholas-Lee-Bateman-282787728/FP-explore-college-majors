2415979,4,B000BGH2HW,"Originally released as KISS FOR CORLISS, this 1949 coda of Temple's silver screen performances again finds Corliss Archer (Shirley Temple) with a crush on an older man. She secretly confesses to her diary an imagined relationship with wealthy, though frequently married, Kenneth Marquis (David Niven), 20 years her senior. Out of spite for a despised Mr. Archer, attorney for his last wife, Marquis confirms the story after Corliss's parents discover the diary. Wedding plans ensue. This leads to a public scandal and jealous true boyfriend, Dexter Franklin (Darryl Hickman).

It seems the only roles offered to teenage Temple were ones where she nurtured affections for mature men.

The quality of this delightful B+W film is surprisingly poor (fair w/o digital restoration) considering it is the treasured climax of Temple theater.

2415987,5,B000BGH2HW,Fast & reliable packaging! This is Shirley Temple's last movie( wish I could find the one before this one in this series),1418083200,,121,4.545454545454546
2415988,3,B000BGH2HW,"Shirley Temple and David Niven are hilarious in this movie, but the story is kind of weird. It's almost like the producers were thinking, ""What are we going to do with these left over contract actors?"" Oh Well, Shirley Temple and David Niven did their best despite having a terrible script.
Watch it once, but have no need to see it again.",1413849600,,339,4.483870967741935
2415989,4,B000BGH2HW,So many different experiences within this story.  It reveals life in those times.  Enjoyed her acting in the part where she pretends ignorance.,1394668800,,143,5.173913043478261

2415991,5,B000BGH2HW,"Well worth owning for the simple fact it is Shirley Temple's last film; there is also a prequel entitled Kiss and Tell, but I do not think it has ever been released on video.  Light-hearted fare for the whole family!",1388793600,2,216,4.4
2415992,5,B000BGH2HW,Love this movie and so happy I can actually own it! Just wish Dexter had the same actor instead of the guy who played the best friend's kid brother from the first one. lol,1386460800,,171,4.0588235294117645
2415993,3,B000BGH2HW,It is not the best Shirley Temple movie. It is not at all what I expected. I had ordered it because I love her movies and had seen her in some other movies as a teenager. The plot needs a bit of help it is a bit slow in the beginning and then goes quickly. I'm not saying that it sucks but it is definitely something you won't be watching over and over.,1374537600,,353,3.8493150684931505
2415994,5,B000BGH2HW,This is a cute comedy film starring: Shirley Temple and David Niven. Geneon [Pioneer] DVD has a pretty good transfer with clear sound. It's surprising that this was her last film role since she was still young at that time. Overall this is a great movie and good DVD and I would recommend this.,1370476800,,294,4.462962962962963
2415995,5,B000BGH2HW,"Since all the other reviews of ""Almost A Bride"" deal with the story line, I want to let everyone know about the quality of the picture on a TV screen.

I watched this on my 40-inch TV and it was almost a perfect picture.  Most DVDs have a grainy appearance when viewed on any screen bigger than 19-inch.  They were probably manufactured before the era of large-screen high def TVs.

The audio seemed a little low to me, but my wife says she could hear it fine.

One other thing, in case nobody else has mentioned it:  ""Almost A Bride"" was not the title of this movie when it was released in 1949.  It was called ""A Kiss For Corliss"", and that's how you'll see it listed in most Shirley Temple filmographies.

It's not really a sequel to 1945's ""Kiss And Tell"", but just another plot involving the same characters, but not the same actors playing them as in ""Kiss And Tell"".

Shirley and her mother constantly strove to get diverse roles for Shirley.  David O. Selznick considered her briefly for the role that Ann Blythe eventually played in ""Mildred Pierce"".  That would have snuffed her sweet, innocent persona!",1369180800,9,1113,4.542713567839196
2415996,5,B000BGH2HW,She doesn't play the sweet innocent precocious child in this movie so if your looking for more of the same then isn't it.  The plot is rather quirky to say the least. Things go down hill when Shirley's character tell's a whopper of a lie to get out of trouble and when another lie she's told is added to the mix... the results are disastrous.  It's a funny and good example of why one shouldn't lie.  I enjoyed seeing her branch out into a roll that wasn't her norm; I thought she made an otherwise unbelievable character believable .,1369094400,3,534,4.373737373737374
2415997,5,B000BGH2HW,"another Shirley Temple stars as Carliss Archer in the follow-up to kiss and tell, in what would become her final Silver screen performance. once again Corliss is up to no good when she Develops a crush on the dashing playboy. I do not want to tell you to much",1367884800,,259,4.3061224489795915
2415998,4,B000BGH2HW,"This was a good movie with the older, more mature Shirley Temple. She was a beautiful young lady back then.",1356134400,3,107,4.4
2415999,3,B000BGH2HW,"A grown-up Shirley Temple plays Corliss Archer, based on a popular radio program of the time.  The plot is typical of the teen comedies of the time: Shirley invents a steamy romance to make her boyfriend jealous; she is out all night and feigns amnesia to avoid punishment.  The twist here is David Niven, playing a well-to-do middle-aged man who has married a string of young women and is shocked, shocked to discover they only wanted him for his money.  Niven is annoyed that Corliss' dad tried to prosecute him on a morals charge.  When Corliss is discovered missing, her parents search her diary for clues to where she might be.  They read Corliss' imaginary love affair with Niven and confront him.  However, unlike Cary Grant in ""The Bachelor and the Bobbysoxer,""  Niven pretends the romance with the young girl is real -- even getting others to back him up.

This however is no ""Bachelor.""  Except for Temple and Niven, the cast is guilty of some of the worst overacting you've ever seen.  The plot is nonsense: Corliss' dad tried to send Niven to jail for taking advantage of young women, then allows his teenaged daughter to marry him?  Niven's character is even more ludicrous.  Bored at his trial, yet angry enough to risk the consequences of pretending to make love to an underaged girl?  It's hard to be sympathetic to a guy who casually casts off his ex-wives, claiming that he is the true victim, but flirts with a teenager before the diary/amnesia occurs.

Recommended for Temple / Niven or 50's teen comedy fans only.",1355270400,,1534,4.7180451127819545
2416000,4,B000BGH2HW,This movie is very comical and was great to see Shirley Temple. Wish she had done more adult movies. Enjoyed the romance between David Niven and Shirley. Good movie that shows days of fun.,1354838400,5,188,4.5588235294117645
2416001,1,B000BGH2HW,"I didn't like this movie at all. It was a real disappointment. Seemed nonsensical. It was not humorous, it was not plausible in my opinion, and it was certainly a waste of money.",1350950400,,178,4.424242424242424
2416002,5,B000BGH2HW,"I SO enjoyed this movie.  I showed it with the family, and we (ladies) were laughing so hard we could hardly hear all the dialogue.  I enjoyed the actors/actresses and the situations these teens found themselves in were hilarious.  Typical teen reactions!  Definitely a family movie and a lot of fun. It was so nice to be pleasantly entertained rather than suffer through a modern-day ""comedy"" with obnoxious, immoral, un-necessary language and actions that one sees/hears everyday. I would recommend this for family or even a ""girls night out"" evening; it is just good, clean fun!",1334016000,5,581,5.020833333333333
2416003,4,B000BGH2HW,"Shirley Temple plays, in my opinion, an extremely unlikeable character in this movie. She is spoiled and toys with Dexter's heart. In this movie she makes up a huge lie when she gets locked in the basement of the Penguin Club till five in the morning. She claims she's gotten amnesia and thinks she is a nine year old child again. Unfortunately for her she and her friend had also told another lie while trying to make Dexter jealous; that Chariss (Shirley Temple who is playing a 17 year old girl) and Marquis (a 37 year old scoundrel)are madly in love and have possibly had sexual relations. When Marquis finds out instead of denying the whole thing he plays along and Temple actually becomes engaged to him. Just before the wedding is to occur the truth finally comes out from all parties and all Temple's friends (who have been bribed to go along with the plot) that this has all been a scam. Of course the wedding is off, much to her parent's relief.

Some of the plot is very cheesy and ridiculous, but it is also quite humorous. As I titled the post, this movie is silly, but still very loveable and I did enjoy this movie. If you are a fan of Shirley's later works I would suggest (if you can find it) The Honeymoon which is also a very lighthearted and funny movie.",1325635200,,1274,4.398305084745763

2416005,1,B000BGH2HW,"I really was disappointed in the movie; I thought I was getting Shirley Temple in a movie called Kiss and Tell.  I had read that Kiss and Tell was renamed Almost a Bride, but it was not the same movie.  No fault to Amazon.",1292889600,,222,4.0227272727272725

2416007,3,B000BGH2HW,"If you're expecting a riotous good time, you won't find it here. However, if you're looking for a pleasant way to spend an hour or so, with a few chuckles and some fine performances, you've come to the right place.

""Almost a Bride"" (originally released as ""A Kiss for Corliss"") came about at an interesting time in motion pictures. Television was just starting to take hold, and in many ways, the film seems like an extended television episode. It's very much in the mold of a show like ""Our Miss Brooks"" or one of the many teen-led comedies of the period.

The story is pure Corliss Archer. Those who are familiar with the Corliss Archer radio program or television show will know what I mean. Typical teen fare, but well-enough made and quite a bit of fun. It was Shirley Temple's final film appearance (though she would appear on television many times subsequent) and it's certainly not her best. It is, however, an exercise in what could have been.

Teenage Temple was quite appealing, and she had matured as an actress. It's one thing to be a tap dancing toddler, it's another to be a young adult actress. Shirley proved in films like ""Since You Went Away"" that she had the acting chops. She was, however, rarely given the opportunity to show it.

But, back to the film. It's in the screwball comedy mold, and as light entertainment it succeeds.

As long as you're not expecting an Oscar-worthy masterpiece, you can't go wrong. An entertaining programmer, worth a look on a rainy Saturday. Adults and older kids will enjoy this one.",1268524800,,1538,4.660516605166052

2416011,3,B000BGH2HW,"I was a huge Shirley Temple fan when I was little and she was the main reason I bought this movie.  I actually think her acting is excellent and she grew up to have a very nice and shapely figure.  However, I myself, have never been a fan of the movies in which the plot consists of basically one mistaken belief heaped upon another mistaken belief and so forth.  I've seen better movies and I've seen worse movies, that's about all I can say.",1219363200,2,443,4.25

2416013,2,B000BGH2HW,"We enjoy Shirley Temple films in our house, from her beginnings in the short films where she wears a little diaper with a huge pin in it, to her teenage roles such as I'll Be Seeing You and Since You Went Away. We can tolerate The Bachelor and the Bobby-Soxer, but this one, Almost a Bride, was almost too painful to watch. It started off okay, though a bit slow, but quickly got dumb and who wants to watch a father yelling all the time? And it is especially aggrivating when people believe lies instead of the truth. Toward the end I was just about ready to turn it off, it got so bad. I am glad I only paid $5.99 for it, so I don't feel so bad about that. Shirley was a nice looking young woman and it is too bad she didn't do more films at this stage in her life. She had the potential, I think, to do much better material than this. I admit I like her little girl roles much better. If you are a David Niven or Shirley Temple fan, you will probably want this film in your collection. Otherwise, I wouldn't recommend it unless you are a person who just likes aggrivating movies.",1165708800,7,1082,4.132701421800948
2416014,3,B000BGH2HW,"ALMOST A BRIDE (aka ""A Kiss for Corliss"") provides a fitting finale to Shirley Temple's screen career.  This was a sequel to the popular ""Kiss and Tell"", in which Temple first played the lovesick teen Corliss Archer.

In this delightful film, Corliss becomes infatuated with the handsome and worldly playboy Kenneth Marquis (David Niven).  She decides to get even with her boyfriend Dexter (Darryl Hickman) and write some steamy - and fake - sections about Kenneth in her diary.  Complications arise when the diary falls into the hands of Kenneth and her parents.  Naturally her parents are mortified, but Kenneth decides to have a little fun and play along with Corliss' games, so he places an article in the paper announcing his engagement to her!  Fantastic support is provided by Tom Tully, Gloria Holden, Kathryn Card and Robert Ellis (who would later go on to play Dexter in the short-lived television sitcom ""Meet Corliss Archer"").

Temple is ideally-suited to Corliss and the entire film is a bright and breezy delight.  Had Temple continued her film career, she would have been sensational as a screwball comedienne.  Sadly audiences could not (or indeed would not) accept that little ""Curly Top"" was all grown up and ready for more challenging roles, and thus Temple retreated from the screen.  Still, it's great to see this film surfacing on DVD (through the 'Cinema Deluxe' label from Geneon Entertainment) at a bargain price.

If you enjoyed this film, you will also love the television sitcom ""Meet Corliss Archer"".  Several volumes of episodes from the series are available from Alpha Video Classics.
