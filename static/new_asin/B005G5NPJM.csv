4689092,1,B005G5NPJM,"I made the mistake of not reading through all the reviews before purchasing this DVD. I bought if for a friend for Christmas and when  we tried to watch it, we discovered it is not close captioned nor does it have any subtitles. I made the mistake of assuming all DVDs are captioned now. We can't even watch it. It's of no use to me. Maybe I'll meet another Kevin Smith fan who can actually hear the DVD and make them happy by giving it to them. We just wish we could watch it.",1329004800,10,477,4.074468085106383
4689093,1,B005G5NPJM,"While I enjoyed all 3 ""Evening with Kevin Smith"" DVD's, I was bitterly disappointed that 2fat440 was not captioned or subtitled for the hearing impaired.
I spent 20 bucks on frisbees",1324166400,15,182,4.903225806451613
4689094,5,B005G5NPJM,"Only Kevin Smith can weave a story involving Cop Out, Bruce Willis, smoking weed, George Carlin, Zack & Mira, Southwest Airlines, buying a bus, and almost getting arrested twice.",1323388800,,178,5.172413793103448
4689095,5,B005G5NPJM,"I was there at the show, and I am on the DVD, therefore, this is the greatest movie ever!

It is the man doing what he does best, telling stories.  If you don't like Kevin, or his stories, don't buy it.  If you do like Kevin and his stories, you already have bought it, so why the f#$k are you reading this revue?",1318896000,7,313,3.9365079365079363
4689096,5,B005G5NPJM,"The other reviewer is obviously not a Kevin Smith fan and just caught something randomly on tv. Kevin Smith does NOT do stand up comedy. If I am wrong I apologise but how can someone complaing his jokes and punch lines suck when he is not telling jokes and punch lines?
Kevin's does Q and As. People ask him questions, sometimes he answers them straight up and sometimes he has a story to go with his answer. Some stories are awseome and funny, (serving jury dude with a tear in his rectum), otheres are not as funny but he tells you about himself and things that you wouldnt know. I don't know any celebrity as well as I know Kevin because poeple ask him about himself and he actually answers!
Too Fat For 40 is our first unedited Q and A we get to watch at home and it is the best! Cant wait for the next one!",1318636800,17,811,4.139240506329114
4689097,2,B005G5NPJM,"Unless you're a die-hard fan, you're not going to appreciate this. I love stand up and laugh at virtually anything that'll provide a tickle, and this guy doesn't do it. His jokes are terribly delivered and he has this awkward stage presence. Even the audience doesn't really care for his humor... the entire time he just cracks on himself and the delivery of his punch lines are terrible. Don't waste your money!",1318291200,4,412,4.736111111111111
4689098,5,B005G5NPJM,"Kevin Smith is a truly gifted (and extremely funny) story-teller.  He may orchestrate his show such that he gets the question (s) that he wants -- but you'd never know it.  His delivery has an easy, laid-back feel to it, so its like hanging out with the funniest person you know.  He is honest, and comes across as an average guy.  I have watched this with my kids (16 and 19) and they love it as much as I do.  (which probably tells you more about my family than it does about Kevin Smith, but I could watch it over and over again, and still laugh til I cry.",1433116800,,559,4.091743119266055

4689101,5,B005G5NPJM,Awesome collection with a live broadcast dvd of the awesome podcast Hollywood Babble On,1420416000,,87,5.285714285714286

4689103,5,B005G5NPJM,"We lost George Carlin, and gained Kevin Smith. His movies may be a tad uneven, but his humor during live stand-up is off the hook. What a great time to sit and laugh as Kevin talks love, lust, the secret to smoking cessation and directing Bruce Willis.",1414195200,,252,4.382978723404255

4689108,5,B005G5NPJM,"One of the most interesting Q+A's with a director that I've ever seen. Kevin Smith provides so much insight and interesting stories throughout the show, you won't be able to stop watching. Fantastic!",1394928000,,199,5.0606060606060606
4689109,4,B005G5NPJM,"This guy has a story for everything. This is what he does, tell stories with a funny twist. All the while he is cutting up his life his mom and wife are in the audience. If you watch this show you'll understand why I mentioned that.",1381104000,,232,4.065217391304348
4689110,1,B005G5NPJM,"When Elvis Presley was near the end of his life, he would mount the stage as a sweating, incoherent mess in front of adoring fans who never appeared to know just how much trouble their idol was in.

Kevin Smith could never claim to reach the heights of a rock star like Elvis...but in this DVD, Smith lumbers across the stage, sweating and monstrously overweight (even for him) and telling stories to adoring fans who don't appear to see what a talentless mess their hero has turned into.  He talks about his recent films that bombed, talks about getting high, talks about how loud his television is.  He has the gift of gab but I have no idea how he gets such large, adoring audiences.

At the end, a birthday cake in Smith's obese likeness is rolled out onstage and he poses next to it.
The cake is perfect.
The audience cheers.
I just don't get it.",1379635200,2,851,4.401273885350318
4689111,3,B005G5NPJM,"He gives you the blow by blow on the ""too fat to fly"" controversy that was reported in the national media.  He also talked about his decision to quit directing.  A very worthy follow up to the previous films of his Q&A.",1379548800,,219,4.190476190476191
4689112,2,B005G5NPJM,"Its not really that funny....he should stay with ""slient bob"" role...Everything else I like but this.  Rent his movies not his stand up",1379030400,,135,4.869565217391305
4689113,1,B005G5NPJM,"He sweats a lot.  Then, he's not very funny.  He's better in movies than stand up comedy, for sure.  There's nothing really original or unique about his standup, nor is it intellectual but, rather, kind of base and juvenile.",1378771200,2,224,4.6923076923076925
4689114,5,B005G5NPJM,Completely wrong and hilarious; but what else would you expect from Kevin Smith?!  As long as you can forget his mom is in the audience you will be cracking up and not feeling horribly awkward!,1376179200,,193,4.514285714285714
4689115,1,B005G5NPJM,One star because he claimed he was going to answer a lot of questions and not take a long time to answer. So what does he do? Takes over an hour  and half to answer the first question about Bruce Willis.,1368489600,3,203,3.951219512195122
4689116,5,B005G5NPJM,Just great to hear his life problems and his way of seeing them. It makes me feel like my problems are nothing.,1366416000,,111,4.090909090909091
4689117,1,B005G5NPJM,"Same old, same old schtick of his other DVD's.  Before watching this, I took the opportunity to watch the others again.  This DVD has the same d*ck jokes, same family jokes, same his wife thinks he is an idiot ancedotes.  Very disappointed.",1363305600,2,240,4.666666666666667

4689119,5,B005G5NPJM,"There's not a lot to be said about this beyond that it's Kevin Smith. If you like Kevin and, specifically, his Q&As, you should like this one. Kevin at his story telling best. Without the giant spiders.",1360886400,,202,4.486486486486487

4689122,5,B005G5NPJM,I love Kevin Smith. He manages to take a simple question and turn it into an hour long response. The tangents his stories break off into would seem aggrivating if they didn't have a point. But every story connects to his point. Most people would have written these stories down and published books. Kevin talks about his stories instead. He knows his audience. I hope he never stops.,1352764800,2,383,4.647058823529412
4689123,5,B005G5NPJM,"You'll have a good ol' time watching this collection of animated shorts and a live taping of the wonderful podcast ""Hollywood Babble-On"". Yeah, you could watch the shorts for free on YouTube, but seeing them on my 47"" TV screen was way more fun--and the live podcast was worth the price itself! If you're a fan of Kevin Smith or comedy in general, but this set today!",1348272000,2,367,4.492537313432836
4689124,5,B005G5NPJM,"If you've seen his previous ""evening with"" shows, you'll find this one fun.  The HUGE annoyance for me was he keeps saying ""and what not"" over and over again! Becomes distracting.  The part where he's talking about working with Bruce Willis was my favorite part.",1346976000,,262,4.8
4689125,5,B005G5NPJM,The dvd is yet another great Q AND A from kevin smith. If you liked the others you will love this one,1346889600,,101,3.6363636363636362
4689126,2,B005G5NPJM,"I will preface this review by saying that I'm a HUGE Kevin Smith fan. Besides owning all of his movies, I've probably seen most of the stuff he's had a hand in as a writer, director, and actor (yep, Catch and Release), and of course his first three stage specials (don't know what you'd call these). I laughed and howled at the first two for sure. The third one wasn't my favorite, but still it had its moments. With that said, I'm not some random person coming here to hate.

The fact is that this fourth effort is lacking. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it just wasn't funny. I suspect that Kevin Smith has basically gone to the well so many times and that the proverbial well is going dry. This bunch of stories are not nearly as solid as those in his first few efforts. Perhaps it's the fact that he had a lifetime to come up with the stories he told in the first two specials and these stories seemed to have been culled from the last few years. Perhaps his love of the bud has started to cloud his memory and judgment. I don't know what it is, but this special is definitely a miss.",1344816000,2,1096,4.169811320754717
4689127,5,B005G5NPJM,"Kevin Smith has several DVD's and Blurays that are solely focused on his Q and A's, so for this one to stand above the rest, it would have to be unique. It is. He answers just one question, and spins it into several hours of hilarity that I wouldn't want to spoil for anyone here. Needless to say it's well worth your time and cash to check this out, and also, to go see him in person when you get the chance.",1333670400,2,409,4.0

8471176,5,B005G5NPJM,"As a Kevin Smith fan, just hearing him talk is enough to earn 5 Stars. His insight and opinions are amazing to hear, and if you are a fan, or want to know more about the man behind the movies, and life in general, check this out.",1502668800,,229,3.893617021276596
