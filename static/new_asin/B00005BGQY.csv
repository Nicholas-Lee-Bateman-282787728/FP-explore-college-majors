1423075,2,B00005BGQY,"Sure, the price and the fact that the DVD contains 12 movies may appeal to you. But this product is AWFUL! The picture and sound quality are terrible, it isn't even in colour! The skits are SO NOT funny. You only see shirley once or twice in each film. Each skit is only five minutes long, and the DVD doesn't have any good bonuses. i should have listened to the first three reviews. Don't buy this, even if you're a big Shirley fan, you'll be extremely disappointed and feel guilty about the big waste of money.
On the plus side, it IS a good way to easily collect every Baby Burlesk movie, and I must admit, they're adorable. Although you might feel like skipping ""Pie-Covered Wagon"" because the picture quality is so awful, the bodies of each child blends with the background and sometimes you can't even see their eyes! There's a short, but good documentary at the end that lasts a couple of minutes, containing original clips of Shirley at her 7th birthday, accepting her oscar, etc. And it's a lot better to buy this movie...than pay...for each Baby Burlesk tape.
So, in conclusion, this is probably the best deal ever for serious fans and collectors of Shirley. But children who adore the tap-dancing cutie won't be pleased. I know I wasn't. The only thing to be glad about was the fact that I'm now able to say I own the complete Baby Burlesk collection:( but that's about it.",1027296000,15,1384,4.54
1423076,1,B00005BGQY,You would really have to love Shirley Temple to endure this. My grandchildren did not enjoy it and neither did I. Don't waste your money.,1004745600,14,137,4.52
1423077,1,B00005BGQY,"This was a huge dissapointment. It started at the very begining when the first screen warns you that the quality of the material does not match todays standards. Naturally you'll find this out only after you open the wrapper. In fact the picture and sound quality were extremely poor.
Secondly I have serious reservations about the people who put these movies together. The children are dressed and act as if directed by Pedophiles. Whats with the underpants, bare legs etc As a mother of a three year old I was appalled. Not to mention the racist casting; all the toddlers of color were either maids, servants or porters. I don't care if this was a sign of the times, its still very insulting. This one WILL NOT grace our TV screen again as I 'd hate to send the wrong message to my child. FORGET THIS ONE",991094400,,806,4.489795918367347
1423078,5,B00005BGQY,"This is some of the earliest footage of the young star.  A wonderful nostalgic assorment of short stories from the 30s. These shorts show the budding personality and presence of the future darling of America before the big studios scooped her up. If you're a Shirley fan this video is a ""must have"" for your collection.",983923200,6,319,4.696428571428571

7937469,5,B00005BGQY,"I grew up watching Shirley as a child, and later as an adult with a daughter of my own.  I purchased some her record albums for my daughter Tammy to listin to. When Tammy was 2 years old, I called her Shirley Temple the second. She had dark natural curly hair, that would naturally curl into ringlets. When Tammy was a teenager I bought the movies for her to watch with her friends. I wasn't able to buy them before.
I also have great nieces & their friends that watch Shirleys movies when they come over to my house.
I highly recommend all of Shirley Temple movies to all parents and grandparents.

7937470,2,B00005BGQY,"let this be a lesson to all of you dissatisfied customers, as I have been saying in several of my reviews here on amazon : if you pay peanuts for old classic movies...you GET peanuts! ONLY buy from respected big studios or high standard companies that put out well restaured and high quality product..after all THEY have a reputation to hold up! All those small kitchen sink dvd purveyors of old films in the public domain don't care about movies, only a quick buck... and that is what you are giving them!",1183680000,,506,4.510869565217392
7937471,5,B00005BGQY,"There isn't much i can say about this product simply that it's interresting to see Shirley in these early films of her life, i've watched it lest three or four times aleady and i still can't get enough of it they are a bit week yes but there supposed to be that way i mean they were made back during the early 1930 all film of that age were made that like the our gang well that i want to say hope this helps Wilson r Tibbo jr.",1171324800,,427,3.8636363636363638
7937472,4,B00005BGQY,"It's hard to believe that a little girl could be that good.

Compared to the other ""baby"" actors, she definately stands out in the crowd.",1141257600,3,137,4.48
7937473,4,B00005BGQY,"We had a copy of this on a video and it was not good quality...had problems with rolling, etc. It is nice to have on DVD because there is no more rolling, and also it is much easier to find the short you wish to view.

My children enjoy this collection of Shirley shorts, but then we don't have TV and they are not ""ruined"" by the pathetic, modern entertainment offerings dished out to children today. These do have some cute moments, and I find them interesting to watch. The one that shows a woman singing like a chicken on a radio show is hilarious! I wonder if she isn't the woman who did all the early Disney chicken voices?

We have most of Shirley's films and we have enjoyed them for years. It is nice to have this DVD of her early work before she was famous. Yes, the quality on some is very bad...I think The Pie Covered Wagon is worst of all, both visually and audibly. But most are very watchable. Would be nice to see these restored though!

If you like Shirley, you will enjoy this. I give it 4 stars not for quality. I would say quality would be 2 and 1/2, but it rounds to 4 because I give it 5 for its availability.",1101945600,18,1132,4.136363636363637
7937474,4,B00005BGQY,"Of coarse these films are in black and white, they are filmed in 1930's!  They are absolute adorable short films Shirley did when she was about 3.  But, I absolutely adore Shirley Temple and have since when I was about 5 (I am 30 now).  I don't know if kids these days will watch it, but then again, look at what kids do and watch today.  Get it for yourself or if you know you have a sophisticated young one who can appreciate ""old movies"" get it for them.",1065916800,20,457,4.101123595505618
