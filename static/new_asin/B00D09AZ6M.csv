8588143,5,B00D09AZ6M,This is an exceptional docudrama that spans the life of Captain Cook. I only knew a little about this intrepid explorer and was exceedingly pleased at the way his history and adventures were delivered. I was swept away by the way this story was told and by the terror and beauty of the people and places he visited. This is not a frothy exultation of his heroic acts as it touches on the darker elements of his voyages and their legacy. The acting was superb as was the commentary.,1496448000,,481,4.415730337078652
8588144,5,B00D09AZ6M,"Four episodes spread over two DVDs this chronicles the life of Captain James Cook (when the gal doing the voice overs says his name it sounds like James Kirk).

Then he opens his secret orders to discover he is being sent to look for a fabled southern continent. He encounters New Zealand and Australia. Actor reenactments appear.

8588147,4,B00D09AZ6M,Balanced documentary on an historical figure and perhaps the world's greatest navigator...although some will view it as politically correct bias.,1401580800,4,145,6.3
8588148,1,B00D09AZ6M,"Disc barely started to play when it began to pixilate and skip, then froze. Other disks played fine.  Cleaning machine had no effect.
This is not the first BFS Entertainment product to have this problem.  Obviously I cannot comment on the actual content of the disks.
Amazon has always gone above and beyond in refunding or replacing the defective product.  However, in the future we will avoid BFS products if possible.  We tried to contact BFS, via their website and they ignored  us.",1401494400,10,486,4.807228915662651
8588149,4,B00D09AZ6M,"Beautifully photographed, and well acted. I knew little of Captain Cook, but having heard some of his journals, I was interested in him, because he seemed to be genuinely interested in the people he met. The Cook of the show did not disappoint.",1383955200,4,244,4.6976744186046515
8588150,2,B00D09AZ6M,"I must say I am disappointed in this DVD.  I had hoped to see the story of James Cook.  Instead, the annoying narrator, Vanessa Collingridge, starts out saying that she always viewed James Cook as an evil imperialist.  Seriously?  Has political correctness really gone that far?  Although she moderates her view, she seems more concerned with the native view of Captain Cook rather than his accomplishments.  Most irritatingly, she spends as much time talking about herself and her views as she does Cook, never missing a chance to be seen walking through modern city streets totally irrelevant to the story or kayaking along way too many shorelines.  She intrudes into the story at every opportunity, even trying to push one of her own ancestors into the story, a man with a totally discredited theory about the discovery of Australia.  In any event, this show was badly done, concentrating more on the narrator and her politically correct views than the true history of a great discoverer.",1374969600,43,991,4.963636363636364
