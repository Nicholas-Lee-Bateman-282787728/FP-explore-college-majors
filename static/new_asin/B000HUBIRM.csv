8141529,5,B000HUBIRM,"I borrowed this item from my public library, and it's a wonderful resource for teachers and parents to understand and manage challenges with autism.  I'm purchasing copies for myself and my child's special ed teachers. Note: the presenter talks very fast and jam packs a ton of information into this set. It is one of the better dvd's I've seen on the topic due to the presenter's insight and management strategies. Look for it at your public library but you may end up buying it as well.",1405555200,2,488,4.609195402298851
