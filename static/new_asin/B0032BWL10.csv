4055093,3,B0032BWL10,"I went into this movie knowing absolutely nothing. I didn't even read the back, but from the cover art, expected a lighthearted family comedy(like The Family Stone maybe?). That is not what I got...

I'm on the verge of saying I hated this movie, but honestly think its one of those films where everyone will take away something different from it. I'm 29, so I don't easily relate to having grown children and being retired. This movie made me really sad because I find it be so true to life these days, where people seem to rarely make time for each other. It was difficult and upsetting to watch a father try so hard to really get to know his kids, while they were usually just lying through their teeth to him.

The redeeming parts for me was the ending, which made me feel better, and the actors. Robert De Niro(Frank) was spectacular and entirely convinced me of his character's good intentions with raising his kids, that maybe fell a little short. His grown children were a little one sided, but that may be how you were suppose to experience them, from Frank's point of view.

On the whole I would say if you go into it knowing what it's about, give it a try and you might really enjoy it. But I found it too painful and depressing for my taste.",1266710400,6,1253,4.392241379310345
4055094,5,B0032BWL10,"Everybody's Fine is a ""people"" movie, a study of characters -- both central and peripheral. It's a drama with some comedic elements, heavy on emotion but low on over-the-top histrionics. And depending on where it might hit you in your own life, it can be a real tearjerker, in that good way that makes you think about the important things and discuss them with the important people in your life.

Robert DeNiro gives an understated performance as a father who would not or could not realize he was expressing lifelong disappointment with his children if they were less than ""the best."" They had spent years hiding any flaws from him and sharing their struggles only with their mother, who had passed several months earlier.

Their stories come together as he travels the country to reconnect. Along the way, British director Kirk Wise (Waking Ned, Nanny McPhee) presents snapshots of interesting characters and fascinating faces, both genial and malevolent.

The part that touched my wife and me most was the technique using children to speak for their grownup counterparts in key sections of the film. DeNiro's character still sees them as school age kids and, through his reveries, so do we. It's not a new technique but it seems to work effectively here and often hits hard in ways that standard confrontational scenes could not. Since our kids are school age and we have parents we want to please too, it made my wife and I think about our own parent/child relationships.

One of the messages of the movie seems to be that it's not too late to pick up the pieces, but you can suffer great losses if you get too distracted and wait too long -- and we all need to take a breath and be more accepting of one another's choices. It's not so much that we should ""settle"" but rather that there are better ways to measure true success.

My only criticism of the DVD is that there is NO AUDIO COMMENTARY. There are a few extended scenes and a short look at Paul McCartney's involvement in creating a song for the film. A commentary was sorely missed.",1266278400,124,2045,4.653739612188366
4055095,1,B0032BWL10,"What a waste of a good cast. This could have easily been a 1970s' ABC Movie of the Week. Substitute Ed Asner for Robert DeNiro, Connie Selleca for Kate Beckinsale, and so on and you get the idea.

The ending was predictable and pedestrian. You never got a sense that these people could even be remotely related rather than sisters and brother and father.

Also, for a road-trip movie, the settings lack authenticity of place. Why would Denver be the home of the Northwest Symphony? Did the screenwriter and director both confuse Boise for Denver?",1266192000,6,546,4.7368421052631575
4055096,5,B0032BWL10,"EVERYBODY'S FINE

STARRING: Robert De Niro, Kate Beckinsale, Drew Barrymore, Sam Rockwell, Lucian Maisel, Damian Young, James Frain, Melissa Leo and Katherine Moening

WRITTEN BY: Kirk Jones, Massimo De Rita, Tonino Guerra and Giuseppe Tornatore

DIRECTED BY: Kirk Jones

Rated: PG-13
Genre: Drama
Release Date: 04 December 2009

Have you ever seen a sad, old man sitting alone in a park or restaurant, and felt sorry for him? Imagine spending several days with him and discovering why he is so sad and all alone and you will be close to the feeling you're left with after seeing Everybody's Fine.

Previously to Everybody's Fine, I don't think any other film ever tore so much emotion out of me in such a subtle manner.

It's slow and not a lot happens in a big, shiny cinematic way; but it's very entertaining nonetheless. Despite its huge A-list cast, it couldn't have felt further from a big Hollywood film. It's beautifully realistic and tragic and sincere all in one. Don't let the misleading trailer confuse you; this is not a comedy as it foolishly tries to make it seem. It has a few minor comedic moments (see the trailer) but the film is heavily a drama.

Robert De Niro plays Frank Goode and it's no mistake that his last name is Goode. He's the sweetest guy you could imagine.

Unfortunately, his wife has recently passed away. To make matters worse, only months after her funeral, not one, not two, not three, but all four of his adult children regret to inform him that they will not be able to make it to see him for the weekend they had planned.

Frank is crushed. He had already gone out and picked up a nice bottle of wine and even purchased a brand new barbeque with plans of cooking for them. Now he will spend the weekend alone. And of course he also learns that his health isn't exactly hunky-dory.

Frank decides that rather than sit around and stew about how bad things are, he will pack a bag and set out on a road trip to surprise each and every one of his kids, instead. Did I mention they are all `conveniently' scattered across the entire United States?

Frank's doctor advised him not to travel as it would be unwise to his health, so he avoids flying or driving and begins his trip with a peaceful train ride.

It is along this journey that we learn Frank is a lonely guy who just wants someone to share a warm conversation with. He chats with strangers he meets here and there and we can't help but wish we were among them, so that we could spend a few precious moments of our time with him.

One of his two sons lives in New York. He arrives there first, only to discover he isn't home. (Frank never heard from this son; one of the others canceled for him) and we find that he may be up to something. Frank sketches a note (that will bring a tear to your eye) on the front of a prepared envelope and drops it under his door.

We learn Frank has an envelope for each of his kids and of its contents late in the third act. I won't spoil it for you, but you may want to have a tissue handy. Don't worry; it's not predictable or cheesy.

Next he goes to see one of his two daughters, Amy (Kate Beckinsale). She is very surprised to see him. Frank begins to uncover her excuse to not make the visit.

We don't hate her, or any of his other kids for making excuses to not see him, but we become very disappointed by their heartless actions. They clearly love their father and seem to have a pretty good relationship with him, so why the selfish behavior? Everybody's Fine leaves no questions un-answered, but I don't want to reveal too much.

His other two children are played by Drew Barrymore and Sam Rockwell. Rockwell shows us a side of himself that we have never seen before, as Robert. We get a lot out of him in his few short scenes. I still think he was robbed of an Oscar nomination in The Green Mile, but if he keeps acting like this, he'll have at least one in no time.

Barrymore plays Rosie and has perhaps the strongest connection with her father. Because of this bond they share, Frank can sense she isn't telling him something. At this point he is frustrated because he realizes he's drifting apart from all four of them and it's devastating.

The filmmakers give us a vividly entertaining and original scene of exposition; by which we learn a great deal more about these characters. This idea was very unique and well put together and really ties the story together quite nicely. All of the acting in this scene is brilliant.

The acting in this film is heartfelt and good and never over the top. De Niro delivers one of his best performances in years; touching your soul with his interpretation of Frank Goode. You really feel for Frank in this picture and you adore the time you have spent with him.

One of my favorite scenes takes place in a subway tunnel between Frank and a man asking for change. Frank is down on his luck and lends a helping hand to this young man, without hesitation. The acting is dead-on and the scene slaps you in the face and visually looks like gold. You will know the one I mean.

Come to think of it, there are several moments that were shot with equal precision and artistic vision. This film reminded me a lot of About Schmidt, for various obvious reasons. Writer and director Kirk Jones has created a beautiful film and I look forward to more of his work in the future.

At one point I thought the film was seconds from being over and I was in tears at how wonderful it had all come together. Then De Niro takes your breath away yet again, during the actual resolution.

Frank's narration at the end and the final shot could not have been perfected any better. This film is far more than just fine and everybody in it that we care about is too.",1265587200,15,5724,4.387523629489603
4055097,1,B0032BWL10,"Tornatore's ""Stanno tutti Benne"" (with Marcello Mastroiani), was skillfully developed for the Italian culture.

This remake lacks the essence of the Italian version, and even if the same writers were called as part of the cast for the ""translation"" (scenes repeated) to the American way of life, they couldn't get the essence of the Scuro's family in the original movie.

It would be nice for Miramax to release again the original version.",1261526400,6,439,5.083333333333333
4055098,5,B0032BWL10,"Kirk Jones wrote and directed ""Everybody's Fine"".  This is an wonderfully quiet film that follows the lonely Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) who goes on a trip to visit his children (Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell), since they were too busy to visit him. Unbeknown to Frank is that his artist son, who is in Mexico, has run into some problems, but the other children are trying to cover up this fact. We follow Frank, who is a kind, and intelligent man, who has never really been close to his children, and who is making the effort to bridge this gap late in his life. This is a heartfelt exploration about a father trying to connect with his children which inevitably nurtures a feeling of goodwill and love.",1261008000,21,721,4.589147286821706
4055099,5,B0032BWL10,"As a big fan of Robert De Niro, I was excited to see him appearing in another dramatic role. De Niro appears as a widower who embarks on a cross-country trip to visit each of his four children after they all cancel their plans to visit him at his home in Elmira, New York. Against his physician's advise he sets out and each of the four stops is a disappointment as he slowly realizes, by their thinly veiled excuses, that something isn't ""right"". A perfectionistic father who coated electrical wiring for a living, he expected his children to reach the top of their chosen fields(an artist, an advertising executive, a musician / conductor, and a dancer). As the story unfolds it become apparent that the kids have gone to great lengths to present a facade of success and happiness. He comes to realize that the negative details of his children's lives have always been hidden from him...even by his now deceased wife. In a touching scene when he insists on the truth regarding one of his children, he responds with, ""No, No...tell me it's not true."" The bottom line: this family kept secrets and secrets benefit no one. This very thought-provoking film is a real tear-jerker, so be prepared. I disagree with the opinions of many of the professional critics. This was an incredible film! Robert De Niro approached his role with tenderness and sensitivity and in my opinion was the top performance of the year. This film will be a definite addtion to my DVD collection. I highly recommend it!",1260835200,91,1492,4.7203065134099615
4055100,5,B0032BWL10,"I went by myself, a 62 year-old with 4 grown sons. I sat in my old hunting coat and sniffled and cried for however long it was. I think De Niro wears his role with both an ease and a genius few possess. I'll get the DVD as soon as it's released. I know De Niro's own real-life dad passed shortly before his ""Bronx Tales"" was released, and perhaps, in some zen-like chi, this kinda closes a circle on the dad-stuff there. I met De Niro once, and was extremely impressed with his character (as in 'integrity', not as in an acting role).",1260489600,73,534,4.194174757281553
4055101,4,B0032BWL10,"Frank (Robert De Niro) is a recently widowed father of four with badly damaged lungs from a long career of PVC-coating telephone wire. When all four of his adult children opt out of a family get-together, he decides to come visit them against the advice of his physician.

What he finds is not quite the picture his wife painted for him. One son is missing. His older daughter's marriage is in trouble.  The younger son he thought was a conducter is actually a percussion player.  And the Vegas-dancer daughter....

This low-key, but heartfelt, drama brought tears to my eyes more than once. I've seen De Niro in quite a few films, but this is one where he shows a bit of himself as a proud but puzzled papa. One warning, bring tissues to the film.  I was not the only theatre-goer who had to resort to the concession area napkins to wipe my eyes.

4055102,5,B0032BWL10,This movie is Brilliant and Robert De Niro portrays the father who had high expectations for his kids and how it all plays out is brilliant and pretty much what happens with most families who superimpose their values on their children instead of letting a child develop naturally their own values!

Wow Robert DeNiro once again proves he is an AWESOME actor.  In this role he played that aging dad who recently lost his wife and has his own very dreaded illness, so he set out to have his family come together.  He struggles to go on a cross country journey to surprise the grown children because they were unable to show up for the well planned get together  a family reunion.  He plays a deeply emotional role wonderfully.  This move is moving and lovely done especially when there is peace in the memories of the children (when they were little and growing up)..  All he wants is to know that EVERYBODYS FINE or so it first seems.  The rest of the cast was also excellent and helped to bring a real life to all of the characters.  Very well written .

HINT
Do not forget to have some tissues around in case you get emotional.
IMMEDIATELY CONTACT your father/dad/whoever if you are lucky enough to still have one and let them know the blessing they are to you.
Be honest and share the truth -- your truth -- with others and not hide behind an ""Everybody's fine"" line.

HIGHLY RECOMMEND EVERYBODY'S FINE",1482624000,3,1115,4.448275862068965
4055223,5,B0032BWL10,"I had never heard of this movie by Robert De Niro.  Where have I been for the past eight years?

The movie lingers with a holiday voice many of us adult children may relate to.  I saw myself in one of the daughters, although not one of them resembles me in my life.  The message touches on the heart:  don't push your children too hard to be what you want them to be.  Let them grow up to find their own passions and happiness.

DeNiro is a recent widower.  His wife Jeanne had died eight months ago.  Jeanne had always kept in touch with the children and listened to their stories.  Frank was too busy to talk with them, always getting the stories filtered through his wife.  Now that Jeanne is gone, Frank is realizing that the lives his children are leading in New York, Las Vegas or Denver are not the glorious lives he thought they had.  He's learning the truth when all four of his adult kids cancel plans to spend Thanksgiving with him.  He's determined to then travel across the country without notice to see each of his four children, despite his doctor's orders not to travel due to his heart issues.  He asks them all ""Are you happy?""

There are many predicable scenes, but the acting of all the characters is solid.  Whether a parent or an adult child, the message will hit everyone in some way.

I really started missing my dad again, who passed away in 2002.  He, too, always asked me if I were in love and happy.",1482624000,3,1427,4.320754716981132

4055417,1,B0032BWL10,"This 2009 color movie is apparently the story of a dysfunctional family. It seems that a similar film had been done a few years earlier, and for most reviewers, done better. In this film, the story is the problem, although many are of the opinion that Robert DeNiros superior acting saved the film.
To summarize, and there might be a spoiler here, Frank is an elderly retired factory worker of Italian descent, eight months a widower. His four adult children are not living at home. The film opens with preparations for a reunion he has planned at the family homestead. It was not to be because all of his children asked to be excused from attending for various reasons.
Frank then plans to visit them as a surprise. They live in cities across the country. As he visits each, he is disillusioned to find that they are not accomplished in their chosen avocation as he was led to believe. The question then becomes why have they been lying to him about their lot. Frank believes that he has always wanted the best for them. The magnitude of this unlikely construct of group deception necessitates follow-up perceptive inquiry, which was not done, detracting from bittersweet intention of the story, and suggesting the story can have another meaning.
Analysis of the avocation Franks children reveals: an artist who was a druggie and overdosed in Mexico, a dancer who had an illegitimate child and is bisexual, a musician content to be only percussionist not a conductor, and an editorial advertizing executive who is cheating on her husband who is cheating on her. So now the subliminal message of the film, rather than favoring the sadness of the maligned father, becomes Hollywoods cherished concept of the goodness of the artiste bastardized by an insensitive society.",1478044800,,1769,4.880398671096345

Also, good in teaching lessons that we ultimately make our own choices with or without parental influence. Parental influence is a major factor which is often done in innocence. Film gets you emotionally involved and induces thoughts of am I parenting with the child's desires in mind.

It was a very odd plot I don't know if it was part of the feeling the director wanted the viewer to have or just a bad direction they took with this movie. Shoving dad off just because you don't want to tell him that Davids in trouble is crazy! Or Rosie hiding you had a child and finding a fake apartment to stage as your own added to weird unbelievable vibe.  Amy acting still married and not separated to her cheating spouse?! So many head scratchers here.

Saying this it was not a horrible movie it defiantly makes you stop and self reflect how fast your children grow up and what you say to them has deep long affecting impact on them. Made my husband sneak a kiss after we watched it.",1475107200,,799,4.215686274509804

When we hear in the father's final reverie: `its not your fault' by the father to his dead son and the son to his dead father before saying `I'll say hi to mom' is sweet - but you know it is one more lie meant to make you accept.

That must account for that scene and also the other daughter ""not being sure if she likes men or women "" scene, nothing whatsoever having to do with the original story I bet.

4055774,2,B0032BWL10,"While this film may vividly depict the difference between a family patriarch's perception of his children and reality, it is a sad and boring experience for the viewer.  In this film DiNiro has recently lost his wife and decides that he will have his children visit him for a family reunion.  Each child calls him and presents their excuse for not being able to attend.  So, DiNiro, who has a preconceived notion of how wonderful his children are decides to visit them.  Thus begins this arduous journey by bus and train travel to visit each of them.  Each visit reveals that his children have lied to him with their excuses regarding his now defunct reunion, and continue to lie to him with their excuses as to why he can not stay with them for a short visit.  Moreover, none of their lives are what his deceased wife had led him to believe, as he now realizes that she embellished upon their success to shelter him from any disappointment.

I kept waiting for something more interesting to occur as this slow moving tale played out, but nothing did.  The story is uncomplicated and lacks any suspense or thought provocation.  It is a sad, boring depiction of typical family dysfunction presented through mediocre writing and non dynamic acting.  Even DiNiro couldn't bring interest to this sorrowful tale.",1473638400,,1307,4.768888888888889

And, as a daughter who has recently lost her mother, I wept for all of the kids who've also just lost their mother. I believe I wept for them the most...

4056386,3,B0032BWL10,"""It's okay"", but it is not okay.

The movie was an outstanding poignant movie about the tremendous angst that happens when families tell lies for all the right reasons.  Lies never work.  It has been the center of so many good tales, and this one is no exception.  The cast of course was spot on.

What is not okay is the blurb for the movie: ""the heartwarming film that will move you to laughter and tears""  Heartwarming:check! Tears: check! Laughter: No. Unless you laugh at funerals (and I am not talking the funeral of Chuckles the Clown), you will not laugh during this movie.

It is quite ironic that a movie about how lies hurt is described with such a falsehood.",1469059200,,670,4.487603305785124

Billed as a comedy.  But is a drama reminiscent of ""On Golden Pond"" or ""Tender Mercies"".  Young people may not get the movie as they will identify with the children and not the main character.  Doing so, they might lose the poignancy.  In other words, one needs a bit of sophistication born of life experience to truly ""get"" this movie.

Robert DeNero is on his game and as wonderful as he always proves himself to be. He doesn't play a ""tough guy"" in this film, but his acting skills are 5 star, as usual. The all-star supporting cast members also bring their A-game and their characters are interesting and believable. The movie is actually quite good. The reason I can only give it a 4 star rating is because the description of the movie tells you that you'll laugh and cry during the film, but in reality, there are not many laughs or even smiles, there are just a lot of tears. I'm talking about an entire box of tissues worth of tears. If you enjoy tear jerkers, you'll love the movie...especially if you're a parent. I'm a parent who needs a few laughs with the tears and since I didn't find anything humorous in any way, shape, or form, I can only give it 4 stars. I almost want to call it false advertisement because it clearly said to expect laughter and tears in it's summary preview, but all I did was cry...from the beginning to the end. The plot was good, the acting was great, and my tears were abundant. I was exhausted from crying so much.

Or at least he doesn't seem to act. He is simply Robert DeNiro, a ""character"" for which I have no affinity. Indeed, the protagonist's adult children can't  stand being with him. We lasted about 30 minutes and turned it off.",1468454400,2,367,4.477611940298507

4056655,2,B0032BWL10,The movies has great actors but it's definetly not a comedy.  The movie is about a man actually getting to know his family and why they put on a show for him and we're open with his wife. It's a movie that makes you think how well you know  your loved ones. It also makes you question your parenting style and maybe improve it. It's a good sad kinda movie.

It's an almost universal issue but few films have ever covered this heart aching subject so well.  I watched it a second time and liked it even more in the second viewing.  The best De Niro has been in years...and I think he is always pretty darn good.  This film deserved more recognition than I recall it getting.  I don't think that its title helped.  It's a beautifully nuanced film that is in the same league as films like ""Terms of Endearment"".",1468195200,,584,4.676470588235294

4056682,1,B0032BWL10,"Really bad story.  It was great for the first part as a Dad I had high hopes for the development of the ending, but in the end you will only like this movie if you think that parents should just keep their mouth shut about how their kids live their lives, after all what do parents know about life and the world anyway. Lying, under achieving, cheating, divorcing, fornication, adultery, you name it are all perfectly legitimate ways to live.  But let a well meaning father care for his children and its time to send him home and put him in a closet until he learns the mantra...everybody is fine and you should keep your mouth shut about it.",1467936000,3,642,4.38655462184874

4056746,2,B0032BWL10,"This has about 15 minutes worth of scrip packed into a 2 hour movie that move at the pace of molasses on a cold winter day. Probably not destined for a Father's Day classic, this movie follows a father reaching out to his adult children after his wife's death and centers the relationship between dad and the kids.

However, unlike most dad movies where there is a different relationship for each kid, in this one they are all the same and so formula, living for dad's respect and an emotionally detached dad, only with the twist of being boring.

If you liked The Intern you will probably like this as well as anyone in a coma, the pace is just right for the comatose.",1467590400,,669,4.387096774193548

They don't mean to I suppose but they get so busy with life with school or a job or just with their own friends and families. I feel that as a parent if we bond with our kids while they are young this might not be the case as it was in ""Everybody Fine"" but again it depends on how a family is united or not. Its a two-way street. Grown children do not necessarily share their everyday life with their parents if they did then this would not happen. They don't realize that parents are people who need to be involved in their children's life, so as sister's and brother's. Not to be in their business but to know that they are doing fine and when they are not. Whether  you have a two parent home or you are a single mother or dad raising children it should not be that once they are out of the house your job is over, in reality your job is never over. Grown children should make time for their parents because no one lives forever. Parents need to know that you care about them.

Talk about denial. He also sees another piece of the ""talented"" young man's piece of crap toward the end of the film and the galleries' sales girl comments that David was ""special"" - and we all know what that word implies in this politically correct society. Other than the never-seen ""adult"" David (except for a brief second in a dream), we're stuck with 3 other mediocre Millenials , one who, of course, has to be gay, or hinted at (Hollywood 101- a must in every film nowadays), who have their own sad stories - none of which are even worth mentioning. SPOILER: DeNiro gets mugged in a train tunnel at one point, and I half expected him.to say to the cretin,""Young man, I'm sure you must be a disappointment to your parents.""",1463184000,3,943,4.394285714285714

This movie is awesome ... and I feel like in a lot of ways, it's realistic and depicts our lives. We get so busy with life, or pretending to do life, that we don't realize how it's affecting the people who love us. This one definitely touches the heart and pulls every emotional string. I thought about my own dad and pictured that this is how he feels when I'm too busy to talk or to return a call or reply to an e-mail right away. Sometimes it takes me days to get back to him (and I really do have a busy life). I never get to see how that makes him feel ... so seeing Dinero play this role is really an eye opener. It make me sad and kinda convicted me too. In fact, I'm going to go call my parents right now!",1462665600,,825,3.9166666666666665

The dialogue was very realistic, and so well-delivered by the fine actors.  The direction was really quite an additional bonus, with some of the shots being quite symbolic and with how the timing moved the plot along.  And then, at least for me, there were those moments when the movie gave me an opportunity so say, ""Oh, so THAT""s what that was all about.""  I have to say that I was deceived by the cover photo in the movie listings.  I thought it was a comedy and laughed out loud a few times early on until I realized how serious the movie was.",1462492800,,688,4.3359375

It doesn't go quite how you think it might, and in the end you realize that even when everybody's not fine, family remains family. Just has to be re-invented on a regular basis. DeNiro worked on a movie called ""The Intern"" with a premise that seemed formula at first - but went off into a completely unexpected direction. This movie does the same thing - the estrangement of his children is not for the reasons you'd predict.

De Niro is fantastic. His quest for sharing a family holiday is not easy but finally succeeds!!!!!

4057361,1,B0032BWL10,"Unless boredom, depression and wasting time is your movie criteriaSTAY AWAY. Watching this tiresome slow moving event unravel in front of my eyes made me wish I was in the dentists chair instead. At least there, something productive would be happening. Watching De Niro slowly limp through every prolonged agonizing scene visiting his dysfunctional lying grown children was not only painfully BOORING but a waste of my time.  I turned this slow burner off about half way through, I suffered long enough, but the next day, against every sane thought I had and not wanting to be a quitter and against better judgement I decided to continue watching till the end. I finished watching this stinker. My curiosity was satisfied. I wasted more valuable time but this pathetic, painful sleeper finally came to its long anticipated ending.
This was one Hollywood production ( I refuse to call this a movie or entertainment ) that ranks among the top most dreadful time wasting shows I have ever had the misfortune of viewing. Every cloud has a silver lining and the silver thread in this mess was the fact that it was free! I would rate this as a minus 5 stars!",1459123200,,1152,4.76

4057364,4,B0032BWL10,"Very sad in many ways, but a perfect description of what goes on in many dysfunctional families.  The rescuing of each other , the well meaning protecting of their father, which is also demeaning. This is an example of role reversal in many families. Not realizing he just wanted more of their time. His attitudes and theirs clashing. I also found much humor and love the acting, especially of Robetr De Niro.  I was a family therapist, so some of my opinions are based on my bias and experience, and tinged by my being elderly.  Would recommend it if you like real life thought provoking movies. A good one for a therapist to watch with a family and open it up for discussion.",1458518400,,677,4.487804878048781

He sets out to reconnect with them across the U.S. Along the way, he learns some lessons about what it takes to keep a family together. We highly recommend this!",1457222400,,536,4.316831683168317

The writer captured very accurately the dynamic of so many families - a gruff Dad/Husband who is a control freak, too afraid of things going bad to let go and let things go real.  A family who spends their youth trying to avoid getting Dad mad.  Everyone dancing around an emotional minefield.  Then, when Dad is old and alone, he reaches out to discover that he is reaping what he sowed, children that are conditioned to be emotional fakes around him.  There is a good lesson here for those who have the awareness to recognize the dynamics in play.  Great movie.  Not an uplifting movie, but one that is real.",1456531200,,707,4.563492063492063

It could be a shallow plot line, or whatever, but this kind of movie has been 'there, done that"" many times. I found it not only boring, but very weak in character presentation. There was lots of wiggle room for much better acting, as this was just a 'show up, one take, get your paycheck Mr. De Niro, Ms. B, etc."" and try not to break an emotion.",1455408000,,439,4.238095238095238

4057745,4,B0032BWL10,"An excellent cast makes this a movie worth watching.  The story of a bachelor surviving with occasional help from his children is entertaining.  What makes the story a step above is the father dealing with the fact that he knew little of the truth of what was going on with his children.  His wife filtered out the negative so that he would feel better about his parenting.  This lack of information is perhaps the driving force of the film as he slowly learns the truth and comes to peace with it.  On a broader level, a useful lesson for all of us when we realize that not all of our children, and perhaps none, became Albert Einstein.",1454976000,,637,4.410256410256411

De Niro is playing a typical De Niro character (distant, hard nosed but well intentioned father).  The very talented Sam Rockwell is underutilized as an underachieving son.  If you're sick and can't reach the remote control, it's a fine way to spend 90 or so minutes.  If you have the energy to search for something, ""The Family Stone"", or ""About Time"" are better choices for faimily dynamics in the face of loss.",1453939200,,548,4.618556701030927

The remaining siblings keep the information from their father in fear of hurting him and or making him worry. All Dad wants is to have all his children around the table one more time. When no one shows for the initial invite he goes on a cross country bus and train expedition to round everyone up.
He finds drama at every stop and he finally realizes that his kids are grown up and have pursued their own life callings. Heart-warming and totally real. A good watch.",1453680000,,748,4.507352941176471

As other reviewers have stated, it is a ""people"" movie with the plot revolving around the relationships between a recent widower and his adult children.

4058183,4,B0032BWL10,"Really hard to say, cuz this is me.  I'm not the usual ""critic"".  Especially as I've gotten older, I find movies like these real tear jerkers.  Especially because, and I can say this without ruining the movie, I see me in their father.  I find it hard to see my children as the adults they've become. The letting go.  I always will think of them as my children, but I need to let go of the CHILD in them, the child I protected, loved, adored, chased after (one more often than the other two), etc etc.  It's especially hard as he's getting older and just wants to know his kids are okay.  Is that what we all want?  Robert DeNiro, woo hoo!  Funny I just watched him in 1991's (that's not that long ago, is it?) Cape Fear (that scary MF'er)  He's been an excellent actor.  I'll never forget the first comedy I ever heard he was in and saw (not sure the title - about the FOCKERS - Ben Stiller is his soon to be son-in-law)  I remember thinking, him? In a comedy.  Nah!  He is such a wonderful actor, so I guess not only the story itself, but the fact that his kids are all about MY AGE now (probably a good 5 years younger :)  and I see him now, this regular OLDER man; and that's my dad now. NOT that scary tough guy from CAPE FEAR, like my dad used to be.  A scary guy, thank God who never took us on a boat on Cape Fear!
A must see!  I don't think the majority of you will cry like me, but sure there's others out there that can't help it.  Holding it in just makes you flubber blubber a lot more :-)  Very good ending; good script.  I never heard of the movie till seen it here at Amazon Prime.  One I would recommend if you have PRIME!

Obviously De Niro's character had some sort of paradigm shift however, none of the kids know this and are keeping up heir angst against their father for God knows what reason.  The movie was very transparent and predictable.  Even this fine cast of actor's could save a bad script because that's what it is, a bad script.  The sub plot of his medical issues made no sense and quite frankly writers do some research before writing in a piece of crap sub plot as that..  It was a reach at best.  The movie just was a poor effort all around, I really wonder if the production company knew this was going to be a huge flop and made the movie anyways so they could take it as a loss against their taxes.

4058374,3,B0032BWL10,"Strong Cast led by Robert De Niro.  Intended to touch the heart but in the end is a long story about a families journey and how it relates to widower Di Niro.  The story is about his now adult children who he seeks to bring together at a family dinner, and the failings along the way.  All of  the actors did well with their parts, aided by a good performance by Drew Barrymore.  However Di Niro was forced to carry almost the entire on screen time of the story.  The story line drags on and on as the relationships of Di Niro with his children is played out across the entire country.  In the end I did not find the film to be very compelling as a drama.  While Di Niro seldom falls short in the performances given, he and the cast were handicapped in my view with a story line that dragged on endlessly.  In the end the punch line, which is the final scenes of the movie, were not sufficient to justify all that had been played out over the course of the production.  While the ending suggested by the movies title, Everybody's Fine, may convey the final destination of the story line, I would say that would not be my feeling about this movie overall.",1448064000,,1154,4.252293577981652

We took a break with 20 minutes left in the movie and took a vote who wanted to finish it. Nobody had any desire to see it through, but we did because we were curious what was in the envelopes.

It was heartbreaking in a way to see him prepare for his children to visit, and for him to learn that their lives were not as he believed them to be.  I also didn't understand why he didn't just have his doctor send the prescription for his meds to Las Vegas, but perhaps that had to do with his overwhelming need to always maintain appearances and display proper behavior (i.e., following orders).

4058771,5,B0032BWL10,"Five BEGUILING Stars! Everybodys Fine is another triumph by Robert DeNiro in this a comedic drama about an ailing retiree who was widowed only months before, struggles to keep up with duties around the home, while downplaying his medical condition. He decides to bring all of his grownup children back to the family home for a dinner. Circumstances prevent this, so he decides to visit them. There are several laugh out loud moments, rising tensions, and lots of touching scenes as familial truths are revealed. It co-stars Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale, and Sam Rockwell, with a cameo by Melissa Leo, and the entire cast does a wonderful job. Written and directed by Kirk Jones. Highly Recommended.

This is a good turn for DeNiro, as well; he plays a strong character, yet he is a bit more vulnerable than in other roles.  I would characterize the ending as ""happy,"" although not in the conventional way.  In general, the story is pretty sad, yet it ends on an uplifting note.

My one criticism would be that there seems to be an inordinate amount of deception within the family, and that just seemed too unrealistic.  Otherwise, the story was consistent with the normal family issues and dramas.",1441843200,,630,4.63063063063063

Mr De Niro is, as always, beyond exceptional.  And Ms Barrymore and Ms Beckinsale are great too.  The whole cast does a wonderful job.

Now, regarding the Amazon Prime service, it had a few bumps along the way. Unfortunately, those bumps caused the movie to stop, reconnect and take off again ""Rewinding"" a couple of minutes.

I found this movie to be a very moving tale of a father, likely nearing the end of life and assessing his life's accomplishments.

Through a road trip to see his children scattered all over the U.S. he begins to unravel reality...REAL reality. Not the one that he had made up in his head, by hearing only what he wanted to hear and also only what his wife and children filtered to him- disclosing on the 'successes'- perceived or otherwise.

There is no 'bad guy' here. Everyone is just human, perfectly flawed...beautifully imperfect. The acting was well done- understated, heartwarming and raw.

I wasn't sure what this movie was about when I started watching- saw that it had a few stars and Robert De Niro and thought why not? I'm glad I did watch. Thought provoking as a parent (of 4, just as he was in the story). It's not a feel good movie, but it's not a depressing movie...it's just...real.",1438473600,,923,4.488095238095238

When the kids all cancel a holiday visit, he decides to hit the road to visit them, sans cellphone and laptop (he's the last of a literally dying breed). The interactions are moving, the directors incorporation of real children into his conversations with his adult children (De Niro's character, like all parents, sees his children as he did many years ago), is brilliant and priceless.

The movie may be slow moving for some, but I thoroughly enjoyed the character development and a story many of us can relate to... Will probably watch it again in the future.",1438214400,,682,4.73109243697479

Everyone seemed so able to travel in a moment's notice and one family member manages to keep an enormous secret which, when revealed, appeared to have little, if any, impact on other family members.  Robert De Niro takes one piece of carry-on luggage with him to cross the country in a bus.  There are frequent stops.  He is looking good all the time.  Not even a wrinkle in his shirt!  Even the area of the bus depot or train station where DeNiro is accosted is scrubbed clean.  There was a lot about the movie many parents can relate to.  De Niro loves his kids and the ending put me in mind of a story book ending because it was tidy, upbeat despite great loss and

Although fathers are extremely important to the family unit; we often forget to include them in the day-to-day experiences of the children.  Somehow, we believe they are too busy to care - - which often has little to do with them but more to do with the role of the mom.  Because moms are usually the nurturers and have more daily direct contact with the kids, we are lead to believe that fathers don't care - - SHAME ON US!  The movie reminded me to be sure to inform my husband of everything  he should know about our children - - the good, the bad and the ugly!

4059664,5,B0032BWL10,"Robert De Niro was extraordinary in this film about life.  It touches home to those with children and those who have experienced the the iron fist of  competitive parents.  He captured the  character of a hardworking dad that had recently become a widower with excellence and meticulous  detail to every aspect of temperament.  The other actors supported the storyline without over acting and embodying children that only sought acceptance from a man that worked hard to provide for his children, but missed a beat in connecting as a father.

This is not only a great film because of its artistic expression, but the underlying lesson of simply accepting children for who they are.  It is evident the director wanted film  watchers to move away from defining people by materialistic views and status achieved by success in our society.

Excellent film, anything less than five stars would be implausible.",1433721600,,904,5.047297297297297

4059740,4,B0032BWL10,Sad and emotionally powerful story of lonely father disconnected from his four children who have been conditioned to keep the less than perfect details of their lives from him. The tone of this film is contemplative but it is well done and touching. The children were comfortable with sharing with their mother but she has recently passed and the father must take on the role of being the glue that keeps the family in touch.

4059772,3,B0032BWL10,"I found this to be entertaining.  I think some of the things that occurred are true for most families - children protecting their parents from bad news and vice versa.  Evidently the father had been quite a task master when his children were young and there was some resentment there.  Nevertheless, they all seemed to love and respect each other.  I think the father learned some things, too, about his effect on the children.  I'd recommend it for someone who wants to spend the time just watching something fairly enjoyable without all the murder, sex, and bad language that is found  in so many movies today.",1431734400,,612,4.726415094339623

The movie starts out as a simple father trying to find time to see his kids that he never gets to see anymore cause they are all grown up. Classic father. He assumes the kids are alright but of course something is wrong with each of them. If the movie just focused on that I think it would have been fine. But no, they drag it out and make the movie so slow the punch line is missed in every scene you would expect to feel some kind of emotion. Would not recommend to watch this movie to anyone.

I'm guilty of it also, there are things that I kind of just shake my head about wondering why I wasn't more open when I had the chance. For some odd reason this movie just kind of made me sad to think about what relationship I could have had with my parents if I had been more open and honest.

The fact that DeNiro's character gives his son a hard time for being the timpanist instead of the conductor of an orchestra is infuriating. Also, insinuating that playing ""drums"" is a back up and low stress is ridiculous as playing percussion in a professional orchestra is anything but easy. Being a professional musician is certainly rewarding but requires countless hours of hard work and dedication.

4060028,4,B0032BWL10,"So, do we call him ""Bob,"" ""Bobby,"" or ""Mr. De Niro?""

Suffice it to say that I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  But, here's a little warning, it is not your typical light comedy all filled with sunshine and Hollywood endings where everybody lives happily ever after.

This is actually a remake of an Italian movie.  The story follows a widowed father dealing with his grown children who constantly lie to him, ostensibly to protect him.  But, the lying has led to estrangement, that the protagonist seeks to remedy by journeying across the country to seek out his children and drop in on them by surprise.

One theme of the story is the importance of continued communication and it is beautifully represented in the film through the recurring motif of wires.  The protagonist labored for many years in a factory that put the insulated coating on wires.  This labor ruined his health, but ultimately enabled his children to enjoy a reasonable standard of living and build somewhat successful lives.  Of course, they have all lied about the degree of their success, not wanting to disappoint Dad.  The story build towards the inevitable reckoning with the truth.

The film is not overly sentimental and has lots of comic relief interspersed.  Mr. De Niro's portrayal is spot on.",1428105600,,1275,4.879069767441861

4060033,4,B0032BWL10,"This is an enjoyable and entertaining movie, although it radically deviates from the film it is based on: Giuseppe Tornatore's ""Stanno tutti bene"" (""Everybody's Fine""), which starred the great and very versatile actor Marcello Mastroianni. The Italian landscape, which plays such an important role in the original, doesn't really do a lot for the film since the scenery in the Amercan version is not that distinctive. Of course, you know when you're in Las Vegas but I don't think the same can be said for Chicago or Denver. The main character (De Niro) also loses the complexity and ambiguity of his Italian counterpart, which is an important part of the psychological premise of the film (the extent to which he believes or doesn't believe the reality that unfolds before him throughout the film). The themes of old age loneliness are also underplayed. There's really only one clear reference to the alienation of the elderly, and that's the scene in the Essex Diner, where a man makes a rather sudden and random comment about how children do not have time for their parents. The American version uses the motif of the storm as its thematic underpinning. A woman traveling with De Niro on the train tells him that her name is Alice, the name of the current storm that is raging on the east coast. Her name derives from Greek and means truth. The storm later appears as a metaphor during a dream sequence in which De Niro confronts his children (young children) and asks they why they have all lied to him. As one might expect, the ending of the American film is more positive and straightforward than in the Italian version. De Niro's positive conclusion is overly optimistic and too neat, detracting from the deeper conflict that characterizes the film. De Niro's performance is a little uneven, although it's nice to see him play a dramatic role, while the parts played by Beckinsale, Barrymore, and Rockwell are quite good. There's one scene toward the beginning of the film that I wondered about and that seemed somewhat illogical. We see a woman traveling alone and trying to guess along with another woman, sitting across from De Niro. what De Niro's profession was before he retired. The solitary traveler and her nonsensical guesses (making birds and stones) seem superfluous but can be interpreted as having a more profound meaning since we see another single parent, one who most likely suffers from dementia, traveling alone and who probably does not have a lot of contact with her family, assuming that she has one. This drives home the tragic reality of the elderly who are inevitably abandoned by their children, in much the same way De Niro is.",1428019200,2,2661,4.85054945054945
4060034,3,B0032BWL10,"Very good acting by De Niro, however the character was very unusual and unbelievably clueless.",1428019200,,94,5.333333333333333
4060035,4,B0032BWL10,"Good acting.  Different story line.  I cared about the main character.  But...this is a sad movie! I was expecting something more light-hearted from the trailer.  My 15 year old daughter said a few times through out the movie, ""This is so sad!""  I think what makes it almost unbearable in it's sadness is how understated it is played.  It is not melodramatic. It feels real.  It made me want to call my parents just to say hello and let them know they are not forgotten or out of my life's loop.",1428019200,,495,4.373626373626373

4060622,4,B0032BWL10,"Tender, poignant, deeply affecting look at a family that tries to spare each other pain at the expense of the truth. This is not a scenery-chewing, no-holds-barred performance from DeNiro, but instead very restrained, understated, and powerful - he does more with the twitch of an eyebrow than most actors can do with their whole repertoire of effects. Casting overall is good but Barrymore & DeNiro so effortlessly outclass the others that it almost isn't fair. The distance between their superb performances and the very good others is what made me give this four stars instead of five.  If this movie doesn't make you call your dad (or mom or sibling or somebody else you love), nothing will.",1422144000,,695,4.889830508474576

De Niro wanders through as usual no script is too crappy for him to sign on.  Only for failed parents who raised their children to exceed their own life expectations.  So many false notes: Frank worked in a factory, but is too stupid to realize his bag has wheels and a pull out handle?  So he carried the bag all over? Bulls***.

The children grew up feeling distant toward him because of the superficial relationship that had been fostered. When their mother died they stopped visiting  and talking with the befuddled father.

4060742,4,B0032BWL10,"Robert DeNiro and cast turn in fine performances in this portrayal  of the modern family. The title is ironic in several ways, most notably as a reflection of the lies that we tell ourselves and others in order to spare each other from pain or worry. After all, isn't that what we tell everyone? Everyone's fine, no matter what is really going on.

Perhaps a larger theme is simply the disconnection that we all sometimes feel from those with whom we should be closest. It is obvious that the members of this family care greatly for each other, but have forgotten how to actually connect. although parts of the plot may seem a bit contrived or overly foreshadowed, the film does make us consider our current relationships with family and friends and perhaps question the depth.",1420070400,,777,4.705882352941177
4060743,4,B0032BWL10,"I enjoyed this touching film about a family dealing with loss, regret and grown children as they move on and create their own chapters in their lives and the importance of circling back to each other.",1420070400,,200,4.583333333333333
4060763,5,B0032BWL10,"I know many will view this movie as very slow paced but just be patient, this movie will get you to reevaluate everything that you do in your nuclear relationship.  This movie is about family and is an honest, realistic portrayal of what happens in families globally. I could recognize patterns that occur in many families.

How many of you can relate to these happenings?, for example, asking to speak to your  mum when you call the phone, sharing details of your life with your mum (good and bad) while your dad gets to only hear of your positive achievements etc.

It showed that dads have a lot of feelings too and crave that intimacy that many have with their mums.  Dads' might be hard on their  children but often this hardness is from a place of fear.  Children lie to their dads but often those lies are from a place of fear - that fear of disappointing your dad.

This movie is an emotional tearjerker.  I recommend it highly.",1420070400,,936,4.458823529411765

4060918,5,B0032BWL10,"Robert DeNiro plays Frank Goode, the father of four who is trying to emotionally connect with his adult children shortly after his wife passed away. He arranges a get together but each of his children make excuses why they can not attend. Frank realizes life is precious and all too short and he wants to express his true feelings of love to his family which he found hard to do in the past. He realizes his role as head of the household and breadwinner placed him into a distant second to his wife, in whom his children confided. Due to his health problems, he wants to reestablish and strengthen the family bonds. He wants to ensure his family understands how important they are to him before it is too late and with this goal in mind, he ventures forth to visit all of his adult before it is too late. His adult children moved away from home to distant parts of the country to pursue their passions and build their lives, he decides to visit each one to see how they are doing.

From Elmira, NY Frank visits New York City to his eldest son's apartment but his son does not answer the door, apparently he is not at home. Frank had called him many times by phone but there was no answer so he resorted to the surprise visit. He placed an envelope beneath the door, with a photo of the family as children and a note to his son. Since he hates to fly airplanes, Frank decides to take a Greyhound bus trip across country to see his other three children, Robert, whom he believes is a musical conductor in an orchestra, Rosie who live in Las Vegas and is pursuing her dream job as a performing artist, and Amy, a happily married mom living out West. The film masterfully conveys emotion and meaning through flashbacks which portray Frank's memories of his children when young and growing up. These film clips highly effectively peel away the layers of time to expose Frank's love and caring tender attitude as a father much more strongly than if described in words.

Needless to say, Frank learns that his children were holding back much information about themselves which he recalls was not the case with their mother. They talked to her about their personal lives and revealed themselves, opened up in ways they never did with him. He sees they incorporated the valuable and difficult lessons he taught them about life and they have made their own path in the world, expressing themselves as they discover their strengths and survival skills. After discovering Robert is not the conductor but rather is a percussionist in the orchestra (he plays the drums) which suits him just fine, Frank is told Robert is leaving on tour with the orchestra which cuts the visit with his father short. Frank leaves on the bus to travel further out west to visit his daughter Amy. Amy calls Robert that their dad was not on the bus as expected. A series of phone calls ensues, with messages left back and forth, trying to track down the location of their dad. He had missed the correct bus due to a time zone change and hitched a ride on a truck which got him to the railroad station that had a connection to Las Vegas. Rosie ( played by Drew Barrymore) went all out to impress her dad with her successful career in Las Vegas, she rented a stretch limousine which drove them to her high rise penthouse suite. However, Frank overheard an answering machine message left by the owner of the suite that he was returning early. Again, Frank awakened to the fact that his daughter was not being honest and open with him. Gradually, over a spaghetti dinner,  they had a heart to heart talk about the past and the truth about her life was revealed to him. Frank was not shocked or disappointed. All that mattered to him was that her life was on course and that she was happy.

He decided to go back to New York earlier than anticipated and allow his children lead their own lives, satisfied they were doing well, but he had misgivings about David, his eldest from whom he had not heard. Out of character for him, he chose to return to NY by airplane, even though he hated to fly. He did not reveal to any of them a mishap which occurred at the railroad station, where his medication was spilled and crushed. While in fight, he looked out the airplane window and saw storm clouds and lightening. The stewardess reassured him, the pilot would fly around the storm, not through it and that it was safe to do so. During a bit of turbulence, Frank went to the bathroom and experienced what seemed like a panic attack but he was clutching his chest and was short of breath. The stewardess sensed a problem since he did not return to his passenger seat. An ambulance met them as the landed which drove Frank to the hospital.

Frank is lying in the hospital bed, surrounded by his children when he awakens. He senses their love and concern but eminently feels the absence of David, his eldest son. He confronts his children and elicits they answer his questions about David, with the whole truth. Amy tenderly and carefully tells him, David died of an overdose in Mexico, around the time he was visiting  his children out west. When Frank falls asleep he experiences a flashback of David as a child receiving instructions from his father. Frank also has a vision of David as an adult, waving good-bye and reassuring him, he was a good father and David's death had was not his father's fault. After he is released from the hospital, there is a poignant scene when Frank visits the cemetery where his wife is buried and he talks with her about the family. The final and last scene is the family reunion Frank had originally planned: a Thanksgiving dinner in Elmira, New York, in the house where they grew up. This time, all three of his children and their offspring are present, with David and their mom there in spirit. Despite all the changes in their lives, the family is together and the bonds are strong if not stronger than ever before. This is a most touching and realistic film about what matters most in life: family, love and acceptance. Erika Borsos [pepper flower]",1419206400,,6041,4.527472527472527

The acting was phoned-in for the most part; the plot was essentially a train and bus travelogue and the script had the adult siblings portrayed as lying, conniving yet successful gen-Xers who had virtually no reason to do the 'twists' that the plot unveiled.

Not very believable plot that four children of a middle class family would all turn out to have heavy problems... that they were keeping from their widowed father. Sad, dysfunctional family life is not entertaining. Also a few places of highly unnecessary F-word + JC -- an indicator of bad writing, bad directing, bad acting or all three combined = could not portray emotion without resorting to the gutter.

It is that and way more because between the lines is a potent messsage to parents of young kids and what is so often overlooked in raising them until they are grown and its too little too late. Parents ... listen to the heartcry. Pay attention to each precious life God has blessed you to raise. Even if you have a bunch, God will help you( if you ask Him) to do the little things that really matter and the big things- like pressing into their world, not as an intruder or critic but as the loving mom or dad they really need.

It may motivate some folks to get closer. I would hope. Good acting. Tough to watch. DeNiro is great, as usual.

4061436,5,B0032BWL10,"Moving, well-paced film with stellar performances by all.  I can't improve on what other reviewers have said.  Even though I give it 5 stars, my reason for leaving a review is to express my opinion that I don't think this film is nearly tragic or gut-wrenching ENOUGH.

***SPOILER ALERT*** It seems to me it takes a lot longer for most people to recover from the death of a loved one than mere months.  None of the family members' reactions to death seem to me proportionate to the profundity of their loss.  DeNiro's character, Frank Goode, in particular would've been gutted by his wife's death.  It was made clear, though subtly, that although he had difficulty expressing it, Goode adored his wife and children, the kind of man who cherished photos of them and thought of them when they were small, who remembered small incidents from their childhoods.  I doubt very much that such a man would've recovered from his wife's death in such a short time, much less have been emotionally prepared to take on his children's serious problems.

This would've been easily remedied by having more time elapse between the mother's death and De Niro's trip.  And I think all concerned would've displayed MUCH more angst over the personal and family crises that followed (a brilliant, much more realistic depiction of the far-reaching effects of a death in the family is shown in Robert Redford's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ordinary-People/dp/B0018RE7GM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ordinary People</a>).

I'm nitpicking, it's still a fine film, more emotionally revealing than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/About-Schmidt/dp/B00AP8XC02/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">About Schmidt</a>&nbsp;(which I also liked very much, but Frank Goode is a far more sympathetic, appealing character than Warren Schmidt).  Robert DeNiro, Kate Beckinsale, Drew Barrymore, and Sam Rockwell are all favorites of mine and deliver subtle yet powerful performances.  What's best about the film is sharing in Frank Goode's unraveling of the mysteries of his children's lives, and the ending ties up the loose ends in a satisfying (if formulaic) way.  Thematically, below the surface, it reminded me a lot of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pieces-of-April/dp/B000IZW4UQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pieces of April</a>&nbsp;(a nearly perfect film, imo).  There's hope for us all.",1416700800,,2475,6.054441260744985

4061438,5,B0032BWL10,"You guys. This was such a good movie I can't even handle it. You can feel what the characters are feeling. Maybe I had one to many beers, or maybe it's the social worker in me, but the emotions of the characters are displayed so perfectly, that there is no way you can watch this without your heart being touched. I bawled my eyes out from the emotions, regret, and love of the father. Yet I was able to see the way he was touched by his kids and I felt his love for them to the point where I was smiling through my tears. Never have I ever before loved a movie so much, even though there is so much sorrow, hurt, and unanswered love that is experienced in this short glimpse of an hour and a half movie that isn't even real.
If you want to watch a movie with the deep love of a father that shines beyond the human fallibility that holds so many back, watch this. If you want to see the way children love by trying to please the ones who love them most, watch this. If you want to bawl your eyes out, watch this.

The movie trades in an interesting concept of a father getting to know his children after his wife passes away, in for a strange and heavy handed guilt fest about pushing your children too hard.  Unfortunately this is portrayed rather poorly as most of the kids are successful in fields of work where very few people succeed.  To illustrate, his children are: a successful artist, a Vegas performer with a child and a relationship (both hidden from a blue collar father who encouraged his children to pursue the arts? ), a percussionist for the symphony,  and a co-owner of a successful advertising company who has moved on froma marriage to an unfaithful spouse.
The fact that the father blames himself for his artist son's drug overdose was the final nail in the coffin. Overall it came across as a cautionary tale about encouraging your children to follow their dreams with hard work.",1416355200,,988,4.699421965317919

It's a story about a dad who really loves his kids, but really wasn't engaged in hearing their fears and really listening to them as they grew up. Now, as a recently widowed husband and a recently retired worker, he is trying to connect with his kids because he is now lonely, has nothing to do, and looks back on the sweet days when his kids we're little and in the house.  This is a great movie for parents today-a parable warning against desiring our kids' success as a means to their happiness, instead of desiring their happiness as the end goal. Wonderful story with wonderful acting.  Bitter, sweet, realistic, sad, and heartwarming. Watch this film!",1415923200,,773,4.676470588235294

It just took me a bit to realize it. Being a father with adult children I really related to De Niro's character. Alone now that his wife has passed he tries to connect with each of his children. He is excited with the expectation that he will have all his children home for a visit and we witness all his preparations to make his children feel special. Then, one by one they call him. As each tell him why they cannot come we experience the disappointment he feels. What follows is a heart rending story that comes together as a film masterpiece.",1415836800,,723,4.246376811594203

and in this one, he reminded me a whole lot of my dearly departed dad
so for me, it was a must see. The other actors all did a fine job as well and the
premise of the film is a solid one, that of ""protecting"" our loved ones from the truth.
As is often true for me, I would have loved to see this film with 15-20 minutes cut
out of it. The writing was competent enough but it just kind of plodded along.
With some tighter cutting, I think the pace would have been lifted up enough to
make it more successful. All that being said, I'm glad I watched it. DeNiro is
wonderful in it, doesn't have to shoot or intimidate anyone, and that is enough for me.",1415836800,,722,3.986206896551724

 If you are a DiNero fan, you will appreciate his ability to bend in directions not usually seen. DiNero shows hi tender and vulnerable side. I enjoyed it and would recommend it.

The movie shows the break down of communication between father and children (like most kids, we went to our moms with stuff; not dad), his work ethic is strong; working hard for them to be happy in life and just wants the children to use their gifts when they grow up, mom is deceased and dad wants to see them all so he takes a trip ( they all lie to him). I enjoyed this movie  loved the way the director/writer used dad's job throughour the scenes, however, just like all hollywood movies homosexuality ( the agenda) makes its appearance. You know their are many families  in this world and not all have a homosexual person in their family. Just once can Hollywood ty to make a movie without the adultery, homosexuality, cross gender, cussing in front of young gandson etc. the last movie I saw with Robert de Niro also had all of the above, so maybe I will steer clear of his movies.

It is a heart break for me to imagine but so real that just like the Harry Chapin song, CAT IN THE CRADLE, our kids get too busy, don't want to see us and the loneliness that we consequently feel. Drew Barrymore plays a beautiful role as a daughter that goes out of her way to take care of her Dad's feelings rather than share her reality..It is a must se for all parents of adult children. Have the Kleenex handy, just in case!",1410393600,,795,4.037974683544304

This is a very low-key role for him, but it gives him the ability to demonstrate how easily he can become a character and make you believe in what that character is doing and how he is feeling.

At the end of the movie, you are left thinking about your relationships with your immediate family, and that's the entire point of the movie. It accomplished its goal and the experience was enjoyable as well.",1409702400,,552,4.298076923076923

We have our own thoughts on what and how we think about our children on how they might show respect for us for what we have done for them, and yet it doesn't always work out the way we expect it will.

How our children disengaged from their parents, how thing can be twisted and not what we think. The movie flows with feelings and careful thoughts. All actors play out beautifully. The cover is so misleading as I was thinking of another Robert De Niro's empty funny comedy like the Fockers. What a surprise! Recommended for the older folks.

Extraordinarily nuanced performance from Robert DiNiro, and good performances from other cast members including Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell.  DiNiro is a hard working retired dad who is reconnecting with his grown kids.

This is particularly a good film for Father's Day or Christmas.  As families grow and spread out, it is difficult to get everyone together.  This cross country trip is visually interesting and the interaction between parent and adult children can be priceless.  This film is a moderate paced with rich characterizations -- those who like snappy pacing and lots of visual action will be disappointed.  Theme song is by Paul McCartney and the DVD bonus is a featurette with McCartney on how he created the theme music which is also very interesting.",1409356800,,867,5.15

His loneliness after his wife dies, his expectations that are not fulfilled, his hard work to provide for his children's education, yet his not understanding that what he wanted for their 'success' might not be what they wanted; rather typical mindset of some of the post WWII generation.

The performances were all above par, from the four main characters all the way down to the most minor roles. Every character seemed genuine and believable, and no performance or any other aspect of the entire film seemed at all contrived. The story, about a strong-willed father and his four children's lives, is yours to like and/or dislike. As for the screenwriting, there were elements of the story that did not please every part of my palate, so to speak, but I can honestly say that about most films I watch. An example was the inclusion of some gratuitous profanity spoken by DeNiro's character that seemed, well, out of character. The pace was perfect, and by that I mean that it appeared to move slowly, but was actually very steady, almost quick. Overall, my wife and I enjoyed the movie and the story.

4062501,3,B0032BWL10,"With the holiday season now in full swing, this time of year can prove to be a little stressful for people.
Between the party planning and figuring out what gifts to buy, in addition to normal day-to-day activities, it
can be a tense time of year. And the thing that makes it most tense of all, worse than the crowds at the mall
or writing all of those holiday cards, is the one unavoidable element  family.
Luckily for us, there is a little thing called the movies, which enjoy reminding of us that family is truly a
shared experience. For better or worse, family is there to help us through the tough times, whether they be a
road trip to a beauty pageant (Little Miss Sunshine), to balancing a life of crime (The Godfather saga) and
even to taking road trips (The Griswolds in the National Lampoon series), Hollywood likes to remind us that
its not just your family that is dysfunctional. Its everybodys.
Everybodys Fine, a remake of an Italian film with the same title, follows Frank, a widower who sets off on
a road trip to reconnect with his grown children. Played by Robert De Niro, Frank discovers that for the past
few years his children have been keeping him in the dark about their issues. He now is on a mission to get
his family together for the holidays, no matter how difficult it seems.
There are times the film is overly sentimental, but the performances keep it from getting completely sappy.
Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell play three of the children and their performances,
along with De Niro, are worthwhile. It would have been nice if there was a bit more humor at times, but the
relationships are true and do lead to a natural (though fairly obvious) conclusion.
So this year, even if the dinner table seems a little tense, just take a deep breath and remember  you are in
good company.",1408406400,,1827,4.550151975683891

(And sure, by something better I mean leaving a three star negative review, then going back weeks later and editing that negative review, keeping it at three stars, but changing the wording because Amazon just gave us the option to report wrongly categorized movies. Thanks Amazon!)

The story sucked, but the acting was great. DeNiro's character was lovable, and of course he played it wonderfully. The supporting actors supported him very well!

SPOILER ALERT!

The whole plot is based on a web of lies between family members. One reviewer called the story of the missing son an ""unnecessary subplot"". That reviewer was wrong. That IS the plot. It is simply covered by lies from the very beginning. They finally tell the truth in the end and it is gut wrenching. It may get boring, but hang in there. You don't want to miss the terrible ending!

I get the idea of what the directors wanted to communicate (husband loses his wife and tries to reach out to his grown children who have all moved away), but with so much talent to work with, what a disappointment.  The movie started o.k., with DeNiro getting ready for all his children to come home for a reunion, but then it just is coincidental that all 4 of his children cancel on him (I buy one or two, but not all 4 at the same time).  Then the movie really didn't go anywhere.  Was trying to show Robert reaching out to connect to his children who he did not spend much time with while they were growing up.  Robert DeNiro's character doesn't hold up...., he is bumbling and incompetent and disconnected to the point of ridiculousness.  It is one of those movies where you hope it is going to get better, and it never does.  If you want to watch a great movie with some of the same motif, try Playing by Heart - has a similar great cast, and delivers (4 1/2 stars)",1406073600,,1039,4.190954773869347

Its the kind of sadness that comes from deep honesty unlike the happy-go lucky films that paints life as quirky perfection. Its the story of a father who discovers that the life of his kids are not perfect. Its also the story of siblings who fear disappointing their father because their lives are not picture perfect. Its a beautiful story that will have you drop a tear or two by the end. Its not a depressing film nor is it a tragic tale, its just about family.",1405814400,,598,4.254385964912281

Those scenes where he's looking at his adult children as they were when they were younger is perfection (not a new technique but seamlessly done in a way that provokes such emotion). As Robert's talking to strangers on his trip we feel the loneliness he's feeling about his wife's death and the ""loss"" of his children. We're being told a story with characters that are well developed and told of the true details through Roberts all knowing dream; it's hard to imagine he wasn't a good father. He clearly wanted the best for his children but was maybe too tough and not as nurturing as his wife was. Very well developed story line.

Consequently, the kids and dad never really connected and the kids have grown to be as self-involved as their dad was. Stung by their neglect, he begins a moving journey of self-discovery to try and reconnect. But as good as De Niro's work is here, the script simply doesn't do the story justice.

After the death of his wife, a father seeks the love and company of the grown children he and his wife shared. The now adult kids are less than happy with dad coming to see them after they, one by one, cancelled their plans to visit with him. Undaunted by how they hurt him, thinking that their father can't see through their lies, they go on lying and avoiding him until father has a heart attack.

4062606,3,B0032BWL10,"In 2009's ""Everybody's Fine"" Robert De Niro plays a widower who is down because his four kids all canceled on coming home for Thanksgiving, so he decides to go see each one instead (Kate Beckinsale, Sam Rockwell and Drew Barrymore respectively). This entails traveling all over the country over the next week or so.

I don't get all the positive ratings on this one. Sure, it's well made, has a great cast and makes a good point, but it's just humdrum from beginning to end. Maybe the story works better for those who can relate to De Niro's character, but for everyone else this is a really slow and boring road movie. Being boring is the ultimate sin in cinema.

4062620,2,B0032BWL10,"I'm dismayed to realize that this film was written by the same folks that gave us ""Waking Ned Devine"", which was a warm and funny film, and a fun story.  This movie is like ""About Schmidt"" the Lite Version.  Like Jack Nicholson's character, DeNiro's Mr. Goode is recently widowed (although the wife passes before the movie starts);  she's the one who kept in touch with the kids.  So, alienated widower dad goes on a road trip to visit each of his kids, with an envelope for each;  and nobody knows he's coming.  Surprise!

Well, Surprise on him actually because one of his sons is in trouble, but no one wants to tell Dad.  And, Dad's afraid of flying so he starts out on a train bound for NYC, and there we learn that he made the PFC covering for the wires that run along the track, the road, and all over America.  At that point the viewer begins to suspect this movie was conceived on a commuter train as the writer, or someone, watched the gently swooping visual rythym of the wires running alongside the tracks.  Then, as much of the plot is advanced, and the audience brought up to speed with what was set in motion before we got in front of the TV, by way of telephone conversations we (the audience) overhear while the camera focuses in on the overhead wires, we began to think that this whole plane phobia is also a plot device.

So, Dad shows up and nobody can spend any time with him, because they've all got plans to go out of town, including one of his daughters, who is headed to Mexico to find their brother.  But no one tells Dad.  Dad, meanwhile gets his heart meds crushed, which one immediately suspects is also just another plot device, and sure enough, he ends up in the hospital after refusing the sensible idea of going to a pharmacy and getting another Rx.  Now he has a dream of his aged, widowed self, at a picnic table in his back yard, with his kids, as kids, but explaining why they never tell him the truth about anything, and the audience is finally as much in the know as pretty much anybody else.

So, Dad goes home.  By plane.  Why not?  We don't need the wires anymore.  There's a bit more, but you'll want something fresh to nibble on if you watch this.

My partner and I both come from similar families.  Mine won't talk about bad news, his simply says ""Everything's Fine"" even if someone just had a heart attack.  But even with that personal connection this film just doesn't work as anything more than fluff.  Again, I point to ""About Schmidt"" where a similar character, played by Jack Nicholson, in a similar situation, heads out in a motorhome he and his wife bought for vacations he never wanted to take; to see his daughter as she prepares to marry a truly flaky fiance;  but the mother in law is a hoot.  Along the way Jack nearly becomes a homewrecker, in a trailer park.  Things happen, people don't work out.  In this film a nice little romance is suggested and then abandoned.  He hits all the conventional spots along the road (except for Seattle) and...yawn...the movie ends with, well I can't tell you that.

There are a lot of terrible movies out there.  Anything with Adam Sandler, for example.  So this isn't Bad, it just isn't very good either.  Like Kool Aid instead of nice fresh juice.  I'd put it off so you can see the stuff you've been putting off, and if you forget about it, well, so be it.  Or maybe watch it with Shirley MacLanes ""Carolina"", which is slightly better, Kool Aid with Seven Up.  They would make a nice shut-in afternoon, this winter during a storm, or this fall in a hurricane shelter.",1347580800,,3565,4.4156441717791415
4062621,1,B0032BWL10,"This movie can serve as an illustration of how Hollywood corruption works. Obviously, all Hollywood fare is not_pure_evil; the BKs who run Tinsletown wouldn't make enough money to come near slaking their insatiable avarice if they_only_put out movies like ""American Pie"" or the ""Saw"" franchise. Everyone knows that family movies (rated PG-13, PG and G) bring in the most money. However, these evil men who control the movie industry just can't resist inserting at least a smidgen of their  poisonous values into even the most innocent movies.  We've all noticed it: the sexual innuendo in the children's cartoon; the gratuitous nudity in the historical drama; the vulgar profanity in the kids' adventure; the glorification of immoral relationships, or at least their portrayal as something totally ok; the mockery of the traditional family, of parental authority, of religion; and just the basic inversion of decency and American Christian mores in almost every product Hollywood offers. The dream masters of Hollyweird just have to spit in our faces a little bit, even when serving us otherwise wholesome fare. I don't know about you, but just a little bit of poison in my meal spoils the whole dish.

This is a movie about a recently widowed man whose far-flung children stand him up on a planned family get-together. The father sets out on a cross country trip to visit them and discovers that none of them are doing as well in their relationships or careers as they had claimed. The moral of the story, as we are later informed, was that the father pushed them too hard when they were kids, so now they lie to him to live up to his expectations. That in itself is a bit problematic as a moral, but... whatever. The aforementioned Hollywood corruption manifests itself in 1. the daughter's lesbian relationship, which the family ends up accepting as perfectly normal, and 2. by some pretty shocking blasphemies. I have known some pretty profane people, and I have never heard any of them say ""F***ing Christ"". I don't think Bobby DeNiro uttered such a phrase in ""Goodfellas"" or ""Casino"", but he says it here in this PG-13 family drama, playing a grandfather speaking to his grandson. Is it a Cabbalistic thing? Or is it just plain malice and perversion? Do these people really get off so much on forcing mainly Christian audiences to hear their God blasphemed like that?",1343692800,6,2373,4.912718204488778

4062626,4,B0032BWL10,"This movie was nothing special . . . it was a story that millions could tell. But was a good, honest story. And because millions can identify in some way it is worth seeing. The topic has been covered many times but never gets tiring. And this is a fresh take as it is from the perspective of, not mom, not a woman, but a man--dad. This perspective seems to be lost since ""liberation"", since the 70s, 80s, and beyond. While it would be easy for someone of my age to not know better I have seen movies before this 70s, before my time, and realize that since then things are usually told from a woman's perspective. I think the movie would have been a classic if not for two sections: 1) DeNiro's cursing Christ while golfing with the grandkid . . . . I am aware that some people, in particular, in a certain region of the US, use Christ's name as a curse word, they should be as PC as they claim and realize it is really offense to others--to Christians. and 2) the ""ghost""/imaginary scene in the hospital toward the end . . . it added nothing and kinda cheapened the point that we, the viewer, had been taken to at that point. It was enough to hear DeNiro's character's doubts at that point and then to hear the real truth later with the telephone pole painting scene, if felt. Anyway it was a cute story. Sad. Very sad. But a good ending that didn't leave you feeling despair but that, while things weren't great, that they were/would be ""fine"".",1324684800,,1446,4.3003663003663
4062627,1,B0032BWL10,"Say what you will, and cast this review aside if you must, but Hollywood has an agenda. And this film drives that agenda all the way home, pardon my alluding to the final scene.
To make my point, I challenge anybody to find a ""chick flick"" i.e. romantic comedy released in the last 10 years or so that doesn't have some overt promotion or acceptance of homosexuality. I suspect you will come up with only about one in five. It is part of the LGBT public policy targeting.
Well, Kirk Jones certainly has placed that in this story (although not a romantic comedy), particularly in the character of daughter Rosie played by Drew Barrymore. But more than that, just as this group of siblings constantly lies to father Frank (Robert DeNiro), Mr. Jones is misleading his audience about fatherhood and family values. Sadly, this too appears to be an Hollywood agenda. DeNiro's character is very clearly an average Joe, indeed an amazingly everyday average guy. He worked hard in a factory, then around the house, etc. and ""pushed"" his children to apply themselves so as to become successful adults. Instead, ALL of the kids are a mess, and father's pushing is to blame.
Frankly, if all the fathers in America were as Frank Goode was in this film, we would be a far better place I am sure. Instead, we are like the dysfunctional family who has come home to gather around the table seeking acceptance for what they have become, and in that acceptance will they finally lay their blame of dad and his strict values to rest.
In presenting his agenda film, Mr. Jones couches it all in what I must admit is an astonishingly well acted and directed work. There is not a wasted bit of footage here. DeNiro is incredible, as are all the actors including those who play the ""flashback"" kids. I am saddened that Jones has wasted all this to lie to us, just as Frank's kids lied to him.",1323129600,13,1867,4.559523809523809
4062628,4,B0032BWL10,"Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) has lost his wife; and, consequently, easy contact with his children and grandchildren.  He invites all four of his children to a weekend at his house.  None of them show up.  Each has an excuse, but the main reason is that they don't feel all that close to their father anymore.

In spite of the fact that Goode has pulmonary fibrosis, he decides that if his children won't come to him, he'll go to them.  He decides to surprise them, which lasts about one visit, since the children do talk to each other quite a bit.  So he does a 'planes, trains and automobile' trip to visit each of his children.  The trip starts on a sour note when he discovers that his son David, isn't at his home in New York.

The rest of the film is spent slowly teasing the family dynamics apart.  Many of his children, as well as his late wife, apparently, feel/felt that he was too hard on them, that his expectations were too high.  Yet that must be tempered by the fact that he had no problem what the children did, just that they were successful.  In fact, he wanted them to be very successful.

I immediately thought of the film 'About Schmidt', which came out seven years earlier.  Like this film, Schmidt concerned a retired man who has just lost his wife.  As played by Jack Nicholson, Schmidt had to learn to reconnect with his only child.  That film was a better film, but 'Everybody's Fine' is just about as good.

Solidly recommended.  No violence, no gore, just a great film about family.  Somehow I find those more satisfactory these days than the shoot-em-up films we see too often these days.",1318636800,2,1616,4.4573378839590445

The acting was excellent but the script was a bit ""by the numbers"", although still enjoyable.  A father's unrelenting pursuit of his children while coping with his loneliness, and they with their various crises, reinforced for them his enduring love and support, allaying their fears of being judged for being ""imperfect"".  The need to reconnect before it was too late, was the emotional incentive.",1318636800,,676,5.2407407407407405
4062630,3,B0032BWL10,"It seems to be a trend to dress up sad, even depressing, movies as comedies or as ""feel good"" movies, when in reality, they leave you feeling sad or depressed. Look at the pictures, everyone looks happy; look at the title: ""Everybody's Fine""; even most reviewers will mislead, perhaps believing that it's a spoiler to tell you that this movie involves a tragic death. Yes, the reviewers will tell you that this is a drama and not a comedy but, to me, there's a big difference between a drama where people are dealing with difficult aspects of life and of being human, and one with a tragic death.

And the movie itself, ends with DeNiro's character saying that ""everybody's fine"". Dead is fine??? I know of a parent who lost her grown son to a tragedy, she would never have said, at the first holiday after his death, that everybody's fine. That's the weakness of movies like this one, besides their misrepresentation which could be considered a lack of truth in advertizing, they also misrepresent the profound feelings that are natural in situations like this. Yes, they show sadness when the characters first learn of the tragedy, but in order to give us a ""feel good"" movie, the character's seem to get over the sadness inhumanly quickly and are laughing and saying things that you wouldn't hear from real live people in those circumstances. While I think it's right and good to have some light moments even in dramas, it should be done realistically.

Having said that, I liked the characters, the acting was good and the story was a good, sad, drama. If that's what you're looking for, go ahead and enjoy this one, just be prepared for parts that don't ring true and that somehow trivialize the pain of loss for a ""feel good"" effect that cannot truly be associated with the situation.",1311033600,,1790,4.67936507936508

4062632,4,B0032BWL10,"Fans of ""making toast"" movies -- those that follow quiet characters during slow-moving day-to-day slices of life -- or characters study films should find quite a bit to like in Everybody's Fine.

On the flip side, this melancholy movie will likely not appeal to those who like power-packed action films.

The basic story is of hard-working Frank (DeNiro) who has sacrificed his life, and even his lungs, to ensure that his children can have the best of what life has to offer. After his wife dies he cross-country drops in on his kids after they blow off a family get together. Each of their lives are in various degrees of turmoil but they all put on a glossy face to please their dad. A crisis brings out honesty and a chance for relationships to be reshaped.

I especially like the telephone theme that played throughout the movie. And Frank's flashback/fantasy/dream sequences where he has grown-up conversation with his small children.

I won't likely be adding it to my permanent library but it's worth a Netflix or Red Box Rental if you like slow films. Language-wise it's pretty low-key, I think just one scene including an F-Bomb. And though it's melancholy there are touching, hopeful moments.",1296604800,3,1203,4.853658536585366

The film's time trajectory is over a period of weeks and months and only culminates with a Christmas feast.  There is so much said about dysfunctional or disconnected families but there are no alike families in the world.  Each family has it's own unique dynamic and the Goodes as portrayed here are no exception.  Frank Goode (Robert De Niro) recently retired and widowed is looking to gather his four adult children at his home.  Each concoct an excuse not to come.  Since the kids won't come to Frank he'll go to them even though they live on all corners of the U.S.A.  There is an apparent disconnect between Frank and the kids even though by all accounts he was a hard-working and loving provider for his wife and kids.  It just seems that Frank's traditional role was as bread-winner and his wife provided the psychic nurturing.  With her passing there is a definite void in the family and Frank's journey becomes both physical and one of self-discovery.  The cast here is uniformly great but it's De Niro's show.  In a subtle yet no less masterful turn De Niro demonstrates the evolution Frank makes.  Director-writer Kirk Jones script is no less knowing and insightful.

DeNiro gives a wonderfully touching performance as a father who maybe pushed his kids a little too hard to achieve their dreams when they were young and they seem to avoid him because they feel they might not have lived up to his expectations.

What is most impressive besides DeNiro in this film is that it never feels forced and we are slowly let into the world of this family. It's a sad film, but very rewarding and worth the trip if you don't mind shedding a few tears along the way.",1288569600,4,637,4.137096774193548
4062638,4,B0032BWL10,"I am going to try not to go into plot, but just why I liked and didn't like the movie.

So I watched this movie the first time thinking that it was a comedy because of the trailer. This movie is hardly a comedy first of all, but you knew that from the other reviews already. I thought it was just ok, partly because I was expecting to laugh not grab tissues.

I recently watched this movie again, via cable, and I gave it a second chance to see if I got something different from it the second time around, because this time I knew what to expect, drama not comedy.

Watching it a second time, I remembered why I liked it. First off I loved Robert De Niro in this movie. I always forget that this is man that also portrayed the serial killer in Cape Fear. In Everybody's Fine he plays a father that was stern (not abusive, just expected only the best, and seemed to shun the mediocre) that was then broken down to a much more approachable father-figure after his wife passes and after having a heart problem, which is the where the movie starts. Robert was great so I move on...

The kids, Kate Beckinsale (Amy) , Drew Barrymore (Rosie), Sam Rockwell (Robert), Austin Lysy (David). The actors played each role well, no problems with that. Based on the plot you know they wind up covering up their stories with an I am Fine Version, and a heightened lifestyle to make their father happy.

The real problem I had with this movie is one scene. The table scene with all the kids is the best scene of the movie, but it does not come without a few questions. With that said, I feel like they could have done away with it and made something much more approachable to the viewer. Its placed in the movie time-wise correctly but as far as the filming of that scene there is some detachment from the rest of the movie, and yes I know it is supposed to because of the story, but it just doesn't visually fit in the movie. Production had this great scene and they just didn't want to part with it, and I could tell. It did not, however, effect my tear factor, but still, even the second time around I just couldn't get over how it did not fit in the movie. Don't get me wrong, it is not the content of that scene, it is just the way the scene is played out, the content is what ties up everything else, but there is something about it I just really question. But anyways, I can't think of a better scene to fill with it, so I move on... (it does make me want to read the book, if there is one.)

My second favorite scene is the hospital night scene. Without spoiling the movie I will just say that this made more tears flow.

The movie gets 4 stars, because to me, it wasn't amazing, but it was really well done. In general I would recommend the movie because I did enjoy it, and the actors portrayed the family genuinely.",1287532800,2,2809,4.219739292364991

The casting was perfect, the story line very real, and it portrayed scenarios most families can relate to in one way or another. I read the more negative reviews and completely disagree.  I didn't see anything on the cover that said it was a comedy.  I read the description on the back, so I knew it was going to be a serious film.  Basically, if you are a person who enjoys well rounded ""real life"" movies that touch your soul, this will be a movie you will enjoy.",1287360000,2,515,4.278350515463917
4062640,3,B0032BWL10,"One thing that I am most grateful for when it comes to `Everybody's Fine' is that it proves once again that Robert DeNiro is a great actor.  For anyone who is convinced that, like his counterpart Al Pacino, DeNiro is washed up and reduced to a mere caricature of his former self needs to set some time aside to watch this small, intimate and earnest little film.  The film itself is not a great movie (it is layered with too many clichs to be great) but DeNiro sheds his usual `tough guy' persona and delivers something honest and relatable, heartbreaking and beautiful.

His best performance in nearly a decade, easy.

The film tells the story of a widower, Frank, who can feel his family (which consist now of four grown children) slipping through his fingers.  They are all set to come visit him for Thanksgiving and they all wind up canceling.  This sparks something in Frank, moving him to avoid doctor's orders and hightail it cross country to see his children, all of which seem too busy or preoccupied to spend time with him.  That, and they are all apparently lying to him about everything.  As Frank visits his children (surprise, daddy's home) he uncovers truths about them and also about himself.

There are moments here that really speak to the audience, but they are sadly muddled by clichd generalizations and a choppy subplot involving a wayward son that only works part of the time.  Still, the overall effect of the film is light and warming and it really should be seen.  It didn't get the reception it deserved (everyone was predicting a DeNiro Oscar nom shortly before the film was released and then, well, that didn't even come close to happening).  DeNiro alone is just magnificent here and totally deserving of the praise and attention.  The rest of the cast works well with him, from Barrymore to Rockwell to Beckinsale.  I only wish that the film allotted for more time with each child.  Frank is rushed off so quickly that we really only get glimpses of his children and the impact they have on him.  If they had only been fleshed out a little more than this film could have transcended the lighthearted genre it pegged itself and it could have been something deeper, more meaningful.

But I get the feeling that this is exactly what they were going for, and on that front they succeeded.

In the end I totally recommend this, especially to anyone who has been a fan of DeNiro over the years and is longing to see him do something worthy of his name once again.  This is for DeNiro what `About Schmidt' was for Jack Nicholson, only `About Schmidt' was a much better film.",1287360000,7,2598,4.608695652173913
4062641,5,B0032BWL10,"I want to make something clear before writing this review- Everybody's Fine is most certainly NOT a comedy.  It's in fact, quite the opposite.  The description might lead you to think otherwise, but it's actually a really emotional drama story.

Normally I'm not a fan of Robert De Niro, however whenever he stars (or plays lead role) in a family-oriented film, I'm always very interested in them.

I suggest if you're someone who either worries or constantly thinks about your family -and specifically someone who's always concerned too much time has passed they by and there's no way to go back in time and change things- you should NOT watch this movie because you will most likely be in tears by the time it's over.  The last 20 minutes are especially hard to keep from crying.  This film might be even harder for older folks to watch, seriously.

The storyline is about an old man (played by Robert De Niro) who one day decides to search for his children and find out about their lives, and what they've been up to over the years.  So Robert's character travels across the country and makes unexpected visits to each of his children, and along the way finds out some really shocking things about them.  Let's just say- his kids have definitely changed over the years.

It's one of those films where you really have to pay close attention to all the details in order to notice all the surprising things about his kids, because there's a scene later involving a thunderstorm that might be confusing to understand if you don't pay extremely close attention early on.

Without spoiling anything, the one thing that was never really made clear were the ""in between"" segments whenever Robert De Niro would travel to visit his kids.  You see, there would be these conversations taking place between each of his kids over a telephone.  What was confusing about this is that it was never really clear whether Robert De Niro was actually hearing these conversations, or not.

It's a clever bit of storytelling because it leaves you guessing.  I *assume* he wasn't really hearing his children talking to each other over the telephone, and it could be a case where Robert's character just *knew* anyway because he's an experienced father, and his fatherly instincts kicked in, but I can't be completely sure.

Also, the song that plays over the credits sounds like Paul McCartney, and it's a REALLY good song.  I'm not sure if it's really Paul McCartney singing that song or just a singer who happens to resemble his voice.

Anyway, Everybody's Fine is a magnificent film because it does everything correctly.  It makes you cry, it keeps your attention, and it's definitely a film worth watching.

Update- August 2, 2011- I'm not really sure what exactly I was thinking when I thought Robert De Niro's character was able to hear the telephone conversations taking place through the communication wires- no, I don't believe he was.",1286755200,4,2923,4.796407185628743

4062643,5,B0032BWL10,"Frank Goode(Robert DeNiro), an aging widower, feels lost with his wife gone.  As his days fill up with trivia, he begins to think of his four grown children and how he has failed each of them.  He plans for them all to come visit, and watching him get everything ready for their visit, I felt a sadness.  Somehow, I knew he would be disappointed.

And sure enough, each of the children calls in turn, giving excuses as to why they cannot come.

So instead, Frank determines to surprise them by visiting them, one by one.  He starts out on his journey full of hope.

His oldest son, David, is not home.  And things seem oddly out of sorts in Chicago, at his daughter Amy's house, too (Kate Beckinsale).  In Denver, Robert (Sam Rockwell) has excuses for why they cannot spend more time together, and in Las Vegas, Rosie (Drew Barrymore) seemingly has a perfect life--on the surface.

All kinds of unexpected events occur on this trip, like a homeless person Frank tries to help suddenly turning on him, and in the process, Frank's medication is trampled.  Without his meds, he may not make it.  So he decides to return home.

When a health crisis hospitalizes Frank, three of his children turn up at his bedside, and the truth begins to unfold.

I expected this to be one of those predictably comedic films, with cute family moments, but I was quite pleased to find myself glued to the screen throughout, waiting and hoping for everyone to connect.

In the final scenes, we see the adult children assembled in Frank's home, cooking Christmas dinner.  A nice resolution to some of the family issues.

4062644,1,B0032BWL10,"We watched this movie last night and I kept saying to my husband, this very manipulative movie constitutes a de facto argument for gay child-rearing. This De Niro character seems a ball of horrible parental cliches rolled into one. To such an extent that it seems unfair to straight dads. He is at once unconsciously nasty, disempowering, clueless and self-righteously proud of the misinformation that fills his head. Surely nobody has quite the bases covered in such a throughly even way. That evenness of blunderbuss emotional inappropriateness is what tells you that this movie was from the get-go conceived as a very manipulative affair. They were hoping to have a sort of parent-child Pavlovian effect on as many people as possible and make some dough out of very serious and tender issue. It is pretty disgusting. People who would make a thing like this are probably beyond shame. But for consumers it is worth noting that films as an ""art form"" have apparently made a significant negative progression. They always contained manipulation, but some fellow-feeling or sense of decency prevailed somehow. They tugged at heartstrings to bolster commonly accepted healthful emotions. Or  when they did horror it was horror, and calculated to fulfill other psychic needs of certain age groups. But here is a new low. It tries to spread the psychological complexity so throughly and recklessly that it will likely effect everyone, and then, amazingly tops it off with a cherry of even more blunderbuss misunderstanding. On this note the best scene is when the father character is in a dream sequence at a table with this kids as children, but they are all are spouting adult insights. Naturally, per the sledge-hammer manipulation of the director, the father character is treating them all like children. But the scene seems consciously modeled after Alice and Wonderland sitting at table with the Mad Hatter and other  characters. Except that whereas that famous scene offered artistic insight, this one is like a bull-in-a-china-shop's attempt at a weird  and unlikely table decorum. In other words, it is not the insight that comes from absurdist exaggeration, but the absurdity of pornography, emotional pornography. As if to confirm this very fact the movie ends with the most pornographically absurd moment of all. Having just learned recently that one of his kids died of over-dose, and that he was lied to by his kids who don't trust his maturity one bit, he is moved by all this into even more emotional prevarication. We knew he was not even remotely judging the facts of life accurately when he visited his musician son who is now the percussionist for a major symphony orchestra in Denver. In case anyone is not aware of the classical music world, which is sadly the apparent presumption of the makers of the film, being a percussionist in a major orchestra is a very big deal. And Denver, though not the Boston Symphony, would certainly count. But the father character who is intended to be more a spectral presence that anything emotional real, bizarrely chides the son for settling for ""playing the drums."" Well, this is just hilarious. And by the way I can well imagine virtuoso timpanists, on whom virtually every great symphony ever written rely, just shaking their heads in disbelief, and wanting to strike the gong in their percussion battery if like the gong-show it would get the father character to be pulled off the stage. But no, he has yet greater emotional misprisions to perform. But none as great as the final lines where he tells himself ""Everybody's Fine"". Though a significant percentage of his family fineness is inconvenienced by the fact of  being quite dead, he asserts his right as paterfamilias for delusion. It is such a ghoulish performance all the way around that it really does make you wonder if it is meant to set the mind wondering if there might, perchance, be an alternative to this hyperbolic emotional recklessness of a man like this. Might it be in gay people who are famously, allegedly, more in touch with their emotions. Who knows if this was even in the background. Probably they just wanted to make money. And they found a newly low way to do it.",1284249600,4,4200,4.919605077574048
4062645,4,B0032BWL10,"With baby boomers moving ever closer to the age of retirement, an increasing number of mainstream American moviemakers have taken it upon themselves to deal with the issue (""The Savages"" being probably the most notable example).

The most recent effort is Kirk Jones` ""Everybody's Fine,"" a touching family drama featuring Robert De Niro as a recently widowed retiree whose four adult children have spent their entire lives keeping secrets from him in an effort not to upset or disappoint him.  When the kids can't seem to make the time to come and see him, Frank Goode heads out on the road to pay each of them a surprise visit.  However, Frank doesn't always receive the welcome or the news he was hoping for when he arrives at each of his destinations.  One of his kids, Robert (Sam Rockwell), is a supposedly successful orchestra conductor who is actually just a drummer in the ensemble; another, Amy (Kate Beckinsale), is a high-paid executive whose successful marriage and happy family life are not all that they appear to be on the surface; Rosie (Drew Barrymore) is a dancer in Las Vegas who has a child with her lesbian lover; and, most disturbingly, David is an artist who's currently in jail in Mexico on drug-smuggling charges.  Frank is blissfully unaware of most of these details of his children`s lives, having been sheltered from the facts by both them and his late wife who felt it better not to let him in on the truth.

Though it suffers a bit from its episodic structure and its tendency towards the lugubrious, ""Everybody's Fine,"" which is a remake of an Italian film from 1990, is a generally moving and understated look at parent/child relationships in the 21st Century.  With insightfulness and sensitivity, it explores the various and sundry aspects of the issue:  adult children who are too busy to make time for their aging parents; parents who place burdensome and unrealistic expectations on their children; parents and children struggling to find something to talk about after a lifetime of never really communicating in an open and honest manner.  And, throughout, the movie does a nice job of capturing the discomfiture and awkwardness of strained family relationships.

De Niro effectively blanks himself into the role of a soft-spoken but gregarious man forced to confront some of the mistakes he's made in his life - and he is matched by a first-rate cast.  There are also some impressively mounted scenes, such as a bizarre but strikingly realistic encounter with a young man in a railway station and a hallucinatory dream sequence late in the film that crystallizes much of the movie's purpose and theme for the audience.",1284163200,2,2657,4.908482142857143

4062652,4,B0032BWL10,"Everybody's Fine starring Robert De Niro, Drew Barrymore, Sam Rockwell, and Kate Beckinsale is about a family struggling to stay together after their mother dies and their father is left alone. Robert De Niro plays the patriarch of the family who was a typical 1960s father who focused on his career in order to make money for the family of six. His wife held the connection to their four children and the family's confidante. However, when she dies, De Niro is lost and tries to rekindle his relationship with his children. When he plans a family gathering, all of the children find a way to get out of the reunion. De Niro is distraught that his family is no longer connected as they once were and he decides to take to the road to visit each of his children. His first stop is to his son David who is an artist living in New York City. When David does not answer his father's calls, De Niro decides to move on to his daughter's house where he finds that nothing is as it seems and certainly not as hunky-dory as he had been told. He faces the same situation with his following two children before he returns home even more lost than when he left. Each child blows off their father to the point that he believes they may never be a strong family again. Yet, when tragedy strikes, his children come together to support each other and himself.

This film was touching in all of the ways a good movie should be. It never received any hype when it was in theaters and moved quickly to DVD. I think that this is terrible because I found a great deal more in the film than I found in many of the other movies that came out in 2009. De Niro is fantastic in the role as the lost father helplessly trying to bring his family together. His children's disinterest in him is honest and heartbreaking. It made me want to call my dad and thank him for being a fantastic father. Though the story was heart aching at times, it was truthful and documented a real period in people's lives when children become parents and distance themselves from their own parents for a variety of reasons. Overall, the film is sad and touching with little bits of humor. Hopefully, its DVD release will inspire the public to give it its due.",1274313600,11,2210,4.390243902439025
4062653,5,B0032BWL10,"What a story! What a wonderful tour de force, subtle performance by Robert De Niro, who plays a 60ish widower trying to reconnect with his four grown kids, who are scattered all over the country and oh-so-involved and busy with their own lives. It was not at all what I expected from the commercials, which in my opinion mis-represent the movie, making it appear almost like a dramady with a big family gathering at Dad's house. I think this movie missed its audiences in theaters because of that.

There are some negative reviews here that I don't understand at all, and I'm thinking perhaps this powerful parent-and-child story touched a few raw nerves. It sure as heck did with me. Unfortunately my parents are long gone, so there was no talking to them, but I texted my college boy as I watched the movie, and I talked to my 14 y.o. the next morning, just to tell them I love them and don't want that same kind of distance between us.",1272844800,2,938,4.485380116959064
4062654,1,B0032BWL10,"I loved ""Waking Ned Devine,"" which was written and directed by Kirk Jones, and greatly enjoyed ""Nanny McPhee,"" which was also directed by Jones. So I felt confident that ""Everybody's Fine,"" both written and directed by Kirk Jones, would have humor and heart.

I was dead wrong.

I'm tempted to list a few (trust me, VERY few) spoilers to show how barren this film was of ideas, or even a real story. I could describe everything that happens in a single sentence...but I couldn't tell you why any of it would be considered entertaining, enlightening, moving, or meaningful.

In fairness, I'll say that the first five minutes or so of the film were deceptively good, and DeNiro made me care about his character in that short amount of time. But once he hit the road to see his various children, the production went over a cliff. Characters turned into caricatures, and the few stylistic flourishes only served to show how mundane and unimaginative the other 95% of the film was.

I'd love to know if this movie really turned out the way Kirk Jones wanted it to, or if the Hollywood system somehow corrupted a story and vision that was originally worth sharing. In any event ""Everybody's Fine"" decidedly isn't.",1272067200,8,1207,4.733333333333333

I did quite a bit of sobbing. We chose to watch a comedy afterwards just to recover from this movie. We felt so deeply bummed out through much of it.

Aside from what I believe about heaven, I struggled with how this film used it--it is simply a convenient mechanism for the story to tie together.  It was also painful for me to watch how the children related to their father and vice versa.  There seems to be so much blaming who we are on our parents--and that's essentially what this movie is--one long, long story about blaming who they were on their dad.

4062660,5,B0032BWL10,"""Everybody's Fine"" is a lonely, sad, isolating, realistic, touching, heartbreaking, gut wrenching movie that makes you think about life.  It is not the kind of movie that finds commercial success in most cases because very few people want to go to the movies and feel any of the above mentioned emotions.  Movies are about fantasy and make believe.  Feeling good about life and the guy/girl always ending up together in the end?  Life is not like that in reality.  Kids disappoint, parents make mistakes, tragedy befalls some of us and sometimes we just can't figure out how to make it through the day.

Robert De Niro masterfully plays the recently widowed husband ""Frank Goode"" who in his retirement and finding himself alone reaches out to his four children.  All are set to meet him for the weekend and all four cancel at the last minute.  He busies himself in the garden and house but finds that he needs his family and strikes out on a cross country trip to visit all four.  With his ailing lungs he is unable to fly so by bus and train he begins his trip in New York City.  As a parent you find yourself looking into the eyes of your children and the line between pushing them to success and riding them into submissiveness is blurred.  How far is too far as you want only what is best for your kids.

With each stop along the way it becomes evident that ""Frank"" has lost touch with his children.  With his wife gone so went the glue that bound them together and he struggles flailing about trying to reach for any of the four.  Yes he worked to hard and yes he didn't pay enough attention to the details but in his elderly state is it too late to grasp his children and guide them all back to family bonding?  His kids do not have time for him even after his long excursion to see them and in the end the lies mount up to high to find his way through.  He heads home broken hearted and saddened but the realization that his children not only disappointed him but more importantly he has vastly disappointed himself as a father.  ""Are you happy?""

If Robert De Niro doesn't win some kind of award for his depiction of ""Frank"" I will find it a travesty.  While the move might struggle in the dollars and cents it was masterfully done if not a little slow at times bringing about the realistic family portrayal of life.  The laughs were few and far between and I left the theater feeling my stomach turning from the emotional rollercoaster ride but also left thinking about my life.  How many movies made today really bring a message that one can associate with every day reality?  Can you count them on two hands or maybe even one?

""Everybody's Fine"" is a wonderful movie.  I highly recommend it but I also suggest you take some tissue for the ride.  It is sad and heartwarming but you will leave respecting the elderly and appreciating experience a little more.  Family is insane at times but they are still family.

Of course, you cannot go wrong with DeNiro, his performances are always satisfying but it simply is not enough. There is nothing of interest here.

But their relationships aren't as simple as they once seemed, and Frank's paternal intuition is telling him that his sons and daughters are hiding something from him, and if the Goodes want to become the family they once were, the truth will have to come out before Frank returns home. The supporting players, in this case the adult children, are all beautifully cast. There's no stupidity or attitude in its form, just pure feeling.

This movie stars Robert DeNiro stars in this film directed by Kirk Jones about a retired guy who wants to be close to his children in the same way as they were close to their mother his wife who has recently passed away. Since they have given excuses for not showing up for a family reunion at their childhood home in Elmira NY, he takes upon himself to go and visit them so that he can get to know them and spend time with them. So he sets off hoping that the children have some time for him from their busy successful lives. However the children that he thinks are successful professionally are not. They have had setbacks and failures and they are putting up a brave face for their father. Somehow during the course of the visits and his interactions with his children and their families he realizes that they have not been truthful with him and have never been close to him. Just when you thought that Robert DeNiro was hell bent on destroying his legacy, comes this pleasant movie. Surely this is not among his best but fans of DeNiro and easy paced cinema would not be disappointed. The cast is great and perform their parts well. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy his oldest daughter, Robert his son is played by Sam Rockwell, Rosie is played by Drew Barrymore. His older son is David and we get to see him in only one brief scene towards the end.  I loved this film about reconnecting with your family and loving your parents.

Director Kirk Jones, working with an excellent screenplay, produced a masterpiece as far as I'm conerned.  The story is believable, the scenes, oh so real, and the editing made this one of the top movies to come out in the last five years.

Robert De Niro delivers a GREAT performance and the rest of the cast followed his lead.  I am glad I rented this movie and can't wait to purchase the DVD and watch it again.

Life delivers a lot of twist and turns, and Everybody's Fine showcases how families deal with difficult situations as a family.  After the first fifteen minutes, I was so involved in the movie that I blocked out everything else around me and just enjoyed the story.  I was hoping the movie would just go on and on so I could continue to watch more of De Niro, Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale, and Sam Rockwell work their magic on screen.

4062672,5,B0032BWL10,"What can I say about Robert DeNiro that we don't already know....
In addition to playing some of the most iconic characters of the last 35 yrs in film,
he is in the upper echelon of the greatest actors ever to do it!
He has proven this fact even more in the last 15 yrs, where he has added to his
reportoire of serious & menacing tough guy roles, sharply comedic and deeply emotional
ones as well in which he has proven to be quite effective.
This movie ""Everybody's Fine"" is an emotional tour de force!
Deniro plays an aging father who is recently widowed and counting his own last days as
an undisclosed disease slowly ravages his body. He finds himself lonely and trying to keep
up the good front as he struggles from day to day just with the mundane tasks of life.
His only solace comes in the memories he has of his children, all grown now and living their
own lives in different cities across the country.
When he invites them all home for a cookout/family reunion, he is disappointed
when they all find reasons to cancel one by one because their busy schedules.
What DeNiro's character finds is that in his zeal to see his kids do well in life,
he has in fact pushed them all so hard that they feel alienated from him.
They all found it much more easier to communicate with their deceased mother,
who, like a lot of mothers, handled the affairs of her children's lives as well
her own with seemingly effortless ease. She never shared any bad news with her husband
(their father) regarding the struggles of their kids lives, inadvertently helping
to foster the very detached emotional environment he finds himself in with his kids.
This he doesn't like, as he is now in a reflective state in his life and wanting
and needing his children to be closer to him. So he sets about his own journey
to re-acquaint himself with each one of them, and without giving anymore away,
it suffices to say that it's a journey filled with deep emotion and substance
that will have you shedding more than a few tears before it's all over.
Not only is DeNiro subtle & brilliant in this, but he's supported by an excellent cast
of top shelf actors and actresses who collectively help to bring this film home big time!
These are things that REAL PEOPLE face in EVERYDAY LIFE as we grow older, things
change, we lose our loved ones, and the stresses of the day to day grind pull us
further and further apart from the loved ones who are still alive.
This story is filled with brilliant writing and direction as well
and I warn you, you will be tearing up a few times before it ends!
I rented this movie first to check it out, but I'll defintely be buying it
very soon because it's worth it. I highly recommend this film! (-:",1267833600,51,2707,4.405189620758483
4062673,4,B0032BWL10,"In 2009, British director Kirk Jones (""Everybody's Fine"", ""Nanny McPhee"", ""Waking Ned"") wrote and directed a remake of Giuseppe Tornatore's award-winning 1990 film ""Stanno Tutti Bene"". The film features cinematography by Henry Braham (""The Golden Compass"", ""Nanny McPhee"", ""Crush"") and music composed by Dario Marianelli (""The Soloist"", ""Atonement"", ""The Brave One"").

Where the original film had an operatic tie-in, Jones' film ""Everybody's Fine"" focuses more on a heartwarming family tale about family secrets and moving on after tragedy.

The film revolves around Frank Goode (played by Robert De Niro, ""The Godfather"", ""Taxi Driver"", ""The Deer Hunter"", ""Raging Bull""), the father of four who has kept himself busy taking care of the home after the death of his wife.  His routine is taking care of the garden and taking his heart medication but with the annual family reunion coming up, Frank wants to continue the tradition of what his wife had done for years.

But when he calls his children, the majority of them are unable to come this year and tell him that they are all busy.  So, Frank decides that why not take a road trip and visit each of them and see how they are doing. For Frank, he has been busy all his life working (working on the tubing that are on the telephone wires across America) and thus, his wife took care of the family and he never developed a strong relationship with them.  But hopes he can do it now.

While Frank goes to visit his oldest daughter Amy (played by Kate Beckinsale, ""Serendipity"", ""Underworld"" films"", ""Pearl Harbor""), his son Robert (played by Sam Rockwell, ""Moon"", ""Frost/Nixon"", ""The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford"") and his daughter Rosie (played by Drew Barrymore, ""E.T."", ""Charlie's Angels"" films"", ""Donnie Darko""), all he hopes for his children is happiness.

But somehow during his visit, he realizes that things may not have been going so well and that they have not been truthful with him about their lives.  Also, he is unable to get in touch with his older son David and only the sibling know the reason why.

VIDEO & AUDIO:

""Everybody's Fine"" is presented in Widescreen (2:40:1).  The cinematography by Henry Braham is beautiful.  From capturing the beautiful scenery to capturing the emotions of the top notch cast.  The film through its cinematography captures family's at their best and their worst.

Audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound.  Also, included is a French Language track.  The film is primarily dialogue driven and is front and center channel driven.

Subtitles are in English SDH, French and in Spanish.

SPECIAL FEATURES:

""Everbody's Fine"" comes with the following special features:

  * The Making of Paul McCartney's ""(I Want To) Come Home"" - (9:47) The making of ""(I Want To) Come Home"" and interview with Paul McCartney and how he became part of the film.
  * Deleted & Extended Scenes - A total of seven deleted scenes: Book of Directions, An Artist (Extended Scene), Every Day Is a Storm (Extended Scene), Red River Valley, You Like Hot Dogs?, Airport, I'm Sorry (Extended Scene).

JUDGMENT CALL:

A heartwarming and tragic tale about a man who gets to know his family and realizes he didn't know much about them as he thought.

Robert De Niro absolutely shines in this role, that begs of him to not be a tough man but a father who is realizing his loss but also how his wife kept his family strong but also not sharing with him the difficulties about their children and now he is learning first hand for himself how the little children that he once remembers are now adults and each are not living this perfect life as he had hoped.

""Everybody's Fine"" features an all-star cast with Drew Barrymore, Kate Beckinsale and Sam Rockwell but where the original film focused on the family life and as mentioned operatic in that the Italian film featured children named after opera characters and the children's lives being close to those characters, ""Everybody's Fine"" is focused more on the father.  The siblings project this facade of a happy life but Frank (De Niro) is not dumb, he knows something is wrong and it all culminates up to the point where he finds out the truth of his son David, the son that he put the most pressure on when he was younger.

But most of all, realizing that his dead wife wanted to maintain order and out of love, she made Frank feel that everybody's fine (thus the title of the film).

""Everybody's Fine"" is probably the most vulnerable we have ever seen of De Niro and just shows you the depth of his talent as an actor.  Although the film had a limited three week run before the Christmas holiday, I enjoyed this film a lot.

Having grown up watching films about parents and their children through director Yasujiro Ozu who showed the pain and happiness of parenthood and the bond between the parents and their children, ""Everybody's Fine"" is a sentimental film that touched my heart because I know many parents in which one significant other would tell the other who is the breadwinner that life is good but behind those words lies a facade and sure enough, things are not always that good as it may seem.  Although, we are given a limited time to see Frank's interaction with his children, it's that journey and realization and discovery that touches you.  De Niro brings Frank Goode to life.

Overall, ""Everbody's Fine"" features a strong, magnificent performance from De Niro unlike anything he has done before.  The film is sentimental, heartwarming and tragic but in the end, is a film that I adored.

Definitely recommended!",1267488000,2,5587,4.810471204188482
4062674,3,B0032BWL10,"Family dysfunction is given a lugubrious, sentimental treatment by writer/director Kirk Jones (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Waking-Ned-Devine/dp/B00000ILEC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Waking Ned Devine</a>) in what is actually a remake of a 1990 Italian film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Stanno-tutti-bene/dp/6302423449/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Stanno tutti bene</a>, written and directed by Giuseppe Tornatore, no stranger to sentiment since he made the neo-classic ""Cinema Paradiso"". The earlier film starred the legendary Marcello Mastroianni as a Sicilian civil servant who travels throughout Italy to pay surprise visits to his children after his wife has died. This mirror version stars the equally legendary Robert De Niro as Frank Goode, a former blue-collar worker living in upstate New York, doing the same thing with his grown children. The first part of the plot reminds me of an even earlier classic, Yasujiro Ozu's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Tokyo-Story/dp/B00005JLV7/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Tokyo Story</a>, which told the story of an elderly couple who visit their grown children in Tokyo only to discover they have no time for them. That film was a subtle classic that didn't telegraph its emotional impact around contrived plot turns.

The same cannot be said for this turgid 2009 drama which bears the sometimes unbearable stamp of manipulation in Jones' overly deliberate treatment with sometimes too-perfectly composed shot compositions courtesy of Henry Braham's immaculate cinematography. The plot follows Frank on his voyage of discovery as he settles into his unfulfilling widowed existence. After being rebuffed by his four children to come home for the holidays, he decides to take matters into his own hands and visit each one of them despite a serious heart ailment. He begins to realize it was his wife who had been the emotional conduit that kept the family in touch despite the divergent paths they all took. Frank sets out by train and bus to surprise each of them in their locales. The first is David, an artist living a boho-type lifestyle in Manhattan, but he isn't home for reasons that will become clear later in the story. Then it's off to see Amy, a successful, Type-A Chicago advertising executive living a life out of the pages of Architectural Digest.

Frank moves on to Denver to meet his son Robert, a symphony percussionist whom Frank thought was a conductor, and finally to Las Vegas where he visits Rosie, a dancer living in a luxurious apartment. Needless to say, things are not what they appear, and Frank becomes aware of how estranged he truly has become from his children as revelations start to unfold like clockwork. As an actor, De Niro seems to have settled into a relatively passive figure only evoking the heat of his past performances during key moments. Unfortunately, that happens in the film's worst scene, a hallucinogenic fantasy scene where Frank is talking to his memory of his children as toddlers only to have them talk back like their adults (a bit like the classroom scene in Woody Allen's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Annie-Hall/dp/6304907729/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Annie Hall</a>&nbsp;but without the laughs). Otherwise, De Niro makes his character a befuddling, somewhat endearing presence throughout. Kate Beckinsale plays Amy efficiently but not too deeply. The ad pitch during her sequence is the one unexpectedly funny bit in the whole film.

Sam Rockwell fares better as the son since the sense of disappointment is palpable between father and son in his scenes with De Niro. Drew Barrymore uses her natural warmth and likeability to play Rosie as Frank's obvious favorite, a daughter who won't do anything to let her father down. The always watchable Melissa Leo (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Frozen-River/dp/B001KEHAG2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Frozen River</a>) shows up in a convenient but touching cameo as a sympathetic truck driver who bonds with Frank over their recent spouse losses. The whole plot executes on a series of conveniences such as the blatant connection between Frank's former job in covering PVC cables and the overlapping voiceovers of the siblings on moving images of telephone wires. The 2010 DVD release is weak as these types of releases go with the only extras being seven deleted/extended scenes (interesting but excisable) and an interview with Paul McCartney, who wrote and performed the appropriately sentimental song, ""I Want to (Come Home)"", played over the closing credits.",1267315200,,4720,5.89766081871345
4062675,3,B0032BWL10,"Okay, this one's a flinger; the first movie to be reviewed using my new Flinger Rating Scale.  Instead of stars, picture little icons of sporks, which I was forced to use to fling my own foeces at the screen.  As you see, however, this particular movie only comes in at three sporks, meaning it wasn't all that bad as flingers go.

I liked this movie to a certain extent, in the simple-minded way you like movies when you're guzzling wine while watching them... but found it a bit heavy on the forced pathos.  Perhaps they could've pumped the pathos to the next level by having Robert DeNiro's character coughing up blood into a snow-white handkerchief while walking by a dead clown lying on the railroad tracks.  And then he discovers that his son the artist actually ran away to join the circus, got gang banged by a bunch of circus lions and went the way of Rod Stewart.  If you attended public school in the 1970s then you know what I'm talking about.  Those lions, he tried to resist but they were just so strong and... and yet after the attack, he still had the pluck to soldier on and get up on that stage and perform for his fans.  However, while belting out The First Cut is the Deepest, his ordeal proved too much for him and he collapsed, only to be rushed to a nearby emergency room and have seven pints of puma come pumped from his stomach.

Anyway, getting back to this very sad yarn, the son who's a percussionist could've turned out to be an organ grinder's monkey.  He kind of looked like that when he was standing there pathetically banging that drum.  One thing that wasn't explained was why Drew Barrymore's character is both a lesbian AND has an illegitimate baby.  Boy, I guess she was going through a rough patch!  You can go ahead and flush this Christmas turkey down the Christmas toilet, you know, the one that still has your uncle Abe's skid marks in it?  Bottom line, stick a spork in this one.

4062676,5,B0032BWL10,"EVERYBODY'S FINE is, of course a misnomer: it is that too often used phrase to cover up or at least distract the questioner from the realities that are painful.  This fine little jewel of a film is a remake of the Italian 1900 STANNO TUTTO BENE written by Massimo De Rita, Tonino Guerra an Giuseppe Tornatorre.  Here that story about a Sicilian  father trying to reconnect with his children has been adapted successfully by Kirk Jones who also directs. Some may say the adaptation is less than the original, but for audiences in this country it is a more relevant story, and with the cast of characters selected to transform the tale into an American one it is successful.

Frank Goode (Robert De Niro in a compelling performance) is a recent widower, caring for his house in Elmira, NY without very much connection to his four children who have gone into the world 'to become famous' (in Frank's mind).  Frank decides to spiff up his home and invite the children now living in all parts of the country to his home for a reunion.  None can come, with excuses that indicate that life outside Frank's world is more important and constraining.  Much against his physician's orders (Frank spent his life making PVC insulation for telephone wires and has work related pulmonary complications) Frank sets out to surprise each of his children with a visit.  He visits Amy (Kate Beckinsale), an advertising executive creating corny ads for unimportant customers; Robert (Sam Rockwell) who just plays percussion in the symphony rather than being the expected conductor; Rosie (Drew Barrymore) who instead of becoming a famous dancer has a gig in a Las Vegas show; David who was supposed to become a famous artist is simply not at home.  Frank realizes that he never really connected with his children except through his wife's presence, and while the children love their father, they feel they could never live up to his expectations....and haven't.  The painful truth comes when the 'family' discusses the fourth child David's status. The truths that are overwhelmingly obvious are that even in families we keep secrets that are really wounds that need tending.

Throughout the film Frank takes photos with a 'film camera' - an indication of how out of touch Frank has become - of each child as well as signs that suggest they are more than they are.  His moments on his various rides across the country to meet the kids reveal that  it is even difficult to successfully relate to those fellow travelers on the various buses and trains.  Robert De Niro offers an understated performance that is Oscar worthy, creating a character who will live in memory for years to come.  Grady Harp, February 10",1266969600,5,2689,4.827886710239651

Maybe it's because it reminded me so much of my relationship with my parents that it got me like it did, but even beyond that, there was so many little spots in the movie that choked me up.  It wasn't over the top either, it was so true to life.
I really have to question the few negative reviews on this movie.  I understand everyone has different life experiences so they might not relate to the movie exactly the way I did, but I have to wonder if someone's heart it is still working if they didn't find some kind of emotional connection to the movie or at least appreciate the plot and depth of the movie.

4062678,5,B0032BWL10,"When I think about Robert De Niro, movies like ""The Godfather,"" ""Raging Bull,"" ""Taxi Driver,"" ""Goodfellas,"" and many others, come to mind - you know, the ones that established him as serious contender in Hollywood. It's kind of a weird feeling seeing him portray a calm, ordinary guy, which is precisely what he does in the charming and captivating ""Everybody's Fine.""

De Niro plays Frank Goode, a single, hard-working parent, who lives by himself in a house once inhabited by his four, now grown-up children and his late wife. His biggest joy in life, it seems, is to have his sons and daughters for Christmas, ""all around the same table."" For this purpose, he buys the best steaks, wines, etc., so that he can impress his family and enjoy the holidays. However, for this particular Christmas, his children can't make it for this special celebration. So Frank decides to go to them instead, traveling by bus, airplane and by train, in order that he can surprise and spend time with  David (Austin Lysy) in New York, Amy (Kate Beckinsale) in Chicago, Robert (Sam Rockwell) in Denver, and Rosie (Drew Barrymore) in Las Vegas. In doing so, Frank is the one surprised, finding secrets after secrets about his adult children, which makes him question himself, about his role in their lives.

""Everybody's Fine"" is about what we expect from our children once there are adults, and how we measure their success. It is touching and honest, and in the end, like Frank, we can conclude that ""the family is making its way in the world, and you could be proud of the children and their achievements."" The DVD also includes deleted and extended scenes and the making of Paul McCartney's ""(I Want To) Come Home."" (USA, 2009, color, 100 min plus additional materials).
