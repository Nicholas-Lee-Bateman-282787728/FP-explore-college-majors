2269149,5,B00097E76C,This movie is a finny i own the first part and this one is a bit funnier the the first but not kids,1336176000,,99,3.347826086956522
2269150,5,B00097E76C,first off this is a sex comedy not high art. the acting isn't the best as such but the plot is humorous in it's self. I advise getting it (if not rent it) just don't expect American pie.,1250035200,5,186,3.9210526315789473
2269151,3,B00097E76C,"Rolfe Kanefsky (Writer/Director) has got to get over whatever kind of existential deeper meaning type undercurrent that he keeps trying to throw into his later movies. It's just done awkwardly and as a result feels forced to add meaning to what could otherwise be just a fun movie.
  Basically a complete and utter nerd gets this cellphone that after an accident develops a personality and allows him to control other people's minds. Being the typical nerd that he is he has lots of problems with women and in the cliched kind of way completely overlooks the 1 friend he has that just so happens to be a cute girl. (Can you believe it?)
  Anyway predictable hi-jinks ensue, or at least are attempted with nothing seemingly able to go quite right for the hopeless protagonist.  For instance he uses his cell to give him a ""long lasting"" erection so that he can have sex with his brother's girlfriend. And his parents come home from the mall. You venture a guess as to what happens.
  This movie was alright. I was looking for a good hypnosis themed movie with some nudity and enough of a plot to keep my mind interested. The hypnosis was not so good. And the other two were pretty average. And the poorly developed moral at the end kind of took away from it as a whole.
  As I stated this director has got to get away from adding some kind of deeper meaning to his B movies. He's bad at it, and his premises don't really call for it.",1196726400,6,1432,4.435114503816794
2269152,1,B00097E76C,"Although the DVD cover says this is about teenagers, and the 'kids' are shown in school, all the actors are obviously much older.  None of them do a very good job of faking teenage behavior or even looking like teenagers.  The British can make a sex comedy that is truly funny, but Americans seem to only make them seem dumb and silly.  This movie is full of totally unbelievable silly behavior that makes the movie barely worth watching.  I gave it a 'D' rating only because the language is surprisingly clean for a dumb sex comedy.",1167782400,2,533,4.520833333333333

8057919,1,B00097E76C,"pretty cool I liked. pretty cool too was NOTHING like the first. no plot or storyline nor very good acting. if all you want to see is a bunch of girls jumping up and down topless, which I'm not saying that there is anything wrong with that, but for 60 minutes of a 90 minute movie ? COME ON!! well I've got to admit I only watched about 10 minutes of it, that's all I could stand.",1426723200,,380,3.948051948051948

8057923,2,B00097E76C,"""Pretty Cool"" is a bad film. It's poorly written, poorly acted and poorly directed. Worst of all, it's not funny at all. Its sequel,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pretty-Cool-Too/dp/B000P29BAI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pretty Cool Too</a>, as dumb as it is, is a superior film in every way...most notably, the women look a lot better.

But it has a lot in common with its successor. This is supposed to be a teen sex comedy, a sort of throwback to '80s farce like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Zapped/dp/B0010AN7XQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Zapped!</a>, and dozens of others, in which nerdy teen boy gets mind control and/or telekinetic powers and hilarity ensues. Get ready for those girls to have their skirts blown up! Way up!!!

The problem? No comedy (there are many attempts at humor that are about as funny as that one kid in sixth grade who thought that he was hilarious but in reality just screamed and made bad fart jokes a lot). And no sex. Not really sexy sex at any rate. The women included are above-average attractive but there is nearly no nudity--the movie would have been so much better with more of it. In fact there's as much nudity in the special features as there is in the  movie itself.

Those extras make this a much better presentation than it would have been otherwise. Kudos to the production team for going there when so many other independents wouldn't bother.",1369008000,6,1482,5.4868421052631575
8057924,3,B00097E76C,"It had potential, most of it unrealized. LOTS of hot chicks in this short production (the good news is that you won't have to suffer for long). Yet only three of them disrobe, and two of those are among the least attractive. (I've never understood how that works. I'm sure that it's a money thing--it costs less to get the uglier girls naked).

Plotline is about 20 years after its time: Homely kid hits it big with a combination of high technology and magic, and gets everything that he ever dreamed about--sort of. And in the end he realizes that what he really wants is the sort-of homely girl next door anyway. You've seen this movie 10  million times in various incarnations, many times done better than it is here.

The saving grace could have been more nudity  with this long list of hot actresses, only it didn't happen. Boo.

I debated over giving this just two stars, but there are some good moments with the hot women, and the behind-the-scenes extras are a good addition that you wouldn't normally get with this kind of independent production.",1344124800,2,1055,4.620320855614973
