8546850,4,B00A5HFBQG,"Kim Hyun Joong is a famous Korean singer, and though he has a nice smooth voice, his cds and concerts are not my cup of tea. I like his acting though. He seems ernest about doing a good job in whatever role he is playing. So far I've seen him in this one and Boys Over Flowers; and though he ends up being a doctor by the end of the dramas, he effectively portrays two different people.

If you want to get the most entertainment out of this drama, fast forward over the dream scenes. They are all ridiculous, and annoying. I think these scenes bring ratings down. If only the directors had been more discerning. I purposefully decided not to penalize the drama, too severely for those scenes, because it's worth watching, and I can do my own editing and still enjoy the story. Therefore, I gave it a 4 star rating instead of a 5, also because I was dissatisfied with the writers, who turned the main female character into a spineless person. She started out spunky. That, and because Jung So Min portrayed her, made the character, Hani very cute and charming. Her momentary backbone also made the drama more exciting, as she went up against the main guy, Seungjo. The other aspect I liked about this drama, was that there wasn't a homosexual agenda. It was a fairly clean drama, despite it's dive into chauvinism, toward the end. Every actor did a wonderfully convincing job, even the children in the story. My other favorites were the actors who played Seungjo's younger brother and mother. She especially, was a delightful character.",1389657600,,1536,4.605839416058394
