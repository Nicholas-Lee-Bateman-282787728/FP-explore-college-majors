Kelly, you are one talented son-of-a-b*tch. Keep doing what you're doing! Outside of Eddie Murphy and Tyler Perry, how many other artists have the courage to play all the different roles in your own movie!",1368230400,,370,4.537313432835821

2901518,5,B000TJ6OWA,"This movie is pure quality. R Kelly has created not just a movie, but a piece of fine art. Good times are had by all when this movie is put up on the big screen. Highly recommended for all, just make sure you have watched the first 12 chapters already.",1249948800,,252,4.06

2901521,1,B000TJ6OWA,"The first five minutes had so much offensive language that I turned it off and have not watched it yet.  I gave it to a friend who wanted to see it and she also said that the language and content was foul.  Not like the first one.  Hated it!

2901522,5,B000TJ6OWA,"Not since the crash of the Hindenburg or even the collapse of the World Trade Center towers has the world borne witness to such devastating human destruction.  Watching/ listening to ""Trapped in the Closet"" is like watching R. Kelly die from syphilis.  Clearly he's going insane.

Still, I know there's people out there for whom R. Kelly's desperate plea for help goes unheard, and these are the same people who herald him as a ""genius."" Those are going to be the people that make this ""hopera"" go off-Broadway.",1195603200,4,511,4.784090909090909
2901523,5,B000TJ6OWA,THIS VIDEO WAS FILLED WITH LAUGHTER. IT HAS YOU WONDERING WHAT IS GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT. IN THE BEGINNING IT RECAPPS WHAT HAPPENED IN THE FIRST TWELVE CHAPTERS. I WOULD RECOMMEND YOU WATCH IT.,1193616000,,191,4.647058823529412

2901525,1,B000TJ6OWA,Trapped in the closet 2 was not as good as the first one. It had entirely to much cursing. It seemed to stray away from the 1st one because to many other characters were added in. I was excited when I learned that he had a part 2 but quite disappointed when I watched it. I am not looking forward to any more work of Trapped in the closet.,1191801600,,339,3.927536231884058
2901526,5,B000TJ6OWA,Anyone who isn't mesmerized by R. Kelly's vision needs to relax!  It's fun and funny...tacky and terrible...genius and idiotic all at once.,1191628800,,139,5.318181818181818
2901527,5,B000TJ6OWA,"As usual, R.Kelly delivers a brilliant piece of work with the next chapters.  The story began as a bit confusing, but it all comes together and makes sense at the end - brillliant.  Intense, funny, some overacting by the church choir, R. Kelly is a true artist 17 years in the business and I loved every minute of it.  I just hope the next series of chapters doesn't take too long to come out.  I'm anxiously awaiting to see what happens next.",1191110400,,443,4.365853658536586
2901528,5,B000TJ6OWA,Trapped in the closet: chapters 13-22 is amazing! R. Kelly really out did himself on this one. Playing multiple hilarious characters and expanding the crazy storyline from the first DVD. 13-22 has a much better scheme/plot that 1-12. It is much more thought out and in depth than 1-12 where everyone is sleeping around on their significant others. It is very funny and entertaining and I can't wait until the next DVD comes out!,1191024000,,428,4.797297297297297
2901529,5,B000TJ6OWA,"I like RKelly very much. His video' are real smooth, and so is the Entire Trapped in the Closet series 1-22! I hope he does some more.  I wonder who is going to pick up the package?  Prehaps it got lost in the mail:}.",1190764800,,217,3.909090909090909

2901533,5,B000TJ6OWA,"It was the work I expected from R. Kelly.  Myself and my husband enjoyed it greatly. It gave us laughs that we are still laughing at today.

Only those with no sense of humor would not like this DVD. I still wanna know how James knew Chuck and Rufus?,1188691200,2,274,4.092592592592593
2901539,4,B000TJ6OWA,"after watching the first installment of trapped in the closet, i couldn't wait for this second set of chapters to be released.  Although it's still entertaining, and R. Kelly seems a little off the deep end, it is just lacking something that the first installment had. and man, does that beat get a little wearing after an hour!!
still, if you enjoyed the first set, i don't see how you can go without watching these. i now anticipate the third set's release!",1188518400,,459,4.597560975609756
2901540,1,B000TJ6OWA,"Sorry but R Kelly sucks. Hasnt done anything good since his callabo with Biggie in 97'. That callabo with Snoop recently wasn't bad either. But other than that, he just sucks. I was listening to Toucher and Rich radio show and they played snippets of it, none of us or the DJs had any idea what the hell he was talking about. Unless you just buy it to make fun of it, I don't see how anyone can truly like this garbage.",1188172800,2,419,4.121951219512195
2901541,4,B000TJ6OWA,"Whether or not you like R Kelly's music you gotta admit, this is something we've never seen before. Its a soap opera, music video, stage play, and R&B musical rolled into one. The acting is very good. R Kelly acted surprisingly well as the old man and the pimp. There are some hilarious moments. There is a huge cliffhanger at the end",1188086400,,334,4.403225806451613
2901542,5,B000TJ6OWA,"It is an amazingly funny hip-hopera! Hard to take this seriously, but still great to watch. Don't really like the old couple; they seem too 'cut & pasted' in. Although not as shocking as the first installment of chapters, still can't wait to see the next. Go Pimp Luscious!",1188000000,,273,4.591836734693878
2901543,5,B000TJ6OWA,"Watch Chapters 1-12 first before you watch this 13-22 chapters and I just want to say man.. i am so impressed when I watch this... R. Kelly is somebody you can never compare with with his creation of Trapped In the Closet.  I think Kelly deserves an Grammy for real because this is no joke no lie.. You won't be disappoint on this one if u already seen Chapters 1-12 because it is an sequel without confusion plot for example ""Some movies have sequels that doesnt make any sense to the first film and so on.""  But this one is funny than 1-12 as well.",1188000000,2,550,4.228571428571429
2901544,5,B000TJ6OWA,"Okay, can we please stop referring to this man as a genius! He hasn't done anything particularly earth shattering or inventive with his supposed ""opera."" I wish I could get paid proclaiming such brilliance as ""Oh my god, a ru-bber, ru-bber, ru-bber..."" or ""What the hell? What's that smell?"" Nonetheless, it's purely funny drivel (that I personally think R. Kelly takes dead serious, but that's just me!)and especially more fun to view while drunk! My friends and I cannot wait for this new installment. Should be a hoot!!",1187740800,2,522,4.943181818181818
2901545,5,B000TJ6OWA,"again, for those who don't get it, this is meant to be a comedy.  yet it's still smart and i would argue, well acted.  the lip syncing is flawless and just adds to the humor.  coming from a non-R. Kelly fan, trust me, it's good stuff.",1187568000,9,234,4.043478260869565
2901546,5,B000TJ6OWA,"R.Kelly is a Great Artist and the most Important Artist today bar none.

this Film from the direction is Orson Wells  Meets Tyler Perry. I call this film R.Kelly's Citizen Kellz.

the Angel element in the film makes R.Kelly the Black Mr. Rourke from Fantasy Island and like that show you have to be careful for what you do.

the Narrative that R.Kelly does is Rod Steiger meets James Earl Jones.

the acting has R.Kelly doing a Richard Pryor/Eddie Murphy Multi Roles which is a testimony to his versatility as a Actor as well.

all of the chicks in this film were great.

Trapped needs to be on the Soap Channel and never stop.

this Movie reflects Soceity and covers a wide range of topics.

R.Kelly is a Gifted Film-Maker and Music Maker. He is like Charlie Chaplin Meets Benny Hill Meets Rudy Ray Moore all rolled into one.

R.Kelly should win a Oscar, Tony, Grammy,Emmy and a Indy Award fo rhis contributions to film and theater.

chapter 18 was classic Kellz. this film will make Laugh,feel sad, make your sides hurt and also make you think. there is nobody else like him in  Entertainment today and he is wearing the crown of King. he is the Musical Genius of today and Beyond. Trapped in the Closet and the Aliens that inspired it's creations represent Yesterday,Today and Tommorow.",1187481600,4,1289,4.605263157894737
2901547,5,B000TJ6OWA,"I have to disagree with a previous reviewer about the nature of the comedy in ""Trapped.""  As an opera, its entirely self aware about its over the top lyrics and plot.  The beauty of Trapped in the closet lies in its flawless execution as much as its visceral humor.  I am not sure that anybody else could pull this off and make it fun to watch, much less riveting and hilarious.  R is a fantastic singer and the musical style/tone/production blends perfectly with the action on screen.  Take it for what it is, a funny and well crafted opera, composed and sung by one man, the incomparable R Kelly.",1187222400,7,598,4.4495412844036695
2901548,5,B000TJ6OWA,"It started as a serious effort toward toward ""hip-hopera"", but with the introduction of the midget it has become clear to me that Kelly has realized the comedic value of his life's work, and decided to go with the classic bedroom farce he unintentionally created.  Like a favorite recipe created accidentally, this gumbo of style, video and literary forms is unique....the clumsy lyrics, the blackploitation aspect, and the stereotypical characters makes the ""Trapped In The Closet"" series one of the funniest productions I have seen in a long time.  Like the reviewer above, I'm sure I have better things to spend my money on, but the fact that I will be able to expose my friends to such a farcical masterpiece will make the expendature worthwhile.

It is impossible to me to believe that R. Kelly can match the stylistic form of ""farce"" so closely, and yet not intend for it to be a comedy.
A ""farce"" frequently focuses on a transgression or on a character's urge to hide something from the other characters, and the unforeseen chain reaction that results.  The protagonist, having no time to step back and consider what he or she have been doing or will be doing next, soon passes the point of no return, erroneously believing that any course of action is preferable to being found out or admitting the truth themselves. This way the protagonist gets deeper and deeper into trouble. The protagonist is usually presented sympathetically, encouraging the audience to identify with them and hope for their success.  Many farces move at a frantic pace toward the climax, in which the initial problem is resolved one way or another, often through a deus ex machina twist of the plot. Generally, there is a happy ending. The convention of poetic justice is not always observed: The protagonist may get away with what he or she has been trying to hide at all costs, even if it is a criminal act.

  I see no difference between the stylistic form I just described and the plot line of ""Trapped In A Closet"".  And I prefer to believe that Kelly has shifted gears and now fully indends to finish off a masterpiece blackploitation hip-hopera bedroom farce.  I can't wait.",1187222400,3,2164,4.777479892761394
2901549,3,B000TJ6OWA,"I can't take this mess seriously, but it's some of the best unintentional comedy ever written. The first 12 chapters got progressively more absurd, and I can't wait to see how far this goes. I know that I probably have better things to spend my money on, and Kelly is certainly going to make a pile of money off this release, but it's a glorious trainwreck that I can't help but stare at.

I'm certainly not in the 'R.Kelly is the greatest artist that ever lived', but Trapped In The Closet is the genius of a madman.",1185408000,14,517,4.329896907216495
