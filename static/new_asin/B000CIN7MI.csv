8099072,5,B000CIN7MI,Lots of great Texas hill country shots.  Indie all the way.,1520208000,,59,4.363636363636363
8099073,1,B000CIN7MI,"A bunch of white dudes try to beat a white chick to this secret cave where there is a secret treasure of indian gold in 1869 Texas. The acting is terrible, the script is laughable and the ghost wolf looks like a cheap halloween costume. Typical low budget mistakes, trying to do a horror with no money and using non actors. I paid 99 cents for this movie and I think I overpaid by about 98 cents.",1179878400,,396,4.1558441558441555
