3894461,5,B002BFBAV0,"I'm a diver so needless to say I bought this DVD first.  This one and Baby Noah.  I have twin boys and they started watching this show since around 3 1/2 months old and are still watching it at almost 8 months now!! They absolutely love these 2 videos and will watch them over and over and over again.  You should see their smiling faces and how they perk up just when the music comes on.  I always end up putting them in their rockers so they'll stop breaking their necks while trying to watch from the floor. It is sooo funny because when the credits come on that is when they start crying or just get fussy until I rewind!!  Then they are back being their happy selves again.  After all this time with only these 2 videos I finally broke down and bought Mozart and DeVinci.  After all the rave reviews over Mozart...it doesn't do a thang for my two and Devinci is still a little over their heads. I'm fixing to buy Neighborhood animals since my boys apparently love the whole animal adventure.  I hope it isn't a waste of money.  Mozart was for us, but I think in a few months DeVinci will be a hit.  DeVinci does capture their attention, but NOTHING like Neptune and Noah!! Funny story: One day baby ""a"" wouldn't stop crying unless he was in my arms. Well, at seven months he is a bit heavy to be lugging around for long periods so I kept trying things but he kept crying after I sit him down.  Last resource, I put him in his rocker, sure enough he started crying again..so, I rushed to put one of the dvd's in as fast as I could. That was the cure! The moment he heard the Einstein introduction music he did a 180 degree and started getting excited.  Too funny!  A good friend told me about Einstein movies when I was still pregnant and she was absolutely right!  They are a must!!",1285459200,,1787,4.233038348082596

3894463,5,B002BFBAV0,"My baby has loved this from the time he was very, very young. The music is soothing and the water scenes are to die for. I've even found myself putting this in for ME to watch & listen to when I suffer from bouts of insomnia. The animal life is amazing, the colors are vivid and the music is soothing -even the narrating child's voice is soothing. My son is 2 1/2 now, and he still loves this. He falls asleep with this DVD in no time. I cannot say enough good things about this DVD. I initially purchased the old version, but we played it so much, it finally gave out. We then purchased this newer version and it's just as good, just the grow-with-me features are different. Either version, you can't go wrong. If you've never tried the Baby Einstein DVDs or don't own this one, go get it now!!!!!",1276819200,,798,4.256578947368421
3894464,4,B002BFBAV0,"I have 2 Baby Einstein DVDs.  My baby prefers My First Signs, but will watch this DVD also.  I rarely play them for him, but when I really need to get something done and can't chase him around the house, it is nice to be able to let him play on the floor and watch the DVD.  The music is pleasing and not annoying like most baby products.  I don't believe this is teaching him anything, but as seldom as he watches it, I don't think it is hurting him either.  The scenes are very pretty, but I doubt a baby understands much of what they are seeing.  My child is interested and really gets excited when the puppets show up.  It is nice how they mix the scenes.",1271116800,,659,4.062015503875969

8361273,3,B002BFBAV0,"the contents of any baby einstein is amazing! However, it is not playing in the portable dvd player, so my son cannot watch...",1298332800,,126,4.521739130434782
8361274,5,B002BFBAV0,"I can't tell you how many times my daughter and I have watched this video. She absolutely loves it. The scenery is amazing and it changes at a good pace; enough to get a good look at what is on the screen but not long enough to lose interest. There is a grow with me version that adds language pointing out ""fish"" and ""turtles"" etc. It's a great learning tool and I can see us using it for months to come. I'll just add my own questions and/or point out different animals/objects that the video doesn't talk about. Another point, and maybe most importantly for parents is I don't mind watching it! I've sat through a few other baby Einstein videos I absolutely couldn't stand, but this was one I can watch over and over. If I'm going to be sitting intereacting with my daughter I would like to enjoy the video too and this one is on that list. One downside maybe for some people, is it's kind of short, ~20min maybe a little more. If you wanted something a little longer (30-40min) I would recommend Baby Noah and World Music, both of which are great and run longer. Sometimes you need those extra 10 minutes in the morning to get some more things done while baby is entertained and learning!",1290124800,,1192,4.373873873873874
