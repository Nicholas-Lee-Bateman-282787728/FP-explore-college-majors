8215666,5,B000UYINWI,Wonderful training DVD.,1461369600,,23,7.0
8215667,4,B000UYINWI,Decent and practical advice from a speaker who kept material lively and not too boring.  Couldn't help but smile to myself when I saw how hard he was 'working' while filming the video.  It must have been hot in that room.  He had to take off his jacket and perspiration stains all over his back and armpits. LOL.,1419984000,,312,4.344827586206897
8215668,5,B000UYINWI,I bought this prior to a project for my consulting company I was hired to get a company sales team on track and even though I have 30 years sales and sales management experience I thought I would listen to one of these sales CD's for some tips. I picked this CD because of the title and found it full of old school basic techniques and discipline that are the key to success. I liked that Warren's technology consisted of a pad of paper to keep a record of calls. This allowed me to use his suggestions and anyone watching this to adapt his methods to your existing sales database. Sales has been my profession and as hard as this may be to believe I'm going to watch this again just for the fun of it.,1354579200,,702,4.169117647058823
8215669,5,B000UYINWI,"I shared this DVD with my sales staff to help them benefit from the techniques discussed and taught in the training DVD.

This is simply awesome, conversion is the most important KPI as that is the actual sale. This DVD enhances the prospecting skills and helps as how to improve on conversion rate.",1328572800,,299,4.6415094339622645
8215670,4,B000UYINWI,"We salesmen have the extreme luxury of being able to control our salary, the harder and smarter we work the more we make. Knowing exactly how much we are going to make is a entirely different question. The salary of a salesman can fluctuate greatly.

Warren is a very funny little man, he has a tendency to get riled up and really passionate about what he is discussing. It is actually very funny to watch and if you are interested of tips and advice from him, it should be done visually.

Sadly, even though this DVD was called prospecting I didn't learn much about it other than that it should be done more.

But he did teach me the interesting tool called the sales grid.
By using the sales grid you can calculate exactly how many sales you need to make in order to earn a certain level of income.

This tool has become a intricate part of our companies sales training.
Using the sales grid has helped salesmen work on their weakest point, comparing themselves to others and knowing what it is they have to do better.

It is fun to watch Warren speak and you get inspired to go out and make a sales.

He discussing in length the value of activity and its importance in sales, which is something I believe in religiously and he shares a lot of interesting tips that you will notice if you listen closely.

I think this DVD is very well suited for 2 types of people, or should I say for two different stages in your development.

1. It is a great DVD for new salesmen, it teaches the basics and kind of sets the tone for a career in sales.

2. For any salesman who has forgotten the value of activity, who has grown fat and happy or just lost some of their motivation this DVD is really worth a watch. It can help you get back on track and then start increasing your sales exponentially.

8215671,5,B000UYINWI,This video did not disappoint. Warren Greshes' enthusiasm and ideas were priceless. You can tell he has experience in sales as well as a wealth of knowledge. I am now inclined to get his other materials!!,1208476800,2,204,4.694444444444445
