8196417,3,B000QGDY38,"This is simply your average treatment on carrier warfare during WWII that one can see on History or Discovery channels. It is a fairly accurate treatment of carrier warfare, mainly in the pacific, and mainly focusing on WWII.

The DVD is not in any way helpful in understanding the doctrines that gave birth to carrier warfare nor the adaptations that came about under the heat of desperate necessity in battle that were important parts in the practice of carrier warfare, carrier design or naval aircraft design.

The period footage is generally good and used fairly well to help tell the story. The score is acceptable but narrator could probably have been a little more enthusiastic in his task. ;)

If you are looking for a DVD that chronicles the major battles and campaigns in the pacific during WWII, this may be a good resource. If you are looking for more from a theoretical and doctrinal point of view, this DVD offers little you don't already know. Not bad, but should have been more than it was. Three stars.",1263686400,,1020,4.719101123595506
