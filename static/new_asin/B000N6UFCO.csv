First off, I wish to preface my review by pointing out that I am a musical noob.  Ergo, I have no clue what I am talking about.

That said, I really like this video, and I would absolutely recommend it as a valuable supplement to the numerous books on beginning musical theory.

Yes, as pointed out by another reviewer, the instructor in this video is using a piano to instruct.  However, in my brief learnings of harmonica, ukulele and bass guitar, I have the impression that a piano is the fundamental ""Reference Instrument"" from which most other instruments are taught, at least for music theory.  Also, in my efforts to learn harmonica/ ukulele/ bass guitar, it is MY responsibility to take the initiative to learn how to play specific notes on my specific instruments...so I consider that task to be an important step in learning.

The eight chapters of this video are:  Pitch; Duration; Rests and Ties; Familiar Tunes; New Time Signatures; Sharps and Flats; Chords and Counterpoint; Both Hands Together.  Unlike some beginner music books I have purchased, this instructor takes a bit more time to explain WHY notation is used as it is.  For example, why there are more of those little flag thingies on quarter, eighth, sixteenth notes...versus some books that just show a picture and say ""This is the notation for a quarter note.""  (...a simple concept yes, but not necessarily self-evident for a noob.)

Also, you know the instructor must be really, really smart, because he has a British accent.  :)

8175470,5,B000N6UFCO,This is a great book for those of us who don't know how to read music and want to learn. There is a DVD with this book too that is helpful more than I imagined it would. I am definitely glad I saw this book/DVD and bought it. Makes learning to read music easy!,1348617600,8,260,3.8333333333333335
8175471,1,B000N6UFCO,"Seeing that this DVD was made by Frederick Noad I erroneously assumed it was for guitar players. Actually it is not mentioned in the product description, nor on the product cover, that this product would be instrument-specific. Much to my disappointment, starting the DVD gives you the following text ""keyboard version"", and it turns out that the product IS instrument specific - namely for the piano...
Would it have been too much to ask for from Amazon or Omnibus Video to provide this information in the product description or product cover? There is no other ""version"" on Amazon, which makes me feel misled. I will try to return this item!!
(Whether this is a good product or not for piano players I have no comment.)",1207785600,11,721,4.776
