2966931,5,B000WCN8SW,"Karen is such a brilliant instructor and to me, she's one of the most motivating because she comes across as so encouraging and kind and cues so well that you end up giving it your all.  I still love this workout and pull it out every now and then.
The upper body program is a little challenging, but when it comes to toning, you want challenging so you can see nice defined muscles.  You do everything from curls and flies and then there's a great stretch.  For the abs section, it's easy to follow and there is modifications that you can do as you do it more often and you get stronger at it.  I like that because it's always giving you something to work towards.
You need weights and a step bench if you have one, and I think this is such a brilliant workout.  I love doing it and it's all under 45 minutes.  You will feel this the next day or two and see results fast if you do it regularly.  I really like this and highly recommend it.",1218585600,22,940,4.131868131868132
2966932,5,B000WCN8SW,"I bought the 'Firm Arms and Abs' workout when it first came out in the early 90's.  I just recently reordered it and 'Pure and Simple Stretch' on DVD. Karen Voight really does know her stuff. The workouts are very effective and because Voight is so good at what she does the exercises are not dated. The ""arm and ab"" program seems easy yet produces astonishing results. If you do the suggested 3 workouts a week you will start seeing a change at the end of two weeks.",1212537600,42,467,4.306818181818182

2966934,5,B000WCN8SW,"I love this program.  The exercises are very safe and Karen Voight does an excellent job of describing safety and good form while doing the exercises. I had the VHS of this and just ""upgraded"" the the DVD.  I have done this program on and off for years.

I really appreciate the other reviews people have written for exercise programs.  Keep  up the good work.",1208476800,25,360,4.476923076923077

8222634,4,B000WCN8SW,"Loved the workout and the options offered - whether you have time for the full workout or parts of it.  Karen is an excellent video instructor, reminding you constantly to keep the correct form and thus maximize the effort and avoid injury.  The only thing I didn't enjoy was the overpowering 90s background music.  She should invest in a re-edit and update the music, repackage and resell.",1485993600,4,390,4.791044776119403
8222635,5,B000WCN8SW,"Great exercise program.  I had this in VHS but my player broke so I bought the DVD.  I switched exercises, doing Karen's ""lean legs and buns"" one day and ""firm arms and abs"" the next.  I lost 2-3 inches off my waist in about 6 months.  Great workout.",1441670400,2,250,4.145833333333333
8222636,5,B000WCN8SW,"this is great workout for abs and arms.  Just what I was looking for, using weights and not a lot of jumping around.  thanks!!",1439424000,,126,4.208333333333333

8222638,3,B000WCN8SW,"Karen Voight is an excellent instructor, but this DVD just wasn't challenging or innovative enough. It's the sort of workout I would do on the days between doing workouts that make a difference (i.e. I would do this on my 'rest' days). This is a no-sweat workout. The warm-up didn't warm me up at all, so by the time I got to the weights section, I was still cold. The weights section was pretty pedestrian. I had seen most of these moves before. That's not such a bad thing, ofcourse, but there weren't enough reps to feel the burn. To get the most out of this section, use the heaviest weights you can stand. 3 lb weights for me seemed too easy, so I would try 4 lbs next time.

The abs section wasn't bad. I'm not a huge fan of crunches (unless they're part of circuit training), however as far as crunches go, I did like these. I like the use of the inclined step, as my back felt well supported.

There is no cool down, which, while annoying, makes sense because things never really warmed up in the first place!

Next time I use this DVD, I'll do some cardio on my own first, to get nice and warmed up before I do the weights. I'd add more weight because there aren't many reps of each exercise.

I'd recommend this to beginners, who just want to get into the routine of working out, but don't expect dramatic results from this. Intermediate and advanced exercisers can pass on this one.",1396569600,2,1393,4.325670498084291
8222639,1,B000WCN8SW,"Quite disappointed - the DVD itself is quite old material and the quality not the greatest, esp. not at the price we are paying. So now I need to buy a workout bench too.",1395446400,,170,4.029411764705882
8222640,4,B000WCN8SW,"I think that this is a good DVD, but it was more aerbics and less focused on ""strength"" than I wanted. I was hoping for more free weight exercises.",1253577600,,147,4.103448275862069
8222641,5,B000WCN8SW,"I really enjoyed the arms segment of the video.  I recommend having multiple weights available depending on your strength level.  I needed 3 lbs for shoulders, 8-10 lbs for biceps, and 5 lbs for the rest.  My arms were shaking after completing the workout the first time... it works!  Great for beginners.

The stair-stepper bench was not really necessary as there were no step routines included for the warm-up or the workouts.  She uses it as a seat, and to prop up her leg during the arm segment.  She uses it as an inclined bench for the abs section.  I did the ab section on a mat to cushion my back and still felt the burn.

I agree with another reviewer that the abs section was a bit light and will be good for beginners.  I simply did some of the exercises at double her speed or raised my upper back off of the mat to increase the intensity.

Finally, I liked that this video had no cardio interruptions. I know that trainers insist on lots of cardio before strength training, however, it's easier to add your own exercises before you start than to fast forward through things you don't like.  I'm very pleased with my purchase.",1250899200,17,1138,4.444444444444445
8222642,3,B000WCN8SW,Good arm toning. Abs exercises are so so. Would not say bad but for the advanced they are not challenging enough. As to arms exercises in my opinion they are perfect.,1246320000,2,166,4.387096774193548
8222643,3,B000WCN8SW,"I wish I knew all the excercises were done on bench before I purchsed the DVD.
Hopefully I will be able to do some of excerises on the floor or standing.",1246233600,4,153,3.967741935483871
