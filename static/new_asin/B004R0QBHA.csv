I love that these DVDs features a day in the lives of kids and their families from other countries because it shows that not everyone lives the same way as we do.  My boys saw how other kids eat, work, go to school, play with friends and more.  They are educational DVDs that really are not totally boring to watch!  I really think it is important for kids to understand other cultures and how other kids live and this DVD series is great to watch.",1318204800,4,539,4.203883495145631
