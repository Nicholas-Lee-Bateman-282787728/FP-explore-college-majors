8605904,2,B00EJ4K2YC,"The Trial of Billy Jack, 1974 film

It starts with a scene of the southwest and lists some of the conflicts in the early 1970s. People were shot and wounded at the Freedom School. Will this shut it down? A reporter questions a woman in a hospital bed. [A pretty large room?] Then they show the Trial of Billy Jack years earlier. Billy explains his personal philosophy. Miss Roberts testifies. Billy tells about a massacre of civilians in Vietnam. Waste them! is the order from Saigon. Lock and load. Soldiers are trained to kill on orders. Was Calley a hero? Billy recalls past events. [Is that an example of brain-washing by the corporate media?] Billy is found guilty. Officials talk about the future. Billy goes to prison.

The Freedom School was closed, but they found an abandoned military base as a replacement. They start a local TV station to present their views and news. One new invention (a Voice Stress Analyzer) can tell if a person is lying. [But not what he or she is lying about. There seems to be too much padding in this movie. The references to current events (Nixon) are old history today.] The FBI questions the parent of a student. Miss Roberts is interviewed. Child abuse or battering is a big problem. [Caused by a poor economy?] A guard strikes Billy in jail; will he react? Miss Roberts explains child abuse. [Is it really an epidemic?] They show a big crowd. Will Billy cooperate with the warden as he leaves prison? He returns to the school. A teenage girl sings. There is an exhibition of fighting. Later they show a skiing accident. Will the hospital treat an Indian? Hunting deer out of season?

Police search students (do they have a warrant?). The police chase and beat a teenager. The crowd is told to disperse. Only one man remains. Native Americans complain about their treatment. Can they take a case to the World Court? Indians are not allowed to hunt on their lands. They visit the hunters camp. Is it sport? [Yes.] There is an exchange of opinions. The men are shot - with a camera (they don't like that). More strange scenes follow. Billy Jack undergoes a ceremony. Officials want to claim a child. Their telephone is being tapped; they can listen in even when the receiver is on the hook! [Thank you, Bell Labs.] Do marches and demonstrations do any good? [It depends.] A man descends a sheer cliff. [The long shots suggest a body double.] A cobra in this country?

Billy Jack finds more snakes in the cave but walks among them. [Another double with steel under those long pants?] Squeals from bats. He meets his inner self. Go to the desert. Men watch TV in the desert. There is another test. What can the students do in protest? Billy eschews violence. There is a parade, like an old-time circus, in town. Men show up to attack the students and burn their bus! Billy shows up to converse with these men. A mans car goes into the river! Does a local bank control the local politicians and the local economy? [There is too much padding and repetition here.] The crowd of people just stand and watch. Has Billy slowed down? Will Posner escalate the violence? Yes, a man is shot dead. Grandfather is arrested. Blue Elk is kidnapped and beaten. Billy Jack arrives, men arrive to threaten him. There is a fight (for action). One mans knife fails him. Posner fires his pistol! Billy Jack stops Posner.

The ambulance removes the victims. Police arrive, a police car is overturned. Get Billy Jack says the governor. The military arrive at the Freedom School to arrest Billy Jack, he surrenders to the police. There is a stop on the highway. Billy Jack escapes to drive away in a police car. Should they resort to violence? Federal troops surround the Freedom School. Students burn down an old shack. Soldiers shoot at the students! Young Danny is shot in the back! Some soldiers drop their rifles. [This recreates the Kent State massacre of May 1970.] They must keep fighting for their beliefs. There is a song by a young woman.

This movie is not as violent as the real events it was based on. Can we make this a better world by opposing the corporate interests who only seek to oppress the common people? I think this movie runs on too long and is too diffuse in trying to cover too many topics. Billy Jack Goes to Washington is the best and last of the series (it is based on that 1939 movie). Four decades have passed, will there ever be another movie that supports populist politics?",1431561600,,4424,4.593670886075949
