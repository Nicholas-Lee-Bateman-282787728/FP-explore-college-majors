4593665,5,B005775M2C,"Ever since middle school, I have been a huge fan of Conan O'Brien. I would only watch his show on Fridays or over school breaks because if I got caught being up so late, I'd get in trouble. But when he started on The Tonight Show, I stayed up late and watched it anyways no matter the day. So I was watching every night as the battle for The Tonight Show unfolded and, like many, I gave all of my support to him. So after leaving the Tonight Show, he planned a 32-city live tour, which is what the film focuses on.

The tour moments are fun, especially the backstage bits. During the Radio City Music Hall show, we see Conan, Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert backstage preparing their skit a mere 9 minutes before they go onstage and perform it. We really see the creativity that went into this tour and they pulled it off nicely. There are moments after the shows where he complains about not wanting to meet fans, but he does it anyways. He definitely shows much appreciation for them and all of their support.

We get to see a darker side of Conan in the film. At one point, he teases Jack McBrayer, calling him a hick and even making up a song on the spot that's very dark, yet I found myself laughing. Who wouldn't be able to go into a darker place after losing one of the biggest television shows of all time? Honestly the film made me love Conan even more. Even though he does act somewhat mean at times, his amazing team still sticks with him. He has such a wonderful group of people supporting him. There are some really nice moments of him with long time friend and sidekick, Andy Richter. You can really tell that they will always be there for each other. Also I have to give credit to Sona Movsesian, Conan's assistant, who handles him well at some pretty rough times.

I think documentaries about entertainers are always great to see. You get to see much more of them than you do on tv or on stage. This is one of the best I've ever seen and I'm not just saying this because I'm a Conan fanatic, but this film is very well made. We get to see moments of Conan that we normally don't get to and it's fascinating to watch. The film gets dark at times, but for the most part, it's hilarious. The film is a must see for Conan fans and it's the year's absolute best film. I don't think there will be a more honest, funny and entertaining film this year. Go Team Coco.",1309046400,9,2374,4.247787610619469
4593666,5,B005775M2C,"Let's be clear on this. There's a reason this film is called ""Conan O'Brien Can't Stop"", rather than ""Conan O'Brien Doesn't Want To Stop"" or ""Conan O'Brien Would Really Prefer Not To Stop, If It's Alright With You"". Not only does the chosen title roll off the tongue rather better, but it's also absolutely, awe-inspiringly true.

This documentary received rave reviews when it debuted at the South by Southwest Film Festival, and it's easy to see why. ""Conan O'Brien Can't Stop"" is a fantastic, engaging film about an extremely driven man at a crossroads in his professional life.

Apart from a couple of questions posed to Conan throughout the film, there is no audio commentary/voice-over from Rodman Flender. The footage speaks for itself, and the camera-work is intimate without feeling invasive. The film includes some footage of the actual tour performances, but the vast majority of the documentary is focused behind-the-scenes, and takes us on a complete journey of the tour: from the first tweet announcing the release of tickets to the final show in Atlanta. Along the way, we see Conan perform at every opportunity, even on his days off. We see a man unable to resist meeting and entertaining his fans even when he seems at times to barely have the energy to stand up. We see his interactions with his staff and crew, including sidekick Andy Richter (their genuine friendship over and above their comedic rapport is abundantly clear). The film also includes some heart-warming moments with Conan's family.

All in all, for 89 minutes, this film showcases the real life of a talented, intense performer and man, including the ups and downs and the hilarity and the tired crankiness. A very entertaining, honest and eye-opening film.",1308960000,63,1743,5.003448275862069
4593667,5,B005775M2C,"What seems to be a simple documentary following Conan O'Brien on his live tour, is also an exhausting roller-coaster ride of hilarity, melancholy, anger, arrogance, farce and gratefulness. Hilarity in the constant ways Conan tries (and succeeds) to entertain everyone around him. Melancholy and anger in seeing Conan fight with his emotions of having to cope with a broken dream of hosting The Tonight Show, with both morose moments and slapstick jabs to the people that let him down. Arrogance in his ""Mean Conan""-persona to the people closest to him, and in trying to cope with the many demands of fans. Farce, in the moments where things boil over and Conan truly can't stop talking, singing, being courteous to everyone around him. Gratefulness, in the fact that he keeps on keeping on, because he knows that people care and want to live up to their expectations.

4593672,1,B005775M2C,Horribly boring and not funny.  Watching behind the scenes of conan's tour was appallingly boring.  I didn't find it amusing and it actually made me like coco less.  So watch an old late night episode or something else...you might laugh then.,1481155200,,242,4.853658536585366
4593673,5,B005775M2C,"A really interesting look into Conan's craft. I remember the depocal with him and NBC, and I had no idea about the details and his live tour. I love Conan and this made me respect him way more.

4593677,1,B005775M2C,"I've never really been a fan of Conan O'Brian but after watching this, I'm really not a fan. I don't even understand why he would release this. It's mostly him complaining about the things he has to put up with being a celebrity. He complains about the fans and the people who by their ticket purchase pays his bills. I really get the impression he has no other skill to make a living. I just don't get why he would want the public to see him behind the scenes.",1479600000,,461,4.191011235955056
4593678,5,B005775M2C,"A terrific behind the scenes look at the enormously talented, almost bipolar comedian. The show showcases his limitless, restless energy, almost reminiscent of a Robin Williams, along with his talent for music - singing and playing the guitar - and the endless love his fans have for him.

4593679,3,B005775M2C,"This offers a glimpse into the amount of work it takes to tour with a show this large. It also offers a glimpse into how much strain is placed on the headliner. Conan really can be a whiny little bitch at times. I understand his exhaustion with the process and this whole tour was birthed out of anger, but, he can be a bit of a premadonna as you will see.",1479340800,,356,4.028169014084507
4593680,5,B005775M2C,"A great behind the scenes look at the life of Conan.  I didn't know what this was going to be about, and thought it would just be one of his comedy tour nights on dvd, which would have been ok. But it is a documentary of the life of a celebrity comedian. It is funny at times, and shows that conan does have a funny edge and musical talent.  He is good at referencing classic comedy bits and parodies.  The behind the scenes looks, shows his sharp comedy wit.",1479340800,,459,4.134831460674158

4593684,5,B005775M2C,"I saw the documentary before buying it and as a huge fan of Conan I thought it gave a lot more background to his rehearsals, prep, and fan interactions. Owning it provides quite a bit more content and they did a really good with choosing the right people for the commentary (Conan, Rodman, Sona, Andy, and Sweeney; Conan definitely speaks the most though). I just really enjoyed the atmosphere and no BS vibe I got based on their feelings both in the documentary, the commentary, and what I've seen elsewhere of them.

What you've seen of Conan and gang is what you get and if you like that, this will be entertaining to you.",1478908800,,625,4.482456140350878

4593688,5,B005775M2C,"This documentary went places I did not expect it to, allowing a peak behind the curtain on someone who is both driven and tired. We see Conan as he is angry, manic, depressed and elated to be doing what he loves to do. I particularly enjoyed some bits that were left in, that I imagine another performer would want on the cutting floor. We see him punch and ridicule those around him, sometimes uncomfortably so. However, you can tell that he truly cares for his staff and his work. The fact that those around him allow him to vent helps, as they know he is not mad at them, but trying his best to process everything that is and has gone on around him. This project must have been cathartic for him after the events of The Tonight Show, and it is fascinating to watch him get to the other side and enjoy himself.",1478736000,,812,4.279220779220779

4593693,4,B005775M2C,"Not a big fan of Conan O'Brien's, but remember the publicity around his departure from the Tonight Show.  I'm sure he was feeling a great deal of angst during the time of this road trip.  The film illustrated that entertainers who go on these trips must have great stamina over time, and that fame is fickle, even to very talented people.  It helps to be driven and thick-skinned, but Conan also showed patience and enjoyment in his work.",1478304000,,438,4.589743589743589

4593698,3,B005775M2C,"While this was entertaining, it was not what I expected. It is shot in a ""day in the life"" style, jumping from travel, reactions to controversy, and performance on stage.

4593733,4,B005775M2C,"This doc is not, nor is it likely meant to be, an hilarious performance by a gifted improv comic, though it does showcase some of the clever skits and process and evolution of his very smart humor.  It's more of a close encounter with a wounded, angry and also funny guy, who just got displaced by the more popular or, better said, more populist Jay Leno. You will have some laughs at his talent and brain, designed for the production of  some of the wackiest, most arcane and esoteric imagery and references.  Legally prohibited, through a no-competition clause, from performing on tv for 6 months, he's touring 30 plus US cities. We see all the backstage prep, brainstorming, genesis of great themes and one liners.  It''s a reminder that comedians are not necessarily happy folks. They often have a habit that needs to be fed with applause and a constant heaping-on of praise. Here it's interesting, but also sometimes painful, to watch some of his anger spill over into jabs at his crew. Sarcasm is often anger with a smile, and watching his staff put up with that does produce an ugh factor. Conan is a terrific musician. His guitar work is pretty extraordinary and his singing not bad. Watching him let loose is exciting. He talks about the stages of grief, with his own spin, following his being let go. What this doc captures feels like an honest portrait of this comic, and likely others, reflecting some sadness, some self-deprecation some self-importance , and some genuine funny smarts.

Can't Stop does an excellent job of portraying the funny man as a person beset by a huge crisis of identity and purpose after his firing at NBC. You can see that he was deeply affected by losing his job. Sometimes the jokes he played on people were kind of mean and you can see where he snaps over having to meet so many of his profession's imposed obligations. I guess I went into Can't Stop thinking that it was all fun and games, but was pleasantly surprised to find it also presented the emotional turmoil of the other side of that coin.",1444262400,2,617,4.237288135593221

I would be a zombie at school the next day but couldn't wait to tell my friends jokes from the monologue or some hilariously stupid sketch. When my teacher assigned my class to write a biography on someone you look up to or would like to be like, it was Conan who I wrote about. Despite all of this, this was a pretty boring documentary. The jokes fell flat and nothing really interesting ever happened. I at least wanted to care about what was happening or about the people, but absolutely nothing about this film was entertaining. If they did a decent job letting the viewer see what his tour was like, I would be upset had I purchased a ticket to the show. Maybe I grew up and Conan didn't but that would be too much of an insult to the humor of my youth. Please Conan, take a long break, retirement even.

I'm not always fun to be around if I'm upset about something, but I don't have people record it into a documentary, either.

I normally love Conan, don't get me wrong, although seeing this side of him was depressing. I was hoping to be uplifted or take some kind of message away from this, instead it showed him being border-line abusive to his staff. Well, now I need to find something happier to watch to cleanse my palate.

One thing to keep in mind while watching this though is that Conan has admitted to becoming depressed after the Tonight Show/NBC/Leno debacle. While it was sometimes uncomfortable seeing him deal with unpleasant emotions in this documentary, it showed a much more human and flawed side of him as well. If you are sensitive to sarcasm, unfamiliar with Conan's work and relationships, and have difficulty understanding that celebrities have feelings and lives beyond the camera, this may not be right for you.

If he chooses to be bitter about being booted from his place on television, that's his prerogative.  For the rest of us, it's our choice to listen or not.

Even behind the scenes his constant need for attention and approval is pathological.  He's aware of of a lot of it, which is a little weird because he evidently thinks it's okay on some level.

Conan O'Brien is my favorite celebrity, as his humour, quick wit, self effacing jokes, and general buffoonery is the best out there. (But don't let the silliness fool you; he graduated from Harvard.) He's one of those celebrities where you're thinking, ""He seems like a nice guy. I love him so much. I hope he's a nice guy."" This inside look shows that he is just as or more incredible than you think, but no one is simply ""a nice guy"". This shed's a light on his interaction with the people in his life, loving but slightly abrasive at times, particularly when excessive amounts of stress are put on him. It shows his constant persuit to make everyone laugh and be happy, from his family and friends to random fans, even though he may not feel up to it and even though it may drain him entirely. It shows how he is always pushing himself to be funnier, faster, and better in every way. It also shows his constant struggle with his emotions, and how when the lights shine away from him, he battles the sadness, anger and desperation he may feel. This struggle also helps drives him to never stop being funny, never stop caring, never stop giving, and never stop performing, so he effectively can't stop.

I decided to rent this at home one afternoon while nursing a physical injury - and I'm glad I did. Not only will real fans love seeing Conan 'off script', but people who just 'like' his show will appreciate him too. In the documentary, you see him on the road after he walks off on NBC. So basically, he's struggling with losing his job (even though he walked off, it's still emotional for people), his emotions, not knowing where he's going to go next, and generally trying to find his way & still balance family life. With his performing onstage, he discovers that what he likes most is getting closer to knowing his audience. In the beginning you see his team put the tickets on sale for his live show & he can't believe that he is selling out in minutes venue after venue. It reminded me of how people who get knocked down somehow need to prove it to themselves sometimes that they are 'worthy' in order to pick themselves back up again. In this movie, you see Conan needing to prove to himself that he is good, he is a comic genius, and that he does, indeed, have a fan base of millions. It's great to watch him go through this evolution & be a real person, which is why I gave the movie 5 stars. At the end of the movie, I felt more respect for him as a comic. I'm sure he gained more fans from this documentary as well, as he should've. He worked hard on this tour & proved to himself that he could move on.",1410220800,,1553,4.197324414715719

Jay Leno never impressed me till I caught him on his garage clips on YouTube where he seemed more relaxed and engaged with his subject. Only caught Conan a couple of times and he was very in the groove. Was sorry to see him given the gate. But then NBC didn't want Carson either - and these execs get boque bread?

This is a searing, personal story. It's about this guy who gets mugged; gets up off the pavement and uses his talent to exorcise the demons inflicted upon him by no talent money goons. He burns out the rage by giving the best show he can at each and every venue. Well worth watching. Wish I had gotten to one of the live gigs.",1406678400,,820,4.222929936305732

I didn't feel even a hint of mirth over the humor. I quit the video about a third of the way through, and I'd be really surprised if I missed anything.

BTW I remember people talking about O'Brien's contention with his TV network as though the world was in an uproar over the most important thing ever.

Sure, you see his drive  and work ethic, but this is pretty boring, and not that funny.

It was cool to see what happened between his first show, the whole Jay Leno decable, and his resulting TBS show.  It was all new to me.

Biggest shock was how big of a dick he was to his coworkers the entire time.  I get that creative professionals need their space, and that ultimately it all reflects badly on him... But he really just mercilessly hated on everyone around him for an hour and a half of movie.

It felt strange though in that all the scenes and talk seemed to center around documenting Conan's tour, but far more interesting was his feeling towards fame.

There was humor, but it left me feeling sad. Very interesting mix of bitterness, and humor. While I enjoy snarky humor, this was a level of bitter and behind the scenes that I don't think left O'Brien looking very good. He was cruel to his staffers and excused it as keeping them on their feet. I do admire the staff for the ability to pt up with him. I would have resigned by knocking him out.

I really wanted to scream at him that being a jerk to the people who want to help and support you is not an admiral trait.

I suppose this was similar to watching Hoarders or Intervention. Similar to episodes where everyone around the star is just attempting to help and being abused for caring.

If you are looking for some lighthearted standup, this is not it. If you are interested in the aftermath of the late night comedy war, maybe.

Overall, not funny.",1392076800,2,910,4.3609467455621305

I admired his openness, and priority on showing the realities of this odd transitional act vs. worrying about being ""likeable"". He took a risk, performed this series of shows to stay sane, which in my book qualifies him as a true artist who does what he does because... he has to.  Very human, and ultimately likeable even when we see him being a hard-driving perfectionist with his staff. As he says, he's even harder on himself. And that shows in the enduring quality of his work. I'm an even bigger fan now, and got a much richer sense of Conan the person, beyond the performer. That was the level of openness he brought to the stage show, as well as this documentary about it.",1391904000,,872,4.512658227848101

It wasn't just being the boss, he's just a mean guy. Case and point: In a baffling scene, the unnecessarily  brutal and abusive bullying and verbal shredding of Jack McBrayer (30 Rock) makes him out to be a nothing more than a big, arrogant dick. A douche bag albino. (See? I can be mean too...) And when he's whining and moaning about being abused by NBC, all the while bullying those around him, I feel like he's a hypocrite as well. I get it. They screwed you. Corporations screw their employees. It happens every day to people who are neither rich nor famous. Getting screwed is a part of the human condition. Deal with it.

4594136,4,B005775M2C,"I was expecting this to be more about his actual show that he was doing on tour, but was pleasantly surprised to see that it focused more on Conan's separation from NBC and how he managed that before he returned to television.  I was amazed at how hard he works and how much time he spends with his fans.  Even though there were times where it seemed like he was fed up with the process that goes on with a tour, he always seemed to give it his all when he was interacting with fans.  It introduced me to a new side of Conan O'Brien that I didn't really know existed and it was nice to see that personal side of him.

If you're a fan of Conan, I'd recommend checking it out.  Just be aware that it's focused more on the behind the scenes stuff than the actual show that he did while he toured the nation.",1388448000,,804,4.063291139240507

Still, I wish there were more of a look at some of the other bits in his act rather than repeating the On the Road Again schtick ad nauseam.

Also Conan seems like a total jerk with his constant bullying of his colleagues, employees and even ""friends"" (I'm not sure of how strong their relationship is) like Jack McBrayer",1387929600,,469,4.583333333333333

I never got to see some of the skits that they showed in the making so that was disappointing but even without that it was a well done documentary. As an ambitious person I'm always thinking about achieving my dream but wwhat if I was to get there only to lose it after a brief taste. What torture that would be.

4594173,3,B005775M2C,"Having watched this a week ago, I can't shake the unsettling feeling I felt watching this man belittle those around him. It seems they all knew the drill, too: Better shut up once the be-rating starts and hope it goes away quickly. I suspect any verbal retort would be met with a deluge of vile from O'Brien. In fact, most of his staff just stands or sits with a goofy look on their face. We don't hear much input from them and are left wondering if they truly are just there as punching bags (literally--he punched his staff in the arm repeatedly in a way I've not seen an adult hit another adult absent all out fighting).

The saddest and most uncomfortable part of all this was when one of the backup singers brought her family in to meet him backstage. Certainly they were excited to tell their family they were singing with O'Brien when they got the gig. But then in the next scene we had to watch O'Brien be-rate his staff for wasting his time meeting people he didn't know or want to meet. How sad for that poor family and the singer. Did you not think they'd watch the movie?

The strangest part of all this is that O'Brien certainly watched this before it was released. And he saw this behavior and thought ""Man, I come off as a pretty decent guy."" One might hope he saw these horrid acts and said ""Hey, listen, we gotta edit some stuff out, and I seriously need to start treating people a bit better"" but no, he obviously saw nothing wrong with the behavior even after seeing it played back for him.

Perhaps I missed a joke here and everyone knows he's a great guy and this was all a put-on. If that's the case, then OK, this gets a 4, I'd feel a bit better.",1385078400,10,1669,4.275316455696203

His sense of entitlement is nauseating.  When so many have so little and find a reason to celebrate living why does this hateful narcissist get so much press?

4594182,5,B005775M2C,"After reading some of the more negative reviews about the way Conan treats the people working for him I had to review this documentary with my own honest opinion. I have seen a few documentaries about celebrities and the ones that feel real and honest feel that way because they are. Conan is a real person with real responsibilities. He may be a little hard on the people that work for him but remember that these people would not have a paycheck if it wasn't for him. He is essentially selling himself to the audience and he wants everything to be perfect. Most artists are like this. Conan is doing his best to put on a great show. As the boss he has every right to tell people when they are not doing a good job. I found Conan to be hard but fair with his staff. We don't really know everything that was going on at the time. All we know is what we saw on this amazing documentary that I personally found to be very funny, entertaining and real. I don't think Conan was ever rude to his fans at all. He gave out autographs to everyone that asked. Conan may have complained a bit but how many of you can say you haven't complained about work? I think that we tend to hold celebrities up to a higher standard. When you are in charge you cannot be the wimpy nice guy all the time. You want things done right. And if you are selling yourself to a crowd, you should be concerned about every detail. I think Conan is great and deserves all the good things that are yet to come. Conan O'brian Can't Stop is full of great humor and honesty and really shows off how hard Conan works and how much he cares about his fans.",1373328000,2,1615,4.196141479099678
4594183,4,B005775M2C,"At 46 years of age, Conan O'Brien has reached the pinnacle of success and fame, and whatever acerbic and penetrating wit he had when he was writing for the Simpsons has now been reduced and diluted into a soft likeable playful humor.  The documentary and Conan O'Brien's roadshow are premised on a sort of therapeutic anger management, Conan O'Brien being angry that he was unceremoniously fired from NBC and prohibited from being a media personality for 6 months.  And that interesting premise lasted for about a minute before we realize that we like Conan O'Brien not because he can channel his anger into comedy but because he's constitutionally not capable of getting angry at anyone.  And we soon clue in on that Conan O'Brien is working himself to death appearing before his fans in 35 cities across North America not because he wants to escape his anger or chase whatever fleeting fame he has, but because that's who he is and that's what he does.

This documentary then is a subtle and unconscious look at the cult of celebrity, at how a man is so drawn to the idea of being a star that he must always attempt to please his fans, and how people are drawn to the idea of a star.  The most nefarious aspect of this cult of celebrity is how Conan O'Brien surrounds himself with people who are always laughing at his jokes, whether or not his jokes are funny (mostly they're not) -- the dissent, the criticism, the negativity that are necessarily to fuel the creative process are all absent, and what's left is what we come to recognize as modern-day stardom.",1365120000,,1563,4.628158844765343

When Conan was warming up the audience he comes over to me, shook my hand and asked me something I don't remember because wow, it was Conan O'Brien.  I do remember him looking at me waiting for me to say something which I didn't and then he turned to the audience and said well he's not very funny.  Lol.  One of the best experiences of my life.  Anyway, DVD is awesome, Conan is awesome, what can I say, I don't think we can ever get enough of Conan.  He's incredible funny and incredibly nice also.",1363219200,,616,4.1344537815126055

4594190,3,B005775M2C,"Of the late night talk show hosts, Conan O'Brien's probably my favorite. I haven't had time to watch his show regularly for the last couple of years, but when I did, it always made me laugh out loud at times. From his own jokes, to the characters like Triumph the Insult Comic Dog and the cactus that played ""We Didn't Start the Fire"" on the flute, his sense of humor really appealed to me. There's no denying that what happened with The Tonight Show and him was absurd, and how he handled the situation made the guy even more likable...even more than when he paid his writers with his own money during the writer's strike a few years back! Conan O'Brien Can't Stop was a movie I was going to watch no matter what, and I'll admit that I didn't read up on what it was about prior to watching, so I didn't have expectations going in. Halfway through the movie, I was glad I didn't expect anything because this was a bumpy ride.

Can't Stop follows Conan along his national tour as he goes from city to city performing shows. Most of the footage is of Conan and his friends/co-workers behind the scenes or on the road, working on new material and talking about how much of a pain doing the tour is. At first, everything starts out well, and while it's something new for Conan to be doing, you can tell that he loves it. That feeling remains during his performances, but as he goes on, Conan begins to get irritated with little things like meeting family members of his co-workers, taking pictures with fans and more. To be honest, he comes off as an arrogant jerk a lot of times and it made me not like him now and then. Then again, can you really blame him? The tour took place shortly after the Tonight Show rumble and this was something O'Brien was new to: going on tour and performing in front of large audiences while doing skits and musical numbers, rather than sitting down and interviewing guests.

My favorite things in Can't Stop were the bits between Conan and his writers coming up with new jokes and material for the show. His assistant Sona, is the butt of a lot of the jokes and insults, but a good sport and has some decent bits as well (not to mention, she's easy on the eyes). It was surprising to go through the whole documentary with very little said about Jay Leno. When it did finally come up, it wasn't as bad as I was expecting/hoping, but then again, I'm sure they left out a bit as to avoid a lawsuit. Conan also opens up quite a bit on how he loves show business and interacting with the fans- entertaining them. He does everything he can to help people get into the show if there's a problem, and even when he clearly doesn't want to go out and sign autographs, he does it anyway.

But what takes a lot of the flavor out of this movie for me was how much time is spent with the musical numbers. Good god, it might as well have been a full concert special. I'm not saying the footage is bad, but it's really just Conan and his band playing well-known songs over and over again for a good portion of the movie. Time's even dedicated to this when he goes to a college reunion talent show and guess what, they play more music. It would've been nice to have seen a couple of full sketches from the show instead of a couple of minutes.

I'd recommend renting the movie once if you're a fan of Conan, and if you end up loving it, find a good deal and buy it. It's interesting to watch and see how he copes with the frustration of losing the Tonight Show the way he did. When it comes down to it though, there aren't very memorable moments in Can't Stop, which is a shame.",1335657600,,3589,4.281296023564065
4594191,4,B005775M2C,"I've heard from several people that his attitude in this documentary has damaged their perception of Conan as a person. In some ways, I can understand where they're coming from; his humor on a person-to-person basis is much more biting and acidic than it is on television, and the film's approach of basically lining up every joke told behind the scenes, back-to-back-to-back, does give the impression that he's constantly picking on anyone who dares to enter the dressing room. That it also cuts away so quickly after every punchline doesn't give us a chance to understand the context of the conversation or the target's response to his barbs. The japes are constantly funny, but that uncertainty about their reception ultimately keeps the laughs from flowing freely. There's also an impression that he's always on, telling jokes without taking a breath - even during quiet moments at home with his wife and kids. To some, that might make him seem imposing and attention-seeking, but I took it as his way of dealing with the stress of an overloaded schedule, uncertain future and relentless media attention that he was working through at the time, just weeks after his public blowup with NBC. Conan runs with a very funny group of guys, and their puns combined with the glimpses both on the stage and behind the curtains at his ""Prohibited Tour"" make for some great material. It's just not an entirely friendly atmosphere for unbridled comedy.",1334707200,,1444,4.946502057613169

4594193,4,B005775M2C,"By now everyone is well aware of the blunder NBC made when they decided to change things around with The Tonight Show. At first Jay Leno was going to leave to be replaced by the popular Conan O'Brien. Leno's ratings had drifted and they felt it was time for a change. The problem came when Leno's new show, on weeknights at 10, failed to draw and audience and he wanted his old show back.

The idea was to move Leno's show to 11:30 and move O'Brien back to 12:30 where he had been. It would retain the name The Tonight Show, but never happened. Unhappy with the move and the treatment he received, O'Brien turned them down and all parties involved considered going to court. Instead a settlement was reached and O'Brien was forbidden to appear on TV, radio or the internet, for several months. During this downtime, he formulated the idea of going on the road with a live show. This film was the result of that decision.

The film shows a behind the scenes look at O'Brien and how driven he is. The title refers to what the director noticed as he traveled and filmed, that while he might tire and grow restless, O'Brien just couldn't slow down. Repeated views of him meeting and greeting fans and family members of his cast and crew on the road show him always ""on"", willing to be there for people even though it gets to him. When accused by one fan of ignoring him he is stunned as he never walks away from giving an autograph and rarely turns down the request for a picture.

The movie begins with O'Brien suggesting that they do a road show, that since he can't appear in the media why not go live? It seems as if the whole idea begins as a joke but snowballs into a success story. Unable to appear on the internet, O'Brien tweets that tickets will go on sale online. The next thing you know tickets are selling out within hours of the announcement, second shows are being added and the whole idea blooms into reality. Now he just has to have a show to take on the road.

Rehearsals, meetings with his writers, band selection, all are parts of putting the whole together. And you can see as he does so that Conan is actually having the time of his life. The first show arrives and he genuinely has fun while on stage and in a subtle way you're able to see that he is taken off guard by the number of fans who come out to enjoy the show and support him.

Guests stop by here and there including Jim Carrey and a double hit of Stephen Colbert and Jon Stewart. But with each stop on the road, Conan is inundated by the fans, all wanting just to have a part of him, to touch and be photographed with him. This would be one thing but in the middle of telling his road manager that they need to leave him some down time in walks a cast member with her family. But Conan is too nice to complain or toss them out, so he gets into ""on"" mode and smiles for pictures, never ignoring a single person in the room.

The touring and the fans do eventually take their toll on O'Brien. He is a born entertainer, loving his time in the spotlight. But he wants to have time to himself and his family as well. We get glimpses of them in the film but my feeling was that he wanted to make them a part but not put them under the scrutiny of the public eye at the same time. Good move.

Watching pieces of his performances will make you laugh. Watching behind the scenes pranks and jokes will make you laugh. And seeing the man who walks out from behind the curtain now for who and how he really is will give you a new understanding of what drives him, how entertaining he truly is and a respect for him that few celebrities are deserving of. Conan O'Brien is the real deal and this film proves that.",1332201600,,3680,4.241084165477889

4594195,3,B005775M2C,More revealing than it needed to be. Not as revealing as we'd like it to be. The performance footage focuses more on music than comedy. The movie certainly supports it's contention that Conan O'Brien can't stop - and that he's happiest and most fulfilled in front of an audience.,1325808000,,279,4.714285714285714
4594196,4,B005775M2C,"Conan O'Brien Can't Stop offers viewers an intimate look into the life of the comedian after his acrimonious departure from NBC. Some of it works, some does not. Let's start with what doesn't work as well. There's so much of Conan making music that it becomes self-indulgent. He obviously wanted to do something different before settling into TBS, but let's face it: However good a musical hobbyist he is, people don't watch him for his guitar playing. He's a comedian, one who excels at taped bits, but his stand-up is also strong, particularly in how he interacts with his audiences. And that's where this doc gets good, albeit occasionally squirm-inducing.

O'Brien's anger at being screwed over by NBC propelled him forward on this tour, but what inspired him to sustain the grueling schedule was his desire, nay, need, to perform. As the days wear on, viewers are drawn into his struggle: He needs to be adored by his fans, but the constant meet-and-greets exhaust him. At first he does not seem cognizant of that paradox, but eventually he gets it. That powerful ""ah-ha!"" moment of self-realization, coupled with his continued vigor as his fans feed him more and more love, provides the viewer a squirmy experience. It's Conan's private dilemma, but he invites us to watch his petulance, his neediness, and how he uses humor to deflect his anger.

Those of us who like Conan O'Brien--his impishness and self-mockery during taped bits, his intelligence, his camaraderie with the lovable Andy Richter, his voices, how he uses his body while performing, even the fake laugh he deploys with guests--will enjoy this fly-on-the-wall look at him. Unfortunately, the documentary oversells his tour's musical component and he's simply not compelling enough a musician to pull it off. But he is a compelling and talented personality, and the result is a mostly insightful viewing experience.",1324771200,,1887,5.064308681672026
4594197,2,B005775M2C,"In the second late night wars of 2010 it was easy to side with Conan O'Brien over Jay Leno. Conan was the upstart, the underdog, who pushed his craft in order to create a unique brand of humor that owed plenty to early Saturday Night Live as well as David Letterman, but still refused to be shackled by his influences. He was also, unlike Jay Leno, funny. If you have choice between a comedian who makes you laugh and one who doesn't, then it's not much of a choice is it? So the documentary, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, which follows Conan on the live tour he assembled following his departure from NBC, has plenty of material to work with. The movie should have been an easy win. And yet, the documentary ends up being an unfocused piece of work that can't pick a single narrative strain to follow, or even to competently present the few moments of insight it manages to stumble across.

For some it might be a little shocking to see Conan O'Brien outside of his ""Conan O'Brien"" persona. Any performer on stage or screen is acting, even if that actor happens to be playing his or herself. Conan has fashioned a great character over the years. He plays himself as an anxious bundle of nerves who is at times nave, geeky, lascivious, and flummoxed. Certainly the ""real"" Conan is in there somewhere, but when we tune in every night we're watching a performance, not the Conan O'Brien who sits on his couch to kill a Sunday morning. But in Conan O'Brien Can't Stop, the person behind the persona can be funny, kind, cutting, vain, and somewhat bitchy. If the only version of Conan you want in your mind is the one who shows up on weeknights to tell jokes, then I would recommend skipping this film altogether. I'm sure plenty of people don't need to watch Conan O'Brien complain that his assistant fetched him food with too much butter, because he is, after all, watching his weight.

But for those who don't mind seeing the man behind the curtain, the film has some passing moments of insight, even if they mostly go unfulfilled. At one point Conan explains that he has a habit of telling ""jokes"" to his staff that are in actuality critiques of their work. There's an unspoken bargain struck between Conan and those working for him where he undercuts his complaints with humor but they understand that he does in fact want them to step up their game. These tense exchanges make sense. After all, Conan and his writers have been responsible for putting on a show five times a night for most of the year. That sort of output requires discipline, and you cannot fault Conan for applying pressure on his writers and himself. But even if we receive a few insights into Conan's process, the film never follows up on it. He is never asked who his major influences are, how he came to comedy, how performing late night differs from writing for others.

This complete lack of curiosity on the part of the filmmakers makes some sense, since the film is following Conan on his The Legally Prohibited from Being Funny on Television Tour. Besides, Conan's actual life seems rather run of the mill, a fact he plays on during his tour by telling his life story in the form of a Southern Blues song of hardship and pain before finally admitting to the audience that he was born to well to do parents in the affluent Boston suburb of Brookline. But the tour winds up being little more than an afterthought. The movie is less about Conan the artist than it is about this specific moment in Conan's life. For some reason the filmmakers felt that whatever is going on back stage was much more interesting than the pyrotechnics on stage, a tragic decision. There are several moments where we get to see Conan interact with guest stars who have joined him on stage in several cities, such as John Stewart, Stephen Colbert, and Jim Carrey. But we don't actually get to see Conan perform with these people. It's as if the director thought to himself, sure, I could show a clip of Conan and Jim Carrey singing a duet, but the audience probably just wants to see the two of them complimenting each other backstage.

And this is the most frustrating aspect of Conan O'Brien Can't Stop. We spend maybe twenty percent of the film watching footage from the tour (which is, admittedly, really funny) and about eighty percent of the film watching Conan and his entourage snap at each other as the pressures of constant touring increasingly weigh on them. The movie at times resembles a concert film, but with the percentage of music to interview is completely flipped. In another, fairer, universe, Conan O'Brien Can't Stop is the comedy equivalent of The Last Waltz, but here in our dull little world it's nothing more than a missed opportunity.",1324166400,6,4711,4.598097502972651

Maybe if we had seen contract negotiations in process to get Conan back on TV, or more Jack White, or maybe if they drove their tour bus over an opening bridge to escape the police during a shoot-out, this film would have been more engrossing. Still a really great film though and very interesting. 4 1/4 *'s out of 5, or 8 1/2 *'s out of 10.

I admit Conan acts funny in parts but his spoiled behavior really ruins the show here. When I watched this I felt like he is masking his egomaniac attributes and hunger for encouragement by alleged ""jokes"".

4594204,3,B005775M2C,"First, I must confess I really enjoy Conan's work.  I have since he took over for Letterman in the 90's.  As a college student and night owl I was often up late, and Conan's off kilter, format skewering show made me laugh... hard.  I loved that he was often the comic straight man on his own show.  I loved the characters.  I loved Andy. I loved Max. Above all I appreciated the apparent earnestness with which he engaged his audience and his guests.  I always suspected that I was witnessing some authentic part of him.  After seeing the film I see that I think I was right.

The film isn't a comedy, though it is very funny in parts.  It's a road log of the experience of dealing with disappointment, anger, compulsion, fear, and all the personal drivers that go into creating a ""successful"" entertainer.  I appreciate how vulnerable, real, and even petty the film portrays O'Brien.  I appreciate the love/hate relationship it portrays with those making demands of his time. I appreciate the portrayal of a business that demands your entire person, body and soul, and the difficulty of cordoning off some portion of both.  Overall I appreciated Flender's work here.  It is a bit austere.  No commentary, no voice overs.  Just Conan and his staff.  In the end it makes me appreciate Conan's work all the more.

As I said, it is very real. The documentary shows the happy, silly parts of Conan's tour and the sad, frustrating parts as well.

4594211,4,B005775M2C,"The battle for ""The Tonight Show"" was the sort of TV drama you couldn't possibly have scripted nor predicted. In June of 2009, late night talk show host Conan O'Brien took over the reins of ""The Tonight Show"" from its long-time host and Johnny Carson successor, Jay Leno. By the time 2010 rolled around, he was out of a job, replaced by Leno, bought off by NBC, and legally prohibited from television for nine months. Left with few options to bide his time, Conan hit the road with his staff to bring a new variety show to stages across North America. ""The Legally Prohibited From Television Tour"" made 44 stops and was mostly a success. This documentary, ""Conan O'Brien Can't Stop"" focuses on the entertainer's NBC drama and the ensuing experimental odyssey that came as a result of his lack of employment.

How much you will enjoy this documentary hinges solely on how likeable you find Conan O'Brien. If you never stayed up past 12:30 to see what ""Late Night with Conan O'Brien"" was all about or are one of the milquetoast types who preferred Leno to the creepy ginger on ""The Tonight Show,"" then ""Conan O'Brien Can't Stop"" will either go over your head or bore you to tears. Director Rodman Flender (who has such titles as ""Idle Hands"" and ""Leprechaun 2"" to this name) focuses as much on the subject's road show as he does the subject himself. All of the warts and imperfections of Coco's road trip are ruthlessly committed to film, for better or worse. For the first time, we see O'Brien as a perfectionist who literally can't stop. He can't stop talking, he can't stop joking and he absolutely can't stop even if it makes him look like a jerk in the process. There's a moment deep into the documentary where O'Brien himself acknowledges that he uses his jokes to subtly insult those around him and such moments of honesty (coupled with the fact that O'Brien himself approved the release of the film) find the host/writer/comedian coming out on top as a complex but utterly fascinating character. Even as he's ruthlessly ripping into longtime friend Jack McBrayer (of ""30 Rock"" fame) for absolutely no reason, you just can't help but root for him in the end.

While the film may not always paint its subject in the most flattering light, ""Conan O'Brien Can't Stop"" is still a fascinating and engrossing experience. Although it's obvious that Flender is only scratching at the surface of Conan O'Brien's madness, he reveals something that virtually nobody outside of the man's circle has seen: Conan O'Brien is a flawed, funny and often complicated human being who will stop at nothing to get laughs.

The 20% that surprised me was how arrogant and that he comes off as kind of a jerk. I don't know if that's how he actually is or if it is remnants of being angry at how he was treated. Either way it is actually good they put that in there so the entire documentary is not a pity party for Conan.

Really well done.",1312588800,5,244,4.809523809523809

He got to get away with alot more than any censor would have let him broadcast.
It will be good to see pieces of the other performances as well.",1311292800,,243,3.979591836734694
4594215,5,B005775M2C,"I loved this documentary and watching it made me respect Conan O'Brien even more than I already did. When the whole situation with NBC and Jay Leno went down, I was appalled at the unbridled greed, selfishess and utter lack of loyalty on the part of both parties. On the flip side however, I was extremely impressed with the way Conan O'Brien handled the situation. Rather than just take the money and change his time slot to appease NBC and Leno's self-serving whims, he chose to stand by his principles and walk away from the situation entirely. He did what he believed to be the RIGHT thing rather than the easy thing. On the contrary in fact...he walked away from a show he loved after being simultaneously knifed in the back and sucker-punched by the very company and people that made him a promise 5 years earlier and then just changed their minds to accomodate their own ego=oriented, money-drieven agendas. I don't see how anyone can have anything but respect for a person so willing to stand by their convictions even if it causes them great pain to do so. The documentary shows Conan exactly as he was at the time it was filmed - brutally honest, hilarious, self deprecating, sometimes bitingly sarcastic, sometimes cranky and clearly still reeling from the loss of his dream job, and all the while he pushes forward in an effort to recover, grow, try something new and most importantly to persevere even when it's really hard and dreams have been dashed by betrayal. Conan is an absolute inspiration. Anyone who likes to see good guys triumph wil be rooting for him all the way!",1311292800,19,1589,4.678571428571429
4594216,2,B005775M2C,"5 of the 6, Five Star Reviews are from the same People, I mean come on already. I understand that your fans of Conan and that he really needs them. Remember, there is a reason that he didn't make it on the Tonight Show, he's just not that funny and couldn't hold the original Tonight Show audience. He has a tired and very bland type of humor, that appeals to insomniacs, and couldn't come up with the talent to hold the mainstream Tonight Show viewers. It had nothing to do with any mysterious plot between NBC and Jay Leno, to get rid of Conan. Conan didn't want to go back to his previous slot, acted childish over his incompetence, and quit. Now don't get me wrong, Jay Leno is no Johnny Carson either, but he was at least able to capture the next generation of Tonight Show viewers. I think that the only difference between Conan and Charlie Sheen and their ranting over studio treatment is that Conan wasn't on drugs and looking like he was next in line to see his dealer. Conan has a talent for a certain type of audience, and they will always like him and therefore may always have a job somewhere, but stop crying about the talent he imagines he has, and try and improve, instead of staying with the tired old routines, like they are going to get better the next time he does them. Growth comes with change.",1310860800,3,1316,4.353658536585366

8460284,5,B005775M2C,"I liked this documentary because it really showed me how much work goes into a tour project focused on one star.  It takes a huge amount of energy aside from just being on stage.  It really showed the life warts and all,  That's what I paid for and that's what I got in this film.  And a labor of love for those who participate.  A must see for anyone thinking about what it takes to do this job called entertainment.  Well put together film.  Will stand as a classic.",1513728000,,468,4.191011235955056
8460285,3,B005775M2C,"In the history of television, I had always held out hope Conan was the only talk show host who wasn't drowning in self-importance and delusions of grandeur.  This is his way of showing us he's all that and worse.  His fawning over celebrities and needy codependence on staff certainly seem like obvious pitfalls that a Carson or Letterman would have been smarter about avoiding.  There is also a voratious hunger for applause that appears more desperate than other hosts.  Perhaps I am erroneously judging a man for the worst month of his life.  Perhaps I am not giving enough credit to him for showing flaws that 99.999% of celebrities hide.  Perhaps it's just the nature of showbiz and he will come out of the meat grinder almost the same nice boy he was at age 5 or 10...but I wouldn't bet money on it!!!",1511308800,,807,4.569444444444445

8460289,3,B005775M2C,"I think Conan is a creative genius.  I was upset when he was canned from NBC so that Jay Leno could resume his boring repartee.  I don't blame Conan for being angry  But this documentary just doesn't do it for me.  It shows him stressed out, angry, tired and fed up more than anything else, and his tour didn't seem that funny at all.  He toured college campuses and played his guitar, but this lacked the true comedic talents Conan has in front of the camera.  I like Conan best as a stand-up comedian and there was very little humor in this shaky documentary.

There were a few cameos of Eddie Vedder, Steve Kroft, and conversations Conan had backstage with his crew.  For diehard Conan fans, this shows him in his natural element. He went on to host a show on TBS but even that show isn't getting the fanfare the Late Night Show had with Conan last decade.",1482624000,,859,4.3584905660377355
