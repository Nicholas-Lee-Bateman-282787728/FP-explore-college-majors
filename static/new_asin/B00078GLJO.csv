It begins with a view of a European city; no people are seen. Then we see bodies on a street. Has the end come? An alarm clock wakes up a man. He is the lone survivor. [No other forms of life?] He has electricity. His shortwave radio receives nothing. There is garlic on a door; he needs more. He must find where they hide during the day. He sharpens wooden stakes. He picks up two bodies and puts them n the trunk of his station wagon and goes for gas. Then he drops the bodies into a large pit. Next to a grocery store for fresh supplies of garlic, then a store for mirrors. His search continues. At dusk he returns to his home to spend the night. Figures appear before his home and bang on the door with clubs. The next morning he goes to a chapel and falls asleep.

The Undead arise in the night! They attack but Morgan gets to his home. He views old home movies and laughs until he cries. Three years. He recalls earlier times. Can a plague be carried on the wind? Bob remembers the past. He worked in Chemical Research to study a germ. People tell stories about vampires. Then his little girl sickens and dies! Few people at work. Will everybody die? Bodies are thrown into a flaming pit. Bobs wife is next! Can she return from the dead? Outside the walking dead call for Morgan. Sunlight brings peace and quiet. As his car was destroyed Bob gets a Ford station wagon. He sees a dog run away and tries to find it. Later he finds it by his door. Everything is going to be all right he says. But theres a problem!

He sees a young woman, she runs away but he catches her. She returns to his home. Ruth Collins was married. She is afraid of garlic, a sign of infection. Bob was bitten by a bat years ago and believes he has immunity to the disease. Is Ruth one of them? She has a vaccine for it; there are others. They want to start all over again. Ruth was sent to keep Bob there so they can get him tonight. Bob treats her, she looks into a mirror and is not afraid of garlic now. Two trucks roll up, men get out to attack! Bob runs away but is pursued; he enters the Armory. The pursuers shoot at him. Bob explodes gas grenades. Bob goes to a chapel but is wounded. A spear is thrown - he is the last man on earth! They didn't know says Ruth.

This is a very low budget drama that seems meant as a symbol for the after effects of nuclear war, where radioactive fallout wipes out people by radiation sickness. Or some other plague that wipes out most people who do not have resistance to the disease. Global cooling in the 14th century caused food shortages and migrations. The Black Death wiped out about 30% of the European population. In time they recovered; the economic effect was the end of feudalism.",1497744000,,2746,4.204933586337761
