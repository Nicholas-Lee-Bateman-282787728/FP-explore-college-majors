8022424,2,B00025DZY6,"this is the first live action batman movie, filmed in 1943, during WWII. the main villian is a Japanese scientist. being the way that it was, there is alot of anti-japanese views displayed. not for the faint of heart or those suseptible to knee jerk reactions. the story is standard, the acting follows, but this being the first, it is a must have for true die hard batfans. i do not recommend young children watching this until they are old enough to understand that the predjudices in thes film should not be copied and they understand that during the war, feelings were heated. this is not the idea they should get of Batman at such a young age. Adam West is the impression they should have until their parents believe they are emotionally and mentally ready for this type of film. racism aside, the film is enjoyable.",1107648000,7,821,4.591836734693878
