8336884,1,B001QYBPT4,This DVD is more like a showcase of guitar players. Not instructional at all.,1454630400,2,77,4.571428571428571
8336885,5,B001QYBPT4,"Since I've recently got back into guitar playing, I've purchased several of the Homespun music instruction videos - some on DVD disc , and some as direct downloads from the Homespun website (there's pros and cons to both).

""Great Bottleneck Blues Lessons"" is one title I'm so glad I purchased on disc.

Not only do you get the tutoring and anecdotes from 9 different artists, but you are also treated to some phenomenal blues slide performances.

Picture quality for most segments is reasonably good, and the sound quality is very good, which is why I'm glad I got this title on DVD disc, so I can play it on my home entertainment equipment when I just want to watch and listen to the awe-inspiring playing.

Realistically,  I may never be able to do justice to most of these pieces, but the sheer joy these people display in performing their art make this disc a wonderful addition to any acoustic blues lovers collection.",1449273600,,924,4.679012345679013
