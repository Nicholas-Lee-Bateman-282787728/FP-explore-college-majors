2637968,2,B000HIVIWY,"Evil is the first ever greek horror film which deals with...zombies and because i'm a zombie fan and also a greek u can imagine my happiness when i heard about this movie so i went straight and watched it in a greek theater with many expectations but unfortunately although it was a nice try it had nothing to do with the superb romero series and it suffered with the disease that all greek productions are suffering. The lack of experienced actors but that's another topic.
 Anyways, if u are a zombie fan check this out BUT i warn you u will be tired as time passes by.
 There are some good scenes like the last one with the soccer field but that won't save the movie.
 A Cult movie because it's the first ever greek zombie flick but it will never be a classic one.",1196553600,,767,4.275862068965517
2637969,4,B000HIVIWY,"""EVIL"" is a good film with everything pretty much done right. We've got great characters, we've got zombies, we've got nice gore, and we've got a nice touch of humor and humanity thrown in too. There's definitely some great memorable scenes, but the problem is that they're not any more memorable than other films.

I wouldn't say this film is necessarily a ""by the numbers"" zombie film, but there just wasn't anything to it to let it stand out from others(unless you want to count that it takes place in Athens, which I don't). It's definitely worth seeing, and I'd have no problem viewing it again, it just seemed to lack a style all its own.

It's great, but felt to me a mashing together of styles and themes from other zombie films. So four stars instead of five, but this movie is still worth buying for any zombie fan.

Considering that a lot of other zombie movies that take themselves more seriously wind up either boring or awful, it really was a huge relief to me that ""EVIL"" was neither.",1180224000,3,999,4.50828729281768
2637970,4,B000HIVIWY,"...this is a pretty cool flick. However, don't let the cover art fool you. The zombies look nothing like that, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. The undead behave more like those from 28 Days Later, in that they run and move pretty quick, and they are not the decaying and rotting type since they have been infected by some sort of epidemic. I don't want to ruin the story for you, but I will tell you that there is plenty of blood, gore, and humor to keep you entertained for its one and a half hour duration. I didn't find the movie to be boring during any part, its nice that we get a foreign flick like this in its original language track (with english subtitles). It will make a worthy addition to your horror collection.",1170374400,2,733,4.280575539568345
2637971,3,B000HIVIWY,"Evil is a low-budget Frankenstein of a zombie film. Writer-director Yorgos Noussias clearly loves the genre, and he exploits it crazily. His zombies roaming Athens, Greece, are, in turns, shambling George Romero flesh-eaters, horrifyingly speedy 28 Days Later living dead, and wacky Army of Darkness targets for obscene violence. The main characters are, in turns, frightened victims, butt-kicking video game-like heroes, and the butts of Shaun of the Dead-like jokes.

If it sounds schizophrenic, it is. I found myself yearning to care about the characters, but then puzzled by the film's biggest battle scene, where our intrepid gang of strangers kill zombies by pushing axe handles through the backs of their skulls and tearing their heads off nearly with their bare hands. The film also falters in the nitpicky subject of zombie film's science is the question of how to kill what's dead already. Sometimes a bullet to the chest does the trick, other times these shamblers have to be thoroughly separated into their parts.

It's necessary viewing for for zombie-film fans thanks to unique moments-- a funny, sexy zombie-filled nightmare; zombie soccer hooligans; and a great closing shot. Others, though, should know this Greek salad is pretty inconsistent as a satisfying dish of horror.",1170028800,8,1291,5.2926829268292686
2637972,5,B000HIVIWY,"""Evil"" is a zombie flick. Pure and simple. What makes it stand out is the delirious cinematic glee that Noussias apparently had in making it. He throws all sorts of tricks at us: split screens that number up to seven frames at one point; 'hip-hop' edits; some CGI; and one of the most breathtaking, witty and creepy final shots ever made for this genre! There is also so much blood splattering that it actually hits the camera lens a couple of times! That ROCKS!",1170028800,5,462,4.511904761904762

8139812,4,B000HIVIWY,"I'm a lover of Zombie Movies, plain and simple. I enjoy the Higher Budget Ones just as much as the Low and No Budget ones. Evil is a lower budget one from Greece. And while it may not have all the money for high end effects, they make the best of what they have and the result is great. A lot of great Non-CGI effects. Lots of Gore. They mix in the Horror with a bit of Humor. It's a fun movie to watch. For me, the downside to this movie was that it really gave no type of explanation of why the event happened, or people trying to figure out why it happened. That's why it was rated 4 out of 5 stars.
Being from Greece, it's in the native language but does offer English subtitles.
It's a great movie to watch if you are a fan of the genre.",1384300800,,742,3.9205298013245033
8139813,3,B000HIVIWY,"3 & 1/2. Excellent on the gore effects. 8/10 on the splatter scale (mostly decapitations). Some really cool shots w/ multiple cameras. Trademark B-movie bad audio balance (though not terrible). Humorous and a decent mix of characters, my favorite being the crazy soldier. Especially with the inappropriate/strange music playing during action sequences, this definitely had the early Peter Jackson feel they were (I assume) going for. Pretty cool that it's from Greece, which makes it worth picking up for a few bucks. Not a must-see by any means, but splatter freaks (like me) will get their fix. No real story, just a random virus (or something? it's not explained or looked into), then a group of survivors meet up, find temporary shelter, it gets overrun, they fight, they run away, repeat. Incidentally, the Umberto Lenzi distinction must be made here: this was a film about ""infected a-peepul"", not zombies.",1339286400,,912,5.12751677852349
8139814,3,B000HIVIWY,"This movie falls into the ""frenetic zombie"" genre, not unlike 28 Days Later and the remade Dawn of the Dead.

It's at times frenetic, and at other times a bit boring. They never really define what the zombie plague is or whether it's an infection or something supernatural. But there's certainly more than enough action and zombie gross-outs for the jaded zombie movie fan to overlook some of its shortcomings. The fact that it's subtitled and not dubbed doesn't help much, though.

It somehow seems more like a rental than something to rush out and buy...",1260489600,,556,4.78125
8139815,3,B000HIVIWY,"This is a pretty good low budget zombie flick.  Either that or they people aren't dead and just infected like the modern horror classic: ""28 days later"" from the U.K. These killers run and attack in a decidedly non zombie manner.  The killers or undead or whatever in this movie are rather gooey when someone kills them just like a rotting person would be however as you can punch through them easily unlike a living person.  The movies budget was small with lot's of gore but the killers are generally not made up or rotting looking which makes it more like '29 days later'.  The acting is pretty good too for a low budget first timer flick and that helps.  It does have a extremely misogynist scene in that will offend any woman nowever.  After a zombie bites a female character who another character is trying to make love with , he gets angry that he won't be able to be with her. (in cruder terms) instead of being upset for any other reason.  This flick is a good romp through Athens though as the few noninfected humans try to escape the zombies.  The cover however is misleading as there are few rotting type dead people in this movie if any.  That being said zombie fans should enjoy this film well enough.",1244246400,,1215,4.436936936936937
8139816,4,B000HIVIWY,"First off, despite being billed as a gross-out comedy...this is neither.  Its never very funny and the gore/action sequences aren't serious nor particularly funny.  Its mostly a drama movie with zombies, gore, and a tiny bit of comedy occasionally.

Its amateur fair in some ways, but give credit to a worthy effort with no big mistakes.

The film makers borrow heavily from other movies. In particular ""28 day/weeks later"" and interestingly from ""run lola run"". The plot is straight out of 28 days/weeks with a group of survivors struggling to avoid the neo-zombies (the quick paced ones...""evil""'s are quick paced but stumbling idiots...a fun blending of the old and new school zombies). The filming has elements of ""run lola run"" with split screen takes of quick action and running...they even have a similar techno soundtrack for it.

The amateur comes across a couple of times in a minor ways: some scenes are obviously filmed under poor lighting situations. They are quite grainy. There is another scene where they are fleeing a group of zombies and then run into another group...the editing is confused at best. Thankfully, its a short take. Theres a few scenes at the beginning which are on screen far too long (like a close up shot of a man staring for several minutes). The worst, and its expected, is some bad acting. Mostly the actors are ok actually, except the ""young girl"" charactor: she says she's 15....um no...she's clearly in her 20's and worse she can't act. They gave her pigtails to make her look ""young"" and she's whinny as hell. They stopped just short of putting her in a jumper and having her carry a teddy bear around.  If it was meant to be funny it wasn't. It was just annoying. If they had a real actress, or an actual young girl who couldn't act, it would've been better. having an older wanna-be actress pretend to be a young girl....dreadfully bad.  All of these things, in the end, are minor however.  Even the young girl has some good scenes that make her worth while to the story.

In the end the movie is mostly a drama (ala 28 days/weeks) with some cheesy gore action scenes (I guess this is the ""comedy"", its fun but not funny). There are some ""jokes"" along the way but nothing funny and no where near as much attempts at that as the movie is a drama. Its a good watch with lots of potential even though it breaks no new ground.",1237075200,3,2367,4.616666666666666
8139817,3,B000HIVIWY,"EVIL has been called ""the first Greek zombie movie"". Well EVIL is certainly the first one to get any kind of exposure in the U.S. but opinion seems to be divided as to whether this is a good thing or a bad thing. The film doesn't explore much in the way of new territory with the exception that those killed by zombies become zombies themselves almost immediately, the rest of the film is pretty formulaic.

The story gets under way as 4 street workers suddenly go berserk after having had a weird experience in a previously undiscovered cave. Simultaneously, and with no advance notice, they transform into bloodthirsty, flesh ripping zombies in different parts of the city and gut munching madness ensues.  After that we follow two groups of characters as they run hither and yon trying not to become entrees for our famished and ever increasing horde of the living dead, until they finally join together for the film's last act.

If you're looking for the kind of terrifying tale George Romero created in NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD, look elsewhere. If you're after incisive social commentary you'd do better rewatching Romero's DAWN OF THE DEAD. If you want funny foreign zombies try CEMETERY MAN. Now I'm not saying that EVIL has nothing to offer, it just doesn't have any of THOSE things to offer. It does have some darn good gore scenes however that should please just about any zombie fan looking for mutilation with an ethnic flair. There are so many decapitations that I literally lost count. It also has a kung fu mama who can put on a fair to middling show unless you know much about the martial arts. She can also kill at 20 feet with a high heel--who needs shiruken? Its a brief 83 minute flick that has moderately legible subtitles. Subtitles aren't that important anyhow since no one talks much, they just run. The ending is a bit strange but you probably won't care since the characters aren't well developed enough to care about.",1233705600,2,1944,4.678362573099415
8139818,3,B000HIVIWY,"To Kako (Yorgos Noussias, 2005)

Well, I guess it was inevitable that every country on the planet would eventually try its collective hand at making a zombie movie. This one comes from Greece, which I've always thought of as a land of olive-skinned bathing beauties, feta cheese, and excellent seafood. Now, it seems, it's also a land of the undead.

It's got your basic zombie-movie plot-- all the sudden, there are zombies everywhere in Athens, and a small band of survivors have to fight them off. The difference between To Kako and so many other low-budget zombie flicks is that it's actually a comedy, but at least someone behind the camera was taking things seriously; there's enough well-done gore here to satisfy all but the most jaded of gorehounds, while the dialogue is rapid-fire witty. Still, you can tell it's a low-budget production; very few of the actors have any credits at all, and in the true Romero tradition, at least half the cast are also members of the crew. It's a labor of love, and it's certainly not a bad one. I've seen many worse zombie movies, some in the past week. This one's a great deal of fun, as long as you go into it not expecting brilliance. ***",1216339200,,1186,4.61611374407583
