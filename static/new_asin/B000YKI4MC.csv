What I have never seen is one clear, specific Nostradamus prediction BEFORE the event.  Riddles just are not helpful.  Supposedly various seers, including Nostradamus, have predicted the world will end on or about December 20-1, 2012.  Now, that's specific.

3031325,1,B000YKI4MC,"This is a complete rip-off!  I bought this thing only to find that right at the beginning, the author makes his one-and-only connection between Nostradamus and the Maya calendar, and it is wrong!  He says that in a newly found group of drawings by Nostradamus there is one that shows a picture of the sun along with a lion.  This, he says, links the sun with the constellation Leo.  Since Leo lies in the direction of the center of the galaxy, this links Nostradamus with the Maya calendar because the calendar ends in 2012 when the sun, at the equinox, is in line with the center of the galaxy.

This is wonderful, except that the center of the galaxy is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius!  Sagittarius is a constellation of the Zodiac, but it is nowhere near Leo!  The author says the Maya calendar follows the cycle of the precession of the earth's spin axis, which is about 26,000 years.  This is wonderful, except that the longest period that can be taken from the Maya calendar is 5126 years!  2012 is merely the end of one cycle and the beginning of the next; it does not say that the world is going to end.  Nothing in the Maya culture predicts disaster at the end of the calendar cycle.  This is like saying that we should expect doom at the end of every year instead of celebrating New Year's Eve!

There is nothing, anywhere in the book or the DVD that links the Maya calendar with anything that Nostradamus ever wrote!  If he wants to write a book about Nostradamus, let him write a book about Nostradamus.  Oh, that's right, he already did that!

8233218,1,B000YKI4MC,"My sons and I watch a lot of history documentaries, and I have repeatedly been appalled at how The History Channel sensationalizes, distorts, and blatantly misrepresents fantasy as historical fact.

I used to think the most blatantly inaccurate and sensationalized 'documentary' The History Channel had ever produced was one on the 'history' of zombies. I checked it out thinking, of course, that it was going to be a history of THE IMAGINATIVE CONCEPT of zombies (since zombies do not exist) but lo and behold within 20 minutes the 'experts' were talking about zombies as if it is inevitable that at some point in the immediate future Earth will be swarming with them! omg!

After watching most of this 'Lost Book of Nostradamus' (I finally had to turn it off because I couldn't take any more) I realize it is just as bad or worse than the zombie doc. First, Nostradamus lived during the years 1503-1566. The 'lost book' is dated 1629, sixty years after Nostradamus' death. Even if you accept the hypothesis that Nostradamus' son painted the images (to reflect predictions made by his father while his father was still alive), per Wikipedia, the images in the 'lost book' are copies of images from a medieval manuscript dating back to the 1300's -- so CLEARLY images drawn over a hundred years before Nostradamus was born are NOT predictions made by Nostradamus, whether his son later painted a copy or not!

Second, the 'experts' consulted are simply people who believe in Nostradamus: no genuine historian would claim that Nostradamus is an 'important historical figure.'

Third, both Nostradamus' genuine quatrains and the medieval water-colors in this 'lost book' can be interpreted to mean almost anything you want -- so it is completely bogus to state (gravely and matter-of-factly) that Nostradamus was a prophet and knew in advance about events happening centuries after his death.",1467676800,,1890,5.048076923076923

8233223,1,B000YKI4MC,"I was prepared to enjoy this special--not because I had any illusions that it would be intelligent, thoughtful, or well-researched--but because I thought it would be a bit of silly fun and maybe furnish a few ideas for a (fantasy) short story or novel.  Unfortunately, the ""experts"" consulted are so determined to make the quatrains fit historical events that they lose all credibility.  The one who made me really furious was the guy who said (and I quote), ""[Nine-eleven] was the most important event in world history.""  This idiot is supposed to be a HISTORIAN?  Clearly he has no concept of history, not even American history!

People like him are a direct result of the dry, date-obsessive, self-important way history is taught in this country.  If the people who work for the History Channel can't find history interesting enough to discuss and instead feel the need to wildly embellish events (or tell outright lies a la Ancient Aliens), then they shouldn't be working for the History Channel.  Or the HC should just change its name to ""Silly, Inaccurate Stories about the Past.""",1382400000,3,1086,4.934065934065934
8233224,5,B000YKI4MC,This should be bound and printed by the Vatican as a money maker. Many would buy it to read. A good analysis,1357257600,,108,3.9545454545454546
8233225,5,B000YKI4MC,"The Lost Book of Nostradamus is a great book to understand the way an astrologist knows the future from the past.  As the planets were lined up for a certain occasion and the Zodiac figures positions in the sky only show more how life is a cycle.  Funny this last time I caught the death of the King that lost his head in 1793 and then there was President Kennedy shot in the head 1993.  Cycles repeat and if the great minds of Nostradamus were more interested in finding the cycles instead of proving how they claim to know the astrologer Nostradamus and what Nostradamus is saying, they would have realized Earth was not physically over but the way of life known at this time was ending while the next life cycle begins.  That what cycles do.  How will we begin this cycle is up to mankind?  Even the Bible states: ""watch the sun, moon and stars and the planets for signs.""  How many things are actually cycling in your life today?",1356825600,,933,4.3895348837209305
8233226,5,B000YKI4MC,"This goes beyond the Nostradamus of most work.  This is the newly found book lost in an Italian library for years that somehow made it from the Vatican to the library and was miss-cataloged for years. Worth watching more than once. Worth having for subsequent reference.  It goes into more about Nostradamus than most hype movies and books do; and it actually shows the review teams going through the documents to determine their validity and some rather good speculations.  What I like is what they present as to where Nostradamus got his predictions.

Worth the watch and keeping if you're a history buff.",1340928000,,607,4.864077669902913
