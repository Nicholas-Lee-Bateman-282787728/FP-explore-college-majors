7806237,4,6300217442,"The gentle Canadian-ness of the story & George's bemused narration sealed the deal.

Plus, the animation had some little touches that weren't strictly necessary to advance the story.  Particularly the exhaust of the spaceship & the little robot guy.  I like it when somebody cares enough to go above & beyond just for the sake of it.

I can really see how this video would endear itself to a little boy.",1261958400,,403,4.633802816901408
7806238,5,6300217442,It is exactly what I ordered! I have loved George and the Christmas Star since the first time that I saw it and to have it on DVD will make it more enjoyable for years to come. On VHS I have already had to buy three copies - NO MORE! Yippee!,1243641600,,241,3.7450980392156863
7806239,5,6300217442,"How many of us have wished for something more? In this case, George, who seems to live in a nice two-story house in the middle of nowhere with just his cat as company, is preparing for Christmas, but is left with an empty feeling. His Christmas tree is missing a star on top.

After a few attempts at remedying this situation, he is left unsatisfied, until he looks out the window and sees the one thing that would make his tree perfect: a real star!! What follows is quite outlandish and over-the-top, but is enjoyable nonetheless. In short, George builds a spaceship (in a matter of seconds) and heads out to capture that star for his tree, only to be met with various space beings and obstacles along the way.

While this may not be your typical Christmas story, bordering on animated science fiction, the humor and over-the-top storyline make this quite an enjoyable show. Ultimately, after much trial, George learns that Christmas is not about a tree or a star. It's so much more....

I first saw this program when I was about 5 years old. It was part of a special holiday broadcast on WGN, hosted by Orville Redenbacher. We videotaped that showing, and have watched it faithfully for the last 18 years. With the deterioration of the VHS tape, however, we lost this precious Christmas tradition. I was incredibly happy to find it available here!!",1167264000,,1351,4.668067226890757
7806240,5,6300217442,"This is a video that needs to be put on DVD!

I have had a copy of this for years and now have my second. I watch it every year for the music by Paul Anka as much as anything else.

The point; Christmas is all around you!",1159660800,,221,3.5833333333333335
