8259137,4,B0015MS982,"I am a high school librarian, and from time to time I am given the opportunity to purchase items for the benefit of the school population. Over the past few years I have purchased titles from the ""The Unfinished Nation . . . Introduction to US History"" series. (One year I even collaborated with an American History teacher and combined our N.Y.C. ""Teachers Choice"" funds to buy titles in this series.) The DVDs cover the subject matter completely and touch upon certain themes that are not readily available elsewhere (at least that's been my experience) at a reasonable price. You may purchase individual titles to hold down costs or purchase a whole set (there are two sets). Sometimes a private individual lists these items on Amazon at considerably less cost than would an established vendor, and at that point I think it would be wise to take advantage of the price break.",1288569600,2,878,4.782894736842105
