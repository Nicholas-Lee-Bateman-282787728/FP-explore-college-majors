6790857,3,B00P8LS5PI,"The title, ""Frankenstein Vs. the Mummy"", calls instantly to mind the classic monster movie mash-ups of the past. The sight of Frankenstein dueling it with the Wolfman in ""Frankenstein Vs. the Wolfman"" comes first to mind. Maybe it is the similar titles. Perhaps it could be that the Mummy and the Wolfman are Universal monsters. Regardless, its a promise of gargantuan fun and monster mayhem entertainment that this film delivers upon.

  Besides being a sheerly enjoyable popcorn flick, the filmmakers also injected a confidence in the material that helps elevate beyond so many of the various entries in the genre. This movie takes nearly an hour to get going but uses that to tease with subtle scenes of menace (an old school horror fit that respectfully addresses the atmosphere of timeless creature features) and to build characters we actually care about (the surprisingly strong leads only further help this matter). It actually has a quite perfect balance between story, characterizations,  build-up and monster mayhem which is equally impressive.

It would also be easy to say that at 114 minutes this is at least 20 minutes too long. I'm not stating I disagree but even when the pace lumbers like the beasts that populate the screen its always amusing and the excellent make-up and monster effects are a source of constant wonder in such a shoestring budget movie. This, along with the likable decision they made to have Frankenstein look more akin ti Reagan when she is fully possessed near the end of ""The Exorcist"" (it even sounds eerily like Pazzuzu), only ups the anti on the enjoyment factor.

  Having sat through so many horror films lately which, either intentionally or unintentionally,  look as if they were shot on a camera in someone's basement I must say that the cinematography here is gorgeous and of considerable note. The movie not only feels like a Universal film but looks like it (minus being in color and not black and white). Again, the fimmakers have found the right touch with the cinematography coming across as so colorfully grimy and we still can't help but be reminded of Hollywood's glory days when Lon Cheney Jr. and Bela Lugosi held entranced audiences in their grasp.

  I wouldn't go so far as to call ""Frankenstein Vs the Mummy"" a great film but its easily the best low budget film of the year. It's harmless fun that will bring the kid out in all of us who grew up adoring the black and white terror greats of the past. In a time when most entries in the genre are about torture, sadism and barbarity it makes this title all the more worthy of being sought out and seen.",1424131200,,2616,4.776053215077606
6790858,1,B00P8LS5PI,"Spoiler alert: Frankenstein and the mummy do not even meet until the last 10 minutes of the show. Then, what you get to see is two guys wearing rubber masks having a knife fight in a dark alley--no kidding.

It is my guess that is not what you are expecting from a movie about a battle between these two legends of the big screen, and it was not what I was expecting either. Watch ""I, Frankenstein"" Instead.",1423872000,14,407,4.285714285714286
6790859,3,B00P8LS5PI,"Naihla Khalil (Ashton Leigh) is a popular professor loved by all...the Mummy (Brandon deSpain), Frankenstein's monster (Constantin Tripes), and a horny college professor (Max Rhyser).  A cursed mummy is brought to the same university that Victor Frankenstein is performing re-animation experiments using body parts brought to him by the sinister janitor, no questions asked. You can guess from the title what pretty much happens.

It is not the worst film imaginable from the title. They did spend some money on special effects. Then again , I would say it was less entertaining than ""Cowboy vs. Alien."" Okay as Redbox rental.

6790860,2,B00P8LS5PI,"I tried really hard to like this movie. After reading these reviews I was all set to buy it.... Luckily I didnt. As far as B movies go it isn't horrible but there's a lot that I didn't like. The fact they made Frankensteins monster look like an 80s glam rock member not to mention making the monster a pervert and rapist. I didn't like how they made the monster smart enough to talk, smoke and retain his former memories/ personality. The mummy wasn't horrible but the mummy from tales from the darkside lot 249 looked better. They could have gotten bigger/ taller actors to play the monster and mummy, make them more intimidating. I was hoping for a more climactic battle at the end but was let down again, A knife fight from the monsters.... Really. I understand this movie had a low budget but I can't help but think it could have been done better. I still give it 2 stars for effort. Its worth atleast one viewing but I am just glad I didn't spend more than $1.50 at redbox.",1423699200,,978,4.3497267759562845

Making a SUSPENSEFUL indie horror on a low budget is near impossible but this one brings it and gives me hope for other low budget filmmakers. The special effects and make up are crazy good (no cgi needed) and were all made and executed by Mr. Leone, who is also the writer, director and editor. Knowing that he held all those roles makes watching this film even more astonishing. This is worth the watch.",1423612800,,544,4.561224489795919

6790865,5,B00P8LS5PI,"I found this to be a very entertaining horror movie, there are so many straight to DVD horror movies these days and its hard to judge which ones are any good, the movie however is of a very decent budget and has a pretty entertaining story that im surprised no one has tried before, basically what happens is Doctor Victor Frankenstein (A modern take on the character) is obsessed with trying to re-animate human flesh after death to extend life as we know it (Due to a tragic past event in his life) As a genius doctor at a medical university he has been conducting these experiments for a long time secretly in the basement of an abandoned building, meanwhile elsewhere in the university the corpse of an Egyptian pharaoh has been brought there to be studied but the soul of the pharaoh is not dead and it comes back from the dead as a living breathing unstoppable mummy! As Frankenstein's creation also rages out of control its only a matter of time before they meet and battle each other! First off as a horror fan im pretty open to silly monster movies and this one works really well especially as the effects are really decent, there is some really bloody kills and plenty of great gore which was a surprise, the make-up effects look great on both the mummy and the monster, the cast is not bad I guess, I think overall this is really worth checking out, its a great fun horror movie that's had a lot more effort putting into it than usual, certainly better than anything Hollywood puts out lately, one for the collection!! And at 1hr 50mins long too which is quite impressive!!",1429747200,2,1584,4.503472222222222

6790868,3,B00P8LS5PI,"I love the classic Universal and Hammer horror and monster films. The Universal pictures of the 1930s and 1940s capture my fancy because of their black-and-white shadowing, atmosphere, and theatrical acting. The Hammer movies feed my appetite for Technicolor gore, gothic settings, and even more dramatic turns from two of my favorite genre actors  Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. Writer / Director Damien Leones Frankenstein vs. The Mummy puts a modern spin on and combines both the tales of Mary Shelley and the story for Boris Karloffs 1932 original conceived by Nina Wilcox Putnam and Richard Schayer.

In ""Frankenstein vs. The Mummy,"" Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Max Rhyser) and Egyptologist Naihla Khalil (Ashton Leigh) are both professors at a leading medical university. Victors latest grisly experiment is the re-animated corpse (Constantin Tripes) of a sadistic madman and Naihlas most recent find is the cursed mummy (Brandon deSpain) of an evil pharaoh. When the two monsters face-off in an epic showdown, no one is safe from the slaughter. Can the murderous rampage be stopped and the carnage contained before its too late?

Writer / Director Damien Leone does his best at paying tribute to the classic monster mashups of Universals heydays of horror. We got to see Frankensteins monster go up against the Wolf-Man and team up with Dracula on a few occasions. For anyone who grew up watching these movies, it only makes sense that youd want to see Frankenstein vs. The Mummy. Who in their right mind wouldnt? Unfortunately, Leones ingenious way of marrying the two tales together ends up leading to a rather lackluster battle between the two iconic creatures that will leave audiences feeling unfulfilled.

Frankenstein vs. The Mummy is not rated, but if it were would probably be a hard R or NC-17 because of the amount of graphic gore. It also includes adult situations and sensuality, violence, profanity, smoking, and frightening and intense scenes. The sensuality and adult situations revolve around an unnecessary sex scene that adds nothing to the story and a couple of attempted rape scenes with the monster assaulting Naihlia.

The movie is only available on DVD and comes with one special feature. Audio commentary is provided by Writer / Director Damien Leone and Cinematographer George Steuber. Im a little surprised someone didn't document the making of the movie considering it is so heavy in the makeup and practical effects departments. It wouldve been cool to see behind-the-scenes of the gruesome butcherings and makeup applications.

Frankenstein vs. The Mummy is an admirable attempt at capturing the glory days of the Universal and Hammer monster movies. Weak acting and lulls in action work against the film as a whole. I do have to give credit to Writer / Director Damien Leone for trying to build up the story and character motivations, but here it only serves to slow down and put off what everyone watches the movie for in the first place. We want to see the big showdown between Frankensteins Monster and the Mummy, which is way too short when it finally arrives. In the movies defense, there are some great gory practical effects and a few bloodcurdling scenes that made me cringe.",1426464000,,3222,5.069811320754717

6790872,3,B00P8LS5PI,"I have to say, I rented this on one of those 'color boxes' outside of a store kiosks, but felt it necessary to rate it here.

When first seeing the cover, I figured it to be a new release of the old 'Karloff-Chaney' flick from the 40's(?), but after reading the summary, realized they had remade something akin to it, so I had to get it and check it out.  A lot of 'good-and-bad' in the movie, but at the end, I had to give it at least 3-stars (ideally, it's a 3.5), and here's why:

It starts out slow, campy, solid-B, maybe flirting with being a C-flick at some points; but that fades away as the story and the acting improve dramatically (stay for the first 30-minutes, against your will - you'll like the last hour). The actors are relatively 'no-name' new kids, but they do have some chemistry together, and decent 'entry-level' skill that improves dramatically throughout the movie.  The plot and timing greatly improve as well.

Overall, the special effects and moreso the makeup, are very good for a B-movie! I actually was satisfied throughout on this facet.  The story, in the end, is rather solid with an excellent 'ending' that helps you accept that pitiful start.

In the first 30-minutes, I was regretting renting it. In the next 30-minutes, I started paying more attention looking for more things to be critical of, and not finding them. In the last 30-minutes, I was solidly sold on it being a good movie (couple of questions about 'why here' or 'explain that' but overall, not gaping holes in plot or reason. Overall good continuity (overlooking that near comatose start).

Worth a few dollars to rent.",1425600000,2,1619,4.636363636363637
6790873,3,B00P8LS5PI,"How could I pass this one up Frankenstein vs The Mummy.  Fans of the classic monsters always jump on these no matter how hokey they are and of course I am no different.  I love a good monster flick.  We had all the Universal Monsters the Karloff, Lugosi, Lon Chaney Jr. movies and then in the 60's and 70's we had all the monsters at it again with Hammer films and Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee.  While this isn't in their class it was entertaining and they did have a short face off at the end.  It was like two story lines in one as two professors are in love,  the female professor has brought a cursed mummy to the campus and the male professor is Victor Frankenstein who is putting his monster together in a old building near the campus.  Both creatures get to knock off a few people before they run into each other for their showdown.  My one knock on the film was the casting of Boomer Tibbs as Professor Walton, he just looked too old and feeble for the role.  He grabbed and held two different women who I would venture to say could have kicked his butt.  But hey, for a B flick it was okay, better than the average B.

8686916,2,B00P8LS5PI,"There is a really long build up before Frankenstein is actually vs the Mummy. In the meantime you are forced to watch a romance between two characters that the film has given us exactly zero reasons to care about. The special effects are actually incredibly impressive but the acting is less so and the film ultimately suffers from not giving us what we want - monsters! - and instead giving us what we really don't want - a boring romance between two pieces of cardboard. When it's good, it's really good but that is maybe fifteen minutes of the entire film.

I purchased this blindly based on a very good review on AICN and the fact that it is independent (which I try to support) but ultimately I regret it because I really can't see myself bothering to ever watch it again.",1480896000,4,777,4.471830985915493

8686923,3,B00P8LS5PI,"Although this film runs a tad too long at 115 minutes, at least the title delivers on its promise. This is not your 30's & 40's version of Frankenstein's Monster and the Mummy, because this is a rather gory flick, but when was the last time you saw a pair of legendary monsters square off (and I do not consider Al Adamson's DRACULA VS. FRANKENSTEIN [1971] a legitimate battle because, let's face it, the film is barely watchable)? I can't think of any other film besides FRANKENSTEIN MEETS THE WOLF MAN (1943) as the last legitimate serious horror film where we saw two monster icons fight to the death. That's a long, long time. Even though you will have to wait until this film's final 15 minutes to see the monster bashing, there is thankfully a lot of gore in the rest of the film to keep you happy.
After the film offer this quote from Mary Shelley: ""Thus strangely are our souls constructed, and by such slight ligaments are we bound to prosperity or ruin."", we are in the modern-day, where Dr. Victor Frankenstein (Max Rhyser; who acted in the film RAZORTOOTH [2007] under the name ""Max Rishoj"") is handing a pile of cash to university janitor Carter (John Pickett), so Carter can supply him with fresh corpses for his experiments. Victor is a teacher at the same university and this week's subject is ""The Philosophy of Medicine"", where he asks his students what it means to ""exist"". One student replies so we try to be immortal like God and Victor agrees, telling all of them that they have a piece of God in them; they just have to find it and use it to their full potential (Victor is most probably an Atheist and the word ""God"" basically means to him the ""creation"" of life.). Another teacher at the university, Naihla Khalil (Ashton Leigh; AMERICAN HORROR HOUSE - 2012), who is Victor's girlfriend, has just returned from an expedition to Egypt to study pyramids and has come back with a 6th Dynasty, 3,000 year-old mummy named Userkara and has brought him to a lab in the university (""Artistic License #1"": No country, especially Egypt, would let an artifact like that ever leave their country). This is one of the oldest mummies ever found in the world and Victor notices that his ears are missing, where research scientist Isaac (Robert MacNaughton; the oldest brother of Henry Thomas in E.T. THE EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL [1982], in one of his very few films as an adult) tells Victor that his ears were cut off while he was still alive (Victor says, ""He must have really pissed someone off!"", to which Naihla replies, ""You don't know the half of it."" I wonder what she meant by that?). Isaac also says that an ancient scroll was found next to the mummy, written in a language not seen before (apparently, he was an evil pharaoh not written about in any texts or ancient books) and when Naihla translated the scroll, it says in effect that Userkara's soul is trapped within his mummified body for eternity and anyone who dares to desecrate the body are doomed to an agonizing death (""Artistic License #2"": If the scroll was written in an ancient language no one has ever seen before, how did Naihla translate it?). The piece of scroll describing how to release Userkara's soul is missing, but ""greater-than-thou"" scientist Professor Walton (T. Boomer Tibbs; PARANORMAL ASYLUM - 2013) thinks the scroll is nothing but a scare tactic put next to the body to deter tomb raiders from stealing artifacts from Userkara's crypt. He couldn't be more wrong. It seems Carter doesn't acquire corpses for Victor, he creates them, as we seem him viciously stab a homeless man (Martin Pfeffercom) in the stomach with a long knife and then cut the top of the bum's head off with a hacksaw, removing his brain. Cut to Victor and Naihla having a romantic dinner, where she jokingly accuses Victor of being an Atheist (which I believe he is) or a Satanist (which I firmly believe he isn't), for having different views than her on life and the afterlife (She says that old standby: ""There are powers on Earth greater than anyone can imagine."").
Professor Walton, not heeding the scroll's warning, cuts open the mummy's chest when no one is around and a gas is released from the incision, knocking the Professor out. When he comes to, he now has some type of psychic connection to Userkara and Isaac returns from his dinner break to discover that the Professor has removed the oldest known stone carving of the Eye Of Horus (an ancient Egyptian symbol of protection) from the mummy's chest. The Professor then proceeds to slit Isaac's throat with a scalpel, making sure that the blood flowing out of the gaping wound covers Userkara's face. The mummy absorbs all the blood like it was never there and then we hear the sound of a beating heart. Victor tells Naihla that he got into medicine for a reason: His mother committed suicide (she slit her wrists in a bathtub) when he was a very young boy and, since then, he wants to know if death is permanent or if it can be reversed, something he has never told anyone before (then we have the prerequisite nude lovemaking scene). The next morning, Naihla goes down to her lab (Victor has left earlier without saying goodbye, which pisses her off) and discovers that something was removed from Userkara's chest. She also notices that Professor Walton is acting very strangely (he tells her he has been suffering from headaches) and he also acts very strange when he is teaching his students about Horus (the ancient Egyptians' national patron god who was usually depicted as a falcon-headed man wearing the pschent, or a red and white crown) and cuts the class short. Female student Lenora (Stefanie Merola) agrees to meet the Professor later that night at the lab to talk about an internship.
We finally see Victor working in his laboratory, when Carter enters and demands $30,000 for the bum's brain. If Victor doesn't pay him the money, he will implicate him in the murder of a homeless man. When Carter notices a dismembered human hand moving by itself, Victor has no choice but to throw acid into Carter's face and then stab him to death (In Victor's defense, he was lying down on his back holding the knife when Carter tripped and fell on it so, technically, Victor is not a murderer). With the bum's brain in pieces on the floor, Victor has no option but to use Carter's brain (that would not be my first choice), so he grabs a hacksaw, cuts off the top of Carter's head and removes his brain, then stitching his piecemeal body together and shooting it full of so much electricity, the body begins to smoke. He is heartbroken because he thinks his experiment was a failure and he totally misses a date he set up with Naihla that night, which even pisses her off more. But was Victor's experiment actually a failure? Lenora shows up at the lab to talk to the Professor about the internship, but Userkara (Brandon deSpain; who also played the mummy in the Danny Glover DTV disaster DAY OF THE MUMMY [2014]) rises from his table for the first time, rips out her heart with his bare hands and eats it (he even makes the Professor eat a piece!). Userkara orders the Professor to bring Naihla to him, while Victor chops-up Carter's body, stuffs the pieces in plastic bags and hides them under a grate in his floor. He also notices that his naked creature is missing from the gurney and, when he turns around, the creature (Constantin Tripes) bites Victor's hand, but Victor is able to knock out the creature with some chloroform and chain him to a wall (in a tribute to the original Boris Karloff FRANKENSTEIN [1932], Victor yells out, ""It's alive!""). The creature, who has the ability to speak and read, is still as ugly as my Aunt Martha without her makeup.
Detective Brynner (Rahul Rai) is brought in to investigate the disappearances of Lenora and Isaac and Naihla thinks that the Professor is responsible, but she has no proof. The Professor tries to get Naihla to get close to the mummy, but she doesn't trust him and leaves the lab. Victor tries to apologize to Naihla for the missed date and leaving her bedroom early without saying goodbye, but she sees the bite on Victor's hand and follows him back to the lab. She watches Victor talking to the creature, when Victor notices her spying on him and catches her as she tries to run away. He tries to explain to her what he is doing. but all she can say to him is, ""You're insane!"". The creatures breaks free of his shackles on the wall and plots revenge against Victor (remember, this is Carter's brain in the creature). A nosy security guard enters Victor's lab and the creature rips his innards out, followed by removing his lower jaw with his bare hands. When Victor returns alone to his lab, he discovers the creature is now dressed in Carter's clothes and knocks Victor out. When he wakes up, Victor is chained to a pipe and the creature tells him that if he doesn't transplant his brain into a better-looking body, he will kill Naihla (a few moments before, he sees his monster face in a mirror and breaks it, not worrying about a seven year curse). Userkara then kills student William (Daniel Rodas) next, pulling out a piece of his brain through his nose using a thin metal instrument with a hook on the end (the way Egyptians prepared their mummies in ancient times).
Both Frankenstein's Monster and Userkara are interested in Naihla, so I think we can all see what is coming: a monster brawl. Poor Naihla can't catch a break no matter where she runs, so she grabs a gun on the lab's floor, pumps a few shots into Userkara's body (with no effect) and then heads to Victor's lab, where she frees him with a well-placed shot to the chain. Naihla is one smart cookie, though, as she convinces Userkara that she is his superior by talking in his ancient language (""Artistic License #3"": How did Naihla learn to speak a heretofore unknown language in such a short time?) and tells him to kill the Professor. Userkara stabs Professor Walton and then cuts off his tongue, nose, ears and eyes (he squishes the eyes in his hands) then kills Victor and impales Naihla on the leg with an ancient spear, but the final 15 minutes are pure monster destruction. Frankenstein's Monster and Userkara get into a royal rumble, where they fly through walls and use anything they can find as weapons. Frankenstein's Monster finally wins, cutting off one of Userkara arms, ripping out his heart and pulverizes his head by using his fists like a vise. Seeing that Victor is dead, the Monster tries to kill Naihla, but Victor isn't quite dead yet, as he plant's a cleaver into his creation's cranium, killing him. Victor then actually dies, but not before telling Naihla that he loves her and telling her to burn his journal so no one can replicate his experiment. She takes a can full of gas, douses everything with it and sets it on fire, watching her love, what remains of the two creatures and Victor's journal burn to a crisp. Now taped off as a crime scene, one of Victor's students, Trevor (Sean Rogers), tears down the tape and finds Victor's microcassette recorder beneath the burned journal (""Artistic License #4"": Wouldn't the Crime Scene Unit have found that recorder as evidence?). The recorder still works, as Trevor listens to Victor describe his experiment from beginning to end. A new Victor Frankenstein is born.
Like I said earlier, the film is overlong, has some major plot holes and could use some judicious trimming, but director/screenwriter/editor/special effects makeup artist Damien Leone (ALL HALLOWS' EVE - 2013; which was also released on a double feature Blu-Ray with the film MISCHIEF NIGHT - 2013) makes a pretty good monster film, complete with some excellent makeup and gore effects (both Frankenstein's Monster and Userkara look terrific and the gore scenes go far enough for this film to be released without a rating and they are expertly done). My only real problem with this film is that Max Rhyser as Dr. Victor Frankenstein is a little too genteel to be taken seriously as a person who would defy the law to get what he needs. He comes off like some stable person who wouldn't hurt a soul (and would attend peace rallies), even though his experiments scream otherwise (Let's not get into a discussion on whether desecrating a corpse is nothing but a misdemeanor. It does affect the victims' family, whether they know about it or not.). He just isn't menacing enough. He's like the TWILIGHT (2008) version of Dr. Frankenstein. It seems like his experiments are merely a sideline, as it takes more that half the film to actually see him in his lab. The scene where Carter is talking to the homeless guy before he kills him is one of the film's most effective scenes. Carter asks the guy all types of questions, like why he doesn't stay at a shelter (""I'd rather be in prison instead!""), if he has any friends, his daughter (the bum has a blanket his daughter made him and he tells Carter as long as he has this blanket, it doesn't matter where he sleeps) and other personal questions, leading up to the homeless guy getting stabbed in the gut, with Carter's other hand over the bum's mouth telling him, ""Your daughter will never have to worry about you again."" It's a telling scene about how Carter picks out his victims because, even though he's a psychopath at heart, he still wants to make sure that his victims' deaths affect as few people as possible. Even though the film sports a 2015 copyright, I had the feeling that this film was made earlier, because the last description of Victor's experiments that he left on his microcassette recorder was dated 2013. Besides the film's length and some very apparent plot holes, this is a pretty decent monster film that delivers on its promise and tosses in plenty of bloody gore. Also featuring Malika Franklin, Nicholas Deluca, Alexis Lear, Nick Siano, Bryan Payor, Tien Law and Christine Simon. An RLJ Entertainment/Image Entertainment DVD Release.

8686924,2,B00P8LS5PI,"I was so excited to see this movie and found it on youtube I was shocked because I thought it was not coming out until the Summer time but I guess I was wrong. So watching the movie I found that it was boring. The chemistry between Dr. Victor Frankenstein and Naihla Khalil wasn't really there for the movie and again boring. I just felt that the guy who played Victor Frankenstein wasn't really into it an did not fit the part very well.
I thought maybe Professor Walton would have been more of a good character to play Victor Frankenstein instead. The mummy to me was the only good thing holding the whole movie together. The mummy was good a big budget film would had, had it done better but overall I enjoyed it. The Frankenstein's Monster I thought was terrible. The monster eating, learning to read, write and speak killed it for me. I understand that the brain he was supposed to get was smashed and replaced with a killer, but still. They face was not bad on the monster but the transition from the neck to the body was bad also a monster built from other parts of people should not be built and even if the torso was it would start to deteriorate. The cover looks great and all the battle between the mummy an the monster was good, some of the points during the movie were okay but overall in my personal opinion it could have been better if only the monster would not have spoken and been smart. I am not going to buy it and I suggest watching it on youtube first before buying it. Others ma love it but I am a huge horror fan and well it was not good,",1432166400,,1562,4.2274247491638794
