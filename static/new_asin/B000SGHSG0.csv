8205302,3,B000SGHSG0,"I got this because I'm willing to try all the other Power Ranger series just to see what they're like, and I heard about how infamous this one was & wanted to see it for myself; especially since the next episode of History of Power Rangers will be for this.  They say it's the worst... but I didn't think so.  Granted it is down there with Turbo, Lightspeed Rescue & Mystic Force, but it's not the worst; that honor goes to Mystic Force (I'm sorry, I could not get into that series if you were holding a gun to my head).  Was this flawed?  Yes, but it had potential.  Here's a review of the episodes, with synopsizes from Wikipedia.

605-606.  Kick Into Overdrive:  Explorer Andrew Hartford finds the crown of the Corona Aurora, an extremely powerful artifact which, when reunited with its five missing jewels, could be used for good or evil.  However when he inadvertently awakens Moltor and Flurious who also seek the jewels of the crown, he recruits four talented citizens to become Power Rangers and plans to become the Red Ranger.  However ,when evil forces attack, it is soon left to Andrew's son Mack to take action.  I thought this was an above-average pilot, certainly the best episode here.  Yeah, the villains aren't the best, but Moltar is fine & Flurious is tolerable though Nog(?) is annoying.  I'd take Elgar over him any day.  But I thought the story was interesting & the heroes engaging.  Too bad the next few episodes won't live up to the potential.  A-

607.  The Underwater World:  The search for the first jewel of the Corona Aurora begins when Andrew discovers Atlantis.  Believing the first jewel to be hidden there, the Rangers travel to the undersea continent however problems arise when Will refuses to cooperate with the rest of the team.  Not fantastic, but not bad.  B+

608.  Heart of Blue:  With the scroll from Atlantis, the Rangers need to find the other two in order to continue with the jewel quest.  Meanwhile Dax falls in love with a girl named Mira, but seeing her is interfering with his job.  A good episode, though flawed it is redeemed mainly for a decent twist and the introduction of a villain that's actually interesting.  B

609.  Weather Or Not:  As the Rangers prepare to head to St. Lucia to search for the first jewel Moltor steals a weather machine and prepares to destroy Earth with it.  Mack questions his status as the Red Ranger when he puts a bystander in jeopardy.  However when the Weather Machine manages to defeat the Zords and traps the other Rangers in a chasm, Mack must put his doubts to the side if he is to successfully pilot the newest Zord, the Drill Driver.  This is where I started getting bored with the series.  It's not horrible, just boring.  And it has the most stupid creation of a monster ever (the weather machine forms stuff into the shape of a monster around it and it comes to life... how does that even begin to work?!).  C

610.  Pirate In Pink:  The Rangers begin the final leg of the first jewel quest on St. Lucia, however while the other Rangers worry about running into the ghost of Brownbeard the Pirate,  Rose refuses to believe in the supernatural spirit.  However the ghost of Brownbeard does turn up also searching for the jewel, Rose finds herself forced to trust him while trying to keep it away from Miratrix.  Another so-so episode.  C

I was into the series at first, but then it got stupid and/or boring.  But after I saw the first 2 episodes, I ordered volume 4 since it has the Once a Ranger episodes on it.  I look forward to them, especially if they're the best episodes of the show.",1382486400,,3587,4.5328125
