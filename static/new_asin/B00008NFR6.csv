1853978,2,B00008NFR6,"I was very disappointed when I finally received this long-anticipated DVD. The performance itself was very good, but the way it was filmed was a HUGE disappointment. There seemed to be only one camera angle-- focusing on a small part of the stage for the entire length of the performance. There were NO shots of the entire state, and in scenes where action took place in more than one part of the stage at the same time, the ""Pan and Scan"" method ws used-- cutting off most of the stage and then switching to the other side. I saw the original Broadway show with Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazie, and know that there was a LOT going on on stage, and that this film sidn't show it all.
  Another big problem with this DVD is that there are no extras. I was hoping for cast and crew information, plus some ""Making of"" features, but there were none. In addition, there were NO closed captions!  I watched the PBS presentation of the film, and there were closed captions on TV.  Why were they not included?
I hope that there will be another edition of this film, because this one just isn't worth it.
My rating: the performance itself: 4.5 stars; the DVD, 2 stars.",1053043200,16,1165,4.429906542056075
1853979,2,B00008NFR6,"We were very disappointed at the presentation, and may return the disc. Some production aren't worth keeping in our library, and this may be one. The view jumps frequently and annoyingly, especially during the dance sequences. Flashing to a closeup for half a second may have been fun in the editing booth, but is distracting on the screen. We couldn't tell if the choreography was bad, or simply looked that way due to inappropriate cuts and camera angles. A suggestion: when everyone's on stage in a big dance number, show the whole stage instead of jumping from one closeup to another.
 The story's funny, which is why we bought the DVD, but I can't recommend this DVD to anyone who expects to get the feeling of a live performance. It isn't even up to American Playhouse production (ie; low budget) standards.",1052870400,4,813,4.76595744680851

The singing is also outstanding and though there's not as much dancing it is really good when there is. Sometimes the songs drag on a bit (you think they're over but they're not) but becuase the overall play is so excellent you can stand the long songs. The two that play Frederic Graham and Lilli Vinessi are fantastic! They are deffinitely the best in the show, they have such star quality. When they sing you feel like they are singing to you and they have a very powerful presence. Not to mention that the play is totally hilarious, it had my sides splitting.

1853998,5,B00008NFR6,"I always feel slightly traitorous when I watch this version of Kiss Me, Kate. I grew up listening to the Broadway recording with Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel. I sang along with alto Ann Miller on her songs. I loved the slightly naughty songs. When I watched a locally produced version, I could see it all so clearly. That version was the one I loved

Sadly, I was disappointed with the original movie released in 1953. When I finally got it on DVD, while the voices were wonderful, the songs had been bowdlerized and moved.

Then I saw this revival on TV. My faith was restored. Here were the songs I knew and loved. However, some part of me still yearned for Keel's voice.

This movie has all the naughtiness of the original stage version. It makes me laugh with all its silliness and wit. And Brent Barrett and Rachel York do admirable jobs with the songs. York, in particular, captured me with her portrayal of Kate.

If you like musicals or have ever seen the play on stage and want those songs, then this is the version for you. It is stellar. I watch it more often than the 1953 film because of the songs, staging, and York's performance.",1485648000,,1147,4.447619047619048

It was a live performance of the 1999 revival, filmed at The Victoria Palace Theater London, the theatre in which it was staged, and in front of a live audience.

Brent Barrett as Fred Graham / Petruchio
Rachel York as Lilli Vanessi / Katherine
Nancy Anderson as Lois Lane / Bianca
Michael Berresse as Bill Calhoun / Lucentio

The presentation is clear and the sound is well recorded. You do not have to be a Cole Porter fan or even familiar with Shakespeare to appreciate this lesson on the evils of gambling and its consequences.",1341100800,,744,4.7153846153846155
1854024,4,B00008NFR6,"""Kiss Me, Kate"" was intended to be performed on the stage, and those who have never had a chance to see it performed as such finally get to see it as its authors intended it to be seen. The songs are quite obviously Cole Porter -- witty, imaginative lyrics bristle with double and even triple meaning, and the melodies stay in your head for days afterward, or, as with ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare"", for weeks.
The book seamlessly blends a musical version of Shakespeare's Taming of the Shrew with a backstage romance or three, managing to stand on its own while doing what it was obviously meant to do (showcase the Porter songs).

Brent Barrett is in fine form as Frederick C. Graham, showing off his impressive comedic and (as much as the book allows) dramatic chops. Vocally, he's no Brian Stokes Mitchell, who originated the role in the Broadway revival, but he still possesses a powerful baritone, which he shows off to great effect, particularly in the reprise of ""So In Love"".

Rachel York also delivers a sublime performance as Lilli Vanessi. Although her belt isn't as strong as other modern leading ladies like Donna Murphy or Marin Mazzie (who originated the role in the B'way revival), it still packs a mean punch.

Despite having two established musical theatre personalities in the starring roles, they are kicked to the back seat whenever Nancy Anderson, as promiscuous yet monogamous ingenue Lois Lane/Bianca, enters the scene. Ms. Anderson chews up the scenery whenever she's on stage, always stopping just short of overdoing it. She brings down the house with her showstopping rendition of ""Always True To You (In My Fashion)"", exuding personality, sensuality, and naive innocence simultaneously. Her performance alone is well-worth the price of the DVD.

The remainder of the cast is filled with solid performers, led by Michael Beresse (the sole remaining holdover from the original New York revival) as Ms. Anderson's romantic interest; Nicolas Colicos as the bombastic General Harrison Howell; Nolan Frederick as Paul, Fred Graham's personal dresser; Kaye Brown as Hattie, Lili Vanessi's personal dresser; and Alan Vicary as the stage manager.

The sets are well-done, staying mostly realistic with the necessary touches of formalism that the logistics of a stage production demands. Chris Hunt's sure-handed direction stops the production from veering into camp, keeping it at a steady, clipped pace.

Lastly, the camera work is thankfully well-done, transferring a production conceived and performed on a theatrical stage to television without robbing the show of its spontaneity. The close-ups and editing techniques that the camera allows actually enhance what was already a critically-acclaimed, Tony-winning show.",1338249600,3,2740,5.230068337129841
1854025,4,B00008NFR6,"A classic is something constituting, serving as, or worthy of being a pattern to be imitated. And Shakespeare knew how to write them, but Cole Porter too. So if we get the both of them together we can never get wrong.

Porter and Samuel & Bella Spewack made a great use of the original play and went a little further. They used it to create a play inside a play. So we have a Taming of The Shrew on the stage and another one outside.
It is the opening night of a new production of The Taming of the Shrew and the two stars Lilli Vanessi and Fred C. Graham are  going to work together again after a bitter divorce. Both are temperamental, vain and in love with each other. We also have a secondary love story between Lois and Bill who are Bianca and Lucentio in the play. She is the protegee of Fred and can we say a little more, but of course she loves a rascal. And finally our third couple, a pair of gansters who are there to  get the money from an IOU.

Personally I have always loved the film version, if only for that wonderful scene of Fron This Moment On, with a glorious Bob Fosse and an spectacular Carol Henley, but this version is funnier.
Rachel York who plays Lilli has been a favourite of mine since The Scarlett Pimpernel. She has a great voice, strong and with a wide range of registers. Not in the vocal sense only but in the performing part. She is daring playing Lilli also funny and obnoxious. Personally I think she is better than Marie Mazzie, who is a little too bland for me. Her So In Love is great, and even when  the tempo is faster than the usual versions I have heard I love it.
And Brent! what can I say about Brent? I simply adore the man. I liked him even more than I liked Howard Keel, and that my friends is saying a lot. He sings everything perfectly, and in the reprise of So In Love...well I am speechless Mitchell , I think, is  at a lost playing Fred. Brent just shines. He is mean, funny even rude but he is Petruchio/Fred!. He owns the show and I can only say Bravo!

The rest of the cast is excellent Nolan Frederick as Paul shows us how It's Too Darn Hot must be sung, although Ann Miller will always have  aplace in my heart.
Kaye Morgan plays a convincing Hattie and the rest of the cast  is great. So why not 5 stars?
Well, maybe it is me , and maybe I am still too much in love with the Hermes Pan choreography of the 1953 film but honestly the scene of Tom, Dick and Harry was painful to watch . Michael Berresse is a competent dancer but the other two are just like me...and that is not a good thing. It was excruciating  to watch. No rythm, no choreography, no nothing! Bad, very bad. Fortunately there were Rachel and Brent to save  me for more pain.

1854032,1,B00008NFR6,"I had higher expectations when I purchased this DVD.

I was not disappointed technically but I was EXTREMELY disappointed with the acting as a whole and with the uneven singing of Rachel York.  She couldn't seem to decide whether she wanted a pop, jazz, or traditional musical theatre sound.  Her voice was all over the place.  Furthermore, I found her character very annoying...she was screechy and not at all vunerable.  I preferred Kathryn Grayson's performance in the movie as she managed to be vunerable, witty, and charming, as well as screechy, demanding, and somewhat tyrannical.  Truly, I could barely watch this entire video and at the end I could have cared less if Fred and Lilli got together.  I think that was the most powerful statement for me.

The production was acted (or directed) with a lot of mugging and so much of it was over the top.  Can today's directors PLEASE leave something for the audience to think about and figure out themselves?  Everything need not be a commentary!

I wish I had seen Marin Mazzie because I heard she was incredible. Rent this before buying it or better yet do what I did and buy it used.  It hardly cost anything and that is what is it worth.",1145577600,9,1195,4.6380952380952385

1854034,2,B00008NFR6,"My enjoyment of the PBS telecast was just fitful.  The production itself

was just breathtaking - faithful to the time period, expensive, detailed and

colorful. The costumes were of a quality one rarely sees anymore -

imaginative designs, the attention to detail, and color coordination was all

beautifully done.

  The two stars, Brent Barrett as Fred/Petruchio and Rachel York as

Lilli/Kate, are both movie-star handsome, exceptional in this regard, and

looked their parts to the hilt. York especially looked like a 1940s lady of

the theatre, while Barrett really does look like a matinee idol.

  I was far less pleased with their performances and singing.  It's not

that I don't doubt their talents; they obviously have star quality.  But

whose idea was it to have Fred and Lilli behave like spoiled, bratty, whiny

children?  The kind you see on TV sitcoms - immature, silly, and really,

really dumb-acting.  These two were quite unsavory, ridiculous, even

unsympathetic characters. Everything was way over-the-top.  Furthermore, all

of the constant mugging, overacting, eye-rolling, excessive broadness and

exaggeration of expressions wore thin after a short while.  Rachel York

repeatedly screamed, shrieked, yelled, caterwauled and went beyond behaving

like a mere shrew: the show turned into The Screaming of the Shrew.  This

Lilli had no sophistication, class, dignity, warmth, irony or even

wit...even her sarcasms and irascibilities were all wrong, too

teenage-princessy...she was a high-decibel harpy and little else.

  Brent Barrett was a little better, but he still came across like an

excitable high school kid.  Fredric Graham should be a aspiring-classical

actor type - albeit vain, hammy,  insecure and prone to an inflated sense of

his own-alleged greatness; but a child he's not.  Fred should reek of

Martini and Rossi-smoking-jacket-cigar savvy and larger-than-life

sophistication, yet edgy, rattled in a way only overambitious actors can be.

It's strange, seeing Barrett, this tall, athletically built,

distinguished-looking actor, made to behave like an overgrown teenager...

sort of like one of those men depicted in sitcoms...childish, foolish-acting

and an irritating air-head.  Even his speaking voice (as used here), when

under pressure, cracks and acquires that puberty-falsetto (think Tom Cruise

when he yells).  He's not anywhere believable as an aspiring classical

actor.

  I had even more misgivings about York's and Barrett's singing.  Yet I

can't blame them exactly; very few people on Broadway nowadays exhibit the

kind of fundamental classical training that was obligatory at one point.  I

couldn't tell whether York knew what she was doing; her singing displayed a

combination of pop vocal crooning, along with some jazzy inflections - yet

there were hints here and there of some operatic leanings. As a result, none

of her songs coalesced properly; it seemed as if each register, wherever the

song in question took her, revealed a different kind of stylistic realm.

Barrett, again, was a little better, but he too lacks a truly fundamental

technique.  The middle part of his range seems natural and easy, but the

higher he goes the tone spreads and sounds constricted all at once; you

can't take a pop voice production of tone and expect it to bloom properly.

Moreover, Barrett was often afflicted with a troubling vibrato. From what I

can hear, when he speaks properly, there is quite a beautiful, resonant

voice in there somewhere, but he's misusing it at practically every turn.

  A digression: watching Howard Keel in the film version, I'm more

convinced than ever that his performance as Fred/Petruchio is THE classic

embodiment of the role in every way.  Keel was among singers, an

outstanding, instinctive actor, and brought to the role the kind of

distinction it required.  It did not hurt that he was tall, distinguished

and imposing (he looked great as Petruchio, so Shakespeareanly dashing).

Keel's Fred Graham was ultra-masculine, exaggeratedly vain, ambitious and

yet somehow mature and imbued with depth; Barrett didn't even begin to

convey these latter qualities.  And Keel's voice - deep, vibrant, correctly

produced and gorgeous in tone quality,  was one of the best of its kind for

the baritone leading-man roles to be had.  His accounts of the songs are

matchless.

  More troublesome though, was how York and Barrett interpreted their

songs.  Even the simplest melodies were tugged, pulled, underlined and bent

out of shape, as though to make the audience understand every little

inflection, and bring across the mood with all these exaggerated

""espressivo"" effects... but all these gimmicks and schticky touches ruin the

songs.  ""I Hate Men"" was the most idiotically overacted spectacle I've ever

witnessed.  ""Wunderbar"" is a beautiful melody whose words are parodical: yet

the tune in its beauty should be retained and preserved.  York and Barrett

tried to make the song the magical moment it can be, but their voices did

not blend, and the song failed to surge as it should (as Alfred Drake and

Patricia Morison made it so).  Ditto for ""So in Love,"" (still a bit

overemotive and swoony by York) though it was mercifully spared from being

mangled in this production (Barrett came closest to producing the most

moving moment near the end in this tune).  For the most part though, most

of the songs as performed here didn't work for me...Porter's music was

poorly represented (the voices didn't serve the score) and Porter's lyrics

were banged up and slammed in every which way AND loose.

  One of the pleasures of the two original cast albums (the first in Mono,

the second done especially for the then-new Stereo era) was Lisa Kirk's Lois

Lane/Bianca.  Kirk brought a special brand of street smart babe-sexy

sultriness to the role, helped by that deep, knowingly sensual timbre she

owned.  Her renditions of Lois's songs are dynamite, are Broadway classics,

and what's more, made the role into a real character, not just the secondary

comedy lead.  It made for a terrific contrast to Patricia Morison's

high-minded lady of the theatre voice and personality.

  Nancy Anderson in the PBS telecast was made to embody a completely

different Lois altogether...and I hated it.  Lois was here into a

nasal-voiced, dimwitted kewpie doll.  She spoke and sang in a pinched,

""dum-dum girl"" tone, and so the songs failed to come to life.

  The rest of the cast did fine...the ""Too Darn Hot"" number was

wonderful, spicy, insinuating and catchy.  But it serves little point in

analysing the other factors, because the main elements were too compromised

for me to enjoy the show as a whole.",1111795200,15,6726,5.180281690140845
1854035,5,B00008NFR6,"I can't even begin to describe how excellent this show is!!!!!!! The performances are soooo incredible. Brent Barrett and Rachel York are, as always just superb. Ms York as we all know is one of the most versatile performers toay, and this I believe is her best performance. She was bron to play Lilli, as was Mr. Barrett to play Fred. The singing is deffinately some of the best. Of course, nothing can beat the original with Patty Morison and the late Alfred Drake, but this is my second favorite. I prefer it to the Mazzie/Stokes Mitchell recording. I don't know, the singing seema stronger here. Also, you can see them as opposed to just hearing them. Brent is be-ootiful and taked hold of his character exceptionally well!!!!!!!! And Rachel is gorgeous, especially in the Wunderbar scene. She really has a demanding role, she must sing beautifully (which she REALLY does) scream her head off like a mad women (which she does EXCEPTIONALLY well) she must seem bossy, tyranical, tempermental, bossy, harsh, while also seeming vulnerable, wounded, and a bit frightened, and sad at times. I LOVE THIS SHOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",1109462400,5,1121,4.936507936507937
1854036,2,B00008NFR6,"I was very excited to see this, having seen the original cast (lead by Marin Mazzie and Brian Stokes Mitchell) on broadway. For some reason the energy of this cast does not transfer into the audience. Brent Barrett, I'm sorry to say, is a sad replacement for Stokes.

The one reason I'd give to watch this is Rachel York, who seems to be perfect in just about every role she takes on. I saw and loved Marin Mazzie, but Rachel York can certainly hold her own. She has a wonderful voice, amazing comic timing, and is quite beautiful on top of it all. She embodies Lily Vanessi brilliantly in this production. It's just a shame that her fellow cast-members can't do the same.",1103068800,3,672,4.463414634146342

It also felt thrown together and not well rehearsed with number dragging on longer than they should and others rushed. Rachel York was OK (she was better in Scarlet Pimpernel)but this is not her best performance at all.

All in all a disponting version and hard to see how it won a Tony for best revival..but then this isn't the original cast from that Tony winning revival so that may be the problem.",1101427200,3,478,4.558139534883721
1854038,5,B00008NFR6,"Based on the Amazon customer reviews that my husband and I read of the two versions of this musical that are available on DVD, we bought both of them.  We started with the other (classical Hollywood) version, and watched until I commented that it really bothered me that so many of the bawdy lines had been censored out.  What's the use of Cole Porter without the naughty bits?  So we switched it off and watched this production instead.  We loved it from start to finish.  One of the highlights was the duet, ""Brush Up Your Shakespeare,"" in which the marvelous actors playing the comical Chicago-style mafia thugs take us on a tour from vaudeville to burlesque to Music Hall, evolving the song stylistically with each repetition of the chorus.  Altogether a wonderful night out at the theater that I would highly recommend to anyone who treasures the rare wit of Cole Porter.  (And the little wink between sisters Bianca and Kate makes the over-the-top final soliliquey of submission palatable.

Someone else might say they prefer the Hollywood version, with its superior technology, orchestration and dancing.  But I was put off by the liberties taken with the original script--cutting out so much of the Shakespeare, all the racy little jokes and bad words (the word ""bastard"" hit the cutting-room floor in that era, and ""louse"" just doesn't have the same impact).  I also didn't appreciate the song ""It's Too Darn Hot"" sung by her as a bizzare sort of strip tease tap dance.  If that's to your liking, you may well prefer the old classic film.  It left us both wondering why Hollywood can't seem to find the balance between the pendulum swings of Puritanical censorship and today's tasteless oversexing.  Bridget Bardot once said that in Europe, sex is a fact of life, but in America it's an obsession--and it comes out in the unhealthy-feeling treatment of sex that Hollywood films have tended to offer us.  So--enjoy this charming theater piece instead!",1093132800,24,1959,4.879154078549849
1854039,3,B00008NFR6,"I've seen a production of the original script (college), the movie version, the Broadway revival, and this version when it was first shown on PBS.  While the performers were adequate, something about the pacing of this performance cast a pall over the show.  The director opted to have characters draw out sequences that would have played better up to speed (Act I finale) and let other characters toss their lines away so quietly and so quickly that I wouldn't have known what was said had I not been so familiar with the show (Bill Calhoun).  I tend to collect as many Broadway and movie musicals as I can, but this effort will not become part of it.  If you have never seen a version of the show before, you should find it mildly entertaining, otherwise see the older movie version.",1089936000,2,785,4.585714285714285
1854040,4,B00008NFR6,"A worry I always have with filmed stage shows (as well as modern movie musicals in general) is that very few directors these days seem to be able to direct the filming of a choreographed dance routine.  Worried about a static camera, they jump around and, worse still, give us close-ups of the dancers' faces. Looking back to the MGM and Warner musicals of the Golden Age, one can see that letting the dancers and choreographer do thier stuff and filming it with the minimum amount of technical flourish is the way it should be done. I am pleased to say that this filmed stage production of 'Kiss Me, Kate' mostly gets it right and shows off the staging both of the dances and the frantic dramatic action to it's best advantage.
Brent Barrett and Rachel York are absolutley fantastic in the leading roles, as are all of the principals (in particular Michael Berresse as Bill Calhoun, who fleshes out his character beyond the typically under written 'romantic lead'). Barrett plays one of Broadway's most complicated and demanding male roles with confidence and great emotion when required.  York sings like an angel, screams like a banshee and pulls faces that could stop a clock as well as get the audience rolling in the aisles. Speaking of audiences, one way in which this production suffers is the seeming lack of an audience. Although there are laughs at the jokes there is no applause after the numbers.  This seems a ridiculous omission, particularly considering the theatrical nature of the piece.
The re-written role of Harrison Howell, changing him from a boring cattle-baron to an agressive military man, jars as does the bizarre inclusion of a song for the character - 'From This Moment On'. The scene in the show involving Howell being mocked and eventually put to sleep, surely must rank as one of Broadway's most perfectly crafted and witty set-pieces.  The re-written version on this DVD pales in comparison.
Cole Porter's best score is well served both vocally and visually (although I believe 'Brush Up Your Shakespeare' is wasted) and the set and costumes are beautiful.  I feel that the lighting is lacking in places, creating some gloomy scenes particulary in the 'Shrew' sequences which surely should be vibrant to the point of tackiness. The direction and performance during the 'Shrew' parts of the show are a real highlight - showing that Shakespeare can be fun - particularly when accompanied by a Cole Porter score!
Unless you're mad about gimmicky 3-D camera angles or a sanitized version of the show that avoids the B-word, avoid the Howard Keel, Katherine Grayson film and invest in this infinitely superior version of one of Broadway's gems.",1074470400,19,2672,4.902654867256637
1854041,4,B00008NFR6,"In all honesty, if you saw Brian Stokes Mitchell, Marin Mazie and the rest of the gang in the lead roles, then go and watch this... of course, it would be hard not to be disappointed.  Mitchell in particular has a persona that can electrify a room by a mere harmless stage entrance... In fact, that was my impression of seeing him in KISS ME KATE, straight from RAGTIME...  The second he made the walk on stage, I was like ""wow...""  - - With that said... Kiss Me Kate is no more... and like most musicals, the ""original broadway recording cast"" moved on long before the play itself ended.  - - The jury... a FANTASTIC cast as long as you don't compare it with the original of that production - - but as is true with most musicals, the camera simply doesn't do it justice.  - - For some reason, when it comes to broadway musicals, the human eye is superior to even the most well directed of camera men...  And this is doubly so in a musical like Kiss Me Kate which is such a madcap and fast moving musical you'd think that Cole Porter was on high doses of Amphetamines and Moxie cola when he wrote it.
Overall : The verdict...  I enjoyed the Broadway Revival Production (w/ Stokes/Mazie/Spanger, etc.)  more than the movie... but yes, if you're going to compare one cast to another... yes, you're bound to be disappointed... but if you simply watch it without the comparisons, this cast and performance is well worth the money... and unless you have a time capsule and can travel back in time a couple years... this is as good as it gets.",1069027200,7,1537,4.387323943661972
1854042,3,B00008NFR6,"I'm definitely a Rachel York fan -- she was a SCREAM in the Broadway production of ""Victor/Victoria"".  But on the whole this production of ""Kiss Me Kate"" seems a bit flat.  The songs are fine if a bit dated in style, but the production design for the stage show comes across as a bit low-rent.  It looks like very good amateur theatre at best.
Rent this if you can before commiting to a purchase.",1064534400,5,396,4.324324324324325

I wish there was a tad more dancing (as I did when I saw the show), but all in all it was good.  I wish there had been some more features, like interviews with the cast.  However, this DVD is enjoyable enough on its own!",1061251200,,472,4.306818181818182
1854059,1,B00008NFR6,"Before reading this, please keep in mind that I really REALLY wanted to enjoy this recording...
Ok, so on a whim I decided that I'd take a chance and purchase this DVD. I actually saw the tour of this production in Minneapolis and though I wasn't particularly impressed with what i saw, I figured this recording would most likely be superior and I picked it up.
Now, I saw Rachel York perform the role live and though she is an undeniably terrific singer, her acting isn't as swell (She's still the best thing about this DVD). Brent Barret is a fine actor and magnificent singer, so I'm quite thankful for him as well. I found Nancy Anderson rather dissapointing in the role of Lois and didn't find much enjoyment in Michael Beresse's performance either. I'd also consider myself a champion for ensemble actors, but I didn't really think any of them displayed much punch either. Some of the roles also seem miscast (I'm sorry, but Hattie is just dreadful).
Though the choreography is top notch, the dancing looks sloppy, the sound quality IS poor and the overall energy and tone of the piece is bizarre and stagnant.
After viewing the show, it occurs to me that ""Kiss Me, Kate"", while boasting a magnificent score, is a rather awkward show on stage and its structure and messages are just cumbersome and a little too dated for modern tastes.
I would suggest simply purchasing the 1999 Broadway Revival Cast Recording (which is stellar) instead of spending the extra money for a lackluster product such as this.",1059091200,6,1510,4.723484848484849
1854060,3,B00008NFR6,"I came away disappointed after my first viewing of this DVD of the London production of the Broadway show. Perhaps I'll like it better after subsequent viewings. Initially, I'd have to say it is a not entirely successful video capture of a stage musical. But it does offer enjoyment, and any musical-theater fan should add it to his/her collection.

First, the pluses. Let's start with Rachel York. She's a joy and a vocal marvel. Just as good in a different way and loads of fun is Nancy Anderson. Brent Barrett is charming and he sings well, although sometimes I wish the effort were less apparent and his vocal production were freer. After that, there's really no one worth pointing out, and some, in fact, don't seem of Broadway-stage quality.

Although this production won a Tony for ""Best Revival,"" I have hard time seeing why. Perhaps I'm too fond of the movie, which zips along nicely and has spectacular dance numbers (Tommy Rall, in particular, is amazing). The stage version has less creativity, dancing that is much less impressive, and some a-tad-too-long numbers (forgive me, Cole Porter). It is a benefit to get the uncensored versions of Porter's lyrics, though.

Although the sound on the DVD is fine, one very annoying feature is that the audience response is handled differently throughout. My sense is that they were trying to emphasize the show-within-a-show aspect by technically diminishing the audience response in the backstage segments. Perhaps it was a noble experiment, but in the end it failed. We know the whole thing is a show, and the audience response should have been heard consistently from start to finish.

Also making this DVD a lost opportunity is the total lack of extras. You don't even get bios on the cast.

To sum up: If you collect live musical theater and want to encourage more filming of similar performances, buy this DVD. The three leads I mentioned above will make it worth your while. But I'd also buy&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-Me-Kate/dp/B00008AOWI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss Me Kate</a>&nbsp;(1953 movie) and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Kiss-Me-Kate/dp/B004H83IKU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Kiss Me Kate</a>&nbsp;(1958 TV production). Although I'd take York and Barrett in a heartbeat over Kathryn Grayson and Howard Keel, the movie has not-to-be-missed dancing (the groundbreaking Bob Fosse and the stunning Ann Miller -- in the same film!). And the TV version -- truncated and with primitive picture quality, it must be said -- has the original stars of the stage production, including one of the greatest Broadway performers ever, Alfred Drake.",1058572800,10,2707,5.513253012048192
1854061,3,B00008NFR6,"As a person who absolutely LOVES musical theater and saw the 1999 Revival of Kiss Me, Kate of Broadway with Brian Stokes Mitchell and Marin Mazzie I was dissapointed with this production. While the music and the dancing are spectacular I have a few qualms about the actual filming and some of the cast memebers.
1. Hattie: should have been someone else. The woman who plays her in the DVD was not as spectacular as Adriane Lenox who played Hattie in the 1999 Broadway Revival. There are moments when she just ISN'T on key, and it's grating on the nerves.
2. Lois Lane/Bianca: She's so much fun in the DVD, but now as fun as Amy Spanger was. I did enjoy that Bill Calhoun was played by the same person (Michael Berresse).

1854062,5,B00008NFR6,"`Kiss Me Kate', Winner of 5 Tony Awards, 6 Drama Desk Awards and 4 Outer Critics Awards including Best Musical Revival, is a wonderful production with breathtaking performances from a stellar cast including Brent Barrett and Rachel York. What I want to clear up is the criticism of the DVD. I have to disagree with everything negative said - the sound is fine and a pleasant balance of orchestra and vocal with a crisp clarity.
 Secondly, the DVD is widescreen and captures a lot of the onstage `business'. Indeed the cameras do follow the main action, but never misses anything. It has been filmed by people who both appreciate the performance, the art and the intention of Michael Blakemore. Since he directed it and then adapted `Kiss Me Kate' for television, surely he of all people knows what needs to be filmed?
Always, the performance has an `on stage' feel and I urge you to ignore the exaggerated views of others here. Sound is good, video is good, DVD menu is good and I guarantee that you'll be as enthusiastic about the DVD as I was today after watching it.

1854066,5,B00008NFR6,"This PBS - Great Performances version of ""Kiss Me Kate"" is a magnificent version of a classic musical. It makes the MGM film seem a grade school skit. The leads, Brent Barrett and Rachael York are so good there are not proper words to describe their performances. They become the characters - not an easy job when they are giving performances to fill a large theater and at the same time have close ups from cameras. Barrett is the perfect ""Fred"" conceited and self absorbed, but not so much that you don't like him - he is rather endearing. York is the beautiful film star with all the insecurities - a dead on characterization. Their singing is wonderful, much better than the Broadway leads on the CD of the New York version. Both are Broadway vetrans who were chosen to do the London production. Check out Miss York on the ""Victor/Victoria"" DVD version of the live show with Julie Andrews repeating her film role on stage. York is a talent to be reckoned with (she recently played Lucille Ball in the TV film of her life). Barrett has made many recordings of Broadway shows including ""Grand Hotel"" (in which he also played the lead on Broadway) and ""Brigadoon"".
Everything about this production is wonderful PLUS it is the full show, not cut as is the film. A viewer gets the full ""Brush Up Your Shakespear"" one of the funniest songs ever written. For this reason alone, this is the best version to own. Also on the DVD is the great ""From This Moment On"" that is not even on the cast recording.

It's always interesting to see how the Broadway musical differs from the Hollywood musical.  So when ""Cole Porter's Kiss Me, Kate"" was revived on Broadway recently, the folks at The Performance Company filmed the performance starring Brent Barrett and Rachel York.
While I am a fan of the movie musical version, I did enjoy watching this performance.  Broadway musicals are always limited by the width and depth of the stage and I was always curious to see how the original musical was performed on a Broadway stage.
It was like having a front-row seat to the musical=within=the=musical about an egotistical actor who casts himself in the role of star and producer in a musical version of Shakespeare's ""Taming Of The Shrew"" who along the way hopes to win back the affection and love of his ex-wife who he just happened to cast in the musical.
