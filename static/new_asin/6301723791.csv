8270684,5,6301723791,"Ok, this was written for children --and in the 1950's no less-- but it possesses an ethereal and very believable aura of getting what is rightfully yours if you persevere and are true to your heart. Kudos to the writers and to Shirley temple for bringing out a story about a boy --many fairy tales often deal with princesses-- who despite his infirmity works hard at reaching his destiny. The acting is suitable for a TV episode but heart warming nonetheless. Watch this if you believe there is justice and that the only failing we can face is not to try.",1279670400,,555,4.5049504950495045
