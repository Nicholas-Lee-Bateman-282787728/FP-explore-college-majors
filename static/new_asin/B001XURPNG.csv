The father plans to make a novel about this novel person. To do this he dawns a ""Call Me Bwana""  African kaki outfit with pith helmet and takes a helicopter 10 miles to mysterious Shadow Mountain. There he disappears.

To the rescue are daughter Roxy, Tom and Tom's dune buggy.  Roxy gets a good look at the giants club ""Eagan"" and cannot get over thinking about it. The giant gets a good sniff of Roxy and cannot get over thinking about it.  Will true love takes its course between beings form different ages or will it end in tragedy?

""There were giants in the earth in those days; and also after that, when the sons of
God came unto the daughters of men, and they bare children to them, the same became mighty men which were of old, men of renown.""
Genesis 6:4 KJV

3828978,1,B001XURPNG,"I have to believe that Richard Kiel, who played ""Jaws"" in two James Bond movies, is embarrassed by his role in this movie that is about as cheesy as a movie in this genre, whatever genre that may be, can be.  On the other hand, this movie is a step up from Kiel's first role as a Solarite in ""The Phantom Planet,"" where his face was covered.  The plot of this movie has more holes than anything I know.  The acting is reasonably awful.  The lyrics to the songs are cheesy, or worse.

As the movie begins, we meet young and beautiful Roxy Miller (Marilyn Manning, who was apparently a secretary near Arch Hall, Sr.'s studio; her career spanned three movies).  Soon Roxy is driving down the road and runs smack into a giant caveman.  The caveman appears to be carrying a deer and a club (returning from shopping, perhaps).  The caveman, who we later learn is called Eegah (Kiel), is immediately smitten by Roxy.  Fortunately for Roxy, another car drives up.  It turns out that Roxy's boyfriend Tom Nelson (Arch Hall, Jr.) is driving the car.  Had Tom arrived any later, Roxy might have been making out with a caveman in the desert.

At some point Tom utters a classic line.  ""I swear on my Elvis Presley LP.""  Dialogue just hardly gets any better than this.  I also enjoy it when Tom is singing about some babe named Vicky when Roxy is his girlfriend.

Tom and Robert Miller (Arch Hall, Sr.), Roxy's father, go with Roxy to the location where she saw the giant.  Mr. Miller decides to go off into the desert of southern California to look for the giant after the trio finds a giant footprint.  When the helicopter is unable to retrieve Mr. Miller, Tom hops into his dune buggy and with Roxy goes to find Mr. Miller.  Tom is soon destroying desert habitat, including rare desert plants, just so he can prove to Roxy how macho he is.  The next thing you know, Roxy and Tom are getting ready to spend the night in the desert and Tom pulls out his guitar.  Backing vocals kick in, whistling starts, electric guitars join in, and suddenly Tom sounds like he is in a studio somewhere.  This time Tom sings about Valerie.  Roxy kind of gets her revenge for Tom's longing for other women later.

Tom's singing is really nothing to write home about, but it turns out that, like the Pied Piper, his singing attracts creatures.  My guess is that the creatures show up to stifle Tom.  In this case, the creature is Eegah.  Eegah is frightened away, but the next day Tom leaves Roxy at the dune buggy to search for her father and Eegah takes the opportunity to kidnap Roxy.  Eegah soon sets up house with Roxy, except Eegah decides he wants more than a shave and a meal.  Tom shows up in the nick of time to save Roxy's honor, but Roxy looks wistful as she sees Eegah on the hilltop as they leave the desert.  After all, if Tom can sing about other women, Roxy can have a caveman as a second boyfriend.

Later, Eegah decides he is unable to live without Roxy, so he goes to great lengths to track her down.  Unfortunately, few people are able to understand a caveman wandering about, so they had to take action.  Poor defenseless Eegah just did not know what he was up against.  I suspect that Roxy broke up with Tom soon after.  After all, there was no way that Tom could compete with Eegah.

The transfer for this movie is reasonable.  The picture was generally clear and the sound was okay.  I do have to wonder why I am concerned about the quality of the DVD.  This movie is awful.  The plot is silly.  How could a caveman exist in southern California with no one knowing?  How was Eegah able to find Roxy?  I know she had perfume, but Roxy rode in a vehicle a lot, leaving no trail.  I know the movie went to great lengths to explain that Eegah was friendly, but Eegah was a caveman, and a seven foot tall caveman should have been more forceful than he was.  Regardless of what the opening credits show, Eegah does not kill anyone, other than the audience, who die from boredom.

Unsurprisingly, this movie has made a number of ""worst movie"" lists.  The acting is awful.  The dialogue is uninspired.  The singing is not awful, but the lyrics of the songs are awful.  About the only thing that really made sense was Eegah attempting to undress Marilyn Manning.

Instead of watching this turkey, find the Mystery Science Theater 3000 version instead.  Trust me; you will be glad you did.

Good Luck!",1347494400,,4387,4.425531914893617

This movie is so unlike all the movies put out today.  It is truly unique!  This movie is a must have for anyone interested in film or just weird cavemen.",1248998400,,289,4.377358490566038
8347760,5,B001XURPNG,"This movie for what it is, a 1950 teen horror film that tries to promote a hopeful teen idle, had all the makings of a fantastic Bad Movie Night Cinema movie.  Richard Kiel (Jaws from The Spy Who Loved Me) plays a pre-historic teen giant who falls in love with a modern teen girl, you know that can't end well. Kiel actuallly gives a very touching preformance during a scene where he tells his mummifyed family how he loves his new teen girl and now she is gone. He doesn't speak in this roll other than a bunch of grunts and groans but during this very touching moment in the film he conveys his loneleness very well. The rest of the movie is what it is, Hollywood trying to make a buck off the latest teen horror craze of the time. Grab a few beers, sit back and enjoy the movie on a rainy or snowey afternoon.",1453852800,,812,4.171974522292993
8347761,2,B001XURPNG,"Intergalactic, super-omni-stars, Arch Hall Jr. and Marilyn Manning, prove beyond any hope of doubt, that their performances in THE SADIST were indeed a fluke. In EEGAH!, the duo play a pair of fun-loving ""teens"" named Tommy and Roxy, who encounter the lumbering, towering cave man (Richard Kiel- THE PHANTOM PLANET) of the title. Roxy is abducted by the troglodyte, and taken, along w/ her dad (Arch Hall Sr.!), back to his cave lair. Somehow, after much dullness, the non-action culminates at a pool party. No amount of brain-smashing intoxicants can render you numb enough to hear Arch Jr. warbling away at his abominable love songs! As awful as this movie is, it still pales in comparison to Hall Jr.'s other catastrophic film event, NASTY RABBIT! Learn the lessons! Heed the warnings!...",1445212800,,791,5.0458015267175576
