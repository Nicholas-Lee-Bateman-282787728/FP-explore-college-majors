8056269,5,B0008ISM0E,"We are now on the second copy, having worn the first one out, and he plays with his baseball, basketball and soccer balls all during the show.  The lady who narrates is super, and the background music (classical, quick) is perfect..  We got our first copy when grandson was two years old and is now almost three and still chooses it daily to watch.  I have gotten a copy for my little neighbor boys, also.  Good for ages one-year to six, I would say.  A great little birthday or holiday gift for small child..",1369958400,,509,4.372340425531915
8056270,5,B0008ISM0E,"I don't know if this is good for parents sanity, but my kid who's first word was ball and baby. this video is a huge hit! it's the first thing he says in the morning when he wakes up. ""Basketball? bye bye baby. baseball"" and then gets the clicker and points it to the tv saying ""basketball?""he is almost reciting it by now. If you have a child who loves balls,and babies, this video is golden to you. Gives you a good 40 minutes to get some dishes/laundry whatever done. It's been godsend!",1233446400,2,489,4.268817204301075
8056271,4,B0008ISM0E,My son loves this dvd and asks for it every day. He has really taken an interest in sports and learned some of the basic concepts.,1211414400,2,130,4.038461538461538
8056272,5,B0008ISM0E,"My kids have really enjoyed this video- it starts with clueless small kids rolling a ball around and progresses to middle school... all the way to the ""pros"" (college) playing with passion.  Since it begins at such a basic level I think that it takes the intimidation factor out of sports. All the action is set to stirring classical music. I'm not a huge sports fan so Babypro has served to introduce my little boy to sports. My only complaint is that I wish there were more sports covered!",1137974400,4,491,4.51685393258427
