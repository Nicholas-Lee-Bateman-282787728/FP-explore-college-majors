4281169,1,B00477VLYG,"I don't get it, why have the main anime be aired on Japanese FAMILY stations if they are to cancel it later? I can think of another alternate worlds' series that made a lot more sense than this... The way I see it, the tone went from ""lovey dovey"" to ""WWIII"" when this came, which is just a bad idea in terms of pacing. Stories need more consistent tones. I'm surprised it was not given an MA rating. CLAMP didn't care when MKR was changed in the second half or yelled about Angelic Layer, so why didn't they put the series on a more mature station? Some things just don't make sense. If you want a more ""consistent"" series watch other Shounen series.",1294790400,,651,4.300813008130081
4281170,5,B00477VLYG,"There is no doubt about it, the OVAs are much better than the anime series that had been filled with filler by Bee Train. Production I.G ,anime producer of Tsubasa The Movie and xxxHOLiC, returns to animate this award worthy series. Obviously, the OVAs were mostly made for Tsubasa manga followers (basically true Tsubasa fans) so don't watch the anime show together with this.

The voice work for both Japanese and English tracks was done very well and both are worthy of watching (don't forget the Commentaries).

Downside to this is that they skip a few arcs between Tokyo Revelations and Spring Thunder. The other downside is that Spring Thunder Chronicle should have been released together with xxxHOLiC: Spring Dream Chronicle as was done in Japan to see the other side of the story. (Watanuki makes a cameo in here!)

So yeah, this is a great collection for any Tsubasa/xxxHolic/CLAMP fan or for the average Anime fan. Hopefully Production I.G will continue to release more OVAs of the Tsubasa gang's continuing travels across dimensions in the future.

And don't forget about xxxHolic: Shunmuki and xxxHolic: Ro!",1294617600,,1120,5.005376344086022
4281171,5,B00477VLYG,"""Everything you know about Tsubasa changes now!"" and that is a true statement. If you have only watched the anime series and have not read the manga, the first OVA series, ""Tokyo Revelations"" kicks off where the Library arc should have left off. Acid Tokyo was the world they were suppose to land in when Fai had used magic to escape. This arc is one of the most amazing, but probably the worst world they could ever of landed in. Not just because of the country's misery, but the events that take place amongst our dimensional travelers. Also, if you're a fan of Princess Sakura, in one of the episodes you get to see her be kick-butt, which is awesome!

Now, the second OVA, ""Spring Thunder"" is separated from the other OVA by a two arc gap, Infinity and Celes. So, if you want it to make sense, pick up volumes 18-21 of the manga to fill in that gap, then you can watch this one. This is a pretty amazing one, too, though not as good as the Acid Tokyo arc, it is still very important, as there's some pretty strong emotions going on and another shocking revealing. And once you're done with this OVA, finish the Tsubasa story by reading volumes 24-28.

These two OVA series makes up for what the anime lacked when they had decided to stray from the manga after the Library arc. The voice cast on each audio track are simply amazing, watching it in Japanese and English are like two totally different experiences because of how each cast portrays their characters. So I recommend watching both audio tracks to get the whole experience. All in all, whether you read the manga only, watch the anime only, or both, you'll enjoy these! After a long wait, it's all on DVD!",1294358400,7,1669,4.450980392156863
4281172,5,B00477VLYG,"Tsubasa has been, at times, a somewhat lighthearted tale inspired by the original Cardcaptor Sakura.  But there is another Tsubasa, which we've already glimpsed in Kurogane's backstory, the hints that Fai is suicidal, and the intentions of Fei Wang Reed.  The first OVA in this set animates the relentlessly dark Acid Tokyo arc - which is not only the best arc of Tsubasa but probably the best arc of the whole Tsubasa/xxxHOLiC continuum and perhaps even the best thing CLAMP has ever written.

As the gang explore their next world - an alternate universe Tokyo ravaged by acid rain - Syaoran's personality continues to deteriorate after his disturbing behavior near the end of the series proper.  When one of his companions performs a selfless, loving act to try to help him, things go horrifically wrong, and the quest for Sakura's feathers goes out the window as a race to save a life begins.

The arc is still shocking and powerful even if you've read the manga and know perfectly well what's coming, and it's difficult to watch.  But there is beauty here too, because the main theme is the power of love, of different shapes and forms, between the main characters.  Character development is at it's pinnacle, with Fai at his most fiercely, heartbreakingly maternal (and after Tokyo there's absolutely no doubt maternal is the right word), Kurogane embarking on an emotional rollercoaster as he's forced into two separate no-win decisions, and Sakura truly coming into her own as she fights the limits of her endurance for a loved one.

As for the second OVA, it's almost impossible to discuss without spoiling Tokyo, as the primary issue of that arc is whether or not all of the characters are going to make it through.  What I will say is that it's an animated version of the Nihon arc, with the very end of the Celes arc as a prologue.  What this means is that the animated version has skipped the Infinity arc and most of the Celes arc, and there will be times that viewers who have not read the manga will be wondering what the heck is going on and what they've missed, as knowledge of the events of those arcs is taken for granted.  For all that, it is, however, just about as good a depiction of the Nihon arc as fans could have hoped for.

Not to be missed by Tsubasa fans.",1294185600,17,2285,4.614814814814815
4281173,5,B00477VLYG,"As a huge fan of the Tsubasa manga series, I was completely dissapointed in the anime. If you read Tsubasa, don't bother to watch the anime. It's boring, slow, the animation is terrible, all the violence is cut out along with everything else that made the manga amazing. Don't waste your money.
Instead, just buy the OVA collection. The animation is stunning (especially when compared to the anime series), and they leave in all the gory details. Just a warning, though: I personally cannot stand the English voice cast, so if you buy the OVAs, I recommend watching them in Japanese with the English subtitles.",1293494400,4,610,4.819047619047619
4281174,5,B00477VLYG,"No synopsis, I don't want to spoil anything!

I'd read about half of the Tsubasa manga when I started the anime. I was really enjoying the manga, seeing all the crossover characters and visiting so many new worlds. I really looked forward to seeing it come alive on the screen. Unfortunately, the anime was horribly boring and the whole second season was filler. But when I head that possibly my favorite part of the manga had it's own OVA, I knew I had to give it one more try. I am glad that I did!

This OVA covers the part of the storyline where things actually happen. Some questions are answered and even more are raised (Syaoran will surprise you!). It doesn't end well, since it leaves you with a bunch of unanswered questions, but if you read the manga this isn't a problem. If you aren't interested in reading 28+ volumes of manga, well... you probably should't torture yourself by watching this OVA. The Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations OVA was my favorite of the two and it alone is worth buying the set for. $22 bucks for 5 episodes might seem a little pricy, but if you think of it more as a movie it isn't all that bad.",1291334400,4,1127,4.3875598086124405
4281175,3,B00477VLYG,"Tokyo Revelations alone gives this product 3 stars.  This review will be broken into two, review for Tokyo and a review for Spring Thunder.

TSUBASA TOKYO REVELATIONS:

Let me start off by saying I am among a minority of critics that feels the Anime series is a work of misunderstood genius and I'm probably the only one who's tired of the Bee Train haterz because OCD CLAMP fans can't stand anything that's different from the Manga.  That's not to say I don't recognize the flaws in Bee Train's TV anime series, but nothing is with out it's flaws.  With Tokyo Revelations being picked up by Production I.G from BEE TRAIN I wasn't sure what to really expect.

That being said I've always been a long Tsubasa fan more so because I've enjoyed the story telling by CLAMP.  Tokyo Revelations I had mixed feelings going into, on the one hand I was delighted to see another anime adaption, on the other hand I wasn't particularly  looking forward to Production I.G's  new Gothic style.  But still I wanted to see if Tokyo was worth the hype and for the most part it is.

Tokyo was very strange, dark and an extreme departure from the campy and brighter anime series broadcasted by NHK sure enough to please the OCD CLAMP fans.

I want to talk about Nanase (or Aghea) Okawa's writing, which I found to be exceptional quality for her.  Mostly I've known Okawa's screenwriting skills for my guilty pleasure series Cardcaptor Sakura.  Okawa brought out the strong writing that really attracted me to Tsubasa and held me as I read the Manga.  I haven't read since the end of the Ashura Arc (having already seen the Dangerous Race I didn't really want to read it again) anyway Okawa probably brought out the strongest story telling so far of any Tsubasa anime adaption, which something the series writer, Hiroyuki Kawasaki, couldn't quite accomplish  but still managed in spirit.

The dramatic and somber story telling was done in a very stylistic way that I wasn't expecting really.  The writing was action packed and dramatic with out being dark and mopey like other pseudo-Goth animes like Boogiepop or Serial Experiments Lain.  This also includes giving the much left out Sakura more of a central role and a pretty kick-ass story arc later, whereas in all earlier volumes of the manga and anime she has been the classical damsel in distress.  The awakening of the Clones was beyond strange yes, and even a little confusing but again Okawa wrote that in a sense that it was almost like watching a thriller as opposed to a fantasy.

A highly unusual departure and downright scary it blew me away, it was intense and highly packed full emotion.  Overall you may be blown aback unless you just simply like this stuff to begin with.

The new art and character designs is to be expected with a new studio taking over the production, as such I'm not a fan of the psudo-Gothic style of anime, so naturally, I can't say I particularly liked Yoko Kikuchi's new designs.  I did not care for the new animation style, I do want to say that director Shunsuke Tada was at least able to keep it balanced.  He didn't allow it to become overly saturated with blacks and shadows and dull unexpressive character designs and animation as most directors in this style do.  He allowed enough darkness to show a different style and allowed the tone and mood to be set to get us in the new world and not hit us over the head with it.  Tada has an easy style that is again often missed by most in this kind of Genre so my hat is off to him for keeping a relatively easy story line, and decent animation style.  But he dropped the ball in the Music Department overall.

Music wise you'll notice 98% of the music is from the TV series slightly altered.  It's almost appalling that a production company of  I.G's status can't make a slightly more original, original soundtrack.  I'm certainly glad they have been keeping Yuki Kajiura on as Composer since she was previously brought in under Koichi Mashimo's direction.  Whether simply Kajiura was too busy to write new material I don't know but this is one of the reason I find Koichi Mashimo and his company Bee Train to be above the par with most.  All I can say is if you are looking forward to another potentially great score, you'll be rather disappointed as I probably heard 5 new musical pieces including the opening theme and closing theme.  It's almost silly people have complained about repetitive music in the TV series when it's equally obvious in this OAV Series.

However, the opening theme song Synchronicity once again shows off the immense talent Yui Makino has especially when she's working with Kajiura and Maaya Sakamoto delivers a pleasant and well crafted ending theme.  Both Kajiura and Sakamoto are talented writers, and both can do wonders if they are given the chance.

With the up and coming OAD's I really hope Tada get's his act together and starts having Kajiura write some newer compositions.  OAV or no OAV if you have a sequel make some new music, if BEE TRAIN could do it for their small 4 OAV series .hack//Liminality, surely a company like Production I.G can do it too.  (especially the way CLAMP fans have been making IG into a Mecca).

Overall Revelations is worthy of a checkout and a full watch.  How much, is up to you.

----------------------------------------

TSUBASA SPRING THUNDER

Tsubasa Spring thunder is CLAMP's latest installment of their ever ongoing Tsubasa/HOLIC project. Following the exceptional work that was ""Tokyo Revelations"" even I was beginning to think Production I.G was the better choice for handling future Tsubasa projects.

With the announcement of Spring Thunder it was no surprise the various CLAMP fanatics began jumping for joy and same with some of the fans such as me. Now after watching both episodes, I have to say, this was a real let down.

Tsubasa Spring Thunder is the bad example of what happens when the original creator of the source material comes to write in the adaption. Nanase Ohkawa (aka Ageha Ohkawa) the principal writer of CLAMP, whom I've found to have exceptional screen writing talent handled this script for this as well as ""Tokyo Revelations"", having taken over from the TV series writer Hiroyuki Kawasaki. Ohkawa crafted Tokyo so well, I would have handed her the Academy Award for Best Screen writing of the year. In the case of Spring Thunder I would easily hand her a Razzie award for the Worst Screen writing of the year.

Ohkawa proves that she and her fellow CLAMP mates are too married to their own story that all they can do is tell an animated version of their manga, basically wasting everyone else's time and production money. Spring Thunder proves to be nothing more than a carrot for the loyal fans who have kept reading through the years while basically saying ""piss off"" to those who have only followed the anime installments. Having only partially read the manga I was beyond confused. As Spring Thunder doesn't immediately pick up where Tokyo left off.

Production I.G's motto is, "" to make anime that stands on its own ground without being an extension of manga."" And to me I.G completely threw that motto out the window with this project. The film is cluttered with to many flashbacks to events we haven't seen, and likely never will, and it only leaves the viewer with a real sense of emptiness and endless plot holes that they won't be able to fill unless they claw their way through god knows how many books there are now. At the very least Ohkawa was still able to make a somewhat-coherent screen story that I could follow at the very least. However much of the storytelling is left to be desired.

Equally disappointing was Shunsuke Tada's direction. Tada used way to many cuts and hardly got creative, except with the action scenes. Too often than not we are cut into long and pointless exposition scenes that some of us really just don't care about. I found my self fast forwarding through this more than on the edge of my seat with anticipation of what the next scene holds. And of course Tada follow the old Animation creed of Animation first, Music second. Yuki Kajiura's score is forced into the background quite terribly. Rather than use music to heighten the scene and emotion, Tada makes it feel like it's just playing. As in I'm writing the screenplay my self and the music is just playing as white noise as I work. On the one plus side was he finally decided to use more variety of pieces from the Tsubasa OST archives than he did in Tokyo, where he only seemed to use two pieces ever and some slight ambient noises.

Yoko Kikuchi character designs while not dreadful aren't exactly appealing. That being said I do prefer Bee Train's designer Minako Shiba. The art style is a slab of strangely clashing color pallets dull pastel colors mixed in with dark blacks. Tomoyo is equally unappealing in her design as she looks like she's wearing football gear under her robes. There is no continuity to the visual style of this. It's bright and flowery yet strangely dark, almost filmed like a dark comedy.

The opening animation is just beyond obscure and doesn't set the mood appropriately for this short OAD series. While Maaya Sakamoto is probably one of the best singers from Japan I've ever heard, her themes never seem to ever to match appropriately to anything Tsubasa. Kajiura however has always mastered the theme songs as her ending has fitted a lot more. It's great to hear FictionJunction YUUKA perform yet again.

The overall animation quality is still very well done for this short production and I didn't notice any real problems with the animation. The fight scenes were well crafted and well animated which made for some great footage.

Spring Thunder isn't bad or terrible. It's simply average, boiler plate, run of the mill. It was CLAMP's little present to their die-hard fans. It makes me think they should give it back to series director Koichi Mashimo and just make another season, or at least maybe go to the movie director Itsuro Kawasaki. Any future projects will likely remain as this, a nice bone for their loyal fans only.

Individually I would give Spring Thunder 2.5 stars and Tokyo Revelations 4.5 stars.",1290556800,7,10176,4.702535211267605
4281176,4,B00477VLYG,"Boxset Contains: Tsubasa Tokyo Revelations OVA(3 episodes) and Tsubasa Shunraiki (2 Episodes)

Basically these are 2 manga storys adapted into OVAs.
Though I personally think only people who have followed the manga will get more out of this. If you're following the anime, bewarned this doesn't take place directly after season 2 ended. But a little while after. Tokyo Revelations jumps straight into the heart of the storyline(Tokyo Arc) and some of the revelations such as who this Syaoran is who has been travelling with Fai, Sakura, Kurogane and Mokona during the manga/anime.

Tsubasa Shunraiki. Basically this follows on from Tokyo Revelations. Basically the travellers are trapped in Celes Country after a certain event occurs. Forcing Kurogane to do something incredibly surprising to enable them to jump to Nihon(Japan) Country(Kuroganes home dimension). And things kinda happen from there.

You will basically long for wanting more Tsubasa after watching this.

If you're looking for a really decent night in with a quality anime series to watch. Look no further. This collection of OVAs is far better than Season 2 ever was.

I really like this OVA. It's a little different than the series. It's kind of short, which is a disappointment for me. It's been several years since they made this OVA, so i hope they plan on continuing the show. I really liked this series and it would be a shame if they decided to end it unfinished after 50 episodes. If you liked the 1st 2 seasons then you'll like this one. It's really good.",1350777600,2,644,4.358333333333333
4281188,1,B00477VLYG,"There have been times I think an ""open-ended make your own finale"" anime is better than the manga, and there are times in general where sometimes the adaptation does some things better than the original, this is one of them.
I know many will disagree with me, maybe even send hate mail, but I honestly liked the TV anime more than this or the manga. I read the manga and was not pleased with the change in tone or the sudden over-complexity, while this DVD set copies two arcs from the manga's second half, it leaves a gap between the first OVA's equivalent and the second. Most people prefer extremely complicated stories, but the way I see it, it had so many twists and paradoxes in logic that it made you feel bad if you didn't fully agree. This was too harsh for those that are having tough emotional times (in my view), but there are also stories that are too positive, the 180 does not make a balance. This is much more violent than the TV anime, so if you have had bad violent memories in real life and saw the TV Anime, do not watch this, I warn you. The characters of Syaoran and Sakura are mentally different now from earlier, but this makes some philosophical confusion at certain points.

All in all, I may not recommend it to everyone, but there are other series from CLAMP that may not hit that sore spot if this is too much.",1336694400,,1339,4.334661354581673

So the ""princess"" isn't the princess after all but a clone and the real princess has been dead all along! That really did it for me. I think you might save some money buy sticking with xxxHoltic as it's much better than this series. One good thing is the price for the whole set isn't bad.

4281194,5,B00477VLYG,"Presented in 1080p utilizing the AVC codec (at an average bitrate of 23Mbps), Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicle: OVA Collection offers a strong visual presentation, which benefits greatly from an animation upgrade over the prior television series. Although the anime studio responsible for the first two seasons of Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles (Bee Train) was a division of Production I.G., they eventually split off to form their own independent studio, leaving future work on the series to others artists at the renowned parent company. Given the popularity of the series in Japan, I'd suspect Clamp and Production I.G. had no reservations in dedicating a higher budget to these follow-up episodes, and the results definitely show. I always found the animation on the original series a bit plain and static in comparison with other series of the same period, but these OVA's fall much closer to the quality of a theatrical release. Movement during fight sequences is fluid and stylish, background details offer greater depth, and lighting effects are handled with a touch more flair. If you happen to own either the ""Collected Memories"" box set, or the ""Clamp Double Feature"", and viewed the theatrical Tsubasa Reservoir Chronicles film A Princess in the Birdcage Kingdom, you'll have an accurate representation of the animation quality found on this release.

Regarding the technical proficiency of this transfer, there's precious little to complain about. Detail is more than adequate for a high definition anime release; colors appear bold and striking (with the exception of the intentionally muted palette of outdoor sequences on Tokyo Revelations); and the depth of blacks is exceptional (allowing contrast a wide span between light and dark sections of the picture). I searched in vain for examples of stair-stepping, aliasing, banding, or edge-enhancement, but eventually settled on a final assessment that this is a stable, accurate presentation of striking source material.

They were stunning and so crisp. They were what anime should look like!
And the story is excellent.

I expected the blu-ray version to top the digital form I'd previously seen, so I bought it when I found it had finally been released.

Unfortunately, whoever did this version did a terrible job. It is blurry and looks to be a much older anime than it is.
I have been impressed with blu ray quality in all my other experiences and was disappointed in this.
I had looked forward to buying them after watching them on Youtube, but now I am a bit regretful that I did.

You also learn why in many of the pictures on-line Fay also wears an eyepatch....and believe me, you won't see that one coming!!  At least it caught me by complete surprise.

The animation was of course gorgeous & I'm still looking forward to future adventures no matter how convoluted they may get.",1297468800,,455,4.181818181818182
4281213,5,B00477VLYG,"This is in my opinion a great DVD; I have watched both OVAs three times as I think both story lines are great. It has a lot more action than Season 2 and also a lot more blood. Sakura and Syaoran look a lot older than in Season 2. Also Sakura is shown to take a more activate role when she's awake rather than being the helpless girl who lets the boys fight for her.

The only problem with Spring Thunder is it starts towards the end of their arrival in Celes; Fai's country but otherwise is a great story.

All in all these OVAs are way better than Season 2 and I personally hope they do an anime verison of the Clow Arc of Tsubasa.",1297209600,4,633,4.015873015873016
4281214,5,B00477VLYG,"I really thought that this was a very good OVA.  As someone who has finished reading the manga, I have to say they really got more of the ""elements"" of Tsubasa in this OVA then the ending of the Second Season. I won't go into detail but it is very intense and emotional for some of the characters and If you have a key eye for anything Clamp you will notice some Characters from X The TV series are in Tokyo Revelations and Spring Thunder living out alternate extistences. I also think that Funimation did a good dub on this.  I do suggest after watching this you go out and read the Manga (It goes into detail on what happend after Tokyo Revelations and more detail into Fai's past)

All and all a very good OVA!",1295481600,2,713,4.227941176470588
4281215,1,B00477VLYG,"I have not read the series so I was hoping OVA would piece everything together. Sadly, it doesn't. There's a big gap between Tokyo Revelations and Spring Thunder and now, the plot has gotten confusing. I even found the beginning confusing until I realized that the plot doesn't pick up at the end of season two. Guess I'll purchasing the books,",1295049600,,344,4.655737704918033
4281216,5,B00477VLYG,"Up to this point, the main focus has been searching for Sakura's feathers as well as making sure that they are properly returned to her. But now the story's direction is changing with darker paths and truths, increasingly testing the limits and endurances of the characters while also revealing the true reason for why they all have been brought together from the beginning.

In the world of Acid Tokyo, the setting for the first OVA and arguably the best arc of the entire series, each of the main characters are presented with difficult choices, which forever changes them and their relationships. The animation sequences, the excellent soundtrack, and the tight script are so impressive that each time you see the shocking, painful and emotional moments in Tokyo Revelations, it leaves you breathless. Yet each of them - Syaoran, Sakura, Fai and Kurogane- shine equally in their own way. Despite all of the devastating events and a near-death for one of them, the characters relentlessly sacrifice so much for one another, showing how close they have become.

The second OVA jumps for about two arcs, beginning with the end of Celes and heading right into Nihon. (Therefore, I highly recommend reading Volumes 18-21 to not be confused). Though not as powerful and gripping as Tokyo Revelations, Spring Thunder animates the Nihon arc faithfully and has its own memorable and poignant scenes. Without spoiling any specific details, the ending certainly would remind Tsubasa manga and anime followers of the beginning, a clever symbol of how far the characters have grown and came to love each other.

On a side note, for those that prefer to watch the English dubs, I can happily say that the English script is very faithful to the original one; something that was not always the case for the previous episodes.

I highly recommend this for Tsubasa fans.",1295049600,10,1855,4.974193548387097

Id say a show worth watching and Owning.

Overall Rating 3.5/5
A strong group of characters travel between many dimensions to gather the feathers of Sakuras memories. This OVA has two parts that have time gaps between each other and season 2 of the TV series.

Rumiko Takahashi kind of did this with InuYasha and Ranma . This OVA picks up later in the manga than season 2 ended and kind of links into the TV shows with a couple flashbacks. Its odd but I found it to work well enough to be a recommended buy and continuation.

Theme Songs 4/5
This series continues to have solid music, good opening and ending. Mostly fast paced, I didn't skip them.

Ending 3.5/5
NO spoilers, the ending is imperfect but better than the 2nd season of the TV series.",1500854400,,778,4.457746478873239
8417811,5,B00477VLYG,If you like the series at all you want this! The OVAs come back to the source material and stay very true to the manga storyline. My absolute favorite part is the commentary for spring thunder ep 1 with Vic and Michelle (they are totally hilarious!) I sincerely hope they eventually animate the final chapters where everything get turned upside down yet again!,1498262400,,360,4.73015873015873

8417818,4,B00477VLYG,"I love XXXholic and Tsubasa, and the animation was awesome and beautiful in these ""movies"". I say that in quotes, 'cause only the xxxholic movie was full movie length. Like many of xxxholic stories, delightfully creepy, too.
The Tsubasa ""movie"" ran what seemed like a regular episode length, to me and felt rushed. Otherwise, totally worth viewing.",1352332800,,348,5.12280701754386
