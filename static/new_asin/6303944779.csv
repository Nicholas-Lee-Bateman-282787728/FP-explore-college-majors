7856039,5,6303944779,I love it! For some reason I thought I was purchasing Part I also. II is excellent. All I have to do now is find Part I and I'm good to go!!!,1268524800,,141,3.4375
7856040,5,6303944779,"Without a doubt, the masterful conclusion of ""The Best of Both Worlds"" deserves a top rating.  Probably the best two part episodes in TNG.  Plot:  Capt. Picard has been captured and is now the unwilling mouthpiece known as Locutus for the Borg.  Riker has assumed command and has reluctantly made Shelby Number One.  With Picard's tactical knowledge, the Borg cube takes on 40 Federation starships and, without much trouble, destroys 39 of them at Wolf 359.  Now it's battle of time before the Borg cube heads to Earth (Sector 001) and conquers the United Federation of Planets!!  There's plenty of action and suspense, with plenty of scenes that you just don't see that often.  The way they defeat the Borg also actually makes sense (compared to other solutions in other episodes).  This is an excellent episode (along with part 1) which begs the question for some of the later films (such as Insurrection), ""What happened?""  The only complaint is that I expected to see some actual battle sequences between the Federaton Armada and our giant cube terror.  But, I guess (though I haven't seen it) that the pilot for DS9 has some of these in it.  Overall, another 7 out of 5 stars.",1157414400,,1181,4.763546798029557
7856041,2,6303944779,"While Best of Both Worlds part 1 was unquestionably one of the best episodes of TNG, I can't say the same for the 2nd part. The amount of suspense that was built nicely through the first part made the summer seem interminably long, waiting for the conclusion. What a disappointment! I believe the writer's essentially painted themselves in a corner and then couldn't come up with a follow up that would both resolve all the issues and maintain the same level of drama.
On another note regarding the same episode, this was just one of a large number of episodes that proved Riker had no business being in command of a ship. Seems like every time Will got to sit in the ""big chair"" he would screw it up! (Near the end of the episode, after making the very WRONG decision of not making Data his 1st officer, when all else fails, what does he want to do to the Borg? ""Gee, let's ram the big square ship with the Enterprise. It probably won't make much of a dent in the cube and they will go on to Borg-ify all the humans, but it will probably make a pretty cool fireball!"")",1037318400,,1069,4.323383084577115
7856042,5,6303944779,"Part 2 of this extrordinary episode is 2x more better than Part 1. A rescue mission to free Picard (Locutus) from the hive mind turns out to be a googleplex's amount of money worth of a battle. I especially like how the action and plot are, as that's what I always like, and the way they come out of this scary adventure. Enjoy watching this one!",1003363200,6,346,4.257575757575758
7856043,5,6303944779,"The follow up from part one does a very nice job.  Riker is fantastic in dealing with the ways to rescue Picard from the Borg ship.  Too bad you  couldn't see the actual ""battle"" at Wolf 359.  But you actually  can if you watch the beginning of Star Trek Deep Space Nine's 1st episode.  As with the 1st episode, this one's loaded with suspense.  You won't want  to miss a minute.",966556800,10,379,4.23943661971831
