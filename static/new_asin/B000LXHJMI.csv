8197187,5,B000LXHJMI,"First the release as a whole: Lovely five-disc set includes two one-season dramas from Robin Chapmn. The 8-episode ""Big Breadwinner Hog"" and ""Spindoe"" (6 eps). Both are from the late 60s, both in B&W.

Though rough in parts, the restoration work is superb throughout.
The set includes an episode of another early cop show, ""Villains"" from 1972 starring Bob Hoskins as a safe-cracker.
And it comes with a booklet containing information, episode summaries and critical notes about Hog, though not Spindoe.

I've yet to watch all of Spindoe.
I have seen Hog and it really is breathtaking.

Despite the awkward fight scenes, silly stunt work  and often stunted set pieces -- typical of Brit series well into the 1980s; they just never got action right until the 90s -- HOG is one of the most impressive, thrilling and terrifying crime dramas that's come out of either side of the Atlantic. (Like most UK shows of the period it also is shot for the most part in the studio, though each episode does include some refreshing, exterior location shooting.)

Peter Egan is a revelation as HOG a well-spoken, over-educated (he does cockney here and there, but pretty much speaks the Queen's English while the other crims on the show wear their blue collars on their tongues) anti-authoritarian amateur criminal who is so turned on by a run-in with one of the smaller London ""firms"" (organized crime rackets) he decides to outwit the lot of them and take over the whole syndicate.

He's smart and he's ruthless as we see in the infamous scene which ends the first episode -- he gets revenge on one of the firm's heavies by throwing acid in the dude's face.

The series follows Hog as he systematically makes his way up the latter. His goal: To get control of Scott-Yanks, the biggest, richest and most powerful organized crime firm in London.

Each character -- the three Scott-Yanks chairmen, their lieutenants and soldiers, the members of one of the smaller firms, the police -- is beautifully written and developed through the course of the series. Gangster movie cliches abound, of course, but they are deployed with intelligence and wit.

Donald Burton is quite brilliant as Ackerman, a former military man turned mercenary turned Scott-Yanks thug. After messing up an operation in Africa which makes him a wanted man, Ackerman is blackmailed by a Scott-Yanks boss to work for the firm doing some of its dirtier, more lethal work. A philosophical soul -- and a hopeless romantic and pessimist -- he's desperate to get out of the life and sets out to play Hog and his bosses against each other.",1400716800,,2586,4.832579185520362
