8414222,5,B00436GY2K,"I knew this was the kind of exercise that I needed with my degenerative disc and joint disease. It really is fluid and kind to my back and joints. I take it easy and don't rush what I do when moving along with this video. Since I started my pain meds are lasting longer and I sleep longer without pain waking me up. As time goes by, I can see where my back and legs will become stronger.

The product was shipped quickly and in perfect condition.",1358208000,22,446,4.126436781609195
