2667418,5,B000JBXHEQ,"Southwest Detroit isn't merely the gritty backdrop for this fast paced ghetto drama. The mean streets of Motown take on a life of their own as the story unfolds in this recently released independent feature film. Cinematographer Lon Stratton's brilliant camera work captures the true essence of the city's inhabitants as they struggle to survive amongst a shady underworld inhabited by gang bangers, pimps and drug dealers. There are plenty of fresh faces to keep things interesting as Director Brian Lawrence deftly navigates the busy script with considerable skill. And as if four story lines aren't enough to think about, the soundtrack absolutely rocks the house with mostly Detroit artists covering a gamut of grooves from hip hop to country latino. Check it out now.",1166832000,,772,5.184

8149381,3,B000JBXHEQ,"This film definitely falls under the indie title. There was an array of corruption about people who hang out in the wee hours in the big city. whose judgement is tested in the mean streets of Detroit. It was nice to see the scenes around Detroit, we never get to see Detroit in films. They like to make mention of Detroit on a pretense that it is filmed here, so this was good to see.",1243382400,,384,4.133333333333334
8149382,1,B000JBXHEQ,"Yikes!  From reading the other reviews, it sounds like this film was made by a young Orson Welles.  Although the cinematography is very good (the city of Detroit rarely looks this superbly gritty and dark), the ""story"" in this film is so poorly written, and, at times cliched.  I guess the director was going for a ""Crash""-like film with intertwining story lines of drama and redemption, but the stories fail miserably.  It seems he tried to do way too much on way too small a budget and way-way too thin of a story.

While the drug use, killings, racial politics, and prostitution are not glamorized, it is nevertheless used, exploitively at times (how many drug/crime films have shown drugs being prepared and then injected in extreme closeup).

The most laughable scene in the film is prior to the rape scene as the male predator chases the female prey around the convertable car.  When he is unable to catch up to her in her high heels (apparently he is no track star) he decides to crouch down so she can't see him and sneak up on her.  Of course, she realizes this and, instead of running away or into the building where her friend just ran for help, she peeks under the car to spot his location.  Meanwhile, as she is on all fours, he sneaks up and attacks.  This scene just looked silly.

Some of the acting showed promise.  A moment here or there in this film. And, after listening to the director's commentary, the director seems to have some things to say about race relations, drug use, and the city of Detroit (all worthy subjects).  Perhaps a more simple story that followed one of the story lines - and did that well - as opposed to the collection of stories that ultimately don't work.

My guess is the positive reviews for this film are from the actors, friends, or members of the film class that made this soon-to-be-forgotten thing.

I was really pulling for this movie because it is about my home town of Detroit.  Too bad - there are good films to make about Detroit, this is not one of them.",1180051200,4,2013,4.5041322314049586
8149383,5,B000JBXHEQ,"A major American city has rarely appeared as seedy and decrepit as in ""Corrupted Minds."" Known pre-release as ""Panic in Detroit,"" the movie follows the story of four groups who travel over the Ambassador Bridge from Canada into Detroit. The intertwined stories explore themes of pride, violence, power, passion, drug abuse, lust, misplaced trust, racial and sexual politics, and desperation to survive. In this dark world honesty and true friendship are rare, while deception and raw self-interest are commonplace, and everyone is at risk of betrayal or victimization.

Realistic, emotionally compelling performances by just about every actor and actress involved add enormously to the power of this absorbing drama. Many of the strongest scenes are between Tris (actress Aida Muoz), a strikingly exotic Hispanic beauty who works as a prostitute but dreams of a better life, and Nick (actor Elton Litzner), her former boyfriend and pimp who, despite his other women, cannot tolerate Tris escaping his domination. Meanwhile, Jack (actor Mark Brock), a sleazy pimp who likes to put on an air of respectability, seeks to woo Tris, while at the same time cheating and exploiting her.

Actor Dale Reynolds puts in a sensitive performance as Sonny Montgomery, a well-known former college sports hero tricked into assisting a criminal, politically motivated plot. On the run from police and the conspirators, including The Reverend (actor Scott Wyckoff) and his henchman Ahmad (actor Walter Harris), his fight to survive seems doomed, while Manuel (actor Derek Denham) the friend that he trusts, ponders his orders to kill Sonny to keep him from talking.

Other story lines center on a film crew from Canada making a documentary, encouraging the locals to say bad things about Detroit, and two white suburban young ladies (actresses Candace Posluszny as Staci and Deirdre Tracey as Margaret) who are unsure whom to trust when their car breaks down in a run-down area of Detroit near the bridge.

Because of nudity, sex scenes and adult themes, the film is inappropriate for children. Despite the degrading nature of some of the sexual relationships, unlike just about every other movie the nudity and sex themselves are never sensationalized or idealized, but instead are portrayed truly and honestly.

Although the film was shot on a limited budget, great attention is paid to the cinematography, which is beautiful, and the sound, which is always right. The musical soundtrack is interesting and appropriate, and normally unobtrusive. There are also some good special effects, though not extensive. The plot is about relationships and human motivations, not explosions. Yet, it is also about the City, a character whose presence is always felt.

By the end of the film there are many losers, but a few winners as well. The biggest winner is the audience.

Producer, director, and screenwriter Brian Lawrence (not related to reviewer) has labored for years to bring forth a well-crafted product that entertains as it asks disturbing questions about contemporary American life.

8149384,4,B000JBXHEQ,"This movie caught my attention from the start.  The stark images of a city long gripped by urban decay, draws parallels in many cities across the country today.  The multiple intertwined story lines keep you riveted to the screen, unable to look away for fear of missing what comes next.  The performances are gritty and undeniably powerful, a story wrought by the conflict between human nature, compassion and honor.  Is Corrupted Minds a film about the worst in us, the best in us, or both?  A commentary on the past, present or future?  Those are just some of the questions you take away from this Indie offering.  See it for yourself and decide.",1169856000,,649,4.6902654867256635
8149385,4,B000JBXHEQ,"I ended up viewing this film because I knew it was shot locally.
What a surprise! Great quality and story all around. I couldn't
wait to see what happend next. Brilliant images and excitement.
I cannot wait to see what this Brian Lawrence has up his sleeve next.",1168905600,,262,4.479166666666667
8149386,5,B000JBXHEQ,"This is the kind of film that reminds me of why I love movies.  After I finished viewing it, I was rattled.  Its ambivalent moral point of view gives the film surprising emotional power.  The filmmaker doesn't draw ethical conclusions for the viewer; you're invited to interpret the characters' actions for yourself.

The actors in the film (Aida Munoz, Derek Denham, Shoib Myint, Deirdre Tracey, Hugh Gall, Mike Merna, Elton Litzner -- to name a few) are courageous and attractive.  The sexuality and violence are handled honestly and straightfowardly by the director and cast.  Lon Stratton's cinematography enhances the urban landscapes with unexpected beauty.

When I rented the film, I expected to see a typical urban action story but was treated to an art film.  I highly recommend this film and suggest viewing it more than once.  There are four densely packed storylines and it's hard to absorb all the action in a single viewing.",1168905600,,938,5.0
8149387,4,B000JBXHEQ,"DO NOT let an unknown cast and crew from Detroit fool you!  This film is very competitive with nearly any Hollywood makes.  Starting with the excellent cinematography, this art film tells the story of Canadian filmmakers coming to Detroit to make a documentary depicting the motor city as typical third world.  Like with anything that gets a bad rap, the lead filmmaker exploits the city by hiding its good points so as to better market his movie.  Fully knowing its the bad points that sell.",1168732800,,492,4.752941176470588
8149388,5,B000JBXHEQ,"I lived in Detroit for a number of years and can tell you this...""Corrupted Minds"" captures the dark side of the city quite well.

Very little seams to change in Detroit.  Many of the same trials and tribulations these characters faced are being faced as we speak by its residents.  And, it probably won't be much different tomorrow.  Probably worse.  Yet, despite all the struggle, day to day challenges of just getting by, the lack of opportunities for the average Joe...the people of Detroit possess a most unusual, unwavering pride in their city and the hope that it will one day return (at least in  part) to the prosperous and promising city it once was.  ""Corrupted Minds"" does a good job of tapping into that feeling.

There are 4 interweaving plot lines here, which keeps the film moving at breakneck speed.  I won't get into all the details here, but suffice it to say - a lot happens to a lot of people as they try to survive a day and a night in gritty downtown Detroit.  If you have ever seen the film, ""The Warriors"", there is an element of that type of struggle here.

The film does a fine job of showing the racial struggles that continue to this day.  The misunderstandings and preconceptions.  In ""Corrupted Minds"", we see how whites, blacks and Hispanics not only receive discrimination, but in some cases serve it up as well.  No one is completely innocent.  No one is just a victim.

I heard that this film was mostly shot prior to 9-11, proving it to be quite prophetic in some aspects.  And, you can tell it was shot on location as you simply could not create these sets in Hollywood.  This is the real deal.

All in all, this is a very good indie film and worth watching.",1168732800,,1695,4.462540716612378
8149389,5,B000JBXHEQ,"Expose' Journalism gets the slap in the face that it so often deserves in this powerful new movie that details what journalists are really looking for when they ""cover a story"". This is best enacted through the character played by Hugh Gall, as he moves from sincere concern, to disgust, to eventually fear, as the film crew he is working for, doing the story about Detroit, ends up headed down the wrong alley.

Although this was the most compelling storyline in the movie, there are others that expose the truth about all of our major cities in America. From the sexually disturbed doctor living in the suburbs, to the twisted morals of  those who have no respect for life because they were taught that there is only one way to survive in a city like Detroit. One of the better angles is the two suburban girls who believe that because they are rich and white, they can go anywhere and do anything, with no reprisals. It embodies the true relationship between the suburbs and the downtown areas in any major city.

The acting is good, and the music is all from Detroit, so it has to be good. The best thing about this movie though, is that it is a no-holds- barred look at a real city with real people in it. This movie is a very fine independent film that requires your attention. So can you handle the truth about where you live?",1168473600,,1333,4.454918032786885
