3115718,4,B0013KSVFM,"This DVD series is an excellent support for Precalculus and Calculus. Is this the right choice for you, though? You must consider whether or not you want to learn Calculus or be entertained. The presenter is not very entertaining - not boring, but hey, he's trying to present Calculus. Many videos are just a little less expensive but for 30 minutes to one hour of instruction. These videos provide 10-14 hours of instruction. So $ for $ I found these extremely helpful compared to others.

If you do not have the option of video-recording your professor or having access to other on-line Calculus video lectures, this is a great supplement for the serious student who can ignore the speaker continually saying ""ok"" (a bit annoying - 30 times per hour) and who doesn't mind this being like a videotaped lecture.

The presentation of the topics is usually pretty clear. It's great being able to rewind sections. I even occasionally ran the DVD at 1.5 and 2X speed to get through review sections faster.

Hopefully in the next several years there will be enough of these presentations on line for free by various professors - but if you're taking calculus now then go for this one today.

1) Calculus 1 & 2 Help
2) Advanced Calculus 2 Help
3) Calculus 3 Vol. 1 Help
4) Calculus 3 Vol. 2 Help

Let me start by saying that these videos are FANTASTIC! I am a ""non-traditional"" engineering student in my 30's. I was in the military for 11 years and am now back in school. With this large a gap inbetween school classes, I was bound to forget some topics. First day of calculus 1 class I was lost. That night I scoured the internet for tutorials etc and found Jason's site. I am so THANKFUL that I did.

Jason, just has a way with his teaching. He never rushes through topics, only gives you information that is the most important, and I think most importantly shows you how to work problems step by tedious step. With his dvd's and some practice I was able to get an A in calc 1 & 2, and am on my way to one in calc 3.

This Calc 3 video is especially well done.  He absolutely does the BEST job I have seen at explaining vectors.  They are a breeze after watching this video.  The section on double integrals stands out to me as well.

If you are struggling, or just looking to raise that low A to a high A, believe me, these videos are the keys to your success.  How can you go wrong with a study aid that actually takes calculus and turns it into ""plain english""???  That is exactly what these videos accomplish!!",1209513600,14,1373,4.166666666666667

8251603,5,B0013KSVFM,"I am not usually someone who writes a review on something such as this, though I feel ""that strongly"" that I cant help myself.

Background: Some of the trigonometry concepts I have already had a knowledge of, though I only have a very LIMITED amount of experience with ANYTHING close to calculus.  I have a few ""Calculus Books"" that I had read (a few chapters here and there) before I saw these DVDs, though I am not sure I was really ""grasping"" any of it.

DVDs from MathTutorDVD.com, I have seen are

The Pre-calc/Trigonometry Tutor
Calculus 1 and 2 Tutor
Advanced Calculus 2  Tutor
Calculus 3 Tutor Volume 1
Calculus 3 Tutor Volume 2

Pros:

Learning something new, or clearing up something you may have ""learned"" but not quite understood

Theses DVDs (I am talking about most of the sections, on EACH, of the DVDs) are setup with Mr. Gibson starting out (when applicable) with a brief review of something from a prior section that ties into the current section your watching, and makes you think ""oh ... that is why I had to learn that first"".

Then he in many cases tells you ""why you should care"" (besides passing your math class, if your currently in one), and how in some cases it relates to the real world.  (When I type this I think of his sections of vectors and how it could related to an electrical/magnetic field, in science)

I am not in any formal classes, and am currently ""self teaching"" myself these topics.  BEFORE I forget to mention it.  These are SUPPOSE to help you study, and I do not believe they are suppose to be used as a ""complete course"" on a particular topic.  There are many (he even says it, for those negative-type reviewers, who have written about these DVDs) topics that may not be covered, about a certain subject. (Though given time and kind feedback from customers, MathTutorDVD.com and Mr. Gibson may release future DVDs that do cover ""those missing topics"", especially if enough people are asking about it (the ""missing topics"")

Everyone has a different ""speed"" and way of learning, though I find Mr. Gibson's pace is PERFECT.  He doesn't ""Dumb anything down"" in my opinion, and he doesn't rush through a topic to cover more material for the sake of covering more material. (A problem I believe my high school teachers had ... they rushed through topics when over half the class didn't understand)

I find myself recommending these all the time and I am NOT the type you would think of recommending ""learning"" DVDs.  Topics I have tried to study before that were not ""too difficult"", though I was not always clear on how or why ""something"" (pick a topic in calculus, just for an example) was done, I watch Mr. Gibson explain and I am JUST SHOCKED how easy it seems.  I not only ""sort of"" understand the topic, (** as far as the material he covers... say Calculus 2 for example .. there may be a number of topics in that class, he doesn't cover, as I have previously stated**) though I COMPLETELY UNDERSTAND what he is talking about.  I can not say how many times I have been left thinking ""What?... Why?.... Why don't the books make it that simple to understand?"".

Cons:
If can call this a con, or if you even consider this a con.  This would be the price of the DVDs, though to be completely honest, I have been considering purchasing some others, even as I am typing this review up.  They are not cheap, but they are worth it, if you ask me.

Just remember, there are (calculus just as an example) a TON of his DVD sets on all sorts of calculus subjects, and if you just look at one and think ""well, this is not everything covered in `calculus 1' in class"" ... well they are not suppose to be a complete replacement for a class (unless you perhaps get each and every single DVD set, and even put forth effort of your own to do your own examples, and study further to fully grasp the subjects.

I have seen a few reviewers say that they mainly just watched a single Set of Mr. Gibson's DVDs on a subject, and then expected to go in and ""Ace"" their course.

If these were not so expensive, I'd be (and over the course of time, I still may ..) ""collecting these"" as some of these subjects I had issues with or I thought were too difficult for me to even try studying them, BEFORE I watched these DVDs.  Learning is fun, especially when you can tell what the heck your instructor is talking about.

I recommend these 100%, though you can not just be an ""expert"" on the subjects, by watching these, alone and I have seen Mr. Gibson mention a few times that you really need to studying more and do more examples and put for the effort OUTSIDE of the DVDs to really ""get"" the subject that is covered.",1368489600,,4639,4.438679245283019
8251604,3,B0013KSVFM,I have this and other math CD's by Jason Gibson. They are OK but they only scratch the surface of math. That may be because Jason's Major is Physics and not Math. Problems he solves are not very complicated as math problems in this subject tend to be. Good for a introduction but I would not walk in to a Calculus test based on my knowledge of a Jason Calculus CD.,1367280000,,364,4.140845070422535
8251605,5,B0013KSVFM,"If you look at Jason's collection of DVDs you will see I have written reviews for many of them now.  I believe in these products and Jason's teaching style.  Using these as a study aid has helped me to be among the top 5 or 6 top students in my classes.  In some classes I have received the top grade, in others I have been lower, but these helped me to get an A in every class from intermediate algebra through differential equations.  I will start out by saying, personally Calc 3 is the hardest class I have taken so far working myself through the calculus sequence.  At is core, it is just applying the concepts from Calc I and II to functions of two or more variables.  There are however a lot of detailed concepts within that which makes the material somewhat tricky and can trip people up.

This DVD covers the material you will see in the first 1/3 to 1/2 of a semester of Calc 3.  Like in all Jason's DVDs it does not cover every detail of what you are going to see in class, but it will go through the fundamental concepts that you need to have down in order to do well.  If you do not get this stuff, you will be hopelessly lost when you get to the material that is not presented here.  The one thing this set is light on is multivariable functions.  He does go into the subject, but there is a lot more to it than what he goes into here, and the material can get tricky.  I have used enough of his material now to get an idea of how he puts these DVDs together.  The problems on here are the ones you are most likely to see on a final exam.  If you go through the material on this and his Calc 3 volume 2 DVD you will get (depending on your instructor of course) get about 80% of the kind of things you will be exposed to on a final.  It is not a substitute for going to class and doing homework. In the end your teacher is probably going to select problems from the book and what he or she assigns for homework to put on the tests and there is only one way to know what that is.  I still had to put in a lot of work to get an A in the class, and did not rely just on this DVD set, but this helped me to be as prepared as I could be for the class.

Also, there are a lot of crappy multivariable textbooks out there.  The one I used was horrible, so I really relied on this DVD and the material from my teacher's lectures to figure the material out.  My teacher loved focusing on proofs in lecture however so it was very helpful using this to get practical experience with As I have said, if watching a lecture on video is conducive to your learning style, these will be immensely helpful.  Jason starts with basic examples and goes through to more complex (but not the hardest) problems going through step by step.  In a few sections when the problems start taking 10 plus minutes per problem to solve he does skip some of the steps in simplifying the problems.  They usually amount to just basic algebra that everyone that is at this level should be able to do.  All the necessary steps to do the calculus part of the problems are explained in great detail.  I think this is well worth the investment, and will help break down what is a complex subject into something that you can understand, and given that this material shows up in classes such as calculus based physics and engineering courses, it will help you beyond just the multivariable calculus class.",1324598400,2,3373,4.169753086419753
8251606,5,B0013KSVFM,"These DVDs are really useful if you are having any blind spots in calculus.  The instructor does a GREAT job of explaining things in understandable, practical terms and is extremely thorough with solving examples.  He explains things on an application level that is a lot easier to understand and transfer to the abstract than the normal way this stuff is taught which is usually from the abstract down to the practical.  Five stars, this guy is probably a way better teacher than your professor and they are worth a lot more than the price.",1312416000,,541,4.73404255319149
