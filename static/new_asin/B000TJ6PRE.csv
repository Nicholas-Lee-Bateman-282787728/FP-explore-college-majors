8209649,2,B000TJ6PRE,i enjoyed watching it but when i opened the case up the clips that hold the second dvd was broke and the dvd was scratch pretty bad.,1465257600,,132,3.925925925925926
8209650,1,B000TJ6PRE,"This movie put me to sleep. Nothing informative like a ""Kia Green"" work out video. At least he says more than ""Light weight"" save yourself 35$ and just go buy some free weights yourself, most of this video is on YouTube anyways.",1441152000,,228,4.4523809523809526
8209651,5,B000TJ6PRE,Ronnie Coleman is one of my favorite body builders ever. Everyone of his DVDs are unbelieveable,1426550400,,95,5.0
8209652,5,B000TJ6PRE,"Great DVD. Very long, not edited like the others, but shows everything he did preparing for the 2006 Olympia. Great inspiration.",1384387200,,128,5.142857142857143
8209653,5,B000TJ6PRE,"This vid was a great source of motivation and entertainment. If you're buying this vid for training advice, you'll be let down. This is not that type of vid. Seeing Ronnie's day to day activities, training sessions, and most of all, his humility in everything that he did made this purchase worth it. FOR ME, this video was educating, jaw dropping, hilarious, and humbling.",1228608000,,373,4.84375
8209654,2,B000TJ6PRE,"This set is SIX HOURS.  Who edited this, man?  It's probably one hour total of Ronnie in the gym, one hour of him eating, and four hours of close-ups on his cars, his clothes, his shoes, etc.  This documentary should not have been longer than two or two and a half hours.  They show this man cook his burgers with excruciating detail, like five minutes.

Don't get me wrong, if you want to see him in his everyday life, you see everything, so this is for you.

Ronnie seems like a good guy though.  I'd like this dvd a lot more if they just did some EDITING!",1211241600,4,558,4.158878504672897
8209655,4,B000TJ6PRE,If you are looking for an instructional DVD this is not for you. If you are a weight lifter this is for you. This DVD is full of moments that will motivate you and show you what life is like as a bodybuilder. It spares nothing in showing you the good and bad in a bodybuilder's life. The audio and video is a little rough in the beginning but it progressively gets better. All in all it's a good DVD to buy...,1202688000,,409,4.0
8209656,4,B000TJ6PRE,"Ronnie Coleman ""Unbelievable"" dvd was by far a better video. ""Relentless"" is good but a lot of mundane stuff that made the video a bit boring and make you want to say ""big deal?"" I did enjoy his workouts, watching him practically do superhuman feats. But overall, I enjoyed it. The road just before Mr Olympia was just a blip in the video. Too bad they couldn't show part of the footage. Also, Ronnie has really done well for himself, he has  4 cars and an SUV (Escalade). One of his car is a 2 door/seater Bentley.",1193961600,3,515,4.309278350515464
