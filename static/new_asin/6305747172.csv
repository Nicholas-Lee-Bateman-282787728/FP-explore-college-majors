Dave Matthews Band and Other Guests Do a Remarkable job in this unbeliveable 18 song set list including Old Favorites like ""Crash into me"" and ""Too Much"". The show also includes awesome rare tunes like ""Granny"", ""Long Black Veil"", ""#40"", and violinist Boyd Tinsley's ""True Reflections."" The show also adds personal favorites of mine such as ""The Stone"", ""Warehouse"" and many others. The band not only does the tunes well, they have long jam sessions to add to the songs.

However, I can say that this is a real treat to watch!  As a Dave Matthews Band fan, I will say that this live DVD is a must-have for fans!  The production quality on the video side is (slightly) sub-par, but you have to remember that this concert was recorded before the age of HDTV...  but really, aren't you getting this DVD for the sound?  Which, I must say, is stellar!!!  The 5.1 surround is incredible, and very enjoyable for those of us that own surround sound entertainment systems.

1070596,5,6305747172,"Hello everyone here at amazon.  My name is Ruben Flores and I just wanted to tell everyone a little about the Dave Matthews Band album ""Listener Supported.""  This band and album has diversity, punctuation, movement, and just an all out kick ass feeling to it.

  From the beginnig of the cd or dvd the band likes to come out un announced as ""Stefan Lessard"" starts a smooth bass line relaxing to the ear.  ""Carter Beuford"" the percussionist for the group then starts to diversify the music by adding what is much like a latin juaira rhythm just totally awesome.  Eventually the rest of the musicians come and join in and add the finishing touches to this wonderful intro.  For those who appreciate music can really relate to this as mostly a jazz fill but it will grab even the must unaware music associated person in the world.

  Hey even if your not much of a jazz lover there is music for everybody in this album.  For instance the punctuation and all around feel for song number twelve cleverly called ""Two Step"" has a blue grass country feel to it.  ""These guys are Mad!"" I said to myself when I first heard this one.  They end this song with such stacato and punctuation it leaves you wanting for more! You ""country lovers"" should check it out.

  The whole album just practically moves you from one place to another.  There is never a dull moment in this cd and yeah the dvd is even better I think because you get to see them in action. Song number sixteen ""Long Black Veil"" has what I think an old church hym feeling to it. I can see myself singing this in a church choir.  The lyrics my not be suitable but the feeling is such that of the church hyms.  Then all the sudden they move you over to a time mahem and chaois with the remake of ""All Along The Watch Tower"" the ol ""Bob Dylin"" master piece.  ""KICK ASS!"" is the only words I can think of when I listend to this one.  DMB's version will have you standing up if you were sitting down at the begining of this one.  They hit everynote flawlessly.  The timing, the stacato, the riffs, not too mention the percussion. All right on man.

  Finally to my favorite song number 5 on the album titled ""#41.""  This song shows what I believe is the bands capability to work with eachother so well.  It seems as though someone has a remote controll and is working it to controll DMB through this song but I garantee it's just they way DMB can work together as a ""BAND"" to controll sound, volume, timing, and finess.  Wow what a beautiful song nuber five is.  Dave Matthews Band consist of Dave Matthews vocal/guitar, Carter Beuford percussion/back vocal, Leroi Moore woodwinds, Boyd Tinsley strings/vocals.  These guys originate out of Carter's garage in Virginia whre Dave used to work in a cafe where he would hear Carter and Leroi play sometimes. Dave got the eventually genus idea to ask both Carter and Leroi to listen to Dave's recordings and to try and put these songs together.  Eventurally they got Stefan ,bassist, to come on the seen while only 17 years of age.  In the song ""Tripping Billies"" ,not on Listener Supported but on another album, they decided that they needed a violin sound and called upon Boyd.  Took them a whole month but they eventually got him.  So in ending I say to everyone if this album in not in your collection or dvd case then you are not doig you self justice as far as music goes.  I strongly recomend a copy of this album for yourself.",1149379200,,3428,4.4272
1070597,3,6305747172,"This DVD concert is 140 minutes long.  It contains about 120 minutes of music (removing all the cheering).  It is also available as a 2 CD set.

The Dave Matthews Band was one of the best bands to come out of the nineties.  Their concerts were always fun.  I just don't think any of the live recordings have done the band justice.

This is the best live recording of Matthews that I have seen/heard.  Although it is not perfect in any aspect, it has the best sound quality, song selection and performances.

The problems with Matthews live recordings are the whole concert is included (including cheering for the encore), the sound quality is poor, the audience noise is mixed in way too loud and song selection does not change very much.

All of the classic live recordings are taken from the several concerts so the best performances are chosen (no concert is going to be the best throughout).  Certain songs that are just the same as the studio version (or worse) are left out.  And the audience noise is held to a minimum so you can actually hear the band.  I don't need to drunk teenagers scream to know when good music is being played.

The editing of the video is bad, but not as bad as some other DVD's. The scenes are always jumping around and there is constant zooming in and zooming out.  But, there are places where the scenes are held up to about 3 seconds.  And the correct musician is usually highlighted.  There are many recent videos that are a lot worse.  If you want to see how a video concert should be shot, check out The Talking Heads, Stop Making Sense.

For this concert, the band is a little bigger with back-up singers.  This adds a new dimension to many of the songs, which keeps this concert more interesting than shows like Red Rocks or Chicago.  It also adds a little more variety.  The biggest problem with Red Rocks and Chicago is that there is not much difference between them, and both shows contain songs that are on this DVD.

The sound quality on this DVD is better than other Matthews live albums, but it is not perfect.  It is really nice in some parts, especially when only musician is playing.  The 5.1 surround sound does add some more depth to sound.",1138060800,,2193,4.465994962216625
1070598,5,6305747172,"Although I am a die-hard Dave Mathews Band fan, I do have to say they have better concert videos.  I don't like to put any of their stuff down because they are just an all around great band. They definitely deserve more recognition than those bubble gum, over-rated, untalented musicians.  Dave Mathews Band is very  talented and even better seen live.  They truly jam and get the crowds involvement.  For anyone who has heard Dave Mathews Band on the radio, just forget it....radio seems to play the not-so-favorite tunes.

This video is a great video, but I definitely have my favorites.  If I were to buy someone a DMB concert video, this one would be further down on my list.  The top pick for me would be Live at Central Park, this video would definitely make anyone a Dave Mathews Band fan.",1134172800,4,796,4.556338028169014
1070639,3,6305747172,"Now, given that this was one of their earlier performances, they did a good job..  I mean no matter what they play, DMB is great.  I personally thought that this performance was too slow paced, I like  more action, like the central park concert..  that was freaking great.",1122854400,,272,4.604166666666667
1070640,3,6305747172,"It started like this.... three DVD's in hand, Folsom Field, Central Park, and Listener Supported.  I wanted all three but had only enough money for one.  So I ended up going with Listener Supported based on the reviews here.  I put it in eager to watch one of my all time favorite bands.  Disappointment from the downbeat on.  I don't care how great the songs are or how well edited the thing is, if the sound quality sucks than I have a hard time listening.  They put an insane limiter on Carter's drums depriving him and the audience of his fantastic abilities.  You don't have that ""Live"" sound, only mush and limiters.  For those of you who might want to argue with me listen to ""Granny"" and listen to Carter's drums.  Total cheep garbage.  God bless Boyd and Dave but they are way too loud.  The mix is total crap if you listen to it on anything other than your grandma's computer speakers.  If you like sound quality go for Central Park or Folsom Field, god knows I will.",1121990400,3,977,4.396648044692737
1070641,5,6305747172,"WOW! What an intro to these stunning musicians! I was in a hifi shop in NZ recently and the owner was describing this DVD and the band's members to me so succinctly that I loved them before I had even heard them. I was played the first 30 minutes of Listener Supported before I had to leave and I was absolutely hooked the moment the band walked on stage. Since buying this DVD last week (and two of their CD's), I have not been able to listen to anything else. I agree completely with the editorial on  the opening page of these reviews, right down to the slight disappointment that the sound was not as open and forward as it could have been. Regardless, for me this concert has everything I could want in a live show, fabulous musicianship from the whole band (are they having the best time or what!), the wonderful way the crowd surrounds the band - I know others don't find this quite so appealing - but for me it adds to the sense of great energy focused in one place and was there one member of the audience that DIDN'T go home with a huge grin on their face? Hard to imagine. Such joy and vibrancy from the band and audience alike I find to be a rare thing - or maybe I don't get out enough? As a photographer myself, I found the filming to be in itself a work of art, involving me with the band and the audience as one.  Stefan Lessard's bass playing is just a joy, he reminds me of a much more animated John Entwhistle, just as brilliant, yet playing as if he's actually enjoying what he is doing. Carter Beauford looks like he is relaxing with an easy work-out, making his sheer mastery appear effortless.

All in all, brilliant stuff, although I will investigate the concert in Central Park for a different perspective. I suppose I could knock half a star off for the lack of sound projection, but the sheer enjoyment factor far outways it, so five it is. Switching my player to surround mode seems to improve things anyway. And those Lovely Ladies!

For me, I find they add a great deal of value to the preceedings. The extended ending to The Long Black Veil I find just exquisite, as does Dave himself, looking at his face. There's nothing more I can say, except I am going back to immerse myself in it yet again.",1120089600,,2227,4.307875894988067
1070642,5,6305747172,"This DVD is incredible, the emotion can be felt, the electricity is in the air, but the one problem with a dvd a little older like this one made in 1999 is that ***it's NOT PS2 COMPATIBLE***  I bought it used with some scratches and I thought it was the scratches messing it up so I had it professionally resurfaced, but it's still doesn't read it.  The DVD works on my other DVD players just not my ps2... Just a thoughtful warning if your ps2 is your only source of dvd playing.",1093392000,,480,4.206521739130435
1070643,5,6305747172,"This is the best DVD of the band available today.  I own every DVD released so far, and this has the best sound and picture quality of any.  Instead of seeing a lot of raw footage from a rockin' concert, this is a tad more refined.  It's an extraordinary performance with superior filming, the camara capturing each band member so skillfully that you feel like you're right there, sixth row center.  Just awesome.",1085529600,2,413,4.616438356164384
1070644,5,6305747172,"If you were looking to buy your first taped concert of ANY band, this would be the one to try first. It's truly exceptional. For those unfamiliar with The Dave Matthews Band, the music included on this DVD is an ideal first introduction to the extraordinary talents of this group. For those already hooked on them, it is even more ideal, because it combines some of their best music along with the visual emotion that you can only rarely get to experience beyond attending their concerts. If you think that this is the sort of disk that you can put on ""in the background"" while you work, you will find yourself drawn and engrossed by the wonderful way that this video has captured the energy, vibrancy and extraordinary creative talents of the individuals in this group. At 2 hours and 20 minutes, it covers extended versions of many of their songs. See if you can watch the 15 minute version of ""Two Step"" without repeating it at least once to replay this teriffic and infectious rendition. As you can see, this DVD comes highly recommended by this fan of the group!",1072915200,,1067,4.591623036649215
1070645,5,6305747172,"I got the soundtrack for this concert for Christmas a few years ago, and I was so impressed with the music that I later bought the actual video.  Money well spent.
First of all, I think the reason I like this concert the best out of all the other live DMB releases is because of the musical era it is from.  ""Before These Crowded Streets"" is by far my favorite of the DMB records, and for the most part the versions of songs from the album they play are great.  My one complaint would be ""Rapunzel"": they slowed it down like hell, and it sounds fairly awkward.  Most everything else is quite awesome, and among my favorite tracks are ""Pantala Naga Pampa,"" ""Two Step,"" ""Don't Drink the Water,"" and their famous concert-ending version of Dyland's ""All Along the Watchtower.""
In terms of the DVD and filming, the quality of the concert is very good, and the cinematography is also satisfactory.  Also, there are alternate camera views of certain songs available to choose from the menus.
The absolute best part about this concert is ""Two Step.""  Every part of the 14-minute performance was just freaking amazing.  The song starts off with Boyd strumming his violin along with Dave's guitar while Stephan Lessard plays some slide bass.  Then, Dave opens with some alternate lyrics to the introduction, and then the group crashes into the main part of the song heard on their album ""Crash.""  After the main song body is over, Butch Tayler plays a stunning 2-minute piano solo, which I thought was the most amazing part of the performance.  Then, Dave starts playing some cool guitar lick while the rest of the band silences down for about a minute, and then the entire group begins a 2-minute crescendo that culminates in an jaw-dropping drum solo by Carter Beauford.  Again, the band quiets down for about a minute, and then music suddenly triples in volume and they play the outro that is heard in the original recording.  Best performance of a song EVER.",1069891200,,1952,4.69208211143695
1070646,4,6305747172,"Dave live is simply the best. It's how they got famous in the first place, they are one of the hardest working live tour bands out there and this dvd is just great.

DMB did a great job on the stage, but sound quality on this DVD is AWFUL. DD5.1 have no clarity and details. It lacks of power. The vocals also doesn't sounds clean. The man who mixed DD on this product, have to learn a lot. He spoiled this otherwise great concert. He must see Eric Claptons-One More Car One More Rider DVD. The picture quality is good.

The talent these musicians carry is great and on this DVD their talent is up close and personal.  This DVD helps you appreciate how talented Dave Matthews Band is.  Great songs on here from Crash to Warehouse to All Along the Watchtower, all are simply awesome.  Dave also sings a great version of Long Black Veil, which was played at my first DMB concert.

I was lucky enough to see him play at the Islington Chapel in 2001 just after the 9/11 nightmare. The rest of the band didn't brave the flight, so it was just DM and his acoustic - absolutely breathtaking.

When this DVD FINALLY arrived, I called up one of my best friends to come and watch it and as I went straight for my favorite song, #41, I was completely overwhelmed to the point of chills. Seeing the chemistry between the members and the ease of which they play off of each other's mastery added numerous layers to an already richly deep experience already present on an incredible CD set. Sitting in the middle of my room totally immersed in the 5.1 surround setting played through premium Klipsch speakers, it was NEARLY akin to being there.

Only one complaint is the multiple angles. This is kind of a bait and switch. The multiple angles are only available on a couple of songs, and the angles change still... I would have loved one stationary camera pointing directly at Daves guitar the whole time. ha.

This CD also captures the band live on tape. That is the next best thing to seeing them live in person. If you've always wanted to see DMB live but didn't have fifty dollars to cough up for each ticket, this is a good product to buy.

1070770,5,6305747172,"The show starts out, the same as all other shows I've seen, with a ""tip of the iceberg"" opening jam that features all the usual members.  The best thing about this show(and all other DMB shows)is there's not an act on stage. No fire. No motorcycles. Nothing but musicians and their instruments. You don't see a front man with a macho attitude in a leather jacket.  Everything about this show and band is centered around the making of music. The members' musical emotions can easily be seen through their varous postures, dances, and stage orientation. The video and sound quality is unsurpassed by any DVD concert I've seen.
  As a DMB fan, my only real complaint are the back up singers and keyboardest. They are not part of the original five. Although they are very talented musicians, I feel they would be better suited on a subway platform.  Dave Matthews, Carter Beauford, Stefan Lessard, Boyd Tinsley and Leroi Moore do not need any help. They are that good!  Boyd Tinsley plays the violin with accuracy and precision. Just to see him play any one of his many solos throughout the show will keep anyone watching. The rest of the band members are just as excitng and phenominal. Each of these musicians are good enough to lead their own(very successful)band, yet somehow they ended up in the same band. If you have never heard The Dave Matthews Band, do yourself a favor and listen to them.

I have several DMB albums and this version is awesome!  Carter Beuford's drum work is unbelievable!  The musicianship throughout the concert is excellent.  It's also evident that Dave and his band truly enjoyed playing their music for the enthusiastic crowd.  The only complaint I have is that the DVD is not available in DTS (Hell Freezes Over is still the best audio available in a DVD).  This is nit picking as  the music and performances far outweigh the lack of DTS.

It shows some great footage of Dave (guitarist and lead vocals) and Boyd Tinsley(Violinist) playing side by side as they're known to do at live shows. I borrowed it just recently from a friend and wow!  Thanks to this video, and the awesome options of being able to view different angles on certain songs, I've managed to learn how to play a few of the songs.  The DMB crew really know how to put together great videos, concerts, cd's ect.  This DVD includes some of the best songs by DMB.  After being at 3 of their live shows (6-23-00 , 6-29-00 , 12-4-00) and seeing this DVD, I must say it's almost as good as going to the show...

1070902,4,6305747172,"For students of film, this is a remarkable example of how to build a concert video.  I'm not sure I've ever seen concert footage which does a  better job of reproducing the feeling of actually being there.  It's  accomplished by several clear means.
First, there's the very smart  choice of venue.  Matthews and company are performing here in the center of  their audience.  This theatre-in-the-round allows the camera free range  from any direction.  This is no static, three-camera set up, but a visual  dance around the stadium.  There are cameras all over the joint, and they  are determined to be a part of the music as much as the band members  themselves. Also, because there are people all around the performers,  viewers get the sense that they actually are in the middle of an audience.  Put this thing on Dolby Digital 5.1 and you will truly understand the  meaning of ""surround sound"".
Second, there's the very nifty use of the  DVD multiple-angle feature which allows you better access to whichever band  member strikes your fancy most.  This is an innovative use of the feature,  which until now has largely seen use only in the porn industry.  This  freedom of choice over camera angle is yet another way in which you can  approximate the live experience with the DVD, in that if you were there in  real life you could crane your neck and see a band member from different  angles.  But it does real life one better in that some of the angles really  wouldn't be available to you from a single location in the audience.
Finally, though, I think what comes across is how much fun the band is  having.  They are performing with obvious passion this particular evening.  The level of appreciation the audience has for this musical emotion is  equally infectious.  The band is playing for the love of their audience,  not the love of the potential revenues from the sale of the video.  Long  instrumental sections, indulgent riffs, teasing warm-ups to popular  songs-these are all things that might have been sacrificed on the editing  room floor with another group.  But for this band they are obviously  integral elements, and help tell the story of how the group engenders so  much fierce loyalty amongst their fans.
If you're not a Dave Matthews  fan, start here.  Don't go with a music-only recording.  This does a better  job than any other thing the band has done of showcasing their talents.  If  you walk away from this unimpressed, nothing the band has will tickle your  fancy.  If you are a fan, get this immediately.  It will only confirm what  you've always known: South Africa's loss is America's clear gain.
[DVD NOTES: There are a few niggling problems which should be mentioned.  One odd thing is that there aren't liner notes on the case, so you can't  find particular tracks without going to the scene selection menu.  A minor  complaint, to be sure, but it's exceptionally odd that the DVD packaging  gives you no clue as to the tracks performed.  It's also unfortunate that  such a stunning musical performance wasn't captured in DTS as well as Dolby  5.1.  Also, a band interview, making-of-the-concert video, or maybe a  history of the band documentary would've added considerable value to the  whole package.]",967161600,41,3243,4.795992714025501
1070903,5,6305747172,"Dave Matthews Fan Forever,  Dave Matthew's Music Puts A Smile On My Face...Listener Supported...Yes... Dave Matthew's Band Albums and Music, just keep getting better and better...The blending and instrumentation  between musicians in the band, and Dave's infectious, ever melodic voice,  carries you into serenity. The song entitled, 'Two Step', appears to me to  be the stand out on the album. I also like Rapunzel, Stone, Too Much,  Granny, Stay(Wasting Time), Pantala Naga Pampa, and all others on the  album. But...True Reflections just didn't have that 'true' Dave sound and  feel to the song. Harmonizing with others does not always a song make. As  always I love '41', 'Crash Into Me', 'Jimi Thing' and 'All Along The  Watchtower' is outstanding. The use of an extremely wide variety of  instruments from all around the world, give the band an always, 'new, fresh  sounding presentation'. Whether it be a 'live' or 'studio' recorded song.  There always seems to be an exciting 'first time' they have played a song  feel each time a song is performed. I think that this just comes down to  Dave Matthew's 'Laid Back', whatever happens, happens outlook. He is good  at what he does, feels comfortable with his music, is an excellent  musician, along with other band members. And Best of All for Us, they don't  take the entire performance 'Too Seriously', they have fun and it shows. We  all benefit from the excellent music and the humor that just enhances the  show.

My only gripe is the same as a couple of others', the camera,  while not hyper, is a bit too active.

Just  go back and listen to Live at Red Rocks, then listen to how devoid of  energy Listenr Supported sounds. With all the great concerts from the '99  tour, it is a shame that the DVD and live CD were wasted on this show.  And  the background singers in this thing really got on my nerves.

And the production renders this very well, with clear,  colorful, full-screen images and a wonderful 5.1-channel Dolby Digital mix  (not merely 4-channel ""Dolby Surround"" as it says on the  box!).
The surround sound isn't so much ambient or you-are-there (a la  Sarah McLachlan's impressive *Mirrorball* DVD), but rather intimate while  still enveloping, seamless, and entirely involving.  DMB has a better grasp  of musical dynamics than just about any other rock band today, and it's  nice to hear their soundtrack prepared with the same regard for nuance and  power.
I'd prefer a lot less movement from the cameras--there's an  abundance of sweeping shots and broad, panning zooms--but at least we're  spared the MTV/50-cuts-a-minute editing that mars so many concert videos.  A riveting performance, start to finish--play it loud and proud!
There's  no insert in the DVD (!) so copy down Amazon's track listing at the top of  the page, starting your numbering with ""2"" (an ""opening  jam"" is track 1 on the DVD).

The sound quality is amazing and all the different angles to look at.... wonderful!  Alomost  like being at the concert !  Keep up the good work DMB !

1071011,4,6305747172,"The latest live effort by these fabulous five performers, is immpressive to say the least.  I hels out buying the cd when it was first release.  Although the DVD was not released (while the VHS edition was) i waited  hoping it would soon be.  My waiting paid off,and here is the visually  stunning, absolutly rockin' show! MY only complaint come from the fact that  the disk is not masterd in dolby Digital,  these feature is sorly missed  and is the reason it does not get a fifth star.  The johnny cash song  ""long black veil"" also once performed by the Cheiftans, and Boyd  singing ""true reflections"" shows some exellent choices in shaking  up the increasingly stale concert selection by the DMB.  I feel they need  to hurry up with some new material cause we've heard it all and love it,  here's more to overplay.  Here's a shout out to my baby sis Lizzy....Peace,  5000, Yeah.",954028800,,881,4.580645161290323
1071012,5,6305747172,"I love the DVD, being from Virginia, I have seen Dave many times live.  I figured that the only way to see DMB was live, I was wrong, this really puts you there, live shows still have their obvious advantages, but until  the summer tour begins I will watch this time and time again.  You cannot  go wrong buying this DVD, if you have a multi-channel setup get this and be  amazed at the clarity of Dave's voice to Carter's sticks and Leroi's sax.  You owe it to yourself to get this is you are a true fan of the band.",953078400,,517,4.069306930693069
1071013,5,6305747172,"I was very very excited to hear that the Listener Suppoerted concert was coming out on DVD. When I got my copy I was blown away by the quality of the recording, and by the uses of camera angles. I have watched my DVD many  times and every time is a new experiance. I can change the angles to watch  every member of the band. It is like a new concert every time I watch it..",952905600,,373,3.8947368421052633
1071014,5,6305747172,This is awesome.  The video is so clear you feel as though you are on the stage.  It has a fantastic feature that lets you change camera angles to view different musicians on the stage.  If you have dolby digital decoding  you are in for a real treat.  The sound is better than the video and the  video had me in awe.  It is a must buy.,952473600,3,336,3.925373134328358

The Digital Video Disc production evolves beyond ""just"" great sights and sounds. For example, you can  choose the viewing angles of band members.

Admittedly, Stay,  Don't Drink the Water, Jimi Thing, Too Much, Crash...yada,yada,yada, kick  whatever your choice of media playback.

1071017,5,6305747172,Let me start off by saying that Dave Matthewsand his band are innovators in every sense of the word. This DVD which I've experienced from the recording of it to watching it in my home had to of been one of the  greatest concerts I'e been to in my life. I encourage every DMB fan to pick  this up whether on DVD or VHS!  J.P.,950659200,,324,3.953846153846154
1071018,5,6305747172,"My review may be just a bit biased but I can't rave enough about this outstanding DVD. I've seen Dave in concert more than a few times and this dvd didn't let me down. For those of you who have not had the pleasure to  experience the DMB live, this DVD will make you feel like you have. The  quality is outstanding and the camera angles are incredible. The song  selection is a wide variety of some great Dave songs and the sound quality  is flawless. This is a must have for any DMB fan and for those who have yet  to experience a Dave show, I HIGHLY recommend checking this DVD out!",950572800,6,584,4.132743362831858
1071019,5,6305747172,"I was hooked on the Dave Matthews Band about 5 years ago, and since then I've grown to be a HUGE fan.  I believe their music is best presented in a live environment, that's why I feel that DMB in concert is one of the best  shows on earth.  The true power of the video comes in being able to watch  all of the bands incredible musicians play.  The CDs are great, but seeing  these incredible musicians live is even better.  I also enjoyed the set  they played.  ""The Long Black Veil"" and ""The Stone"" are  awesome, and take the listener to another side of DMB.  Being able to see  the interaction among the band members is also something you don't get with  the CD.  The video delivers both a fantastic audio and visual package, and  all listeners should be very supportive of DMB's effort.",950400000,19,789,4.344827586206897
1071020,5,6305747172,"Dave Mathews Band continues to produce not only excellent music but also excellent entertainment.  I have been to their concerts before and I can tell you that nothing is lost on this dvd.

Anyone who likes anything Dave Mathews Band does, will surely enjoy  this dvd.",950313600,,380,4.875

1071071,4,6305747172,"Dave Matthews Band is one of the most musically diverse and talented 'rock' bands in existance. I saw them live from the third row in May of 1998 in Salt Lake City, and I thought I would never feel that sort of excitement again. I was wrong. Listener Supported DVD put me right on the stage with the band. The best feature of the disc is the availability to change camera angles between band members at will. The film is good quality, and I thought I would get the performance in widescreen, but it isn't. The DVD does however feature Dolby Surround 5.1, which is a different twist if you're used to how the stereo audio CDs sound. All in all, this a great DVD for home theater/rock music lovers.",950140800,2,696,4.361538461538461

1071074,4,6305747172,I bought and watched Listener Supported and found the whole thing to be fantastic. I enjoyed watching Carter play the drums and seeing Boyd play his violin. The shots were nice and long at times and short and abrupt when  necessary. The setlist was also just perfect! They played every song that  pops into your head when you think of DMB. The only thing that could have  been added were shots of the entire stage. That way you could see the light  show. But even without that the video still rocks!  Two words for people  who are hmmm'ing and ha'ing...BUY IT!,947116800,4,560,4.4950495049504955
1071075,5,6305747172,"If you were looking to buy your first taped concert of ANY band, this would be the one to try first.  It's truly exceptional.  For those unfamiliar with The Dave Matthews Band, the music is an ideal first  introduction to the extraordinary talents of this group.  For those already  hooked on them, it is even more ideal, because it combines some of their  best music along with the visual emotion that you can only rarely get to  experience beyond attending their concerts.  If you think that this is the  sort of tape that you can put on 'in the background' while you work, you  will find yourself drawn and engrossed by the wonderful way that this  taping has captured the energy, vibrancy and extraordinary creative talents  of the individuals in this group.  At 2 hours and 20 minutes, it covers  extended versions of many of their songs.  See if you can watch the 15  minute version of 'Two Step' without rewinding it at least once to replay  this teriffic and infectious rendition.  As you can see, this tape comes  highly recommended by this fan of the group!",947030400,,1067,4.609625668449198

The only thing about the video that i  didn't like was that they didn't show dave dance enough, and they didn't  show the spectacular light show that was going on enough.",946166400,2,352,4.1940298507462686
