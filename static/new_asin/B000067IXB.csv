7963384,5,B000067IXB,"A truly amazing movie.  The plot is awful, the acting is ridiculous, but the women in this movie are well worth the price.  Laurie Wallace is good.  Darian Caine is ok (and only appears briefly in the ""future"").  But, the evil witch played by Paige Richardson is amazing.  Jet black hair, black latex gloves and thigh-high boots that she never takes off, porcelain skin....oh, lord.  Seeing her along with the Uber-sexy Misty Mundae and lithe, tan and beautiful Ruby LaRocca is worth the price of the dvd.  Seeing all three of them along with Debbie Rochon and Laurie Wallace in a 5-girl orgie is *ahem* icing on the cake.  If you are looking for a parody or a sequel to the Blair Witch, don't buy this movie.  If you are looking for the sexiest scene since Emmanuel featuring Misty Mundae soul-kissing Ruby LaRocca, buy this dvd in a heartbeat.  The dvd extras are ok, but I keep going back to that scene with the five girls alone in the forest.....",1094342400,14,950,4.535294117647059
7963385,1,B000067IXB,"Unlike the first two Erotic Witch Project movies, Witchbabe is far from enjoyable.  Going back in time to see how Helena Pottsworth was ostracized by the community and branded the Erotic Witch struck me as a bad idea, and this movie proved to me that my doubts were justified.  We begin in the present day as two frolicking youngsters bump up against a human skeleton in the woods.  Authorities discover alongside the skeleton a journal (remarkably well preserved to have been lying in the woods for so many decades) apparently having belonged to the Erotic Witch herself.  At this point we are taken back to the past to see how Helena Pottsworth saves the mayor's wife (from that cursed gorilla the writers insist on including in every EWP movie) and then begins instructing the women of the community in the ways of nature-this largely consists of the women shedding their clothes and conducting hands-on (as well as lips-on) research into the ways of the female body.
I have to say that the acting in this movie is horrible, especially that of the Erotic Witch herself.  Then you have the prude of a mayor with his horribly, patently fake squeaky voice; his over-the-top performance takes this movie well beyond the limits of cinematic self-deprecating humor into the realms of the pitifully absurd.  You would think things might improve when the characters begin concentrating on the whole erotic aspect of the story, but the movie is sadly lacking in this department, as well.  Drowned under bad music, the erotic scenes are just uninspired and boring.  Don't count on the reliable Darian Caine to overcome the blatantly obvious deficiencies of this movie, either, as her screen time is severely limited in this one.  The Erotic Witch Project was a fun, enjoyable spoof of The Blair Witch Project, EWP 2 was a perfectly acceptable sequel, but Witchbabe: EWP 3 really has nothing to offer fans of the series.",1043884800,6,1912,4.8765432098765435
