2012758,4,B0001LXQMW,"My three grown daughters (and at least two sons) consider this to be their all-time Christmas favorite.  They'd sit transfixed to the end, then play it over and over.  They still know the lines! I love the low-keyed plotline and old-world charm.  The Norman Luboff Choir does their classic arrangement of ""The Night Before Christmas"" to a delightful animation of Santa's visit.  I agree--this one should be re-released on DVD.",1132531200,5,426,5.042857142857143
2012759,3,B0001LXQMW,"You know. This kind of Christmas special may not have a chance with today's fast-paced kind of effects and witty banter.

My family thought it was ""all right,"" but I enjoyed the old-fashionedness of it. The orchestrations and vocal talent of Olan Soele (sp?). You could tell it was animated in the sixties or early seventies.

The plot basically deals with a dramatization of Clement Moore's poem, along with his sick daughter, Charity, who needs to hear a fairy tale to gain the strength to fight a serious illness. Professor Moore can't find one, and subsequently writes the famous poem.

Nice charm. Easily paced. I liked it.

Should be out on DVD.

8014168,5,B0001LXQMW,"This is a great find, When my kids were little we watched it on and old projector with no sound, That was one of our traditions on Christmas eve, Mom would read it for the kids. The projector broke so we sent it to get a copy on a CD. It came back ruined with cheezy music. Even youtube had it but no sound. This one is great. Thank you Prime you restored a tradition for my grand children.",1482192000,,390,3.949367088607595

8014173,5,B0001LXQMW,"I think I rated this video 3 X now.  But once again nice story of a boy trying to help orphans like him.  However, the only thing I don't like is that he takes toys out of the factory, but just because he is not paid shouldn't give him the privilege to do so. We want to teach our 2 1/2 year old values so we will be high lighting that.  Our toddler does love to watch the movie over and over again.  He likes the toys coming alive and helping the boy.  Santa comes and finds him a home so that he is not an orphan anymore.  My child throughout Christmas kept saying ""Watch -the night before Christmas"".  Recommend",1391212800,,614,4.066666666666666
8014174,4,B0001LXQMW,I grew up with this story back in the 1940's. So when I came across it in one of my 'Searches' in 'Amazon' for Christmas movies -- I bought it. I'm certainly NOT sorry that I did either. It's a nicely accomplished animated production with good singing from the Norman Luboff Choir that was popular in the 1950's & 1960's. For Me -- this IS a 'Keep' video for enjoyment.,1382227200,,369,4.285714285714286
8014175,5,B0001LXQMW,"This charming video has been a favorite of my three daughters as they've grown.  Now that the oldest is setting out on her own, I was looking to find this classic on DVD to add to her collection. The entire family enjoy how the story is told and came to be.  It has olde-world charm that you do not grow tired of.  If this comes out on DVD, put my family down for four copies.  Deb",1134864000,3,381,3.973684210526316
