8623960,5,B00GJVUTJ6,"I wax amazed at the level of dancing at the National Ballet of Cuba. This is our first look into the school. It is no wonder these dancers are in such demand. It was great to see Jose Manuel Carreno again.
Even though it was a kids movie, I recommend it for adults as well.",1420243200,,273,3.981818181818182

8623962,5,B00GJVUTJ6,"Three of the most charming ballet dancers of all time. I hope I live long enough to see them dance on stage. It must be the first time ever that 3 triplet brothers are dancing together. I enjoyed that Herman Cornejo visited the boys at home. It is sad, though, to see the rundown landscape in Cuba. May prosperity return real soon. Viva Cuba!",1409702400,,342,4.359375

8623964,2,B00GJVUTJ6,"Wish I could give this 2 stars.  I bought this on the strength of two 5-star ratings (of 3) but was disappointed.  I'm not a passionate fan of dance but do enjoy a good show and a good story.  Some of the content is interesting but a lot is not.  The triplets themselves are appealing and likable.  When I watched this one evening, about half way through I started to fall asleep.  A good story would have kept me awake.  Maybe it was because the doc lacked a unifying narrative.  A narrator speaking English might have tied the different scenes together seamlessly.  Having to read the English subtitles (which I normally don't mind) may have taken more out of me than I thought.",1399075200,,680,4.463414634146342
8623965,5,B00GJVUTJ6,"This DVD is another in the great series of dance related films released over the years by First Run Features.  (Ive really enjoyed reviewing these on Amazon). The most recent review I wrote was for TuTuMuch about young female ballerinas competing for spots in the Royal Winnipeg Ballet School in Canada. Now comes this newest documentary, which follows three 11 year old identical triplets as they compete to be  accepted in the ballet program at the National Ballet School of Cuba  and to perform on the big stage in Peter and the Wolf.

The film was shot on video and released in 2013. Running just 58 minutes, it is a a charming film, focusing on the three brothers  - who always seem to be smiling  and their parents, as they get up at 6am to stretch and practice and go to school  where they study French while surrounded by revolutionary posters with images of Fidel Castro .  (The director uses this scene to make her only political comment.) There are other stories to be told here (a set of identical twins  17 year olds  who are competing to join the National Ballet and a few others in the same competition.

The dialogue is in Spanish but the English subtitles are large and crisp white and really easy to read.  Not only so you see the brothers dancing in class but the director captures them  playing the three little mice  in the Peter and The Wolf production.

There are no bonus features on the DVD  even a text bio of the director might have been nice -  but the film, itself, is enough to recommend this to anyone interested in dance.

I hope you found this film both informative and helpful.
