8252662,5,B0013QIZBG,"Rick French leads an amazing life.  Summers and Winters working on the slope in Construction or in the Oil Field and he spends the hunting Season getting sheep, bears, and goats for hunters from all over the world.

The video quality of this film is fantastic, especially since 99% of it was only filmed with one camera.

Rick is a very humble and intelligent oufitter, and I hope to bump into him in Alaska some day.

Great video.",1315353600,,431,4.487179487179487
