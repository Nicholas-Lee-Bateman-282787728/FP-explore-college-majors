8443019,5,B004V8ML6S,"One of my favorites. Mystical. Great love story. Banaras is another name for Varanasi India, where a hell of a lot of Hindi spirits live ... but also where ""mercy killings"" take their toll in sadness. This movie, through it all, like Romeo & Juliette, this is a powerful love story.",1472860800,,282,4.549019607843137
8443020,4,B004V8ML6S,"Excellent movie. Immensely thought provoking and ""hat ke type"" story. Music, direction and photography are superb and acting of lead star cast is stunning. Specially Urmila did wonderful job, she got the suitable role and did it well. Ashmit impressed me. Dimple, Raj Babbar and Nasseruddin had done hundreds of such role so played their part with ease and positive impact. Super natural subject line is always hard to present but direction and script really are praise worthy. Music is very touchy and blended nicely with scenes and situations. Movie is very lucid, though slow, unlike todays funky movies. Story is gripping and dialogues related to spirituality are admirable.",1304380800,3,678,5.229357798165138
