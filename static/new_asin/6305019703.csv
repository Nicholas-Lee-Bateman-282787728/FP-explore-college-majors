953002,3,6305019703,"I was expecting to see a full live concert from RATM and I was disappointed to see short excerpts from at least four concerts, plus several ""uncensored music video"" (whatever that means, they are all readily accessible online). A lot of the tracks seem to be the opening track of a performance, an odd choice for a band that was so energized by their interactions with the crowd. Look e.g. for their incredible 1992 Berkeley performance online to see what I mean.
 Sadly sound/video quality (even for the music videos!) goes from poor to barely acceptable, often below what you can get from youtube RATM videos.",1406851200,2,611,4.764150943396227

My favorite part is the elderly woman introducing the band!  I am thinking about writing Zack DeLaRocha on the ballot for the 2012 presidency.

953008,4,6305019703,"This Rage Against the Machine DVD features a selection of live performances from different dates and venues, as well as some uncensored music video clips. These music videos feature lots more live footage (as RATM videos tend to do) and there is also a poetry reading from Zack which is read over film footage. The special features on the DVD include lyrics, a reading list based on the books inside the `Evil Empire' album cover, an audio track of `The Ghost of Tom Joad' and a contact list of various organisations the band wishes to highlight. The live half of the disc offers up some explosive performances and whilst sometimes this isn't quite as tight as the `Olympic Auditorium' live disc, it has just as much passion and force. The music video for `Freedom' is especially good as they use it to bring to our attention the case of Leonard Peltier who is incarcerated under very dubious judicial conditions. All in all this is a good disc of live performances and videos and whilst I prefer the previously mentioned 'Olympic Auditorium' disc (as it feels more coherent and tight), this still has some great tracks to delight RATM fans.

953009,5,6305019703,"This is the first ever RATM music video released, first on VHS in 1997, then on DVD in 1999. The VHS version had a bonus audio CD with it, containing ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"" and some live tracks. Well, this DVD doesn't contain this cool little CD, but at has some extras instead.

This video captures the best moments of the first half of RATM's history, around and before&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Evil-Empire/dp/B0000029D9/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Evil Empire</a>&nbsp;(my personal all-time favourite since its release in 1996). Knowing that RATM is one the greatest live performers, all fans must see this DVD containing explosive concert performances of the greatest songs of all time.

One can also find the video clips for the first two albums on the DVD, although the secret ""Bombtrack"" video (of which most people believed was just a hoax) is included only on their latest DVD to date,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Rage-Against-The-Machine-Live-at-the-Grand-Olympic-Auditorium/dp/B0000WVV7O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Rage Against The Machine - Live at the Grand Olympic Auditorium</a>.

The DVD extras are not that great, as you can access the reading list and list of organizations elsewhere. The lyrics feature is cool (should be on all music DVDs), although RATM fans got to know all of them, right? An audio version of ""The Ghost of Tom Joad"" is also included as a replacement for the bonus CD, but it's also available on&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Renegades/dp/B000053EZW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Renegades</a>&nbsp;(note however that this version is a little bit cleaner - and in my opinion, better - as the one on Renegades).

If you could own only one of the three RATM DVDs, this should be your choice.",1211414400,,1867,6.08745247148289
953010,5,6305019703,i seen RATM live many times and this DVD really captures the band's energy. i love the extra stuff on the DVD because it allows you to see RATM mind frame.,1191628800,,155,4.032258064516129
953011,4,6305019703,"This is an awesome collection of load and full on performances from one of the most intense bands around.

Sound quality isn't the best sounds like it was recorded from a mic rather than off the desk but other than that a really good dvd. Sounds best through a massive stereo/surround system with subs!",1163030400,,302,4.592592592592593
953063,5,6305019703,"If you like Rage, and even if you dont, this is a must see. They are at top form here, and i have watched this over and over again. The only slight problem i have is the visual effects, but its not bad. But overall it is an amazing live film and from the opening song ""bulls on parade"" to the closing song of ""freedom"" the entire thing is great.",1103673600,4,345,3.942857142857143
953064,5,6305019703,"I said ""..one of"" in my headline but the truth of the matter is that this one might actually top them all. RATM's live performances were legendary by any standard one sets and this DVD does capture to a very satisfying degree their unique talent and spirit.

  Filmed on a world wide tour, this is RATM at their very peak musically and as a band. Their chemistry is absolutely stunning, their music is at its most fueled drive and the band performs it with a vengeance unparallel and almost impossible to top.

  For those unlucky enough not to have witnessed one of rock's greatest bands live this DVD will more than compensate for that loss (if that could be said at all). Having said that, I'm not a big fan of live music DVDs but this one is a very special case and those who do go for the DVD format in music will easily attest to that.

  It's a nice collector's item as well as it offers the ""Ghost of Tom Joad"" maxi with it, a song which happens to be a gem when performed live by RATM.

  Coming to the performances themselves, aside of their incredible quality there's been a very good job made in capturing some funny or visually impressive moments from their concerts and this definately counts to the extras. De La Rocha's antics on the stage are to cherish and watching him show why some consider him the best rock frontman ever is addicting.

  Legendary stuff.",1101254400,,1376,4.426294820717131
953065,5,6305019703,"i bought this a while ago and I got the bonus ghost of tom joad cd with it. does anyone no if i'll still get it now, cuz someone stole mine!",1086739200,,140,3.5483870967741935
953066,4,6305019703,i broke this DVD in with my 2 month-old child. need i say more?,1074643200,,63,3.5714285714285716
953067,4,6305019703,"If you never had a chance to see Rage Against the Machine live, you really missed out. There was a time when Zach de la Rocha was the most frightening performer in the land. I caught them twice in '93, just as they were hitting - the shows were incendiary. Zach was wrath in the flesh, a live wire, ready to strike at any moment with unbridled fury. The pit was as wild as any I've ever experienced (I almost had a tooth knocked out!)
I saw them once again in 1999 during ""The Battle of Los Angeles"" tour. The band was much tighter, and Zach got down, but I felt like they had lost much of their menacing edge. Still, they were absolutely captivating.
This DVD captures Rage somewhere in between these two states. Most of the performances are from 1996/1997, their ""Evil Empire"" tour, with the exception of a couple from 1994 (pre-""Evil Empire""). Zach comes off as monstrous in '94, and more human in 1996/1997. Throughout, his intensity is at peak, especially on ""Freedom"" and ""Tire Me"" where he just goes absolutely nuts. It will give you shivers. Tom Morello is an extraordinary guitar player and is fascinating to watch as well.
The live stuff is the reason to get this, but they've also included six music videos as a bonus. The early videos, like ""Killing in the Name"", are so poorly dubbed and low budget that they're almost painful to watch. The later videos border on jaw dropping they're so good (my favorite is ""Bulls on Parade"".)
Unfortunately the special features are a little bland. One, for example, is a reading list. Another is a list of non-profit organizations that the band supports. Noble, sure, but both are already available on the Rage web site, where they are more legible. The best special feature is the ability to view the lyrics during the songs - all music DVDs should have this feature! The biggest thing lacking from this DVD is behind-the-scenes footage. I'm sure it's out there - why not include it?
If you were lucky enough to see Rage live, this DVD will bring back memories and have you pining for a reunion. If you missed them, brother/sister, I can't help you. In fact, you probably should avoid this - your envy for those of us who saw them could easily grow to unbearable proportions. Anyways, if you're a big fan, this DVD is a must-own. Don't hesitate to purchase it.",1053302400,48,2310,4.555288461538462
953068,5,6305019703,"It's a shame that I never had a chance to see the original Rage live, but this DVD gives me a little taste of what it was probably like.  It starts out with the most recent performance on the DVD ""The Ghost Of Tom Joad,"" and it is beautiful!  Zack is really feeling it while singing that song.  These guys had to be one of the most intense live act ever.  The DVD itself is more intense than some live shows I have seen.  Then it moves back and shows full performances at less recent venues.  The last titled live song has a little guest at the begining, which is pretty cool, then there is an untitled live track that you're gonna love!  After that it goes to the uncensored videos.  They are great as well.  There are no bleeps at cuss words or anything like that, they are fully uncensored.  There is also a poem Zack reads which is pretty interesting, it kind of shows a reinactment as well while he is reading it.  The program is great.  The special features are pretty cool, they include ""The Ghost Of Tom Joad"" audio single, which was what the original video of this DVD came with.  It also has a gallery of the book titles of the books used in the artwork of the ""Evil Empire"" album which may lead you to want to read these books.  If you are a rock performer of any kind, this video will hype you up for a show.  It does it for me all the time.  If you are a fan of Rage Against the Machine, you must own this!",1032912000,,1419,4.086956521739131
953069,4,6305019703,"This is a very good video, but not the best.
I thought a lot of the time the audio recordings were pretty [bad], but still OK.
One thing that [upset] me was that they used different clips from different concerts for one song. Example: Watch the footage of the first two songs. Sometimes Brad is wearing no shirt, sometimes he is wearing a black shirt.
There is a good selection of songs from the first two albums, although I would have prefered to have more songs from Evil Empire, like Down Rodeo and Wind Below.
Another dissapointing thing is that instead of making way for more concert footage they put all their video clips on there.
You can see all the video clips on TV if you need to.
All in all, this is a very good video, but after you have watched it a couple of times it becomes boring.
If you are a big fan, then buy it.",1024185600,2,832,4.20625
953070,4,6305019703,"In case you didn't already know, this isn't just one full concert. It's several live performances, and several music videos. There are also clips of the lead singer narrating over what looks like clips of confrontations and injustices throughout history. Now, of course this just may seem a little random and head-ache inducing. Don't get me wrong, at times it is. But it's all very well compensated for during the absolutely amazing live shows.
Considering this package was originally released in 1997, don't expect any new hits to be on this (""Testify"", ""Renegades of Funk"") rather your old favorites (""Bulls on Parade"", ""Killing in the Name"" preceded by a hilarious introduction). The performances are all supercharged. Every member of the band puts every last bit of their energy into every song. It's like it's the last time they're ever performing as a group. Wait till you hear ""Bulls on Parade"". The way they do it is phenomenal. Even if you're not a huge Rage fan, you'll still be knocked on your butt by these amazing performances. These are some of the best live performances available on DVD.
The second half of the DVD is music videos for most of the songs that are featured in the live portion. Each music video is unique in its own way, even though they are a little disturbing at times. If you've ever seen one of their videos before, you know that they have strong political messages to them. It may seem that they're just a bunch of anarchists who want to brainwash you (much like Tyler Durden from ""Fight Club""). But if you've never seen one before, you're in for a treat. And we'll leave it with what I've already said.
Now for the technical aspects of the disc. First off: the video transfer. Since almost each performance is shot separately, some spots are better than others. Some look like they were shot on a 1983 home video camera, and others look they were shot on a modern DV (not DVD) camera. Throughout the entire thing, there seems to be murkiness in certain aspects, with too much shadowing. The colors are a little drab and don't necessarily jump off off your screen. But the video quality adds to the factor of anarchism.
The audio is much better than I thought it would be. It's not as LOUD as it should be, but it's still very nice. It has Dolby Digital 5.1 and Dolby Surround 2.0 and both sound great regardless. Fans screaming behind you, guitars coming out of the left, drums from the right, vocals from the front, and the subwoofer packs so much bass, your pets will run for cover (well, at least mine jumped off the couch). Again, some spots are better than others. The music videos have the better sound to them, but the whole package is nicely played.
This isn't the music DVD you'd want to buy to show off your home theater (try ""U2: Live from Boston), and it's not one to show off your brand new progressive scan DVD player and projection HDTV (try ""The Matrix"" or ""Fight Club""), but it's definitely fun to watch, and worth a go for anyone who enjoys modern hard rock.",1015286400,17,3013,4.591836734693878
953071,5,6305019703,"Now this DVD of rage is tight.  You get to see everything live, and the early videos of rage.  none of the battle of la or renegades songs are on there, but the previous songs are so good that you won't even notice, and also you see exactly why they are called RAGE against the machine.  Zack's unbridled energy on stage along with Tom's guitarwork is just beautiful to watch.  You just have to see it.",1015027200,,402,4.25
953072,5,6305019703,"I always liked Rage alot ,but was only familiar with a few popular songs. I bought this one on a whim cause I love ""Live"" performances if they are good! Well,this is not just good but great! I can't get enough Ratm! FANTASTIC MUSICIANS! I am not a rap fan, but, whatever you want to call what Zach does is mesmerizing and I am a true fan of RATM. Its a must see for any musician or fan. No overdubbing or cheesey sound effects here! And what a message! No sappy love songs here!",997142400,,478,4.095744680851064
953133,5,6305019703,"If you like live music you will love this. I have over twenty bands on dvd,and this is one of the best. Even if you don't like the band now,buy this and you will.",976579200,,162,3.7941176470588234
953134,4,6305019703,"I just got this DVD today, and after viewing it, all I can say is WOW!  Rage is a great band to see live in concert.  IMHO, the ""Live in Concert"" portion is far better than the ""Video Clips""  portion.  On their live performances, Zack and company tear up the stage,  moving and grooving to their own music, while their audiences (in the US  and Europe) do the very same!  It was amazing for me to see probably at  least several thousand people jumping up and down at the same time.  That's  how powerful Rage's music is.  I think the best part was when Tom Morello's  mother introduced the band prior to ""Killing In The Name"".  Now  that's quite a trip!
With my comments about the live performances already  said, the ""uncensored"" video clips are decent to say the least.  There is pretty much nothing out of the ordinary with the clips (aside from  the usual four-letter word).  So apart from the casual profanity, there's  no sex, gore, or violence to speak of.  Of the six videos presented,  ""Freedom"" is the best one.
Because of the DVD, I'm already  looking forward to the RATM/Beastie Boys concert here in Detroit, August  19th!",963619200,3,1134,4.532338308457711
953135,2,6305019703,"This could have been so much better.  The sound on the live tracks is not that good.  I am a huge ratm fan so I had to own it good or bad, it is worth the money but seriously this could have been so much better.  It  includes no tracks from battle of LA, It is a must for rage fans but could  have been so much better by waiting for some more material to put on there.  I would have liked to see some other songs live but its like a settle for  what you paid for thing.  But worth the money",961632000,,490,3.6893203883495147

If your an old school RATM fan and have liked them since the beginning like me, the you'll love this on DVD or video. It  gives a great sense (if turned up REAL LOUD) of what it's like to see Rage  live. With a mix of older & newer footage of the band at it's hardcore  best. The festival shots give a good appreciation of the popularity of  this, still somewhat underground group. The footage in some sets may seem  shot poorly but this is done on purpose to enhance viewing pleasure, with  the sound still  brilliant. This DVD format gives options to skip tracks,  have lyrics (for those who don't know them) and other standard DVD  features. And if this wasn't enough, all the Rage video clips from R.A.T.M.  & Evil Empire are included. So all fans, new or not, young & old,  buy this DVD and you WILL NOT BE DISSAPOINTED! .

953137,5,6305019703,"I have this in regular VHS, so I'm sure the DVD version is even better. The intensity of the music is unbeliveable and the political nature of the songs should (must) be appreciated by those of us that can see what is  really happenning here in our country.

953138,3,6305019703,"I am a huge R.A.T.M. fan.  I love pretty much anything they do but I still believe this DVD was put together pretty poorly.  The live recordings don't capture the power and the adrenaline rush you get from actually seeing the  band live, and the sound on the live tracks is not very good.  Also, Rage  has a large arsenal of amazing songs yet this DVD repeats some songs twice  instead of giving you a wider range of songs.  One good thing is that  you can view the lyrics to the songs as zack sings. If your a BIG rage fan  you'll like it because its Rage, But in conclusion the DVD does not  acurrately represent the band and the emotion level they play with live.",947462400,4,666,4.214285714285714
