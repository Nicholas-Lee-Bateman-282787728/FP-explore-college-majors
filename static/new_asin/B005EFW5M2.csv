4665240,1,B005EFW5M2,Here is the reason why! The reason is that it does not state in the features that this won't play in AMERICA!!!!!!.,1330128000,3,115,4.2727272727272725
4665241,1,B005EFW5M2,Don't buy this dvd and expect it to play on USA-AMERICAN blu-ray players made for region 1. This dvd box set was advertised to play on any region blu-ray players. I tried 3 players and the players would not even recognize there was a disc in the machine. I even called Amazon to report the problem and recommended that the dvd information should state that it will not play on USA region 1 players to avoid the lost time and returns. I also asked if Amazon could find this dvd set made for USA region 1 so I could buy it. I don't feel I got much help from Amazon.,1329782400,15,563,4.127272727272727
4665242,5,B005EFW5M2,"The packaging is a little odd.  There are two disk cases inside the one box.  Each disk case is a 3-disk case, even though the first season has only 2 disks.
The quality of these disks is excellent!
The cast members are different from Season One to Season Two.
The first season is titled ""Strike Back"", while the second season is titled ""Strike Back, Project Dawn"".
There is no marking ""Season One"" or ""Season Two"".
There is no index of what the different shows represent.  So, if you want to watch a particular show, you have to click through the various menus.
With the show itself I have no quarrel.  It is excellently done with a fine cast.  The villains are very villainous and become predictable eventually because they repeat their actions throughout their reign of terror.
If you like ""spec ops"" stories, this is for you.  This is not about spies even though at times it seems that way.  There is some touchy-feely stuff, but thankfully it is kept to a minimum.
All together an enjoyable experience.",1328140800,5,1007,4.623595505617978
4665243,1,B005EFW5M2,It will not run on my play station 3.  I've tried many times and I get nothing but black. It's disappointing because the show is one of my favorites.,1387584000,2,149,4.137931034482759
4665244,4,B005EFW5M2,"I live in Mexico City and was very pleasantly surprised to get this package all the way from England in a very short time and in good condition.  Now my review. I give four stars for Chris Ryan's Strike Back for a well written plot, interesting characters and very good acting.  But I was disappointed with Strike Back:Project Dawn; it took a completely different direction from the original series.  It could have stood very well on its own if the plot wasn't so absurd at times, like having a quickie in the midst of a bombing or setting up a fully operating intelligence branch (""crib"") in a matter of minutes in a different country.  And while I generally don't mind passionate scenes in an action film/series, I found the graphic moaning-and-screaming sex scenes distasteful and sometimes unnecessary in this instance.",1386979200,,823,4.857142857142857
4665245,4,B005EFW5M2,"So the intent of this review is clarification as by previous reviews and product description is not clear. To address the playback issues, I have had no issues. It really does come down to the DVD player you are using. Mine is manufactured by OPPO and handles almost everything I throw at it. Now for what you get. Box contains  2 DVD set packages. The first is Chris Ryan's Strike Back which has been recently broadcast on Cinemax as Strike Back Origins and the second is Project Dawn which is actually Season One of Strike Back on Cinemax. The only difference between Project Dawn and season 1 is Project Dawn does not have the previews or the DVD copy and the episode layout across discs is different as far as the number of DVDs. If you are getting into Strike Back and do not own season 1, pricewise, a good deal otherwise just purchase Chris Ryan's Strike Back.
I owned season 1 so I wish the product description was clearer in that regard so I have duplicate now. Will make nice gift to introduce to a friend to Strike Back.
Looking forward to season 3 coming out",1386374400,,1070,4.431472081218274
4665246,5,B005EFW5M2,"This is a anti-terrorism action show, similar to the American ""24"" except faster paced, with a bigger political plot (George Bush's WMDs), and without the boring whining Kim Bauer. If you enjoyed ""24"", you'll probably like this too. For some reason, when Strike Back was shown in the USA, they deleted season 1 and started with season 2. Maybe the George Bush plot was too controversial for thin-skinned American viewers?

The second season is a lot different from the first season. The second season has an entirely different cast, less politics, less torture porn violence, and a lot more nudity (including some full frontal). Neither season is appropriate for kids (and they are marked adult-only on the British packaging).

This Blu-Ray set is imported from England. It plays fine on my low-end LG Blu-Ray player, though other comments say that the first season's discs don't work with Sony players. Do your research before buying.",1376092800,,935,5.064935064935065
4665247,5,B005EFW5M2,"What a fun series to watch.  Excellent action series, good charaters, and excellent plot line.  Great for the conspiracy theorist.",1375833600,,130,5.45
4665248,1,B005EFW5M2,"Do not expect this to work on all bluray players,  because you will be lucky if it works.  I wouldn't waste my money on this dvd.  The series is great but not this dvd.",1373846400,,168,3.8823529411764706
4665249,1,B005EFW5M2,Disc 1 does not work - looks like it was made for European market -will not play in our Blu-ray - disc 2 works but when you pay for 2 you expect all to work,1358812800,,156,3.4857142857142858
4665250,1,B005EFW5M2,"Will not play on my brand new Sony Blu ray player.  Don't know about content.  It was great when I watched it on Cinemax last year, but cannot play in on my player.  I'm guessing it has incompatible region code.",1357603200,,211,4.225
4665251,1,B005EFW5M2,I tried and disregarded the warnings on the reviews. It will NOT play on Playstation 3 as mentioned by other reviewers on Amazon. Too bad... I have two playstation 3's  at home and will not work!,1357257600,,195,4.416666666666667
4665252,5,B005EFW5M2,"I worried that my Blu-ray wouldn't be able to play this but I bought it anyway.  I held my breath and sighed with relief when the copy right blurb filled my screen.

I can't say enough about Strike Back.  It is so much fun and powerful.  I loved seeing how it all started with John Porter.  You really can't go wrong with Richard Armitage.  Philip and Sullivan are the perfect combo rule follower and rule breaker - even if those rolls reverse sometimes. If you haven't seen it, I highly recommend it.",1354320000,,501,4.391304347826087
4665253,5,B005EFW5M2,"I can't believe how good this show is.  It is one of the best shows of its kind that I've ever seen.  I just got done watching the 2nd season on Cinemax and intent to buy it the 2nd season when it comes out.  I hope Strike Back is around for several more seasons.  If you like black bag op type action this show is for you.  The disk set came with a disclaimer about the disks not being compatible with some Blu-ray players.  They would not play on my primary player but they did play on my older Blu-ray machine.  If anyone has bought the series and can't play them definitely try to get a copy that will work, you will not be sorry.  This show is the best!",1350518400,,658,4.007692307692308
4665254,5,B005EFW5M2,"Great series, product was fine, as advertised and arrived as promised.  I enjoyed the first, more British part of the series more, seems to be higher quality all around.",1350432000,,169,4.827586206896552
4665255,1,B005EFW5M2,"Non-US format!  I bought this just prior to a business trip.  Tried it when I returned and it would not play on either bluray or DVD.  Reread the Amazon listing, and the BluRay jacket for this series and could not find any reference to a format that is not standard.  I contacted the provider just ""after"" the return expiration date, explained the situation.  No refund.  Why Amazon would allow non-standard items to be sold via their U.S. store is beyond me and I am NOT amused.  P.S. for the record I loved Strike Back Project Dawn on Cinamax.",1346371200,4,545,4.5
4665256,1,B005EFW5M2,"Sorry to give a bad review but it would not play on my blu-ray player.  I called before I ordered it and was told it would play, apparently the customer service representative I talked to wasn't informed enough.  I know the series is good and I hope series 1 comes out in a format that will work on American players.  Two is supposed to be out in August and have I have it pre-ordered.",1342051200,,385,4.175675675675675
4665257,5,B005EFW5M2,worked just fine on my insignia blu ray player. fantastic quality and an awesome show. would recommend to all potential buyers,1341532800,,126,5.0476190476190474
4665258,5,B005EFW5M2,"After reading all of the reviews about not being able to play on US Blu-Ray Player, I decided to take a chance since I had a newer Blu-Ray player and the fact that found used DVD set for $14.  Bottom line, the DVD didn't play on one of my Blu-Ray players, however it did play on the other newer Blu-Ray DVD that I had in the den.  I don't have Cinamax.  However, every once in a way it is offered free on DirecTV and I got a chance to watch two episodes of Season 2 and I was hooked.  I just finish watching season one and two over the weekend and cannot wait for Season Three.  Each episode has a cliff hanger ending and that is why I ended up watcing the entire season 1 and 2 over the weekend.

Warning!  Watching Strike Back is addictive!!!!!",1340582400,,746,4.068493150684931
4665259,5,B005EFW5M2,This is an excellent Blu-ray disc set!!! First got hooked on STRIKE BACK by watching Series 2 premier (Project Dawn) on Directv when Cinemax was preparing to launch the show; was disappointed that I never got to see Series 1 (CHRIS RYAN'S STRIKE BACK)as it was never shown on U.S. television to my knowledge. Now with this set that dilemma is resolved! Was apprehensive about bad reviews on Amazon.com order site at first but can now tell you that the reviews were BULL(EXPLETIVE DELETED)!!! The discs played first time I popped them in my VIZIO Blu-ray player with no problems what-so-ever and I am one happy camper. I would highly recommend this set to all die-hard fans of STRIKE BACK AND I CAN HARDLY WAIT FOR SERIES THREE TO BEGIN ON CINEMAX IN AUGUST 2012!!!!,1339027200,,765,4.674074074074074
4665260,5,B005EFW5M2,"I first saw Strike Back after catching it on Cinemax and loved it. This boxset is perfect for any Strike Back fan as it contains both the original Chris Ryan's Strike Back (unaired in the US and from the looks of it not coming out any time soon) and Strike Back: Project Dawn (known simply as Strike Back in the US) If you've only seen Strike Back on Cinemax or haven't read the novel, you have yet to see the story of John Porter (who was briefly seen in the first episode of that series)

Some words of warning however. Yes this Blu Ray set is Region Free. Despite what some reviews say, there is absolutely no region coding on these discs. The issue that people are experiencing is due to the fact that this was shown on TV in the UK. That means the discs are encoded in 1080i/50hz which unfortunately does not work on many US players (including the Playstation 3). You will either need a player that can display 1080i/50hz or one that will automatically convert to 1080i/60hz in order for these discs to work. I have a Samsung BD5700 which does do the conversion and had no problems watching this.

So if you do have a player that can display the discs properly, I'd highly suggest importing this set as it was much cheaper than the US release will be and you get the bonus of having the six episodes of Chris Ryan's Strike Back. Otherwise definitely pick up&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Strike-Back-The-Complete-First-Season-Cinemax-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B005LAJ15O/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Strike Back: The Complete First Season (Cinemax) (Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;when it gets released later this summer.",1337126400,27,1689,5.183150183150183
4665261,1,B005EFW5M2,"Very disappointed that what was advertised as all region is clearly not--probably playable in the UK.  Don't buy this item.  Terrific show, though.",1330732800,6,147,5.3478260869565215
4665262,1,B005EFW5M2,"I have tried a few different Blu-ray players and it will not play on any of them.  I even went so far as to try purchase another blu-ray player and It still will not work.  I have to assume it is region 2 specific.  Blu-ray players in the US are region 1.

I am in the process of trying to get a region 1 copy or a refund from the seller now.",1330300800,5,342,3.7083333333333335
8468181,5,B005EFW5M2,this is an excellent series.  Lots of action and good acting.,1517184000,,61,4.545454545454546

8468185,5,B005EFW5M2,Caution this series might cause you to binge watch all of the episodes! This series is very well written and has a great tempo. One episode flows right into the next (justifying the binge watching warning)  They do a great job getting the viewer engaged with the show. I have already pre-ordered Season 3. I am anxious for Season 4 to air and sad that it is the final season.,1430179200,,375,4.357142857142857

8468187,3,B005EFW5M2,It was ok.  Your usual British fight a good fight movie series.  Nothing like the Americans would put on screen.  Save your $$$,1413244800,,127,4.434782608695652
8468188,2,B005EFW5M2,It should have been clear that this blue ray set came from Great Britain and does not work in all blue ray players. Luckily we have a Samsung which worked but our Sony did not. Very frustrating to find out from trial and error.,1408579200,,227,4.181818181818182
8468189,5,B005EFW5M2,"While this series has some glaring flaws and inconsistencies, that doesn't stop me from loving it. Let's start with the problems. Virtually every episode has one or more shoot-'em-up scenes with a massive body count, often of a dozen or more, and the sequences are pretty much set up like the violent shooting video games that young people have been playing for the past 20 or more years (I assume it's thus being marketed to that audience). Also, there isn't much analysis of why the bad guys are THAT bad, and sometimes, the rationale can be pretty superficial - I thought this to be particularly true at the end of (North American) season two, though I'll offer no spoilers on that one. Finally, unlike, say, Game of Thrones, where ""anyone"" can die, we can feel pretty confident that the two protagonists are going to make it to the end of the season, so long as there are no problems with their contracts, or they don't drop this show to take on something even bigger (and this one is pretty big, mind you).

Now, on the positive side... It goes without saying that Philip Winchester as Stonebridge and Sullivan Stapleton as Damien Scott are absolutely inspired. This is a buddy show, and these two guys are perfect buddies in that time-honoured tradition - with Winchester the ""straight"" guy and Stapleton the ""loose (but dependable) cannon."" They are also allowed at times (never for long) to have fun, and that element of intermittent delight was never written into the (earlier) UK season one (see my review of Chris Ryan's Strike Back). As to the production budget, it's obviously of good size, and thus we are able to travel the world (literally) with our protagonists. The screenwriting is excellent, the dialogue regularly engaging and deeply insightful, and the soundtrack/music are state of the art - outstanding. The same goes for the cinematography/camerawork, and the Blu-Ray picture is crisp and clear (you will not get that in UK season one, which is equivalent in terms of the competency of its actors, but produced on a much lower budget). Finally, it should be obvious from what I have written that these are characters you will care about (Mr. Stapleton sustained a head injury in Thailand earlier this year, and I'm concerned for him in the same way I would be for a friend).... but, more than that, these are characters who will teach you about yourself and the world: that is, they often face moral dilemmas, and are able to handle them in such a way that it is necessary to reflect on one's own life and choices, and how we might measure up in the same circumstances. The moral dilemmas feel VERY real - they are not staged or strained, and the actors are at that highest level, in that they have the ability to take us to the unexplored places of our own lives.

In conclusion... this series (originating in the UK) was a surprise. I hadn't heard anything about it until seeing the first season blu-ray on display one day while shopping. So I'll rate this one my ""lucky find of the year."" (Last year, my lucky find was Orphan Black, so I think my standards are reasonably high.) If you can handle the extremely high body count, you will be rewarded with every episode. There is very little time wasted at any point in this series.

I see seasons one and two as of equivalent quality, and the characters only develop further with time. I note that this combined seasons 1 & 2 set is Blu-Ray Zone B, analogous to Region 2 in DVD. You will need a region-free Blu-Ray player, and it will take you some research to find one of those, particularly as some of them can reset to 1/A with a firmware update. Take care with your zones and regions.... As an aside, UK season one (Chris Ryan's Strike Back) is NOT available in a North American format, but all the Cinemax/HBO seasons are available in 1/A formats. (The present product is ""technically"" seasons 2 & 3 in the UK, though it is not labelled as such.)",1405123200,,3928,4.61659513590844
8468190,5,B005EFW5M2,"Strike Back season one is exactly what the doctor ordered for us fans of high octane, fast paced story telling filled with tons of explosions, sex and compelling story lines. Every character is expertly set up and explored and the fast paced tempo is kept through every episode. If you're looking for ultra-realism, go else ware because this show, at the end of the day, is supposed to be guilt free escapism for adults. The show is very entertaining and exhilarating. Buy season one, you won't be disappointed.

Strike Back Season 2 is an excellent follow-up to a great first season. The show kept me on the edge of my seat and had one surprise after the other. The acting and writing were top notch, and adding Rhona Mitra to the cast was the perfect choice as she brought the show to a whole new level. I'm looking forward to watching the 3rd season.",1387929600,2,853,4.538961038961039
