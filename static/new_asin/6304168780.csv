808438,5,6304168780,"I remember seeing this movie 20 years ago and I still love this movie. Why is it not avaiable on DVD? This seems crazy to me. It is the Best Charlie Brown Movie in my opinion. I hope they release it soon. The whole gang is in the movie and they are all so funny.

808439,5,6304168780,"I'm a huge Charlie Brown fan, I've seen ""Race for Your Life.."" about 5 times when they use to show it on TV back in the 70s and 80s, it is my absolute favorite. I really want to know when it comes out in DVD I will buy several copies for all the children in my extended family to watch good, wholesome fun characters. And yes Snoopy and Woodstock on a chooper motorcycle is hilarious! If you've never seen the movie, it's a classic...put it on your wish list ;o)",1179792000,8,462,4.144444444444445
808440,5,6304168780,"Race for your life, charlie brown was THE best one ever!  There are a lot of fun scenes and there are no areas where it gets slow and boring... it's ALL GOOD!  Just wonderful!  If you are looking to start collecting Charlie Brown, this is a MUST!!  (they only have it on VHS though)  WHEN WILL IT BE RELEASED???  I can't wait!  :-)",1158105600,4,331,4.158730158730159
808441,5,6304168780,"This is my TOP RATED Charlie Brown adventure of all time!  This story is based on a camp retreat with all of the Peanuts characters present, yeah!  While at camp, the Peanuts clan find they have different ideas of how camping should be done.  Peppermint Patty proves to be too much for the well natured intents of ""Chuck"" as he attempts to prepare breakfast not to Peppermint Patties standards, ""where's the flap jacks, Chuck?""  The tention between the gang grows until the announcement of the camp activity of a white water river rafting challenge.  The Peanuts gang join together as a team against other campers to win the title of ""Champion White Water Rafters.""  For the gang, this might prove to be more of a challange than they original set out for.  Plagued with another river raft riding crew of crooked campers, the Peanuts gang encounter many hang-ups and course changes to drive them off track and keep them from completing the course first.  The two teams set out to win the championship river riding but little do they know, it will be a lesson in friendship and teamwork too!  I loved this movie, so did my gradeschool boys!  This is an action adventure with all the greatest characters, including Peppermint Patty, Schroder, Snoopy, Charlie Brown, Linus, Lucy, and Woodstock too!  The crew is a team of all stars and I think this is a super addition to anyone's collection and classic chidrens' DVD's.  Our favorite scene comes at the beginning and end of the movie where Snoopy and Woodstock ridebehind the bus of campers on their Harley Davidson motorcycle through the deserts.  The two are just hysterically funny and so personable, you want to hop right on the back of the motorcycle and ride off with them.  My boys really identified with those motorcycle scenes too, Snoopy was his dramatic self as he dressed in black leather and had every riding accessory, very funny!",1157414400,8,1891,4.7784615384615385
808442,5,6304168780,Charlie Brown and the gang goes on a camping trip and Snoopy and Woodstock are trailing behind the bus in a motorcycle!  It doesn't get any better than this.  Good moral in the story about leadership where Charlie Brown proves himself as a great leader and can lead his friends and stand up to bullies.  They don't make them like this anymore!,1141084800,12,343,4.5
808443,5,6304168780,"After two somewhat disappointing full-length Peanuts features, ""Race for your life, Charlie Brown!"" originally released in 1977 is a real Peanuts classic! It was the third Peanuts feature out of the series of four and it was one of the best! What made this feature stand out from the previous two was the fact that all of the major characters from the series where here, those characters are Charlie Brown, Snoopy, Woodstock, Lucy, Linus, Sally, Schroeder, Peppermint Patty, Marcie and a less popular one, Franklin.

The story begins when the whole gang is sent out on bus to summer camp where they meet a trio of bullies who seem to win every camp game by winning. Even the camp's main and largest event, the multi-day river race. The gang divides itself in two groups, the boys and the girls and set off down stream to defeat the competetive bullies. In their way down the river, the two groups face many challenges and even a large thunderstorm that wipes them all out. The gang then reunites and shelter themselves in an old log cabin. Eventually, the gang gets back on the water and aim towards the finish line, but will they all make it there first together?

Although the storyline is quite simple, every scene in this movie is filled with fun! The lines are hilarious! Especially those by Peppermint Patty and Lucy. The film doesn't feature as many songs as the previous two titles, but the two songs that are in the film are great and lively, the soundtrack is also excellent! This is definitely one of the better Peanuts features out there, I recommend it most along with ""Bon Voyage, Charlie Brown (and don't come back!).""",1055894400,19,1633,4.686411149825784

Look for this movie on eBay/the web on ""LaserDisc"" (remember that format?). Much higher quality than VHS and doesn't degrade over time.

Pay a service $30 to transfer the LaserDisc to DVD or digital (MP4) and you will now have a great copy of the movie on DVD/Digital.

809526,5,6304168780,"I cannot believe how many years its been since I added this title to the ""contact me when DVD is available"" list on Amazon. I thought I put a review up of this movie years ago but I'm not seeing it now, so I'll give it a go now:

I've got this VHS, and it's long since been my favorite Peanuts movie.  It's got the best music and animation of their theatrical releases, and the story is pretty good too.  The other reviews have covered the story part though so I'll mention other thoughts...

Every year goes by and more and more Peanuts releases come out, all the other movies, and most of the TV stuff is now out there (maybe it all is, for all I know) but for some reason this one remains in the vaults somewhere.  WHY???  With many of those releases being of lower quality/inferior productions, I suspect there is some issue with the rights for this.  The way the Schultz estate has pushed all those numerous other titles, you KNOW that if they could have done this one, they would have.

I love this movie, I can quote probably 95% of it while watching it, I know it that well.  I'd love to get a good release of it on DVD, but for now the VHS has to suffice.  I'd really like it if they could do an ""isolated score"" on the DVD, (but I doubt that will ever happen) because I like the music on this movie so much.  The combination of a rock band, with some flute and horns and a well-recorded harmonica really make the music on here stand out.  The lead singer of the songs, Larry Finlayson, he did one or two of the Peanuts TV shows as well, and does an excellent job here!

I truly hope that whatever issues that have kept this out of the digital domain get ironed out and it will see a DVD release.  Maybe with some kind of ""real"" bonus features too (please don't tack on some ""Charlie Brown shows you how to brush your teeth"" bit, which I remember seeing on TV, actually!)

I rated this 5 stars, because I think it's the best of the Peanuts in animation.",1268611200,4,1962,4.180851063829787

809528,4,6304168780,"I always loved Race For Your Life, Charlie Brown. It isn't endearing with a spiritual message like the Christmas one, but it is one funny entertaining scene after another. Snoopy is classically ""cool"" on his motorcycle, teasing his little buddy Woodstock but all in good fun. Lucy and Peppermint Patty drive poor ""Chuck"" up the wall, Linus is continually mortified by Sally's loudly voiced crush on him, and a trio of bullies with a nasty cat keep sabotaging their best efforts to win the big river rafting race. So many problems come up, most of them humorous, and the ending lesson is 'it doesn't matter if you win or lose; it's how you play the game'.
