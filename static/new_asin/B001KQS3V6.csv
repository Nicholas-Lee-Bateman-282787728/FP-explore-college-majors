8315971,4,B001KQS3V6,"My son loves Noddy. He's 1 and a half. If I put this DVD in, he stops crying or settles down, no matter what else was going on. It's pretty boring for adults, I've watched it I don't know how many times. But any parent knows anything that makes the kid happy the way this show does is worth its weight in gold.

The Googleberry Moon episode scares him a little (when Sly's face gets contorted from holding his breath) but this one's pretty harmless.",1291680000,,449,4.2823529411764705
8315972,5,B001KQS3V6,"We were introduced to Noddy and Friends on the Sprout channel, which no longer airs the British show. Our then 2-yr old daughter fell in love the first time she saw it. Even our 8-month old triples (2 boys and a girl) took notice of the show when it was on the TV. We bought the set of 5 DVDs from Wal-mart, which did not include the book. The stories are ~ 10 mins long each and all are educationally based on social situations like sharing, good vs naughty behavior, cooperation, telling the truth, and even counting. The DVD sets also have a 3-4 minute segment in between each story called Say It With Noddy, during which the children are introduced to foreign languages and sounds not normally spoken in the English language. This helps with learning other languages later in life. The animation and colors are outstanding. The characters are engaging and easy for the young to identify with. We highly recommend this fun set - even the adults enjoy watching with the kids.",1278720000,3,977,4.588571428571429
