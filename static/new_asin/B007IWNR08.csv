Dont believe the monster eye on the cover,its never in this piece of crap of a movie! 95 per cent of this rip off is people running thru the jungle to get away from a UNSEEN predator that attacks in first 15 minutes of movie. Believe me..the whole movie is this group of bikers taking this trail,then that trail,no..lets take this trail!!! THE WHOLE MOVIE!!! Luckily I found a link to watch it free,but was SHOCKED to see that its 15 bucks on AMAZON!!!Save your money for something,ANYTHING else but this load of horse manure foundfootage garbage!!!! Im not usually this harsh about my reviews,but there are a lot of us found footage buffs who will spend our cash on what seems to be a good movie. THIS ISN'T ONE OF THEM!!!",1428192000,,762,4.651851851851852

8518054,1,B007IWNR08,"I couldn`t watch the dvd, it wouldn`t let me.  It indicated that my area couldn`t support showing it.  I actually googled this crappy excuse and sure enough there is some kind of law preventing the viewing of a dvd that isn`t coded for your country/geographical region",1376265600,2,268,4.804347826086956
8518055,5,B007IWNR08,"A group of friends venture out for a mountain bike ride. Four days later, during the search for the Missing group, a helmet mounted video camera is found. The Suspense becomes intense as the drama begins and Fear of the unexpected haunts throughout. Acting Performance Excellent with edge-of-your-seat thrills. Highly Recommended!",1341187200,,330,5.490196078431373
