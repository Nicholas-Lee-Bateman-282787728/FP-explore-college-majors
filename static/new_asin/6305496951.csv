1037550,4,6305496951,"I first saw Wishmaster at a midnight screening at the London Trocadero in summer 1998. I had been awake for nearly 24 hours but needed to kill some time. I was only 17, not old enough to get into the 18-rated movie, and it scared the hell out of me.

As we get older, fewer and fewer movies have the ability to scare us as we all get more savvy and jaded to the formulaic nature of most horror films. I don't know what it was about Wishmaster that spooked me so bad, but I've been a fan of the film ever since.

On a technical level, Wishmaster suffers from shoddy production design and direction that is barely above that of a cheap daytime soap opera. The acting is mostly appalling (with the exception of Andrew Divoff, who ravages the role of the Djinn/Demerest), and some of the dialogue is clunky. But, as a whole, the movie excels on pure energy alone. I mean, not only do you have more in-jokes than you can possibly count but even Jack the Ripper himself turns up before Lemmy sings hard rock over the closing credits.

There's so much potential, imagination, and over-the-top carnage that the film just whizzes by. A lot of the potential isn't taken full advantage of (the 90 minute runtime keeps things to the bare minimum) but it sets up enough mythology to justify three sequels, the first sequel being the only decent one, however.

The plot focuses on the Djinn, that's Wishmaster to you, and his efforts to take over the world. As you can see...it's pure hokum but it's the gory bits in between and the Djinn's wisecracking that make this movie worth the money. The Djinn will never be as infamous or as iconic as Freddy, Jason, Michael Myers etc, but that's not to say that he's not an utterly brilliant character. Divoff is absolutely perfect in the role. Even if all he did was real aloud from phone book he'd be mesmerizing.

If you like gore, ghoulish make-up effects, and don't mind horror humor that feels like it was conjured up by a bunch of drunken frat boys, then you'll find plenty to like about Wishmaster.

The franchise is as low-profile as it can be, but it hit its height with Wishmaster 2, which improves upon the original in terms of story, but is restricted by a lower budget.

That doesn't stop director Jack Sholder from going completely over-the-top with the gore effects or pushing the series more and more away from horror and into black comedy. Once again, Andrew Divoff is absolutely brilliant as the wisecracking Djinn/Nathaniel Demerest. Words fail to describe how funny and clever he is. He completely owns the movie despite the hotness of Holly Fields as the lead character, a thief who accidentally frees the Djinn from the fire opal.

The series descended into straight-to-DVD trash after this (which Divoff wisely passed on), but don't misjudge Wishmaster 2, it's surprisingly good and more intelligent than you'd expect.

The DVD is old and murky. Lionsgate really ought to issue a Blu Ray double feature.",938390400,6,2956,4.636711281070745

1037756,5,6305496951,"Forget what you've heard about Genies, these movies are about the Jinn.

In this series the Jinn are the personification of Evil.  They're pure malevolence.  They're the Demons the Angels Battled.  They came after the Angels, but are far older than the Human Race.  Their only goal is to enslave the Humans and remake the world in their own image.  Their power is beyond comprehension, and only has one limitation - the Jinn's power can only be used when granting a Wish.

Both these movies star a Jinn who'd been trapped in an enchanted stone.  Once free he had to charge the stone with human souls, then grant his waker 3 wishes.  Once the third wish was granted, it would mean the Apocalypse.

Both movies the Jinn twists the wishes into a horrific version of what each wisher wanted, terrifying versions of ""Careful What You Wish For"".  Both times the Jinn is unkillable.  Both times the only way to stop the Jinn, was to return him to stone.",1454198400,,946,4.565476190476191

Andrew Divoff delivers a delightfully hammy performance thats like Silence of the Lamb's Hannibal Lector amped up to caricature status when in human form. Other times he stretches the lines of menacing, evil, and um, goofy rolled into one. The Djinn form is pretty neat. The formula of the three wishes being twisted is present resulting in grisly deaths. the two movies have the Djinn granting wishes to release his Djinn brothers to this realm and to rule it.  The heroine of the movie fights against him to trap him into the magic gem from hence he was released and save the day. Robert Englund delivers a great performance as an expert on Zoroastrianism and collector of antiquities in the first one. Both movies are the best of the Wishmaster series.

This is a great late 90's horror release that has everything a fan could possibly want, the story is cool and pretty original as still to this day nobody has done a movie about an evil genie, or the Djinn as its better known here, A stone is accidently found and opened releasing the evil and he gains his power by collecting souls until his race is unleashed upon the earth, the movie is directed by the brilliant Robert Kurtzman who has done make-up effects and gore for so many classic horrors like From beyond, Re-animator 2, Tremors, Jason goes to hell and many more, so as you can expect the blood and gore and carnage is top notch in this movie with some messed up stuff going on, the movie is very star powered too with Andrew Divoff as the lead who is a brilliant horror actor and plays the Djinn perfectly, Kane Hodder (Jason) Robert Englund (Freddy) and Tony Todd (Candyman) all get a cameo too, if your a horror fan then this is a must have in the collection, it can be a tad corny in places but its a hell of a ride.

WISHMASTER 2

This is one example of a fantastic sequel to a cult classic horror, released only 2 years after the original they were quick to cash in on the franchise and rightfully so as there is so much to get from such a great character, this sequel isn't so much bigger in scale but on the same sort of level really with a fresh story that revives the Djinn from his stone, after a shootout at a museum a female thief accidently releases the evil again, in his human form he takes the fall for the robbery so he is sent to prison were there are plenty of souls to be taken, Andrew Divoff once again plays a genuinely evil Djinn character in both human and in make-up form, the effects have been increased in terms of make-up for sure this time with much more detail to the character making him look very menacing and a terrific addition the classic movie maniacs line up! There is of course you blood and gore again all great practical effects too, this is a very worthy sequel and worth adding to your horror collection.",1420848000,,2068,4.297435897435897

Andrew Divoff gives a Great performance as the Djinn that's why i think
this sequel is Just as Good as the first Wishmaster
the sequel is a similar plot to the first

Our story beings with a robbery in the very museum where Wishmaster (1997) ends.  During  a shootout between museum security and some hooded bandits, the statue which entombed our favorite wish-twisting Djinn's ruby prison is shot, loosening a chunk of stone and revealing the artifact.

Honoring the Djinn's gorily memorable emergence  in the franchise opener, part two follows suit by having the museum wall apparently ""give gory birth"" to our horribly misshapen genie (Andrew Divoff; Lost, Wishmaster) from a gore-slathered stain turned bubbly mess.  He's slimy and distorted and he wastes no time before soliciting wishes to a dying thiefwhich apparently results in the Djinn's resumption of his normal, tentacle-headed form.

Now things get a little weird.  So the Djinn goes to prison after admitting to being a museum robber and Morgana (Holly Fields), the thief who unearthed the Djinn's ruby, gets away.  As the Djinn (in Andrew Divoff's form) engages in his Monkey Paw shenanigans while serving time, Morgana has sweaty dreams in her underwear as if they share some sort of psychic link.  But why does the Djinn feel content to remain in prison?  His powers are limited to granting wishes, I suppose, so maybe he can't leaveI'm really not sure.  Is it really easier to dupe people out of their souls in prison?  He should go to an elementary school.  He should have no problem getting kids to wish away their souls for no homework, ponies, cookies for dinner and the like.

Despite how painfully slow and ineffective dial-up internet was in the 90s, Morgana somehow sleuths out what the Djinn is and what he wants.  She realizes that she has to stop him!  But why she'd want to stop him from killing a bunch of incarcerated felons is beyond me.  He needs 1001 souls before he comes for Morgana's.  I say let him take a few more criminals out first.

This sequel is helmed by the slightly more established director Jack Sholder (A Nightmare on Elm Street 2, The Hidden).  With an uninspired plot, this sequel's story is just as flimsy if not more so than the original and we enjoy a little less of the gore and the wide variety of effects presented in part one--perhaps a function of a lower budget (which was half that of the original and this is especially obvious in the final act).  But you can tell they tried to do a lot with what little they had.  I can appreciate that.

Replacing some of the gore is more actingspecifically, Andrew Divoff's menacing performance.  He's awkward yet appropriate and over-the-top yet spot on given his supernatural, riddling role.  He gets more screen time in this sequel, as well as more ""horror humor"" a la Freddy Krueger.  Andrew Divoff is great in this.

YES, they are silly at times; YES, some of the ""irony"" is painful, but what else would you expect from a djinn who ruins souls just because he can? In a way, I enjoy the second film more than the first, simply because it puts Divoff's creepy self in all sorts of situations that would be terrifying to us, but to him?

1037968,5,6305496951,"Andrew Divoff returned to reprise his role as the evil Djinn in this awesome sequel to Wishmaster or as I like to call it---Wishmaster 2: Wishmaster Goes To Prison. Yep, that's right, Wishmaster is sent to prison! During a botched art heist, one of the burglars, Morganna (Holly Fields) accidentally awakens the Djinn who takes the form of Nathaniel Demerest and takes the fall for the heist and is sent to prison. It's once he is locked inside of his cell that he puts his master plan in effect: Collect the souls of 1001 convicts so the Djinn can ""fulfill the prophecy""; take over the world and wipe out humanity.

Wishmaster goes on a bit of a killing spree by the day in prison and similar to the first film; Morganna ia haunted by visions of each murder that takes place. Wishmaster is eventually visited by Morganna and demands to know why he confessed to the robbery but he scares her away after he gives her a glimpse of his true form.

Wishmaster ends up forming a short lived alliance with one of the inmates, kills the prison warden and breaks out of prison with his ""friend"" intact. Wishmaster and his friend, Osip go to a local bar where Wishmaster begins to grow impatient, claiming he needs 800 more souls to fulfill his prophecy. The battle between good and evil comes to a head at a Las Vegas casino with the fate of humanity on the line? Can Morganna redeem herself from her past crimes and save mankind at the same time by defeating Wishmaster or will the he succeed and ultimately begin Armageddon?

Overall: This is without a doubt, in my opinion, the best Wishmaster out of all of them. Divoff's performance was a heck of a lot better in Wishmaster 2 than the first one. In the first Wishmaster, he was seen more as a smooth talking, charming demon; whereas in Wishmaster 2, he goes all out and revamps the character as completely evil and psychotic. He walks around with this silly evil grin on his face the entire movie and is a wise guy who likes to tell smartass jokes. It all mixes together to provide the perfect sequel to the first Wishmaster!

This is one of the campier slasher franchises and is reminiscent in a lot of ways of 60s and 70s horror comics, especially the Spectre. Criminals get killed in interesting and creative ways, mostly to keep an 'R' rating. The genie grants wishes, but they all go horribly wrong.

The acting, aside from Divoff (who is really, really good), is generally passable (and even has some genre celebrity cameos), and about average for the genre. The special effects are kind of *meh* aside from the occassional sequence compared to other horror franchises from the same time period, but the writing and dialogue is generally competent (though not really original), and is even above average in the case of 2 (the better of the two films).

If you like slasher films, you'll like this one too. It's pretty good. Aside from the Final Destination series, this has some of the most creative and complicated death sequences around.

But, overall, you get two perfectly watchable horror movies that benefit from a pretty good concept: that the original, horrifying legend of the genie had over the years been replaced by a watered-down Disney-fied version, which ill prepares our movie heroes when they're confronted by the original, murderous concept of the legend when he's unwittingly released from its netherworld.

According to Amazon, there are a couple of additional (and probably released directly to DVD) sequels to these films, and I can't attest to their quality.

It has a lot of potential since the idea of the djinn never dies. I'd love to see a Wishmaster 5 starring either Divoff or John Novak (from Wishmaster 3 and 4).

Most of the wish deaths in WM1 and 2 are pretty clever, and this two disc set is worth the price. If you're looking for a nice spin on making wishes, this is a series to start with. Thankfully, DJinn has plenty of screentime throughout the series, great make up FX, though there could be more gore during some of the death scenes.

Once again we have Andrew Divoff leering --- and leering seems to be nearly all he does in the sequel --- his way through the human incarnation of the role, until finally the movie reaches its predictable finish.

The problem is, the franchisers try to make the recurring character of the djinn the character for whom the fans root, so they pit him against an assortment of prison bad-asses and assorted casino lowlifes.  Nobody really feels like a victim here, because you have no sympathy for any of the recipients of the djinn's malevolence.  Most of the victims in the first outing were indeed innocent saps who were in the wrong place at the wrong time, and this indeed made a significant difference in the nature of the film.  Also the fate of the victims in the sequel tend to be simply gory and not the least bit inventive, so that wears thin pretty quickly.  As gore goes, it is pretty cheaply done.

Simply put, the original Wishmaster, while at best a mediocre film, did at least have a little flair to it.  Wishmaster 2 is simply forgettable...one viewing ought to be more than enough.

WISHMASTER (1997)

Though it takes a little effort to suspend disbelief regarding the existence of a character like the djinn--an evil, insidious genie whose granting of wishes never works out as the wishers expect--and in spite of a few gaping lapses in logic in the plot, WISHMASTER is quite an entertaining fantasy/horror flick.  The direction of Robert Kurtzman is fairly artful and tight, the special FX are plentiful and aesthetically outstanding (the gore-filled prologue is especially impressive), and the script is replete with fun twists and clever dialogue.

The acting in WISHMASTER is good, too.  Actress Tammy Lauren creates a heroine that is both tough and intelligent yet also sympathetic, and she exudes a sort of every-girl sexiness that is appealing but not too intimidating to either gender in the audience.  And as the titular granter of wishes, Andrew Divoff's performance is outstanding.  In nearly every scene in which he appears, he steals the show with his inexorable smarminess.  Also, horror fans will get a kick out of spotting genre regulars Robert Englund, Ted Raimi, and Tony Todd in supporting or cameo roles.  (Alert genre fans will also recognize the voice of Angus Scrimm--the Tall Man from 1979's PHANTASM--who narrates this film's opening prologue.)

True, WISHMASTER is certainly not a deep film, and it doesn't really break any new cinematic ground, but it's definitely a fun ride for horror and fantasy fans.  With Wes Craven as executive producer, a script from the pen of frequent Clive Barker collaborator Peter Atkins, and FX from the famed KNB Efx Group, how could it miss?

  -------

WISHMASTER 2: EVIL NEVER DIES (1999)

Though Andrew Divoff reprises his delightfully smarmy performance as the insidious djinn who grants wishes in a deceitfully literal way, this sequel from writer/director Jack Sholder is little more than an uninspired and less logical rehash of the original.  The script is too predictable and the characters are cliche and one-dimensional.  Taking over the role of the female protagonist, Holly Fields is decidedly sexier than her predecessor, but considering that her character is also a thief and a cold-blooded murderer, such overt sex appeal only detracts from her character's likability rather than adds to it.  In contrast to Tammy Lauren's protagonist in the first film, it is difficult to accept that Field's character is capable of outsmarting and thereby defeating the cunning and intelligent centuries-old djinn.

Overall, Divoff's performance is the only redeeming aspect of WISHMASTER 2, and even that isn't enough to elicit a recommendation to even the staunchest of genre fans.

  -------

In spite of the fact that it includes the stinker sequel, WISHMASTER alone makes the double-feature DVD from Artisan Entertainment well worth the very reasonable price of admission.  Both films are offered in their original 1.85:1 aspect ratio (enhanced for 16x9 TVs)--the digital transfers look pretty crisp and clean--with soundtracks in Dolby 5.1 format.  WISHMASTER, the better film, also comes with an optional director's commentary, as well as a pretty cool making-of featurette.  Fantasy and horror fans will definitely want to add this one to their film collections.

(NOTE: The four-star rating is for WISHMASTER only.  The sequel WISHMASTER 2: EVIL NEVER DIES rates two stars at best.)",1130889600,2,3470,5.3100917431192665

1038121,5,6305496951,"This is a Great double Bill with the original WISHMASTER creating the ambience which Divoff carries over to the second film. The Cast in WISHMASTER is great, Ted Raimi, Robert Englund, Tony Todd,Kane Hodder ( the only GREAT ""Jason""), and appearances by a special FX  team ( who must have appeared for scale I guess :-), and this is the same team who created the masterful opening sequence of the first film. The whole purpose of the Djinn is gradually  revealed as the body count mounts, and as Alex realises that she is inexorably tied to the essence of the Djinn, until she finally knows that she holds the solution to the problem of the Djinn in the very thing that the Djinn wants to use to destroy the world; Will Alex  triumph ? Of Course, we have  Three  Sequels :-)

Wishmaster 2 is NOT a formulaic rebuild of the first film, but in my view is a very imaginative reconstrual, and re-presentation of the Djinn's Evil  Purpose. Based on the first film, the Djinn moves again from the Statue he/it was entrapped in, and manufactures a pathway to Hell for an entire new Clientele. Divoff exudes menace, even in the presence of more physically  intimidating actors ( the prison bully, and the prison guard). And in the newly modified  Djinn suit, Divoff still exudes that same other-worldly quality.
Divoff manages to present a quality in his articulation of lines that makes his presence more alien, more foreign to the world of humans; yet, he does this still with an accessable, and very believable style.
Divoff makes the best of good scripts, and elevates their style in his own inimitable manner.",1112745600,4,1605,4.683274021352313
1038122,4,6305496951,"WISHMASTER 2 picks up where its predecessor left off:  a heist in the museum where the stone-encased djinn slumbers goes awry, causing the stone to be released from the statue, and of course, the young lady who releases it becomes the djinn's quarry.  Andrew Divoff returns in the role of the wishmaster, and he's quite good in this role; he throws off his one liners with slick aplomb and obviously delights in his own wickedness.  One scene in the prison where two Japanese kung fu guys beat up on their boss (aided by the WM) is hilarious.  There are some implausibilities in the script, such as the heroine (although she's killed a security guard, she's still pure of heart..duh!) coming to the discovery of the djinn so quickly.  Paul Johansson as the well proportioned priest is also effective, although his abandon of his celibate vows takes him down a notch.  The Wishmaster is a sick, sick villain, but the ironies of his granting peoples wishes verbatim makes for unusual results.  Bokeem Woodbine (direct to video's Denzel Washington) makes a brief appearance as a casino manager.
I like the Wishmaster series so far, haven't seen 3 and 4 yet; they're original and for shoestring budgets, I feel they do their effects quite well.

1038201,3,6305496951,"WISHMASTER 2 is one of the more successful sequels in the monster from beyond genre.  In pictures of this sort, the dramatic focus is placed squarely on the creature.  The other characters who relate to the creature, usually the [] lady and her boyfriend, are interesting only insofar as they can bounce off the menace from beyond.  Andrew Divoff is the Djinn, an eternal godlike demon who had been imprisoned for 3,000 in a Persian stone until released by a beautiful thief (Holly Fields).  The plot is your standard Djinn-who-seeks-souls retread that we have seen before.  What invests W2 with more than a modicum of interest is the often underplayed goofy grin that Divoff uses for most of his screen time.  There are several scenes in which he is in full Djinn regalia, looking like an armor-plated deep sea diver with horns.  But for most of the picture, Divoff simply walks about with no makeup at all, and as he does so, he comes across as a cross between Norman Bates and a malevolent Gomer Pyle.  Divoff takes the blame for a series of murders so that he can land in prison.  There he slowly interacts with the inmates and builds a reputation as a man who can grant wishes.  At first the inmates and guards (one of whom is Tiny Lister, who comes to regret his wish for a dance) try to intimidate him, but Divoff is the soul of politeness as he teaches both inmates and guards that the phrase 'Be careful what you wish for,' ought to be rephrased 'Choose your words with literal exactness.' Those wretches who wish using fuzzy phrases learn that exact phrasing is the true strong point of the Djinn.
WISHMASTER 2 is typical of monster-from-the-bottle genre in that special effects are frequent, disgusting, and gory.  There is a scene in a casino in which the ten biblical plagues are unleashed with predictable results.  Although Holly Fields spends much of the film showing off a fine pair of legs, Divoff is the true star, even if the material limits his ability to radiate menace with a smile that swings between Norman Bates and Norman Rockwell.  I was pleasantly surprised that the number of gross out scenes was less than those scenes that showed Divoff in one on one encounters with greedy humans who learned that what they wished for was not what they wanted at all.  Sometimes even modest fright pictures can teach a lesson even after the monster is pushed back into the bottle.",1047772800,,2396,4.6469194312796205

1038203,4,6305496951,"Now this was a surprise.  Even a quick examination of the cover and blurb for this DVD while convince you that you are holding a Class C potboiler that is most valuable as a vehicle for the consumption of popcorn.  Ugly monsters, splattered people, and, of course, bad acting.  This was exactly what I had in mind when I picked this up, only to discover that these films are a notch or two above schlock horror.  In fact, they are actually great fun.
The plots are nearly identical.  An ancient Persian statue of Ahura Mazda is brought into the U.S. by a private collector, Raymond Beaumont (Robert Englund of 'Nightmare on Elm Street' fame).  The statue's first hostile act is to fall of the boat onto Beaumont's assistant, and breaks into a zillion pieces.  One of these pieces is a weird red gem that is promptly lifted by a dockworker and pawned.  The jewel finds its way to an antique dealer and into the hands of Shannon Amberson (Wendy Benson).  She has a friend run laser tests on the jewel, it breaks, and a demonic embryo creeps out, eats the friend and heads of into the night.
An ancient prophecy requires that the demon, who goes by the name of Demarest (Andrew Divoff), must acquire souls by granting wishes, one to a customer.  When he reaches the right number of souls he has to get Wendy to make three wishes he can grant, and then he can bring his fellow djinn into our world and turn us into walking lunch boxes.  The basic difference between film one and two is that in the second film the woman's name is Morgana (Holly Fields) and her friend Gregory (Paul Johannson) has a part longer than 3 minutes.  Otherwise, number two is a clone of number one.
The surprise is that the acting is much better than it should be (Divoff is terrific), and the silly wish device is actually made to work by creating some really devious ways of granting a wish.  The special effects are simple, but good, and the gore is kept to the amount needed to make sure that you know that this really is a horror movie.  I don't think this series (there's also a number three) will ever reach cult status, but it is still gourmet popcorn eating fare.

1038204,4,6305496951,"Yeah, I admit it, they're guilty pleasures.  Wishmaster and Wishmaster 2 are low-budget horror films featuring a malevolent genie (definitely not of the Robin Williams variety) who grants people's wishes in wickedly ironic ways, then steals their souls.  The scripts are comic-book thin, basically an excuse for us to see what horrible but unintended wish the genie will grant next.  You'd think one movie like this would be enough.
That is, until you see Andrew Divoff's performance in Wishmaster 2.  This has to be one of the great horror performances in history, up there with Lugosi and Karloff's best.  Get this -- Divoff spends most of the film out of makeup, with nothing but his own face to convey a sense of inhuman menace.  Somehow, he pulls it off.  The guy manages to look terrifyingly feral, inhumanly evil as he grins cruelly and sneers at us with a voice that is part Orson Welles, part Vincent Price.  Wow!  Regardless of what you think of the plot, special effects, etc., Divoff's performance makes the DVD set worth buying.",1022025600,21,1041,4.836158192090395

1038206,2,6305496951,"Wishmaster 2: Evil Never Dies wasn't terrible for a direct-to-video effort, but it lacks everything that made the original so much fun. I bought the double-feature DVD that included both the original and the sequel, and as the end credits of this film were rolling up, I had an eerie feeling that they had just thrown this film together in a week or so just so Artisan could make a ""double-feature DVD.""
The story concerns Morgana, whom at the beginning of the film is stealing paintings from the museum in which the evil Djinn (or genie) is entombed inside of an opal resting inside of a statue, with her boyfriend and some guy who gets blown away before you can make heads-or-tails of him. Anyway, bullets are flying in a shootout that involves security guards and the two theives. One of the bullets breaks open the statue and (Guess what?!?) out pops the gem. Morgana takes it with her, and soon releases the Djinn.
After that, the Djinn transforms into his human form of Demerest, and turns himself in for the murders of two security guards who died in the shootout. After that, he enters a prison where he hopes to get plenty of wishes. The Djinn spends so much of his time in the prison, a more suitable title for this film would be ""Wishmaster 2: Demerest Does Time."" But that's just me.
Don't get me wrong. Wishmaster 2 is a decent film, especially when compared to the absolutely dreadful Wishmaster 3! Andrew Divoff is a terrific actor and is constantly threatening, hillarious, and convincing all at once. He alone saves this film from leading down the same path that W3 took.
Another problem with this movie is the gigantic loopholes in the script. For instance, one character wishes that he was never born. The Djinn grants this wish, but in the next scene, his girlfriend is still crying over his death. Uh... if he was never born... ah, nevermind.
In W2, the Djinn's makeup has been toned down. He has less armor, and looks much more human. I read that this was done to make the Djinn seem more personal and threatening, but I'm sure that was just BS and the real reason was that they didn't have the budget to restore the old makeup.",1005523200,,2150,4.558139534883721

I have yet to watch Wishmaster, but Wishmaster 2 was absolutely aweful! I spent most of the time watching it laughing at what was supposed to be dramatic or frightening. The special effects were a waste of money and the acting was just about the only scary aspect of the whole film.

Freed by some unwary crooks from his gemstone prison, Demerest sets out to finish what he started in the first film. It's quickly evident that the genie wisecracks and the stratospheric gore level have returned as well. Demerest's stays in jail and prison are both insanely gruesome and hilarious. Once out, he seeks out the surviving thief, Morgana (Holly Fields), the one for whom Demerest must fulfill wishes, in order to bring about his eeevil plan for ultimate conquest. Purifying herself, Morgana teams up w/ a priest named Gregory (Paul Johannson). Will this righteous duo be able to keep Demerest from acquiring the souls he needs, before it's too late? Yep, it's Djinn vs. Djeezuz in this cosmic celebrity death match! Luckily, Demerest still needs 800 more souls. Unluckily, he heads for Vegas to find them!
