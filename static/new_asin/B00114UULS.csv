3060214,5,B00114UULS,"For this being my first Gundam, Gundam SEED is probably the best (Aside from the fact that SEED Destiny might be better). The first two episdoes of this box set are more-or-less recap episodes which lead to kira designing OS's for Naturals. The end of the first disc is a face off between the two leads.

I won't get to much into the plot but I will tell why this Gundam is very good. Rau Le Cruset is the twistiest of anime villains, The genocidal behavior of the was is very reminisent of Elfen Lied. The characters (aside from Rau Le Cruset have very strong personalities)

OVERALL: Gundam SEED is thrilling mecha experience, that teaches you humans don't just judge those by abilities and status.",1231804800,,700,4.592
3060215,4,B00114UULS,"While the plot of the first 25 episodes in the first set was very in line with the original Mobile Suit Gundam series this is where is starts to develope it's own identity. The formula of the plot takes a drastic shift, making way for lots more action.

The first two episodes were flash back episodes which I really hate. A new character is briefly introduced in the second one, but she's such a minor character that it doesn't improve the episode's quality. The next three episodes are the beginning of the end for what we've seen so far. Kira and the rest of the Archangel crew are given refuge in the country Orb, an independent nation that wants nothing to do with the Earth Forces and the war overall. It even welcomes Coordinators to live there as a sign of good faith which really infuriates many within the Earth Forces. Orb just happens to be Cagalli's homeland and her father is it's leader.

Athrun Zala who now commands Team Creuset launches an attack after the Archangel leaves Orb, resulting in Kira killing one of Athrun's fellow Gundam pilots. In response in the following battle Athrun kills one of Kira's friends who he'd been protecting all this time. Then an all out brawl ensues between the two main characters, one of pure rage and no holding back. Though it ends in a draw, both the Strike Gundam and the Aegis Gundam are both destroyed.

After this battle it all changes. In the original Mobile Suit Gundam there was a war with two factions. It has been like that with Seed until now, The Earth Forces (Naturals) and ZAFT (Coordinators). Now a third one rises with people from both the Earth Forces and ZAFT, consisting of most of the characters we've come to know so far. Kira sets this all in motion. While he at first just fought to protect his friends, now he wants to end the war no matter what because he is sick of the fighting. The problem is that won't happen by simply fighting for the Earth Forces. For now the leader of Blue Cosmos, a coordinator hate group is gaining more power and authority of the Earth Forces military. Athrun's father meanwhile has become the leader of the plants who hates all Naturals.

Kira armed with a new Gundam along with Cagalli who has now embraced her father's Anti-War sentiment, Athrun's now former fiance Lacus Clyne with some ZAFT defectors, the Archangel with most of its crew and soldiers from Orb launch a crusade to end the war once and for all. Athrun later joins them with a new Gundam of his own after seeing his father for the hateful, cruel man that he is.

The Positive: Rau Le Creuset who was in question for the first half of the series is now truly painted as the villian. He has some very good dialogue and is always fun to watch when he takes center stage. The animation and action is just great all around!!! The three new pilots with the Earth Forces, Orga, Shani and Clotho were also fun to watch. When Kira fought against Team Creuset it always felt like he was holding back and Team Creuset defintely was holding back because they had to originally capture the Strike Gundam, not destroy it. Against the new Earth Forces Gundams though it's truly an all out battle for survival for Kira and Athrun, who now can summon the power of the Seed like Kira.

The Negative: Going back to Orga, Shani and Clotho, while they helped provide some of the best fights in the series their characters were undeveloped. The Earth Forces erased all their personal data. It would have been nice to find out more about them, like why they're so insanely ruthless. Kira's two remaining friends on the Archangel, Sai and Miriallia have little to no role in the series anymore, it's like they were just tossed aside. Sure we see Miriallia conversing with Dearka, but nothing ever comes of it. Natarle Badgiruel leaving the Archangel for another ship I felt was a bad idea. She was the only one who questioned Captain Ramius's orders which I found refreshing. The blood relationship between Kira and Cagalli I felt was poorly handled. Partly because I felt it was unneccessary because their relationship remained pretty much the same, but also they never spell out what Cagalli really is. Is she a Coordinator or something else like Orga, Shani and Clotho? Lastly some of the dialogue got just a little to preachy for my taste towards the end. Kira, ""Why do we have things like Nuclear Weapons in the first place? Why do we have guns for that matter?"" Lacus Clyne, ""We can't let one of those weapons reach the plants for it will bring about never ending tears and hatred!"" Gee no kidding!!!

You have to see these epiosdes if you haven't yet. The other reviewers are right, you want be able to stop watching once you've started.",1218067200,2,4697,4.57125890736342

Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance.

3060224,4,B00114UULS,"I do NOT give away 4 star ratings lightly (unlike some of my fellow Anime ""lovers"").

This 2nd installment in Gundam Seed was better than the first (call me dense, but ""Complete Collection, part II"" is an oxymoron...  but with this much content, I'll forgive the misnomer) in every way.

NON Spoiler (again, unlike my fellow reviewers) review:

""What is it you believe in?  What are you fighting for?  Is it that medal?  Or your fathers orders?""

For this 2nd part of the story, the drama intensifies, the true horrors of war are even more revealed and the characters (some of whom, may have appeared to be comic relief or eye candy...such as the person who uttered the above quote) become more complex, more grown up, more of a player than we were led to believe.

The ""Giant Uber Weapon Dispensing Machine"" is in full production as both sides reveal their secret weapon(s) (mobile suit and otherwise) in a bunch of ""AHA!"" moments.  It gets a little much, but does add to the suspense.

This is a ""cartoon"" but is not for children.  People are shot, bloody, chopped in half, blow up in the horrors of space (vacuum) combat and die in briefly violent ways.  I'd rate it PG13.

The music is over all passable, but with flashes of particular greatness.  The Music video alone on this set is worth watching again and again, ""Believe"" by Nami Tamaki.  I'm listening right now and getting goosebumps.  And this other particular song was beautifully haunting (and imho, under used) [EDIT - link to Youtube video deleted by Amazon.  Search on Youtube for Akatsuki no kuruma by FictionJunction and you'll find it...]

The character development, the plot twists, the music, the story, the hard edge, all were brought together in a very satisfying way.  Its not perfect, but its close.  Ironically, my biggest turn off is the cartoonish Gundams.  Giant humanoid fighting machines have only the barest of military justifications, painting them in clown colors just makes it worse.  Robotech (Macross in particular) had much more realistic looking Mechs (Gundams, whatever) and that was 25 years ago.  This grown up story with its tight production is worthy of a more grown up design of weaponry.

It is a strange mix.  On the one hand, you see the horrors of war, the loss of your friends, coming face to face with those who loved the people you killed, the treatment of Prisoners of War, civilian casualties.  Then another well choreographed battle that draws you into the action, but shouldn't I feel guilty now for enjoying it?

Guilty or not, I completely enjoyed Gundam Seed.",1253145600,,2569,4.777272727272727
3060225,2,B00114UULS,"I hate buying anything from Bandai but unfortunately they have titles that I like.
 The reason I rated it so low is because of Bandai..they just crap it out and do not care about anything else. Case in point....sound wise 99 percent of your voices will come out of the Center Channel versus like ADV Films or Geneon where when a character is off screen to the left...their voice comes out of that speaker and other sounds move around with the scene. Bandai just makes the background music come out all channels and for the most part uses the most generic sounds in this series. While in a battle their lasers sound like something out of 2 dollar toy gun for the most part.
 My beef is with Bandai not with the story ....I did like the story quite a lot. Others have reviewed the series very well which is why I said nothing.
 I was just letting you know what kind of sound quality or lack there of...you can expect in this series. Compliments of Bandai and their less than spectacular company.",1248739200,3,993,4.415300546448087

8240417,5,B00114UULS,"A great collection of anime shows that I can watch with my two sons.  Honestly, this Gundam world has become far more complicated than when I was young.  And, violent -- sign of the times.",1400371200,,188,4.3428571428571425
8240418,5,B00114UULS,"This set has the last half of the series. Great blend of action, drama, and a very good and (at least in my opinion) an excellent story to boot. You'll find yourself starting to feel different about certain characters and saddened by the loss of others as the final episodes unfold. And amidst the never lacking action you'll be on the edge of your seat just waiting to see if Kira and Athron can pull it off the ever more seeminly impossible victory. I highly recommend watching Gundam Seed as it is the one of the MOST ENTERTAINING Gundam series of all time. I recommend watching this series from start to finish, even if you are not the biggest gundam fan or even if your just a casual anime watcher, I highly recommend delving into this series.  If I could give this 10 stars.....I probably would.",1396483200,,801,4.486301369863014

8240420,5,B00114UULS,"This series has everything a Gundam or anime fan could want.  Beautiful animation, gripping characters, incredible battle scenes and an emotionally powerful story.  My personal favorite Gundam series is Gundam Wing, but Gundam Seed is the one I would recommend first to someone because I feel it is that good on every level.",1381363200,,324,5.09433962264151
