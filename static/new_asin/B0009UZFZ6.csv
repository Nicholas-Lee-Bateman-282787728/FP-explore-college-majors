It's that fun.  The outtakes are great at the end of the movie as the credits roll, and provides a behind the scenes look at Jackie's breakable body, which despite the broken leg keeps on going.  Amazing man, a fun actor to watch in action, and great stunt man. It is obvious he loves what he does and enjoys interacting with the people he works along side. Two thumbs up with a couple toes thrown in for good measure!",1459987200,,581,4.207207207207207

8067199,5,B0009UZFZ6,"Aside of the fact that these movies are a double feature, they come on one disc. If u are a fan Jackie Chan then u will like Rumble in the Bronx. It's a half action half comedy movie that will entertain you. Chow Yun-Fat delivers thrilling, action-packed performance in The Corruptor from beginning to end.",1179964800,,306,4.581818181818182
