2079732,2,B0002DB5B8,"This movie reminds me of an earlier NBC mini-series, 1997's ASTEROID. 10.5 is pure made for TV schlock, from its laughable opening scene, to its cliche after cliche narrative. Clearly this Mini-series was not made to win awards (Except maybe for the FX team) but they could have done much better with the time and budget they had to prepare this(A year and a half and 20 Million Dollars. Still, if your a disaster movie fan or just in need for mindless entertainment, this one may be for you. The highlight of this film is obviously the Special Effects, however awful, but past that you will find Beau Bridges and Kim Delaney's performances pretty decent too and if you like it enough to watch a second time I recommend watching it with director's commentary, it's very brisk and quite insightful. All in all this title has few highs and lots of lows. If you have trouble suspending disbelief this one is definitely not for you, but if you're a fan of the genre this one is at the very least, watchable.",1093392000,3,1003,4.54696132596685
2079733,1,B0002DB5B8,"First, I love Dooms day movies.  They're my favorite.  I don't know why, maybe because of the exciting special effects, and the fact that people have to survive on unusual circumstances.  But this movie was truely a dud.  The script was bad, and most of the acting was awful.  The male characters weren't bad, just what they had to say was lame.  As for Kim Delaney, she's got to be the worst actress on the planet.  I can't stand her.  After seeing her in CSI: Miami, and the fact that the show got really good after she left, I lost all interest in ever seeing her again.  Unfortunately, I saw 10.5 prior to watching CSI: Miami (which I got on DVD).  If you're interested in seeing this movie, rent it first.  That's the best way to describe it.  Then decide if you want to waste your money and buy it.",1092700800,5,804,4.286666666666667

2079747,3,B0002DB5B8,"I have to agree with the opinion of many: poor script, sometimes painfully so, pretty good special effects....and overlong for a single night's viewing. The acting was lukewarm to pretty bad, but, the actors are not to blame....they did the best that could be done with what they were given to say and do. Essentially we are given innumerable cliches  strung loosely together in barely credible sequences. Edited down to no more than 60% of its current length it might have been a halfway decent disaster movie....as it is, if you watch it for the disasters, be sure to have the popcorn ready to fill in the hackneyed material in between.",1454976000,,638,4.747747747747748

2079754,5,B0002DB5B8,"with all the current hub-bub about ""The Big One"" hitting California and the West Coast shelf, we have here the made-for-TV miniseries epic ""10.5"".  Although containing herky-jerky zoom-ins and quick-pace editing that might make one dizzy, ""10.5"" has great special effects similar to ""2012"" and ""San Andreas"".  The teenage girl character wore on me like nails on a chalkboard, and if I was John Schneider's father character, I would have swatted her behind long ago.  If you have 3 hours of time to watch the whole thing, you will be rewarded with one of the better California-in-peril disaster films.

2079759,5,B0002DB5B8,"Excellent flick, with good story-line,,, but a slightly wimpy ending, IMO.  They missed the level of soil liquidity, where buildings, and people cannot even swim in the dirt, as it is lighter than water, so the soil would swallow them down, IMO.  Of course they would have a problem hiring 'extras' for the show, if they were going to drown in dirt.  But, then, I didn't write the script. (Grin).  All in all, the video will give you a great appreciation of the movement, of earth in a really heavy quake. Little to nothing can stand up to the experience.  Buy it, and watch it again, and again. It's worth the price you pay.",1432857600,,625,4.447368421052632

2079799,1,B0002DB5B8,"That's 3 hours I'll never get back... So many questions that will never be answered. *Siiiiigh* (See below, about sighs.)

Who had to sleep with whom to get that turkey of a script produced?
Why did the governor's kid keep screaming ""Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad! Dad!"" in their action scenes?
Who planned all the sighs and sharp exhalations (there were more sighs than words with some characters, and I can imagine the script had a lot of ... sigh ... elipses)?
Why didn't the volcanoes at Mt. St. Helens, Rainier, Shasta, and Mammoth blow out some deadly carbon monoxide, ash, and magma (because that would have been COOL and would have supported the subduction theory)?
How and why did a flatbed truck of refugees from Northern California Sierras end up in Barstow (20 miles from the San Andreas Fault Zone) instead of east in Nevada, and how did they make it so fast with no freeways?
Why did all those Barstow refugees/extras smile in awe and wonder after the 10.5 quake--were they relieved that the movie was blessedly over?
How did that new canal climb the 3,000-foot Cajon Pass and not fill the LA Basin, Inland Empire, and the San Bernardino nuclear blast crater with inland seas?
And the director left forever-unanswered, how much did Phoenix, AZ real estate increase in value after the coast was toast?

The weird 1970s Brady-Bunch-type montages in Part 1 didn't carry through in Part 2, so the styles of video editing didn't match. Anyone who's had a high school or college geology 101 class--or lived in Southern California for even a year--would know that the final landscape is insanely wrong.

There was a positive point, though: Beau Bridges had his usually-bushy eyebrows trimmed for this movie, and he donated the hair to Locks of Love.

Don't bother to answer my questions by filming a sequel. Please?",1370736000,,1816,4.792332268370607
2079800,4,B0002DB5B8,"I love this movie very much! Everything about it is great! Acting, storylines, special effects, etc. The only thing I can't stand is the way it is edited with the zooming in and out constantly and double, triple or even quadruple pictures on the screen at the same time. Not well done. The zooming was the worst. Also, this DVD was only made in Full screen. When there are words on the bottom of the screen, usually when they are showing news broadcasts, viewers cannot see everything because it is cut off on the sides. Whoever makes these DVDs needs to be notified of this and needs to start making this movie in widescreen. In 2004 when this movie was made, widescreen was pretty typical for DVDs. So I question, why is this DVD not in widescreen anywhere? ""10.5 Apocalypse"" is in widescreen. Please make this happen for 10.5 DVDs!!!",1369353600,,836,4.58

However, funnily enough, you can tell where commercials were inserted because the screen goes dark for a second and comes back to finish the scene.  It's not a problem and it just made me thankful that the action wasn't truly delayed by ads for everything from autos to zebra-striped wing-tips!

The back stories of the main characters were interesting and did a great job of building up the the big finale.  There was plenty of guts and glory to go around and not every one of the leads made it through to the end.  And what an ending!  It's not every day that you see the results of the ""Big One"" and see a nation re-shaped.  This one didn't disappoint.

At first the breaks for the non-existent commercials was somewhat annoying but I quickly got used to them. The story maintains a reasonable pace and has only a couple of spots where it seems to drag a bit.

The story is set along the West Coast of the United States and involves a group of scientists who have a theory about some recent quake events. The story focuses on the work of a scientist named Dr. Samantha Hill, played by Kim Delaney, who has a theory about deep hidden fault lines and a possible catastrophic earthquake that may be coming soon.

As is customary there are a number of sub-plots that play out in the lives of the main characters. All told the acting is good and so are the scenery and special effects. I enjoyed the movie all the way through and found the surround sound to be dramatic and effective. This is a movie that will probably have some appeal for those who are not particularly drawn to disaster movies as the overall impact of the movie is to show mankind in a good light.

One could almost believe the movie was sponsored by FEMA because it is built up to show FEMA in a very favorable light. My wife commented it must have been made before Hurricane Katrina and sure enough it was made the year before that FEMA disaster. In summary it was an entertaining movie and I enjoyed watching it.",1344556800,,1423,4.444444444444445

There were many old stone monuments around the villages. They warned ""never build houses below here!"" Nevertheless, we have forgot the histrical knowledge, estimated the natural power lowly, and gone too far for desire. It was the sin of arrogance.

This movie is the adaptation of the Japanese famous SF novel ""Japan Sinks!""(1973) by Sakyo Komatsu. While the story ends by the nuclear warheads easily, in fact we have nothing against the earth itself, because we live on it.

Sadly, the fissure is already breaking apart the coastline right around Los Angeles, so the entire city has to be evacuated east, and at the end of the movie, the refugee camp is literally torn in two by the coast breaking up. There doesn't seem to be a massive loss of lives in this breakup, which is always a good thing.

2079818,1,B0002DB5B8,"(Zoom.) I am not really concerned about the bad science in this movie. If you want realism, go for a (zoom zoom) walk in the real world instead of watching a disaster movie. In fact, I liked the premise of scientists trying to stop a monstrous (zoom) earthquake with nuclear bombs. Cheesy plots can work with the right talent. The character development and sub-plots were no worse than average - better than (zoom zoom zoom) most TV movies. Although the acting was fair, the characters can best be described as annoying. With a few exceptions, the earthquake scenes and destruction were generally quite good.

My beef is with the sickening camera work. It is so bad (zoom) that I cannot recommend this movie to anyone (zoom) who would watch it for enjoyment. Rather, every freshman film student should watch this as an example of how NOT to use zoom (zoom zoom), jump cuts, and the shaky-cam effect. The camera is CONSTANTLY shaking and zooming in and out throughout the movie, even during the dialogue scenes where people (zoom zoom) just sit by the computer and talk. I don't know what the desired effect was, but (zoom) it did not work at all. (Zoom.) It reminded me of those YouTube videos where someone with a camcorder tries to imitate (zoom zoom zoom) ""the shaky camcorder effect"" by shaking the camcorder. (Hint: The shaky camcorder effect comes free without intentionally shaking it.) I half-expected the cameraman to start holding the camera sideways because it might look cool.

As a result of the amateur direction and cinematography, 10.5 is a (zoom zoom) 0.0. Yes, it is that bad. Apparently the budget for this was $20 million. If they had another $50 for a (zoom zoom) tripod, and $0.50 for some duct tape to disable the zoom button, I think it would probably earn at least three stars. (Zoom.)

2079824,3,B0002DB5B8,"Living in glitzy Los Angeles has its downside, what with the landslides, the fires, the traffic, the smog, the paparazzi, the gangs, the L.A. Clippers... and, yes, the earthquakes. This mini-series 10.5 aired on NBC in 2004 and made a case for relocating to the eastern seaboard, where they only deal with hurricanes and blizzards and frostbite and such. And, really, those things aren't near as awful as the Clippers.

Being neither expert nor fan of earthquakes, I can't tell you how scientifically on point this movie is (but apparently it's not very). But if you're into disaster flicks garnished with television-appropriate special effects and cheesy melodrama and personal angst - and why wouldn't you be? - then 10.5 is worth looking into, but strictly as a guilty pleasure.

A train drops out of sight. A town goes missing. A series of famous landmarks gets demolished, starting with the collapse of Seattle's Space Needle in a quake registering a 7.9 on the Richter scale. This opening sequence proves to be jarring in another way, tailored as it is to an MTV/sports ad sensibility, with some bloke getting tricky on his bicycle - but, of course, you can't out-trick or outrace a force of nature. In short order we meet our cast, most of whom are actually quite relevant to the crisis at hand. There's the President of the United States, played with steadfast resolve by Beau Bridges; Fred Ward's semi-dashing character heads up FEMA; Rebecca Jenkins is the governor of California trying to put up a brave front, even as her family goes missing during the quakes. But, first and foremost, there's Dr. Samantha Hill, as played by Kim Delaney. She's the main protagonist of this thing.

Dr. Hill - or ""Sam"" - is a brilliant seismologist but a control freak, and as such doesn't work well with others. She's a deep fault expert, and, despite the disbelief of her colleagues, it's her theory which ends up saving the day. Sam speculates that a series of unidentified faults is causing the chain reaction of quakes, each successive one escalating in magnitude. If you've entertained any of the more popular notions of what might happen to California should the Big One come up, well, peep this mini-series.

To round off the cast, there's John Schneider as the governor's ex gone camping with his estranged teen daughter, and I guess nothing cements a father-daughter bond quicker than an impending cataclysm. The daughter, though, is very annoying with all the shrieking and the selfishness and the shrieking. And then there's the cocky surgeon (because there always has to be an arrogant schmoe in these things) and his more reserved fellow doctor, who's having his own family issues.

In the ranks of disaster films, this one doesn't really come close to classics like AIRPORT ((<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Airport-Terminal-Pack-Airport-Airport-75-Airport-77-Airport-79-The-Concord/dp/B0000WN05A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Airport Terminal Pack (Airport/Airport '75/Airport '77/Airport '79 - The Concord)</a>),&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Towering-Inferno-Special-Edition/dp/B000EHSVOG/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Towering Inferno (Special Edition)</a>, or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Poseidon-Adventure-Special-Edition/dp/B000EHSVNW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Poseidon Adventure (Special Edition)</a>.

Except I'll tell you what, shopworn and clich-ridden this movie might be, but once I tuned in, it was real hard to stop watching. It's like candy corn - you know it's not good for you, you'll feel ashamed in the morning, and you might wake up with nausea. But so what? One hallmark of disaster films is the all-star cast, something which 10.5 is lacking, with due respect to Beau Bridges, John Schneider and Fred Ward. However, I caught this mini-series when it first came out primarily because of Kim Delaney, whose Detective Diane Russell I really dug in NYPD BLUE. Dr. Samantha Hill is actually a pedestrian role, but I still think that Delaney does a fine job with what she's given. Much as she did with Det. Russell, Delaney is able to bring out the wounded vulnerability within the icy, brilliant Sam Hill. Certainly, the movie is at its most interesting whenever she's on camera.

Everything you expect to see crops up sooner or later. The citywide panic. The mass evacuations. The refugee camps. The Californian coastline getting a face lift, and there's some irony there. Also the cheesy dialogue and the personal little dramas which are supposed to provide a humanizing counterpoint to the impersonal awesomeness of Mother Nature. Delaney and John Schneider are good. The other actors vary from decent to derivative. 10.5 does try to switch things up a bit by using various editing tricks, from split frames to jittery close-ups (I was half expecting Jack Bauer to show up somewhere). I will say that these techniques do lend the story a sharper sense of immediacy.

For those interested and willing to sit thru 2 hours 45 minutes of talk, the 10.5 dvd does come with a director's audio commentary. Anyways, 10.5 was good for the ratings and drew in enough viewers that a made-for-television sequel&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/10-5-Apocalypse/dp/B000FUTVUA/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">10.5: Apocalypse</a>&nbsp;came out in 2006, in which Kim Delaney returns but the cheesy is even more in the hizzy. And yet 10.5: APOCALYPSE isn't the worst disaster film of all tme. That honor probably falls on a stinker like AVALANCHE, KRAKATOA - EAST OF JAVA, or JAWS THE REVENGE.

I'm a Videophile and love all types of movies.  A movie is for entertainment and nothing more.

This mini-made for TV is based on reality, but goes beyond.  I was in Seattle this last August and it did not look like in the movie.  YES, it is still standing.

One of the scenes that is hard to believe is the quake outside of Redding, CA.  It seems like the quake has a mind of it's own and is chasing the train, following the tracks till it catches and devours the entire train.  Once the train is gone, the quake stops.  Also, the overhead shots of the train look too much like a toy train set.

The CGI of the final quake on the LA coast is fake looking and the background plate used shows cars and people at the beach.

All and all, it is a low budget film that is enteraining.  If you like disaster movies, you should like this one.

Maybe mine is defective - but they even refer to characters as if you were supposed to know them and their story.  The second awful thing about this - the camera work.  I know whoever shot it felt they were being ""edgy"" or something, but honestly - it was ridiculous.  Imagine you are holding a camcorder and you zoom in and zoom out again, over and over, and your hand shakes occasionally - that is how this one was shot.

Please, if you know anything at all about quakes and are fascinated by geology, don't even turn it on. It's not science fiction, it's science fantasy.",1215216000,,573,4.466666666666667
2079830,2,B0002DB5B8,"After hearing some hype about this movie, I thought it might be a good film to watch on a lazy Saturday afternoon.  ""Disaster"" flicks were popular when I was growing up (Volcano, Dante's Peak, Asteroid, etc.), so I've learned a suspend a little disbelief over the years.  This film, however, was hardly worth the time.

My first dislike was the fact that this ""disaster"" was scientifically impossible.  Again, when it comes to disaster films, one must suspend a little disbelief, but this film blantly disregarded geological science.  I'm not a geologist personally, but I've taken college-level courses in that field and know plenty of geologists who are practically crying because of the impossibility of ""chain reaction"" earthquakes tearing California off the coast.  Yeah, okay, some may say that ""nothing in science is for sure fact"", but this film is basically like writing a screenplay for a ""disaster"" where scientific experimentation has caused gravity to intensify seven fold unless the hero can find a way to reverse one of the universe's strongest forces.

My second dislike was the acting and the dialogue.  None of the characters were memorable ones.  There was a dad and daughter in the forest, a wimpy president, his buddy who runs FEMA (before Katrina, clearly), some doctors, a few family members, a governor, two scientists, and state office assistants.  Believe it or not, are all tied together by three degrees of separation, everyone except some ridiculous bike guy who rides around, escaping a falling city around him.  None of their subplots were remarkably exciting.  The only way I could distinguish them was by knowing that some had worse acting than others.  There were some one-liners that I seriously wonder what agent would ever pick up a screenwriter who writes that kind of stuff (especially since I'm trying to find one myself and my writing is (I'm told) much better).

The third dislike was the action and graphics.  On a scene where the Golden Gate Bridge is in trouble, the cars perched on there are clearly Matchbox cars, without a doubt in the world.  Watching them fall into the water had me laughing myself to tears.  The Seattle Space Needle collapse was poorly done through use of computer-aided graphics.  Even the cracks that formed from the quakes were too fake to let pass.  Granted, it was a low budget flick, but seriously.

This movie made the classic movie mistake of overdoing the action sequences and underfilming them.  There are at least four scenes where the same 4-second shot is taken from different cameras to expand the time used to 16 seconds.  Additionally, some action sequences were occurring that weren't necessary.  For example, is it really necessary to show 15 car crash sequences when an earthquake occurs?  Wouldn't only 3 or 4 happen and then all drivers would be stopped?  Furthermore, how is it possible that all these scientists have such little time to solve the problem, but can create these amazing graphical presentations with flashing map images and beeping sounds?

To summarize, most disaster flicks require one to suspend disbelief.  Some of these flicks, such as ""The Day After Tomorrow"", are reaches that could be assumed to happen if conditions were really, really bad.  This movie, however, was produced by someone who never consulted a geologist or even a first-year college student who took a mandatory geology course.  Coupled with weak actors, poor dialogue, and dry action sequences, 10.5 flops on its face.  If you're someone who likes campy 4-hour disaster movies and don't care if the science is accurate or not, then this would probably be a decent movie for you.  For the rest of us, you're better off spending that time doing something else.  I only give it 2 stars (vs. 1) because, as a writer, I can see that this script originally had hope and, had its screenwriting, dialogue, and actor choice been changed, it would have been much more successful.",1207353600,,3950,4.974085365853658
2079831,4,B0002DB5B8,"Watching this a second time, two things struck me:

  1) It didn't have the usual 5 soap stories going on, the stock everybody characters, but mainly one that was nice and concise, with the ever reliable John Schneider, and his daughter, and less the wife. plus a bit of a couple of others. So, main characters were the Earthquake experts, and the ideal President, with their everincreasing dilemma.

  2) The best time to watch this is after a C grade movie that left me wanting, lacking tension (mine was Fire Serpent). In contrast 10.5 was good and clever. It always had tension with always something going on. Despite a gaping but entertaining fault or two, ha. But who hasn't got faults?

  Well ok, 3 then) And this film can technically be classed as science fiction - meaning it's about science but a fantasy. No problem with an unreal event then. IF it is. And it's easy to ignore the main problem that the budget seemed to have run out at the end, with neverending scenes of people running about in varous modes of slow mo, go mo, jerk mo (18 frames p/s), and stop sound, in the earthquaking desert. That was the most disappointing part of the film, that part of the climax.

2079842,1,B0002DB5B8,"I know that in most natural disaster flicks they don't always get all of the technical details right, or they push the boundaries of reality a bit in order to tell a better story.  I liked ""Volcano"" and ""Dante's Peak"" despite their taking of artistic license.  They seemed to have consulted a scientist to at least learn the basics.  But this made-for-TV tripe goes beyond belief into the realm of laughable drivel.

Indeed, the only redeeming quality of the movie is that it is SO ridiculously wrong that you start laughing in disbelief at its stupidity.

Here are some of the technical wrongs:

~In each earthquake, for some reason the richter scale is a variable number that increases as the earthquake progresses and then decreases as the earthquake comes to an end.  In reality, the richter scale measures the total energy released through the entire event.  It can only be determined after the fact.

~If I remember my geology classes correctly, a 10.5 earthquake isn't possible.

~When a fault line ""breaks"" it does not create a sinkhole that follows train tracks around curves and only stops when it finally swallows the train that it has been chasing.  Get real.

~In the opening sequence, a cyclist outruns the earthquake waves.  No way anyone could ride a bike that fast.  The waves of an earthquake travel probably hundreds or thousands of miles an hour.  I don't know the exact number, but it's much faster than the 10 mph that a biker could go.

~Setting off a nuclear explosion wouldn't seal an earthquake fault.  It would create thousands more.

Anyway, this is just a taste of the inaccuracies that were inserted solely for theatrical effect.  Unfortunately I was not on the edge of my seat out of suspense.  I lost all interest in the movie after the first 10 seconds, but kept watching because I was given extra credit in geology for writing an essay about how terrible the movie was.",1164758400,2,1903,4.7439024390243905

The vocabulary used and tracing the faults showed much looking into the probability of how it could happen. The connection with the families involved

was extremely good and thought out. I would rhink that it would make people aware of the importance to have themselves ready for any earthquake. I say again, it is a very good TV. made movie and the writter should be commmended.",1151798400,3,535,4.515463917525773
2079845,2,B0002DB5B8,"Gee, it was until I watched this movie when I became able to understand why some reviewers get so angry at some movies or novels. I had never seen characters as stupid, immature and obnoxious as the ones from this product. I've been open minded to several movies -you can see it in my reviews- but this one was too much, and this time I do agree with all reviewers who have disliked this product for the same reason I just mentioned. Do you think we are exaggerating? Check just two small pieces:

-In one scene, a girl and her dad found a town buried by an earthquake. She insisted on hearing some music from the ground, so his dad went to search to look for people to help, but then she asked her dad why he went when there's nobody, and keept bothering all along. Did she have X-rays to see underground? Anyway, this perfectly rich-spoiled-brat would definitively win -if existed- the Jerk Nobel prize and graduate with top honors from PhD jerk studies from Harvard.
-In another scene, the California's governor's top assistant gets her couple throwing a fir over the phone and calling her repeatedly about why they don't have children (or else, I don't care) while the earthquakes eat California and Washington.

The movie starts with a big array of people acting up and demanding attention for themselves while caring nothing whatsoever about other people's problems, no matter there's an emergency state. The classical monsters like vampires, dragons, demons and the like are nothing compared with the stuff you see in this movie. Later on, as anybody can image, everybody is asking forgiveness and telling how much they actually loved each other, over and over all along the movie. I like emotions in movies for sure, but this was plain disgusting to me..specially for 3 hours! But if this is the type of scenes you like, you'll get tons of it in here! And you'll rank it 5 starts! As for me, I really thank the ones who invented the DVDs which allow speeding movies up so I don't need to put up with so much baloney as I would with the old VHS. Today we can see only what we want from a movie. Well, let's pass to the interesting parts.

This movie seems to be a reply to the current anti-fear-mongering wave I've noticed lately. This wave is led by Conservative (or the like) people. The top example could be Michael Crichton's (creator of Jurassic Park, ER, Rising Sun, Sphere, etc) latest novel ""State of Fear"" and his web site where he displays a big deal of arguments and critics against all the media that keep the whole world under constant fear about everything. But this movie shows the government risking millions of people in order to avoid general panic. So, the government initially rejects the fear-mongers who predict huge catastrophes. This is interesting but it's still a movie and what I've read from Michael Crichton and others is likely to be real. At least the movie writers seem to have done some decent research. Moreover they did well in presenting all predictions and solutions in the movie as speculations. It was actually interesting hearing the scientific arguments of Dr. Hill who sees the problems and solutions. That may have been good hard science fiction.

Unfortunately these interesting aspects were far from the movie's core, which was emotions and more wild emotions with lots of people caring and caring....no matter they oppose actual solutions...all the time. You'll see that some people get to be evacuated and then the president (so charmingly caring) wants to let them go back home immediately but Dr. Hill has to convince him to wait ridiculous 24 hrs to make things sure. This was too off real world as well.

Regarding the special effects, some people didn't like them but I did. If this is what you're looking for I strongly advise you to speed the movie all the time without action scenes, which in fact are not many. You can tell this was made for TV in several scenes. Some people thought that it was too long as a movie, but once again, it all depends on what you like. If you like emotions and special effects, this shouldn't matter to you, other wise keep away from wasting your time with this thing.",1143072000,3,4161,4.663487738419619

2079847,3,B0002DB5B8,"Which version of ""10.5"" were all of you watching? Yes I will admit it wasn't the greatest disaster movie out there and some of the special effects were obviously fake ( like that scene when the quake swallowed the moving train.) , but I give it 3 stars (3 as in I thought it was Ok) . From what everyone who reviewed this movie said, it made me think that it was a horrible piece of crap. I have seen better disaster movies and I have seen worse disaster movies. It must have been sort of boring to me because I fell asleep for about  an hour in the middle of it, but when I woke up it didn't seem like I missed anything. This movie did have the clichs you would expect from a made for TV movie, but its just one of those movies where you can sit back, shut your brain off, get a bag of popcorn, and enjoy. Don't try to anaylyse it. IT""S A FREAKING MOVIE!!!",1137974400,5,857,4.011695906432749
2079848,4,B0002DB5B8,"Although the possibility of a 10.5 earthquake is minimal,and would be far more damaging that shown in the movie, this turned out to be an enjoyable piece of work. A fast moving plot from the word go, it has all the elements of a top rate disaster film. The special effects and character casting are on par with Earthquake, one of the first disaster movie of this scale. Mr, Bridges, like Mr. Heston, were by far the best choice of many fine actors and in my opinion could be the only choice for these parts.

  From a scientific point however, a 10.5 quake would have devistating effects felt from the west to the east coast with far more personal tragic outcomes than were portayed.

  Overall, a very good movie for those who like a fast mover.",1125100800,10,746,4.448529411764706
2079849,2,B0002DB5B8,"One of the supporting actresses said it best in this movie, ""Forget what you saw on TV.""  The entire disaster is based on, well, make-believe.

And to top it off, it appears the only person in the entire country who figured out what is going on has written scientific books that nobody else believes.  Everybody else are idiots and have absolutely no idea what to do.  In fact, the head of FEMA, who has been placed in charge of overseeing the problems, can't seem to come up with more than one plan.  He draws a complete blank when asked for a contingency plan.

And then there is the entire nuclear warhead thing is just laughable and a complete ripoff of Armagedon.  The only thing missing was Bruce Willis.

The only thing that was promised and delivered was the special effects.  It actually wasn't all that bad for a made-for-TV movie.  Unfortunately, that is the only good thing I can come up wtih.

The acting was silly, the dialogue was horrocious, the length was way too long, and the reality wasn't existent.  All in all, I would not recommend this unless you are really into disaster flicks (which my wife is and why I ended up watching it myself).",1122422400,4,1160,4.524038461538462
2079850,2,B0002DB5B8,"I'm not even sure why my mother watched this movie, I'm not sure why I watched this movie with her. I can't remember it all that well but I can tell you that ""10.5"" is not even worth staring at. I swear that it was a blatant rip off or at least some cheesy would-be TV movie that was spawned from watching ""The Day after Tomorrow"" trailers ... or was that ""Storm of Destruction"" staring an overweight Rodney Quaid? Oh wait, I'm getting ahead of myself. I don't care if the actor that plays Jonathan Kent in ""Smallville"" (my favorite character) is in it. Ironically his name is ""CLARK"" in this movie. I laughed for several minutes upon hearing that.

But If your still curious as what this movie is about Let me fill you in because that's all I can do. For some reason an earthquake that surpasses its nomral capacity in Washington (If I'm correct) begins to arise from the depths of the earth to cut the nations of the world in half, several people that specialize in this sorta stuff go to find out what's causing this.

While doing so we switch to several other people POV when the earthquake makes its appearance; Consisting of a Daughter and Father with problems concerning his wife and a bunch of other people. That's pretty much it although my summary might be a bit off.

Its boring, its cheesy, I can't wonder for the love of me why my mother watched it. But if your still gonna watch it don't say I didn't warn you. You'll get a good laugh at the horrible acting, crappy scrpit, writing, would-be touching moments, (""I love you son."" - ""I love you too, dad."" *GAG*) and crummy special-affects (rocks still bounce when they hit the ground and they still try to make you feel sad when they destroy the Government's prized bridge of San fransico).",1116288000,5,1753,4.454828660436137
2079851,3,B0002DB5B8,"One must give credit to the makers of the 2004 NBC-TV 2-part movie 10.5--they do give us plenty of spectacular special effects in the story of the entire West Coast being reshaped by a chain of enormously destructive earthquakes.  What they DON'T give us, however, is a plot that stands up to any close scrutiny for more than a few minutes at the most, and usually no more than a few seconds.

Kim Delaney is the maverick seismologist who insists that there are interlocking earthquake faults ready to erupt and break much of the West Coast away from the rest of the United States--a fear magnified by quakes that topple the Space Needle in Seattle, and the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco.  Then there is the dreaded southeastern edge of the infamous San Andreas Fault Zone, which passes less than 80 miles from Los Angeles.  And unless drastic measures of the W.M.D. kind are tried to repair the fault line, more than Hell will break loose.

Obviously the special effects work was what attracted large viewers to their TVs in May 2004 to watch this $20 million spectacular, and with good reason; the effects ARE the reason to watch it.  Beyond all that, however, a good cast which includes Fred Ward, John Schneider, and Beau Bridges, is left out to dry with lousy dialogue, melodramatic situations that wouldn't even have passed muster in any of the disaster films of the 1970s, least of all the 1974 specatcular EARTHQUAKE, and a thoroughly implausible premise.

Still, for the special effects, if nothing else, I am giving this three stars.  The scenes of Seattle, San Francisco, and Los Angeles all being eaten alive by the ground beneath them are the real reason that ""10.5"" works at all.",1115596800,6,1699,4.735593220338983

2079853,1,B0002DB5B8,i'll take a page out of the director's book when he came up with the title for this film and give it a negative one on a one to ten scale. my ten year old nephew could have done better special effects and don't get me started on the acting or script. it's sad that i wasted a couple hours of my life (a couple hours i can never get back) watching this garbage; it should be banned from society.,1112400000,2,394,3.9375
2079854,1,B0002DB5B8,"What a tragic piece of television cinema this was.  When I use the word tragic, I am not referencing the events that took place in the actual story of the movie, but the way that this film was made.  It was hysterical, horrendous, and pathetic to think that there were actual paychecks handed out for this project.  The graphics looked like something pre-schoolers were asked to create using glue, paper mache, and their left over Hot Wheels cars.  Honestly, during one of the devastating scenes in this movie, I thought that I saw Hot Wheel on the bottom of one of the cars giving me a true indication of the low production value.  Let me just say that if 10.5 was a sandwich, than it would be heavy on the clichs.  You could not turn away from this film for a minute for fear that you were going to miss yet another clichd moment that has been used in nearly every disaster movie ever made.  From the acting to the story and even the graphics, everything seemed like it had been done before, and 10.5 times better.

Our first image of this film sets the tone, but doesn't quite prepare us for the hilarity that will ensure further along in the movie.  As we witness a biker successfully manage his way through destruction without even a scratch, our idea of reality is lost.  Being able to outrun the Space Needle is sheer lunacy, and I will not go into the misleading way that they represented the Space Needle's structure (as most have in other reviews).  I was laughing while this scene was happening questioning my choice of this film.  Then, as if pulled from the pages of Sam Raimi's early work, we witness a train be completely eaten by the earthquake.  Paper mache in full effect, it is as if it is chasing the train in this horror story styled moment that leaves so much to be desired.  I couldn't tell if our characters were concerned about the tragedies that were befalling their state or the way that the director, John Lafia, represented the catastrophe with very cheap effects.

I cannot merely say that the graphics are what ruined this film, because everything was equal.  The acting and the story were equally as poor giving us one of the largest (and lengthiest) television duds I have ever encountered.  Beau Bridges as this sympathetic President was horrible.  I could just see President Bush watching this movie at home and saying to himself, ""The earthquakes hate our freedom ... they are freedom-haters"".  I really could hear these words when I watched this film.  I mentioned Bridges, but the acting was bad on all counts.  The family dynamics that ironically all of our characters are fighting was a HUGE clich that only created more implausibility to our story.  Oh, our lives are horrible, but a huge disaster like an earthquake could just bring everyone closer together ... let's watch and see!  There was one point when I thought that John Schneider was going to break a window to a car, jump into via the window, and speed away talking about how ""ain't no Boss Hog gonna git him"".  That would have been horrible, but at the same time semi-redeemable for this film.

Finally, I need to say to everyone that was involved in this film and for future natural disaster filmmakers, nuclear power does not solve all of our problems.  I do not think we have harnessed the ability to stop Mother Nature from taking her course, and that no matter how hard we try, events will happen that will be catastrophic.  We need to realize that this Earth was here long before nuclear power, long before humans, and will be long after we are gone.  Sometimes I wish I could watch a film where the characters just allowed nature to take its course, and we could see the raw beauty of our world.  I hated the fact that this earthquake was this evil train-eating beast that needed to be tamed.  I felt that if earthquakes had a union, they would not be too pleased with their representation in this film.  I was hoping for some good acting, some decent graphics, and at least a story that would spark the interest, but instead I ended up with three goose eggs.

 Overall, if you can't tell already, I really disliked this film.  There was no redeeming value to it at all.  I remember friends and co-workers talking about this series when it was on television and how they couldn't wait to see the next part.  All I can say to them is that they need to get outside more often.  If 10.5 doesn't give you enough of a reason to throw your television out the window, then I don't know what will.  Avoid this film like the plague, and I promise you that your overall level of life comfort will be much better.  A definite Mr. Yuk sticker deserves to be placed on this film!

2079855,1,B0002DB5B8,"Okay, the biggest problem I had with this movie (besides the cheesy, over-the-top acting) was the fact that the movie makers didn't do their research.  On top of getting the geological facts wrong, they also got any fact about Redding, Calf. wrong.

First of all, there is no Mt. Retnault in Redding.  They would either be at Mt. Shasta or Mt. Lassen.  Second of all, Redding is a populated area.  It's not even in the mountains.  And third of all, if an earthquake that strong had hit Redding then Shasta Dam would have most likely exploded, and the entire region, from Redding to San Fransisco, would have been flooded out.",1110240000,2,625,4.636363636363637
2079856,4,B0002DB5B8,"Is this a great film - no, is it enjoyable - yes. The only thing this film asks is that the viewer has an enjoyable time. The producers are not trying to teach lessons about actual earthquakes - so what if a 10.5 is impossible on the Richter scale. What it indicates is that this was a horrible earthquake. So what if the survival camp was set up on a fault line. How many people actually know where fault lines are. There is supposed to be one in my general area in New York State, but none of the general public knows where it is.

Forget all the technical stuff and just sit back and enjoy the film. Laugh at the less than perfect effects and say to yourself that you could do better with your own camcorder in the back yard.

It is almost impossible to be serious about all the disaster films so simply have fun with this one.",1108857600,19,830,4.149068322981367
2079857,3,B0002DB5B8,"I remember at the time that real earthquake scientists didn't know whether to laugh or cry when this one came out. I thought it did OK for a TV disaster drama with the usual divorced parents and their difficulties (except in this case Mom is governor of the state), the brilliant young scientist with the radical, but correct, theory about the quakes- and the tough boss who doesn't believe at first but comes to his senses and ultimately saves the day.

I think the idea of deep faults has now been proven (the writers did say they did their research on the internet)but that idea of fusing them with nuclear blasts doesn't work for me, especially when done at depths of only a few hundred feet. I'd think that trying to fuse something like that would only make it worse either by REALLY cutting things loose or actually fusing and letting pressures build up even more.

What sap would put an evacuee camp on a faultline as they did in this movie?, that was actually the dumbest thing in the whole thing.

The FX were generally good although the quicksand that John Schneider got caught up in looked fake and the breakup of the Golden Gate Bridge did have a model look to it.",1105488000,17,1176,4.485981308411215
2079858,1,B0002DB5B8,"This is by far the single worst mini-series I have ever seen. Horried special effect. The best part of the movie is the first 5 minutes with the earthquake with the bicycle rider. It went downhill from there.

They say if you put enough monkeys in front of typewriters and gave them enough time, the complete works of Shakesphere could be written. The show 10.5 would rate about 16 monkeys and forty five minutes to knock out, so long just for length.

Was there anything postive. yes, the bike rider, the Goldengate bridge going down and the end credits (it was over). The overall story idea is really cool, just all the action and dialouge was horrid. I belive this is what they call a Resume Stain of a miniseries.",1097971200,3,717,4.507692307692308
2079859,4,B0002DB5B8,"A made for tv movie, 10.5 attempts to be the mother of all earthquake films, and on some levels, it succeeds.  Even though many of the effects are obviously models, one can't deny the impact of seeing the Golden Gate Bridge and the Seattle Needle tumble to the ground.  At nearly three hours long, it does have its draggy moments, and some of the dialogue is cliche and dull.  However, if you take it for what it is, it far surpasses the theatrical EARTHQUAKE and isn't bad.  Kim Delaney, Ivan Sergei, and Yvette Jackson do well in their roles.  A lot of unknowns surfeit the cast, and some do well, others are merely bodies.  John Schneider and his daughter's scenes are poorly executed, but the reunion with mother governor is touching.  Veterans Beau Bridges and Fred Ward lend their solid support.  The earthquakes themselves are devastating in their destruction and the end is a little far-fetched, but hey it's a movie, and for what I expected, it satisfied me.",1095724800,9,967,4.680473372781065

2079861,3,B0002DB5B8,"There are lots of good things about this movie, but some aspects of it detracted from my enjoyment.

First of all, the camera movement / cinematography tries too hard to be ""hip.""  You can almost hear the producers telling the movie-makers to ""shoot this documentary style like you're in the trenches with the people.""  As a result, the camera clumsily jerks in and out on character faces (way too close, in my opinion), it moves around too much for you to get a grasp on what's happening in many scenes.. it shakes too much in scenes when there's not a QUAKE happening.  In my opinion, this clumsy ""hip"" camera movement (pseudo-MTV style) detracts bigtime from the storytelling of this movie.  Just when I got into the movie/story, the herky-jerky camera movements constantly took me out of the experience, reminding me it was just a movie.  That is a storytelling failure.

The effects work is great.  But there's not enough of it.  Why do producers always shortchange the effects work when the film clearly needs more?  Come one, man... you want to see effects when your movie is called 10.5.  Get some college kids who do effects work at home to do it for free (for experience) or something... spend some money.  For example, the destruction of San Fran was represented by the destruction of the Golden Gate Bridge and a few token buildings.  They forgot there was also a city there, and maybe 5-10 more effects shots (establishing shots) would have sufficed.  The final payoff is good, and the entire last sequence was unexpectedly great.  I thought the movie was going to end when the heroes did their thing... but it kept going interestingly.  The draining river was a chilling, nice touch.  Overall, the effects work is great.. just needs more.

The acting was okay.  Beau was fantastic, but Delaney was only okay.  She seemed bored in her role.  I can almost imagine her ragging on the script after the director yelled ""cut.""  To be fair, maybe it wasn't her fault, because the ""overeager"" camerawork often jerked in and out on her face, trying to create some kind of emotion by closing in on her face from inches away.  Maybe they just kept filming to get some kind of ""real"" touch after the director yelled ""cut.""  I don't know.  I thought the Dukes of Hazzard guy was pretty good in his role.  So was the doctor... Nolan's son.  REMO was great... very believable.  I actually felt something for his character at the end.

Overall, it's a good disaster movie if you like that genre.  You have to be willing to put up with the above to truly enjoy it.  I got it at Wal Mart, but it's not a keeper, in my opinion.
