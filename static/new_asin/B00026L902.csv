If you want to throw your money away,  this is the one movie to buy. Otherwise donate to your favorite charity - you'll feel better in the morning. Would have given a 0 star rating if possible. If it sold for $.50 - still would not have given it a 1* rating. Whoever wrote the original review(s) must have been watching some other movie for sure - or their head was influenced by some illegal substance.",1495584000,,549,4.228571428571429

8023031,4,B00026L902,"This is a movie that is full of suspense. You have to figure out what happens and how it ties togeather. However, it is rare that a suspense movie  can be watched again and again. This is where this movie breaks the mold. The more times you watch it, the more details you pick up, and the deeper you are drawn into this well thought out and told story. Great story, low budget, but well done. The CSI team was 2nd rate the reason for only 4 stars, but the detectives were first rate. If you liked blade runner, you will love this. Too bad this does not have a book to go with it.",1127174400,5,579,4.034782608695652
