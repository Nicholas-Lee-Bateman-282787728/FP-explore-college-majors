8473825,1,B005HWAOG6,"This series proudly counts itself among the worst anime in existence. It really has little redeeming value. Graphics are pretty, but nothing to write home about. Voice acting is truly atrocious, even (especially?) on the Japanese track - the main character speaks as if she has a cold, the rest of them are equally atrocious. Does have one of the rare examples of a male seiyuu voicing a female character, and, well, it just adds to the overall confusion of what the hell is going on.

The story is all over the place, it has no logical flow. It somehow tried to reconcile the plot of a random passerby getting hit by a car 20 years prior to story starting with a story of the end of the world, with the story of two girls going shopping, someone using a vibrator, and mech shooting at an infant to name the few. They really are as disconnected as they sound.

Frankly, I have no idea how it gotten licensed here, let alone how it has gotten a dub. And then they released a movie version of it, too! The movie is exactly the same as ova, but they added 3 minutes at the beginning and 3 minutes at the end changing nothing else.

This series does have its place, though - it is excellent at scarring people who have yet to see it. I have played it at the anime club couple of times and seen grown men cry in terror and confusion because of it.",1387756800,4,1342,4.254901960784314

8473827,3,B005HWAOG6,"This anime film strives hard to hammer the point to the viewer that mankind was responsible for his own demise. It really goes over this over and over until one comes away with that fact rather then the quality of the story itself. The film has high quality animation but the plot sometimes gets lost in favor of the writers wanting too many subplots that are not resolved by the films end. The story- in 2012 a Russian space station falls to Earth and was carrying a biological agent that ends up killing off billions. Males are more susceptible to the virus and chaos envelops the world. North America is devastated by a nuclear disaster and the remnants of the US navy try to take over Tokyo. The Japanese defeat the invaders and decides on isolation from the global chaos. Many years later the last man dies leaving a population solely of women living in the Tokyo region. (20,000 is the pop.) Now the film really starts and within the first hour the viewer knows the faction of the Guardsmen (the SDF of the future) want to preserve the race somehow but the Kisunaragi (the nobility) want the human race to face extinction as humans have had their time. The rodan like creatures in one scene have no interest in eating humans because we are now poison to all wildlife due to the ecological corruption in our bodies. ICE refers to the biological agent that may allow humanity to survive past the current (and last) generation. The concept has its merits but the application in the film will have many viewers wondering why the writers had to make the story so disjointed rather than have the story more straight forward. Looking at the film one wishes that the story had more overall flow rather than having to piece it together.",1369958400,,1733,4.593548387096774
8473828,4,B005HWAOG6,"Nice animation, good characters and a tiny bit of nudity but not much of a story. I am a huge anime fan and i love watching as many anime movies, ova's or others. I came across this cuz I saw it at a store once but it was too expensive. I saw it on here and still passed, then one day I found it in a local anime shop and bought it pretty cheap. Anyways,I've seen this about 3 times and still couldn't find much of a good story but i do like the look of the girls and there are LOTS! lol. lots of action so check it out if you think its intresting. I recommend it, not highly though",1354147200,2,582,3.8181818181818183
8473829,3,B005HWAOG6,It was fairly entertaining. It started out a little slow but once you get pass the first part it a little more exciting.,1334793600,,120,4.260869565217392
8473830,3,B005HWAOG6,"This anime comes in three parts and is the saga of two? women in the future, after a virus has killed all the men in the world. As such, there is a strong feminist current running through it about about seeking love from other women. Instead of looking at men and women as two sides to the same coin, there is a tendency to look on men as an alien species responsible for all the evils in the world, which seem to include guns and creation of the virus that killed them and poisoned the world. Because of these things and the violence, I would not recommend it for kids.

The story starts with a woman who says that she is a virgin (she has a baby later), getting killed in a car accident. Now, fast forward to the future after the men have died, and we find that her spirit is coexisting with a woman warrior (Heroine #1).  There are two factions at that point, one that wants to live in hedonism and kill everyone, and the other that wants to stop the rush to oblivion. Avoiding the use of guns (since they were used by the evil men), they instead chop each other to bits using swords. Heroine #1 is on one side and Heroine #2 is on the other.  Battles ensue.

The main reason that I rated this down is that the plot line? has more holes in it than the end of Evangelion. Why do they keep Heroine #1 in a locked cage in the transport when they also let her run freely otherwise, even to eating dinner with the leaders of both factions?  What does the leader of one faction being the daughter of a jellyfish and a woman add to the plot? They didn't need that to have her set off the doomsday device. How does a virgin in the past get pregnant from a woman in the future? Even if she got pregnant, what did it add to the plot? How are the women better better than the men when they go around killing each other off? Even after they stopped the doomsday device, I'm not sure what they finally accomplished - they still didn't create any men in the future like they wanted to.

The reason that I gave it three stars was due to the animation and graphics. They seemed to be top notch. Heroine #1 seemed to me to be a clone of Kaze,the dark hero with the strange gun in Final Fantasy Unlimited.

The final impression was that the writers had a number of ideas that they wanted to put in, but they just dumped the ideas in with little connection between them and, to my mind, no conclusion. It was sort of like reading the final stanza from T.S. Elliot's, ""The Hollow Men"" ""This is the way the world ends, Not with a bang, but with a whimper.""",1322524800,17,2538,4.16734693877551
