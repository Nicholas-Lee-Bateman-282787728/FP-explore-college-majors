5400512,3,B00A8OVJ3K,"5 Stallone movies on Blu-ray. These are region-free discs that must be imported. The picture is marginally better than the DVD versions because WB has simply copied the masters onto Blu-ray (no remastering). The audio is also average. My favorite is Demolition Man. Tango and Cash is also very entertaining. There isn't much in the way of bonus content. This works as a value pack so the price is right if you like at least two of these movies.

5400513,4,B00A8OVJ3K,"I ordered this Collection to watch a couple Stallone movies I hadn't seen before.
I am quite happy with my order. The movies are everything one would expect from a Stallone action movie.
The Blu-ray casing is compact, and the quality is very nice.

Its a good collection of Stallone movies, to add to ones collection... what would make it better would be having this be Collection 1 of ? and be able to get all the Stallone movies like this and have them all neatly organized together as a full collection.

I'd say, if you like Stallone movies... this is a nice choice!",1375574400,3,570,4.471153846153846

all the extras the Original WB cardboard dvd's are ported onto each disc  If that film had extras
Tango and Cash is bare bone

You get 5 very good Stallone action flicks

Cobra
Assasins
Tango and Cash
The Specialist
Demolition Man

The weakest film in this set is The Specialist but, you get Sharon Stone nude in a sex scene with Rocky ooh joy!
Really good Import box set with all the extras that are on the Region 1 blu ray's
A must have for Stallone fans and 1980's action fans

5400519,5,B00A8OVJ3K,"I bought this as a gift for my son who is a Stallone fan.  Some of the movies are not his favorites, but three he definitely liked.  It was worth the money.",1429833600,,156,3.84375
5400520,1,B00A8OVJ3K,"I just want to state that I'm a huge Sly Stallone fan so don't let my (1) star reflect his awesome work! The main reason for the one star is the the actual product.

The box looks great, but it contains two separate Blueray cases. Unfortunately when I opened the one holding (Cobra/Assassins/Tango & Cash) pieces of blue plastic fell on to my floor. Basically,  it has has broken hinges and two of three discs are loose in the case. This is upsetting because I don't want them to get scratched.

Fortunately the second set of discs containing (The Specialist/Demolition Man) don't come in a multi disc holder so there's not issue there.

I have yet to watched the discs so I'm hoping they are working. Will keep this open for further review.

Follow up to my review. The discs work fine, but the case containing Cobra is cracked on the right corner as well as the hinge being broken.

I emailed the seller to see if he would send a replacement case and the response was, ""sorry for the hassle, but you can send back the DVDS under Amazon's return policy'.

Of course I can send it back the DVDs, but what would be the hassle for him to send an empty replacement case. Having to repackage the DVDs and the cost of purchasing a shipment pouch isn't worth it. Going forward, I won't be buying from this (seller) and suggest you think twice as well. Looks like they sell used defective products.",1425772800,,1391,4.452755905511811
