728210,5,6303620000,"'Destiny' is a difficult movie to describe, and definitely an aquired taste (see other reviews below). A twisted blend of comedy, romance, action, and magic realism, it stands a lot of traditional movie images on their heads. Yes, Q. Tarantino has a small but pivotal role as Johnny Destiny, a character who changes many of the characters lives for the worse, then reappears to set things right in unexpected ways. Tarantino, however did NOT write or direct (director: Jack Barans), which leads to a sunnier and more romantic sort of movie. Nancy Travis shines as Lucille, an estranged love of main character Julian (Dylan McDermott). There are many great character parts, from James Belushi's 'Twerto', to Tracey Walters' philosophical desert rat, 'Pappy'. If you want something fresh, magical, unpredictable, and laugh-out-loud funny, I do recommend this highly (that's why the 5 stars). Look for McDermott's hilarious entrance on a motorcycle (about midway through the movie)...it makes me laugh every time!",1029110400,14,1010,5.31875
728211,4,6303620000,"Very underrated movie . A must se , if you like independent films . But I gave it only 4 stars , because Quentin Tarantino can do better ( and hi did ). I do love the music . I defenetly love the swiming pool thing . I wish , I can get one of those !( Let me know , if you have one available ).
  Very good actors selection , what is good . But it is bad at same time - you can tell , mr. Tarantino was thinking Hollywood , while making this one .
  It does take place in Vegas , what is good - I love Vegas ( you wrong - I live here ).
  One romantic idiot just got out of jail ( they still looking for him ) . Got lucky to get a ride in the middle of the desert ( in the car , which looks just like his . The one , that he been missing for a while ) . Got to Vegas to get his girl back , what is not easy - she is sleeping with "" Stardust "" boss . His partner in crime was waiting all this years for him in the beat up "" nowhere "" motel ( I,ll be right back - he sad , before the jail ).The big chunk of money was stolen from them ( the one , they stoled from somebody else ) . Just another Hollywood tipe of movie ? Yes ! BUT , no !
  The last seen is exellent ! The swiming pool is glowing... What is there ? The roads you never took ; the bets , you never placed ; the choices , you never made ! Guys ! Wait for me ! I,ll jump !",1028160000,3,1333,3.376237623762376
728212,4,6303620000,"Ofcourse there are a lot of people with a lot of different tastes when it comes to judging a movie. My opinion: I realy enjoyed this movie and I will look at it again. You don't always have to dissect a movie, sometimes you just have to watch it! For the people that don't know what to do: go and rent it first, I can understand that not everyone likes this kind of movies.

728213,1,6303620000,"This movie is jam packed with bad acting and faux hipness-usually the kind of project that Nicolas Cage's name would be all over. So where is Mr. Cage? His part has been stolen by a halfwit with a gigantic forehead. This  moron's name? Quentin Tarantion, hip director extraordinaire. Tarantino has  yet to realize that if you rape the audience enough with swill, they'll  abandon you (explaining Jackie Brown's poor domestic gross). I guess what  I'm trying to say here is that this movie is a piece of crap, its not even  enjoyable. If you're looking for a really bad movie, this is for you.  Otherwise, avoid at all costs.",930787200,,624,4.678899082568807
7855294,5,6303620000,"Really enjoyed this movie. The storyline doesn't make sense (at least not to me), but the movie itself is fun to watch. I watched this movie at least 10 times and still feel unclear on certain things as if the writing was lacking in clarity, but the artistry of the actors/actresses makes up for what is lacking in the script.",1474416000,,326,4.45
7855295,5,6303620000,"Loved the movie! I watched it close to 10 times already. Yes, the story line makes no sense, but the acting is great and it's one of those movies you watch when you don't care about whether any of it is realistic. Lots of action scenes with high-speed car chases, etc. Fun movie.",1466640000,,279,4.283018867924528

7855300,5,6303620000,"I have this movie on LaserDisc (remember that technology?) and would love to see it released on DVD.  This film is about second chances in life.  And the choices confronting people who have those chances.  Do they leap for love or ?  It is also about finding ""happily ever after"", which always means different things to different people. That second chances may derive from a ""fairy godfather"" aka Quentin Tarantino does not detract from the story line.  In fact, Quentin has a very small part of the story line.  This film is not about gambling (for money), although it is set in Las Vegas.  Jim Belushi does a great turn as a casino manager, deftly portraying the callousness of Vegas life as it pertains to women and their place in that life.  There is lots of subtle comedy in this film.  Not to mention romance.  I love the two leads - Dylan and Nancy.  Their screen chemistry was amazing.  After we watched this movie a few times, my husband and I suddenly realized that we KNEW the pink motel...and it is not in Las Vegas!  It is on San Fernando Road in the Los Angeles area and has been non-operational for the many years we lived in the area.  If you look closely during the motel scenes that face the road, you'll see some red flashing lights high in the air.  Those lights are the ""four stacks"".  They are a landmark that divides the airspace of two airports (Burbank to the south and Whiteman to the north).  We used to fly out of Whiteman.  When we realized those flashing lights were the 4 stacks, we also realized the location of the pink motel!  We drove by the motel the next time we went to Whiteman.  The pool...was empty...and had no crack!  Bummer.  Anyone that enjoys independent or foreign films will find this movie very entertaining and enjoyable.  And well worth the time.",1244332800,2,1798,4.515527950310559
7855301,5,6303620000,I LOVE THIS MOVIE!! It is just quirky enough for my sense of humor. It is also the first time I became a fan of Quintin Tarantino. If you like his warped sense of humor you will love this movie.,1222214400,,194,3.875
7855302,1,6303620000,"It's more like *1/2 then a Bomb because Quentin Tarantino's (Pulp Fiction, Resevoir Dogs, Desperado) laid back performance saves it from being a Bomb. After three years,  Dylan McDermott (Wonderland, Tv's The Practice, Cowboy Way) is out of prison and goes back to the last place he was...Vegas. On the way McDermott meets a cool cat named Destiny, played by Tarantino. He reunites with his friend James LeGros (Near Dark, Drugstore Cowboy, Tv's Ally McBeal) and he tries to win back the love of his life Nancy Travis (So I Married An Axe Murderer, Greedy) but she is seeing a pompous James Belushi (Tv's According To Jim, Joe Somebody, Florentine). LeGros tells McDermott and McDermott's father Pappy, played by Tracey Walter (Tv's Nash Bridges), about a man who appeared out from his pool and stole their money and that man is Destiny. Now the premise of Destiny is that he is a deity summoned from all the gambling in the world. You all get that? Well I did and I was like, ok what the hell!? All in all people this did have a lot of potential but gives off zero energy. McDermott flaunts and can barely do anything. LeGros and Travis are wasted and you know Travis didn't sing those songs. Tarantino gives this movie it's surviving *1/2 star rating. Also it survives from being a Bomb with the help of David Cross (Men In Black 1 and 2, Run Ronnie Run) and Bobcat Goldthwait (Shakes The Clown, Blow) but even their parts are non-fueled. Also starring Sarah Trigger (PCU) as Lucille's friend.",1092787200,2,1495,4.662878787878788
7855303,5,6303620000,"I am not a film scholar, and I don't work at watching films.  They are a form of entertainment and relaxation for me.  Perhaps this is what allowed me to enjoy this film so much.  I stumbled across this gem in the rough while checking out what was on cable (actually satellite), which allowed a no-expectations experience of the film, and I really liked it, particularly the use of color.  Off-beat and fresh are cliches for indie films, but they both apply to this charming and humorous movie.  The imagery was memorable, and the acting was just what this strange and entertaining film called for.  I am tempted to call aspects of this movie ""experimental"", but it is more accesible than most ""experimantal films,"" and, frankly more fun.  You don't have to work to enjoy it, you just have to relax.  It is a natural for DVD viewing, which allows for  experiencing this visually compelling, if somewhat weird, adventure in a low key setting with a glass or two of wine after a long day at work.  Watching Tarantino act in the film is another plus, for those who enjoy his directing and writing, as I do.  I am looking forward to its being released on DVD, and will certainly purchase it when it does.  Who even watches VHS any more?",1085702400,10,1232,4.524886877828054
