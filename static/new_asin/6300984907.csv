7808611,5,6300984907,I really wanted the DVD that would play in the USA. If you have one I would like to buy it,1444348800,,90,3.3333333333333335
7808612,1,6300984907,It arrived in Spanish and was of no use to us... my fault..... I am still trying to get it in English. We saw the movie in Theaters years ago and loved it...I will keep searching..... I got a very prompt refund.... ,1426896000,,215,4.119047619047619
7808613,5,6300984907,"First time I saw this I wondered if this was Billy Crystal's debut? If so, what a debut it was!
The humor is mainly offbeat and the situations are comical in a very surreal kind of way. It was the '70s and PC-ness was still a long way to go. Outstanding story from the word go. Lionel is the world's first man to ever become pregnant, he's dating a Slavic girl in his citizenship class, from a gypsy family; they treat him like he's a god. Lionel's mother is hysterical at times; she's quite emotional and quick to fly off the handle; there's a few references to pro-choice vs. pro-life; and sight gags galore.
I liked it a hundred times more than this cheesy movie I saw once about the same ""male pregnancy"" theme; I cannot remember the name of it; I think it came out in the '80s (I just know it was not Junior with Arnold Schwarzenegger.)
I wish movies today were as good as they were then. This one should be right up there with other cult classics like ""Little Shop of Horrors"" and ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"". Enjoy! RIP Joan Rivers you are missed.",1411862400,,1054,4.328282828282828

7808615,5,6300984907,"Great movie, funny, Wish it were more widely available.  Saw it in  the theater years ago, looked for it for years.  A prized possession now.",1368144000,,141,4.56
7808616,5,6300984907,"What can one say about Rabbit Test?  Hands down, this is one of the funniest movies I've ever seen.  I recall seeing this in the theatre when it first came out with some friends from high school.  I laughed so hard and so often I think I scared some people.  Joan Rivers is at her best!  There are countless hysterical moments but one of the best was the scene where the various clocks from different cities around the world are shown at Christmas time. You'll loose it when the camera pans to the Poland clock!  The scene with the pope is classic.  This movie is just great entertainment!",1292371200,,589,4.398148148148148
7808617,1,6300984907,"Why is it that religious intolerance is wrong if it is directed at the Jewish people; but when two Jewish people get together it's full steam ahead?

Joan Rivers does not surprise me; she is known for her poor taste both on the screen and off but Billy Crystal, who, I thought, was a brilliant comic and is far and away from the type of person who would want to make money by sneering at other people's religions. My uncle helped to empty the death camps as the US soldiers moved across Europe and to find that, not only Billy and Joan are not grateful (or even gracious about it) they have put together a movie to sneer at him and his silly religion and that tells me all I want to know about them.

I'm done.  The movie not only insults Christians but their fellow Jews who have behaved as good Americans.  I thought, at least, Billy knew that.",1277856000,4,846,4.26875
7808618,4,6300984907,"Wife, I, & her best girlfriend laughed ourselves silly at movie theater when this first came out - when we were in our late 30s, our kids were all in Jr or High School, and we weren't worried about Grandchildren yet!  There may not be a single stereotype or bad pregnancy joke ever made that Rabbit Test doesn't turn upside down, giving a new light and making you think.  It does take a keen sense of the ridiculous and ability to laugh at yourself.  I know the two ladies laughed with positively unholy glee at having the jokes turned against the male of the species....  Frankly, I couldn't help myself -- so did I.  As a satire junkie, this is one of my top picks ever, along with Space Balls, Young Frankenstein, Blazing Saddles, and (without the darkness) Dr Strangelove.",1271203200,,776,4.514285714285714
7808619,4,6300984907,"Back in the 70's Joan Rivers used to be a very funny stand up comedian.  She wrote and directed this movie, starring an
barely known Billy Crystal.  If you like humor that is off beat,
different, original and are into the 70's you should enjoy
this movie.  It makes you use your BRAIN, which is a nice
change of pace too.",1078444800,8,321,4.229508196721311
