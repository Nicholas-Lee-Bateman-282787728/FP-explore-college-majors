6979853,4,B00SCEGGK4,"I am a fan of director James Gray.  His work evokes memories of the movies of the late Sidney Lumet, who usually dealt with the gritty side of humanity and often made the city of New York a virtual character in his films.

Set in the early 1920s, THE IMMIGRANT follows Ewa (Marion Cotillard), a Polish refugee, starting at her arrival on Ellis Island.  The woman immediately draws the attention of the authorities when her sister is taken to the hospital, diagnosed with lung disease.  Under the threat of being deported back to her home country, Ewa accepts the kindness of Bruno (Joaquin Phoenix), a foreign aid worker who offers to get her into the city; find her work as a seamstress and a place to live.  Bruno, however, is a part time pimp and he slowly manipulates Ewa into a life of prostitution, which she accepts because it is the only way to raise enough money to care for her sister and get her off Ellis Island.

The situation becomes a bit more complicated after Ewa meets Orlando (Jeremy Renner), a charming stage magician and Brunos cousin.  Orlando seems to want to save Ewa from her unhappy, sordid life, but there is a dark, undefined history between he and his cousin, which often results in violence.

There is much to like and admire in THE IMMIGRANT.  Gray achieves a remarkable recreation of a time long past, and Ms. Cotillard delivers a haunting performance, perhaps the finest of her career.  Phoenix, Renner and the rest of the cast are also excellent.

My problem with the film is the screenplay by Gray and Ric Menello.  The first half of the picture works well, as Ewa does her best to survive in a world filled with betrayals.  However, once the Orlando character enters the narrative, THE IMMIGRANT veers off into a new, more melodramatic direction and feels like an entirely different movie.  Though well played by Renner, his character is not well defined and we, as an audience, do not really understand his actions that lead to the storys climax.

The Blu-ray disc from Anchor Bay Entertainment includes audio commentary by James Gray, plus a featurette about the visual inspiration of the film.

6979855,3,B00SCEGGK4,"Is it a sin to want to survive, when I have done so many bad things?  Ewa (Cotillard) has just arrived from Poland and is waiting to be processed into America. While she is in line her sister is taken to the infirmary and she is told that the address she gave of her relatives isn't accurate and is selected for removal back to Poland. When Bruno Wise (Phoenix) saves her from deportation she is very grateful. He also offers her a job in order to raise money to get her sister free. What starts off as a happy arrangement soon changes when Ewa leans of what she has to do. I went into this movie wondering how a movie with this cast wasn't a major release. After about a half hour I had my answer, and by the end I wondered why they made this at all. The acting is terrific and is really the only reason to watch. The movie subject has been done many times but again the acting is what makes this seem better. As far as watching goes this is very slow moving and I found myself daydreaming a few times which caused me to lose focus as to what was going on. I found myself not caring that I missed some of it, and by the end I was glad it was done. Overall, a movie with amazing acting but a real struggle to sit through. For me anyway. I disappointingly give this a C.",1424995200,13,1269,4.055776892430279
6979856,2,B00SCEGGK4,"*** This review may contain spoilers ***

Until I heard that James Gray based ""The Immigrant"" on recollections of his grandparents, I would have guessed this was an adaptation of an old melodramatic play that might have played on Broadway circa 1925. Gray's setting is New York City in 1921. His protagonist, Polish immigrant ""Ewa,"" is just disembarking at Ellis Island when her sister, ""Magda,"" is scooped up by immigration officials and placed in quarantine as she has tuberculosis. Ewa (Marion Cotillard) is marked for deportation due to rumors that she was a woman of ""loose morals,"" on her passage to America.

Her potential savior appears in the form of ""Bruno"" (Joaquin Phoenix), an owner of a burlesque house, who also pimps out his girls to men of means. Bruno appears to be in cahoots with corrupt officials on Ellis Island and when he meets Ewa who speaks decent English, he scoops her up and makes her a part of his act.

Add in the neat early NYC 20s production design and we're ready for some possible excitement in the second act. Unfortunately Gray's ""Ewa"" can do nothing more than constantly bemoan her fate as a kept woman, regretting that she's unable to save her quarantined sister. The introduction of a love triangle as a second act, between Bruno and his magician cousin, ""Emil"" (Jeremy Renner), harks back to the old melodramas of yesteryear, and when Bruno stabs Emil to death out of jealousy over his affections for Ewa, it's hardly something to get excited about.

David Denby of ""The New Yorker,"" agrees that there's a lack of real passion in ""The Immigrant's"" second act: ""In this movie, Phoenix turns himself inside out, but Cotillard's reserved performance doesn't move us. Bruno advances in his confused way, Ewa resists, and, despite Jeremy Renner's flickering presence, the movie becomes dour and repetitive. Looking at them, you finally think, Enough! Life must be elsewhere.""

Claudia Puig, writing in USA Today, concurs that there's something very wishy-washy about Ewa: ""Meanwhile, Ewa is heartsick about being separated from her sister. Mostly what she conveys, however, is a not very credible passivity. She dutifully follows Bruno and believes him when he says he's the only one who can get her sister out of the infirmary. In other ways, she seems savvy and strong-willed, so it's hard to believe she can be so gullible.""

Puig also is troubled by Gray's inability to define Bruno's motivations: ""Phoenix chews the scenery as Bruno, a man who alternates between smarmy courtesy and ruthless menace. But he never feels like a credible character. It's unclear whether director James Gray wants audiences to see him as tragic or merely sleazy. Renner remains a baffling cipher. Is Emil truly besotted with Ewa or just embroiled in a lifelong rivalry with his cousin?""

James Kyle of the NY Post, also argues that Ewa's passivity contributes to the film's overall ennui: ""Ewa is a representative for all of the poor and immigrant women of the time: She's simply unable to create a path for herself, and the pudding-thick atmosphere and sickly gaslit haze conjured up by Gray enhance the sense of an existence that's closed and stuck. Unfortunately for the movie, its story line suffers from the same fate; she's such a passive figure that the movie is more frustrating than anything else.""

Act III features the rather sentimental transformation of Bruno into a semi-mensch. He insists during his farewell conversation with Ewa that he planned to give all the money he had earned as a burlesque impresario to her, so that it could be used to bribe the Ellis Island officials and set Magda free. But since he's been relieved of his money by a coterie of nasty men in blue, it's not up to him to actually make Ewa happy. The deus ex machina of course is Ewa's aunt's philanthropy, somehow conveniently effected with little credible explanation (For the life of me, how is Ewa's aunt so easily able to come up with the money to give to Ewa, especially with her brute of a husband, watching over her?)

After all the staid machinations, Mr. Gray would like us to marvel at Bruno's transformation, despite his tawdry past. While he's about to go to the cops and confess to Emil's murder, at this point, do we really care? I think not.

Gray's film reminds one of a silent film from the 20s with added dialogue. It's a marvelous recreation of a bygone era replete with the heady atmosphere of those times. Nonetheless, Gray's decision to opt for a narrative that's as creaky as any forgotten potboiler from 1920s Broadway, it hardly bodes well for those of us who long for a little complexity when it comes to offerings on today's silver screen.",1424649600,7,4677,4.842302878598248
6979857,4,B00SCEGGK4,"The Immigrant somehow fell through the cracks this awards season. And that's a shame, because you'll be hard spent to find a more beautifully filmed or excellently acted period drama this year! The Immigrant tells the story of Ewa Cybulski (Marion Cotillard), a Polish immigrant who comes to America in the 20's with her sister Magda. Magda has tuberculosis, and the sisters are separated. Coming to Ewa's rescue is the seemingly charming Bruno (Joaquin Phoenix), a mysterious man with an odious job.

The Immigrant might sound depressing, and it's certainly not upbeat. It's not fast-paced either, but a calm and slow look into the lives of good people who fall into misfortune. At the center of the film is the beautiful Marion Cotillard, with another subtle and powerful performance that continues her winning streak of movies. In the wings are Joaquin Phoenix, daring and brilliant as ever, and Jeremy Renner, playing the closest thing this film has to a nice guy in Orlando the Magician.

When coupled with the great Darius Khondij's (Amour, Midnight in Paris) rich, warm, and lavish cinematography, sumptuous costumes, and a period-real recreation of the bustling, dirty, grey streets of New York, The Immigrant becomes both technically superb and emotionally satisfying. If you're looking for a well-acted film with subtle characters, realistic plots, and moving drama, try The Immigrant. 4 out of 5 immigrants!",1422489600,15,1418,5.214912280701754
6979858,4,B00SCEGGK4,"You might be surprised to learn that prejudice against immigrants isn't anything new.  This film, set in 1921 shortly after the end of WW I, tells the story of Ewa Cybulska (Oscar winner Marion Cotillard), who along with her sister, Magda (Angela Sarafyan) left Poland after their parents were killed by Cossacks.  Arriving at Ellis Island, Magda is quarantined, displaying a severe cough, so Ewa must go it alone.  The sisters were to be met by their aunt (Maja Wampuszyc) and uncle (Ilia Volok), but they were a no-show.  With no legal address, no sponsor and Ewa a single woman of alleged questionable morals, she is set to be returned to Poland.

Bruno Weiss (Joaquin Phoenix) however intervenes and she goes with him back to the city.  Ewas suspicions of what Bruno expects of her are valid.  Bruno runs a burlesque show, stocked with girls hes helped on the island.  In addition to baring some skin on stage, the ladies are expected to provide comfort to various clientele.  At first, Ewa rejects Brunos business proposals, but her main focus is to retrieve Magda who is undergoing medical treatment on the island.  Needing money, she eventually relents.

The film is directed by James Gray (We Own The Night) who also co-wrote the script (with Richard Menello) and Ewas part specifically for Ms. Cotillard.  He has a good eye for the look of 1920s New York with the camera set for a darkened tint of sepia for much of the movie.  The part of Bruno seemed a bit far-fetched to me.  At times hes a well-connected man who can get things done.  At other times, hes just low-life fodder for the police to kick around.  And while Bruno has feelings for Ewa, he never acts on them and in fact encourages her into prostitution.  Phoenix is terrific in the role however.

Brunos cousin, Emil (Jeremy Renner) arrives midway through the film to provide a romantic alternative for Ewas attention.  The film is held together by Cotillards performance.  She strikes a good balance of a woman conflicted by her religion and moral compass with that of a woman selling her body for a greater good.  Marion Cotillard rarely disappoints and she doesnt here.  She even learned to speak Polish, which she does in several scenes.  Im not sure if Gray was looking for a dramatic set piece or an early strike for a womans freedom.  He seemed at odds.  Still, a recommendation.",1449705600,,2359,4.709046454767726

Only for those who love to wallow in cinematic masochism. I turned it off after the first hour. I just could not face the second one as I could tell there would be no improvement. It has all of the trappings of an old Fanny Hurst soap opera with none of the camp fun. I can see why the film makers chose the gifted Ms Cotillard - after her (just as pointless) Piaf, she seems to have cornered the market for long suffering heroines. I thought this genre was as a dead as a doornail, but maybe the box office results tell the real story.",1432771200,2,788,4.404109589041096
6979872,4,B00SCEGGK4,"James Gray co-wrote (with Richard Menello who had worked with Gray on his other films and who died in 2013) and directed this slow moving but insightful film about the immigration topic that swirls through the media at the present time. His previous films - `Little Odessa', `We Own the Night, `The Yards' and `Two Lovers' are similar in feeling - dark, many repeated actors, coloration of the film product. But THE IMMIGRANT reflects the history of us all - all of us in the USA being immigrants in our lives or our histories - and as such it is very much like being given access to a personal scrapbook of survival in a new land.

The film opens in 1921 on Ellis Island. In search of a new start and the American dream, Ewa Cybulska (Marion Cotillard, superb!) and her sister Magda (Angela Sarafyan) sail to New York from their native Poland. When they reach Ellis Island, doctors discover that Magda is ill with tuberculosis, and the two women are separated. Ewa is released onto the mean streets of Manhattan while her sister is quarantined. Alone, with nowhere to turn and desperate to reunite with Magda, she quickly falls prey to Bruno (Joaquin Phoenix), a charming but wicked man who takes her in and forces her into prostitution. And then one day, Ewa encounters Bruno's cousin, the debonair magician Orlando (Jeremy Renner). He sweeps Ewa off her feet and quickly becomes her only chance to escape the nightmare in which she finds herself.

Bruno owns a men's club run by Belva (Dagmara Dominczyk) in which the girl's Bruno has `saved' perform burlesque for the drinking men. In many ways Bruno is a caring a kind man but has a manic streak that colors the loves of everyone around him. He is the epitome of the immigrants who took (take?) advantage of frighten and desperate immigrants for money and power.

The film is very slow, sort of a one-note song, but the acting is excellent and the cinematography by Darius Khondi captures the claustrophobic effect of living in secrecy and in less than suitable conditions. Though the film drags on a bit too long it does bring to our attention the trials of entering this country as an immigrant. Grady Harp, May 15",1432425600,,2171,4.663185378590079

6979875,4,B00SCEGGK4,"THE BEAUTY of James Grays period piece is matched only by its star, Marion Cotillard.

Gray reveals he wrote the script for her, admitting he didn't know what hed do if she rejected it. But Paris-born Cotillard of The Dark Knight Rises and Inception, who won an Oscar for La mme (2008), accepted the role of Polish immigrant Ewa Cybulska, traveling to America with her sister in hopes of a better life outside her war-torn country.

They are detained at Ellis Island. The sister is quarantined because of illness, but Ewa is scheduled for deportation because of her loose behavior aboard ship. Ewa is saved at the last minute by a sponsor, Bruno Weiss played by Joaquin Phoenix. That Bruno has a career other than tailoring is apparent from the start; hes a showman and a pimp.

That The Immigrant plays to early 20th century sensibilities as opposed to current norms of blatant sexuality and violence is part of the charm - and refreshing. In commentary, Gray discusses how the grain-heavy cinematography by Darius Khondji (Midnight in Paris, Se7en) will bring the first two Godfather movies to mind. Its part of the 1920s time period, he tells us, where rooms were lit by candle or gas light, and streets filled with dusty pollution. Clothing is dark, as we see in Brunos black coat and bowler hat, and Ewas dress. Stage costumes are elaborate and fanciful; make-up highlights Cotillards luminous eyes. Its this old world splendor that takes The Immigrant into fairy tale motif. We are more charmed than enthralled by Ewas struggle to save herself and her sister. She has the stamina and endurance of a Cinderella, without the talking animals. When Jeremy Renners Emil shows up, we expect him to be the prince that will save her  and thats when reality jumps in.

Whenever you're doing a period film, its important to try to adhere both to the accuracy of the period, but also to achieve a certain poetry, Gray says in the other bonus feature, The Visual Inspiration of The Immigrant, a featurette showcasing the work of photographer Lewis Hines, who took portraits of Ellis Island arrivals.

You can see the souls in their faces, Gray says of Hines work. It was not one of total, unabashed hope, but it was also not one of total misery. It was somber, restrained, hopeful, but also circumspect.

The Immigrant combines film with digital photography. Anchor Bays 1080p transfer presents old New York in a strong, classic film appearance. Earth tones dominate against a sepia wash; details are very good, but deliberately muted. As for sound, dialogue dominates with a romantic score by Chris Spelman in a DTS-HD Master Audio 5.1 immersive soundtrack. Ambient sound puts us realistically in-scene.

It took a long time for The Immigrant to get to Blu-ray in the U.S. The story is predictable, but engaging; characters and scenes will stay with you long after the end.   Kay Reynolds",1429574400,,2883,4.841463414634147
