8123620,5,B000FJHGE4,"This 2 hr. DVD is an excellent training tool for learning, relearning, or to get a better understanding of the eight empty hand katas of Isshinryu Karate. Each kata is shown six times (Walkthrough, Full power, Slow motion, Bunkai, Side view full power, and Side view slow motion). Of course, depending upon with whom you studied Isshinryu Karate there will always be some subtle differences and interpretations of the applications but I appreciated seeing the application of these differences in the Bunkai version of the kata. The video is professionally shot so the picture is excellent and viewing is always optimal. It was very helpful to also have the side view versions to help clarify any questions you might have. And the Bunkai version really helped to have a better understanding of the application - rather than just learning a series of movements. Plus the demonstrator, Master Kim Murray, was not only pleasant to watch, extremely knowledgeable but seemed to understand how to best teach others. My only criticisms are quite minor. (1) The first four kata versions for each kata were shot on a giant rose compass (N, S, E, W) about twenty feet in diameter. I guess because of the sun or a better background he starts each kata at a slightly different spot on the rose compass - somewhere close to or on the ""W"". This makes it a little difficult at times to see how his body position changes in relationship to its previous position - as he is not working off of any specific line in the compass. This is why many books have the demonstrator use a fixed cross to perform the kata on as you can get a much better understanding of how much the angle of the body is changing with each movement. (2) The side view katas are shot on the grass with no markings at all so you have the same issue as mentioned previously. However, even with the many available videos on youtube this far surpasses those in its clarity, different versions of the same kata by the same person, and by providing the full explanation or Bunkai for each kata. Well done!",1520899200,,2052,4.6401098901098905
