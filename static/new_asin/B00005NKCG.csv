7947273,4,B00005NKCG,"Gradually, as these six episodes progress, the silliness of the first two DVDs fades.  After all, Susano-oh has been reborn, and is being used to create a heaven on earth for the monster Arigami.  Getting rid of humanity at the same time, of course.  Kaede, Momiji's twin sister is no longer missing, but the original Kushinada is no longer on the side of the angels.  In fact, she is now Susano-oh's surrogate mother.
All this turmoil has sweeping effects on the TAC team, as plant life seems to go insane throughout Japan, first trees seem to be dying, and then there is a sudden wave of cherry blossom blooms.  Momiji has fallen in love with Kusanagi in a big way, but she seems preternaturally incapable of getting him to notice her as something other than a tool to control the Arigami. Kusanagi's is distracted by Kaede's reappearance, as well as his inability to stop the plans of Murakomo.
This sounds a bit more confusing than it actually is.  The plot has been fractured for so long that it is something of a shock to have to change gears.  But, with humanity's future and the Kushinada's life in the balance, the writers have begun to prune out the distractions.  In addition, Japanese legends begin to play more of a part, giving the story some roots.  Do not expect any great transformation of approach, but now the story is beginning to meet its original expectations.  Although Momiji remains a klutz no matter how serious the narrative.
Whether this change is soon enough remains to be seen.  Character development is still like pulling teeth.  Of all the characters, Sakura Yamazaki (the self-centered spiritualist) receives the most introspective attention.  Momiji lacks the dignity to be a truly tragic or dramatic figure, and gradually, the TAC team has been reduced to being bystanders, as inexplicable events multiply and only sheer luck or Kusanagi keep the world from ending prematurely.
The story remains entertaining, and the development of a serious thread promises a strong ending.  As I noted in the beginning, us folks in the United States are privileged to see anime of a very high level.  The truth is the 'The Blue Seed' is not bad at all; it simply falls far short of 'Evangelion' or 'Escaflowne.'  But pulp fiction certainly has its place in literature, and 'The Blue Seed' fills this role admirably.",1049673600,2,2336,4.81704260651629
7947274,4,B00005NKCG,"Any fan of the Blue Series should definately get the DVD over the VHS.  This volume contains the episodes 15-20 and includes both the Japanese w/ subtitle and English Dubbed versions of the show!  Considering single episodes on VHS are the same price, you just can't do wrong with the Blue Seed DVD.",1020816000,,299,4.622641509433962
7947275,5,B00005NKCG,"This review is not only about the last DVD release in the series, but also as a review of the entire series. I have never really been into Anime like most people, but this one caught my attention. Blue Seed is about a young girl who finds out that her humdrum life is not all it seems. Taking its cues from japanese mythology as well as other world religions, the story involves the coming of the auragami, a race of spirits who exist in the form of a 'blue seed', or mitama, and must possess a host in order to Take over Japan and the world. The only known way to stop them is to sacriface a female virgin from the Kushinada family. It turns out that, like all living things, certain energies are released that put the auragami to sleep. Momiji, age 15, must be sacrificed in order to save the world.
Luckily she has friends that want to find an alternative to killing a young girl. The fight for the world begins when the auragami try to kill Momiji while keeping her safely inside a Ceramic field, thus removing any threat to their existance. A team of scientists and military types known as the TAC Rescue Momiji, but not before An auragami nearly kills the girl outside the field. Without giving away too many details, Momiji winds up with a BLUE SEED implanted on her chest! Nuff sed.
I now have the entire series on DVD. It can be had on four discs, 26 episodes, With both english and japanese languages, as well as spanish! The clarity of the DVD format really shows here, not because the original material is so good, but because you can see the grain in the film, which in a strange way adds to the overall look of the series. The discs also include the now infamous ""Omake Theatres"", little humorous 'outtakes' if you will, some racy and some downright side splitting.
Another thing to mention about this series is the english voice acting. In the past, I have often hated the english dubbing of any movie, and in the first few episodes of Blue Seed the acting is at times not very good. But as the series goes on, it improves dramatically, and by the time I got to the last two discs I found that I prefered it over the original japanese. By the time you reach the last episode, the emotional quality of the dubbing is just dead on right, and at times you thing that maybe the series was made with english in mind.
This is the only Anime that I have ever cared enough about to own. As a total package of dvds, this cant be missed.",1013731200,3,2442,4.32244008714597
7947276,5,B00005NKCG,"This series is one of the most underrated animes that I know of. It doesn't have the best animation, art, characters, or storyline of any series, but the whole is definitely more than the sum of its parts here.  Blue Seed DVD 3 continues to work on the Momiji/Kusanagi vs. Aragami theme, but it also begins to develop Kunikida and Takeuchi.  Without spoiling, all I can say is that something happens which makes Kunikida wonder why the TAC is going to all of the trouble to spare a Japan that might not be worth sparing.  More aspects of Japanese culture and mythology are explored along the way, making for a disc that scores hits on several levels.  Highly recommended.",1001808000,,671,4.61344537815126
7947277,3,B00005NKCG,"While not a title i was initially looking forward to, Blue Seed has earned itself a spot in my anime collection. Still its not a title I hang for come it's release date, it serves as adequete padding when I need just one more item to complete an order. The story thus far is proving rather episodic but it has some good characters that helps to keep ones attention. I cant say i really love this series, but it does make for an entertaining nights viewing. The Omake (bomus extras) segments are hilarious and make for even better value when conisdering this order. Video quality is grainy and washed out, but this due to the age of this series (coming on close to 8years now). The animation quality on the whole however is great and very pleasing to the eye. With 6 episodes on this release it's a bargin for sure, and a worthwhile addition to anyones anime collection.",998784000,3,869,4.471698113207547
