8546855,5,B00A5P0UKU,"I really enjoyed this. It contained outstanding combat footage. Red Army cameramen were known for being risky and some would get killed or wounded in the process of filming combat footage. It was interesting seeing all the wreckage of German equipment surrounding Moscow. The Germans lost 1,400 tanks and 5,000 other vehicles attempting to take Moscow. That's not including the hundreds of thousands of men and other military equipment as well. It reminded me of the Highway of Death being a Desert Storm veteran. The film explains Soviet ingenuity as they utilized their entire population for the war. The women and children worked in the factories while the men took up arms. The film explained small details about certain villages that were liberated by the Soviets just outside of Moscow and atrocities committed by the Germans during their retreat. The Germans hung civilians and locked families inside their homes while burning them alive. It showed joyous Soviet population greeting Soviet soldiers as their villages were liberated. A powerful but political film as the importance of comrade Stalin was mentioned. Soviet generals Zhukov and Konev were also given due credit. I suggest this film for anyone who is interested in the eastern front during World War Two.",1429920000,5,1273,5.184466019417476
