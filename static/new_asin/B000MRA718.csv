What they are is a sweet group of kids, who are in their home in the beginning of the video, and then a character building situation comes up (normal real life scenario's) and the older sister in the group guides the younger ones by telling them how it reminds her of a story from the bible.

Then we are taken back in the day of that story, and we watch the story play out.  It is a full set, full cast, fully acted out like you were right there in the part of the story (ie: Samson, Tower of Babel, Noah, Joshua).  The stories are well done, and it isn't corny.  The kids, even our younger ones, were interested in watching.  Some scenes might be pretty realistic for kids of a young age, but even then, maybe not.  Ours watched the Samson one, and Delilah was dressed a little unmodest but not too inappropriately where we didn't wanted it to be seen, yet effectively so our daughter noticed and said ""see mommy, she doesn't love or honor God, Samson shouldn't have gone with her"".

After the story plays out, we are back in the room with the kids from the beginning, and they all participate in drawing correlations to their own life and highlighting the important moral/character lessons from the Bible Story.  Praise the Lord .. we loved these and we are starting to collect them all.

They are biblically sound and the children in the videos are so precious and the lessons are wonderful.  We didn't find anything distasteful or inappropriate and we were so pleasantly surprised.  We really just go them to take a shot in the dark and try some unknown Christ-Centered video to see if we could find something fun for our video library - WHAT A HIT!

Hope that helps :)",1263859200,4,1706,4.446945337620579
