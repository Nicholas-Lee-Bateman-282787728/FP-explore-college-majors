8173196,2,B00004YKRM,"'Angel and the Badman' is a very good western.  It is a very good western because it is character driven. The American west is simply the canvas on which its story is told.
  The 'Lazerlight' DVD of this fine film is of very poor quality.  DO NOT BUY IT.  There are better DVD versions available.",976406400,6,296,4.3090909090909095
