939881,4,6304756178,I got the VHS video from this concert and it was great but this DVD incredibly overpassed the audio experience. The concert is great and the video quality is great. I have a big screen TV and I felt like inside the concert.,995414400,5,223,4.209302325581396

940052,5,6304756178,"I didn't get a chance to go to this concert at Yankee Stadium. It had to be crazy there! A good mixture of hits from the Storm Front album, as well as, some of his older hits from other albums, closing out of course, with Pianoman, and everyone in the stadium singing along!",1378771200,,274,4.188679245283019
940053,5,6304756178,Watching this video concert dvd was just like being there. Billy Joel still has great stage presence and he sang all of his hits with some great backup musicians. It brought back some great memories.,1355788800,,199,4.714285714285714
940054,5,6304756178,I've always been a Billy Joel fan and have been collecting all performances that I can get my hands on.  This being one of them.  I really dig the energy the crowd brings and the song selection is perfect.  A must have for any Billy Joel fan.,1343174400,,242,4.1063829787234045
940055,3,6304756178,"Billy Joel in concert is almost always a special treat, that said this particular concert delivers something less.  I imagine the perfect Billy Joel concert might well be from a mid period period not unlike this historic show at Yankee Stadium.  By this time Billy had practically reached the peak of his power as witnessed by two successive nights selling out Yankee Stadium.  So what's not to like?  Well, something happened in the post production editing that seeks to preserve the manic like atmosphere yet ends up sabotauging an otherwise excellent show.  Billy has already moved on to a larger accompianment of sidemen that, sadly, only includes David Brown and Liberty Devito from his all-time classic lineup.  That isn't really a deal breaking let down as the musicians are all crack and basically approaching excessive perfection.  What I'm talking about the absolulely bipolar manic style of editing.

This concert can actually make you get a headache watching due to the ""over-the-top"" style of neurotic camera cut and paste editing with stuttering stop-action non-linear video.  There's about a dozen songs so it is definitely ""less"" from a complete ""best of"" set-list, but that really isn't the biggest letdown because most everything here song-wise works...it's simply the jumpy video that, IMHO, polarizes this from being a very good concert DVD.

For fans it is pretty much a must have since, as far as I know, it is the only Joel concert released on DVD, otherwise, hopefully, there will be a definitive ""Last Play at Shea"" DVD concert yet to be released.  Until then, if you love Billy Joel get this because it is crisp in sight and sound making it the best in-concert Joel available as of late 2010.  Recommended with reservations mentioned.",1287187200,2,1760,5.010309278350515
940056,1,6304756178,"I had purchased this before seeing the reviews.  Such a talented performer and
the DVD is ruined by the video.  Can't get by it, the video made this the worst concert I have ever seen.  This is text book ""how not to do it"".",1257811200,,223,4.0227272727272725
940057,3,6304756178,"I'm a huge Billy Joel fan...and my bias towards him and his live talents is the only reason I gave this thing 3 stars.  Viewed objectively as a production and ignoring my love of the man's music, I would only give this 2 stars at the most.  My chief gripes?  They are:

-  Length of the video/DVD:  C'mon, this was a full-blown concert, and we only get 12 songs from it?  Half a concert, at the most?  So, this should've been sold at half-price the moment it was released, right?!

-  As others have mentioned...the filming style and editing are atrocious.  I don't need jump-editing and motion sickness to feel the excitement of a live concert on-screen...especially with a performer like Joel, who is more than fun enough to watch on his own merits, without extraneous help from the cameras.

-  Song selection was a mixed bag, though this is directly tied to my first gripe about the length of the recorded performance.  I realize this was the Storm Front tour, and so it's reasonable to expect a fair number of songs from that album...but way too many of his older (and frankly, bigger) hits were missing.

The positives?  Yes, there are some, and they include:

-  Joel himself, of course...he's at the top of his game, in fine form.  Can't fault the man for his performance!

-  I personally don't mind the many camera shots of the band, although this wasn't my favorite incarnation (but that's a personal nit-pick...I miss seeing Russ Javors and the sadly departed Doug Stegmeyer on-stage)...though Crystal Taliefero is awesome!

-  While I wasn't thrilled with the song selection, it was great seeing Joel perform ""Miami 2017"" in this concert.

Overall, this DVD pales in comparison to Joel's ""Live from Long Island"" video, which is a much more definitive on-film concert performance with the ""classic"" incarnation of his band...why oh why has nobody released this performance on DVD yet???!!!",1134518400,13,1901,4.796296296296297
940058,4,6304756178,"One of my favorite artists of alltime is without a doubt Billy Joel. I've been a fan since I was a kid. One day, I realized I had nothing of his on dvd. So I went on amazon and found this dvd of his 1990 concert at Yankee Stadium.

When I went home, I watched it and noticed a few things. One was that the picture wasn't that great, the sound was awesome, and the show had to be severely edited. There had to be more than 12 songs performed at this show.

So why am I giving ""Live At Yankee Stadium"" four stars. Because it's the only Billy Joel concert available on dvd, and it's a pretty good concert at that. The set is largely devoted to the ""Storm Front"" album, which Billy was promoting at the time. While I would have personally preferred him trimming down the songs from the album from five to two (""We Didn't Start The Fire"" and ""I Go To Extremes"") to incorporate some older songs, the performances ae still worth it. The show's highlights are ""Scenes From An Italian Restaurant"", ""New York State Of Mind"" and ""Shout"". These are the best performances. There's also an annoying intro with various fans spouting out their love for Billy Joel.

In short, is this dvd perfect? No. Is it worth your time if you're a Billy Joel fan? Yes.",1125014400,9,1239,4.309012875536481
940059,1,6304756178,"I have seen Billy live many times and am a very big fan.  Having said this, I cannot watch this.  The bouncing, moving, pulsating, convulsive, (do I need to use more adjectives?) film is enough to throw anyone into a seizure.  Do yourself a favor and skip this DVD...or if you do need to purchase...turn off your television and listen to it over your stereo system...of course this defeats the purpose of buying a DVD but it's the only way you will be able to tolerate this...if you want to get a good concert DVD buy Sting Brand New Day tour...awesome...",1100908800,6,555,4.475247524752476
940137,5,6304756178,"In June 1990,while still promoting the STORM FRONT album,Billy Joel pleased thousands of his fans at Yankee Stadium. This video concert is a sequel to ""Live From Long Island"",one of his 1982 concerts,then promoting THE NYLON CURTAIN. In addition to the title track,STORM FRONT tracks that Billy performs are THAT'S NOT HER STYLE and WE DIDN'T START THE FIRE. NEW YORK STATE OF MIND was ideal for this concert since Yankee Stadium is located in New York. A MATTER OF TRUST,from THE BRIDGE,doesn't sound very much like the studio track and the live version from KOHUEPT. On MIAMI 2017(SEEN THE LIGHTS GO OUT ON BROADWAY),from TURNSTILES,he slightly alters one lyric. The line that goes ""before the Mafia,took over Mexico"" was changed to ""Jericho"". It sounds a lot like the live version on SONGS IN THE ATTIC. Billy begins the concert with the classic ""Take Me Out To The Ball Game"",with many of the audience members singing along. At this point in Billy's career,he was devoting most of his time to his then-wife supermodel Christie Brinkley and their then 4-year-old daughter,Alexa Ray. No one knew then that Alexa Ray would become a ""Piano Girl"" like her father. Great concert! My copy of this perormance is on VHS. I also have ""Live From Long Island"".",1084233600,2,1252,4.882629107981221

940139,4,6304756178,"I confess: I am not an MTV watcher, nor have I watched many concerts on TV (unless you want to count Evening at Pops).  So whether the camera handling or the stylistic virtues or lack thereof are not, sadly, in my purview.  For me, this DVD is meaningful because (a) it was a gift and (b) it allows me to recall how much I enjoyed seeing Billy in concert in Miami a few months before this performance at Yankee Stadium.
Billy Joel - Live at Yankee Stadium was shot during his 1990 Storm Front tour, so fittingly songs from that 1989 album are showcased.  The rest of the set list is devoted to ""classics"" such as ""Scenes From an Italian Restaurant"" and ""Miami 2017.""  The ""live"" part concludes, as did his Miami show in March of 1990, with a sing-along of ""Piano Man.""  (That, though, is NOT the final song in the DVD; the end titles are accompanied by ""And So It Goes,"" Joel's elegaic ode to doomed love. When I first watched this as an HBO special some years ago, that song just moved me to tears.)
While the choppy handheld camera angles and other '80s-vintage video conventions may distract other viewers, for me this gave me a better view of the concert than my crows' nest seat in the former Miami Heat basketball stadium.  I really enjoy watching this concert video on my DVD player, both for the sheer pleasure of listening to my favorite pop singer and the feeling of ""let's remember.""",1063324800,11,1394,4.447058823529412
940140,2,6304756178,"It's hard to believe that this 1990 concert was filmed before ""NYPD Blue"" came out. Somebody thought it would be a good idea to use jumpy hand-held cameras and jumpier 80s-style video effects. It's as if they didn't have faith in the music or the HUGE turnout at a giant ballpark to set the moment. You don't get a chance to watch anyone perform because the camera is jumping around all over the place.
But pump the audio from this DVD through your big speakers and turn the TV off. NOW you get it! This is great music performed at a great concert with a lot of energy! These are great songs performed by talented musicans. Billy puts on an awesome performance. ESPECIALLY on ""That's Not Her Style"" and ""Scenes From An Italian Resturant"" (two live favorites that don't appear on Joel's earlier live albums).
Some audiophiles complain that the mix is stereo instead of 5.1; what can you do? That's how it was recorded in 1990. It doesn't diminish the performances and I think the mix is great. Too often live music gets tinkered with to give it a huge sound, or worse the crowd noises (which always sound canned) get too much play.
I think the audio is definitely worth listening to, but this DVD is too expensive to buy it just for the audio. Some extras would have gone a long way towards sofening the blow.
My advice: If you're a Billy Joel fan and you have the money, this is worth buying. Especially if you're a fan who wants something good to listen to and you're a little tired of listening to ""Kouhept"" or ""Songs In The Attic"". But if you're buying something to watch, you'll be disappointed.
There was better camera work in ""The Blair Witch Project"".",1036972800,30,1658,4.493377483443709
940141,3,6304756178,"Billy's great here--and a Yankee stadium concert is an inspiration.
But the cheesy 80's video effects (Stop motion--strobing, eeech.)get so annoying as to make some of this concert unwatchable.
Enjoy Billy's music, but close your eyes!",1026950400,2,235,5.555555555555555
940142,5,6304756178,These are all his older classics. The photography is second to none. When he is on the piano some of the fade-outs are quite artistic. The sound quality is excellent. It is basically a concert at Yankee Stadium. The excitement of the crowd is evident throughout. This is an audience that he has in the palm of his hand. The picture quality is very good considering that it was probably shot on film.,1023667200,2,399,4.47945205479452
940143,3,6304756178,"This DVD is hit and miss.  The more of a fan you are of Joel, the more you will like it.  The sound isn't bad, but definately isn't all that phenomanal.  Its definately not hi-fi, but pretty good nonetheless.  The video quality is good, but the camera work is shoddy.  This is a billy joel video, not a billy joel and his band video.  The supporting band receives far to much camera time, and this takes away from the enjoyment of it, I would much prefer a more straight forward taping of joel at his piano, not so much cutting in and out, up and down, etc.  So the DVD itself has some flaws, but still makes for a good showing.  This is the only concert DVD of Billy Joel available, and while its not perfect or exhaustive, its a good dvd just the same, a good show, and beats having nothing of him.

940146,4,6304756178,"I bought this DVD as the first for the begining of my new DVD collection. I wasn't disapointed. I loved every minute of it, and the song selection was great. The only really disapointing factor was the camaras were a little wobbly from time to time, making the action unfocused and they didn't center enough on Billy Joel and his piano playing, but more on his band members.
