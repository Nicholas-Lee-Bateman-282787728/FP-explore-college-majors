2653317,5,B000I5YS82,"I have three dogs, all of whom had previous obedience training; however, after time went on, we became lackadaisical about their behavior, such as barking at bikers, kids and other dogs, they also jumped on guests coming into our home. Soon, one of our dogs started to growl at kids. Obviously, this was unacceptable. I purchased Beth's DVD and re-trained all three dogs, bringing them back to the basics. This increased their confidence, especially the ""growler."" She was, I learned, a fear-aggressive dog and before this became a huge issue, we were able to nip it in the bud using Beth's positive training techniques. What a huge difference in our family dynamic now! Our dog/caregiver bond has grown immensely. I truly believe that our dogs wanted the boundaries back that we had previously dropped. I highly recommend the It's PAWSible! DVD for any dog of any age. We have one shelter dog age 10 and two others we obtained as puppies, they are now 7 and 8! So it's never too late for training. Lastly, I would like to toss in that I had already purchased another dog training DVD that was cheaper - and I got what I paid for - it was confusing and difficult to navigate. I finally gave up and bought this one.",1161561600,46,1214,4.599078341013825
2653318,5,B000I5YS82,"As a University Professor, I appreciate very much the lecture style that Beth has in the video.  She reviews what has been done, previews what is to be done in the current lesson, gives an example of the finished product, then demonstrates the techniques in detail, and reviews the points of the lesson.

Then the is a preview of what the next lesson will be.  There no ambiguities.

I am a new dog owner and as such have much confusion.  But with Beth's instruction there is little left to question.

As far as the material goes, I am no expert but the techniques are working on my two dogs.",1158883200,33,592,4.385321100917431
2653319,4,B000I5YS82,THE PURCHASE WENT FINE--I JUST DIDN'T LIKE THE DVD TOO MUCH. iT DIDN'T COVER THE ESSENTIALS SUCH AS DOG TRAINING,1373241600,,112,4.65
2653320,5,B000I5YS82,My dogs are doing well with the help I recd from this video. It's the best that I've ever seen.,1370476800,,95,3.8
2653321,5,B000I5YS82,"Who knew?? I was going to take my dog to training at the pet store. I like this dvd because you can do the training in the dogs own surrounding, where he usually is. Who knew for even a dog owner with a busy schedule, learning the commands and tricks would be so easy?? It is recommended that you watch the dvd first and then go back and start applying. You don't need special dog treats, that's what is so wonderful. The trainer explains how a dog thinks, what to expect, it all makes so much sense. She uses ALL different types of dogs, from shelters some with no training which makes this dvd so much better!! My dog is a 1 yr choc lab rescue,full of energy. He's a good dog, just needs training. If I can do this, anyone can!!",1346284800,6,730,4.147887323943662
2653322,5,B000I5YS82,"Beth rocked this training video.  She's calm, humane, understanding of the dog's behavior and thought processes, and her tips really have helped to train my 3 month old puppy.  Other DVDs in dog training don't compare.  I just wish she had an advanced DVD on training.  I watch it over and over and am having fun as I teach my dog the tricks of the trade.  Thank you Beth.  A++ for you.  I particularly like the way she uses the techniques on dogs that have never been trained by her and troubleshoots the different reactions you could get.  Excellent buy.",1344816000,7,556,4.49
2653323,5,B000I5YS82,"We purchased this DVD and I can honestly tell you... we purchased several other training DVD's and books but NONE of them come near as clear and simple as this DVD.

The trainer shows you each command with 3 totally different dogs (trained, untrained and semi-trained) so she can show us how to handle various situations that arise. It is as if you are in a class with your dog.

We play the session we're working on.... watch her do it, then pause the DVD, try it on our pups about 4-5 times.... then resume playing DVD, on to next step.

It is MUCH cheaper than obedience classes elsewhere. Anyone can train their dog using this DVD.... honestly!",1285372800,8,648,4.47457627118644
2653324,1,B000I5YS82,"Ok I have not seen the DVD but I can tell you Beth is one of the worst trainers I have ever been to. Our dog did fine in the class.. he was very well trained from a previous class, but we found the class very disorganized. But I know at least 15 people that were told their dogs were ""untrainable"". One close friend the others were people I knew from walking at the local dog park. All the dogs were fine, my friends dog listen to me and his owners, he just was not that into doing ""tricks"". He was a husky, and huskys really are smart but maybe not as motivated to ""please"" as Beth was use to. The other peoples dogs I did not know as well but over all on walking with them at the park seemed to be normal dogs.

Anyway if you can not train this many dogs and tell the owners their dogs can not be trained what right do you have putting our a DVD on how to train dogs.

PS one person had Beth clip their dogs toe nails. This went went very very bad, to this day the dog will not let people touch his paws with out freaking out.",1279843200,15,1028,3.8904761904761904
2653325,5,B000I5YS82,I recommend this DVD for fantastic results in your puppy's trainging. Tremendous results in my puppies behavior and obedience.,1249689600,4,126,5.684210526315789
2653326,5,B000I5YS82,"It's Pawsible is an excellent, organized training course for basic commands. It walks you through a week-by-week schedule with training demonstrations of dogs who have not been previously trained. You need to listen to each segment several times because of the amount of information in them.

I used this course successfully with a 12-week old puppy. I continually reinforce these basic commands: Sit, Down, Stay, Leave It, and Come. There are others introduced in the DVD, but I stick with these few commands.

Note that this course does not address house training or behavior problems and was not designed to do so.",1247702400,11,617,5.03921568627451
2653327,4,B000I5YS82,"Lots of great information, good video quality. However, I would not recommend it for the $40+ it is being sold for on this site. I found elsewhere for about half the price. After having watched some the cheaper training videos out there (rented from my local library!) I just can't say that this video offers all that more information to make it worth paying 3x their price...",1226966400,26,376,4.626865671641791
2653328,5,B000I5YS82,"I have just added another member to our family (a new puppy) and since I have attended obedience classes before, I decided to do basic training on my own.  This DVD is an excellent source for doing that.  Beth explains everything very clearly and shows how to do it.  The DVD format is much better for people who are visual learners rather than reading a book.  I also like the format that she gives you several things to work on each week and you can skip to any lesson you want to review.  It is good that she uses several dogs of various backgrounds as examples, not just a well trained dog, so you can see different types of reactions you may get.  Great training aid for training your puppy or dog.",1217462400,17,703,4.287878787878788
8144163,5,B000I5YS82,"I bought this not long after getting my black lab puppy.  I wanted a program that was easy to follow but would have the results I was looking for.  I have to say this program is AWESOME!  Step by step instructions that were very easy to understand, not only for me but my puppy.  My dog Cooper picked up the skills immediately.  I would definitely recommend to anybody new to dog training or looking to try a different approach.  I also re-watched about a month ago to give my dog a ""refresher"" course.  Once again, worked flawlessly.  I have since given my copy to my sister to use with her dogs.",1473638400,,597,4.315315315315315

He immediately took a rude, definsive tone and ended up hanging up on me .  I called him back but he only became worse and hung up again. It really was `IMpawsible' to carry on a rational coversation with him so I let it go, along with the thirty dollars I'd paid them.

8144170,1,B000I5YS82,"To be clear, we had no problem with the seller of this dvd. The product was delivered quickly and with no problems. However, we did not find the dvd itself useful. There's a number to call to speak directly to the trainer who created this product at It's Pawsible!. When my husband called to ask if there was a dvd available that focused more on puppies and biting, he was called a rude name by the man who answered the phone. Then the man hung up on my husband. After repeated attempts to call back, my husband was summarily dismissed by another employee. We are unhappy with both this product and the It's Pawsible! staff. We will NOT buy any products from this company again. Furthermore, we can't understand how anyone would run a business this way.
