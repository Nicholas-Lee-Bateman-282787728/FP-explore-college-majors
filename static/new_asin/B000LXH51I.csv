8165032,1,B000LXH51I,"Worthless.  A good idea gone wrong by failing to explain anything beyond the very most
self explanatory features.  Fluff.  If you can read, save your money.  It is less informative than the manual.",1259625600,,197,4.878787878787879
8165033,4,B000LXH51I,"This DVD would be useful for new owners of the Garmin GPSmap 76 Cx/CSx as it covers all the basics of use and functions of the GPS. I have owned my Garmin 76 CSx for about 6 months now and know it fairly well. This DVD didn't teach me a lot I didn't already know by using it, but I am already familiar with GPS and its various functions as a whole. It would be good for someone new to GPS, or those less tech-savvy who like to learn from visual media rather than just the instruction manual. The production is basic but put together quite well and covers most topics in fair detail. Overall quite a reasonable guide, but perhaps only really useful to those not already familiar with GPS on its own.",1215043200,2,698,4.2164179104477615
