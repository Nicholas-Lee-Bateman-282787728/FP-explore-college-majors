The acting is variable but mostly very good with some top stars in supporting roles. This movie keeps the viewer engaged from the first scene to the last. There is also an impressive soundtrack by Korngold that adds significantly to the feel of this movie. Every movie lover should see this film. Its a must see.",1468627200,,479,4.853658536585366
