8603127,3,B00EA3RDYO,Lacks a lot of crucial songs. Why they didn't released a full concert I don't know...,1496880000,,85,4.375
8603128,5,B00EA3RDYO,"I ordered the 2 disc set and was a little surprised they left out a few of the more requested songs (Barbara Ann, etc.) Although their concert (I am told) consisted of twice as many songs as are on the first disc, it is overall a great concert and a must have for true Beach Boy fans. The second disc is mainly interviews and footage of sessions, but also very interesting with a few live concert segments thrown in.
There has been substantial improvements in sound and video recording and it shows in this dvd. Although the truly ""live sound"" like their Knebworth, England concert is missing. I'm not sure if that's good or bad.
Overall, I am pleased with my purchase and would recommend it for those that love the songs and harmony of America's Band, The Beach Boys!",1475280000,,768,4.492857142857143
