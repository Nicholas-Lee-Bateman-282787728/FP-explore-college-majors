8136165,3,B000H3LZNG,"College English professor Steve (Director Brett Kelly) plans to propose to his occult-loving, vegetarian girlfriend (and one time student) Amy (Caitlin Delaney). So after he accidentally kills her (in a ridiculous way), he chooses to bring her back with the help of the incantation books she conveniently owned to mixed results. They drive to an out of the way cabin in order to wait for her to 'get better'. But when his friends show up to party at the cabin, Steve has to keep them from figuring out that Amy's now a zombie. Fortunately, his friends seem to be as brain dead as Amy is all dead.

This silly little low-budget number was extremely stupid, yet I cracked a smile once or twice despite myself. Of the three Brett Kelly films I've seen thus far(the Bonesetter Returns, Final Curtain & The Feral Man), I feel it's safe to say that I enjoyed this one the most by far. Not to say that the film is flawless (it has many MANY of them) just that it had a fun atmosphere to it so I could overlook most of them.",1516492800,,1016,4.404255319148936

8136167,5,B000H3LZNG,"I loved the film for the humor - there was just a casual natural flow of it and it turned out to be a film I watched several times in several days, and plan to watch again when I want a zombie aspect, but lower key action and just a cute story line.  Reasonalby good effects for Indie (and better than many) but you'll either like it or not, based around the character humor and snarkiness (a good thing). I cannot say it has humor along the lines of FIDO, but it has its own brand.  Just depends where your funny bone runs. I don't regret having bought it, if that helps you.",1251936000,,576,4.088495575221239

1) ACTING: It was okay and everyone pretty much pulled their weight in the acting department. Granted, no one here will be winning an Oscar anytime soon, but there weren't any really bad performances. The lead actor playing Steve, needs to relax a little more as his nervousness holds back his comedic work.

2) ZOMBIES: They consisted of ""Romero's shamblers"" with some hiding / stalking abilities. The viewer rarely saw the zombies until they were actually attacking a person. This was all done at night, in a cabin, in the forest. A zombie would just pop out of nowhere and grab a passerby. The first zombie, Amy, was ""caught"" between the living and the undead, as she could minimally communicate that she was hungry, but she did die and was resurrected. The other zombies just went around doing what zombies do best, killing & eating! Nothing new and exciting brought to the zombie genre.

3) THE CAUSE: NOT a man-made virus, NOT an infection from outer space, this one was good old fashioned black magic! Not really voodoo, just some incantation from some century old book of magic that Amy happened to have.

4) PRODUCTION: Not filmed with a camcorder. (yay!) The majority of the movie was set at duck and night, so a lo of it was dark. Lighting was done pretty good to make sure the viewer could see what was happening. NO heavy metal music soundtrack.

5) SPECIAL EFFECTS: The usual bag of ""innerds"" from the local butcher was used for body parts and there was blood (at least during the day scenes) but at night, one really couldn't see any color. The zombies consisted of whiteface and darkly circled eyes, with minimal or no facial applications.

Overall, not a bad little zombie movie. The budgetary restrictions blatently show, and it would be interesting to see what the creators of this movie could do with some real
money. Not incredible, but an okay way to spend a little over an hour of your life. I would say just rent this one, and then rent 'Boy Eats Girl' to see what this movie would've been like with a real budget.
