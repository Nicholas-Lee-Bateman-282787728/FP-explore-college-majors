4659389,2,B005DEUEV8,"I love Shatner, but I could only watch the first 20 minutes of this.  His interviewing skills are terrible and he keeps interupting those he talks with questions that don't make any sense.  I know he is the writer and producer of this, but it wasn't very well planned out.  I hoped for something better from Shatner.",1319414400,8,316,4.508771929824562
4659390,5,B005DEUEV8,"I just finished watching this and I truly enjoyed it. Yes it had a lot of Shatner in it but come on, he was the first Captain. As suggested by Patrick Stewart, it was Shatner who the others had to live up to in creating their Captains.

I enjoyed the conversations, though his visit with Avery Brooks was a bit hard to watch. He seemed as if his mind was not completely together. His philosophical babble seemed reminiscent of someone with dementia. It might have been done purposely but there came a point when I saw the discomfort in Shatner's eyes so I knew it wasn't just me.

I think Patrick Stewart will never age, that Chris Pine was the perfect choice to play the young Kirk, and that all of them did a wonderful job at portraying the Captains of each of their series.

Shatner's Kirk was the first but Pine's Kirk won't be the last. There were four Captains in between them but in my heart I think there will be more.",1319241600,,926,4.310344827586207
4659391,5,B005DEUEV8,"STAR TREK content aside, this is a fine documentary, with the interviews interwoven thematically.  These conversations between actors who obviously admire and like each other go surprising, insightful places, and provide a glimpse into the creative mind, with stops along the way to explore the cost on an artist's personal life.  Objections to Shatner including his own story are absurd -- he is a captain, too, the first captain, from whom the others flow.  On one level this is Shatner's journey toward finally accepting that his legacy is first and foremost Captain Kirk, and on another an opportunity to spend time with some very interesting actors.  With humor and humanity, William Shatner gets his fellow captains to open up and explore their similarities and differences.",1319241600,2,780,5.216
4659392,1,B005DEUEV8,"The parts where the interviewed captains were talking were pretty cool, but the parts where Shatner constantly interrupted them and talked about himself instead were not.  I am a huge Star Trek fan of all the series, and I strongly disliked this documentary.  Sorry other actors being interviewed - this rating is not about you.",1319241600,15,328,4.945454545454545
4659393,5,B005DEUEV8,Very well done documentary.  There was a lot of heart in the film and put into the film.  I would highly recommend it to any fan of the series/movies.,1319068800,,150,4.137931034482759
4659394,3,B005DEUEV8,"""So many people have come up and said my life has changed as a result of seeing you work.""  A series of interviews of all 5 actors who have played a captain in ""Star Trek"".  This is going to be a different type of review. This is not so much a documentary as it is a series of ""60 minute"" type interviews with surprisingly deep questions asked by Shatner.  Questions ranging from how did you get the role to what happens when you die.  I was never a fan of the series and to that extent I did not enjoy this has much as a true fan would.  On the other hand the conversation he had with Patrick Stewert toward the end when he talks about getting over the embarassment of playing Captain Kirk was one of the most interesting conversations I have ever seen.  Overall, a true ""Trekkie"" will love this.  If you are like me and were never a fan you will still find this very interesting.  The fact that this is really only a series of interviews makes it hard to rate...so for this one I will not give a grade.

Would I watch again? - I don't think I will.",1316217600,10,1050,4.107843137254902
4659395,5,B005DEUEV8,"[I watched this on EpixHD and will certainly buy it once available on DVD]

Shatner is a living spectacle of his own accord.  He is controversy and entertainment wrapped into one.  And unfortunately, his package deal sometimes comes off a bit pompous and egotistical.  Few people really like someone who may revel in the enjoyment of his own voice.  Shatner at times does this, and yet... if you can get past that veneer, underneath you will find a very fascinating and earnest man.  He is someone who lucked into a legendary role that has made him supremely famous, something that for a long period he derided, yet eventually relented and embraced.  He is flawed, he knows he is flawed, but he admits it openly with sincerity.  I admire him now, more than I ever did.

""You either love him or you hate him,"" is how I've often heard Shatner described.  And in various on-line forums that I've had the pleasure to read, you'll see a wide range of polarized opinions about him.  Love him or hate him, he played a very important part in the world of Star Trek.  He is essential.

NOTE: There's a review of this movie up on the New York Times website, worth a read.  The author hit the nail on the head saying that Shatner's ""genial, relaxed self-absorption is a large part of his charm.""

So, ""The Captains""... Shatner is typical Shatner in some respects, and yet he is also so much better than that.  He usually behaves as alpha male, and yet he is ingratiating with his guests.  He loves to talk about himself, and yet he is also genuinely interested in others.  Making this film was a very humbling experience for Shatner and you can see it in the content.  There are a few rather blatant ego stroking moments that were no doubt purposefully left in after editing, as Shatner not only wrote but directed this production.

It's true that not all of these interviews are created equal.  Some of them are all too brief and miss some important aspects.  Some questions are raised in common across the guests and yet not all of them are fully heard.  But you know, this couldn't have been a perfect work.  It required a certain amount of liberty from the guests, who were allowed to influence the flow.  Of all the interviews, I found the one with Patrick Stewart the most touching.  The one with Avery Brooks the most endearing.  The one with Kate Mulgrew wonderfully surprising.  And the one with Scott Bakula delightfully honest.  There wasn't much to do with Chris Pine, because he's so young and doesn't have nearly enough experience to contribute on the same level.  But what we got was reasonably good.

The whole package deal is simply wonderful.  We get what appears to be very candid and revealing interviews with key actors from the Star Trek genre, hosted by a deeply colorful man.  This is the best off-screen Star Trek related material I've ever watched.  It touched me in many ways, despite having to overlook some of Shatner's self-fawning.  I will own it and watch it again and again, no doubt about it.  It's the perfect send-off for the ""old school"" Star Trek franchise.",1316131200,114,3084,4.615101289134438
4659396,3,B005DEUEV8,"This is a case of right idea, great interviews, but the interviewer wasn't really up to the challenge.  He is harsh in some areas and almost sugary at others.  If you buy this, buy it for the actor's thoughts on the subject.  The other captains do express some interesting insight to the concept of being a starship captain on Star Trek.  However, Shatner takes us into the existential and the esoteric at times and really goes not into the concept of being in the role and what did they bring to the role, or even how it effected them in their work or their lives, but into their thoughts on other topics that have little to do with Trek.

I do realize that sounds a bit fan boyish in terms of the ""let's stick to Star Trek"" but really, the title is ""The Captains"" therefore, that is what we are here to watch and learn from.  I gave it three stars because there are some good interview moments captured, but that has more to do with the photographer and the actor letting us in, than from the interviewing style of its director/producer.

I give Shatner credit for the concept, but he really needed someone else to help him with the execution.",1315958400,15,1145,4.398104265402844
4659397,5,B005DEUEV8,"I recently attended a 45th anniversary con for Star Trek.  William Shatner was one of many honored guests.  He talked about the movie.  One of the people who worked with him on this project, talked about the long hours and hard work everyone logged in.  I look forward to this movie.  William Shatner is a good interviewer.  He has the ability to get the actors talking and revealing some personal details about themselves.",1314316800,3,423,4.726027397260274
4659398,5,B005DEUEV8,I will be buying this DVD just because when William Shatner was at the Las Vegas Hillton for the Star Trek Convention last year he video taped the world record attempt for as most people in Star Trek costumes at one time Myself and a close friend are in the front row,1311638400,7,267,4.153846153846154
4659399,5,B005DEUEV8,"I'm a bit of a Trek nerd, so buying this was a no-brainer.  These people have a lot of chemistry together, so I enjoyed this, but it makes me somewhat sad that there couldn't have been a crossover with all of them.  They do seem to have genuine respect for each other as actors and they all of course are bound by the unique experience of being associated with such a prominent entertainment vehicle.

It's also ridiculously inexpensive.",1498953600,,437,4.576923076923077
4659400,3,B005DEUEV8,"I was really disappointed in this video for several reasons. Shatner never lets you forget he was the first captain in the Star Trek franchise. He spends at least half of the time talking about himself. The interviews are confusing (like what was up with arm wrestling Chris Pine instead of actually interviewing him?) Very noticeable was the awful and inappropriate (and so called) background music, which sometimes drowned out the interviewees. I think the most enjoyable interview was with Patrick Stewart; the others all left me wanting for more. I know this video was repackaged a few years later, so one could only hope that there were improvements.",1497312000,,655,5.018348623853211

4659412,3,B005DEUEV8,"A fun documentary if you are a big Star Trek fan.

4659413,5,B005DEUEV8,"There is something unique here. It spans generations and the commonality of these actors is the theme in the productions they star in; end of poverty, equal rights and tolerance of others.

4659415,5,B005DEUEV8,I was quite happy with this video  The Star Trek franchise has been a huge part of my life since the sixties.

4659416,5,B005DEUEV8,"I really enjoyed watching this! I loved the camaraderie and insightful, revealing and at times soul-baring conversations. Also of deep interest to me was what each actor learned about themselves and their realizations during and after the years they played their respective captain's role. If you're looking for something thoughtful to watch, this is it and thank you William Shatner for this documentary!",1475884800,,405,5.444444444444445
4659417,5,B005DEUEV8,"This film was fascinating. I'll tell you what I took away from it: those actors have lived rather sad lives. It makes me want to spend less time watching Star Trek and more time enjoying life. What I like about Star Trek is how it has opened my mind to so many possibilities and really made me think. So why not take that and use it real life, rather that spend an inordinate amount memorizing the small minutiae of all the series? Or worse yet, hero worshipping these interesting but deeply flawed people?

I'd rather be happy than be an great Trekkie!",1474156800,,553,4.421568627450981

4659426,4,B005DEUEV8,"Decent piece. Even though it does include interviews with the ""other"" Captains, Shatner is definitely driving the discussions. So, although you hear the opinions of the others, it's really on the subjects that Shatner wants to discuss.

4659451,5,B005DEUEV8,"This is an amusing, entertain,g revealing, honest, and slightly wacky documentary, in which Bill Shatner, the iconic figure of the ""Star Trek"" franchise, tries to do two things, and pretty much succeeds.

The first thing he tries to do is interview all the actors who have played commanding officers in the franchise to get their take on playing the role of captains of the Enterprise (or CO of Deep Space Nine or USS Voyager, to get technical), and their thoughts and feelings on the subject. What he winds up with are some memorable discussions and hilarious encounters...horseback riding with Scott Bakula, arm-wrestling with Chris Pine, piano-playing with Avery Brooks, and sitting in a box, waiting for Kate Mulgrew.

He also gets some serious discussion with Patrick Stewart about fame, Chris Pine about working with his father Bob Pine, Kate Mulgrew on the differences between stage and classical acting and TV and movies, Avery Brooks about philosophy. Shatner also reflects on the life of a young actor trying to make it in the theater in the 1950s.

The other half of the documentary is his appearance at a ""Star Trek"" convention, interacting with the world's craziest people, obsessive ""Star Trek"" fans. Now, I'm a huge fan of the original series, a good one of ""TNG,"" but haven't seen enough of the ""Voyager,"" ""Deep Space Nine,"" or ""Enterprise,"" to judge them. But I never wear ""Spock ears."" If I ever see a ""Star Trek"" movie, I wear the ballcap from the carrier.

So much for full disclosure.

But ""Star Trek"" fans are a devoted and wacky crew, with their obsessions over people in redshirts all getting killed, how Khan could have met Chekov if he wasn't on ""Enterprise"" at the time of that episode, and so on. I can understand why Shatner had trouble figuring out why his role in a show that only lasted three years and did poorly in the ratings would define him for life. After that stage set was struck, he had to go on earning a buck (""Barbary Coast,"" ""T.J. Hooker,"" ""Rescue 911""). He had trouble being seen everywhere as Captain James T. Kirk, born in Iowa, working in outer space, bopping green aliens. In real life, he was Bill Shatner, Jewish kid from Montreal, classical actor, father of two, horse and Doberman Pinscher breeder. Very separate lives.

In the documentary, as he talks with fans between talking with the captains, we can see how he begins to realize that being permanently identified as the ""Captain of the Enterprise"" is not such a bad thing in the long run. He goes from being the ""Get A Life"" punchline of the ""Saturday Night Live"" parody to being a genial father figure to an army of fans. It's a fascinating and warm transformation.

I would heartily recommend this to any ""Star Trek"" fan.",1429488000,8,2732,4.751054852320675

After viewing this I had a deeper appreciation of how other captains re-imagined the role. This documentary was funny and quite candid, personal stories are told, revelations made and a lot of laughs. Avery gets alotta flack on these comment boards but having done such a superb job on ds9 the man is entitled to be himself... Him and shatner seem to have the most fun of all.)

Love or hate him shatner really shows what he has become and through the people he has touched (besides famous celebs) his meeting with Captain Dave is the stuff that dreams are made of... True class.

Ironically, people that tend to like Star Trek so much I think tend to be a little more on the scientific side of thinking maybe?  These actors are all so talented, and I admire every one of them, but I cannot relate to all of the extra artistic talk.  As a Trek fan I like the CHARACTERS of the captains, and I just wasn't interested in the other acting stuff.",1427068800,,412,4.189873417721519

4659465,4,B005DEUEV8,"William Shatner does an outstanding job as host and chief interviewer of this documentary involving all the leading captains of all the various Star Trek series. However, Avery Brooks is a complete waste of time in his interview with Shatner because Brooks comes off as somewhat insane, or completely full of himself, or simply very rude. His behavior during the interview shows little respect for his audience. As a journalist, I would have thrown in the towel on that interview, or at the very least, kept Brooks' participation in the documentary to a minimum--hence the four-star rating instead of five. William Shatner is at his finest as he draws the best from his subjects and himself; I say that as one who never was a big fan of his. But after seeing this documentary, I realize he is quite the renaissance man and an outstanding actor who has much more in common with Patrick Stewart than I originally believed. Scott Bakula and Stewart come across as terrific, exceptionally talented, and very nice individuals. Kate Mulgrew is also very touching in her reflections on the burden of a successful actress who is striving to balance the demands of her profession with her family life.",1420243200,3,1192,4.876847290640394

I know many disagree with William Shatner's overbearing (sometimes to the point of being aggressive) style of conversation, and occasionally I find it jarring too. However, for this documentary, I was able to dismiss his style as his personal quirk and it wasn't that distracting for me, because all the interviewees, including a strong, no-nonsense Kate Mulgrew, held their own with aplomb. The conversations do appear to be heavily edited; I'd have LOVED to see the whole tte--ttes for them all - but I understand the time and space limitations for the DVD format.

If you have ever seen Bill Shatner's interview program, that is what happens. He does not shy away from asking the tough questions, drilling in for a real response from the heart, and revealing a bit of himself in the process.

Kate Mulgrew just seems tragic and self-consumed, and Avery Brooks has either gone insane or is high as a kite.  I can't believe there are people praising this exercise in weirdness.  Shatner's ego is as expansive as his waistline, and his views on women are so offensive and archaic that I can't watch the old Star Treks without thinking what an a-hole he is.  He actually tells Mulgrew that in real life women can't be leaders because they have too many hormones!  I'm a man, and as a man I can say that we have as many, if not more, hormones raging through our bodies as women.  How many female senators have been caught soliciting sex in public bathrooms or hiring prostitutes?  Shatner is ridiculous, and those reviewers trying to attach some depth and meaning to this documentary are even more ridiculous.  This is an immature and shallow man who's learned very little real truth in his life; his ""philosophical"" quest concerning life and death is simply an effort to make himself feel important.  This documentary just about wrecked Star Trek for me.  I have a new term: ""Shatnered.""  It's when something you like gets so undermined that the experience is ruined.  The somewhat idyllic Star Trek universe, with its ideals of equality, purpose and humanity, have been shattered (Shatnered).",1380153600,7,1453,4.885714285714286

I did have some reservations initially when I read the script [for the series finale ""What You Leave Behind""], because I thought they were going to really kill Sisko. I took that very literally, and asked the producers, ""Why are you killing Sisko?"" The Producers told me, ""Look we thought you'd be thrilled because we had made him a God!"" The difference, of course, is you have Sisko with another child on the way. You still have Sisko with a young man [Jake Sisko] trying to find his way, and you make him a God! That wasn't fair.""

Now decades later, and after attending several Star Trek Conventions, and working in movies with other Star Trek series' actors..... he has finally come around to fully embrass the fact that he will always be remembered best for his role as Captain Kirk..... As he sits down with each of the actors who have also played Captains in the different off shoot series of the original Star Trek --- TNG (Patrick Stewart - Captain Picard), DS9 (Avery Brooks - Captain Sisko), Voyager (Kate Mulgrew - Captain Janeway), Enterprise (Scott Bakula - Captain Archer) and the new cast Captain Kirk (Chris Pine) from the 2009 movie Star Trek & Star Trek Out of Darkness.... he helps us to discover what wonderful actors who know their acting craft well, brought all that they had learned to the role of Captain that they played for the series they were in..... and how each embrassed the continuation of bringing their particular Captain alive for the series......... all are talented and deeply involved in their craft and met the challenges, long hours, and commitment to bringing their Captain's character and particular show to the caliber of the original Star Trek series.

Still well worth a viewing.",1372636800,,339,4.666666666666667
4659543,3,B005DEUEV8,"First and foremost: if you're not a Star Trek fan and you're watching this documentary you'll most likely be baffled, confused, and possibly shocked at times by the tremendous egos in play here. This isn't so much a deep examination of the actors who portrayed the captains in each Star Trek series as it is a collection of anecdotes and reflections by those actors about their time spent working on their respective shows, what they took away from the experience, and a brief overview of their motivations to enter the acting profession and their subsequent careers.

This is primarily a personality piece and it's a vanity project in the most vain sense of the word. Don't get me wrong, I don't hate William Shatner. It's kind of impossible to. Part of his charm is the fact that he's so full of himself. It's to the point in his old age (82 if you can believe it) that he's become a parody of himself, but such to the point that he *understands* that he's a parody of himself, which only somehow manages to fuel his ego more and make him even *more* full of himself than he was to begin with. It's a self-perpetuating cycle, but one that manages to make him endearing instead of irritating. It's evident in his opening monologue when he lays out his plan to meet with each actor on a globe-trotting adventure and maybe learn something about himself along the way... Mmm-hmm...

The film follows Shatner as he meets with each actor who portrayed the lead role, the captain, in each Star Trek series. Sir Patrick Stewart gets the most face-time with Shatner and reveals some striking things about his approach to acting with respect to his other priorities in life, his regrets, and the sacrifices he's made to his art. Indeed it is Stewart's dedication and professionalism that he brought to the role of Picard that leads Shatner to re-evaluate his feelings of ""embarrassment"" at having played Kirk, seeing him as something of a ""lesser"" role after working with the Stratford Shakespeare Festival in his youth. Shatner's on-screen epiphany that Kirk is something to be proud of is doubtless supposed to be the personal revelation promised in the opening monologue, but it feels like ego-engineered pathos and it's one of the more uncomfortable aspects of the film. I'm sure it's tough for an actor to be so well-known for only one role, but judging by how often Shatner returns to Kirk and Star Trek in his later years (including his whole line of alternate-timeline ""Shatnerverse"" Star Trek novels which features a resurrected Captain Kirk adventuring alongside Captains Picard, Sisko and Janeway) it's hard to empathize with what seems like a manufactured plot device. And isn't this supposed to be a documentary?

In his interview with Kate Mulgrew, Shatner gets to touch on sacrifice again when she reminisces about her Voyager tenure as a single mother of two working impossible hours and not being able to be the mother she could have been. She also engages Shatner, in contrast to the schlocky shame/pride paraodx above, with a rather telling question of mortality. Turns out that Shatner is afraid of death and that he engages in work like making this film to help him feel more alive. This carries over into his discussions with Scott Bakula with whom he trades witticisms about, variously, the human soul, horses, and Broadway musicals. Out of all the captains, Bakula seems to be the most level-headed and down to earth. There are big egos and big personalities on display here and Scott just has that average Joe charm about him. Finally there is Chris Pine who is currently portraying Captain Kirk in the J.J. Abrams reboot of Star Trek. Oddly enough, he gets probably the smallest amount of time allotted despite playing a new version of Shatner's iconic character. There is some compare/contrast that occurs, but it seems like given the scope of what could have been discussed, Chris Pine gets a bit of a raw deal here.

I skipped over Avery Brooks for a reason. That reason is because Avery Books is crazy. His approach to answering William Shatner's interview-style questions is either to A) wax philosophical invoking some sort of quasi-beatnik urban spiritualism or, more often, B) grin steadily while playing some smooth jazz piano and riffing improvised lyrics with Shatner. It's one of the most bizarre things I've ever seen, but it's strangely harmonious. Brooks and Shatner are somehow, impossibly, on the same wavelength in these moments. I've only watched this on my Prime account, but I can only hope that on the DVD there might be extended footage from this ""interview"" because it's probably the best part of the film for sheer entertainment value; Avery is one cool cat.

The film feels a bit unfocused at times, but for the most part each captain gets their fair share. Aside from the interviews with the captains, some other Trek alumni make brief appearances including Jonathan Frakes, Robert Picardo, Rene Auberjonois, and others. Of special note is Christopher Plummer, a friend from early in Shatner's career who gets a decent Q&A. We also get some archival footage of the various incarnations of Trek and few snippets of a Star Trek convention where Shatner prowls around photobombing unsuspecting fans and calling every female cast member he meets ""the most beautiful woman ever to appear in Star Trek."" In some moments he seems to be offering casual disdain for the whole thing while in others he's gleefully feeding the frenzy as much for his own fulfillment as anyone else's. In the end this is a move that William Shatner made about himself and he brought the other captains along for a ride. It's not the deepest or even most honest documentary you're going to find about this franchise, but it's definitely a decent snapshot of its biggest personality. That, in and of itself, is something to see.

Final thoughts: Probably doesn't offer up anything hardcore Trekkies don't already know, but it's a nice supplement for the rest of us, especially those of us who want to know what goes on inside William Shatner's head these days.",1372464000,7,6074,4.863768115942029
4659544,3,B005DEUEV8,The most interesting aspect of the interviews is how much deference the Captains give to Shatner who often seems to be lost in his own delusions and spinning off on tangents that the other Captains try to follow but don't seem to want to.,1372032000,,238,4.431818181818182

1) It starts slow and seems aimless for the first 30 minutes or so, but it picks up steam as it gains focus.  The focus, which came as a surprise to me, is not Star Trek, but rather a better understanding of the actors involved.

2) The last hour is very interesting and I would actually recommend it to anyone who is a fan of the actors, regardless of whether you're a Star Trek fan or not.

4659550,5,B005DEUEV8,"Just finished watching on Amazon Prime.  Wow.  Incredibly moving and insightful look into the people who inhabited these roles.  Say what you want about Avery Brooks, his score was probably the best thing in this documentary.  They brought a lot to the roles and the roles took a lot from them personally.  I would love to see all six of them on stage together.  Shatner is incredible in his 80's.  Would that we could all live so long and retain our faculties, sense of humor, and creativity.  I think this is a great historical record and a fitting (if not too short, individually) tribute to these actors, who will not always be with us.  Captain Picard will always be my favorite, Avery Brooks is just an incredible actor and human being, Shatner is iconic, Kate Mulgrew actually made a female starship captain believable--no small task, and Scott Bakula was bravely honest, and a little too forgiving of the other elements of the show (outside of him and the cast) that didn't work.  Chris Pine has his whole life ahead of him, but it's not clear if he could really leave the indelible mark of the rest of them.  (Don't worry Scott, we will always love you for Quantum Leap!

I have watched completely is Star Trek the Next Generation and am a fan of Picard.  But
I was enchanted with the other captains.  Each of them spoke from the heart and shared what
the experience was like, the hours, the comraderie, the stories, their personal lives. I found
them to be extremely generous and kind. I was unaware that there had a been a female captain
as well and Kate was fantastic. She perhaps opened up the most about the things I was curious about
and I really enjoyed listening to her and could definitely relate to some of what she was saying.
Overall, very cool to watch. Also would recommend Trek Nation by Gene Roddenberry's son (which

For about an hour and a half, the viewer is treated to really meaningful conversations, that go surprisingly deep and reveal a lot about those talented performers.
The actors are very different from each other, and Mr. Shatner's interactions with each one do that justice. Patrick Stewart has profound reflections about the meaning of planing the role, Avery Brooks is wonderfully ""out there"" and provides lovely music throughout the film. Kate Mulgrew gets up close and personal, which is a delight. Scott Bakula is very accessible and candid. Chris Pine (still) deserves, and gets, less screen time, but it's good to have him there. And Shatner is Shatner - even more so here than in other productions we're used to seeing him in.
But there's more. There are great moments from a Las Vegas convention. There are other actors from almost all incarnations of Star Trek: Frakes, Picardo... and then there's Christopher Plummer, whose importance to William Shatner's own career is a wonderful discovery.",1360540800,2,1182,4.885572139303482
4659562,4,B005DEUEV8,"Engaging string of interviews as William Shatner of the original 'Star Trek' decides he would like to interview the other people that have played Captain in the other incarnations of 'Star Trek'. It is a journey of personal self discovery for himself.  He is originally from Canada and the CEO of Bombardier airplanes gives Shater a plane to use as the CEO was influenced by Shatner's Captain Kirk to get into the airplane industry.

Shatner flies to England to interview Sir Paterick Stewert, while flying there he reads over Stewert's bio and learns some things about Stewert.  When he gets to England he talks to Stewert about what he has learned. Shatner is a bit of a blustery interviewer, sometimes cutting the people off to talk about himself.

He talks to Avery Brooks as Brooks continues to play music.  Each captain has a brief clip of their work shown, perhaps ther could have been more of that.

He talks to Kate Mulgrew about the difficulty of being a parent and working so hard on the series.  There is mention that filming the show caused divorce and not good parenting, sad.

He talks to Scott Bakula about Bakula's singing and they do some horseback riding.

He arm wrestles Chris Pine. Through out all this it is somewhat of a journey for Shatner, he explains that he did not get much recognition during the original show's 3-year run and he was somewhat ashamed of the character as when people see him they call ""Beam me up, Scotty."" He shares about his acting in NYC and in Canada.

He attends a Star Trek convention and is treated like royalty, he does some stand-up and talks with a fan in a wheel chair, it appears to make the fan's day.

4659571,3,B005DEUEV8,"I wouldn't consider myself a Trekkie, but I am a Star Trek fan. I actually just got done spending a little over a year watching on Netflix every episode of Star Trek in the order that they came out. I even alternated between TNG/DS9 and DS9/VOY episodes in relation to when they aired alongside each other in real life and I worked in the movies as well. This seemed like a fitting capstone to the franchise before I move on.

There were some touching moments in this documentary. Even through Shatner's ego, I could see his vulnerability regarding his relationship with his larger-than-life character, Captain Kirk. He makes an honest attempt to bring the other actors into that light as well, but ultimately he kind of fails. It was hard to watch as the other actors started to get irritated with him and either talked over his interruptions or fell silent with a pained look on their face. I liked the Patrick Stewart and Scott Bakula interviews. The Chris Pine interview didn't get too much attention and the arm wrestling scene was just weird, but his role as Captain Kirk wasn't as significant as Shatner's anyway.

Totally uncomfortable and almost painful to watch were the Avery Brooks and Kate Mulgrew segments. Those two represented modern-day minority actors so their portrayals of Sisco and Janeway in positions of influence always topped my list of inspiring characters. So I was kind of disheartened to see that Avery Brooks seems to be suffering from some kind of mental illness ... or maybe he's just gotten VERY eccentric. Either way, not even Shatner seemed comfortable with the turns his interview took. The way Avery Brooks talked through most of his interview reminded me of the crazy babbling I find printed on the label of every Dr. Bronner's Castile Soap bottle I buy. That's not even to mention how Brooks kept breaking into loopy giggles and playing slightly disturbing chords on his piano the whole time.

The way Shatner treated Kate Mulgrew was just plain terrible and misogynistic. For a man who played a character from a time period where all of humanity has come together in a beautiful state of equality, for him to just come out and say that women were too hormonal to be good politicians, leaders, or captains was disgustingly sexist. What's worse, he badgered Mulgrew with these opinions until she was forced to kind of agree with him so he'd get off her case, even though other sources have always reported on her extreme pride in portraying the only female captain in Star Trek. Towards the end of the interview, she almost seemed close to tears. But who wouldn't be after someone basically insinuated that a woman will always make a poor leader (whether she be childbearing or menopausal) and is ultimately a bad mother for trying to have a career while raising kids ... whether it be a mother involved in acting or the fictional scenario of a starship captain.

I don't know. The documentary itself was surprisingly touching in some ways, and I'm glad I watched it, but I won't watch it again. It did its job for me. It was a conclusion to my time spent watching every episode and movie of Star Trek. As a fan but not a Trekkie, this enables me to give the franchise a loving pat and move on to something else to get into.",1353628800,41,3262,4.68760907504363

4659574,5,B005DEUEV8,"OK, don't know where all the anti-Shatner stuff is coming from.

Yes... Bill Shatner has a way of coming across as ""bigger than life""... or, perhaps, ""more self-serving than life"", in some people's eyes. OK, fine. I actually do get that.

But... I just watched this film, and it is absolutely NOT an example of that.

Mr. Shatner does, indeed, tell a few stories, in EXTREMELY abbreviated form. But about 99% of the the time, he lets the other ""captains"" tell _their_ stories.

Which is, actually, both a blessing and a curse... yes, I want to hear these stories of the ""other"" captains... in fact, the damn movie was TOO SHORT... these stories were too short. EACH ""captain of the Enterprise"" could easily fill an entire movie with their feelings and anecdotes, and I would, quite gladly, buy them all. It was a blessing, I suppose, that, despite reviews to the contrary, that Shatner dominates... except... he just doesn't. He doesn't at all. Which is the ""curse"" part. Who wouldn't want to hear Bill Shatner REALLY telling his tale of Star Trek... not the stories we've already heard... not the sanitized and (probably) altered and, even, mainly made-up stories, but the REAL stories?

Bill Shatner meets with the other actors who played captains on the various incarnations of Star Trek, and asks them insightful, meaningful questions... and those actors actually answer, in meaningful and insightful ways.

What more could you ask for?

I'll tell you what... bear with me...

It was GREAT. I LOVED it.

The one thing missing was... Shatner. Being just as insightful and open and as forthright as those he interviewed.

Shatner didn't dominate this, not at all. I do not know where those comments are coming from. I just watched this, literally. And Shatner was a part of it, of course. But this film was NOT, in any way way, a Shatner ego-trip.

Truly, the one thing missing from this film... the one ""captain of the Enterprise"" we DID NOT hear from, in this film, is.... the original Captain Kirk himself, William Shatner.

So... despite others intimations that this is a ""Shatner self-love"" film, I respectfully disagree completely. Far from being a ""Shatner ego-trip"", this was, truly, Shatner being an interviewer at his best.

And while he got some great, in a few cases truly inspired, responses from the other ""captains"", what was honestly missing was... the Shatner captain.

A ""Shatner-fest""? No. Simply, no. It isn't.

Perfect? No. Simply, no, it isn't.

Why? I'll tell you why. Three words: TOO DAMN SHORT.

You can not... you CAN not... adequately interview that many actors, all who have played such a pivotal role in such a time-honored series, in less than two hours... 12, 15, 20, maybe even 40 or 50 hours... MIGHT start to approach filling the need... maybe.

And we didn't even BEGIN to get William Shatner's views. That might take 10 or 20, or more, hours by itself, if an interviewer as insightful as Shatner himself was doing the interview.

But what made it to the final print of this film is... truly, quite excellent.

And... I'll say it again... far from being a ""Shatner ego-trip"" as others have said, this film is barely about Shatner at all. It just isn't. He's the interviewer -- and he stays, almost completely, in that role.

OK... way long review. Fine. Summary: EXTREMELY pleased with this, although it was too short and, in the process, gave NONE of the actors a proper stage for telling what we all want to hear. Anyone interested in this will be both thrilled and disappointed, because you get to see them all, and hear from them all, and none of them get a real chance to talk. But I do, totally, recommend it.

The biggest thing missing, other than about 10 hours per Captain (which we really do want to see and hear) is, we don't get to hear from SHATNER'S captain... a sore lack. The REAL original. The one EVERYTHING else is based on... and we hear very little, indeed, from him, in this film.",1349568000,4,3940,4.72953216374269

Learning about what these people have in common as well as their very real differences is very interesting as well as consistently entertaining. The talk with Christopher Plummer was another highlight.,1347062400,,410,4.788732394366197
4659578,5,B005DEUEV8,"The Captains is a surprisingly intimate portrait of the actors who play the captains in Star Trek. Unlike other documentaries, this isn't about the making of Star Trek, but rather about the actors themselves and what they went through to make the shows. I'm sure some of the drama was staged or preplanned, but much of it feels so real. At times, the actors really bare themselves discussing death, divorce, and how Star Trek took over their lives.

The camera follows Shatner as he interviews all of the other Star Trek captains. I thought the conversations with Patrick Stewart were the most profound. You really do get the sense that the actors come to an understanding of their legacies. Shatner's time with Avery Brooks was a bit disappoint - mostly spent performing beat poetry and listing to Brooks' meanderings. It's a bit of a shame because Sisko was my favorite captain. Shatner's interviews with Kate Mulgrew were at times almost confrontational, but this actually really brought out some personal moments from deep in her soul. Mulgrew talked with real regret about her struggles while on the show, and for the first time I actually felt bad for a famous actor and realized that she really did sacrifice a lot. There seemed to be a nice chemistry between Shatner and Jonathan Archer, and the discussion veered between Archer's respect for the original Star Trek and mutual reminiscences about divorce and life. Chris Pine makes a brief appearance, which was nice, but underutilized.

The scenes at the Star Trek conventions threaten to take away from the intimacy of the conversations, but they do give us a chance to see the stark contrast between Shatner's internal struggles and how he's managed to become a convention favorite. Shatner is graceful with fans and while I would have preferred more of the captains it turns out to be a nice change of pace.

Overall, this is a unique documentary and a must for Star Trek fans. I can't imagine anybody but Shatner getting these actors to open up so candidly on camera. It's far beyond anything you'll find on DVD extras. One thing is for sure - you'll never see the Star Trek captains the same way again!",1345939200,,2166,4.801608579088472
4659579,5,B005DEUEV8,"William Shatner has created a marvelous work of the heart.

4659580,2,B005DEUEV8,This isn't really about Star Trek.  It MIGHT have been interesting to listen to interviews with the actors portraying the captains but it wasn't.  Shatner interrupts his subjects regularly.  The Avery Brooks segment was odd.  The Kate Mulgrew segment was misogynistic.  It was awkward and uncomfortable when he put Patrick Stewart on the spot.  I did enjoy hearing Stewart and Shatner discuss their feelings about being forever linked as Star Trek captains but it wasn't worth watching for that part.,1341100800,5,500,5.1875
4659581,4,B005DEUEV8,"First, let me say this:  If William Shatner had directed ""Star Trek V: The Final Frontier"" with the poignance and depth that he applied to ""The Captains"", I imagine that ""STV:TFF"" would be considered one of the better of the Star Trek movies, if not one of the best.

This documentary, written and directed by Shatner, was considerably better than what I was expecting.  Although there are some scenes of Shatner doing some Star Trek stand-up at a convention (quite funny, by the way), and a few choice scenes from the various series and films, much of this documentary is Shatner interviewing those persons who enacted the roles that allowed Star Trek to move beyond Kirk's tenure in The Original Series.  Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Sir Patrick Stewart, and Scott Bakula represent the various series, and Chris Pine is also interviewed, chiming in with thoughts on what it's like to be Kirk.  Jonathan Frakes, who is now a Star Trek captain in his own right, having been given command of the ""Titan"" at the end of ""Star Trek: Nemesis"", is also on hand to put forth a few insightful comments.

The interviews get into the personal trials and tribulations of what being a Star Trek captain meant to each of the actors mentioned above.  Shatner the interviewer is really quite blunt, and pushes his subjects with very direct questions, clearly seeking raw, uncensored answers.

He asks Kate Mulgrew a few questions regarding being a woman in the Captain's chair that some might consider quite politically incorrect in nature; Mulgrew answers quite frankly, and in turn interviews Shatner about his own inner turmoils.  This is brilliant as the interviewer quickly becomes the interviewee, answering just as candidly as his subject, his heart just as much on his sleeve as hers.  Mulgrew clearly trusts Shatner, as he trusts her; there's obviously a mutual respect between these two.

Sir Patrick Stewart speaks about his own personal life, and the effect his tenure in ""The Next Generation"" had upon his marriages; one can plainly see anguish on his face as he relates how his marriages ended.  Avery Brooks puts forth much insight on the decisions made in order to take upon the role of captain, and the impact those decisions had upon his family, and Scott Bakula offers the same.

This documentary digs much more deeply into each actor's inner world and identity than what I was expecting; this was a most pleasant surprise.  Although quite serious at times, the tone of this film is not overly heavy-handed; director Shatner most skillfully varies the tone and pace of the film, allowing for various heart-to-hearts with each actor to therefore resonate more fully.

I can't say enough how pleasantly surprised I was at the quality of this film.  Shatner's conversation with Stewart, towards the end of the film, regarding how each would feel if their roles in ""Star Trek"" were the only work for which either of them were ever remembered, is a particularly poignant moment in a film replete with the same.  Although this entire documentary is, indirectly at least, a homage to the cultural impact of Star Trek, this particular conversation carries much weight; one can see that these two men are contemplating their lives' work, and finding that it is indeed worthy of great respect.  This reveals to us the unifying point of ""The Captains""; this film is very much fraught with the respect Shatner has come to have for Star Trek, and yet, most refreshingly, this respect is presented as an undertone of the film, perhaps not exactly subtle, but not demanding incessant attention either.

Clearly, Shatner has finally, after a few twists and turns along the way, come to truly love Star Trek.  Rather than telling the Trekers to ""Get a life!"" and ""Move out of your parent's basements!"", this film is Shatner's own celebration of his role in Star Trek, as well as his invitation to Trekers everywhere to deepen their understanding of what went into creating these various Star Trek series, at least from the point of view as seen from the captain's chair.  There's nary a dull moment to be had in these very moving interviews; even the most knowledgeable Trekker will come away feeling like he's discovered something new.

Shatner is a talented man, and his abilities as a director have developed such that he's now quite capable of putting forth a first-rate documentary.  I'd have given this film five stars, but regarding such lofty ratings, I apply them only to films like ""Casablanca"", ""Judgment at Nuremburg"" (look for a very youthful Shatner playing Spencer Tracy's assistant), and a very few other classics.  My point?  Well, whilst this might not be a classic in the most conventional sense of the films just mentioned, it's sure to be a classic for Trekers, and perhaps also for those seeking to better understand this historically significant phenomena that has become a cultural landmark.

All Trek is good, even the recent movie that had me a bit worried (oh, well, not Nemesis--but I don't acknowledge that one so...""it's all good"".)

Shatner travels around to meet with all the captains, including even the new ""young Kirk"", Chris Pine, and even throws a few others, like Jonathan Frakes, into the mix. You get to see Avery Brooks who seems, still, unhappy to discuss his involvement in the Trek world (but all too happy to play jazz piano and even due an impromtu ""song"" with Shatner), to Mulgrew's flirty confidence, to Patrick Stewart humbly taking pride in the work as Picard and being glad to know from fans that he'd actually impacted lives.

That this encounter with Stewart also markedly changed Shatner's feelings about Trek (we all know his infamous joking, ""Get a Life!"") was kind of touching, as was his effort to chat with these other captains.

4659589,5,B005DEUEV8,"The Captains is easily one of the most touching and thoughtful Star Trek documentaries that I ever have seen. I've seen many and none are this engaging

This is William Shatner's, now eighty years old,  reflective and very personal look into the lives of the people that signed on to be these characters and pushing each one to basically unload the luggage and examine the cost on their personal lives because of their commitment to the show.

Eighteen hour days, day after day, year after year, while either being married -- or being a single mom, as Kate Mulgrew was with two very young children, Having families that never see you except on weekends, while you were wrecked and sleeping it all off just to recoup and go again ... this is the story that each one of them recounts back.

I think the first thought that most people who watch this will come away with, is that Avery Brooks has gone crazy ... but that's not really the whole story, and I doubt he is.

I've written before about Avery Brooks and Star Trek and how badly he was treated by the Producers in the franchise and by Paramount as a whole themselves. Avery basically talks to Bill Shatner through his piano, obliquely. Everything Avery says is evasive and a bit removed from the topic. He often shoots Shatner's question directly back to him.

While it is disconcerting, it is saddening to see that he's just not ready to talk about his experiences as Ben Sisko yet. It's too bad, too, as a lot of time has passed since Deep Space Nine, but obviously for Avery Brooks, not enough time. He is, very clearly, going through some of the same pains that Shatner did for many years regarding Star Trek, his role as Captain, his career after Star Trek and Paramounts handling of him.

Bill Shatner admits that he always felt a sense of `Derision' regarding his role and time on Star Trek, the fans, people saying `beam me up,' his legacy and leaving this world being known as `Captain Kirk.' It bothered him to no end, and when people on the street would tell him, year after year, that Captain Kirk and Star Trek changed their life, he inwardly never believed it and just thought that these people were hyped up and caught in the make-believe mystical nature of Hollywood and nothing else.

Patrick Stewart's deep devotion to Star Trek for the length of the show and not wanting the project to fail, cost him much in his own personal life which he had to turn his back on - giving him long-standing regrets. He had told himself that the job and the craft was more important than his own family - no joke. Patrick Stewart's interview woven through this film is touching, gratifying and explanatory on so many levels. Yes, you need to be a Star Trek fan to appreciate this, but as always, the message and the lesson here is much greater than Star Trek itself.

Patrick Stewart's conversation regarding his regrets is worth watching this for that alone, as I have often submitted to people that if you don't have any regrets, then you really haven't lived your life fully. Regrets are a natural condition of relationships and caring for people. I'm sure you can finish this thought by yourself. Watch it, and you'll probably never misunderstand that point again or have your own peace on it.

Kate Mulgrew's story about her life, her children and the impossibility of trying to work those long days, deliver the highly developed techno-speak embedded in the show, and be real - all while worrying about her two young children that she never got to see - and then having to emulate a constant, strong leader is incredible and creates a sad ironic absurdity that you just wouldn't expect.

Scott Bakula and Chris Pine are also interviewed and equally interesting. Both are honest and sincere and giving to Shatner's questioning, which is at times interruptive. But by the time you become heavily entangled in Patrick Stewart's narrative, it easily becomes the main theme.

This isn't about how Star Trek has changed our lives or technology, but something more inward - how Star Trek changed the lives of these people who would be Captain of the Enterprise and what it was that they lost from it and also what they gained.

I was riveted during the entirety of this and didn't expect to be. I've seen so many silly Star Trek documentaries that I thought I could just put this on in the background and get on with my day. No. I literally got nothing done in the last two hours except watch this from beginning to end and do a bit of soul searching myself regarding my own commitments.

You don't have to watch this for anything more than mild entertainment, but the material is there for deeper consideration if you're open to it.

Worth watching, and quite possibly more than once.

His interviews were insightful, astonishingly honest, intelligent, and humorous.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie!

Does Mr. Shatner have a ""big ego""?  Perhaps.  But how could he not?  How could any one of us not have a big ego, if walking in his shoes?  The scenes from the Star Trek conventions, where he walks nonchalantly through the halls with people gasping and exclaiming in delight and, yes, awe, are very telling.  People were genuinely thrilled to see him and/or talk to him.

Sure, you might say that any Hollywood celebrity experiences this kind of adulation.  But what living celebrity created a universe of entertainment spanning 45 years, all based around his original depiction of a character?

4659592,4,B005DEUEV8,"You may call it a vanity project, a self-promotional piece, but THE CAPTAINS still offers up savory stuff for them STAR TREK fans. Whether you're a Trekker or a Trekkie or even just a casual fan, THE CAPTAINS is must-see viewing. But, yes, writer, director, and interviewer William Shatner does have a way of deflecting the conversation back to himself. It's probably some kind of superpower.

What Shatner did was call up all the actors who'd ever anchored a STAR TREK television series as a Starfleet captain - or, in Chris Pine's case, a feature film - and rallied them into being interview fodder for this documentary. So, c'mon, all the Trek captains being interviewed by THE captain himself? As a selling point, this doesn't come more huge. I found this documentary to be absorbing and at times funny and, at one point, baffling (*coughAveryBrookscough*).

Shatner should be creepy instead of uber-popular, but he's got a way of spinning things so that you end up liking him more. He's so genial in his self-promotion. He has this ability to toe the line between sincerity and pomposity. If you were wondering when the huckster in Shatner comes out, it doesn't take long. Within the first few minutes of the documentary he's preening in self-satisfaction as the executive of the aerospace company of the plane flying him to England (for the Patrick Stewart bit) informs him that, as a kid, he was inspired by Captain Kirk. Crows Shatner: ""He became an aeronautical engineer because of me!""

Some of the chit chat weigh more than others. Shatner and Chris Pine engaged in a wrestling match is fun to eyeball, but the meatiest moments are with the others who'd been behind the helm the longest. Obvious themes are addressed: STAR TREK's impact and enduring popularity, the toll the show took on the actors' personal lives, the resulting rocky marriages and relationships with their children. Avery Brooks, Kate Mulgrew, Scott Bakula, and Sir Patrick Stewart all succumb to a bit of soul searching and reminiscing.

Shatner unveils a different approach with each Captain. Naturally he was more flirty with Kate Mulgrew. He plays the ""us regular guys"" card with Pine and Bakula, and so effortlessly bonds with them. Bakula and Pine come across as very down-to-earth persons. Avery Brooks is one enigmatic and out there cat who spends much of the interview behind the piano, sometimes jazz riffing, mostly waxing existential. Every now and then Shatner would play along and improv a jazz song with him. You may laugh or roll your eyes at Shatner's efforts, but there's no doubting he was sincerely trying to sync with Brooks. But it was sometimes awkward.

The most emotional moments surface when Shatner sits with Patrick Stewart. The session with Sir Patrick would yield some truly poignant reveals from both gentlemen. As usual, Shatner turns the conversation back to himself as he expresses in length how he now feels about being perceived as Captain Kirk in this late stage of his career. For the most part, Stewart indulges him, although there seems to be this bemused, ""deer in the headlights"" expression on his face.

Shatner isn't hard to find. He saunters thru Star Trek conventions like the god he is, and the fans give him his just propers. There's a sequence here in which he approaches respective booths featuring Jeri Ryan, Sally Kellerman, and Grace Lee Whitney, three actresses who at one time or another had spent time on the franchise. Each time Shatner mugs for the camera and tells the world that each actress is the most beautiful girl in the history of STAR TREK. The thing is, I almost believe he means it each time.

too thrilling. Shatner, who has shown his prowess at producing an expertness while exploring a subject's mind (...on his recent interview series) just seems to let
the individual pull him along and mostly to places droll. As much a fan I am of Avery Brooks (and not for Deep Space 9- I am not much of a fan of any Berman Trek-

As a captain it was this bravado in the face of everything that endears him to us and it's amazing to see this core characteristic come through in real life as he interacts with the other Captains that have helmed one of the televisions most beloved shows.

""Interact"" is the best word to describe his encounters with Patrick Stewart, Avery Brooks, Scott Bakula, Kate Mulgrew and the newly Trek minted James T. Kirk; Chris Pine. It's not really interviews so much as it is Shatner asking questions and then interjecting as they speak when he deems it necessary to either correct their thinking or steer the conversation to something he is interested in. Truthfully Patrick Stewart gets the most uninterrupted time and rightfully so, as you will see.

What is most interesting to me is the personalities behind each of the captains. I grew up with Star Trek. I love Star Trek. I own every episode of Star Trek in all the franchises; even the animated series. These captains are often times larger than life and it's hard to imagine them without the thespian mask.

Patrick Stewart is by far the most introspective of them all. Without a doubt he has the best sense of himself. He speaks openly about regrets in his life, how he will be viewed after his death and how his perceptions have changed about hollywood, parenting, being most known for playing Picard as opposed to the brilliant career in the theatre and in other films. It was truly excellent to hear him speak not as an icon, but as a human.

Avery Brooks is another incredibly talented individual in both acting and singing. I won't give anything away but he is nothing like the emotionally conflicted yet confidant commander of DS9. Truthfully I get the the sense that if he had not found his passion for acting and music at such an early age he'd probably be the crazy guy you see at the local bus station. There is this jumbled fluidity to him that makes it appear as if he has his own personal rhythm in his head that only he can hear.

Kate Mulgrew was interesting as well. She spoke of parenting, time away from her children to film Voyager and her early years on stage and in film. I just wish Shatner let her speak more. Of all the captains I think she is most like Shatner in personality and style. It is obvious she has a bit of an ego as well, however it is what helps her project that confidence we've all come to expect to in a Star Trek captain.

Scott Bakula was also another interesting interview and perhaps pays the most homage to Shatner, which Shatner has little trouble accepting. He speaks briefly about his Quantum Leap days and how he found Star Trek in college. I enjoyed the short lived Enterprise franchise and it's obvious that Bakula is a scifi fan at heart. Again, I just wish Shatner would let him speak more without interrupting.

A slew of other actors from the various Trek franchises appear here an there in the documentary as well as footage of at least one convention.

From all of this William Shatner claims to have found peace and acceptance in being so closely associated with James T. Kirk. He is afraid of death, as he admits, but I get the sense that if he is telling the truth on the screen then he has reconciled that his epitaph will have to include Star Trek. There are few people who are so closely tied to Trek to be known posthumously for it; Roddenberry, Shatner, Nimoy, Stewart, Brookes and probably Jonathan Frakes and Brent Spiner as well. I'm sure there are a few more but those are the big ones.

In the end I enjoyed this. It somewhat centers around Star Trek but it's more about the personalities behind the characters... and William Shatner's shameless self promotion.

4659598,4,B005DEUEV8,"And that's only because for some peculiar reason - time, likely - Chris Pine got all of maybe 15 minutes of the screen.  Avery Brooks got a lot, and the majority of that was him singing and playing the piano, rather than the soul search we were promised.  The only one who was worth the time was Sir Patrick Stewart, who told truly heartfelt tales that are sure to give you deeper insight into possibly the most memorable captain aside from Kirk himself.  I especially was moved when he said that he was comfortable in his own company, that he'd made mistakes that led him to two divorces.  You see them on the screen and you assume that they must be living the life - indeed, Stewart's estate is an amazing one - but they're just mortal like you and me, and the concept of this video...deeper knowledge into the people that touched our hearts...was a great one.

There are also some guest appearances by some of the secondary talent - Robert Picardo (The Doctor on Voyager), Jonathan Frakes (Will Riker on TNG), and Dominic Keating (Malcom Reed from Enterprise) most notably, who give their commentary on what it was like to work with each captain.

The breakdown:

Sir Patrick Stewart: Shatner meets up with Stewart at his England estate.  Their discussion centers mostly around Stewart's extensive acting history, as well as what got him into it.  They also go very deep with ""what if"" discussions of the future and how they both felt about doing Star Trek when they saw the scripts.

Avery Brooks: Shatner meets Brooks at his home in New Jersey, where he learns more about Brooks' musical background and interests.  Brooks' part of the movie is really him communicating in song - whether you prefer that or not.  You don't really learn about him like you'd expect to.  It's difficult to follow him and Shatner.

Kate Mulgrew: Shatner meets Mulgrew in New York (I think), and they talk in a Broadway forum.  Mulgrew's is likely the most uncomfortable, because the tension between the two begins to rise during their chat about her challenges being the first female captain in a mostly male-dominated environment.  Both make equally good points, but you can cut the tension with a knife at times.

Scott Bakula: Shatner meets Bakula at his ranch in Canada (I think), and they talk about Bakula's attempt to recreate some of the chemistry found with Kirk, Spock and Bones...ultimately failing (his words which I agree with), but being proud to have been ""the first captain"".

Chris Pine: Shatner meets Pine at, of all places, a metal table out in front of Paramount, in Los Angeles.  This one is the most bizarre.  They arm wrestle.  No, I'm serious.  Pine doesn't get much time at all out of all of the captains, and there certainly is no soul searching.  It's mostly talk about Pine's family being actors.

The movie is well worth the purchase and a worthy addition to any collection.  My main complaint was Pine.  He was the one I wanted to know more about since he was basically thrust into the role of a young Captain Kirk - large shoes to fill.  Also, there were no commentary pieces from the likes of Zoe Saldana (Uhura), Zachary Quinto (Spock) or even the venerable Karl Urban (McCoy) from Enterprise.  It was like an afterthought, or a brief spot where they felt compelled to fit them in somewhere.  But I did enjoy learning more about Stewart, as in a lot of ways I modeled my personality around his, and I did take inspiration seeing him on the screen.",1326240000,6,3464,4.642036124794745

4659600,5,B005DEUEV8,"The movie starts out the way you think it will... but then it goes somewhere else entirely.

Like all who have seen this movie, I also could not help but notice William Shatner's ego, and how much of the documentary is exclusively about him and his journey.  But you know what?  In the end I am fine with that.  Perhaps the worst sin is just that the movie is mis-titled.  But it seems accidental.  Shatner started off with the premise of interviewing the other captains, but he let the conversations within lead the movie to a different place - a place very honest, very interesting, and very beautiful.

Much of the documentary is indeed that of a charming old actor reflecting on his life.  But you also get wonderful introspection from the other powerfully articulate actors he interviews.  Playing the Captain of a star ship is no small task, and this collection of strong personalities certainly do offer compelling outlooks.

I highly recommend this movie whether you are a Star Trek fan or not.  In fact, Star Trek fans may be somewhat disappointed by just how little ""Star Trek"" is actually featured.  This is a documentary about lives and careers, and Star Trek is simply the common thread between all those interviewed.",1325980800,,1230,4.75
4659601,4,B005DEUEV8,"I never ordered, nor received this DVD and gave it 3 stars in a previous review, which really wasn't fair since I hadn't actually seen the documentary.  I have since deleted that review.  So today, since I am a big fan of the original ST series and movies, I decided to watch this documentary on Netflix.  I found it enjoyable, interesting, touching in parts and very informative.  So many have gone into great detail in describing the interviews of the Captains, as well as a few other characters, and they've done such a great job that I certainly can't top them and won't even try.  I think that William Shatner did really well with the interviews.  I had no problem with Shatner's ego; he's an accomplished actor and human being who has earned the right to be proud of his life's accomplishments.  That's why I was so surprised to hear him say in this film that, for years, he was embarrassed about his role as Capt. Kirk, but now admits that he's very proud of it.

I would definitely recommend watching this documentary, but I'd suggest that you watch it on Netflix, or rent it first before deciding to buy it.  I say this because although I thoroughly enjoyed it, it's not one that I would buy because it's not one that I would watch again and again.  Enjoy!!!",1325980800,,1267,4.493449781659389
4659602,5,B005DEUEV8,"It is remarkable how the Star Trek franchise can re-invent itself so many times. A great deal of the actors and actresses that played a role in it, despite the fact of being good ones, are worldwide known just because of their work in the series. Of course, William Shatner could also be Boston Legals' Danny Crane, Patrick Stewart became X-Men's Professor Xavier but, unfortunately, we can not tell the same about Sisco or Janeway (especially here, in Brazil). We had heard about Bakula's Quantum Leap performance but this show did not make it in this part of the world. The documentary is simple made but well done, with informal interviews, conducted by an experienced Shatner, exploring how each one of the Captains entered the Start Trek's universe, how it affected their personnal and professional lives, the importance, according to each one of them, of being part of this unique and rewarding experience. A film that can not miss in your DVD collection, especially if you, like me, were seduced by Genne Roddenberry's adventure.
Have a good purchase and enjoy yourself!

4659603,5,B005DEUEV8,"William Shatner was never noted for his skills as an interviewer, but that's okay. In this documentary, he speaks on a subject of personal interest to him, the captaincy of Star Trek. His first interview with Patrick Stewart starts off a little rocky, with Shatner not used to another being the subject. But he quickly warms to the task and gets some great dialogues going with Stewart and the other Trek captains. You can see our hero get more and more comfortable in this new role, it suits him.

A good corollary to this documentary is the ""Shatner Rules"" book, made around the same time. But see this to join Scott Bakula, Kate Mulgrew, Avery Brooks, and of course Patrick Stewart as they go round and round with Shatner. It's a great journey of discovery, for us and them.

But what of Shatner himself? He visits Christopher Plummer (Star Trek VI), who regales him with some insights with observing his fellow Canadian theater actor over the years. Their careers only crisscrossed again with that final classic Star Trek movie. This is a great adventure to see.

Now we need a sequel: Shatner sitting down with the original Star Trek cast members, so they can tell him how they really feel. I imagine it would be cathartic for all involved. Just like this wonderful documentary!",1325203200,,1283,4.71875

Star Trek has deepened him and the other actors who took on this very hard work for our entertainment. I so enjoyed all of the honest interviews.  In my humble opinion it was worth every penny.  I've watched it 3 times and have passed it along to my son and his family. When they are done I'll pass it to other friends and relatives to enjoy.",1323734400,,575,4.181818181818182

This didn't feel staged. Instead, it felt like real people sharing themselves - both joys and sorrows. Yes, perhaps Bill Shatner began making this film as a self-reflection, but it ended up becoming something deeper and larger than that.

4659611,4,B005DEUEV8,"Like him or not, there's no denying the power of William Shatner.  Busier than ever at age 80, the former Captain James T. Kirk periodically continues his philosopic exploration of the Star Trek phenomenon.  Indeed, this is not the first video release in which Shatner delves deep into his most famous character (see also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Mind-Meld-Secrets-Behind-the-Voyage-of-a-Lifetime/dp/B00005V9HD/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Mind Meld - Secrets Behind the Voyage of a Lifetime</a>).  But with ""The Captains,"" he brings along 4 other iconic actors from the franchise and engages them some candid conversations.

As a longtime Star Trek fan, I always approach interview segments with the actors with a slight amount of trepidation.  The fact is, some of them have a tendency to repeat the same stories over and over.  Anyone who's ever sat through Nichelle Nichols' old chestnut of a story about how Martin Luther King Jr. talked her into not leaving the original series knows what I'm talking about.  Happily, this is mostly not the case with this documentary.  I only heard one story, from Patrick Stewart, that he used two years previously for the ""Captain's Summit"" Blu-ray disc.  The interviews with Kate Mulgrew and Scott Bakula are especially enlightening, although Mulgrew comes across far more pessimistic than the always-affable ""Enterprise"" star.  The film also puts Shatner face-to-face with the NEW Kirk, Chris Pine. Although their time together is limited, credit must be given to Pine for not engaging in anything resembling hero-worship, while Shatner shows some rare restraint by keeping his own ego in check.

Ever the armchair psychologist, Shatner isn't afraid to ask the big questions.  Bakula admits that Quantum Leap's strenuous schedule helped end his marriage; an almost-tearful Stewart confides that he always placed his career above family obligations, even at the expense of two wives.  Mulgrew speaks of the pressures of being a single mother while working 12+ hour days on the set of ""Star Trek Voyager.""

And then there's Avery Brooks (""Deep Space Nine""'s Capt. Sisko).  What to make of his extended odes to the rapturous wonders of jazz music (Brooks even non-answers several questions by tickling the ivories)?  Although his show remains the franchise's dark horse, Brooks himself is probably Shatner's heir apparent by virtue of his bug-eyed metaphysical countenance.  Seriously, there's nothing in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Trekkies/dp/0792158776/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Trekkies</a>&nbsp;to rival the unbridled weirdness of Brooks' interview segments.

""The Captains,"" even with a few flaws, ultimately represents a true time capsule for anyone in the future who might wonder just what all the fuss was about those ""Star Trek"" shows and movies.  As he did in ""Mind Meld,"" William Shatner sees Death coming for him...sooner rather than later.  And while this morbid tone may not sit easily with some viewers interested in light entertainment, I can't help but feel the whole experience was very therapeutic and even comforting to its maker.  As he is quick to point out, William Shatner has been entertaining audiences for over 50 years.  ""When I die...if people say, 'He was Captain Kirk,"" I'm O.K. with that,"" Shatner tell Patrick Stewart.  And if the end is truly drawing near, this labor of love is a fine tribute to a group of people and a Canadian actor to whom they owe no small measure of their success.",1321920000,3,3559,5.574349442379182
4659612,2,B005DEUEV8,"I am a huge Star Trek fan, but as it turns out, not so much of Shatner.

The ego that was blatantly apparent (and poorly concealed) was out of control. He interrupts the other Captains, with question after question. If he doesn't get the answer he wants, and he decides immediately if they aren't going to say what he wants to hear, then he asked another question and another, not letting them get a word in . . . unless, of course, they are praising him and kissing his you-know-what. And we are left with a show basically about him and his antics and how his role in star trek changed the world.

And, as a woman, I was particularly irritated with his treatment of Janeway. He basically focuses all his questions on her and how she couldn't do her job let alone be an effective captain or leader (and no woman could) because of her hormones. I was frustrated most other reviewers had no comment on the matter. Shatner basically forces Janeway into agreeing (and by some of her responses I'm not sure she even was agreeing but the scenes seemed to be cut together to look like she was) that women can't be effective leaders because of their raging hormones both when young and when menopausal. Really? Come one? I understand he did this whole thing himself, but show a little bit of manners, just a little. She was having to deal with being a SINGLE parent while filming Voyager, and the hardships of that don't have much to do with being female. That's a whole nother level of tough no matter who you are.

And then, he shows himself walking around the convention homing in on every pretty young girl in skimpy clothes, and telling every female star trek actress that they are the most beautiful woman in star trek, (although Janeway doesn't warrant such praise apparently) and getting his kisses. I know enough of Shatner not to be surprised, but he ruined what could have been a good show with his enormous ego, small tact and bad manners.",1321660800,12,1943,4.514204545454546
4659613,5,B005DEUEV8,"The single criticism is that I would have loved to heard some of what each actor saw as the virtues of the Captains they played, and perhaps, the vices. Although Stewart certainly seems to have played himself...as it seems all of these actors did. Perhaps being a Captain on Star Trek allows one to do that, as its such a personal sort of role.

However, wonderful insight into these actors, and the characters they played even when the information is not overt and spoon fed. And certainly, Patrick Stewart in a sense is given this wonderful ""thank you"" from Shatner for making clear that Star Trek was indeed ""great Art"" and worth doing.

Heroic Idealism is a lost concept on most television and film today. It's what makes the present Star Trek film ridiculously cool and...ridiculous...period.

Shatner knows this, and even the exchange between himself and Chris Pine was wonderful in what wasn't said. Shatner's slightly veiled, less than overt contempt (perhaps not for Pine directly, but what he represents) is amusing and contagious. And his utter respect for all the other actors is wonderful.

Avery's energy is also incredible and you can see the power in the man's eyes, and we are given the treat of listening to his music. Loved Bakula as well.

Someone else leveled the same old ""BIG EGO"" charge against Shatner in a previous review. In Latin, EGO means ""I"". Self-esteem. The SELF. The singular component that made America great, and her best television series - the sanctity of YOU above the collective (Borg, Klingon or otherwise). The one that showed us a way to our future, and made it happen.  All of this through the sheer force of will of a man who through his ahem fictional ""cowboy diplomacy"", womanizing and understanding of the value of Individualism, created a franchise that will likely last forever until it stops being Science Fiction and begins to turn into Science Reality...which I believe it has.

My thanks to Shatner for making this film and for his wonderful work in acting. And yes, my love to HIS EGO lol - where would any of us be without it. Probably watching more of Jar Jar I'm afraid.

He is a mirror to his alter ego (and not the kind from the Mirror Universe with a goatee...or was that Spock?)",1321142400,5,2240,4.725641025641026
4659614,5,B005DEUEV8,"Having read several reviews about this documentary, most of which suggested that it was simply a vehicle for William Shatner's enormous ego, I decided to give it a try anyway.

This film was fun, insightful, entertaining, a bit off-beat, but most importantly, it was engaging.

To my way of thinking, William Shatner, if anything, set his ""ego"" aside and demonstrated that at the end of the day, he's just one more person walking the globe trying to make sense of it all.  His interviews with the other ""captains"" are insightful and warm, and I found it quite fascinating to see how readily each of his subjects were able to open up about their experiences with not only the ""franchise"" that is Star Trek, but with their individual little pieces of it.  How the shows in which they participated impacted their careers and their personal lives.

If you're looking for a documentary that focuses on the characters these actors and actresses played within the Star Trek universe, then you will be quite disappointed.  Sure, some footage of the shows/movies is scattered around here and there, but that's not the point.  No.  The point of this film is to explore the people who played the roles of The Captains.  What they brought to their roles, how they approached their jobs, and also--and perhaps more importantly--what they took *from* their roles when all was said and done.

Shatner's ego?  I've been around enough show-biz people to know that everybody who's been around Hollywood for that long probably has a big ego.  But I think William Shatner demonstrated an incredible humanity in this film.  His interaction with each of the people he interviewed was genuine and I didn't catch a hint of condescension from him at any point.  ...well maybe a few times with Avery Brooks...but who could blame him for that?  I especially enjoyed footage of Shatner at a Star Trek Convention.  He was funny, lively, a bit wacky at times, and also showed a broad streak of compassion in a moment that had to be rather tough.

Bottom line:  This isn't a film about the tapestry that is Star Trek.  This is a film about a few actors and actresses with a common thread that binds them within the fabric of that tapestry, but more so within their own careers.

""Of all the films about Star Trek I have encountered within my travels, this was the most...human.""",1320969600,8,2347,4.7481481481481485
4659615,5,B005DEUEV8,"This is one of the most oddly paced documentaries I've seen.  The genius/madness/wackness of Shatner ground on me, initially, like nails on chalkboard, and his blatant interruptions of guests, not to mention somewhat horrendous ""beat-poetry"" with Avery, made me reach for my remote, finger hovering over the stop button.

But I came back to it, for what I would estimate as the last 3/4, and to say it redeemed itself would be an understatement.  Like any eccentric character, you have to warm up to Shatners antics, and look for the sincerity amongst the ego.  He'll interrupt Patrick Stewart, who is making a profound thought verbal, with some inconsequential question about the smallest of detail, yet tie it all together before its over with and give everyone enough latitude to truly make the interviews two-way.  This is a unique but highly interactive interview technique, and as I saw more of it, I grew to like it.

There are some moments, as mentioned before with Avery, that leave you chuckling uncomfortably, but the majority of interactions between Shatner and his fellow captains are earnest, heartfelt, painful, uplifting, and humorous.  Pine is the weakest link, but his time on this earth is a fraction of the others.  Scott Bakula's catharsis with Shatner about divorce was poignant, and Stewart's earnestness about the love of his craft left me misty-eyed.

Speaking of misty-eyed, the shots from the convention really reminded me what I think most of us that love Star Trek are in it for: the celebration of the ideals and universe that Roddenberry imagined and many have developed into the mythos we have today.  As quirky as Shatner is, he works the crowd with such expertise and mastery, you can see the mythical leader Kirk come out in what throughout most of the documentary appears a heavy-set, tired man.  Add in the tangible love from the fans, the electricity in the air, and the cameo by Stewart, and you feel like you are in the crowd.

Shatner wraps it all up with an insight that seems so basic to the rest of us, but is brutally honest. The self-discovery portion of this film punctuates the ending to what started as an odd journey and ends with him saying out loud what we all know:  if you are receptive to it, Star Trek can change your life.",1320883200,58,2279,4.783163265306122
4659616,4,B005DEUEV8,"The Captains is a documentary written and directed by William Shatner that follows the actor on in-depth interviews with the other five actors that have played captains on Star Trek. His mission was to discover what commonalities they all had and what brought them to the roles of their iconic characters.

Shatner (Captain Kirk of the original Star Trek) interviews Sir Patrick Stewart (Captain Picard of Star Trek: The Next Generation) at his home in London, Avery Brooks (Captain Sisko of Star Trek: Deep Space 9) in New Jersey, Kate Mulgrew (Captain Janeway of Star Trek: Voyager) in New York, and Scott Bakula (Captain Archer of Star Trek: Enterprise) and Chris Pine (Captain Kirk of the Star Trek 2009 film) in Los Angeles.

Each interview was unique to the actor's personalities and provides a thoughtful and poignant look at each actor. Shatner does a great job of tailoring each interview and creating a unique experience. His interview with Stewart is by far the most interesting, as the two actors share experiences and an obvious camaraderie. The interview with Brooks is unfortunately awkward and strange. Poor Shatner asks questions, and gets Brooks responding with nothing but piano music. It's both painful and humorous to watch. The interview with Mulgrew is both light-hearted and moving. Shatner's interview with Bakula is by far the most relaxed and down-to-earth, as Bakula has that easy-going personality that made him a joy to watch. And the interview with Pine was the shortest. Though Pine, of course, has only starred in one feature film so far, as opposed to all of the others in multiple seasons of television. I still would have liked to see more interaction between the two. After all, Pine is the one ""current"" captain continuing the franchise at the moment.

Since Shatner was the first, and arguably the most important captain in the Star Trek since he set the bar for all others following, I only wish he would have had someone specifically interviewing himself as well. Instead, he had to insert his point of view in his various interviews with all of the other actors, which made it feel like more of a conversation than interviews at times.

As a Star Trek fan, I found the documentary very interesting and well-developed. Shater has a unique perspective and can relate to each of them.  Dramatic, seemingly heartfelt, with plenty of humor - The Captains is an excellent behind-the-scenes look at some of Star Trek's most beloved actors.

Viewing a series all at once like that provides a different perspective from seeing the episodes on TV as they were broadcast.  This film, The Captains, happened to come out just as I finished my review of the entire franchise and so it was very welcome to me as a kind of closure.  Captains turned out better than I had expected from reading reviews.  Though quiet and unpretentious, the film is well planned and executed, focused, subtle in some ways, touching for trek fans.

One subtext of the film is the idea of the snapshot of the captain at each phase of life: the virile, buff, young Pine at 31 (""You are me 50 years ago"" remarks Shatner), Bakula and Mulgrew seen now in their mid fifties, Brooks at 63, Stewart at 71, and Shatner himself at 80. Seeing them arrayed like this as they are now and as they were during their star turn is a way to reflect on the stages of life. These actors provide a touchstone for my own life and I reflect on where I was in my journey (a high school student, a young married professional, a parent, etc) when I watched the various lead actors perform on Star Trek.

I thought the interviews went very well.  There is some semi-scripted, clowning lead-in with each participant and then Shatner sits down and chats with them in a leisurely fashion that feels quite spontaneous.  They all happily avoid the boilerplate stories often repeated in those making-of-trek type features.  They talked about acting, about the ups and downs of life, the important break of the starship captain role, the stresses on their marriages and families of the role, positives and negatives surrounding the sudden access of fame and recognition, life in general.  Often Shatner introduces a subject by talking about his experience and then elicits a response from the other captain.  I really enjoyed the segments with Avery Brooks.  The man is a very good musician.  Unlike other viewers I thought the interplay between Brooks and Shatner was great, including the singing.  I only wish the part with Brooks had been longer.

The clips from trek conventions are fun and work well to keep the pace of the film varied.",1320192000,3,2366,4.613365155131265
4659618,4,B005DEUEV8,"I just finished watching this doc' by William Shatner. First impressions: what a sweet film! Seriously! It takes an affectionate look back at the series, it's impact, and how it effected the lives of the five actors who sat in the Captains chair. One recurrent theme is the toll it took on their marriages. Three of the five actors went through painful divorces, during their tenure on their respective shows. Often they were told they'd be home by 6:30, which turned in to 9:30 with a morning wake up time of 5 am. Kate Mulgrew, who was a single mom at the time, experienced resentment from her children, who to this day won't watch the show on re-runs.

You learn something (a little bit) about the actor's life working on series television. You learn what it means in terms of financial security being cast in a series with such a large following, that it's fans are willing to support you by paying for the privilege of an autograph at conventions. You see the impact a form of popular entertainment can have on the lives of its fans and how the trajectory of a life can change, for both the actor and the audience.

You get the ""where are they now?"" Avery Brooks is a tenured professor of theater at some University. Kate Mulgrew is artistic director of some Theatre company in New York. Patrick Stewart is still doing theater. Chris Pine is arm wrestling William Shatner on a makeshift table in front of Paramont Studios and beating him 2 of 3 times...

It's not a great film. But for a trekkie... it's the right film. Beam me up, Scotty!",1319673600,3,1544,4.526881720430108

I find it particularly fascinating to hear them talk and the insights it gives into their degrees of agreement, or not, with the shows philosophy.

Of course the scumbag yuppies have complete control of Star Trek nowadays and have turned it into a tool of assimilation - sort of ironic...",1514505600,,457,4.7
