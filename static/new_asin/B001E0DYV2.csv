8295798,5,B001E0DYV2,"Rarely does a Documentary Filmmaker ever come across a subject as fascinating as Jonathon ""The Impaler"" Sharkey.

Minnesota had its share of celebrity politicians. Al Franken and  Jesse ""The Body"" Ventura are fine examples, but neither can light a candle to the Satanic Vampire who ran for Governor of Minnesota in 2006.

But as interesting as Sharkey's political career was, it was his personal life that ""sucked"" me in.

To me, the characters involved in his life were equally as interesting. I could tell you more, but that would ruin the story.

You can watch Impaler on Hulu, but I'd highly suggest picking this bad boy up for the extras and commentary.

It's worth the buy.

Also, if you watched Impaler and enjoyed it, you'll be happy to know that a follow up film is on the way.

It's called Impaled: Painfully Blunt!

8295799,1,B001E0DYV2,"I rarely write reviews, especially if they're bad.  But this is one of the worst docs I've ever seen.  the content was fascinating enough for me to sit through it, because let's face it...a wrestler running for office is a hilarious premise.  But the camera work, the direction, the production...all of it was crap and I'm annoyed at myself for watching this.  At one point, the camera man belched a loud BURP during an interview with the son of the main character, Jonathon.  n The camera is not held with a steady hand at all.  The sound volumes jump all over the place.  And there is more I could say that makes this movie an all around flop.  Thank GOD I saw it for free on hulu. com.  If I paid for this I'd be extremely disappointed.  I wouldn't pay for it if I were you, and I hope the makers of this movie stop making movies!  If you're responsible for this movie and  you see this, make sure and read it again!  I'm a producer and my stomach turns at the thought of your success.",1241222400,,988,4.247311827956989

8295801,5,B001E0DYV2,"Distinctly worthy of the high praise and good reviews. This is one of the most unique docs I've seen in a while. Nice and refreshing. Some parts can drag at times but they never last for too long. This was more or less a neutral movie. On occasion the director pull something to make us feel like we were along for the ride. When you see the impaler pole scene you will know what I am talking about. This has many story lines happening at once so it does get hard to keep up.

While this IS the most unique doc. I've seen in a while, just because it's unique doesn't make it the ""best"" necessary, but as of right now it is in my top 5 documentaries over the past year or so, or maybe not that high, top 10. I highly recommend it to just about anyone because it's nothing you expect it to be. To be honest I would have given this a 4 ranking if it wasn't for the terrific DVD commentary. i don't want to spoil anything but some of those ""boring parts"" they mention turn out to be some of the most important.",1231804800,,1006,4.055276381909548
