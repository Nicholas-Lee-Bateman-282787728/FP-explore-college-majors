3007910,5,B000XUF6BU,Best television I have ever seen. Perfect. Hilarious. Heart-breaking. Sexy. Even the minor characters turn in outstanding performances.,1202860800,2,135,6.555555555555555
3007911,5,B000XUF6BU,"""Slings and Arrows"" is a little Canadian show that aired on the Sundance Channel in the United States. It consists of three seasons of six episodes each. The show centers on the talented but troubled Geoffrey Tennant (played by Paul Gross of Due South fame), a former Shakespearean actor who had a breakdown in the middle of a performance of Hamlet seven years prior. After his old mentor, who runs the fictional Burbage Shakespeare Festival, dies, Tennant is called to be the interim artistic director; there he is faced with his former girlfriend, an over-commercialized festival, a pretentious and untalented director, his old nemesis, the Hamlet play... and his former mentor, who is appearing to him in the form of a ghost.

The show runs the gamut from comedy to serious, and the comedy comes in all shapes too: we have physical comedy, brilliant dialogue (Don McKellar, playing the pretentious director, has one of the best entrances I've seen: ""I am Darren Nichols, so deal with that!""), dark humor (Tennant's mentor is run over by a truck with the slogan ""Canada's Best Hams""), and absurd situations (an aging actress trying to explain why she deducted the cost of makeup and push-up bras on her tax returns). And there are also serious interludes, beautifully acted and well written.

The first season follows the production of Hamlet, with an untalented but famous young American actor playing the lead; the second season tackles Macbeth, with Tennant trying to get a talented actor who has played the role numerous times (Geraint Wyn Davies, whom you may remember from Forever Knight) who does not want to take risks or explore the role and is in danger of becoming a hack. In the third and final season, the company attempts to put up King Lear, and Tennant fires the actor originally hired and goes with an aging, heroine-addicted actor who may not survive the play. The company's travails mirror the issues of the plays, as the series goes from young (Hamlet) to mature (Macbeth), to old and on the way out (Lear).

You don't need to know or love Shakespeare, as the series has plenty to amuse and entertain you (and even make you think a bit), but it won't hurt if you do. Watch this show; it will be some of the best 18 hours you've spent in front of a television.",1202774400,,2281,4.740554156171284
3007912,5,B000XUF6BU,"Life in a famous Canadian theatre company: over-inflated egos, budgetary woes, opening-night disasters, sudden death, and Shakespeare.

Paul Gross is eccentrically charming, sexy and very funny as Geoffrey Tennant, a passionate actor who, after years of residency in a psychiatric ward, returns to the New Burbage Theatre Festival  (somewhere in middle-Canada) and by default, ends up as its artistic director. He must keep it all going while contending with self-absorbed actors, rehearsals, a manipulative company manager, guest directors and stars who really get on his nerves, feelings for his old flame who's still the company's female star, the bossy ghost of his dead predecessor, and his fears (which stem mostly from the fact that he really sees and argues with the ghost) that he himself is still crazy.

Among the co-stars are Rachel McAdams, Geraint Wyn Davies, Sarah Polley, Don McKellar, Colm Feore and Mark McKinney.

Watching makes me want to be a stage actor...",1202169600,16,978,5.290322580645161
3007913,5,B000XUF6BU,"So few people I know are aware of this wonderful show's existence.  My hope is that collecting all three seasons in a single DVD box set could lead to a whole new group of viewers.  What impressed me about the series is the way it provided absolutely first-rate popular entertainment in a relatively highbrow context.  It is funny.  There are romantic another other kinds of relationships that we as viewers come to care deeply about.  And we are introduced to a host of fascinating characters.  But at the same time there is some remarkably insightful discussion of Shakespeare.

You don't have to love Shakespeare to love this series, but you'll love it all the more if you do.  If you don't own copies of HAMLET, MCBETH, and KING LEAR, I would strongly encourage you to order copies of each along with this box set.  I reread each play as a result of seeing SLINGS AND ARROWS.  I suspect that a substantial number of viewers of the show have done so as well.

The stories revolve around a moderately successful theater festival in a fictitious Canadian town.  When Oliver Welles, the revered head of the festival, dies unexpectedly Geoffrey Tennant, a formerly celebrated actor who made his mark there, is asked to return as director.  Paul Gross (perhaps best known to those in the United States as the Mounty assigned to Chicago in the fun series DUE SOUTH) absolutely steals the series as Tennant.  I've seen a great deal of his work and this is hands down the best thing he has done.  Although he steals the show, his real life wife Martha Burns costars as the resident lead actress of the troupe and the former lover of Tennant.  The most surprising performance on the show might be that of Mark McKinney, formerly of KIDS IN THE HALL, who does a great job as the festival's business director.  The cast is bolstered by a number of superb supporting characters as well as several excellent guest stars.  Rachel McAdams was great on the show until Hollywood beckoned and she left the series after Season One.  Geraint Wyn Davies, who many will remember from the vampire TV series FOREVER KNIGHT, excelled in Season Two as famous Shakespearean recruited to play McBeth.  Sarah Polley (whose father was a regular on the series) is Season Three's Cordelia.  Celebrated Canadian Shakespearean actor William Hutt turns in an astonishing performance as Season Three's Lear.  But the funniest guest role is hands down that by Colm Feore, who plays a charlatan PR firm director.

This is just great TV and if you haven't seen this, you must.  This is the best completely unknown television series of the past several years.  I've pushed other little watched series on friends, like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but that wonderful series has several times the audience that SLINGS AND ARROWS had.  All you need to do to love it is to watch it.",1201996800,68,2833,4.7306122448979595
3007914,5,B000XUF6BU,"I bought the first season.  Now I'm under orders by three other members of my family to buy the complete series for them, and I'm definitely getting it for myself.  There aren't many movies, tv shows, or books that have me up and screaming cheers at the screen - Slings & Arrows had a whole room of viewers up and on their feet in delight.  Give yourself a treat.

I thought I'd never be able to see him as anything other then the Mountie from Due South but it never even entered my head when watching i would recommend anyone to watch this and like myself you don't have to be a theater buff to enjoy it's wonderfulness.

The series follows a Shakespeare company through three seasons, each focusing on whichever main Shakespeare work is being produced that year.

It will make you want to (re)read the plays. It is, like Shakespeare, both hilarious and deeply moving, even profound; amazing television. The acting is fabulous, especially the main character played by Paul Gross. Don't miss Rachel McAdams in an early role where she has a chance to show her real talent. The issues surrounding creativity and madness, art vs. commerce, the nature of love and questions of death are wonderfully juxtaposed in the theater company's shenanigans as parallels to their representation in the plays.",1451260800,,664,5.333333333333333

This preceded all of them -- on Canadian television over three seasons. It's the hilarious and often moving story of a mythical Canadian Shakespeare festival (think Stratford) and its staff, actors, directors, and managing director and especially the artistic director, played by Paul Gross. While it's wickedly funny, it's a revelation for anyone who doesn't ""get"" Shakespeare, or doesn't know much about the behind-the-scenes of the theater world. Contains great performance excerpts, especially of HAMLET (season one), MACBETH (season two), and KING LEAR (season three) -- hence this series which was designed to be three seasons follows the ""ages of man"" idea with youth, middle age, and old age.

3007980,5,B000XUF6BU,"First off: This is a fantastic show - One of my very favorites, up there with Northern Exposure.

But it seems there is some misconception about this Blu-Ray Set and the quality thereof.

So as a matter of Clarity let me be clear - Only Season One was shot In Standard Def and is upscaled for this Blu-Ray Set.  Seasons 2 and 3 were shot in High Def and so look quite nice on this Collection. To quote from Blu-Ray.com:

""Ay, there's the rub. The first season of Slings & Arrows was shot in standard definition and has been upscaled here into a 1080p/AVC-encoded presentation.

As you'd expect, the image is quite soft and even chunky at times, with no fine detail to speak of, frequent bouts of thick video noise, and black levels that are hazy and grayish. That said, this is the best the material can and will look given how it was shot, so I see no cause to complain. (The back of the case also clearly states that the first season is upscaled.)

Thankfully, though, the production switched to high definition for seasons two and three, and the picture improves dramatically.

The image is still nowhere near as crisp as that of current shot-on-video shows, like Sons of Anarchy, say, but detail improves enough that close-ups display refined textures, and longer shotslike the actors on stage, seen from the perspective of the audiencelook much less soft.  Noise is also significantly reduced, so that it really only becomes noticeable during the darker scenes, and black levels seem deeper and less prone to murkiness.

Color throughout the series is realisticthat is, not exceptionally vibrantand skin tones are consistently natural.  Some typical video anomalies still existmild macroblocking, blown highlights, etc.but nothing that rises to the level of distraction.

While Slings & Arrows may not look as clear and pristine as bigger budgeted major network shows, it's clear that this Blu-ray release from Acorn Media is faithful to source, which is really the best possible outcome.""

This three-season behind-the-scenes series should be required viewing for any little theatre group, also people who dismiss Shakespeare as too esoteric [or intimidating] for modern sensibilities. Normal folks may enjoy it too, watching it for the interplay of egos and characters. It never gets in its own way with the abridged scenes from Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear.

It definitely made me want to go back and read all those famous plays strategically ducked in high school. Better yet, to see them performed. The series writing is extraordinary, the humor better than engaging, and the ensemble casts headed by Paul Gross [""Geoffrey Tennant"", Artistic Director, who's burdened by the ghost of his predecessor] and Martha Burns [""Ellen"", Leading Lady who's burdened by Geoffrey, as well as her own foibles] are simply the best! I've watched all three seasons countless times, gaining insight as to why I never became an actress. Risking the clich: You don't have to be totally crazy to act, [or direct, or write] but it must certainly help.

The interplay of personal egos and quirky personalities with a loquacious ghost while making sure the show will go on sets the proverbial stage for lots of great humor.

In some ways this series has some echos of the previous series ""Due South"". The theme of ghosts speaking to Paul Gross and the lovable outcast themes carry through to good effect in both series. Fans of Due South should find Sling & Arrows a very enjoyable series.

I think these Canadians have found the path to thoughtful and thought provoking comedy. Outstanding.",1399766400,,782,4.9541984732824424

For me, there is a small handful of actors that because of their presence in the movie/show, that I will watch it without knowing anything about it.  Paul Gross is one those actors.  I have become such a fan or his work and the projects that he chooses.  Slings & Arrows did not disappoint.  Not only is it clever, but it is just unique; so different from your typical run of the mill shows.  It doesnt matter what you know about or if youve ever had any interest in Shakespeare.  If youve never been exposed to it, this show kind of sneaks it into your consciousness in a modern context.  If you like Shakespeare already, well, you will relish the insights and humor as the productions come into being.  I ended up watching it as a marathon of sorts, all the way through in a couple of days because I couldn't wait to see it all.  I ended up showing it to someone who is a retired director of a theatrical operation, and he loved it.  He thought they really captured how a theater company actually works and was chuckling with fond reminiscence the whole way through.  (It was fun watching his reaction to it, and yes, we ordered a  copy for him as well.)  In a nutshell, no matter theater novice or experienced insider, there is something for everyone to enjoy.

runs into in this business.  I have recommended this series to many people--all with backgrounds in theatre.",1388880000,,363,5.101694915254237
3008018,5,B000XUF6BU,"This series reveals the unparalleled eccentricities and egos, victories and failures, sweet young love affairs and hedonist sexual exploits of a Canadian theater and its company of players and administrators.  Most of the characters seem to have an extraordinary array of neuroses and a complete lack of adult impulse control.  It gives us the impression that Canadians in general -- and thespians in particular -- are all predisposed to indiscriminate sexual debauchery, stupefying intoxication, and language befitting a drunken sailor.

That said, this was the most marvelous mix of television comedy and drama I could ever have thought possible.  All the actors are nothing short of brilliant - how in the world did they ever assemble such an extraordinary group in one production?

Canadian actress Martha Burns plays volatile, self-absorbed lead actress Ellen Fanshaw, and her portrayal is nothing less than captivating; I simply could not take my eyes off her.  Her love-hate interest from the very distant past is Geoffrey Tennant, the quintessential Hamlet in his youth, now a complete slob who seems beyond redemption.  He's the passionate, insane-but-brilliant-actor-director played by Paul Gross.

Fragile Geoffrey has a history of thoroughly crippling, on-stage mental breakdown, and his overall instability is now made worse by frequent, unwelcome visits from the ghost of his predecessor, the narcissistic and famous director Oliver Welles, with whom he and Ellen have a complicated history.  An amazing performance by Stephen Ouimette, by the way.

As an American viewer, I had never even heard of most of the cast members, but I am reasonably familiar with Shakespeare's works.  Never before has the Bard actually brought me to tears, but Geoffrey, when priming actors for various tragic scenes, sets the stage for them with amazing, heart-wrenching sensitivity, and I once found myself weeping unexpectedly.  Kudos to Paul Gross.

The writers did an extraordinary job of crafting a play-within-a-play, slipping the complexities of classic tragedy into an uproarious contemporary comedy for three superbly entertaining seasons.  Character development and story lines achieved perfection, and when I reached the end of the series, I almost felt as if I were saying good-bye to a dear, neurotic friend.  The production is at once alarming, intoxicating, heart-warming, and addicting.",1388448000,2,2397,5.5109289617486334

You don't have to be a Shakespeare or theatre enthusiast to enjoy this series - it will make you one.  In the midst of the unique cast and quirky characters with the fresh funny storylines are these moments of breathtaking Shakespeare appreciation.  Paul Gross will explain Ophelia's madness and you will understand her, perhaps for the first time.  His character is brilliant, Geoffrey Tennant is the best thing on television.  Stephen Ouimette makes the show as Oliver's ghost, Martha Burns stuns as Ellen Fanshaw (somebody give her an award for this role!) and theatre legend William Hutt IS King Lear.  He will forever BE King Lear.  There is no other way to describe that.  Side splitting and thoroughly addictive!

So, If you ever wanted to know what it is like to live and breathe the theater with all it's humanity intact, this is the show for you. Like the Shakespeare plays the New Burbage theater troupe fight to perform within the confines of each season, (Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear) each episode is filled with comedy, tragedy, satire, romance, sex, and, yes, even a ghost! Just like Shakespeare - just like the theater! All the episodes are brilliantly written and performed by a multi-talented cast of actors. Each season has only six episodes, so savor it, because when it's over you'll wish they'd done more. I know I do. Slings and Arrows is a very special show.",1384819200,,943,4.488372093023256

3008026,5,B000XUF6BU,"This is one of the best shows ever produced for television.  The show was written to tell the story of a Canadian theater company, best known for staging Shakespearian plays.  During each of the three seasons, a different play is being produced - Season one - Hamlet, Season two - Macbeth, Season three - King Lear.  Throughout, a younger actor/director struggles to overcome the dominating influence of a now-dead director who continues to appear to him as a ghost, and those struggles evolve from one season to the next in ways that reflect the struggles of the protagonists of the season's Shakespeare.  The show is incredibly well acted and written, extraordinarily funny, and very different from anything else on television.  I highly recommend it.",1382486400,,753,5.040322580645161

3008028,4,B000XUF6BU,"The show is brilliant. Darkly funny and more intelligent than your average TV fare. The cast makes for a who's who of the Canadian entertainment industry.

I'm really impressed that this is out on blu-ray. Season 2 and 3 are in full 1080p 23.976fps high def and look pretty good. Unfortunately, the first season is only kind of HD - it has been upconverted (as advertised on the box). The easiest place to tell for sure is the title cards. The upconversion seems pretty good for the most part. It looks like they opted for a fairly sophisticated interpolation algorithm and the original 23.976fps has been restored. The downside is that there can be quite a bit of picture noise in some places.

Unfortunately, it appears to be taken from an interlaced source. For the most part it seems to have been properly de-interlaced (again see title cards), but there are a couple places (for example when Geoffrey is gesticulating in his interview with Basil/imaginary Oliver) where interlacing artefacts show up.

Although it was done pretty well, the mastered-in upconversion means that you have no control over the process. If you had the original DVD source, you could deinterlace and upconvert on the fly and try out different filters and of course the files would be a lot smaller. I would have preferred they just used DVD for the first season if higher resolution source material was available.

As far as special features, there are trailers/previews, deleted scenes and awkward interviews with the cast. Unfortunately, as usual, the upconversion on these is enough to make you vomit. The deleted scenes were taken straight from the vertically letterboxed 4:3 DVD and then horizontally letterboxed again to 16:9 1080p. Seriously! What's worse is that the ""shade of black"" isn't even the same for the two sets of black bars. Furthermore, there is a green border at the very outer pixels, which makes it difficult to automatically detect the correct cropping. The special features also appear to not have a properly normalised colour pallet (the cause of the different black bars) so that the picture appears washed out. Again it would have been nice to just have the original DVD material so it could be done properly.

But all told, this Blu-ray set is getting pretty cheap these days, so it's probably worth picking up. You won't get better quality for season 2 and 3, and the upconversion of season 1 is pretty good. If you're a purist though, you'll also want the DVD version for the first season and the special features.",1380153600,2,2526,4.865116279069768

(Season 1 and 2 are excellent, but lighter. Sorry, but I can't go into much more without giving a lot away.)

Slings is very well crafted, from the structure to the writing to the acting... it's a shame there aren't more like it. It's interesting to me, too, that each series is constructed much like the Shakespeare play around which the series is constructed. Don't let that put you off, though - I hardly noticed that until I was almost finished with season 3. It's a great show, whether you remember your high school Shakespeare or not.

The actors are clearly having the time of their lives doing the show; that makes it even more fun to watch. Give this one a whirl; you won't be sorry.",1369785600,,1119,4.273584905660377

I like that this series shows both the good and bad side of the theater--the financial difficulties for the theater and actors, dealing with bureacracy and corporations, directors with absurd ideas, etc. but then it also shows the magic of a superb performance of a play.

3008080,3,B000XUF6BU,"My review has two parts:

1. The Slings and Arrows series is excellent. I loved the show so much I paid extra to get a high quality Blu-Ray version.

2. I was disappointed with the purchased product. When I played the first disc, I noticed immediately that the resolution was DVD quality (SD). I then read the fine print (and I mean VERY fine print) -- the 1080p Blu-Ray was upconverted to HD. On further inspection of the fine print on the BD jackets, I found that the first season was upconverted from a lower res original. The second and third seasons did not describe themselves as upconverted, but they did not appear to be fully high res. Some of the scenes seemed sharp, while other scenes were grainy.

Upconverting a low res original and putting it on a 1080p BD is a somewhat deceptive practice. It's MAYBE OK if they fully disclose what they're doing, but it's going to be a dissapointment to the consumer who buys a BD disc and then learns that it's really an overall worse product than A DVD. BDs take a lot longer to load, have compatibility problems, have a higher cost, won't play on most laptops, and aren't as easily shareable with friends. In my opinion, these negatives are only overcome by the higher resolution image (HD) of a BD and possible by the audio quality. An upconverted SD offers little advantage over a DVD, since almost all DVD players will automatically do the same conversion.

I think it's OK for the movie industry to offer low res movies or TV shows on DVDs or BDs, as long as it's done on the appropriate media, is fully disclosed, and priced appropriately. Offering low res images on a Blu-ray doesn't make sense and is somewhat deceptive to the consumer. As an example of a more consumer sensitive approach -- I had been waiting for a Blu-ray version of the BBC Blue Planet series. When I couldn't find it being offered, I did some research and found that the source was SD and that there wouldn't be a BD version.

It bothers me that the movie industry may start offering SD movies on Blu-rays. From now on I'll have to investigate every movie I buy to see if they are trying to pawn off DVD quality as a high resolution Blu-ray. Amazon should take a more active role in protecting the consumer by requiring full and easy disclosure of the original resolution of the BDs that it sells. The consumer should not have to do extensive on-line research to find out what they are getting before they place an order. The consumer should be able to trust the integrity of the Blu-ray producer.

I have received comments that I should not reduce my rating of the series because I didn't like the Blu-ray implementation. I disagree. The producers are responsible for the entire delivered product. If I feel that they were deceptive in their Blu-ray packaging, then that influences the product.

Bottom line. The Slings and Arrows series is excellent. The DVD version may be a better purchase for you than the Blu-ray version. Especially if its significantly cheaper.",1292544000,38,2999,4.604868913857678
3008081,4,B000XUF6BU,"The series is wonderful in many ways, it's just too bad that it was put into such a lack-luster DVD collection. The packaging isn't bad; they used the thin cases and a cardboard sleeve so it takes up about 3.5 regular DVD cases. The reason I'm going four stars instead of five is the extras, mostly the bonus disc.

The only new extras (from the single seasons to this collection) are on the bonus disc, which I wouldn't have a problem with if there was anything substantial. The ""A Look Behind the Scenes"" Featurette includes a LOT of footage from the three (short) interviews and the (also short) ""on the set sections"". It implies on the box that there is over an hour of bonus material, but there is so much repeated footage that it feels like far less.

The trailers, interviews, deleted and extended scenes, and bloopers on the season discs are nice. And I have to say that I appreciated not having to sit through endless ads and company logos before the menu will load; it simply shows the copyright warning and the Acorn logo. I really would have loved episode commentaries (I understand there is one commentary on the Blu-Ray), and I missed having subtitles (really now, who doesn't include subtitles these days?)

If you're a big fan like me you might be tempted to purchase the Blu-ray even if you already have the DVD set.  My advice is don't.  The picture quality of the Blu-ray is no better than the DVD and the only additional extra on the Blu-ray collection is a voice-over commentary by the show's writers Susan Coyne, Bob Martin and Mark McKinney (episode 1 only).  The commentary was fun, but if you're already a fan of the show you probably won't learn anything new so the commentary alone doesn't really justify the cost of the Blu-ray.",1289952000,11,683,4.483870967741935

3008088,5,B000XUF6BU,"The story of the fictional New Burbage Shakespeare Festival. I've said this many times to people skeptical of this show: prior knowledge of William Shakespeare and/or theatre is not needed. This is a funny ensemble comedy that builds realistic characters with real emotion.

Top actor Geoffrey had a breakdown on stage years before, fleeing the New Burbage Festival. His director Oliver stayed on at the Festival, forever lamenting his favorite leading man's departure. This is backstory. The first episode has Oliver losing his life in a rather tragic accident. Geoffrey returns to New Burbage to take over for Oliver, directing Hamlet. Much to his disturbed surprise, Oliver begins paying him visits from the great beyond.

The actor Geoffrey and the director Oliver had a friendship that was also very father/son. Throughout all three seasons, that relationship continues - even though Oliver is no longer alive. It's comical, but also deeply involving on an emotional level. Is the ""ghost"" simply a product of Geoffrey's unbalanced mind? That's up to the viewer, for the most part.

Fans of Kids In the Hall and/or Saturday Night Live will know series co-writer and co-creator Mark McKinney. He plays the sleazy business manager for the festival, a man with little to no respect for legit theatre. His business decisions are consistently poor (sometimes downright crazy) but also highly amusing.

Other well known cast members include the beautiful actresses Rachel McAdams (Season One) and Academy Award nominee Sarah Polley (Season Three).

This Canadian show is admittedly very coarse in terms of language (I guess it must have been on a pay cable network in Canada to get away with all the F-bombs).

3008092,5,B000XUF6BU,"Ever been to Stratford in Canada, a town that specializes in Shakespearean plays (among others) year-round? Well, I have -- and I have new appreciation for the thespians and managers who manage to keep those venerable theatres running, if they have to deal with half the stuff that goes on in ""Slings and Arrows: The Complete Series."" It's a subtle, hilarious comedy with death, romance, ghosts and corporate idiocy.

As the story starts, artistic director Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) is run over by a pig truck after drunkenly falling asleep in the road. His replacement: former protege and genius iconoclast Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross), whose acting career ended in a nervous breakdown onstage. Unsurprisingly, the acting troupe -- including Geoffrey's ex-lover Ellen Fanshaw (Martha Burns) -- are wary of of Geoffrey's brilliant but erratic behavior.

And Geoffrey isn't too sure of himself, since he seems to be seeing Oliver's ghost trying to guide him from beyond the grave (and causing Geoffrey to start screaming at thin air). Now he has to not only produce ""Hamlet"" (ironic, no?), but deal with Ellen's cougar romances, avant-garde director Darren Nichols, and an omnivorous American businesswoman trying to turn New Burbage into a shallow theatrical theme park. Will the show go on, or is this ""Hamlet"" doomed?

The second season sees Geoffrey being forced to put on ""Macbeth,"" and the curse begins to affect the theater right away. The ""Romeo and Juliet"" director falls off the stage and breaks her neck, putting the production in Darren Nichols' hands; an edgy new ad campaign alienates EVERYBODY; Ellen is being audited; and Oliver's ghost returns to help Geoffrey put on ""Macbeth"" as he dreamed it.

And the series ends, ""King Lear is the newest production at New Burbage -- except that Oliver and Geoffrey are suffering from some personal doubts. Also, the legendary actor who has come out of retirement to play Lear... is dying. So Geoffrey has to keep the play from self-destructing and the leading man from expiring.

If I had to compare ""Slings and Arrows"" to another comedy series, it would be something like ""Arrested Development"" meets ""The Office"" (original or remake). You've got death, romance, corporate treachery, possible insanity, horrible ""postmodern"" adaptations (the chess pieces!), weird postmortem requests, goths, con-men, dancers, and occasionally a duel (""Everybody cries when they get stabbed. There's no shame in that"").

And all this increasingly ridiculous stuff is handled in a straight-faced, non-slapsticky manner with subplots that run through each season -- in fact, each season is actually kind of like a miniseries. The writing is simply brilliant (""Theatre ethics? That's like saying 'whorehouse morals.'"") and takes some brilliant comic stabs at bad actors and even worse directors (the dancing ""stoned"" Ophelia).

Gross is playing the exact opposite of his famous ""Due South"" role. His Geoffrey is wonderfully erratic, weird and devoted to his craft -- he's delightfully quirky, painfully honest and just a little big insane. Quimette is delightfully witty as Geoffrey's ghostly mentor who guides him from the great beyond, and Burns is excellent as Geofffrey's on-off lover.

3008093,5,B000XUF6BU,"Ever been to Stratford in Canada, a town that specializes in Shakespearean plays (among others) year-round? Well, I have -- and I have new appreciation for the thespians and managers who manage to keep those venerable theatres running, if they have to deal with half the stuff that goes on in ""Slings and Arrows: The Complete Series."" It's a subtle, hilarious comedy with death, romance, ghosts and corporate idiocy.

As the story starts, artistic director Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) is run over by a pig truck after drunkenly falling asleep in the road. His replacement: former protege and genius iconoclast Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross), whose acting career ended in a nervous breakdown onstage.  Unsurprisingly, the acting troupe -- including Geoffrey's ex-lover Ellen Fanshaw (Martha Burns) -- are wary of of Geoffrey's brilliant but erratic behavior.

And Geoffrey isn't too sure of himself, since he seems to be seeing Oliver's ghost trying to guide him from beyond the grave (and causing Geoffrey to start screaming at thin air). Now he has to not only produce ""Hamlet"" (ironic, no?), but deal with Ellen's cougar romances, avant-garde director Darren Nichols, and an omnivorous American businesswoman trying to turn New Burbage into a shallow theatrical theme park. Will the show go on, or is this ""Hamlet"" doomed?

The second season sees Geoffrey being forced to put on ""Macbeth,"" and the curse begins to affect the theater right away. The ""Romeo and Juliet"" director falls off the stage and breaks her neck, putting the production in Darren Nichols' hands; an edgy new ad campaign alienates EVERYBODY; Ellen is being audited; and Oliver's ghost returns to help Geoffrey put on ""Macbeth"" as he dreamed it.

And the series ends, ""King Lear is the newest production at New Burbage -- except that Oliver and Geoffrey are suffering from some personal doubts. Also, the legendary actor who has come out of retirement to play Lear... is dying. So Geoffrey has to keep the play from self-destructing and the leading man from expiring. At the same time, Darren is putting on a sort of low-rent ""Rent"" that threatens to overshadow the Bard!

But more than that, it's all true.  My theatre has its own crazy directors, cast members swapping beds, addled business managers, harried administrators, mad artists, implausible crises, and moments of sublime beauty onstage.  Our administrative building was rumored to be haunted, so we may even have had our own ghost (and he may have been talking to the directors, for all I know).

""Slings and Arrows"" is the lived experience of working in the arts.

3008100,5,B000XUF6BU,"Imagine a richly textured play about the drama that goes on backstage when a play is produced.  That's Slings & Arrows.  The characters backstage are true to the Shakespearian models onstage.  There's a tortured artistic director/stage director (Paul Gross/Geoffrey) who once had a nervous breakdown playing Hamlet and now finds himself directing that play.  There's a ghost: the late artistic director of the theater group (Oliver) who was run over by a ""pig truck.""  There's a manipulative corporate political operative (Holly Day) who makes Lady Macbeth look like a Cub Scout Den Mother.  There are a couple of long suffering servants (an administrative assistant and a Stage Manager) who do their work amidst insults.  And finally, for this list at any rate, there are clowns: a kindly, avuncular, gay couple who provide rye commentary on the action.  And the list could go on and on.

I've done community theater as a stagehand, set builder, and stage manager for 20 years. These shows capture the feel of being backstage beautifully.  The writing is lively filled with badinage, soulfull monologues, plot twists, and even some wonderful sight gags.

This is adult drama as the word used to be used. It's filled with complex characters, ample amounts of swiving, and the characters often swear like dock workers.  It is a pitty that we do not have the wealth of vulgarisms that the Elizabethians had.  The F-bomb gets repetitous.",1265155200,4,1434,5.051063829787234

Paul Gross plays the part of an eccentric theater director- who happens to be stark raving mad. Or, really, is he? Most of the accusation of madness is caused by a stray jump into a prop grave in the middle of his own production of Hamlet, trying to choke a swan with his bare hands, and regularly talking with his dead mentor. The script is brilliant; combining comedy with real-life issues. Odd dreams, odd conclusions, awkward conversations, it all adds up to laugh out loud entertainment.

3008108,5,B000XUF6BU,"Of the fifty-four previous reviews for ""Slings and Arrows"" on this Web site, forty-nine gave the show five stars, and the remaining five four stars. That in itself tells you the magic spell woven by this fresh, surprising, hilarious, insightful and touching program. From the time Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette), artistic director of the New Burbage Shakespeare Festival, gets run over by a truck labeled ""Canada's Best Hams,"" and then comes back as a ghost to haunt his already mentally unstable successor Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross), you know you are in for a wild, bawdy treat, as the program presents in agonizing and delightful detail the insecurities of the actor's life.

Spread over three six-episode seasons, ""Slings and Arrows"" shows Geoffrey and his troupe of actors as they endeavor to stage three different Shakespeare plays--""Hamlet"" first, then ""Macbeth,"" and finally ""King Lear."" In each season the plot of the show mirrors wittily the story of the play, as the wildly varied characters collide (often violently) with each other. The actors--all of them veterans of the Stratford Festival and other Canadian theater companies--are absolutely first-rate, as are the scripts by Bob Martin, Susan Coyne and Mark McKinney (the latter two also regulars on the show).

What I like best about ""Slings and Arrows"" is that, more than any other program I've seen, it portrays the unique Canadian sensibility. Other shows such as ""SCTV"" and McKinney's previous show ""Kids in the Hall"" have captured it to some extent, but not as completely as ""Slings and Arrows."" Canadian-ness is hard to define--it's kind of a cross between British politeness, American forthrightness, French clarity and a certain quizzical je ne sais quoi that no other country can boast. All I know is that ""Slings and Arrows"" is the best show-business story since ""All About Eve,"" and watching it will have you singing ""O Canada"" at the top of your lungs.",1256947200,2,1936,5.1234177215189876

3008111,4,B000XUF6BU,"Slings and Arrows is a frequently humorous, sometimes insightful and touching, and occasionally insightful story about a fictional Canadian theater company and festival that specializes in Shakespeare.  For the most part, it seems pretty true to life what with narcissistic actors, spoiled directors, and bureaucrats who take care of the administrative details.  Where it segues into fantasy is the fact that the ghost of the renowned artistic director haunts his replacement.

The story centers around Geoffrey, the talented and extremely eccentric artistic director of the festival, his girlfriend who is also the leading lady of the company, and a few other fixtures at the festival...as well as Oliver, the aforementioned ghost.  The rest of the cast varies from season to season.

<spoilers>

Season 1 centers around the festival's production of Hamlet.  This starts a bit slow, mostly because of the need to introduce the various characters.  Sub-plots include a romance between the movie star playing the title role and his Ophelia and the comical machinations of one of the theater festival's corporate American sponsors.

Season 2 has Geoffrey put on MacBeth, ""the Scottish Tragedy.""  In it he has to deal with a highly talented but demanding Shakespearean actor playing MacBeth.  In the background,  we also see a director who is even more eccentric than Geoffrey putting on ""Romeo and Juliet"" with the interesting twist that the actors playing the lead have a romance leading the actor playing Romeo to the discovery that he is bisexual and not gay.

Season 3 is the last hurrah of a dying old Shakespearean actor who Geoffrey taps to play ""King Lear.""  Complications in the background abound.  Various background stories include Geoffrey dealing with the fact that he has taken to bursting into tears when he has to speak to an audience and the clash of cultures between the Shakespearean actors and the ones putting on a musical.

As I said above, the best season is the second...perhaps because the production of MacBeth truly comes across as a great production of a timeless play.  More to the point, it deals with ghosts, which seems appropriate given the presence of Oliver's ghost.

The last season is the weakest in my opinion.  I thought the idea that Geoffrey would put a man who was dying, addicted to heroin, and given to lashing out at his colleagues for little reason even on his best days in the title role of a major production like King Lear strained my credibility.  Also, I Felt that Sarah Polley, who plays Cordelia was mostly wasted in a role that only required her to sulk and pout when she wasn't on stage.

So to sum up, I liked ""Slings and Arrows"" a great deal but I think I will watch Season 2 quicker than I will the other seasons.",1251244800,,2769,4.899141630901288

3008113,5,B000XUF6BU,"A while back I was perusing Rachel McAdams' imdb.com credits and saw a season of Slings & Arrows amongst her earlier work.  Being a big fan of Ms McAdams and noting that my local library system had Season 1 in the system I requested that it be sent over to my local branch and picked it up when the powers of the library system deigned me worthy.

And what can I say?  WOW! Sometimes you just don't know what you're missing until you get a taste.  With alacrity and joy, I watched my way through the first season (Rachel was as beautiful, charming and talented, as always) and then checked out the next two seasons in quick succession.  Simply put, this might be the best situational comedy that I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of the British version of The Office but this Canadian series may just supplant Ricky Gervais' brilliant, but very dark, comedy at the top of my personal list.  Slings & Arrows certainly finds a way to mine the laughs without resorting to being tasteless.  (Not that I'm adverse to tastelessness.)

Don't let the Shakespeare-themed theatrical setting put you off this gem because the few moments of actual plays are done quite well and are integrated into the whole production beautifully, usually bringing a touch of poignancy to the show in the process.

I would be remiss if I didn't note that I really enjoyed watching Sarah Polly's work in season three.  Having never seen nor heard of her before I believe that I can safely say that I've made a ""star discovery"" here.

Great show, without a doubt five stars.

3008132,5,B000XUF6BU,"As a theater-trained actor I of course fell in love with this series from the very first second; and I wondered equally how a show that's so good could stay so under the radar and yet how it could survive with such honest, incisive glimpses of a rather heady, esoteric subculture (of sorts).

Nevermind all that. Darkly hilarious, surprisingly literate, at times moving, but always frenetically entertaining, I believe someone who has never stepped foot in a theater could enjoy every episode and find themselves curious all over again about re-reading ""Macbeth"".

Different, but on a par with Ricky Gervais's brilliant ""Extras"" , at least in terms of depicting the sometimes absurdity of the acting world, this series doesn't settle for silly outlandishness.

There has never been anything like this on television and there never will be again. Where the heck did this show come from?? This program is a gift to all of us who have ever labored in love and obscurity in a business that did not want us with damaged people who did love us and whom we loved back.

It captures the angst and the beauty and the ecstasy that performing grants to those courageous enough to risk it all, to put it on the line for a mere idea, a phantom that shimmers in the night and then drifts away on a breath of wind.

Oh, yeah, and it's funny, too, but not in the patronizing manner we usually endure from all that soulless drivel that pollutes the airwaves day after deadly day.

This is appointment TV, my friends. Get the DVDs, get your loved ones together and watch it after a crappy day and you will be renewed. Of course, since you're real theatre people, you'll have to say you hate it because it's TV, but that's OK.

Then you'll love it so much you'll want to give your extra first season to a friend (who better be someone you feel comfortable giving unwrapped merchandise even though you've never watched that copy) who will then have the same dilemma, perpetuating the problem. Besides, you will love the second season so much more, you will want your friend to see that as well making you wonder if you should just get THEM the box set or just loan them yours which you could have done if you had just gotten the box set for yourself in the first place, rendering your original 1st season not merely moot but a frustrating waste of space on your shelf you can't bear to just throw away because it's so very good. Trust me, you want the box set. The first season is great - well conceived, written, gorgeously acted, and FUNny. I could really relate to much of the life backstage because of my theatre experience but my husband (an architect) was loving it just as much. The second and third season really takes off because you already know the characters and don't need to spend any time establishing the interpersonal dynamics. It is absolutely HILARIOUS. Beware - we became so addicted we found ourselves staying up way too late (just one more!) and were profoundly sad when it was over. Sniff! Everyday television is just not up to these standards.

I sift through so many made-for-television projects with so much promise, then compromise my expectations so that I can walk away with at least one good thing to say about them. Then something like this comes along and I am astonished. With Shakespeare for a backbone, amazingly good writers, a superb ensemble of actors, and an encyclopedic knowledge of the history of effective drama, they've produced a stunning three-year, six episodes per year project. The length is just. The story telling is excellent. And--a measure of truly good comedy--each of the two times I've wated the entire set from beginning to end (burried in weekend snowstorms in New England)--I've cried at the end of each year's production--and by God, I am not a weepy man. I bought this because I'm a complete slave to Shakespeare in any form, but that hook was quickly overwhelmed by the overall excellence of each episode. And I've been left wanting more. It's just so ingenius. The last time I was this happy with a TV series was with Northern Exposure, and it's American excellence hovers at least ten points (out of 100) below this Canadian masterpiece. 'Nuf said. (Well, maybe not. Let me say how refreshing it is to hear people deliver natural dialogue--the sort of professional and casual conversation I hear every day--passionately felt obscenities and train-wreck logic and all.

3242408,5,B000XUF6BU,"""Slings and Arrows"" is a little Canadian show that aired on the Sundance Channel in the United States. It consists of three seasons of six episodes each. The show centers on the talented but troubled Geoffrey Tennant (played by Paul Gross of Due South fame), a former Shakespearean actor who had a breakdown in the middle of a performance of Hamlet seven years prior. After his old mentor, who runs the fictional Burbage Shakespeare Festival, dies, Tennant is called to be the interim artistic director; there he is faced with his former girlfriend, an over-commercialized festival, a pretentious and untalented director, his old nemesis, the Hamlet play... and his former mentor, who is appearing to him in the form of a ghost.

The show runs the gamut from comedy to serious, and the comedy comes in all shapes too: we have physical comedy, brilliant dialogue (Don McKellar, playing the pretentious director, has one of the best entrances I've seen: ""I am Darren Nichols, so deal with that!""), dark humor (Tennant's mentor is run over by a truck with the slogan ""Canada's Best Hams""), and absurd situations (an aging actress trying to explain why she deducted the cost of makeup and push-up bras on her tax returns). And there are also serious interludes, beautifully acted and well written.

The first season follows the production of Hamlet, with an untalented but famous young American actor playing the lead; the second season tackles Macbeth, with Tennant trying to get a talented actor who has played the role numerous times (Geraint Wyn Davies, whom you may remember from Forever Knight) who does not want to take risks or explore the role and is in danger of becoming a hack. In the third and final season, the company attempts to put up King Lear, and Tennant fires the actor originally hired and goes with an aging, heroine-addicted actor who may not survive the play. The company's travails mirror the issues of the plays, as the series goes from young (Hamlet) to mature (Macbeth), to old and on the way out (Lear).

You don't need to know or love Shakespeare, as the series has plenty to amuse and entertain you (and even make you think a bit), but it won't hurt if you do. Watch this show; it will be some of the best 18 hours you've spent in front of a television.",1202774400,,2281,4.740554156171284
3242409,5,B000XUF6BU,"Life in a famous Canadian theatre company: over-inflated egos, budgetary woes, opening-night disasters, sudden death, and Shakespeare.

Paul Gross is eccentrically charming, sexy and very funny as Geoffrey Tennant, a passionate actor who, after years of residency in a psychiatric ward, returns to the New Burbage Theatre Festival  (somewhere in middle-Canada) and by default, ends up as its artistic director. He must keep it all going while contending with self-absorbed actors, rehearsals, a manipulative company manager, guest directors and stars who really get on his nerves, feelings for his old flame who's still the company's female star, the bossy ghost of his dead predecessor, and his fears (which stem mostly from the fact that he really sees and argues with the ghost) that he himself is still crazy.

Among the co-stars are Rachel McAdams, Geraint Wyn Davies, Sarah Polley, Don McKellar, Colm Feore and Mark McKinney.

Watching makes me want to be a stage actor...",1202169600,16,978,5.290322580645161
3242410,5,B000XUF6BU,"So few people I know are aware of this wonderful show's existence.  My hope is that collecting all three seasons in a single DVD box set could lead to a whole new group of viewers.  What impressed me about the series is the way it provided absolutely first-rate popular entertainment in a relatively highbrow context.  It is funny.  There are romantic another other kinds of relationships that we as viewers come to care deeply about.  And we are introduced to a host of fascinating characters.  But at the same time there is some remarkably insightful discussion of Shakespeare.

You don't have to love Shakespeare to love this series, but you'll love it all the more if you do.  If you don't own copies of HAMLET, MCBETH, and KING LEAR, I would strongly encourage you to order copies of each along with this box set.  I reread each play as a result of seeing SLINGS AND ARROWS.  I suspect that a substantial number of viewers of the show have done so as well.

The stories revolve around a moderately successful theater festival in a fictitious Canadian town.  When Oliver Welles, the revered head of the festival, dies unexpectedly Geoffrey Tennant, a formerly celebrated actor who made his mark there, is asked to return as director.  Paul Gross (perhaps best known to those in the United States as the Mounty assigned to Chicago in the fun series DUE SOUTH) absolutely steals the series as Tennant.  I've seen a great deal of his work and this is hands down the best thing he has done.  Although he steals the show, his real life wife Martha Burns costars as the resident lead actress of the troupe and the former lover of Tennant.  The most surprising performance on the show might be that of Mark McKinney, formerly of KIDS IN THE HALL, who does a great job as the festival's business director.  The cast is bolstered by a number of superb supporting characters as well as several excellent guest stars.  Rachel McAdams was great on the show until Hollywood beckoned and she left the series after Season One.  Geraint Wyn Davies, who many will remember from the vampire TV series FOREVER KNIGHT, excelled in Season Two as famous Shakespearean recruited to play McBeth.  Sarah Polley (whose father was a regular on the series) is Season Three's Cordelia.  Celebrated Canadian Shakespearean actor William Hutt turns in an astonishing performance as Season Three's Lear.  But the funniest guest role is hands down that by Colm Feore, who plays a charlatan PR firm director.

This is just great TV and if you haven't seen this, you must.  This is the best completely unknown television series of the past several years.  I've pushed other little watched series on friends, like FRIDAY NIGHT LIGHTS, but that wonderful series has several times the audience that SLINGS AND ARROWS had.

The acting is fabulous, especially the main character played by Paul Gross. Don't miss Rachel McAdams in an early role where she has a chance to show her real talent. The issues surrounding creativity and madness, art vs. commerce, the nature of love and questions of death are wonderfully juxtaposed in the theater company's shenanigans as parallels to their representation in the plays.",1451260800,,664,5.333333333333333

This preceded all of them -- on Canadian television over three seasons. It's the hilarious and often moving story of a mythical Canadian Shakespeare festival (think Stratford) and its staff, actors, directors, and managing director and especially the artistic director, played by Paul Gross. While it's wickedly funny, it's a revelation for anyone who doesn't ""get"" Shakespeare, or doesn't know much about the behind-the-scenes of the theater world. Contains great performance excerpts, especially of HAMLET (season one), MACBETH (season two), and KING LEAR (season three) -- hence this series which was designed to be three seasons follows the ""ages of man"" idea with youth, middle age, and old age. But ghosts abound everywhere! As do bizarre publicists, egocentric avant-garde directors, money-hungry funds manipulations, silly musicals . . . and fantastic Shakespearean performances.

So clever and hilarious and beguiling, I cannot recommend it highly enough.  But --- I had a small issue with the DVD set I purchased from Amazon last month: In the first three (?) DVDs, there was always one scene where the mix would be slightly off for about 10-20 seconds, and I couldn't hear what characters were saying. Not sure if the DVD set I got had some issues or what???  This did not happen when I watched my friend's DVD set.

3242477,5,B000XUF6BU,"First off: This is a fantastic show - One of my very favorites, up there with Northern Exposure.

But it seems there is some misconception about this Blu-Ray Set and the quality thereof.

So as a matter of Clarity let me be clear - Only Season One was shot In Standard Def and is upscaled for this Blu-Ray Set.  Seasons 2 and 3 were shot in High Def and so look quite nice on this Collection. To quote from Blu-Ray.com:

""Ay, there's the rub. The first season of Slings & Arrows was shot in standard definition and has been upscaled here into a 1080p/AVC-encoded presentation.

As you'd expect, the image is quite soft and even chunky at times, with no fine detail to speak of, frequent bouts of thick video noise, and black levels that are hazy and grayish. That said, this is the best the material can and will look given how it was shot, so I see no cause to complain. (The back of the case also clearly states that the first season is upscaled.)

Thankfully, though, the production switched to high definition for seasons two and three, and the picture improves dramatically.

The image is still nowhere near as crisp as that of current shot-on-video shows, like Sons of Anarchy, say, but detail improves enough that close-ups display refined textures, and longer shotslike the actors on stage, seen from the perspective of the audiencelook much less soft.  Noise is also significantly reduced, so that it really only becomes noticeable during the darker scenes, and black levels seem deeper and less prone to murkiness.

Color throughout the series is realisticthat is, not exceptionally vibrantand skin tones are consistently natural.  Some typical video anomalies still existmild macroblocking, blown highlights, etc.but nothing that rises to the level of distraction.

While Slings & Arrows may not look as clear and pristine as bigger budgeted major network shows, it's clear that this Blu-ray release from Acorn Media is faithful to source, which is really the best possible outcome.""

This three-season behind-the-scenes series should be required viewing for any little theatre group, also people who dismiss Shakespeare as too esoteric [or intimidating] for modern sensibilities. Normal folks may enjoy it too, watching it for the interplay of egos and characters. It never gets in its own way with the abridged scenes from Hamlet, Macbeth, and King Lear.

It definitely made me want to go back and read all those famous plays strategically ducked in high school. Better yet, to see them performed. The series writing is extraordinary, the humor better than engaging, and the ensemble casts headed by Paul Gross [""Geoffrey Tennant"", Artistic Director, who's burdened by the ghost of his predecessor] and Martha Burns [""Ellen"", Leading Lady who's burdened by Geoffrey, as well as her own foibles] are simply the best! I've watched all three seasons countless times, gaining insight as to why I never became an actress. Risking the clich: You don't have to be totally crazy to act, [or direct, or write] but it must certainly help.

The interplay of personal egos and quirky personalities with a loquacious ghost while making sure the show will go on sets the proverbial stage for lots of great humor.

In some ways this series has some echos of the previous series ""Due South"". The theme of ghosts speaking to Paul Gross and the lovable outcast themes carry through to good effect in both series. Fans of Due South should find Sling & Arrows a very enjoyable series.

I think these Canadians have found the path to thoughtful and thought provoking comedy. Outstanding.",1399766400,,782,4.9541984732824424

For me, there is a small handful of actors that because of their presence in the movie/show, that I will watch it without knowing anything about it.  Paul Gross is one those actors.  I have become such a fan or his work and the projects that he chooses.  Slings & Arrows did not disappoint.  Not only is it clever, but it is just unique; so different from your typical run of the mill shows.  It doesnt matter what you know about or if youve ever had any interest in Shakespeare.  If youve never been exposed to it, this show kind of sneaks it into your consciousness in a modern context.  If you like Shakespeare already, well, you will relish the insights and humor as the productions come into being.  I ended up watching it as a marathon of sorts, all the way through in a couple of days because I couldn't wait to see it all.  I ended up showing it to someone who is a retired director of a theatrical operation, and he loved it.  He thought they really captured how a theater company actually works and was chuckling with fond reminiscence the whole way through.  (It was fun watching his reaction to it, and yes, we ordered a  copy for him as well.)  In a nutshell, no matter theater novice or experienced insider, there is something for everyone to enjoy.

runs into in this business.  I have recommended this series to many people--all with backgrounds in theatre.",1388880000,,363,5.101694915254237
3242515,5,B000XUF6BU,"This series reveals the unparalleled eccentricities and egos, victories and failures, sweet young love affairs and hedonist sexual exploits of a Canadian theater and its company of players and administrators.  Most of the characters seem to have an extraordinary array of neuroses and a complete lack of adult impulse control.  It gives us the impression that Canadians in general -- and thespians in particular -- are all predisposed to indiscriminate sexual debauchery, stupefying intoxication, and language befitting a drunken sailor.

That said, this was the most marvelous mix of television comedy and drama I could ever have thought possible.  All the actors are nothing short of brilliant - how in the world did they ever assemble such an extraordinary group in one production?

Canadian actress Martha Burns plays volatile, self-absorbed lead actress Ellen Fanshaw, and her portrayal is nothing less than captivating; I simply could not take my eyes off her.  Her love-hate interest from the very distant past is Geoffrey Tennant, the quintessential Hamlet in his youth, now a complete slob who seems beyond redemption.  He's the passionate, insane-but-brilliant-actor-director played by Paul Gross.

Fragile Geoffrey has a history of thoroughly crippling, on-stage mental breakdown, and his overall instability is now made worse by frequent, unwelcome visits from the ghost of his predecessor, the narcissistic and famous director Oliver Welles, with whom he and Ellen have a complicated history.  An amazing performance by Stephen Ouimette, by the way.

As an American viewer, I had never even heard of most of the cast members, but I am reasonably familiar with Shakespeare's works.  Never before has the Bard actually brought me to tears, but Geoffrey, when priming actors for various tragic scenes, sets the stage for them with amazing, heart-wrenching sensitivity, and I once found myself weeping unexpectedly.  Kudos to Paul Gross.

The writers did an extraordinary job of crafting a play-within-a-play, slipping the complexities of classic tragedy into an uproarious contemporary comedy for three superbly entertaining seasons.  Character development and story lines achieved perfection, and when I reached the end of the series, I almost felt as if I were saying good-bye to a dear, neurotic friend.  The production is at once alarming, intoxicating, heart-warming, and addicting.",1388448000,2,2397,5.5109289617486334

3242520,5,B000XUF6BU,"Honestly, this show is one of the smartest, funniest, quirkiest, most interesting and addictive things that has ever graced television.  You don't have to be a Shakespeare or theatre enthusiast to enjoy this series - it will make you one.  In the midst of the unique cast and quirky characters with the fresh funny storylines are these moments of breathtaking Shakespeare appreciation.  Paul Gross will explain Ophelia's madness and you will understand her, perhaps for the first time.  His character is brilliant, Geoffrey Tennant is the best thing on television.  Stephen Ouimette makes the show as Oliver's ghost, Martha Burns stuns as Ellen Fanshaw (somebody give her an award for this role!) and theatre legend William Hutt IS King Lear.  He will forever BE King Lear.  There is no other way to describe that.  Side splitting and thoroughly addictive!

The fact that it is Canadian may have a lot to do with it, because no American network would ever have considered it. We don't even teach Shakespeare in school here anymore.
So, If you ever wanted to know what it is like to live and breathe the theater with all it's humanity intact, this is the show for you. Like the Shakespeare plays the New Burbage theater troupe fight to perform within the confines of each season, (Hamlet, Macbeth and King Lear) each episode is filled with comedy, tragedy, satire, romance, sex, and, yes, even a ghost! Just like Shakespeare - just like the theater! All the episodes are brilliantly written and performed by a multi-talented cast of actors. Each season has only six episodes, so savor it, because when it's over you'll wish they'd done more. I know I do. Slings and Arrows is a very special show.",1384819200,,943,4.488372093023256

3242523,5,B000XUF6BU,"This is one of the best shows ever produced for television.  The show was written to tell the story of a Canadian theater company, best known for staging Shakespearian plays.  During each of the three seasons, a different play is being produced - Season one - Hamlet, Season two - Macbeth, Season three - King Lear.  Throughout, a younger actor/director struggles to overcome the dominating influence of a now-dead director who continues to appear to him as a ghost, and those struggles evolve from one season to the next in ways that reflect the struggles of the protagonists of the season's Shakespeare.  The show is incredibly well acted and written, extraordinarily funny, and very different from anything else on television.  I highly recommend it.",1382486400,,753,5.040322580645161

3242525,4,B000XUF6BU,"The show is brilliant. Darkly funny and more intelligent than your average TV fare. The cast makes for a who's who of the Canadian entertainment industry.

I'm really impressed that this is out on blu-ray. Season 2 and 3 are in full 1080p 23.976fps high def and look pretty good. Unfortunately, the first season is only kind of HD - it has been upconverted (as advertised on the box). The easiest place to tell for sure is the title cards. The upconversion seems pretty good for the most part. It looks like they opted for a fairly sophisticated interpolation algorithm and the original 23.976fps has been restored. The downside is that there can be quite a bit of picture noise in some places.

Unfortunately, it appears to be taken from an interlaced source. For the most part it seems to have been properly de-interlaced (again see title cards), but there are a couple places (for example when Geoffrey is gesticulating in his interview with Basil/imaginary Oliver) where interlacing artefacts show up.

Although it was done pretty well, the mastered-in upconversion means that you have no control over the process. If you had the original DVD source, you could deinterlace and upconvert on the fly and try out different filters and of course the files would be a lot smaller. I would have preferred they just used DVD for the first season if higher resolution source material was available.

As far as special features, there are trailers/previews, deleted scenes and awkward interviews with the cast. Unfortunately, as usual, the upconversion on these is enough to make you vomit. The deleted scenes were taken straight from the vertically letterboxed 4:3 DVD and then horizontally letterboxed again to 16:9 1080p. Seriously! What's worse is that the ""shade of black"" isn't even the same for the two sets of black bars. Furthermore, there is a green border at the very outer pixels, which makes it difficult to automatically detect the correct cropping. The special features also appear to not have a properly normalised colour pallet (the cause of the different black bars) so that the picture appears washed out. Again it would have been nice to just have the original DVD material so it could be done properly.

But all told, this Blu-ray set is getting pretty cheap these days, so it's probably worth picking up. You won't get better quality for season 2 and 3, and the upconversion of season 1 is pretty good. If you're a purist though, you'll also want the DVD version for the first season and the special features.",1380153600,2,2526,4.865116279069768

3242543,5,B000XUF6BU,"I love this show; I'd seen the first two seasons a couple times, but never saw season 3 until this week. Season 3 is a bit dark, in that it deals with King Lear and a few other potentially tragic situations. I was going to give up after the first couple shows, but then I thought, the other two seasons were worth watching all the way through; I'm glad I stuck it out, as season 3 proved to be the most interesting of the lot. (Season 1 and 2 are excellent, but lighter. Sorry, but I can't go into much more without giving a lot away.)

Slings is very well crafted, from the structure to the writing to the acting... it's a shame there aren't more like it. It's interesting to me, too, that each series is constructed much like the Shakespeare play around which the series is constructed. Don't let that put you off, though - I hardly noticed that until I was almost finished with season 3. It's a great show, whether you remember your high school Shakespeare or not.

The actors are clearly having the time of their lives doing the show; that makes it even more fun to watch. Give this one a whirl; you won't be sorry.",1369785600,,1119,4.273584905660377

This is an outstanding show--terrific stories, acting, writing, etc., both darkly comic and dramatic. Paul Gross is terrific in it. You don't have to know Shakespeare to enjoy this but it helps. I am a fan of Shakespeare but was not familiar with MacBeth or King Lear, so found it helped me appreciate and understand Seasons 2 and 3 to read a little about those plays before watching those seasons. When you know the plots of those plays, as well as about the MacBeth curse, you can better appreciate what is going on in the episodes. I like that this series shows both the good and bad side of the theater--the financial difficulties for the theater and actors, dealing with bureacracy and corporations, directors with absurd ideas, etc. but then it also shows the magic of a superb performance of a play. I experienced that years ago when I saw a well-done performance of Hamlet--I was actually ill when I saw it but the performance was so good I was on the edge of my seat and forgot how I was feeling physically.",1320883200,2,1336,4.434959349593496

3242576,5,B000XUF6BU,"Slings & Arrows is a wonderful series filled with comic and dramatic in equal measure. A good introduction to the world of professional theatre for the uninitiated, and full of inside jokes for those who live the life. Sad that it was only three seasons of episodes.",1297296000,,266,4.680851063829787
3242577,3,B000XUF6BU,"My review has two parts:

1. The Slings and Arrows series is excellent. I loved the show so much I paid extra to get a high quality Blu-Ray version.

2. I was disappointed with the purchased product. When I played the first disc, I noticed immediately that the resolution was DVD quality (SD). I then read the fine print (and I mean VERY fine print) -- the 1080p Blu-Ray was upconverted to HD. On further inspection of the fine print on the BD jackets, I found that the first season was upconverted from a lower res original. The second and third seasons did not describe themselves as upconverted, but they did not appear to be fully high res. Some of the scenes seemed sharp, while other scenes were grainy.

Upconverting a low res original and putting it on a 1080p BD is a somewhat deceptive practice. It's MAYBE OK if they fully disclose what they're doing, but it's going to be a dissapointment to the consumer who buys a BD disc and then learns that it's really an overall worse product than A DVD. BDs take a lot longer to load, have compatibility problems, have a higher cost, won't play on most laptops, and aren't as easily shareable with friends. In my opinion, these negatives are only overcome by the higher resolution image (HD) of a BD and possible by the audio quality. An upconverted SD offers little advantage over a DVD, since almost all DVD players will automatically do the same conversion.

I think it's OK for the movie industry to offer low res movies or TV shows on DVDs or BDs, as long as it's done on the appropriate media, is fully disclosed, and priced appropriately. Offering low res images on a Blu-ray doesn't make sense and is somewhat deceptive to the consumer. As an example of a more consumer sensitive approach -- I had been waiting for a Blu-ray version of the BBC Blue Planet series. When I couldn't find it being offered, I did some research and found that the source was SD and that there wouldn't be a BD version.

It bothers me that the movie industry may start offering SD movies on Blu-rays. From now on I'll have to investigate every movie I buy to see if they are trying to pawn off DVD quality as a high resolution Blu-ray. Amazon should take a more active role in protecting the consumer by requiring full and easy disclosure of the original resolution of the BDs that it sells. The consumer should not have to do extensive on-line research to find out what they are getting before they place an order. The consumer should be able to trust the integrity of the Blu-ray producer.

I have received comments that I should not reduce my rating of the series because I didn't like the Blu-ray implementation. I disagree. The producers are responsible for the entire delivered product. If I feel that they were deceptive in their Blu-ray packaging, then that influences the product.

Bottom line. The Slings and Arrows series is excellent. The DVD version may be a better purchase for you than the Blu-ray version. Especially if its significantly cheaper.",1292544000,38,2999,4.604868913857678
3242578,4,B000XUF6BU,"The series is wonderful in many ways, it's just too bad that it was put into such a lack-luster DVD collection. The packaging isn't bad; they used the thin cases and a cardboard sleeve so it takes up about 3.5 regular DVD cases. The reason I'm going four stars instead of five is the extras, mostly the bonus disc.

The only new extras (from the single seasons to this collection) are on the bonus disc, which I wouldn't have a problem with if there was anything substantial. The ""A Look Behind the Scenes"" Featurette includes a LOT of footage from the three (short) interviews and the (also short) ""on the set sections"". It implies on the box that there is over an hour of bonus material, but there is so much repeated footage that it feels like far less.

The trailers, interviews, deleted and extended scenes, and bloopers on the season discs are nice. And I have to say that I appreciated not having to sit through endless ads and company logos before the menu will load; it simply shows the copyright warning and the Acorn logo. I really would have loved episode commentaries (I understand there is one commentary on the Blu-Ray), and I missed having subtitles (really now, who doesn't include subtitles these days?)

Paul Gross is a riot, and at the same time able to reach right out of the screen and close his fist around your heart. When he gives notes to the bad Ophelia, I feel like I'm on stage. Every season ends with the production of one of the tragedies. Hamlet made me weep with wonder, during Macbeth (of all plays the Scots play!) I almost wet my pants I was laughing so hard, and I was almost sobbing by the end of Lear. Anyone who loves theatre will love this series.

If you're a big fan like me you might be tempted to purchase the Blu-ray even if you already have the DVD set.  My advice is don't.  The picture quality of the Blu-ray is no better than the DVD and the only additional extra on the Blu-ray collection is a voice-over commentary by the show's writers Susan Coyne, Bob Martin and Mark McKinney (episode 1 only).  The commentary was fun, but if you're already a fan of the show you probably won't learn anything new so the commentary alone doesn't really justify the cost of the Blu-ray.",1289952000,11,683,4.483870967741935

3242585,5,B000XUF6BU,"The story of the fictional New Burbage Shakespeare Festival. I've said this many times to people skeptical of this show: prior knowledge of William Shakespeare and/or theatre is not needed. This is a funny ensemble comedy that builds realistic characters with real emotion.

Top actor Geoffrey had a breakdown on stage years before, fleeing the New Burbage Festival. His director Oliver stayed on at the Festival, forever lamenting his favorite leading man's departure. This is backstory. The first episode has Oliver losing his life in a rather tragic accident. Geoffrey returns to New Burbage to take over for Oliver, directing Hamlet. Much to his disturbed surprise, Oliver begins paying him visits from the great beyond.

The actor Geoffrey and the director Oliver had a friendship that was also very father/son. Throughout all three seasons, that relationship continues - even though Oliver is no longer alive. It's comical, but also deeply involving on an emotional level. Is the ""ghost"" simply a product of Geoffrey's unbalanced mind? That's up to the viewer, for the most part.

Fans of Kids In the Hall and/or Saturday Night Live will know series co-writer and co-creator Mark McKinney. He plays the sleazy business manager for the festival, a man with little to no respect for legit theatre. His business decisions are consistently poor (sometimes downright crazy) but also highly amusing.

Other well known cast members include the beautiful actresses Rachel McAdams (Season One) and Academy Award nominee Sarah Polley (Season Three).

This Canadian show is admittedly very coarse in terms of language (I guess it must have been on a pay cable network in Canada to get away with all the F-bombs).

You don't need to have an interest in either.  The real fun is watching talented people sweat over every detail in creating entertainment FOR YOU.  If there is any ego in Fred Astaire or Slings and Arrows, I can't see it.  Ironic, that with all the ""power"" of the Internet this show has not reached its proper place in things to watch.

Well, I have -- and I have new appreciation for the thespians and managers who manage to keep those venerable theatres running, if they have to deal with half the stuff that goes on in ""Slings and Arrows: The Complete Series."" It's a subtle, hilarious comedy with death, romance, ghosts and corporate idiocy.

As the story starts, artistic director Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette) is run over by a pig truck after drunkenly falling asleep in the road. His replacement: former protege and genius iconoclast Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross), whose acting career ended in a nervous breakdown onstage. Unsurprisingly, the acting troupe -- including Geoffrey's ex-lover Ellen Fanshaw (Martha Burns) -- are wary of of Geoffrey's brilliant but erratic behavior.

And Geoffrey isn't too sure of himself, since he seems to be seeing Oliver's ghost trying to guide him from beyond the grave (and causing Geoffrey to start screaming at thin air). Now he has to not only produce ""Hamlet"" (ironic, no?), but deal with Ellen's cougar romances, avant-garde director Darren Nichols, and an omnivorous American businesswoman trying to turn New Burbage into a shallow theatrical theme park. Will the show go on, or is this ""Hamlet"" doomed?

The second season sees Geoffrey being forced to put on ""Macbeth,"" and the curse begins to affect the theater right away. The ""Romeo and Juliet"" director falls off the stage and breaks her neck, putting the production in Darren Nichols' hands; an edgy new ad campaign alienates EVERYBODY; Ellen is being audited; and Oliver's ghost returns to help Geoffrey put on ""Macbeth"" as he dreamed it.

And the series ends, ""King Lear is the newest production at New Burbage -- except that Oliver and Geoffrey are suffering from some personal doubts. Also, the legendary actor who has come out of retirement to play Lear... is dying. So Geoffrey has to keep the play from self-destructing and the leading man from expiring. At the same time, Darren is putting on a sort of low-rent ""Rent"" that threatens to overshadow the Bard!

If I had to compare ""Slings and Arrows"" to another comedy series, it would be something like ""Arrested Development"" meets ""The Office"" (original or remake). You've got death, romance, corporate treachery, possible insanity, horrible ""postmodern"" adaptations (the chess pieces!), weird postmortem requests, goths, con-men, dancers, and occasionally a duel (""Everybody cries when they get stabbed. There's no shame in that"").

And all this increasingly ridiculous stuff is handled in a straight-faced, non-slapsticky manner with subplots that run through each season -- in fact, each season is actually kind of like a miniseries. The writing is simply brilliant (""Theatre ethics? That's like saying 'whorehouse morals.'"") and takes some brilliant comic stabs at bad actors and even worse directors (the dancing ""stoned"" Ophelia).

Gross is playing the exact opposite of his famous ""Due South"" role. His Geoffrey is wonderfully erratic, weird and devoted to his craft -- he's delightfully quirky, painfully honest and just a little big insane. Quimette is delightfully witty as Geoffrey's ghostly mentor who guides him from the great beyond, and Burns is excellent as Geofffrey's on-off lover.

There's a ghost: the late artistic director of the theater group (Oliver) who was run over by a ""pig truck.""  There's a manipulative corporate political operative (Holly Day) who makes Lady Macbeth look like a Cub Scout Den Mother.  There are a couple of long suffering servants (an administrative assistant and a Stage Manager) who do their work amidst insults.

The use of profane language was the only put-off (I suppose it made the show more realistic, but was it really necessary?  The English language is so rich, why resort to swearing?), but the rest of the show was so thoroughly enjoyable, we put up with it.

Paul Gross plays the part of an eccentric theater director- who happens to be stark raving mad. Or, really, is he? Most of the accusation of madness is caused by a stray jump into a prop grave in the middle of his own production of Hamlet, trying to choke a swan with his bare hands, and regularly talking with his dead mentor. The script is brilliant; combining comedy with real-life issues. Odd dreams, odd conclusions, awkward conversations, it all adds up to laugh out loud entertainment.

3242605,5,B000XUF6BU,"Of the fifty-four previous reviews for ""Slings and Arrows"" on this Web site, forty-nine gave the show five stars, and the remaining five four stars. That in itself tells you the magic spell woven by this fresh, surprising, hilarious, insightful and touching program. From the time Oliver Welles (Stephen Ouimette), artistic director of the New Burbage Shakespeare Festival, gets run over by a truck labeled ""Canada's Best Hams,"" and then comes back as a ghost to haunt his already mentally unstable successor Geoffrey Tennant (Paul Gross), you know you are in for a wild, bawdy treat, as the program presents in agonizing and delightful detail the insecurities of the actor's life.

Spread over three six-episode seasons, ""Slings and Arrows"" shows Geoffrey and his troupe of actors as they endeavor to stage three different Shakespeare plays--""Hamlet"" first, then ""Macbeth,"" and finally ""King Lear."" In each season the plot of the show mirrors wittily the story of the play, as the wildly varied characters collide (often violently) with each other. The actors--all of them veterans of the Stratford Festival and other Canadian theater companies--are absolutely first-rate, as are the scripts by Bob Martin, Susan Coyne and Mark McKinney (the latter two also regulars on the show).

What I like best about ""Slings and Arrows"" is that, more than any other program I've seen, it portrays the unique Canadian sensibility. Other shows such as ""SCTV"" and McKinney's previous show ""Kids in the Hall"" have captured it to some extent, but not as completely as ""Slings and Arrows."" Canadian-ness is hard to define--it's kind of a cross between British politeness, American forthrightness, French clarity and a certain quizzical je ne sais quoi that no other country can boast. All I know is that ""Slings and Arrows"" is the best show-business story since ""All About Eve,"" and watching it will have you singing ""O Canada"" at the top of your lungs.",1256947200,2,1936,5.1234177215189876

I would rate this up there with ""The Sopranos"" and ""6 Feet Under"" as one of the best TV mini series of the last fifteen years. And you have Rachel McAdams in season one (and one ep of season two) what more can you want to make utter perfection??

3242608,4,B000XUF6BU,"Slings and Arrows is a frequently humorous, sometimes insightful and touching, and occasionally insightful story about a fictional Canadian theater company and festival that specializes in Shakespeare.  For the most part, it seems pretty true to life what with narcissistic actors, spoiled directors, and bureaucrats who take care of the administrative details.  Where it segues into fantasy is the fact that the ghost of the renowned artistic director haunts his replacement.

The story centers around Geoffrey, the talented and extremely eccentric artistic director of the festival, his girlfriend who is also the leading lady of the company, and a few other fixtures at the festival...as well as Oliver, the aforementioned ghost.  The rest of the cast varies from season to season.

<spoilers>

Season 1 centers around the festival's production of Hamlet.  This starts a bit slow, mostly because of the need to introduce the various characters.  Sub-plots include a romance between the movie star playing the title role and his Ophelia and the comical machinations of one of the theater festival's corporate American sponsors.

Season 2 has Geoffrey put on MacBeth, ""the Scottish Tragedy.""  In it he has to deal with a highly talented but demanding Shakespearean actor playing MacBeth.  In the background,  we also see a director who is even more eccentric than Geoffrey putting on ""Romeo and Juliet"" with the interesting twist that the actors playing the lead have a romance leading the actor playing Romeo to the discovery that he is bisexual and not gay.

Season 3 is the last hurrah of a dying old Shakespearean actor who Geoffrey taps to play ""King Lear.""  Complications in the background abound.  Various background stories include Geoffrey dealing with the fact that he has taken to bursting into tears when he has to speak to an audience and the clash of cultures between the Shakespearean actors and the ones putting on a musical.

As I said above, the best season is the second...perhaps because the production of MacBeth truly comes across as a great production of a timeless play.  More to the point, it deals with ghosts, which seems appropriate given the presence of Oliver's ghost.

The last season is the weakest in my opinion.  I thought the idea that Geoffrey would put a man who was dying, addicted to heroin, and given to lashing out at his colleagues for little reason even on his best days in the title role of a major production like King Lear strained my credibility.  Also, I Felt that Sarah Polley, who plays Cordelia was mostly wasted in a role that only required her to sulk and pout when she wasn't on stage.

So to sum up, I liked ""Slings and Arrows"" a great deal but I think I will watch Season 2 quicker than I will the other seasons.",1251244800,,2769,4.899141630901288

3242610,5,B000XUF6BU,"A while back I was perusing Rachel McAdams' imdb.com credits and saw a season of Slings & Arrows amongst her earlier work.  Being a big fan of Ms McAdams and noting that my local library system had Season 1 in the system I requested that it be sent over to my local branch and picked it up when the powers of the library system deigned me worthy.

And what can I say?  WOW! Sometimes you just don't know what you're missing until you get a taste.  With alacrity and joy, I watched my way through the first season (Rachel was as beautiful, charming and talented, as always) and then checked out the next two seasons in quick succession.  Simply put, this might be the best situational comedy that I've ever seen.  I'm a big fan of the British version of The Office but this Canadian series may just supplant Ricky Gervais' brilliant, but very dark, comedy at the top of my personal list.  Slings & Arrows certainly finds a way to mine the laughs without resorting to being tasteless.  (Not that I'm adverse to tastelessness.)

Don't let the Shakespeare-themed theatrical setting put you off this gem because the few moments of actual plays are done quite well and are integrated into the whole production beautifully, usually bringing a touch of poignancy to the show in the process.

I would be remiss if I didn't note that I really enjoyed watching Sarah Polly's work in season three.  Having never seen nor heard of her before I believe that I can safely say that I've made a ""star discovery"" here.

Great show, without a doubt five stars.

Nevermind all that. Darkly hilarious, surprisingly literate, at times moving, but always frenetically entertaining, I believe someone who has never stepped foot in a theater could enjoy every episode and find themselves curious all over again about re-reading ""Macbeth"".

And--a measure of truly good comedy--each of the two times I've wated the entire set from beginning to end (burried in weekend snowstorms in New England)--I've cried at the end of each year's production--and by God, I am not a weepy man. I bought this because I'm a complete slave to Shakespeare in any form, but that hook was quickly overwhelmed by the overall excellence of each episode. And I've been left wanting more. It's just so ingenius. The last time I was this happy with a TV series was with Northern Exposure, and it's American excellence hovers at least ten points (out of 100) below this Canadian masterpiece. 'Nuf said. (Well, maybe not. Let me say how refreshing it is to hear people deliver natural dialogue--the sort of professional and casual conversation I hear every day--passionately felt obscenities and train-wreck logic and all. This artificial dialogue that dominates American TV drama as a deep bow to the fantasies of the fundamentalists is nauseating--and its not fooling anyone.)",1206921600,11,1538,5.08300395256917
3242642,5,B000XUF6BU,"This is a wonderful TV show -- intelligently written, funny, complex and superbly acted. Perfect for theatre lovers, fans of good drama or tart comedy, and anyone looking for TV shows that elevate the medium and have real substance. And, god, Paul Gross is a marvelous actor!!

Just for reference, other favorite shows of mine include ""Freaks & Geeks,"" ""My So-Called Life,"" ""Six Feet Under,"" ""Rome,"" ""West Wing"" ""Buffy,"" ""Prime Suspect"" and a few others... This one easily rises towards the top of the list. Highly recommended. Also, this is perhaps the best ending to a TV series that I've ever seen -- often great shows either peter out or abruptly get canceled -- here, for once, the creators crafted an elegant, utterly satisfying conclusion and went out on a high note. Yay. (Joe Sixpack, Slipcue)",1206662400,2,802,4.897058823529412
3242643,5,B000XUF6BU,"This series from Canada is on a level with it's subject, Shakespeare.  It is a piece of brilliant writing, brilliant wit, brilliant performance, and leaves you feeling in love, wanting it to go on forever.  If you appreciate art, honesty, imagination, and the greatness of theater, these will be hours spent memorably and forever.",1206403200,3,330,5.092592592592593
3242644,5,B000XUF6BU,This series is amazing!  We couldn't stop watching it and were really bummed it ended.  Awesome for Shakespeare lovers and likers alike.  Well acted.  Well directed.  Refreshingly novel and unique.  Will be sharing it with our friends.,1206403200,2,235,5.216216216216216
3242645,5,B000XUF6BU,"Anyone who loves Shakespeare, regional theatre and humor will love this CBC series. The acting is top rate and will keep you laughing with the clever timing and wonderful dialogue. I got all three seasons and can't wait for the 4th to become available.

3242646,5,B000XUF6BU,"Does it get any better than this?  Witty, clever, at times hilarious, and also poignant, this Canadian series is a brilliant look at the theatre in general, and a Shakespeare festival in particular.  It is beautifully acted and edited, and the absolute truth for an arts festival struggling to balance the demands of artistic excellence with financial survival.  We fell in love with the characters and had a very hard time stopping watching between episodes.  Great performances, great storytelling and great understanding of the artistic process.  Highest possible recommendation!!!!",1206230400,3,585,5.52808988764045
3242647,5,B000XUF6BU,"This series is a must-see for anybody who loves the theater. Season 1 is superior to seasons 2 & 3, but they are still entertaining. This box set is a good buy - all 18 episodes for ~ 40 bucks.",1205971200,,193,3.85
3242648,5,B000XUF6BU,"Highly recommended.  Even if it is just a ""workplace comedy,"" there is much more to it than just the comic aspects.
As a theater professional from the production end of things, it's refreshing to see a portrayal that both somewhat accurately captures the workings of a theater and the reasons theater is still a viable medium, and is able at the same time to acutely poke fun at some of the ridiculousness of ""our"" world on/behind the stage.
One of the smartest yet accessible series collections from start to finish that I have ever seen.  I will most assuredly watch it repeatedly in the years to come.",1205280000,,604,4.635514018691588
3242649,5,B000XUF6BU,"This Canadian television series is hilariously funny yet at times can be very moving. My interest was generated by the fact that I'm a Shakespeare buff, but I don't think you have to be into the Bard or even theater to enjoy S&A.  But it adds another level. The Shakespeare scenes are extremely well done.  So the show offers it all.  You will laugh and cry sometimes almost at the same time.  The writing, acting, and directing are all top level.  I cannot recommend it too highly.",1205280000,,482,4.494252873563219
3242650,4,B000XUF6BU,"I loved this series on Sundance and was so happy to be able to get the complete series. The acting and storytelling is first rate.

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because the ""special bonus"" DVD is a waste of time. The special features on the series DVD's covers the same ground and does it better. Instead of interviews of William Hutt and the series director, all we get are behind the scenes views of the production of them being filmed.",1204156800,9,451,4.369047619047619

I love this world as I grew up in a theatre repertory company from 13 to 20 years old and this captures so much of the passionate insanity!  Only one problem, the complete collection shows as being ""widescreen"" and it is not!  Why does anyone release a show without widescreen?  Buy the individual series disks or the bundle as formated for TV looks awful!",1203120000,,413,4.324675324675325

8229736,4,B000XUF6BU,"We loved the first season and liked the second season. By the third season it seemed like the writers didn't know what to do with the characters and so every one was either rewarded or punished in a head scratchingly random sort of way. Even with that, this is a smart, funny, sneaky, edgy and surprising series that took chances. Truly entertaining.",1522454400,2,350,4.661290322580645
8229737,4,B000XUF6BU,"Possibly the best TV show about the theater (not that there's a huge amount of them). Strong characters and well written dialogue. My only criticism is the tone is uneven at times, and there's some gratuitous sex scenes in it that seem quite unnecessary. That's what's keeping it from a 5-star. I'd give is 4.5 if I could.",1520380800,,322,4.568965517241379
8229738,5,B000XUF6BU,"This is a wonderful series, very funny. Especially great for fans of Shakespeare or Stratford. But why has the cost skyrocketed? I bought this 6 years ago for just under $40, and now it's 5 times that much. Increasing 30% per year is absurd.",1514505600,,241,4.5

8229743,5,B000XUF6BU,"This is the best series ever, even better than Fawlty Towers, which I've watched with pleasure dozens of times. It has terrific acting, great writing, a compelling story, and is, on top of all that, full of insights about the Shakespeare plays it deals with (Hamlet, Macbeth, Lear, Romeo and Juliet.) We watched an episode a night for 3 weeks and then just started over again. If you've ever been to the Festival in Stratford, Ontario, it's a must watch.",1489795200,,454,4.6875
