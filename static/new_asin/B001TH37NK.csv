3789635,3,B001TH37NK,"While this series is not without it's merits - some lovely undersea footage and interesting interaction with some of the native islanders - every episode I've watched so far eventually just turned into ""Masakazu goes fishing!"" I realize sea food is very important to the Japanese, and I'd imagine they are very interest in each ""is that fish edible?"" adventures. But I picture a meeting with the producers reviewing the footage. ""So, Masakazu. Looks like you cut the diving expedition to go fishing again. In fact you spent nearly all your time in Palau fishing and then eating."" So, if you'd like to watch a Japanese guy go fishing over and over this is the series for your. I find the translation of the Japanese voice over fairly hilarious - and SO earnest! I also noted several mis-identification of the fish. Oh well.",1395360000,2,822,4.755244755244755
3789636,2,B001TH37NK,"I was looking for another version of the planet ocean, but got this one. The rpice was good, so no harm. Just looking at the color and the enviroment. Not the actors.",1391126400,,166,4.21875
3789637,5,B001TH37NK,"It wasn't exactly what I was expecting- I originally thought that it was a Planet Ocean series of Nagata's that covered many different locations around the Pacific, not just Baja California- but it was still an interesting, enthusiastic show. Cheerful Nagata is a great host, and the chuckle-enducing Japanese-to-English or sometimes Spanish-to-English-to-Japanese translations of science, history, and jokes are, to me, part of the experience, and one of the reasons which I bought it. (Even the title is a slightly funny translation.) While the show has the feel of a very small-scale venture compared with many other nature shows, truly interesting and surprising things are explained and dwelt upon. The human element, too, is never forgotten, and the people who work close to the ocean are always greeted as friends; Nagata is invited onto their boats, their jobs, to their meals, and inside their homes. A good show- I'll look for episodes..",1388620800,4,947,5.2368421052631575
3789638,3,B001TH37NK,"it's a bit old... the picture quality not so good.....
I bought it because I love Baja California but the colors in the film....not so great....",1384819200,,144,4.576923076923077
3789639,4,B001TH37NK,"I must say, I loved the main narrator, Dan Green. He did a wonderful job with that terrible script! For those of you expecting a ""Discovery Channel-esque"" type of film, look elsewhere. For those who can look past the flaws of this series and appreciate the scenes (and Dan's soothing voice) then I would say give it a go. They got a lot of great footage and had a lot to share about different cultures and their relationship with the ocean.",1351382400,2,440,4.444444444444445
3789640,5,B001TH37NK,"I LOVE this series! The chosen narrators sound so unnaturally enthusiastic, it so entertaining. I also appreciate how much time is spent exploring local cultures. I wish I could be an oceanographer adventurer!",1342137600,,209,5.363636363636363
3789641,2,B001TH37NK,"I would not recommend this dvd set it is hard to follow due to the fact that 2 narrators are speaking at once ione in english and one in a foreign language, and it does not tell you what the animals are or why they are doing what you see them doing, for example it shows an eel shaking and instead of saying what type of eel it is and why it is shaking it just tells you that the eel is shaking, which is kind of rediculous considering we can see that all ready. I did not find this dvd to be informative at all.",1326585600,,512,3.839622641509434
3789642,3,B001TH37NK,"Would be a lot better if it were not for the extremely annoying music and the celestial vocalizations in the background.  The language interpreter for the Japanese oceanographer sounds like he is waving pompoms while he translates, and the narrator is a tad obnoxious.

It is too bad because it does have some great underwater scenes.",1279065600,10,334,4.946428571428571
3789643,1,B001TH37NK,"OMG, this DVD set is so poorly produced that it will make you split your side laughing!
Misleading us by putting the word ""DISCOVER"" on the front appears to be a good marketing ploy.
If you want a good laugh at hoaky voice over narration and repetitive jibberish about nothing meaningfull... ""buy this DVD set""! It's almost worth the 18 bucks for the chuckles you'll get.
Cheap Asian garbage cinematography.",1261699200,10,407,4.828571428571428
3789644,3,B001TH37NK,"This DVD set is a great elementary and middle school educational tool.  While the video quality is top notch, the background music is kind of funky as is the English translation.",1251763200,4,178,4.741935483870968

8341242,5,B001TH37NK,"I love this series of videos by Mr. Nagata, who is obviously more interested in Earth's natural wonders than fame and $$$. I know, it is not a high-budget production, and the background music is sometimes a bit odd, but there are many unique forms of sea life explained and filmed in detail, and it is refreshing that plugs for evolution are not constantly being shoved in the viewer's face. It is also wonderful to learn about fishing methods of native peoples, and the local cuisine in the region of Baja California. Mr. Nagata is game for trying any new dish he is offered while checking out the geography.",1410912000,,609,4.5963302752293576
