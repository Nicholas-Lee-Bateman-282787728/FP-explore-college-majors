This movie did something I've never experienced before; It was just the same way as I thought it would be while I read it!
The story was a little changed, but that doesn't harm the story much (except for letting out the Corleones).",1066521600,3,421,4.341772151898734

588236,5,6303013171,"I'm very glad this movie finally came out on DVD with Cimino's excellent Director's Cut, but Artisan has a history of crap DVDs, and this is no exception.
  The movie itself is excellent, the noble story of Salvatore Giuliano, who attempted a failed revolution of Sicily.  People who have problems with Christopher Lambert's performance obviously see him then immediately stop watching the movie.  His character is out of place in every aspect, he rears his horse at a woman in the window, skids across the floor like he's flying to start a dance, and continually makes a point of how different he is, Lambert seems to fit the role perfectly.  Aside from him we have John Turturro in the performance of a lifetime and an interesting contribution by Terrance Stamp.

588237,1,6303013171,"It is blatantly obvious that Artisan was only concerned with making a buck on this release. I advise anyone who is a fan of Cimino's work to avoid this dreck they call a DVD. For beginners the film is presented in full screen, pan and scan format. For anyone who is familiar with Cimino's films you know that they are all amazingly composed and shot in widescreen formats that vary from 65 to 70 mm. This film is no exception and moments such as the one where Terence Stamp's character looks on from his ivory tower through a telescope, just cries out for appropriate frame representation. Not only that but the film has several cameos by a group of method acting gnats or as most people would refer to it, overwhelmingly BAD graininess. Whole scenes seem washed out in terms of color and lighting and it is a true accomplishment to distinguish objects from one another in the locust storm of grain that envelopes each subsequent scene. Some would argue that that is what you get for a film as cheaply priced as this one but this is a travesty. I would rather have the film cleaned up, digitally remastered and presented in its original film ratio and pay a few dollars more. A caption on the back of the box sums up the overall stupidity and lack of quality execution on Artisan's behalf:""Formatted from its original version to fit your screen."" then, directly below it states:""Presented in the original 1.33:1 format in which the film was shot."" Huh? I almost got an aneurism trying to figure the logic in that. Note to Artisan:It is either formatted to fit your screen OR presented in its original format, IT CAN'T BE BOTH!

I caught this in Paris during its first week in October of 1987 and was floored by the movie.  Brilliantly literate screenplay by the uncredited Gore Vidal, with Terrance Stamp as Vidal's stnad-in.  Elegant mise-en-scene and a tight dramatic arc that I wouldn't have thought Cimino capable of.  (I'm one of the minority that hated ""The Deer Hunter"" but thouht ""Heaven's Gate"" was brilliant.)  When I got back to the United States I was shocked to find out ""The Sicilian"" had been released in a version cut by 25 minutes and was roundly trashed as incoherent.  The rumor was also out that when Fox demanded that Cimino deliver a 120 minute version, he deliberately cut it to make no sense thinking that the studio would then have no choice but to release his complete film.  But they released the deliberately sabotaged version instead.  Anybody know the truth about this?

588450,4,6303013171,"Based on the novel by Mario Puzo, with a screenplay largely written by an uncredited Gore Vidal, THE SICILIAN tells a morality tale of an eponymous hero Salvatore Giuliano (Christopher Lambert) with an unquenchable desire to improve the social conditions of his people.  Sicily had for many years been considered the poor relation of mainland Italy; in the post-1945 era in which the film is set, the territory has largely been forgotten by the Rome government.  However Giuliano rectifies that situation through a combination of violence, political machination and sheer chutzpah.  In doing so he creates enemies - so many of them that he eventually becomes a marked man.  THE SICILIAN resembles THE LEFT-HANDED GUN (based on a Vidal play) in its portrayal of an individual trying his best to buck the system and stand up both for himself and the people.  Unfortunately he inhabits a corrupt world in which the church, state and government conspire with local Mafia boss Don Masino Croce (Joss Ackland) to thwart him.  It's not just the Italians who want Giuliani dead; the Americans are also shown to be conniving in the plot, as represented by the Duchess of Crotone (Barbara Sukowa).  Michael Cimino's film shows the extent to which America had colonized post-1945 Italy, not only in terms of government but in terms of culture: the strains of Glenn Miller are frequently heard in party and/or dance sequences.  Confronted by such forces - both domestic and international - Giuliani has little or no chance of changing the social structure; his dreams of social equality through the redistribution of land remain unfulfilled.  However we admire him for his efforts.  THE SICILIAN also takes a side-swipe at the ways in which the media - the newsreels, radio and the print media - both lionizes Giuliani, while at the same time being open to conscious manipulation by Don Masino and his cronies.  The only problem with the film is a structural one; there are too many awkward cuts in the action, suggesting problems at the editing stage.",1365292800,,2040,4.970588235294118

588455,5,6303013171,"The Sicilian is inspired from a novel of Mario Puzo, of Godfather
fame, of course, and filmed by Michael Cimino. From its 1987 release
date, the entire picture was way ahead of its time. This is the case
from the many timeless aspects depicted, such as rural Sicily and
the era following the Second World War. Much kudos to the visual
quality which is excellent, the acting which is very good and the
plot which is very good, mainly for being credible.

The DVD is the Director's cut, clocking at 146 minutes, which may
seem long, but actually isn't, because of the quality and
entertainment.

The soundtrack is superb (piano, orchestral, big band, etc.) which
enhances the various moods in a highly talented manner.

The difficulty of this picture are perhaps several. First and
foremost, it's doubtful the actors (and the spectators too)
actually understand what is going on in the film, in terms of
coherence, sequence of events, from the way the actors deliver their
lines in the first hour. Several leading actors and actresses are
also blatantly French, struggling a bit with pronunciation
(Lambert, Boschi, mainly.) Some dialog is delivered with difficulty,
at times cartoonish in simplicity but this gets better after the 1st
hour.

Secondly, for those having seen the commercial cut, 30 mins are
missing from the footage, so the previous aspect was more severe.
Third, Lambert and Tururro seem to struggle at times in the first
third of the picture, appearing as an odd couple of sorts,
reminescent of Mathau and Lemmon, which is distracting. Fourth,
Lambert should never have worn a trenchcoat in the last third of
the picture. Also, an actor should never be hyper-clean shaven,
combed hair, with clean and ironed white shirt and pants just coming
from a shower, when presented to the audience as a guerilla, living
in the mountains with 50 bandits, and sleeping in caves.
Fortunately, this only occurred 1 time in the movie, but there is no
doubt that Lambert brought a big non-Italian, urban - city feel to
the role. Lastly, there are no subtitles on the DVD.

Lambert, who plays a Sicilian Robin Hood called Giuliano, is an
enigma of sorts as an actor, as he has his high points and luke-warm
moments, but overall, despite many who will underestimate his acting
greatly, actually he brings a personal touch to the action,
appealing to the youth segment, that is often necessary for profit
reasons. Joss Ackland, playing the president of a Sicilian province
as Masino, is excellent in his demeanor, rapport built with the
audience, and credibile in the scenes. Turturro seems to get a lot
better over the course of the movie, as he is better able to portray
himself as a local ethnic, blending with the supporting actors,
playing down his presence perfectly.

Clearly, Puzo wanted to guarantee an American flavor to this
picture, so an American jeep is shown, references to the American GI
presence in Italy brought up. In a non-sequitur, there is nudity
with Barbara Sukowa, from a bubble bath scene, and another
non-sequitur, when Lambert robs Sukowa along with other rich guests
at the dinner table, and beds her shortly after, eagerly, willingly.
A special performance, is by Giulia Boschi, playing Lambert's
sensitive girlfriend.

The essence of the picture, is that following WWII, a region in
Sicily is impassioned with Communism, as the peasants do not partake
of the vast food, wealth generated by the lands, commerce and
industry of the region. Masino, seeing this, secretly hires a
delusional local, believing himself to be a Robin Hood, promising to
reverse the injustice, by confiscating land and giving it to the
poor. Of course, Masino's Hegelian goal of scaring the population
(through Lambert's bandit conduct) so they will run back to him and
vote for him, is coupled with a strategy of physically eliminating
Marxist voters at a peaceful march.

The visual beauty of the picture is vast, as all the critical time
pieces are shown of the era (music, automobiles, clothes worn,
demeanor of the population) as well as the medieval, European
architecture of a small village and country side, such as vineyards,
large estates.

Homicidal behavior is carried out, at times, in an unconvincing,
manner, such as those of the local father, barber, etc. Some humor
doesn't work, such as the line about the dream of locals in opening
a pizzaria in New Jersey.

As with his other novels, Puzo has the courage of showing ceremonies
of marriages, funerals, public processions, as well as joyful
moments at dancehalls and dinners among rich crowds to balance out
the sorrow of other moments. He also underlines the 3 powers, 1 of
which a citizen must adhere to: church, state or mob. After taking
out 4 big landowners, the story makes clear that Robin Hood conduct
is not only misguided, but irrational and isolating, as the poor do
not want land to toil on, but money.

Creating a movie from a book, is a huge challenge, like an orchestra
reading sheet music and playing a composer's musical intent. As
such, the movie's inspiration seems a bit blurred, but nevertheless
very professional, timeless, and satisfying.",1270166400,,5132,4.9351100811123985
588456,3,6303013171,"The movie was ok, they could have gotten a lot better director to make the movie.

588457,1,6303013171,"Wow.
Had this been another place and time, those responsible for this abomination would be flogged in public.
The problem (among many problems) with movies of this sort is that some men and women seem to feel that as
long as one can slap a stupid (and horrendously unauthentic) Italian accent onto an actor, grease his hair
back and have him walk the cobblestone streets of Sicily (or what can pass for it)- abra cadabra, you have
created an Italian character. How weak, ridiculous and insulting. The memory of Salvatore Giugliano - a giant of a
man with the heart of Lion- is tarnished by such poor acting and horrible writing. I could barely wait to see this
picture after reading Mario Puzo's novel, ""The Sicilian"", which, though part fiction, paints an accurate portrayal ofSalvatore's life- and death. Then I shot out to see the movie.
What a dissaointment.
The book is piercing, riveting, and ultimately, haunting. I found myself thinking
about the events many mornings after I had put the book down the night before. In the span of ten or so years, I re-read it three times, and three times, I was overwhelmed. If you wish to go to Sicily, the land of fiery passions
and unrepressed emotions yet cant physically get there, read the book. If you wish to see just how inept american filmakers can be, then this cartoon flick is for you.
Frankly, Bugs Bunny did a much better job at being an Italian when, in one of his most memorable cartoons, he
pushes one of his cartoon pals into a boiling pot of water, then walks away with a red and white dishrag draped
over his arm singing ""ATTSA MATTA, ATTSA MATTA, HEY ! ATTSA MATTA FOR YOU""!

Rent SALVAORE GIUGLIANO, the Italian Version, and meet the real Salvatore.

588458,3,6303013171,"Christopher Lambert was all wrong for Salvatore Giuliano. Also too many liberties were taken. I understand Mario Puzo's book had a girlfriend in Giuliano's life (not true, after he became a bandit). The parts that are true: Aspanu Pisciotta (good guy for the part--resembles him, too) did kill Giuliano, was poisoned in prison. The massacre at Portella della Ginestra occurred but only 7 died and 32 injured, Giuliano had indeed ordered ""only shoot above their heads"" but Passatempo went crazy and shot people and animals. Giuliano really did execute the barber for betrayal. A Duke was really kidnapped but so were dozens more including nobility. The ring he took was the Duke's and not the Duchess's.  S.G. did shoot five mafia dons (a no-no in Sicily, especially with old-time dons, whom these were), which precipitated his downfall, and the Portella della Ginestra massacre was the final straw.

Among the most ridiculous parts were (1) when the girlfriend and Giuliano do a wild silly awkward jitterbug in public, after he announces to all who he is, (2) a badly scripted bedroom scene with the Duchess, and (3) in real life no one would dare talk to a mafia don the way the Duchess did on the dance floor.

Most of Chris's lines consist of Giuliano talking about himself in the third person and always introducing himself.  They could have done so much better, i.e., mention Giuliano was actually made a colonel of the Sicilian EVIS, and they could have made him more credible.

OK, so the film is based on Puzo's book, and not on the true Giuliano. But the liberties they did take were what ruined the show. He was a bandit, had maybe 50 members in his band, but he was also considered a political hero, a legend. He was a ""Robin Hood"" type.  The book was obviously fiction with some facts and (deliberately?) misspells Giuliano's name as ""Guiliano"" (then it would be pronounced ""Gweeliano"" not ""Jooliano"", right?)

The duke was a sad comic (and is dealt with as best Terence Stamp, a great actor, could--he was wasted on a bad part). The American Duchess's lines were ludicrous and the actress playing her was lousy, especially after she opened her mouth. She was unnecessary to the film. I get the impression Giuliano himself would never have wasted his time consorting with such a stupid, shallow self-serving woman. In short, all are miscast except the guy who played Pisciotta, almost a dead-on image of the real thing. Speaking of him, he did not shoot Giuliano in obedience to him--he confessed to shooting him in his sleep on orders of Scelba, Minister of the Interior.

The Sicilian scenery is hauntingly beautiful (if it is even Sicily!) and that's about it, so I gave it three stars.  For a fine film on the real Giuliano I recommend ""Salvatore Giuliano"" directed by Francesco Rosi (1960)filmed only ten years after the actual death of the man. It is on DVD as well, and best seen on digital. It is in black and white but it is shimmering in Sicilian sun and mountain glory. It is an example of neo-realism, is faithful, and entertaining as well. It is thoughtfully done and I gave it a review, too.

I understand the American audience's need for sensationalism, but there is a line that should not be crossed.  ""The Sicilian"" movie had no class. It was miscast, badly scripted, and did not do the real Giuliano justice.

That is why it failed at the box office.",1231459200,2,3380,4.729591836734694
588518,1,6303013171,"No joke, this is two hours of amateurish stuff, which cannot really be called cinema without upsetting someone up there.
I just went back to see some of the scenes of this movie again because they are so ridiculous I wanted to have another go!

So, let's start in the right order (warning, contains some spoilers, but you're not really going to watch this movie, are you?):

- The fact that the movie was entirely in English should have given it away, very funny to hear would-be sicilians talking to each other in English.

- Past that, we encounter the limping professor. An attempt to add a sinister touch to an otherwise meaningless character. Very amateurish.

- Then came signs and inscriptions throughout the movie, all in English (things like Sicilian Region, Minister of Law and Justice). Made up stuff not corresponding to reality.

- Then the absurd way in which most of the actors talk, in English but very slowly, which makes their acting ridiculous. I guess another attempt to make the movie sound more 'Sicilian'...

- Then the plot, disjointed and difficult to follow. Considering that the script writers had three stories to copy from (the original Salvatore Giuliano movie, the book itself and the true story of Salvatore Giuliano) one would have expected more.

- Then comes the funny stuff, some of the scenes are just absurd! My favourite is the dancing of the Duchess with the Don, particularly the last bit, when she dances around him rolling her arms!
And the 'rape', when right in the middle of a robbery, Giuliano ends up in the room with the Duchess and whilst they are there she rapes him! Couldn't avoid feeling sorry for Giuliano's mates in the other room waiting with the goods just robbed!
Also, to add to the overall madness, Giuliano's girlfriend addresses him by surname, rather than by his first name Salvatore (see the scene when the barber gets shot).

- Finally, some of the dialogs, which I took the trouble of transcribing for your enjoyment.
Scene 1 - Giuliano decides to kidnap the Prince and take him to the mountains. He sends his mate to get him:
KIDNAPPER: Your excellency, Salvatore Giuliano respectfully requests your company for a visit to his mountains.
PRINCE: May I take my umbrella?
KIDNAPPER: Of course excellency, but when we go outside don't try and run.
PRINCE: I don't run, not since school, I have asthma.
KIDNAPPER (referring to music being played by the Prince): It's very beautiful.
PRINCE: Yeees [with really funny accent]. Scarlatti. He was born near here. He had asthma too, I think.
I don't suppose it's raining?
KIDNAPPER: No excellency.

Later in the mountains, here is an extract from the dialogue, it's the Prince speaking:
""You don't hate me, you hate not being me. But if you were born me you would have never been you, so you could take my money, my life, but you could never be me.""

- To top it all up, the movie ends with the silhouette of Giuliano, on his horse, with an unrealistically blown up sun setting in the background. (maybe some science fiction effect thrown in for good measure?, or perhaps another attempt to make the movie more 'Sicilian' by showing how big the sun is in Sicily?)
Jokes apart, it's not the size of the sun that tops it all up, it's the fact that Giuliano died a few scenes earlier and from the horse on top of the hill he is watching his own funeral...

Warning: although it's not exactly boring (just poor), it goes over the two hours mark.

Watch it for a laugh, or for pure escapism...",1219017600,10,3496,4.666666666666667
588519,2,6303013171,"Salvatore Giuliano has been poorly served by the two films made about him, albeit in very different ways. Francesco Rosi's Salvatore Giuliano sidelines the legendary Sicilian bandit completely and distorts much of the events around him to support a political agenda despite posing as a semi-documentary dramatisation. Despite a few good scenes, it almost seems as if the contradictions in Giuliano's story dictate it should best be told by an outsider with no political axe to grind.

On the surface, that theory is soundly kicked in the groin, beaten to a pulp and left for dead in a ditch by The Sicilian, along with Desperate Hours the only Michael Cimino film that really IS as bad as critics said Heaven's Gate was. This film is so far from the truth that only the addition of flying saucers and death rays could make it any more outlandish. This Giuliano is a Christ-like martyr and hero of the people caught smuggling grain to the starving (in reality he was selling on the black market), buying land for the peasants (Giuliano had no interest in land reform), marries the sister of a communist (Giuliano didn't even have a girlfriend), hijacking troop trains, crucifying priests and even trying to stop the massacre at Portella della Ginestre (shamefully blamed in the film on Terranova, who was one of the few of Giuliano's band who it's definitely known did NOT fire a single shot on that day). No sign of the American occupation, no mention of the Separatist movement, no sense of how Giuliano operated: just Hollywood hokum, and badly executed hokum at that.

Of course, a film can be a total fantasy and still be enjoyable, as anyone who's ever seen a Jesse James or Robin Hood movie knows. Unfortunately, The Sicilian also has the disadvantage of being an astonishing piece of crap for most of its running time. It's full of atrocities, from Joss Ackland's comedy Mafia don (his dance with Barbara Sukowa is one of cinema's great this-isn't-working-but-just-grit-your-teeth-and-try-to-get-through-it-as-quickly-as-possible acting moments), an embarrassing acappella bebop mountain wedding (dig those crazy jitterbugging bandits, man), clunking dialog (""They'll never trust you again."" ""Yes. Sad, isn't it?"") and situations, a terrible grinning performance from Christophe Lambert and a has-to-be-seen-to-be-disbelieved final shot of Salvatore rearing up on a horse against the setting sun at his own funeral. The uncut version actually is worse than the edited version released in the US, giving more screentime to Barbara Sukowa's atrocious `American' aristocrat (""Ja, ay em verr Amerikahn""), who even gets to rape the hero during a robbery at her villa, and amplifying the inept Messianic parallels to a comic degree. There are hints at ambition, with a couple of scenes that threaten to work and the odd good line that one suspects comes from Gore Vidal's rewrite, but it's just another Hollywood mafia movie, with Ackland's Don protecting and ultimately betraying Giuliano, the son he never had. This was, after all, originally a semi-sequel to The Godfather (in Mario Puzo's novel Michael Corleone tries to arrange Giuliano's escape) until the producers found out Paramount owned the screen rights to Corleone characters and had to write them out. Unfortunately, they threw out the baby with the bathwater.

For those who want the film in its original 2.35:1 ratio rather than Artisan's fullframe panned-and-scanned version, the European PAL DVD is the uncut version in a good 2.35:1 widescreen transfer that showcases the fine photography.

I enjoyed it for a slow-paced mafia movie in the obscure Cimino style. THE DVD though, FOR THOSE WIDESCREEN LOVERS OUT THERE, STATES (on the back cover) that it ""IS PRESENTED IN THE FORMAT IN WHICH THE FILM WAS SHOT OF 1:33:1. STANDARD ""old fashion TV"" FORMAT. I believe this is most deffintaly a lie. Why do I say this? Because, just a week ago it was on the High Definition Channel--INHD Channel, and they showed it in a TRUE ASPECT RATIO of WIDESCREEN 2:35:1, Cinnmascope.  There is noway they could've shown the movie in that format if Ciminio had it filmed in standard format, AS STATED ON THE BACK COVER OF THE DVD.SO, THE DVD IS PRESENTED IN STANDARD FORMAT, while in reality IT WAS FILMED IN WIDESCREEN.SO, I give the DVD 2 stars just for decent picture quality & mediocre sound. The people who released this DVD version of the movie I believe lies when they state it was filmed in standard format when IT WAS FILMED IN WIDESCREEN.Maybe someday another company will release the orginal Widescreen version - THE WAY IT WAS SHOWN IN THEATRES.I was fortunate enough to tape it on the high def channel and get my copy of the movie in it's ORGINAL WIDESCREEN FORMAT.",1084492800,32,1284,4.510729613733906

588525,1,6303013171,"Absolutely some of the worst acting and story continuity I have ever seen.  Christopher Lambert is not the only bad actor here - Joss Ackland as Don Masino and Barbara Sukowa as the Duchess are not much better.  The dialogue can be so hard to follow, and the film jumps around so much, that towards the end of the movie you can barely (if at all) understand what's going on.  Instead of spending more time on the ""why"" and ""how"" of Giuliano's campaign for Sicilian revolution, this film wastes time on smaller, less important scenes.  One in particular, where Giuliano is robbing the Duchess of her jewels, and ends up frolicking in bed with her, is absolutely excruciating to watch - the acting and dialogue is that bad.  Don't waste 2 1/2 hours of your life on this.",1082505600,6,768,4.536231884057971
588526,1,6303013171,"What a terrible movie and a waste of talent. Trying to be another Godfather flick, but falling way short. There is some nice cinematography and a musical score that starts out promising but ends up being grating. The worst and most insurmountable problem is, naturally, Christopher Lambert. He can't act, doesn't look or sound Italian (let alone Sicilian) and is too old for the part (Guliano is supposed to be very young -- everyone comments on this -- and is compared to Alexander the Great, while Lambert is clearly in his mid-thirties). A OK enough actor for action films, he is way out of his depth here. Also, the always excellent John Turturro makes him look awful feeble. What power-that-be in the casting department decided on Lambert as the lead and NOT Turturro -- who looks and is of Italian ancestry? There is some kind of interesting story here about the modern history of Sicily after WWII, and the struggle between the church, government, rich landowners, poor peasants and communists...but darned if I could make out what it was. It was buried under a barrage of odd accents -- some American, some ""fake"" Italian, some generic ""European"" -- and dialogue that stinks. I hung on to the dogged end of this long (uncut version) flick, but I was wasting my time. It didn't improve or get any clearer. A movie to be avoided.",1071446400,3,1335,4.733905579399142

7840102,1,6303013171,"When I saw this film on first release back in 1987 I was warmly disposed towards its director Michael Cimino. Like most people I had been stunned by The Deerhunter and unlike most people I had also loved Heavens Gate. I responded well to his debut feature Thunderbolt and Lightfoot and rated highly Year of the Dragon, his resurrection from the dead after his career had seemed to have finished with the Heavens Gate dbcle which sank a Hollywood studio and made him persona non grata in the film business. I remain stunned by that films exciting pace, brilliantly directed action sequences and Mickey Rourkes superb central turn. I watched The Sicilian then determined to see it in a good light and I thought it had merit despite obvious flaws. Returning to it 30 years later I realize I was wrong. Actually, its a truly awful movie with no merit whatsoever.

The main problem is that Cimino gets the tone all wrong. Based on Mario Puzos spin-off from his own Godfather novel, the film is based on the life of the infamous Sicilian mountain bandit Salvatore Giuliano, but instead of either examining the political complexity of this troubled figure as Francesco Rosi did in his famous 1962 film Salvatore Giuliano, or pacing an exciting gangster tale in the shape of a thriller  la The Godfather, Cimino opts for kindergarten mythologizing with the fiery rebel turned into a mixture of Robin Hood stealing from the rich in order to give to the poor and Jesus Christ sacrificing himself for the sake of everyone at the hands of his Judas-like brother. The portrait of Sicily is simplified right down with each character obviously a cypher expressing one idea only which denies any kind of believability or character empathy from the audience.

Theres a fine cast but they cant do anything with this kind of over-schematic tosh. Christopher Lambert (he of the dark staring eyes and fine tousled hair) smolders from beginning to end in a one-note performance as the dashing figment of some bored middle aged housewifes wet dream; Barbara Sukowa (she of the blond flowing hair, tight buttocks and pert sit up and say hello breasts which are displayed in the manner of a TV commercial) is the spoilt rich American duchess who fancies a bit of rough Mills & Boone-style and gets it; John Turturro (looking understandably discomforted) is the loving brother/disciple who turns Judas. Sicilian society is dominated by three elements underlined with thunderous obviousness  the church represented by the Cardinal of Palermo (Richard Venture looking good in fancy dress), the landed aristocracy encapsulated by Prince Borsa (Terence Stamp trying his best to escape the Burt Lancaster [of Viscontis The Leopard] straightjacket in which the script casts him) and the Mafia in the shape of Don Croce (Joss Ackland obviously enjoying himself perhaps knowing the folly in which he is involved), the supposedly hardened gangster capo who sheds a ridiculous sentimental tear for the son he never had when Giuliano is killed. Historical events are twisted in cavalier disregard for the facts (Cimino ignoring Giulianos guilt in the machine-gunning of innocent communists and expecting us to believe his wife would stick to him despite the murder of her beloved brother), and everything is wrapped up in a forgettable score from David Mansfield (producer Joann Carellis husband) and soft focus lush cinematography (Alex Thomson) which embalms the film in soap suds. Shot on location in Sicily with his trademark leisurely landscape sequences Cimino undoubtedly had Visconti and Bertolucci in mind, but he ends up with a cross between Mills & Boone and everyday TV soap opera, but overblown with ridiculous portentousness.
