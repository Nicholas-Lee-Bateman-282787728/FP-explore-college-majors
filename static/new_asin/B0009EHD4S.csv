2281908,5,B0009EHD4S,"I highly recommend this, if you like foreign films.  It's English subtitled.  I don't usually like comedies, but found this one very good.  You will see Roy Dupuis as an actor comfortable in his profession and quite good at comedy.  A real change from his ""Michael"" character on Le Femme Nikita.  All of the actors did a wonderful job and the plot was humorous.  Great movie.",1162080000,4,375,4.606060606060606

8059434,5,B0009EHD4S,"This is a great movie. I first bought this on VHS when the Lafemme Nikita series was on in the late 1990's. Roy Dupuis became a favorite with me and I bought most of his films.
This movie is so funny. The cast is great and the screenplay is really good. I laugh myself silly whenever I watch this.",1430352000,,297,4.0508474576271185

8059438,5,B0009EHD4S,"This is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Roy Dupuis is so darn cute in it, too! Loved the characters and the plot. The mom's attitude was a big surprise and made things even more challenging for the main character! I don't speak French, and so had to read the subtitles... did not take away from the movie at all. I would recommend this movie for a rowdy girl's night, a bridal shower or just for a good time laughing. Love does win out in the end!",1391817600,,460,4.122222222222222

8059440,5,B0009EHD4S,"This movie is absolutely funny. I enjoyed it so much. I enjoyed Roy Dupuis in his role, of course he is his sexy self and as talented as he always is. I don't know the other actors, but they were equally funny and talented. The movie was overall a great purchase for me and I did not mind the subtitles at all. You will totally laugh your a.. off! It is worth a look see. Try it you'll love it!",1355875200,,394,3.9375
8059441,3,B0009EHD4S,This was a fun film that Roy Dupuis did back in 1996(release?). About a man who would do anything to hide his financial problems from his wife. It makes you wonder what would you do to keep up public appearance?,1281571200,,211,4.3
