The acting is very good, the story line is better and the photography is the best. The music score is amazingly well integrated into the movie. It is not easy to have Mozart music on a 90's sex comedy set in Mexico City. However it works well, very well.

My memories of this movie are always of Claudia Ramirez and Mozart's Gran Partita.

I would say that this movie stands a bit apart from all other Cuaron films. It is set in Mexico about Mexican midclass pleople and it has a freshness not found in all his other movies, which, I agree, have some other and even more important virtues as well.",1165104000,4,756,4.3546099290780145
2628756,5,B000H5U5R6,This is not totally about aids nor does it make light of aids really. It's just a part of the plot of this great dark romantic comedy that even a romantic comedy hater can enjoy! Yes it has people attempting suicide but in hilarious ways!! If anything the wonderfully eccentric actions of the main character Tomas Tomas was worth viewing the movie in itself!,1161993600,6,358,4.609375
2628757,4,B000H5U5R6,"I remember seeing this movie back when it was just released thinking it was quite funny and innovative.
Years later, I just seen again and although I find it a little nave and more mainstream than the first time, I daresay it is worth it. The Japanese businessmen are really funny!",1388966400,,281,4.529411764705882
2628758,2,B000H5U5R6,"Very good production, mediocre acting (except for Daniel Gimnez Cacho), abuse of stereotypes and misunderstanding of the VIH and AIDS meaning. Silly but cute",1386288000,,157,5.583333333333333
2628759,4,B000H5U5R6,"I kind of love Alfonso Cuaron's style.  He has such visual presence as a director, and he understands the way to craft tension in all the right areas so as to propel a story forward with gusto.  When I saw `Solo con tu Pareja' (translated `Only with Your Partner') was Cuaron's first film, I jumped all over it.  This is very different tonally than his more recognizable films, but his signature way with tension is expertly used to play the comedic aspects of this film in the right way.

`Solo con tu Pareja' tells the story of a playboy named Tomas who loves to sleep (unprotected) with various women.  He sees them as conquests and prides himself in his `abilities'.  He flirts with danger (as is seen by his streaking to get the paper in the morning) but when he is faced with consequences he frays rather speedily.  On a night with a sexy nurse, Tomas winds up getting in his own way as he juggles the nurse and his boss and fails to come through for his new date.  When the nurse discovers WHY he couldn't perform for her, she exacts revenge by altering his recent test results to show that he had contracted AIDS.  This spirals out of control as Tomas decides to end his own life, but a beautiful neighbor who has stolen his heart stands in the way of him actually going through with it.

The film thrives because of three main attributes.  First and foremost, Cuaron understands how to layer this film in a way that keeps the audience glued.  Second, Daniel Gimenez Cacho is just fantastic as Tomas, capturing his carefree negligence and childlike immaturity as well as his overwhelming sense of paranoia as he begins to become swallowed up by his impending (assumed) doom.  Thirdly, we have stunning cinematography by master-lenser Emmanuel Lubezki, who makes each frame sing with intended emotional highs.

The script is a little preposterous, and the obvious `love at first sight' clich is in full swing, and yet it becomes somewhat edgy and fresh thanks to the themes that infiltrate each witty conversation (this is, above all else, a comedy that centers around AIDS).  The supporting cast is also very good, especially the sexy Dobrina Liubomirova and Luis de Icaza, who plays Tomas's neighbor who lives rather vicariously through his escapades.

It's a comedy and isn't what one might expect when first hearing that this is from the same man that directed `Children of Men' or `Y tu Mama Tambien', but if you look closely you'll see the similarities.",1339113600,,2466,4.7
2628760,5,B000H5U5R6,"I just picked up this video because I needed to watch any Spanish movie for my Conversation Spanish class. I loved it! Definitely the best Spanish-language movie out of the 10 or so I've seen as of now.

The movie follows a ""player"" in Mexico City named Tomas Tomas, who gets into sexy and hilarious situations with the women he woos. One of them, a nurse who works for his doctor and best friend, vows revenge against him after a bad date. (The bad date was sexy and hilarious, though.)

I liked Alfonso Cuaron's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Y-Tu-Mama-Tambien/dp/B00005JL57/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Y Tu Mama Tambien</a>, but I LOVED this movie. The movie is full of slapstick comedy that can be understood whether or not you speak Spanish. And it's a unique look at the life of middle-class Mexicans, especially in a time when often all we hear are of the stereoypical laborers and illegal immigrants. I wish there were more movies like this one!",1288828800,,996,5.2578616352201255
2628761,5,B000H5U5R6,"Una de las pelculas ms divertidas del cine mexicano con las actuaciones majestuosas de Claudia Ramrez y Daniel Gimnz Cacho, en una obra que la puedes disfrutar miles de veces y siempre encuentras algo nuevo.",1210464000,2,207,4.942857142857143
2628762,5,B000H5U5R6,"In his madcap debut film, the Mexican director of ""Y Tu Mama Tambien"" somehow fuses a bawdy farce in the grand Hollywood tradition with a modern commentary on HIV and mortality--and makes it work. What begins as a room-to-room sex romp--with Toms clambering along catwalks between his apartment and that of his friend Mateo (Luis de Icaza), who's helping out in the seduction game--soon takes a sobering turn as the bird-dogging bachelor finds himself wrapped in the arms of both love and death. Assured and lively, fluidly paced and buoyantly acted, ""Solo con tu pareja"" is a slapstick comedy with a zesty Latin heart.",1184630400,10,619,4.961538461538462
2628763,5,B000H5U5R6,this is a great movie. its funny and original. the screenplay and cinematography are really good and it shows a great view of mexico city. its an extremely funny love story that i cant stop watching.,1181865600,4,199,4.555555555555555
2628764,5,B000H5U5R6,"Excelent re-Issue of one classic of the New Mexican Cinema. I was a big fan of these movie and the careful re-issue of it did not desapoint me.

Great quality in the transfer and excelletn extras.",1171929600,7,196,4.444444444444445
2628765,4,B000H5U5R6,"In his debut feature, Alfonso Cuaron, a leading figure in the current renaissance of Mexican cinema, presents a mostly amusing contemporary take on Mozart's ""Don Giovanni."" His protagonist Tomas is a modern, Mexico City variant of that unreflective womanizer who recurs in all times and cultures. Like Mozart's Don, Tomas experiences mostly embarrassing comic encounters and little erotic success during the part of his life treated in the film, and at the end he too has a comeuppance, though one more in line with the forgiving, screwball comedy spirit of Blake Edwards or Ernst Lubitsch than that of Mozart's ""dramma giocoso.""
If the film has a weakness, I would say it's the prolongation of Tomas' early farcical encounters which threaten to grow tiresome and don't fully blend with the film's subtext of social criticism.
Otherwise, this is a movie of considerable merit, and it heralds the future career of a highly talented filmmaker.
Praise should go as well to the beautiful photography and the skillful comic acting of the principal players.
The Criterion DVD is, happily enough, accompanied by an extended interview with the Cuaron brothers and their star Daniel Gimenez Cacho. It is distinguished by wit and charm.",1167436800,4,1226,5.165829145728643
2628766,2,B000H5U5R6,"This film is one of superior production design and cinematography!  (Emmanuel Lubezski is a modern master!)  Unfortunately, ""Solo Con Tu Pareja"" is an exceedingly farfetched, dumbfoundingly unfunny, and overall haphazard mish-mash of a film.  I could barely crack a smile (nor could my viewing companions) as this disappointingly overrated, spastic piece of fourth-rate Almodovar-like inspiration veered from overwrought scenario contrivances to downright despicable characters.  The inclusion of ""ribald slapstick"" didn't make matters much better.  There would be no way that I would've guessed -- if I had not known -- that this film was made by the same director of the magnificently evocative, insouciant and melancholy ""Y Tu Mama Tambien.""  I did not care one iota for any of the characters in ""Solo Con Tu Pareja"" -- and the one character that I did (""Clarissa""), turned from mysterious to virago before story's end.  (In comparison, this film's womanizing ""Tomas"" is a far cruder and gaspingly unfunny version of Daniel Day-Lewis' superior ""Tomas"" in ""The Unbearable Lightness of Being"" -- a far and away superior Criterion title!)  In short, this film was not ""entertaining,"" and I couldn't help but feel that in Almodovar's hands this storyline could've been pulled off.  Nonetheless, as a ""first film"" for director Cuaron, I will say that he does, indeed -- along with his production designer and cinematographer -- have a great eye for balance and aesthetics.  The writer, however, should be shot....

Of course, this is simply one man's opinion that means absolutely nothing to Cuaron's directorial talents.",1165190400,,1619,5.359683794466403

8136851,5,B000H5U5R6,"This movie is very funny, but if you don't speak Spanish you probably won't understand most of the humor from the subtitles; and even if you do speak Spanish but don't know Mexican slang and the chilango accent and sense of humor you will be missing most of the irony and double entendre.
