8156115,3,B000KF0DMU,"It's like an old Abbot and Costello movie, but with out Abbot. Very silly and campy. Made me laugh.",1490572800,,99,4.2631578947368425

8156121,3,B000KF0DMU,"The slapstick comedy is okay. I enjoy it more from Cantinflas or La India Maria. Still though, it was decent enough that I ended watching until the end",1483920000,,151,4.428571428571429

8156123,3,B000KF0DMU,"In Capulina Contra Los Vampiros(1971), the bumbling, simple-minded Capulina(Gaspar Henaine) is lost in the woods when it starts raining. Luckily, he finds shelter in an old mansion. However, the mansion is populated with blood sucking vampires! This film does have a dopey, campy sense of fun, but there's no way one can call this avant garde or art.
Also, some of the sound effects are overdone. Still, sexpot(and real life showgirl) Rossy Mendoza is delightful as a Mexican version of Vampira. She'd turn on Charles Adams(creator of The Addams Family). As in Ghostbusters(1984) and Mr. Vampire(1985), this film does a seamless job blending horror and comedy together. CCLV is perfect for a Halloween party.",1236988800,,708,5.219298245614035
