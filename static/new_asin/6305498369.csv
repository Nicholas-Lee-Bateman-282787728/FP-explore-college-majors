I was star struck seeing the actors walking around and also remember seeing Henry Winkler there but not sure that i remember him being in the movie!!!",1416787200,,329,4.076923076923077
7890533,5,6305498369,"My family and I love this movie; I remember when it aired on Channel 5 back in the late 80's.  It was funny then and just as funny now.  When I told my mom I got this video she shouted ""what about mine!"", so I will be ordering another copy or two (my siblings love this as well).  Thank you for making this available.",1342656000,,317,3.921875
7890534,5,6305498369,"This Movie is actually very good. Very easy going, very funny, and very entertaining. There are some great scenes, and some great lines that I still have not forgotten since I first watched this in the 90s! Trust me, it is simple comedy, but you'll enjoy it.",1303516800,,258,4.51063829787234
7890535,5,6305498369,"I first saw it on television and I thought it was very funny.  Clifton Davis as an over-protective father is excellent!  Michelle Thomas (may she rest in peace) has a great performance as Sally, Jim's (Kadeem Hardison) ex-girlfriend.  You will be laughing all the way to the end of the movie!",1058745600,2,292,4.686274509803922
