3871691,4,B00283QELG,"My 11 year old son picked this movie off our prime instant movie plan. (I wish more new releases were available in the kids/family section)  And at first I thought it was kind of goofy.  But my 11 year old boy and 8 year old daughter were mesmerized by this film.  And while it is for certain a kids movie, it also provided some good laughs for me also.

as far as HD - the quality was not that spectacular.  It was very grainy when in full screen on my 60"" TV.  But I have not had issues in the past with over prime movies.",1392595200,,524,3.942857142857143

Also, stick around thru the end of the credits for an additional scene. Thanks, from me, to all the people who allowed them to use your stuff or parody them. Helped make it great.  Honestly, I bought the movie because of Danielle, whom I met back in March @ Horror Hound Weekend.  She was really sweet so I am slowly buying her stuff.  I was expecting a kids movie.  However, it turned into more of a movie like FANBOYS for me.  Enjoy.",1347062400,,564,4.137614678899083
3871701,5,B00283QELG,"In response to a previous reviewer who obviously had an aneurism watching this piece-o-crap! I send my condolences, but must disagree.

Yes! While this film is horrible, slashing the audience with some of the worst parodies imaginable, it does have a certain charm in the mind vacuuming horror of it all. Kinda like watching the Hindenburg. You see the flames, feel the emotion, and yet say to yourself, ""Stupid Germans... Hydrogen... -snark- MORON!!!"". Honestly, if you are of an intellectual inclination, you might actually enjoy the shear propensity of the ""epic fail"".

Yes! I'm giving a movie that has the capacity to liquidate brain cells a 5 star rating. [And, in case you ask, I did buy it, and watch it all the way to the credits--laughing my ass off at the degree of stupidity it provided] WHY? See 'Refuge in Audacity': [...] for clarification. Basically, this movie is so ""epic fail"" that you can't help laughing that someone actually invested money to make it--let alone serialized it as a ""Hit Film"". It's a type of genera cult classic that you have to understand to love. If you want a movie that will cause your geek friends to fall over laughing in droves from the outrageously ""fail"" jokes this film provides, the horrendously bad, the gosh off malady of the movie world--the director of this actually makes George Lucas' prequels good, and I mean that in the all caps ""EPIC"" kind of way. Astounding!--then, check this film out.

So, as it is to say, DO NOT get this film if you want an enjoyable film that provides Epic Jokes and Mel Brooks style Parody or for that matter a classic epic comic book movie; go watch&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Captain-America-The-First-Avenger-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo-Digital-Copy/dp/B005IZLPMY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Captain America: The First Avenger (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo + Digital Copy)</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Spaceballs-Two-Disc-Blu-ray-DVD-Combo/dp/B001UN1KVE/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Spaceballs (Two-Disc Blu-ray/DVD Combo)</a>&nbsp;or even any one of the many great comic book movies or comedies out there, don't inflict your kids to the festering madness that is bad movies. However, if you want to see even Adam West make fun of himself in the most pathetic way possible (Damn! He's good!), where even the actors know how bad the film is, then watch this. I cannot in good conscious or reason believe these people didn't realize how utterly stupid this film would be. It is in no uncertain terms the worst film I have ever been witness too, and for that I thank them. Talk about hysterical EPIC FAIL! It's like watching paint dry in slow motion IMAX in 3D. The only thing worse would be... Sorry, I can't think... Mind melts from the mere glimpse of anything worse. ;)

Seriously! Just watch. If you survive, you will die of laughter at the stupidity. If you don't, then you have died well.

This will make a great gag party movie for ""what to do when you haven't had a good laugh in a while and don't mind risking a few brain cells in effigy to wrongness"". For great humor and parody intended to be that, see first order comedy and stuff like Mel Brooks. If all else fails, it makes a great gift for people you otherwise dislike.

This film causes even dead brain cells to immediately jump alive and run screaming out of the nearest port hole. Yum... I do love the smell of burn gray matter in the morning.

Enjoy~!",1315008000,4,3504,5.202127659574468
3871702,1,B00283QELG,"I saw this movie advertised on another DVD I recently ordered. I am a huge superhero fan, and thought if I could get this cheap; I'd give it a shot. I thought I was lucky when I did get it cheap at Amazon. I wasn't. This movie is HORRIBLE! Though I have wasted enough time merely watching this movie, in the interest of the public good, I decided to spend a little more time here critiquing it with the hope of possibly sparing someone else some viewing agony.

AVOID! AVOID! AVOID!

This movie aspires to be like the recent parody movies ""Epic Movie"" or ""Date Movie"", only for kids. Those movies stink, but this movie is far far worse a film.

Looking at other reviews, I cannot believe that some people gave this garbage 5 stars. They must be related to someone in the film or have a stake in the profits. Simply saying ""It's for kids!"" does not excuse the poor writing and direction of this nightmarish catastrophe of a film. There are many low budget kids' films written intelligently that are entertaining. This is not one of them.

What makes me so angry is that the film has a good premise. Someone in a costume stops a mugging and is arrested for using overwhelming force. They assume he is a superhero, so they sentence him to become a member of a super team in training to better learn to use his ""powers"". So much possibility is there. But every single scene is sluggish, awkward and dull. The mediocre special effects of this film (which are actually not that bad) could have easily been overcome by better writing and direction, but they are NOT. The director should be banned from Hollywood.

The writers' idea of comedy/parody seems to be lifting entire scenes WORD FOR WORD from well known movies, and then re-creating them in this film, only adding the main characters' voice over ""Hey, this is familiar! It's from `Return of the Jedi', isn't that funny?"" Umm... sorry, no it's not.

I feel sorry for the lead actor of this film. The director apparently told him, ""Just say the line with a smile and them mug to the camera, trust me it's funny."" and he believed it. It never works, and it is tried over and over and over..... It's like they are constantly letting us in on a joke, THAT IS NOT THERE! ARGH! No matter how many times ne smiles and mugs, delivering a line from a much better film, it's not a joke, and it's never ever EVER funny.

I watched this movie alone to make sure that my 7 year old daughter could watch it. Now I refuse to let her see it because she will think I am a moron for buying this  piece of garbage. And yes, I watched the whole film through the credits and was never rewarded by any sign of entertainment. To quote a famous doctor ""It's dead, Jim.""

PLEASE NOTE: OF ALL THE REVIEWS OF THIS MOVIE ON AMAZON, I AM THE ONLY VERiFIED AMAZON PURCHASE! I doubt some of the others (five stars) even own the movie.
THIS MOVIE IS NOT GOOD FOR KIDS OR ANYONE. AVOID!",1293580800,2,2904,4.3729128014842304
3871703,5,B00283QELG,this is one of those lame movies that you love. the characters are corney and the story is horribale. but you have to think that the makers did it like that on purpose. this is a great film.,1281225600,3,190,4.026315789473684
3871704,1,B00283QELG,"A movie virtually guaranteed to wind up in the DVD bargain bin in record-setting time, ""Super Capers"" is an indescribably awful attempt at superhero parody.  It features a group of inept comic book figures, clad in ill-fitting get-ups, who bumble and stumble their way to victory against a passel of toothless bad guys.

The movie's idea of humor consists mainly of goofy sound effects and corny musical cues playing on the soundtrack, though I suspect that their sole function is to alert us as to when we should be laughing (there`s really no other way for us to know, since, unlike a TV sitcom, it doesn`t come equipped with its own laugh track).

Out of respect for any possible careers they may still have ahead of them, the actors shall remain nameless, though Adam West (TV's Batman), Clint Howard and June Lockhart stop by to show us just how far has-been actors can be forced to lower themselves when there simply aren't any decent roles left for them anymore.

At the end, the director of this fiasco, Ray Griggs, thanks the ""directors who inspired"" him during his childhood, namely George Lucas, Steven Spielberg, Robert Zemeckis and Peter Jackson.  Sounds like the basis for a good class-action lawsuit, if you ask me.",1269043200,7,1230,4.81042654028436
3871705,5,B00283QELG,"This movie we saw for free in the movie theatre with passes given to us at a convention.  My wife and I took our two sons (age 6 and 4) at the time, and they absolutely loved it.  Guess what, so did the other kids.  As a parent it was silly, though not as stupid as say Sponge-Bob, but it was appropriate.  There really wasn't anything in the movie that a young child shouldn't see.  And no, I don't let my kids watch Transformers or Lord of the Rings at this age.  They threw in a little religion in there, but in a non-forceful way, and with no real denomination.  It is a movie I can properly say I felt good that my kids watched it.",1258675200,8,636,4.0
3871706,1,B00283QELG,"This movie just isn't stupid funny, it is STUPID!!!!

This movie is so bad it actually ruined the buzz I was on.  What a waste...the buzz that is.",1256428800,4,298,4.192982456140351
3871707,2,B00283QELG,"This is budget movie, so expecting anything extrodinary would be wrong.

Overall, it has a few laughs, but the movie starts to wear thin by the halfway point. By the end I was just thankfull it was over. It was like watching a low budget TV show; which is really what this movie should have been.",1253145600,6,296,4.285714285714286

8355595,5,B00283QELG,I decided to get this because I'm a huge Danielle Harris fan and I like her ever since she appeared on Rosanne and Halloween 4 and 5 and Dont tell Mom the Babysitters Dead. I wanted to add it to my Scream Queen collection. Its a funny comical movie and fun. It also shows her comical laughter side.

8355598,1,B00283QELG,"This movie is bad, and don't just take my word for it:  0% critics score and 13% audience score on Rotten Tomatoes.  Super Capers missed the mark for what it was trying to achieve.  Ray Griggs wanted to make a campy superhero movie a la 1960s Batman, but with '80s style as an homage to the films he grew up loving, Star Wars, Star Trek, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and Back to the Future. Instead, it feels like a modern lampoon parody movie with homages to classic movies that are so blatant they feel like knock-offs.  I wanted and was expecting a cheesy movie, but the cheesy dialogue was cooked too fast on a burner that was too hot.  The  movie stops way too often to admire it's own work or explain the bad jokes.  Delivering good cheese should be done the same as a cool guy with a huge block-buster explosion.  Never.  Look.  Back.  Drop the bomb; keep moving forward.  Imagine how bad 'Airplane' would have been if after every subtle joke Leslie Nielsen would turn to the camera with a look that says, ""How about that one, folks?""

Yeah, this is a safe-for-kids movie, but I can't call it a kids movie.  Who is the hero that the kids are supposed to look up to?  It's not the main protagonist, Ed Gruberman.  He's a schmuck who becomes an accidental con-artist that manages to weasel his way out of bad situations with dumb luck when he realizes he's about to get caught.  That's not exactly someone I would want kids aspiring to be.  Granted, if Justin Whalin could have delivered this character, then I would have really liked this movie, but remember, I'm a jaded adult.  Plus, none of the other cast members truly redeem themselves either.  Incompetence prevails is the main theme of the movie, which is not typically the lesson parents want to see in children's entertainment.

Super Capers is an example of ""a polished turd is still a turd.""  This film looks great and it's put together well, but it doesn't cover up the stench of the awful dialogue and acting.  The concept and plot are interesting and compelling enough for me to watch.  The staging and set designs are very nice.  The costumes -- while not so great -- were perfect for the tone of this movie (seriously, I liked them because it was one of the few jokes that worked).  The choice of camera angles and scene transitions look professional.  The sound effects and music are great.  Tom Richmond's art was a great compliment to the story telling and opening credits.  The special effects and props are great.  It looks and feels like a big Hollywood studio movie.  All of this is an impressive feat for a first-time director of an independent film.

Even though Ray Grigg's heart was in the right place, his chops just weren't ready to deliver camp.  Aspiring filmmakers of campy movies should watch this as an example of what not to do.  AND be sure to watch it with the director's commentary to understand what Ray was trying to do because it was too many conflicting ideas at once.  The final joke is that there's not going to be a sequel.",1433116800,,3020,4.499079189686925

I think people expected too much from it, if you want a movie to throw in to entertain your kids, or something that will make you laugh while watching something with them then it's the perfect movie for you.",1422057600,,252,4.270833333333333
8355601,1,B00283QELG,"This movie made me sad.  I loved the old Batman tv show with Adam West, but this in NOTHING like that.  The jokes are stale the plot is boring and nobody involved in this project cared about it.  It feels like it was some rich kid director that wanted to make a film and had his parents pay for it.  What a waste.",1412553600,2,313,3.9206349206349205
8355602,4,B00283QELG,"Somewhat of a parody of superhero movies as it doesn't take itself seriously. A lot of the actors were in either superhero movies or TV shows. For instance, the lead actor played Jimmy Olsen in Lois & Clark on seasons 2-4. If you are looking for a serious superhero movie with stellar special fx then this isn't for you. If you like to have fun while watching a movie, give this a try.",1408233600,,385,4.287671232876712
8355603,5,B00283QELG,"Let me start off by saying how much I hate this movie. I hate it, I hate it, I hate it! I really hate this movie. I know what you are thinking, ""Why the heck did you give the movie a 5-star rating then?"" A totally valid question given how much I hate this movie. I felt obligated to give this movie a 5-star rating because of my 4-year old son's opinion of this movie. He absolutely loves this movie. He saw it once and was an instant fan, such a fan that he started to quote little phrases that he heard once. I am pretty positive this movie was made for children, maybe not toddler aged children, but none the less, children. Being such I had to rate this movie as my son would.
When the movie first started I thought it was going to turn into one of those really awfully made Christian empowerment movies, I am not comfortable showing such things to my toddler son so I was about to shut it off, but he was really enjoying all of the really bad jokes so I decided to ride it out a bit. From my perspective, the acting is bad, the sets are bad, the costumes are bad, the story is bad, the sound track is bad, but all of those things I hate my son loves. It has been months since we have seen this movie and he still talks about it like we saw it yesterday so I bought it for him.
My advise to parents who get this movie for their children, go do chores while your kid watches this film and let them enjoy it.",1400803200,,1410,4.00354609929078
