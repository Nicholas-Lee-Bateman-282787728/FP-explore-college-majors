If you're a fan of Margaret Rutherford as Miss Marple, there's a good chance you'll enjoy this film.  Look for Stringer Davis, Rutherford's real-life husband, who has a small part in this film and who played Rutherford's sidekick in the Miss Marple movies.",1335657600,9,373,5.288135593220339
3958864,2,B002N8AQJC,"The fog shrouding London is as thick as pea soup.  A relief bus from the airport with seven persons aboard are going around in circles due to the low visibility. There's also 200,000 pounds sterling of purloined gold bullion is in the trunk and the mastermind of the heist is one of the passengers.  Who could it be and do we really care?  Not really.  Frankie Howerd as the driver mugs for the cameras.  Petula Clark as the stewardess-escort is efficient.  Margaret Rutherford as the pushy old lady blusters.  Mundane to the extreme.  If Petula sang a few bars of ""Downtown"" it could have helped matters.",1331251200,,605,4.6415094339622645

8374861,5,B002N8AQJC,"Wonderful old British mystery that features a very young Petula Clark.  The bus driver is so much fun. Among the stranded passengers of the bus from the airport are thieves who won't stop at anything to get to safety with their loot. As usual, Margaret Rutherford is priceless.",1483747200,,277,4.770833333333333
8374862,5,B002N8AQJC,"An brilliant British gem that has fallen through the cracks. Frankie Howerd is his usual dynamite in a small package. And Margaret Rutherford simply steals the show. 5 Stars, all the way!",1441756800,,187,4.875
8374863,4,B002N8AQJC,"PLOT: the fog helps robbers COVER A gold heist.

AIRPORT~ENGLAND~ The ""worst fog in years""....where we see MOSTLY UK passengers are STRANDED~ at the overly crowed airport. LOUDEST and mostly the MOST obnoxious COMPLAINER of the lot is MARGARET RUTHERFORD, who demands she get to DUBLIN...""now"" so the airlines decides to PUT the BACKUP bus in service and take a few passengers to another airport WITH LESS FOG.  At the same time the fog is COVERING UP a gold heist at the airport. Loading up the passengers and along comes the driver....FRANKIE HOWARD~(THINK OF THE uk VERSION OF PAUL LYNDE)...AND YOU HAVE IT.... who is very funny and they take off in the fog. The airport just had over 100 GOLD BARS STOLEN....so the BUS is where the robbers STASH the gold. The passengers are soon ""crawling"" at a snails pace...through the fog. They end up in a ABANDONED town. We know the BRAINS of the robbery mob is ON the bus. The MYSTERY WHO is it?  The BRAINS of the robbers/ nicknamed ""THE BANKER"" by the police. Included in the ""suspects are"" the whacky driver, lovely stewardess, PUSHY pilot, obnoxious woman,an American, and SEXY female bookworm. Margaret Rutherford is very funny as the old maid who makes ""marriage suggestions"" to the mousy little man next to her and Howard as the bumbling driver is first rate. This who done it is good. Lots of British humor and the mystery of who the BANKER really is very good. I give it 4 STARS~ Petula Clark is the lovely and very smart stewardess. and YES this is the singer Petula Clark. She was in many B movies in the UK before she got her BIG singing break.",1423008000,,1600,4.5874125874125875
8374864,3,B002N8AQJC,"It's a good, fun movie, one that I really greatly enjoy watching.  However....there is just one problem:  The print of the film, from which this DVD is taken, is of an extremely poor quality, full of scratches, tears and even more than a few gaping torn holes here & there (very distracting.)  In a couple of instances, the funniest lines are missing, due to breaks in the film, and one entire (and very funny) scene, involving the bus-driver using a pay-phone is missing altogether.  It is truly unfortunate that this underrated gem of a comedy hasn't received the full restoration treatment and pristine-quality DVD release that it truly deserves.  It is to be hoped that (for example) perhaps Criterion or some other company may someday take a look at this delightful movie, restore it and release it in the condition as it was meant to be seen.",1414886400,7,848,4.741496598639456
8374865,4,B002N8AQJC,"Amazon is showing the WRONG description of the plot!  It's not about a jewel robbery at all, so they must be talking about a different movie.  Ignore their plot synopsis entirely--but allow yourself to see the fun little movie about the theft of gold bullion placed upon an airport bus that gets lost in the fog.  The actor who plays the driver is wonderfully put upon and silly, with lots of slapstick involved, as are all the other actors involved.  The movie is a fun little matinee.  Enjoy yourself!",1413072000,,503,4.606741573033708
8374866,5,B002N8AQJC,"I bought this movie primarily for Margaret Rutherford.  The plot involves fog and more fog.  It's a little slow at the start but once Frankie Howerd shows up things really take off.  The gag is a bus loaded with very few passengers off to find the Blackbushe Airport.  Instead, they run aground in an army training village rigged with explosives and automatic gunfire.  There's also gold bullion in the boot of the bus and a crook amongst them.  It's all played for laughs.  I thoroughly enjoyed it but for the horrific transfer accompanied by a steady hiss for the duration of the film.  (I've since found a better copy of it in the British Cinema collection, volume two.)
Frankie Howerd is the star of the film, the piece was written especially for him by Director Val Guest.  It was Howerd who insisted this be a comedy-thriller (so if the comedy didn't work at least the thriller aspect might).  He also insisted that his name not be listed above the title.  Lastly, he insisted that Margaret Rutherford be in it (his favorite comedy actress).  I am glad of that.

I'm happy to include it in my movie collection.",1402876800,,1116,4.604060913705584
8374867,3,B002N8AQJC,"Petula Clark's name caught my eye, but don't be fooled, this is an premise about stealing, heavy fog, and a mixture of personalities on an English bus. Just OK.",1379635200,,160,4.551724137931035
8374868,5,B002N8AQJC,"The title is a bit misleading, as it concerns travel in a fog, rather than a bus ""running loose"". However, that said, it's another of the older British comedies. Margret Rutherford is great in this movie.",1364860800,2,204,4.694444444444445
