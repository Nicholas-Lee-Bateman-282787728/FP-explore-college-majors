This doesn't tell you anything you couldn't figure out by just playing around with the unit for 10 or 15 minutes, less time then it takes to watch the video. I was hoping the video would give me more advanced information on what I can do with the unit. Not so much.",1225152000,,293,4.157894736842105
8260497,2,B000LZ59QY,"Well I picked up this DVD hoping to learn something, but no real information was found, it's more of an info-mercial then an informative DVD. The promos run longer then the GPS instructions.

I got my Magellan 800 for christmas and started using it that night. I was able to figure out most of the functions just by playing with the  unit.

This DVD is poorly done. The sound is pitchy. The speaker and the person maning the unit are not always in synch with each other. The speaker flys through his descriptions way too fast. In some cases he doesn't fully explain the function. Make sure you have your remote in hand while watching it because your going to have to stop and replay a lot. The information given is extremely basic, no tricks or advanced help on this DVD.

Some of thefunction I was looking for:

Can you enter a POI, while running an active route. This was a major item for me. I was recently on a trip to Florida and I was trying to figure out if you could re-route to a POI (Gas Station) without canceling the current route. It doesn't appear I can, but this video never even mentioned this aspect.

What the POI software is for and how to use it

How to do a map upgrade

How to do a firmware upgrade

Managing Personal POI's

What to do if a POI is Wrong

How to load Photos

How to load music

This is really not worth buying, you won't learn anything from it.

There is another one offered by Magellan, I don't know if that one is any better, so I can't comment on that one.",1170633600,4,1497,4.225352112676056
