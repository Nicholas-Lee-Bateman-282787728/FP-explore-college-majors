7979027,5,B0000844HU,"Central Park Media released this on videotape around 1996 but it is actually a 1989 anime based on a novel. In Japan these novels are mostly text with a few illustrations and many anime shows are based on such novels. The concept here is ""girls who pilot a giant robot that looks like a woman."" The story is a comedy and seems aimed at a very young audience. Therefore, there is zero character development. Kazumi is the enthusiastic high school girl, Aya is overly serious prep-school girl and Mia is the reluctant leader/university student. Their job is to protect the Earth from attack by the Gedo Corporation. These aliens rely on monsters-of-the week for world conquest rather than conventional armies so the Ariel robot is the perfect counter.",1129680000,5,749,4.859375
