8297780,3,B001ED3JGO,"Grandpa Sanford is at it again, spending the cod liver oil money on lottery tickets! Luckily, he finally wins for once and stands to collect enough dough to bath in swimming pools full of cod liver oil. There's a problem for old Gramps though. He bought a counterfeit ticket off a chiseler named Jake. The ticket's all wet! When Jake's boss, the slimy Tony Franco, sends some torpedoes to fetch the ticket back from Gramps, the boys get a little enthusiastic, see, and accidently dent the old guy's dome, bumping him off!

  This is where Mike Sanford, a real live wire, and his doll of a sister Gloria come in. Gloria is cuddling with a reporter, played by Kane Richmond. Mike tells the reporter about the murder and they all investigate. The action heats up. There are plenty of illegal simoleans on the line! One thing leads to another and several over-the-top fights, red herrings and a crazy old bird that's happy off giggle water later the finale is played out in the kitchen of an old abandoned shack.

  Will the triggermen get pinched before they fit Mike Sanford and his friends with Chicago Overcoats?  You probably already know the answer. It's pretty standard B movie fare from the 30's but it's played tight and with plenty of energy. I won't say it's a great movie, but it is a nifty little time killer with a short duration and just enough furious action and surprises to keep you interested.",1302652800,2,1408,4.6305220883534135

TOUGH TO HANDLE is a nicely-acted Poverty Row programmer that runs about an hour. This fast-moving story pauses for a few song interludes by Phyllis Fraser (Ginger Rogers' cousin and wife of humorist Bennett Cerf). One number is set in a nicely furbished post-Deco club.

Here, stature-challenged Frankie Darro is Mike Sandford, a newsboy whose grandfather buys a counterfeit sweepstakes ticket. When the crook that sold the deucey ducat to Grandpa (Caruth) tries to get it back by force, the old man kicks it from a bum ticker. Frankie and his older sister Gloria (Fraser) want answers to both Grandpa's death and the ticket scam, and so does reporter Joe MacIntyre (Richmond). For the bad guys, this determined trio prove to be.... TOUGH TO HANDLE!
