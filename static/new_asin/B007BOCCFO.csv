8514042,4,B007BOCCFO,"very good but the picture needs to be cleaned form the lines, the darkness, and bring the color back to it, I think it need lots of work to bring it back to life, I had a hard time watching in, and trying to figure what is going on. Beside Amazon prices are too high, look for other video stores where they have better prices for these old movies, and better picture.",1397952000,4,367,4.111111111111111
