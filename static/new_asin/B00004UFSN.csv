1357087,5,B00004UFSN,"This is one of my favorites.  I had seen it many years ago as a kid, and it made quite an impression.  For several years I kept track of it on the internet to see when it would be available on VHS, and now I am doing the same thing regarding DVD.  Not only is Jerry Lewis hilarious as a ""mother in training"", but I enjoyed Connie Stevens as a ""sweet girl next door"" who knows what or rather who she wants.",1096502400,13,405,3.9146341463414633
1357088,4,B00004UFSN,"Long before ""Mr. Mom"" or ""Kramer vs. Kramer"", Jerry Lewis made a great argument for fathers to have as much say in the raising and nurturing of their children as mothers.  This delightful comedy (with just enough drama added in for good measure) is about a man who goes beyond expectation to care for three baby girls who are left at his doorstep.
Moreover, this is not merely a comedy, but a musical, with songs that deserve the right to be as well remembered as any from ""The Wizard of Oz"" or ""The Sound of Music"".
This, among other Jerry Lewis classics, should be issued on DVD, but until they are VHS still looks pretty good.",1078531200,18,629,4.422413793103448
1357089,5,B00004UFSN,"It's tough to choose which Jerry Lewis movies is my favorite, but I have to start with this one. It's sweet, darlin' and romantic all rolled up into one. It's about Clayton Poole (Jerry Lewis) a bumbling TV repairman, who by surprise becomes an adopted father to triplet baby girls.  Clayton's former girlfriend turned movie star, Carla Naples (Marilyn Maxwell) springs the surprise when she leaves them on his doorstep. Noble Clayton tries to keep everything a secret but all mayhem cuts loose. And Clayton's other love interest Sandy Naples (Connie Stevens) helps Clayton out of his dilemma and from the suspicions of their father Gigi (Salvatore Baccaloni). I'll leave the ending for you to see. If you love the wacky antics of Jerry Lewis and romantic comedy by all means go for it!",1051574400,16,786,4.865671641791045
1357090,5,B00004UFSN,"This video is awesome.  My kids love to watch it and laugh hilariously.  It is great for all ages (even me).  It is about a man (Jerry Lewis) who is stuck helping raise 3 babies and it is really funny.  If you buy this video, you won't be sorry.",995241600,4,245,3.938775510204082
1357091,5,B00004UFSN,"I have always loved Jerry Lewis!  I loved him as a kid and now my children do too!  This movie has always been my favorite of Jerry's and I have waited for it to be released forever it seems!  I have been serching the net for quite a while... Finally!  My second favorite of Jerry's is, Ladies Man.  It was years before I figured out the name of that one!  I never forgot Rock-A-Bye Baby, and you won't either!!!  Jerry Lewis is the greatest comedian of all times!  You gotta see this one again and again!",969840000,8,505,4.1875

The girls even dance in Marilyn Maxwell dance number.  Jerry Lewis at his  finest.  A must see family movie.",965692800,3,254,4.533333333333333
1357093,5,B00004UFSN,"This has always been an all time favorite of mine.  This is Jerry Lewis at his finest.  He's in love with the hometown movie star and is given a chance to help her out of a jam.  It seems that there are three babies with  no father.  Things get real exciting when the three are lefted on Jerry's  doorstep and the town is wondering who lefted them.  Connie Steven's has  plans of her own which involves marriage.  She's the movie stars little  sister, and she has loved Jerry forever. Now, the Papa to the two girls  can't stand Jerry and the temper is thrown many times.  The movie is  hilarious, and a must to see.",964051200,9,616,4.252173913043478

They absolutely loved this movie and bounce around the house singing Rock-a-bye-baby.  My youngest asks me to sing it to her at bedtime.  It's funny, wholesome, family entertainment.  Quick caution, be watchful of adult themes.  I missed all of them when watching the movie during my younger years.

She's interested in Clayton,  but he's not interested in her.  When he has to take on all sorts of odd jobs to help pay for diapers and milk, the results are a riot.  Pure fluff.

1357202,5,B00004UFSN,"In my opinion, this is one the Best Jerry Lewis movies.  Yes, he is goofy much of the time, but his character in the movie is caring and sentimental (even when he senses he is being taken advantage of by someone he cares for).  The zaney character he portrays shows he can also be very responsible!  You actually feel sympathy for the guy, and begin rooting for him to ""win in the end.""",1417478400,,386,4.260273972602739

1357222,5,B00004UFSN,I gave it 5 stars because this movie is so funny without any blue humor or adult humor at all.  We can watch this with our grandkids.  some of the new animated movies have more smut (like bodily noises etc.) than this.  Jerry Lewis is just so good with his facial expression and bungling manner!!  And a bachelor handling baby girl triplets gives a lot of room for facial expression and bungling.,1400457600,,396,4.458333333333333

1357229,5,B00004UFSN,"I've been a Jerry Lewis fan forever. From his earlier movies like ""That's My Boy""  ""Partners""  ""Cinderfella"" ""Delicate Delinquent"" ""The Stooge"" etc. To me he's one of the greatest. You could put me in a room with a collection of his movies and I would be just fine. Although I loved "" Rock A Bye Baby""  I feel that ""Who's Minding The Store"" w/ Agnes Moorehead was just as good. Really out of all his movies there's maybe 1 or 2 that I felt weren't his best performances "" Don't Raise The Bridge "" being one. I know some will feel different which is cool because we're all entitled to our opinion. Thanks Mr Jerry Lewis for choosing to make the ""World"" laugh.",1394928000,,658,4.333333333333333

The movie takes a look at an old love, a kind gesture and an ultimate surprise ending. It is appropriate for kids 10 and older and is filled with funny and heart warming moments. I love that it came in Blue Ray, even my husband commented on how clear the picture was. I would recommend this to families or die-hard Jerry Lewis fans, this is one of my personal favorites. The one thing that some may notice--what would be considered ""sexism"" in modern times but even that might make for a good conversation--being that Jerry Lewis may have been the pioneer for the idea of ""stay-at-home"" dads.",1357689600,,706,4.438461538461539

It just make you feel good and when the movie is over, you find yourself wishing we had more movies like that today.  But then, there is only one Jerry Lewis.

1357287,4,B00004UFSN,"I've been waiting for this to come out on DVD. The opening credits sequence is amazing, and is right up there with Nillson's end credits for SKIDOO (the only reason to own that film).
As with most Jerry Lewis films, it's a pastiche of wild comedy bits linked together by a mediocre story. There is an extended sequence, of Jerry behind a TV set, performing as though he's on different channels. Laugh-out-loud funny stuff! He also does a weird spoof of Bill Haley and his Comets.
Also of interest is Jerry (who's playing an RCA Victor TV repairman), up high on the roof of a Victorian house on Colonial Street at Universal City Studios. (Why Frank Tashlin and Jerry filmed there, I have no idea, since Paramount had its own backlot streets.) I believe the house he's attempting to install the TV antenna on is the same house that a few years later would serve as the haunted house in Don Knotts' ""The Ghost and Mr. Chicken""! There are other familiar houses seen in the background, houses you've seen hundreds of times before, on shows like ""Leave It To Beaver"", ""The Munsters"", and the late 1960s ""Dragnet"" reboot.
The color and sound are astounding on this disc. There is lots here for a Jerry Lewis fan to enjoy!!
My only quibble is that when I opened the Amazon packing box the DVD was shipped in (which appeared to have no outward damage), I discovered the DVD case itself was gashed on the backside, affecting the back cover plastic AND tearing the paper insert beneath! Very odd indeed. Why would someone at Amazon filling my order send me an item with the case obviously damaged? Frustrating.

1357288,5,B00004UFSN,Cute movie and Jerry Lewis is always hilarious. My favorite parts are where he is being both a mother and a father to the tripletts. I'm sure that parents everywhere can relate. Oh and the scene at the end when he finds out he has quints....classic Jerry!  Hilarious.  Good movie to get you laughing.,1344124800,,300,4.537037037037037

1357290,5,B00004UFSN,"I purchased this movie for a very good friend of mine and since i am a avid buyer through Amazon, and it was finally available on Dvd i bought it.  She loves this movie and needed it on dvd. Only problem is the company who released it did not put in Closed Caption so if your hearing impaired you may have to turn up the volume. My friend is hearing impaired and she said it's was still a worth while watch, and with nothing else available I got it anyway. I too myself put closed caption on movies because i like it myself. As far as the movie she says its a great funny movie. I myself prefer the dean & jerry movies.  well thats all i have to say for now so other than that exception the movie fits the bill.",1337212800,5,711,4.0
1357291,5,B00004UFSN,"Got the movie primarily for a musical number Jerry Lewis's character does for a talent show...he also does a memorable skit as a weatherman and beautifully sings a lullabye to the kids...another kicker is his landlady supporting the sponsors of her favorite TV shows.

1357293,4,B00004UFSN,"It is very seldom that writer director Tashlin fails to entertain and impress. He was famous for giving Bob Hope some of his best vehicles,except for that
late film private navy of sgt o'farrell. One of the mistakes Lewis made was to
stop making movies with him in 1964...in jerry's films a strength always is the great character actors and in the case the chief support is bob hope's amour marilyn maxwell and the story begins with her as an ageing film actress and trusts no one with her kids and is looking for someone to care for them..there are many puns in this film on good mothers...and she chooses jerry the only person she can trust. Jerry is quite good in this film and it works since there's always much going on in plot,from an old cultured persona looking for grandchildren and wanting to set up his daughter as jerry's wife,and jerry's romance to his dealings with the movie queen,slapstick routines,and to jerry's dealings with the children and a marriage and bigamy sensation at movie's end. Good production values and budget,and action is fast paced and frenetic...not a dull scene or lag throughout film jerry and tashlin at their best...send up of smoking and tv advertising is a laugh!!",1333670400,,1207,4.752380952380952
1357294,4,B00004UFSN,"Jerry Lewis hits the ground running with this movie as his first solo effort after the break up of the Martin and Lewis team. Jerry shines with hilarious sight gags and predicaments. He shows great sensitivity and heart when confronted with the enormous task of caring for triplets. The musical numbers are appropriate and add to the movie's storyline.
The movie includes debuts by Connie Stevens and Gary Lewis.

This movie was a long time in coming to the home market.  The blu-ray reproduction was gorgeous. I recommend this movie for the entire family. I have shown Jerry's movies to children and I am happy to see a whole new generation enjoying these cinematic treasures. I love seeing little kids laugh and giggle on the floor as I did when I first saw Jerry's antics.",1332720000,6,775,4.733333333333333

This is my favorite Jerry Lewis movie. Rock a bye baby is Jerry Lewis at his best especially his singing and dancing on a tv show in the movie when he's trying to get money to take care of Carla, his child hood sweet heart's babies. He has a beautiful voice so when he does a song side by side with his real life son who's suppose to be him as a young boy,it makes the movie heart warming and sooo sweet. Now I'm able to share this with my kids. Another great Jerry Lewis movie I can't find is Three on a couch with Janet Leigh. How long for that one?",1330214400,3,722,3.7565789473684212

1357301,4,B00004UFSN,"Bumbling TV repairman Clayton Poole (Jerry Lewis) gets an unexpected visitor - three in fact - when he finds a set of baby triplets on his doorstep one night.  Unbeknownst to Clayton, the babies belong to glamorous movie star Carla Naples (Marilyn Maxwell), his childhood sweetheart.  In an effort to stay out of the tabloids (and honor her commitment to film a wacked-out musical entitled ""White Virgin of the Nile""), Carla plans to have Clayton keep the babies for six months, after which time she'll return to ""adopt"" them.  Things begin to unravel, however, when Carla's father Gigi (Salvatore Baccaloni) notices the uncanny resemblance between the tots and his daughter - their beauty marks are identical!  Not to mention the romantic angst of Carla's kid sister Sandra (a screen debuting Connie Stevens), who pines away for her beloved, unrequited Clayton.

Even if you don't particularly appreciate the antics of Jerry Lewis, 1958's ROCK-A-BYE BABY (a loose remake of Preston Sturges' ""The Miracle of Morgan's Creek"") will still appeal because of it's sweetly simple story idea.  Jerry is as manic as ever but balances his performance with many quieter moments (including several musical numbers that reveal his beautiful singing voice).  Comic set-pieces for Lewis include the opening scene where Clayton attempts to contain a high-pressure firehose, the ""broken TV"" in which he enacts a series of television programmes whilst a drunk Gigi observes; and an hilarious parody of Elvis and his swinging pelvis.

Connie Stevens delights in her spunky turn as Sandra (in one cute musical number she even performs a counterpoint duet with her mirrored reflection).  Marilyn Maxwell is lovely as Carla.  Reginald Gardiner co-stars as Carla's manager; with Isobel Elsom, Hans Conried, James Gleason and Ida Moore.",1316044800,,1813,5.263888888888889

Directed by Lewis' ""mentor"" Frank Tashlin, it's chockfull of zany Jerry moments. The moments that stick out: A sleepy Jerry tending to babies in the dead of night; Jerry pretending to be a personality in a broken TV set to fool his girl's (Connie Stevens) drunken father; and a rock & roll contest with Jerry at his manic best.

In fact, even those who aren't particualrly fond of Lewis might like this one.",1165881600,3,398,5.138461538461539

I've always liked him, especially when he is in pure comedy, with an edge, like The Nutty Professor and my personal favourite, Cinderfella. This film has its comedic moments but there is more sentimentality than in his other films. There's singing, romance and three babies. It is also Connie Stevens' first film role. The movie is actually produced by Jerry Lewis. There is a serious under-current: why a father cannot bring up a child - in this case, triplets!
