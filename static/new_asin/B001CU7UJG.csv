8289586,5,B001CU7UJG,Everyone should see this DVD accurately describing a secret of World War II -- that Japan was working on a nuclear bomb of its own.,1503100800,,131,4.28

8289588,5,B001CU7UJG,"Excellent production on the history of the atomic device that Japan developed unknown to most of the world before the end of WWII. Had the war been prolonged, Japan might have been able to utilize atomic devices to bring to the world the first two sided nuclear conflict in history and to make WWII even a much greater disaster than it was.",1444176000,,340,4.5
8289589,5,B001CU7UJG,"I really enjoyed this DVD. If true it's amazing that Japan was able to build a test nuclear weapon. Obviously they would have to make a deliverable weapon so they may have ben a few months or more away from attempting to drop a bomb on anyone. To answer another reviewers question, most of this information came from classified documents that were recently released, you know how the US and USSR like to keep their secrets.

 Definitely worth viewing.",1374105600,2,451,4.69620253164557
8289590,4,B001CU7UJG,"So, Japan wasn't that far away of a nuclear weapon, was it?

The part I found particularly intriguing was that Japan apparently actually exploded a nuclear bomb on a test site in Korea. What remains unexplained, however, is why this explosion remained a secret after 1945 - I can imagine that even back in 1945 the US government would have jumped the opportunity to show the world that there had been another good reason for nuking Japan out of the war.

The documentary is solid, however, and thrilling.

Recommended.
