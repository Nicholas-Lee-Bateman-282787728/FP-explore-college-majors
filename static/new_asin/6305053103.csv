958448,4,6305053103,"Growing up in the 1950's I had a somewhat tenuous connection with trains. My grandparents lived close to a commuter rail that before my teenage years went out of service, due to the decline of ridership as the goal of two (or three) car garages gripped the American imagination in an age when gas was cheap and plentiful. In my teens though, many a time I walked those above-mentioned abandoned tracks to take the short route to the center of town. As an adult I have frequently ridden the rails, including a cross-continental trip that actually converted me to the virtues of air travel. Of course, my `adventures' riding the rails is quite different than that being looked at in this American Experience documentary about a very, very  common way for the youth of America to travel in the Depression-ridden 1930's, the youth of my parents' generation. My own experiences were merely as a paying passenger. Theirs was anything but. The only common thread between them and me is the desire expressed by many interviewees to not be HERE but to be THERE.

This tale of a significant number of youth in the 1930's is held together by film footage of the time, some nice background music from the likes of Jimmy Rodgers and Doc Watson that evokes the `romance of the rails' and `talking head' interviews with the itinerant travelers, male and female. Despite various motives from the desire to leave their parents' houses to being thrown out during those tough times the stories they tell are of cold nights in open box cars, overcrowded jails, beatings by the ever present railroad ""bulls"" and looking for a little work to move on to the next locale and maybe some `peace'. Mainly this was the eternal heading West of the Frederick Turner Jackson thesis- with this proviso- by then the land had run out and maybe the possibility of the dreams. A few interviewed are still driven by the lore of the rails, many had no regrets but mainly this is a very interesting trip down memory lane in a time before the automobile became readily accessible to teenagers.

No review of the life of the rails can omit the special jargon developed by those on the road, the `class' distinctions (hobo, bum, and tramp) between them and the rough and ready `code of honor' of the rails (honored more in the breach than in the practice from what I can gather). This tradition has survived best in song by the likes of Woody Guthrie in any number of his songs written in the 1930's,  the classic Elizabeth Cotton song Freight Train and the work, including a song with the same title as the headline to this piece, of the recently deceased old Wobblie, folksinger, writer and rail rat extraordinaire Utah Phillips.

958454,5,6305053103,"Riding the Rails is an extraordinary video documentary that recounts how hundreds of thousands of teenagers during the Great Depression left their homes and hopped freight trains back and forth across America. Most came from families that could no longer support them, but some were just kids in search of adventure. The documentary is built around interviews with about a dozen survivors from that time, now in their seventies and eighties. Their moving stories are augmented by pictures, newsreel footage, and excerpts gleaned from thousands of letters contributed to the project by other survivors. The reminiscences are by turns grim and humorous, hopeful and bitter, tragic and filled with wonder. By the end of the film you'll feel as if you're close friends with these former hobo kids. The music is likewise outstanding, mixing vintage railroad songs and social anthems with original tracks. The overall effect is a kind of bracing nostalgia that is not cloying but consciousness-raising in the best sense. ""Riding the Rails"" is the winner of 18 major film awards, including Best Documentary of 1997 from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, the Directors Guild, and the Los Angeles Film Critics Association.

958505,1,6305053103,"The program does little to put the stories of the individuals in the context of the Great Depression.  There are too many trees and not enough forest.  Using something like this as an introduction to The Great Depression for school-age students (as other reviewers have mentioned) is likely to imprint a lot of misconceptions- which tend to stick with you through later life and schooling.

And some of the individual stories are suspect.  At the worst of the Great Depression, 1932, practically nobody was doing as well as some of these people say their families were doing when they left home.  People who weren't hobos before the Depression, but became hobos during did so mostly out of economic necessity, not any craving for adventure.  Even doctors and lawyers weren't doing well by 1932 when most of their patients and clients couldn't pay their bills.  A brokerage business selling stocks and bonds was far more likely to fail between October 1929 and March 1933 than in 1938, even with the Roosevelt Recession of 1937.  Its hard to believe such a business could have been totally successful up until 1938.

The program also overplays the adventure aspect of hopping freight trains by failing to make the distinction between a hobo a bum and a tramp. A hobo always wanted work.  A bum worked only as a last resort.  A tramp would rather go to jail than work.  It wasn't unusual for a hobo to stay in one place with a job for months at a time or even a year.  They lead semi-settled lives.  A bum and a tramp did not.  Hobos didn't want charity and they didn't beg.  This is the way it had been for decades before the Depression.

The program does little to explain the sub-culture of the hobos because it gets hobos, bums and tramps mixed together.  Hobos had a code of conduct, namely never do anything anywhere that would make life difficult for the hobos that were bound to come behind you.  Hobos were always willing to help each other whenever and however they could.  They also made a point of getting a bath and washing their clothes wherever and whenever they could.  Hobos knew that everything they did would reflect on every other hobo and they felt that they owed it to every other hobo to make a good impression on the people and communities where other hobos would come looking for work.

And something else the program should have addressed considering the still photographs it used is race relations among hobos.  Where else in America in the 1930s would you have seen blacks and whites living together as depicted in the photographs?

All-in-all this documentary is as staged as the newsreels it uses were.  About half-way through it got too boring to continue watching.

It tells of the tough times families were enduring, often causing young people to try to provide for themselves.  It seemed as if the elusive jobs were always someplace else and the rails were an accessible means of travel.  The story uses original film, not movies or staging.  The people involved tell their own stories and emotions, kids who had to become toughened and wary at too early an age.  As hard as it was for the white kids, it was even harder and more dangerous to be black and on the rails.

Our father was one of those hoboes then.  Maybe that's why this story caught my eye.  Dad didn't talk about his experiences.  Maybe this film explains some of what he didn't tell.

It's easy to romanticize life on the rails. But the Great Depression forced thousands of young Americans to leave home, hop a boxcar, and head for parts unknown. Fortunately, PBS' Riding the Rails avoids the temptation to sugarcoat hobo life.

Filmmakers Michael Uys and Lexy Lovell collected letters and filmed interviews with former hobos. The segments are moving in that their tales of hardship. While some young people left home for adventure, most were just desperate. A great interviewee is Peggy DeHart - one of the few female hobos.

In one moving scene, former hobo Charley Bull recounts how his sharecropper father told him that he had to leave home. Bull's father simply could not afford to feed him. Viewers also learn of the violent life in the hobo jungles where young people quickly learned the rules - or else.

The film discusses FDR's New Deal policies. Inevitably, viewers' reactions to these segments will depend on their politics. The filmmakers, however, deserve credit for mostly resisting the temptation to proselytize and allowing viewers to decide for themselves.

In the end, the interviewees are the stars of the film. Adolescence in the Depression may not have been what they would have chosen, but hoboing was still the great adventure of their lives. It is fascinating - but bittersweet - to hear them discuss their youth in a vanished America.

(A great nonfiction book on hobos - circa 1980 - is Ted Conover's Rolling Nowhere).

There is great historical and human interest in Riding the Rails. I give it my highest recommendation.",1280966400,,1771,4.922818791946309

958548,5,6305053103,"This documentary tells the heartrending story of how young men and even some young women began hopping freight trains to find work, excitement, adventure and a better life in general during the Great Depression. We get outstanding archival footage as well as quite a bit of recent interview footage with the now elderly people who rode the freight trains back then; and this film taught me quite a lot about their lives at this point in history.

The financial depression that ensued after the stock market crash of 1929 was almost unprecedented; grown men who had never been without a job suddenly found themselves out of work, sometimes with little hope of ever being the family breadwinner again. The burden of making money to support the family often went to the young teenagers, usually just boys but sometimes teenage girls, who had to look literally all over the country to find work and send as much money as they could back home. One African-American man recalls vividly the day when his father told him that they could not afford to feed him anymore and that he would have to strike out on his own despite his still being a teenager. Indeed, the average person hopping freight trains was a hungry, financially desperate teenager who wanted to try their luck in other parts of the country. Yes, a few of the young people wanted adventure and the thrill of being a rebel; but I still had the distinct impression that they also needed the money no matter what they said in that archival footage. They all looked hungry and most of them were quite thin at that time.

Believe it or not, I'm not giving it all away (I don't want to spoil this for you); there's plenty more to learn from this insightful film. Just trying to jump up and onto a moving train often meant risking your life if you fell! We see the long term psychological effects of riding the rails as well as society's varying reactions to the people scrounging for a living as they rode trains from one town to another. Fortunately, there are distinctly bright spots in this story.

The DVD comes with extras. In particular, I liked the interview with writers/directors Michael Uys and Lexy Lovell; and there's a printed excerpt from a book by Errol Lincoln Uys entitled Riding the Rails: Teenagers on the Move During the Great Depression. We get a slideshow of photos with music; and there are a couple of links to websites on the Internet that explore the topic of this film.

I highly recommend this fine documentary that tells the incredibly poignant tale of the teenagers and others who were so down on their luck that they had to ride freight trains all over the nation looking for work often just barely avoiding starvation even when they made their very best efforts. This is particularly useful for anyone studying American history and people who are interested in the Great Depression in particular would do well to add this to their collections.",1257465600,2,2926,4.69785575048733
