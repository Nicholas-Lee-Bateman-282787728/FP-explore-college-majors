8173543,5,B0001DD904,"A very intense dvd of this not-so-well-known band from the Tampa Death Metal scene. They play a very thrash metal-influenced death metal variety with vocals that are more metalcore than death -the singer even dresses up like Jamie Jasta- and the end result is an incredibly super-fast, super-heavy, super-tight wall of sound with the 2 lead guitarrist soloing at the same time most of the time which can be confusing till your brain and ear adapt. This is not easy listening by a long shot, let's say it's Discharge meets Slayer and you are halfway there.

Shot in 2003 at the Metalmania Fest, Poland, during an euro Tour with Marduk and other bands, this dvd is one of those unauthorized Metal Mind releases -meaning not official and not approved by the band, which justifies its high, euro-import price- but that doesn't detract from great fun, great sound and pic quality and a ton of extras including wallpapers for your PC desktop, a band bio, and over a half hour of a juicy interview with 3 members of the band.

Main feature is the 50' gig, comprised of 14 excruciating tracks played relentlessly with little in-between-songs banter and sometimes not even a pause between them. They don't allow bands to play any longer on these festivals unless they're headlining which is not the case but don't think your ears will be able to take it any longer either if you like your metal at realistic levels.

The filming is superb : a perfect, well edited, razor-sharp widescreen pic shot with over 10 cameras although I would personally have loved to see more of the bassist.

The sound is near-perfect for the first half of the gig (just a tad bottom-end light) and perfect on the second half. I could have used a louder PCM stream insted of the somewhat quiet dolby d. 2.0 . A 5.1 option is provided and despite the fact I never use it I tried it and noticed it had a little less bottom-end to it and vocals and guitars were somewhat louder in the mix.

Conclusion ? A very satisfactory purchase and a worthy addition to any extreme metal fan collection.",1244246400,,2056,4.6219178082191785
