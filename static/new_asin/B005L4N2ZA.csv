4719320,5,B005L4N2ZA,Truely an uplifting film. Something EVERYONE should see. It will renew your faith in your fellow Americans. Do not tell the story of 9-11 to your children without telling them the story of 9-12!,1318809600,3,194,4.735294117647059

8477366,4,B005L4N2ZA,"I rated this movie high because of the content.  If anyone is down about  what they see on the evening news, this is a good movie to see what we need more of.  I had tears in my eyes much of the time and will forever see New York in a
different way because of one little boys dream and a dad that followed through.  Wonderful story.",1399161600,,332,3.91044776119403
8477367,5,B005L4N2ZA,"I didn't know about this wonderful organization until I was nominated as a hometown hero to be an ""official flag stitcher"" when the American Flag that was being repaired came to the Martinsburg, West Virginia VA Medical Center on June 21, 2011. I learned how ""THE NEW YORK SAYS THANK YOU"" organization started and then how it just kept on gaining momentum with each part of ""The National 9/11 Flag Restoration Tour"" that was repairing the flag one town or state at a time.  I also learned how the organization originally started with a young boy donating his toys to the kids who had lost all of theirs in such devastating fires that had taken their homes and all of their belongings. I am a disabled Gulf War Veteran and have truly felt honored to be a part of such a wonderful organization and also to have met the wonderful organizers of the flag restoration Carolyn Deters and her husband Mr. Denny Deters.  When I learned that there was going to be a Documentary movie about the whole story, I couldn't wait for it to become available through Amazon.com.  The other extroidinary thing is that anyone who has had contact with making this whole project come together has been put on a master list and kept up to date in each step of the process.  I have watched the DVD at least 5 times and still want to watch it more.  Thank you to all of those incvolved in the making of this wonderful and meaningful movie.  Sincerely Danalynn Minshew.",1325980800,,1442,4.526923076923077
8477368,5,B005L4N2ZA,"This movie is the perfect example of hope, love, and the true American spirit. I showed this film to my fourth grade students, in an effort to inspire them to help out in the community. This film proves that all of us can, and should, do something for others.",1324080000,,259,4.3061224489795915
8477369,5,B005L4N2ZA,"New York Says Thank You is a ""must see"" movie.  It portrays some of the devastation in NY after the 9-11 attack ... but more importantly, it tells the story of the amazingly good things that happened afterward thanks to one of the most remarkable men & foundations in the country - Jeff Parness & the New York Says Thank You Foundation (NYSTY).  NYSTY is a group of volunteers led by Jeff Parness who, on the anniversary of 9-11 each year, take on rebuilding projects.  And these are not little projects - this group came to my hometown of Mena, AR in 2010 and rebuilt 3 homes, a community center, and a cemetery fence, all of which had been destroyed by a tornado in 2009.  They brought the 9-11 National flag, worked hard, made friends with the whole town, and gave us one of the most moving memorial services I've ever attended.  Every American should see this movie - it should be played in every school, in every church & synagog, in every home - it is that uplifting, that inspiration, and that wonderful!  As Jeff says, ""It's all about 9-12"" - and this movie portrays that notion & the beauty of the human spirit better than any other movie I have seen - DO NOT MISS SEEING THIS MOVIE!",1321315200,,1192,4.3954545454545455
8477370,5,B005L4N2ZA,This movie is awesome!  Touching to see how many people are transformed through volunteerism and Paying It Forward.  Evan is an amazing young man to have inspired his family and hundreds of other people with the idea of this organization.  Will be watching this movie over and over.,1320019200,,282,4.833333333333333
8477371,5,B005L4N2ZA,"Talk about a tear-jerker, a wonderfully laid out story about a truly giving group of people.  A must see, inspirational film.  Humanity acting like humanity should.  This is NOT another 9/11 film; it's a 9/12 and beyond film.  Best doc I've seen this year.  Fun extras content, too.",1318982400,,282,4.791666666666667
8477372,5,B005L4N2ZA,"I had the pleasure of seeing this incredible film, not once - but twice - at the 2011 Tribeca Film Festival where I serve as a venue technical director. Rarely do I get the chance to watch a film all the way through, but I sat captivated by the amazing story this film seamlessly delivers. It is one of those rare films that is inspiring and for me produced a life changing moment. I have volunteered with different organizations from time to time but never truly found my spot until now. The film moved me to immediately contact the group to find out how I could help and I had the pleasure of spending 4 days in Georgia this year at the New York Says Thank You 2011 project site. I got to experience in my own life what I got to see that night in NYC on the big screen, and it was wonderful. My only disappointment is I didn't find out sooner than I did about what these folks are doing. As one of the NYC Firefighters says near the end of the movie ""you can't get rid of this feeling"". It stays with you, and it really does. Another reviewer said that to many documentaries show the horror of 9/11. That they show the destruction and it impacts you over and over again. Director Scott Rettberg and his team have found the other side of the tragedy and woven together 4 separate projects into an amazing 90 minute journey into the human spirit of kindness and paying it forward. One of the best things that Rettberg does is he doesn't show the horrible sights that morning. I don't think very many people can close their eyes and not picture those images. One of the many things I like in this film is those images are not there. They aren't needed. In short - Purchase this movie, watch it often, share it with your family and friends, and I hope you can get the same feeling I have had since last April. I literally can't wait for the holidays when I can finally share the film with my own family. It is an amazing inspirational story and I am so honored to be a part of the organization and amazing group of people that this film follows as they continue to pay it forward.",1318809600,4,2078,4.25
8477373,5,B005L4N2ZA,"This movie is worth 90 minutes of your time. It chronicles a group of New York City firemen and others helping the towns and citizens get back on their feet in the small towns of Texas, Indiana,Kansas and Iowa. To the firemen from New York it's a bit of a culture shock from the tall buildings and bright lights that they are accustomed to. The main reason of why they are in these places is a way to say ""Thanks"" after all of America rallied after the tragedy ten years ago at the World Trade Center. This is a movie that will make you proud as an American and give you the power to volunteer in making your community a better place. Kudos to Jeff Parness for what he has done and for this movie. This would make a great gift for someone!",1318809600,2,739,4.174825174825175
8477374,5,B005L4N2ZA,"Most documentaries are about the horrors of what actually happened on 9/11. Yes, thousands of people lost their lives and the entire nation was changed, but what happened after? Did New York just cave in on itself and give up? No, people made the best out of a horrible situation. The US came together and worked together through this tragedy. This documentary follows the survivors from New York as they made attempts to give back, not only to their community, but to the nation. This is a heartwarming documentary that will probably bring you to tears.",1318809600,,554,4.78125
