3902943,5,B002C39SW4,"The Lucky Star OVA is just what I was hoping it would be--more of the Lucky Star series without any character derailment. The OVA covers 5 or so different ""stories"", ranging from getting lost on a camping trip to playing Konata's MMO to a very surreal visit to a pet shop.

The DVD itself is very bare-bones. The audio is only in Japanese 2.0, and the English subtitles may be turned on or off. The only other options on the DVD are scene selection, and a textless ending. For Lucky Star fans who prefer subtitling (myself included), this DVD is exactly what you are looking for. For those who prefer the dub, this is not a 5-star purchase.

The ending itself is a ""special"" live-action episode of Lucky Channel, starring Shiraishi Minoru (himself) and Kogami Akira (Konno Hiromi), which is a treat to anyone who enjoyed The Adventures of Shiraishi Minoru episodes from the Extras of the other Lucky Star DVDs.",1249516800,14,910,4.645962732919255
3902944,3,B002C39SW4,"I really enjoyed the series of Lucky Star and highly recommend it. I was hoping that this would bring back the fun of the series, however the OVA had only the Japanese voice track and although it is a good cast I prefer my anime in English. I felt that the OVA was really well done but wish that the American voice cast was used instead of just using the subtitles. It does not reduce the overall quality of the OVA just made it slightly less enjoyable.",1249344000,4,453,4.218390804597701
3902945,2,B002C39SW4,"If you like the TV series of Lucky Star then you might like OVA assuming you don't mind reading English subtitle or you know Japanese language. OVA consists of multiple short scene of Konata and her friends going through everyday live as well as some unusual story such as Konata, Kagami, Tsukasa, and Nanako playing massively multiplayer online role-playing game and Kagami having a suggestive dream. Last 7 minutes of OVA was Live-action Lucky Channel. Live-action segment for end theme is not exactly everyone favorite part of Lucky Star which they are much better off putting one anime ending theme and cycle over all of the live-action ending theme (including TV series episode 13-24 ending theme). I think it worth to rent it if you're English dub fans but not worth keep it considering they didn't even bother dub into English plus they totally cutting corner for putting OVA as 43 minutes long when they have live-action Lucky Channel segment took up 7 minutes of the show already.",1248912000,3,989,4.892857142857143
3902946,5,B002C39SW4,"Like the wonderful series; the OVA does not disappoint; and I would hope an OVA is NOT like the TV series or manga it is based off of; definition of OVA: ""OAVs are supposed to have original scripts, although there are exceptions. They can be based on a Manga or TV series, but the particular episode should be original.""  Most OVAs are often re-tellings of the original stories, offshoot stories, or a completely different take.  I hope a second series of Lucky Star will be produced.",1248825600,3,484,4.616279069767442
3902947,3,B002C39SW4,"I adore the anime TV Series with a passion and can re-watch it many times (highly recommended). I was actually expecting the OVAs to be just as good as the TV series episodes but I felt a bit let down. A lot of interesting scenarios occur in the OVAs(Kagami/Konata cosplay situations for one example). But a lot of it felt like they were trying to cater to the fans desires too much and it didn't have the same flow as the anime. All that said...it's Lucky Star which has amazing characters and great references! If you're a Lucky Star fan you should give it a try! So it's good compared to many other things, but does not measure up to the TV Series in my opinion.",1248048000,6,665,4.285714285714286

8362946,5,B002C39SW4,"Its basicly just another episode i think its little longer, if you like lucky star of course youll like an extra episode.",1356480000,,121,4.545454545454546
8362947,4,B002C39SW4,"I ordered this and revived it in a case that was torn up from the bottom (was used but was expected). However, I doubt that really matter besides the fact that the DVD works fine and I have nothing really to complain about. The price was cheap enough for me so I went for the buy.

8362949,5,B002C39SW4,"Great OVA to Lucky Star.  Great little stories, especially the MMO's.  The characters are as cute and fuuny as ever.  If you already own Lucky Star then I suggest getting the Lucky Star OVA as well.  It is in Japanese, but that's what the subtitles are for :)",1323388800,,259,4.333333333333333
8362950,5,B002C39SW4,"This is like an extended episode of Lucky Star. If you've seen any of the seasons, you will certainly want to collect this OVA. It only offers Japanese dialogue with English subs, so far there is no English Dub version available. My favorite part is the live Akira Lucky channel segment at the end though. Very cool addition!",1305849600,,325,4.620689655172414
8362951,5,B002C39SW4,This is a great DVD. Lucky Star is one of the best animes I've ever watched! I believe the OVA will be just as good! And the dvd came in perfect condition! Came in way faster than I expected too! I would definately buy from this seller again! Oh and...Lucky is the best anime ever!! (And in Akira Kogami's words)Bynie!!!,1287100800,,320,4.35
8362952,5,B002C39SW4,"In my book, more Luck Star is always a good thing, and the OVA is a fun addition to the series. It IS unfortunately on the short side, and, since it tries to give some of its limited screen time to as many of the characters as it can (sometimes in amusingly surreal situations), it can feel rather haphazard. My only real complaint, though, is the live-action Lucky Channel -- it's aimless, and too long in proportion to the actual OVA.

These quibbles aside, however, I think any fan of the series will enjoy the OVA. Konata and Co. are always a lot of laugh-out-loud fun, and they don't disappoint here.",1269302400,2,605,4.45045045045045
