6709163,5,B00O4CTSD0,Sleepy Hollow is a fantastic show I bought season 1 on DVD and watched it nonstop from beginning to end I am looking forward to Sleepy Hollow Season 3 in September 2015,1424649600,8,168,4.28125
6709164,5,B00O4CTSD0,well conceived and better acted continuous story including supernatural on a regular basis;  the two primary characters seem to play off each other very well;  story lines are acceptable considering the monster the heroes must meet;  one gets involved in each episode trying to help figure out the means of defeating the characters from the other world.  I ked it.,1418169600,5,364,5.016666666666667

6709225,5,B00O4CTSD0,"I'm a huge fan of Sleepy Hollow and love the stories interwoven with history. I know they've taken some extreme liberties with history but I don't watch this to get a historical education, it's supposed to be fun!",1483833600,,213,4.631578947368421

6709233,4,B00O4CTSD0,"I love the 1st season of this show so much.  Season 2 started strong then got derailed in the middle due to the writers choosing to focus on Crane's family dynamics rather than the mission of the 2 witnesses.  However things get back on track by the season finale which features a role reversal for the witnesses that serves as a fantastic bookend to the shows pilot episode.

I highly recommend the first 2 seasons of this show.",1478476800,,429,4.4743589743589745

6709252,5,B00O4CTSD0,Seller shipped this DVD very quickly and it was securely packaged. I can see why people complained about Season 2. It definitely needed more of Crane and Abbie and less of Katrina and Jeremy. I hope they can get Matt Barr back as Nick Hawley in Season 4. Tom and Nick played very well off of each other and I suppose Nick could make a great Witness in Season 4. They would have a wonderful dynamic and counterpoint to each other.,1466812800,,429,4.308641975308642

6709310,5,B00O4CTSD0,"One Demon after another--so what! Great special affects! Very interesting combining history and now! But the best thong of all is the cast! Nicole Is perfect in that she can really act (great singing voice and I guess she dances too). I love her facial expressions--in my opinion she is the prettiest girl on TV!! Tom is also the perfect  ""WITNESS"" with her, they play off of each other so well!! And of course the supporting cast is also EXCELLENT! So a Demon or 2 a week keeps them all busy and let's all of us very much enjoy the ride!",1454630400,,538,4.326732673267327
6709311,2,B00O4CTSD0,I got bogged down in the show after a few episodes. It loses some of thfreshness and originality after the first few episodes. Kind of grags on each episodes with the same general feel as the show before it. Worth seeing but I got tired of watching more than one episode at a time. Never happened to me before like that. Orlando Jones only makes brief appearances in ocassional episodes.,1454457600,,387,4.542857142857143

6709358,4,B00O4CTSD0,"First, my complaint: I absolutely hate what the writers did with Katrina's character (I'll avoid spoilers). They destroyed an amazing marriage lasting through the centuries and turned her into some sort of basket case who was more in love with her son than with her own husband. It would have been a powerful statement by the writers to have Katrina and Ichabod accept the fact that sometimes one's children turn evil and cannot be saved, as in real life. I would love to see them bring Katrina back in Season 3 under the auspices that she was resurrected from a spell cast upon her by their son. I admit, I'm a hopeless romantic sort of guy who wants to see Ichabod and Katrina's love last forever, standing strong with each other.

Otherwise, this is an outstanding show! I like the fact that somehow the show has managed to last two seasons without gratuitous sex. It's good, clean horror fun! Were it not for their silly treatment of Katrina, as noted above, I would easily give this show 5 stars!",1445644800,2,1001,4.592178770949721

6709361,4,B00O4CTSD0,"As an ardent fan of the show, I can say that the season as a whole was not its finest work; still, it rallied at the end and has some very good moments.  Though the season finale features the two lead actors almost exclusively, the DVD set bizarrely lacks commentary with both actors for that episode; Mark Goffman has inserted himself instead, for reasons that surpass understanding.

6709382,2,B00O4CTSD0,"I'm very skeptical about these 5-star reviews, as the fandom has made it quite clear that we were very, very disappointed, frustrated, irritated, worn out with the bait-and-switch of Season 2. It was mediocre at best and infuriating at worst. Basically, what we signed on for in the first season was not what we got in the second season. For whatever reason (the showrunner's obsession with the actress playing Katrina), we were given a lovesick Headless Horseman with a head, a love triangle between Crane, Katrina, and Brom (Headless), with the added bonus of family strife brought on by the son (Henry). Former MAIN characters were sidelined for this and the introduction of Hawley, who, for whatever reason, does the job that Jenny formerly did. The worst was Captain Irving, who, I guess, the writers thought we would just forget about, which would make it easier to get rid of him. They treated his character abysmally for storylines no one asked for, nor needed. The fans signed on for the Witnesses kicking butt, backed up by Jenny and Irving, and we basically got a lopsided family drama x love triangle. Even Crane and Abbie's relationship and chemistry was tested, as they made Abbie a runner for whatever selfish thing Crane wanted on account of his affairs. I won't even go into the chemistry-less, confusing, unnecessary and insulting attempt at a love triangle between Abbie, Jenny, and Hawley. This season was disrespectful to all the characters involved. The writers and showrunners basically tried to make us not care about Abbie, Jenny, and Irving in order to supplant them with Katrina, Brom, and Hawley. And the fandom was not for it; we made it quite clear.",1444003200,4,1679,4.915492957746479

6709394,4,B00O4CTSD0,"I really enjoy this TV show, but I hope those watching do not think that it accurately portrays early U.S. history.  They play fast and loose with the truth. For example, they imply that Daniel Boone fought in the Revolutionary War. Wrong. (He did serve as a teamster in the French and Indian War).  Also, they hint at the distain that Thomas Jefferson and John Adams had for each other, which is true, but imply that Jefferson outlived Adams.  Wrong again!  Oddly enough, they both died on July 4, 1826!  In fact, some of Jefferson's reputed last words were in asking if  he had outlived Adams!  Lastly, in the last episode of season 2 Crane calls for another soldier (in the Revolutionary War) to throw him a 'rifle'. Wrong!! Such weapons, at that time, were called muskets and were much less lethal than what we think of as a rifle. The first American war in which muskets with 'rifled' barrels were used was the Civil War!  From then on the weapon was just called a rifle. Then are many more historical ""gaffs"" in this show.  I guess all this is to be expected as this program certainly falls into the category of Science FICTION.",1443484800,,1134,4.519607843137255

6709404,4,B00O4CTSD0,"There were definitely parts of this season that I didn't like, and it did lack some of the rollercoaster thrilling madness of the first season.  The whole Katrina thing just kept getting hashed, rehashed, and then hashed again.  And then there was the abrupt and unexplained disappearance of Zombie Andy Brooks after the first episode (what, they couldn't find a way to bring him back in after his ""Selfie"" show got cancelled early on?).  But on the positive side, the Witnesses did get some supporting help that actually stuck around for more than one episode (rather than getting killed off almost immediately).  And the end of the season role-reversal...brilliant.

Fingers crossed that season 3 will turn things around and recapture the magic of season 1, even with all the departed cast members and new people that are coming in.

**Big disappointment lay in the fact that one day before this season's DVD came out (9/15/15) it wasn't yet available for sale on Amazon.  I couldn't figure out why preordering this wasn't an option the way it usually is for upcoming releases, and customer service couldn't offer any insight or support on this issue.

Season two started off strong but the show did start to slow down and move away from what I loved which is the friendship of the two witnesses and how they are forced to change as they fight evil. I was not the only one. Once the writers saw that the fans(Sleepyheads) were not happy they moved too get back to what was great about the show. I am sooooooooo happy that we got a season 3. I still would have watched even if the show had stayed the same. Why you may ask would I keep watching if I did not like what the writers were doing?

6709406,5,B00O4CTSD0,"The supernatural drama ""Sleepy Hollow"" gets a second season on ABC.  The first very necessary dramatic event will be to rescue its leading characters, Revolutionary War Army Captain Ichabod Crane and modern day Sleepy Hollow police LT Abbie Mills from the horrifying traps that engulfed them in the thrilling conclusion of Season One.

Over the season, Crane and Mills will improve their skills as a team, holding back the demonic forces seeking to overrun Sleepy Hollow.  They will also have to deal with Mills' former boss Captain Frank Irving and Crane's son Henry Parrish, both seemingly back from the dead, and with Crane's wife, the witch Katrina, whose loyalties may be divided.  Abbie's sister Jennie will return, with her own complicated story involving their mother.  The stage is set for a season of exciting, creepy, and action-filled weekly episodes.  The show will have its moments of humor, as Ichabod Crane finds it easier to pass in Sleepy Hollow as a Revolutionary War reenactor.  The season conclusion is a thriller that leave behind many questions.  Fortunately, ""Sleepy Hollow"" has been renewed for a third season in 2015-2016.

6709407,3,B00O4CTSD0,"Given what a marvelous first season this show had, it's sophomore season is mediocre in comparison.

For some reason, the writers insisted on pushing a number of characters on us that they themselves didn't quite know what to do with (namely Katrina and Hawley).

It's also a bit baffling how they kept trying to put so much focus on Katrina this season...mainly because her storyline was extremely repetitive and she never actually grew as a character and we the audience were never truly given a good reason to like her or root for her.

However, Tom Mison and Nicole Beharie continue to have chemistry that is completely off the charts...seeing their characters work together and play off of one another is one of the biggest reasons the show is worth watching.

While this season is all over the place, I do believe it's worth watching at least once. There are some fantastic episodes (""Mama"" is the best episode of the season in my opinion) and some interesting mythology as well.",1440979200,11,985,4.776470588235294

6709411,4,B00O4CTSD0,"I am actually not a big fan of this genre, but this show is great. The character Henry did get on my nerves a bit because he was very predictable. I was also irritated how they played out the relationship between Icabod and Katrina. Even though I feel Abbie is a better fit for Icabond I hate how tv shows make the wives out to be so intolerable or evil to justify pursuing a sexier relationship with the ""other woman""

But this show is really entertaining and interesting. Season One is better but Season Two is worth watching and buying...to me. I hope Season Three is as good as the first. And since they saw fit to make Icabond a widower I hope they don't play games with his relationship with Abbie. That will be as annoying as Scandal (which is why I don't watch the show anymore). Everyone likes a good love story....even the ""tough"" guys who whine about it.",1430870400,10,865,4.372670807453416
6709412,3,B00O4CTSD0,"Sleepy Hollow is a gem of a show that rises above it's ridiculous premise by having really talented, attractive leads, and a great supporting cast with loads of natural chemistry.  The balance between humor and fun with genre-bending supernatural action is also a plus.

Unfortunately, instead of capitalizing on that, the second season added an unnecessary additional character (Hawley), destroyed the few who were or could have been interesting (Jeremy, Katrina, and Headless) while neglecting the characters fans had grown attached to (Jenny and Irving).

The first few episodes are okay, but the show quickly devolves with a repetitive and uninteresting storyline written for Katrina Crane, who it's pretty clear the writers didn't have a clue what to do with beyond damseled object for manpain, vague shadiness, and sticking her in incongruous, uncomfortable, clothing.

Hawley, a brand new drifter character is another casualty of bad writing. He serves the same function that Jenny could have while being  unnecessary and uninteresting in a love triangle with Abbie and Jenny. Fortunately, that storyline was axed before it could take off.

But it's emblematic of the greater issue with season two.  Just terrible decisions in terms of a plot and characters which made for a very disjointed season full of starts and stops.

There are a few gems, though.

This is War, Go Where I Send Thee, The Weeping Lady, And the Abyss Gazes Back, Mama, Kali Yuga, and Tempus Fugit are all decent episodes.

The rest are a struggle to sit through, unless you're a fan of the Cranes and their drama.",1428364800,12,1592,5.088461538461538
