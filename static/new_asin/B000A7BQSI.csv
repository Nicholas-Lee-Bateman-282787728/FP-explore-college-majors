I thought he might be in one of the films but, the short movies were mostly by unknows, which brings us full circle...I remember when BC was a unknown, and come to think of it, him is still a B level movie star...which is ok with us.",1239753600,,330,4.253968253968254
8075485,5,B000A7BQSI,"I bought this DVD with a bunch of other horror flicks, thinking it would be average. However I was very impressed with the quality of independent film makers out there, especially the work on Edmund Dyers. It has a hot chick and is a wicked tale. I wish there was a book or feature about it. Buy this DVD you will not be disappointed.",1151884800,,334,4.234375
