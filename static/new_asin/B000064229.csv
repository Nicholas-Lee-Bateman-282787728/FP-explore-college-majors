1699195,5,B000064229,"This dvd is incredible.  Went to the Vancouver show (03/08/01) and the dvd captured the true vibe of Roxy in concert. Awesome sound quality, and perfect picture.  Worth every cent. Brian is as dramatic as ever, Phil does a nice job on guitar, Andy's sax is superb, the ""Great"" one beats a mean drum and lets not forget Chris Spedding on guitar who is a legend. Have watched it 3 times already with my uncle, a self-proclaimed Roxy fanatic....if it pleases him, it will please anybody.  P.S. , Brian's new gal pal (the blond bombshell) can be seen throughout the concert (not doing much but looking pretty)  Perhaps she will be on the cover of the next Roxy album!! Do yourself a favour and pick it up.",1033948800,,701,4.496062992125984
1699196,5,B000064229,"Where do I begin? For me, this is an absolutely amazing performance! As a long time Roxy fanatic, this is something to be cherished.
Bryan Ferry and Roxy Music have provided the soundtrack to my life for the last decade. This may seem odd considering that I am only in my mid-twenties and all throughout high school and college, while my classmates were listening to the depressing grunge stylings of Nirvana, or Ganster Rap, or, worse, Dave Matthews, I was indulging my passion for avant-garde rock made in the 70's and 80's.
Whether it was desperately trying to swoon young women (usually in vain) to Avalon, or total, drunken debauchery with their first, eponymous album,Roxy Music was always present in my everyday life and, particularly, in my social circles. Country Life and Vodka & Tonics seemed to go hand in hand.
In the summer of 2001, while I was in the midst one of my most memorable summers to date, I got to see my aging icons live in concert...twice! This is something I never dreamed imaginable. It was undoubtedly the greatest concert experience I have ever witnessed.
But enough of this sentimental mumbo-jumbo! Whether Roxy Music has or hasn't been the soundtrack to your life, or whether you are twenty-something or fifty-something, this is a terrific souvenir of one of the most talented and influential bands of all time. Original members Ferry, Manzanera, Mackay and Thompson are backed by a group of very talented young musicians. The audience goes wild and so will you! Start to finish, this is an amazing concert! As an added bonus, the backstage documentary is a terrific and often humorous look inside it all...
Don't wait....Get this DVD!",1032825600,,1668,4.876760563380282
1699197,5,B000064229,"In this dvd Roxy Music deal successfully with their old and
best materials such as : Lady Tron, Mother of Pearl (total 12
classic songs), Phil Manzanera is great on the guitar and so
Andy Mackay and P.Tompson on drums.
The sound is great (5 stars) and so the pictures (5 stars).",1030838400,7,278,4.365384615384615
1699278,5,B000064229,"Most reunions smack of either desperation or poor judgement. It's a sad attempt to try and recapture lightning in a bottle. That isn't the case with this smart, sharp reunion concert by the four core Roxy Music members. Roxy Music roared out of the hoary cliches of the 60's with a smart, ironic sense of humor and a love of all things pop art. They could easily sail from irony drenched dispatches from the fringe of romance (Bitter's End)to sharpened pile driven riff rock full of desire (All I Want Is You) and still have time for tea.

The band's reunion tour recaptured the fire of their youth; the band sounded sharper than they had in years. Live At The Apollo cruches their last live video (The High Road) and album where the performances were lukewarm at best. By the end, it's clear that the band was weary of being Roxy Music. This great DVD captures the band revisiting their past without wallowing in it. Although it's missing a number of key Roxy songs, the songs that the band performs cover the highlights of their career.  Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzanera, Andy MacKay and Paul Thompson manage to breath new life into these classic songs. While they don't stray too far from the original arrangements, there are a number of minor changes that make the songs still surprising.
Mother of Pearl, Out of the Blue, My Only Love all receive powerful performances. Out of the Blue in particular benefits from the added performance of keyboardist/violinist Lucy Wilkins (she more than fills the shoes of departed members Eddie Jobson & Brian Eno). Colin Good (who performed on both of Ferry's last two solo albums)mans the keyboards while guitar ace Chris Spedding (a contributor to a number of Ferry solo albums and a terrific guitarist on a number of overlooked solo albums)replaces long time second guitarist Neil Hubbard.
All the players do a great job. It's as if Paul Thompson hasn't been away all these years. Both Manzanera and MacKay sound great and are clearly having the time of their lives. While Ferry has lost some of his upper register, his ability to interpret the material has only grown. His delivery isn't always as smooth as it once was but he manages to find the right inflection every time. He's aged well and looks great on stage.
No solo album material is included just the core of the Roxy catalog. The only missing tracks that should have been included is the amazing The Thrill of It All, Prairie Rose, Just Another High, Pyjamarama and Angel Eyes. The sound quality is top notch and the 5.1 mix perfect. Ferry and company haven't forgotten the visual aspect of the show (always an important Roxy element). The nice visual touches only enhance the material.",1045267200,7,2688,4.7414529914529915
1699279,5,B000064229,This is one of the best DVD availble for sound and direction of a live show.  The reunion tour of Roxy showcased great performances and songs by amazing musicians. Play it loud!,1045008000,,177,4.53125
1699280,5,B000064229,"The band, the glitter, the music.
The band still look amazing, the music is just as fresh as it was 30 years ago, and the DVD doesn't hurt either. The picture is crystal clear, the sound perfect. (*As a suggestion, when viewing, ""turn up the music/hi as fi can go""), according to ""Mother of Pearl"".
The songs ranging from early introduction of the band (""Remake/Remodel"" & ""Virginia Plain"") to the dreamy sounds of ""Avalon"" and ""Dance Away"", and a few random Roxy connoiseur favorites thrown in (""In Every Dreamhome a Heartache"", ""Mother of Pearl""), everything is well covered.
There is also a short documentary about the reunion, with interviews with Phil, Andy, and Bryan. Though perhaps some of us weren't so lucky as to see the tour in person, this DVD certainly makes up for it.
Stylish, different, and classic, it's no surprise that Tom Ford of Gucci named Bryan Ferry his ultimate style icon. Do something special, and buy this DVD. I may not have been around during the hey-day of Roxy, or even at the breakup, (being a teenager), I've enjoyed this for everything it contains. I'm sure you will too.",1044748800,,1107,4.740932642487047
1699281,5,B000064229,"I had high expectations for this DVD being a Roxy Music fan of many years... but this actually exceeded them! I went to one of the concert performances in the U.S. and thought it was a great show, but when you are sitting in the audience some distance away you can only see so much. This video succeeds in putting you 'into' the performance. The sound quality, camera work and video production are absolutely first rate and on par with the artistry of the band. This is not a 'concert documentary' with lots of mediocre camera work like so many others, this is a visual and aural work of art in its own right. Clearly they used the ""A-team"" on this one. If you love Roxy Music buy it! You will not be disappointed.",1043193600,,714,4.335820895522388
1699282,5,B000064229,"After getting a 5-speaker surround sound DVD system, I wondered what the heck the big deal was. Sure, action movies sounded & looked really great, but what's the point of surround sound on a film like Erin Brockovich. After watching Roxy's live show, I now know the joys of DVD. The sights & sounds of this disc are quite spectacular. The band is in great form, displaying genuine enthusiasm & affection about being back together. After countles/pointless reunions, here's one that matters. A generation that grew up in the 1990s on the recorded tunes of Roxy Music, but missed out on the real thing, finally had the opportunity to see them on stage. I was fortunate to see them in New York City on this tour & it was very memorable. I feel lucky to have this disc as a souvenir. For your pleasure!",1040947200,3,798,4.548611111111111
1699283,5,B000064229,"I saw the guys in The Guildhall, Plymouth, England 1973 I believe.  Pyjamarama was the latest single.
Brian Eno was still in the band! Awesome gig and years later - 2001 - I get to see the band at Concord Pavilion, California (near San Francisco) and too be honest it brought a massive lump to my throat.
This DVD is probably the best music video I've bought. It's flawless. Great to see Chris Spedding in the band too. Julia Thornton ;)

Yes, Roll N Roll without bass! Only record companies/producers can answer. I guess its probably OK if you only have a stereo system (to be fair, it does sound great on a 2 speaker system). However, I spent so much $ on my high-end home theatre 5.1 surround sound system, Im just disappointed! K Im not going to comment on the picture, song selection, personnel etc since I agree with previous reviewers. Just be forewarned about the sound!",1037664000,,588,4.453703703703703

The songs selected for the concert are superb. I always wondered, however,why Roxy never played the great ""More Than This"" live. Even on their 1982-1983 tour ""The high Road"" they didn't have it on their play list. It is sorely missed here too!
It was nice to see Bryan Ferry at the keyboards on a number of songs.
This DVD is a must have for DVD concert enthusists and Roxy fans. It is nice to see an NTSC Region 1 release finally for this great DVD.",1036800000,2,590,4.184210526315789

""Love is the Drug"" Do the Strand"" and Out of the Blue are masterpieces. You can see the joy they have in doing this concert. Energy level is high ,similair to that of Talking Heads dvd;Stop Making Sense and Cramberries dvd Live in Paris ;these latter two I also highly recommend.

1699287,5,B000064229,"Having seen the band a couple of months before this concert, I was very happy to find this concert recording.  I was happier still when I saw and heard the DVD.  Both the images and the sound are excellent.  If you have a DTS home theater system, the sound is absolutely amazing.  Of course none of this would matter if the performances were poor but here Roxy Music are splendid.  The song selection is perfect and draws from all Roxy Music eras.  Original members Bryan Ferry, Phil Manzanera, Andy MacKay and Paul Thompson are joined by other top notch musicians including Chris Spedding.

7960294,4,B000064229,"I skipped this concert back in the early 2000s when I had the opportunity to see them with a couple friends.  I've never been a fan of band reunions so long after their heydays, as I think they are generally a bit depressing and never seem to live up to earlier energy and quality.  I did not regret that and still don't.

But this DVD fell into my lap as I purchased it as a gift for a relative, and I must say, the viewing was painless and somewhat surprisingly pleasant.  I loved the tracklist choices the band made--lots of vintage Roxy all the way back to their earliest material.  And the early stuff was well-covered--not warmed over or too polished.  Favorites for me:  Mother of Pearl and the closing For Your Pleasure.

It was great to see Roxy's core (minus Eno, who seemed to have no regrets about leaving after their 2nd record) looking healthy and performing in their middle ages, and their musicianship seemed spot-on.  The supporting players were also nicely compelling, notably (for me) Julia Thornton and Lucy Wilkins (who did some admirable Eno-esque keyboard windings), but I also really enjoyed Zev Katz on bass.  Oh, and did I mention that Chris Spedding was there supporting Phil's guitar work and contributing a few brief solos of his own?  He is worthy of a concert by himself.

I took a star off simply because I would have preferred to see these songs performed by the 1980 Roxy Music, but they really put on an excellent show.  And what's not to like about seeing Phil, Bryan, Andy, and monster Paul live and happy?

The bonus footage was also fun to watch--I never tire of seeing such unusual footage of larger-than-life people simply chatting.",1380672000,,1673,4.64625850340136

7960297,5,B000064229,"I liked Roxy Music back in the '70.  I thought they were groundbraking, and for me, the following years proved that they were so in advance on styles and musical formulaes that when these trends came nobody remembered that Roxy did it first, and perfectly.

Ferry is a genius.  To me, there is no question.  He sees, he does !  He also have the ability to introduce novelty, show its potential, keeping it accessible and palatable to anyone who has interest in art and forms.

They were retro before retro, punk before punk, rave before rave, house far before house even had a name.  Ferry weared suits and 50's garments with a streamlined design when the WHAM guys were still eating pablum !!  He sang with a heart and an emotional (and off key ...) voice before Tears for fear was there.  Maybe Bono got the point before the others, still in the end of the '70s.  Rythmic sections, song construction, classics (crooners, rythm & blues, jazz, '30s and '40s hit songs) remake, what weren't they the first to tackle, while Hard Rock was just beginning, before Metal.  They were also a prog rock band, in their very special way, but never entering the 30 minutes opus domain.  Still, if you listen to Yes or Genesis, or Van Der Graaf Generator... you can feel some very Roxy passage.  They were know and famous musicians followed their gigs (Peter Gabriel confessed it !)

And, shall we say, they are classy, and Ferry is class !

So reuniting this band in 2001 for a tour, without lavish money and some 50ish (... or more) musicians, the question had to be answered : can they make Roxy live again on stage ?

Well, with the aid of very talented and informed younger musicians, and most of the orginal ones (Eno is missing but ...), one must admit that it is an excellent work.  It is Roxy !  The sound and video quality is very good (Still, Clapton's Crossroads are amazing and the one to measure by ...), the music is all there, with the benefits of experience and aging.  It sings !  It touches !

I liked very much Ferry's DVD of his performance at The Rex (Paris) in 1999.  I like even more ""Roxy Music Live at the Apollo""!  This is a full package of very Roxy music.  Some of the best, all fine music and performance.

This DVD will run again and again on my projection and music gear.",1326067200,,2290,4.421052631578948

7960299,5,B000064229,"To the people who pu this disc down, open your minds, sit back, turn it loud, and be prepared to get blown away. To a younger generation brought up on Brittney, Usher American Idol, Outkast, and other flavors of the minute, I hope these people can do 1/10th of what Roxy Music did this night  after doing this for thirty some years.
The energy is extraordinary, would have liked a couple of more songs, but this has it all. If Jealous guy doesn,t bring tears to your eyes, and Do the Strand doesn't have you doing the Strand, then you are dead.
If I could give this 10 stars I would. These are masters on top of their craft, consummate professionals, and they enjoyed every minute.
If you haven't bought this, buy it, If you have it show it to everyone you know, it will be worth it.
The only live discs that I have that even come close to this are Manfred Mann Angel Station Live, and Jean Michel Jarre live in Moscow.
these are very good, but for energy in a performance this is the best.

7960301,4,B000064229,"I pretty much agree with the other reviews I've read here. This is a great concert DVD that's spoiled only by the choppy editing. When you watch a concert in real life, you don't spend 2 seconds looking at the drummer, then 1.5 seconds looking at the lead singer then 3 seconds looking at the bass guitarist's left hand, etc... I don't know why so many editors of concert films think they have to continuously keep changing the camera angle every few seconds in order to hold your interest. I would much rather watch an entire Phil Manzanera guitar solo from one camera shot, showing only him, thank you. The Brian Ferry Live in Paris DVD did a much better job in this regard. Other than that, it's a great DVD. Good sound and some great performances by Ferry, Manzanera et al. There are even a couple of unexpected, more obscure Roxy tunes included, such as ""Mother of Pearl"". The bonus tracks include a brief documentary with the band and an option to watch the concert with the song lyrics appearing in subtitles! I've never seen that on any concert video before. I only wish I knew more people who were Roxy fans so I could invite them over to watch this! Some bands are better off never re-uniting, but that can't be said about Roxy- they sound as good or better than ever.",1062374400,10,1278,4.465811965811966

Their style and music have graciously aged without that ""mere re-hashing of old memories"" feeling.  The sound is wonderful and the concert footage is fairly straight-forward without annoying special effects.  At times the cuts between camera angles were a bit distracting but I didn't find it overwhelming.
My only complaint is Lucy Wilkins synthesizer on the first few songs.  It's grating, screeching, distracting, too loud and out of place with the rest of the band.  For a moment I actually thought my stereo was picking up some type of interference from a local police radio or something.  Thankfully, this only lasts a few songs.  Later on Ms. Wilkins shows her amazing talent with more subtle synthesizer work and masterful violin (which at the live show was the highlight of the evening).",1053993600,2,898,4.97986577181208
