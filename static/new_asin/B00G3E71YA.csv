Her soothing vocalization, demonstration of technique, evocative background music and offering the practice at the beginning of the class. That was neat.  (especially the chanting) makes YOGA UNLEASHED a program that will 'unleash'your inner yogi.

Planning to mix up my workout with more from Unleashed body series. Perfect at home workout!",1397779200,,418,5.4
6052253,5,B00G3E71YA,I have been lucky enough to take Heidy's class and this gal is an amazing instructor! So happy I can now take her awesome class in the privacy of my home too!!!,1385596800,,160,4.03125
8620380,1,B00G3E71YA,I was disappointed with this purchase. I'm a beginner with yoga so I need someone who says the name of each move and whether you're breathing in and out (for the first couple times at least). There's virtually none of that and you have to constantly look up to see what move she's on. Not cool.,1456012800,,294,4.267857142857143
8620381,5,B00G3E71YA,"Heidy is a wonderful teacher and her video is like being in a private lesson.  I can very clearly see each position, how to align my back, knees, hips and arms.",1405036800,,160,4.161290322580645
8620382,5,B00G3E71YA,"A few years ago I dipped my foot in the 'yoga pool'.
It took a while, but it's really become a passion and I love letting people know how it can really transform your body. ..
Now at 56, I can honestly say I'm in the best shape of my life. When I take Yoga at my health club, I can do moves even the younger men and women can't.  I feel good in the knowledge I'm doing what I can to stay in the best shape possible as my body ages.
I have almost 200 fitness dvd's- I'm a big fan of working out at home too- and this is the first-and only series i found where the host took the time to provide an option where you can opt to listen to affirmations and gentle encourgement instead of the instructions.
It's a nice touch- that's why I'm giving Heidy 5 stars.",1404086400,,755,3.934640522875817
8620383,5,B00G3E71YA,"Being someone who is into yoga but not super into it, I really like it. I like that I can do it at home and be guided.",1402099200,,118,3.4074074074074074
8620384,5,B00G3E71YA,"So glad I discovered this Yoga dvd on Amazon - it arrived quickly and I tried it the very same day, and have been coming back ever since. It's true what they say . There's no magic formula to being in great shape. I finally stopped making excuses for myself and have never looked back. I'm doing the work and feeling great about myself. Hope this review motivates at least one reader to get this (or any other good program) and put it to the test.",1399593600,,447,4.209302325581396
8620385,5,B00G3E71YA,"For a recent devotee to yoga, this will be a great addition for times when I cannot get to the gym.",1399507200,,99,3.761904761904762
8620386,5,B00G3E71YA,"The host is very charismatic and her
direction is encouraging and calming. This is a program that's a little
challenging, but there are no time-wasting moves.
I've never bought a fitness dvd that had a motivational-soundtrack option.
I wasn't sure what to expect, but it's a great idea, Just a little extra incentive,
in lieu of a personal trainer.",1399507200,2,348,4.915254237288136
8620387,5,B00G3E71YA,"I friend highly recommend Heidy T. The Unleashed Body: Yoga Unleashed. I was skeptical because many yoga instructors start with movements that I a beginner cannot do. But this DVD is great because she not only is patient but explains the benefits of all of the movements. This helps greatly in understanding why I should try to do the movement.

Bravo, from the skeptical stiff!!! I am hooked!",1399507200,,393,4.779411764705882
8620388,5,B00G3E71YA,"My wife just received this from me as a gift for Mother's Day.  She said ""It's perfect for me as I'm home all day and just what I need to keep me going.""",1399507200,,153,3.6363636363636362
8620389,5,B00G3E71YA,"Easy to follow, great pace.  Love it!  Great for Beginners or regular Yoga enthusiasts.  The stretches are easy and the results are noticeable.",1399507200,,143,5.130434782608695
