8308430,5,B001HB7158,"Picture three of the world's very best blues-rock musicians going into the studio to play their latest collaboration, but with a video crew on hand to capture the moment, and then kick it up a notch or two.

Drummer Kenny Aronoff and bassist Mark Browne lock in to a tight groove, supporting the amazing, jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring guitar work of Philip Sayce. These guys play with the energy and intensity befitting a team of Olympic Atheletes.

There is a moment on one of the later tracks when Sayce, Aronoff and Browne take it ""outside"" -- the blues-rock equivalent of John Coltrane's Ascension album -- and then seamlessly bring it back into 4/4 time; totally floored me the first time I watched it.

The video includes a brief interview with the legendary engineer-producer Eddie Kramer, who predicts that it's simply a matter of time before Sayce's extrordinary talent gets the recognition he so richly deserves.",1244332800,,920,5.0
