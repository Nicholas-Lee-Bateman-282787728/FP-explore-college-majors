2335181,5,B0009XT8A6,"At the end of World War II, as oil hungry companies try to move into the jungles of Ecuador, one isolated tribe, the Waodani, tries to hold them at bay with only spears, and many lives are lost on both sides. At the same time, the tribe is killing each other off at an alarming rate because of unchecked anger and a lawless culture that settles its differences at the end of a spear. Into this primitive society come five young missionary men determined to convert the people to Christianity. It's the ultimate test of courage and faith. Even though it seems they are making progress in their contact with the people, in 1956 they are speared to death as the result of a tribal feud. The men have guns, but refuse to use them, reasoning that they were prepared for Heaven but the Waodanis were not.

Now the wives of the slain men must decide what to do. Two of them - Elisabet, wife of Jim Elliot, and Rachel, wife of Nate Saint - determine to pick up where their husbands left off, believing the tribe will treat women differently. They contact two women who have fled the tribe, and with their help move their children and belongings into one of the villages. There they teach them the Bible - God's carvings - and eventually befriend the very men who killed their husbands. The people repent of their life of unchecked killing and decide to follow Christ, causing their homicide rate to drop 90%. One of the tribesmen - the one who led the 1956 attack on the five missionary men - becomes a grandfather figure to one of the missionary children, whom he helps raise; and one of the missionary daughters, when she is baptized, insists on having the ceremony take place in the river where her father was killed and between two of the men who killed him.

This is an endearing documentary of the power of forgiveness and how the love of Christ can transform a people. Director Jim Hanon, who also wrote the screenplay, did a superb job marrying still shots, actual home movies from the time, vintage film clips, new footage and dramatizations into a coherent whole. He based his script on the best-selling book, Through the Gates of Splendor, by Elisabet Elliot. One may ask the question, ""Why did those men have to die?"" But I believe the film shows that they were the seeds that brought forth the harvest of an entire people, and gave witness to the world that there is something more precious than one's own life. Their story will appear again as a feature film in January, 2006 called End of the Spear.

Just a note: I got to hear composer Ron Owen - who wrote the music for this film, as well as that of End of the Spear - speak at the San Antonio Independent Christian Film Festival this year, and to speak with him briefly. He is a self-effacing man with a heart for God and outstanding musical ability. The score for End of the Spear is wonderful, as I believe the film will be. I love the hearts of those five men and their families, who sacrificed everything for a people they didn't even know; as well as the hearts of these filmmakers. Please pray for them, and that God will raise up others like them.

2335182,4,B0009XT8A6,"The file Beyond the Gates of Splendor deals with the murder of five missionaries in Ecuador and the further contact of their families with an idigenous group known as the Aucas.

Prior to the point where missionaries came in, the Aucas were a murderous people. After repeated contact, they came to know a new way of life. According to the anthropologist in the film, they came into a new way of thinking. If you read outside of the lines, you could say they met God (perhaps this ""outside of the line"" process is what caused one reviewer to regard this as fundamentalist propaganda?).

The film contains file footage of both the missionaries and the Aucas, along with interspersed interviews with all of the surviving members. Overall, it is well done and rather low key in its approach.

Overall, it is a film that will make you feel good about humanity, which all of us could use from time to time.",1129680000,6,900,4.6125
2335183,5,B0009XT8A6,"I came here to write a review on ""BEYOND THE GATES OF SPLENDOR"", but felt the need to completely contradict a review below by a reviewer by the name of ""Reluctant Cheesehead"". How pathetic that this ""Reluctant Cheesehead"" individual is so brainwashed by ""leftwing politics""... He/She called Beyond the Gates of Splendor ""Fundamentalist Christian Propaganda"" and actually believes these missionaries were sent to Ecuador to pave the way for oil companies...who is he kidding?

  BEYOND THE GATES OF SPLENDOR is hands down one of the most incredible stories that a ""heartfelt"" Christian will ever see or hear. How do I know? Because I screened Beyond the Gates with hundreds of Christians and many told me so. Beyond the Gates of Splendor is one of the most powerful and enlightning examples how God will reveal his ""GLORY"" even through such an unbelievable human tragedy as the death of 4 missionaries. I would not expect an non-Chrisitan to appreciate the full magnitude of the events in Beyond the Gates of Splendor or the sacrifice of these missionaries. As for the real Christians I can gaurantee that the story of these missionaries at some point will leave you teary eyed or questioning the depth of your own humility. The sacrifice of these missionaries and what transpired is just absolutely unbelievable. Need a lesson in forgiveness? You'll get a good lesson after watching Beyond the Gates.

  As to testify how America's Christian ideals have changed in the nearly 50 years since these missionaries dissappeared - when news of their disappearence made headlines hundreds of citizens went down to Ecuador to help locate them. As soon as it was discovered they were murdered the U.S. military was sent down to Ecuador to capture their murderers. The plight of the missionaries was even addressed by the President (Eisenhower) at the time and the story was a major headline here in America for weeks if not months...front page news. Today a story like this would rarely get acknowledged in the media moreless such an outpouring of so many willing to go to the aid of 4 Christians' lost in a battefield halfway around the world. Beyond the Gates of Splendor will be the most inspiring stories that a Christian will see or hear in their life. As for those who are part of the leftist new age anti-Chritian movement I doubt that they would get much at all from this documentary... To them this docmentary is about nothing, but a bunch of stupid rightwing republicans with some political agenda who went down to Ecuador for the sake of oil and got the death they deserve.",1128816000,22,2575,4.867579908675799

2335185,5,B0009XT8A6,"It's not very often that a movie (or documentary if you like) comes along with a story as powerful and beautifully told as Beyond the Gates of Splendor. At the time (January 1956) it seemed like such a tradegy and waste of life when 5 missionaries were killed in Ecuador at the hands of the Waodani. This film goes on to tell the incredible story since then of forgiveness and love on the part of the family members left behind. Not only is this an amazing story but the film is does exceptionally well weaving loss, tears, saddness with an occasional interjection of laughter to help the viewer through to the end.

2335187,5,B0009XT8A6,"It's rare when a genuinely inspiring, authentically spiritual true story breaks into the secular market place. BEYOND THE GATES OF SPLENDOR (Fox) is a critically acclaimed, word of mouth hit about the unexpected relationships families of murdered missionaries have with the native killers.

At its heart, it is about nothing less than sacrifice (human) and redemption (Godly).

This artistic, feature-length documentary story is set among the Ecuadorian Waodani Indians and the missionary men and women who gave their lives to reach them.

In late 1956, around this time of year, the Los Angeles Times featured headlines that said: ""SAVAGES KILL FIVE MISSIONARIES.""  It was a big, brutal story that jolted the hearts of readers safely ensconced in the Eisenhower era.

I was not ready for the emotional intensity of this memorable story that begins with Waodani tribe person describing their way of life prior to the missionaries' arrival.

Primitive, archival home movies from the missionary families are intercut with sharp, colorful, contemporary interviews with the Waodani.

What is so astonishing is seeing how faith and forgiveness can bring love and healing in the most unexpected and extreme of circumstances.

This superb documentary is an adaptation of Elisabeth Elliot's book.  A theatrical feature based on the murders and aftermath, ""End of the Spear,"" will be released in 2006.",1128038400,104,1392,5.377880184331797
2335188,5,B0009XT8A6,"My family and I live in Panama and we were involved in the filming of ""End of the Spear"", a soon-to-be-released feature film made by the same production company and based on the stories in this documentary.  I can testify to the very high caliber of the director and all the people involved in making these films.  This documentary is well-made, and makes this true story of missionaries gripping and relevant.  By the end you feel like you have met these men and understood their story.

It tells the story of 5 missionaries and their families.  They were trying to reach a savage group of killers, the Waoranis of Ecuador, with the message of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.  Through a number of misunderstandings, the Waoranis killed these men, not understanding that they wanted to be friends.  Years later several family members of the murdered missionaries tried again to reach the Waoranis.  They lived among them and shared God's love with them, and today the Waorani culture and people have transformed.  Today the murderers of those missionaries are like family members to the missionaries' families.  The story is told through film footage, still photos and interviews with surviving participants.  The Waoranis' interviews are in their language, with English subtitles.

This film is appropriate for all ages.  It's refreshing to see the story of people so dedicated to an ideal that they will die for it.  And then to see these former savage killers, together with the families of those they killed - wow, it's powerful stuff.  Near the end of the shoot here in Panama, we spent an incredible evening meeting both the Waoranis featured in the documentary and several of the family members of the missionaries.  The joy and love you see in this film is authentic.  The forgiveness and genuine peace among these people, we saw it in them in person.

Be sure to go see ""End of the Spear"", due to be released in January 2006.  A lot of the events in it are based on this documentary and the reminiscences you see in it.",1126483200,95,2024,4.764367816091954

Steve Saint managed to get all five wives on film (two died not long after this film was made) and also at least two of the killers. It is disconcerting to listen to the Aucas (with subtitle translation) describe their former murderous way of life. Every one of them had a story of tribal brutality to tell, and it is hard not to draw parallels between the Auca's vendetta-based way of life, and what goes on in many inner cities of the U.S. today. And the pain expressed by the widows, who each lost a husband when they were all so young and just starting their families, was still wrenching. Several of the women had premonitions, either in dreams or just when saying good bye to their men, that they would never see them again.

2335230,4,B0009XT8A6,"This documentary starts off a little slow as the background is set. The background of the missionaries starts a little further back than is necessary for the story but I would have preferred a little more about the everyday life of the Waodani, before and after the missionaries made contact.
However the story is about the change of the natives from a very violent people to a peaceful people, and how the missionaries' widows and eventually the missionaries' children became the true missionaries to the Waodani after the Waodani had killed the men who first made peaceful contact with them. It is an amazing story of both the Waodani's acceptance of a new way of life and of the ability of the missionaries' widows to forgive and still help the people who killed their husbands for no reason. (Or actually for a lie, this is discussed in length in the film.) The further the story goes the more interesting it was to me. Near the end of the film I really enjoyed hearing the way the older Waodani man described the Untied States after he returned from a visit.
The film combines current interviews with the survivors of the missionary families and interviews with natives (both of the Waodani tribe and others from nearby tribes) with actual video footage and still photographs of the early days of contact with the Waodani. There is a moderate amount of tribal nudity in the old footage since the native wore only a very small loin cloth which covered only the genitals. All of the native woman in the early videos and photographs were topless, and neither the males nor females had any cover of they backsides. Also all of the native children ran around totally nude which continued with the younger ones after the adults and older children started wearing western clothing. One of the missionary girls is also seen nude playing with the native children at times.
If you liked ""At Play in the Fields of the Lord"" (1991 staring Tom Berenger, John Lithgow and Daryl Hannah) and ""The Mission"" (1986 staring Robert De Niro and Jeremy Irons) you will probably also like this film.

After reading this book I am left with a further acknowledgement of our God as the Great Orchestrator.  This book is about how God takes sacrifices and obedience and creates blessings beyond measure.  That is His specialty!

The very men in the tribe, who were responsible for the deaths of the missionary men, came to know the Lord through the missionary wives and children.  The man responsible for Steve's father's death came to ""adopt"" Steve into his family as his own son.  Steve lived with the tribe as a boy and learned jungle skills.

2335235,1,B0009XT8A6,"Both the full version and the abridged version of this movie are on the same disc.  (Turn disc over for the abridged version.)  First, I watched the full version and was very disappointed in it.  If a viewer did not know the story going into this movie, they would not understand how the Waodani truly became changed people. The gospel is not mentioned at all...that the natives witnessed God's love through the example of the missionaries that lived with them after the murder is not explained at all.  In fact, the movie begins with comments by a couple of anthropologists and ends with their humanistic theory of why the Waodani changed: Because they came to 'see' that there was another way to respond to situations...that they didn't always need to resort to killing as their response! Not one word of God's saving grace, not one word about God changing the hearts of the Waodani...nothing!
  Then I watched the abridged version and it was a tad better.  First, the anthropologists with their statements were edited out.  Second, there were several times when Scripture verses or pertinent quotes were shown in between segments that could possibly give a very, very tiny bit more of enlightenment as to why the Waodani became changed people.  Still... lacking...not the complete story of how and why God changed the hearts of the people.
  If all you want are facts (Who, What, When, and Where) then this is for you.  If you are looking for this movie as a witnessing tool, this is not for you.  If you want to hear the amazing story of how, through faith in Christ the most murderous of peoples did a 180, or how God wrought the amazing work of forgiveness in the hearts of the missionaries, enabling them to go back and live among the Waodani...this is not for you.

2335256,1,B0009XT8A6,"There were so many people interviewed, and I was unsure who each person was and his/her connection to the others.  I was unable to make sense of it, and feel that I probably should have read the book first.  This film was poorly edited; it could have benefited from a more detailed narration.  I would recommend this for someone who is already intimately familiar with the story and the various parties involved.  It's as if the filmmakers are egocentric and believe that the viewer already knows what they know, hence, no explanation is necessary.

As far as the actual story goes, it was pretty much a complete turn-off to me.  The interviewees were scarily upbeat, which I thought was inappropriate in light of the horrible events being described.  Some of them reminded me of creepy cult members, who are in denial and out of touch with reality.  The only person who came across as being honestly authentic was Frank Drown, the man who found the bodies of the murdered men, who choked up on camera.  The other Americans, some of them surviving family members of the murdered men, seemed way too cheerful.

It was hard for me to understand the indigenous peoples--murder is a way of life for them, so apparently slaughtering people is no big deal.  Obviously they have different values from Americans, but it was unnerving, listening to them relate stories about their own tribesmen being murdered and chopped up, then grinning about it.  I don't understand what is amusing about this.  Perhaps the filmmakers could have spent more time helping the viewer to get to know these people and their values, because frankly, they came across as psychopathic.

I would like to know more about this story; however, apparently the only book on the subject was written by the widow of one of the murdered men.  After seeing the odd and unnerving behavior of the survivors, I have no desire to read this book.  I hope that someday an objective writer can write something which is not affected by religious brainwashing.",1323475200,,2011,4.8023255813953485

2335280,5,B0009XT8A6,"First, I need to say that this documentary does not seem so much non-fiction at all -- it flows like a terrific novel. Here's the story in a nutshell:

Several Christian missionary families travel to Ecuador in the 1950s where the menfolk decide to secretly make contact with a dangerous and murderous indigenous culture. They go about it pretty shrewdly, first offering presents down a rope from the safety of an airplane. They could hardly know that *spearing* one another to death was a cultural mindset of these natives.

Eventually, the men land their small airplane on a river sandbar and make some friends -- but there were internal tensions within the group at that particular time which resulted in all five men being killed. A search was conducted as Americans, having read about the episode in the news, held their collective breath. But the ultimate report was, of course, the worst sort of news.

However, the endearing facet of the story evolved as the *wives* and children of these five brave men followed up by making further contact with the tribe members and actually become a part of their family! It's really an astonishing story and the entire tale is incredibly well-told.

I'm not a big fan of either jungle missionary work (which I have always viewed as interference with indigenous cultures) or of documentary films because they are typically so stiff. But this episode in Ecuador (and American) history somehow seems different. I have to give this fine film my highest recommendation for anyone who enjoys a good story.",1301097600,,1545,4.908045977011494

It shows interviews, film footages and how the 5 families answered God's calling to head to Ecuador to reach out to the Waodani, known to be extremely violent. After their husbands were speared to death, it is extremely heart-felt of what is meant by true forgiveness, with some of the survivors (wives and children) accepting the invitations to head back to the very same village who speared to death their husbands. This is how within 1 generation the Waodani can change from an extremely violent tribe to a peaceful one - these transformations come about from the love of Jesus shown to them by the sacrifice of the 5 missionaries and their families who came to live and share their lives with the Waodanis.

In this documentary, Steve Saint, the son of Nate Saint, shares his childhood growing up and then living among them.

It recounts the real life story of a group of American missionaries who were reaching out to the savage Waodani tribe of Ecuador in the mid 1950s. They were attempting to share the Gospel with a group that was well known for its culture of murder.

After five of the men were killed by the tribe, some of their wives and children contined to pursue their evangelizing work.  The love, forgiveness, and faith demonstrated by these Christian workers is nothing short of amazing.

I do not want to share too much more to avoid spoiling the story.  Suffice it to say that this is one film that will likely leave viewers with goosebumps and a profound sense of awe at the amazing work that God can do to change the hearts of people.

I recommend this for anyone.  Along with this documentary, I also heartily endorse 'The End of The Spear', which is a drama based upon these events.  Both are well worth watching.",1248566400,,994,4.544943820224719

This is a fascinating and personal follow-up to ""Gates of Splendor"", the movie about the martyred missionaries in South America.  When the five men were killed, there was international interest enough to warrant the movie and it served to tell the story of the men, their mission, and their daily challenges.  As with most movies, there was a lot left out or allocated to the imagination.
""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" is a very personal look at the support systems in place, the families and the risks they took, and allows those actually involved to tell their stories without script or actor's lines.
It also helps the viewer understand why the five men took such risks, touches on the devastating options to these feared tribes who were killing each other to the point of extinction, and spells out acts of dedication, initiative and extreme courage on the part of the women involved after the men were killed.

2335327,5,B0009XT8A6,"While I give five stars for the documentary itself, I have to give a big BUYER BEWARE on this DVD version.  This DVD is only sold in the ""full frame"" version which is the obsolete, nearly-square aspect designed for older TV's.  Much of the film image is missing as compared to the original, wide theatrical aspect.  Sure, current widescreen TV's will stretch the image to fit the screen but one is still not seeing everything that the filmmaker intended to be viewed.  This reformatting also mitigates the panning effects of the camera that added to the impact of the film.  What's also frustrating is that on the back cover of the case, the manufacturer defines ""full frame"" in a way that leads one to believe that the viewer is seeing the entire image of the film in the same aspect as it was viewed in its theatrical presentation.  That's not the case!  As soon as one begins to view the film there's that dreaded disclaimer, ""This film has been modified...""  Hopefully this film will be reissued on DVD in its proper widescreen format.  Regardless this documentary is still a must-see.

If you're not sure about a DVD's format read the specs on the case. If it says the ratio is 1.33/1 or 4:3 then that's the old, obsolete format for squarish TV's.  If it says 1.77/1 or 16:9 or something close to those ratios then the film is presented in widescreen which would be appropriate for films that were intended for theatrical release.",1218931200,3,1435,4.632411067193676

Nevertheless they didn't really explain what was the message or intention if any that these missionaries went there to bring to the indians except to tell them that they need to stop killing each other.

Having ourselves served for years in Ecuador as missionaries, and having visited Rachel Saint just six months before she passed away, the subject is very important to us.

We were not disappointed. ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" is well structured and informative, and makes and excellent video for church groups and missionary inspirational purposes. It also contains some remarkable anthropological insights into the sociological aspects of stone age tribes in remote areas. Best of all, it accurately portrays in thorough but not tedious detail the lives of those who were killed in January, 1956, and what happened to the families and loved ones left behind. Great editing sews together interviews, period photos, and contemporary footage of life with the Huaranis. The omission of sentimentality and contrived drama accentuates the true drama of five young men who walked ""through the Gates of Splendor,"" and how their grieving families chose to follow their lead and work for the redemption of those who had murdered them.

I highly recommend this video as the best thing going (with all due respect to the ""End of the Spear"") and suitable for education, edification, and inspiration, even if it is not intended for light entertainment purposes.",1184371200,7,1486,5.319148936170213

You have many Indians telling you pieces of the story, mentioning people's names that you don't have any idea who they are. Then come the missionaries (one assumes they are Christians, though this point wasn't made that explicit either) talking about such and such. By minute 30 I still didn't know who was who, or who was married to whom, etc. Very aggravating. I got the story alright. But the presentation is, I regret to say, very poor and disorganized.

Gone from the documentary are any mentions of the name of the Lord Jesus Christ (how can you have this possible in a documentary  about how the Lord changed the lives of an entire tribe?).  There is a tremendous gaping hole in what were the motivations of Nate Saint, Jim Elliot, and the other missionaries in going to Ecuador.  There is absolutely nothing about their love for the Lord Jesus Christ and their desire to spread the gospel to an unreached people.

The gospel is not even mentioned through the documentary.  At one point, the anthropologist interviewed mentions that the Waodani changed from their warring lifestyle because they were given 'new information' from the missionaries.  What was this 'new information?'  The documentary completely fails to mention that this was none other than the gospel of the Lord Jesus Christ, and that the entire tribe changed because they all got saved!

If you must choose between End and Beyond, choose the latter.  It is better and more accurate to match the book, End of the Spear, with the documentary, Beyond the Gates of Splendor.  I have little good to say of the movie, but the book and documentary should be read or viewed with caution; it may change your life.  The story of sacrifice and devotion in the lives of so many caught up in God's sovereign love is best told through honest testimony than by vain entertainment.  Truly inspiring and encouraging.  I also strongly recommend the book, Jungle Pilot.  It is the story of Steve Saint's father, Nate.  Consider Jungle Pilot to be the prequel to Beyond the Gates of Splendor.

In my opinion this movie makes these men's lives seem to be wasted in vain.  I want to believe that this story was actually played out in real life differently than this documentary portrays.  The thing that disturbs me is that unless the women were severely edited, they too displayed no relation to Jesus or mention of Him.  Again it must be the way it is depicted, I prayerfully hope.  I can't judge these families as I don't know them, all I can tell you is how it is portrayed as a review of this sorry film.

2335426,5,B0009XT8A6,"""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" is a fantastic overview of the story of five missionaries who were killed while trying to make contact with a tribe of Indians in Ecuador who were basically living in the stone age, and who had very little, if any, prior contact with other peoples.  This was a tribe that was known for killing each other, to the point that most of them did not survive past the age of 30.  The story is not just about the death of the missionaries, however - it is a story of redemption and forgiveness, as the sister, wives, and son of some of the slain missionaries later go into the jungle and befriend the same people who had killed their loved ones.  If you don't believe that God is real and can change hearts, you need to hear this story and discover how God used the death of these men to reach the very ones who had speared them to death.

2335451,5,B0009XT8A6,"This documentary tells the story about Jim Elliot, Pete Fleming, Nate Saint, Ed McCully and Roger Youdarian, American missionaries working in Ecuador. They had learned of a savage Indian tribe that had killed several Shell Oil company employees. The Aucas were so violent that six of every 10 deaths were homicides committed against each other by spearing. Fearless, the missionaries initiated contact through an ingenious method of lowering a bucket of gifts from a small airplane. As Nate Saint flew the bright yellow single-engine Piper PA-14 overhead, banking it in a tight circle, a bucket was lowered on a long rope. It remained nearly motionless, just long enough for several curious Aucas to help themselves to the contents. This continued for several months. Thinking they had gained the tribe's trust, the missionaries landed their plane on a sand bar in the Curaray River. Over the ensuing days, they made several friendly, face-to-face encounters and even gave one of the Aucas, Naenkiwi, a ride in the plane. But on January 8, 1956, all five missionaries were attacked and brutally murdered. The world recoiled in horror. The images of the mutilated bodies, recovered from the Curaray River, appeared in newspapers across the county. LIFE Magazine ran a 10-page story on the incident. It seemed to be nothing more than a tragic loss. But what happened next could be viewed as one of the greatest acts of forgiveness in the 20th century: Two years later, Elisabeth Elliot, Jim Elliot's wife, and Rachel Saint, Nate Saint's sister, went to live with the tribe, now known as the Waodani. The women studied the tribe's language and learned their culture. Their demonstration of forgiveness to the men who murdered their loved ones so moved the Waodani, they were given the opportunity to share the greatest story of forgiveness-Christ's death on the cross. Many of the Indians were converted to Christianity. The murder rate dropped 90 percent. Years later, Steve Saint, Nate Saint's son, moved his family from Florida to live with the Waodani. His children now call Mincaye, one of the tribal elders, ""grandfather,"" even though he killed their real grandfather. January 8, 2006 marked the 50th anniversary of the deaths of these five missionaries. ""Beyond the Gates of Splendor"" recounts this story of forgiveness that sprang from martyrdom with interviews of Elisabeth Elliot, Rachel Saint and the wives and colleagues of the other missionaries. Many of the Waodani also appear in the documentary, which contains original footage shot in the jungles of Ecuador. It is a riveting and poignant documentary with a surprising humorous segment towards the end when Mincaye is brought to the United States and recounts his experiences at a supermarket and a fast-food drive up window.

I was a child of 11 in 1956 and I recall everyone being glued to the TV when the story first broke into the national news in the USA.  It was a story then to me and my family what the shotting of JFK and 9/11 were in later years.

It contains what most ""hollywood"" movies attempt to master - relationships, love, humor, death, joy, murder, grudges, forgiveness, changed lives, first loves, coming of age, raising kids, drama, everyday life, etc. etc. - except it is true and the people, some still alive, are real.

Many who watch this DVD probably do believe in God, but it contains truth and fact that even the most skeptical among us will not refute.  As the specialist Anthropologists in the DVD say, a violent tribe changed its murderous ways based on its access to ""new information"", and just in time to avoid its own pending extinction.

If you cry toward the end, your tears will instantly be dried as you laugh through the supermarket scene - just a hilarious commentary on our ""huge food storehouses"".

2335526,5,B0009XT8A6,"""Beyond the Gates Of Splendor"" is the incredible story of five missionary families who go to Ecuador in the 1950's. Their mission suffers a tremendous tragedy when four of the men decide to attempt to make contact with the Waodani tribe, a culture considered to be among the most violent in the world according to anthropologists. Three Waodanis come out to meet the men and the two groups interact with pleasure and curiousity. But when two of the tribal members, lovers whose relationship is opposed by the tribe, return they make up a story about being attacked by the ""foreigners"" in order to explain why they had gone off without their escort. The tribe then proceeds to attack and kill the four missionaries waiting by the river. Of course, their families are shattered by this tragedy. But, later on, two of the female missionaries return to Ecuador along with their children. They eventually befriend several of the Waodani women who had left the jungle and finally ended up going back to live with the Waodanis in their rainforest home for several years.

By the way, I am an atheist who feels that some missionary work can, in fact, have a largely negative impact on the indigenous peoples they are trying to convert. But even I was moved by the the sense of dedication and forgiveness shown by these women when they went to live with the same Waodanis who had murdered their husbands. But, even more so, I was interested in this movie from an anthropological point of view. It was fascinating to hear the comments of the anthropologists who had gone from working with one of the world's most peaceful tribes in Malaysia to now studying one of the most violent in the Waodanis. It also showed how much all human beings ultimately have in common, as the Waodanis interviewed were generally shown to be intelligent, sensitive people who had formed close friendships with the missionaries and their children despite the fact that the two cultures were so extremely different. It was also inspiring to see how, within a generation, the Waodanis had changed from being an extraordinarily violent society, based on blood feuds and vendettas, to an apparently peaceful one. They were even learning to use advanced technology, including one guy who had learned to fly and repair a small airpane which he used to transport his fellow Waodanis to a town with a hospital. I especially liked when the film showed the Waodanis watching old footage from World War II. The Waodanis considered the bomber pilots to be the worst type of ""savages"" because they were killing people that they didn't even know. In other words, don't get too self-righteous about our ""advanced civilization"" because even one of the world's most violent tribes is appalled by the methods of modern warfare.

Beyond the incredible story, this is also a well made and beautifully shot documentary which kept me intensely absorded the entire time. My wife, a latina who grew up in Ecuador, was also captived. She said, during her childhood, the Waodanis had a reputation among all Ecuadorians as an especially violent and aggressive people. In fact, one of her sisters, who was considered to have a bad temper, was nicknamed ""Auca"" (another name for the Waodanis) and the family would make fun of her by imitating Waodani dances when she would get mad. They even had a fake spear made up for her as a joke.

I would recommend this movie to anyone, but especially those interested in indigenous societies and the vast potentialites of human nature and human culture.",1131840000,50,3533,4.846026490066225
