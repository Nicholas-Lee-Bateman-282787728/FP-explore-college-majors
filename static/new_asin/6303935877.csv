What I now see is the beginnings of Anime in it.  A foreshadowing of this genra.  Try it as see what I mean.",1178409600,4,332,3.91044776119403
732459,5,6303935877,"As stated on the back of the video-sleeve itself:

Glittering with enchantment and brimming with jaunty songs, here's an animated legend certain to be a highlight in your collection!  Featuring the incredible vocal talents of Frankie Avalon, Dodie Stevens, Jonathan Winters, Sterling Holloway, and Arnold Stang, this masterpiece thrilled audiences in the early '60s.  Now, you can relive the magic with this sensational remastered widescreen presentation!

Mystical Majutsoland has a brave new animal king: Alakazam The Great.  But he's a rude young monkey, and when he learns the magic of Merlin, his great powers make him even more arrogant!  Alakazam joins human prince Amat on a pilgrimage to learn the meaning of virtue.  On the journey, they make new friends and fight perilous battles with wicked foes and menacing creatures.  Finally Alakazam gains the experience to be a true leader!  When they return to the palace, the Great King Amo commends Alakazam!  Together, Alakazam and Dee Dee, his loyal and charming admirer, will rule the animal kingdom... and live happily ever after!",1115510400,4,1089,5.27906976744186

732461,3,6303935877,"ALAKAZAM THE GREAT (1961) was the English-dubbed version of the Japanese animated feature, SAIYUKI (1960), an adaptation of ""Journey to the West,"" the Chinese literary work devoted to the famous legend of the Monkey King. It was distributed in the U.S. by American International Pictures and featured a whole new music score, four new songs and a host of celebrity voices, including Jonathan Winters, Arnold Stang, Sterling Holloway and, as the singing voice of the Monkey King, Frankie Avalon.
The English dub goes a long way towards divorcing the material from its cultural context, reducing the original mission of its characters, bringing Buddhist scriptures to China from India, to simply a ""pilgrimage."" It also gives ridiculous new names to all of the characters, including Buddha himself (called King Amo here) and the Emperor of Heaven (renamed Merlin the Magician!). Goku, the Monkey King, is called Alakazam, and Pigsy, the shape-shifting pig, is dubbed Sir Quigley Brokenbottom. The new songs have little to do with the original story and tend to slow things down considerably.
Still, it's a beautifully animated piece with rich color and at least a semblance of the original legend. Most importantly for today's young audiences, it depicts the cultural antecedents of the popular ""Dragon Ball"" cartoon TV series, which is shown on the Cartoon Network and available on home video. Identical points of reference include the flying nimbus cloud and power pole employed by Alakazam/Goku, the same tools possessed by the hero of ""Dragon Ball,"" also named Goku. Oolong, the cowardly, lecherous pig seen in ""Dragon Ball,"" is clearly modeled on Pigsy/Sir Quigley, who also has the power to transform and an eye for the ladies. Also significant is the fact that pioneering animator Osamu Tezuka was a co-writer/co-director of this film (three years before ""Astro Boy""), which was adapted from his own manga (comic book) version of the legend. There were many other films and TV series based on ""Journey to the West,"" both animated and live-action, made in China, Hong Kong and Japan, but few are easily available in the U.S.",1026604800,38,2128,5.1531791907514455

732790,5,6303935877,"As a lad of 8 years in the summer of 1969 back when the Bronx of New York was still comprised of candy shops with Soda Jerks, comic book stands, and Mr. Softee ice cream trucks, I soon found a growing delight for a medium that seemed to be foreign to kids only a few short years before...Japanese Anime.
After a healthy dose of ""Kimba the Whit Lion"" and ""Astro Boy"", I was flipping what few channels that were available and happened upon an anime movie (in the middle) and recognized the voice of the animated pig as Jonathon Winters.  I was immediately drawn in and soon entranced with wonderful story of the small monkey's quest as well as delighted by the stunning animation, even if it was on a black and white Philco.
Oddly enough, 12 years later while visiting my mother who had still resided in the Bronx after my move to another state, ""Alakazam the Great"" was schedule to show on the exact same channel.  Not only seeing it again brought back some of my fondest memories, but to finally see the entire movie, in color, turned my delight into pure amazement especially for the wonderful effects and vivid colors...the magic was still there!
Now with the inventions of HDTV's and digital projectors, I've downloaded this priceless gem and have shown it (on a large scale) to my teenage kids who refuse to even go to the bathroom unless the movie was paused so not to miss a moment.  Sure, I may be nostalgic for me, but this movie is a beautiful and magical piece of art the entire family will find endearing.",1257724800,4,1516,4.4855072463768115

This movie is ageless and a wonderful example for children. I could only wish that the original would be released without the reediting that was done to make it more ""acceptable"" for western audiences.

Our youths need more films like Alakazam.

This is a animation of one of the most well-known stories in Asia is ""Journey to the West"" by Ch'eng En Wu, excellently translated by Arthur Waley.  The fictional story revolves around three characters: a monk, who is full of reason and compassion; a mischievous monkey, who has an almost human physique, an uncanny ability to discern good from evil, and who could converse with humans; and Piggy, who is loud, boisterous, greedy, and has an enormous appetite.  By the Chinese Emperor's decree, the monk had undertaken a twenty-year journey to India, to bring back Buddha's scriptures.  Along the way, the monk's compassion, coupled with his naivet of the depravity of man, often placed him in danger.  To protect the monk, Kuan Yin, the Goddess of Mercy, arranged for the monkey to protect him, and for Piggy to carry his load.
 Now, the monkey was a real rogue!  Buddha himself had imprisoned him in rock so tightly that he could only move one arm.  He had vast magical powers, which he had used to cause great havoc in heaven and which, of course, resulted in his imprisonment of 500 years.  Freed from his confinement, the monkey received instruction from the monk, and also served as a teacher to the monk.  Along the way, despite many setbacks, the monkey learned that great power must be exercised with great humility.

  Journey to the West is available on Amazon.com.  I would recommend Out of Chaos, China 2026 CE where the Monkey King makes a modern appearance.

  All of the above are HIGHLY recommended.",1220832000,19,1964,4.7976190476190474

Although originally intended for the younger audience, the story of the monkey king's search for humility, mercy and wisdom is somewhat profound.  Regardless, the endearing characters and animation will appeal to both children and adults.  It's interesting to note that some scenes were deleted from the American version.  The voices and soundtrack are also quite different from the original.  This is the version that I recall from my childhood and it never disappoints.
