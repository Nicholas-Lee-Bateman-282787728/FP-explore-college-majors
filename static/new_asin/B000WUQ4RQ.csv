8225770,5,B000WUQ4RQ,"This is one of the greatest literary documentaries I've seen, on one of my favorite novels of all time. Anyone here out of curiosity on Under the Volcano or Lowry would be better off searching it and finding it online. Burton is great as always, and if you also happen to like Huston, check out the Criterion Collection edition of the film, which includes this doc on disc two. I found it blows the film out of the water, something understood upon readind the novel, which I immediately went out to buy and devoured after watching the documentary.",1376438400,2,547,4.591836734693878
