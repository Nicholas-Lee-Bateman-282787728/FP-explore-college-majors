8043609,1,B0006VCF0G,"This DVD is a perfect example of misleading advertising.  The title and box art have nothing to do with this amateur film.  There's nothing new here and the acting is horrendous.  It was probably a made-for-TV bomb...then again...that's being too nice.  This one is a stink bomb.  Nothing scary...no gore...definitely nothing evil, except the deceptive promoters that mislead me into buying this.  1 Star is being generous...LIGHTS OUT!",1269475200,,436,5.338235294117647
