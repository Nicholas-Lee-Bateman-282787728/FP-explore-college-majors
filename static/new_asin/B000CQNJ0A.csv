2469110,5,B000CQNJ0A,"My son received this as a gift when he was about 14 months old and still watches now at 30 months.  We've all memorized the songs and story and it's still enjoyable.  My son even sings the songs on his own which is a treat.  Not much more to add than the other reviewers have written, they've touched on all of it and they are better writers than I am.",1248912000,2,352,4.0
2469111,5,B000CQNJ0A,"Nonbusy production style, likable characters, and good songs (that my son can sing along to) tied in with ample train footage. It's also informative.

What more could you want?",1239235200,2,176,5.068965517241379
2469112,5,B000CQNJ0A,"My two preschoolers, who both love Thomas the Train, fell instantly in love with this video! The concept is clear and simple, the music catchy, and the combination of real toys/puppets and actual trains imaginative. I gave it a shot based on other ratings on Amazon...glad I did!",1214179200,5,279,4.833333333333333
2469113,5,B000CQNJ0A,"My friend bought this for my son's 2nd birthday because he boys like it so much.  They check it out from the library constantly.  I had no idea what to expect, but it's great.  My 2 year old LOVES it, and his 4 1/2 year old sister tolerates it.  The music is great, even for parents.  I wish there were more 'choo choo pig' (what my son calls it) movies!",1187654400,5,354,4.0
2469114,5,B000CQNJ0A,"If your child is addicted to Thomas the Tank Engine, Busy Little Engine is a good alternative.  We found this video at our local library.  My son took it out so much, no other kid could ever see it.",1175126400,4,198,4.051282051282051
2469115,5,B000CQNJ0A,My son is 4 and loves trains. He lives and breathes trains. This movie is simple and interesting and he loves it. We rented it from the library and have to buy it. I highly recommend this one.,1169510400,5,192,4.078947368421052
2469116,5,B000CQNJ0A,"I received a free copy of this from the creator at a holiday party and, quite frankly, didn't know what to expect.  As soon as we got home from the party, we popped in the DVD - let's just say we had a tough time getting our 3 year old away from it after that.  He was immediately engaged by the very catchy songs, the wonderfully voiced narration and sound effects, the Pig and, of course, Biz!  It's just wonderfully simple, with the perfect mixture of music, characters and information.  Highly recommended!",1166486400,4,510,4.510869565217392
2469117,5,B000CQNJ0A,"As a mom of a toddler and a preschooler, who are obsessed with trains, I highly recommend this video. The Busy Little Engine is more than just a story told with trains, it provides kids the opportunity to learn about what trains actually do. The story is entertaining, the music is lively and both kids find it enjoyable. Plus, Pig is just so darn cute!",1147219200,5,353,4.446153846153846
2469118,5,B000CQNJ0A,"The Busy Little Engine is a great DVD for kids. With wooden trains, real trains, a puppet pig, and some terrific music, my two year old gives it two thumbs up. The gentle pacing and straightforward editing help to make it an appropriate for kids as young as two. But the thoughtful story keeps it interesting for kids up to 6 or 7. The music, however, is the real standout. Mom and Dad don't mind the songs (I've even caught myself humming them on my own...) even after a zillion viewings. Clearly this one was made by a parent so you won't go wrong with this DVD.

2469149,5,B000CQNJ0A,"We have had this DVD for about 4 years for my train-loving 2 year old twins. It has been well loved. Busy and Pig make a great, comical, and informative team. The music is great! My next son was obsessed with Busy for weeks... maybe months. If you have any little ones that love trains...this is a must buy! My now 6 year old twins still love it.",1455753600,2,346,4.102941176470588
2469150,5,B000CQNJ0A,My 4 yr old loves all things trains and this is no exception. He has watched this video 100's of times and he still loves it!,1455667200,2,125,3.8461538461538463
2469151,1,B000CQNJ0A,"There are much better viewing options included with Prime membership. This is quite obviously a homemade video, or if it is studio produced it's done on a less than minimal budget. It's more or less a commercial for the wooden train sets that our son already has. You're essentially watching a series of still images and handi-cam video footage with puppets and toy trains green screened in, and the audio quality is a shade better than 8-bit quality. If I had been able to preview it, we would have watched Thomas and Friends instead.

Now, to be fully clear, the quality of the production isn't the most important aspect. My son loves Hard Hat Harry, and I kind of enjoy it too, because the characters are engaging and the videos are informative. It's a little campy, but fun. This is campy and not much fun. There is basically no plot to follow, nor is it especially exciting or informative. The narration is bland as well, leaving us staring at the screen longing for some emotion or change in tone to liven things up.

We did Amazon rental, and that was $2 wasted.",1454630400,,1069,4.5625
2469152,5,B000CQNJ0A,My 3 year old son has honestly watched this 50 times.  Parents....Give the movie a chance.  My son loves it!!!,1452124800,,110,4.45
2469153,5,B000CQNJ0A,My grandson loves this movie.  Has watched a lot.,1451088000,,49,4.444444444444445
2469154,5,B000CQNJ0A,"I may never get this... I may never understand why a pig and a train with no windows.. a play train was an obsession of my sons for so long.

I will try though.. I suppose I should start with something my son loves.. trains. He does love trains and anything related to trains.  With that being said, it is no mystery that he has grown to love pigs now as well. Not only pigs that you'd find on a farm, but also pigs that can talk and give you information about trains, logistics, manufacturing, directions, etc....

The voiceovers for this film are horrendous but that does not deter my 2.5 year old from enjoying this. As an FYI, my 2.5 year old has been watching this for about a year now. The film is simple, education and a bit annoying but then again what children's movie is not a little annoying (that is movies produced for kids less than 3 years old).

This is the type of movie that a college kid would make in a film class using his kid brother's toys on the weekend using his panasonic camcorder and some tricks in a video editing software program. The producer/editing chief on this film actually somehow figures out how to replace a real train with a toy train which is in a real world setting. Imagine that, watching a movie in which you know well and right that a real passenger train should go by but instead a little wooden train... goes back and forth back and forth.. back an forth.. and your like, with your mouth handing open, ""wow""

This is probably not as good as the Matrix, when it came out, but maybe a film that one day people will look at in a similar way..",1447200000,4,1586,4.273333333333333
2469155,3,B000CQNJ0A,"My son, 2, enjoyed this a lot. We watched it several times. As one might expect, the graphics are not so great, so it was hard for mommy to watch. The little guy loves it though!",1445558400,,178,3.9722222222222223

2469175,5,B000CQNJ0A,"Bypass those too fast, too stimulating, too hyper (and too hyped) shows and give your child this charming alternative.  Gently paced and ultra-engaging, ""The Busy Little Engine"" is jusssssst right.  Dinkytown really comes to life with Biz, Pig, and friends.  This is quality screen time with solid staying power.

2469190,5,B000CQNJ0A,"Our almost five year old son loves this video!  Because we do not have television, he does not expect his shows to be loud, fast, action-packed, and constantly interrupted by commercials.  The pace of this film is slow, and that is awesome.  Our son laughs at the pig's little antics, is enthralled with the train footage, and sings along with the sweet trio of songs.  When we have movie time as a family on Saturday morning, we watch shows like Mister Rogers or old Thomas the Train episodes, keeping the pace calm and the content meaningful.  This film quickly joined our set of viewing options.  Other movies he enjoys are Milo and Otis, child-focused train and air show videos, and of course the Disneyland Sing-a-long movie.  The Busy Little Engine is a thoughtful, peaceful, and kind film.",1385683200,4,796,4.766423357664234
