2677795,5,B000JMK6N0,"i had the same problem as the others with the dvd going bad during episode 25 part B and continuing throught the end credits and the preview.  i contacted amazon.com and they sent me out a brand new copy that appears to work great.  i watched all episodes last night and did not have any kind of problem.  incidentally, both copies that were sent to me were the special edition that came with the t-shirt, so the disc problems are not isolated to the non-special edition discs.

too bad this disc is giving people problems because in terms of story, i thought it was exceptional.  the fist episode consists of a huge mobile suit battle that quickly devolves into a confusing, frantic battle that leaves most of the principle characters on both sides pretty confused.

here's where it gets good.  instead of having these characters try to kill each other without fully understanding the situations they are a part of, characters from both sides of the conflict actually get together and talk.  both perspectives are made clear to both sides, and the characters then go on with the story being able to make more informed decisions instead of running around killing people and not really understanding what is going on.  this episode was very well done.

i don't want to say much more, because part of enjoying this series is not knowing exactly what is coming.

i'll just say that as i was reading reviews of this show when it was being aired in japan, the reviews were initially positive and then became very negative to the point where i almost considered not purchasing the dvds when they came out here.  but i have, and up to this point, i'm really enjoying this series.  it's a bit darker in tone than seed, which i like, and the lines between good and evil are more obscured, which i also like.

so far seed destiny has exceeded my expectations (especially given all the negativity when it was airing in japan).  these dvds can't come out fast enough for me.  why isn't bandai releasing these discs two at a time like they did with most of seed and the last half of wing?",1170892800,3,2075,4.5675675675675675
2677796,5,B000JMK6N0,i was lucky some people said this dvd stops but i tok a risk and bought it at best buy and it works great awsome dvd,1170720000,,116,3.5
2677797,1,B000JMK6N0,"I second the last post.

I just received my second copy of Gundam Seed Destiny v 6 and I experienced the exact same problems as what was described in the previous post for both copies.  I tested it on 3 different DVD players and there doesn't appear to be anything wrong with the disc's surface.  Without going into detail, the end of episode 25 (possibly the most important couple of minutes in the disc in terms of story) is impossible to watch on most DVD players (that I've seen).  Somebody at Bandai Entertainment's validation department must have been sleeping on the job or something because I can't see how you could miss such a glaring error.  I encourage every fan and distributor of Gundam Seed Destiny out there to send Bandai a complaint, especially if you already bought this product. [...]. As paying customers we have a right to a DVD that works when we pay for one.  It's bad enough that they're releasing these things at a snail's pace; they could at least give us this courtosy of a working product.

What makes this particularly disappointing is that this was a very good disc in terms of the content of the episodes.  I won't spoil the story for you if you haven't seen it yet but there is a decent battle, some more character development and explanations and what might be a few surprises.

I'm still upset about the fact that this product doesn't work properly but if it did work, I couldn't see myself having given it a rating of less then 4 stars.",1169856000,5,1472,4.503759398496241
2677798,1,B000JMK6N0,"I have so far had two copies of this DVD.  Both from a big blue and yellow box store and probably from the same shipment.  Both copies have so far had problems playing back beginning from episode 25 part B.  It didn't matter what audio track or subtitle, though the english audio track tended to play slightly better.  Still not very good though as the movie would freeze, and the dvd players i've tried it in would struggle to get going again.  if you play this DVD straight through, around the 1 hour 6 minute mark is where I began to experience problems.  The problems would continue until the end of this episode.  Including the closing preview.  (chapters 16-18)  All of the other chapters, menus, and audio tracks played just fine.

just to make sure I wasn't crazy, I tried to play it in software DVD players on two different computers.  I also attempted to save it to my harddrive.  none worked, and i would receive read errors in VTS 4 4 vob.  frustrating.

InterVideo WinDVD 5 - media read error and quits playing around 1:07
Windows Media Player 11 with DScaler5 - crashes windows media player hard around 1:06.
Nero 6 showtime 2 - unable to read part of a file on the DVD disc.  Playback may be affected.  - around 1:06
DVD Decryptor - fails after about 60 retrys and about 475MB's ripped from VTS 4 4 VOB.

JVC combo tv MW20F51 - stuttered and stopped after 1:07:45

UPDATE:  apparently there are some bad copies floating around, which is much better than all of them being bad.",1169683200,8,1594,4.494773519163763

8152288,2,B000JMK6N0,I just recently got the whole Gundam Seed and Destiny off of E Bay. All of the DVD's play fine so far except for Destiny Volume 6. I haven't checked the rest of the DVD's yet. At first I thought it was just one bad DVD and that I can buy another copy of volume 6. But I just read the reviews and found out about Bandai putting out a bad batch of DVD's. Great well that's just peachy. So if I buy another copy I risk getting another bad DVD. Since now I can't return the one that I have to Bandai since they shut down their Television department. And are only making toys now. So now there's nothing I can do! This is very upsetting news :( Aside from this problem the other episodes play fine.,1390694400,,693,4.028985507246377
8152289,5,B000JMK6N0,"Gundam seed is one of the more modernized Gundam entries. The 2 previous shows, Gundam wing and 08th MS Team were pretty good. Gundam Wing had okay animation, but the voice cast was bad on the english dub. 08th MS Team has ok voice acting, but the animation was kind rough. Gundam Seed has neither of these problems. It has really good animation and pretty good voice acting. The soundtrack is also really well done. The story is also more interesting. There are some major plot twists and some great conflicts between the characters. It definitely deserves the 2 seasons that it ran. With lots of great characters, a pretty in depth plot and high quality production it's definitely my favorite Gundam since the original. You should give it a chance. I hope you like it as much as I do.",1355356800,,786,4.581560283687943
8152290,3,B000JMK6N0,I'm a big GS and GSD fan. I bought this volume since the one that came in the box set had a few 'defective' episodes that would just not play and would freeze the DVD player. I thought that buying the volume separetely woulf fix this and it did and it didn't; intead of having 3 messed up episodes it only has 1 messed up episode. I guess it's an improvement but it would defenitively be better if it had NO messed up episodes. I'm starting to beleive that all of them came defective...,1306022400,,486,4.180851063829787
8152291,3,B000JMK6N0,"The shows by themselves were very good, I had no problem with them.  However, at some point 3/4 of the way through the disc, it kept skipping and stalling.  I attempted to fix this by cleaning the disk and attaching a d-skin cover to it, but it still kept skipping.  I certainly hope that others haven't had the same problem as it detracts from the experience negatively.",1173312000,,371,4.507462686567164
