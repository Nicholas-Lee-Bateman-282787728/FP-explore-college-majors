756067,4,6304016468,"This is a ""must-have"" for any fan of the genre.  This film is marked by wonderful cinematography, colorful characters, and a witty script by Borden Chase (""Red River"").  Stewart once again portrays a character who is basically a hard-bitten loner with a soft spot only for his side-kick, Walter Brennan.  The film has a great supporting cast, including Brennan, Jay C. Flippen, John McIntyre, Harry Morgan, Royal Dano and Jack Elam.  Alaska has never looked better than in this Technicolor delight. One minor comment about the tape's packaging: it indicates that this is the first time the film has been made available on video.

756175,5,6304016468,"This is a good story that is well acted. It is 1896, a cowboy who is a loner, who cares only for himself, who is uninterested in other people, for who needs them, ""I can take care of myself,"" who killed two men who tried to steal his cattle (James Stewart), take cattle with his two pals to northern Canada, but on the way, a corrupt thieving sheriff takes the cattle from them. After the cattle is taken, they sign on with a woman to take food north where the price for food is many times what it is in the US. He sneaks back and takes the cattle from the sheriff who swears he will kill him. When he and his pals get to their destination and buy a gold mine, they discover that men who had gold mines and who left the area with much money are killed on their way out of Canada with their money.",1462147200,,796,4.012578616352202

This Stewart character is far different one than you usually see, not at all what you normally think of when you hear the name ""James Stewart"".  Here, he is a far harder, much more cynical, 'bitterer' (I think that is a word) man than you generally see him protray. He and his partner, (Walter Brennan) move a small herd of cattle from Seattle to Skagway, Ak, then into the interior to Dawson in the Yukon and the gold strike going on there.  It isn't quite that simple of course, and that is the movie... not one but two female 'love interests' compete for Stewart and John Ireland makes an excellent villian...",1446076800,,758,4.5588235294117645

756291,4,6304016468,"Plot: Plain-talking, sharp-shooting frontiersman Jeff Webster/James Stewart will do anything to turn an honest dollar. Here he and loyal sidekick Ben Tatum/Walter Brennan are driving a herd of cattle from the plains to the Alaska gold fields when they lose the herd enroute to crooked Skagway mayor/chief justice Gannon/John McEntire, a certified slimeball. Broke and with no other prospects, Jeff and Ben regroup by contracting to lead local lady Ronda Castle/Ruth Roman and her party up to Dawson near the fields, where she's looking to start a new business. Gannon and his crew of hardcases, attracted by the prospect of robbing the peaceable gold prospectors, wind up in the same vicinity. Most of the anticipated sparks fly, firearms- and romance-wise.

Assessment: Plot's kind of pedestrian, and they're aren't any gold nuggests in the dialog either. But the mountainous scenery is invigorating, the evocation of an almost totally primitive Dawson City an attention-getter, and Gannon's evil lieutenants Newberry and Madden (Jack Elam and Robert Wilke respectively) are unsettling. It's amazing how much farther a movie can go with a few nasties who look the part. Most of the rest of the cast appears convincingly scruffy. Did Walter Brennan really have no teeth, or can you be made up to look that way?

Director Anthony Mann's name isn't as well known as that of fellow western film masters John Ford, Howard Hawks, or Sergio Leone, but even this one ranking well down in their collective body of work is a highly respectable effort.",1435276800,,1542,5.139442231075697

756294,5,6304016468,"1954's THE FAR COUNTRY is probably my favorite James Stewart Western. There's something about the story that I really like. James Stewart and his sidekick Walter Brennan decide to drive a herd of cattle to Dawson City in the Yukon during the Klondike gold rush. However, on the way they run up against John McIntire, a self-appointed judge and he takes the herd of cattle away from them and he has the henchmen to back that up. What I like about this movie is the setting, some of the film was shot in Athabasca Glacier and Jasper National Park in Canada, and John McIntire's performance. This is one of those movies where you really want to see the bad guy get his comeuppance. Stewart and Brennan steal back their cattle and cross over into Canada. McIntire will be waiting for them when they return. ""Have a nice trip! I'll hang you when you come back!"" THE FAR COUNTRY was directed by Anthony Mann with beautiful and effective cinematography by William H. Daniels. The great cast also includes Ruth Roman, Jay C.

756407,5,6304016468,"For a full description of the plot, etc., read other reviews.  Just some quick thoughts on this Jimmy Stewart western...

The Far Country (1954) is a very good western that stars Jimmy Stewart, Ruth Roman, Corinne Calvet, Walter Brennan, and John McIntire.  This movie was directed by Anthony Mann.  The acting is good, the musical score is good, and the scenery is breathtaking.  This movie has some of the best scenery of any western I've ever seen.  Both Ruth Roman and John McIntire shine in this movie.  Very good acting.  If you're an Alfred Hitchcock fan, you might know Roman from Strangers On A Train (1951) and McIntire from Psycho (1960).  And of course, Jimmy Stewart from Rope (1948), Rear Window (1954), The Man Who Knew Too Much (1956), and Vertigo (1958).

Overall, this is one of the better Jimmy Stewart westerns, in my opinion.  I highly recommend it.",1404345600,2,870,4.771812080536913

756510,4,6304016468,"THE FAR COUNTRY is a Gold Rush adventure directed by Anthony Mann and filmed in Alberta, Canada.

Here, Jimmy Stewart is Jeff Webster, a cattleman who, along with his partner Ben Tatum (Brennan), brings a herd to Dawson then uses the money he gets for it to stake a claim in the gold fields.

Soon after their camp is organized, crooked politician Mr. Gannon (McIntire) arrives with a gang of thugs and they begin forcing miners to quit their claims. This ends in a showdown between Gannon and Jeff, who in a subplot is the hypotenuse of a love triangle with Ronda Castle (Roman) and Renee Vallon (Calvet).

Highlights are gorgeous Technicolor scenery, lots of action, and a score partly-written by Henry Mancini.

756512,2,6304016468,"Not one of James Stewart's better movies. In fact, it is just a very ordinary sort of western, if you make allowances for the fact that it takes place in the Yukon, and the ""ordinary"" western is in American territories. The difference is not a significant one.

Stewart is the only real star in it, although you will recognize Walter Brennan and Henry Morgan, who has a minor role. Brennan is Stewart's partner in a herd of cattle first, and then in a mining claim, and Stewart is supposedly one of these hard-bitten types who doesn't care about anyone. But he cares about his partner, and two women care about him. And of course, he learns to care about others.

Too much is cliche, too predictable, and frankly, I was disappointed. But James Stewart is one of my favorite actors, so I'll give it two stars.",1337385600,,808,4.527397260273973

756514,3,6304016468,"This western is atypical in a number of ways. For one, it shows a spectacular, but deadly, mountain landslide. It also features women to a greater extent than many westerns. Instead of one big-shot hero, it features a series of good guys (the ones wanting to build a civilized town complete with a courthouse, a school, and a church) going after bad-guy Gannon, who wants all the prospects for himself. Instead of being filled with bravado, the good guys have to overcome their fear of getting hurt, and to work out a realistic strategy of dealing with bad-guy Gannon, who is mocking them. For a time, the good guys are totally intimidated, and on the verge of giving up.

The plot of the early part of this film could be clearer. Also, a number of statements could be used less often (""I am going to hang you."") so as not to lose their effect.",1327104000,,844,4.48051948051948

I did like the story: a crooked judge and his motley ""law-upholders"" take horses and try to take full control of the small town of Dawson, Yukon. In all the tragedy that takes place, the bitter Jeff Webster (James Stewart) is concerned about no one but himself. The turning point comes about when his sidekick Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) is killed by the judge's henchmen. Is it then that Webster's attitude takes a polar change: he vows to avenge the people responsible for Tatum's life being ended. Again, the snow and mountains of northwest Canada are a ""drawing card"" for this movie, and it makes a person believe that it is worth the time and effort to take a trip to this far country.

756614,5,6304016468,"The penultimate collaboration between director Anthony Mann and star James Stewart (excluding the few days Mann worked on Night Passage before parting company with the star under less than amicable circumstances), The Far Country belies its mainstream look to offer another portrait of an embittered man dragged unwillingly to his own redemption, fighting it every step of the way. This time he's a cattle driver whose response to labour problems - challenging troublesome cowhands to a gunfight at the end of the trail - results in his cattle being confiscated by John McIntire's larcenous judge of the Roy Bean school of law and order. Stealing them back and taking them across the Canadian border, he soon finds himself unwillingly drawn into the growing conflict between prospectors and the judge as he cheats or kills them out of their claims...

While it's no great surprise which way Stewart turns at the end, he's a surprisingly callous critter along the way, even using his desire to just be left alone to excuse not warning a group of prospectors of an impending avalanche when he has the chance because it's not his problem. For most of the film there's really only a hair's breadth between him and McIntire, something the judge recognises immediately, revelling in the company of a kindred spirit even as he's genially planning to lynch him. In many ways the townspeople who put their faith in him probably recognise it too - despite their appeals to his dead-and-buried better nature, there's an unspoken acknowledgement that the only person who can stand up to the judge is someone almost as bad as he is.

As usual with Mann there's an exceptional use of high country locations, though for once the final showdown takes place on level ground, and the film is almost perfectly cast with strong support from Walter Brennan, Harry Morgan and Ruth Roman (though Corinne Calvert's young romantic interest veers to the irritating). Sadly the great cinematography of the Canadian Rockies is done few favours by a distinctly average DVD transfer, with only the theatrical trailer as an extra.",1241654400,,2099,4.994285714285715

756698,4,6304016468,"This is mostly a story about the growing relationship between  cowboy Jeff Webster(Jimmy Stewart) and femme fatale Ronda Castle(Ruth Roman). She takes an instant liking to Jeff with just a brief encounter on the deck of the steamer to Skagway, and a longer look when he hides in her cabin while authorities look for him, charged with murder. They find out they have some important things in common, besides an animal attraction.  Namely, neither dares to trust a member of the opposite sex, having apparently married to spouses who cheated on them.  Gradually, they learn to trust each other, as they journey from Skagway to Dawson. But Ronda clearly has close dealings with corrupt Sheriff  Gannon and engages in some shady practices in her Castle saloon in Skagway. She eventually is forced to decide between Gannon and Jeff. Meanwhile, a young naive French woman, Renee, also takes an immediate liking to Jeff, but only gets insulting brush offs in return. Clearly too young for him, he thinks. Yet, she sticks with him in his travels from Skagway to Dawson and his activities around Dawson. Along with Ronda, she nurses him back to health after he is  left for dead by Gannon's gunslingers at his gold claim. Walter Brennan, as Ben, serves as Jeff's long time sidekick. He doesn't have a meaty role, but  he does serve to soften Jeff's hard edges. His demise symbolically opens the door for a woman companion replacement for Jeff.
  John McIntire, as sheriff Gannon, makes probably the most charismatic evil town boss you will ever see on film, oozing charm and humor to go along with his bullying. He makes a believable incarnation of the infamous Soapy Smith, who spent his last years in Skagway, as one of the premier con men of his era. Evidently, Gannon sees something of himself in Jeff, repeatedly declaring that he's going to like him(and kill him).
  Jeff is the quintessential antihero, a loner(except for companion Ben) who doesn't want to stick his neck out for others, even when he knows he is the one right man for the job. In this respect, he closely resembles Burt Lancaster's character in ""Vera Cruz"", for example. Thus, Jeff not only turns down the job of marshall of Dawson, he is about to leave the Yukon after Gannon's gang moves in with clear intentions of taking over everyone's insufficiently legal mining claims, while disposing of some of the miners and suggesting that the rest make a hurried exit from the Yukon while they are still alive. Even Ronda suggests that she and Jeff best leave together quickly. Then, Jeff has a sudden change of heart, apparently still nursing a desire for revenge for the shooting of Ben and himself. He changes from antihero to hero in leading the expulsion of Gannon's gang from Dawson. In this respect, he differ's from Lancaster's character, who never reforms. But, is Jeff truly changed or just carrying out revenge for wrongs committed against his own interests, which happen to benefit the whole town? We'll never know.
  The main problem I see with the plot is the 2 principle women. Clearly, Ronda is groomed as the right woman to tame Jeff. Although she is clearly characterized as a ""bad"" girl, Jeff has a checkered past himself, having shot at least 5 men within the past few months, and having stolen back his cattle from Gannon. Ironically, soon after Jeff transforms from an antihero into a hero, Ronda makes a similar change in running into the dark street to warn Jeff of Gannon's impending ambush. She dies as a result, and Jeff asks why she didn't just look out for herself(his supposedly just adandoned creed!).
  It's clear that Corinne Calvet, as Renee, just doesn't make a credible substitute for the dead Ronda, in Jeff's mind. Yet, the clear suggestion of the parting scene is that they get together, even though they never visibly exchange a kiss or hug, just a hand on hand as a start. Her image as a ""good"" girl is somewhat compromised by her job in Ronda's saloon of bumping miners weighing their gold dust and pushing the spilled dust on the floor, which she later recovers. Also, I'm very unclear about her relationship with Rube Morris(Jay Flippen), a middle-aged miner, who follows her around and later works a claim with her.(He's not her father).
  Another flaw is the amateurish handling of the terminal gunfight  between Jeff and Gannon's gang. If Gannon had any skill at all with a pistol, he  should have  killed or seriously wounded Jeff under that boardwalk before Jeff did the same to him.  And how did Jeff's badly shot up right hand suddenly become well enough to shoot a pistol with apparent ease? I also wonder what Jeff and friends did to help the victims of the avalanche. They were too far away to get there in time to pull them out alive from under the snow, even if they knew where they were! And why weren't most of Ronda's pack horses or mules also buried by the avalanche?
  You will see a host of probably nameless but familiar faces among the miners around Dawson and among Gannon's gang. The sequences shot in the Canadian Rockies provide a breathtaking backdrop to the action. All-in- all, a very entertaining western, with most of the major flaws concentrated at the end.  No doubt, great liberties with history and geography were taken, especially the parts taking place in the Canadian Yukon which was, in fact, much tamer than the US Skagway. No Jeff would have been required to quickly rid the Yukon of any Gannon-like badmen.",1210636800,3,5451,4.757158006362673

Unlike Ford who almost exclusively returned time after time to Monument valley, Mann picked wonderful new locations for each of his Westerns, this time being the awesome landscape of Jasper National Park in the Canadian Rocky Mountains.

The story (as with previous outings) is from a Borden Chase script and has tough cattleman Jeff Webster (James Stewart) and his sidekick Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) meeting up in 1896 Seattle, hearing of the gold rush Jeff decides to take his cattle to Dawson City en-route he falls foul of no-good Skagway judge, sheriff Gannon (John McItire). Webster finds himself jailed. Gannon releases him but confiscates Jeff's cattle. Jeff agrees to lead a party of eager prospectors up to Dawson with eager support from saloon owner Rhonda Castle (Ruth Roman) and young French Canadian girl Renee Vallon (Connie Calvet) as they near the Canadian border Jeff and Ben slip back one night and steal the cattle back, returning to the border with Gannon and his cronies in hot pursuit, Jeff manages to delay the pursuers long enough to allow everyone to cross the border into Canada.

Delivering the cattle to Dawson and selling them to Rhonda Castle following an auction. Rhonda sets up a saloon along with new arrival Gannon. Meanwhile Jeff and Ben set off to do a little gold mining of their own. Trouble brews as Gannon and his motley band cheat the miners one by one from their claims. The miners and good town folk try to elect Jeff as marshal, but he refuses so local man Rube Morris (J C Flippen) is elected. After a killing in Rhonda's saloon Rude is left facing one of Gannon's hired guns, Jeff suggesting that he backs down to save his life. Rube loses face and resigns, and then follows more claim jumping until only a few are left. Jeff and Ben receive their visit in due course and are ambushed when leaving camp, both are badly shot up and left for dead, Jeff somehow drags himself out of the river recovers Ben's body and heads for town. Renee takes Jeff in and tends his wounds as he vows to get those responsible. After a partial recovery Jeff sets out for the final showdown with Gannon and his men holed up in the saloon.

756705,3,6304016468,"In ""The Far Country"", James Stewart and Anthony Mann are off on yet another popular Western storyline, their 4th together...

The traditional plot, situation, and dialog are compensated somewhat by the wonderful scenery of the Canadian Northwest, evocatively captured by Mann's camera...

Stewart's familiar supporting cast (Jay C. Flippen and Harry Morgan) made their presence with Walter Brennan, the most decorated character actor in American Movies with 3 Academy Awards for Best Supporting Actor to his name... Brennan contributes his usual well known portrayal as an eccentric old companion of good spirit and intentions...

Stewart is a Wyoming cattleman who wants to make enough money to buy a ranch, so he drives his herd clear to Alaska and on to Dawson, in Canadian territory, where he sells them...

Along the trail he meets the baddie who runs the town behind a corrupt sheriff John McIntire... They try to steal him his cattle... Later, in Dawson, McIntire and his gang reappear, this time interfering with Stewart's gold claim...

In the film, Stewart has two leading ladies to contend with: Ruth Roman, a bit too precious to qualify convincingly as a tough sweet gale weathering the worst vicissitudes of the territory and the more gentle, the French Canadian girl Corinne Calvet who does create a nice portrait of a decent girl with good instincts... In conventional fashion, Stewart is torn between the flamboyant lady-gambler and the wife-candidate...

Anthony Mann's heroes are often thoughtful men forced into hysterical violence by their need to avenge a wrong or shameful past... They are neurotic and cynical - which is hardly surprising giving the amount of rough handling they have to suffer... In ""The Man From Laramie"" Stewart is dragged through a fire and has his hand shot through; in ""The Far Country"" he is shot up and thrown into a river...

Mann's villains are among the most corrupt, unbalanced and memorable to be found in any Western before or since, with Alex Nicol in ""The Man From Laramie""; Robert Ryan in ""The Naked Spur""; Dan Duryea in ""Winchester'73"" and the depraved, grandiosely evil Doc Tobin of Lee J. Cobb in ""Man of the West"" taking the highest honors...

756706,5,6304016468,"The Far Country was one of the great collaborations between actor James Stewart and great director Anthony Mann. As all of their films did, The Far Country features great performances, a keen literate script, and wonderful direction.

Stewart plays a cowboy assisted by eternal codger Walter Brennan in driving cattle to Alaska. As always in the Stewart/Mann films, Stewart's character is a loner with a past, and he turns his back on what happens in the Alaskan town he settles in, which is ruled with iron-fistedness by John McIntire. McIntire cheats, kills, and run roughshod over everyone, but Stewart does nothing to stop him until tragedy ensues.

The Far Country is a great Northern Western, full of action and fury, but it is made complete by a wonderful partnership that made some of the best films of the 50's. And The Far Country was one of those films.",1162080000,6,864,4.831081081081081
756707,5,6304016468,"This review is for the 2003 Universal DVD.

The movie begins in Seattle in the spring of 1896 where Jeff Webster  (James Stewart) leads a herd of cattle that are to be loaded on a paddleboat headed to Skagway, Alaska.  At the dock, Webster meets up with his longtime sidekick Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan).  Shortly afterward, it's revealed that while driving the cattle from Wyoming, Webster shot two of his cowhands for allegedly trying to rustle his cows.  But due to conflicting accounts, he's a wanted man by the law and eludes the authorities while boarding the boat with the help of Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) and arrives in Skagway with his cattle.  While herding the cattle through the streets of Skagway, a small stampede ensues and interferes with a public hanging.  Webster is arrested by a corrupt judge named Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) and loses all of his valuable cattle as restitution for the minor damage and short interruption.  This sets up the rest of the movie where Webster and Tatum have no choice but to look for gold in the lawless Yukon where greed, corruption, brutality and even fatal hostility run amuck.

The one thing that sets this film apart from other westerns is the absolutely beautiful location shots in and around the Canadian Rockies.  The color cinematography is gorgeous although it's surprising and somewhat perplexing that Universal chose to present this film in a fullscreen format instead of widescreen.  Jimmy Stewart plays one of the more complex and sometimes disturbing heroes as he at times chooses his own self-interests over moral decency.  I also enjoyed Walter Brennen who gives a stellar performance as the venerable sidekick.  Besides John McIntire, there are also many other recognizable Hollywood veterans in this film including Jack Elam, Harry Morgan and Steve Brodie.  I can't say this is the greatest western ever, but its easily ranks within my Top 5.

The fullscreen technicolor presentation is very nice.  It's not quite restored to perfection, but it comes close and sometimes the colors fade in and out.  There aren't any bonuses except a trailer, which is a shame since the location shooting must have been an amazing adventure in itself.

756814,5,6304016468,"In the 1950s, Jimmy Stewart began his second career.  In the 1930s and 1940s he had established himself as one of Hollywood's most likeable leading men, and had starred in a string of great comedies, many of them classics.  After serving as a bomber pilot in Europe (one of the few Hollywood stars to do a full tour of duty in the field of battle), Stewart returned, but was not as a rule able to reduplicate his pre-war success, his only great films between 1946 and 1950 being the classic holiday film IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE and the gritty Chicago detective film CALL NORTHSIDE 777.  But beginning in 1950, Stewart teamed up with director Anthony Mann for a string of superb Westerns that surpass any group of Westerns ever made, with the exception of John Wayne's partnership with John Ford.  While in his comedies Stewart had always been a good-hearted, solid, highly likeable gent, in these Westerns he usually was complex, haunted, driven, and as a rule somewhat anti-social.  It was a dramatic change from his earlier films.  Stewart was able to use these roles as a springboard back to other, sometimes even bigger roles, completely revitalizing his career, and establishing him as an actor capable of some darkly complex, varied roles.

THE FAR COUNTRY is the fourth collaboration between Stewart and Mann.  It is not one of the finest films in the series, but that isn't because this isn't a very good film, but because the others were so exceptionally fine.  As in most of these films, Mann is concerned to show men and women on the outer edge of Western expansion, struggling not merely with nature, but with the vagaries of human nature.  The wildness of the settings always serves as not merely a backdrop but as a symbol of the struggles of human beings against one another.  There is little admirable in the men who are involved in fulfilling Manifest Destiny; these are greedy, hard, cruel, capable, and vicious men, and the wise person trusts no one but oneself.  But in each film, the smaller, dearer, more human virtues of love, forgiveness, and hope manage miraculously to win out.  The frontier turns men into such rugged individuals that they become slightly less than human.  These films invariably end with Stewart's character moving gradually and perceptibly towards humanity.

Mann was one of the directors who first broke out of the confining Hollywood back lots to film primarily on location.  Unlike John Ford, who continually refilmed in Monument Valley, each Mann film would opt for a new locale:  WINCHESTER 73 in Arizona, BEND IN THE RIVER near Mt. Hood another other locations in Oregon, THE NAKED SPUR in Colorado, THE MAN FROM LARIMIE in New Mexico, and this film in Jasper and Banff National Parks in Canada.

The quality of this cast can't be exaggerated.  Stewart adds yet another stellar performance to his resume as Jeff Webster, a not-very-nice and profoundly self-interested individual trying to score big enough to get his own spread in Utah.  Ruth Roman manages to hold her own with the mean, but she doesn't generate the onscreen charisma that a Barbara Stanwyck would have been able to in the same kind of role.  John McIntire is suitably nasty as the film's chief villain.  It is the supporting cast that makes the roster so outstanding.  Was there some secret contract that every Western made in the fifties had to have either Walter Brennan, Jay C. Flippen, or Jack Elam in it?  This one manages to find all three.  When you add other veteran character actors like Henry Morgan you have a group of familiar and highly competent actors who managed carry off Mann's vision with great aplomb.

The film features a marvelous score, though curiously no one is credited with it.  A search on the Internet revealed that four composers were responsible for it, including the great Henry Mancini, though the style isn't one a person normally associates with him.  There is no way to know who was responsible for what in the score, but it is compelling throughout.  Like with Mann's other Westerns, this is a glorious thing to watch.  With the pristine Canadian locales, it possesses a visual exoticism that is rare in Hollywood Westerns.  With such backgrounds as Jasper and Banff provided, the photography is gripping throughout.  Unlike many other directors who would film a part of the film on location but much or even most in a Hollywood back lot, this film is clearly photographed in the field.  It was an expensive way to make a film, but we today are the beneficiaries of their added efforts and expense.

This isn't the Mann-Stewart film that I would recommend most for the newcomer to their series.  That would be either THE NAKED SPUR or THE MAN FROM LARAMIE, but all of these films are exceedingly fine, and all of them are important to the career of both men.  No one who loves movies could find any of them disappointing.

The DVD is not stuffed with extras, but the print is decent, and the price is exceptionally reasonable.",1095379200,56,4981,4.790398126463701
756815,5,6304016468,"Some time back Humphrey Bogart was selected the number one male screen legend by the A.F.I. (American Film Institute or Asinine Film Idiots, take your pick.) Cary Grant came in second and James Stewart third.  Without taking away anything from any of these fine actors, I think this is outrageous.  I mean, how many light comedies was Bogart in?  How many westerns was Grant in?  In my opinion James Stewart was the greatest male film actor ever, and I'd knock Bogart all the way down to ninth place (between James Cagney and Spencer Tracy.)  Then again, I've never thought CASABLANCA was ""The Movie,"" so I suppose I'll never understand.
 Now that I've got that out of my system.... James Stewart DID star in a number of westerns, and his best were made in collaboration with Anthony Mann.  THE FAR COUNTRY may not be the best, but it's a strong entry.  Stewart plays Jeff Webster, a loner who's only friend is Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan.)  Mann works by throwing opposites in the air and watching what gravity does to them - Ben is domestic and social (he talks about settling down with Jeff on a small ranch in Utah), Jeff is anti-social and footloose.
 THE FAR COUNTRY begins in the port of Seattle, where Jeff arrives with a herd of cattle intended for the beef hungry (and rich) gold country of Alaska.  He also arrives with two fewer drivers than he began with - he shot them, we are told, because they left the drive and took his cattle with them.  Watching Stewart's suspicious eyes narrow and his hand hover over his guns after he returns guns to the two remaining drivers (""Here.  You've been waiting to use them for 500 miles."") you can tell that he's an effective enforcer of frontier justice.
 Jeff and Ben meet an even more effective enforcer when they reach Skagway.  Sheriff Gannon (John McIntire) is the only irredeemable character in the movie.  Quick on the draw and cop, judge and jury in the wild frontier town of Skagway Gannon is totally corrupt.  Stewart's two love interests, Good Girl Renee Vallon (Corinne Calvet) and Bad Girl Ronda Castle (Ruth Roman) round out the strong cast of major characters.
  McIntire is delightfully wicked as the stove-pipe hat wearing hanging judge.  Sheriff Gannon is motivated by greed and sadism, and McIntire plays him with gusto.  Stewart explores the darker side with his customary intelligence and talent - Jeff Webster is a difficult role, and Stewart makes his journey from misanthropy to social consciousness utterly convincing.  Roman is the beautiful saloon owner who may be redeemed by love.  Calvet is the French gamin whose beauty (Calvet was a pin-up model in the late `40s and early `50s) is hidden beneath a wool stocking cap and behind a heavy flannel shirt.
 Brennan, his upper dental plate out in this one, is the bridge between Jeff Webster and the rest of society.  His sin is too much sociability.  For my money, Brennan is a can't-miss actor.  If he's in it, it's probably good.
 The film was shot on location in Jasper National Park in Alberta, Canada, and it looks magnificent.
 If you're familiar only with the MR. SMITH GOES TO WASHINGTON/IT'S A WONDERFUL LIFE/ HARVEY Jimmy Stewart, and you'd like to see him in an oater exploring the dark side, THE FAR COUNTRY is a good place to start.  I recommended this one without qualifications.",1084579200,43,3320,4.7334494773519165

Stewart drives a herd North to Seattle, and then by steamer to Alaska, where a corrupt judge, played by John McIntyre, tries to steal his herd.

Stewart comes through, though.

This is a Western from another generation--the ""good old days.""  I loved them, with Gable, Stewart, Peck and the rest of the old-timers whose characters showed on their faces.

756818,5,6304016468,"The Far Country is the most quintessential collaboration between director Anthony Mann, actor James Stewart and screenplayer Borden Chase. The movie epitomizes the western according to Mann and more precisely the fascinating possibilities offered by the Stewart persona as a rugged, selfish individualist eventually condemned by the mere force of events to stand by the new-born community. Essentially malevolent, Jeff Webster  selfishness will have to come to terms with  Gannon, a truculent and almost cheerful Roy Bean- liked judge tyrannicaly ruling the booming  and muddy city of Skagway : John Mc Intire versus James Stewart. Only the violent death of his old ranching partner Ben (a marvellous Walter Brennan)will transform Stewart into what might be expected from a western hero.
The magic of the film lies as much in its jubilant treatment of western situations( the stampede of Stewart's cattle out of the steamboat in Skagway, the brutal and colored atmosphere of Skagway under Gannon's heels, the crossing of the mountains en route to the gold mines of Yukon...)as in the vivid painting of characters each viewer feels like knowing. It has been said that each scene could justify a whole film, which is just partly true since the film does so perfectly well. The blend of strength, weakness, doubts...in one word ; the humanity Stewart brougth to this now legendary series of films , together with the air-capturing ability of Mann's filming put these films very high( ask Costner, Eastwood, Jarmush, Scorcese...)

Jimmy Stewart plays a sharpshooting straight talker who just plain doesn't want to be bothered with other peoples' worries. When he sees two men being robbed and murdered, he doesn't pick one off his horse to hamper his escape, but `because he shot at me.' As Gannon's atrocities branch out to a neighboring peaceful Yukon town, the town turns to him...and is rejected.
This is the story of a man finding himself drawn into a role which he wants no part of - that of protector.  In fact, for three fourths of the movie there is a grudging admiration shared by Gannon and Stewart's character, till Gannon goes too far...and in The Far Country, that's a long way.
This is a great story with some fine performances -particularly by the satellite cast...Connie Calvet as a French girl who hustles panners out of gold dust yet persists in telling Stewart to do the right thing (she is admittedly a less likely love interest than Ruth Roman's fiery frontier femme - sort of like a lighter version of Marlene Dietrich in Destry Rides Again) is good, Jay C. Flippen is fine as a well meaning panner, and those three gals that run the hash house (which serves nothing but bear meat) -love their names - Hominy, Grits, and Molasses - are great!
Maybe not as involving as Winchester 73 or some of the other Mann/Stewart collaborations, but well worth it nonetheless.  Great final shootout.
The best line is when Gannon gets the drop on Jimmy and motions to his hand, asking him if he was going to pull that pistol...

756823,3,6304016468,"This is another excellent western directed by Anthony Mann and starring James Stewart. Stewart and Brennan are cattle-drivers planning to sell their herd in the Yukon territory. An accusation of murder brings Stewart into contact with Miss Dawson, also on her way to the Yukon. Arriving in Skagway, Stewart has a run in with the town marshall - Gannon: he seizes Stewart's herd as compensation. Stewart and Brennan are then employed by Miss Castle to drive a supply wagon into the Yukon to the town of Dawson. Stewart takes the chance to steal back his herd and drive them on to Dawson. As the Yukon is outside of Gannon's jurisdiction it looks as if Stewart and Brennan are free to pan for gold in Dawson. Not everyone likes Miss Castle though as it seems she owns a lot of the property in Dawson. When Gannon arrives on the scene, Stewart must seek another way out.
An excellent story, Stewart portrays a man who is generally a loner, he wants to mind his own business. In the town of Dawson he is ultimately faced with going it alone or standing by the people of Dawson.
While I rate the film 4 stars, the DVD only warrants 2 giving an average of 3 stars. Once again, Universal have chosen to use the laserdisc print for this film. Overall the transfer is fine but the print could do with some restoration work - there is a noticeable jump in one scene. The picture quality is generally good, better than VHS but it could be a lot better. There is some noise on the soundtrack, not distracting but don't expect crystal clear quality.

7858751,4,6304016468,"RELEASED IN 1954 and directed by Anthony Mann, The Far Country stars Jimmy Stewart as a self-centered cattleman, Jeff Webster, who conflicts with a crooked, self-appointed lawman (John McIntire) while driving cattle through Skagway, Alaska, to Dawson during the 1896 Klondike gold rush. Ruth Roman plays a formidable woman he meets on the steamship, who unfortunately works for Gannon (McIntire). Walter Brennan plays Jeffs best friend while Corinne Calvet plays a tough foreign settler with romantic inclinations.

This was the fourth of five Westerns Mann did with Stewart. These were uncompromisingly harsh, psychological Westerns featuring themes of revenge, obsession, rage and redemption. They were spectacularly shot on location, rather than in the studio, providing a backdrop of authentic rugged beauty. This one was shot in Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada, with one episode involving Athabasca Glacier.

The opening sequence on the steamship is memorable for the way Jeff (Stewart) escapes ship authorities with the assistance of Ruth Romans character. Roman is stalwart, stunning and surprisingly vivacious (for her role as a woman in the rough NW wilderness). Gannon (McIntire) is an interesting antagonist due to the way he joyfully basks in his power and overt corruption.

7858752,5,6304016468,"I'm an unproduced screenwriter. Screenwriters are constantly reminded about the fundamental importance of subtext. Whatever characters say or do, there should always be something under the surface. No one should ever speak the whole truth, or reveal all of who they truly are.

This films subtext is revealed in the author's (Borden Chases) observation That I believe is the greatest love story in all of the world. I don't mean sexual. I have always believed that a man can actually love and respect another man more so than he can a woman. * The Far Country is a love story  not of a man for a woman, but of men for each other.

Jeff Webster (James Stewart) is the sort of independent cuss who just doesnt want to get involved in other peoples problems  or relationships with them. His goal is to settle down on a ranch with his best buddy, Ben Tatem (Walter Brennan), in a bachelor marriage.

Bens attachment to Jeff is obvious. ** He carries a little bell, which hell hang on the door of the ranchs cabin. When a visitor arrives, and the bell rings, Ben (a coffee addict) will know its time to brew more coffee.

Up to the point Ben is murdered, this is Jeffs goal. Everything else is secondary, including female attachments. (Though presumably heterosexual, Jeff shows no romantic interest in women, not even Ronda (Ruth Roman).) Bens murder finally forces Jeff to do something about Dawsons lawlessness  though his motivation is arguably based more on revenge than principle.

If there are lingering doubts about the storys meaning, the ending upsets all expectations of how such a story should end. Ronda dies protecting Jeff  and is immediately forgotten! The film's final shot is of Bens tinkling bell hanging from Jeffs pommel, driving home what the story is actually about.

* The Borden Chase Wikipedia article offers a fuller discussion of his views on male/male relationships.

** Brennan is well-cast as a slightly comic sidekick  perhaps intentionally so. A younger actor would make Bens emotional attachment more obvious  and more uncomfortable for the viewer. See, for example, Thirty a Month and Found (one of the great Gunsmoke episodes) with a mans best friend dying before they can reach the ranch on which they would have settled down. Festus offers a comment  They was as close as two men could be  showing that the author (Jim Byrnes) knows exactly what the situation implies.",1501891200,,2401,4.8504901960784315

Another great western story with James Stewart at the helm. Worth watching over and over.",1498089600,,184,4.967741935483871
7858754,4,6304016468,"If a viewer enjoys Hollywood History, this is an excellent example of a 1950s era western.  Director Anthony Mann teamed up with James Stewart on several movies that are worth seeing.  There are various westerns and non westerns.

I think what I like most about this particular movie, other than the fact that it is a Mann / Stewart Western, it is the setting and cinematography.  The movie is shot in Canada and much of the scenery is really worth seeing.  In the same context, the movie has a different feel to it.

Walter Brennan appears and seemingly plays the same character that he somehow ten played in various movies.  Similarly, Jack Elam appears playing a villain role as he so often did.  James Stewart rides the same horse, ""Pie"", in this movie that he rode in some 17 westerns.

You can always count on a quality product from Anthony Mann and James Stewart.  I enjoy this movie, but more as a fan and student of Hollywood History than as a Western on its own merits.  Thank You...",1494201600,,993,4.522471910112359

7858756,3,6304016468,James Stewart always brought a laid back style to his movies.  This is a good western that may not be as well known as some of his other movies.  He and Walter Brennan  play partners trying to sell a herd of cattle during the Alaskan gold rush.  Stewart is tougher in this then he is a lot of times.  And the acting buy him and the rest of the cast is good.,1489449600,,357,3.9027777777777777
