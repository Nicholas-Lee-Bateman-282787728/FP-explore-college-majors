8086445,1,B000BGQUKM,"I am totally displeased with this product.  First the release date made me believe that this product was released in 2004 when in actually it was a corporate video probably made in 1994!!!  There is no mention of any current operating systems since this tape was made before Windows95!!!  It is totally out-of-date!!! Second Amazon charged $10 over the amount charged by EVN (Free shipping my backend).  And finally I found spelling mistakes and concepts that don't apply for today's computers.  A waste of time, a waste of money, and totally useless.  Other than that it was packaged nicely.",1146873600,9,592,4.929292929292929
