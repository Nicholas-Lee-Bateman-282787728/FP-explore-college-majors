8097522,3,B000CCQU4Q,"Anyone familiar with the two films Safari Express and Africa Express will probably be in on the joke above. Safari Express stars Giuliano Gemma, Jack Palance and Ursula Andress as a woman with amnesia. The quasi-sequel, Africa Express, has the same star trio, only Andress plays a nun in disguise. Although I ordered Safari Express as shown above, when I popped in the DVD it was in fact Africa Express! So for the sake of clarity the above DVD IS NOT SAFARI EXPRESS BUT AFRICA EXPRESS. This was no grave dissapointment for me as I hadn't seen either film.
If you like foreign comedies from the 1970s in the Bud Spencer - Terence Hill vein then you'll like this, I'd even say its much better than Hill and Spencers African comedy ""I'm For the Hippopatamus."" The main star Gemma is himself the veteran of several Spaghetti Westerns, of particular note a great comedy called ""Sundance Cassidy and Butch the Kid"" similar to the Trinity films.
As for this DVD the video quality isn't great, but then again where else can you get this in English and Region One? Coincidentally, Amazon also sells AFRICA EXPRESS on DVD, I wonder is it really SAFARI EXPRESS since the above advertised DVD is really AFRICA EXPRESS?",1357171200,4,1207,4.69811320754717
