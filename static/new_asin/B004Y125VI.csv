8447822,5,B004Y125VI,"This dvd has 3 short films about the holcaust. The 1st one, Lest We Forget, is especially interesting as it's in color, the 1st time I've seen color holocaust footage. The second film, Nazi Concentation Camps, is the longest of the films clocking in a just under an hour. I've seen it before and it is an excellent, and perhaps perfect example of nazi horrors at their death camps. The print is very clean. The final film, deals with Nuremberg and the nazis being put on trial. It's all very compelling and although it's very disturbing, it's a story that must be told,""lest we forget"".",1304553600,3,586,4.59047619047619
