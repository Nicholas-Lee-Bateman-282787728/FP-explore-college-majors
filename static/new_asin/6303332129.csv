7843855,5,6303332129,"This is a slow-paced, culturally rich, family friendly movie about a young man who is not feeling part of his family/clan.  Through his relationship to whales, and from the stories of his elders, he reconnects with who he is and where he comes from.  My children had this movie years ago and we used to watch it together.  Pity that this is not available as a DVD.",1483747200,,364,4.402985074626866
