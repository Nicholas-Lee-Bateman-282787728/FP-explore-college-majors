7918498,5,B00003ETMO,"I love these ""documentaries"" about American life. Intellectuals need not bother watching this program! It's fun, informative, and just the right length of time. My 3 sons watched the entire show without moving until the last 5 minutes or so. Their favorite part was about The Varsity in Atlanta. For several days the boys were chanting like the counter man at The Varsity, ""Whaaddda ya have,Whaddda ya have?"" If we ever go to Atlanta again, we will have to eat there!

The people featured in the stories are what makes this show so appealing. I was interested to find that some of the families had been selling hot dogs for several generations! There is a uniqueness to their businesses that you don't see in the fast food and chain store establishments.

We watched The Ice Cream Show the same evening and enjoyed it as well.",1147737600,,826,4.689655172413793
