2326835,5,B0009WFEEG,"I have been checking here a lot the last several months and have been wondering why it takes so long for these seasons to be released on DVD when all these other shows come right out on DVD even when they air them on TV the same year. Will & Grace is a really good show and worth watching.  They should start releasing the other seasons a little more quicker. I also agree with these other guys, they should release a BETTER & WORTHY DVD at least a better one than Season 3 which to me was a poor set with no subtitles or any extras. Lets HOPE THIS IS A WORTHY DVD COLLECTION FOLKS!!!!!!!!!",1120780800,,590,4.130434782608695
2326836,5,B0009WFEEG,"the reason the release took sooooo long was because the cast was renegotiating their contracts and nothing could be released until that was completed and luckily it was resolved!!!! this is a really really great season!

2326846,1,B0009WFEEG,"Yes, Will and Grace is finally available digitally. That's the only good news to offer.
All the seasons available include syndicated episodes that are cut even more than their DVDs were. What that means is that the episodes are cut to air on other networks to include more commercials. This is not how they originally aired!
Some how long episodes are split into two and are missing footage!
Some episodes are 16x9 and others are 4x3.
What a mess! Don't bother. Even the DVDs are better than these.
For more information about what's cut on the DVD's, check out the W&G wiki page.  This set is even WORSE than the DVD's.",1502668800,,619,4.576576576576577

2327049,4,B0009WFEEG,"If you didn't feel the magic disappear at the start of season 4 you'll really FEEL IT NOW by the time you finish this season! Will & Grace was always a great show from the beginning and pure magic from seasons 1 - 3. But when season 4 started with Woody Harrelson as Grace's love interest the chemistry and magic between all the lead characters seem to disappear over night. Will & Grace never really had the FUNNY CRAZY lines but they worked well with what they were given. Instead all the good lines were given to Jack & Karen. Pretty much in my opinion for the shows 8 year run it's always secretly been called the Jack & Karen show. Anyways at this point since Will & Grace weren't even given any decent lines, the below average lines that were given they had to turn humorous which just came off really desperate and made the 2 characters even more annoying then they originally were. The show from this point just doesn't have any element to keep you tuning in each week and starts to decline quite gradually. Every episode of this season is almost a pain to watch. You try and look forward to the next laugh and all you get are bad jokes with bad a delivery from the actors and a lot of empty spaces in-between when waiting for the next joke. Every episode you could already tell this show was on its last legs. It wasn't about making people laugh anymore. It was more about learning a life lesson at the end of each episode. When a show starts to become learning about Life Lessons that's when it becomes like the Family Matters sitcom and SLOW torture. I was in shock that this show went on for 8 years. When the show 1st started and after an amazing season 3 I always thought this show would last longer then the over rated Friends sitcom. I also asked myself how are they gonna top the AMAZING 3rd season. But after season 4 it was time to hang up the hat and call it a day. As i mentioned it was always about Jack & Karen and the writers or producers really OVER USED the 2 characters to do crazy things and in all honesty i think the actors PASSION for doing the show started to dwindle. There comes a point in everyone's job if you're in the same position for years where you feel like you know what you're doing and that you've MASTERED the art of IT and nothing is a challenge anymore. That situation applies here and you can really feel that with the cast of Will & Grace. Despite that my review maybe coming off negative i do like all of the 4 main actors and this is Will & Grace so i rated it with a 4 star even though i wanted it to be 3 1/2. But because its Will & Grace i still give it a chance. Bare this in mind, the CAST became so GREAT at their CRAFT that they became INVALUABLE.",1202688000,,2706,4.185823754789272

2327055,4,B0009WFEEG,"WILL & GRACE didn't leave much to the imagination, during the course of their fourth season.  In fact, there is something juicy, here, for just about every character.  As an example, Jack McFarland (Sean Hayes), who we know best as the opportunistic and childlike best friend of Will (Eric McCormack) has a son, Elliott (Michael Angarano), from his stint as a sperm donor.  In an effort to bond with Elliott, Jack spends time with him and introduces the boy to his world, as well as trying to relate to the pre-teen in his own world.  Grace (Debra Messing) is still involved with her upstairs neighbor (Woody Harrelson), if but for a brief time.  Karen (Megan Mullally), Grace's perpetually pill popping/drunk ""assistant,"" runs into some legal trouble with her often spoke of, but never seen, husband, Stan.  Will (Eric McCormack)'s father is Sidney Pollack, in a hilarious, recurring role.  Need I say more?

2327072,5,B0009WFEEG,"I only discovered Will & Grace in reruns.  It's one of the funniest shows on air right now.  For those of you who think that the premise is unbelievable, it's not.  I've had a best friend who was gay and a lot of the dynamics from the show are true to life.  I know having gone through some if it.

Will and Grace are best friends but Will is a gay man and Grace is a heterosexual female.  They remain friends no matter what happens even though they do fight and walk away from each other for awhile.  They always get back together.  Jack and Karen are the friends that makeup the foursome.  In Jack's case though he's more leach than friend.  He never keeps a job for long, always wants a handout and fancies himself a great want to be actor, dancer and singer.  Jack is gay and flamboyant which drives Will nuts because while he is gay he is not outrageously so nor is he effeminant.  Karen is filthy rich.  She's a pill popping, boozing, abuse giving, well dressed woman who thinks that other folks were created to serve her every desire.

Kudos to the casting deparment.  Each member of the foursome creates their character accurately.  Normally in tv land, it might take two or three seasons before the players really nail their characters down but the cast of Will and Grace did it in half a season.  By the middle of season one, the Karen character had found her niche with the high pitched nasal voice and her sarcastic laugh.  All play off of each other very well.  In fact I find Megan's (Karen) real voice much more annoying than her false one.  All in all I have to say that I am putting this show in my personal list of all time funny shows (All in the Family, Mash, Night Court, Frazier, Absolutely Fabulous) with AITF in the lead of course.

I do wish the studio would get it together and release season five already.  What's up with that?  Fans are tired of waiting.  Come on people get the lead out and crank it up!!",1147219200,5,1933,4.32033426183844
2327073,2,B0009WFEEG,"This season marked the end of my interest in ""Will & Grace."" During these episodes, the show really veers away from the original premise, a straight woman living with a homosexual man.

The season begins with the continuation of the romance between Grace (Debra Messing) and Nathan (Woody Harrelson). This storyline really started me to dislike the show for two reasons: 1) Any boyfriend broke up the great comedic chemistry between Will (Eric McCormack) and Grace; 2) Woody Harrelson's character was altered from the one he portrayed at the end of Season 3 to make him a more believable romantic interest for Grace.

This season also marks the complete transformation of Jack and Karen from hilariously quirky to unlikeably mean.

The real lowlight of this series is the Glenn Close episode, in which she plays a coked-up photographer. This episode ranks as the worst and most embarassing guest shot in TV history and leads into the incredibly dumb storyline about Will and Grace trying to have a baby that finally caused me to stop watching this show.

However, the episode with Ms. Close's ""Fatal Attraction"" co-star, Michael Douglas, is absolutely hilarious. Matt Damon is also very funny as a heterosexual acting gay to be in Jack's choir.

But aside from these episodes, by Season 4, ""Will & Grace"" was really more of the same jokes that everyone now knew were coming and storylines that distorted the characters we came to like in Seasons 1 to 3.",1145923200,4,1453,4.890243902439025

2327100,3,B0009WFEEG,"Season 4, like all of this show's seasons, is very funny.  The show has never needed its guest stars to be entertaining, and has been the only sitcom to ever successfully you guests stars (repeatedly) without diminshing the roles of the stars in the episodes and seemlessly putting them into an episode.

This is a show I did not watch on live TV, got hung up on it during reruns so picked up the DVDs.  It is a great show, but sadly this season ends on a sour note.  Forgetting it's a comedy, we watch Karen and Jack have dreams crushed, and Will and Grace think about having a baby together and disappointing each other - -  only to roll into next season with Will angry at Grace when she finally meets Mr. Right.

Ultimately, the Season is worth the sad end; I only hope Season 5 has a quick redemption.",1132099200,2,806,4.304635761589404

""Prison Blues"" is also great and features one of my favorite W&G guest stars - Zandra Eileen Brennan.  ""Loose Lips..."" is when Jack's boss Parker Posey has a crush on Will - great stuff there too.  ""Moveable Feast"" and ""Bed Bath and Beyond"" are definitely masterpieces of writing and acting.  One of my all-time favorites is ""Stakin' Care of Business"" - Jack and Will are so hilarious in this episode; and Karen & Grace are just as hilarious locking each other in the elevator.  The Matt Damon episode is one of the best 'guest star' episodes out there.  There are a few episodes in here that I can take or leave, but for the most part, W&G was still going strong in Season 4.",1127347200,,934,4.426900584795321

I believe I am now more tolerant of gayability, and see people gay people as real people who are just ""gaytastic""!  That being said, I am still NOY GAY.  At least I'm pretty sure.

I think that Sean Hayes is the funniest one on the show because he his character is the dumbiest one and he is so gullible like in one episode he thought Santa decorated the window at Barney's.

The plotlines were creative, the jokes were incredibly smart, the acting was amazing, and the show was just really in it's sitcom niche. That said, these DVD sets are taking way too long to come out and then are quite expensive for the lack of features on them. I for one do not even consider the ""themed featurettes"" a special feature as they're pretty much a clip show. It is nice to see the inclusion of outtakes, but I'd much rather see some behind the scenes stuff!
