5114590,4,B007Y6CTSY,"This movie shows ballerinas, focusing on several who are attempting to become professional by obtaining scholarships to schools. These dancers are all growing up, some are young and some are adolescents. I thought this might have been the symbol for a coming new age, yet I see dance as more free. Ballet is hard work and it is very contained. I liked their physical exertion. I really liked the thought of having a stretching coach. The costumes were handmade and beautiful. I liked the little girl named Gaya. She had such expressiveness when she danced, so playful and happy. Her mother was so supportive and seemed happy. This is a documentary but it was entertaining.",1337904000,2,672,4.852173913043479
5114591,1,B007Y6CTSY,I would give it zero stars however doesn't allow me to write review. The quality of movie is terrible it's faded in color and look very dull.,1486166400,,141,4.2592592592592595

5114595,4,B007Y6CTSY,"Even if you don't like ballet I highly recommend this film.  I won't repeat the compliments so many others have heaped on this great documentary.

I have deducted one star because the film almost never shows the entirety of the main characters' dances at the competitions.  Instead, the director chose to only show a snippet of each dance along with frenetic camera work and long shots of the audience and their parents.  Why?!  This decision is an insult to the dancers and the viewers.  While we get a good sense of the commitment and sacrifices that have been made to reach the competitions we never really get to see their performances.  So odd and frustrating.

Other than that I truly enjoyed this documentary.",1471392000,,716,4.764227642276423
5114596,5,B007Y6CTSY,"As a former ballet dancer, this film does a beautiful job showing off the sport of ballet.

5114603,5,B007Y6CTSY,"Do you have what it takes to live your dreams?  As you watch FIRST POSITION you will see Miko Fogarty (part Japanese), Gaya Yemini (Israeli), Michaela DePrince (Sierra Leone) and Joan Sebastian (Hispanic/Latin) all under the ages of 18 prepare to compete in the annual Youth America Grand Prix. This competition is so competitive that each dancer must do what it takes to win contracts, scholarships and the ability to be seen by the most prestigious ballet companies around the world.

In this documentary there were several other dancers showcased but I chose these four dancers because they stood out to me.  Each of these dancers represented an international force that was unmatched.  Each of these dancers, despite the odds had to forsake all to live their dreams. Just before the big night Michaela experienced a foot injury that could cripple her for life what does she do?  Will she be able to live her dream and eventually open a ballet school in Sierra Leone?  Joan Sebastian has to sacrifice living away from his family to prepare for his dream.  Regardless, of his loneliness for his family and home he knew that if he pursued his dream that he could then help make a better life for his family.  Will he be chosen to eventually live out his dreams?

If you have a dream and you are looking for inspiration you will definitely get it watching FIRST POSITION.",1449360000,,1371,4.726890756302521

Having been a dancer with Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre for over twenty years.
Rising to the rank of principal dancer I can tell you that this is a very accurate depiction of the rigors of serious classical training for young dancers.
These dancers are all extremely talented and there journey towards making their passion into their career is harrowing.

5114615,5,B007Y6CTSY,"I bought this DVD purely by accident as I enjoy ballet as an art form. From the first viewing, I have been transfixed by the Michaela DePrince story. I have viewed it six times. The only critical I can say about this DVD are the commercials of movies at the front, which come on automatically.. But you can easily use your remote to skip over them by clicking the ""next chapter"" button seven times. I strongly suggest you view this film at least once with the director's comments turned on. It lowers the normal audio to a whisper, but it is very interesting as to what Bess says during the whole film. Of course watch the film first with the normal audio, so you have an idea what is going on, before listening to Bess.
I am saddened by Rebecca Houseknecht's story, but that is life. As she gets children of her own, she may become aware of her selfishness.",1431043200,,858,4.36875

5114618,5,B007Y6CTSY,"My sister got this DVD of ""First Position"" for my daughter who is a dancer. She is almost ten and has been dancing since age 3. This movie was so inspirational for her given some struggles she has been facing by being teased about her skin color at school.
This movie allows you to experience several dancers lives personally and professionally as they seek one of the most coveted titles as a dancer. It truly is a beautiful story, and left me tearful at times.
I give it five stars for the beautiful choreography and the fact this movie is based on a true story.  My daughter truly could relate to this and it left her so very inspired, ready to dance, and happy to be who she is!",1429315200,,682,4.286821705426356

Sent the DVD to 13 year old granddaughter who is studying ballet (in class four days a week) and who loved watching the film.  A few of her classmates entered the competition while in Denver and one of the girls was pleased to be in the 12th spot in her age group....out of hundreds of competitors.  An honest look at a very tough world.  Jinx Riedesel  PS.  Tried to move the cursor to five stars in blue and it kept pushing me back to one star in yellow.  Help.,1426809600,4,606,4.339285714285714

5114652,5,B007Y6CTSY,"First of all, not a ballet fan, so I'm not sure what drew me to this in the first place...but I am so glad what a wonderful documentary about a diverse and truly awe-inspiring group of young people. After seeing this film these dancers have it as hard or even harder than any and I mean any professional sports player. I was engrossed in the small snippets of these kids lives, not characters, real people. All of theses kids are driven and exceptional..Michaela is a 14 year old from Sierra Leone and adopted by a lovely white older couple here and has seen things no child should. Rebeccah, the 16 year old very upper class girl from the U.S. Miko is 12 and her brother Jules is 10, Navy family all over the world. 19 year old Joan Sebastian and he is from very poor Colombia and he needs this competition to get into a ballet company. The most amazing is Aran and 11 year old boy who strikes me as old and wise way beyond his years. I fell in love with each of these children, such remarkable kids. Very highly recommended.",1400976000,,1026,4.321243523316062

5114654,5,B007Y6CTSY,"It's a documentary, not a performance, so this is where I'm supposed to say how great it is to see the stories behind the dancers, their personal struggles, the sacrifices they make, the sore feet and bodies  and all that is true. But that's been done a million times with all arts and sports. What you get here is a glimpse at something television (at least in the U.S.) never allows us to see: real ballet dancing and competition of up-and-coming ballet stars, names we'll see (and hopefully watch if we're very lucky) in the future. Some of these youngsters are brilliant, and I've seen the best ballets in the world. The young man on the cover and a 12-year-old girl are worthy of the Bolshoi or American Ballet Theater or any of the great companies in the world. The little 11-year-old boy is almost right up there. He needs another few years, but we've not seen the last of him! Unreal. I had tears in my eyes when they were done and won their medals and scholarships. And that's not because their stories are so great, although getting to know them pulls at the heartstrings more. But because they're so good, and you know how few can make it and how close they probably came to not making it. If you don't appreciate dance, I don't think the stories are unique enough to be worth the trouble. If you are, bring your Kleenex and comfy shoes for standing ovations and dancing along.",1398729600,,1388,4.486166007905139

FYI: The moment caught in  cover photograph appears NOWHERE in the film or in any of its extras. In fact, there is not one moment in the film that approaches the beauty of the DVD's cover art. Quite the contrary, the film rarely rises above the level of a local television station's coverage of dance competitions and the necesary training that precedes them.

We have many good ways to get to the high standards in ballet.

5114679,5,B007Y6CTSY,"I saw this film and knew immediately that I had to show it to my high school fine arts class.  A great majority of my students have no real experience with music, drama, dance, or visual arts.  Most find the symphony or ballet extremely boring and not really worth experiencing.
  However, one common denominator can be found when comparing the ballet dancers in this movie to my students.  They all have that ""fire"" in their bellies---a passion or a drive that causes them to practice for hours after school for that football game, to begin a love and, possibly, a career for baseball when they're only three or four years old, to have a dream that may seem impossibly out of reach because of economic boundaries or the practicality of a home situation or environment.
  So, I believe I may just be able to ""sneak"" in a little bit of culture to these students of mine.  I myself was fascinated by these stories and the beauty of dance itself.  This is a beautiful and moving portrait, and I'm so thankful that I was able to discover this film.",1375056000,,1044,4.51063829787234

However, this movie gives a different perspective and an alternative way of starting a ballet career. These kids don't seem to grow in a disrespectful environment, they just have a very strong family support (moral and financial) and amazing motivation. Along with great teachers and talent, the competitive environment is what helps them grow into wonderful dancers. It was a relief to see that the Russian old-school system is not an only way to train wonderful dancers. This movie is very inspirational, interesting and touching.",1372032000,,700,5.043103448275862

Could tell I would like the video and so rented it on amazon but now I think I'm going to have to buy it as well.  I absolutely loved watching it and so did my daughter.  I really want to watch some of these dancers in the future as they become older: Aran, Miko, Gaya, Joan Sebastian, and Michaela.  I loved the scope of the movie...showing the dedication, the good, and the bad, the injuries, the heartache when the kids make a mistake, the joy of having a perfect performance.  A friend who has dancing experience watched this and didn't recommend it to me since she said ""you're not a dancer""...but that is purely because I didn't have the opportunity.  I think dancers and non-dancers alike would enjoy this movie, if just for the stories behind it.  Great job directing and editing.",1371340800,,961,4.584795321637427

5114699,4,B007Y6CTSY,"So do you want the good news first or the bad news? Bad, you? OK, here goes: The film seemed too short/lacked depth.

The good? Very good doc. The nice camerawork with good use of shallow depth of field (out of focus backgrounds, in focus foreground), and a very strong sound score that backed the beautifully executed editing, I would liken this film to my second-place-all-time-best youth competition documentary--More Than A Game (with first being Hoop Dreams).

No dull lifeless moments at all throughout this film, although I wish they had more footage of the home lives of these children.  How do they interact at school and in society outside of dancing? How do they get through family hardships? Do they shed tears for anything other than ballet?  You almost instantly fall into the fan club for each one of the main subjects which makes you want to know more about them.  Are these children losers with no other value than when they're on the stage?  Maybe all of my questions will be answered in 2016 with the sequel--Second Position?

Good film. Oh, and to jab at another film, Searching For Sugar Man wishes it was as good as this one",1366588800,,1146,4.6716417910447765

5114701,5,B007Y6CTSY,"Each character has his/her own unique story, however I'm especially moved by Aran and Gaya, Aran has unbelievable skills with amazing precision and strength. His performance is world class, the only thing lacking is understandably strength in his legs, which will be undoubtedly obtained over time. I'm completely moved by his performance. His instructor went as far as saying ""my life is now complete with Aran"".

Gaya, as her teacher mentioned, ""when she started to perform, she completely changed to an adult"",  you can feel the intensity from her eyes and body. Her performance in Wild Horses and Coppelia is almost perfect. The ""Cartoon Girl"" dance is absolutely breathtaking and great fun to watch. They have a very bright future for sure.

What moves me is that they are also best friends, they are young and funny, Gaya started to dance because of Aran, talk about life long friendship.

The dances from extra are quite amazing, don't miss them. There is a cute Russian girl with a cat (or tiger?) like costume.

Highly recommended!",1365638400,,1040,4.954022988505747
5114702,5,B007Y6CTSY,"Ballet requires a body which is flexible and can take pain regularly. To be a great ballet dancer you need to have beauty, passion and personality. A professional ballet dancer is done by age 35 which means dedication at youth and full commitment to ballet, nothing else since there will be nothing else due to what is required to be the best in the business only for few lucky individuals. That truly is a demanding profession especially when you have to punish your body day in and day out to keep it flexible which becomes prone to injuries just like any other professional athlete but in more severe case. The director of this documentary has done a superb job capturing the lives of those individuals who strive their best to be at the top of their game at a age when they are suppose to be just kids having fun with other kids. I am in many sports and very dedicated to my sports and my health and I was certainly humbled watching this documentary. Those kids are so mature for their age and behave not only gracefully on the dance floor, but yet more importantly as a person when having a conversation face to face. This is a must see documentary for any age but more importantly for families with inspiring kids who real want to achieve success at any age but more importantly at younger age.

At least then, you can watch hot chicks make out.  Let's face it - ballet sucks. It's just not interesting unless one of the following applies: (1) you're trying to come off as sophisticated in which case you're not really interested but only pretending to be; (2) you've participated in ballet enough to gain some level of appreciation for whatever the hell it is that they're doing, or (3) you're a six year old girl.

5114747,1,B007Y6CTSY,Totally love this movie when we saw it in Wellington.  Purchased it for christmas but sadly it is a zone that cannot be read in NZ - so we can't watch it.  Little disappointed but thats my fault for not understanding how the zones work (or don't work as the case may be).  The movie its self is incredible and a must for any young dancer.,1356566400,,338,4.090909090909091
5114748,5,B007Y6CTSY,"I was very impressed by the filmmakers portrayal of aspiring ballet dancers and the level of dedication by everyone involved. She also shows that the children have a level of maturity way beyond their years. It was very interesting to learn of the support by the ballet community.  The parents, teachers and schools that all work together to ensure the continuation of this wonderful art form.  I would recommend this film to anyone, but especially to anyone who dances, you will see parts of your journey here.",1356307200,,511,4.862068965517241

5114750,5,B007Y6CTSY,Interesting documentary.  I think they stress that this is how dancers find jobs a little too much.  YAGP is often a may to get into professional dance schools as well.  Even non-dancers would thoroughly enjoy this movie.,1356307200,,221,4.918918918918919
5114751,5,B007Y6CTSY,"I loved it so much.  Even if it is kind of frightening to watch the level of virtuosity that a young aspiring dancer needs nowadays, just to be accepted in a company (it wasn't like that in my days), I enjoyed every moment of glory of each one of this young aspiring dancers.  It should be useful for children who are studying to be professionals, as a thermometer of their own dancing, not necessarily to stop struggling and working hard to become professionals, but to have a better idea of what will be the expectations of a company when the time comes for them to look for a job.

I was specially captivated by the Colombian boy who needs to help his family and who is so talented.  I really hope the best for him and I am very anxious to hear of him in a short term future.",1355788800,,778,4.201342281879195

5114754,5,B007Y6CTSY,"This movie is a documentary following several extremely talented young dancers.  In fact, the dancers followed are among the best in the world.  They are all preparing to compete and competing in an international competition, the Grand Prix.  The winners receive large scholarships, recognition, and jobs.  The dancers followed range from about age 10 to age 17.

I thoroughly enjoyed this from start to finish.  First of all, it's rare to see a movie about dance that features truly great dancers.  Fictional movies usually use non-dancers or dancers who are not very good.  Documentaries don't get as their subjects the very best.  What I loved about this movie is that it really focused on very talented individuals.  The dancing alone was just extraordinary to watch.

In addition, the film-makers clearly had an adequate budget to travel around - to Rome, to Colombia, among other places.  This is not a shoestring production; it's done right.

Finally, the dancers themselves are just interesting - a girl adopted from Sierra Leone, a young male prodigy, a boy from Colombia trying to be successful to support his family.

All in all, I just loved it.  If you're interested in dance, I highly recommend this movie.",1355011200,,1220,5.0

Especially inspiring is the story of the incredibly talented Joan Sebastian Zamora of Columbia and modest means studying in the US and eventually to the Royal Ballet School.  He is exquisite.  He is masculine, athletic, graceful, and near perfect in form and movement.  His jumps are incredible and his line is truly artistic.  He is a danseur to follow.  If you want to learn or learn more about ballet or love ballet now, the is a wonderful demonstration of the art form and the elements of learning the language of dance.

5114758,5,B007Y6CTSY,"This is a wonderful DVD to watch for all those that have budding boys and girls who are interested in the world of  Ballet as it depicts the trials and tribulations of young people from 9 to 19 trying their best to take place in the annual Youth America Grand Prix Competition where successful entrants get awarded scholarships with world leading Ballet companies.

For those who don't know what the title of FIRST POSITION means, it is the first steps that young ballet dancers have to learn to get them started in their possible future careers.  I was lucky and privileged enough to work for the Sydney Opera House before it opened in 1973 and I spent nearly 30 years of my life enjoying and learning the world of artistic talents in all fields.

 My main love of all was ballet, as it is so extremely emotional, colourful and exciting to watch and so I was in seventh heaven, so to speak, for most of my life working as an usherette, witnessing so very many wonderful Ballets and watching visiting world class guest artists  such as Margot Fonteyn, Rudolf Nureyev and Carla Fracci as an example, performing leading roles with The Australian Ballet Company.  It was a great learning adventure for me as I got to know most of our own leading artists who also had the opportunity in becoming visiting artists to many foreign companies thus allowing them to gain elite experiences that they brought back to the Australian Ballet and made it a Ballet company, that can and now does, compete in reputation with the rest of the world. As they are a travelling company, they have thrilled American, Japanese and French and a few other foreign country audiences in past years.  They have also contributed in attaining positions as Artistic Directors of overseas companies as well, so we are all very proud of our company considering that they have just celebrated their 50 years young in existence.

Whilst watching FIRST POSITION I was in awe of how many talented young people there are in the world coming to prominence.  In this DVD they highlight 6 of the very best young people from all over the world and walks of life that will make their mark at the end of their scholarships, particularly one, a young lad of 16 from Colombia whose family comes from meagre means, who was chosen by our own Gaileen Stock, who not only was a world class ballerina but was also one of the judges who awarded him the scholarship to dance with the Royal Ballet.

These boys and girls have truly chosen one of the most gruelling and difficult professions in life that lies ahead for them and also a very glamorous and very rewarding one, but short lived, as they can only dance till they reach the age of maybe 35, but of course there are exceptions who danced way past that age, such as the great Margot Fonteyn and Rudolf Nureyev who became the world's best dancing couples of their time.  A ballet dancer's normal day starts very early in the morning approximately 8.30 am with classes, followed by rehearsals and then comes the actual performance which finishes most nights at approximately 10.30 pm with extra performances for matinees.

I thoroughly enjoyed this DVD and the thrilling performances by the 6 winners, and so I do recommend it for all the Ballet enthusiasts of the world and for their children, to watch and witness the enthusiasm, devotion and the blood, sweat and tears that one must devote one's life, to reach the heights of such ambition.

I felt every single emotion every one of these dancers did because we have all been there at some point. It was amazing to see such a beautiful documentary that showed the ups and downs of the dance world and just how cut throat it is. On the other hand I fully believe that even if you're not a dancer or know anything of the dance world this would still be a great film that anyone could enjoy.

5114767,5,B007Y6CTSY,I have to say that I enjoyed watching First Position because it focused on several people who had dreams of becoming a professional ballet dancer from elementary age to high school age.  It took the viewer into the lives of the people they focused on which I really appreciated.  You got a chance to really know the characters personally.

5114771,5,B007Y6CTSY,"This is a fantastic family movie (whether you like ballet or not) and provides a glimpse into the behind the scenes world of ballet.  Speaking from personal experience, with a daughter who has competed at high levels in this competition for years, I congratulate Bess for her accurate and fair portrayal.  While mainstream movies like ""Black Swan"" or reality shows like ""Dance Moms"" can create a bad impression and do more harm than good, this movie shows the dedication, drive, talent, persistence and real struggles and joys of young dancers trying to reach elite levels in their sport/art.

To survive the physical and emotional challenges of this sport, dancers must have internal passion and drive--character traits they will carry with them through life.  While there are ""obnoxious"" parents on the sidelines of every sport, more often than not, ballet parents are reasonable folks just doing what they need to do to help support their children's dreams.  When you have a child that devoted and passionate about something, whether it is baseball, skateboarding, math or ballet, it is hard not to get involved and want to do what ever it takes to facilitate their progress.  I think that comes across in this film.  (Unlike the ridiculousness you see on a show like ""Dance Moms"" or a film like Black Swan).

Ballet has been an international art form for over 300 years.  I am thrilled to finally see a film that shows an inspiring portrayal of journey from the perspective of emerging young artists.  Kudos to Bess, YAGP and the young dancers pursuing their dreams!  This is a film that everyone can enjoy!",1352937600,5,1611,4.907749077490775

5114775,4,B007Y6CTSY,"""First Position"" follows six young ballet dancers as they prepare for and compete in the semifinals and finals of the Youth America Grand Prix, a competition held in New York for dancers aged 9-19, where they compete for scholarships to elite ballet schools and, in the case of the older dancers, for contracts with dance companies. Director Bess Kargman has a ballet background, having once attended the Boston Ballet School. She and her crew meet the young dancers and their families on four continents to find out how they prepare and what the life of an ambitious career-minded young ballet dancer is like. Of course, we get to see them dance too.

The dancers who share their experiences are: 11-year-old Aran, son of an American naval physician living in Italy; 14-year-old Michaela, orphaned in Sierra Leone as a small child and adopted by an American family; 17-year-old high school senior Rebecca, who hopes to win a position in a ballet company; 16-year-old Joan Sebastian, a young man from Columbia who was training in New York; and Miko and Jules, 12 and 10-year-old sister and brother from California. Three male and three female dancers, one black, one Latino, two half-Japanese, some home-schooled, some public-schooled. The director may have deliberately chosen a diverse group here, but they are all talented, some exceptionally so.

5,000 dancers enter the semi-finals of the Youth America Grand Prix every year, and 300 advance to the finals. We see abridged versions of these 6 dancers' performances, as well as that of a talented young friend of Aran's, Gaya from Israel. (Full footage of the performances are available as bonus features on the DVD.) Kargan also takes care to show the audience the realities of a young dancer's life: the tremendous financial cost to their families, the constant pain and frequent injuries, and the fact that dancers eat a lot. They burn calories like any other athlete in training, and they have to have high energy. ""First Position"" also creates suspense -who will win, what will they get? This is a nicely rounded look at young ballet dancers with great ambition and talent.

The DVD (MPI 2012): There are ""Full-length Performances"" of the dances we see in the film, organized into Contemporary (7 dances, 20 min), Classical (7 dances), Additional Performances (6 dances, 11  min) that weren't in the film, and Competitors from Around the World (11 min), which are brief clips of many dancers. ""Training and Rehearsal"" goes into the studio with 5 dancers and their teachers and classmates. There is a trailer (2 min) and a teaser (1 min). And there is an audio commentary with director Bess Kargman, in which she talks about the score, the people -the dancers and their teachers, comments on the stories they tell, why she included what she did, and her choices about framing and reveals. Subtitles are available for the film in English SDH and Spanish.",1351814400,12,2911,4.971252566735113

5114777,2,B007Y6CTSY,"I recently saw First Position in a theater and came away with mixed feelings. It has its lovely, uplifting moments, and is as good a documentary as can be found on a ballet competition. (This documents the saga of several competitors as they prepare for and compete in the annual Youth America Grand Prix.) Some of the photography is stunning. However, watch with a few grains of salt, as a lot of the 'plot' is contrived. For example, the documentary presents young Aran Bell as just one of the 100s of dancers in a competition when, in fact, the lad won the grand prize the year BEFORE this film was made.  Also, we are not told what the ballet world knew months ago, before the film aired:  that the film's director has long been a personal acquaintance of the Youth America Grand Prix founders and owners. So there is more than a heaping dose of 'phony' here. It's a shame that the film-makers didn't just let nature take its course.",1347926400,23,937,4.5058823529411764

I was amazed watching this film on gifted young ballet stars as hundreds compete for a handful selected for contracts and scholarships. The discipline and the passion portrayed by the dancers is Remarkable, trying their best to show perfection. Mesmerizing, Enjoyable, and Entertaining throughout. At times, it was like watching the young lady who performed in Flashdance, where every move was being watched and tested, Breathtaking and Highly Recommended!",1344556800,14,730,5.6454545454545455

I loved all the kids but especually Aran and Michaela. Aran because he's 11 years old and incredible. Michaela because she's so beautiful and already has seen more suffering by age 14 than most of us have to endure in our entire lives. I fervently hope to see her perform one day.

It was a hit with all of us, and only myself and one of my daughters actually likes ballet. It centers on several aspiring young dancers, ages 9-17, all of whom are training to compete in the most important world ballet competition, at which many scholarships and company positions are offered annually. It's a make-or-break situation for all of these dancers, who have sacrificed their childhoods in pursuit of their art, and a career in it. The dancers profiled include an adopted orphan from wartorn Sierra Leone, a teen Colombian boy who would be the first from his country to gain entry into a major ballet company, and many others, each with compelling personal dramas. Although the dancing is superb, it's the personal stories that keep you engaged, and this film does a great job of telling them.",1342569600,16,893,4.694267515923567

Not only do you get to see what a world wide competition is like for these kids (they are aged 11-17), but it is also a great combination of personal stories that have you rooting for the dancers.

I think the personal aspect of it is really what makes this a great film, even if you have no interest in dancing, it is easy to relate to people who have a dream and will do whatever it takes to make it a reality. I have a lot of respect for the dancers and all of their hard work. Their injuries rival those of professional sports players, but the joy they have and share for ballet really shines through.

5114788,5,B007Y6CTSY,"No one in our family has been especially drawn to ballet and yet we were totally immersed in this compelling documentary. First Position is one of those rare films which dancers probably won't want to miss and non- dancers could find surprisingly enjoyable. I'm surprised it hasn't received national attention and major press coverage- or has it and I somehow missed it?

The director of First Position offers a close- up and intimate portrait of a group of young dancers preparing to compete in an elite (and potentially life changing)  competition and wisely steps back and lets the dancers, their instructors, and parents reveal the details of their lives.

It is amazing that some have even had the opportunity to dance. Michaela was adopted from Sierra Leone, miraculously beating the odds to come to America. Joan Sebastian only sees his parents a few times a year because he has to live in New York instead of Columbia to pursue his dreams. One girl is home schooled so there is more time for dance class, a life which seems very isolated but she is so passionate about ballet that she doesn't appear to mind.

Until watching this film, I had no idea that ballet could cause so many injuries. Pain is taken for granted.  I winced when I saw the blackened toenails, cuts and bruises which were revealed as the ballet shoes were removed.

It was a brilliant decision to reveal the daily lives of these dancers and to ramp up the suspense and reveal unexpected challenges as the competition drew near.

I loved it.  It captured perfectly the sacrifice from the dancers and their family.  The documentary is well put together so that even my husband was watching it with interest.  I envy the talent and the flexibility.  It really captured the difficulty of perfectly executing movement.  Enjoyable for all.  Wonderful documentary.",1509235200,,498,5.061728395061729
