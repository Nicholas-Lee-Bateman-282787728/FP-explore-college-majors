4246255,5,B0041SI7A2,"From ""Fat Donna"" to the crooked cop on the take from the gambling syndicate, they're all here.

In case you're on the fence about purchasing, I wanted to echo those who rate the quality of the DVDs.  I've been enjoying this season on a large flat-screen.  The sound is clear and the color crisp.  They mastered this set onto DVD with care.  They're obviously better than my 10 year-old VHS copies made from TV Land.  But they also look better than I've ever remembered seeing them more recently off Antenna TV.  The wild 60s psychedelia colors are on full display.  The dialog and music sound clear on my sound system.

I can't attest to any edits but my copies seem to be fully intact.

One more thing about the video...between these discs and the TV I'm viewing them on, it's incredible to look the openings and the other outdoor shots.  It's a real time capsule to the era.  The video is sharp...signs and billboards are easily read.",1324425600,5,936,4.538922155688622
4246256,5,B0041SI7A2,This DVD set should be as good as the rest of the series was.  Fast shipping by dealer.  Plan to watch it over the winter when time permits...,1320710400,,142,4.035714285714286
4246257,5,B0041SI7A2,Great to watch the old shows again without commercial inturruptions. I think that Jack Webb went a bit overboard with the anti-drug campaign. Interesting to hop aboard the time machine.,1312243200,,185,5.2
4246258,5,B0041SI7A2,"The Dragnet franchise continues in the 3RD season as Friday & Gannon are on the case.
The extras are pretty good.
The officers deal with cases of Bigotry,young teens in trouble,extortion, homicides, fraud,Dirty Cops, a day in robbery division,Community Relations,Visit from the President Of USA to Los Angeles, a day in the life of a woman in the Police Academy to name a few.
The guest stars in season 3 are fantastic from Howard Hessman,Don Marshall, A young Jan Michael Vincent.

Well worth getting.",1305417600,3,502,4.976190476190476
4246259,2,B0041SI7A2,"My low rating is NOT a reflection upon this wonderful and outstanding series!!  Sgt. Friday should arrest the producers of this box set, send them to the CDC, put them into one of the CDC Prisoner uniforms, and leave them on the yard.  The quality of this DVD box set does not do this wonderful series justice.

I thought the first season box set was a joke coming on two disc that are double sided, but season three (the second box sex I examined) takes the cake!  While it comes on single sided disc, which allows for art work, the transfer is of low quality in the resolution for DVD / Blu-Ray and is providing washed out color in many places.  The worst, though, for our deaf citizens and those in a crowd (as I say the bar impaired) is the lack of sub-titles.  At least season one has sub-titles and has quality transfer.

The sub-titles exist for the series, as my local TV station has cut versions of these episodes with sub-titles.  One expects a DVD box set for a season to have the uncut and sub-titled episodes, after all not everyone has perfect hearing or is in a quiet situation.

I give the series 5 stars and this DVD box set .5 stars for an overall rating of 2 stars.

The ONLY reason to buy this DVD box set is because you're a Dragnet fan and it is the only game in town.  Hopefully, once the series (as with Twelve O'Clock High) goes into the public domain, someone will do a better version of season 3.",1296864000,7,1423,4.272388059701493
4246260,4,B0041SI7A2,"Dragnet 1969 is the third and next to last season of the classic from Jack Webb.  The episodes are in great shape, but no anamorphic if you are interested.  They keep the initial aspect ratio of the series.  The extras are a bit slim.  I don't know if Harry Morgan would be able, but he is still alive and a commentary would be very interesting.  The menus are fine, easily manageable.  All in all, Shout makes it worth your money and worth picking up if you are interested in it.",1294617600,2,480,4.277777777777778
4246261,1,B0041SI7A2,"When Shout Factory released Dragnet 1968, for some reason they decided to trim off the first 3 minutes of the Pilot Dragnet movie. For the release of Dragnet 1969, the scissors are back out for more trims.

The episode ""Narcotics- DR-16"" clocks in at 20:10. The opening has Jack Webb do a short ""This is the City, I carry a Badge"" and goes straight to the opening titles.
In the original, Jack talks about Century City, the Bunker Hill developent and a look at some of the Performing Theatres in L.A. I don't know what else is missing from the episode, but there's over 4 minutes missing.
The episode is suppose to run 25:30.

The episode ""The Joy Riders"" is only 24:30. This episode was originally suppose to be the final episode of the previous season, but was pre empted due to the assassination of Martin Luthor King. It finally aired during Season 3, but why is it only 24:30? All of the other Season 2 episodes run between 25:00 and 25:30.

I don't understand why Shout continues to release edited Dragnet DVDs, but I think they're doing a poor job.",1293580800,36,1055,4.513089005235602
4246262,5,B0041SI7A2,"Since SHOUT took over the dvd production of Dragnet, the quality has been GREAT! Like Dragnet 1968 SHOUT has placed bonus material on one of the disks. For this version disk 1 has a rare 1954 Dragnet episode (I forgot the name not being at home as I write this), two Jack Web PSA announcements on Social Security along with Muscular Distrophy and a promo for Dragnet 1969. The quality of these bonus features are not restored. The rest of the disks look great and has the same selection format as Dragnet 1968. For the price this is a worth the purchase and a nice way to finish off the Dragnet series. The 69 Dragnet has quite a few episodes on Juvenile cases and if you are as old as I am you, know the bright colors used on clothes and household items at that time. Often I judge the quality of the dvd processing by the crispness of bright colors and the luminance transition from bright to dark. The dvd's are beautiful. There is very little color smear and the colors tend to be slightly warm. The fourth dvd when the Gannons drop by Friday's apartment for dinner is a good example of this. Bill Gannon's wife Rita is wearing a yellow-green suit, notice how crisp the colors are and when the neighbors drop by the apartment for a party (toward the end) notice all the different colors and see how they track (no smearing or fading). SHOUT did a nice job. THANK YOU!!!!!",1292198400,17,1375,4.396078431372549
4246263,5,B0041SI7A2,"What a wonderful & classic TV police drama this show was!  I already owned Dragnet 1967 (Season One), and preordered Dragnet 1968 (Season Two) -- it was incredible, as will be Season Three.  And I will be ordering Season Four as well when it is released on DVD, completing the 4-season set of Dragnet episodes.  All 98 episodes of Dragnet, seasons 1-4 (1967-1970) are in color!  The episodes themselves are fun to watch, even to watch over and over.  Jack Webb (Sergeant Joe Friday) simply defines the role, and his sidekick (Officer Bill Gannon) played by Harry Morgan was terrific, too.  Shout! Factory did just a first-class job on the production of the Dragnet 1968 DVD set, they set the standard, in my opinion -- and they went the extra mile on the bonus extras they included in Season Two, and I'm sure will try to again in Season Three.

4246309,4,B0041SI7A2,"LAPD's finest investigators, Sgt. Joe Friday (Jack Webb) and his faithful partner, Det. Bill Gannon (Harry Morgan) return for this 1968-69 Season of this classic police drama from the mind of Jack Webb.

It is just another day in Los Angeles.: smog, traffic and unceasing crime. But no matter the day, duty calls for Friday and Gannon. From dealing with burglars, runaways and druggies to representing the LAPD on an L.A. talk show and working with the secret service to prep for a visit from the President of the United States, you know these homicide dicks will have it handled. Ladies and gentlemen, the stories you are about to see are true. Only the names have been changed to protect the innocent. This is DRAGNET 1969.

Spawned from the popular DRAGNET radio program, followed by the acclaimed 1950s television series, DRAGNET which ran on NBC from 1967-1970 featured Jack Webbs chief creation in its prime: opening the door for his later hit shows like DRAGNET's spin-off series ADAM-12 and EMERGENCY contributing to veteran Officer Pete Malloy(Martin Milner)and his hotshot rookie partner Jim Reed(Kent McCord)LAPD's finest patrolmen and L.A. County Firemen Johnny Gage(Randolph Mantooth)& Roy De Soto(Kevin Tighe)L.A. County's finest paramedics.

In fact, this season even has a cast-colliding episode when Reed & Malloy meet up with Friday & Gannon for the very first time in the ""Internal Affairs-DR 20"" episode.

Watching this Junior year season of DRAGNET complete & uncut on these DVD box sets is so much better than watching them in reruns on COZI-TV, ME-TV, Antenna TV, TV Land, and Nickelodeon, with all those deleted scenes & added commercials.

BTW, Warner Bros.is releasing CHiPs- Season 3 out on DVD on Tuesday March 3, 2015.",1389657600,,1747,5.094405594405594

4246312,4,B0041SI7A2,I liked it back in 1969 and still do today. I realize that the stars reflect more what the Chief and the PD administration think a good detective should look/act like but it is not reality. As a retired police officer I know what the reality is - but the show was still fun to watch. Jack Webb did a good job for the times. It's amazing how much progress has occurred in the past 30+ years. Back then a detective had to fish a dime out of his pocket (not reimbursed) to call headquarters. I remember the first squad I drove had the radio transmitter in the trunk and a whip antenna on the rear fender - by the end of my career we were using laptops and cells phones.,1375920000,,666,4.091603053435114

4246316,4,B0041SI7A2,"I've owned Season 1 since it was released, wanted to buy Season 2, but it was sold out, so I bought Season 3.

I'm a huge Dragnet fan but this season had too many ""Community Relations,"" ""Public Affairs,"" ""Training,"" and ""Management Services"" types of stories that had nothing to do with solving crimes and more to do with portraying the LAPD in a positive light. They're well done but just not as cool as crime stories, and you can't really watch them over and over because they're undramatic. In fact one of the best episodes of the season was actually a hold over from Season 2 - ""The Joy Riders"" - which was cancelled due to the assasination of MLK (an event that gets its own ""Management Services"" episode in Season 3 - which I wish I could say is great, rather one of the duller  shows of the lot).

After I had watched the whole season, I went back to my dvds of Season 1 and they were much more dynamic and visually more interesting than Season 3.

Lyn Murray's score for the first two seasons was fantastic. There was a unique score, in a completely different style, for almost every episode. For the second half of the series, the music was by Frank Comstock. I'm just not really fond of it, and it seems to make some of the episodes drag.

There are some great episodes in Season 3, though. ""Calvin Lampe"" with Bert Mustin, the sad child abuse episode, the cute episode where Joe has Eileen and Bill Gannon over for dinner. This is also the season where the baby is found in the trash can. But most of the episodes people fondly remember don't seem to be from this season.

The sound is generally excellent. The visuals? Some episodes look great while others don't. I thought the picture quality of the Universal release was superior. It's sharper and there seems to be more depth; the color is better, and there are fewer spots and scratches.

But very glad to have these seasons out on DVD at last. Shout Factory has packaged them well, they're easy to use, and there are nice extras like a 1950's B&W episode with good picture and sound, a Jack Webb PSA, some TV ads, etc.",1366243200,3,2085,4.4140625

I have all of the DVDs for this show, color and black and white. That being said, this is not the glory year of the series. In fact, I would say Disc 1 is almost completely forgettable. The major problem is that instead of being a crime drama, it is almost just a public relations reel for the LAPD. There are no enthralling cases, just us learning about how fair and hardworking the LAPD are. It is almost like you are watching training videos for public relations class, mixed with some establishment propoganda. The show does pick up after Disc 1, thankfully.

8413125,5,B0041SI7A2,Video quality is very good and so is the audio.  Music is a little loud compared to dialogue but that isn't unique to this show.  Highly recommend!  Only wish it had subtitles.,1512172800,,176,4.4375

8413133,5,B0041SI7A2,"Dragnet started out as a go for broke, radio show, Webb had nothing to lose,since no one was paying for it! he and his Mexican American partner (in the show, Yarborough was playing a Mexican American,and even here the role was played straight,no stereotype),shows about rape/murder of little girls, ripper murders etc...that could never be made for most movies,let alone .the original crimes can be found as photos in the book ""death scenes"" ,such as the murder of the mother by the girl in""the big canarys"",but  the black and white tv series is apparently lost ,even though it is public domain, doesn't matter much, the  series survives, and the b and w were mostly remakes of the  scripts. the radio series Dragnet is the BEST series!! no question about it, but the 60's were where political correctness took over,
no more rape/murder, very little graphics aloud,clamp Down to excess, these shows are remarkable that they still are enjoyable,despite being shut down on any thing real, still Webb manages to explain that the father sewed his childs penis shut with red thread ,because he wet the bed, and the terror a child goes through with child abuse( im glad my mother wasn't a Dragnet fan ,i wet the bed to ,and this could have given her ideas) Webb was about the only one on tv talking about child abuse, its amusing to think he is looked on as a consecutive, when he was a Roosevelt, Johnson Democrat, how times change! i look at this as filling in the blanks for the radio series.put it together and police life falls into place!",1484784000,,1538,4.688888888888889
