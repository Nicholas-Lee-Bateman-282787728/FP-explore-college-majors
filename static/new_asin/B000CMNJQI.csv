8099244,5,B000CMNJQI,"I watched Julie's other video, Organizing From the Inside Out first, loved it and so it was natural for me to purchase her video on Time Management from the Inside Out. I was not disappointed. Again, Julie puts the overwhelming task of managing time in a way that one can understand and easily implement. I highly recommend this video for anyone struggling with time management.",1364083200,,378,4.8307692307692305
8099245,3,B000CMNJQI,"This is geared to time management for your personal life - not really helpful for the business environment, which was my focus. Also, since it ""breaks for commercials"" as in a regular ""made-for-TV production"", it wouldn't be as conducive to use in a training session. The content is great but not what I was looking for.",1356480000,,320,4.732142857142857
8099246,5,B000CMNJQI,I have read this book and watched Julie Morgenstern on PBS. She is truly an inspiration and has saved me countless hours. Many people ask me how everything gets done. Read this book and you will find out :),1291420800,,206,4.3076923076923075
8099247,1,B000CMNJQI,This is poorly done video and is a waste of time to watch.  Don't spend your money on this.  It's hard to watch and harder to listen to the speaker.  We were VERY disappointed with this!,1282089600,,186,4.111111111111111
8099248,5,B000CMNJQI,"I used this edition, along with other material, as an adjunct professor to teach a course in  Time and Stress Management. The information is right on track. Use it and make the most of your time, efforts and direction. I think every new college student and everyone else could benefit from the information.",1269302400,,306,4.773584905660377
8099249,5,B000CMNJQI,"This book has been a wonderful help. With so many things on my plate and so many hats to wear, I often struggle to get the important things done. I have now learned to make my ""style"" and personality work at full speed.",1245974400,,219,4.116279069767442
8099250,5,B000CMNJQI,"Julie Morgenstern has a way of making an often over-complicated subject accessible and easy to understand. I have implemented her ideas, and I'm getting WAY more productivity out of my day than I used to - on the things that really matter to me! If you consider yourself ""time challenged"", do yourself a favor and pick up this great DVD. There is also a book by the same name/author.",1221350400,2,383,4.565217391304348
8099251,5,B000CMNJQI,"I needed a video to support my lecture on Time Management in a hurry.  I basically bought this sight unseen, knowing little about the series and presenter.  In the first 5 minutes I thought I bought something too soft, but then it did a complete turnaround and captivated all 30 of my students.
Gaining the interest of 1st and 2nd year college students is not always the easiest thing to do.  I was surprised, however, at how many stopped and made positive comments on the way out the door.  I would definitely recommend this video to anyone wanting to learn more about managing their time and life.",1192579200,7,599,4.570093457943925
8099252,4,B000CMNJQI,"This was a great video that gave 7 keys to Time Management.  They are helpful in their own right, but because the video is only 60 minutes long it doesn't go into much detail as to how.  Because I have read 2 books of hers the information was more of a ""oh yeah, that's right"" to me, instead of a brand new idea.

That being said, it's great because she does indeed pack a lot of subpoints into an hour under the main 7 keys.  Also, there is a 30 minute Q & A time under the main menu where she interacts with the PBS audience.  So really the DVD is more like 90 minutes.  She doesn't give many visuals, so I can multitask while she's talking (a big no-no to her).

All in all, a good reminder video. I wouldn't pay more than $10.  I would buy a book, however, because there is much more information there.",1158710400,20,806,4.056962025316456
