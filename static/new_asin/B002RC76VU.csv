8378666,5,B002RC76VU,"have Carol's peyote dvd, wanted to learn herringbone stitch as well. Carol does a thorough job teaching herringbone, and as with the other dvd, there are patterns to stitch along with her, or create jewelry later--great dvd!",1310688000,,224,5.081081081081081
8378667,5,B002RC76VU,"All I can say is that this is one of the best herringbone stitch vids I've seen.  I don't think Carol left anything out.  As a matter of fact, I discovered I was ending my rows wrong (turning).  Should have put my turns on the horizontal stitch instead of the vertical (no wonder my herringbone projects were loose). Wow, glad I have this in reference library now.

Need to add, this version does include the instruction sheet, so no worries on that.  Only negative is that the seller marked the dvd up 50%.  Aside from that, I give the dvd five stars (if I could give more to the author I would).",1301443200,,597,4.285714285714286
8378668,4,B002RC76VU,"I have the VHS version. It was supposed to come with an instructional insert, which was missing from my used copy, but I think you could get by without one. If you are new to seed beading, you should probably start with learning peyote, not herringbone, so this video would not be for you. I believe the instructor has another beadweaving technique video on peyote. If you do have some beadweaving experience and want to give herringbone a try, then this is a great video. This video covers the following:
1) Flat herringbone, including 4 different ways of turning at the end of the row (I had not realized there were 4 ways until watching this video).
2) Project: beaded ribbon bracelet, using flat herringbone
3) Increasing, including
3a) increasing on the outer edge
3b) increasing between columns
3c) increasing within a column
4) Project: fan bracelet, using increasing techniques
5) Decreasing. I found this section of the video to be a bit confusing, but hey with a video you can always hit re-wind. Still, I wish she would have reviewed the technique by showing you the bead path on an enlarged drawing, as she did for many of the other techniques. Maybe the insert I was missing had nice drawings of the decreasing techniques! If you find you need further instruction here, I would suggest Vicki Star's book ""Beading with Herringbone Stitch"", which is a good intro-level book on Herringbone.
6) Tubular herringbone and twisted tubular herringbone variations
7) Project: mini sea-urchin basket, using tubular herringbone, increasing and decreasing techniques with seed and dagger beads.
Just one thing I would differ with the video, is that I would not glue my knots when tying off threads. Instead I would knot 3 or 4 times instead of 2.
At 111 minutes this is a pretty extensive video. I've noticed a DVD version of this video here on Amazon so if you prefer that format.",1281744000,2,1881,4.808641975308642
