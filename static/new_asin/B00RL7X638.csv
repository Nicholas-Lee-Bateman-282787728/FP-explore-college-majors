8695493,5,B00RL7X638,"A very powerful story of two lovers who are trying to escape the repressive system of servitude in the early 18th century Prussia. Miriam Stein and Volker Bruch deliver stunning performances in this film!
Miriam Stein and Volker Bruch portray Gisela Walther and with idealism and an energy that sweeps. Ulrike Folkerts and Walter Sittler as the Countess and Count of Rennitz provide insight into the upper class and manage to make their characters are not pure antagonists - but complex people who are also subject to social norms as their subordinates.
The authors Benjamin Hessler and Florian Oeller have developed a sharp and sophisticated writer from the bestselling novel by Iny Lorentz, which is both the historic truths as well as the entertainment potential of the story justice. Christoph Schrewe has teased out with its joyous and sensual staging both aspects of the story, and on Good Rennitz despite all obstacles with an all star cast and an elaborate costume and production design made the world to one that has its charms.",1445126400,,1037,5.0
