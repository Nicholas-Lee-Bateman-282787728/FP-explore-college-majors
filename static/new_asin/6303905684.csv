8019975,5,6303905684,"Springtime in the Rockies, 1937 film

The film begins in the country where white-faced cattle are in a herd. A rider brings news to the ranchers (small businesses). Sheep are coming to the valley! Gene sings at the Knight Ranch. [Sheep crop the grass closely so there is nothing left for cattle.] That rancher promises to send the sheep back. Gene gets a letter from Chicago, there is a new owner. BAH? ""Aren't they sweet?"" A man offers to sell those sheep to Miss Sandra Knight; she's so smart. Gene pulls a trick and directs them to an old shack instead of the true Knight ranch. Bathing in the creek? Only six miles away. [How can they live without a well?] Wolves and coyotes? ""Don't bother the snakes and they won't bother you."" Other comic scenes follow.

Then its time for another song. A rider tells about the sheep, like a Paul Revere. There is conflict over these sheep. One rancher has a scheme to take advantage of the hoax by buying valuable property cheap. Hoof and mouth disease? Or another hoax? Is Mr. Briggs ""a swell guy""? There is a ""Pioneer Days"" celebration. Another song and dance, with comedy. Gene sings again. Then a deadly fight is arranged, and Gene is arrested. Smiley is suspected too. One man arouses the crowd against Gene. There is a jailbreak to save Gene and the ranch. Will Sandra sign over her ranch? Can Gene void the sale? Will the posse get Gene? Morgan recovered, and clears Gene of the shooting. Gene voids the sale. There will be a happy ending. That famous ballad is sung again.

This has a clever and complex story for a western. It covers many topics in its hour. The moral is that a lie or hoax can have unintended consequences and cause great harm. There can be a happy ending in a movie, but real life is often different.",1276128000,,1769,4.487577639751553

8019978,2,6303905684,"This VHS issue is a poor quality issue in long play mode. The long play issue uses 2/3 less tape, but greatly reduces the quality of the transfer. I do not understand why this is done. The manufacturing savings in using less tape can be only a few cents. The tape runs 52 minutes in black and white, not color as indicated by Amazon.

8019979,5,6303905684,"This movie is one of ""Americas Favorite Singing Cowboys"" earlier pictures. Produced in 1937 and showing the great potential of this cowboy star. Along with the comedy of Smiley Burnette, Gene tries to convince a young heiress played by Polly Rowles that ranching is not for her when upon arrival she implements the use of modern animal husbandry. Gene uses trickery and red paint to persuade the young lady that her sheep are sick in hopes of sending her packing!! After all, this was cattle country and sheep were not welcome. Upon falling somewhat under the magic spell of this young lady decides that she's not so bad after all....In turn saves the ranch and the pretty young lady from all of her cattlemen neighbors intent on running her out of business and back to the east. Great story lines and a role well played by the Cowboy in the White Hat!! Great songs like ""The Moon and I"" and the famous ""You're the Only Star in My Blue Heaven."" Watch this movie for a look and listen to the melodious voice of the Mr. Gene Autry, Americas Favorite Singing Cowboy!!!!",1093824000,2,1066,4.5863874345549736
