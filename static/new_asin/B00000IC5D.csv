1219726,5,B00000IC5D,"This video is excellent for teaching the story of Peter and the Wolf to young children and learning how the instruments involved set the mood for this lovely short film.  Kirstie Alley and Lloyd Bridges do a sweet job playing father and daughter and the music is terrific.  Includes a short portion at the end showing how the flute is used to create Peter's personality, the french horns create the Wolf's, the clarinet for the cat, etc.  Nicely done.  This is partly animated.",1100822400,8,477,4.710843373493976

1219948,1,B00000IC5D,"Yikes!  I bought this video for my elementary music classroom, for when I have a substitute teacher.  Well, luckily I finally had a situation where I had over 50 students for a class period, and I decided to watch the video with them.  I am so glad that I got to watch it because it is horrible and I will NEVER show it again!

It has really dated animation.  There are sound effects and talking over all of Prokofiev's music (like it's just background noise).  It has a terrible, live-action story that takes up almost half of the running time (and has nothing to do with the story of Peter and the Wolf).

I watched it with 2nd grade.  It's probably too scary for kinders or first graders.  (The wolf eats the duck!  And you don't find out until much later that the duck is alive.)  (Yes, I know that's part of the story, but for kinders and first graders, it's WAY too scary.)

I would not recommend this version for anyone!  It was made in the 90s, but the animation looks like it's from the 60s.",1398729600,2,1000,4.283422459893048

1219953,5,B00000IC5D,Great rendition of a childhood classic. There are even extra features on the dvd to teach students about the themes and the instruments of the orchestra. 49 minutes long. The first 12 minutes or so are live action (real actors) and then it switches over to cartoon animation as Kirstie Alley narrates the story line.,1386028800,,316,4.763636363636364
1219954,5,B00000IC5D,A much better version than the first one I ordered.  It was more appropriate for my students.  We only watched the animated parts.,1384387200,,130,4.608695652173913

This one has Kirstie Alley and two other actors playing a grandfather and mother telling the story of ""Peter"" to their grandson/son.  The actual story part is animated.  Because I have limited time with my music class, I chose to start it right where the animated part begins.  It's cute and the elementary aged kids love the animated characters.  There's also a nice introduction to the instruments of the orchestra in the special features.  It includes a narrator talking about Prokofiev and the families of instruments introduced through this work.  Pre-teen/ teen aged children play examples on those instruments for a close-up look and a nice, isolated sound for each instrument.",1382659200,4,839,5.036231884057971

1220020,5,B00000IC5D,"I'm a music teacher, and use this video every year with 1st grade to teach instruments of the orchestra. It's a great story with Prokofiev's beautiful music. The dvd has some awesome features on it too, furthur explaining the instruments. The intro and ending to the main movie are kind of tedious and unnecessary though (the non-animated parts with Kirstie Alley), so I usually just skip over them.",1364169600,,399,4.882352941176471
1220021,5,B00000IC5D,My Grandchildren love listening to the beautiful music of Peter and the Wolf.

1220104,5,B00000IC5D,"""Peter and the Wolf"" is a great way to present Prokofiev's music, and indeed classical music to children.  My grandchildren love it, and watch it over and over again.  I have bought 3 copies, one to have at home, and the other 2 for them to have at home. A big plus is the interactive Music Game which teaches children which instruments are playing each theme.  This version of the classic is the most entertaining and educational I have seen.",1352764800,,443,4.5125

1220107,5,B00000IC5D,This version of Peter and the Wolf is the one I grew up knowing. The kids are about to watch it for the first time tonight. I'm so excited. I hope they love it as much as I have. It's a terrific rendition.,1327017600,,205,3.7906976744186047
1220108,3,B00000IC5D,I got this for my 3 year twin granddaughters and although they like it I was disappointed.  I always remember Peter and the Wolf beginning by linking the different instruments to the characters and the cd does that but not this dvd.  That was important to me as I loved that aspect of the vinyl record and book I had when I was younger.  I am glad the cd and book combination follows that path.,1320883200,13,394,4.226666666666667
1220109,2,B00000IC5D,"Yuck.  The story in which the animation is embedded is schmaltzy, and the acting is clunky.  And-- this very Russian tale is set in *Switzerland*?!

If you know Peter and the Wolf, you know it teaches you that the cat is an oboe, the duck a clarinet, etc.  Not here.  Wiped clean of such old-fashioned detail.

Dumbed down.  Not worthy.  The Emmy award?  They must have thought endorsing Prokofiev would make them look sophisticated.

Stick with an audio-recording.",1312675200,,465,4.846153846153846

1220111,5,B00000IC5D,"I used this video after a 1st grade unit on Peter and the Wolf and instrumentation.

1220112,5,B00000IC5D,"Of the many Peter and the Wolf versions on DVD, this was a simple and effective presentation of the music and the story.  The DVD combined animation and actors that kept our 2-year old completely engaged but we enjoyed it too. It is a favorite DVD and he hums the music all the time.",1270425600,,283,4.2407407407407405
1220165,4,B00000IC5D,"My grandfather taped this film when I was a child (around 1996) when it showed on a local television station. I remember watching it and ""Race for Your Life Charlie Brown"" over and over again.

Recently I purchased the film from Amazon.com. After re-watching it again as a 19 year-old, it still kept my interest relatively well. While the ""plot"" is quite childish and no longer very interesting, the music still intrigues me - how each character has its own 'theme' played by a different instrument (or different instruments).

Now, I have not viewed other versions of ""Peter and the Wolf,"" and therefore, I do not know whether they are better than this version or not. However, I think this film should interest a young child who enjoys music and/or action cartoons (since most of the film is cartoon - only slightly live-action at the beginning and end).",1242518400,,856,4.777027027027027

My only frustration is that the dialogue obscures many of the musical themes.  However, the feature at the end of the story - ""The Musical World of..."" makes up for this somewhat.  I frequently show that section first.

In addition, the DVD has a ""game"" on matching various animals with instruments which is extremely good for K thru 2nd.

1220174,5,B00000IC5D,This DVD was well worth the less than $10 I paid for it. I am using it at school and my students have been mesmerized.  The extra features are an added bonus - an introduction to instruments of the orchestra and the cutest game!  There are 25 different combinations in the game in which you can match an instrument sound with an animal. This DVD is a fresh approach to a classic story!,1192665600,3,385,4.260273972602739

1220256,5,B00000IC5D,"I was surprised to read the other review, because I recently bought the

re-released DVD reissue of this ""Peter and The Wolf"" for my 6 year-old

grandson, and not only did he love it, but so did I!! I am a

professional violinist and music educator, and know this score inside

and out. The previous reviewer who said the producers had changed Prokofiev's music is dead wrong -- it is note for note perfect, and in addition, is beautifully played. (It was actually Disney's version that was cut!!)

The characters in Chuck Jones version, designed by Mr. Jones, are

delightful -- and not just a recycling of his Warner Bros., ensemble.

The animated tale, which is the centerpiece of this production, and

where Prokofiev's score plays out in entirety, is magical. And Kirstie

Alley's narration is full of life and spirit -- really fantastic. I

also loved Lloyd Bridges as the grandfather, and young Ross Malinger as

both the live action and animated Peter. The live action parts were

magical, and gave some real-life relevance to the animated story, and

the ending was enchanting. It brought a tear to my eye. Ross Malinger

was endearing in ""Sleepless In Seattle,"" and he goes to the next step

here. And his rapport with Lloyd Bridges seemed so very real. A

fantastic bonus to this production is an extraordinary ""Guide To The

Symphony Orchestra"" bonus feature at the end, which thoroughly explains

to the young viewer how Prokofiev used the musical instruments to

portray the various characters. And the producers wisely use YOUNG

teenage musicians to demonstrate the instruments, which really makes it

come to life for young viewers. I Googled for more information on this

production -- I can't figure out why it isn't more frequently seen. I

noticed it won the Emmy for Best Children's Program, as well as many

other Emmy nominations and awards. I also saw that the critics gave it

great reviews -- one from the Philadelphia daily newspaper called it

""The best children's television special ever."" So it is a mystery to me

why this production is not a television classic. But in the meantime,

do yourself a favor -- and for your children and grandchildren -- and

watch it!",1172361600,90,2197,4.815013404825737

Kirstie tells her son the story of Peter and the Wolf while the story is acted out by animated characters and the music plays in the background.  At the end of the VHS version, a mini-movie plays with host Julia Glander explaining orchestra seating, describing the different instruments that represent each animal and why the composer, Sergei Prokofiev, chose them.

Chuck Jones' characters made the animation accessible and familiar to my kids and held their attention, and I loved the fact that the musical references were subtly worked into the story.  Kirstie Alley's narration is so full of life and fun . . . she herself is obviously caught up in the story.  The animation is charming and magical, and the live action story touched me.  It was wonderful to see the charming Lloyd Bridges, and he brought to both Grandfathers (animated and live action) a touching, crusty, wonderful heartwarming glow.  The special Introduction To The Orchestra which followed was also fantastic, and offered a very creative, but non-scary, look at how a symphony orchestra works, and how the instruments lended their personalities to the story.  And of course, Prokofiev's music remains the biggest star of all, and is beautiful as always.  In this world full of violence, over-stimulation, and ""edgy"" entertainment for kids, this gentle, charming, simple tale -- so beautifully done -- was a breath of fresh air.  I wish there were more DVD's like it.  And my kids agreed.",1150761600,17,1218,4.845410628019324

With a wonderful orchestra,, marvellous narration and brilliant animation, Prokofiev's music has been brought to  vivid and wonderful life by the conductor, George Daugherty.  A special Hurrah for this important tribute to the genius of the late, great, Chuck Jones.",1150761600,3,401,5.435483870967742
1220344,5,B00000IC5D,"As a mother of four children and a school librarian, I am thrilled with Daugherty's ""Peter and the Wolf"" DVD.  The story is lively and the animation immediately capitvates a child's interest.  Daugherty's selection of actors and muscians is superb making this production an excellent opportunity to bring back an almost forgotten symphony and story.  An excellent buy for home or school collections.",1148342400,2,399,5.301587301587301
1220345,5,B00000IC5D,"As a kindergarten and elementary school teacher for 60 years, I have used various recordings of ""Peter and The Wolf"" in my classroom going back to 78's . . . it has always been, and still is, the perfect vehicle to foster a love of classical music in children.  They learn the instruments of the orchestra while on a fantastic flight of fancy and adventure.  I discovered this particular version about 10 years ago, and have worn out several videotapes.  I am delighted to find it now on DVD, with even more imaginative features and bonuses.  THe animated tale is wonderful, with Chuck Jones' delightful and looney characters.  And I especially love this version because The Duck lives! (Not to be a spoiler, but in other versions he does not.)  Kirstie Alley's narration is wonderful, and updates the traditional narrative while still paying tribute to the original.  And Lloyd Bridges and Ross Malinger are wonderful.  An incredible bonus with this production is the tremendously excellent video feature ""Guide To The Symphony Orchestra,"" featuring young children playing the instruments from ""Peter and The Wolf,"" and a behind-the-scenes look at how an orchestra comes together, how the instruments work, and how and why Prokofiev wrote his themes he way he did.  THere is also a great ""Making Of"" Documentary by Lloyd Bridges own grandson.  All in all, there is so much to this release . . . if only there were more like it.  And if only more filmmakers for children would go to this much care in sparking the imaginations of our children!  This version is a classic, and I have seen it captivate children over and over.",1147824000,33,1624,4.823104693140794
1220346,5,B00000IC5D,"This is a fantastic and highly imaginative rendition of an entertaining story, further enhanced by some of the best music ever written. Prokfiev's brilliant score, given center stage in a musically satisfiying performance, blends flawlessly with the incredible animation of the great master himself: Chuck Jones!  With the adept performances of the cast, one could hardly ask for anything more.  We've watched it repeatedly and enjoyed it immensely.",1147824000,9,449,5.588235294117647

It is a wonderful introduction to the classics ~ especially for children and families who have had little exposure to these gems. George Daugherty's love for Peter and the Wolf shows through and through in this magical piece of work. Lloyd Bridges is wonderful, and being one of Chuck Jones' last cartoons makes it truly a classic.",1147737600,3,406,4.814285714285714

1220349,5,B00000IC5D,"No one can top the late Chuck Jones for animation, and this work is one of his better pieces, up there with What's Opera Doc, and the other Warner Bros. classics.  Peter and the Wolf, masterfully presented here by Mr. Daugherty, is made for children, I think, and this presentation should charm any child experiencing it.  It certainly captured my nieces and nephews.",1147737600,3,367,4.809523809523809
1220350,5,B00000IC5D,"Peter and the Wolf has made many appearances in my life, as I have children who have loved it from their earliest ages.  I have also conducted it more than once myself and seen it performed by a woodwind quintet with props and by a brass choir with myself at the piano.  So I know it pretty well; it always pleases.

  The ABC Prime Time Special version is the most wonderful incarnation the piece has ever had on this planet.  Combining award-winning actors, producers, writers, director and conductor in a multi-media banquet, this production has it, says it, shows it, and inspires the little story in imaginative and creative ways that no other ever has or possibly could.

I would give it 10 stars out of a possible 5 and recommend it without the slightest reservation. It should be on the DVD shelf of every child.

1220351,1,B00000IC5D,"How can you take something so beautiful such as Sergei Prokofiev's music and make it unbearable?  Watch this movie and find out.  You'll see a horrible story line with unsympathetic characters try and create a narrative for the music.  The effect: disastrous.  Kirstie Alley's whinning narrative supercedes the music in most points.  The unimaginative child's remarks to his mother's, Kirstie Alley, narrative show that the writer's have no understanding of children or what to do with good music.  The only thing worse than the story line was the awful animation.  If you want a cheesy, poorly written and unimaginitive interpretation of some classical music you'll never hear during the movie than this is the movie for you; otherwise steer clear.",1141430400,10,749,5.191666666666666

7909814,3,B00000IC5D,"There are pros and cons to this version of Peter and the Wolf; really, it just depends on what's important to you.
Pros:
1. None of Prokofiev's music is cut, and the animators worked hard to associate each character with its instrument consistently. This is different from the Disney version, in which the music is cut, and some of the music is re-appropriated for different characters.
2. It does follow the story outlined in the original narration.
3. The animals are beautifully animated.

Cons:
1. The narration is excessive in my opinion and there are many added story elements. For example, the bird has a nest of eggs which hatch at the end of the story. The cat helps catch the wolf with the rope (similar to the 1946 Disney version). The Duck is coughed up near the end of the story. The Hunters make a cage for the wolf. These things won't matter to many people but they do matter to me.
2. There is a lot of dialogue that is cheesy and distracts from the music. For example, during grandfather's music, grandfather lectures Peter. And Peter talks to the duck and tells him he'll always look out for him at the end of the story.
3. There are live action sequences that pop up out of nowhere, are extremely dated and take you out of the story. Also cheesy. If you're using this in a music classroom and skipping over these parts, you'll never be able to completely avoid students seeing just a half second of a real kid with a mullet gazing out of the screen.

I'd be happy using this for preschoolers or at home with young kids, but I'm just not satisfied with it for the music classroom. I'd recommend the 2006 stop motion version any day-- it's gorgeous, the music is uncut, and it's completely narration and dialogue free. The only downside of the stop motion is that it has a couple of intense parts for young children (Peter's face gets scratched by the wolf, and the wolf swallowing the duck whole is not off-screen.)",1476921600,10,1933,4.504273504273504
