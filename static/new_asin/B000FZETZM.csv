2593378,5,B000FZETZM,"The pup that plays Shiloh is just adorable! I can imagine the vast temptations the actors must've had to constantly cuddle and squeeze this little dog all day. Shiloh is off on another adventure when his master attempts to solve a murder mystery in their small town. The gossip turns the suspicion toward Judd. Is it possible Judd is horrid enough to kill someone, or are the rumors about the recluse getting out of hand? Marty isn't convinced that his neighbor is guilty, despite Judd's past problems. The movie teaches some valuable lessons without being the least bit preachy. Very well written, and a great family film. I'm keeping a copy around for my future grandchildren.

2593380,5,B000FZETZM,"Saving Shiloh delivers suspense, heart, and top notch performances. Jason Dolley is a likable and believable Marty, plus his tomboy sister is a total crack-up. But it's Scott Wilson who makes the flic soar. Wilson makes Judd so despicable and sad at the same time; you are uncertain until the very last minute whether a man this horrid can be redeemed. Definitely not to be missed: Shiloh, the irresistible beagle, being interviewed in the Special Features section. Parents will like this one as much as their kids.

Younger kids may still enjoy it, but it really lost any adult audience appeal due mostly to poor acting and story line. The best parts of the movie were Shiloh, and the ending.",1387843200,,323,4.4

2593498,5,B000FZETZM,"First of all: 3 movies for $11.99 can't be beat. Secondly, Shilo is a beautiful movie all children should see and it's one they can watch over and over and over again. Teaching them kindness, values, and basically a down to earth wholesome movie you just don't see much anymore. Most kids will read the book in 4th grade and do all sorts of work with it. This is why we ordered it for our home. Our 4th grader and 2nd grader still talk about it, ask to watch it and tell what they learned. They will often say...""yeah b/c on  Shilo Marty said this or Marty did this. Marty is quite the role model even for adults. Classic must have for every home!",1363996800,,647,4.217741935483871
2593499,5,B000FZETZM,This is a delightful set that can be used to compliment the children's reading books.  The movies seem to follow the books closely.  All three DVD's are great.  I also recommend them to be seen by reluctant  readers after they read the books.  This will give them a concrete visual in case they find the language a bit hard to understand.,1363046400,,338,4.475409836065574

2593516,4,B000FZETZM,"Any family with childen 5 thru 11 will love this story about the dog, Shiloh. A nice family story that includes a visit to  children's grandmother who suffers from Alzheimers. There is a mystery, which presents a situation in which lessons can be learned about jumping to conclusions based on circumstantial evidence. One should not prejudge persons. Keep an open mind. I just loved the bad guys in this film, especiall Bad Guy #1. This films was shot outside St. Louis, MO, near Eureka.",1352419200,,487,4.7976190476190474
2593517,4,B000FZETZM,"Some time ago, I found ""The Complete Shiloh Film Collection"" on the bargain rack of a nearby Ross Store. It wouldn't be my favorite type of films to view, but I have a young boy (approaching 4) and he's going to like stuff like this before long. These are movies the whole family might watch. Well, teenagers might get a bit restless but kids from 6 to 12 plus the parents could all enjoy watching them together. The set amounts to three DVDs. All are boy/dog stories in somewhat similar fashion to the ""Lassie"" movies of old, although I think the ""Lassie"" series are better movies.

In the ""Shiloh"" film, a small beagle pup was rescued by Marty, a twelve-year-old boy, from his mean and cruel owner (Judd). A boy/dog love bond formed and Judd tried, without success, to get the dog back. Ultimately, he just gave up. In the next movie, ""Shiloh Season"" (or ""Shiloh 2""). the ever-meaner and ever-more-heavily drinking Judd continued trying to get Shiloh back, but his heavy drinking caused a truck wreck and a series of serious injuries. Shiloh was responsible for finding Judd and the wreck so, in effect, he rescued his former cruel owner. In the last film, ""Saving Shiloh,"" kids were behaving like kids and the group had a potentially serious swimming accident. Marty jumped into the river to rescue his sister and Shiloh jumped in to help with the situation, as best he could. Well, the girl was saved, but Shiloh became trapped in the fast-flowing current and was heading toward a water fall. At his point, Judd jumped in and managed to rescue Shiloh. So, there you have it in three movies:boy rescues dog, dog rescues former owner and former owner rescues dog.

The ""Shiloh"" movies are engaging movies and are enjoyable to watch. But we're talking family fare here and not academy award stuff. Enjoy, and watch it with your young kids or grandkids if you can.

2593518,5,B000FZETZM,My 12 year old had seen this story in school and had to have this package along with all of the books it is that sweet and time less.,1340582400,,133,3.6206896551724137
2593519,4,B000FZETZM,"Last night's entertainment was ""Saving Shiloh,"" the third in the Shiloh series of movies. It's supposedly seven years along in Shiloh's history. Doc has died and his wife had charge of the store. Marty was much older and more mature. The biggest improvement was in Judd, the lowlife from which Shiloh was rescued in the first movie episode. In this movie, you witness a transformation as he became a more likable human being and even began to take a place in the community.

Small town life proceeded at a glacial pace. Marty now had a job working with the local vet and was learning all about dogs. Marty finally convinced Judd that he shouldn't chain his dogs up. It's just all day to day humdrum until a murder took place. Everyone had their eyes on Judd as a suspect, except for the local sheriff and Marty's parents. Well, Judd had just gotten himself on everyone's fecal roster, so when anything happened, that's where people looked.

The show bumbled along at this glacial place, until finally there's a crisis. Marty's sister fell into the river and had to be rescued. Shiloh jumped in to help. Well, it was a valiant effort, but the dog got swept downstream and was about to go over the falls until he was rescued and returned to Marty at the last minute. Who rescued him? Well stay tuned for the happy ending. It's a slow paced, pleasant tale which is good viewing in a family setting. Personally, I'd enjoy a bit harder-edged fare.

They about the responsibilities of owning a dog, the challenges of doing what's right, and being a person of integrity.
