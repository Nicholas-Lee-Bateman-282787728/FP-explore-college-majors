She did so good with this video!! The narration was personable and real, you felt as if she was talking to you and the way the video is, she stays out of the camera but you'll see a hand reach out for a spoon and the food coming to towards you and she will describe it. I really loved it and want to look for more of her work!! I hope she realizes she has a genuine skill in filmmaking and in capturing the essence of culture. Thank you for sharing and even though this was made in 2001 I suddenly desire to plan a trip to Costa Rica!!",1270598400,,716,3.9448275862068964
8092021,1,B000BT1S88,"On Oct. 1, 2009 I ordered this film which is a piece of junk.  Don't waste your money on it.  My copy is seriously defective.  The film is supposed to last for 83 minutes.  At 32 minutes the film stopped completely for maybe a couple of minutes, then started again.  Then, at 59 minutes, it stopped permanently.  I then went back to the beginning and fast forwarded with the intention of trying to get close to about 50 minutes, then going back to regular play to see what would happen at 59 minutes.  Well into the film it suddenly went back to the start.
