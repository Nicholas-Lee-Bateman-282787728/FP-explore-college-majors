3454790,5,B001AMU6BU,"It was lots of fun watching these exceptional young athletes train and compete. These kids are so natural and genuine with their open enthusiasm for their sport of running. Watching this movie, it's easy to get the feeling that ALL runners who compete and give it their best over 3 miles of racing seem like winners, not just the first place finisher. I highly recommend this DVD for all parents and kids, boys and girls, who are looking for a sport to take up that empowers them with the notion that persistent hard work pays off. What a great life lesson.",1220918400,,557,4.524752475247524

The review is from Bill Wettengel - long time Cross Country and Track Coach at Costa Mesa High School, California. The review is un-edited and was submitted after the broadcast television release of the show. Art Vitarelli)
This is not just another inspirational sports film, it is much more than that. Cross Country has always been the ""little brother"" of fall sports. Having coached distance running at the high school level for twenty years, I have watched many attempts to put, on to the screen, what running is all about. They all fail in one respect, and that is how and why people made a contest of what is arguably the most physically demanding of all human athletic endeavors. This film however gives us a glimpse into the human psyche and it's unyielding effort to overcome the very basic law of physics, that a body at rest tends to stay at rest.

The sheer poetry of the human body, as it responds to the soul's conscience attempt to prevail over the mind's desire to rest and be comfortable can be seen etched in the faces of the competitors as they search deep inside themselves for the fortitude that it will take to reach the finish line, not just for themselves, but for a team who is depending on them to complete the race as close to the front of the pack that is possible.

The beauty of the Cross Country Course, and hence the earth, is exhibited in the stunning photography, and corresponding music that brings the experience into the viewer's consciousness and allows us to feel the runner's highs and lows. It makes us wonder at the marvels of nature and our place in the broader scheme of our existence. The earth is ours to do with as we please, watching young men and women running through their pain while surrounded by the beauty that surrounds us, gives us a positive feeling that we can be in the world without destroying it.",1220227200,,1928,4.585507246376811

3454793,5,B001AMU6BU,"If you ever wanted to know what it is really like to run, this is it. After watching the show I actually got up out of my seat and started running in place in my living room.

The photography is beautiful and seeing the runners from their perspective gives you the feeling that you are part of the cross country meet. It gives you a whole new appreciation about teamwork.

All cross country runners or any runner for that matter should buy this show. You will enjoy every moment. It may even inspire you to run a few miles today.",1218585600,2,529,4.28
8278030,3,B001AMU6BU,"After reading all the great reviews by other Amazon customers, I thought this would be the perfect video to buy for my son to get him motivated for the upcoming season. I ordered the DVD for him and since I currently am away I watched it on Amazon Instant Video, so that I could see it for myself. I was disappointed in the video because I expected it to be mostly about running and focusing on the young runners and their thoughts on running. There was some of that, but there was a lot of content that had nothing to do with running at all, information about the trails in Orange county in California, and municipal projects. In addition, the video was only about 27 minutes in length. I agree that there was some good information here, and it might be a good tool for the cross-country coach, just not a great motivator. I don't want to rate it too low, so I'll give it three stars, but it wasn't what I expected.",1312243200,,916,4.300578034682081
8278031,5,B001AMU6BU,"All That Kinda Stuff is a great film for the cross country enthusiast and should be in every cross country coach's DVD player.  The cinematography is amazing and the interviews of high school runners really portray the sport in a fantastic light.  This film hits on training, competing, the importance of teamwork within the sport, the elation of winning and the agony of defeat, and how to put defeat behind you to prepare you for the next competition.

While cross country takes amazing individual performances to win, it is ultimately a team sport and this film shows the importance of that.  While the film profiles Beckman High School in Irvine, CA, it would be relevant for ANY cross country runner to watch and enjoy.  The film shows us how important training is from a young age, and how much running becomes a lifetime sport enjoyed by all ages.

Vitarelli has put together an amazing montage of footage taken on the ground, from his bicycle, and from overhead while flying airplanes and helicopters.  The film takes the runners through the hills all the way into the Pacific Ocean. Vitarelli solidifies how important open space is to communities and how trails can be used by young and old, walkers, runners and cyclists.

All That Kinda Stuff runs approximately 1/2 hour and would be a great recruiting tool for Cross Country Coaches.  ***** Rating!",1228176000,,1360,4.852813852813853

8278033,5,B001AMU6BU,"If you have an interest in cross country running for yourself or your children or your team, this is an excellent video. Likewise, this video will be appealing if you simply have an interest in competitive sports or any aspect thereof.

If you are a cross country coach, this video might give you some ideas as well as possibly providing assistance in recruiting cross country runners. If you are a parent, this video will help you understand the potential benefits that participating on a cross country team will provide to your children. If you are a prospective cross country runner, this video will show you what is in store for you. Or if you are a runner or enjoy watching or participating in competitive sports, you will find this video interesting due to its photography, commentary and brief interviews of cross country participants.

This video explores the sport of cross country running from the air and at ground level, from an individual competition as well as a team competition, from the hard work of competing to the joy of accomplishing, from the coaching and the learning, from the practices to the competition and from the beach runs to the trail runs. Great photography and commentary is provided throughout. Various trails in Orange County are videoed.",1227052800,,1274,4.920930232558139
8278034,5,B001AMU6BU,"The video does a great job showing the athletes reactions to all the aspects they encounter while participating; training, racing,team bonding, successes, failures and the ups and downs of a season and a career.  Art's use of music, aerial photography,and narrations from coaches, parents, athletes,race directors and others gives a multi-dimentional take on the sport.  This type of video would be a great way to promote any program or event.  I love the life lessons as described by the athletes,as well as the ""team"" concept.  Well done, well done, well done.",1226966400,,562,5.142857142857143
8278035,4,B001AMU6BU,I really enjoyed watching this film - I found it to be educational and very well documented.  I have a new found respect for what is involved in the cross country training process and what keeps these runners motivated.  The scenery was wonderful and the narration very insightful. I would recommend this film to anyone who has an interest in cross country running or knows someone who runs cross country.,1224633600,,405,4.771428571428571
8278036,4,B001AMU6BU,"All That Kinda Stuff is overall a nice film introduction to Cross Country.
Interesting to this midwesterner - practices on the beach.
It's also good that the filmmaker touched on early Native American runners.  (see also&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Indian-Running-Native-American-History-and-Tradition/dp/0941270416/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Indian Running: Native American History and Tradition</a>)
However, the filmmaker all but neglects the European roots of Cross Country as a sport.  Another quibble - the filmmaker inserted some scenic footage that is nice, but not really contributory to the film.
Bottom Line:  It's a good film - pick it up if you want to see or show someone a relatively brief (briefer than&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Long-Green-Line/dp/B001GWUHNQ/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Long Green Line</a>)introduction to XC.",1224374400,,945,7.572727272727272
8278037,4,B001AMU6BU,"With all the physical work that is demanded of this sport, character seems to be the one hidden attribute you take with you after high school.  This DVD brings so many memories back to me as I ran for Joe Fisher at Costa Mesa High in the early 70's.  I made the closest friends I will ever have on that team.  Each one with amazing character.  I have Coach Fisher and Cross Country to thank for that.  This DVD is a job well done.  Thanks Art!",1222473600,,443,4.093023255813954
8278038,4,B001AMU6BU,"This movie is a great introduction and inspiration for young people considering joining a cross country team or just running for pleasure. It's also very informative for parents whose kids enjoy running. In addition to beautiful photography, the narration gives good background on the cross country sport. Whether you're competitive or not, running is a great activity for life - and this movie shows why!",1221436800,,405,5.246153846153846
