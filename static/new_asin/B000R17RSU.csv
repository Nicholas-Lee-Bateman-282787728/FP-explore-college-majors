8198276,5,B000R17RSU,"After capturing the hearts of a whole generation in the 60s and 70s, Kimba the White Lion fell on hard times. After not being seen at all for 15 years, the story and characters were ripped off and mutilated for a major motion picture, and the TV shows themselves were mutilated with lousy new soundtracks and foisted off as an inexpensive program for small networks and cheapo DVDs.

Well, the original shows with their original soundtracks have been restored, and episodes 1 through 26 are in this box. I was present at the world premiere screening of this restoration, and Fred Ladd (original producer of this series) said, ""I don't think anyone has ever seen Kimba looking that good before.""

Edit from 2009: This set is being re-released in October 2009 with 25 episodes. The first release had 26 episodes.",1190505600,10,810,4.7785714285714285
