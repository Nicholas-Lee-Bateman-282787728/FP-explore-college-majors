5271929,5,B0095XJ7PW,"Bought this for the Alamo movie; best one made for my money (sorry, Duke!). James Arness, Brian Keith, Alec Baldwin and the supporting cast are all excellent as is Raul Julia as Santa Ana. Great script, direction, etc. If you want to remember an Alamo movie, it should be this one. Book it's based on is good, too.",1360972800,2,314,4.431034482758621

5271951,2,B0095XJ7PW,I want another Alamo movie that I had seen. This is it but it's the worst of the 3 Alamo movies I own. Acting is lame and Matt Dillon as Jim Bowie and Brian Keith as Davy Crockett just doesn't cut it. I would not buy it.,1466899200,,220,3.702127659574468

5271959,5,B0095XJ7PW,"High Noon, Part 2:  AMAZING!!!

All I can say is ""They just don't write 'em like that any more!""  (with hat tip to the Greg Kihn Band for singing that one).

WOW!  I Grew up with ""High Noon"" being basically my favorite movie, saw it more times than anything else... and I didn't even know there was a ""Part 2"", until now.  It does not disappoint, and makes a very, very worthy attempt at being even better than the first (jury is still out).  Very much in character, a very plausible scenario of what might happen when Will Kane rides back into town.  Everyone in the movie was great.  (Were there some gaps?  Of course.  Hello, it's a ""movie"".  There are gaps in reality, how could there possibly not be gaps in a movie.)

But wow.  I don't know about ""50 Shades"" (I refuse to see that), but the characters in this movie have about 20 shades of good & evil-- and none pure white nor pure black, each one somewhere in between.

I wish modern movie makers would learn something from this movie.  With the makers of ""The Avengers"" spending some $100 million on visual effects, and about a dollar-fifty on writing, I wish they could see ""how it's done"".  Great writing:  many things in this movie I did not expect-- and it's a Western!  No real special effects at all, just some Western scenery.  I wish ""The Avengers"" et. al. would take note and spend some real time and effort on WRITING!

GREAT movie.  I won't say anything else about it.  Lee Majors does an A+ fine job filling Gary Cooper's shoes as Will Kane, and Katherine Cannon might as well be Princess Grace Kelly in this sequel.  The plot is less linear than the original's, with some surprises, and the suspense is real.  I would watch it again.  A better movie than ""Avengers"" (even ""Avengers"" in 3D), and at maybe 1% of the production cost.

I look forward to seeing The Alamo!",1432339200,3,1839,4.411940298507463

5271976,3,B0095XJ7PW,"The version by John Wayne esp directors cut (unfortunately only in vhs) is the best one I think! The one with Jason Patric is a close second!  Fess Parker is also great as Crockett, of course ""his"" movie (s) are only partly about The Alamo. About this one then... Feels a little like a film made for tv...but!! It's always great to watch James (Gunsmoke,Macahan) Arness! /NB",1407888000,2,374,4.582089552238806

5271982,5,B0095XJ7PW,"TGG found another one of those lost gems of Western movie history.  Compelling story is a lot more than a High Noon rider, has strong performances by major actors, and the scoring is superb.  Filmed at the original Old Tucson Studio with moody desert landscapes.  Copy could be better, but acceptable and probably the best available.  Thank you TGG for producing this movie on DVD!",1376697600,4,381,4.815384615384615

5271986,4,B0095XJ7PW,"I like Alamo movies, I haave many. Some not totally historically accurate but they are entertaining and the Americans aren't the villians.",1363305600,,138,5.318181818181818
5271987,5,B0095XJ7PW,"I consider this my generation's Alamo movie.  I remember it airing on NBC.  It came out during the period of the sequicentennial, the 150th anniversary of Texas.  It has its warts, not factually accurate in some areas (i.e. Crockett wearing a cowboy hat rather than the famed coonskin cap), and it uses old footage from previous Alamo battle movies and re-uses the same footage over and over again (Travis shot the same guy 2 or 3 times with the same flintlock pistol, which can't be reloaded that quickly under duress).

That said, I still enjoy this movie every time I see it.  If I'm in the mood to see a movie about the Alamo, I turn to this one, because it's the one I grew up watching.  A young Alec Baldwin did a fantastic job as William Barrett Travis.  And Raul Julia's turn as Santa Anna was spectacular.  He was scripted to be a strong villain, and Julia was outstanding filling out the role that way.  I really enjoyed James Arness and Brian Keith as Bowie and Crockett, and the way the tension and interaction between the commanders was portrayed.  That's really the key to this movie, Travis comes of age as he has to take full command, Bowie learning to respect the kid, Crockett trying to ease tensions between the two.  Travis' character was dolled up into being this ""pure"" rookie who's in over his head.  The actual Travis was probably much more complicated, and I doubt he treated his servant Joe that well, but for the purposes of this picture, it reinforces the ""angelic good guy"" motif for Travis, vs the worldly, ""been there, seen it and done it all"" Bowie, adding more to that tension.  Good performances by various characters that add to the overall movie.  Probably each story could become its own movie, but for the purposes of the movie/miniseries, they add to the overall picture.

It's not perfect, it has its flaws, but again, it's the Alamo movie of my generation.",1362355200,8,1897,4.604166666666667
5271988,5,B0095XJ7PW,Alex Baldwin is a nut job but gave a great performance as Travis.  A pretty historically accurate film.  My classes enjoyed it.,1362268800,3,127,4.7272727272727275
