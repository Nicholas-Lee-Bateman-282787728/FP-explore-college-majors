THe DVD is set up very well, it has a section where you can listen to archival recordings of her work - arias and folk songs. It also has a photo gallery. Reading about someone on the internet is one thing, but you can not understand the magnitued of this woman or the effect she had on people until your hear someone describe her. They way the faces of these people lit up when they would talk about her music, shows just how talented she was. The biography portion isn't dull like many TV biographys are, they tie in enough of her work and intresting tidbits about Novotna to make this story really come alive. I reccomend this DVD to anyone intrested in Opera, the met, or Checkoslovakian history.",1140998400,9,878,4.49375
