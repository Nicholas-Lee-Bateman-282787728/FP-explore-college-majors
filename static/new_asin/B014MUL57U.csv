8731423,2,B014MUL57U,The show skips in places other than that it is good,1467676800,,51,3.727272727272727
8731424,1,B014MUL57U,"I, just as others on this board have had the same problems.
 There are at least 4 disks that are just completly blank, and they are bootlegs which by the looks of the box you wouldnt notice. Just take our advice. don't buy this. at the VERY best you'll get 75% of the series with glitches and skips on the disks that DO work.",1464998400,2,325,4.078125
8731425,1,B014MUL57U,Not happy at all there is a long wait to get it in the mail which would have been worth it however the end result is not. Sure the packaging was nice and the DVDs and box cover has nice art work however the last 5 DVDs are glitchy several full episodes it won't let you watch and many more just glitches up and jumps sene to sene,1461369600,,329,3.8529411764705883
8731426,2,B014MUL57U,I am not very happy because some of my DVDs will not work. I am very unhappy with that.,1459296000,,87,3.6315789473684212
8731427,4,B014MUL57U,"finally, the entire set! First of all, the packaging was good, and the box design is very beautiful. Of course it took forever and a day to get here but the wait was worth it to have the full set. The only reason I didn't give this five stars is because although it was brand new, there is scratching on the discs. I watched all of it and I am sorry to say that on each disc there is one episode that skips on me-even when playing on my blue-ray player. It's annoying but thankfully the instances are far apart and not too severe. Overall I am happy to finally have this piece. I just wish the discs hadn't been damaged.",1459123200,,620,4.132231404958677
8731428,5,B014MUL57U,"I love it . It took some time to get, but it was worth the wait . It comes with every season with multi audio English and Japanese dub. And you just can't go wrong with the price I would definitely  advise for you to buy this .The season is amazing and it comes in a super cool case",1458950400,3,282,3.7796610169491527
8731429,1,B014MUL57U,"Bought this product thinking ""oh wow! what a great deal."" However, when it arrived and i attempted to watch the DVD's all the discs were blank. There was no content on any of them. In the end the season collection turned into a very nice paper weight. so if you want to go through a long, but relatively easy refund process then buy these DVD's, but if you want to save yourself the headache then just buy the seasons separately or from another seller.",1458691200,4,452,4.392857142857143
8731430,5,B014MUL57U,"If I could give it 6 stars, I would! Bought this for my daughter in the beginning of January and yes, it took a long time to come, but this box set is Beautiful. It was well protected in bubble wrap, and factory sealed. It's all seven years of the show and you have the option on the menu of English Dubbed, or not, and the subtitles are in all different languages. All 12 discs come in individual sleeves and are easy to take out and put back. Came with no scratches or smudges at all! Had to contact the seller to ask a couple questions, but they replied within a day or two. It doesn't come with the Final Act, but you can find both parts of that in one set for not too much money.  This set is a VERY good buy if you love the series! Much cheaper in price than other sets I've found.",1454112000,7,787,3.981012658227848
