8529797,2,B000CQM2TO,"As an avid shipwreck fan I found this dvd a bit disappointing.  I enjoy a bit of history with lots of underwater shots of the ships being discussed.  This film had much in the way of history - sort of looked like a powerpoint presentation with history bits flashing on the screen.  The biggest disappointment was the lack of underwater shots for each shipwreck.  I think there was about 1 minute of underwater footage at most for each shipwreck.  If you want just the history, this film is okay although there are other means of gathering more in depth information.  If you are looking for a film with lots of underwater footage, you will be very disappointed with this film.",1289779200,2,675,4.583333333333333
