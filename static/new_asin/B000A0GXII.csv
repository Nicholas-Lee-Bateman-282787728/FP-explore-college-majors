8071198,4,B000A0GXII,"I especially like the part where they are filming the Caribou near some water and in the back ground it has been noticed recently that there is a Bigfoot in the film. No one can explain if it is a crew member and if it was than why is he dressed all in black and not carrying a large IMAX camera and focusing on the subjects at hand? For a real good zoomed in break down ThinkerThunker and this youtube link.https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzlpK5g5quk . I am a Bigfooter myself with many encounters and 2 sightings of my own. These are breathing, living, creatures that inhabit the world. Not just the pacific northwest.",1410393600,,620,4.6454545454545455

8071200,2,B000A0GXII,"I expected a movie full of awesome camera shots and an interesting story.  I thought this movie was rather boring and the photography was not particularly impressive.

The film was well edited and produced and IMAX footage is always really great but I was expecting alot more.  HD quality was great.  I found the bonus features (making of the movie) much more interesting than the actual film.",1252713600,,393,4.82089552238806

I thought any film documenting the ""Great North"" would be boring.  After all, what can you say about snow, ice, and freezing temperatures?  You can imagine my surprise, then, when I discovered that this is actually a beautiful and informative documentary!!

This film was originally released as an IMAX movie.

This documentary has a main narrator but at brief spots narration is taken over by Adamie Inukpuk whose Inuit family has lived in the north for several generations.  Adamie tells us about his grandfather ""Nanook"" (meaning ""the Great White Bear""), a skilful and knowledgeable Inuit.

The film also looks at animals of the north that the Inuit revere: caribou (or ""tuktu"" meaning ""the wandering ones."")  Among other things, we're told that:

""Over a million strong, the [caribou] herds of northern Quebec and Labrador [both located in Canada] are the largest assembly of migrating mammals on Earth.""

Also looked at and discussed are the analogue of the Inuit: the Saami of northern Sweden.  They revere the reindeer, known as ""the caribou's close cousin.""

Interesting black and white archival footage is also shown.  (A portion of this footage shows the building of an igloo.)

Most of the background music throughout is traditional music (Saami singers, throat singers, etc.) thus enhancing the viewer's appreciation of what is shown.  And the photography and cinematography are fantastic!!

Finally, the DVD itself (the one released in 2008 on Blu-ray) is perfect in picture and audio quality.  It has four extras.

In conclusion, as I said above, this film was an unexpected surprise since it details adequately a land few are familiar with!!

(2000;  41 min.;  wide screen,  12 scenes)

8071203,4,B000A0GXII,"This IMAX film is a wonderful look into the lives of the dwellers of the GREAT NORTH, both human and animal.  The shots of herds of caribou are very impressive and the traditional ""breathing"" kind of music the inuit women practice is fascinating.  Overall an entertaining way to learn about this little-known region.",1178409600,,316,4.943396226415095
