4231857,4,B003YXZH94,"This is a very enjoyable movie. I loved the lighting and photography in it. The music is also great. In spite of the fact that both actresses are naked most of the time throughout the movie, both actresses deliver their lines beautifully and naturally, and as the story develops you get emotionally involved with the characters. They really seem at ease with themselves and with each other and just flow. They share a moment in life, passion, fantasies, stories, emotions; a room. And the witness for this unusual love story is precisely a room in Rome.",1297123200,11,553,4.770833333333333
4231858,5,B003YXZH94,"I was a huge fan of Julio Medem's small but exquisite oeuvre already, but Room in Rome easily made it into the top five of my all-time favourite films (where it competes with Medem's&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sex-and-Lucia-Unrated-Edition/dp/B0004Z32NI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sex and Lucia (Unrated Edition)</a>). What, you may ask, makes it so special?

First the set-up - a one-night encounter in a hotel room, which the camera never leaves except to peep out onto the balcony or through the entrance of the room into the corridor. This would work brilliantly in a very small theatre as well. The basic idea is borrowed from a Chilean movie (En la cama) with a couple of very important tweaks. Medem turned the man of the first movie into a woman, and he moved the room to Rome, and embedded it in Italian art history. There are paintings on every wall and even on the ceilings, which play an important part in the movie.

Alternatively, to relate it to a better known movie, one could call it an all-female ""<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Before-Sunrise/dp/B00002E224/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Before Sunrise</a>"" set indoors and in a different city. In one rollercoaster night the protagonists get to know each other and learn to trust and love each other.

So in that room, we have two women, not too many clothes, lots of art, and modern IT equipment enabling them to show each other their outside lives via Google Earth. Oh, and a splendid view from the balcony over the roofs of Rome. (One could have called it Room with a view, had the title not been taken by some other movie.)

Let's get the clothes issue out of the way first, as it seems to have scared UK distributors to an extent that they didn't give the film a chance in the cinemas. Yes, both women are undressed for most of the length of the movie, but after about two minutes that appears completely normal and one stops noticing it. In a sense, considering their respective vulnerabilities and difficult path towards mutual trust and truthfulness, one could argue that most of their nakedness is psychological rather than physical. Seen this way, the cosy white bath robes they put on for breakfast in the end seem to represent the comfort and protection of a trusting (if time-limited) relationship.

More interestingly, the art, chosen by Medem's wife and art director Montse Sanz, tells us something not only about the story and its possible interpretations, it also offers insights into Medem's philosophy when Natasha cites the Renaissance artist Leon Battista Alberti, seen in one of the paintings, as saying: ""The artist must know at all times what he is representing.""

I would argue that the film contains more classical art than we see on the walls. Many of the poses of the women remind me of paintings - most of them reclining nudes, obviously. Towards the end, Medem acknowledges artworks as a source of inspiration explicitly when he makes Natasha copy the pose of the Venus of Milo, which is present in the room as a small scale model. Come to think of it, with all the gorgeous lighting and colours, many of the frames would make nice paintings.

Ironically, the state of the art IT equipment including a smartphone and a laptop running Google Earth (or the Microsoft equivalent) almost seamlessly becomes as important as the Renaissance paintings, as it's the only connection to the previous and outside life of the protagonists. Talking of technology, I also love the fact that Alba turns out to be an engineer who came to Rome to plug an invention she made. While she failed to score a contract on this occasion, her business seems to be going ok, judging by the quality of the hotel room she booked. And as Natasha is an art historian, the story could be read as a ""two cultures"" dialogue as well.

The five languages - some of the most touching moments involve each character speaking their native language (Spanish / Russian), assuming the other won't understand. But the English dialogue, with just enough of an accent to identify the origin of each character worked surprisingly well for me (I do like my Spanish films and am not necessarily happy if people switch to English). It's sad and ironic, however, that Medem's first film to feature dialogue mostly in English wasn't actually shown in UK or US cinemas. We also get some Italian (via the singing room service waiter) and some Basque via a video, reminding us of Medem's cultural background (I understand that, genetically, he is as much German as Basque, namely 1/4 each).

The music of Spanish (but English singing) singer-songwriter Lourdes Hernandez, aka Russian Red (a pseudonym she borrowed from her favourite lipstick, apparently) is perfect for the movie, not only because her accent matches Alba's.",1294876800,151,4853,5.033623910336239

I thought the actresses besides being very attractive, had chemistry and were believable in their roles.  I loved that the film was set in Rome as it reminded my of brief time there and how the room looked just like the one I had stayed in.  In my opinion it represented the intimacy between two women when they are attracted to each other.  The end even though sad was fitting in the context of the relationships each women had with another person.  I would hope others would watch this and understand how same sex relationships do not differ from same sex relationships.",1474675200,6,722,4.645669291338582

4231866,4,B003YXZH94,"Two women, strangers, meet in a bar in Rome and spend one night together talking about their lives in between bouts of sex. Yes, the movie is slow, but watching it I found myself drawn into it more and more. Both women reveal personal and at times very painful things about themselves and the family around them. This isn't lesbian porn, the sex between them is there way of just being close to someone who they have no bad history with. Its cathartic for both of them and even though they know its only for one night they both realize it is something they need at the time.

Could this movie have worked with an opposite sex couple? Maybe, but by using two women you see a closeness between two people you probably wouldn't see in a male/female couple. Plus by making it two women there is an openness, a willingness to share you wouldn't see otherwise. Its definitely worth watching, I saw it on Netflix, just to see the acting and the set.",1460592000,,942,4.413793103448276

Assault on the senses and really grabs you from the first moment and doesn't let go of you're attention for one second.this is a film that really brings out the best of a straight woman having her first lesbians experience with a partner who is so intense and really sensual. Elena Anaya and Natasha yarovenko. Are both brilliant and dazzling in this intensely romantic and sexual movie. The director Julio me demand really has produced a classic that will last for a very long time. This is a film that people generations from now will be able to watch and love.

4231890,1,B003YXZH94,"This film is ridiculous.  It's so obviously made by men who know absolutely nothing about women's sexuality and even less about lesbian sex.  So instead of portraying lesbian sexuality realistically, they portrayed it according to their immature, corny fantasies.

The dialogue feels like it was written by college freshmen boys who are socially awkward math majors.  Their assignment was to write a dialogue between two women who are stuck in a room together.  Having few relationships with women, the awkward math majors rely on cliches and story bits they picked up from their mother's soap operas.  The attempts to make it dramatic are painfully trite.

In the second scene of the movie, two women go up to a room.  One has never had sex with a woman before and is nervous and reticent.  She is too nervous to kiss. So instead she offers to get naked.  Really??  So they both get totally naked before kissing, before making out, before touching one another.  Who has sex like that for the first time? The filmmakers must be horrible in bed.  They got no game.  They sex scenes are not hot because they are completely unrealistic.

The entire film takes the perspective of the male gaze.  Did any of the filmmakers study film theory?  Was the whole thing filmed by teenage boys with a hard-on?  Has the director even ever heard of the concept of the male gaze?

If you want to watch this film because you want to see naked women, go buy some real porn.  This film fails as story and it fails as porn.",1414195200,3,1503,4.621212121212121

4231896,5,B003YXZH94,"The other night I was up late with a sick grandbaby, so while I was trying to rock her to sleep I turn on TV to kill time.  This film came up and I started to watch it.  Now I am retired but I am not dead, so the idea of two women in a room had some appeal for me.  I was half way listening to the actors and just looking at them, when ...now this is weird part... I stopped noticing that they were naked and started looking at the beauty of film.
Both women are beautiful, but after awhile I became enchanted with the way the director filmed the story.  The room itself became a living character that played a part in the story line. The lighting was terrific and created the just perfect mood.  I can not say enough of the different camera angles.  There is one scene when the smaller woman is wearing robe and telling her story and the blonde woman is seen hazily on the bed in the background and this was very haunting for me.  Oh there was sex but again this began stop being ""dirty"" and became beautiful and fluent in it acts.  Before I forget, the music is so out of left field for what I thought this movie would be that it strangely was moving and beautiful.

I wish I could tell you what the story was exactly but I don't know. I was too engrossed with beauty of the film to concentrate on the story.  I found this movie again two nights later and watched it to see what it was about, but once again the beauty of the film kept me from the story.

4231902,5,B003YXZH94,"I sat down to watch this last night by myself, not knowing much about it. I knew it was a bit steamy in parts and that it was very ""soulful"". By the time the movie was over my heart felt shredded. Having been in a similar situation (LDR) I started to remember how damn hard it is to say goodbye to someone you have fallen for but you know you cant be with them. I find that, for some reason women find it very easy to trust each other physically (since it cant be taken it has to be given). They can end up getting very attached and within a blink its all over and they have to walk away. Its heart breaking.

There is one part in the movie where Alba collapses after Natasha pushes her off and the reality of the situation truly hits her, it actually had me quite upset. I have never had so many memories flooding back in, I was actually quite shocked at how much I remembered.

Its hard to pick a favourite part because they are all so engaging. I love when they go nuts singing and jumping around the bed, Natasha starts screaming her head off and that had me in absolute stiches. Women are nuts, I don't care what anyone says but they sure know how to have fun. There is a wonderful scene where they are together singing in the shower, that was brilliant and made me smile a lot (been there done that).

I am going to buy this on blue ray but I am not sure how many more times I will watch it. It hits very close to home and reminds me of someone I miss very much. The situation was very similar though it was a long distance relationship and not just one night. But we always knew we would have to walk away...again and again and again.

Beautiful movie that sheds a light on love between two people.

More a gentle exploring of the physical aspect of a complete relationship that started with sex and bloomed into a loving, caring relationship, as often happens with any couple. The room is dark but then the lighting in the room came from one end table lamp and the bathroom light. I think the music is great, but too loud in some places. Jocelyn Pook wrote the music for the movie. I thought it so good I bought the only CD I could find of it from Spain for $21. As someone else said, ""The movie wouldnt be as half as good without the soundtrack."" The often repeated ""Loving Strangers"" by Russian Red (Lourdes Hernndez) fits so well with the movie and Jocelyn Pook's soundtrack you would think both artists collaborated on their music for this film.

4231925,5,B003YXZH94,"On their last night in Rome, Alba (Elena Anaya) and Natasha (Natasha Yarovenko) meet at a bar; talk of Russia and Spain and walk the cobblestone streets until they end up at Alba's hotel. Natasha openly states that she has never come back to a woman's hotel room before. Unsure at first, she eventually comes under the spell of Alba's charms. From that point on, the women rarely don any clothes at all; an occasional robe or sheet is all that separates them for the remainder of the film.

The women initially hide their real identities weaving false tales of love, life and their past. As they become closer physically, making love over and over again, the stories gradually become closer to the truth and their inhibitions are stripped bare. Natasha is meeting her fianc and is to be married within a week; Alba on the other hand has run away from a troubled relationship with her partner and the grief that has separated them. As the women navigate the terrain of truth and lies, they discover what hides beneath the surface and in doing so change their lives forever. Over breakfast on the terrace surrounded by the beauty of Rome, they talk of what they would do if they could be together.  After this intense night of passion, can Alba and Natasha really part?

Set almost entirely in a hotel room full of old world charm, the sensuously real love making scenes are depicted in lush hues as deep as the artwork that hangs on the walls. Writer-director Julio Medem (Sex & Lucia) has brought to the screen a stunning, if unconventional film.  There is so much to relish - the beautiful women, gorgeous views of Rome or the voyeuristic pleasure in watching these two women make love all night long.

4231926,5,B003YXZH94,"This movie was poetry from beginning to end. To that extent, some viewers might not appreciate the art house feel, which could leave it wrongly neglected if it is to be relegated as just a lesbian themed movie with consequently limited following. It deserves and caters to a far broader audience than this.

As some reviewers have mentioned, the perpetual nakedness of the actors soon looses your attention as you become drawn into their world, intimate and compelling. I loved the stories both women wove, to entwine both each other and the viewer into curious and fascinating places. Every element of the movie is about weaving a fantasy, whether it is the fantasy of the possibilities between the two characters, the fantasies they weave about their lives, and the very fantasies of the audience (genders aside...or not), all backdropped by the wonderfully dream-like, art-filled room the whole encounter takes place in.

Of course, there is also the expectation of a great sex scene in such a movie, and this one provides with poetic aplomb...twice. But this should be considered incidental to the entire journey through this magical realm.

I saw this movie over a year ago and had so many more (now forgotten) ponderings about it that I wish I had written this review then. Definitely a favourite.",1360195200,3,1303,4.967889908256881

She has ugly brown mommy breasts that were a turnoff too.  The Russian chick is a little better, but nothing special.  There is nothing erotic about this movie.  They just go on and on talking nonsense the whole time.  Maybe this is a chick film and I just didn't get it.

4231936,4,B003YXZH94,"I don't really watch too many movies or TV these days but I finally decided I would watch Kill Bill tonight. After watching that movie for about 30 minutes, I felt it was overrated so once a commercial came up I flipped through the channels, and it was either Trailer Park Boys The Movie which I already saw 3x (great movie by the way) or this movie which was on The Sundance Channel which I'm not paying for but for some reason I'm getting it. Anyways, my TV said that the movie was adult-rated and I wouldn't be able to watch it without inputting the parental code. Now, I'm 25 years old, and I don't live in Wadiya so I don't know why there's a parental code in the first place, but being curious, I surmised that the password was 0000. I was correct.

Unfortunately, the movie was almost ending but since the girls were hot I felt that it was my obligation to download the movie online and watch it anyways. I'm a dude, so take it for what it's worth, but I didn't watch the whole movie just parts of it. I'm not really sure what this movie was about but I felt that there should have been less chat and more action. It is for this reason that I had to dock one star for my review.

From what I could tell, after fast-forwarding through the movie, the basic idea was that the lesbian chick (who had a nice body) and the straight Russian chick (who, in my opinion, was super hot) meet at a bar, are kind of tipsy, go back to a hotel room, and the straight chick is like, ""No, I don't wanna, I'm straight"" but after some minimal resistance from the lesbian chick is like, ""Ah hell let's do this 'cuz hell we're in Rome"" and then they scissor, talk about how it's ok for the straight girl to explore her female sexuality, how men are pigs and evil, seduce some Italian dude and then get offended after leading him on after he offers to pull his dong out, hate on men some more, and then finally the straight (I guess technically bicurious) woman is like, ""Oh well this was just one awesome night but we must move on"", and the lesbian chick is like, ""But what?!? I, I loved you, and you're only person who I've ever truly loved"" and then the straight girl is like, ""No!"" and then finally they have some bathtub sex and part ways.

Other than that, I don't really know how much artistic or literary merit the story has though to be fair I'm not really the type to ask this. If you're the artistic type, you can probably appreciate this movie for the layers of hidden symbolism, metaphors, and literary terms that I haven't thought about since high school Engrish classes. I feel like this is the type of movie that chicks would like, and it's definitely better than that Notebook crap. Unfortunately, I think if you're a straight dude and you ask your friends who are girls to watch it with you, they would probably slap you. If not, then props to you bro.

I think this is the type of movie that can appeal to both chicks and dudes. For chicks it has sentimental music that compels you to feel that the movie is sentimental, deep, and polished, and, of course, a story about taboo love in a stereotypically classy and romantic setting -- Europe, the land where men can get away with wearing purses by saying they're European. For dudes, lesbians and ""bicurious"" women, it has a hot naked Russian chick that makes Linsday Lohan look like Rosie O'Donnell, and for that reason I give this the Mango Seal of Approval.",1348358400,7,3413,4.344827586206897
4231937,5,B003YXZH94,"The director of this film was avant garde in his presentation of full nudity.  The film is not a sleazy
prono film, but a sexually stimulating and artful presentation of two females choosing to defy moral strictures
of propriety in order to delve into a forbidden relationship which provides them with joy and satisfaction.  This
is an artful film and not ludicrous or shoddy in any way.  Happily by extending the boundaries of society they
develop a sort of love relationship, which is all that could be wished from such an adventure.",1347062400,7,535,4.793478260869565
4231938,5,B003YXZH94,"I've had this movie sitting in it's box for a little over a year. I just didn't have the time, or the will to watch it. Surfing on the web one day I found a picture of 2 girls hugging very dramatically in a bathtub and someone mentioned it was from ""Room in Rome"" so I decided to give it a go.

Picture is marvelous and music is exquisite... I regret enormously not watching this movie before. The story happens in a small room of some sort of hotel in Rome full of paintings. Two strangers meet in a bar, and decide to act crazy for once and head to the hotel room of one of them. Four walls, yet the story does not become boring.

This movie dances in a thin lie of truths and lies, and the line becomes even thinner when trying to classify it. I would consider it one of the greatest lesbian drama movies done so far, yet since the two main characters spend 90% of the movie naked it caresses the erotica genre so sensually you will have trouble classifying it yourself.

There is just so much complexity, complicity, companionship, and passion between the two characters there's no denial they're each other's true soul mates...  This movie truly catches a glimpse of how lesbian relationships happen many times, and how things are just not always sexual. I would definitely recommend it to a friend.",1338681600,7,1304,4.420833333333333

4231941,4,B003YXZH94,"I just watched this and what can I say? As a straight male who is a hopeless romantic and a huge lover of beautifully shot and acted (and written) cinema, this really bowled me over. Having just watched an excellent film called ""Elena Undone"" I was looking for something similar so went for this. And very glad I am too. Someone mentioned that it's almost like a female version of ""Before Sunrise"" which incidentally is one of my favourite films of all time along with the brilliant sequel, ""Before Sunset"". It's also a tone poem and the fact that the two protaganists happen to be women is really incidental. ANYONE who's a romantic at heart and likes to get lost/wrapped up in a love story (yes it doesn't hurt that the two lead actresses are both stunning and are naked for 90% of the movie) will fall in love with this I think. I wasn't expecting it to be as intelligent and well written and well acted as it was. The whole damn thing just looks GORGEOUS to boot so hats off to the cinematographer there. I've not heard of this director or his other films before so I will have to investigate further I think.

Only thing that annoyed me as someone pointed out was the jarring and I think unecessary use of not just that vapid ""Perfect Strangers"" song but the music in general. It just seemed to be way too intrusive and LOUD as well. And why is it that films nowadays with subtitles have to be in white so it makes it all but impossible to read?! Especially with the scenes in the bathroom! I just don't understand why films can't be subtitled with a black border behind them just like the old days. Oh and whoever compared this to ""Last Tango In Paris"" well I wouldn't personally. For one I can't stand that film, pretentious overrated and self indulgent dreck. This is far, far better.

4231945,5,B003YXZH94,"What struck me immediately in the film was the sound track. Especially the song ""Loving Strangers"".
To say the truth the film left me baffled and confused for the first hour or so. I am not saying that I didn't like the shots of women making love to each other (far from it) or they being naked practically all the duration of the film.
I just kept trying to understand the meaning, the message behind all the beauty pictured in the film, represented not only by women making love as if their very life depended on such act but also fairy-like skylines of Rome and a room that felt like a museum of fine arts more than a room in a hotel. It was all majestically opulent and baroque as only Rome can be. And what to say about the waiter that sings operetta....
And the song Loving Strangers kept coming back...Maybe we all ""fall in love"" in fantasy or reality with a stranger imagining that our lives would be completely different. That perfectness is just a second away from being true. That the solution for all of our problems are there in that stranger we are loving with all the strength that everyday difficulties can generate.
Loving Strangers...toying with the idea that somehow life can just for a night be different....and can it be all as simple as that, with no consequences whatsoever?",1311552000,7,1297,4.547008547008547

From 12 minutes into the film, they are undressed and remain so until breakfast on the balcony the next morning. Surrounded by the chiaroscuro of Italian Renaissance paintings, with all their watching shadows and highlights, their conversation (between bouts of unbridled passion!) sees them emotionally undressing each other ever more throughout the night, telling their stories, until dawn arrives in stunning brilliance over the Eternal City. The camera moves like a soft and subtle choreographical brush across the canvas, so the nudity is, quite literally, artistic. The natural nudity of lovers, though not a nudist film. The film is lyrical, almost Sappho-like in a poetic way, with everything intertwining, even the theme of being watched from above (as the painted cupids on the ceiling do) wraps the story up in a beautiful bow.

4231949,4,B003YXZH94,"... though it'd be facile to say they're not appreciated. The two actresses are gorgeous and they play their sex scenes enthusiastically, but the real erotic content is to be found in their playfulness, their hesitation, their emotion. Sex is both entertainment and a bandage for the pain of their pasts and presents. If you're looking for pornography you'll be disappointed despite the profound sexuality of the film.

Both women find themselves initially unwilling to give their real names or pasts, substituting a cascade of lies in an effort to keep their distance. Over the course of the night, however, they become closer, the lies fall apart, and they find their emotions running away with them.

The bad: the character of Maximo is completely superfluous, adding nothing to the story but the male gaze and a moment of fearful discomfort that interrupts both the emotional and erotic content. The soundtrack repeatedly resorts to an increasingly annoying Italian pop song with vapid English lyrics. And, after an entire film firmly rooted in reality, the penultimate scenes make a sudden jarring and unnecessary switch to magical realism.

All in all: come to this film for the beautiful (and near-constant) female nudity, stay for the chaotic love story. It's not a masterpiece, but it's definitely one of the high points of the art erotica genre.",1307059200,58,1355,5.094594594594595

If you're just a guy looking for good soft porn, you'll be bored for the majority of the film (though about 90% of the film features the two female leads naked).

4231958,4,B003YXZH94,"I confess I've always wanted to be able to write the story of a relationship in compressed form and Room In Rome accomplishes this brilliantly. In summary it's simple: two women meet in a bar before the movie commences and we see them embark on what should be a simple sexual encounter. But then... half-truths, lies, full truths, sharing of painful past experiences, sharing present joys, the fear of developing love... it's all caught delicately. Every time we think the movie is going in one direction, there's a change of pace, tone and intention.

It would be very easy for a film like this to be pretentious but the light direction and sure-footed acting saves the day every time this risk appears to be drawing close. The two women fall in love, almost against their will, and so the morning comes to symbolize both rebirth and also the approaching of the pain of separation. Dawn is Alba's moment, and Dasha promises ""I'll stay with you till the dawn, and then we'll say goodbye.""

It's really difficult to manage the intensity of such a scenario, and the longing it involves, but the script and the cast succeed. When the Russian girl Dasha steps away from Alba we really do feel the pain of the moment. Perhaps the only two unrealistic components are (i) the empathy and sympathy each woman has for the other - in real life one or both would tend to cut away to avoid pain; and (ii) the silly ""arrow in the heart"" moment that visually depicts the heart-pain Abla feels.

Oh, and as the other reviewer has noted, after about the first two minutes we simply stop noticing the nudity of the actresses - the facial expressions, the movements of the hands, are all much more engrossing. The moments of sexual activity are more tender and touching than erotic, culminating in the moment they hug each other in the bath just before Dasha departs forever. It's in no way sexually arousing but it is absolutely arousing of tenderness, love, and the pain of loss-about-to-happen. How many of us have known that moment when the beloved is still present but we know, absolutely know, they are about to leave and never come back?  This is what the bath scene captures so brilliantly: lost possibility, lost love, a sacrifice to the quotidian. At the end of the movie the two women leave the room together, to go their separate ways. An entire relationship encapsulated in a single night.

But... at the end the movie cheats. After the women part, Dasha runs to Alba. The obligatory happy ending... without this last moment of capitulation to audience expectations the movie would have earned a five-star review. And the music is great!

UPDATE - since writing the original review I've re-watched this movie from time to time and each time it seems to become more poignant. Yes, some of the acting is a bit clunky for a few seconds here and there but overall there's something profoundly touching about the way in which even during the moments of greatest tenderness, greatest excitement of new love, the echo of imminent loss permeates everything. Perhaps I've reached the age where, no longer believing in love, it's come to matter more and more.",1299283200,36,3144,4.728102189781022

They were naked of course, but the sex wasn't graphic and you had to be aware these were actresses playing a part. Natasha turns out to be quite talented, and its her physical abilities which impressed me the most. The sex between them was the usual girl-girl stuff. If this were porn you'd see a lot of fake moaning and groaning. This is none here. You understand that women vacationing in Rome offer promise, and memories. A waiter appears briefly, but luckily only briefly.",1524873600,,551,4.690721649484536
8409835,4,B003YXZH94,"The entire movie takes place over the night in one room in Rome, where two strangers meet, and come to the one woman's room.  The relationship that develops is like peeling an onion.  There are many layers and many truths to be discovered, and misinformation to be corrected.  The movie is cast in shadows and a richness of a reddish hue from the lights.  Until the ending, it really is difficult to know how everything will end up, as the emotions that develop are finely crafted, and at a high pitch.",1522454400,,502,4.483516483516484

8409840,4,B003YXZH94,"I thought this was a good movie. The main characters are pretty much naked the whole time which doesn't bother me since I'm open-minded with nudity and sex.

Was slow in places that got boring but it held my attention enough. Would recommend to someone that is open-minded and doesn't mind the nudity and sex.",1500940800,,309,4.618181818181818
