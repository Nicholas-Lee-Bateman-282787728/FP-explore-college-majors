2350238,3,B000A1MVX8,"Bloody Moon is a foreign slasher flick from 1981 that has some great gore and nudity. However, the script and the dubbing are both atrocious. And the movie appears to not even have a plot until the surprise ending.",1295827200,,214,4.512820512820513
2350239,5,B000A1MVX8,"I knew nothing about Jess Franco.  I had seen this horror flick available on many bootleg dvdr sites before it had hit dvd not to long ago, but it never attracted me.  I'm going to be honest, I'm one of those that judge a movie by its cover most of the time.  by doing that, I've found out that most of the time I've been right on having that gut feeling that this is going to be a great or somewhat ok horror.  When the dvd of 'Bloody Moon' came out and I saw that wonderful cover art along with reading its plot on the back, it pulled me in and wouldn't let go!!!  This isn't a off-the-wall gore flick.  There are two great scenes for gorehounds and plenty of euro sleaze mixed with small amounts of blood here and there in between!  I always LOVE watching late 70's early 80's horrors anyway.  So for me, this is a treat!  Warning!....this flick is a little slow at times, but when it gets to the gore, it rewards you!  And yes, the stone-mill saw scene is the best!!!  The second best, which made my jaw drop, is the part where the killer runs over that poor little kid!!!!  Gotta love that horror sleaze!  Besides those who appreciate all types of horror,  'Bloody Moon' is only recommended to those with an open mind.  Enjoy!",1260057600,9,1231,4.245689655172414
2350240,4,B000A1MVX8,"Another video nasty! What a bad movie! But in a good way! It's very entertaining! Most of the acting is terrible, the dialogue is totally stupid, all of the female characters (except the main one) are dumb sluts (and I mean it! They only think and talk about sex!) and all of these things make the movie hilarious! Oh and it's also pretty damn gory! The circular saw decapitation scene is awesome!",1259280000,2,397,4.527777777777778
2350241,4,B000A1MVX8,"Naked school girls get stabbed,strangled and sawed(in case you didn't notice the cover art).Primo Eurotrash directed by Jess Franco has all the qualities of its so bad it's good and really funny too in that unintentionalkind way...hmmm and I get the feeling that Jess Franco may have been on the joke with us! One example of this is when the killer has one victim(lets the killer tie her up without putting up a fight at all,'I'm ready to die now Mr. Killer')on a stone mill power saw and a 10 year old boy who is hiding in some bushes witnessing this event take place,comes out of the bushes and turns off the saw,the killer then pushes the boy out of the way and turns the saw back on,the boy kicks the killer in the ankle and runs away. After the saw decapitates the victim,(mannequin)some time later he gets in his car and finds the boy still running down a wide open road. You can guess what happens next. If you enjoy horror movies such as 'Pieces','Friday the 13th','Maniac',pick up this sleaze fest that has all the depraved traits you could ask for that include gore,gratuitous nudity,violence,incest,voyeurism and yes... roller disco! Goes well with any slasher collection.",1229817600,12,1183,4.747572815533981
2350242,4,B000A1MVX8,"This movie is just plain awesome. One of the best Franco movies I've seen since Faceless.  I love it.  Great looking girls, better gore than Devil Hunter, way better gore.  Some awesome death scenes.  This movie is just what you would want from an 80's slasher sleaze movie.  The bad point, the peeping Tom dude got very old.  Too much peeping in the movie, need more death scenes to keep the pace moveing.  The middle act is slow until the circle saw scene.  Plus you hardly ever see kids die in movies anymore. Franco does this one poor boy in pretty good with a car.  Please see this movie.  Remember the middle act is very slow.  The beginning and end are AWESOME!!!  Two thumbs up for the music as well.",1227398400,3,708,4.361538461538461
2350243,3,B000A1MVX8,"Bloody moon is a Spanish slasher flick from 1981. It's like a refreshing version of Friday the 13th with bad dubbing, nonsensical dialogue and bad editing. The film is so hilarious, it's set in a language school where the girls talk endlessly about boys, ""Antonio is the best lover on campus...you can have a go of him if you like"" the boys say things like ""oh baby, I want you to melt in my arms"".

The best moment, however is when a girl is picked up in a car by a man in a mask. He takes her to an old mill and ties her to a table connected to a buzzsaw. Only when he switches on the saw does she finally get suspicious.

It's a trash movie addicts delight, but others beware.",1211587200,25,679,4.097744360902255
2350244,2,B000A1MVX8,"Jess Franco always makes weird stuff.  This does not dissapoint.  It's not great, but it's a decent film.  If you go in not expecting too much you may enjoy it.",1050105600,,160,4.266666666666667
2350245,3,B000A1MVX8,"A disfigured, sexually frustrated, incest inclined psycho Miguel (Alexander Waechter), while wearing a mask seduces a
party guest.  But when she removes the mask and screams at his disfigured face, he then proceeds to brutally stab her to
death with a pair of scissors.
Five years later, supposedly cured, he is released from a psychiatric institute, and returns with his sister, Manuela (Nadja
Gerganoff), to the family owned land and languages school.  Where they live with their greedy, spiteful, wheelchair bound
aunt (Maria Rubio).  Who is convinced that Manuela is only after her money, when she intends to leave it all to Miguel.  Soon
after this an unseen assailant turns the moaning old hag into a human candle.
A quartet of voluptuous young girls gather at the school, taking their lessons and allowing themselves to be seduced by the
on campus Spanish gigolo.  All of course under the eyes of Miguel.
The girls then begin to get slaughtered one by one.  The first one actually killed in the presence of the lead girl Angela (Olivia
Pascal).  When the cadaver of this dead friend disappears, nobody believes Angela when she says this happened.  They all
put it down to her reading scary books late at night.
But the corpses keep flooding in, with one girl being chopped up with a giant buzz saw, another being choked, and the
unplanned massacre of a voyeur, which is a total shock to the system!
Along comes the Grande Guinol final, with knifes, chainsaws and skewers, for a totally sticky ending.
A standard entry in the horror genre, even with the twist in the tale at the end.  Which is not entirely unpredictable, but at
least an effort was made to make the film not just a straightforward, slash and stalk revenge piece.  This one coming about
at the same time as the early Friday The 13th movies (only the first of which had any real innovation) and The Burning,
which was a Friday The 13th clone made in the same year as Friday The 13th.
I think a great deal of the gore in this film was lost in the version I saw, running at 79 minutes.  Sliced up more than the
victims in the film by, those fanatics at the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC).  The version I saw looking like it has
lost about five minutes of footage.
Absolutely tons and tons of zooms in this one.  Franco uses his zooms as a way to save money and time.  Instead of doing
three camera set ups for three different shots he sets the camera up once, and will proceed to zoom in on the subject at
several different distances, saving a hell of a lot of money and time in the process, but occasionally inducing nausea in the
viewer.
The dodgy disco soundtrack does not sit as well as the directors choice of jazz soundtrack does in say Vampyros Lesbos
1970.  But I think a hell of a lot of films at the time, had disco soundtracks, which we look at as dodgy now, but were
probably really cool (groovy!) at the time, so I guess in this respect the soundtrack isn't out of place, but it still sounds
weird!
All of the night time scenes in the film were actually shot at night, unlike in Oasis Of The Zombies 1981, where they were
annoyingly shot day for night, and as a consequence Bloody Moon looks a lot better than Oasis does.
If you are viewing the film for gore and nudity (why else would you? Unless of course you are a Jess Franco fan like me!) try
and find an uncut 84 minute version.  The crap UK ""VIPCO Video"" BBFC sliced version I saw pretty much cut all of the gore
out, and well reading about the film, it sounds as if there is some of the nudity missing too.  So for blood freaks and breast
fiends (now there's a movie title for you!) seek out the uncut version.",1022284800,,3663,4.451420029895366

8072351,2,B000A1MVX8,"I think if it wasn't for the fame that being a ""video nasty"" brought
it, ""Bloody Moon"" wouldn't be enjoying anything like the longevity it
currently has. Set in a Spanish language school for girls (how
original), the story sees our heroine Angela in peril as her friend
begin to die around her, and nobody believes her. Suspects are all over
the place, one gory murder follows another until the truth is revealed.
The thin plot is a threadbare mechanism with only enough substance to
it to drive the most basic of story events, and all attempts to
generate mystery and tension fall completely flat. A lot of this is due
to the English language soundtrack which has the most inept dubbing
I've seen for a long time. There's an excess of ""sexy"" giggling and
gossiping that goes with every scene of the female cast members, unless
they are being stalked or terrorised, in which case it changes to an
excess of screaming and wailing. None of the vocal performances match
what the actresses appear to be saying in the slightest. Trying to work
out whodunnit is hampered by the appalling direction, in which red
herring characters pop up and down every few moments before and after a
murder scene, making you wonder if anything you are seeing is by design
or just random.

Truly awful film-making is here in abundance, in such scenes as the one
where Inga is merrily driven to a saw mill and tied up, gabbling the
entire time, or the one in which Angela sees a shadow on the wall,
walks backwards (??) towards it and stabs the figure hysterically and
then runs off, or the one where a snake dangles into view and is
snipped to death by hedge cutters, or the one where a huge foam rock
bounces out of nowhere to menace Angela, or all the time we spend
watching the girls in their language class and nothing actually
happens, or the one with Inga (again - she's particularly bad) bouncing
on her bed pretending to be having sex, with a dead body in her
wardrobe that it would be impossible for her not to notice, and many,
many more. The only strength the film could possibly claim to have is
the graphic gore, but these scenes are also pretty poorly done. Some
work well for being crudely violent (the sawmill decapitation and the
knife through breast killing), but the death by neck- clamp is
blatantly out of focus, and most of the others are amateurishly
accomplished.

If you only want to see a lot of boobs and blood, plus some of the
worst 80's knitwear ever put on celluloid, then treat yourself.
Otherwise, this is almost laughably terrible. Even the soundtrack,
which underscores the drama with lots of deep ""bloop-bloop"" noises is
unforgivable. The 2 stars are for the saw mill murder as it has become
almost iconic, and at least the film has enough energy not to be
boring.",1489881600,,2777,4.56312625250501

8072354,5,B000A1MVX8,"This is a slasher flick that takes far too much time getting down to the business at hand..........wholesale slaughter.
The story begins with a prologue featuring the stabbing of a girl by a disfigured man.  He hacks her up with a pair of scissors and before you can say whoops, it's off to the loony bin for him, for a mere five years, then he's released into the care of a sister he's had unsisterly relations with in their sordid youth.  She takes him to the most logical place to recoup, a boarding school for young women!!!  This killer quickly forms an unnatural interest in one of the women (Olivia Pascal as Angela).  He spies, stalks, and sneaks around her, gawking in a manner most foul.  Finally, a murder is committed on campus, in Angela's bungalow.  From that point on, she becomes the girl who cried MURDER!!!  She boo-hoos to anyone who'll listen, a girl has been killed.  But where's the body?  Where's the blood?  Is someone trying to gaslight her?  As more girls go missing and still no one seems overly concerned, will Angela ever figure out that she might be talking to the wrong people?

The deaths range from the expected/typical to inspired and grotesque.  This film not only dares to kill a child, a (real) snake loses its head during a pivotal scene.  Did PETA know about this?  Is there a statute of limitations on snake killing?

The acting is marginal, the dubbing is hilariously dreadful, the dialog is ridiculous, the situations/plot is hopelessly
limited..........  It has been done before, but definitely not like this.  I'm still trying to decide if that is a good thing or not.  (It most certainly makes this the guiltiest of guilty pleasures.)
I have to say I love the audacity involved.",1433376000,2,1723,4.683333333333334

8072357,4,B000A1MVX8,"If you're any kind of film fan of the 1970s and/or 1980s, chances are you know the name Jess Franco.  Dubbed by many as the King of Euro-Sleaze, Franco has made many movies, both good and terrible.  BLOODY MOON is his foray into slasher flicks, and for its time, it certainly does not disappoint.  Theres plenty of blood, some very nice gore, and a decent body count; the result is a classic slasher that every horror fan should own.

I had not seen this prior to getting it on Blu-ray, but Im glad I was able to watch it in HD.  Ive read comments about previous versions in different formats that had grainy pictures, poor sound, and even skips.  Not to mention others were edited so badly the story made no sense.  But this is the complete, uncut version with a great picture and great sound.  This is the way you want to watch movies.

BLOODY MOON is shot pretty well overall.  There are a few camera angles that made me scratch my head, but I do like how the cinematographer lets the audience look through the killers eyes frequently.  To me, this heightens the suspense and makes me even more curious as to who it is.

The story is a nice mystery thriller that adds family drama to the slasher aspect.  I am not giving anything away here by describing it this way, because you probably won't be able to tell who the killer is before the big reveal.  I sure didn't see it coming, although thinking back, I feel like maybe I should have.  Still, its a nice surprise and made me grin.

The gore in BLOODY MOON is top notch.  I have to give props to Franco for attempting to show what he does in this film.  Granted, the special effects are a bit dated (youll see what I mean when you watch them), but they still look great onscreen.  I particularly like the stone mill power saw decapitation.  Although you can tell from a point that it is fake, it still looks phenomenal.  I backed up the scene a couple of times and rewatched it again.

BLOODY MOON won't be for everyone, but if you like vintage horror, then this is a Must See.  Be sure and check it out on Blu-ray so you can enjoy the enhanced picture and sound; its definitely the way to watch this one.  The film hits store shelves in a couple of weeks, so make a note.",1402358400,3,2227,4.28537170263789
