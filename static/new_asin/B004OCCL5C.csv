8437147,3,B004OCCL5C,"Slime City is one of my favorite trash movies of all time, but I feel this bluray release is over priced. Camp Motion Pictures used the exact same HD master that was used on the 2006 DVD release of Slime City, instead of creating a brand new master for this release. It's definitely an upgrade over the DVD, but I wasn't blown away by it. This movie could have benefited from a brand new 2k or 4k transfer, instead they used an archaic, outdated, transfer created 10 years ago and slapped it onto a bluray disc. Really lazy work by Camp Motion Pictures, if you're a fan of this movie and can get it for a decent price, you should pick it up. Don't pay $34.95 for it like I did.",1518393600,,677,4.175572519083969
8437148,5,B004OCCL5C,Slime city is awesome for a low budget movie but what was more entertaining was naked fear which was in the bonus hopefully its still on this Blu-ray  as well since nobody talks about the bonus features  in there review,1484179200,,219,4.45
8437149,3,B004OCCL5C,"The movies are fine, and I really like the original Slime City.... but the price or this set is ludicrous.  The films have been out before and I have to say this upgrade is simply not worth the extra funds.  Companies need to seriously stop this nonsense.  No need to do this to fans over and over again.  BluRay's are getting cheaper to make, and there is no need for a company like this or Vestron or anyone else to charge so much and disrespect fans.  We have bought the VHS, DVD and the special edition DVDs... give us a break.  NO one can afford this!  We are all out here in a terrible economy trying to make ends meet and this unending over charging has to stop.  I really enjoy Slime City and I think it could have been done better on BluRay, but if you can find this at a decent price, I suggest grabbing it for fans of indie Horror and gore.",1483833600,,851,4.115151515151515
8437150,5,B004OCCL5C,"""Slime City Massacre"" is a Marvelous Horror Flik, Gifted to US by Brilliant Film-Maker GREG LAMBERSON ! The Slime, the Gore, the Bloodshed, & The LADIES are All Top-Shelf ! It works as a Sequel & a Stand-Alone MasterPiece !!!
  The Beautiful Women are Headed by the world's Most Under-Rated Actress, DEBBIE ROCHON, who plays ""Alice"", who is both a Victim & a Tormentor ! JENNIFER BIHL is ""Alexa"", the Focus of the Film . Stacked & Lovely BROOKE LEWIS is a Down-Trodden ""Nicole""; & MARY BOGLE is the Wise ""Swan' ! SEPHIRA GIRON is ""Ruby"", & Stunning Young SANDRA ROLAND is ""Lizzie"" !!! The other ladies are also attractive & talented !
  LEE PERKINS as ""Mason"" & CRAIG SABIN as ""Zachery"" head the talented Male Actors; & a Fabulous Performance by JOHN RENNA as the ""Mayor"" stands out, as the the role of his Replacement BOB BOZEK as the ""New Mayor of Slime City"" !!! The rest of the Cast Excels in their Performances !
  There is one particular Great Scene that I have to reference. That is the Meeting of Ms. Rochon's ""Alice"" & a Slime City ""Hooker"" portrayed by an Un-Credited ANGELINA LEIGH ! It's a Sick little Twist that leaves itself open to many jokes & innuendos ! Another High-Light is the Disposal of the Famous [or Infamous] Head of TROMA Movies, Uncle LLOYD KAUFMAN ! This may be solution that many have been asking for !!!
  ""Slime City Massacre"" is now out on a Double Billed Blu-Ray with the Original ""Slime City"", also Directed by GREG LAMBERSON !!!
That's the Deal of the Year !!!",1482796800,,1496,4.514814814814815
8437151,5,B004OCCL5C,"AWESOME MOVIE!!! And super nice transfer. last night was my first time ever seeing this film and if you ask me, this is like a BETTER version of street trash. Really cool storyline too. It's like basket case And street trash had a baby. Definitely worth the $34.95 and I haven't even watched the sequel yet",1481760000,4,306,4.482142857142857
8437152,1,B004OCCL5C,"Greg Lamberson's 1988 cult-classic, SLIME CITY, has oozed its way in to the hearts of Horror fan with its over-the-top humor and outrageous gore, so the announcement of a sequel some twenty years later came as a shocking surprise. The film itself, unfortunately, isn't quite as welcome. New York City has been devastated by a dirty bomb, leaving only a few mangled survivors to struggle on in the wasted remains of ""Slime City."" Cory and Alexa decide take refuge here while avoiding the draft, but in their search for food, they come across a secret stash of unexpirable yogurt and elixir that were left behind by a death cult decades earlier. After sharing the food with another pair of squatters, the four are transformed into gooey superheroes of sorts, who hit the streets to clean up crime in Slime City! SLIME CITY MASSACRE is an absolute mess, and a bore to watch. The frequent flashbacks only detract from the film, and add no greater depth to the series, whatsoever. Although it hardly seems possible, the awful make-up work and bargain-basement effects are even worse than before, with a surprising lack of splatter until the final reel. Cory and Alexa are hardly compelling characters, and any attempts at social commentary fall flat. It begs the question ""Why?"" What was so important about this story that the filmmakers felt they had to make a sequel? Lloyd Kaufman's ""Special Disappearance"" at the start of the film should clue you in to the target audience, but most will find SLIME CITY MASSACRE to be a disappointing waste of time.

8437153,5,B004OCCL5C,"Someone just left a comment below because that person thought that this review had some spoilers, so be aware of that if you want to read this. This film has a faster pace and a much higher body count than the first one, but it lacks some things that the original had.  It doesn't have the great synthesizer score of the first, and another thing that is disappointing compared to the first film is the ending.  The original SLIME CITY had a great over the top gruesome ending where the slime man is butchered by his girlfriend, but the ending gore scene on this film doesn't compare to that scene at all.  However, this film has a higher budget than the original, and the replay value is better because of the films faster pace. The simple to follow story involves a group of survivors (some good and some bad) in a abandoned and decrepit building complex that used to be the home of an evil alchemist, and then some of them then find an elixir and yogurt which was developed by that evil wizard. These magical potions turn whoever consumes them into evil slime people; they ooze slime and some of their insides become creatures. The slime people are colorful with different slime colors; they kind of look like something out of a comic book. It's obvious that THE THING had some influence here with the scenes when their torso's open up with those rows of sharp teeth and the climax when the brains crawl out of those peoples heads. Basically, the entire film takes place in this abandoned building which provides the film with loads of decrepit scenery; having almost the entire film taking place in this one place may be good or bad depending on your taste. With the exception of some parts, most of the film is fast paced. It's also well directed and pretty well acted. There are some bits that are a little bit talky, but most of the film isn't high dialogue. You don't have to see the first SLIME CITY first because this film is really more of a remake. Just like a FRIDAY THE 13TH film, RESIDENT EVIL and other films like that, you can just turn your brain off and watch it because it's simple and you don't really have to pay attention to it. There's plenty of oozing slime for people who like those slimy types of films, some cool gore scenes, and some good action. The film is really gory in some parts, but it doesn't have non-stop gore from beginning to end; if you want something that's overloaded with gore, you might want to try something else. The first SLIME CITY didn't have any nudity, but this one has a little that's not explicit. There's only a little topless nudity, and the film contains no explicit sex. Since the replay value is high, I'll give it 5 stars like the first SLIME CITY; even though I still think the first one is a little better, but I think most people who are fans of mainstream horror will like this one better because it feels much more modern and has a higher budget.

The DVD quality is very good, and it's a 2 DVD set with plenty of extras.",1343952000,,2986,4.423636363636364
8437154,3,B004OCCL5C,"Indie film is alive and well, and as fun as ever. The effects are amusingly gross, the in jokes abound, and gifted horror author Kealan Patrick Burke makes an understated but impressive cinematic debut in a major role. This one needs a second viewing--the commentary track is a blast as director Greg Lamberson and his leading ladies fill us in on the behind the scenes chaos. Anyone who doesn't get the movie didn't get the 80's.",1307836800,2,430,4.671052631578948
8437155,5,B004OCCL5C,"What can I say about SCM? The original had a bit of a cult following. A good job for a low budget independent film. Then they made the sequel and blew it out of the water. You do not need to have seen the original to like this one, but if you did, it will most definitely enhance as the continuuity between the 2 is pretty tight. Great story, strong performances, and just a fun time throughout. Personal favorite was a unique kill involving a couple of bodies. And look for the quick homage to genre favorite films Basket Case and Street Trash (it took me the third viewing to catch it). Indie-film making at its finest, pure and simple.",1305849600,3,638,4.325
8437156,5,B004OCCL5C,I had the privilege of viewing this at a convention last year and to say me and my husband was blown away would be an understatement!  We had the most fun with this slimy treat!!  If you are looking for a movie for flick night that will keep you engrossed and entertained from opening to end credits this flick is for YOU!!  Slip and slide your way on over to the order button and give yourself or a loved the gift of Slime.......City Massacre that is!  The gift that keeps on giving!!,1304035200,5,485,4.239130434782608
