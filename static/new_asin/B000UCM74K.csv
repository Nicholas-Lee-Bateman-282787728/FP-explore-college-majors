'Jhoom Barabar' is an overall entertaining film of serendipity and kismet unfolding between two strangers who happen to meet at a busy cafe while waiting for a train. A conversation soon ensues and to pass the time they attempt to impress each other by making up an imaginary, romantic tale. They both claim to be waiting for their future mate and express how deliriously happy they are. As you might expect in the course of events they fall in love with each other during the wait and now must swallow their pride and find a way express their true feelings for each other. Neither wanting to let the other know their stories where made up they arrange to meet again and bring along their significant others. Will they continue their mutual charades and lose each other forever or will they find the courage to express their true feelings for each other?

Abhishek Bachchan (Rikki) and Preity Zintal (Alvira) do a solid and believable job of portraying two chance, smitten romantics but I actually preferred the performances of Lara Dutta and Bobby Deol as their make believe lovers. However what really made the movie for me was the four or five intermittent appearances by the legendary Amitabh Bachchan in the whimsical role of a dancing, singing sprite who apparently has some mystical cupid-like connection with the budding relationship between Rikki and Alvira.

Solid production values, recognizable cast and an excellent soundtrack make 'Jhoom Barabar' and easy and enjoyable watch. My rating: -3 Stars-.",1263859200,,1574,5.0
8212929,3,B000UCM74K,"Not the best Bollywood film ever but entertaining to say the least. The music is good but repetitive. Abishek and Preity are pretty good opposite each other but again, the plot is pretty off the wall.",1254873600,2,200,4.583333333333333
8212930,3,B000UCM74K,"The opening item of this really lifts your expectations - good choreography, catchy tune, Amitabh Bachchan doing a guest lead item stint.
The story then moves into what turns out to be 2 peoples fantasies. This is part is done in a stereotypes cartoon style with some hammy acting. Not knowing at this point it was a fantasy section it just looks badly acted and the songs corny with the catchy 'Ticket to Bollywood' with corny lyrics.
Then we get into reality and it settles down and becomes a reasonable entertainer. overall. It's opening song 'Jhoom Barabar' is repeated several times (when you are on a good thing...)
This is where I was introduced to both Bobby Deol and Abhishek Bachchan and was an early Bollywood I saw. I have followed both with interest after this taste (even though they have done a lot more interesting stuff elsewhere).
It has some good dance and catchy music and I thought more highly of it after realizing the hammy acting early on was for a reason in the fantasy context. Not the best Bollywood but I've held onto it and will revisit sometime - a bit of light fun for a diversion.",1231200000,,1112,4.565
