895597,5,6304507216,"another movie I found when just renting videos. I figured it was not your average cowboy. It has romance and action
I would recommend it to anyone that enjoys westerns with a different twist.",1395619200,4,191,4.647058823529412
895598,4,6304507216,"I have been watching Sidney Poitier since ""Lilies of the Field""on the big screen. Sidney in a western is fun to watch.",1376265600,,118,4.409090909090909
895599,3,6304507216,This was a good movie. The reason I bought this was because of Farrah Fawcett was in it. It wasn't that bad.,1370736000,,108,3.9545454545454546
895600,4,6304507216,This is one of my favorites still to this day but does not top the original TV mini series as many parts were cut to shorten the time for this movie.,1365292800,,149,3.838709677419355
895601,3,6304507216,"Beautiful, romantic, sad movie that I personally found more entertaining than the book. Probably because both works focus on and develop different characters.
A part of U.S. history that none of us should ignore or forget about...",1360972800,3,230,5.243243243243243
895602,1,6304507216,"I ended up deleting this book from my kindle before I finished it I just couldn't stand the endless loops of circumstance, and very sporatic action.
This book is an absolute waste of money.  Do yourself a kindness and pass on this golden oppertunity",1346889600,,249,4.659090909090909
895603,5,6304507216,"The movie arrived before I expected it. It
was in perfect shape and was exactly what
I ordered. I knew the movie had been cut
from the mini-series, but I didn't realize how
much had been cut.
 Definitely not what I remembered
as a great show. That, however; was not the
fault of the shipper. I would absolutely order
again from this site.",1332201600,3,338,4.365079365079365
895604,5,6304507216,"I enjoyed this movie for its closeness to the true west(according to the history books I have read)events during the westward expansion.  It was not for the squeamish in that the violence ,though not graphic,was none the less, gut wrenching and disturbing. To think that these things happened,and are still happening,gives one a heavy heart. The Performances were professional and the actors could have been the characters themselves.",1330128000,3,434,5.382352941176471
895644,2,6304507216,"I was so excited when I saw that Children of the Dust was now available.  I should have realized by the changed name that this would be an edited version.  I can only hope that with all the complaints that the full version of this great mini series will be released by the studios in the near future.  Until then, I am glad I taped it when it was on TV so I can enjoy it in its entirety.",1318982400,3,387,3.8734177215189876
895645,5,6304507216,"Sidney Poitier, as usual done a outstanding job of acting in this movie. This movie I believe shows the truth concerning the problem the upper hand race display their authority over any race of people different then their own. It's so real and the action is outstanding. Sidney Poitier, just continue to impress me no matter what movie he protrays in.",1283644800,2,351,4.770491803278689
895646,5,6304507216,"This was an Excellent Mini Series, back in 1995 I have been looking for a place to buy the "" Whole mini series "" for many years...I have Never forgotten the impact of this movie. And I would like my 4 children to be able to watch with me as adults. I hope that Hallmark will box it in a mini series form and Sell it. Thank you.",1231804800,,327,3.823529411764706
895647,5,6304507216,"I live in the US but have the Region 2 DVD which runs at 175 minutes instead of the 120 minutes like the ones sold here.  I wanted this movie so badly I took a chance on e-bay a few years ago and bought it from someone in the UK.  Guess what?  It works great on my DVD player.  Apparently, if you are lucky, you can get a DVD player that plays the Region 2 DVD's.  My DVD player is a JVC that I bought at Circuit City a few years ago.  I was so glad because I couldn't stand the thought of getting the watered down version.",1184025600,2,523,3.7962962962962963
895648,5,6304507216,"its wonderful story,almost like my own;-)but what upseting ,on my video the moovie is not complete,there is parts missing. I saw complete version on TV.Worth watching anyway!",1108425600,2,174,5.481481481481482
895649,4,6304507216,"I watched this mini series when it first aired and loved it!  I've been hoping whoever decides to put this stuff on dvd would come to their senses and put the 4 hour mini-series on dvd, instead of this watered down version they are selling, A Good Day to Die.  I have seen Children of the Dust dvds offered on ebay but they are like region 2 or 4 and won't play on US/Canada dvd players.  It almost makes me want to invest in an all region dvd player!!!",1096848000,8,453,4.067415730337078
895650,3,6304507216,"As the four hour Children of the Dust on television, this was an exciting and poignant story. However, for the video and DVD release, it was edited down to just two hours. Too many of the important scenes were cut, and what was left made almost no sense. I want the complete movie on DVD!",1027296000,52,288,4.254545454545455
895651,5,6304507216,"When this movie first aired as a television two-night series, it was called ""Children Of the Dust"". By the first commercial break, most of my friends and family were tuned in. We would make 3 and 4 way calls during every break. By the end we were all in tears, and laughter, and talked about the movie for weeks. I have searched since 1995 for the movie, not knowing the name had been changed to ""A Good Day To Die"". My aunt even recorded a re-airing of the movie, but it recorded nothing but the sound. Believe it or not, we have gotten together dozens of times to watch a static-filled screen and listen to the movie, remembering how wonderful it was. This is definitely a good purchase if you like epic romance and wild-west action. We give it twenty enthusiastic thumbs up!",1022976000,8,777,4.440559440559441
895652,4,6304507216,"Great movie! I saw the TV mini-series entitled, ""Children of the Dust."" The quality of this movie, reminds me of the movies done by Hallmark Hall of Fame. A Hallmark example, would be ""The Secret  Garden."" You might even call ""A Good Day to Die"" a period  piece. Don't let the title fool you. A must have for any movie collection!",944611200,9,330,4.39344262295082

7873615,5,6304507216,"I remember watching this mini series back in 1995, and totally falling in love with it. Since then, I had always been searching for it. I wish they would release the WHOLE thing, not just the condensed version of 2 hours. This was a mini series, over 3 days, I believe, and we'd love to see the whole thing again. Toby and Rachel's love story was beautiful and tragic.",1516752000,,368,4.3478260869565215
7873616,5,6304507216,"The first time i ever saw this movie was on a television mini series under a different name. It was called Children of the Dust !!! not a good day to die, but when i read what the movie was i knew it was the same movie and i had to have it!! I absolutely loved that movie on t.v. i was so excited to watch it again. My excitement was crumbled when they cut a 3 hour movie into a 2 hour movie. It was still good to see and i suppose if i had never seen it on tv i would have loved it. Danny Glover is fabulous as always in this movie. I hate telling people what a movie is about, i think it spoils it. I'll just say it's about Danny Glover character who saves an Indian boy who's family and tribe is all massicured and leaves him with a white family to be raised. His native american name is white wolf and his white name becomes Toby. Toby grows up easy on the eyes ladies!!! and falls in love with his white sister Rachel. A whole storm of things happen because of this. The end of this movie leaves you on the edge of your seat and or like me, balling your eyes out!!!! Its such a great movie!!! A must see !!!!!",1513382400,,1114,3.8903508771929824
