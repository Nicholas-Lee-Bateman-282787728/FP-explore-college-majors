7305959,4,B0107GC2AM,"Overall a great movie.  Anything with Lance in it is going to get me to watch.  The overall premise was not new, but they executed it well.  I agree with others that this was kindof a throwback to The Thing.  Even in one of the scenes where they were in the engine room, off to the side you can see a Chess Wizard game.  The same game that Kurt Russel played in The Thing.  Little details like this is why I love movies like this.  Enjoy!",1439078400,,438,4.023255813953488
7305960,4,B0107GC2AM,"If The Thing, both original and John Carpenters brilliant remake, had never been made, Harbinger Down would rate five stars and everyone would be talking about it.

This is sorta sad because HB features high production values, great special effects (the practical old fashion way monsters used to be made before CGI), and the cast is a clutch of not widely known actors all of whom turn in impressive performances.

(Actually one actor is very well known, Lance Henriksen, who turns in a performance almost as winning as that noble artificial who is torn in half in Aliens.)

HD is also remindful of Virus (monsters are loosed on a ship) and Aliens (a magnificent homage is played out in Harbinger's bilge) but the film doesnt really feel like a rip/knock off of any of those earlier movies.

HD captures our willing suspension of havent-I-seen-this-before; so I must now feel disappointed because writer/director Alec Gillis has concocted a sci-fi/ horror/thriller that delivers 82 minutes of a unique chilling delight without prompting that nasty backward glance.",1438992000,,1065,5.103448275862069
7305961,3,B0107GC2AM,"It was low budget, poorly acted and terrible plot points, characters were pretty bad and the background music was sorely missing. All of that being said I liked the effects, it was nice to see real special effects again, it paid some respect to The Thing, and it was dark. For a first attempt at movie making I give it a 3, if it was the 10th go it would have fared much worse. Watch it, support it, but just don't expect a lot from it.",1438992000,,436,4.0813953488372094

7305963,4,B0107GC2AM,"Harbinger Down began back in 2013 on Kickstarter and was pitched by Alec Gillis as ADI's answer for fans who love Practical Effects on film, but felt let down by the current trend to CGI everything. ADI has done a ton of effects in the film industry, but when doing the prequel to John Carpenter's The Thing their work was heavily covered in CGI and that was the spark that ignited this passion project. With funds raised on Kickstarter and mixed with their own blood, sweat and tears they would deliver a full feature that harkens back to the golden age of Practical Effects. Now jump forward to 2015 and Harbinger Down is here for the fans to enjoy.

A group of grad students have booked passage on the fishing trawler Harbinger to study the effects of global warming on a pod of Orcas in the Bering Sea. When the ships crew dredges up a recently thawed piece of old Soviet space wreckage, things get downright deadly. It seems that the Russians experimented with tardigrades, tiny resilient animals able to withstand the extremes of space radiation. The creatures survived, but not without mutation. Now the crew is exposed to aggressively mutating organisms. And after being locked in ice for 3 decades, the creatures aren't about to give up the warmth of human companionship.

I think it should go without saying that Harbinger Down delivers on the FX. From fantastic miniature usage to the creature FX, it is all top notch. There are some spots where digital FX were used to augment some of the effects, but it in no way down plays or ruins the awesomeness of what is being shown. The creatures were amazing and each creature scene felt like a love letter to Rob Bottin (John Carpenter's The Thing). On the FX front this movie was perfection in every sense of the word.

Alec Gillis does an outstanding job as both writer and director of the film. The story flows naturally and doesn't come off at any point as a contrived unrealistic series of events. What is even more amazing is the fact that this is Gillis' first feature in the director's chair. His first outing comes off as if he is a seasoned pro who has been directing his whole life, not just creating amazing FX.  Working hand-in-hand with Gillis is DP Benjamin Brown who pulls off some gnarly shots and paints a picture that many a horror fan can truly appreciate.

The cast of the film is another area where Harbinger Down shines bright. Lance Henriksen steals the show, just like he has for years. The man could not deliver a bad performance if he tried. His character of Graff/Pop-Pop is played so perfectly that you'd believe Lance Henriksen lived as a crab fishing captain in another life. Adding to the quality of the film is Camille Balsamo as Sadie. She shines just as bright as Lance and brings a softness that every horror film needs to succeed. Matt Winston plays the dickish University Professor to a tee and delivers one of those performances that has you begging for the character to die slowly. The rest of the cast delivers in their respective roles also and by no means should they feel under played.

With all that said my only complaint is this, I wish it was longer. It's not often you get to see a film that gives you a real thrill and when you get that feeling you just want it to last for as long as possible. Also I wouldn't have mined more character development/back story for Big G and Svet, they really become more interesting as the film progresses.

7305965,4,B0107GC2AM,"While I did enjoy this film I couldn't help thinking this has to be an unauthorized remake of (The Thing) only this time it takes place on a ship named The Harbinger. It was fun and I really liked the old school practical creature effects. Maybe it was just a huge homage.

(Lance Henriksen) as The Captain is always a joy to watch. Even at age 75 he can still kick butt. The fact that it was so much like The Thing (the original no less)doesn't mean it wasn't a good film because it's quite good, especially for the budget which I'm sure wasn't big. Although the production value was very good as well. But let's face it there will never be another film like John Carpenter's 1982 film, TheThing!

There was quite a nice amount of suspense and action. There was also a lot of creature effects and some nice gore.plus there is a twist that turns a really bad situation to an even worse situation. I would definately recommend this film to horror\SciFi lovers.",1438905600,21,959,4.443181818181818

The scene switches to today, off the shores of Alaska, and the ocean craft / crab boat of the title. We're introduced to the rag-tag crew, led by Captain Graff (Lance Henriksen- ALIENS, NEAR DARK, PUMPKINHEAD). They've taken on some scientists, who've come aboard to follow some beluga whales, for a climate change study. Not surprisingly, the Harbinger happens across the old satellite, frozen solid since it's crash, and loads it into the hold.

7305979,4,B0107GC2AM,"This movie is worth watching for monster movie fans and is head and shoulders above at least 95% of monster movies available on streaming. If you like monster movies and can catch this on Prime or Netflix it's not a waste of your time.

This movie plays as a fan's love letter to John Carpenter's 1981 film ""The Thing"", as the film's setting, overall story beats, and the monster itself borrow heavily from that classic film. Even this film's inception itself is due in no small part to the 1981 film.
In 2011 the production of a reboot/prequel to the classic film, also titled ""The Thing"" enlisted the talents of veteran special effects company K&B FX. The company created elaborate and highly impressive puppet/animatronic monsters for that film. However when the film was finally released all of their hard work had been completely replaced by computer simulated effects that were considered inferior by many.

Harbinger down was born from that frustration, the artists wanted to show that their approach to the monsters, that closer matched the original film's monsters, would have been superior. Therein lies the problem, the reason that the John Carpenter's 1981 film ""The Thing"" was so effective wasn't just because of its special effects, it was the overall combination of the story, pacing, acting and how those effects were filmed to give them their impact.

Harbinger Down's monster,unfortunately , isn't very convincing. There are many times when the monster's motion appears to be manipulated by strings and pieces of the monster flop around like the obvious rubber puppet that it is. If you freeze frame on any shot of the monster in action - it's highly impressive but in motion it's not quite so effective.

The fact that the monster can create convincing copies of the crew serves virtually no purpose in the Harbinger Down and only serves to highlight this film's vastly superior inspiration. The impersonators are quickly found out and the monster doesn't seem to do anything particularly suspenseful or interesting with its copies.  In the original ""Thing"" the creature could effectively impersonate crew member in order to separate them to more easily consume each person one by one. This created a sense of paranoia and tension that is nonexistent in Harbinger Down.",1514332800,,2288,5.042328042328043

Think of it as Alien on a crabbing boat.  There's characters to like and those you can't wait to see how they die.

7306005,4,B0107GC2AM,"...of John Carpenter's 1982 classic ""The Thing"".  Call it a love note, because that's exactly what Harbinger Down is.

Netflix, Amazon Prime and other streaming services are inundated with straight-to-video horror flicks.  In almost all cases, they are absolute garbage, but sometimes...rarely...one stands out from the rest.  Harbinger Down is one such example of a straight-to-digital release that's actually...well, enjoyable.  I dare say GOOD.  I legitimately enjoyed this movie from start to finish.

The similarities to Carpenter's horror legend are not at all meant to be a blatant copy.  The film is riddled with direct nods and homages to the 1982 film, and only true Thing fans will be able to spot all of the appreciative tributes.  Did you happen to notice the Chess Wizard?  How about the pose of the suited figure on the cover art here?  Yup...there's just two of the most obvious and noticeable tributes to The Thing.

The setting (sub-arctic north), the crew (made of multiple ethnicities from different countries) and the creature itself all scream ""Thing"" while managing to have an interesting plot with a few likable characters.  Lovers of practical effects rejoice as the film does an admirable job of creating a horrific alien monster brought to life only with practical effects.  Director Alec Gillis (yes, THAT Alec Gillis) seems to be apologizing for the overuse of CGI in the 2011 ""pre-make"" of The Thing, taking the opportunity to do what he does best with a very similar plot line - deliver horrific situations and a few legit scares relying only on practical, realistic effects.

The creature effects themselves were very good all around.  The actors were decent enough (though as always the legendary Lance Henriksen is a standout), and you can even grow to like a few of them.  The film itself was short however, and I didn't feel any significant attachment to any character outside of the main actress and Lance Henriksen's character.  The Thing managed to reel me in to care more about the characters in the film largely due to a longer running time (109 minutes vs Harbinger's 82 minutes).  It's also not perfect...the typical contrived situations, predictable deaths and forced character interactions drag the movie down into a few eye-rolling ""saw that coming"" moments.

With some great body horror moments thrown in, an almost Roger Corman-like pseudo-sexual death for one of the female characters, and horrific monsters showing up all over the place, this film will attract most Carpenter horror fans.  A mix mostly of The Thing, a touch of Alien and maybe a drop of Corman, and you have Harbinger Down.  Of all the ""dime-a-dozen"" horror flicks released over these years in the digital era, Harbinger Down is definitely one of my favorites.  Thing fans definitely check it out.

All that is compounded by the fact that the scripting and acting were cringe-worthy, the repetitive use of certain sound bytes made the film sound more like an old video game, and the plot tried to push emotional subplots down my throat with stereotypical, underdeveloped characters.

7306019,4,B0107GC2AM,"Inanimate aka Harbinger Down centers around a few grad students and their professor who have booked passage on a crab boat to study some wales. They soon discover something floating in the ice in the middle of the Bering Sea. Bringing it aboard to study was their first mistake. If the students and crew want to survive they will have to outsmart and fight against an organism they know nothing about.

This movie was made for those that love a good creature feature, B movies and other independent horror gems. Alec Gillis wrote and directed this fun and exciting crowd funded film. Think of it as John Carpenter's The Thing but on a boat. There's very little CGI. It concentrates on practical effects and you just don't see a lot of that any more. There's nothing wrong with the acting. The story runs at a quick pace. It's fun and entertaining, you can't really ask for much more.

However, as I am also a wannabe critic I have to point out a couple things I felt could have been improved upon. My only complaints, if you can call them that, are that I feel the movie maybe runs too quick at times. There's plenty of suspense, don't get me wrong, but I think there could have been some more had they drawn a few scenes out a little longer.  My other concern was the lighting. A few key scenes I felt were lit a little too low. For example, one of the main reveals of the creature, was just a little too dark.  It should have been a real ""Wow!"" moment and the low lighting made it a little less dramatic. However, I want to be clear that I am not talking about the kind of low lighting you see in some movies where it's literally so dark, you can't see anything.  You're supposed to be afraid but end up just getting angry at the movie because you can't see anything.  This isn't like that at all. The lighting I'm talking about wasn't bad or poor, it was just a bit too low in a few scenes in my opinion.

I highly recommend that you buy this film. There are so many bad horror movies out there made by people that just want to make a buck and have no appreciation for the genre. The producers of this film care about what they are making. In an industry dominated by bad CGI monsters and gore, these people specifically made this movie for those us that not only love a good creature feature but also love practical effects. I'm not saying it's the best movie ever. I'm just saying, it was, entertaining and made by people that not only have a long history in the business but also truly care about the genre.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Harbinger-Down/dp/B0107GC2AM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Harbinger Down</a>",1451606400,,2657,4.569327731092437

Basically, this movie is the crappy knock off of The Thing only on a fishing ship instead of a arctic research station. So many APPALLINGLY stupid choices are necessary to make the movie work. From ""scientists"" not understanding the concept of contamination to a moronically bad understanding of how international salvage laws work, it's just one bad move after another. Acting is wooden and it doesn't help that the writing they're going off of is painfully bad.

7306032,4,B0107GC2AM,"A kind of sea-fairing homage to and mash up of Howard Hawks' The Thing From Another World, Alien, and John Carpenter's The Thing. In fact, the events of Harbinger's prologue are dated ""June 25, 1982,"" which is the original release date of Carpenter's film. Plot-wise, however, the former more closely resembles the original version of The Thing than it does Carpenter's. Like both versions, it features an isolated arctic setting - always creepy. For fans, the movie includes one-liner homages to The Thing, Alien, and Jaws, as well as liberal use of practical FX clearly inspired by Rob Bottin. While certainly not as inventive as Bottin's (one could argue that nothing has been, given how truly groundbreaking his work in The Thing was), nor as well-budgeted,
they are nonetheless, quite good.
Harbinger is fun, above average, and worth a look for scifi horror fans. It's also kicked up a notch by the ever-reliable Lance Henriksen, who has a significant role, unlike some of the movies in which he ""stars"" but has little screen time.

One final note. No spoiler, I promise: the last shot is an impressively subtle but captivating visual metaphor for the story which precedes it - more inventive and thoughtful than I would normally expect even from most 5 star movies.",1446854400,,1271,4.9392523364485985

1. The only one to turn in a good performance in this otherwise shipwreck of a movie is Lance. The rest of the dialogue is atrocious, and the other characters are walking stereotype caricatures.

2. There is absolutely zero tension in the film, and the cheap jump scares can be seen coming from miles away. This is death for any horror movie.

3. The creature effects themselves, what we can see of them in the few brief moments they're actually shown, are idiotically lit with blinding strobe effects, presumably to keep the audience from picking apart the creature realism. Instead, it just makes the whole creature production look cheap. Which is a shame, considering the guys from this effects workshop are artists at the top of their game. First the producers of 'The Thing' 2011 prequel ditched their hard work in favor of predictably s***ty CGI, and now this.

The overall story for this film is pretty much their take on The Thing. After Universal screwed the studio over by replacing their practical effects work on 2011's The Thing with CGI, they more or less took to kickstarter to make their own version of that film done right.
 On a production level this film does deliver and offers up some cool looking mutations, but when it comes to the story it just lacks. The actors apart of this do a decent job, but the characters they play aren't that interesting. Even Lance Henriksen himself couldn't really help deliver with the main role he got.

7306041,4,B0107GC2AM,"Harbinger Down(released Aug/15)stars,among others,Lance Henriksen,Giovonnie Samuels and Matt Winston. This is a surprisingly good movie that stars old Lance, doing what he does best,those moody yet realistic type roles that he is known for. He is the star, but is ably backed by a group of acting up and comers.
The story finds Lance as an ailing captain of a crab trawler out of Dutch Harbour,Alaska. On this trip he is joined by his grand daughter and her professor who are there to study breeding beluga whales. The film opened as a Soviet spaceship from the 80s burned and crashed into the very area of the Bering Sea they are headed for. When she puts a camera down through the ice to see the whales, she spots something glowing in a nearby ice flow. They dredge it up and thaw it. Inside the space capsule is the dead pilot,well preserved and nothing else. They put it into the cargo hold. They start discussing the pros and cons of what to do with it when the professor starts going a little haywire. He eventually runs outside with just his shirt on screaming he is on fire. Back inside his skins starts erupting into different shapes and he soon dies. They quickly realize they have an airborne containment on board and that no one is safe.
Whatever the `virus`is the thawed space pilot is soon missing and their engineer is dead. Before they know it they have a full blown alien-like monster on the loose,who constantly changes and mutates. A Russian crew person they have on board comes to reveal that she was purposely put there to help find and retrieve the space capsule,if ever found. She also has planted explosives throughout the boat. The dead Soviet space pilot was injected with an experimental drug designed to help him adapt to radiation in space,which obviously had unexpected side effects.
At that moment the creature comes a calling and drags her off to oblivion. The crew then has to find the explosives and get rid of them if they can. They find them but the creature by now has overwhelmed all but the captain`s grand daughter. She is the only one who escapes;on to an ice flow as the boat careens into a berg,exploding and sinking into the sea.
The film moves along very well from scene to scene and the claustrophobic atmosphere is maintained throughout the film. This is The Thing(the Carpenter remake,not the original) meets Alien meets The Blob. There is a little bit of all these films in this one,while it retains its own raison d`etre. The creature effects are for the most part old school stuff. Actual made from the ground up plastics,vinyls and other synthetics,which works as well today as it did 20 years ago,and more. As a side bar,I knew that this film had gotten to Kickstarter ,but I must admit I lost track of it. I was glad to see they got it made and did it so well. Most of the money obviously went into the effects and Henriksen`s salary.
Technically speaking the film is clear and crisp in its w/s a/r. There are no extras.
All in all a very good film that is taut and moves along well. Henriksen and company sell it well and the ``old school`effects work wonderfully. Kudos to all involved. It was a film well worth getting made. 3 1/2-4 stars.",1446336000,,3196,4.589160839160839

7306060,4,B0107GC2AM,"Ok a little background on this film for those who don't know what it's about.

This movie was created by Studio ADI. The reason it's so similar to The Thing? Because Studio ADI did the practical effects for the 2011 prequel. Pretty much all of their scenes were cut and replaced with CGI because the director didn't think people would respond well to the practical effects. Studio ADI was screwed over by this little decision so they made their own film using ONLY practical effects. It's basically ""The Thing"" they wanted to make. It is an homage to The Thing because those guys all loved the movie and they loved the work they did. And they were screwed by big Hollywood. They made this movie to show that practical effects are still relevent and just as good if not better than CGI.

This movie is entirely crowdfunded. So to those idiots saying ""don't give your money to these rich hollywood people"". Wrong. This movie is fully independent and no one is getting rich off it. Lance Henrickson did this movie because he believes in practical effects and he's friends with the studio. He did this movie practically for free because he believed in what they were trying to accomplish. This film is the collaborative effort of 100's of passionate people who still believe practical effects have a place in the film industry.

It's not the greatest movie ever made and certainly not AAA blockbuster material, but for what it is, and for why it is; please give it a little more respect than, "" it sucks, oh its a rip off of the Thing"".

Instead this was more like a lackluster rehashing and--while I must admit I had A LOT OF FUN watching this flick--it failed in properly honoring anything of the aforementioned sacred horror canon.  But again, it remains a solidly entertaining way to spend 90 minutes of a monster movie lover's evening. Especially if you enjoy tentacle monsters and squishy effects.

The meager budget is evident from the opening sequence, featuring a space shape ""CGI-crashing"" through the Earth's atmosphere.  Not gonna' lieI wasn't impressed.  The film quality (to a trained eye anyway) offered further indications of financial constraints.  Worse yet, as we are introduced to the characters I feel I am also being introduced to writer/director Alec Gillis' first time writing.  I'm really not impressed.  But hold on just a second!  We're not here for CGI space ships, gorgeous film quality or Oscar-worthy scripts are we?  No.  We came here with the promise of creature effects.  So while I felt obligated to warn of the aforementioned flaws, these are not the kinds of flaws that should deter monster movie overs from watching this kind of movie.

The story follows an academic troupe (two grad students and their professor) who join the crew of the Harbinger, an Alaskan crabbing boat in the Bering Sea.  The scientists aim to study a pod of Beluga whales and how their biology has been affected by climate change.  After recovering some Soviet space wreckage embedded in an iceberg, the scientists' interest change. It seems that this Russian space crew was returning from a moon mission researching tardigrades (also known as water bears or Tardigrada; biology's most extreme environment-tolerant microorganisms known).

As quickly as characters are introduced, they find reasons to be catty or confrontational--not a good sign for when things undoubtedly take a bad turn later.  After recovering the contaminated wreckage, we get the news that radio and phone communication is down because of the approaching storm!  Making the smartest decision in the entire movie, the Harbinger's captain (Lance Henriksen; Aliens, AVP, The Pit and the Pendulum) orders that the wreckage be placed in the ship hold until they return to the mainland.  Much as in Species (1995) and Apollo 18 (2011), and much to the delight of horror fans, the astronauts were exposed and their remains are now thawing in the Harbinger's ship hold; safely away from the crew.  But of course, some scientists just can't wait and sneak down there.  Upon examination, the scientists and Harbinger crew are exposed to the tardigrades, which evidently mutate at an alarming rate, even hijacking and changing the DNA of those they infect.

First time writer/director Alec Gillis has had loads of experience with special effects: Aliens (1986), Leviathan (1989), Starship Troopers (1997), Evolution (2001), AVP: Aliens vs Predator (2004) and AVPR (2007) to name a few of his wins in terms of creature effects.  The effects in this film may roll a few unconvinced eyes, but he did all right with the creature effects.  The effects were abundant, often gross or somewhat disturbing, and quite squishy!  Contrastingly, Gillis has had no experience with writing or directing, so we hear terms like ""climate change"" thrown around a dozen times among a sea of stale line delivery.  We even endure a crooked nod to Jaws (1975) in the form of ""we're gonna' need a bigger bucket.""  But let's focus on the good, shall we?

We see many call backs to the familiar.  An infected victim's bloody goo self-coagulates and moves around on its own like The Thing (1982; blood test scene), the scientists seem to be experts on all things science (an annoying trait among scientist characters across the genre), the monstrous infection lies latent in the infected for a time like The Thing (1982), we have a scene with a woman waste deep in dangerous water reminding us of Newt in Aliens (1986), a naked woman is monstrously modified like The Thing (2011), the monster combines with the sum of its victims and eventually assumes a semi-insectoid crustacean-like form (after absorbing two tons of crab) like in Leviathan (1989), and in the end (like in The Thing (1982)) we resort to refreezing the monster (and everyone infected) in the ice.

Overall, this movie is simultaneously disappointing and entertaining at the same time.  It captured none of the urgency, care for the characters, creepy atmosphere or gravity of those films it clearly emulated.  Steering clear of the dire fear of ""who goes there?"" we know almost right away that just about everyone is infected, and no effort is properly manifested to make us fear who is or isn't infected.  On the other hand, there were loads of satisfying tentacles and monster shots!  I, for one, will not be buying this for my collection.  However, I do not at all regret spending a few bucks to see it OnDemand/PPV.",1443225600,,5071,5.017921146953405

The Long: I decided to give this a shot, given the people involved. I'm a professional CG AND practical artist who wanted to see what Gillis and company would do if given the reigns themselves.

Lance Henriksen is pretty good in this, and is sadly the only competent actor in the cast. The only other person in this movie you've likely seen before is Matt Winston (actor son of the late and great Stan Winston). He managed to make me hate him during his screen time, but I hate him in everything he's in so...its a wash. The rest are bargain basement players at best, or really more likely, non-actor relatives, spouses/mistresses of the production & financing staff of the picture. The lead actress is also the producer...she should stick to producing. She is incredi-bad.

Gillis' directorial work on this is pretty shameful, given that he is a famous veteran FX guy. How could he stage, light & shoot his monsters so poorly, when they were, ostensibly, the reason for making the film? The script and dialog are also his, so he is entirely to blame for the bland, derivative and poorly paced script full of atrocious dialog. I was literally pausing to face-palm every 5 minutes while watching this.

The Short: +2 stars for the committed fun throwback to 80's monster horror ( and the heyday of Gillis/Woodruffs careers) and Lance Henriksen...but make no mistake this movie is terrible.",1442793600,,1558,4.7380073800738005

This is seriously one bad movie. Out of everyone on the ship it was the two black actors that got killed off first... from there it was just one bad cliche after another. Absolutely amazingly bad. At the end people are doing absolutely inexplicable things that make no sense. Im laughing just thinking about it again. The special effects hardware obviously came out of a cracker jacks box...

A little while later we hear the ships only African-American male  ranting about not believing in this ""voodoo bulls***"", also directly taken from ""The Thing""! Is this bad? Absolutely not! I had tons of fun with this low budget sci-fi thriller! The obvious is there. Accept and enjoy! Although it's really not frightening, it is fun to watch, and the effects are not that bad either. People have compared it to ""Leviathan"", ""Alien"", and of course ""The Thing"". ""The Thing"" I can see, but it's really nothing like ""Alien"" which Ridley Scott ripped off from ""It! The Terror From Beyond Space"", so what's the beef? LOL The plot surely borrows from ""The Thing"", but I love those movies, and really didn't mind at all! MacCready's Chess Wizard even makes an appearance as if that isn't obvious enough, but ohhhh, what fun indeed! Even the characters are well rounded out, and the acting is not too shabby with Lance Henriksen at the helm!
The effects seem to lean more toward stop-motion animation, but that makes it even more cool! Chris Drake's score is hauntingly ambient, and at times actually sounds very Moriconesque!

Four ARCHETYPAL Stars. ""Inanimate"" (aka Harbinger Down in the USA) is a film that borrows many themes from Ridley Scotts Alien and even stars Lance Hendriksen, who starred as Bishop in the James Cameron follow-on movie Aliens. The story concerns a college study group that boards a crab boat out of Dutch Harbor, Alaska to track a pod of whales, only to find a dangerous artifact that triggers ghastly Alien movie themes. In this movie, things are definitely not what they seem and the truth arises near the end. Also starring Camille Balsamo as a very likable, 'would-be Ripley', Reid Collins, Giovannie Samuels, Milla Bjorn, and others. Very Definitely Recommended as a well-done horror, Sci Fi movie and love the ending. Four HORRIFIC Stars! (An Alec Gillis Film.

The good:
Interesting story, creepy premise, awesome creatures.

The bad:
The Russian woman with the terrible accent (good character, horrible accent that kept me from really feeling immersed in the movie) and the introductory scene with the cosmonaut (entirely unnecessary as it's pretty much explained through the rest of the movie and it has probably the worst-looking effects of the movie as a whole).

And why the heck would anyone be stupid enough to get on a boat or ship name the Harbinger?  You have never heard of a harbinger of peace and love right?.  It is always something bad.  Beyond that the movie was good but it definitely mirrored 'The Thing' in so many ways.  I would watch it again.,1440028800,,396,4.090909090909091

Not very original, and I think they could have gone another way and made it better. I liked the atmosphere on the ship. There was something there, but they just couldn't nail it down. I am all for practical effects, but while pretty good, they were one dimensional. Not enough variety or character for me. The acting was ok, but not stellar. But of course Lance brings it.

All of that said, it isn't a horrible movie. It's a basic B flick that harkins back to the 80's. So I support films like this, and I hope the trend continues. But I think it's worth a watch.",1439856000,,721,4.301470588235294

However, the whole thing is filmed kind of weird - the camera feels like it is constantly looking up at people and the bright scenes are unnaturally bright, the dark scenes too dark. With the exception of Lance Henrickson the acting also left a lot to be desired. The similarities being drawn to a Syfy movie are spot on. I couldn't really get invested in the story and ended up just spending my time admiring the practical effects.",1439856000,,578,4.411214953271028
7306147,4,B0107GC2AM,"Russians tried to build cosmonaut resistant to radiation. Didnt work out so well.

This movie proudly shows off its homage to 1980s practical creature effects. Its makers have a pedigree from those movies, including Aliens and Predator.

The son of special effects legend Stan Winston is one of the actors, and sci-fi icon Lance Henriksen is one of the stars. He pretty much plays his grizzled tough-guy self, and says Nobody deep-sixes my ship.

I thought the monster was inspired by Tremors before I read the whole press release and found out the creators worked on Tremors.

So this isn't just a tribute by fans. These guys are fans, and they were also there on the scene when the stuff they love was happening.

Some people are trapped on a ship in frozen wastes, and something hatches, and the rest is classic 80s flick: The monster appears briefly, the crew members freak out, dramatic music builds. This movie has the whole options package.

This movie shows a love for its influences, and works like a textbook example of how to use practical effects.

The monster is totally made with practical effects, and it shows. Its gooey and sticky and gross, and you cant duplicate that with CGI. Its easier to act disgusted when they really are disgusted.

Harbinger Down is the kind of movie that wed still be talking about if it came out in the 1980s.

Of course, Lance Henriksen is good in everything. The monster is made with practical effects, and in true practical-effects style, the thing is disgusting. I mean that as a compliment.

Well worth the hour and a half, this movie is a tribute to the roots of modern sci-fi flicks and a good movie on its own even if you haven't seen Tremors or The Thing (but you really should see Tremors and The Thing.)

Lance Henriksen is always a welcome addition, making for a fun time even on the low budget end. Harbinger is decently entertaining, but has the feeling that you've seen this all before. The practical effects are highly appreciated rather than going the low end and unconvincing CGI route.

A poor, poor ""Alien"" clone shaken and stirred with ""The Thing"": strand a group of people in total isolation (in this case a large crabbing vessel in icy northern seas), unknowingly pick up a nasty alien entity, then kill off the characters one by one until only one is left to destroy the creature.  Unfortunately, ""Harbinger"" has none of the style, intelligence, or performances of either of its forebears, and therefore none of the terror.  It's thoroughly predictable; even though the supposed surprises and shocks come with no clues or hints beforehand, you'll still see them coming because they're completely derivative - think Ash being revealed as a robot in ""Alien"": ""Oh, no!  There's a Russian spy on board who was MEANT to get the alien onto the ship, and the crew of the ship was MEANT to be expendable.""

7306158,3,B0107GC2AM,"Overall, I enjoyed this film. The creature effects were pretty neat, though I kind of got a Little Shop of Horrors vibe from some of it - which kind of took away from the scary factor.

I highly anticipated this film as I am an enormous fan of The Thing, but there was just something missing with this movie. The atmosphere was off. The cinematography was very odd and there were several different styles happening at once - this was distracting. It popped between the jumpy, eccentric movements you'd find in Evil Dead, found footage film, and the typical style you'd see in a horror movie. The acting performance of the Professor really irritated me; he was really overdoing it and just wasn't believable. The rest of the cast did rather well, though I'm not an acting expert and this is just my opinion.

Spoilers start here:

The main problem, I think, is they tried to emulate The Thing's atmosphere but did not make an isolation horror movie. I'm not going to compare this movie to the John Carpenter classic; that's unfair - but if you want to make an isolation horror movie, you need to capture that sense of utter hopelessness. That was missing. When it is revealed that the Russian crew member is actually an agent and there is a sub en route, it gives the audience a sense of rescue. In other successful isolation horror movies - such as The Thing, Alien, etc - there is no possibility of help coming. The protagonists are on their own and there is a very real chance they may not survive it. Getting this atmosphere right is so crucial because it really keeps a viewer like myself on edge. It's not that isolation horror always must kill everyone (because it doesn't; Ripley survived), it's that it must keep an air of pure uncertainty in order to work.

I feel that Harbinger Down is a good example of the fact that being good at one thing does not mean you are good at other things. The main creators of the movie were practical effect crews that grew frustrated with the overuse of CGI. But writing a script is not easy, and neither is setting a mood.

All this being said, I do recommend it. Harbinger Down took me back to that neat era of cinema where a movie was whatever the creators' imagination wanted it to be. The monster designs were great.",1439424000,5,2264,4.4987834549878345

And that movie is world's better for it. Just another horrible example of what I have deemed ""period power"" movies. The description says ""Soviet Space Shuttle"" when it's actually a Soviet Lunar Excursion Module (LEM). If you know anything about the Apollo missions you will notice that during the pre title sequence. The male actors' performances range from great (Lance) to meh (The White Professor). Given that guy didn't have a lot to work with. His lines consisted of what I imagine every feminist thinks men (white ones specifically) think. The Russian girl, was pretty decent, but her lines sadly can be boiled down to this ""I am female hear me roar"" (though meow would be more accurate.). The movie would have been so much better without either of the female characters, which would have removed the terrible Professor character (not a loss) as well. In short, this movie suffers the same fate as ""The Thing"" prequel/sequel had. Feminist bullshit, and terrible female actors, weak plot, and just over all boring. I give it one star because of the practical effects. Without the females, their acting, the feminist bullshit, and a reworked story, it was easily a 3, if not a 4.
