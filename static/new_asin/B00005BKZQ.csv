1424961,3,B00005BKZQ,"Not only because the new American version is modern and actual, but mainly the excellent cast and better timing.  Is surprisingly alike but different in what I mentioned before.  I still remember my joy seeing the original on tv before the new version, but I definitely  prefer Robin William's one.",1169337600,,298,4.92

1424963,4,B00005BKZQ,"La Cage Aux Folles II is a terrific sequel, a rare treat that closely duplicates the charm of the original, while being a completely different film. This time around, the couple unwillingly get involved in a spy ring, with murder, mayhem, and one funne chase after another ensuing.
The casting is pricless, with Michel Serrault even funnier as Albin, the main attraction of the elegant cabaret, ""La Cage Aux Folles."" Ugo Tognazzi is also terrific as his partner Renato, and their comic misadventures are a pure joy to watch. This is 100 minutes of pure escapism; hilarious, entertaining, and touching. While the escapades are taken to the extreme, these are real people with real emotions, which makes them all the better to watch. Any gay man can relate to Albin's feelings of being unloved and unaccepted and Renato trying to be the macho man in a homophobic society.
The film is entertaining from start to finish, a wonderful way to spend an evening. Make some popcorn and enjoy!",1088985600,27,982,4.851190476190476
1424964,5,B00005BKZQ,"La Cage II has always been my favourite of all the La Cage movies (there are 3 total).  I am happy to see it in DVD format and happy too, that the audio is better than La Cage I.
I highly recommend you see this movie.  It is quite good!  There are plenty of action scenes throughout the comedy that will make you truly laugh.  From Nice, France to Italy go Renato and Albin hiding from international spys....",1016064000,17,408,4.1923076923076925
1424965,5,B00005BKZQ,"This is my therapy film (along with the first ""La Cage aux Folles).  When life gets a little too dark...I reach for this.
The lead actors are masters, and the supporting cast is incredible as well.
Oh...and...a nicely chilled bottle of champagne goes well with this too!",1014076800,6,270,4.74468085106383
1424966,5,B00005BKZQ,"If you liked ""La cage aux folles"" number one you will love this second story. Zaza Napoli(Michel Serrault) is very funny and touching as always.
There is:""Renatoooooooo!"" which made this move famous.
You mix up spy stories, murders ,runing away,cops ,bad guys and the irresistibly funny couple Renato (Ugo Tognazzi) / Zaza Napoli and you have an very funny and adorable movie.
If you want to laugh with your family don`t hesitate ,buy this movie",999043200,9,445,4.946666666666666
1424967,2,B00005BKZQ,"This mild sequel to director Edouard Molinaro's enormously popular La Cage aux Folles centres on an action plot involving spies and a sought after capsule of microfilm that has unknowingly fallen into the possession of Albin and Renato. The chase element therefore is a break away from the sitting room farce of the original, using many fish out of water ideas and further exploring the notion of drag as a deceptive device.  Although once again Albin dresses as a woman to conceal his identity, it is the times when he dresses as a man where the most humour comes from - his scene as a window cleaner is particularly funny. Molinaro's use of the thriller elements are occasionally clunky - the first cut to a spy being chased is jarring - and there is little fun to be had in car chases and gunfire. The most interesting scenes in terms of gender politics and roleplay involve straight men dressing as gay, so as to be in the company of Albin, then naturally assumed to be gay and confronted by antagonism because of it. Of course it confirms the cliche that gay men are physically defenceless, but that is contextually acceptable. Molinaro stretches out the expectation to an almost unbearable level, as if the joke is bursting to be released. The similar slow timing of a person hiding in a birthday cake set piece is less effective. Some suspense is created from a running gag regarding where the microfilm capsule has been hidden, and there is a clever audio gag with the sound of road-drilling. The shrill screaming of Michael Serrault's Albin which was so memorably recreated by Nathan Lane in the Mike Nichols The Birdcage is repeated here, and just when we begin to grow tired of it, Molinaro uses that feeling in a dual act of heroism. Perhaps the success of the original film is due to the comparative non-threatening nature of the presentation of these gay men, further softened by the genre of comedy. And even the potentially offensive notion of Albin and Renato being older men and therefore no longer sexually active is counterbalanced by the obvious affection they feel toward each other. By removing them from the safe gay environment of their nightclub and relocating them in the hostile straight world, Molinaro and his writers Francis Veber, Jean Poiret and Marcello Danon out their characters.",989280000,10,2315,4.802005012531328
1424988,5,B00005BKZQ,"I love this movie.  This sequel is almost funnier than the first one.  The actors are great, and it doesn't bother me at all that it is in French with subtitles because the subtitles are very well done to the point that you can settle in and get very comfortable with them.",1437696000,,273,4.230769230769231

1425014,5,B00005BKZQ,"I have yet to purchase the DVD, for I was afraid to find it would be subtitled, for I watched both the subtitled and the later dubbed English version both at the theater.
I literally DRAGGED my mother, my MOTHER!LOL...to see it, begging her, telling her it was priceless, since we both got a chuckle out of the first one.
By the middle of the film, my mother was nearly sliding out of her theater chair, tissue in hand, and laughing so hard, she couldn't see!
Now that I know this is dubbed, I'm definitly buying it.
I won't get into the movie, for enough already have. But this is by far, one of my favorite films. And I don't like comedy much. I'm just not the type, especially slapstick Steve Martin, etc...
But this, not only is not slapstick, but an excellent storyline, plot, everthing. The twists and turns are hilarious, especially since you often 'see through the eyes' of Albin, and his pathetically hilarious plight of just not being able to stay out of trouble for 5 minutes alone!
Highlights:
The train scene, taking off more than just a load of passengers...
Renalto: ""I'ts simple. You're a man, pretending to be a woman, pretending to be a man"".
Albin: ""That was a little too deep, can you run that by me again?""
Albin getting shoved into the 'womens' quarters at Renalto's childhood village in rural Italy, where Albin is disquised as a REAL woman here in the film, on the run, and is forced into a real woman's world. The cooking, cleaning, scrubbing on hands and knees...and finally having enough of that, he says to Renalto, ""I don't want to be a woman anymore. If this is what being a woman is like, I don't want any part of it anymore.""

The birthday cake scene. *By far, the funniest scene in the whole movie*
Albin, again:
Being told it's 'sponge' cake, one of those party cakes where the 'girl' pops out, with ""Surprise!""
Well...
""I'm not going in there, I'm not a sponge!""
""I'm a diabetic!""
""I'm scared of the dark!""
and on and on he goes, begging them not to put him in that thing.
Hilarious!!!

You GOT to see this. Truly a masterpiece of a film. Funnier than hell, 3x as funny as the first, and the III'rd just doesn't cut it, in my opinon.
La Cage I was good, granted, but II just takes the cake, no pun intended.",1284940800,2,2242,4.413043478260869
