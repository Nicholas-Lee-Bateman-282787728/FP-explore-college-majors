7821919,4,6302054397,"It's the most complicated Wings Hauser movie I've ever seen and Wings has been in some complicated plots. Wings is basically Gary Cooper in High Noon here with a couple other plots layered on top of it. How they chose the extra plots is beyond me. It takes a ton of cocaine to make someone think high noon needs to have Last House on The Left and 5 other disparate movie parts layered on top of it but I'm glad someone had the money to buy that much cocaine and the focus to get it on the page. It's harder than people realize.

Wings is in top form. He wears his high school football coach shorts, has goofy interactions with children playing sports (he's the best big brother), and manages to let himself be filmed in ways no other action hero will. Seriously, the guy will let bizarrely realistic things that are technically embarrassing for his character happen. Wing Hauser is dedicated to authenticity.

Even though I've been jokey, the movie is fun. It has more ambition than the budget can handle and Wings can only lift so much but he lifts a lot. Worth watching at least once.",1457308800,,1086,4.452261306532663
7821920,3,6302054397,"This work is above his norm for low echelon director Paul Leder, benefiting from contributions made by some talented players along with Leder's competent editing, and occasionally dialogue penned by Leder's son Reuben gives the actors some marrow, but as with much of the senior Leder's output, an overly cluttered storyline holds the film captive to its lower cut station. Wings Hauser is newly hired Sheriff Ralph Baker of the small town of Orton Creek, California, migrant from Los Angeles where he had been a traffic policeman before tiring of a congested existence; however, he learns that his township is beneath the thumb of local plutocrat Will Curran ( Dick Sargent), whose son Don ( Tom Hodges) is shielded, by unified community officials, from being charged for the murder of another youth. During a hazing incident, a prospective fraternity brother is slain by Don and his cohorts, but the blame, as a hit-and-run crime, is readily placed upon a traveling huckster, Frank Govers (Robert Picardo) who keeps his own criminal past a secret while enjoying loyal and romantic support from a young waitress ( Heather Fairfield) although these two, as fugitives, are captured and abused by yet two more outlaws, all of which is occurring while the Sheriff's deputies quit the Department because of the senior Curran's pressure and political influence. It becomes readily apparent that these several unions, and others as well, are too tall an order for the resources at hand, although there is a good deal of sincere effort displayed by the cast, and Leder wisely allows the players to develop their parts, but blocking is awkwardly arranged and plot flaws interfere with continuity. Heather Fairfield is particularly convincing as a jilted bride who has fastened her love to a man with a very uncertain future, and Frances Fisher performs well as the Sheriff's secretary and lover, with nice turns delivered by Lauren Woodland, playing Baker's young daughter, and Kris Kamm as an innocent fraternity member, in this never boring but uneven production shot in northern Los Angeles County.",1151452800,,2093,5.12280701754386
