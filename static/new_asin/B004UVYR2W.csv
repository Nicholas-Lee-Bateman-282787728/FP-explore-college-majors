8442341,4,B004UVYR2W,"Anyone who considers themselves a member of Red Sox Nation will want to watch this video. It is a pretty good look back at the history of The Boston Red Sox from 1901 when the team first started playing to 2007 when the Red Sox won the world series that year against the Colorado Rockies. The video was released in 2008 so you won't find any mention of the 2013 season, the last time the Red Sox won the world series.

The only complaint I would have with this DVD is the same thing some other reviewers of this have mentioned. The DVD focuses too much I think on the more recent times including the 2004 and 2007 world series and not quite as much on the past. It needed to be a little more balanced I think in telling the story behind one of the original franchises of the American League. For one thing I was surprised they didn't do more in talking about superstars like Ted Williams and Carl Yastremski. Yes they are talked about here but not at the length I would have expected them to. Example they totally ignore the story of Ted Williams last ever at bat. Occurring in 1960 at Fenway Park Ted would end his career by hitting a home run. Certainly a memorable moment but no mention here. And while they talk briefly about Yaz and his fantastic year in 1967 when he one the triple crown and lead the Sox to the American League championship and a trip to the World Series it would have been nice if they had gone more into what the last two weeks for the season was like as four teams, including Boston, were battling it out to see who would win the pennant and the heroics Yaz would display to propel his team to victory. There isn't even any real mention about the ""Green Monster"", the left field wall at Fenway Park that has as much impact on the history of the team as any player who has worn a Red Sox uniform. And while the ""curse of the Bambino"" is mentioned the video doesn't go into detail how it came about. True any fan of the Red Sox knows what the famous curse was but still if you are going to look back at the important memories of the team then you got to include talking about the deal that was made that sent Babe Ruth to the Yankees and would change for 86 years the fate of Boston.

Still with all that said this is still a pretty good video even with these and other omissions. If you or someone you know is a Red Sox fan this is the perfect video to get.",1423785600,2,2382,4.164859002169197
