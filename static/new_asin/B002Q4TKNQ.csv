3966244,3,B002Q4TKNQ,"HEMPSTERS: PLANT THE SEEED is not really a polemic or a diatribe about the practicality and multitudinous benefits of growing cannabis in its various forms.  Rather, HEMPSTERS is a stirring, almost inspiring, portrait of some of our country's more eccentric and spirited ""free-thinkers"" as they would no doubt prefer to be called.

The documentary follows seven activists and their allies as they fight to legalize industrial hemp in the United States.  Hemp is already used in over 30 countries and is widely know to have numerous environmental benefits including the reduced use of oil (especially imported oil from our ""enemies""), forest conservation and soil redemption.  It's a startling reminder that any product that can be produced from petroleum can also be produced by hemp.  Over 25,000 products we use in our ordinary daily lives can be manufactured or derived from industrial hemp.  In America's past are laws requiring farmers to grow hemp.  Hemp is a durable fiber that can be used for paper, textiles, biodegradable plastics, health food and of course fuel.

The film features Woody Harrelson.  Other activists include Willie Nelson, Ralph Nader and Julia Butterlfy Hill.

If this subject interests you, and you are already a medicinal marijuana supporter, then by all means consider the other uses of this amazing, ancient, miraculous plant that does not need pesticides to grow and actually leeches toxins out of the ground!

Oh, and here's something else to think about:  It would take less than six per-cent of U.S. land to grow enough hemp for hemp fuel to make us energy independent from the rest of the world!",1311638400,11,1632,5.093984962406015

8377484,4,B002Q4TKNQ,I love this movie. I hope that hemp becomes a lawful plant in America. I liked the part where the Indians at the Pine Ridge Indian Reservation tried to grow hemp. The  DEA thried to thwart the Indians. I would like to see this agency closed down as soon as possible.,1440720000,3,266,4.215686274509804

8377488,5,B002Q4TKNQ,"Not only did this documentary cover the many advantages of growing hemp, but it
also reinforced my belief that the majority of politians running this country are idiots. Why in the world shouldn't we grow hemp? Will we continue to cut down trees until this country becomes a desert? What about our farmers? With the unpredictability of our weather, hemp could provide their sustainability. Hemp is NOT pot, nor is it a drug! It, to me, boils down to the conclusion: Overusage of our resources = ""progress"" = lining the pockets of the rich = the degradation of our land. We need a new political party who is on OUR side. Sensibility will not reign until we vote differently.",1355011200,2,673,4.663865546218488
8377489,5,B002Q4TKNQ,"This film addresses the importance of growing hemp for the economy.  The fact that law enforcement can recognize the differences in many countries, but ours cannot is not a valid reason.  We could rely on hemp for a myriad of uses and help the country as well.",1352592000,,260,4.51063829787234

8377491,4,B002Q4TKNQ,"I liked this movie because it made me think and ask why:
1. Why don't our politicians get it?
2. With an indian tribe that has 85% unemployment why does the DEA get in the way?
3. Why does Julia Butterfly Hill get involved while I stand on the sidelines?

Hempsters, you planted the seed. I will change in 2012.",1326672000,2,311,4.183333333333334
