5425575,2,B00AHTKIVU,I will start off by saying that my 5 year old did like this movie. I on the other hand thought they could have done so much better. I kind of felt like the whole story was going no where. I am also use to Barbie being the good selfless one but in this movie she is very selfish. I don't think we will be watching this movie again and that sad because my daughter has been waiting months for its release.  Hopefully the next movie is as good as the older ones.,1362009600,11,459,3.935483870967742
5425576,5,B00AHTKIVU,"My daughter was waiting impatiently for this movie to come out, and we were not disappointed.  Barbie and the Pink Shoes may be one of the best Barbie movies ever.  The music is beautiful.  It is classical music from the ballets ""Giselle"" and ""Swan Lake"" and very enjoyable.  The story is wonderful as well.  Barbie as ""Kristyn Farraday"" tries on a pair of pink ballet shoes that transport her into the lead character in first the ballet ""Giselle"", then the ballet ""Swan Lake.""  The antagonist in this movie, the Snow Queen, is a true villain. The character of Kristyn is somewhat flawed, which makes her more likable.  This was a great improvement over some of the catty movies with poor scripts (like Barbie & the Diamond Castle.)

My 4.5 year-old daughter said this was her favorite movie ever.  The extras on the DVD include music, music videos, outtakes, and ""Barbie and the Dreamhouse"" short episode & music video.  This was worth every penny!  She was dancing along to the classical music and enjoyed all of the dance scenes.  Highly recommend.",1361923200,30,1051,4.777777777777778
5425577,4,B00AHTKIVU,"I was thrilled with the movie, my daughter has wanted to see it since she saw the first advertisement!  She owns all the barbie movies!  I am not happy about the word ""jerk"" being used in a children's movie!",1361836800,18,207,4.282051282051282
5425578,5,B00AHTKIVU,"My two daughters (ages 3 and 5) really love Barbie. They have plenty of the toys and movies.  This is a great new movie that seems to keep their attention very well.  My oldest has been doing dance for several years and she was really excited to see this movie.  Overall they loved it and it is a great addition to their collection.

This movie is a fantasy style movie where Barbie plays the main ballerina character named Kristyn who is in dance school with big dreams.  After ripping her shoes in rehearsal, she has to find a new pair in the costume department.  She ends up finding a pair of magical sparkling pink shoes that send Kristyn and her friend Hailey into a ballet world.  There they find an evil Snow Queen.  The storyline goes that the girls must dance their favorite ballets to defeat the evil queen and find a way home.  There is some mild conflict with the Snow Queen, but nothing too upsetting for little ones.  The best part about this movie is that your children are exposed to some great classical ballets (Swan Lake and Giselle) and music from famous composers (Tchaikovsky and Beethoven).

Overall, the movie was fun and colorful with great CGI graphics.  It has educational value by exposing your children to famous classical ballets and music.  And most of all, the kids love it.  I can't imagine a movie that is more perfect for your little dancer.  Highly Recommended.

=========================

UPDATE (05/06/2013):
So we've had this movie for a few months now and my girls are still really enjoying it.  My oldest, who is now 6, has been doing dance for a while and really loves it.  It is right up her alley.  She has a little dancer doll that she says is Barbie in the Pink Shoes.  Our 3 year old, who is more of a sports kid, is also really liking it.  They have been requesting ""Pink Shoes"" a lot lately.  This past weekend they requested a Barbie movie and they both agreed on this one over ""The Princess & The Popstar"".  It is tough to get them to agree on anything, so this is a big deal for us, especially since it beat out ""Popstar"" in our house.  It keeps their attention and they are really liking it lately... plus they get exposed to some Classical Music.  My 3 year old has even expressed interest in taking a summer dance class, which is a first.  Still Highly Recommended!",1361318400,98,2320,4.4749403341288785
5425579,5,B00AHTKIVU,"How refreshing not to watch a canned Barbie movie about fashion and idiotic stories.  This may be the single best work that the franchise has released for Barbie.  It is a beautiful story, beautiful music and nice animation.  It was nice to be able to sit through a Barbie movie with my daughter and actually enjoy one again, that past year has been full of clickish trash.  This movie is a masterpiece in its own.",1361232000,67,414,4.48

5425588,4,B00AHTKIVU,"In this video Barbie is an aspiring ballerina, who finds herself in trouble for improvising rather than sticking to the script.  Soon magical ballet slippers transport her into several ballets including Swan Lake and Giselle (with the title being a reference to the Red Shoes).  There her ability to create her own dances and change the story saves the day.

This video is a big hit with our young daughters who recently started ballet lessons.  The like the dancing and the costumes, and follow along on the living room floor.  Some parts, particularly with the Snow Queen, are a bit scary but only in the 'hide under a blanket' sort of way, rather than the 'have nightmares for weeks' kind of scary.

And, for once, Barbie is not a princess!

So this is one I don't mind showing the girls.",1503964800,,791,4.607142857142857

They may not be masterpieces destined to be called classics in years to come, but they are well made and have positive storylines.  I love that they use motion capture and real dancers to get the dance sequences animated correctly with natural motion.  I also love that they use sequences and storylines from classic ballets - what a lovely introduction for the little aspiring ballerina!  The overall message in the movie is that it's not necessary to be perfect - just dance from the heart.  All in all - I don't think you can go wrong with the Barbie movies.  They are sweet, uplifting stories that easily entertain my daughter (and my son if he doesn't know anyone's paying attention).",1395878400,,756,4.646616541353383

Do not just asume like I did at first that just because of the title and that its a Barbie movie that you need children around to enjoy it! Just watch it, and enjoy. I love this about the Barbie movies in general 90% of them are great. There are a few that are not.

But this is one of those gems no one expected, and I was one of the nay sayers. The INSTANT I heard the name of the movie I thought it was going to be some fashion snippet type movie without any real soul. MAN was I wrong!

So enjoy it, its a wonderful movie, and I really feel like the song at the end is JUST as GOOD as any Disney song out there.

The plot was cringe inducing with a image-centric focus that made me grin my teeth, the characters (chiefly Barbie) were annoyingly shallow and self-driven, and the overall message wasn't something I wanted presented to my daughter.

A magic pair of pointe shoe transport Barbie and her friend to different stories, like Giselle and Swan Lake, and the villains in the fantasy world resemble decent people from Barbie's reality.  Nothing special here.  Though I will say that the ""love interests"" are mild enough (in contrast to ""The Fairy Secret"").",1381363200,,412,4.828571428571428

No cheesy flaky pastry in this movie!! This is the most well written of all of the Barbie movies and the least advertised. The only villain of the main story is realistic and true to life as the stern dance instructor who teaches as she believes is best. Ballet is not Modern Dance. I dislike the cheesy villains in other Barbie features like Mermaidia or Fairytopia, though we loved the scenery and the story teaches good values. Also find Barbie Perfect Christmas for a more original Barbie movie about reminding us that being together is what is most important at Christmas. I also liked Fashion Fairytale which showed what real love is and how much Barbie's boyfriend is willing to go through for her. Very funny and sweet!!",1380585600,,888,4.735483870967742

I have seen all of the movies many time,s since i was little. when i heard there was a new movie, i was looking forward to see what the creators would do. However, i was surprised at how the movie turned out. The story line was jumbled and sometimes confusing. Barbie does not seem to learn a lesson all throughout this film. she does what comes naturally, dance in her own way. the only people that exhibit any change are the dance teacher and the snobby dancer. in addition, i am confused as to why the producers decided to incorporate Swan Lake into this film, when they have already made a rendition of it. i do give some credit to the educational implications the movie includes, the accrete dancing roles of each ballet and the musical influences of Beethoven, Tchaikovsky, and Adam.
i know that i am over analyzing this children's film, but as a early childhood teacher, i find this movie somewhat decent for children under the age of 10. i am not saying that children, or people older may not like the film, but i just want to pose the question: what is this moving telling young children?",1376352000,3,1140,4.433333333333334

5425769,4,B00AHTKIVU,"My daughter loves the Barbie movies The animations are on par with bigger studio productions and the music is catchy and really adorable when your little ones sing along.  After watching nearly EVERY Barbie movie (and no, it isn't as painful as one would suspect), the storylines and music tend to blend together. I am eager for more flicks that aren't all about ballerinas and princesses. Though, even with those roles being the primary leads in the stories, Barbie is typically portrayed as strong and independent--a little bit of the outsider.  The language is acceptable for the most part, but at times the ""bad"" guys/gals use words that make me cringe a bit.  But, if you are watching with your little ones it can be a good time to talk about ""not nice words."" Kelly Sheridan is the voice of Barbie and does a lovely job.  The outtakes on some of the videos are really funny (my little ones often want me to play them over and over).  It is cute to see the CARTOONS break character and goof up and around.  We are looking forward to the next one and will more than likely add it to our collection when it comes out.",1368576000,12,1120,4.465686274509804

You say - it's a kid's movie what do you expect? Since I (and most parents) watch what our kids watch, I've noticed minor differences after 17+ Barbie movies.  Anyway that's my only minor gripe.

The CGI was very well done and realistic. The interaction between characters was humorous and appropriate.

As is typical in Barbie movies, there were a few positive messages for girls in the film:

1) Be true to yourself, you don't have to do things exactly like everyone else.
2) Friendship is important. Be supportive of your friends.
3) Be nice!

I was a HUGE fan of all the classics, Barbie as Rapunzel, Barbie in Swan Lake...I am just so glad this one had a different story to tell and I LOVED the transitions from Giselle to Odette. The girl as Barbie's friend was so funny and made the ""darnkess"" in the movie seemingly not there. I also adored the classical music as well as dancing in this. My favorite scene was when ""Odette"" and the prince were dancing by the lake. The moves were just so perfect. I was so entranced with this movie and I hope you will watch it as well as your daughters.",1363305600,,656,4.341463414634147

5425841,1,B00AHTKIVU,My daughter owns nearly every Barbie movie.  This one was watched once and my daughter has no further interest in it.  Very poor storyline.  I wonder what happened during production to make this movie so disjointed and poorly done.  Very disappointed.,1362873600,3,251,5.048780487804878

Kristyn finds herself in troublesome situations for a good part of the movie. The two main characters, Kristyn and the seamstress are very likeable characters. Nevertheless, the whole family did enjoy the movie. Even my 4 year old son liked it.",1362268800,13,355,4.650793650793651

However, I doubt this one will be returning to our DVD player very often. The story was unoriginal and the animation seemed really flat in this one. When it was over, my daughter summed it up: ""definitely not one of my favorites.""",1362096000,6,343,4.532258064516129

5425848,5,B00AHTKIVU,"Barbie is back in 'Barbie in the Pink Shoes', a return to the classic music and storytelling that put the Barbie movies on the map. I love ALL the Barbie movies from Nutcracker to Princess and the Popstar, but like most fans, I far prefer the earlier classics. In this movie, Barbie (as Kristin) and her friend Hailey are magically transported into a living ballet world where they meet characters from Giselle and Swan Lake, confront the wicked Snow Queen and of course, dance. This movie, while providing a good balance of fantasy and humor, has a mature, almost subdued quality all its own. Possibly because the classic music and dance are such a contrast to the newer Barbie movies. Many children have grown up with these movies, and this one seems to have grown up with them. There has been a conscious effort on the part of the filmmakers in recent years to steer Barbie into a more modern rock-n-roll world, but they don't seem to realize that younger audiences tend to follow their own tastes in music, fashion, etc, before peer pressure influences them into following the crowd instead. Most younger viewers (and listeners) respond to a more civilized look and sound, and I think this fits the bill on both counts.
This brings forward the 'message' of the movie, which contends that one should follow one's own heart and not be shackled by conventions. When Barbie dances, the music seems to flow right through her and she deviates from the established choreography to create her own, ultimately winning the day. There are two sides to this contention; while art should not be squeezed into pre-established confines (after all, even 'classical' stuff had to establish itself at some point), traditional music and dance should not be discounted just because it IS traditional (after all, it is considered 'classic' for a reason). The point is, art is subjective and there is no right or wrong (unless it's gimmick-driven or fad-following). Ballet is a particularly traditional art form, but anything done right has its place, be it traditional or otherwise. Everyone has a voice, so let them use it and let the audience decide what works. This movie DOES work, and I recommend it highly.",1362009600,72,2195,4.856

This is setting a standard for girls that isn't proper, and unrealistic. I hope that in the future there will be a barbie that will look like me and my children.
