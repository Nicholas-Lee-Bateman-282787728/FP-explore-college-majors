7003049,2,B00T9G67L2,"THE BLOOD LANDS is a strange movie. It does have alot of suspense and mystery, but the viewer never really knows why.
A married couple decides to spend all of their money on a run down old farmhouse in Scotland and to live in it while they're fixing it up. One gets the feeling that the husband isn't terribly happy at his job in England and it looks and sounds very enticing to be his own boss, get more land and house for their money and to kind of get away from the big city life for at least 18 months (which is the time they think it will take them to get the farmhouse restored). The location of the farmhouse has some beautiful views and they have rolling green hills all around them, so they decide to do it! They're young and have no children yet, so it would be the perfect time to do something like this; something ""adventurous"". They do not know anyone and once they've made the big move, all sorts of things start to happen. As they are settling in,almost immediately the power goes out and they are plunged into darkness. They start to hear something outside and go to investigate. They finally find a pig is the source of the noises, but the wife can't get the feeling out of her head that there is more to the noises she keeps hearing outside and begs her husband to check one more time. After several minutes, no one comes back and she is forced to go look for him and cannot find him anywhere! She sees some strange figures running all over their property; people wearing very elaborate pig masks. She hides and listens to them talking and it becomes clear that they are NOT there under friendly circumstances and they have her husband tied up somewhere.
From this point on, there's alot of running back and forth, including all of the characters, hiding and trying to trap each other and hurt each other, The viewer is never told why this is all happening, nor why the people in the pig masks don't want the young couple to live there, other than the fact that they're English. So, while there is some suspense while all of this is going on during the night, it never is explained why it's all going on and that's the problem. It all seems rather pointless and the ending is not much better than the rest of the movie! The actors were good, but it just wasn't a very satisfying or scary movie at all. I'd just skip this one, if i had to do it over.",1442102400,3,2367,4.297539149888143

7003051,3,B00T9G67L2,"(The Blood Lands) formerly titled (White Settlers) is an English Horror film that is suppose to take place in Scotland. I Iove( Pollyanna McIntosh) and she's what made me want to watch this film plus the trailor showed all the best scenes!

Pollyanna's character (Sarah) and her husband (Ed) Lee Williams move from England to Scotland because they get a great deal on a house. They start hearing things and Sarah gets a feeling of dread,soon after they are terrorized by men wearing pig masks ""which we have seen in Eric England's Madison County and more recently in Tormented/Berkshire County"".

There was a very creepy Gothic atmosphere and they did a nice job of building tension. The cat and mouse aspect took up most of the movie's hour and ninteen minute running time. The cover art and trailor make it look as if it's a full on Slasher flick, but if that's what you are expecting you're not going to get it! There is a fair amount of bloodshed but nothing memorable. This film is more about the reason  Sarah and Ed are being terrorized not the kills.

The story itself and the ""payoff"" we expect in these films was somewhat underwhelming. If you're looking for a Slasher look elsewhere but if you like watching  creepy thrillers with some jump scares then I say go for it. (3 and a half stars)",1441065600,,1301,4.5905172413793105
7003052,5,B00T9G67L2,"I'll admit I approached this film with a little trepidation. I'm usually more at home with the Gothic and creepy form of horror. I think in the past I've thought 'slash,gore, not for me.' But there was something about this one that made me want to watch it. I love being scared by a film. This film made me jump quite a few times. And it's not a purely slash/gore movie. Those usually have no plot. This one has a great plot and some credible - if not wholly likeable - characters. Painting them this way added to the film's enjoyment for me. Pollyanna McIntosh and Lee Williams did a first rate job of injecting real fear, tension and suspense into their roles. The pacing was right. The atmosphere dark, chilling and scary. This couple get far more than they bargained for when they think they've been so clever, buying a house in Scotland that the locals couldn't afford. They are English and - as some unfortunately do - have an arrogance about them when it comes to Scots living out in the rural heartland. Boy are they in for a rude awakening!

8701005,3,B00T9G67L2,"Not much to see here, folks. Fairly formulaic remote house in the country home invasion horror movie. I mean, it follows the template almost exactly: after a creepy beginning, we do the obligatory sympathise-with-the-victims slow part of the movie where we get to know them so we can care when they are attacked. The victims are a tall woman with a horrible haircut and her little man minion. They buy a fixer-upper in a remote part of Scotland. Their first night and all hell breaks loose. The only thing that seems to separate this film from other home invasion films is that there's some minor commentary on gentrification and warfare between nationalities. But this was lost a bit on me, even though my stepdad is British and has explained some of the tensions in the UK: I didn't know that Scots and Englishpeople had this rivalry. But what this film amounts to is a whole lot of suspense and build-up for a basically empty experience. It reminded me of this other horror film that is almost the exact same except the youngish couple has to battle some kind of peat bog leprechaun monster (From the Dark or something like that). And I found it odd that the original title -- even in the end credits -- of this film is ""White Settlers."" I can see why they changed it to The Blood Lands, but White Settlers makes no sense because the young (white) couple settle in a country that's already white. The only redeeming qualities of this film I would say are that every shot is in focus and there was some attention paid to lighting, color, and cinematography. But I think I've had about enough of these UK films that take place in one location where a white couple has to fight for their lives against something human or supernatural. Given the recent Brexit event, I wonder if these films symbolise fears about immigration and being native, class war, etc. I would skip this one, unless you really like the home invasion trope or would like to see a fairly cool historic homestead in a rather lovely part of Scotland. This is one of those films I kinda get mad at because they could've done a lot more: more dark humor, more sexuality, more creepiness, more explanation of the gentrification aspect & how historic tensions between ethnicities linger. Instead they paced it to be suspenseful and there's just not much to this film; it's flimsy. And is the same scriptwriter penning all these films with a cookie cutter template? They all start the same, with the couple driving out into a remote country before the horror shenanigans occur. It's like: ""Hmmmm, should the couple have to survive against a peat bog monster, or anti-English Scots?""",1473379200,,2645,4.6781115879828326

8701008,1,B00T9G67L2,"I rarely give one-star ratings but, holy hooligans, this home-invasion heel is an insult to all but the most forgiving of third-rate-suspense fans.  Why?  Setting is perfectly bucolic.  Cinematography and other technical aspects are decent.  Leads are tolerable if at times irritatingly daft.  Villains are sometimes scary, sometimes cartoonishly bumbling.  Dialogue is mundane-to-silly (not counting several episodes of 'Scooby Doo,' when was the last time you heard of a character being chased by a band of ravaging baddies and yelling, 'Hey! Over here!'-- I kid you not-- as a distraction ploy?).  But, no, the big problem with 'The Blood Lands' (a.k.a. 'White Settlers,' UK, 2014) is its plotting.  It's as if the producers of the film contracted a group of 9-year-olds to watch Peckinpah's 'Straw Dogs' (1971) and French thriller 'Them' (a.k.a. 'Ils,' 2006), then collectively dash off a story based on their tender impressions, not terribly concerned whether they grasped the rudiments of narrative reason (let alone ethos or pathos).

**HARD SPOILERS TO FOLLOW**

Now, if I were to have stopped the movie at its first 'ending,' that where our two hapless hipsters are dispatched by the comically inept pig men and sent to what we might imagine to be their gruesome demise, I would have been prepared to chalk up the thing as an unexceptional exercise in cat-and-mouse shenanigans and offer two generous stars for not completely wasting my time.  If I were to have continued to the next 'ending,' that where we see the pig men, sans disguises, in full weekend-casual attire, happily barbequing on the victims' property with their wives and kiddies, I might have added a half star for a parting shot of nasty humor (again, assuming the former homeowners were pushing daisies from somewhere beneath the craggy highlands).  But the aforementioned insult actually comes with the third and final 'ending,' wherein we find Mr. and Mrs. Upper-Middle-Class Twit, bruised but not beaten, rolling around groggily in the green Manchester grass (thought they were Londoners?) where they were apparently dropped off by their Scottish assailants.  And so the dyke of logic bursts wide open:  how on earth could the pig men allow these two to live after having had members of their own clan murdered (perhaps the Police Service of Scotland doesn't investigate disappearances/homicides?) in the process of taking by savage force land lawfully deeded to others?  Are we to assume that the survivors of this bloody eviction will lick their wounds, go quietly into the night, give up their house, their dignity, their protections under U.K. jurisprudence?  Are we likewise to assume that their inbred attackers plan to carry on blithely, drinking beer and watching football in their ill-gotten estate forever after, with no fear of reprisal?  It's all a little too ridiculous to bear, demoting 'The Blood Lands' to an ignominious single star.",1449446400,2,2929,5.197872340425532
8701009,1,B00T9G67L2,This is a terrible movie. The ending is unclear and makes no sense. Do not waste your money,1448064000,,91,4.111111111111111
8701010,3,B00T9G67L2,"A copy of this title was provided for review purposes.

Ed (Lee Williams) and Sarah (Pollyanna McIntosh) are a young upwardly mobile couple living in England. When he chance to purchase a house in Scotland arises they decide to take it on. The old farmhouse was previously owned by a family that couldn't make their payments and haven't been seen or heard from for some time now. Nothing can go wrong, right?

The young couple begin to do things to fix up the house, a bit run down but not near as bad as most houses in these type of films. Ed is a bit stereotypical city guy who tends to make fun of the locals and the previous owners of the house. Sarah on the other hand finds the house quaint and a dream come true. While neither of them has a lot of experience as a home owner, they seem to be doing okay. Repairs are made, cleaning is done and they move forward. They even end up with enough free time to have a picnic.

But as with all movies like this their choice of location doesnt sit well with the locals. Things begin to go awry until one night the pair wake up to hear someone moving about downstairs. They try to figure out what to do next and eventually Sarah makes her way out the upstairs window. She finally gets a glimpse of the home invaders who are wearing pig masks. It seems Ed was caught by them and is now tied up in the barn. Will Sarah be able to rescue him? Will the couple be one that stands and takes on the invaders or will they up and run? And if they run will they be able to get away before being tracked down?

The movie ends up being a by the book home invasion film that adds little to the genre. Most of what we see here has been done before. At least the movie is well made and well acted, something that isn't always the case in movies like this. I don't even think they do anything particularly stupid which is something that usually happens in this type of movie. Perhaps the best thing that happens here, one thing which will differentiate it from the rest of these type of films, is the ending, a twist that you won't see coming.

In the end this isn't a bad movie but not something to seek out either. It does entertain and offer a decent nights entertainment.",1445904000,,2206,4.193396226415095

Then dropped them off in the city harmed, But alive. Why try to kill them,  If your going to let them live in the end? The movie was never explained. Nothing made since.
