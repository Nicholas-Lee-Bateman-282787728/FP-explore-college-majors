I have cable but missed the 1st episode, I am not sure why F X doesn't have this ""On Demand"" but I won't buy another episode if I miss one. I am tired of tv channels ripping off consumers, there comes a point where it's too much for the consumer, your shows aren't that great - I will just move back to books and forego all cable.",1381449600,2,368,3.9864864864864864
6020480,5,B00FQY4C86,"The premier of American Horror Story has become a fall favorite and the creativity just keeps on coming with this third season, Coven. The new use of a regular cast is always worth watching for and so much fun to see how the writers will use each character. I don't want to give anything away but I will say that the romance between Taissa Farmiga and Evan Peters is so welcome. I hope it remains throughout the life of the series.",1381449600,10,431,4.333333333333333
6020481,5,B00FQY4C86,"This premiere was absolutely amazing! I loved everything about it, and I am especially glad they brought Taissa Farmiga back! This story already has an insane amount of depth, and I am in love with it already. It's terrifying, and gruesome, it entails pain and suffering, as well as heartbreak and misery...just brilliant. I can't wait for episode 2!",1381363200,3,350,4.9491525423728815
6020482,5,B00FQY4C86,"Wow! Just WOW!

I'm really thrilled with the overall story telling of American Horror Story.  The first two seasons told great stories and it looks like this one is off to a bang! Kathy Bates! OH MY!! What a fantastic role for her! I'm just beyond thrilled and I can't wait to see how she does through the rest of the season.
I like the fact that AHS tells one story per season.  It kind of reminds me of the ""Series"" method of British television.  You have time to get to know the characters and their attributes while the story is ongoing and you don't have to wait for the next season to finish the story.

I really like the fact that they're recycling cast members to fill the roles.  They each pull of their various roles from the previous seasons so well and starting the new season - all I can really say is just WOW.  I'm really excited to see where this one  goes! It's going to be a fantastic journey!",1381363200,56,911,4.22543352601156
6020483,5,B00FQY4C86,"Let's start with Kathy Bates. Oh my gosh! She was wonderful evil. Very similar to her Misery character. Good old fashion horror mixed with the present time. The season premiere had a little of everything. Torture, revenge, first love, frat party, abandonment, a little burning at the stake and unburying the past. Can't wait for episode two. I'm going to watch this again. There is a lot I'm sure I missed as I was focused on the plot. The background is just as interesting.",1381363200,8,474,4.654761904761905
6020484,5,B00FQY4C86,"This show is always amazing and freaky and the season 3 premiere was no different maybe even a little more freakier. I never have thought of this show as scary though, just more messed up. Whenever you finnish an episode you leave thinking about the episode you just watched for at least 24 hours and it's awesome that one episode can do that. If you liked the other seasons Coven is worth a try for sure!",1381363200,18,405,4.342105263157895

6020489,3,B00FQY4C86,"The best feature of this series in the music - gotta love Stevie Nicks,  The writers seem to have mommy issues.  Every single mother in the story is a demon-spawn, psychopathic sadist, yet the last episode - incongruously - struggles for a moral center completely out of sync with the rudderless gruesome slasher-fest of the preceding episodes.  Suddenly it ends with a ludicrous attempt at celebrating women, an appeal for ""girl power"" following a cringe-worthy cliche scene in which the new Supreme Witch of the coven tenderly helps her mother confront death [ and enter hell], by spouting  the kinds of bromides expected from a guest of an Oprah Winfrey special.  Tonally, the series is all over the map.  I love a good horror movie, but every story, regardless of genre, needs clear motivations for its characters, and this failed miserably.  Fiona is ultimately irredeemable and soulless and wishes her daughter's death, though when her daughter is mutilated by acid earlier in the plot, she is distraught and overtaken with grief?  And Misty - the life-giving witch - is trapped in hell?  In general, unsatisfying.  Too much is too easy and too little is good.",1514851200,,1166,4.933333333333334

6020497,5,B00FQY4C86,"""Coven"" stands on the top of ""American Horror Story"" for several reasons. Before I get to that, I want to say that this is an excellent season to introduce you to the show if you have not yet watched it, but the first two seasons are worthy enough. It's just that ""Freak Show"" starts to bring about major and definite ties to other seasons, and from that point on, knowing the events of the previous seasons isn't as much a necessity as it is a privilege. As my review title states, ""Coven"" is my personal favorite season with ""Roanoke"" something of a very good to excellent season done completely differently from the rest of the series.

Jessica Lange returns as the current Supreme of a coven of witches in New Orleans under the cover of being an Academy for Extraordinarily Gifted Young Girls. She's a person of luxury who is a snake of a human. She has good traits, but dominantly, she's obsessed with keeping this image of herself more specifically by finding a cure for death. Being a Supreme entails that at one point in time, a witch is chosen and embodies way more gifts than the usual witches who typically 'specialize' in one form of magic. However, that Supreme passes at one point when the powers of the world choose another to rise. Lange's Supreme, as shown early and easily inferred, is starting to fall. Attendance and presence of the Academy witches who hail from Salem, MA is very low, perhaps historically low. Lange's character has a presence at the Academy but can perhaps be blamed for the very few witches they have due to these traits. It's certainly not Sarah Paulson, in what I believe is a series-best performance very close to ""Asylum,"" who is kind but strong and maintains one of the only steady positions in the Academy, the teacher to Lange's principal. Frances Conroy has a delicious role as a witch who oversees many covens, and the young witches are great, particularly Gabourey Sidibe.

Quick note- I'm writing this review quickly, and I can't remember all of the characters' names, so I'm just going with the actors for now.

It's Sidibe who is tempted to join the voodoo witches on the other side of town, led by a ruthless and mercenary Angela Bassett, but Lange has a working relationship with Bassett. It's unsteady as a boat deck in stormy weather, but they have come to realize that they sometimes need each other's unique strengths. Kathy Bates also plays the first non-fictional character of the series, a slaver who believes it to be her duty in life to not change her beliefs in any way. How the slaver comes to be involved in a modern day scenario, I'll leave for the show to explain.

Major themes I noticed include forgiveness, rising to be the person you need to be, obsession, forgiveness (or rather, non-forgiveness), power, nature vs nurture, probably feminism and others. I say 'probably feminism' because feminism includes exploring diverse female characters as well as showing that women are not weaker than men, but the series explores more themes in the realm of feminism than just that simple statement. It's also very funny at times and doesn't seem to take itself too seriously, throwing in some references at high energy points so you can release that energy on a positive note rather than a dreary one. While the latter is almost necessary in horror, sometimes it's nice to have a break from form. The recent ""IT"" proved that nicely, I feel. Still, it has a fantastic opening credit sequence, interesting storylines and a definite focus from the first episode to the last.  That's pretty much what I hope to have from a season of American Horror Story, and ""Coven"" provides that for me best of all seasons through the seventh so far.",1512432000,,3698,4.709428129829985

This season is good but it is unfocussed and the story is all over the place, it fails to create an atmosphere of dread. Main characters are murdered and are brought back to life without reason, storylines are introduced that lead to deadends.

Rich writing, filmed in N'Awlins, a place I've visited many times. The production crew does not scrimp on resurrecting the unique architecture mixed with classic terror-noir techniques (spine tingling shadows on walls, underlighting the chin of dark characters, etc) that even the real MLV would truly appreciate. You can tell the cast loved making this film. This is the best AHS series of them all IMO. Kudos to everyone involved. Ab-soul-lutely loved it.",1508803200,,626,5.463917525773196

I'm pretty sure I have the season to season, from one to the next relationship,  pinned down. But no spoilers from me. I think quite a few fans, including myself, think we've got it.

I love how it's set in modern day New Orleans, and aside from learning about the abilities of each witch, the cat fight started by Marie Laveau stirred up a conflict between the witches, the self-proclaimed ""Supreme"" and the Voodoo Queen no one should provoke! XD

It was nice seeing Zoe as she coped with her new status as a witch and her ""Black Widow"" ability throughout Coven, and how she was able to find someone to love after she accidentally killed her previous boyfriend...

6020574,2,B00FQY4C86,The season starts off strong but quickly spiraled into a gratuitous series of disjointed events. Every character seems to let you down by the end of the season.

6020845,2,B00FQY4C86,"Started out okay but boy did it head downhill. There's only so many episodes one can take featuring Jessica Lange behaving like a deceitful old crone. No creativity in the writing whatsoever and the characters for the most part are not developed well or very believable. The scene in episode 11 where they behead a terrified live chicken on film, apparently for real, has turned me off to the whole series anyway. That wasn't necessary. And no, it didn't look like special effects to me. As a believer in animal rights I cannot support this series.",1475712000,,548,4.71875

6020848,5,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story is absolutely brilliant. Season 3 continues that brilliance that began with Season 1.

The series is unique in many ways, one of the most extraordinary things is the use of the same cast as different characters from season to season, like a troupe of Shakespearean actors traveling from stage to stage in Old England.

The production values are top notch and the writing is splendid. Of course the acting is simply superb with Jessica Lang and Cathy Bates leading as the headliners to the whole thing.

And anything that takes the genius of David Bowie and Roxy Music and puts it to such apt uses is another cherry on top! Lang's version of LIFE ON MARS is perfect for the lyric; ""it's the best selling show"".

No two characters are alike despite being played by the same people each season these guys do an amazing job at portraying a different and super strange character!!!

6020865,4,B00FQY4C86,"This season was the best so far the cinematography, the soundtrack, the characters. Mostly Angela Bassett, Jessica Lange, and Emma Robert especially were fantastic.

6020866,2,B00FQY4C86,Most definitely the worst of the first three seasons. To be fair though it's really a different kind of story telling completely. Some people may prefer it but it's just not scary or creepy at all. No matter though it was still worth a watch for me to see how the roles all change for the same actors.

I hated the 2nd season and have not yet seen the season about the hotel. Season 3 is not for the faint of heart. I actually got very offended by it, when it was running on FX and stopped watching it. My niece talked me into giving it another chance. I still find some of the scenes offensive, but I can get past them, because the story is so good, and so is the acting by almost the entire cast. Be prepared for torture, gore, masturbation, murder, incest and that's just the beginning. I am starting to think that there is something seriously wrong with Ryan Murphy.

Blu Ray Review
""Zombie Halloween"" focuses on the making of the Halloween special, with nods the that ""other"" zombie show. ""Enter the Coven"" features interviews & behind the scenes footage and ""Meet Ms. Nola"" looks at the production moving to New Orleans this season.",1469750400,,526,5.261904761904762

6021006,2,B00FQY4C86,"Too much blood. Too Much guts. Too much killing. Too much seeing young teenager like girls killing others and slashing with glee. Just plain old too much
Violence and macabre scenarios.

Plot was okay. The ambience of New Orleans the white plantation like
House and town square house. The telling of how black slaves were treated
Was too graphic.

Too much unnecessary sex including a teenage threesome. And I'm quite sure
There are teenagers watching this stuff. Monkey see monkey eventually do.
As the saying goes. I feel the show went too far. This is actually my first time
Viewing an entire season of this series.

At this moment I'm not gung ho about watching any other season. But I won't
Say never since I like a good mystery of something similar to Night Gallery,
But the writer needs to tone it down.",1467158400,,810,4.65034965034965

Having a large voodoo African American as possibly the only poc was sort of gimmicky, but did not affect the story negatively.

Coven was my fav, really, really good  as are most l all the seasons..
The most recent season Hotel, I felt was not as good as previous seasons. The new one looks to be zombies...HOW ORIGINAL? NOT VERY. How about something historical on another land. Ghosts in England,  France, Italy ?  Go back to New Orleans.

I will admit that some of the things that took place could have been done better and more effectively, e.g. the reason of the story line with the lady next door and how it ended, Misty's death, and other random moments. The main problem was the season finale. Every Coven fan I know agrees that it was such a let down.

6021226,5,B00FQY4C86,"My favorite season as it introduces the incredible Kathy Bates in a role that probably wouldn't be as well done by anyone else I can think of. Jessica Lange was pretty amazing too. Then we got Angela Bassett. It was like watching the most unexpected trinity of talent come together and make it work. That had to be professionalism at it's best because normally, someone would go full diva and there'd be chemistry problems. The writers balance screen time with talent and don't take horrible detours in the story (hello Asylum, I'm talking about YOU).

Money well spent and will be watching again and again.",1454630400,,607,4.780952380952381

6021251,3,B00FQY4C86,I started with this season because of Kathy Bates.  I really had never watched the program before so she was my incentive.

6021322,5,B00FQY4C86,"At least among my friends who like AHS, this season is a bit controversial. Half of them hated it, half of them loved it. I fall into the latter category.

A very, very brief synopsis of this season: A young woman discovers that she is a witch and attends a boarding school for witches. The school is in turmoil however as it needs to find a new Supreme to lead the school and there are conflicts with a rival group. This season, like every season of AHS, is a stand alone. You do NOT need to watch the previous two seasons first.

One of the big complaints I noticed is that this season is ""campy."" I thought that was part of the appeal of this season. Without posting any spoilers, I enjoyed watching alliances form and change and people coming together for a common cause. It reminded me a bit of Harry Potter, but with more blood/terror.

The really best part in my eyes was the fantastic acting jobs. Angela Basset is incredible. Sarah Paulson shines. And Jessica Lange... Need I say more? The whole cast meshes well and brings life into their characters.

As mentioned earlier, every season is a standalone season. You can start with this season or any other season and not miss out on anything major (there are a few connections between the seasons that you may miss out on until later, but missing these won't take anything major away from the experience). They each have a different flavor to them, so just because you don't like this one doesn't mean you won't find something enjoyable about the others. Check them all out. It really is a great series.",1451779200,,1562,4.508833922261484

6021332,5,B00FQY4C86,"By far the best of the American Horror story plot lines. The group of actors/actresses are incredibly chosen for each role and each episode gets you more and more addicted to the show. In true AHS style there are some gory and scary parts but this season also showcases a whimsical side that will make you wish you were born a witch. Jessica Lange dominates this exciting series once again and she couldn't be better. There are a few musical pieces that seem irrelevant and at times like time fillers but other than that, I'd say this season will cast a spell on you!",1451088000,,567,4.461538461538462

6021343,3,B00FQY4C86,"One of my favorite seasons of this show. Unfortunately, the writers couldn't restrain their racial bias. The story takes place in present day, Marie Laveau has been alive some 200 years, yet with all her power, she's still living in the hood and cooking in her backyard. Really? Maria can't afford to pay a contractor to build her an indoor kitchen, but the white witches who are also ancient have a damn mansion (with a modern kitchen might I add)?",1449532800,,449,4.625

It has it's moments but this season doesn't stand up to Season 1 or Season 2 in my opinion.  Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates are both great and were it not for them I think this season would have been my last.  I felt like this went from being an FX show with great actors and great story to an MTV show with a few good actors and a bad plot.

'American Horror Story' ranks right up there with all of these and I would gladly continue to watch upcoming seasons.

6021386,5,B00FQY4C86,"This season is good, really good. Jessica Lange is phenomenal as Fiona, the supreme witch. Angela Basset is fierce, as always, as her archrival, the legendary Marie Leveau. If you're into Southern Gothic art and literature, you will love this season. It it set between the present and nineteenth-century Lousiana, with flashbacks in each episode. Kathy Bates plays a sadistic slave owner whom the audience hopes will get her due by the end of the season. The supporting cast of young witches including Gabourey Sidibe and Emma Roberts provides comic relief when things get a little too tense. Who's gonna be the next Supreme? It ain't Diana Ross, baby!  I'm only half way through the season right now but am already impressed by the quality of this show. Watch this! You will feel better after you do!",1448409600,,801,4.846715328467154

6021430,2,B00FQY4C86,"I actually liked this show's second season ""Asylum"", campy as it was. But Season 3 descends into farce and plot confusion. Where do I begin to list what went wrong?  **** Spoiler Alerts Ahead *****

1) Coredelia' Eyesight - First she can see, then somebody blinds her with acid, then she gets eyeball transplants and can see again, then she blinds herself for no good reason, then finally and miraculously she recovers her eyesight. It's all too much.
2) Resurrections - Nearly every character dies and gets brought back to life at least once. Again, it's too ridiculous. The talents of actor Evan Peters are wasted as he spends most of the season as a sewn-together Frankenstein who can barely utter a word. Witch Myrtle Snow gets burned at the stake, resurrected, then later insists they burn her again at the stake because she violated some witch law. How plausible is that?
3) Musical artist Stevie Nicks of Fleetwood Mac appears on the show this season and much time is wasted listening to her off-key singing. She really needs all the advantages of modern studio technology to sound good, and unfortunately the show's producers let her use her real voice.
4) The ""Queenie"" character tried my patience by dithering back and forth about where her loyalties lay. Come to think of it, most of the characters had that problem which made the show so tiresome to watch. Shifting loyalties, double crosses, often based on the whims of the moment - yada, yada, yawn.
5) The tongueless, dishevelled butler Spalding was just disgusting. But I liked the jazz musician who was also an axe-murderer; he actually lent some class to the show. Kathy Bates as Delphine LaLaurie was amusing, especially when her severed head in a box kept talking trash or begged to be fed fast food.",1447632000,3,1770,4.781045751633987

6021439,3,B00FQY4C86,"I was tossing back and forth between 3 or 4 stars. I landed on 3 because I always compare each new AHS to the first: Murder House. That season was good, I was so excited to have found the show and thought it was a cool concept to have the same characters but a different story for each season. Coven was okay, I watched the entire season, so it couldn't have been too bad. Without giving too much away, (so maybe don't read this part as it may be a spoiler alert) too many characters kept dying, and then coming back to life. So every time someone died, it wasn't all that suspenseful because you recognized the theme of resurrection. I did want to find out the end of who is the supreme, so I stuck with it. Without sounding to anti-feminine, it also seemed to appeal more to women. Being a woman, I found a lot of it catty and confirming women's obsession with beauty standards, and need for men, which drove me  a bit crazy. It was almost like a tween mini series based off The Craft from the 90's. It was good mindless entertainment, but I wouldn't recommended it for anything deeper than that.",1447632000,,1098,4.304347826086956

Other than that it was great. I love the amount of visual gory details and all the actors did well, as usual. Also this particular season is good because it defies so many lines with religion being included. I'm going to try not to spoil it for those who haven't watched yet but all I'm going to say is that the nuns and other main characters do things that aren't expected.

It's like the writers couldn't figure out how to start wrapping things up and went off track, like some say....""It jumped the shark"" on us.  So far the only American Horror Story I've really enjoyed was the 1st one, I couldn't even get through the second one, Asylum, and then the 3rd one, well...you be the judge, but then again, if you are stuck in the house on a rainy day with nothing better to do, well, you might check it out, I would say I wish I could get my time back, but then I wouldn't be here giving you this summary that might help someone chose something else which might be really worth it.",1446768000,,710,4.175182481751825

6021584,5,B00FQY4C86,First off I'm not a fan of gore for the sake of gore. Which is why I can not watch any of the other AMS seasons. With that said I LOVE this season. I visited New Orleans and on several walking tours they did some referencing to this season. Coven takes place in NOLA. So I watched it out of curiosity because I love that city! This is one of the best season's I've seen. The story was so captivating I wish the whole AMS run was based on it.

6021599,5,B00FQY4C86,I am obsessed with American Horror Story! I started with Coven and then went back to season 1. This season is by far my favorite!! So much so that I've watched it twice!! Jessica Lange is so sexy and seductive in this season. Lily Rabe's Stevie Nicks obsession makes the season for me! Maybe it's because I was named after a Stevie Nicks song and love her so much! Evan Peters is cute as always. But the winner for best performance has to go to Sarah Paulson!! Her character goes through so much during the season and she plays the part so well!,1444867200,,545,4.300970873786408

6021604,5,B00FQY4C86,"This was so good. But so scary. I have a love-hate relationship with horror stuff because I get SO SCARED. But I love this series with the way they do a new story every season and utilize the same actors, just in different roles. It really allows us to see the range these actors possess.  Jessica Lange is always just brilliant. And the visuals are great, the dialogue stylish and engaging, it's just overall really a well made show. Lots of triggers there for anyone with any past issues about, well, anything at all, but particularly racism, homophobia, and rape. These triggering scenes just add to the terror I feel when watching this series. It's like going on a roller coaster. You want the adrenaline rush but at the same time you are scared to death.

This is a very disturbing series. It's not for the faint of heart. Every season I do the same silly thing where I start out binge watching it and after every episode I am so scared and think the there isn't anything worse that could possibly happen in the next episode and I am always wrong, it's always something worse. The terror just keeps rising and rising.  I had nightmares during the watching of this Coven story. Disclaimer here, I have not finished this season completely yet because I got so scared that I am taking a little break. I am sure the story will pull me back in soon because I really want to know what will happen next. All of my darkest fears seem to be touched in the show.",1444867200,2,1457,4.42910447761194

6021637,5,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror story has become my favorite show even with a few short comings in the third season.
It's set in New Orleans, which makes the entire show worth watching for that alone. New Orleans is like a character by herself. This season wasn't really scary nor was their a lot of tension. The story lines and character development which keeps you watching. They go for the gross out a time or two. The Coven acts more like a story about sorority sisters more than a group of evil powerful witches. There wasn't much action replaced instead with a lot of talking. I get it, special effects are expensive but splurge. Now that they have a loyal following they're skimping on the action. I hope they fix this in coming seasons.
Over all though, it's just a fun ride. Jessica Lange elevates the entire series to another level. I was worried Kathy Bates, because of her acting skill, would distract from the core plot but she was brilliant.
If you love the show, this season doesn't dissapoint.",1444176000,,993,4.6158192090395485

6021640,4,B00FQY4C86,Allot of people make fun of this season of AHS and I will admit it has its flaws. Namely that they wasted Evan Peter's talent on a character who is a mute through most of the movie. But other characters are gloriously colorful. The unique thing about this season is it's sometimes campy but also very witty humor. After re watching it I discovered even more ridiculously entertaining one liners from Myrtle Snow (easily my favorite AHS character ever) The story does fall flat for the middle of the season but picks up pretty well at the end.

6021660,4,B00FQY4C86,"By far my favorite season of American Horror Story.  The lighter side of evil was a nice reprieve after Asylum and I love how over the top they went with each of the characters and the actresses all seemed to thoroughly enjoy themselves throughout.  Angela Bassett and Kathy bates were phenomenal adds to the regular AHS crew but the glory must go to Lange who earned the Emmy she received for this season.  We are in turns able to despise and sympathize with her all season long.  I can't imagine a season will ever top this one for me.

I have one caveat, the only reason I couldn't give it five stars was the portrayal of Papa Legba.  It was really unfortunate that they went there with an important religious figure - imagine if the show had Jesus appear and demand that his followers murder schoolchildren - that would be the equivalent and people wouldn't have stood for it.",1444089600,2,880,4.50314465408805

That ending was a load of hickory horse balls and so anti-climactic I couldn't believe it. It was the WORST. It was so bad that SPOILERS -> cordelia the blind woman is magically healed and becomes supreme just cause why not. then she reveals the existence of witches to the media. WTF

6021708,5,B00FQY4C86,"This show is the perfect balance between a real storyline that can carry through an entire season and a horror/thriller, in my opinion.  I'm not a fan of straight-forward horror, so this is perfect for me. The Asylum season (each season is a new theme, new plot) seemed geared toward an older crowd, and this one seems to appeal to a 20's and 30's age-range.  However, there is also the contemplation of pending mortality, as well as several flashes back to colonial times, so I suppose it has a bit for all.  Excellent cast, great twists in the plot line, and overall a must-see!",1442102400,,580,4.5576923076923075

HOWEVER, if blood and guts and gore are your thing (they're mine) you will love this show.  Start at the beginning with Murder House (season 1) and work your way through the series.  I won't give any spoilers here....I hate spoilers.  But I will say that Jessica Lange and Sarah Paulson are amazing.  Kathy Bates is a perfect fit for her role and Lily Rabe kills it.  But Angela Bassett KILLS it as the voodoo priestess.",1440633600,,518,4.4

6021928,3,B00FQY4C86,"While the first two seasons had their share of weirdness--sex-crazed possessed nuns, Nazi scientists, rapist in a rubber suit, Season 3 really goes beyond the absurd. Teen witches obliterating an army of zombies with a chainsaw, bible-thumping mothers administering enemas to grown sons, Precious masturbating to seduce a man-beast (yikes), decapitated talking heads, no less than a half dozen regular characters are resurrected after their demise or are dismembered multiple times.

COVEN is too female-dominated, Ms. Lange appears frequently bored, and the tone wavers all over the place. Angela Bassett really brings it though as the High Priestess of Voodoo in the New Orleans setting and the always-dependable Frances Conroy again proves why she can be considered the Agnes Moorehead of this generation. She never gives a bad performance, no matter how ridiculous the script. Stevie Nicks guests in two episodes but the results are underwhelming.

Interesting only to see what direction they are going to go in next, but nowhere near as good as Murder House or Asylum.",1440028800,,1073,5.34319526627219

6021992,4,B00FQY4C86,"This version of American Horror Story began to show some torn seams and holes in the story-telling. Did it bother anyone else that one key character was killed twice? How do you kill a ghost? This season the show dealt with bringing the dead back to life...frequently...so maybe I missed a moment when this character was brought back to life, but it still rang false.

I was also troubled by the level of torture-porn in a TV show. At one point it had me wondering if we, the audience, were any better than the racist Southerner portrayed by Kathy Bates, taking pleasure in the very graphic evisceration of a black character.

Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett are welcome additions to the cast. The young cast members portraying the developing witches were strong. It was great to see Taissa Farmiga back in the cast, and Evan Peters was as great as ever. Lily Rabe's Stevie Nicks-wannabe character, Misty Day, was her most sympathetic of any AHS season thus far.

The most innovative horror was depicting Hell as a place where you have to relive moments of terror over and over again for all eternity.",1439510400,,1100,4.689119170984456

6022091,4,B00FQY4C86,"If you liked the first two seasons of AMERICAN HORROR STORY, then you'll love the third season, subtitled COVEN.  This time the anthology series heads down south to New Orleans and sets the action in a school for young witches.  That is the main story for this season, but as in the previous ones, there is always multiple story lines happening at once.  At times it seems like each character is a twisted arc all their own as their plot threads play out over thirteen episodes.  Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk have a real knack for this kind of everything including the kitchen sink story telling and they don't let their fans down this time.

As always, AHS is not for those who offend easily, this season we are treated to: bloody torture, rape, self mutilation, incest, necrophilia, pedophilia, hardcore racism, not to mention a mother giving an enema to her adult son, and of course, Jessica Lange drinking a lot and cursing up a storm.  Consider yourself warned.

The season centers around a gaggle of young witches played by Tessa Farmiga, Emma Roberts, Gabourney Sibide, and Jan Brewer who have been sent to the Big Easy to learn how to use their powers by  headmistress Sarah Paulson, whose mother, played by Lange, is the Supreme Witch, head of the coven and capable of performing The Seven Wonders, all specific acts of magic.  But it seems that Lange, who has spent many years away, is dying of cancer and must relinquish her title.  The problem: Lange is not ready to go, and is gunning for any young witch who might take her place.  The bigger problem: these young modern witches have minds of their own and are not about to be led to the slaughter by their elder.  Things do get ugly before the final episode, where a new Supreme is crowned, only it's not who you might expect.

The main subplot concerns series newcomers, Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett, as Madame LaLaurie, an immortal Old South aristocrat from the 19th Century and Marie LeVeau, the equally immortal voodoo priestess, who cursed LaLaurie with eternal life back in the day and buried her alive.  LeVeau, who is at war with Lange's coven, doesn't like it one bit when her enemy digs up LaLaurie and gives her a job as a maid in the Witch's Academy.  LaLaurie, for her part, is aghast at having to serve blacks and horrified that someone like Obama is President.  Is this a sly commentary on the Tea Party?  Bates and Bassett are the best thing about this season-two real scenery chewers doing what they do best and I was a little disappointed by the flat resolution of their story line in the next to last episode.

A lot of series regulars are back, besides Lange and Paulson, there is Frances Conroy as a ginger headed witch who gets burned at the stake more than once; Denis O'Hare as a butler with a real thing for dolls, living or otherwise; Evan Peters as a frat boy Farmiga becomes smitten with, who well earns the name of Frankenteen; Lily Rabe as a swamp witch who can raise the dead.  Other newcomers are: Danny Huston, as an ax wielding psycho of a trumpet player whose had a thing for Lange a very long time; Lance Reddick as Papa Legba, the shrewd king of hell; Pattie LuPone as a Christian fundamentalist neighbor and Alexander Dreymon as her hunky son to whom Brewer takes a shine.  Familiar faces like Mare Winningham and Leslie Jordan also turn up in small parts.  And Stevie Nicks is Stevie Nicks, the witch who sings Rhiannon and Seven Wonders.

They do a great job of creating the proper New Orleans atmosphere, exotic and ominous at the same time; how cool would it if the characters of COVEN were to encounter Louis, Lestat and the Mayfair witches of Anne Rice's books or run into Sookie, Eric and Bill Compton from Charlaine Harris's TRUE BLOOD.  Only in fan fiction.

The acting is great as usual, even if it is over the top, by now does Bates qualify as the 21st Century Shelley Winters? Roberts nails it in a wicked take down of the spoiled Hollywood teen star and no one does the Dragon Lady act better than Lange.  I do think some of the targets  Murphy and Falchuk take on this season-southern racists, sexists and Christian fundamentalists-are easy ones that Hollywood loves to trash.  And if the message of this show is female empowerment, then it's a very mixed one considering the witchin' and bitchin' these ladies do during the course of the season.

But no one tunes into AMERICAN HORROR STORY for the preaching or the sermons.  I always make it a point to catch it on Blu Ray, where I can watch four episodes at one time.  Cannot wait for FREAK SHOW to come out.",1438214400,,4579,4.548780487804878

Once I finished Asylum, I moved right on into Coven and OMG this was an amazing season!  The story line is still quite twisted, but theres a warmer feel to this season than Asylum.

The cast has some familiar faces, but also has some new folks who are just as good.  The only thing I will say is I knew how the whole season would end by the end of the first episode.  Had it nailed.  There was too much emphasis on finding the next supreme and yet it was almost like everyone purposely avoided the thought that it could maybe be Cordelia.  They also spent the rest of the season avoiding it.  That told me right off that bat that it would be her.  Although I knew how it would end, it certainly didn't ruin it for me.

I love that all the girls have unique abilities.  It wasn't a standard cookie cutter witch story with cookie cutter witch characters.  My favorite ability was the girl who was a walking voodoo doll.

Also, Marie Laveau is a main character!  I was psyched to hear that name on the show.  There is so much legend that surrounds the Voodoo Queen of New Orleans that she pops up in fiction all over the place (check out the Night Huntress series by Jeaniene Frost!!!) and I love it when she gets involved in stories.  Angela Bassett really brought a scary darkness to the character.  She was awesome.

To top it off, Madame LaLaurie is in this season too!!!  LaLaurie is an infamous serial killer in New Orleans from the 1700s or 1800s (fact check me, people!) and she was big into torture.  It was kind of awesome seeing her story come to life and then woven into the AHS story line.  Loved it.

Overall, I am totally digging American Horror Story as a whole.  The show was much more than I had anticipated going in.  There is a little bit of something for everyone.  Paranormal/supernatural, aliens, and just plain and simply twisted humans.  One thing I will say about this show is I love the fact that all of the actors play totally different characters in a totally different story year to year.  Its a unique set up and one that ensures the show won't get stale.",1436918400,,2108,4.37984496124031

6022238,5,B00FQY4C86,"This series is a bloodbath of satire, sarcasm, and insults. If you want to laugh your guts out watching women tear each other apart verbally (and other ways), then this is your show. And it's not just each other. They claw the eyes out of their own gender, and are a little less brutal with us guys, but we get slammed, too. They treat the South with acid sarcasm and name calling. They make fun without stopping of white people, and they drag African Americans trough cultural slime, too. The elderly get no respect. The young are absurd idiots.  The world of big name fashion is mercilessly disemboweled in almost every episode. American Horror Story just goes on and on with no apology and nothing to even hint at an apology for insulting everyone everywhere no matter what. Jessica Lange is the perfect choice for her leadership role in the witch house.

To my brothers out there: yes, this is one, long chick flick. And you'll need to wear your chick flick glasses to understand it. But you'll pick up on it by the end of the first or second episode, and you'll understand why I'm raving about a chick flick series. It is actually hysterically funny, and you'll need to hit pause more than you expect just so that you can stop laughing before the actresses do or say anything more.",1435536000,7,1286,4.538793103448276

Personally, I'm not a horror fan. This is tolerable horror for me. I can deal with blood and guts, but I don't like things like Saw, Freddy and Jason, etc.

 I love stories about witches, powers etc. If you're a 90s baby, check this out. If you loved The Craft, check this out! You'll be rooting (haha) for the villains one day, hating them the next. Who is a true friend? Who is a true foe? Can people really change and be redeemed?

What's great about AHS series is that they are standalone, this is actually the first one I've seen and I love it the most. This season portrays multi-faceted, powerful women. They really run the world. And it's great. I didn't want it to end; I wish we could have a second season of Coven!",1434067200,,793,4.266666666666667

6022386,5,B00FQY4C86,"I started watching AHS on TV with season three, Coven. Followed up with season 4. Freak Show.  Both seasons were entertaining with interesting story lines, excellent acting and over-the-top characters. Using Amazon Prime, I recently back and watched the seasons one and two. If season 4 was also included in Prime, I would have watched it again. Of the four seasons, I liked season 3 the best, followed by season 2, 1 & 4.  Looking forward to season 5, Hotel next year.  Just wish there were a few more episodes per season.",1433721600,,523,4.663043478260869

6022557,2,B00FQY4C86,"Coven was by far the worst of out of all the American Horror Story seasons, it portrayed the characters ever so clich with black outfits in stereotypical witch style, not to mention the over use of Latin, that has no business in the world of witchcraft, as it is the language used by the Holy Roman Catholic Church that was founded during the reign of the Roman Empire.  Witchcraft is rather old, most likely predates Christ and practiced in various regions of the world and these so-called incantations would be spoken in a local dialect and not in the language of Christianity, the enemy of satanic arts.  Stevie Nicks, really?!? how cheesy was that? Now, let's move onto the blatant racist anti-white tone set half way through the season, sad really that you run out of creativity, so you have to run to the shock value of the race card? race relations right now are at an all time low, most likely even worse than in the 60's, so this did nothing for any entertainment value, it was not Roots or some period piece, just a show that ran out of steam and needed a jolt to the ratings.  After the First season, I stomached Asylum, what with the Nazi Doctors, Aliens, Zombies, serial killers and Demons all at the same time, that was just ridiculous, but it was ok.  I've been told that the next season Freak Show is just terrible and not worth the time.  I expected so much and was so very disappointed in this season, it is all too reminiscent of True Blood and how quickly it went down hill.  I would not waste my time on this season or even the next.  Season One was really good and very entertaining, what happened to the writing here?!?",1432252800,3,1642,4.4352159468438535

One gigantic irk as with other ""Salem"" witch themed shows-those ladies in Salem weren't witches, they were f-ing persecuted by men in power, and not for being witches. That's the scary part, right, that we forget normal women were burned and drowned by men abusing their power. Other than that the little goth girl in me really thought it was swell, and wonderfully disgusting. Is it horror light if I like it?",1431993600,,506,4.761363636363637

The third season was better, but I think my wife liked it more than I did.  It's still a little too graphic for me, but my worst complaint about both seasons is that  I can't really find any ""horror"" in these shows.  Still, if you like this type of show, Prime is the way to watch them.",1430352000,,431,3.9195402298850577
6022848,1,B00FQY4C86,"The only reason this gets a star is because I cannot rate it at no stars.
Don't get me wrong.  The show is fine - fantastic - and it was one of the best seasons ever.  The show however is one thing.  This waste of money is something else altogether.

The Blu-ray set of this season is a TOTAL ABSOLUTE WASTE OF MONEY.  I MAY AS WELL HAVE FLUSHED  $100 DOWN THE FREAKIN' TOILET WHEN I ORDERED THESE SEASONS (2 and 3 on DVD).

Like an idiot I trusted that these things would be real Blu-ray discs that could be played on a Blu-ray player.  ANY Blu-Ray player.  Little did I know about 20th Century Fox's plans to design malicious discs and rip off consumers by selling us Blu-ray sets that won't play in our Blu-ray players.  Just like the X-Men Days Of Future Past movie which also won't play on most Blu-ray players, this set won't either.  It is bad enough that they charge you $50 for a 13 episode season.  But to charge that price for a set that won't even play is criminal.  Execs at 20th Century Fox should be rounded up and jailed for this con job..

Because I trusted that the discs would play I didn't hurry to watch them.  Now I am stuck with copies of season 2 & 3 that are absolutely useless and won't play on any of my Blu-ray players.

And even if I could persuade the powers that be to give me a refund on a few months old and year old release, the credit cards (loadable gift card type) have long been used up and I long ago destroyed the physical cards - along with the security numbers I'd need in order to access any refund.  So I'm just out that money and there is absolutely NOTHING I can do about it.  I have a useless product and if I want the season I may have be out ANOTHER $100 just to buy the 2 seasons as inferior dvd sets.  ""INFERIOR"" in that the dvd sets may not have all the content or hold the content on fewer discs - but at least the dvd versions, unlike the Blu-ray versions - MIGHT play and be of some use - for my $200 investment.

In the future I will check every dvd & Blu-ray movie and series I purchase.  Anything put out by 20th Century Fox will get a pass.  I don't know about anyone else, but I can't afford to flush $100 down the toilet like this or continue doing business with a company which has proven to be untrustworthy.

I urge anyone reading this to avoid buying this or ANY other 20th Century Fox released dvd sets of movies like the plague.  Because you will find you are flushing your money down the toilet as well.

After trying to play the first disc, not only would it not play, but I couldn't even get the disc to eject.  Even after unplugging the player and plugging it back in.  I have no idea what sort of malware these creeps are putting into these discs to stop them from PLAYING on most players, but it should be banned, and it may have cost me the price of a Blu-Ray player as well.

I LOVE the show and want to support it.  And I sure as hell did.  But I sure didn't plan to get robbed and watch my money ($100 in all - not including the expensive player with the disc that won't eject now due to 20th Century Fox's malware attacks on our Blu-Ray disc players) get flushed down the toilet by a bunch of corporate weasels who steal money from the public and deliver ABSOLUTELY WORTHLESS AND USELESS goods in exchange.

THERE WAS A TIME WHEN DOING SUCH THINGS WAS ILLEGAL.  It should be again.  I URGE YOU TO NOT ONLY NOT BUY THIS SHOW ON BLU-RAY BUT BOYCOTT ANY AND ALL 20TH CENTURY FOX RELEASES.

BUYER BEWARE!  THIS IS AN ABSOLUTE RIP-OFF!!!",1430265600,,3510,4.149629629629629

It's set in New Orleans, a city of witches and voodoo princesses, of coke-sniffing deities and white supremacists.  The art direction is remarkable - evocative sets and cringeworthy makeup all add to the dark mood of this season. Kudos to the ensemble cast.  What more could you want?  Oh, yeah, Stevie Nicks visits Miss Robichaux's Academy (a boarding school for witches).  Definitely over the top - just the way it should be.

Tapping into true life stories, like that of Delphine LaLaurie and keeping them alive was a nice touch.  As much of a Stevie Nicks fan as I am, I thought that little part was a little over the top and unnecessary, but the series as a whole, was fun, a little creepy (could have used more creep) and a good watch.

6023149,3,B00FQY4C86,"I felt this was a step up from the second season.  Season 2 had too many plot lines going that went no where, but the show could have been awesome if they picked one of the many possible plots that got side lined.  This season was better because there were other stories that came up, but for the most part it's focused on the coven.

The following has spoilers.

I did find there to be some weak points, but nothing that made me stop watching.  For example:
1) A character can bring others back from the dead.  This quickly becomes very silly.  Someone dies in a dramatic way in one episode, will don't worry because that character comes back in the next episode (and we are supposed to be shocked each time?).  These people come back from the dead and they are 100% their old selves?  Not some twisted soulless ""Pet Cemetery"" abomination?

2) As usual, characters in this series that aren't ""the favorites"" (i determine that by how i suspect the writers feel) get side lined towards the end of the season through death because the audience needs killing (ok it's a horror show so I should give that a pass, i guess what bothers me is that its too predictable on who's number will come up and when).

3) The Supreme.  Ok, the coven has a destined leader in each generation.  It's like the Sith Lord from Star Wars.  The emerging Supreme grows stronger and stronger as the previous Supreme grows weaker and weaker.  The main goal of the majority of the characters becomes ""being the next Supreme"" while the current one obsesses over losing her status.  Most of them want to ""be the boss"" just to be the boss.

It seems pretty childish too me.  It's especially silly because they explain that there are other covens, but we never see them (so even if you are the Supreme for your coven, won't there be others?  Or if there is 1 Supreme for all witches, what are the odds the Supreme isn't in another coven entirely?).

Then, you also have it explained the the witch population is on the decline.  They have had previous classes of 12 or so, but by 2014 or so they are reduced to a class of a mere 4.  It's like, you become Supreme of a sinking ship with like 6 total members, big achievement?  Like being a member with powers wouldn't have perks?  This fact is especially bad when they characters keep seeing others get killed so frequently.  No one stops and says ""lets really fix this""",1428105600,,2386,4.429885057471265

6023174,5,B00FQY4C86,"AHS does not disappoint and neither have previous seasons.  This season was a little more nail biting than others, which is what kept me going back to watch one episode after another.  The flashbacks to different time periods in order to give ""present day"" scenes their historic value of understanding the how/why.  Near the end when it all came together, I didn't want it to end.

Unfortunately I don't have much time to watch T.V. so I am grateful for my Prime Acct. which has allowed me to view this excellent series on my own time. The series changes with each new season while keeping many of the same talented actors/actresses although not all of them. Each new season is comprised of different stories about one subject per season. I honestly can't believe I never heard of AHS until recently. A great cast. Jessica Lange is superb in my opinion in every season. If you are looking for some bizarre stories that are quite believable then AHS is for you. I don't compare this series to the genre of ""gorey"" horror such as Carrie or other movies with the proverbial ax murderer. AHS stands on its own and does so very well. I won't tell you what it's about but will say if you can handle horrid wrongs being forced upon the undeserving then AHS will not disappoint. Excellent series.",1427328000,,952,4.540697674418604

6023400,1,B00FQY4C86,". . .Sorry. . .just waking up from the snoozefest that is AHS Coven. By far, the most non-frightening thing I've ever seen.

SPOILER ALERT!

When the last episode started with a Stevie Nicks music video, it was simply the final nail in the coffin. Nothing against Stevie Nicks, mind you. I love her songs and her voice. But what were the writers thinking?

Aside from a few fun moments involving zombies on the lawn and the sheer joy that Kathy Bates and Jessica Lange bring to anything they touch, ""Coven"" is 13 hours I wish I had spent reading a good book instead.

This was a silly, slow, sloppy season.",1427155200,4,606,4.4324324324324325

6023412,4,B00FQY4C86,"What a bizarre series. The stories are ok. Each season is a different story that is being told in parts. ""Coven"" was a story of witches that were dying out and not being replenished. The search for the master witch to lead the coven takes on a whole new meaning in this show. The story was enjoyable to an extent. Certainly not as good as the first season but better than the season before it. American Horror Story (AHS) takes the horror portion of the story too lightly and gives us drama based on things that might go bump in the night.

This is a decent series, I would wait until you can get it on sale, it's not worth the full asking price in my humble opinion.

Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates continue to dazzle.  I have never seen either Bassett or Bates in a role like this, and they continued to surprise.  Their acting styles are different, but they perfectly play off of each other. Some of their scenes were amongst my favorite in the series.

But the standout in Coven is Emma Roberts.  Who may or may not have the best lines, or the best role, but regardless, she was always captivating, delivering all her lines with gusto.  Heroine Zoe/Tessa Farmiga is clearly in the shadows, and though I don't dislike her, I personally don't think she has either the charisma to hold our attention, or has any chemistry with her Evan Peters/Kyle.

Favorite scene  when NO SPOILER HERE becomes the supreme.  How triumphant and absolutely right!  It was perfect.

Loved the whole mythology of the supremes.

6023619,4,B00FQY4C86,So far I think this has been my favorite of the the three season I have seen.  Would have given it a five star but I feel that 75% of the blood and gore in it is more for shock value than story value (don't get me wrong--some of it does help the story line).,1425945600,,258,3.690909090909091
6023620,4,B00FQY4C86,"I wouldn't say this is the best one of the series, but if you've watched any of them, all segments, then why would you doubt this won't be as good? If you haven't seen any, watch a free pilot and decide if it's for you.",1425945600,,219,3.888888888888889
6023621,4,B00FQY4C86,"The witches of New Orleans are on the defensive and discouraged from really using their powers.  They need to keep a low profile; there are witch hunters and all kinds of people out to get them.  That's the way it is until the prodigal Fiona (Jessica Lange) the ""rightful Supreme"" shows up to take the Coven back from her Goodie-two-shoes daughter Cordelia.  With a scotch in one hand and a cigarette in the other, Fiona is going to teach them what the dark side is all about.
This 3rd season of American Horror Story is the best one in my opinion, with the usual cast standing out in some very outlandish rolls.  Kathy Bates plays a character you should hate to the core and yet you end up rooting for her somehow.  The writing is excellent with little shockers seeded throughout the story line that may be troubling to the squeamish.  This is binge worthy watching, and also a show worth inviting a few friends over for. It's truly an event.

The only reason I could not give this series and all of the additional series a 5 Star is due to the endings. The endings are always lacking and never go that extra step, to go beyond your expectations.

The series does an incredible job to build up all this emotion and tension and than just drop you off at the end with a dud grenade of void. If they could perfext their endings this series would be incredible.",1425945600,,568,4.40952380952381

6023680,3,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story: Coven desperately wants to be shocking, hip, smart television. It wants to be that show you can't wait to talk to your friends about. And the saddest part is, it almost succeeds. Almost: such a damning word.

Make no mistake, the show is at times fun and daring, it has powerhouse performances from some dynamite actresses, and it has dialogue that crackles. But, despite all of that, the show amounts to a whole lotta sound and fury. There's no plot to hold the whole thing together. It hints at various plots: a centuries-old war between witchcraft and voodoo; an even older war between witches and witch hunters; the search for the next Supreme Witch. Any of these threads could have made a compelling season on their own, but instead they're half baked ideas crammed into one turkey of a season.

I know that American Horror Story is an anthology series with little to no connection from season to season, but that same structure shouldn't apply to the episodes of a given season. From one week to the next, we see radical shifts in characters' motivations, loyalties, powers, and even personalities. Now, I'm all for character growth, development, and change, but there should be some rationale beyond ""Oh, wouldn't it be cool if...?"" But no. Character gets into a jam? Give her a new power to resolve it. Same character gets into a slightly less complicated situation, suddenly that power is forgotten. (At one point, a character dies a tragic and somewhat heroic death. An episode or so later she shows up with no explanation more than, ""I guess my powers are growing."")

The show is fun, don't get me wrong. But by the time you get to the last four episodes, you find yourself wishing things would just wrap up and move along already. Maybe they'll get it right the next time around.",1425859200,,1814,4.734177215189874

6023745,5,B00FQY4C86,"It's an interesting series.  Not something I would have personally picked if I were just looking for a random series to watch.  But it's kept my attention.  As anyone who's seen one American Horror Story and started to watch another season, will know that they use the same actors in every different season.  So it's sometimes hard to shut your brain off from one season to another if you're watching multiple seasons at the same time.

It gives an interesting depiction of the Axe Murderer of New Orleans in 1919, which becomes of the ending half of the Coven season.  Obviously it's not going to be 100% accurate, but it's entertainment after all.  Which this whole entire series is, just entertainment.",1425081600,,705,4.776859504132231

There are so many twists and turns and thrown knives in backs of the characters, and who could forget the tongueless, always loyal to Fiona, Spaulding?  The characters are not shallow, they all have a full back story leading up to their arrival at the Academy.  This historical references also seem to be correct in their information, just embellished.  And the cameo appearances by Stevie Nicks are artfully woven into the story line.  Creepy, heartbreaking, and vengeful, it will make your head spin and reach for the next episode.  Very addictive.

An all-star cast including Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Angela Bassett play the roles of very powerful witches giving classes to young witches in a magic school. The young witches are under constant threat due to ignorance and bigotry and must be protected by the school leaders but not all leaders are good for the students as you will see. One of the younger witches is hiding her true and horrifying power(s) while the Supreme Witch, endowed with incredibly powerful skills overall, must face a new enemy in a local Voodoo priestess/Queen famously named Marie Loveau, the New Orleans top Voodoo practitioner(based on the actual woman's life). Kathy Bates plays the role of an immortal woman cursed by witches for mercilessly beating African slaves in gruesome ways.

Jessica Lang is again fantastic in this one, without her, the show would definitely fail.  She brings so much character and personality to the screen its amazing.",1424476800,,521,4.298969072164948

The acting is on point. I love the utilization of the actors in different roles each season, and the additions to the ensemble are always on point.  I was worried about the skill level of some of the younger actresses, but no one lets down their part.  Danny Huston is my favorite addition and plays one of the better ""New Orleans"" characters I've seen outside of a native.

This would be a five star if it wasn't for my dissatisfaction with the last act. This isn't for everyone, but it's very entertaining for those who like their drama with some magic and horror.",1424217600,,821,4.489932885906041

6024115,5,B00FQY4C86,"I loved this season of American Horror Story!

***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***  ***SPOILERS***

I'll admit that this season is a little edgy because of the stuff with slavery and how Kathy Bates treated African Americans back in the 1800's.  But other than that, I loved this season!  Seeing the characters with their magic powers and trying to fit into modern society while not revealing what they could do was pretty cool.

I have to confess right now that my favorite character in this season was Queenie.  And my favorite scene was when she was serving chicken to people and the guy was giving her guff so she burned her arm and caused him incredible pain to get him to shut up and take a hike.

While watching this season I have to ask, why would anyone want to be the Supreme anyway?  It seems like you would always be in danger, people always trying to kill you, people would always be wanting to usurp your power, and keeping these women in line would be a real pain.  Not to mention that these men who hunt witches would always have a bulls eye on your forehead.

All the actresses turned in great performances and I loved the ""Ax Man,"" storyline the best!  And I will admit that the episodes with the zombies in it was really cool as well!

6024122,1,B00FQY4C86,"I have mixed feelings about even writing a review for this 'program' ( I use the word program here in the sense of something that is fed into a computer to control its functioning).  Mixed because I know that no matter what I write, most of the general viewing public is still going to continue to feed at the trough, and worship at the altar of this psycho-sexual, horrific gore-fest.

  Clearly this lowest-common-denominator type show is popular; the majority of its over three thousand reviews giving it 5 stars.  I would give it no stars if that were allowed, but the review system forces me to grant it at least one.  Besides writing this review for myself, perhaps someone else not inclined to follow the lemmings off the cliff will take heed and be forewarned.

  I viewed parts of the previous two seasons, as much as I could stomach, before I began to have this sick feeling that whoever produced this dreck was playing some sort of dark and disgusting trick on the gullible public.  Granted, Jessica Lange was a vision in the first two seasons and there was some serious talent on the cast side of things, but it did not make up for the uneven writing nor the sense of disgust after watching an episode which would lead me to the shower to clean off the slime.

  Forcing myself to partake of this third season just to see if the creators had managed to dig themselves out of the mire, I was visually assaulted in the very first episode where Kathy Bates plays the black magic matriarch of a New Orleans family circa 1800's.  She holds black male slaves prisoner in her attic to harvest from them various bodily fluids and tissues - it was a depraved scene.  It took me two weeks to recover my self and go and finish the episode.  After that I watched two more full episodes and then had to stop.

  After some reflection I began to wonder about the subtext, or subconscious message of this series. With its 'diverse' cast it seemed to be very progressive in nature. Hidden amongst the overly sexualized females and scenes of explicit murder and gore, were some of the following themes:

1.) Slavery and torture (read anti white, because I'm sure there are any number of black folks who, after witnessing that opening segment, would be horrified and compelled to go and kill some 'crackas').  Later, in a surprise plot twist, the head witch gives the Kathy Bates character to a young black female witch in training, as her own personal slave to do with as she pleases...yeah that sound like some good old fashioned social justice to me.

2.) college fraternities (again read anti-white, this time male...didn't it feel good when that bus flipped over and those rapist white boys were burned up in the explosion...that's what they get!).

3.) The feminist agenda...witches as oppressed females?!?

I don't want to bang the drum too much about the politically inspired underpinnings of this program , but it was pretty obvious after all.  In the end I wonder about the ramifications on the public's psychological health when exposed to this type of programming, especially young kids.",1423785600,,3093,4.6938775510204085

6024134,3,B00FQY4C86,"This season is ok, but not nearly as good as the first two seasons. There is not as much character development in this season. I think a few more black magic acts and scare tactics were in order, and this season did not contain the sexual deviation and darkness of the prior seasons. I did watch it, and did enjoy it, but I was not drawn to watch episodes or even the season over again. What made the other two seasons especially good was the depth of character and the revelation of what brought each character to that particular moment in time. Though this season does attemp to do that, the characters are not nearly as dark and enigmatic as the previous seasons.",1423440000,,666,4.4227642276422765

While, I must say, it's not as horrific and eerie as the past two seasons of American Horror Story, it still holds up pretty well in my opinion. The cast fits perfectly together and Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, and Jessica Lange are really what kept me watching. Their evilness and egotistical attitudes throughout the show were so well portrayed, considering the fact that I doubt they are really that evil in their personal lives. Despite loving seasons 1 and 2 mainly for the darkness of the themes, I liked that this season wasn't as heavy on horror, unless you consider witchcraft scary.",1422921600,,662,4.666666666666667

The premise seemed to be a great idea, witchcraft, voodoo, torture, racial tension but the writers ended up doing a terrible job.  When half of your characters die and end up being brought back to life with little or no consequences, you know longer care what happens to the  in an episode because hey, it'll probably all be reversed by the  next episode anyway. For a show that's call American Horror Story you would think there'd be actual horror or at least a story. I liked season one and LOVED season two but I am so severely disappointed with this season. I will say the acting was superb as always but you can't act your way through a plotless show. Hopefully they hire new writers for their fourth season otherwise I fear American Horror Story is going to have quite a short run as a show. :(",1422662400,,929,4.421052631578948

6024191,4,B00FQY4C86,"This season centers on a witch's coven in New Orleans, one which functions as a boarding school geared toward protecting and developing the powers of young witches.  (Think X-Men, but for girls only.)  However, there is trouble at every turn, as the witches must contend with competing voodoo practitioners, a possibly diabolical governing council, an organization dedicated to hunting them down, and a crisis of succession centered on the waning powers and leadership of the coven's Supreme.

This third season ranks about as highly as Season 2.  It's certainly superior to the first season.  For anyone unfamiliar with American Horror Story, the show is an acquired taste.  By now, those of us who have stuck with it have come to appreciate its idiosyncrasies.  The plotting always strikes a peculiar balance between realism and suspension of disbelief, especially with regard to the way characters interact (i.e., trying to murder someone in one episode, then cozying up to them in the next, and then back again).  These changing allegiances are, from a viewer's perspective, spellbinding, and they contribute to the hyper-progression of the story.

What the viewer anticipates to be a long-term plotline that will unfold throughout the season actually bears fruit much sooner, as the pacing is also lightning quick.  The season is thus able to produce over a dozen stories within stories, and each character (such as Kathy Bates's colorful Delphine LaLaurie) is given just enough room to breathe in a world of her own within its larger framework.  Furthermore, none of the characters are safe, nor are any of them innocent or clear protagonists.  (Most are, in fact, gruesomely sadistic.)  After taking pains to give life to each character, the creators do not hesitate to dole out swift and often merciless ends to most of them.  This being the supernatural, though, not every ending sticks.

In addition, AHS brilliantly undermines its audience's expectations.  I believed that I had spotted a few storytelling cliches taking along the way but, at each juncture, the plot veered off into a realm that I could never have guessed.  For example, early on the audience becomes invested in Fiona, Jessica Lange's newest portrayal, and believes her to be this season's wry savior.  Yet, while Lange's character is indeed as arrogant and sophisticated as ever, here she is anything but a savior, and nothing closely resembling a leader.  Another example is the early drawing of lines between two powerful characters, both witches.  The season seems to be pigeonholing these characters into an unavoidable showdown of epic proportions...but the writers opt for a more unusual direction instead.

While the particulars of friend and foe are constantly shifting, more constant are the dueling concepts that dominate the season's themes:  death vs. life, power vs. weakness, youth vs. old age, black vs. white, truth vs. falsehood, male vs. female, beauty vs. ugliness, and sight vs. blindness.",1422144000,,2989,5.2092050209205025

6024265,3,B00FQY4C86,"The one thing to keep in mind when writing a review for a show like this is that you assume the person reading it is potentially interested in watching a series of this ""genre"" and has probably seen the first two seasons.  With that in mind, this series was fairly engaging at the beginning.  Who doesn't like Cathy Bates?  Sadly, by episode 7, it started to become very, very repetitive and plain stupid.  Realizing, of course, that this series is actually pretty stupid now.  Regardless, you hope that there's going to be some fantastic spectacle, plot twist, whatever, that comes for investing so much time into it.  Sorry, not really.  This series has become predictable and weak.",1420588800,,684,4.794871794871795

6024272,5,B00FQY4C86,An amazing series and one of my favorite seasons. There are twists and turns at every corner and the plot never goes the way you expect it to. This is one of my favorite T.V. shows and I love re-watching it.,1420502400,,207,4.073170731707317
6024273,3,B00FQY4C86,"I really liked it but have to give it a three after watching the two first seasons only because it was really corny at times with zombies at Halloween and Stevie Nicks playing a witch. Stevie Nicks was referred to as ""The White Witch"" back in the day because of her wardrobe  and stage act, she is butterflies and puppies, that does not mix with the horror story theme in my opinion. Great acting and story otherwise and Jessica Lange is on target. I do not think the show could pack the punch it has without her. My opinion. By the way Stevie Nicks is a goddess in her own right, far away from horror.",1420416000,,602,4.234782608695652

6024283,5,B00FQY4C86,I really enjoyed the American Horror Story - Coven III.  It really kept you guessing on who would be head of the Coven and was surprised who was killed off.  The special effects were wonderful and I loved all of the characters chosen and they were great actresses/actors.  I liked that they had chosen well known actors for the Coven III.  Excellent director(s) of each episode.  Some of the scenes were spiced up too.  All in all very mysterious.,1420416000,,447,4.594936708860759

The story is about the aging ""Supreme"" witch who must make way for an up-coming, younger witch to take her place.

6024332,5,B00FQY4C86,"Jessica Lange and the rest of the recurring cast is excellent.  W/ the addition of Danny Huston, Angela Bassett and especially Kathy Bates, they really outdid themselves this time.  Bates is perfect as Madama LaLaurie, the notorious slave torturer/murderer of the 1700-1800s. Anything she's in is worth watching!

This season is extremely gruesome, graphic, and gorey!!  Be prepared!  Great subplots of all the characters all entwined. Ending of season a bit rushed but it must be rather hard to tie up all the loose ends in 13 episodes.  [I was satisfied except for the fate of Misty  (you'll see what I mean when you watch it).]

I would love to see Bates (and Huston) again in future seasons.  This has been, to me, the best season so far.  The first season was ok except I hated the lead actress.  The second season was good but disjointed (still worth viewing twice).  But w/ this one, I believe they really nailed it.",1420243200,,923,4.7

6024335,4,B00FQY4C86,AHS has a tendency to pull me in and cause binge watching sessions- Coven did not disappoint. I love how every season is different but the same actors recur- Jessica Lange is amazing yet again- be prepared to watch more than one episode at a time as it's hard to pull yourself away. I gave it four stars because I thought the wrap up of the season could have been stretched into a couple more episodes- but maybe that's because as usual I didn't want it to be over!,1420243200,,465,4.235955056179775

But sadly -good for me-, as I was watching episode 2 or 3 I don't remember- I just remember feeling my psyche being assaulted and violated by the imagery and violence and I shut it down. I could no longer enjoy the show. I thought: this world is already in the throws of destruction and hate with murder around every turn, I did not want to do this to myself.

This season is different than the last because compared to season 2 it is less hecketic to keep up with and still has a good storyline. It is similar to season 1 in that aspect. The end is kinda not what I expected but so good. I would give it 4 and a half but amazon won't let me do half stars.,1420070400,,368,3.730769230769231

Coven has become my favorite. Previous AHS had a lot to live up to so when I saw that they were going to cover witchcraft, at first I was leery.  None of the Charmed, Bewitched make it up as we go garbage.  The population doesn't allow for error or winging it.  We are the era of digital media as well as information and we will make sure to look up every last bit of information we can.  Not to mention there is a huge population of ""white witches"" Wicca, pagans, the list is long and well traveled.

Well done.  I am looking forward to season 4..FREAKSHOW",1419984000,,724,4.172661870503597

6024426,5,B00FQY4C86,"I really enjoyed the first series, A.H.S. Haunted House very much. This third season,  COVEN was more of the exceptional quality that I've come to expect from the creators of these mind blowing productions. The inspired storylines have kept me on my toes from one episode to the next. I must truly say that jaw dropping reveals as this series progresses is not an exaggeration. This is one of those rare series that keep me guessing all the way to the very satisfying end. I would love to see these characters again in some future story. One can only hope the producers hear my humble request. This is an extremely well written show.
A highly talented group of actors inhabit this intriguing universe lead by the great Jessica Lange. Kathy Bates is another great actress and personal favorite of mine who brings relish to her role. Angela Bassett is another great actress who kicks butt in her role as well. We are truly living in the second golden age of television and this series is one of the great examples of that. This is a must see for all horror fans and for all lovers of great television.
This comes highly recommended from me. I rarely give five stars to anything.",1419984000,,1176,4.57345971563981

6024466,3,B00FQY4C86,I love the AHS series but this was not my favorite simply because of the subject matter. Witches in the modern age are just not as interesting and the whole things seemed rather silly at times. I am getting ready to start the next installment which I am certain will return to amazing acting and storyline which the series is so well know for. I found the Coven series only average.,1419897600,,382,4.394366197183099

6024586,5,B00FQY4C86,"I really enjoy this series, kind of a combination of Stephen King wrapped together with the Saw movies. half way through season 3 and looking forward to watching 4. still to early into this series to ratr it, but, it's a solid 4",1419552000,,228,4.325581395348837
6024587,5,B00FQY4C86,As always Jessica Lange makes it worth watching. Quite a treat to have Angela Bassett as the voodoo queen. Never would have guessed she would do such a role as she is such an elegant lady but she was pretty scary. You will enjoy all the episodes.,1419552000,,246,4.25531914893617
6024588,1,B00FQY4C86,Hideously violent. Even though there is done first class acting I wouldn't recommend this series. It is gruesome beyond belief.,1419552000,,127,5.4
6024589,5,B00FQY4C86,"This was by far the best season in this series. The acting was superb and then writing was crisp, clean and to the point. Very little filler and very diverse in it's presentation. I was happy to see a real story arch throughout the season, rather than an overall theme linked together by random events or mini stories like the previous two seasons.",1419552000,,348,4.5396825396825395

6024621,5,B00FQY4C86,"I am a huge fan of American Horror Story. Each season has its own new story line. The 3rd season is Coven. This gave me goose bumps. Jessica Lang plays the part of the Supreme Witch, leader of the Coven. Her evil is palpable. With a guest appearance by Stevie Nicks, the White Witch, the story is complete. You never know which way the story is going to turn from one minute to the next. I think this is the best season so far.",1419465600,,427,4.095238095238095

6024635,1,B00FQY4C86,"I can see why some people like these and I can enjoy a dark story, but these just don't feel enjoyable to me. Certainly mot for kids or families and many people who are religiously conservative are not going to like them either. They are well made and produced with good actors and lots of shock value affects. If you like horror and shock gross out movies you like this I think. If your into Halloween, Friday the 13th, Amityville Horror, or Hostile you like these. If you value more mystery, intrigue or a deeper story that just flash, jump out at you shock value and jerky camera effects you may not enjoy these.",1419292800,,615,4.4035087719298245

6024706,5,B00FQY4C86,I don't care for horror but I love this show. It is written and directed unlike any show I've ever seen. It's very well cast. They keep me entertained and intrigued. Am never bored from loss of interest and the show is not predictable. It keeps me on the edge! Jessica Lang who never appealed much to me in earlier films is unbelievably evil. I love her! lol,1419206400,,358,4.279411764705882
6024707,3,B00FQY4C86,"Not a bad season, but it seems to suffer from wandering around with no clear direction.  I just didn't feel a ""hook"" throughout the entire season.  For me, it was kind of a letdown compared to Season Two (Asylum).  There were some neat/clever moments, like when Zoe wields a chainsaw to good effect (with a comedic twist).  However, it seemed like the good parts were sparsely strung throughout and that the rest of the show blandly forwarded the plot along.  Some more tension (as in Season Two) would have been appreciated.",1419120000,,525,4.725274725274725

6024722,5,B00FQY4C86,AHS Coven is the 3rd installment in a superb series and it never disappoints. I honestly think this incarnation of AHS should have contained many more episodes. The end comes far too quickly and left me wanting more. Freakshow isn't on Prime so that's a non-starter.

I cannot believe that the writers wrote that role for such an amazing actor.. An incredibly wasted story line for him. Truthfully, as in all AHS stories, Jessica Lange was Beautiful, compelling and the main reason I stuck with this and continued to watch to the end. I also thought..""Enough Witch stories already.."" Thats all you see anymore.. Teen witch stories. The cast was amazing as usual but not put together right, didn't seem to fit into the right roles for them. Exception~ Jessica Lange. Absolutely one of THE most talented Actresses Ive EVER watched. Great to see Kathy Bates. This whole story line was just all over the place and just not that interesting.

From Jessica Lange whispering all of her lines to the guest appearance by Stevie Nicks it just kept getting more & more ridiculous. How could Lillie Rabe be  believable as a teenager.  She just  seemed like a developmentally handicapped 32 year old. While at first it seemed like a good idea to have the same actors appear in each season of AHS, their acting has caused the characters to all seem the same. It's like the family from horror house left to run the asylum, then turned into witches that are now running a freak show.

6024842,2,B00FQY4C86,"I'll start with, just don't watch the show, it's not worth wasting your time. But if you wanna hear why, or just feel like laughing at my reasoning, read on.

The only reason I gave this as high as a 2 star is because the show was at least good at ""tricking"" me into watching it. Season 1 and 2 were alright. Nothing special, nothing scary, some interesting characters and I suppose an attempt at showing the inner dialogue of 1. a mass killer at a school, and 2. a homicidal psychiatrist. But season 3 has actually started to piss me off. (granted I haven't watched the entire season, and I don't intend to finish it.)
First of all is the fake racial thing they are trying to do. The entire season is trying to make it seam like they are forward thinking and trying to help with racial issues, but in the theme song cinematic alone they portray black people as animalistic. The show itself isn't much better, pretending to support black people while the whole time making it so very apparent that the white beautiful girls are going to be the hero's and the black people are clearly the enemy. Until, surprise! they end up on the same team, but not before all the ""ugly"" black people are killed and only the gorgeous black superwoman remains(which to the shows credit she is the most awesome character in the entire thing)

Next we'll get into the sexism of this show. Which portrays all but 1, maybe 2 female characters as psychotic somethings that only want to get ahead, or will constantly make bad decisions. The episode that finally finished it for me was the one in which hot super babe movie star lady gets jealous of backwoods beauty lady and knocks her out, and then buries her alive(only to keep a scarf that Stevie Knicks gave to backwoods beauty lady.) I guess I'm not a woman, so I can't be absolutely sure, but in my experience spending time with my fianc and various friends, I have to say, none of them are this ridiculously jealous of everyone around them(and I'm talking about all the characters, not just the super star movie lady).

Why is it that so many TV characters never act like adults. All of them blame each other for bad things that happen, and never once take responsibility for their own actions, also refusing to actually learn any lessons when these things inevitably blow up in their faces.
These shows are the reason I can barely stand to watch ""grown up"" television anymore. Every character on TV these days is mean, cruel and hateful. These shows agonize over ways to glorify that horribleness. For a show called ""American Horror Story"" in which I would hope there would be some decent scares, it ends up being nothing but an unfunny version of ""Mean Girls"" with all the likeable characters killed fairly quickly(and sometimes brought back as more or less mindless zombies.)

So I'm done, in season 1 the show started out promising, even by the end of that season I still had some hope for it, by the end of season 2 hope was fading fast, which is why it took me so long to pick it up again, but I could only make it about halfway through season 3, and I almost stopped earlier but convinced myself to keep going.

Thanks for listening to the end.",1418860800,,3185,4.493955094991365

6024903,4,B00FQY4C86,"This is almost an amazing show.  I say almost because it is thirteen episodes and it only needed nine.  I get that they wanted to reach thirteen for the number significance (though nine is significant too). It just really felt that they were reaching for plot points throughout.  A good portion made me shake my head and go 'why?'

That being said, when the show is good it is really good.  Note, no one in this show is good. Everyone is evil (or at the very least self centered and stupid) and the show breaks down its own logic at times. There is a lot of racism in the show used as humor, and sometimes it hits the mark, but a lot of the time it ends up falling short.  There is no character growth or development, some of the general ideology is screwy and stupid, and the ending is far too pointless and tidy to be of any value.

But it is still a very fun show to watch.  Sometimes I wish the writers weren't so busy going ""look at me mom! I'm clever!"" and would just bring a plot point to a more reasonable conclusion, but that doesn't make it bad.  It just means that its a good thing they only do one season of each show archetype.",1418688000,,1140,4.1454545454545455

Other than that, this season fell short of being scary and had some pretty awful dialogue. On top of that, it was way too campt, even for fans of classic 80's horror with an ultra ""campy"" vibe. Ryan Murphy starts good shows (most of the time, he's had a few flops) and slowly turns them into garbage every time.

6024949,2,B00FQY4C86,"I loved the first 2 seasons but the 3rd was a total disappointment.  There were several inconsistencies throughout the season. The ending was goofy and the characters were a lot less developed than in previous seasons.  Overall, this just did not stand up to what I came to expect from American Horror Story.",1418515200,,308,4.7924528301886795

6024951,3,B00FQY4C86,It had a better start than it did its finish.  Why did Jessica Lange and Angela Bassett's characters never go head-to-head?,1418515200,,123,4.857142857142857

6024953,4,B00FQY4C86,I admit that this kept me watching. I ended up watching more than one episode at time just to see what happened.  The only complaint I have was that there was a lot of violence.  I  liked the episodes with Stevie Nick a lot.,1418515200,,224,4.045454545454546

6024967,4,B00FQY4C86,"Tastes differ, I know, but in my opinion this was the best season yet. There are the usual number of random pointless plot turns and plot holes, but it works with some of Americas oldest and most transfixing mythology and suceeded at drawing me in almost from the first minute.",1418515200,,277,4.56

6024973,4,B00FQY4C86,"I always love Jessica Lange in anything.  Coven wasn't as creepy as the first two AHS', and became background noise at one point which surprised me.

6024979,4,B00FQY4C86,"I enjoyed this a bit more than the 2nd season, Asylum. It has some excellent moments and the acting is top notch. Angela Bassett is a great addition to this year's ensemble, as would be expected. There were no poor performances. The story has its holes, so over-analysis will spoil it, but if you just let the tale unfold, it is a lot of fun. There is more dark humor in this story than in the first two, which really helped make it work for me.
And Evan Peters, heck, even in the X-Men I couldn't stop thinking of that twisted $@#$ he played in S01. He still does well this season.",1418428800,,582,4.205357142857143

The performances by Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson , Angela. Bassett, Kathy Bates and Frances Conroy (""Balenciaga!"") are top notch.

6024997,3,B00FQY4C86,This season was pretty disappointing after having watched the second season. I pretty much only finished this season because I bought it and felt like it would have been a waste of money if I didn't. It just didn't compare to season 2.,1418428800,,235,4.488372093023256

6025002,3,B00FQY4C86,"Seasons 1 & 2 were amazing. This season seemed to focus more on blood and gore than on storyline.

6025051,4,B00FQY4C86,"Just finished watching this season and it has very strong points and bad points. Mostley the bad points are just sloppy writing and things that happen that don't make sense. Alot of establishing characters but not following through with what you have established. The strong points are characters that you love to watch. No one is safe here and watching all these witches back stab each other in diffrent ways is great. I also think this could be the most goriest and over the top of all 4 seasons. You have zombies, voodoo, the walking dead, witches, hell, touture, ghosts, monsters, slashers and dismemberment. Its amazing to me that this is even on TV. Its the extreme of the extreme but so fun to watch!!",1418083200,,708,4.672

It was also great casting and acting. Some episodes of course are better than others, but as a whole it was really thought out and very realistic. I can say that this is one of the memorable ones in my list of horror things to watch again in the future when I don't remember it anymore. lol",1417910400,,459,4.287356321839081

Could be a dream for an actor. Highly recommend the series.

IMDb site is a profund disapointment as a source of movie information. It does not appear to list the full cast. Nor does the full cast appear to be listed here. Who is the actor who played the Dr. in Fiona's opening scene at the research institute.
His first name is David. Poor guy.

Intro is completely Satanic, because you know, all witches worship demons lol (sarcasm). And the whole Stevie Nicks fixation??? WTF WAS THAT?? Just terrible writing, casting, and production.

6025119,2,B00FQY4C86,"After the good Season 1, the terrific season 2, season 3 is a mess.  It's as if someone bought a cheap paperback called Haunted New Orleans and threw in 12 or so unrelated, cliched stories involving ghosts, zombies, voodoo, blood sacrifices, 17th century hangings & 19th century miscegenation, incest, slavery, etc. and let them bump into each other as if playing billiard with no pockets. The dead mostly never stay dead despite repeated acts of murder, butchery and mutilation.  For respite, they give us an occasional resurgence (resurrection).  The cast is familiar and competent with Emma Roberts doing Paris Hilton and a nicely turned ""heroic young female"" performance by Taissa Farmiga.  Bates seems lost and Lange repeating her cynical characters from 1 & 2; ditto for Lily Rabe, the sexpot, natch, who comes and goes w/o rhyme or reason.  Season 3 is an idea without a structure. There's no why to the storytelling.  It's not horrible, but it is gory; it's tough to stick with and for me not especially worth it after seasons 1 & 2.  The cover poster is so promising.",1417392000,8,1076,4.8469945355191255
6025120,5,B00FQY4C86,"The acting in this series is fantastic! The story lines have many twists and turns. It does have blood and gore, so if you don't like that, you might not be interested in this series. However, it's like The Walking Dead in that the story lines out weight the gore.

6025136,5,B00FQY4C86,"While I've not yet seen the fourth season, ""Coven"" is my favorite AHS so far!  Part of it is the fact that I fell in love with New Orleans in a recent visit, and so it's fun to see some of the culture and architecture in each episode (love how they incorporated a NOLA funeral in one scene!).  It was also refreshing to see actors who aren't skinny white people, tbh.  Which, Kathy Bates was glorious -- as always -- and I love Jessica Lange even harder as she owns these characters who I really want to hate, and can't help but adore. The cast overall was splendid, and the season's end was satisfying.  Again - favorite season so far!",1417219200,,636,4.275

Although Season 3 is not my favorite one, even the weakest AHS is still better than 95% of anything else to watch.  It is the first tv season I have ever bought on Amazon, and it was well worth it.

My one issue is with how under-utilized Evan Peters was (he was THE main reason to get hooked in Season 1).  SO much more and better could have and should have been done with his character.

Coven was unfortunately lacking,  there was no wow factor,  no ""I can only see this stuff here,  on this show,"" and good God,  don't get me started on the Stevie Nicks element. Ryan Murphy force feeding her to us the whole season was bad enough,  but the white witch and the 90's music video was too much.  Also,  it seemed forced and rushed and light compared to the other seasons.  I can only hope Freak show can bring back the magic that Coven was lacking.",1415923200,,548,4.454545454545454

6025270,1,B00FQY4C86,"Ok, I am apparently in the minority here, but I loved Season 1 and was very disappointed by Coven. True, Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett were fabulous, but Stevie Nicks showing up? Pretty corny. I could've done without the weird mini music videos, thanks. Was there really any purpose to the Boy Part episode or to the role of the resurrected male frat boy? The ""love"" story between he and Zoe was not hot, at all. Myrtle Snow and Misty Day were amazing characters. However, the story lines became sloppy.... Fiona 's daughter couldn't bring Misty back to life, yet could resurrect Zoe after a mere pep talk from Myrtle? What was the point of the bible thumping neighbors? Or the weird night of the living dead? What happened to the kidnapped baby in the cross dressing butler's care? Jessica Lange's death scene was an anticlimactic cliche. The best scenes were those where Kathy Bate's racist character's decapitated head was forced to watch the mini series 'Roots', from a supper tray, and when she mortally injured a tour guide whom she felt was misrepresenting Madame, subsequently becoming the substitute tour guide of her own torture chamber. I became weary of watching the characters die over and over, only to pop back up. Overall, I just found Coven to be gross and unsuspenseful. I was glad when it was over.",1415059200,,1318,4.759825327510917

6025298,5,B00FQY4C86,"AMERICAN HORROR STORY: COVEN takes us to new levels of horror, terror, debauchery and suspense. The writers throw in everything imaginable in Season 3. Witchcraft, voodoo, incest, murder, torture, mutilation, resurrection and maybejust maybe some redemption. Its a freakingly creepy and chilly.
COVEN is a womens story. The main characters are women of all ages from teen to senior. Finally, the women are in power and older actresses have surprisingly meaty roles. The young actresses have their parts to play but finally we see some delightfully talented older actresses show the youngsters what it is all about. Jessica Lange again plays the aging beauty in a race against time. This time she is Fiona Goode, the SUPREME witch and needless to say there is nothing good about her.
Cast members from previous seasons also return. Evan Peters has been put together and gets to show some fine acting chops and emotions without the use of words. Jamie Brewer returns as Nan. Shes not your typical witch. Kudos to the writers for using this lovely actress with Down Syndrome. Nans romantic story with a neighbor boy begins to shine and then fizzles. Here was a wonderful chance for a different love story that was not fulfilled.
COVEN is not for the weak spirited. Blood and gore flow in this season in a story that sometimes loses its way in a mesh of story lines.  Kathy Bates as the gloriously wicked Delphine LaLaurie makes the horror of slavery seen in 12 YEARS A SLAVE seem like a day in the park. LaLaurie, based on a real person, abuses and tortures her slaves in a way that would make even the strongest weak in the heart. COVEN seems to have crossed some lines with this horror. Nonetheless, Bates gives the role her all and nothing can outshine her. And then there is the lovely Angela Bassett looking more sexy than ever and somehow has worked her magic to look 20 years younger than her age in real life. Her Marie Laveau is deliciously evil in a shockingly frightening way.
Gorgeous Lily Rabe is the witch named Misty Day who has the power to resurrect the dead. She is obsessed with Stevie Nicks and before we know it the rock legend appears in an a couple of odd scenes where she plays herself. Stevie sings a couple of songs and it all seems so out of placea chance to just fill some air time it seems.
Sprinkled in all the horror are bits of comedy. Hey, come on. If you are a good witch looking in to an open grave and you know a bad witch is standing behind you, cant you or the audience guess what is coming next? The light moments provide some respite from all the decadent evil and horror in this season.
Here is a magnificent cast in some seriously meaty roles in an often gruesome story. It is not for the easily offended or upset. The storyline can get confusing as people die but are resurrected and it seems like even those who are immortal somehow end of dying. At times, nothing is clear. If you are in some sort of witch induced limbo for decades and are released are you dead or alive and how do you end up with an apartment and job? Ask the ax man.
Surprisingly, COVEN loses steam and energy in the last two episodes as the witches test each other to be the next SUPREME. It becomes slow moving and tedious as if the writers had exhausted all their creativity by the end of the season. It is a disappointing and unfulfilling season finale but it was sure some wild ride getting there.",1414540800,,3414,4.506451612903226

However Coven comes close. It has some excellent moments and great acting.

As to music? Well, again, not quite the wonderful soundtrack as Asylum with a variety of songs that brings back nostalgia but excellent Stevie Nicks songs.

What Coven will certainly do best is bolster Stevie Nick's career and sell more of her albums. Nicks will have a bank account big enough to buy.... well, a chain of covens.",1414022400,,533,4.709677419354839

6025348,4,B00FQY4C86,"Beautiful Blu-Ray, as with all AHS Blu-Rays. I've decided to never buy American Horror Story unless it is on Blu-Ray. I didn't buy my copy from Amazon, but from Wal-Mart, and received a 4-disc copy, with the last being a Q&A with the cast and some interviews. It was a delicious extra, but the extras already on the 3 normal discs were amazing as well. This is mostly a review of the Blu-Ray, since there are tons of reviews on the show itself. The picture is crisp, looks amazing on an HD TV, and I love the Season Mode all of the American Horror Story Blu-Rays have. I wish more Blu-Ray discs would incorporate this feature. It lets me keep watching in order even if I take the disc out.

As for the plot, yes, it was good. It was creepy, dramatic, and of course I enjoyed the romance between Evan Peters' character and Taissa Farmiga's character. Fiona was amazing. She and Angela Basset MADE this season. It is of course nothing compared to Asylum, but I don't think any season (except maybe Freak Show) will come close. The vudou queen vs. the Supreme was an excellent Cold War. I especially loved the reason why Fiona was unable to become immortal like Marie LaVeau.",1413849600,,1172,4.4766355140186915

Jessica Lange and Angela Basset are well matched as adversary's and their sinister games between a high Voo Doo priestess and the  powerful supreme head of the witches coven make for some deliciously fun Creole speaking banter and devious plots against each other.

Season 3 is probably the least scary season, so if you avoid shows like this because they might be scary, you don't really have to worry about this season. It's more about witchcraft. It has a lot of great commentary about race and I would say it's totally worth watching.",1413763200,,398,4.32

6025424,1,B00FQY4C86,"Garbage--the writers are clearly relying on sales without question and return viewers from the previous two seasons.  The 1st episode in season 3 includes a unmarried daugter in the 1800s being such a nymphy she endulges the help to what is under her skirt; 2) a young witch being gang raped by frat boys and 3) another young witch who kills the surviving gang rapist in his hospital bed by boffing him (yes, her V is a KILLING MACHINE--wow!  That hasn't been done yet.).  STUUUUU-PID! and it is the same overly-sexualized garbage we get in many current movies and TV series--low on plot, high on TnA--I mean--just look at the cover--that should have been my first clue that Season 3 was going to suck (no pun intended, but it is what it is).  On the plus side, Jessica Lange plays a cruel and evil witch who has many evil witchy-ways to make people do her will, but it is wrong for the writers to try to make her carry the whole show on her character alone.  It must be hard to be an A-list actress and be committed to acting a POS script.  She's still my fave--not her fault the stories for season 3 appear to be written by some horn dog who has a thing for Stevie nicks and girls that are possibly legal.",1412640000,2,1207,4.342222222222222

This is a spooky, spectacular, estrogen-fueled romp into the occult....of course we have to have STEVIE!

6025474,2,B00FQY4C86,"I started watching AHS when I saw that it received several Emmy nods. I have no idea why, other than Kathy Bates' acting. Other than that, the storyline is a complete mess. It is too bad because the first ep was intriguing so I thought it had potential, but everything is all over the place. Warning - spoilers ahead. Everyone dies and then comes back to life which becomes tiresome. The witch who is able to bring people back to life is seen as having a precious talent but then several other characters are able to do the same. The Voodou Queen and the Supreme are sworn enemies yet suddenly become best friends. Delphine begins to draw back from her racist ways then just as abruptly reverts back to them. Fiona wants to kill the next supreme, then she decides she wants to protect the coven, then she decides she wants them all dead again? The witches supposedly have extraordinary powers (like mind control) but are helpless to use this power when one (non-witch) character chokes another one to death? The witches are able to take down the cooperation of witch hunters that have been their enemy for a century, and do it in one afternoon? The writers didn't seem to know what they wanted. The finale was terrible, and I cannot understand why this show has so much critical acclaim.

Something that I noticed is that many reviewers gave the show a positive review after only watching one or two episodes. To review a whole series based on one episode is premature so I hope most will wait until they've seen the series before reviewing it!",1411516800,3,1544,4.574007220216607

Overall, the show is watchable, and many of the episodes are very intriguing, however, the writers have, for some reason, made all the main characters very very stupid.  The decisions they make, all throughout the season, are incredibly stupid and short-sighted.

Then there's the ""bringing the dead back to life"" gimmick that gets old very quickly.

6025565,4,B00FQY4C86,"Captivating because it's well-written and acted. However, It could be better. It has the potential of also being entirely terrifying and amazing but it retreats from providing that realism by employing the same cast and what I can only as kitsch (for example, Stevie Nicks in this series and the dancing scene in Assylum). Nonetheless, entertaining.",1409529600,,349,5.25

6025567,4,B00FQY4C86,"I'd prefer to give this three and half stars, but I'm rounding up.  As always, the greatest strength of this series is the casting in choosing people who would normally not be cast due to age, race, or unusual bodies, or in the case of Jamie Hunter, due to having Down's Syndrome (she plays a very intelligent person, as she appears to be in real life, and her Down's Syndrome is never acknowledged in the show).  The acting is extremely superior.

My main issue is with the writing, though to be clear this is still far superior to most of what's out there, but I think that while it's still fairly good it was the weakest of the three AHS installments.  While not a lot, there were a solid handful of instances where characters did things that didn't make much sense just for the sake of advancing a plot, and unlike Alysum where you delightfully never had any idea what was happening next, most of the major plot points were pretty obviously foreseeable even though it seemed like they were meant to be surprising.

So, basically, totally killer casting and totally exceptional acting, but the writing was only good instead of excellent.  It's totally worth watching and the episodes fly by, but IMHO it's not as good as the previous season.",1409443200,,1244,4.606334841628959

Stories do not have to be sacrilegious or disgusting to be scary, creepy and fun.  It just goes too far.  I'm embarassed I watched it, but the good was so good I put up with the crap to see what happened.  There are some lines I am sick of seeing crossed, the writers and actors are too clever to be limited to shock that just makes you sick.  I like horror movies, but come on guys, it doesn't have to offend everyone constantly.  You can be creepy and shocking without being pornographic or revolting.",1409270400,,623,4.421052631578948

6025597,3,B00FQY4C86,"I love American Horror Story, and everything it is. Having said that, Coven is by far the weakest season yet. This is not due to the acting talent, let me assure you. Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy, Kathy Bates, Angela Bassett and Emma Roberts are all phenomenal in this iteration, and deserve to be glorified. The blame of failure goes to the writers, they are who truly let us down. The season started off strong with its premiere, ""Bitchcraft"" a wonderful composition of what could have been an amazing season. Episodes 2 and 3, ""Boy Parts"" and ""The Replacements"", are both quite stellar as well. Then came the great fall, one which we will never rise from. The narrative was so erratic, it could give a housefly a run for its money. In the end I was most sad for the incredible talent in front of the camera to be given such a bitter lemon. Thankfully Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuk saw the error in their ways and are bringing back said talent in the uber anticipated fourth round, American Horror Story: Freak Show, this autumn. Although I've been slightly spurned, I remain as optimistic and ecstatic as ever for the next round of lunacy.",1408492800,,1142,4.602941176470588

6025604,3,B00FQY4C86,"I am a big fan of the show but was dissapointed about a number of the aspects of season 3.

The Good: The actors and actresses were brilliant as always. The sets and costumes were beautifully lit by exceptional cinematography and the editing was as always first rate. Five stars for all.

The Bad: The horror was definately lacking. Even though the story was very colorful, there were a few plot holes that (to this day) still make me singe. I feel as if the story was rushed and the character development wasn't as much of a priority as the first two seasons.

It was still a great watch. I loved how Denis O'Hare resembled nothing of his character from season one and Francis Conroy's colorful personality. I do wish that Sarah Paulson and Lily Rabe had had deeper themes though. I feel their stories were a little too thin. And i feel (but completely understand) that Jessica Lange shouldn't have been the central focus. I loved how Constance (her character from S1) wasn't leading the cast persay. To me, leading the cast in season 2 as Sister Jude was enough. She was outstanding and otherworldly. But Fiona Goode is just too much at times. I get that she is a leading lady, but why conform the story to suit one person. The show should be about the themes not the actors.

All that said, it was a great season. Im still a fan and will definitely watch Season 4.",1408320000,,1367,4.456

6025638,4,B00FQY4C86,"Although this series isn't for everyone--there is a lot of gore and some nudity, bad language and very adult situations--it has been a real pleasure to watch. Each season has offered something different for the viewer, while keeping the same cast of actors. The stories are layered, full of surprises and not easily predictable. The acting is really superb. I'd never been much of a fan of Jessica Lange, until watching AMHS. Now, I see that she is an actress of wide range and plays against type very well!  Some of the players in these storylines are surprising and all are obviously having a great deal of fun with their roles: Dennis O'Hare, Francis Conroy, Angela Basset, Gabourey Sidibe, Lily Rabe, and Kathy Bates made this series a real pleasure to watch, and it was awesome to see the young woman with Down Syndrome, Jamie Brewer, playing a role that was extremely challenging and watch her rise to the challenge without missing a step. Just watching her alone will expand your consciousness. Evan Peters and Dennis O'Hare don't even speak for most of the series, and still end up acting their hearts out!

I loved that the writers made no attempt to be ""correct"" or ""accurate"" about witchcraft, instead opting to weave the fantasy into the story in their own way, without conveying any specific information. Too many shows featuring witches or witchcraft attempt to be politically and socially correct, and raise too many arguments about what is and is not witchcraft, especially witchcraft in the modern era. Instead, the writers used it as a basis for a cracking-good story and followed their own path, relieving the viewer from drawing any conclusions about the practice.

The season sends up a few of our iconic horror and fantasy memes in a darkly humorous way: you'll see echos of Charmed, Bewitched, Harry Potter, Night of the Living Dead, The Walking Dead, and even True Blood in this season--all treated with a very large grain of salt and a bit of love too--yet the story line never strays from its original intent, and never descends into a comic-book sort of delivery. There is more than one dollop of social consciousness, the most noticeable one in the form of Kathy Bates character, a sadistic racist for whom moral redemption is just never achieved. It's rare to see that in any show, and it's handled well in this one. Prejudice and racism are just one of the conflicts presented, but in no way does it detract from the overall enjoyment of the story. In fact, nothing presented in this season detracts from the story, which moves along rapidly, making each episode a tapestry, rather than a tangled mess of unwoven threads. There are cliches here, but they're used AS cliches, not resorted to as an attempt to further plot points, and they're not parodied either. That takes some skill as a writer of any television series, and this one does it subtly and competently.

This season also gives you a little treat. The music is used in the story extremely well, and will offer some insights for fans of Stevie Nicks. Watch carefully for scenes from your favorite movies and horror stories; sometimes they fly by so fast you will miss them.  As I said in the beginning, this series may not be for everyone, but if you view it with an open mind, it will entertain you in each and every episode. It's quite a funhouse ride--one you won't soon forget!",1406851200,,3373,4.739352640545145

Season 3 ended a little short.... there seems to be something missing to the plot like there weren't enough budget or something, or some sort of conflicts there between paying the actors/actresses, or actors/actresses not getting enough spotlight, etc. Just something is very much missing for the ending.

The only problem was that this completely off base to any real voodoo and witchcraft. They used media tropes for both and even went beyond it to plain ridiculous at times. It seemed to have more if an X-Men theme of their powers than any kind of voodoo/witchcraft I heard of. But that's also what made it interesting too. The artistic license for these cultures was highly exaggerated and off but it was also engaging and the cast was brilliant.

6025703,1,B00FQY4C86,"Sorry, I know it's disappointing, but this season lacks the basic and necessary quality of American Horror Story: Horror. It's fundamentally un-scary. Others have remarked on how the laws of the universe in this season are not clearly established. Characters die and get resurrected willy-nilly. This is all true and valid. For me, though, the problem was that this was a season of only lightly developed cliches. Zombies on the front yard? Get a chain saw. Of course. Not to mention the uninspired racial dichotomy: White witches come from privilege and live in a manor house and black witches practice voodoo and run a hair salon. I mean...really?

Anyway, 'nuff said - if you want to buy this I suggest doing it by the episode - you may not be inclined to finish it once it's underway and I'd hesitate to spend that money up front if you don't absolutely have to.",1403568000,8,866,4.697368421052632

6025705,5,B00FQY4C86,"So... I normally do not buy things online as far as shows go; there are just too many ways of getting said shows without having to buy them online... However, sometimes you come across a show, like American Horror Story, that doesn't come available on their parent companies websites until much later [after airing]. Some of them, like Fox, are great at putting their stuff online. Sometimes within just a week (actually, it's 8-days if you do not have a sign-in for Cox, Brighthouse, DISH or the like).

If you like witches and you like GREAT Acting... then this is the show for you. I got my husband (of 12 years) to watch this show with me. That... wasn't easy. We also bought each episode of the season. If I knew he was going to get into it I would've just got cable lol... There's benefits lol... Mostly bad things tho; cable companies can be expensive.. Again, charging a premium for shows you can (at some point) get online.

If you like witches, great acting, great directing and a nice story line (not to mention Cathy Bates is in it) then this is the show for you...

YAY for the upcoming [new Season of AHS]. Also see the first two seasons; Season 1 was amazing (sets the tone) and the second was just.. yea, great. And the awesome thing is... every person, from each season (for the most part), returns as a new character (for the most part), as each season is different. GREAT stuff.

6025707,5,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story was something very different when it debuted, and Season 1 succeeded in not only making an old-school horror tale work as a television series, it actually made a haunted house story that was creepy and utterly compelling. Both accomplishments were impressive. Other than the Walking Dead, when was the last time there's been a decent horror series that made it to season 2? And haunted houses... well, they've pretty much been demolished, and now reside in the pop culture scrapyard. The fact that they embraced the idea like they did, reinvigorating a tired sub-sub-genre with multi-generational narrative layering and out-of-left-field twists -- like the boy next door who turns out to be an undead school-shooter -- made the brilliance of the story even more impressive.

Asylum was arguably even better, but far darker. Watching it, I was continually amazed that the minds behind 'Glee' were responsible for the wonderfully twisted craziness that was unfolding: possessed nuns, a Nazi doctor turning physically healthy patients into quadruple amputees and cannibalistic pigmen, a drunken mother superior with murder on her conscience. Sometimes the convoluted plot seemed close to going off the rails, but they managed to get it together. Coven might be the best of the three seasons; it's definitely the most accessible. Again, the writers took a subject that had pretty much flatlined in film and TV, and set out to make a series about witches that didn't just 'not suck', didn't just take the easy route, appealing to sulky tweenaged girls, but instead reinvent the way people think about witch stories. And once again, they pulled it off.

Jessica Lange, like much of the cast, has returned each year playing a different character. As the 'Supreme' of the coven, which doubles as a posh girl's school in an old colonial mansion, she has been neglecting her duties, leaving everything in her daughters' hands as she seeks a way to fight off her encroaching death. Once again, she takes command of every scene she appears in; you'd have an easier time ignoring a hurricane... speaking of which, setting the tale in New Orleans was pretty much a necessity. No other city in America feels as old as New Orleans. It hangs on to it's history, builds over and around and under it, with a Necropolis-like profusion of old graveyards and mausoleums, much like the oldest cities in Europe. And New Orleans is also a place where Voodoo flourished.


In her desperate scramble to prolong her life, 'Supreme' Fiona Good seeks out the power possessed by her nemesis, Voodoo priestess Marie Laveaux, played by the talented (and apparently ageless in real-life) Angela Basset. Laveaux has been alive a long, long time, thanks to her god/devil Papa Guedhe. Her past goes back far enough to vividly recall a slave revolt against a murderous plantation owner played wonderfully by Kathy Bates. Not long after arriving with her three grown daughters, she discovers that torturing and killing slaves, then soaking in their blood, Elizabeth Bathory-style, is a great way to pass the time. Her sick games are ended when the young Laveaux condemns her to eternal life -- spent in a box buried deep in the earth. Until the present day, when Fiona digs her up, hoping to use this psychotic woman-out-of-time as leverage in enlisting Laveaux's aid. Meanwhile, the young witches in the coven have problems of their own; there's a self-centred teenage celebrity with powers that may rival Fiona's, a severely overweight girl who can turn herself into a living voodoo doll, and a new girl who accidentally kills every boy she sleeps with. On the story's edge, there is also an enigmatic swamp witch, a Stevie Nicks obsessed hermit with powers of resurrection. All the ingredients are added to the brew, and eventually it's set to explode. The violent twists and turns are fairly unpredictable, and while it's not as nasty as Asylum, it's got zombies getting hacked to pieces with a chainsaw, numerous dismemberments and beheadings, tongues are taken off using scissors, a girl is raped by a minotaur and of course -- burn, witch, burn.

The way the showrunners manage the density of crazy developments, without having it turn into a jokey soap-opera like True Blood (which qualifies as horror, I guess, as does Supernatural, but neither show even tries to be scary anymore) is a thing of beauty. The performances are uniformly excellent, the writing is passionate and exciting, and every aspect of the production is well-designed. Also, each season has featured variations on what is one of the creepiest, coolest intros on TV.",1403481600,96,4627,5.027379400260756

Season 3 is the best yet - I watched all 13 episodes in two days, like a good book you can't set down. The actors were all believable but my favorites were Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates - their characters are in-you-face with a nice dose of twisted humor to keep things edgey.  The couple episodes featuring Stevie Nicks were a nice touch and I thought Lilly Rabe's character, Misty Day, reacted with a perfect balance of awe and giddiness when meetnig her hero.

6025718,3,B00FQY4C86,"Although this season started strong, it quickly devolved into a teenage superhero soap opera. Halfway through the 3rd season, the characters reveal their lack of depth and attempt to cover it up with over acting.  The plot was equally disappointing and was reminiscent of a 50s DC comic: ""Hi, my name is _____. I have super powers.""  ""Nice to meet you, my name is ____ and I also have super powers. Now lets fight."" This seasons wasn't scary and drifted into campy cliches prevalent in pop ""horror"" such as Tales of the Crypt (e.g. bad guys who laugh at suffering with pitched down vocals).  Also, a chunk of the show was wasted on segments that did little to progress the story. For example, at least 3 whole Stevie Nicks songs were stuck in the middle of episodes. Unnecessary and boring.
I should note that there were some good ideas in the writing (creepy characters), but some portrayals were culturally inaccurate. Overall I do like the series, but it has gotten progressively worse over the seasons. I wish they would get back to the strong parts of the first season, such as not revealing all the secrets and implied horror (rather than explicit gore/torture porn). I really wanted to like this season, but failed to do so.",1402531200,5,1231,4.689814814814815

With the exception of Kathy Bates, who could basically eat a bagel and be fascinating, this season was just awful. The only surprise was the point at which you realized that they didn't have enough time left to pump any blood into the anemic story line and pablum characters.

Sometimes the curse of success is the pressure to continue succeeding. I think the writers need a vacation on this series. Or maybe they just need to ask their high school age kids for less input.",1401667200,12,669,4.61344537815126

The acting is off the charts, but what else do you expect when you've got three titans like Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates going toe to toe with each other.  There were some negatives with this season as a whole, not enough for me to despise this.  They were things like it seemed the writers would have a great idea and go with it, but then they wouldn't explore it enough.  They'd discard it prematurely and bring up something else and do the same thing with that.  Despite that inconsistency, I loved this for the tone in general and watching these actresses on the little screen.

The melodrama is overwhelming, and with every episode, Ryan Murphy and co. spirals the season to dizzying new lows. The show is called ""American Horror Story,"" but Coven doesn't make the slightest attempt to be scary, discarding the scares of Asylum for soapy hogwash. All the punchlines fall flat, and the season reverses on itself so many times that any sense of urgency we might have felt at the beginning has turned to dry, dissatisfied cynicism by the end. The narrative is lazy, the story tedious, the characters insipid. Poor Jessica Lange's talents are being spread to their thinnest limits by writing that has locked her in a cage.

The first couple of episodes are good because as the viewer is introduced to the various witches and their distinct personalities and interests as well as the other characters. As usual with AHS, I loved the unexpected twists and turns, so I was never bored, but really it just got sillier and sillier as time went on and each episode more inconsistent than the last. One central theme concerns who will replace Jessica Lange's characters as the new ""Supreme"" witch and it was really hard to see that in any of them and the ending is ridiculous. I heard someone speculate that season 4 would be a continuation of Coven, well I hope not, and its too bad because the coven theme was a great idea but they really butchered it. If not for Jessica Lange (who was very good in Coven though great acting can't always make up for bad scripts), I would give this ONE star.",1398988800,8,1012,4.388297872340425

My girlfriend on the other hand loved it. She thought it was great and all the women were awesome etc. etc.

None of the scares from season 1 or horror and truly disturbing nature of season 2.  (NOTE: I never find witches particularly scary or horrifying.  Blair Witch Project the one exception).

The difference may lie in the fact that the paranormal/supernatural/evil characters are also the victims we're supposed to be rooting for.  I simply don't care what happens to them.

KATHY BATES IS THE ONE EXCEPTION:  Her story line, character, and performance has all the disturbing and horrific elements that made season 2 so amazing.",1398384000,,626,5.019417475728155

6025796,2,B00FQY4C86,"I have to admit, I am a big big fan of the first two season of AHS, but this third season, just flat out sucked! The acting was alright, special effects wonderful, but the story was atrocious. I get that the since of dread and disfunction is a running theme needed in horror to help build a story and atmosphere that really gets under your skin. But the story would have been better if we were watching a full functioning, healthy coven duke it out with the voodoo folk, and watch them twixt with the Black Man of the Sabbat, and other witchy fun-dings.
I stuck with the series to the end, because I was hoping it would get better, I was told it would get better. But it didn't.
One more caveat, I love Jessica Lange, shes gorgeous, a great actress and shes a native of Minnesota like myself. Actually 45 min away from where I grew up. But please for the love of the Gods can she be put in a different role! Seriously!

The writing is brilliant, the acting is some of the best I've ever seen, the shot set-up and compositions are incredible, at this point in time I cannot stop singing it's praises. So after Asylum I had to go out and purchase Coven, I just couldn't wait. So far it's been an awesome ride. I find myself jumping out of my seat in anticipation, horror, and excitement. I feel like a kid - I get excited at the end of my work day because I know I get to go home and watch another episode. It's ridiculous I know. But this series is just everything I've ever wanted in a TV show.

Mind you, I grew up watching X-files at the age of 10. This series is designed to make you feel incredibly uncomfortable rather than just ""spook"" you. So if you don't like scary shows.... aw hell, WATCH IT ANYWAYS!",1397433600,,936,4.229050279329609

6025823,4,B00FQY4C86,"My relationship with the American Horror Story anthology series is similar to a few of my relationships with men - 1st it's fireworks, then the painful reality of flaws and annoyances, and by the end, there's the sweet nostalgia and warm memories of what brought us together in the first place.
American Horror Story started off great and I loved Murder House, moving on to the 2nd season, I could hardly get through Asylum, but #3 was a bold reminder of what drew me to the anthology in the first place.
Coven is not held together by an intriguing story line or nail biting suspense; the glue that binds this piece are the women and their delivery of even the most ridiculous, though sometimes clever, lines. Jessica Lange is flawless, as always. Kathy Bates plays a 19th century racist bigot and New Orleans legend brilliantly. And Ms. Angela Basset is the most beautiful and delicious Marie Laveau ever imaginable. I don't think Stevie Nicks has a future in cinema, but I absolutely love that she was brought into the story and effortlessly played up her White Witch moniker - Rock On, Gold Dust Woman.
As long as you're not expecting to be wowed, but to only be entertained, Coven won't disappoint and, in my opinion, should be appreciated.",1397347200,,1244,4.7110091743119265

To me they have ruined the potential for Game of Thrones by showing 10 episodes and then having to wait 10 months for the next 10 episodes.

6025847,4,B00FQY4C86,"Before anyone complains, remember, the first 2 seasons set the bar ridiculously high.  Both of them kept you near breathless and much like Walking Dead, were things you couldn't WAIT to see when they came out, many of us, myself included, even watching them through with commercials and all.  The first 2 seasons had a different kind of horror--certainly not the standard gory slasher flick (which, IMO, is the lowest form of film.  I'd rather watch one of ""the CW""s many horrid bombs than watch a slasher film or TV show which depended upon gore for its viewers), but STILL managed to keep you white knuckling the covers.  This season completely lacked in horror of any form, IMO, perhaps OTHER than a few of the gory axe murderer scenes.  Instead it was situational horror which I found lacked the shows usual success of fearing what your favorite characters fear.  It's hard to be afraid of having your favorite character die when a Frankenstein-ish boy is put back together with parts from different characters which I found more disgusting than scary, especially when the Franken-boy was returned to his mother who sexually abused him.  And then, for me, the show didn't end properly.  The character which should have, by all the rules everyone had talked about throughout the season become the most powerful, didn't.

Don't lose heart though.  You'll notice I DID give it 4 stars DESPITE all of that.  Kathy Bates' character was not only one of the most interesting, but also one of the most absolutely hysterically funny characters in the history of the series, even if some will find it in poor taste. It didn't matter to me, and shouldn't to most fans of the show.  Jessica Lange I felt was a bit mis-cast in this season because, c'mon, she's not the Jessica Lange of 40 years ago, and it's easy to see that, but the entire script save for the errors I mention above are wonderful, and it does give you that sensation of absolute triumph in the end.  The acting, as usual, was magnificent, with definite kudos going out to Bates, Taissa Farmiga, Angela Bassett, Sarah Paulson, and Emma Roberts.  In all honesty, they were simply all AMAZING while everyone else was only simply great, so it's hard to find flaws in the acting by anyone else.

If you loved seasons 1 and 2 like I did, don't miss season 3.  Note: Fans of Witchcraft and Voodoo and movies about them should add a star.  Fans of Stevie Nicks add at least half a star.",1396396800,,2438,4.645687645687645

6025857,5,B00FQY4C86,"Horror upon horror!  Coven, I think, was the first season I felt truly developed the characters to their fullest.  While some episodes might have been a tad predictable that wasn't the norm.

This was one of the few series where the writers were always one step ahead of me figuring out ""what was next"".  Every now and then I'd get it and then something would change they dynamics of the group.

Cutting to the chase, I had predicted, yet doubted myself numerous times, who would take over as the Supreme, the matriarch of the coven.

From pilot to end, this story unfolded in many unique ways.  The acting seemed to get better and better as the actors/actresses began to feel comfortable in their roles.  I would say the addition of Stevie Nicks was both unnecessary and distracting.  Just how much did SHE pay to get that part?  Sorry girl, you did nothing for the story or series.",1396137600,,883,4.56687898089172

6025861,2,B00FQY4C86,"I was absolutely captivated by seasons one and two.  I couldn't wait to watch the next episode.  With this season...it has been over for who-knows-how-long and I still haven't watched the last 3 episodes because I just don't care how it ends.  I'm actually rewatching season 2 instead.  Next I will research season 1.  They are just that superior.

First off, Sibide and Roberts are talentless and annoying, respectively.  Both are supposed to be strong and confident.  Sibide is monotone and emotionless while Roberts fails at being a dimestore whore.  Both are just terrible.

Bates is utterly wasted in this role.  During the flashbacks, we get glimpses of her psychotic genius a la ""Misery"", but the storyline and pitiful support leave us totally unfulfilled.

Lange was simply amazing in the previous two seasons.  Her range as the embattled Sister Jude was such an experience to watch.  Here? I actually had to think about what her name is on this season.  Like Bates, a talent is squandered.

Paulson is whiny.  That's it. From the get-go, she's annoying.  Again, her Lana Winters of season 2 was someone for whom I could cheer.  Here, I just want her to be put down.

The only performances I've enjoyed are Bassett and Peters.  Bassett is simply gorgeous and sinister without apology.  She looks even better now than she did when she played Tina Turner.  One could believe she is immortal.  Peters, in his minimalist performance, is vulnerable and likeable.  You can't help but feel for him.  These two are the only reasons I will eventually finish the season.

I sincerely hope AHS gets back to stories and actors worthy of the first 2 seasons.  Bring back Brochere, Cromwell, and, God willing, McDermott.  AHS has a high standard and this season fell considerably short.",1396051200,2,1780,4.879194630872483
6025862,2,B00FQY4C86,"As the title suggests, I can just go watch old reruns of 'Charmed' or 'Bewitched' instead of this. Season 3 was about as scary as those shows were. Very disappointing after two previous great AHS seasons. Heck, even Endora was scarier than any of these witches!",1396051200,,261,4.695652173913044

6025867,5,B00FQY4C86,"Season 3 was a blast. I particularly liked that Stevie Nicks was the white witch and the way that the testing of the seven wonders was brought about in line with her Fleetwood Mac single, ""Seven Wonders"". I also loved that it was used as a new musical video to open the finale. That is the particular episode for my review, since that is the one I've purchased; I watched the rest on t.v.

I also liked the way Season 3 tied its loose ends and gave the coven a new Supreme. If one had not watched some of the earlier episodes, however, the finale would have areas that don't make any sense at all.  Please, if you're going to invest in one show, invest in them all.

If you are investing just to see Stevie, then don't forget there is another episode where she arrives to see the outgoing Supreme. She plays the piano and sings ""Rhiannon"" and ""Has Anyone Ever Written Anything For You."" Also, there are episodes featuring other songs.",1395964800,,934,4.38728323699422

While they pushed the envelope beyond good taste in some episodes, it was done tongue in cheek, so the exaggeration was more humorous than ugly. In a post-modern era, the need to shock and be edgy is taken to extremes. In this show, they don't take it too seriously, which probably accounts for its popularity and ability to be campy rather than offensive.",1395878400,,467,4.63855421686747

They all start out strong and then kinda fall flat. By no means do I mean you shouldn't watch this  show, its very entertaining just don't except the Walking Dead. This season starts up all horror pistons firing and ends making me feel like I was watching the beginning to an all female X-men spin-off.",1395792000,,472,4.2444444444444445

6025880,5,B00FQY4C86,"Despite the plot jumping from one topic to the next, I still enjoyed this. The main reason is how can you not watch Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates go toe to toe on screen and not be mesmerized. They may this enjoyable and watchable. As for the plot, the writers seemed to experiment with a great idea, then throw it away in favor of another all throughout the series.

The additions of Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett were tremendous - really hoping these great ladies return in the future.  Jessica Lange was amazing once again - sad to hear she'll be leaving after Season 4 - unsure how the show will make up for her loss..  Kathy Bates really just was amazing!  Excited to hear that Season 4 will have a carnival theme - the show will do amazing things in that atmosphere!  Keep'em coming!,1395360000,,570,4.594059405940594

6025891,1,B00FQY4C86,No American horror here. The young actors have taken front stage and can't carry the show. I understand that a young mind has to struggle with a body that has unusual powers that these young witches are doing throughout this show. But the audience never sees the evolution of the mind so much so to turn the episode off mid-show.,1395273600,5,329,4.5

Most of the actors are either fun or in the case of Jessica Lange, flatout brilliant, but to what end? Lange soldiers on through the series' leaps, bounds and pratfalls as the show's tone and purpose flails about, one moment high camp, the next warm and fuzzy, then garish violence followed by sub Rob Zombie b movie voodoo bull-do. Maybe they should drop any effort to be even semiserious and go for fullblown comedy?

The real issue I have with American Horror Story as well as ALL Amazon streaming videos is that you can't stream them to an Android tablet except for a Kindle unless you graduated with a degree in computer science.  Apparently there's a feud going on between Amazon, Google and Adobe that means that there's no Flash player available for the ENTIRE SERIES OF GALAXY TABLETS. What's odd is that there's an Amazon video player app for the iPad. I'm not saying it's impossible to do but inexplicably, Amazon who is ordinarily well-known for superior customer relations has put the entire burden on the customer to resolve. It's like we've been caught in corporate crossfire. It just doesn't seem right and fair, given that Amazon has the power to fix this.

You can, in certain circumstances stream Amazon video, but it involves, installing something called a ""Dolphin Browser"", the ""Dolphin Powerpack"", an old version of Adobe's Flash player and then tinkering with some settings. Does that sound like something the Amazon we know would make us do?",1394755200,,1241,4.789719626168225

6025917,5,B00FQY4C86,I love the AHS coven. I've always had a fascination with fictional beings. For those who don't know this season is about witches in a coven who are suppose to be trained to control their powers but none of that really happens they just use their powers to show off or get what they want. They also argue about who the next supreme is. Just watch it! It truly is a cool show which is written by Ryan Murphy the same guy who writes glee. So cool how someone can make a joyful and happy show such as glee and also a dark and frightening show like AHS,1394668800,,547,4.074074074074074
6025918,5,B00FQY4C86,Probably the most creative show I have seen in years!  I never know whats going to happen next.  Can't wait for season 4!,1394668800,,121,4.217391304347826

6025923,5,B00FQY4C86,"I was pleasantly surprised by how good this series is.  Seems well written and well acted.  I stumbled upon this series flipping channels and watched an episode of season 3.  I like the dark and violent story.  I have gone back and watched the two prior seasons now and found all to be very entertaining.  I highly recommend.

-One note, is definitely for mature viewers as some very disturbing images",1394582400,,401,4.6571428571428575
6025924,2,B00FQY4C86,"I am a fan of the show.  I am not a fan of season 3.  The writers kept klling off characters and then bringing them back and dropping plot lines entirely.  I wonder if they wrote the whole season before they started filming or if they just made it up as they went along.

As alwys the acting was superb.  The concept had promise, but the story was incoherent.",1394496000,12,359,4.144927536231884

6025928,5,B00FQY4C86,Just hope the next season is just as good. I did have a problem at the end of the season with the payments. Was suppose to be the $1.70(something)/ episode of the whole season. The last 3 or 4episodes I was charged the higher price.,1394323200,,232,4.177777777777778

The first & 2nd seasons were scary extraordinaire but the Coven (Season 3) was like a cross between Buffy, Charmed, & Gossip Girls, not so good.

It is gory and has more intense sexual content (some including rape) then the other two in some ways so consider that.

Stevie Nicks may not be the best actress around, but she definitely made watching some of the shows a little more fun.  This is a very dark show, so if you can't handle knowing what the other side is up to, stay away.  It is at times gruesome, shocking, camp, and down right interesting to watch just to see how warped the American horror story's production team really is.  Be aware it does have a lot of shock scenes that if you are weak in stomach you just shouldn't watch it.  J. Falwell followers stay away or you'll  be holding prayer rallies to ban it for the next three years 24/7, and I would NOT let my impressionable 13 yr. old watch it!

I almost didn't finish watching to the last episode, so ridiculous was the cheap gore and dumb snarky dialogue. What happened to the sharp writing of the first two seasons? I also thought the camera work in this season was just irritating - too many weird angles, transitions, and fish eye effects. Were you trying to make up for the lackluster, sadly predictable plot lines? I'm sure the writers and producers thought it was really clever, but the gratuitous use of Stevie Nicks didn't add anything to improve all the mish mash.  Are you listening Brad Falchuk?",1392595200,3,703,4.907563025210084

6025982,4,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story maintains its rep for freaky and creepy!  Season 3 is called Coven.  This coven is in transition as the Supreme is aging, and a new Supreme is emerging.  Also there is conflict between another coven in the city, with racial divides, the white witches v the black witches with their voodoo.
New Orleans is the perfect setting for this series.  Its history, and embracing of other-world entities, along with the music and glorious old homes are ideal.
The cast continues to impress and entertain.  Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Frances Conroy lead a group of mostly female cast who cast spells, enchant, trans-mutate, and levitate.
Great series!",1392508800,,669,5.045454545454546

What happened?  It is like an entirely different show.  The writing is weak, the story line weak and some of the acting?  Yikes.  I will still give Jessica, Kathy and Frances gold stars for acting, but Taissa is deadpan and Gabourey ability to be anything but angry is distracting. The writing is so typical that it feels amateurish.

6026003,5,B00FQY4C86,"Caveat: You gotta be in the right mood for this one.  Like. . . when South Park is too politically correct, when Breaking Bad is too morally obvious, when Dexter is too gentle.  Season 1 was pretty good, Season 2 played on some world class human nastiness, but this one O - M - %^&% - G!  At a minimum, roles-of-a-lifetime for Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates, which considering what else they've done is saying something.

Not much more historically correct than it is politically, except that somebody seems to have done homework on the infamous Mme Lalaurie.  It may have gotten some real-life Wiccans and Vodounsis in a cursey mood at first, but then just possibly they kept watching until they cracked up laughing so hard they forgot to be mad.

Occasionally it can be sobering.  It holds a merciless mirror up to groups of women who cut each other less than zero slack and then hang onto petty grudges for multiple lifetimes  - were there mighty matriarchies in the ancient world? could this kind of pervasive hating have been their downfall?  And then Hell turns out to be a fast-food joint, or someone dies screaming the name of an expensive handbag, and the rumination's over.",1392249600,,1198,4.69377990430622

Out of all of the American Horror Stories, Season 3 Coven was the absolute best and twisted.. It has stomach twisting moments that make you cringe, and other moments that really just make you question the sanity of the writers and producers. If you are into dark humor this is absolutely for you. You will fall in love with the characters one episode and hope they de in the next.. I would not recommend children watch this, unless with a parent because at times this show has given me bad dreams, especially when watched before bed...

There was a random craziness to them ... just utterly off the hook with fantastic and truly horrific effects, concepts, and impact. Everything is changed in Coven.

I absolutely LOVE AHS! And the characters returning in every season just with different roles makes it even better, in my opinion. I'm excited to see who has what role and what's the story behind each character with every season.
Season three is definitely in my top two of all three seasons. But I have a love for each season and its mystery.

I watched the entire third season in a couple of days.

Asylum was also terrifying, and again we got great story lines and an awesome cast. So I was super excited that my favorite show was going to take place in my favorite city. But Coven fell short on so many levels. Too many teenagers...this is supposed to be a show for grown-ups, not Sabrina the Teenage Witch on steroids. Too much overacting...what a complete waste of Angela Bassett. Too much gore with no real scares...seriously, not one single scary moment.

6026167,2,B00FQY4C86,"Season 1 of AHS was very good. Season 2 was fantastic with great story lines and character development that built upon each other. What a letdown Season 3 was. The story development would meander and seemed to lack direction, and then at other times (in later episodes) it would go to the other extreme and certain plot developments appeared to be rushed. If you are new to American Horror Story do watch Season 1, and definitely watch Season 2. I hope that the producers get back on track with a more cohesive and scary Season 4.",1391731200,2,530,4.53125

6026169,2,B00FQY4C86,"Having enjoyed (as much as one can with the horror genre) the envelope pushing stories and their contemporary themes of American Horror Story's first and second seasons, as well as the very strong repertory, I looked forward to the third season that was set in a witches coven. There was much ado about the show acquiring the talents of namely Kathy Bates but also Angela Bassett, Patti LuPone, Mare Winningham, not to mention Robin Bartlett, and Leslie Jordan. This overstimulated my curiosity as to what kind of story they would tell. Unfortunately, it seems to have been done to overstimulate the celebrity quotient to make up for the fact the poorly constructed story they decided to tell about a group of teen witches (think The Craft redux). With so many subplots bouncing off the main story rather then intertwining, unlike previous season's storytelling, I was disappointed with story ends not justifying the means, as well as a lack of poetic justice for certain characters. Though I stand by the acting of those who came on board, I felt American Horror Story Season 3 was a season too high on of it's celebrity.",1391731200,,1122,4.848958333333333

The alien ""portion of the program"" - yeah, I didn't get that.  Did it add anything?  Season 3 - meh.  I love the actors, but I'm just not feeling it.  And I do love Jessica Lange, but I don't need to see her in one more boozy, manipulative role.  She's more talented than that.  Let's see it!

6026192,3,B00FQY4C86,kind of fizzled out near the end of the season.  Protagonists shifted over course of the season and story lines dropped and not paid off.  You can't take your eyes off Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates when they are on screen but the downside is their greatness highlights younger actors deficiencies.,1391731200,,297,4.803921568627451

They killed off nearly every single character and left a weakly written one to be the heroine. If this was their goal from the beginning, they should have developed that character better first.",1391731200,,319,4.614035087719298

6026195,5,B00FQY4C86,I had heard many people commenting on this series so I gave it a try.  The first haunted house was scary and the characters were heart warming.  I have recommended this to friends.  We are all hooked,1391731200,,199,4.324324324324325

The performances by Angela Basset (Marie Leveau) and Kathy Bates (Delphi ne La Laurie) are superb. The only thing keeping it from being a five for me is the recycling of character tropes from previous AHS editions. The best season yet in the series.",1391731200,,339,4.964912280701754
6026199,2,B00FQY4C86,"I enjoyed what American Horror Story had cultivated through its first two seasons -- taking horror-story clichs (haunted houses and insane asylums), and fleshing them out with very interesting plots and characters, giving these old clichs a new level of depth and entertainment. The first two seasons were extremely edgy, and not for the timid. They were proper horror stories, fully fleshed out over the course of 13 episodes. They gave us sympathetic characters, but were unafraid to throw these characters against some of the most disturbing antagonists TV has ever seen. It made for some great television. Shocking and edgy, yet still carrying a lot of heartfelt moments.

But now comes Season 3. Instead of sticking to the clich of a ""horror-story"", and simply reveling in that as the title of the show suggests, they decided somewhere along the way to leave the camp-fire, and instead explore less interesting and more tiresome clichs. American Horror Story has become American Teenager Story. It is NOT a subtle departure, either. There is a drastic difference in the tone of the show this season, and frankly, the quality suffers as a result.

Will Ms. Hollywood become the Prom Queen (er, excuse me, ""The Supreme"" witch) or will it go to the awkward but cute girl-next-door? And let's not forget the overweight black girl who must deal with her own resentment towards others, and the disabled girl with the heart of gold. Yes, quite horrific, what this show has become compared to last season.

This is not a re-imagining of witches. They might as well not be witches. Witchcraft is simply a small plot-device. The show seems to almost make fun, or make light, of the concept of witchcraft. And ""Horror"", in the traditional sense of the word, is almost non-existent.

I recommend anyone interested in watching the third season of this series to try one thing -- watch the first ten minutes of the last episode. Maybe you'll spoil something for yourself, but the plot is random and meandering enough that it won't matter. What I want you to watch is the STARK contrast it provides. First thing we get is Stevie Nicks (playing herself, for some unexplained and unimaginable reason) spinning around in a sort of soft-rock music video. It's very light and ""pleasant"", if you enjoy that sort of thing. But THEN we get the opening credits -- with strange demonic noises, and disturbing flash-imagery of beasts and paranormal activity. It's simply the most disjointing and out-of-place ten minutes of television I've ever watched. The two sequences seem to not only be from two different shows, but two different genres altogether.

Enjoy that credit sequence, though. It's as close to a Horror Story as you'll get from the entire episode.

Season 3 did have a few redeeming qualities, mainly between Kathy Bates and Angela Basset's characters -- Angela being the VooDoo Queen, and Kathy a sadistic, psychotic slave-owner. These two should have been the stars of the show, but unfortunately they're the side-plot. Also, Lance Reddick (previously in shows such as ""The Wire"" and ""Fringe"") does a great job as the VooDoo devil. Last, but not least, I'll mention Jessica Lange, who was simply enthralling in Seasons 1 and 2. In Season 3, Jessica Lange is simply squandered, sadly. A nonsense role in a nonsense story to work with, she does the best she can with it I suppose. But these acting giants are simply pushed aside, as we're instead mostly shown the young ladies of the ""Coven"", which might as well be any other girl's boarding school as far as it being a ""Horror Story"".

Very disappointed in Season 3, and I hope Season 4 leaves the high-school danceroom and goes back to the campfire where it belongs.",1391731200,5,3712,4.891891891891892
6026200,1,B00FQY4C86,"I have not watched the first two seasons, and stumbled into season 3 by accident about half way through because I happened to read it was shot in New Orleans. I loved it at first, and bought a season pass. Jessica Lang, as so many have noted, lights up the screen whenever she's on it, and indeed there are a number of fine performances. Also, of course, the sets and styling, the city of New Orleans (though we don't see nearly enough of it) and the general atmosphere are all great. If I could rate this just on the clothes and sets I'd give it a ten out of five, and call it brilliant. However, I'm rating the whole thing,and despite some of the great performances, and the wonderful style, I can only give it a one star because the series just tanks in the second half, and the season finale in particular just stinks. It's ultimately a mean, nasty, bad hearted show that takes some serious pleasure in abusing it's audience, and I can't admire that. Some say that it's ""American Horror Story"" not ""American Happy Story"" and that of course is so, but I really resent a series that takes pleasure in abusing it's viewers and this series does. It's a mean show, not just a scary show, and I don't like mean.",1391644800,7,1209,4.377777777777778

6026205,5,B00FQY4C86,"If you like Horror movies and campy horror stories like  I do....this might be the tv series for you. Each tv series you have to understand, has a slow beginning so you can get to know all of the characters. I don't mind that, but I have heard complaints about this specific problem/style by multiple others. Each new season has a new story line, but re-uses some of the actors from the previous season.

I honestly think that re-using the actors is genius! You become attached to the Actors and fall in love with the characters. They always tie it up in the end in a really beautiful way. And then they change the whole story line in the next season so you never get bored!

For the first time ever though, I wish they could have another season of Coven. (So far there has been, Murder House, Asylum, and Coven) each season has gotten better and better! I love Coven because as a little girl I was always interested in magic and they captured the passion in magic better than I have ever seen.

I have spent so many hours just raving about this show and I strongly recommend not just this season, but every season! Enjoy!",1391644800,,1122,4.3798076923076925

6026214,2,B00FQY4C86,"Just finished this season, and i have to say i am fairly disappointed. The first season despite its flaws was so edgy especially by regular TV standards, and if not always what i would consider terrifying it was 100% disturbing even to someone like me who isn't offended or shocked by most anything. The second season was to me truly scary and even more disturbing, not to mention written, directed and acted phenomenally. The story itself also felt deeper and more complete than the first. 5 stars hands down. Which obviously left expectations high for the third. Having just watched the last episode however I even felt compelled to write a review to explain my mixed but mostly negative feelings. From the start it seemed like a really interesting and pretty radically different approach from the last season, and i tried to keep an open mind, but I felt like i kept waiting for it to really shine and it never did. Its G rated compared to the last two, its almost a chick flick in alot of ways, and nothing of real substance ever actually happens. They fell way short of showcasing any sort of real witches kicking ass, and there is almost nothing that ever felt like a real climactic conflict. It consisted mostly of catty plots and sometimes silly dialogue, not to mention they say supreme so many times you would swear you were at taco bell. I really wanted to like this season and even put effort in to doing so right until the end. It wasn't terrible, but it certainly wasn't special especially following the second season, and there wasn't really anything ""horror"" about the story.",1391558400,,1591,4.665480427046264
6026215,5,B00FQY4C86,"Totally unexpected. Love the catfights. Witches do them better. I really got into the characters, especially the students and I was rooting for all of them despite the ""there can be only one [Supreme]."" I felt like this series was quite different from 1 and 2 and that doesn't mean it was bad. It was still as crazy as any American Horror Story and the ending was just as unpredictable as usual.",1391558400,,395,4.5

I am angry and feel more time needed to occur in compiling the stories.  Also, a woman's point of view as a writer wouldn't hurt.  The entire season was scattered, some of it made no sense, some of it seemed like a cop-out, and the lack of attention paid to this season compared to other seasons where there was so much control is absurd.",1391558400,5,509,4.6

6026219,4,B00FQY4C86,What I love about American Horror Story is that every season is a completely new story. The season after the next delivers a stronger intensity and the actors nail it! If you're gonna sucked into a show this would be the one to do it. I would definitely recommend watching Season 2: Asylum if you think this show is anything less than great.,1391558400,,341,4.428571428571429
6026220,5,B00FQY4C86,"I have enjoyed all the American Horror stories, they are all awesome. Ever since I was young, watching ' I Dream of Jeannie ' and ' Bewitched ' I've loved watching women with magical powers that aren't evil, they are pretty regular, they can just do things others cannot. In this season's American Horror Story it's women with powers that aren't necessarily good or bad, but could go either way depending on how they are treated by others and that is so ""human"". The acting is amazing as usual. Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett, and Kathy Bates are American Treasures, everything they do is gold, these three superstars together are ""pure magic"". They elevate everyones performance around them and show that acting is truly art. Sarah Paulson should be America's sweetheart with her beautiful, angelic face and grace, I have adored her since American Gothic. Taissa Farmiga, Emma Roberts, Gabuorey Sidebe, and Jamie Brewer are perfection, especially Emma Roberts, that young lady is one fantastic actress whom I'm looking forward to watching for years to come. Now what can be said about Evan Peters besides AMAZING!  He is so good and has gotten better with every season. He and Emma are the entertainment worlds future superstars. Love this show!",1391558400,,1245,4.985576923076923
6026221,1,B00FQY4C86,"From a team of writers who so masterfully (to me, at least) crafted stories about the true horror to be found within people, themselves - and who successfully surrounded those stories with otherwise bizarre or cliched supernatural elements - AHS: Coven seemed to deviate from a well-written and focused story and favored a confused but fogged set of ideas without direction or relation.  Like the two previous seasons, it started off well enough: getting you used to the language this particular ""world"" of the show will use, setting up characters - not anything too heavy, but enough to keep you excited for more.  But as the plot developed, a conflict would arise as well as its solution within a span of 10 minutes.  The major conflict on the entire season, arguably, only really mattered in the last 4 episodes (I really don't want to rewatch to find out and make my point).

The season did have its strong points (mostly the performances of any cast member over the age of 25), and at the very least kept me entertained; but I can only compare the entertainment quality to that of reality tv.  It hurt watching a show that I love trainwreck before even the half-way point in the season.  At a certain point around episode 5 or 6, I thought it would be easier and more enjoyable to continue watching Coven as a comedy, and for a few episodes, I was right.  Please give that statement time to sink in.

Although the show managed to contrive those unrelated (and really, unnecessary) story elements together at key places along the way, that, sadly, is exactly how they felt: contrived.  Soap opera league.  I'm actually a bit angry with myself for getting the season pass on Amazon for it.  I was so happy with the first season and with Asylum that I just assumed that Coven would be just as good, if not better.  However, I've ineffectually argued with friends who loved this season for all the same reasons I couldn't stand it.  No one is right, but they are definitely wrong.",1391558400,8,1981,4.6257142857142854
6026222,3,B00FQY4C86,"Fell in love with AHS Season 1 and 2 and this is a clear departure from that. Murphy was clearly trying to draw in a broader audience base with some of the choices in this season, however the tonal shift away from what the show does best left me feeling lukewarm towards the characters (less invested than before). Acting by some of the older thesps/Murphy favorites was top notch; however the performances by some of the younger girls were less inspired.",1391558400,,455,4.62962962962963
6026223,3,B00FQY4C86,"The season does not deliver as the fist two. The story has a very promising begginning but it loses steam as the episodes pass and ends in a very flat anticlimatic way ( it almost feels that the writers were in a rush to finish the story). As always a great performance by Jessica Lange and a very surprising one by Emma Roberts( this girl relly has a lot of potential, very talented). If you have seen the other two seasons this one is likely to disappoint you, never reaches the level of horror of the other two.",1391558400,,514,4.255102040816326

I guess less extra stuff (such as the aliens in season 2 seemed both too much and undeveloped at the same time if that made sense). Great performances by everyone and some really dark moments.

Everyone is killing everyone and then they are brought back to life and all is forgiven.  A bitter and deadly rivalry between the Coven and The Voodoos is then forgiven after the Voodoos try to wipe out the Coven.  Queenie goes to the Coven and tries to kill the Stevie Nicks chick, then she is accepted back into the Coven again.  Stevie Nicks actually sings a really cheesy song in an episode so they can all just look at her and be amazed even though a few days ago they all tried to kill one another.  Kathy Bates character is all over the place too.  What a freaking mess this season was!  Queenie is the worst actress ever.  Every time she talks its just so freaking bad! And what is with that goofy looking soul stealing devil dude? He is so freaking stupid to look at! Thank God for Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates, their acting at least makes watching this somewhat bearable.  I can go on and on about just how horrible this was, but you get my point.  I am not sure if they hired new writers for every episode or what, but this was just awful.  Save yourself the time and put on a Fleetwood Mac CD and chant some nonsense with a Voodoo Doll in hand.  That will be much more entertaining than Coven.

It takes place is the beautiful city of New Orleans, and there's even Voodoo and witch craft!!! But they barely do anything with this! The first few episodes are good, but it just got bland! Very bland! I kept paying for the episodes, thinking that there is no way that this isn't going to get better at some point. It never does.  You have the opportunity to really use Voodoo and Witchcraft and historical New Orleans to capitalize on the creepy as in previous seasons of American Horror Story and then hardly use these things to your advantage in this season? Probably enough said.  My best advice? Wait and watch it for free!",1391472000,,803,4.647887323943662

6026250,5,B00FQY4C86,"I love American horror story: Coven!  I've been a fan since season 1 and just finished the third season last week.  Each season is self-contained mini series, so the plots and characters change from season to season (which kind of bummed me out after the first season, but definitely adds a nice change of pace to each season).  Coven is about a school for young witches run by a reckless head witch the ""supreme"".  Coven uses racial, sexual, and familial tension as underlying themes to drive the story along, which in American Horror story fashion is, pretty crazy.

For fans of The Amityville Horror, Harry Potter, American Horror Story Season 1.",1391472000,,649,4.8108108108108105

6026259,5,B00FQY4C86,"This is my favorite season of American Horror Story. The writing was tight, (it has been since the beginning of the series). I really enjoy how this series uses many of the same actors while presenting a new concept each season. I find it awesome how the show blends reality, fantasy, history and social commentary then coats it with a bit of comedy. I think this is the most unique tv show out there because of those things. I first was drawn to the show because it was starring Jessica Lange. Sadly I hear she may leave the show after next season. Hopefully they will keep Evan Peters, (is it just me or does he remind anyone else of a young Johnny Depp?). On the subject of actors the show does draw a few big names besides Jessica Lange. This season had Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates. Guest appearances were made by Stevie Nicks, (who does sing), which, in my opinion, speaks volumes of the popularity of this show. If you have never seen the show, you can pick any season to start from as each season has its own story.

S02 didn't fail to impress, either. Then, this season comes out... and I'm just disappointed beyond belief. High school cattiness, with easy to predict happenings... the writing was a bit sloppy. The acting was still amazing, but the overall performance of the entire season was just.... disappointing. The story line was scatter-brained, like they couldn't pick one thing to work off of. Battles between the two witches--voo doo witches and salem's witches, then a battle between witch hunters and witches, and then the next supreme... IDK. Was it worth the money?

This season saw the addition of some of Hollywood's powerhouse women: Angela Bassett, Kathy Bates, Patti Lupone and Gabourey Sidibe. These ladies in combination with the mighty Jessica Lange, Frances Conroy, Sarah Paulsen and Lily Rabe were splendid in their roles. I especially loved Frances Conroy's portrayal of Myrtle Snow, definitely emmy worthy. However the writers put together a disjointed script and many times the story just did not make sense. It would be very hard to top season 2 no matter what was put forth, but I expected more and the finale really fell flat. I expected Fiona to put up more of a fight.

This is a lackluster and downright failure to match the previous season's quality and breadth. It almost feels like the writers worked on character stories independently for a few months, came together and realized that there was no way any of their story arcs would make sense, but figured to just go for it since it was too late to start over. Story lines went absolutely no where. Characters were ultimately frivolous and contributed nothing to our understanding of the plot or the supposed theme of discrimination. Whereas Asylum bravely tackled the issue of sanity, Coven rarely even approached it's supposed theme, and when it did it was in a superfluous and superficial way.",1391299200,12,794,5.162790697674419

6026317,3,B00FQY4C86,"Do not continue reading unless you're a fan of spoilers!

Much like all the 1,2,3 reviews out here I was expecting much from this Season's AHS. Maybe, that was why it didn't intrigue me as much, I have to say the beginning was somehow entertaining the first half of the series was interesting enough the second was watchable that's all.

The reason for that is that the second season just seemed rushed and abrupt. Everything surrounding the plot made no more sense. Why would Fiona join in with her most sworn enemy the Voodoo Queen Marie Lavue? Whom she hates so much, whom tried to destroy her a couple of times? That plot twist wasn't as bad a$$ as the producers wanted us to believe, I found it more ridiculous than anything else. Also, why would Queenie free Madam whatever her face is after all the crimes she did? And Can Queenie make up her mind into who's side she's really in? And the whole love triangle story between Madison, Zoe and the walking dead just seemed dull and contrived. Why would two powerful witches conspire against each other for the attention of a zombie who's a puppet is beyond me! Teenage love is really annoying. The random killing scenes, that just seemed mindless. It really is like the writers haven't thought their ending through and rather just threw random conclusions to each and every character or plot line even if it made little to no sense. Believe me when I tell you all of them including the finale seemed so contrived and unconvincing.

I hated the ending most of all, It seemed cartoonish and what not, I understand the producers wanted to throw at us one last shocker before the season ends but come on. That wasn't a shocker that was just laughable. You spent all that time guessing who
s the next supreme and oh I should've thought about that before! Felt like I was viewing a Jumanji Cartoon episode rather than AHS. Yes, we do have a happy ending this season a boring happy ending.

In short this season was non climatic. I guess, the only likeable season for me was Season One. Season two was a lot of mumbo jumbo with no direct line and purpose to it and this season was just dull. I recommend season One for anyone who wants to get an idea on what AHS can really be about. Otherwise do not waste your time.

Maybe I'll watch the fourth season in hopes it would be better than these last two, finger crossed! But I won't make the mistake of expecting too much.",1391299200,,2416,4.469387755102041

The acting was superb, the plot(s) well developed despite time restrictions (I can't believe they crammed so much into 13 episodes), and the filming was dead on. Highly, highly recommend.

6026324,5,B00FQY4C86,"Ryan Murphy who has a bit of a reputation for losing steam with continuing sagas (Nip/Tuck, etc.) just keeps getting better with AHS. This season's performances by an extraordinary ensemble cast created a ""never a dull moment"" sense of wonder along with AHS's standard gore. Coven has a sense of fable or fairy tale mixed in with the expected gore, creating a fascinating switch from shock and repulsion to innocence and sweetness all within a single scene. On the sweetness side is the character of Misty Day, flawlessly portrayed by Lily Rabe. She is an archetype of the wild innocent who is forced to cope with a world that encroaches on her moss-covered retreat. So too are Zoe, Nan, and Queenie, the good witches of the story.  Jessica Lange can of course, do no wrong and Fiona gives us more depth than both her characters from season one and two. Unlike the first two seasons of AHS, there were characters I really liked in coven. Francis Conroy (another actress who is incapable of a bad performance) is terrific as Myrtle, the fashion obsessed (a la Andy Warhol factory graduate) member of the council. The visual cacophony of Myrtle's wardrobe is as captivating, as her personality.  Her untimely demise provides one of the season's most captivating scenes worthy of Edward Gorey's best efforts. Really, a red dress to die for! Ryan Murphy's various visions of hell; from being eternally trapped serving in a fried chicken joint, to Fiona's tortured pronouncement of KNOTTY PINE ring true for many of us. I found myself wondering what would mine look like? Hell seems to be mindless horrific repetition for Murphy, someone who has avoided the same with each season of AHS. From Angela Bassett's slinkingly seductive voodoo queen to Kathy Bate's corseted moldy oldie, it's visual atmospheric feast. And hats off to Stevie Nicks! Her surprise opening for the seven wonders was true magic. I can't wait to see what Ryan Murphy and Brad Falchuck cook up for the 1950's in season four.",1391212800,,1990,4.867256637168142

The season began strong, the pilot of this season was endearingly good. By the next episode, things got messy fast. Too many flat characters with little to offer, Patti Lupone and Alexander Dreymon join the cast for a brief and forgetful family consisting of a bible humper and a personality-vacant son. Same is true for Bates' Delphine. From HBIC to maid, for most of the season her character was wasted.

This season is not lacking in CAMPY dialogue and characters. Fiona and Cordelia are nowhere near as interesting as Sister Jude and Lana Winters. Frances' outrageously flamboyant character Myrtle is really only rattling on about bidets, fashion, amus bouche and her random thoughts.

Lily Rabe returns with the most interesting character, Misty. Taissa and Evan join as two boring teens, Zoe and Kyle, who make a cringeworthy whiny couple. Evan's new character has no personality, or many lines. Denis O'Hare serves as the mute, oddball butler who likes tea parties with his dollies. Angela joins as a potent Marie Laveau; New Orleans' famous Voodoo Queen. Angela was a highlight, Marie was a force to be reckoned with.

So many plots come and go, with no satisfactory tie up. The Witch Hunters, a promising plotline gets sour fast. Zombies, racism, resurrection, spells and such dry up fast. It becomes incredibly frustrating when characters are constantly revived. There's no suspense or twists. The premise that sticks is ""who is the next supreme?"" Which lots of viewers grew bored with, only to get a strange slap up ending.

What could have been the best season yet became a campy, frothy mess. Murder House and Asylum prove Murphy and co. can kick ass. This season, there was too much promised (Kathy's Delphine and Jessica's Fiona were marketed as best friends turned worst enemies never happened. I specifically remember hearing Ryan saying at Paleyfest saying the two legends were going to go at it, hard.)

Not to mention this season was perhaps the most gory, least thrilling, most perverse (My son is sexy, and I know it), but no shocks, just eye rolling.

Rated TV-MA for strong gore and violence, aberrant sexual content, some language and mild drug content.",1391126400,,2968,5.004056795131846

6026342,3,B00FQY4C86,"I started out with the season loving the characters but the writers did a very poor job of developing them any further. There was little depth to the season beyond a surface build. The finale was boring, plain and simple. The plot was lost along the way in the season and the characters, who were portrayed by some excellent actors, were shells of what they could have been. I felt as if the writers lost interest in the show even though the marketing was better than their writing. I was excited to see this cast but they were not given any meaningful dialogue!

6026352,2,B00FQY4C86,"I'll preface with saying that seasons 1 and 2 were tremendously ground-breaking in every way and had me at their mercy in terms of my interest and desire for more. Season 3 was something only good enough for background noise.

This season was just such an enormous let down. It was nothing like previous seasons. It was full of political and social agendas being pushed as well which was extremely distasteful for a show that used to pride itself on disturbing its viewers. Never at one moment during this season was I slightly terrified, and rarely was I taken aback by the content of the show. Season 3 was a drama, not a horror or thriller. It became a show filled with drama for that I can imagine teen girls and immature adults would love.

I will admit that up until the  mid-season finale, I had been under the illusion that the show was somewhat respectable and worth wasting my time on, but what I didn't think could get worse, got tremendously worse after the season resumed.

 It was a teenage drama targeted at polluting the mind of kids with propaganda, agendas and immoral values (exceeding what is often seen as tolerable in media). I'm not giving 2/5 because it had obvious motives-- every piece of media we consume has a motive nowadays. I give it 2/5 stars because the ulterior motives were delivered in such shi**y ways that I couldn't even appreciate the quallity of the medium (the show) that was spewing bullsh** constantly. The season was not thought out, not logical in storyline, hastily made and lacked any long-term appeal. This season is in now way comparable to the prior 2. I was gravely disappointed by it, and am not anticipating having any eager desire to see season 4 when it starts up.

In a nutshell, the show and all those within it sold (and souled) out.",1391126400,,1792,4.601880877742946
6026353,5,B00FQY4C86,What a thought provoking series? After 3 amazing seasons of AHS I am hooked and craving the 4th season. I have experienced the best acting I have ever seen from Jessica Lange and every cast member making this series the best of it's kind.,1391126400,,238,4.431818181818182

Queenie was also reduced to a go-fer during the Divination Wonder. Again, not the Queenie we saw all season long.  Fiona's Hell was great, but I missed Delphine's arrogance for the last few episodes. She should have played a bigger role at the end. Fiona, Delphine and Marie were great throughout the series and could have made the ending much better if they were all still around.
Overall the season was great and we need more shows like Coven.",1391040000,,616,4.590909090909091
6026359,1,B00FQY4C86,"The best part of this season is the intro played at the beginning of every episode.  The intro is actually creepy.  The actual episodes are a comedy at best.

Lets be honest, seasons 1 and 2 were oozing with cheese, but there was some very creative writing that left you thinking about them after each episode was over.  The plot twists were unexpected and exciting and the character development was good.  Yes, there was plenty of gratuitous slasher violence and of course the overdone horror plot elements such as exorcisms with foul mouthed split-pea spitting demons wearing too much makeup and silent mask wearing individuals that hack and slash their way through sex crazed nymphomaniacs, but the overarching plots were truly creative and interesting and I felt invested in the characters and there were plenty of actually creepy moments.

In season 3, there is little to no horror at all.  More often than not, I felt like I was watching a comedy.  There is a MAJOR plot twist in every single episode, with some major character dying or having a complete personality makeover.  This demolishes the already practically nonexistant character development, preventing establishment of major personalities as they change so rapidly.  The terrible plot twists become laughable as the writers attempt to reach double digits in every episode, they can't even keep track of their own writing as certain directions in the plot are completely abandoned, mutilating the continuity of the show.

SPOILER ALERT

And seriously, why was that obnoxious ""actress witch"" not burned when she was discovered to have harmed another witch, considering how seriously this coven seems to take such an event given the final scenes?  At the very least, why was she permitted to take the ""seven wonders"" test?  And what was up with the whole silver bullet thing?  How did we suddenly go from having two groups of ""sworn enemy"" witches to having them banding together to fight a common enemy that was supposedly threatening their very existence, then all of the sudden defeat this enemy with a single spell that encourages them to get in a room with these witches?  How are these witches consistently threatened by a man wrapping his hands around their necks when they could simply mind control them, lift a piano over their head with their thoughts, set them on fire by looking at them, or bring themselves back to life?  Beats me, but apparently if you want to kill a witch with godlike power, just walk up to her and choke her with your hands.  I am not asking for the show to make sense all the time, but a little bit of continuity is nice, just a little.  This season has none whatsoever.",1391040000,21,2670,4.841409691629956

1) graphic rape unnecessary to plot and character development

Season 3 obviously centers around a coven of witches.  Set in New Orleans, this season has been more lighthearted than the first two seasons.  Kathy Bates plays a role that brings both comedic relief and disturbing blood lust to the season while the familiar faces of American Horror Story settle into some of their most convincing roles to date.

Without offering any spoilers I will say that the tasteful special effects, set and costume design make a modern coven of Salem descendants completely real on screen.  Particularly in the episode ""The Seven Wonders"" the special effects and make-up stand out as some of the best on television.",1391040000,,726,4.73015873015873

Since I watched the first two seasons on DVD, this was the first AHS season I watched on TV, and it was full of blood, horror, a great variety of very different characters that strangely bond together, and the addition of new actors was great. Emma, Gabourey, Angela and Kathy were spectacular with their roles, and the returning actors were awesome as usual.
But the best about AHS is that you never know what's going to happen next, and this happens a LOT in this season. They are a lot of ""OMG"" moments, and I gotta admit I yelled at my TV with some stuff that happened. The plot moves really fast from one episode to the next one, and every episode is a good one! There's always something happening with all the characters. My favorite character from this season was Misty Day; Lily Rabe really proves that she can play anything! Of course, it lacks the horror of the previous seasons, but it compensates it with awesome performances and a good storyline. I can't wait to get it on DVD and watch the whole season again. Buy this if you're an AHS fan, or if you're looking for a great show about witches(mini-series)!",1391040000,,1286,4.430379746835443

6026383,2,B00FQY4C86,People keep telling me how good this show is. It's not. It's not good TV. It's not good horror (doesn't even come close to being scary or suspenseful). It's not even good trash. An episode of Scooby-Doo makes more sense and might actually be scarier.,1391040000,,250,4.5777777777777775
6026384,4,B00FQY4C86,"I am probably going to be verbally chastised for this, but, in all honesty, this season was not as good as the last two, for me at least. I pretty much knew that a musical guest was going to show up at some point, probably during sweeps. I could really do without the music videos in this.
It did not have the Ooopmh of the last season or the surprises of the first. It would have been a great first season show, but because of the first two seasons being so good, it was slightly lackluster. Maybe it's just me.
I am just wondering though, is next season going to be about Mummies and Susan Hoffs and the Bangles going to perform ""Walk like an Egyptian""?",1391040000,,655,4.2063492063492065
6026385,3,B00FQY4C86,Not up to the standard of the first two seasons. Still a great story but more campy and less intense. Asylum blew me away. This not so much. I guess it's a pretty high bar to meet every year but that's the expectation they set and I don't think they met it.,1391040000,,257,3.9615384615384617
6026386,2,B00FQY4C86,"The series started out very strong. Season two was just OK.
Season three weak...even with a sterling cast of actors, there's just nothing that scary about Witches.

6026388,2,B00FQY4C86,"Actors are great. Story is boring. Entire show felt slapped together with duct tape by the end. It had a promising start and then just became a horrible mess of abandoned characters/story lines and awkward writing.

Not scary, tense, or thrilling... so is it a horror show?",1391040000,,273,4.808510638297872
6026389,5,B00FQY4C86,Best season yet. I did miss farmer Hoggit. Though I adore Stevie I thought she coul have plate a more integral role. She would have been a great ghost if supremes past singing shelter and protection to the girls.,1391040000,,212,4.461538461538462

6026392,5,B00FQY4C86,"I picked 5 stars because Coven was the best!  Jessica Lange's performance of Fiona was sexy, powerful, sly, funny, and very intelligent.  I think it ended the way it should have and it was well written.  Kathy Bates was also brilliant in her role of a sadistic, arrogant beast of a woman.  Angela Bassett was stellar as Marie Laveau.
I liked the way they ended Coven with the exception of Misty Dawn. Can't wait for the next version of American Horror Story!",1390953600,,458,4.548780487804878

6026412,5,B00FQY4C86,"If you enjoy classic horror stories, you will enjoy this show.  Coven has it all with talent and a story line that is unpredicatable from week to week.  It is made more on the lines of a major motion picture.  Kudos to the cast and producers of this show.  I love it. I hope the the series continues for years to come.  I can't wait to see the theme for season 4.",1390953600,,363,3.986111111111111
6026413,4,B00FQY4C86,"For some reason the concepts of witchcraft and voodoo, like gangsters and vampires, have a pull on the imagination, and this is a very well put together story line. Jessica Lange can consider herself blessed to have found this vehicle late in her career that she has performed in so masterfully (in the two previous seasons as well). Angela Basset is a beauty. The story is plausible, and there is apparently a redemption tale or two concealed in the plot. Horror is so easy to blow, to throw over the top. This series, and this season, are engrossing and well written.",1390953600,,569,4.643564356435643

6026416,5,B00FQY4C86,This show knows no boundaries and every season is unique and awesome unto itself. I look forward to every episode!,1390953600,,114,4.75
6026417,3,B00FQY4C86,Running out of material so they pull the racist card.  Kathy Bates is a nice new addition.  Not scary either.,1390953600,,109,4.4

6026419,5,B00FQY4C86,"I rank this as my second favorite show of the new season. ""The Originals"" has had a slow start but picked up momentum after a couple of episodes. The problem I have with ""Coven"" is that there are too many people looking to be the worst villain.",1390953600,,244,4.212765957446808
6026420,5,B00FQY4C86,Entertaining and fun to watch.  Something different than stupid reality and cop shows.  I recommend all 3 seasons if you like the genre.,1390953600,,136,4.869565217391305

6026425,5,B00FQY4C86,"Absolutely LOVE this series!! It is so original, dark, twisted and always keeps me wanting more as well as on the edge of my seat!",1390867200,,130,4.24
6026426,5,B00FQY4C86,"If you have any doubts of whether to watch THE COVEN, do yourself a favor, and just do it. This season of American Horror Story is so addictive, well written, and at its core great entertainment. All the characters are well written, but the standouts of the cast are of course, ANGELA BASSET, JESSICA LANGE, AND KATHY BATES -  that should not however take away from the great work of the younger cast who all held their own.

""Don't be a hater, Dealia!""",1390867200,,453,4.445783132530121
6026427,2,B00FQY4C86,Jessica Lange is as amazing as she has been in the other seasons.  The flaw with this series is that while the characters change and the plots change the characters that these amazing actors play really never do.  Coven is lackluster compared to Asylum.  It's almost like they expended their best stuff with Asylum and went the cheap and easy way by stereotyping witches for this season.  All in all I found it kind of cheesy which was disappointing.  Cathy Baits (sp?) was so great in this but I think the rest of the scripting brought her down.,1390867200,,546,4.530612244897959

Action and mistery and history",1390867200,,101,4.1
6026429,1,B00FQY4C86,Producers have seemed to dumbed down the story to appeal to younger age group. The plot gets weaker and weaker the further into the episode you get. Such a disappointment.,1390867200,16,171,4.733333333333333

6026434,4,B00FQY4C86,"I've been loyal to American Horror Story since season one, where I had to force myself past my natural state and watch past the first episode.  And I loved it.  Then season 2 came along and I fell in love all over again, this was really great stuff!  And now, as season 3  draws to an end, I have to say it still gets 3.5-4 stars from me, but I still think season 2 was better.  Perhaps I will be wrong.  If Season 4 carries us along with the Coven and the new Supreme, I may feel like there was a point to the storyline. But knowing how each season is a storyline separate from the last, I feel I may be disappointed and just not understand the point of Season 3.  All in all, great acting from Jessica Lange which comes as no surprise based on her years of movie roles and the other 2  seasons of AHS.  It is worth watching for her alone.",1390867200,,840,4.0120481927710845
6026435,5,B00FQY4C86,I love this series.  The Coven hasn't been as great as the first 2 seasons but I still can't get enough of it.  This show definitely tests the limits of your imagination and crazy factor.,1390867200,,187,4.314285714285714
6026436,3,B00FQY4C86,"Rule #1 of writing stories about magic or fantasy: HAVE GROUND RULES.

The writers took this rule and flushed it down the toilet. Therefore, this show has gone all Days Of Our Lives and any character can come back from the dead and magic can literally do anything. I imagine this is the kind of story a decent writer would create if they had a serious case of the flu and were completely delirious.

The only saving grace this show has is the actors and their ability to deliver a line. It's the reason I watch this show. I really hope the writers get their act together for the next season and put even a teeny weeny bit of structure into the plot.",1390867200,,649,4.2682926829268295

6026438,5,B00FQY4C86,I loved the first two seasons of AHS and so far the third season is just as good or better. Great characters. Great stories. Great cast. Guilty pleasure.,1390867200,,153,4.5
6026439,5,B00FQY4C86,"I really like the concept of American Horror Story, how all of the actors stay from season to season but their roles/characters all change. Originally, I thought it would be confusing to the viewer but as the seasons come and go, it becomes more apparent how well written these are. None of the stories stay the same and are quite different from each other in terms of story line and plot, but the quality acting holds throughout.

This series turned it up a notch and has delivered stellar performances by all. I am amazed at how the story has developed and am excited to see how it ends.

10/10 would watch again!",1390867200,,615,4.482142857142857
6026440,5,B00FQY4C86,"The first season grew on me with time. At the start I disliked the characters, did not like the unsettling intro, and was a bit timid of random overkill scenes I might not be able to unsee. After the story started to unravel I became slightly more attached to the characters and began actually rooting for them, and I was surprised that the ending really was pretty good! The second season I was a bit worried about with the bloody, slasher flick intro.... But from the moment it switched to the 1960's, I knew they got it right. The intro was deliciously creepy, the characters were likable and believable, and the period 1960s setting was fantastic. I loved every minute of the second season. With the third, it was hard to settle back into modern day after such an awesome period piece. I will say, they absolutely perfected the intro. Favorite AHS intro by far. The new atmosphere took some getting used to but soon I was looking forward to going to this creepy corner of New Orleans every Wednesday night, and once again amazing acting performances and story drew me back. This season sputtered at the start for me but at this point I consider it an excellent season, better than the first and almost as good as the second. Cannot wait to see the final episode, and hopefully another period season!",1390867200,,1303,4.5965665236051505

6026454,5,B00FQY4C86,"The American Horror Story series is known for having a single season story arc, with much of the story defined by the setting where it takes place as much as by the characters in the show.  The actors in the show take on different roles with each new season and which actors are the focus, or even presence, changes as well.

For this season, Angela Basset and Kathy Bates make an appearance in a story set in New Orleans and centered around a coven of witches and the school to train the younger witches.  The background mythos is that the coven is descended, for the most part, from the original Salem witches who scattered after the trials and attempted to blend into society while maintaining power in the background.  More importantly, over the years the strength and numbers of the coven have been dwindling as the power of the witches has weakened over time.

The story unfolds as the head of the coven, portrayed by Jessica Lange, comes back into New Orleans to reassert her leadership while spending years away, enjoying her power, but shirking her responsibilities.  Her daughter, portrayed by Sarah Paulson, has been running the school, and in many ways the coven, for years in her stead.  From there, the show explores the growth in power of the younger witches, the desperate clinging to power of the older witches, and a power struggle with Angela Bassett's neighboring voodoo magic.

As with all of the seasons, the story shows flashbacks in ""history"", while mostly staying in the present and includes top flight writing and acting with an often graphic depiction of both violence and sex.  This season, especially, seems to be the finest yet, as the coven background provides an even stronger basis that allows the actors to explore their characters and the writers to introduce a wider variety of conflicts, mystery and magic.  Lange seems to revel in the stronger, more assertive character in this season, and the introduction of the talents of Bates and Bassett has strengthened the acting talent even further.  Given the focus on the female characters this season, most of the stronger male actors in past seasons aren't part of the mix, unfortunately.  The reintroduction of Taissa Farmiga, who was in the first season, works very well in a role that is well suited to her.  The other supporting actors and their characters has also been well done, with the depth of the writing showing as a large number of them have prominent roles that vary from week to week.

Overall, I have really enjoyed the entire season, particularly watching the depth of the story as more and more of the mystery is filled in with each episode.  If the prior two seasons are any indication, the series will only get better towards the end as well.",1390867200,2,2746,4.775898520084566

6026476,1,B00FQY4C86,"I love ahs and coven started out promising but it's turned out to be my least favorite season. The acting is superb. The WRITING is what made this season not as good. By far the most disappointing character is Evan Peters who grunted 3/4 of the season. He's an amazingactor and deserved better.  I also don't like having advertisements written into a script and thrown in my face like was done when ""protect the coven"" premiered (benydryl, diet sprite,  tickets to epcott).

there's just a lot that is lacking this season.  I'm hoping they fire all the writers and get some fresh ideas for season 4. I've heard rumors they might try to extend coven and I'm hoping they aren't true....

UPDATE

Coven was the worst season of AHS and I'm lowering my review from a 3 to a 1 because of how disappointing and poorly written this entire season was. If you loved AHS #1&2 for all of the right reasons you will hate this season. The plots are mixed around everywhere and lead to nothing and they don't make sense, not to mention the horrendous appearance of Stevie Nicks (who I like but NOT in AHS). Oh, it's also mostly a bitchfest of witches and it seems like the school was somewhere between Hogwarts and Xavier's School for Gifted Youngsters(x-men).  It's obvious they went trolling for really young girls and audience or really desperate middle aged women who like Twilight and poorly written snarkiness between bitches, er I mean witches. Basically if you are a TRUE AHS FAN YOU WILL HATE THIS SEASON.  I said ""true"" because if you loved this season and thought it was the best one then you truly do not understand what AHS was supposed to be about. Sad too because I looked forward to this season for 8 months and this is the trash they came up with.",1390694400,11,1749,4.53015873015873

After this episode though I am doubting it will make it through another season.  My fiance and I haven't stopped talking about how horrible it was it is all over the place.  It's like they ran out of story lines so decided to keep killing everyone off.  Wtf?  I was so disappointed I actually got on to see if other people felt the same way.  To my disappointment though it had so many five star ratings.  I don't get it.  There were some 1 stars that felt exactly like I do.  With all of these good ratings though there is no need for the network to change anything.

The dialogue is often painful to watch. Jessica Lange and Angela Basset and Kathy Bates and Feona's daughter are strong enough actors to serve as some sort of glue to hold everything together, but their characters remain written as very two dimensional. I loved Frances Conroy in Six Feet Under, but here her acting is painful to watch. Lance Reddick from The Wire does a great acing job and I wanted more development of his storyline.

6026514,1,B00FQY4C86,"The writing this season is downright terrifying but not in a good way.  The plot lacks focus and is as disjointed as Madame LaLaurie's tortured servants.  The are very few morsels to grab onto, with the very obvious exception being Myrtle Snow's (Frances Conroy) costumes.

The writers missed a fabulous opportunity to capitalize on the added talent this season.  Angela Bassett is divine as Madame LeVeau and Kathy Bates is a fine Delphine LaLaurie.  The stalwart Lange is lovely as ever, perhaps even the sexiest she's ever been as the ""Supreme"".  Of course, Frances Conroy delivers as the quirky fashion obsessed Myrtle.  That being said, it's nearly impossible to care about the final outcome for any of them.  None of the characters are fully developed and they wasted Sarah Paulson and Evan Peters almost entirely.

Nothing in the script is plausible, from the carnage created by the bus flip to Fione's inability to defend herself against her boyfriend when he grabs her by the hair and throws her on the bed.  Uhm, she's the ""Supreme"", she's vain and not likely to allow anyone to pull on her already fragile hair.  However, the worst parts are the supporting characters. The butler story line is campy and unnecessary. Although I secretly delighted in the over-the-top hair flip using the doll's arm, it's sooooo bad it's good.  The wishy-washy Queenie doesn't make a bit of sense.  Worse still is how they treated Patti Lapone and Mare Winningham, was there any point to it at all to the Jocasta Complex stuff?  It does nothing to further the plot and fits better in splatter porn which is not what I expected from AHS.

Lastly, I wish they would go back and do this whole season over focusing on the powerhouse talents and New Orleans rich history of voodoo and the black arts.  Sorry to say but lose all the little girls and maybe even Mr. Peters.  Create tension by writing a story not just getting us from one lack luster sex scene to a overblown blood spurting eye gouge/head chopping moment.",1390435200,27,2007,4.754335260115607

6026532,5,B00FQY4C86,American Horror Story Season #3 was exciting! Each episode was intensely engaging. At the end of each episode I was compelled to tune into the next. Even if it meant forgoing sleep!,1390348800,,181,4.6875

6026536,5,B00FQY4C86,Most of the time we watch television marathon style.  We watched season 1 and season 2 of American Horror Story that way.

6026538,3,B00FQY4C86,"I would like to put 2.5 stars but I'll give it the benefit of the first two seasons actually being really good. They didn't make it scary or spooky like the first season. Now they went for total shock value and introduced so many different things you almost get lost in the randomness.  All over the place. Witchcraft, vodoo, incest, beastiality, s*** gets weird. Somehow it makes you watch it though...",1390348800,,403,4.676056338028169

6026540,4,B00FQY4C86,"Love the series - hate paying $1.99 per episode.  Not sure Amazon Prime did me any favors and may not renew ... cheaper to buy a smart TV that will capture internet streaming.  The series was good - but not as good as Asylum.  Just a bunch of bitchy witches - Jessica Lange's character is seedy and evil, but fitting.  The others did not really fit in - more like scene fillers.",1390348800,4,378,4.208333333333333

I don't mind the gore, the sick twisted violence beyond the limits of rational thought...but why on earth do we have Stevie Nicks suddenly hanging out?

6026550,5,B00FQY4C86,"I love the fact that they continue using mostly the same cast in each season as they all are great.  I find that the new settings:  Hauntings, Asylums and Covens makes the whole American Horror Story ""alive"" and doesn't get stagnet as some do.  Well written and well acted.",1390262400,,273,4.530612244897959

6026564,5,B00FQY4C86,"Even though some artistic license has been taken with the history, the writing and acting is awesome.

6026566,2,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story is a guilty pleasure. I admit it. But season 3 is more guilt than pleasure - guilt for having wasted so many hours on such overrated drivel. I don't know how you can take acting powerhouses like Jessica Lang, Cathy Bates, Frances Conroy and Angela Bassett and end up with this tasteless brew. Watching Evan Peters stumble through silly story lines as a mute zombie is almost as annoying as Emma Roberts playing a dumbed-down version of Buffy The Vampire Slayer. And the Stevie Nicks episode is almost too embarrassing to watch. My advice: ditch the witches and wait for Season 4.",1390176000,2,601,4.733333333333333
6026567,4,B00FQY4C86,"This season of AHS is similar to the first one. The settings are varied, and you see the characters interacting with the outside world, unlike the second season which was set inside an asylum. There is a degree of comedy, too. While some people may find it refreshing to me it seemed contrived and silly - not in a good way.

Jessica Lange's character, Fiona, shares the depth of her other characters in previous seasons. Fiona is a neglectful mother who kills to stay in power in her coven. You see her having motherly remorse and falling in love with the ghost of a serial killer but never truly changing her game.

The gist of this season, Coven, is basically a Coven of witches that traces its heritage to Salem. The Coven is shambels since Fiona came to power because she's useless as a leader. She cares only about herself. Her daughter, Cordelia, reunites the few witches to be to try to salvage the Coven. The main theme is who will be the next Supreme, replacing Fiona. In this midst there are witch wars with an immortal Marie Lavoe, wars with witch hunters, and wars within the coven. Witches are killed by each other, then resurrected, etc.

I found the theme of witches in New Orleans fascinating but the writers failed to deliver a great story line. The evolution of the story was too fast towards the end, and this made the characters lack depth. There isn't much witchcraft outside of closing doors with the mind, burning drapes, and resurrecting whoever gets killed. The beginning of the season was more interesting than the latter part as the characters had good developing stories and scenes.

I gave it four stars only because the theme was original. Other than that I would've given it 3. It started great but then it turned silly and the storyline was quickened.",1390176000,,1784,4.636075949367089
6026568,3,B00FQY4C86,A disappointment after the first two seasons.  Too much Southern gentility memes ... very much like the Designing Women meet the Zombies.  Where is Dixie Carter when you need her?,1390176000,,179,4.933333333333334
6026569,5,B00FQY4C86,"So I picked up American Horror Story midway through the first season and was hooked pretty instantly, it was edgy and creepy and did way more than I ever though a TV show could do in terms of horror.  The amount of what you thought they showed you was wonderful.  I loved season 2 as well, but I thought it was thematically confused.  There were so many themes and plots that really didn't go anywhere with Nazis, aliens, demons, possession, angels, etc.  But Asylum was much more consistent in terms of setting and cast.  It was more situation driven rather than having a ghost-of-the-week like Murder House.  Coven has taken the best of both worlds:  Most of its cast was in place within a very short time and the characters that are introduced in their own episodes later on remain in the series and their introductions are really well handled.  Also the season is way more focused on the one thing rather than bouncing everywhere.  While there are some really awkward moments where characters are speaking as if they're in some other character's dream sequence, the show on a whole is really great and they're really pushing the envelope past the previous seasons with what they're showing on TV.",1390176000,,1200,4.70334928229665
6026570,4,B00FQY4C86,"This season isn't as dark as season
2, but the acting and the story go together well. A lot of season 3 is a lot of girly drama between witches but I still enjoy it. I hope to see a season 4 next year.",1390176000,,201,3.590909090909091

6026575,1,B00FQY4C86,"This show started strong, then fell apart Ouroboros style. Simply, it ate itself, devolving into spatterporn and ""witty"" one liners. All the more dissapointing because it is wonderfully cast, Minear is a genius, and the story was filled with potential.

6026601,5,B00FQY4C86,"Witches, voodoo, and fun! Although this season is not scary the dark witch theme and acting is superb. Jessica Lange and Angela Bassett have such screen presence and it's a treat when they are in the same scene together.  A few plot lines are weak but I overlook that based on the pure enjoyment each episdoe gives.",1389916800,,315,4.526315789473684

Or perhaps it's more like Jacobean revenge drama.  Regardless, something raw and primeval roared and rumbled through this episode. I can't imagine how they'll top it. Riveting, audaciously wicked stuff, and beautifully written. (Frances Conroy's little cigar speech to Jessica Lange was terrific.) See you next week.",1389830400,,475,5.661971830985915

6026606,5,B00FQY4C86,An equal blend of humor and the macabre. Jessical Lange and Angela Bassett are in top form and compliment each other as powerful rivals. Season 3 captures the magic and tight story line of Season 1 that Season 2 was lacking.,1389830400,,224,4.487804878048781

6026617,4,B00FQY4C86,I will say this season is better than season 2. I feel that season 2 is hard to follow & you have to pay extremely close attention or you get lost. Its been very enjoyable to watch & can't wait til the next season,1389830400,,213,3.8636363636363638

6026639,4,B00FQY4C86,"It has a great story line and does a great job with character development and plot twists. The content is messed up and I love it! Im in awe of the on site location filming and great New Orleans culture mixed into the story. Jessica Lange kicks ass as usual but adding in Kathy Bates is a real treat. Gave it 4 stars because I really enjoyed last season a bit more. It's hard to top Nazis, ghosts, serial killers, demons and an asylum but they are doing a great job this season.",1389744000,,478,4.150537634408602

6026651,5,B00FQY4C86,"I adore this series! Thought provoking, sometimes viscerally disturbing, sometimes heartbreaking, always entertaining! With every season being unique to it's own 'reality', each season can be treated like a separate 'mini-series'. This season's addition of the sublime talents of Gabourey Sidibe, Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates is brilliant. HIGHLY recommended!!!",1389657600,,363,6.28

6026659,4,B00FQY4C86,"Don't get me wrong, Coven is fantastic, but it's not a horror show this year.  It's because people will expect a bit of terror but won't get it that I give this season fours stars instead of five.  It seems like all the horror was reserved for the first two episodes (Gah, Marie LaLaurie and her dungeon!), but after that it became a supernatural soap opera.  It's still a very good supernatural opera--enough to make me look forward to watching it every Tuesday when it shows up on Prime.  But if you're only expecting a horrorific season like one and two, you'll be disappointed.  If you're more open-minded to genres, you'll be pleasantly surprised.",1389657600,3,652,4.684210526315789
6026660,5,B00FQY4C86,This concept of different worlds with the same actors every season has been a fantastic idea. The storytelling and visualization is top-notch scary stuff but well written. Just a great show and this season of the witches is another way for you to enjoy some fine acting and possible nightmares.,1389657600,,294,4.9
6026661,5,B00FQY4C86,Each season is totally different and each episode of Season 3 is better than the previous episode.  I highly recommend this Season as well as Seasons 1 and 2.,1389657600,,158,4.448275862068965
6026662,5,B00FQY4C86,I think this might be my favorite season so far of this series.  They've added even more incredible actors to the cast to really take this to the next level.  Enjoy!,1389657600,,165,4.290322580645161
6026663,3,B00FQY4C86,Have not been too impressed these last few episodes. Season 1 & 2 were by far more intriguing. I had high expectations for Season 3 but so far it misses the mark. Some of the writing is too transparent. I don't like it when I can correctly guess what is going to happen before it does. The last two or three episodes of Season 3 were simply not up to par with what we all know AHS to be capable of.,1389657600,18,398,3.925925925925926

I am one who embraces the dark tone of AHS. Jessica Lange is a force of nature in all three seasons of AHS. Here in Season Three, Jessica plays the Supreme witch named Fiona.. Being a supreme means you are the leader of all the witches. In season three, the other characters do NOT want to cross Jessica because she will do whatever it takes to maintain her position as Supreme.

I'm not a practitioner of any type of voodoo, but even I know the difference between Baron Samedi and Papa Legba.

The dude with the top hat and the skull on his face is Baron Samedi, who is a loa of death. Like I said, this isn't my religion so I don't want to go into huge detail on stuff I know little about. Papa Legba is the Loa of doorways, who allows people to communicate with the spirit world. He's often depicted as an old guy with a walking stick and a pipe. I'm not really sure why this bothered me so much, again, this isn't my spiritual belief, but it's kind of messed up.",1389398400,2,685,4.111940298507463

The story line, which started with some hard, powerful images, went soft.

Teenage girls in witch angst...lol. I feel like I am watching Charmed meets Harry Potter's school for wayward, annoying witches, meets Frankenstein, meets slavery, oh and by the way listen to some Stevie Nicks? What?

Okay...Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates....are amazing and powerful...in fact the entire show needed to revolve around their story line! now that I would watch.

6026762,4,B00FQY4C86,"The best part is Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett together in a creepy, campy-at-times witch story based in historical New Orleans!  Loved the New Orleans ambience.  This series is creepy rather than scary, with many truly priceless over-the-top moments.  You will love and hate these awful women.  If this genre appeals to you, this is very entertaining and totally watchable.  Now for the problems:

Empowered women being nasty and nice women being dumb and powerless is nothing new.  I could have done without the Mean Girls/The Craft hybrid part of the series (I guess to pull in younger, more mainstream audiences), especially the inclusion of a done-to-death spoiled, self-centered young actress. I could have also done without the revolting but thankfully minor storyline of mother/son sexual abuse. All the mothers in this series do outrageous harm to their children.  And there is the start of a Romeo and Juliet type of romance which ultimately falls flat and doesn't go anywhere--disappointing, it would have been a nice touch. Actually, all of the younger characters have rather inadequate storylines except to play off  the adult characters who, thankfully, are all much more interesting characters played by good actors.  Speaking of inadequate, this series is out of its depth to meaningfully take on the issues of racism and sexism (the racial lynching in an earlier episode seemed thrown in to provide backstory). Are you comfortable watching slaves being cut apart bit by bit knowing that this is based on something that really happened? These issues are part of the story but make no mistake, the overarching theme is who will become the next Supreme witch.

Daring or in extremely poor taste, it's up to you.  Enjoy.",1389312000,,1749,5.098245614035088

6026774,4,B00FQY4C86,"The problem I have with American Horror Story (AHS) is their tendency to throw every conceivable plot device into the season.  Season 2 was unwatchably ridiculous due to that -- aliens, Nazis, mutants, psycho killers, ad nauseum, threaded into and out of the storyline with no explanation or purpose.  This year is a mish-mash, too, but it is a bit more cohesive.  We still have random ghosts, zombies, child molesters and psycho killers, but at least there is a bit of logic as to how they got there and what it has to do with our main story.  The addition of Kathy Bates and Angela Bassett was a nice touch, both seem to be having a great time chewing up the scenery.  I still would prefer to see all of the backstories fleshed out and added as another season, but I understand the premise that the viewing audience has a very short attention span and demands a lot of action.  However, I would like the producers of AHS to watch a little Game of Thrones (GoT), a television show in which our ""red weddings"" are nicely balanced with some narrative and plot development.  As in AHS, GoT has a ton of backstories, side-stories, and plot devices, but they respect the viewer enough to provide plenty of narrative and character development.  Bottom line:  AHS has ADHD, but this season is an improvement, and it is rarely dull while it's bouncing off the walls.",1389312000,,1359,4.582644628099174

The writers are all over the place with this plot and the fine actors are given crappy scripts with dialogue that could have been written by high school students, seriously!!  And the characters that are not in the least bit likeable.  I used to be glued to the television for the first two seasons, now I cannot get myself to watch.

It is also good to see some of the same beloved cast each season, as well as some amazing new faces. Season three, so far, has been scary, disgusting (but not overly), exciting, captivating and oh so much fun. I love New Orleans, we went on a haunted tour once when we visited and learned all about the Lalaurie family/house. It was the creepiest story I have heard yet. I make it a point to do the haunted/ghost tours in every place we go. So, to see this story come alive, especially with Kathy Bates, has been so exciting.

I was also hesitant to start this show because I never finished the last season... but this is probably the only show that doesn't have anything to do with it's past seasons. So if anyone is holding back because they haven't seen other AHS seasons, don't even worry about it. Each season is like a completely different show, but with some similar actresses and actors. I also really do love that they keep their actresses and actors. They are SO good at their roles that you won't even associate them with their past characters. They effortlessly take of their new roles flawlessly.",1389052800,,956,4.526011560693641

6026935,5,B00FQY4C86,The whole season was good. Even season1 and 2 were even better. The third season could of been better. It was kinda lame.,1388620800,,121,4.304347826086956
6026936,4,B00FQY4C86,"Perhaps my only beef is mild disparity between my perception in trailer and the actual show.  Now that this minor critique is out of the way, (I should note that 5 stars are reserved for shows that have me replaying 3x and talking for months and take up about 1% of my ratings)
Continuing on to the love I have about this opener of the 3rd season of AHS.  It continued the actors but in completely new roles showing off their skills in ways that I feel trumps many other attempts like this (Dark Shadows comes to mind).  I love the sets, the character development was good although contrived once in a while (first dinner at the academy scene) but necessary I think for this episode to make good sense.  The filming techniques were original and worked with the story.  Despite the storyline concept getting overplayed a bit (Covenant, Lords of Salem, Beautiful Creatures), I thought it was an original take (critically important while I was watching it) on it with a lot of good acting lines delivered with exceptional emotional / dramatic payload.  You get the feel you are there or a fly on the wall basically.

So what's intriguing about this?  The seemingly mixed extremes of naive, wise, good and evil in each character make for enough conflict while occasionally showing off redeeming qualities.  The dark opening sequence has a grinding antique nature with awesome visuals, dark hoods and exaggerated dimensions boost with it an eerie factor that continues ethereally through the story.  The innocent new girl is taken on a roller coaster ride short a trial by fire (and you get that too) during her shocking initiation into her new academy for ""witches"" like her that continues the bloodline - inherited supernatural ability trope.  While that may seem a little passe, it was subtle and portrayed in a way that you didn't feel each character was completely invulnerable. (the date rape scene in particular was a great counterbalance to this).

Can't wait to see the next few episodes and sad I waited so long.",1388620800,,2017,4.780979827089337
6026937,5,B00FQY4C86,"I watched the first 2 seasons on Netflix and I don't know which one I like the most .. but I can say they are all superb. The storyline is very much character driven ... so it's relatable, plausible, believable and I was completely engrossed. Jessica Lange is amazing. I'm so impressed with her in all of the seasons. Wow.
Very well written .. and keeping me on the edge of my seat. you will LOVE it if you like a great story and aren't squeamish.",1388620800,,447,4.209302325581396

6026951,5,B00FQY4C86,"I have watched lot of shows and this one is now my current favorite. Watching all of Season 1 in two nights will give you nightmares, but well worth it. Season 2 is darker and creepier than the first, and Season 3 is turning out to be just as remarkable. The writers and actors come together in this series to make it very addictive. The best part about AHS is each season has a completely different storyline so no need to watch them in order. If you don't know the actress, Jessica Lange, then after watching any of these seasons she could easily become your favorite actress. Enjoy!",1388361600,,585,4.425925925925926

6027000,5,B00FQY4C86,"This whole series has been a fantastic, wild ride. It doesn't rely on ridiculous amounts of gore for 'effect'. The cast is just awesome. Jessica Lange needs to be paid whatever she wants to stick with this show (I heard she may only do one more season).",1388016000,,253,4.404255319148936
6027001,5,B00FQY4C86,I've watched every episode of every season so far. Absolutely love this show. Not a horrible price either if you happen to miss an episode.,1388016000,,139,4.6
6027002,1,B00FQY4C86,"They sure are taking their time releasing Episode 10. You'd think their marketing committee would be ontop of that, considering you'd have more of a chance to impulse buy if they were available in order/in a series. However, I watched Episode 9 about 4 days ago, and by the time Episode 10 comes out.

American Horror What?

I love the series. But due to the lack of responsibility by the marketing commitee to properly release their episode in a timely matter, I'm rating this content a 1.",1388016000,4,490,4.620689655172414

6027004,5,B00FQY4C86,"We have been glued to every season since the beginning!  How greatly refreshing to have a completely new story each season!  No more boring story lines, and used up plots!  The characters that the cast creates, are fun to see develop over the course of the season, and having them change along the way is most entertaining.  I can't wait for the release of the next episode!",1388016000,,374,4.537313432835821
6027005,5,B00FQY4C86,"Not my favorite of the three seasons, but twisted and just as shocking as ever.
Love love love this series",1388016000,,106,4.35
6027006,5,B00FQY4C86,Amazing plot. Great writing. Talented cast. Each episode provides a back story while also doing a great job of progressing the main story along. Excellent character development.,1388016000,,177,5.592592592592593
6027007,5,B00FQY4C86,SOOO good.  I am sooo glad to see Angela Bassett again.  I just can't get enough of this show. Since my mom and I live in different states it is fun for us to watch it sometimes at the same time (we record it) so we can both comment on it. Ugh!  Can't wait until January 8th!,1388016000,,275,3.789473684210526
6027008,5,B00FQY4C86,Love the setting of New Orleans.  Love the cast in this season.  Love the occult theme and development.  This season outdoes itself and never ceases to amazing with each new episode.  I surely hope this will spin off into its own series.,1387929600,,237,4.571428571428571

6027012,5,B00FQY4C86,"This show is one of the best written and acted series on TV. Each episode builds upon the next. There is some pretty  graphic violence so if you do not like blood you may want to avoid this. However, the violence is not pointless. It is another layer of the script. Coven's writing and suspense are unrivaled. The show stars Jessica Lange, Angela Bassett and Kathy Bates. The superior writing of the show honors their talent. Jessica Lange is the star. She proves that beauty and intrigue does not end when an actress passes the age of 40. Ironically, that is something that her character struggles with throughout the series. Angela Bassett clearly has discovered the fountain of youth in real life. She is great in the series and looks like she did 20 years ago. Kathy Bates' character is so funny. She plays the role effortlessly. It was a great season and the finale was worth the wait.",1387929600,,890,4.59748427672956
6027013,5,B00FQY4C86,"This show is just....mind blowing! I can never seem to guess what's going to happen next and its so frustrating, but its the good kind of frustration! I love the plot twists and the same characters from the other seasons. I could watch every episode on repeat!",1387929600,,260,4.553191489361702
6027014,5,B00FQY4C86,After hearing some good things about this series I tried out the first 2 episodes and was hooked. I picked up the season pass and introduced my GF to the show. The above quote is her reaction. The writing and subject matter feel far closer to a HBO style show than what we think of for broadcast TV.,1387843200,,299,4.172413793103448
6027015,5,B00FQY4C86,"It is by far the best,twisted,imaginative, series that exists. Was hooked after watching the the first season and know the third season is my favorite. Jessica Lange's best roll yet in this series. Love each and every character. Angela Basset is a perfect powerful addition as Marie Louveau..wow.. ..",1387843200,,300,5.142857142857143
6027016,3,B00FQY4C86,"It's very stylish and well acted.  I'm not on the edge of my seat like I was with season 1 and 2, however it's still worth watching.",1387843200,,132,3.888888888888889
6027017,5,B00FQY4C86,It is well written and artfully directed. The story line keeps you on the she of your seat. The dark sense of poetry and humor merge well in every episode.,1387843200,,155,4.2

6027020,3,B00FQY4C86,"This season seams to be losing some steam.  I thought the first season was the best by far.  Second season started losing me with the Alien angle.  This season has its moments, but seems to be having a hard time getting traction.",1387756800,,229,4.404761904761905
6027021,5,B00FQY4C86,The writers for Horror Story have done it again. Sure hope there is a season 4 in the works-- with Jessica Lange AND Kathy Bates--and the others too.,1387756800,,149,4.357142857142857
6027022,5,B00FQY4C86,FX continues to produce adult entertainment that leaves one in awe.  It comes close to reading a favorite novel and not wanting to put it down until the end because you can't wait to know what happens next.  Season 3 of AHS is no exception!  It continues to unravel plots and twists that leaves a viewer wanting the next seven days to fly by so we can see what happens next.  The strong acting cast draws you in and holds your attention each minute.  Quite the treat for anyone that likes plots and twists and understands that human nature has a dark side.,1387756800,,556,4.359223300970874
6027023,3,B00FQY4C86,"I'm pretty disappointed in season three of American Horror Story. Admittedly, when I saw the title for this season, I figured it would be kind of a mess, but it's been very cheesy and is going down hill fast. You know who I really can't stand? That younger girl; the one we were *happily* rid of during season two (which was actually a pretty great season, minus the whole aliens thing). Maybe if she were left out of it, this season would have had a chance. But, even then, there was nowhere really ""scary"" or interesting for them to go with a show about witches. Here's hoping next season is better.",1387756800,,601,4.423423423423423
6027024,4,B00FQY4C86,"Keep in mind, the season has not finished yet so this is only about the first 2/3 of the show. It could go off the rails in the 3rd act like some shows (*COUGH*AHSSEASON2)This show never fails to surprise me.  Jessica Lange is an amazing actress and I think Murphy et al were geniuses in scooping her up, as they have.  The ensemble is perfect together. It's funny, it's twisted and it's ENTERTAINING. This is the third season so if you're squeamish or fussy, you should already know this isn't the show for you.
Favorite moments? ""Roots"" and ""Melon Baller"", hands down.",1387756800,,570,4.578431372549019

6027031,5,B00FQY4C86,Definitely keeps your interest.  Interesting to see actors from one season carrying over to the next in different roles.  This is our third season and each one has been unique.,1387670400,,176,4.833333333333333
6027032,4,B00FQY4C86,"It took me a while to warm up to this season, but after the first 5 episodes, I was hooked. I think I was expecting perfection because of the amazing first two seasons. All I can say is not to get turned off by the first few episodes.

6027037,3,B00FQY4C86,"Interesting concept, but it seems rather silly.  Doesn't really hold one's interest very long.  Very fake about what real witches
do in their lives.  And it isn't scary.",1387670400,2,169,4.964285714285714

6027041,4,B00FQY4C86,"Season 3 of American Horror Story began a little slow for me. I actually thought I might lose interest after the first few episodes, which is the only reason I tasted it a 4.

6027042,5,B00FQY4C86,"Its the most, keep you on the edge of your seat, show out right now. ... I think the addition of, The Unsinkable Molly Brown, Kathy Baites was a brilliant addition to the series! *****",1387670400,,184,4.285714285714286
6027043,5,B00FQY4C86,"The first season of AHS was very interesting.  It was nice to see a new concept instead of a rehashing of the same old - same old.  The second season was not my cup of tea.  I gave it up after the second episode.  I pretty much forgot about the show after that.  It came up in conversation about three episodes into the third season and I decided to check it out.  It's been very enjoyable.  I live in the New Orleans area so the sets and Marie Lauveaux (sp?) story line are familiar.  Keep up the good work, FX.  I don't know how you're going to top this season next year.",1387670400,,573,4.044642857142857

6027045,5,B00FQY4C86,"Always had a flair for the bizarre and I think Coven captures the true meaning of bizarre. New Orleans history of voodoo and witchcraft, the history told in season 3 so far has been interesting.",1387670400,,194,4.571428571428571

6027077,5,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story is easily one of the best shows on television. It does not shy away from controversial topics and is not for the easily offended. It is also not for those with a weak stomach as it can sometimes venture into gore, although it mostly stays in the realm of grotesque and creepy--like a freak show. The plot lines exist in a world of gray in which no one is ever completely good or completely bad. An extremely talented ensemble manages to take quirky, over-the-top characters and make them compelling and believable. The fact that the characters always have plenty of secrets, skeletons in their closets, and dualistic natures give the show a cerebral quality that makes one question what one would really do in a horrific situation.",1387238400,,753,4.8

6027116,5,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story: Coven caught my interest after a coworker at my job recommended this television series to me.  Normally, I am not one to watch horror themed television, but I gave it a chance due to my coworkers persuasive take on why the show is captivating.  The show centers around the time periods of the 1800s and modern day as supernatural rivalries surface between witches such as the characters of Fiona Good, Myrtle Snow, Marie Laveau, and Misty Day. Despite her own hardened nature,Fiona has a daughter named Cordelia who she loves very much. Fiona and Cordelia end up becoming mentors to the young witches in training: Queenie,Zoe Benson, Madison Montgomery, and Nan. Fiona is doing her best to convince her daughter Cordelia to prepare her young prot&eacute;g&eacute;s for the magical battles that are about to take place.  Initially, Cordelia sees her mom more as a nuisance and just wants her to go away.  For justified reasons, Fiona is also naturally suspicious of the motives involving her daughters husband.  The prot&eacute;g&eacute;s are far from shrieking violets themselves. I must refrain from explaining why for those who have yet to see the show, but the reasons for my analysis of the prot&eacute;g&eacute;s are seen within the first four episodes. In modern day, witch Marie Laveau and Fiona Good end up having one of the most heated rivalries for certain reasons. This is what I am about to lead into.  The other actors and actresses of this season contribute to the plot growth of American Horror Story: Coven in unexpected ways. However, I have to confess that my favorite characters from season 3 of American Horror Story: Coven are a tie between Jessica Langes Fiona Good character and Angela Bassetts Marie Laveau character.  I enjoyed Angela Bassetts terrific portrayal as Marie Laveau because she powerfully held her own magic against forces of racism and being threatened with an old enemy. Angela Bassetts Laveau character also has a magical gift of summoning what she requests to carry out her aims. Despite the sinister character nature, I also like Jessical Langes Fiona Good character due to the fact that she plays a woman who is not afraid to confront the evils of racism during the series and plays both a strong and resilient spirit. For instance, Lange convincingly plays a Fiona Good persona who is not afraid to tell Delphine LaLaurie that she got what was coming to her for her evil ways during the 1830s as a blood thirsty socialite. Langes Fiona Good character also showed a brilliant complexity when making it clear that she will not tolerate racism and appropriately making La Laurie serve Queenie (after LaLaurie made some disparaging racial remarks to Queenie). I also saw the humanity in her when she got two of her prot&eacute;g&eacute;s out of brief brushes with the law and came to the aid of a mother in a hospital. Last, but not least, showing the will to keep on going in life even as those around her try to indirectly drive her to suicide.",1386979200,,3010,4.890196078431373
6027117,5,B00FQY4C86,Love this show.  I also think it's great that you can store your movies in the cloud.  A lot better movies than Netflix but on the other hand all the movies i watch on Netflix are free,1386979200,,184,3.945945945945946

6027136,1,B00FQY4C86,"Season 2 and Season 1 were both gripping horror series.  Season 3 seems more like a collection of boring little stories tied together loosely.  The acting is great.  But the one thing the writers fail to do is make me care about any of the characters.  There is plenty of dull, boring evil, but not a single, well-developed redeeming character.  The Taissa Farmiga character would probably be the best bet here, but so little is written about her that you almost fail to notice her. After watching each installment lately I feel like I have just wasted 50 minutes..It's clever but so, so boring.  I get the feeling they are setting up for season 4.  But they have so lost me on this one, I won't be back for season 4.  I only watch now because I paid for the full season 3.",1386806400,3,773,4.356643356643357

6027140,5,B00FQY4C86,"OMG this is officially my favorite and I think best of all 3 seasons, when I saw ( Angela Bassett ) was in it that drew me like bees to honey love her. She plays ( Marie Laveau ) a character based on the real life New Orleans voodoo queen of the the same name with a few minor alterations, Angela turns out a stellar performance. ( Cathy Bates ) another great actress does to playing a cruel sadistic rich overweight ugly woman who is obsessed with maintaining her youth one of the ingredients is eek human blood she gets from the poor slaves she tortures. They did an amazing job using the stuff they used to make her look ugly almost didn't recognize her, you will hate her character and want her dead I do muwhahaha

It starts with various young girls with powers who have just become members of an elite private school for witches who've come there to train. At a party after the new girls friend is drugged by one of the local colleges hot guys he and some of his uddies gang rape her some filming it with cell phones, eew, when the new girl finds out she begins plotting. The only good one of the group comes to the room sees it and fights them off they drag him out of the house and into the school bus while some beat him they take off intent on silencing him for good. The victim comes around and uses her power to flip the bus. The new girl goes to the hospital finds the rape ringleaders room goes in closes the door and gives him a gruesome treat, you'll say holy ? I did.

An infertile woman comes to Marie Laveau ( Angela Bassett ) asking Marie to use her magic to help her conceive. They set up and hold a voodoo ceremony with a fire drums magic offerings authentic tribal dancing, part of the ritual involves passing around a special jar with something in it. Marie puts a red pepper on her tongue eats it dances and goes into a trance and that's when the ritual really takes off. From what I saw in a few previews it is mindblowingly amazing. I saw a few announciments that (Angela Bassett, and Cathy Bates ) have been asked to do season 4 to, yay happy dance time lol",1386720000,2,2085,4.197007481296758

Jessica Lang is such an amazing actress and this season is much better than the last.  Love how they use the same actors to portray such different stories.  I'm so hooked on this show and I love that they have now incorporated Kathy Bates and the beautiful Angelia Bassett.  My new favorite is Miss Emma Roberts with her beauty and cocky attitude.  Eric Roberts is her father and Julia Roberts is her Aunt so I would expect no less than the perfection that she brings to the show.  The darker the storyline the better.

6027151,5,B00FQY4C86,"This third ""season's"" - each successive season is a different story line - narrative is simple so far, which may be a disappointment just nine episodes in, a contrast to the immediate labrynthine complexity of ""Asylum,"" and surprisingly well-acted: Angela Bassett is sublime in some sequences, where Kathy Bates's character is tedious in the first episodes, but Bates plays her convincingly; Gabourey Sidibe and Emma Roberts join the usual cast recycled from the past installments giving monotonous, clich&eacute; performances (Andrea Jackson does ""witch""; Roberts's character could have marched her high heels right from the pages of the 'Mean Girls' screenplay). Cinematographically, ""Coven"" leaves something to be desired; where ""Asylum"" played like cinema, its successor feels very ""network,"" that is, it looks like a nine o'clock cable tv show (contrast ""House of Cards,"" which looks like a movie in every episode). I see not enough of the characters I like, and too much of the ones I don't like. Some scenes feel well-written, where others I think could have been cut and left to the DVD. Overall, I keep coming back every single week, so two thumbs!",1386547200,2,1157,5.225806451612903

6027164,5,B00FQY4C86,This series is possibly even better than the first season.  The writing is tighter and the history of witchcraft and voodoo combined with a modern women's liberation metaphor make this compelling television.,1386288000,,207,5.46875

I'm a horror fan and I rarely get freaked out, but the first 2 seasons actually creeped me out a bit and made me a little uncomfortable. The third season now, while the story and acting are fantastic, it just doesn't seem as dark or as creepy as the ones before. It doesn't have the same kind of tension.

Don't get me wrong, it's still a great show, I am only slightly disappointed in the lack of any real horror in this season.",1386201600,,601,4.271929824561403

6027170,2,B00FQY4C86,"This season is disappointing, I find the writing and plot lines choppy and the characters not well developed or thought out. Unlike the previous two seasons which really worked in a camp Gothic sort of way I feel that this one loses focus and also they need to give the women in these rolls more to work with.

They have some of the finest female actors employed but the story line is often trite and simplistic in a way that doesn't evoke the potential for female or goddess power -good or evil incarnation. Overall it feels rushed and not well thought out, they probably needed a longer break to work these character motivations out and give them a little more to develop with.

Shame because it is great that so many women fill key screen time yet they haven't given them enough to work with YET in this series at least.",1386201600,4,823,4.443708609271523

From the storyline to the acting it is first class.  I gave up cable and the only show that hurt to let go was AHS.  I was thrilled when I learned the I could view episodes after their airing on Amazon for such a low price compared to paying a 200.00 cable bill for a little bit of good with mostly mind-numbing trash.",1386201600,,479,4.348314606741573

Coven is very entertaining but lacks that edge of your seat...can't wait for the next one quality.  It is definitely worth watching though.  I think what holds my interest most of all is discovering witch (pardon the pun) roll the familiar stars for the past seasons will play. This season introduces Kathy Bates. She is always a winner no matter what roll she plays.  I was very excited when it became available in streaming video. I'm very happy I purchased it.",1386201600,,554,4.690721649484536

Best that I've seen that is, especially since I don't watch much TV, and I know there are other shows out there that are supposedly awesome too that I just haven't had the chance to see. :) Anyways....I think my favorite thing about this show, is that you don't have to watch each season in order since every season is completely different! It's almost like it's a completely different show you're watching, and I LOVE THAT!

6027187,3,B00FQY4C86,"I really found the first few episodes of season 3, Coven, exciting and mysterious although I found some of the torture and gore a bit over the top after a while. The last episode I watched on Jan. 15, it became so absurd I fell asleep briefly until awakened by  more gratuitous violence.  The soap opera/psychodrama all- girl fighting (including that dead butler wearing his baby clothes , rocking the live baby which I suppose beats his hanging out with a decomposing teen-in-a-trunk ). I logged on early AM today in hopes of viewing last nights episode and viewing more plot and less putz. But, alas, it's not running on Amazon Video yet. I think character development has stagnated and the writers are filling in with non-sense violence.  I confess, I'm tired of witches dying and being resurrected, eyeballs being destroyed, burnings, knifings, shootings, slave torturing (the most disturbing)and the unending gore. I was thrilled by the first season, intrigued enough to watch every episode of Season 2, Asylum , dark and frightening but less cerebral than Season 1 . I am hoping for something more challenging and less disgusting as we move forward with Season 3.",1385769600,,1169,4.9238578680203045

I just found out Lily Rabe who played the young nun in last season and also plays the bayou witch with resurrection powers is the daughter of playwright David Rabe and actress Jill Clayburgh  She is a brilliant actress.

My 24 year old daughter and I get together every week to watch every show of every season of AHS.  The acting, without exception, is fantastic, with Jessica Lange the Queen Mother of all that is spooky.  In season 3, you get the added bonus of Kathy Bates.  Does creepy-thriller get any better than this??? The plots are intricate, but just enough to keep you on your toes.  At times, an episode is a bit too violent for me, but I have a low threshold and my daughter doesn't seem to mind the blood and guts as much as I do.  Then again, I have to ask myself why I didn't object to ""Psycho"" or ""Carrie""?",1385683200,,702,4.162962962962963

Season 3 so far is great and each episode is getting more interesting. I hate when a series has episodes that just seem like ""filler"" material to get to the good stuff. I don't think this is the case in this season as all of the episodes seem to be building up and relevant to the final conclusion. The fact that each season has a completely new theme is great becuase it should keep them interesting with new stories rather than dragging out a long story line season after season so there is always something fresh.",1385510400,6,688,4.3

That being said this season is definately more a favorite than last season. I love the scarey mixed with a slight bit of comedy (dark comedy that is). From the story line and sets to the charactors this seasons I have been happily surprised and at times scared. This season invokes people to ask fellow watchers the next day- did you see that?! what did you think about....?! It was great to see Kathy Bates and Jessica Lang starring together and they make a formidable duo. But the one playing the daunting task of Marie Lauvo (spelling?) is incredible. I expect we will this season win many awards. I am surprised by many of the characters that are back again and the new ones we have seen. It is with great appreciation I give my 5 star rating for what has so far turned out to be one of my favorite seasons. The theme of woman power is weaved into every episode. It is nothing short of amazing and scary. Can't say enough.,1385424000,,1047,4.292929292929293

Orgies with people brought back from the dead?  A butler who plays with and dresses up corpses like dolls?  A bigot who can't die?

6027227,1,B00FQY4C86,"Ok I've been thinking about writing this review since I watched  5 episodes of Season Three last night.  First I said, ""forget it"" then this morning ....because I'm still thinking about it.....I decided to write.  Audiences have always been drawn to macabre and futuristic adventure stories.  It's sort of a right of passage for a lot of folks.  Scary movies make you squeal and delight in the emotion of fright.  I am still drawn to the good scary movie...and love sci-if.  Abject Horror for Horror sake however, is not something, I delight in.  When I heard that Kathy Bates and other well known actors were starring in this series , I believed  the series to be of high quality.  Instead, I got to witness the most obscenely degenerate acts of torture, dehumanizing rape scenes, incestuous sexual encounters ( between  a mother and her zombie son, no less) blood, hatred, and demented behavior.  Ok, think  I sound like a prude?  Please!  What makes me most disappointed is the lack of cohesive plot, pace and the over abundance of gratuitous starring scenes.  Katy Bates is wonderful as is Angela Basset........too bad the script doesn't give them much plot to follow ...... Only hatred and antagonism .  And poor Jessica Lang,  all she does is look at her face and sneer.  Well, I've said enough.  It's disturbing to me that so many viewers are hooked on this show.

I am so glad that the creators; Brad Falchuk and Ryan Murphy were wise enough to tap into one greatest actors of all time, Jessica Lange.
As the lead maven/vixen of this skillfully written series, she acts as a centrifuge to the entire cast, accelerating their own unique acting skills.  Her emotional range and intensity is flawless and appears so effortless and natural that it becomes the glue that holds the rest of the storyline riveting and watchable.  I am not a horror story fan, most seem to enlist the worst possible acting and writing available, as if it must fall into a mold written long ago that must never be improved upon or altered, even though when one looks back to the age of a Lon Chaney or a Charles Laughton as Lange refers to in the last season, you can only wonder what went wrong?
Lange delivers every time and I love her role so much I hope it never ends nor her position in the coven as the `Premier'.  The rest of the cast lights up around her with award winning guest spots from Cathy Bates and Angela Bassett.  Everyone gives a grand performance.  Please don't let the series, especially this one, end.  Thank you Jessica Lange for showing up in my lifetime to appreciate what a real artist is capable of doing.

6027269,3,B00FQY4C86,"The first two seasons of AHS were among the creepiest, sickest, darkest, most intense television I've ever seen in my life. Especially Asylum. Every episode made my skin crawl. I felt like I had to take a shower afterwards.

So far, Coven doesn't measure up. It's not as intense. It's not creepy or sick. And it's far from dark. It's entertaining, yes, because I love seeing those same actors play different roles. Jessica Lange is remarkable to the point of uncanny, otherworldly.

But the episodes don't really hold my attention for some reason. A show about teenage and/or twentysomething witches has been done before. (Harry Potter, Charmed, even Buffy.) Plus, I never could suspend disbelief on characters with supernatural abilities so off-the-charts powerful that, really, what could possibly oppose them? If these characters were this powerful, why would they be sitting around in a school for witches?

The writing isn't as good as the first two seasons. And the camera work is driving me nuts. An occasional tracking shot at a weird angle, maybe. Fisheye lenses, okay. Strange places to position a camera to achieve maximum oddness, check. But a little goes a long, long way. It's like the current Hollywood trend to jerk the camera all around during action scenes -- or even scenes that have no action. After awhile, I feel like throwing up there's so much movement on the screen. (I actually walked out of the first Hunger Games movie. The constantly-in-motion camera -- even during a conversation between two people -- drove me right up the wall...and out of the theater.)

Whenever a director does too much with his camera, he becomes intrusive. Or, to put it another way, when the camera becomes another character, it's time to move on.

Coven is approaching that line for me.

The plot seems thin as a rail, too. So far, nothing much is happening. And I think Kathy Bates was totally wasted.

AHS is still quite a bit better than most TV shows today. But, for a show about witches, it sure doesn't have the magic of the first two seasons.",1384387200,22,2054,4.818181818181818

6027277,4,B00FQY4C86,"Far campier than the earlier seasons, AHS: Coven nonetheless continues to explore the representative side of horror. The conflict between witches and voodoo queens underscores the simmering racial tensions that have always lurked beneath the surface of the American social order. The emergence of powers in the younger witches, and the waning of power in the older ones, reexplores the King Lear theme of fear of growing old, growing irrelevant. The powers' emergence in general, as terrible things happen to people, is allegorical for development as a person; the price of power is living, and all the pain and suffering that goes with it. Zoe's power in particular, to kill someone with sex, highlights fear of female sexual liberation. The zombies (acting as substitutes for the spirits trapped in the haunted house in the first season) make you wonder what it really means to be haunted; to be assaulted by memories and guilt that will not dissipate. This is the best of AHS - when it uses horror not to slash, to shock, to splatter with blood, but to reveal psychological disparities and social problems of regular people. As everyone knows, the worst horror is what humans do to one another. The second season did this best, with its constant questioning of ""What does it mean to be crazy or evil? Who among us actually IS crazy or evil? How do we know? Have we locked up the right ones?"" As a viewer, you asked yourself that more earnestly with each episode.

What's truly different about this season is that somewhere, the rules changed, and death is no longer an absolute finality. People are actually brought back to life by magic; they aren't spirits trapped in a house, or missing persons abducted by mysterious aliens...which makes it harder to suspend disbelief this season than in the last two (although it is still interesting and fun). True horror is a form of fairy tale. It is meant to use the supernatural to expose some dark social truths, and help us to conceptualize them thereby. But it must have a root in the actual rules of the world, first among which is that death is the end for all of us. That's why we fear it. Take that away, and the conflict loses immediacy, and the story its narrative energy. If Zoe dies in this series, won't someone just bring her back to life to continue to fight? So why should we care? If Fiona finally dies of cancer, won't the witch with the power of resurgence just reanimate her? So why is it a problem?

With that one major complaint, I will continue to watch. AHS: Coven is interesting and well-made, well-acted, and mostly well-written. But I hope that in further seasons, they won't sacrifice their storytelling as much.",1384387200,,2686,4.737179487179487

Last season wasn't predictable. This season thus far is. This season is more about sex and cheap thrills than the story. This is one of those seasons that they really could have done a good mind screw with us and they chose not to. like is the magic all in your head or are these women really witches, and as far as Madame Lalaurie while i love the character same with marie leveou they have cheapened both characters, they should be in flash backs maybe but not in present day as immortals. Maybe they should have the school in Lalauries house, sort of thing, since accuracy as far as history isn't real important here. This show pretty much at the moment reminds me of the Craft except set in New Orleans, with a twist of voodoo/hoodoo Was hoping for something better.",1384214400,,944,4.46242774566474

6027310,3,B00FQY4C86,"I had considerable hopes for Season Three -- all the ingredients were in place for great storytelling: witches, voodoo priestesses, old supernatural rivalries, vulnerable young girls in training for lives of enchantment, and NEW ORLEANS! Plus, there was not only the triple-threat of Jessica Lange-Kathy Bates-Angela Bassett, but the welcome return of Taissa Farmiga, along with many of the superb players from Seasons One-Two.

There are a lot of nifty little storylines and clever subplots rattling around, here, but there is no cohesive quality to the writing and, as a result, these clever bits just seem to drift off into the ether, or worse: show up at the wrong moments. The narrative seems scattered, fragmented, disconnected and often arbitrary. That was the biggest strike against Season Two, and I was hoping the writing would be much tighter with 'Coven.' No such luck. Jessica Lange still rivets you to the screen and her scenes are chewy and spectacular, but Kathy Bates (whose Madame LaLaurie showed such POW! and potential in Episode One) is being woefully underutilized and her character underwritten. Angela Bassett is also being underused. These offenses alone are unforgivable when you have such mighty actresses at your table.

One gets the sense that Murphy is trying to keep way too many plates spinning in the air with this new installment, and some of the dishware is smashing to the floor. Season One had a lot of different characters, too, but they were used judiciously to serve the primary storyline. Nothing seemed wasted or pasted together with preschooler's glue. I think they needed to keep a much more constant, myopic focus on tension regarding the Fiona-Marie LaVeaux power struggle, with outside characters and storylines feeding into that chief plot and being at the service of that ongoing struggle. That would have given the narrative some solid direction, some churn. As it is, the whole thing seems aimless, thus far, with some truly awful/silly/unnecessary distractions, e.g. that Witches Council -- whah? They're not funny, they're badly written into the story, get RID of them! No such luck there, either, evidently ... Without venturing into spoiler territory.

As I said, however, AHS: Coven is still better than 90% of the scripted stuff on TV and is still great entertainment. The acting is uniformly excellent even when the writing lets everybody down and because of the great charisma of the cast alone I will continue to enjoy it and watch regularly. I just won't BUY anymore episodes, or the DVD collection, when it comes out, and *that* is a huge difference from the superbly written Season One and the fine-but-flawed Season Two. Not worth owning, thus far, Falchuk and Murphy. Prove me wrong by the end of the season, please, but you'll have to do it fast. Your story is running away from you. Also fast.",1384041600,6,2860,5.042283298097251

American Horror Story brings me back to the same feelings I had as a child, can be scary as hell and definitely creepy. Thank goodness Zachary Quinto is not in this season as I have had enough of him and his ilk. Emma Robertsand Taisa Farmega are outstanding young actresses that have a huge future in front of them. This year it seems as though it's only every other episode that is really worth watching, but the ones that are makes the whole series worthy of a fan of the horror genre's attention!",1384041600,,637,4.361344537815126

Yet, 'Day' is not a Cajun surname, her accent is more North Louisianan than Cajun, and Cajuns (being Catholic) don't worship God with snakes or loud services outdoors.

I won't have cable after episode 6,and I never pay for TV episodes, I either watch them on TV or wait for them to become available for free with Amazon Prime or on Netflix. This is going to be the first show I've ever bought because I can't stop watching!

So tired of people getting ""bent out of shape"" over shows such as this and trying to get it taken of the air. Seriously? Just because you don't appreciate this form of entertainment, doesn't mean others don't. Everyone is entitled to their opinions, but if U don't like this show, no one is forcing U to watch.

6027338,4,B00FQY4C86,"First-class script, first-class storyline, first-class ensemble cast.  But honey, this is a brutal series, in every sense of that word.  Hard to watch, but the acting is so good, I must watch.  Storyline goes back in time a lot, threading the old into the new, past into the current.  Basic plotline is, 'if you were a witch, what would life be like for you amongst mere mortals?'

The world loves witchcraft and devil, supernatural stories.  Spends oodles of money and time on them.  Some versions paint the witch/vamp/demon as a wanna-be good guy, dating back a long way, but most notably, to the charming 'Bewitched'.  Not here.  This is all about blood and vengeance, warring witch tribes and self-gratification, preservation.  Not for the light-hearted.  Not for sensitive viewers;  heck, I'm not sensitive but I find it hard to watch, too. Hence four stars, not five.  If you're not at all 'sensitive', then five.

It's part of the overall trend lately, to make gorier movies.  I can't believe 'Walking Dead' is a hit series.  Zombies?  Seriously? So if you like gore but a better story line, you'll love this series.  Lots of strung-together scenes that don't make sense, so you're kept guessing.",1383609600,,1203,4.900497512437811

""Your making me sick and I can't take it anymore"". Why can't Hollywood understand the real people of this country would like you to stay out of the business of mind washing and try to appeal to the rest of us!

6027351,5,B00FQY4C86,"Amazing writing and Score. Casting amazing as usual. I mean Kathy Bates, Jessica Lange, and Angela Bassett...Cant ask for more. Intensity of show always there never leaving you dissatisfied and always wanting more.",1383436800,,214,5.515151515151516
6027352,5,B00FQY4C86,"Jessica Lang, witches, and New Orleans Im not sure what else a great show could need? Seriously great show, worth watching",1383436800,,122,4.857142857142857
6027353,5,B00FQY4C86,"Although this story seems to be unfolding at am slower pace than usual, I have yet to be disappointed by AHS, and I can't wait to see what happens next!",1383436800,,152,4.1
6027354,5,B00FQY4C86,"The writers have really come up with something awesome here. The storyline is just complex enough to keep surprising you but not so much so that they are overdoing it.

Caution though, it's not for children or the squeamish.",1383436800,,224,4.743589743589744
6027355,2,B00FQY4C86,"I usually enjoy campy things, but this is over the top. The visual effects are not scary, but eye-rolling amusing. Throwing people across the room: silly. Dead boy flailing his arms around: silly. A waste of talent. You just can't outdo the first season.",1383436800,4,254,4.795454545454546
6027356,5,B00FQY4C86,I love this show! Each season leaves me wanting more. This series is dark but fascinating! So much of human weakness is addressed.,1383436800,,130,4.695652173913044
6027357,5,B00FQY4C86,"Brilliant acting. Stupefyingly sinister plot lines. Very dark. Can't. Stop. Watching. I have to admit, I wasn't totally sold on the hype for ""Coven"", but I retract all my cynicism. These witches are smart, sexy, evil, sad, vulnerable. Great job!",1383436800,,245,5.15
6027358,4,B00FQY4C86,Started off slow for me but then become much better. The voodoo written really made the show for me. Kathy Bates also made the show worth watching.,1383436800,,147,4.481481481481482
6027359,5,B00FQY4C86,Best season yet. Doesn't go in weird directions for the sake of being weird. I think they nailed it this time. Although the previous seasons were good this one is just plain awesome.,1383436800,,182,4.545454545454546
6027360,5,B00FQY4C86,"We all know people can be cruel to one another, but like so many other things, cruelty can be stereotyped. Ryan Murphy takes everything we think we know about abuse and suffering, flips it, and says, ""No, it can happen this way too.""",1383436800,,233,4.441860465116279

6027366,4,B00FQY4C86,I love this show and I look forward to it every week. I love that amazon had the show available so quickly. We changed our provider on Wednesday and didn't have the dvr set. Panic set in when I missed it but amazon came through for me.,1383350400,,235,4.0212765957446805
6027367,5,B00FQY4C86,I can't say enough good things about this series. Incredible plots and great acting hooked me from episode 1. Season 3 starts with a new premise and promises to be as original and captivating as 1 & 2. Love the addition of Cathy Bates in a recurring and unconventional role.,1383350400,,274,4.5

6027373,2,B00FQY4C86,The American Horror Stories are usually strange but easily to follow. However 'Coven'; My vote for it is still up in the air. I haven't been able to put my finger on why. It's too out there regarding witchcraft I suppose. Too far fetched. NOT even close to reality but then again neither were the rest of the seasons. Perhaps this one is too close to home for me.,1383350400,,363,4.27536231884058
6027374,4,B00FQY4C86,"While the show is good, the Coven seems to be lacking that ""it"" factor the last two seasons had. However, the Coven has all the potential to just as great.",1383350400,,155,4.2

6027377,4,B00FQY4C86,good acting. a little too much sexual content. my kids would like to watch but content over top (sexual deviant),1383350400,,112,4.65
6027378,4,B00FQY4C86,So far Coven is on par with the best of AHS episodes from seasons 1and 2. Bassett and Lange are killing it.,1383350400,,107,3.909090909090909
6027379,5,B00FQY4C86,Love this show. Always order from amazon when I miss it on tv. Always immediately available with no problems. My favorite go to for shows,1383350400,,137,4.52

6027385,4,B00FQY4C86,Look forward to watching the remaining episodes. Hope they continue to get better each weak but feel it will be difficult for the writers to measure up to the earlier seasons.,1383264000,,175,4.67741935483871
6027386,3,B00FQY4C86,"I only gave this 3 stars because I expected more from the creators. The first 2 were so suspenseful and scary, but this one seems to lack something. I hope it gets better as the season moves on.",1383264000,2,194,4.131578947368421
6027387,5,B00FQY4C86,"This is my first time watching the American Horror franchise, the other story lines were a little too disjointed for me or maybe I just never really got into it.  That being said, I love this show. It's shocking but not gratuitously so.  Everything fits in with the  story line without every detail being spelled out like some shows tend to do. This mix of history, race, sex, blood, and magic is brilliant and the actresses are superb.  I have (finally!) found a show where the mature women are not just background for the teenagers who seem to dominate every other series on American television.  I literally cannot wait for the next episode, waiting, watching, holding my breath.",1383264000,,682,4.745762711864407
6027388,3,B00FQY4C86,"I've been very excited for the Coven theme and have enjoyed many aspects of the story.  However, I'm not liking the ""every witch has only one ability"" thing, it feels to x-men and makes for some very flat characters.  The teenagers in particular.  It would be great if they would take less time cramming as much sex as they can into every episode and spend some of that time developing the stories of the young witches.  The story in general has felt more superficial and choppy in comparison to the other seasons, but it is just beginning so here's to hoping that the depth is coming.

I love the soundtrack, I love Jessica Lange and Angela Bassett's characters, and I can't wait to see what is in store for Evan Peters.",1383264000,6,721,4.473282442748092

6027393,4,B00FQY4C86,This is a pretty good witch flick. The opinion of someone who reads a lot of books on real life witches and fictional ones. They don't delve deep yet but it's only 3 eps in so...,1383264000,,178,3.9722222222222223
6027394,5,B00FQY4C86,Awesome show. I am totally addicted to the twists and turns and completely unexpected. Awesome actors awesome storylines. I'm glad I watched it.,1383264000,,144,5.304347826086956

6027398,5,B00FQY4C86,"Can the directors, writers and acting do no wrong? No. We have the perfect mix of talent and imagination in these shows. I turn another corner and thing something may be predictable, but it ends in a failure of predictions. It keeps me jumping. It keeps me glued. Excellent work.",1383177600,4,279,4.6
6027399,4,B00FQY4C86,I was very creeped out while watching this episode. I loved the 1st season of AHS and heard this season was pretty good. I would definitely recommend this to anyone who likes to get a little scared every now and then ;0),1383177600,,220,4.261904761904762
6027400,5,B00FQY4C86,I think it is better than the previous season! I want to see how Kyle and Zoe's love story and we'll see how this happens!,1383177600,,122,3.92
6027401,4,B00FQY4C86,I forgot to record this on  my DVD.  I was grateful to be able to download it from Amazon. I watched season one.  Skipped season 2.  I am into the Coven. It is as good as season one..,1383177600,,183,3.736842105263158

6027404,4,B00FQY4C86,"It was certainly worth the wait between seasons 2 and 3. The off-beat and interesting set-up of ""Coven"" has me hooked already and the New Orleans creepy, voodoo setting is a big plus.",1383177600,,183,4.575757575757576

6027407,5,B00FQY4C86,I will forever be a fan of the American Horror Story trilogy.  Even the part about the racism can stay in this movie.  Only because it is a true depiction of the time set. It's going to be interesting to see what will happen with the coven.  Vodoo is very intriguing to me when its used right.,1383091200,,293,4.105263157894737
6027408,5,B00FQY4C86,Amazing show! So well writtenabd directed. Love how they use the same people just different characters from previous seasons. Crazy,1383091200,,131,5.6
6027409,5,B00FQY4C86,"If, like me, you like it a bit weird with a large side of creepy then American Horror Story is for you. I wasn't sure about the witch theme but became immediately intrigued with the premiere episode. Jessica Lange is always amazing to see and seems born to be on this program. Waste no time! Start watching (any season) now!",1383091200,,324,4.416666666666667
6027410,1,B00FQY4C86,"It had a great premise, but the story line and characters were ridiculous.  Bad story, gory with no purpose but to add shock value.  The witches have strange talents that make no sense. Why is there an evil mistress that tortures slaves?  They are fighting with each other for no reason.  I hate everyone and don't want to watch any  more.  Could have been great.",1383091200,6,363,4.507692307692308
6027411,5,B00FQY4C86,"Wow American Horror Story (AHS) writers have outdone themselves this time. They just keep bringing it on. The more horror,  the better I like it.

6027414,5,B00FQY4C86,It just amazes me how simple and entertaining the idea is to take mostly the same cast and tell a brand new story every year. How will this show ever get old.,1383091200,,158,3.96875
6027415,5,B00FQY4C86,"I am obsessed with this show. Its my favorite... the writing is excellent and daring and sexy. I love dark, sexy, scary shows that are controversial. Keep it up FX!!!! The only criticism I have to voice is the episodes are so delicious they end too quickly. Its like eating a piece of ice-cream cake and u look down to see its gone lol I find it almost painful to watch each week I prefer to watch in bulk... but since its halloween i will watch one more episode than wait till its over to finish it. The first 2 seasons were amazing. I like how AHS takes human emotion, the paranormal, and twists it into an entertaining, disturbing, and moving experience. Its the best of modern television.  Season 2 was my favorite. Jessica Lange rules.",1383091200,4,740,4.4411764705882355

6027420,4,B00FQY4C86,"Ive loved this show since the beginning of season 1. The way it borrows from all the great horror stories of the past is extremely entertaining. I only hope they never run out of great ideas, writers, or cast. The recycling of cast members in new stories each season is brilliant, I would love to see season 2's ""Pepper"" character reappear, she stole all the scenes she was in.",1383091200,,377,4.478260869565218

Jessica Lange shines as always playing the role of Fiona Goode. Evan Peters, Lily Rabe, Katy Bates, Angela Bassett, Taissa Farmiga, Gaborey Sidible and many more all shine in there roles also. I've watched and bought every season on blu ray. I really like the fact the directors focus on the acting over the special effects. I get enough of the special effects in the movies.  I hope AHS gets to go on for many years.  Theres been nothing on tv like this before. Ryan Murphy your brilliant! Keep them coming!!!!",1382918400,,641,4.605263157894737
6027433,2,B00FQY4C86,"Very disappointed in the 3rd season. instead of creating an interesting story based on the subject matter AHS is using it as a vehicle for female porn(violent sex, power over males etc) and to promote a white guilt agenda centered around slavery. I get it, white males are the most evil thing in the world. We are at fault for every travesty from global warming to bad phone reception. Jessica Lange and Kathy Bates are still top notch actors but they cant carry this effort in guilt indoctrination. I wished they had focused on the story instead of a ham fisted political agenda. I may watch one more but I didn't finish episode 3. I found the first two seasons to be excellent. complex story telling, in depth horror, and awesome acting. This is at best an R rated charmed, at worst Marxist-Hollywood dogma.",1382918400,4,809,4.625
6027434,1,B00FQY4C86,"What a disappointment, I'm so sorry for Jessica Lange. This show latches onto every negative female stereotype of all time, it is so negative and horrible. It also latches onto race issues in a self-serving sensationalist and non-enlightening manner, Vomit.

I LOVED the first two seasons, glad we didn't pay for the entire third season, this run is shock value reality show drama drivel. Absolutely terrible.",1382918400,12,409,5.196969696969697
6027435,2,B00FQY4C86,"I have been a diehard AHS fan. Season 1 was outstanding; Season 2 also was very good. But Season 3, so far, is the slowest, dullest season of AHS. There's no compelling story here, just gore and an attempt to shock. And some very unconvincing and ridiculous acting by the younger actors. Jessica Lange, however, never disappoints. Kathy Bates also has been excellent so far.
Let's hope these seasoned professionals help pull this season from the brink of absurdity,",1382918400,10,465,4.89873417721519

It does have some great actors in it, and I was really looking forward to it, but the story line is of such lesser quality than I have come to expect from AHS. I will continue to watch, as my hopes are up for it to get better, scarier and for the plot to grow. The first two seasons were GREAT, and I couldn't wait for the next weeks episode.

I have always loved Lange, and, the addition of Bates and Basset, WOW - immensely interesting, mixed in with some good ole creole folk lore to boot.
I also, really enjoy, how they "" sprinkle "" in previous cast members, into solid parts too.

American horror story is by far one of my favorite shows ever since my brother convinced me to watch one episode of season one; I ended up watching the entire season in one sitting and since then have been hooked. Here's where problems arise with the third season-I was absolutely riveted by the performance of evan peters in season one who played a deranged yet lovable character. In this third season he has been completely underutilized, parading around as an incomprehensible zombie human brought back to life by the forever selfish witch Taissa Famiga plays. Evan becomes a mere body to look at and feel sorry for, while the character they conceived for Taissa is relentlessly annoying and devoid of common sense.

 Then they take Kathy Bates and reduce her to a mere few episodes; someone of her acting stature should of been carried out for the entirety of the season. but the real over arching problem here is the plot itself; I was so excited after the first episode but since then it's been a steady decline of cheap thrills and implementations of storylines that never seem to be getting anywhere. let's face it, the witch plot is plain out corny and not scary at all. it could have been-but the writers seem more enamored with the grotesque this season than developing a real plot line like in season 1 and 2. very disappointed...but I will keep watching until the end to see if things get better.",1382745600,4,1435,4.645669291338582

All I will say is, I think they have outdone themselves with each new season.  I recommend renting a season at a time so you see how twisted a writer can be!

They pick up some social issue and spend way too much time on it instead of sticking to the horror story. Last year it was gay rights. This year the topic is slavery, an issue done to absolute death. If it would stick to the witches story line and spend the entire episode on it, this would be a 5 star season. I find myself getting really interested in the story and character when suddenly they are talking about slavery.

A modern tale of witches with power, controversy, and history. Don't let the fact that the story involves teens, make you think is full of stupidity. Yes, it has the impulsiveness of youngsters being naive, but the consequences are serious and danger is always close by.

Not for minors or the weak minded, it's raw and in your face; if the rest follows the intensity of the beggining, witch fans rejoice.",1382227200,,667,4.6440677966101696
6027497,3,B00FQY4C86,"It is difficult to decide on the number of stars to give this series. 2 or 3? I decided on 3 because there are two different qualities to consider. Acting/production and writing/directing are on different levels. While the acting and production is great, the unrestrained portryal of perversion is astonishing.

I am afraid that the writers have reached the lowest rung of the ladder on this one. While the first two seasons of the series were difficult to watch, but fascinating in high quality production, Season 3 features the most vile perversions in mankind. Please keep in mind that I have only seen two episodes of the series so far. It is sickening to think of children possibly either seeing this deliberately or by accident. Do not buy it.

The story is very intriguing but marred by over-the-top gore and perversion. I got the feeling that the writer/director was afraid that no one would like it if he didn't top the macabre stories in Seasons One and Two. Well, it certainly has been topped those.

I will give it a few more chances. The cast is terrific, especially Kathy Bates, and the quality of production is very high for a television series. Jessica Lange turns in another skillful but heavy handed performance as an evil incarnation. It troubles me that she is always drawn to playing such dark characters. She seems to enjoy being damnable a little too much. Angela Bassett is very good in her role. The supporting cast is capable and they deliver well in their individual roles.

I am hopeful that the next episodes will overcome the frightnight cheapness of the first two episodes, the first being the worst. If the later episodes show some hint of redeeming qualities,I will finish the series. Time will tell.",1382227200,2,1733,4.785953177257525

6027508,5,B00FQY4C86,"i loved jessica lange as a ghost in season one and as a nun in charge of an asylum in season two.  however,the creators of this show just reached the pinnacle of using Lange--they turned her into the head witch in a series called COVEN. we open with a bunch of teen witches being sent to new orleans because they've killed or seriously injured people in their home towns using their powers. they move into a large rooming house situation with a woman in charge of them who will instruct them on using their powers.  all of these women have some formidable powers but then jessica lange blows into town.  she is capable of doing ANYTHING to the rest of them and duly informs that what they really need to be afraid of is HER.

lange, however, does have one weakness.  she is aging and will die ultimately.  she wants to be immortal. she digs up kathy bates in the back yard of the house.  she has been buried alive there for 130 years. lange doesn't care that she was the evilest woman in town. what she wants is what bates has got, immortality. the witch (or voodoo practitioner) who set the spell on bates is played by Angela Bassett (who makes a fabulous looking witch).

so there are these older coven members who are juxtaposed with their teen counterparts.  the big problem with the teens is that they use their powers in ways calculated to bring about troubles in the city when all the older witches want to just fly underneath the radar of the ""civilians"".

part of the success of this series is that each story over its season only runs around 12 episodes which is a real nice length for telling a good yarn without beating it into the ground.  these shows are adopting the foreign model for how a tv show is run as opposed to the old usa network model.  they can also attract the big stars from film, like lange, with these shorter seasons.

it is great to see Bates playing a villain again like she did so well in MISERY.

Cast is top notch. Jessica Lange's best role yet.
I'm a pretty jaded fan of the whole horror genre and this is the first show in a long time (since the first 2 seasons of AHS) that can actually raise goosebumps on my arm.
If you are prone to nightmares after watching disturbing imagery...this is not for you.",1382140800,,384,4.422535211267606
6027511,5,B00FQY4C86,"This is one of my favorite series!  I've watched it since the beginning of Season 1.  It would be really nice if Hulu or Netflix carried this season, but they don't and I had to find somewhere to buy it.

If you're a person that likes supernatural and gore with a strong and very cleverly twisted storyline that keeps your interest, this show is for you.  It's not for children at all and there may be some scenes that even ""bother"" some adults.  If so, that's the beauty of the channel changer, the fast forward, the scene skipper, and the ""off"" button on your remote - lol!

I like how the same main actors pretty much show up in all the seasons as completely different characters - and each season they have at least a couple of bigger name ""guest"" actors/actresses, also.  I think all of the actors/actresses play their parts SO well!  I look forward to this series lasting a very long time!",1382140800,,895,4.414634146341464

I watched the first season and about half way through had to stop it was too much to take late at night. The the 2nd season came there was no way I was watching that at night by myself.  But saw the ads for season 3 and I love Jessica, Kathy and Angela so I am going to try and tough it out and watch season 3 so far so good.....

6027521,4,B00FQY4C86,"I went into the show expecting all the BS that sure enough was present with all the over the top ""rules"" about witches so everythime they popped up I just shrugged it off. A couple scenes were exceptionally stomach turnning but the concepts were neat. My biggest peve would be when the girl was burned to death and the dialog said ""It's Salem all over again."". I took it as the trials since they saved themselves when they depicted the hanging and not a burning in Salem. Despite all the stupid idiocy that comes when non-witches stick their creative hands in the witch's boiling cauldron, such as the all girl's club foolishness, the story is riveting and I'm hooked to see more. Just hoping they do their homework and don't cheese out by pulling out the other W word and I'll continue to watch.

As I expected I am not finding this season at all scary but it is a fun show to watch!

The second season however should have put an award in the hand of every actor involved. Jessica Lange, Sarah Paulson, Lily Rabe, Evan Peters, James Cromwell, Zachary Quinto, Clea Duvall, and Dylan McDermott all deserved an award for their performances. Season 3 Coven, already delivered one in the first five minutes from Kathy Bates. Now you know she already won the academy award for playing a crazy psycho. Now she proved why in the opening of AHS: Coven. So we have Academy Award Winner Kathy Bates, Academy Award Winner Jessica Lange, Academy Award Nominee Angela Bassett, Academy Award Nominee Gabourey Sidibe, Tony Award Winner Patty Lupone, and every other person in this cast been nominated for something. So it should be one of the best acted stories on tv, period. These women are all strong, gifted and just plain good at what they do. I enjoyed the first episode greatly. I only wish that Angela and Francis Conroy had been in it more. Great story, so far. Cant wait to see what these amazing actors do.",1381622400,5,1112,4.827225130890052
6027568,5,B00FQY4C86,"I loved AHS and AHS Asylum. I was stoked about season 3....until I heard that it would be about witches, which sounded lame and not very scary. I watched the 1st episode though and loved it! Jessica Lange was perfect as always, and now they have added the superb Kathy Bates to the show! Many of the fantastic actors from seasons 1 and 2 are back, along with a few new faces, like Gabourey Sidibe. I can't wait to see the rest of the season.",1381622400,,441,4.2
6027569,4,B00FQY4C86,"I'ts too early to tell how well the season will be, but as always, the acting is amazing! I will wait to see what the writers came up with. You just can't beat Jessica Lange. And now they have added Kathy Bates too! All of the actors are wonderful, but I am stating that the ONLY reason I attempted to start watching season 1 was due to Jessica Lange. I am so glad I did-Phenomenal levels this woman can reach! I love the show now, but absolutely would not continue to watch without Jessica Lange. MUST SEE SERIES for newcomers....",1381622400,4,531,4.32
6027570,5,B00FQY4C86,Love it so far. Kathy Bates character was awesome and reminded me how evil she was in Misery too. The cast is well chosen and I can see a great story line forming. American Horror Story is full of surprises and I will continue to watch this delightful nugget of shocking fun. I can't wait for Wednesday night!,1381622400,,309,4.344827586206897
6027571,5,B00FQY4C86,I missed the first episode and found it on Amazon Video to my delight! This should be another excellent season of American Horror Story and I'm so glad they brought back many of the same actors that were in Season 1 & 2!!! This show has become my favorite guilty pleasure--and always has lots of twists and turns!!! MUST SEE TV!!!,1381622400,2,330,4.426229508196721

6027577,5,B00FQY4C86,"I am so obsessed with season 3! It sucked me in from episode one. It is riveting, new, and so original. Like NOTHING else on TV. I would whole heartedly recommend this series for anyone who appreciates the mystical witch stories. Really very good. It is coming close to being up to par with ""The Originals"" and ""The vampire diaries"". I actually think I might like this series even more then those (which is saying ALOT, since I LOVE those two shows). Give it a watch.

6027585,5,B00FQY4C86,I love it love it love it. I am a huge fan to AHS. This one is better then the 2nd season but not good as the first season. I love the acting and plot.

6027587,1,B00FQY4C86,"the show started off amazing with such hope and want only to be tarnished by what i dare say is a killing vagina. one of the main characters early on finds that her power, like most women, derives from her flesh lettuce and once pounded it turns the disco stick into a bloody mess starting at the cranium this show has taken a turn for the worst but after aliens, ghost, zombies, the devil and a crazed murderer I guess killing vaginas is all you got left . this will most likely be the last episode  and I think the most comical.",1381449600,6,530,4.196078431372549
6027588,5,B00FQY4C86,"American Horror Story: Coven premiered this week, and boy did it come back with a bang! If one thing was made clear by the opening episode, it's that this season will be continuing, and increasing, the series trend of ""can they really show this on TV!?"" Now if you like happy little fairy tales, then you might not find this show appealing. But if you like horror that's dark, and brutal, and at times sickening, then boy is this the show for you.

I love the set up for this season so far, and I'm happy to see so many of the cast that we love so much back again (although I'm still hoping to see Zachary Quinto and Dylan McDermott).

Now all this said, you can't judge the whole season by a single episode, so I'll be coming back once a week to edit and update this review as necessary as the season progresses.

I would especially encourage those who stream or torrent the episodes to buy the set, in order to support the series. Not that the show is hurting for popularity, especially after the explosive success of season 2, but even so we should all try and support the creators and show encouragement for brilliant but non-mainstream shows like this.

*Spoilers Start Here*

UPDATE 10/31/2013:

Ok, so the first half of the Halloween episode just aired, and wow has the season thus far lived up to promises made in the premiere. So far we've had weird snake sex, weird Minotaur sex (well almost), weird cross-generational zombie incest, mass murder, a lynching, and the beginnings of a big old race/turf war between two clans of witches. The best way I can describe this carnival of carnage is that it's an all female Harry Potter on bath salts. That's what I've always liked about Ryan Murphy, Glee aside, he's never been afraid to ""go there"" on a lot of his projects, which to me, is perfect for a show like this. Horror is supposed to scare, shock, and/or disgust you, and this being the case, American Horror Story more than does its job.",1381449600,157,1949,4.491525423728813
6027589,5,B00FQY4C86,"From the opening scene, Kathy Bates wows mean, gritty, gory depiction of Madame Delphine LaLaurie, as she tortures her slaves "":Because she can"" , which takes you back to her Misery days, and gives another award-worthy disturbing, but amazing performance.  Then on to Taissa Farmiga, brought back from season 1 as she discovers her power and gets swept off to special witch school in NOLA Hogwarts style.  We have Jessica Lange as the Supreme witch, bringing her A-game again as an aging witch trying to gain  back her youth, as she joins her daughter played by Sara Paulson (the potion creating witch), to ""help"" her at her special girls' school. We get a Mean Girls/Teen Witch snarkiness of young teenage witches meeting each other for the first time, with Emma Roberts, Gabare Sidibe (Award Nominee for Precious).  Denis O'Hare as the strange mute butler.  Also get brief glimpses in this episode of Evan Peters, Angela Bassett as our resident VooDoo Queen, and Francis Conroy.  I think this could be the best season of yet of this show.  I like that this series while fictional uses factual elements from our history in their depiction of horror.  Great writing with their cut and dry snarky one-liners.  ""Maybe I'll drop a house on you"".  ""That one there - she's smarter than all of you put together"", ""Is that your superpower, sensing dehydration"" ""The light hit him just fine"".  This show, like other shows on the F/X channel that allows all this graphic-ness also brings real issues of everyday life to light.  If you are a horror fan, I think you will enjoy it.",1381449600,76,1570,4.774074074074074
8618055,3,B00FQY4C86,"This third installment of AHS does not have the same quality as Season 1 and has some noticeable flaws.  There is an uneven treatment of witches and women in general.  And, the negative aspects of human nature are significantly magnified in this series.

From the introductory segment with women dancing around a bonfire, possibly colluding with supernatural creatures, and wearing hoods and gowns (reminiscent of KKK?) to the almost sideshow depiction of the characters for most of the show until the very end, the series only plays on stereotypes and portrays women in an unfair light.  Moreover, the women characters were often shown as being petty, disloyal, vengeful, and murderous.  They missed a valuable opportunity to explore in detail the humanity of these women who have extraordinary gifts and are marginalized and even ostracized by society.

As far as the production value is concerned, the show started off well, though, with just a superficial background description of the Salem witch history.  From there, especially the last three shows, the quality deteriorated with more than enough blood and gore to satisfy the genre.  Some directing choices, like many odd camera angles, are less than interesting.  And the writing is less than satisfactory.  Inconsistencies abound and many characters are not well developed.

Jessica Lange gives an interesting performance as the Supreme.  Kathy Bates is wasted as the bigoted and murderous matron.  Her treatment of her slaves was despicable and shocking, but did the writers have to devote such a large portion of the series to her?  The talented Taissa Farmiga as Zoe Benson is delightful again.  Her character, though, wasn't as well developed as her more memorable Violet Harmon portrayal in Season 1.  Sarah Paulson as Cordelia gives a fine performance.  The abusive relationship she suffered through her mother and later other characters was unfortunate considering her kind nature and the care she had for the well-being of the Coven.  After what she went through, I was surprised that she retained her good grace and tolerance towards the other characters.",1530835200,,2124,5.233727810650888
