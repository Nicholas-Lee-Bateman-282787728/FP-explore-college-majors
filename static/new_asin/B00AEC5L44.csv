8550369,3,B00AEC5L44,"I bought this for my three-year-old grandson after reading all the positive reviews from others who had bought it and enjoyed it, finding it very exciting. Well, it was okay, exciting was a stretch. It was really disappointing after reading all those positive reviews.
My grandson watched it once or twice and had no interest in seeing it again. Neither did I. It was really rather boring. My grandson still loves Monster Jam trucks and watching them do their thing. There just wasn't much excitement or thrills in this particular DVD.",1397779200,,535,4.8901098901098905
