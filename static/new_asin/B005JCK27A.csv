8475607,5,B005JCK27A,"This recording celebrates the musical legacy and heritage of Pastor John Hagee.  He not only is a pastor, but a wonderful musician.  The music has a ""dixieland"" feel and you can tell that he loves his roots.  The band, the singers and Pastor Hagee do not dieappoint you on this wonderful recording! I suggest you get a copy for yourself.",1423872000,,337,4.583333333333333
8475608,5,B005JCK27A,Wonderful dvd wish it had been long running for i can ver get enought of the songs of god,1422921600,,89,3.736842105263158
8475609,5,B005JCK27A,"I have both the CD & DVD so I guess that shows how much I love these people and their music.  There are some great old hymns that took me back to the days of my youth and touched my heart.  ""Victory In Jesus"" is only one of the many great songs  on ""Lifetime of Music"" it always reminds me of my Dad as this was his favorite song.

Pastor Hagee, shares things about his life and music on the DVD that are not on the CD.

If I had to complain about the CD or DVD my only complaint would be that neither lasts long enough for me, some things you just don't want to end.",1419724800,,567,3.8119658119658117
8475610,5,B005JCK27A,"There are a lot of older songs on this video, and some interviews revealing some of his life.  It was really good.",1392681600,,114,4.181818181818182
8475611,4,B005JCK27A,"I purchased this item for someone else, so I am not sure if it was satisfactory. Since I have had no complaints from the owner, I assume it was okay.",1389139200,,149,4.0
8475612,5,B005JCK27A,"I enjoyed this music, both singing and just instruments.  There was a little too much talking, but some of the stories were interesting.  Like the fact that Pastor John has the same musical instrument that he has had since he was a boy.  And still plays it too.  Even though it was performed before a live audience, it was in an informal format, and I like that a lot.",1381968000,,368,4.2898550724637685
8475613,5,B005JCK27A,Very good would buy another for gifts etc. I think very highly of John Hagee and his family! Wow what great talent in this family,1376956800,,129,4.2
