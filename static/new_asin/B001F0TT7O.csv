3559002,5,B001F0TT7O,My 18 month old absolutely loves this series.  Throw out boring useless teletubies and get these cute clamation dvd's.  Great for traveling on the airplane too!,1289520000,,160,5.115384615384615
3559003,4,B001F0TT7O,"I was excited to find the Pingu DVDs, including this one, on Amazon.  My sons adore Pingu and were bummed every time we used up all our free Netflix minutes watching Meet Pingu and Pingu on Thin Ice over and over again.  This collection is still good, stories are still funny, characters and animation fun to watch and my 3 and 5 year boys love it.  But it somehow lacks the freshness of the first two collections.  If my boys have a choice between this and Pingu on Thin Ice, [which I also got on Amazon] they pick On Thin Ice first every time.  Still a good buy, but if you can only get one...I would get the other.  Still waiting to find a copy of Meet Pingu I can pick up!",1273968000,4,676,4.083333333333333

3559005,5,B001F0TT7O,My son can't get enough of this video this is one of two of his favorites....the other is also Pingu.,1256860800,,101,4.1
3559006,2,B001F0TT7O,"I bought 3 videos for my kids 2 to 4, years old. But unfortunately this is not the original pingu. They supposely have improved the filming and animation but actually they have complpetely lost the spirit and charm of the original pingu's.",1240358400,8,239,4.714285714285714
3559007,4,B001F0TT7O,This DVD is absolutely hilarious.  My 4 and 6 year old boys belly laugh every time they watch it.  Pingu is as funny as ever.  Give it a try!  You'll love it!  Mook-mook!,1228694400,,170,4.03030303030303
3559008,2,B001F0TT7O,"This Pingu lacks the charm the earlier releases had.  Noisy and frantic, my 6-year-old wasn't impressed and neither was I.",1226966400,6,122,5.1

8300279,5,B001F0TT7O,My kid loves this show.  They used to have it on Netflix but they stopped streaming it.  So we bought her a couple to get her Pingu fix.,1454284800,,136,3.8214285714285716
8300280,3,B001F0TT7O,"The Pingu cartoons are fantastic.  This particular collection is not one of the best collections.  If you are only buying one Pingu collection, I would recommend one of the other collections.",1444176000,,191,5.129032258064516
8300281,5,B001F0TT7O,"The claymation is done so well. More so, through Pingu's trials and tribulations, children witness that there are consequences (good and bad) for a young penguin's actions. My two-year-old son adores Pingu and has for over a year.",1440201600,,230,5.078947368421052
8300282,1,B001F0TT7O,"The only thing that played on this movie were the previews.  Every single episode started for five seconds and then either paused or auto skipped to the next episode.  There are supposed to be ten episodes, 37 minutes of play time, and we maybe saw a minute at the very most, all consisting of the intro to the actual episode.  Pingu is no longer on Netflix and the only way to get it is by finding it online, and even then its still hard.  This was a birthday present for my daughter, and when she began to cry because it wasn't working you can imagine how infuriated I felt.  We waited 9 days for this item, but for it to come completely unplayable.  I am beyond disappointed.  This is the first and hopefully last thing I have to file a complaint on with the seller.",1433980800,,769,4.2620689655172415
8300283,5,B001F0TT7O,my grand daughter absolutely loves pingu.there is no particular language and it is just adorable.pingu gets into all kinds of scrapes and troubles and always learns from his mistakes.,1401753600,,183,5.344827586206897
8300284,5,B001F0TT7O,"I can't think of anyone I know, who wouldn't love Pingu. Great for any age. Great for anyone who needs a laugh. Great for 2 year olds who aren't ready for senseless violence on cartoons.",1396051200,,186,4.3428571428571425
8300285,5,B001F0TT7O,"This is a cute DVD.  You can't understand much of the language because it is spoken in ""Penguin"" but you get the message anyway.  My grandchildren and I really enjoyed this video.  Their ages range from 4 to 10.  This is safe for the whole family to watch.",1294012800,,256,4.270833333333333
8300286,4,B001F0TT7O,"me and my son (3yrs) are big Pingu fans. we are used to the older Pingus with the cruder animation and the soft voices. me personally, these newer ones are way too loud and noisy! but once in awhile my son does like to watch the newer ones.",1291075200,,240,4.020833333333333
