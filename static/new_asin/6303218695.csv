7841339,4,6303218695,"Baseball - Inning 7, The Capital of Baseball (1950-1960) is two hours and twelve minutes and fifty-four second long and was aired on September 26, 1994. Inning 7 is mainly devoted to three teams: Brooklyn Dodgers, New York Giants, and New York Yankees. We learn a few other things as well but 90% of the video is devoted to those three teams. We are introduced to the Ol' Perfesser, Casey Stengel and his use of Stengelese; something Yogi Berra would inherit. Joe DiMaggio retires and Mickey Mantle takes his place. Mickey would forever be plague with injuries throughout his entire baseball career. During this decade a lot teams move from one city to another. In 1953 the Boston Braves become the Milwaukee Braves, the Saint Louis Brown become the Baltimore Orioles in 1954, Philadelphia Athletics become the Kansas City Philadelphia Athletics in 1955, and finally at the end of the 1957 season the New York Giants become the San Francisco Giants and Brooklyn Dodgers become the Los Angeles Dodgers. Willie Mays makes his famous catch, Don Larsen pitches the only perfect game in the World Series, we get the shot heard around the world and next year finally came for Dem Bums. Overall I enjoyed Inning 7 very much. Since I am not a Yankee fan but a Yankee hater, I could only give this video a B+.

7841340,5,6303218695,"If you are not a fan of New York baseball--as in Yankees, Dodgers and Giants--then this ""inning"" of Ken Burns' classic documentary series on ""Baseball"" is not for you because those three teams dominate this episode the way they dominated the game in the 1950's.  From 1949 to 1958 there was a New York club in every World Series and in six of those series the Yankees battled the Dodgers or Giants.  These were the Yankees of Casey Stengel, Yogi Berra, Whitey Ford and Mickey Mantle; the Dodgers of Walter Alston, Jackie Robinson, Duke Snider, Roy Campanella, Pee Wee Reese and Gil Hodges; the Giants of Leo Durocher, Willie Mays and Bobby Thompson.  This was the decade that saw Willie Mays catch the blast from the bat of Vic Wertz and Eddie Gaedel walk on four straight pitches, where Thompson hit the most famous home run in baseball history as the Giants won the pennant and Don Larsen pitched the only perfect game in World Series history.  It was also the decade that saw franchises start to move as we suddenly had the Los Angeles Dodgers, the San Francisco Giants and the Milwaukee Braves.  For me, ""The Capital of Baseball"" is where my memories and the history of baseball finally start to overlap, since I actually saw Mantle, Mays and Aaron play.  The series starts to take on a different feel at this point because we are now up to the age of television, so there are less newsreel clips and black & white photographs.  But watching ""Baseball"" on opening day is a personal rite of spring with me, and even if the game is over at this place, you have to stick around until the game is actually over.",986083200,9,1611,4.5344827586206895
