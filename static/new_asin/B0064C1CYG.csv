4948892,5,B0064C1CYG,My kids love the movie. Especially since Taylor Roberts lives down the street and they show him leaving his house and riding on our trails.

4948927,5,B0064C1CYG,"The Makers of Moto3 are incredible . For me (a Dirt Bike Enthusiast) , there couldn't be a more enjoyable or more entertaining way to spend an hour . The photography is so great and the interviewing so sincere that You feel like thanking the Riders next time You them at a Race . We have Group Rides up at my NoCal Cabin and I can't wait to share this (on the 65 inch LED) with the Guys and Gals that Ride here ..",1407283200,,413,3.9285714285714284

4948939,4,B0064C1CYG,"If you want it with the pressure on, and the way some get to that point in life. Then this MOTO movie is for you. Very well put together like the classic (On Any Sunday). I like how it progresses from the first one. This is one of the fastest most demanding motor sports in the world, like Formula One and INDY cars. The riders take great risk, weather they are just having fun, doing drills or practice you get to see a lot of it.
ENJOY",1373587200,,437,4.0344827586206895
