7976941,5,B00007IT95,"I bought this video for my son who is 16 and mildly mentally handicapped. He loves trains and especially steam. This video is informative on the history of the 3985, but not too detailed or complicated to make it boring for a kid. The visuals is what my son likes the best. Great shots of the train in all conditions. I would reccomend it for entertainment purposes. Maybe not for 3 year olds but great for a bit older and any train lover.",1197849600,3,439,4.301204819277109
7976942,3,B00007IT95,"I had expected this to be a lot about the train's history and technical details with lots of shots and information about the components and systems making up this incredible machine.

Instead it was almost all shots of the locomotive and train going past various crossings, over various bridges, etc. Nice but one of the advantages of having it on DVD is that you can watch a drive by scene over and over until your thumb wears out so there is not a lot to be gained by putting 55 minutes of them on a DVD. One shot from each side and one showing the articulation and you are pretty much done.

If you do like the endless repetition of the same locomotive pulling the same train going by a hundred times or so you will really like this video!",1108944000,24,742,4.292857142857143
