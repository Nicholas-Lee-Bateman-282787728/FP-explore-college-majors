8210468,4,B000TRNDXU,"I truly enjoyed this DVD, and would certainly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in starting soapmaking. I really would like to have seen Ann Marie go over how to clean up such caustic materials though. Can you rinse these utensils in the kitchen sink? Can you put them in the dishwasher? Are the products safe for septic systems?
I will continue to search answers to these questions. But the video is a keeper! I've watched it about 6 times now.",1258934400,4,454,4.617283950617284
8210469,4,B000TRNDXU,"Making CP Soap is very informative DVD that teaches the basics of CP soapmaking.  The Dvd covers Soapmaking Supplies, Equipment, Troubleshooting & Making Soap from scratch.  However, I wished it was a little bit longer especially for the price.  However, I certainly think it is worth adding to your soapmaking library. I would definitely recommend to all soapmakers and those who are aspiring to be soapmakers.",1255651200,6,411,5.196969696969697
