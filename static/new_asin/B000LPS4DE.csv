2712244,2,B000LPS4DE,VERY BORING LOOK A WHAT A SERIAL KILLER WAS SUPPOSED TO BE THINKING ABOUT WHEN HE WASGOING TO KILL TWO GIRLS AND WHY IF INTERESTED RENT DON'T BUY,1184803200,3,145,4.214285714285714
2712245,3,B000LPS4DE,"In 1971, there was a little film called ""The Slaughter."" From all accounts, the film was horrendous. So it was re-edited, and a special scene was added at the end. Then, with the tagline ""A film that could only be made in South America, where life is cheap,"" the film was re-released in 1976 as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Snuff/dp/B000096IBY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Snuff</a>. The special scene supposedly depicted an actual murder, committed especially for the film. An intensive publicity campaign, including fake protesters who were hired to add to the film's notoriety, led to success.

Nearly thirty years later, along comes ""The Great American Snuff Film."" As the box and the film tell us again and again, this is the true story of William Allen Grone, a nasty serial killer who was executed in 2003. But wait, it gets worse. Grone was driven by his desire to make, in his own words, ""the great American snuff film,"" and he actually produced 2 1/2 minutes of it--along with a number of diary entries that detailed his horrific crimes. But wait again! It gets even worse. This DVD contains ""actual"" footage from the murder. Just jump to the end of the film, and there it is. (It's right after the statement in the film that it's illegal in the United States to own a snuff film.)

Okay, reality check. Search for ""William Allen Grone"" online, and you'll find nothing but references to this film. The film claims that some names were changed to protect certain people, so maybe, just maybe, the filmmakers decided that the real killer's name shouldn't be used lest the film somehow sully his reputation. But then you look at the people who were executed in 2003 in the United States, and you find nobody who remotely fits the bill. Then there's the question of just how likely it is that a film with the actual footage of a murder would make it into reputable stores and Amazon.com.

So the whole thing's a stunt to entice viewers. There's nothing new there.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Texas-Chain-Saw-Massacre/dp/B000FS9FE4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Texas Chain Saw Massacre</a>&nbsp;claimed to be real. So did&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Blair-Witch-Project/dp/B00001QGUM/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Blair Witch Project</a>. And, as noted, ""Snuff"" did, too. None of them, however, claimed to have the actual footage.

Beyond the marketing campaign, there is the issue of the film itself. This is a gritty, low-budget film that is done fairly well. The killers (Grone and his accomplice) abduct two girls whom Grone plans to murder as part of his snuff film. For a period of days, they torture the girls in a variety of ways, and most of this part of the film is quite convincing. All four actors do a very good job: Mike Marsh as the cold, calculating Grone; Ryan Hutman as the impulsive and dim-witted Roy; and Melinda Lorenz and Holi Tavernier as the victims. We also see periodic flashbacks to Grone's recent past, including his first murder.

Unlike, say,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Silence-of-the-Lambs/dp/B000LP6KNU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Silence of the Lambs</a>, which was based, in part, on a real case but which featured the completely unrealistic Hannibal Lector, ""The Great American Snuff Film"" rings true. Though there was no real Grone, the character we see could indeed be any number of predators out there. The gritty filmmaking, no doubt in large part because of budget constraints, works well at conveying a sense of dread and hopelessness that pervades the film. Like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Henry-Portrait-of-a-Serial-Killer/dp/B0009OUBC4/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Henry - Portrait of a Serial Killer</a>, ""The Great American Snuff Film"" succeeds to whatever extent it does in large part because of the techniques.",1179273600,45,4014,5.796610169491525

8163381,3,B000LPS4DE,"First off if you are thinking this is going to be a snuff porn film.. it isn't so get your sick mind out of the gutter.

I read a few reviews and was surprised that people would write things in reviews warning people that this was not based on a true story, and that is just a trick used by film makers. No kidding really? So you are saying ""fargo"" wasn't based on actual events? Makes me chuckle that anyone would think they had to write that.
  Anyway, this is just a low budget campy horror movie. Not scary, possibly offensive.. especialy to women, not particularly graphic, no real nutity to speak of,  Almost seems like a made for cable movie. But THey said they made it for under 3000.00$ Good for them. If you like bad horror movies, then it may be worth a look. Just don't overpay for it or you'll kick yourself. I only bought it because I had 10$ left to spend on an amazon.com giftcard so I figured what the heck.",1294358400,,924,4.232954545454546

8163383,3,B000LPS4DE,"This independent film did hold my attention from beginning to end, although I was somewhat disappointed. I expected more torture, gore and horror. The abducted girls were kept too distant as people to relate to. They are never really defined and never say much, so I never really felt connected to them or their plight. It's a horrible story, of course, and the roles are well played, but it just misses the mark for this genre. Also, I do not believe the ""actual"" snuff footage was real, although well simulated.",1231113600,,513,4.711111111111111

8163385,1,B000LPS4DE,"Real ""serial killers"" are not high-IQ Hannibal Lecter types.  They are idiots with empty useless lives.  This film is a good portrayal of a self-centered dumbass convincing himself he's doing something significant.  The subject line is one of the villain Grone's ""deep"" utterances.",1222041600,,281,5.488372093023256

This movie, didn't scare me, make me feel for anyone in the movie.  I kept waiting to see the torture, that really never comes.  Cigarette burns?  Thats all they could write up?  I came out feeling I just wasted an hour and a half of my life.",1216857600,5,415,4.1125
8163387,2,B000LPS4DE,"Tedious. That is the only word needed to describe this film. It has an interesting idea, but it is just butched with boring. It also happens to be a gritty, low-budget film that isn't the worst I have ever seen. The film is quite convincing mostly because the acting is so bad  and the pacing of the film is so plodding.",1215302400,,320,4.245901639344262
8163388,4,B000LPS4DE,"""I have a nervous condition, I can't get an erection with a woman.  I've found this problem goes away once they've stopped moving.""

Those are the words of William Allen Grone, a psychopathic serial killer whose terrifying snuff film is actually shown at the end of this movie.  It also reenacts several disturbing scenes based on his journal entries.
Now here's the big question--Is it real?  Uhh no, of course not.  It's the Blair Murderer Project.  But this raw footage certainly has a real feel and creepy atmosphere.  It might make you squirm.
Now, unfortunately this film does have some problems.  The acting is subpar, which isn't really important when a person is getting their head bashed in.  Other times it is noticeable.  Also there are some slow moments, extended periods where William is contemplating his next move, I guess.  Cut about 20min out and this film wouldn't ever drag.
The special effects do look realistic.  There is some extreme violence, rape, and nudity.  I've seen much worse, but still, this isn't for everybody.
Finally, the last two minutes show the ""snuff"" film.  It does look very real.  It's not too graphic by today's standards, just a bullet in the head.  Overall, this is a decent horror flick, recommended for you lovers of gore.",1203724800,12,1270,4.864485981308412
8163389,4,B000LPS4DE,"My original review on Film Threat is quoted in the editorial review section of this listing.  I stand by it.  This is not for timid viewers.  Is it real?  No.  Will some people think it's real?  Yes.  Will it disturb you?  There's a good chance it will.

The title alone will turn people off and keep them away from this.  If you're on the fence about it, though, as I've said before, this pushes boundaries.  It is not entertainment.  That's what makes it excel.  That's what makes it worth viewing.

I have the original film with the earlier artwork, so I can't speak of any extras on this disc, but the film alone is worth the price ... unless, of course, you're afraid to step outside the box.",1201910400,4,697,4.34375
