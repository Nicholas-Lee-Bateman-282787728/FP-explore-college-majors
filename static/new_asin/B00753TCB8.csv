Plus it has cuts in it that make the dvd very jumpy so you know its cut. I owned the vhs and I know of what I speak. I bought the dvd in hopes it was the complete version but it isn't even close",1417132800,,313,3.90625
8510328,3,B00753TCB8,"It is barely a direct transfer from the vhs version on dvd- horrible quality. But, on the other hand, we really couldn't expect a remasterized version for this really obscure and unknown german b movie. It is a limited of 500, so we're lucky to see it on dvd anyway.",1383609600,,266,4.34

8510330,3,B00753TCB8,"This was the type of film you saw, with the very LURID exploitation adverts in the paper - and it lives up to the hype as to nudity and the Euro style of horror, and the cheese to go with it.  If you remember going to the drive in each weekend to see these import films and running to the snack bar in between features - this will appeal, but for persons looking for a serious demon possession type film, nope -- Euro explotaiton at its top notch, just not more than that.",1346025600,4,472,4.075268817204301

An old man is found crucified by a streetwalker in a German village. Miles away at a remote boarding school in Munich, the man's granddaughter suddenly begins to exhibit very strange behavior as though she were demonically possessed and now spews obscenities (instead of pea soup) and runs around naked (instead of bug-walking on the ceiling). Yes, friends, this is yet another attempt to capitalize on the huge international success of 'The Exorcist', this time by the Germans and, like all other attempts, there's more unintentional humor than horror in the finished product. But that never stops dolts like me from watching them, so why would it stop the producers from making them?

I had higher hopes for this one since it was directed by Walter Boos, one of those responsible for the long-running German 'Schoolgirl Report' films. I knew it wouldn't be good, but I thought it would be an interesting collision of genres. But it winds up being William Friedkin by way of Ed Wood Jr., which is both its weakness and its strength, assuming you've broken out the bong and hard liquor when the credits started. It does have some mildly interesting moments, like the grandfather's crucifixion, when the possessed 'Magdalena' rips a bible in half with her bare hands and, oh yeah, the heaping of frontal nudity heaved our way. While actually not much more foul-mouthed than your average teenager today when she supposedly 'shocks' us with her sacrilegious profanities, I had to chuckle at the scene where she informs a priest she wants to take communion, but not in her mouth...(Again, I wonder why I scare people). Regrettably though, satanic possession doesn't turn her into the crazed nympho we had hoped, but rather a virginal tease from hell that gets grown men killed fighting over her. But again, there is ample gratuitious nudity to get us over this, um, hump...or lack thereof.

The lead actress Dagmar Henrich has an early 70's teen look about her, kind of like Maureen McCormick or Susan Dey gone horribly bad (before they actually did in real life), if full-frontal nudity is your idea of horribly bad. Due to the unusually-severe budget limitations, the dear girl has to work a lot harder than Linda Blair to convince anybody she's possessed and, where Blair's voice was dubbed by Mercedes McCambridge, this poor chick gets dubbed by the usual gang of Euro-idiots who render these flicks cartoonish and almost unwatchable. Almost...

'Magdalena, Possessed by the Devil' is brimming with delirious sleaze and exploitative elements, so fans of outrageous transgressive cultcinema will quite possibly be enthralled. The acting terrible, the plot weak and there's no suspense or horror whatsoever, but who cares when a craving for Eurotrash beckons? Certainly not I, not by a longshot. All others, consider yourself duly warned.

My final thoughts: if you're really in the mood for flicks like this, pick up Jess Franco's 'Exorcism', Paul Naschy's 'Exorcismo' and Andrea Bianchi's 'Malabimba, The Malicious Whore' (the adult, unrated edition) - why not make it a Trinity of hokey, unholy Eurohorror? Gather a few like-minded minions, chill the Jaegermeister glasses and break out the stash you've been sitting on for the appropriate occasion. You're guaranteed a great time and can thank me later. But the gluttonous among you will want to be possessed by 'Magdalena' regardless.",1341273600,7,3474,5.089473684210526
