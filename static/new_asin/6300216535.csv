I bought this classic from amazon when I realized I had no rental options. Donald Sutherland's talent is really showcased in this film and shows his true brilliance as a Character Actor.

254932,4,6300216535,"Deeply unpleasant movie.  I couldn't turn it off, though.  Gorgeously shot and with interesting performances, it's a bit of a curio.  Although the apocalyptic vision is unrelentingly bleak, and the characters all grotesquely drawn, it strikes a familiar chord about the darkness that lurks in the human soul, and the extent to which morally empty people will go to perpetuate their personal mythologies.

People behave badly.  It seems to get worse out there in the world rather than better.  And sometimes they behave badly en-masse.  Ferguson Lately.  Locust devouring for all of their own reasons .. rather than rising above to achieve higher levels of consciousness for themselves and their community.  More of the same.  But for some people I guess this is mysterious and worth examining in this movie with a bit of character study going on in it as well",1418515200,,708,4.449612403100775
254934,5,6300216535,"We saw The Day of the Locust back in the day of the nostalgia craze ruling pop culture. Since I had not yet read the original novel, I was astonished by this film's dark characterization of that golden age of Hollywood produced during the great depression. Despite a knowledge of history, this film's nightmarish insight into the era was overwhelming.

The acting is top notch, as are all the production values. The lives of the characters are in complete contrast to what they, themselves, live to emulate as seen on the Big Screen. The desperate fans are blinded by a desire for fame and the resulting wealth that is constantly rubbed in their faces by the establishment of Hollywood. But it is clear that Hollywood has no regard for them, even to the point of allowing them to die en masse during a reenacted war scene when the set collapses. The guilt is covered up, and the facade of perfection goes on.

There is a particularly disturbing character -- a child actor. It seems unclear to me wether this pre-pubescent youth is male or female, lending a slightly more disturbing element to his/her behavior. If you could imagine an evil Shirley Temple of uncertain gender, that is the character who lives to taunt the residents of the complex with an unusually spot-on insight into exactly what torments them.

In the end, it is Homer, the most mild-mannered character who succumbs to the torment of the little devil, and therefore unleashes the madness of the adoring mobs.

The Day of the Locust is not to be missed because it is absolutely brilliant on every level.",1412294400,2,1571,4.7226277372262775

254956,2,6300216535,"Nathanael West was a great stylist: bitter, grimly hilarious, and always within kissing distance of surrealism. The director, screenwriter, and cinematographer of this filmed adaptation never found an objective correlative for conveying this stylistic essence of West's fiction. Thus this slow-moving film is well-cast, well-acted, and essentially faithful to  the plot, but the rendering is, nevertheless, a tepid zombie version of a great novel.

John Schlesinger's THE DAY OF THE LOCUST impeccably recreates the sleaziest elements of 1930s Hollywood. In this world, dreams are dashed simply because they're -meant- to be destroyed, and happy endings don't even exist in the movies.

All primary actors (plus many of the film's minors) turn in excellent portrayals, and yet this one can be a mixed bag.

The rather unusual-looking Karen Black is at her best here. Donald Sutherland's Homer Simpson is a tragic, unforgettable character. William Atherton as thwarted artist Tod Hackett is quite good, as is little Billy Barty's drunken, foul-mouthed Abe Kusich-- he's masterful in that cokfight scene.

The best performance though has to be Burgess Meredith's Harry Greener. The struggling ex-vaudevillian's illness-induced strangulation is so believeable.

Jackie Earle Haley ('Adore') is now Freddy Kreuger in the brand new Elm St. remake! He's amazing at age 13 as a much younger Shirley Temple clone. Adore is a curly-haired tap-dancing mimic of a brat who accidentally sets off this movie's grippingly surreal final sequence.

254963,3,6300216535,"Watched this one after having read of Karen Black 's death.  She had memorable roles, I.e.,  Five Easy Pieces, and I could not recall having seen this one in its day.  So, I watched with anticipation.  Found it sadly dated and cliche.",1379030400,,234,4.5
254964,5,6300216535,"Despite some unevenness, this is an outstanding film that still comments trenchantly on the state of the world today, despite having been made nearly 40 years ago. Set in the Great Depression, it rings true in the era of the Great Recession as well. History does repeat itself when we forget the lessons of the past. Having seen it when it was first released, I found it even better this time around.

Donald Sutherland's performance is stellar, & the supporting cast is also brilliant. Direction & cinematography rise to the same high level, so what's not to like? The final scene is truly apocalyptic, although some moments are hard to take for the squeamish..",1375315200,,662,4.807017543859649
254965,5,6300216535,"I had this on VHS but lost it. I was hoping it would come out on DVD and it has and is available on Amazon. A Hollywood story, that is very different from the cliche versions of Hollywood. Donald Sutherland and Karen Black are the main characters. It takes place in early Hollywood and holds your interest all the way through with an amazing, exciting ending outside of Grauman's Chinese Theater. If you are a collector of DVD movies, this is one for you.",1374796800,2,455,4.428571428571429
254996,5,6300216535,I love this movie!  The performance of Donald Sutherland was unbelievably good.  This is a terrific movie based on a classic novel by Nathaniel West.,1374192000,,149,4.92

254999,2,6300216535,"First, the bias I bring to this little party:  I consider West's novel the greatest American novel of all time (so far).  Thus when this movie first came out, I was full of anticipation...and was disappointed.  Seeing it again years later, I'm even more disappointed.  This movie version just doesn't have the snap and impact of the book.  Of course there are some good things here:  namely, the acting.  But the main problem always has been that Schlesinger just didn't seem to have any vision of how to translate this for the screen, and probably was the wrong director for this vehicle all along.  The bitter pettiness of American life which attains a kind of small grandeur in West's novel is just....petty...here. I'm not even sure that a great movie of this could have been made in the 1970s---but that's another discussion.  The actors tried mightily, but their attempts seem, overall, aimless, without that greater cinematic vision to hook into.  And Meredith's performance as a hammy old vaudevillian, the most praised part of the film at the time, seems merely hammy itself now.  The tragedy of a great cultural opportunity lost.  Is the emotional state of America similar enough to that of the Depression to try for a good remake of this now?",1364515200,,1253,4.830985915492958
255000,4,6300216535,Had to watch the movie for a school project. It was pretty interesting with twisted characters. It was a bit long for me. The quality of the picture was poor but I assume that is because it is an old movie. I am not sure if the newer movies have better picture quality since this was the first time I had to use amazon for streaming videos,1362528000,,339,4.074626865671642
255001,1,6300216535,"Are you in just too darned good a mood? So good that you feel as if you're about to explode with happiness, possibly injuring innocent bystanders? Do you believe that folks who pay attention to ""celebrities"" - especially those whose claim to fame revolves around the induction of massive amounts of plastic-like substances into their mammary glands and their willingness to be available to photographers pretty much 24/7 - are brain-dead and also nuts?

Well, watch this movie and your little happiness problem will be instantly taken care of, and your nasty suspicions about celebrity-worshipers will be confirmed. I mean TOTALLY confirmed.

This movie is the biggest, creepiest downer I've seen in years. It's full of '70s artsy-gloomy portent, characters straight out of a looney bin, and a wandering script that never really goes anywhere. I had to fast-forward through the middle half of the movie because I'd had enough of watching all the drawn-out, pretentious nonsense. A little pretentious nonsense I can take. Two solid hours is just too much.

If you're going to watch this movie, I suggest you do what I did. Dip your toe in the pool by watching the first half-hour to 45 minutes. That'll give you a real good idea of what you're in for. Then skip to the end, say the last 10 minutes. It's a real doozy. But not in a fun way. I felt like I needed to watch about 60 zillion episodes of the old TV show ""Cheers"" or go to the Ice Capades after watching this movie.

One thing I did not feel like doing was attending a Hollywood movie premiere. Watch the movie's last 10 minutes. You'll see...",1356393600,,1602,4.710714285714285
255002,5,6300216535,"From the first time I watched this on television years ago, and my jaw dropped upon seeing the ending scenes starting with the HollyWood premier and the insanity that ensues I still can't believe they made such a film. It's artistic, it's frustrating regarding the characters which are all very strong and memorable, but the way the story plays out and is filmed is unique. The cinematography is nice, and beautifully imagined when married with certain soundtrack sequences. I only wish it was on Blu-ray. The real Homer Simpson.",1340064000,,529,4.955056179775281
255003,3,6300216535,"The story behind `The Day of the Locust' is actually quite impressive and it has its moments of sheer terror (of a more matured and realistic nature) that it's a shame it was diminished by some horrible acting and misguided direction.

The raunch of the 30's was far different from the filth of today, and so the idea of watching that sweaty, lusty side of old Hollywood is rather enticing.  It has this quality of seduction that is lost in today's abundance of promiscuity.  `The Day of the Locust' centers on an aspiring actress named Faye who is lost in her own ambitions.  She desires to be famous, but she lusts after trouble at every corner.  An art director named Tod falls for her charms, but he is quickly introduced to her flamboyant sexuality and her tendency to change bed partners on a whim.  She uses her cunning to attach herself to a wealthy simpleton named Homer who moves in nearby.  Tod is beside himself, for he loves her and yet he loathes her at the same time.

The supporting players here are all really, really well crafted.  Burgess Meredith, who received an Oscar nomination, is certainly best in show.  As Faye's overworked father Harry, Meredith exudes charisma even on his deathbed.  He steals every scene, but he isn't all gimmicks.  The faith healer scene alone shows the emotional depth he brings to this character.  Donald Sutherland is also top notch here, playing a very different character than one is used to seeing from him.  He is emotionally crippled, fragile and cowardly.  He reclines at the first sign of antagonism and he is easily trampled, and Sutherland sells us on every note.  This all culminates into a ferocious final act, which serves as the film's most impressive scene and certainly the moral crux of the preceding.  I was also really impressed by Billy Barty.  His tough as nails approach to the dwarf neighbor was certainly a standout.

Sadly, this greatness did not trickle up to the more visibly important aspects of the film.

Karen Black is horrible here.  She is so all over the place and loses any of the characters intimacy because she can't manage to rein in the crazy long enough to create a realistic portrayal of a lost soul.  Instead, Black comes off as a bad actress attempting to resemble a bad actress.  I also blame Schlesinger for a lot of this because his direction was so narrow-minded.  He couldn't see past the sex long enough to build a complete character.  The constant close ups of sweaty mouths engulfing clear liquid booze was nauseating, not stimulating, and instead of giving his characters depth it merely made them feel disposable.

Meh.

At the end of the day, there is enough here (the sets, the supporting cast, the poignancy of the script) to constitute this a must see, sort of, but the detractors, while few, are huge aspects of the film and really drag this down quite a few notches.

Oh, what this could have been.",1337558400,2,2908,4.682445759368837
255004,5,6300216535,"I had seen this movie many years ago and it had made a definite impression.  Watching it again was enjoyable, but also very uncomfortable.  Can't imagine what was going on in my life the first viewing, but something that mad me very sad.  The movie, of course, if not very cheery either.",1320192000,,287,4.480769230769231

255037,5,6300216535,"The cynical novel, The Day of the Locust, was brought to the screen by John Schlesinger and Schlesinger retains all the dark motives and lost dreams of Nathaniel West's brilliant short novel. And where might the land of dark motives and lost dreams be? Why in Hollywood of course and this film captures the decadence which can only be called joyless and the ambitions which can only be called unfulfilled. This film from the mid 1970s is still somewhat shocking with its violent dwarf, its child actor-hermaphrodite pest, a legion of call girls, outlawed rooster fights, and a drunken party complete with a handsome Mexican fellow running around nude. William Atherton plays Todd Hackett; a Yale educated artists trying to break into the world of set design for the motion pictures. His drawings and paintings are inspired by Goya, a fitting image maker for this story. Todd gradually becomes noticed by producer Claude Estee, played as a cool sophisticated consumer of decadence and power by Richard Dysart. However, it is Karen Black who delivers the best performance of her career as Faye Greener, the blond starlet who clings to her virginity until the price is right and makes a career to giving double messages to every man she meets. She perfectly combines yes and no, come here and go away. The entire cast is outstanding with Burgess Meredith playing Faye's elderly father, a career drunk who was once hot in vaudeville. Donald Sutherland plays Homer, a mysterious non-personality who is abused to the breaking point by Faye. Geraldine Page plays a faith healer, Bo Hopkins plays a love struck cowboy who follows Faye like a puppy, Bill Barty plays a dwarf actor full of hostility and hatred, and Pepe Serna plays a Mexican drifter who makes his living fighting roosters. The strength of the film is the excellent manner in which it portrays the gradual fall from hope to despair and from decadence to horror. The much written about final riot scenes are odd but pull together the images of chaos and horror that have permeated the film from the beginning. The title should give us a hint, the mindless insects strip and destroy until all that is left is barren.",1291075200,7,2171,4.8544474393531

255043,3,6300216535,"The nuanced performances of Sutherland, Meredith, Black -- and an exceptional little Jackie Haley as an androgynous child star -- are the true reasons to invest your time in this classic. Too little story to justify its length of 2hrs and 24mins, but it looks great, has stellar moments, captures the period of 1930's Hollywood most extraordinarily, and has an almost surreal and disturbing conclusion that will make you glad you labored-through to it. I too likened it to ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?"" - though I found TSHDT? an overall much more satisfying cinematic experience.",1244764800,,583,5.083333333333333
255044,4,6300216535,"This film is a tightrope act which mostly succeeds.  Nathaniel West's novel is an original meld of sardonic satire and touching emotional realism about working stiffs in Hollywood of the Depression era.  Various men revolve around the orbit of a beautiful but empty minor starlet, superbly brought to life by Karen Black.  The social realism is gritty, buoyed by the surreal atmosphere of Hollywood fakery and weirdness.  It all works toward an apocalyptic conclusion, as the social chaos of the era, just barely under the surface, erupts in the finale.

The film is extremely well directed, superbly photographed, has a first rate period sountrack, and several fine performances.  But West's tightrope act on the written page is uncannily resistant to replication, apparently.  The film's end, while generally faithful to the book, edges too far into surrealism and leaves one wondering what happened to one of the main characters, Todd.  The end of the novel, to the contrary, is hard edged realism.  The film is such a first rate slice of life, however, that it is not wholly spoiled.

255045,4,6300216535,"[This review is part of my 31 Days of Hallowen series.]

I first saw this movie an aeon ago after reading the book. I don't think I appreciated it so much back then--but I do now. In order to really appreciate the ending, I suggest not reading the book first (if you haven't already.)

One of the reasons I appreciate the film more today is that at the time of the initial viewing, I hadn't seen Karen Black's work as an actor. In hindsight now I can really appreciate what a great actress she is. The horror/suspense movies she participated in during the 70's earned her the position of (at least) Princess of Horror (Betty Davis being the Queen--deserving the title for Whatever Happened to Baby Jane?--not to mention the string of B Horror Flicks she is also remembered for.)

The movie is all about the decadence of Hollywood--and it was pretty damn decadent--much more so than today. People didn't bother to go to rehab in those days & the studios controlled the media (Elsa Maxwell & Hedda Harper were to change all that in the 40's & 50's--and the 60's gave rise to the paparazzi.)

The characters include producers, writers, actors...and all the people who catered to their every need & whim. There's even a group of Mexican toughs who run an illegal chicken fight racket. It looked to me that this particular scene was for real--and it was pretty darn graphic. It did ""artistically"" fit into the plot--and the movie was made prior to any humane oversight--but I can't defend the nauseating inclusion in the film. It is what it is & I closed my eyes--and deducted a star in response.

Burgess Meredith turns in an outstanding performance as Black's door-to-door salesman/vaudevillian father. This is one of the few times I've actually seen Meredith's full stature in a movie & it came as a surprise to me to see how short he was (and I'm not confusing him with the actor Billy Barty who actually is a midget--and is powerful in this film.) One of the most striking scenes in the movie is Meredith's funeral. The wax like figure in the casket is such a shocking contrast to Meredith's almost maniacal portrayal of the living person. Even in death the character makes a rather frightening statement.

Donald Sutherland plays Homer Simpson (that's right, namesake of The Simpson's dad--and the similarity ends there.) His character is so bottled up & repressed, that it's gotta break out--and it does in an incident of graphic homicide.

The most striking scene for me is the one where Karen Black's aspiring actress character is arguing with her father over something--it really doesn't matter what. The full damaged, schizophrenic nature of her character comes into play: She simultaneously shakes her boobs at her father, cries, screams and laughingly leers. It is a grotesque display of a woman coming apart at the seams--and Karen Black plays it to the hilt.

This film is definitely NOT for the kiddies.

Here's a little tip: Keep your eyes on the gender-bending, professional ""child"" actor.

I will not give the ending away--I just couldn't be that cruel.

If the viewer doesn't expect a slavish version of the book, LOCUST holds many pleasures.  The acting's marvellous (has a performer ever been more bravely and cruelly exposed than Karen Black as Faye?), and Schlesinger found a style unlike his other films, a sort of acrid romanticism that isn't West's surrealism, but packs a punch nonetheless.

It had always stayed with me (especially the climax, one of the greatest in cinema history), and upon seeing it again, it is even sadder, more depressing, and nihilistic than before.

There is a surreal tinge to this film that explodes at the climax, one of the most amazing in cinematic history.

255106,1,6300216535,"It's a truism that great novels make lousy movies. For evidence of that fact, you need look no further.

As the great Hollywood novel (at least there's no convincing competitor), it was inevitable that ""Day of the Locust"" would hit the screen eventually. And when the time came, some effort was made to ensure the job was done right, beginning with the selection of the director, John Schlesinger, a literate British expatriate with a superb track record. But the 70s was the epoch of good intentions gone awry, in film as in everything else.

""Locust"" was made during the period when many people considered William Atherton to be an actor. You can see him in a number of major films, his expression never changing, with all the emotional impact of a log. It's one of those things that lends conviction to the claim that the industry runs on herd instinct.

But it's not all Atherton's fault, because nobody comes to life in this flick. Not even Karen Black, one of the most idiosyncratic actresses ever, for all that she's playing a hooker (Karen must have gotten very tired of that kind of role). Not even old pro Burgess Meredith, as her deadbeat old man. Donald Sutherland reveals a flicker or two, for all that he's supposed to be playing a lump. The sole exception is Jackie Earle Haley, who portrays the evil-minded child actor Adore with truly demonic intensity. Maybe they should have let him direct.

It would seem difficult to make scenes like the collapse of a huge Napoleonic war set or an illegal cockfight look dull, but Sclesinger brings it off. I don't know how -- this is, after all, the guy who made the selection of a new wardrobe for Cold War traitor Guy Burgess look enlightening and entertaining in ""An Englishman Abroad"". Maybe the milieu overwhelmed him. It's happened to other people.

It all comes to a head at the climax, which is supposed to illuminate an apocalyptic painting of the destruction of LA by Atherton's Todd. In a single truly effective scene, the distraught Homer Simpson murders the noxious child actor Adore. And then...

Well, if you want to see the dullest riot scene in film history, here you are. It's as if Schlesinger said, ""Okay, this the 30s, and there were Nazis around during the 30s -- so let's make the rioters Nazis!"" Thus we get a lengthy sequence in which people wearing very silly masks (they look like a chorus of Leatherfaces from ""Texas Chainsaw Massacre"") stand in one spot goose-stepping. Every now and then the camera shifts to a masked woman staring through a car windshield. And that's your riot.

To top things off, Schlesinger then gives us a ""symbolic"" coda that succeeds only in casting into doubt everything we've seen for the past two hours.

Nathanael West had an unbelievably tough career as an author. His publisher went bankrupt a week before ""Miss Lonelyhearts"" was due to be published. He died in a car crash only a short time after ""Locust"" appeared. Then they went and made this movie.

John Schlesinger has delivered an amazing slice of life in Hollywood with this film. Instead of the current trend in cinema where gung-ho directors rush their audience towards a climax by throwing a dozen or so more in along the way, Schlesinger takes his time & allows us to get to know this strange, eclectic group intimately before unleashing the gobsmacking climax.

""Locust"" is a particularly corrosive portrait of 30's Hollywood based on the Nathaniel West novel. A young artist (William Atherton) comes to Hollywood and finds success as a scenarist for Paramount. He watches as people sell their souls for the Dream (whatever it is to them) and finally sees Hollywood turn into Hell. ""Day of the Locust"" won Oscars for Burgess Meredith (as a washed up vaudvillian) and the cinematography. But I thought John Schlesinger should have won for director as well. He paints such a nightmarish picture of a debauched and decadent 1930's Hollywood that you can almost smell and taste it. Donald Sutherland also should have won for his portrayel of Homer Simpson (yes, that's the name), a frighteningly insecure simpleton who becomes Karen Black's benefactor and lives to regret it. He's also the catalyst for the horrifying climax. Black is excellent as Faye Greener (the daughter of Meredith's character)---a callous, hopelessly star struck extra in films using anyone to get ahead...or to just buy her a Dream. Many familiar faces populate the film including Natalie Schafer as a Madam, Geraldine Page as Big Sister (an Aimee McPherson type evangelist), 70's disco artist Paul Jabara as a drag entertainer performing the Dietrich song ""Hot Voodoo"" and Billy Barty as...a midget. Atherton is superb as the artist and should have been a bigger star after this. Many disturbing images are here including a disgusting cock fight and the brutal murder of a child but even these upsetting scenes contribute to the fabric of the film...their impact is intentional.

255115,5,6300216535,"If you are an avid movie fan, then you probably know how it is to no longer have the ability to be tremendously affected by great movies, although you can still recognize their greatness. An example would be All About Eve. I have overwhelming respect for this film, but it has always left me relatively unmoved. Another example would be Dogville. I definitely could not bring myself to say that about The Day of the Locust, which is a massive artistic achievement, which speaks the truth, and speaks it directly to the heart. Truth is so rare today that when it hits you, it hits hard, and that is exactly what this film has to offer.
The Day of the Locust is inherently ambitious, and that is commendable regardless of how effective the final piece is. It is fortunate that all the artistic elements combined so seemlessly and movingly. The film, although it may not be readily apparent, is extremely well casted. Karen Black gives a career-best performance as Faye Greener, a creature so messed up inside that it is easy to love her in spite of her flaws, and that was just the mistake Todd (Donald Sutherland) made. In an ideal world, people meet and fall in love.  But this is the dark, seamy, loveless side of Hollywood and the ability to love is all but forgotten (one could see parallels in our world today, that our world has in fact fallen prey to these loveless creatures, making the film ever more relavent), except in the heart of Todd who seems to be the hero of this rather tragic film.
There are many, many moments and lines that will make a kind of jarring imprint on your memory. One of the most horrific, nightmarish scenes occurs at the end of the film, when Faye is finally burned from Todd's memory forever, but, as we soon find, that loss is not too much of a bother for Faye...and that may just be the one great flaw of her character, and of Hollywood. There are no emotional attachments. There is no sincerity or truth. It is an illusion, a fantasy. Faye's heart was part of the illusion, for where it should have been was just empty space, compensated by an appearance that was all flashy and tinsel.
Sorry that is the best I can do to describe a film that defies accurate description or criticism--masterpieces always do, except by masterful writers. The DVD quality?  Well, there are no extra features to speak of, but for the price I am very satisfied. The picture and sound quality are both excellent, and that is all that really matters.

255136,3,6300216535,"Well, it is finally out! After years of habitual checking (on-line and in the shops) and repeated requests to the studio to release this on DVD, I picked up an advance copy of this DVD just yesterday (about 4 days before the official release). So, I figured that I should review it for those of you who will be purchasing it as soon as it is out.

By the way, I ran into Donald Sutherland here in NY a few months back and told him about how this is one of my all time favorite movies; he was taken aback that people remembered the movie and was glad to hear that a DVD release had been scheduled.

Here it goes....

I will not repeat what I and other fans of the movie think of it (you can read some of the other reviews below). Suffice it to say that it is a favorite of mine for both the story-line and its faithfulness to the the book from which it was inspired (written by Nathanael West, it is a Great Gatsby-esque tale set in 1930s Hollywood with a serious and foreboding message regarding celebrity culture and mob-mentality frenzy). I will concentrate on the DVD edition's quality and such.

Firstly, the picture quality is very average (in fact disappointing for DVD). Obviously this is a budget transfer not a high-end digitally restored release. The picture is grainy. But then again, they are offering it for a pretty low price to start with (you get what you pay for).

This release reminds me of the much anticipated (and more disappointing) release of the movie ""1984"" - that release on DVD was in mono, without the celebrated Eurythmics soundtrack even though the back cover credited them!

This DVD release fares a bit better than 1984. At least you get a choice of Dolby 5.1 and restored non-surround sound audio. However, I found the volume to be somewhat low - it seems I have to turn the volume up higher than on other DVDs. You have a few choices of subtitles and that's about it. Besides a basic scene selection menu you have nothing else. No mini documentary, no behind the scenes tid-bits, no original movie trailer.

I have been pushing the folks at Criterion Collection to look into this move and think of doing one of their high quality releases but I don't know whether they have looked into it or not. Perhaps they were told by the studio to wait until after this budget release had come out and run its course before being given permission to do so.

So, this is my suggestion to those who have waited for this to come out on DVD: Buy it, it may not be perfect but at least it is on a better format than VHS and I think it is fairly priced.

Well, there were pluses, serious pluses: Burgess Meredith was a great Harry Greener; the cockfight scene was well-played; Karen Black was a good Faye Greener, except on those occasions when the director or script misguided the character into moments of sincerity.
And that misguidance highlights the weaknesses of the film. There is no sincerity in Hollywood; there is no reality beneath the plywood sets; if they collapse, there is nothing beneath: that is the tone of the West book. Hollywood is 99 & 44/100 percent image, and as such represents a human society which is likewise a combination of glitter, misdirection, and pointless desire. The book is a trip into existential despair. The movie fails to wallow deeply enough.
The other big disappointment -- well, more than a disappointment, is the filming of the concluding riot scene. The filming is too 70ish -- gore mixed with psychedelic flashing between scene and imagination. The horror thus communicated is an individual horror. It is strong (part of the scene made my spouse physically ill). It is not, however, universal and despairing. Subtlety and selection leaves a longer impression than spectacle (that, of course, is a lesson Hollywood never has learned; and that is part of West's story).
Overall, some very good moments, some good acting, but the tone does not quite do justice to West's book.",1074384000,8,1510,5.068273092369478
255140,5,6300216535,"the day of the locust is a fascinating look at the people who go to hollywood and don't make it. it is brilliantly directed by the great john schlesinger ( midnight cowboy) but it was hated by the hollywood community itself for showing the seamy side of hollywood. when the acadamy awards presented the nominations that year this film was nominated for only one category (burgess merideth in a supporting actor role). the movie was clearly snubbed because it dared to show hollywood in this light and what a horrible light indeed. witness the disaster that takes place on a stage set that collapses because of shody materials or the incredible ending thats is one of the most night marish sequences ever filmed. richard atherton whom i thought would be a super star after this role is great as the new comer to hollywood who wants to be a set designer. he falls for a ditzy blond played very well by karen black whos carachter is so despicable and hatefull that we don't wether to be sorry for her or just hate her. donald sutherland is magnificent as the shy almost retarded rich man who holds in so much of his hate that your just waiting for it to explode ( of course it does). each scene unfolds so brilliantly under the direction of schlesinger that i would recommend it alone as a directors training guide on "" how to direct a movie"". why this film is not on dvd is beyond me. the film is a dark,brooding sad and powerfull story on human failure and dreams that can go wrong. it reminds me of something eric von stroheim would have done. in fact it is very much like his silent masterpiece GREED filmed in 1924. i have this movie on vhs but i cant wait for a dvd",1055030400,15,1668,4.401294498381877

255142,5,6300216535,"Not many film adaptations of great novels are so eloquently realized as this. Clearly, Schlesinger and Waldo Salt strove to be true to their source. I've never been a big fan of Karen Black's and couldn't fathom the  reason for her success in 70's movies, but she turns in a workmanlike  performance in this film. She's still miscast, in my opinion. I would have  envisioned Faye Dunaway in the role, personally. Everyone else is perfect,  particularly Burgess Meredith, who delivers his swan song in the role of a  down-on-his luck huckster, who performs unitl he keels over (much like Red  Button's Sailor in ""They Shoot Horses, Don't They?). The cock fight is  nearly as memorable on film as it was in the novel. Yes, there really is a  character named Homer Simpson (Matt Groening obviously was a Nathaniel West  fan). Donald Sutherland, who turned in his best efforts in the 70's in my  opinion (Mash, Klute, etc) is wonderful as the catatonic Homer. I'm not  sure of the young actor's name who plays the obnoxious child star, but he  was absolutely brilliant (or Schlesinger elicited the perfect perfomance  from him - take your pick). The film, like the book, depicts the dark  underbelly of the Hollywood dream, the reality that so many who are lured  by notions of fame and riches ultimitately face. The only element the film  doesn't succeed in capturing is the storyline featuring the Mary Baker Eddy  evangalist character who represents all the false, utopian theology  California is famous for. She is one of the central figures that direct the  novel towards its apocalyptic climax. I can understand how such a subplot  would have been awkward for the screewriter, but it is an important element  to the overall plot and was not given the treatment it warranted. All in  all though, a faithful rendering, heartfelt and honest. It is another film  that one can not find in video stores, so it will remain neglected, while  an endless succession of tripe is snatched up by the viewing masses.",963532800,20,2004,4.826470588235294
255143,5,6300216535,"I've often wondered how accurately Hollywood portrays the desperation of those who seek to live in it's world.  I believe in most cases that there is a great deal of exaggeration used in order to drive a weak story.  I  didn't feel that way when I watched ""The Day of the Locust"".  I  felt extremely uncomfortable throughout most of this movie because I knew  within five minutes that this story wouldn't have a happy ending.  I  commend the great job that was done in casting this project because I can't  imagine anyone else other than Donald Sutherland and Karen Black playing  the roles of Homer Simpson and Faye Greener.  Burgess Meredith, Bo Hopkins,  and William Atherton also delivered strong supporting efforts.  This was a  very disturbing movie, and at times quite violent.  What has haunted me the  most about this film was how much emotional damage human beings will  inflict on those that are closest to them.  I recommend this movie, but be  prepared to maybe take the rest of the day off after you see it, cause  it'll wreck you for sure.",961804800,25,1054,4.655737704918033

255145,5,6300216535,"The Day of the Locust was made in the mid-seventies, a time where honesty and the nature of people was celebrated, unfortunately Hollywood did not want to celebrate this in itself--for I remember upon its release very  little publicity and marketing.  It was viewed as a major film but marketed  under a ""nostalgic entertainment"" with a big glossy poster.  In  reality it is probably the best movie ever made of the Hollywood movie  making machine, complete with extras never to be seen or heard from again,  set design flaws that may result in injury yet ones that go unreported, the  need for the studio bosses to socialize with the high life and the low  life.  All of it real, sad, exhilirating and ultimately tragic and  incomprehensible.  John Schlesigner's direction is superb, as is every  performance.  The pathetic ""Revival"" sequence will be  unforgettable to those who remember them.  So many gems onscreen, I hope it  gets a rebirth on DVD.",940118400,15,952,4.886792452830188
7806171,3,6300216535,"Movie 10 of 1975 and 31 overall in my journey through films of my lifetime.

I'm not sure what ""The Day of the Locust"" was or what it was trying to be but I liked it. I remember critics of ""Mulholland Drive"" saying these same words. Maybe that's what Hollywood does to people. It must be quite a dark business with the news coming out about Harvey Weinstein, old accusations of a homosexual mafia, and of course every movie that mimics it has very dark things to say. Is ""The Day of the Locust"" a mime? I think so and if so then a metaphor to be sure.
I'll take a little stab at interpretation here but I by no means think this is necessarily ""correct"" it is just my take. You can glean much about a culture by how it treats its children. They mimic us, they suffer our ills, they can be held up or put down by us easily. The creepy, androgynous, dancing, Shirley Temple look-a-like makes several appearances. We see her chastised for disobeying a director, actually she was being abused. This is common in Hollywood apparently. The dream of stardom and fortune is a specter for many child actors as others live out their fantasies and use them for personal gain. In ""The Day of the Locust"" the devil child uses the most trigger inducing song (not according to me but according to the movie) to start what I would consider the most daring ending to a movie that I have seen so far in this series. The child imitates what brings pain on the central characters. A very interesting character and the movie would have been less without it. So perhaps the movie is about how Hollywood uses people stirs them to a sort of madness. Almost all the characters go mad in the film.
I had to look up the cinematographer for this one because the film is so beautifully shot. A sight to behold really. If you have a 55 inch 4K system you should see it; this thing even looks great on DVD. The directing was also great.
I learned something about the use of dialog preceding this with ""The Man Who Would be King."" In ""The Day of the Locust"" dialog is in the moment. It's the character's feelings, hopes, and dreams. In ""The Man Who Would be King"" it is the story. It's the main vehicle for learning everything and nothing is shown without its ubiquitous presence. While it is certainly not spared in ""The Day of the Locust"" it is used more effectively to convey the emotions of the characters. I always thought wordy films were weak because a movie was supposed to show instead of tell. Well I guess that's not always true. Some movies tell too much but some do both great.
""The Day of the Locust"" has robust re-watchability. I want to see it again but really mine the finer details.
Another point I'd like to make is that there is a incredibly gruesome death scene. Better than any I have seen in my journey including ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre."" The reason for this is much is left to the imagination while showing fragments of horrific violence and gore. It is also satisfying in a very twisted way. For one character it's a lethargic release and for another they have it coming... Until it goes way too far. Absolutely awesome!
Finally a shout out to Burgess Meredith. Wow what a performance! I didn't know he had such range. I was impressed.
Pros
-expert direction
-all acting was wonderful
-beautifully filmed with no spared pennys either
-the little brat gets it in the end lol
-re-watchable
Cons
-the definition of melodrama. Today's movies actually mock the music for its attempt to move you
-a little slow at times

What year! I can't imagine that 1976 will be better but perhaps it will. The worst movie I saw was ""The Passenger."" I don't regret not being able to finish it. The best of the year was ""Farewell My Lovely."" I really wanted to put ""Dog Day Afternoon"" to honor it but I just couldn't, and I would have loved to put ""Three Days of the Condor"" but I didn't watch it because it didn't qualify as I had already seen it before this retrospective. Onto 76'. I have yet to see ""Taxi Driver."" A movie I have heard incredible things about my whole life. I hope I'm not disappointed.",1515974400,,4083,4.428191489361702
