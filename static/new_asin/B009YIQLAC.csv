8545235,1,B009YIQLAC,"I find this interesting because in an interview in 2008 with Time magazine, this man, Kyles, states ""And Martin was leaning over the balcony, not trying to shake hands, but leaning over talking to Jesse and Ben Branch. I stepped away, I started down the stairs. I said 'Guys, come on. We have a rally tonight, let's go.' I got about five or six steps and the shot rang out.""

Now he is stating that he was standing right next to Dr. King when he was shot. This seems contradictory when you look at the picture of the Lorraine Motel railing and the location of the staircase. They are not in close proximity.",1425254400,,607,4.371681415929204
