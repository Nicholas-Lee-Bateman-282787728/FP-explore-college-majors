8217879,5,B000009N3G,"I'm not going to review the quality of the VHS's on offer here, because I wasn't silly enough to fork out such ridiculous amounts of money on just a Video Tape - trust me this film is available on DVD for much much much less than is being offered here. I only mention this because this film is, in my opinion, worth searching elsewhere for the DVD.

For those who thought Lam Ching Ying's acting abilities was only as good as the next Hopping Vampire/Taoist Priest film should really get this movie, because I think it will not only surprise the hell out of you by just how good he is in this film, but it will also make you realise just how erroneously and stupidly typecasted he was as the Taoist Priest/Vampire Hunter.

I rarely get emotional during a foreign film, probably because the subtitles can distract me from getting into the film too much, however, not in this case. The subtitiles are wholly needed just so you get all the nuances of what is going on, but they do not stop you getting into the film and enjoying it, uinlike some others can for me.

This is a story of two cousins, Tung (played by Tony Leung Ka Fai) and Kong (played by Lam Ching Ying), who grow up in the same household. Kong is quiet, reserved and heavily into medicine, whilst Tung is studious but bored and agitated.

The beginning of the film sets up the gist of what is to follow, but the added twist two thirds of the way through the film borders on genius, in my opinion, because it is completely unexpected and explains such a lot. There is a lot going on in this film such as Chinese revolutions going on in the small towns where people are publicly beaten and humiliated, there is a subtle love-triangle and a Blood Demon about to make an entrance on Earth. Don't, I repeat *DON'T* be put off by the thought of a Blood Demon, because it seriously adds to the tension that steadily grows throughout the film - and the end of the film simply broke my heart, it was wonderfully acted and worked because you got to see the trials and tribulations that befall the two cousins and their love interest all the way through the film.

All in all, this is one stupendous film that anyone should own, but not at the ridiculous prices being asked for the VHS Tapes. Seriously, look around for the DVD of this film and buy it. I really don't think you'll be dispapointed.

Five stars for the film thus a high high high recommendation from me.",1271376000,,2420,4.378619153674833
