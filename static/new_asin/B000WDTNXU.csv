8222803,4,B000WDTNXU,"I was bored and running out of cash at the time. The only anime I didn't have that I could afford was Air Gear. Air Gear is a pretty good show. I was quite surprised. It's more of an anime about beating up street gangs who just happen to ride roller blades with electric motors in them. I used to ride roller blades in middle school but I never associated it with being tough. These guys and girls really stick it to each other.

The main character, Ikki, lives with a family of sisters. He is a delinquent in a street gang. One day he finds a pair of ""At's"" in one of his housemates rooms. The story is about him climbing to the top of the AT battle world with his friends.

This series has a lot to offer. It has action, comedy, drama, and a bit of romance. Not as much as Ikki would like though. The animation is good and so is the soundtrack. It has a different kind vibe to it. It's very pop culture oriented and there is a descent amount of fan service. My only complaint with this one is that the whole roller blade thing is kind of lame. It's a bit of a strange premise to base an anime on. Even though the series is pretty entertaining, I wouldn't call it extremely memorable. There are many more animes out that are way better. If you've seen everything else go ahead and watch Air Gear, but check it out on Netflix or Youtube before you drop $20 on it.",1354665600,,1363,4.120300751879699
8222804,5,B000WDTNXU,"ok...i love air gear the manga is amazing, and so was the anime until it ended. the anime is really good and the animation is done really well, but air gear has the worst ending EVER! the anime has a great plot, but it ends so suddenly (around volume 7 of the manga) Ikki never even gets the wind regalia, nothing happens between him and Ringo, its just kinda frustrating at the end. don't get me wrong. i definitely recommend air gear to any anime fan...just do both me and yourself a favor after you watch air gear vol. 6, continue to follow the story and read the manga or else youll feel like somethings missing.",1196467200,,616,4.318965517241379
