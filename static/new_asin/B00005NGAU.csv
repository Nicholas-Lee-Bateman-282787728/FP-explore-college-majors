1633668,2,B00005NGAU,"I'm a Norwegian myself, so naturally I had looked forward to Harald Zwart's Hollywood debut, ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL's, with high hopes and much anticipation. I'd seen some of Zwart's earlier works, like HAMILTON and the controversial music video for A-HA, and the fella did seem to be talented (albeit somewhat commercial). In addition to this, ONE NIGHT AT MCCOOL's fronted a strong cast (although I'm not Mat Dillon's number one fan) and a storyline that claimed to lend influence from Coen films (and you gotta love them Coen brothers). So my question is; Where did it all go wrong? Well, the film is just too unoriginal. The jokes are old. It's no longer funny seeing a fat police officer stand behind a cuffed man so that it would appear they're doing ""you know what"". It's been done to death. This is certainly the film's main problem. Another thing that didn't quite ""click"" for me was the performance of Liv Tyler. I find the notion of a film where the main character is not the center of narration, as quite intruiging, but Liv Tyler's character remains pretty much the same even though we view her from the perspectives of three different men. It would have been nice to see some traces of changes in her character. The ending is also not a lot to scream about ... So with all these things hampering the film, it doesn't really matter that the film fronts strong visuals (which is often the case when the director has a background doing music videos) and a gallery of what could have been interesting characters. There's just too much keeping this flower from blossoming.",1002931200,3,1578,4.679856115107913
1633669,2,B00005NGAU,"The funniest thing in this movie is Michael Douglas's hair.  The second funniest thing in the movie is watching Paul Reiser run down the street in a bizarre leather S&M getup.  The sad thing is, I can't even come up with a third funniest thing.
This is a discouraging comment about a comedy.
This is a strangely compelling movie though.  I gave it only two stars because comedies are supposed to make you laugh, and this one didn't, but something about it stuck with me.  I guess I identify with these guys who are being manipulated by a beautiful sex goddess.  And I do hang out at a bar eerily similar to McCools, albeit a much smaller bar.  I've met some sexy, manipulative women there too, now that I think about it.
If you're looking for a movie with any depth, or any soul, you won't find it here.  The movie tries to combine the best of the Farrelly brothers with the best of the Coen brothers and fails.  Such stunning mediocrity is depressing.",1002844800,,952,4.431034482758621
1633670,4,B00005NGAU,"""One Night at McCool's"" is reminiscient of Pulp Fiction and There's something about Mary>  ""Jewel"", played by the newly sexy Liv Tyler, is the woman there's something about.  Three men are all in love with Jewel, and they all have their own story to tell.  This is where the Pulp Fiction reminder comes in as there are three different subplots that all eventually lead up to something similar.
The movie starts with Randy, played by Matt Dillon, going to see Michael Douglas's character, play Bingo, and he tells Douglas his story. Douglas is a contract killer.
Paul Reiser goes to see a psychiatrist, played by country western singer, Reba Macintyre.  She is sporting an awful haircut, and in my opinion, should stick to her country western schtick.
John Goodman goes to see a priest/friend because he has something very important to tell him.
One night (all in the same night) at McCool's bar they all meet Jewel, and they all fall captive to her.
Jewel and her so-called ""boyfriend"" Utah, played by a somewhat unrecgonizible Andrew Dice Clay, are trying pull off robberies by getting a sympathetic character like Matt Dillon's Randy to allow Jewel into their homes so they can rob him.  Jewel falls for Randy, and suddenly wants out of the robbery  way of life, and gets it by shooting Utah right as he is about to rob McCool's bar, where Randy is the bartender.
She takes up with Randy and then takes over his house.  Paul Reiser is Randy's Lawyer cousin who develops a Walter Mitty like fantasy over Jewel, and eventually has an affair with her.  John Goodman is the suspicious police detective that gets involved with the murder cases. Yes, there is more than one.
It took a little while for this movie to get going. It was a little boring in the beginning, and then as more characters were introduced, I became more interested.  It's very funny and the ending totally took me by surprise.  I was very surprised at this little movie, which left the theaters quite quickly.  It's worth the rental fee.",1002758400,2,2006,4.702857142857143
1633671,5,B00005NGAU,i loved this movie.  it was like 1999s theres something about mary but much crazier. the end was copying theres something about mary all the charectors showed up. i loved liuv tyler in this movie cause she had a perfect fit for her charector. matt dillon also theres something about mary plays a bartender that thinks he saves livs charector but he doesnt know the scheme until after he has sex with her.,1002672000,3,404,4.534246575342466
1633672,1,B00005NGAU,"Big waste of time for all the talent involved here. Liv Tyler gives a very sexy performance in the best tradition of film noir goddesses as a double-crossing vixen who always gets her way. Paul Reiser, Matt Dillon and John Goodman are the seemingly innocent men who cross her path and fall instantly for her. The plot weaves and weaves like a spider spinning a very complicated web, convincing you that it will end up in a very clever and surprising way. However, a very violent and simplistic ending that seems to have been written by a grade-schooler is the outcome, leaving the audience angry for having been cheated into such an empty experience. It is, however, the first film I've ever seen to mention the inherent value of a DVD player. Michael Douglas (who also co-produced) absolutely steals the show as the hired hit man with a walking carpet on his head.",1001894400,3,865,4.660130718954249

1633675,1,B00005NGAU,"""McCools"" was a rubbish movie, weak in every department, and one of the poorest films I have ever seen. It would seem that the producers were undecided as to whether they were making a porn film or a screwball comedy, and succeeded in doing neither. Their only gameplan was to finish the film with a spoof on The Village People; what an awful lot of effort for one joke!
I had only gone to see the film because I am a fan of Reba McEntire, not knowing what to expect. In common with the ethos behind the production, her role as a confessor figure to Paul Reisner, was irrelevant and utterly superfluous. After she had spent a couple of days filming her short sequences, she was called back for post-production work and as a consequence had to cancel some scheduled concerts - what a waste of time!
Judging from the length of time they took to release the film, the producers probably realised that they had produced a turkey.",993945600,,925,4.479289940828402
1633676,3,B00005NGAU,"This movie had some flashy trailers, but it's not just about sex, it is focused on a very innovative story. The story is about one bar tender, an attorney, and a cop, all been seduced by a pretty angel who turned into demon. They each went to a helper to tell them their story with that girl. Those three stories is actually one story, but told from three view points. This idea was very interesting, but the three stories were not very even, especially at the beginning, and didn't reach their full potential. But the ending was very good.
The three actors did a terrific job, while Liv Tyler was just OK. This movie had many fun moments, though at the begginning I felt the movie was going too slow. Anyway, don't buy it if you just wanted to watch the girl.",988502400,,760,4.359154929577465

1633704,3,B00005NGAU,"I remember this movie from long ago. I remember it being funny, with comic twists. Fast forward to July, 2015. A few moments of chuckles, other wise lame and moronic. Dillon does well as the blue collar loser, the reason I bought the movie. Tyler was seductive, but it was far fetched. To my modern eyes, Goodman seems miscast. The one character I did like, but had no memory of, was the bingo caller girl.
This was filmed back in the day when smoking was done everywhere.
The scenes of the little lawyer, his house and death could have been completely eliminated, and would not affect the movie at all.

1633763,4,B00005NGAU,"Hee hee.  This movie is totally dumb and fun with a lot of good dumb action.  My boyfriend is in love with Liv Tyler, but that's okay because water is my second favorite thing too.  Paul Rieser is the second best actor.  Andrew Dice Clay as the killer mormon is absolutely hilarious.  Maybe super slut gets some credit for wearing not enough clothes, but if you were built like her, I guess I'd walk around half naked all the time too.  What I liked about her character is even though she's evil, she's also really smart.  She wraps every guys around her finger like a mastermind to get what she wants and she does show some mercy too, so she's not totally evil.  The ending pays off all of the storylines perfectly.  For a low budget goof-off, this is a really good movie.",1334966400,,773,4.34965034965035
1633764,5,B00005NGAU,The first time I saw this I laughed the whole way through and loved it.......but I missed the whole point of the view through each guy's eyes.  Therefore the view through Paul Reeser's eyes (his wife and the Liv Ullman character) totally went over my little head.  Next time it all made sense and it was even funnier.  Reba Mcyntire as the psychologist was a hoot and the ending is perfect.  I've never respected Michael Douglas as much as when he played that part.  One of my favorites.,1314835200,7,487,4.488636363636363
1633765,3,B00005NGAU,"I see the average rating for this is 3 1/2 stars, which is probably what I would give it if I could use 1/2 stars. First of all, if you are a Liv Tyler, Matt Dillon, John Goodman, or Paul Reiser fan, you should watch this, no question. They all have great parts. I like the way this recaps events from several characters' points of view. Sometimes amusing, but also maybe a bit of a lesson can be learned, even from a film like this one, which is certainly not intended to teach anything. There are some fairly explicit sexually oriented scenes in this film, and some pretty graphic violence. NOT for the squeamish. There is humor throughout, and one bit at the end which should go down in history as one of the simplest, yet funniest, exterminations of an annoying character, ever.",1308009600,,782,4.475524475524476
1633766,1,B00005NGAU,"The mystery is why in the world would Michael Douglas want to be one of the producers and appear in this awful movie. Yes, Liv is gorgeous but that doesn't justify wasting a couple of hours on this. Watch it on TV, don't rent or buy it.",1302912000,,236,4.042553191489362
1633767,4,B00005NGAU,"I just watched this movie for the first time and had been engaged in a low-level struggle to finish it.  I like Goodman and Douglas and they, more than the others, OK ""Jewel"" (Tyler) provided numerous watchable moments, kept me committed to the end.  Then, in about the last 10 minutes, unlike the editorial review, the movie ""hits full speed"" and I'm right there with the characters.  The ending was a wonderful and a shockingly funny surprise that linked up with an earlier comment in the movie by Reiser, but off just enough to avoid clichd predictability and that ending started me laughing for about 20 minutes.  I liked Tyler's sensitive choice at the end regarding Dillon's character.

What a delight!  Why the hell isn't it out on DVD, or is it?  Tyler played her role well and after I stopped laughing, I wanted to believe the McCool's had followed the movie, Falling Down and Douglas' character in that movie.  I so wanted to imagine that his character, Mr. Burmeister in McCool's was a reprise, with a vengeance, of William 'D-Fens' Foster in Falling Down.  The makeup of the two characters seemed similar to me, but the ""character"" of Burmeister was a great counterpoint to that of Foster.  The ending of this film definitely justifies the time spent.

I must disagree with Roger Ebert's comment at the time that the film ""is so busy with its crosscut structure and its interlocking stories that it never really gives us anyone to identify with.""  By the end of the movie, there is plenty of character with which to identify and the ""crosscut structure and interlocking stories"" are a easy gig for today's multi-taskers.

A minor annoyance in the film was that they could have let the song at the end of the movie play out a bit longer to help retain the feeling.  Finally, I was gratified to learn that Tyler's first name, Liv was chosen from Liv Ullmann, regardless of the apparent frivolous circumstance that led to the choice.",1289001600,4,1942,4.707100591715976

1633790,4,B00005NGAU,"One Night at McCool's is a dark comedy that is pretty darn entertaining. Maybe it is just one long set up for a Village People gag, but it's fun to stay at the YMCA. They have assembled a very interesting cast, and everyone contributes, making the whole equal to more than the sum of its parts. The story is told like a Faulkner novel, from multiple viewpoints. It's Rashamon Time, as Randy the bartender (Matt Dillon); his cousin, the lawyer Carl Harding (Paul Reiser); and grieving widower Detective Dehling (John Goodman), all tell different versions of the events that happened One Night at McCool's. Each of the men have someone to tell their story to: Carl tells Dr. Green (Reba McEntire), Dehling tells Father Jimmy (Richard Jenkins), and Randy tells Mr. Burmeister (Michael Douglas), the hitman he has hired to take care of his ""problem.""

Randy's problem is Jewel Valentine (Liv Tyler), the woman he encountered One Night at McCool's. She has driven him, along with Carl and Detective Dehling, stark raving crazy. All she really wants is to have a nice house full of nice furniture and things, but what won't she do to get them? Or, what won't she make the men do?

Liv Tyler is well cast as a woman with the the power to drive men wild. She has a certain charisma, but at the same time she's kind of a dork. See Stealing Beauty for further evidence of her beautiful brand of dorkiness. Paul Reiser was best known for the sit com, ""Mad About You,"" but One Night at McCool's gives him the opportunity to stretch his comedic envelope. Richard Jenkins, as Father Jimmy, turns in yet another brilliant character actor turn. He has finally gotten some recognition with an Oscar nomination for ""The Visitor."" As the lead, not supporting, Jack. John Goodman is a good man, Matt Dillon is always willin' to go that extra mile, and Michael Douglas is a hit as the hitman. And did I mention Andrew 'Dice' Clay in not one but two roles? Fugedaboutit! Four cast members have appeared in films with Kevin Bacon. All this, and the best use of a snowglobe as metaphor since Citizen Kane?

Even more surprisingly, I found this fabulous film in my local Wal-Mart's $5.50 bin. Their low, low prices were my big, big DVD collection gain, as this is one movie I will never part with. The story revolves around 3 men's recounting of one night at McCool's, the local bar, where they each become smitten with a beautiful young woman named Jewel (Liv Tyler). But she's not as sweet and innocent as she looks. She knows how to play each of them to get exactly what she wants. Matt Dillon as the bartender, Paul Reiser as the lawyer and John Goodman as the cop all get in over their heads with Jewel. It's fun to watch this whole thing unfold before your eyes and the end includes a very interesting scene you definitely don't expect which makes this movie all the more fun. Great for those of us who hate sappy romantic flicks, this is perfect for those of us who can see right through that supposed love at first sight hooey.

But, who really makes the film great was the gorgeous femme fatale, Liv Tyler.  I've loved her in many films.  She's got this natural trashy demeanor that is just so sexy.  The kind of girl you'd hope to meet if you had to walk through some delapitated trailer park, and she happens to be sitting on her porch looking for any guy who just happens to walk by.

She's got such a convincing innocent look on her face while her intentions are devious as ever.  That's the magic of this film's appeal.  No one else could have played this part better than her.  Well, maybe Marisa Tomei.

She ended up entering into the lives of three unsuspecting guys, and tears their heart's apart.  Well, actually about six guys, but the main focus is on just the three.  And all she wanted in the end was just a roof over her head, and a DVD player.

My new sharper imaging 32"" LCD HDTV really helps add to the detailed appearance of how ugly and run-down Matt Dillon's old house looks on the outside.  This contributes to putting some art into this film.  Plus, Liv Tyler's trashy dresses throughout the film.

Now tell me, what guy hasn't been hypnotized or smittened by at least one woman in his life? I mean there's something about a woman that has this power over a man and, if she knows how to use that power, things could get awfully wild. I laughed at the realism in this movie.

No man can resist her heavenly beauty and her devilish charms..Not the gullible Matt Dillon,the chivalrous and religious John Goodman, the kinky and pretentious Paul Reiser, nor the cold and professional killer Michael Douglas..They are all consumed by this beauty and pay dearly for it, in what in my opinion is one the freshest and funniest film I have seen in a while.
The script is witty and the acting top class: John Goodman for once not going over the top,Matt Dillon showing great comic potential again after There is Something About Mary, and Richard Jenkins playing the priest and Goodmans's confessor is a great surprise and his scenes though short are great

One was a lawyer, another a bartender, another a policeman, and last but not least, an assassin.  Viewers were given flashbacks of how the male characters' lives were manipulated by the vixen so as to serve her purpose, & somehow or rather, their lives crossed path.  Along the way, people were murdered, possessions got stolen, the guilty was out on the loose, people dressed in ""Village People"" outfits running around, etc.  Naturally, there was this climatic showdown where there was going to be a resolve.

Well, the result will be something like ONE NIGHT AT McCOOL's.  As with any mixed drink of this sort, you may not get what you expect, but you'll leave the bar happy.
If ever there were such a thing as a dark romantic comedy, this would be it.  If you think you're getting another couples-friendly run-of-the-mill romantic comedy, you're wrong.  Whether that is good or bad depends on the viewer.
 The movie features an all-star cast that includes Matt Dillon, Michael Douglas, Paul Reiser and John Goodman.  However, the performance that carries the film is that of Liv Tyler as the gorgeous femme fatal who is bad news for everyone.  Not only does she possess the physical assets to pull off the part, but she is a bona-fide good actress on top of that.  The car wash scene by itself is worth the modest price of the DVD.
The best reason to buy this flick is that it is utterly hilarious.  The way it hits on every man's fantasy will be appealing to male viewers, while the fact that it at the same time mocks these fantasies will be something women will find amusing.  The film finds humor in rather bizarre situations, but it will nonetheless leave you in stitches.
So, with this in mind, go out and spend a night at McCool's.  Stick around awhile and enjoy your drink - it all goes down smooth.

Jewel's second favourite thing in the world is water. Numero Uno is, not surprisingly; doing the WILD THANG!! The motives of the men (played by John Goodman, Matt Dillon and Paul Reiser) for pursuing Jewel are varied. See if you can match up the reason with the actor. 1 guy is a cop and knows she's a thief, another is in it for the nookie and the last guy worships the ground Jewel walks on, sad fool that he is. You don't have to be a brain surgeon to figure it out. Despite a good cast ONE NIGHT AT McCOOLS is very repetitive and tiresome, which is sad, because Michael Douglas is excellent as usual and also co-produced the movie. As for Liv Tyler, she has never been hotter, but she keeps her bra on during the sex scenes. I hate that. It's totally unrealistic. Her dress is so tight it's amazing that her boobs don't pop out. And this movie is so predictable and obvious that it's unbelievable that the viewer's brain doesn't start leaking out of his/her ears.

The makers of this film could have done much, much worse. When you have Liv Tyler, you could just show her for 90 minutes reading newspaper, ironing clothes or walking around and hundreds of thousands of males would watch this happily time after time. Well, they have done much more than that. The plot is good, dialogue is strong (although comedy charge is at times flagging), and actors are really pulling their weight.
Michael Douglas, who has a tiny role in this film, is exceptionally good and frankly this is his best appearance since Wall Street.
I liked this movie. It is no cinematic ground-breaker and perhaps too humble a vehicle for obviously maturing talent of Liv Tyler, but nevertheless very, very enjoyable.",1029024000,2,1344,4.651260504201681

1633823,3,B00005NGAU,"I really didn't expect to like this movie because of the previews-- Liv Tyler spraying water all over herself ala a soft core porn flick (or an Aerosmith video!).  I thought the movie would be based around Liv being an evil temptress who uses her good looks and sexuality to manipulate men into committing murders and other crimes.  I was wrong though, the previews tell you nothing about the movie at all.  So, in the end, I was pleasantly surprised and I gained some respect for Liv's acting ability.
  The story revolves around Liv's character, Jewel Valentine, and is told from three different points of view: Randy the bartender (Matt Dillon), Carl the lawyer (Paul Reiser), and detective Dehling (John Goodman).  All three men get mixed up with Jewel after a robbery goes wrong at Randy's bar (McCool's) and the movie is comprised of the 3 men telling about their involvement with her to a hit man, a shrink, and a priest (respectively).  It all started....one night at McCool's.
  I can't say too much about the plot because it is too complicated for a non-spoiler summary...you'll just have to see it.  The film was fun to watch because of the whole story telling thing going on between the 3 men and the listeners (the hit man, the psychologist, and the priest)...each guy has a skewed memory and it's interesting to see how they all recall events a little differently.  There are lots of flashbacks in the film, when the men are remembering things about Jewel, and each guy makes her out to be way sexier than she really was...she was sexy, but the guys remember her as being this oozing sex bucket (which is kinda funny).
Recommendation:  This movie was entertaining, it had a lot of big laughs, and it was interesting because the story was told from three different points of view.  Girls will like it because it makes fun of the way men think (it's funny to see the way the men confused their fantasy with reality and made Liv extra sexy in their heads) and guys will like it because Liv Tyler is gorgeous and she has some really sexy scenes (which, again, were actually the fantasies of the men involved in the story).",1020124800,,2132,4.623342175066313

Hottie Tyler comes to jerkwater town running a con and ruins the lives of five men, four who end up dead.  This is all in the name of attaining a house that in her words could be featured in a magazine, but this dream is in reality just [an] enclave of bad taste, like when hillbillies rob an armored car.  In the end, she prances off unscathed and oblivious to the lives she's ruined. Paul Riser is contemptable as usual, John Goodman is just going though the motions, Michael Douglas is pratically cadaverous looking as a hitman with a high rise wig.  I think the main reason he is in this movie is because it is his production company or something like that.  Matt Dillon's performance is harmless enough, but the true surprises are Reba McEntire as a shrink and Andrew Clay as the vengeful brother at the film's climax, a shootout which borrows from True Romance (they may have borrowed it, too). Liv Tyler is barely on screen and when she is they don't give her too many lines; it's mainly a sausage parade.  There was what could have been an amusing Village People riff if better scripted, but there are basically zero laughs in this movie.  I do not recommend it.",1017792000,,1275,4.4935064935064934
1633825,1,B00005NGAU,"There have been a lot of movies over the years I have been put off by. Occasionally, as in the case of One Night at McCool's, one has managed to put me out...
The movie is about a woman named Jewel [Liv Tyler] and the impact she has on three men who meet her one fateful evening at a neighborhood bar. Each man perceives her differently, both from the other two and from what she really is. Randy [Matt Dillon], the bartender, thinks she is the sweet young thing he has been dreaming about. His cousin, Carl [Paul Reiser], is a lawyer who believes her to be the hot woman he has always wanted. Detective Dehling [John Goodman] sees her as a damsel in distress that only he can save. What she really is is a conniving, self-centered material a girl. There have been a lot of good movies dealing with the idea of a person's appearing different to various people, but One Night at McCool's is not one of them. It's more about how some men's brains turn to mush around a sexy female. As a character Jewel isn't that interesting, so we don't ultimately care how these guys react to her.
Tyler has been good on other movies, but this one's attempts to turn her into a sex symbol doesn't do her any favors. In one scene she hoses herself down while washing a car...  Goodman and Reiser are adequate in their thankless roles, as is Michael Douglas, who plays a hit man. Douglas also had the misfortune to be one of the movie's producers. Dillion is believable as the bartender, but only because he'd probably make a better bartender than he does an actor.
Most movies usually work on some level. Some lesser ones manage to at least serve as mindless entertainment. One Night at McCool's doesn't even work on that level.",1015891200,2,1711,4.431746031746032

Hands down, Michael Douglas is the funniest person in the film. I have to give him enormous credit for letting himself be made over cosmetically into the most ridiculous looking guy you've ever met with full pompadour hairdo. But there are many other solid performances too. Liv Tyler does a really good job as the beautiful bombshell who comes into men's lives as their dream pick-up only to turn their lives upside down. In fact, contact with her may make you end up dead as she has a way of waltzing into troublesome, dangerous situations.

It was great seeing Matt Dillon for a change playing a role where he is the one totally out of control in the hands of the wrong woman. Paul Reiser as Dillon's lawyer cousin who wants Tyler as his dominatrix is very funny too and his solo scene at the end of the movie had me doubled over with laughter. John Goodman, however, is too much over the top as is Andrew Dice Clay. Their roles are almost cartoon-like they are so broad. Tyler is proving herself very well as an actress. I thought she was wonderful in ""Onegin"" with Ralph Fiennes and she shows real talent here as well.

Maybe because I was searching for an easy and good laugh. In any case, I sure regret my choice. This movie is bad tasted. Liv's character is obnoxious. It's no the kind of ""anti-hero villain"".

As Randy desperately tries to get rid of her, both Carl and Dehling try to win her. But in the end only Jewel gets what she wants.
My Opinion: I heard negative reviews of ONAM before seeing it and this lowered my expectations. I have found that my expectations have a lot to do with how much I like or dislike a movie. Some of the biggest and best surprises have come from movies that I heard were ""no good"" and some of the worst movie experiences have come from movies that had gotten built up in my mind. In the case of ONAM my expectations were rightfully dropped. The movie seems to have many of the pieces that make a great picture, but the ones it has just don't gel. There are some good performances by Matt Dillion, Paul Reiser, and Andrew Dice Clay and there are some funny situations, but they just seem to go flat. I found the plot a little hard to swallow. Although I like Liv Tyler, I couldn't buy Jewel as being that magnetic and magical as to lure these men into destruction. In the end I think the alternate ending on the DVD shows that even the director didn't know where the movie was going. In one ending Jewel smashes the snow globe, and in the other she does not.  If the director can't decide where the movie is going, how can the viewer?
DVD Quality: Video: Widescreen Anamorphic 1.85:1. Good picture quality. Sound: DD 5.1 My Love Is Alive sounded pretty good. I wondered what happened to Joan Osborne. Extras: Deleted scenes including an alternate ending, Making Of, Comentary. Menus: Snow Globe Menu is interesting. This is a fairly decent DVD release.
What You Should Do: Rent it if you are going to check it out. If you can lower your expectations enough, then it is worth seeing.

Detective Dehling (John Goodman) got there once the bar become a crime scene. Was it the dead body (Andrew Dice Clay) that tied these man together? Not as tightly as the live were who was also there that night. An stunning young woman aptly named Jewel (Liv Tyler). Now Randy wants his life back, by hiring a Hit-Man (Two Time Oscar-Winner:Micheal Douglas).

1633845,3,B00005NGAU,"One night at McCool's was a pretty good show.  I definately expect to see more from Harald Zwart in the future, but on to the movie.
Everyone wants to be with Liv Tyler's character, Jewel (subtle, I know).  In the beginning of the film three characters, Randy (Matt Dillon), Carl (Paul Reiser), and Detective Dehling (John Goodman), describe basically the same events surrounding how they met Jewel and how it has changed their lives.  ""It all started one night at McCool's,"" they all begin, Randy to a hitman (Michael Douglas), Paul to a shrink (Reba McEntire), and Detective Dehling to a priest (Richard Jenkins).  These stories will all lead (with some bizarre subplots along the way) to the present where the wacky film concludes.
This movie is a little different because it tells the same story from three different perspectives.  And they really are different.  Each character sees Jewel in a different way.  Randy likes her because she sort of reminds him of his mother, Carl likes her because he sees her as this sex kitten, a contrast to his rather dull suberban life, and Detective Dehling sees her as a reincarnation of his deceased wife. Equally funny is each man's perspective on each other.
I think this film works.  Especially if it is taken for what it is.  A light, quirky comedy.  The audience is never given the true motivation of the film's catalyst, Jewel.  Her character is only presented through the eyes of the other characters until the very end, so it is hard to gain a true sense of her being.  This sort of ambiguity was well played by Tyler.  The other performances were also fun.  Michael Douglas really tripped me out, he does not normally play characters like this.
One Night at McCool's, not bad.  I would recommend for people looking to laugh at some good actors in some silly roles.  Other than that, well...",1003881600,,1843,4.730407523510972
1633846,3,B00005NGAU,"Although I read a few bad reviews about this movie, I had to see it anyway simply because Liv Tyler plays the temptress- and she doesn't do a bad job (just the car wash scene should illustrate how well she can play this role)!  The remainder of the movie, however, isn't incredibly funny which is surprising considering the star power here- no one is really given much of an opportunity to shine in their role, which is a real shame since there was still a great deal of potential there.  A few cameos of other well-known actors made you wish they would spend more time on-screen=  Michael Douglas looks great as the sleazy Mr. Burmeister whose costume alone is worth a few laughs, and Andrew Dice Clay as Elmo and Utah was surprising given the huge difference between the brothers.
If you still aren't sure, just think of what it would be worth to you to see Paul Reiser running around in bondage gear for about 20 minutes- that will be your make-it-or-break-it decision.",1003104000,3,972,4.574712643678161

This is peak Liv Tyler, I don't know what became of her after this.  John Goodman's performance is so bittersweet, he went way beyond the call of duty for what could have been a simplistic screwball role.  This movie was the last time I consistently laughed out loud with Paul Reiser.  Reba McEntire was well cast as the shrink.  There are sexual scenes that might make you uncomfortable in certain company, but it's almost all for comic effect.",1476403200,2,579,4.917525773195877
