8167419,5,B000M9ET8S,"I find it funny reading the other reviews, since I actually worked on this film. I know a lot of the ""Nam"" scenes were literally made up on the fly. I was the weapons handler and the explosives tech. Listed as ""Assistant Special Effects"" in the end credits, but I was the only one on the ""Nam"" scenes.",1469836800,,301,4.206896551724138
8167420,5,B000M9ET8S,"This should be part of every curriculum for any psychosocial class or a class on dealing with mental issues of our returning veterans.  Knowing one of the actors, there was some license taken in the content (by the director), but the base story line is what is experienced by most returning veterans, be it Vietnam or for those returning from the sandbox.",1373673600,,355,4.725806451612903
8167421,1,B000M9ET8S,"Slow Bullet is a seriously obscure, shot-on-video war drama from 1988 that tries to make a serious statement on PTSD but ends up being ungodly dull, yet morbidly fascinating.  The film concerns a Vietnam vet named Buddy (Jim Baskin) who spends his time wallowing in his bedroom with a bottle of JD rambling to himself about the horrors he committed in 'Nam (the backwoods of Tennessee and Florida), and occasionally we see him chat aimlessly with a therapist, have sex (or only in his head?) with his girlfriend, and have filter-heavy flashbacks set to hysterically awful hair-metal.  These flashback sequences are hilarious, so you may want to see the movie for those, but the bedroom freakouts do not constitute plot and this movie has no point except to be tedious and depressing.  Avoid unless you're an SOV completest or are a collector of the worst films ever made, especially homegrown obscurities like Manos: The Hands of Fate.",1319328000,3,935,4.942675159235669
