5195496,5,B008Z0D5L8,"I remember watching Jack Benny as a kid, and was reminded of how great those shows were when I started to see re-broadcasts of those shows in the late '70s on public or independent television stations. As soon as the technology became available to me, I began to ""tape""(VCR)whatever episodes I could find being shown. Later, I bought whatever compilations I could find on DVD, but like an earlier reviewer stated, many were the same as on other compilations. How great would it be to have a ""Jack Benny Box Set"" come out, featuring all of the television seasons and episodes still in existence?! They finally came out with one like that of ""The Three Stooges""(which I have)a couple of years ago. Jack Benny is one of my favorite entertainers of all time, and even my teenage son agrees that he is great. He is truly timeless. I cannot wait to see ""The Lost Episodes"" and all of the rest of the material included! I wouldn't care if I had to watch it on an old film projector with bad quality. I just want to see it, however primitive. 5 stars, sight unseen. It doesn't get better than Jack Benny!",1374364800,4,1096,4.485
5195497,5,B008Z0D5L8,I loved to watch the reruns of The Jack Benny Show in the late 1980s on cable network CBN.  It really was a comedy gem that you just don't see nearly enough of in reruns.  I will cherish these 18 episodes and hope that more are released in the future.,1374192000,4,251,4.0
5195498,5,B008Z0D5L8,"Most other dvd sets have the same shows just in a different order, and none really have good extras at all until now. Back when these shows were made there was no real ""seasons"" a lot of the shows aired every two weeks or even three weeks because stars like jack benny burns and allen and others also done radio which at the time was more popular until the television explosion, that is why we don't have seasons with these older shows, and most were actually filmed off of a prompter instead of actually being filmed live so a lot of the quality suffered.

With all of that said this dvd sets looks to be promising and I cant wait for my copy to arrive Jack benny was by far a comedian far ahead of his time he was and still is the best in my estimation.",1373500800,5,755,4.136054421768708
5195499,2,B008Z0D5L8,"(N.B. - This review is based upon viewing a copy of the finished DVD set purchased by the author directly from Shout! Factory, the manufacturer of the product.)

While the material on this set is **marvelous**, and pretty much beyond reproach, it's a pity that for all that is written about the alleged ""restoration"" of these kinescopes in the accompanying booklet, this DVD set looks like it was transferred by dropping the films off at Walmart.

It's unbelievable that in 2013, we would have to watch a DVD that contains film elements that were transferred on a telecine that used 1960's technology.  Instead of a clean and **professional** archival transfer, where every frame is registered separately and distinctly to allow for proper motion upon viewing, what we have here are films that have been transferred with every frame blended together with one or two others (which causes noticeable and distracting ""ghosting"" to the image), and then to top it off, one out of every five frames repeats.  The result is a jerky, stuttery mess that becomes increasingly distracting with any movement within the frame.

It's quite possible that some viewers will not notice or care about these all-too-easily avoidable deficiencies.  As I mentioned, it's such a joy to have any new Benny material available that many may be able to overlook the technical aspects of the presentation.  But the point must be made that this is not an accurate representation of what vintage television can look like.  Whether or not more advanced restoration methods are used in the final production, the basis of any modern video presentation should begin with an accurate and professional transfer of the underlying material.  For whatever reason, that was not done in this case.

So unfortunately, buyer beware.",1371427200,38,1790,5.078498293515358
5195500,5,B008Z0D5L8,"This set is going to be amazing and the price is very fair.

If any folks want to pay 5 dollars more, then you can get it over a month early with a free exclusive bonus disc by ordering direct from Shout Factory!  Worth every penny of the extra money in my opinion.",1367452800,11,265,3.981132075471698
5195501,5,B008Z0D5L8,"Mr. Benny was known for his pauses but he never made us wait as long for a laugh as we have had to wait for his TV work to be on DVD. It is long overdue for The Jack Benny Program to be released in a respectful fashion and the possibility that some of the shows in this set might have been lost forever is frightening. Big 'Thank You's' go right up front to the Shout Factory and everyone involved for making Mr. Benny's work available here.

When Jack Benny came to radio from vaudeville in 1932, he realized that to sustain a weekly program he needed to develop a style of comedy with a depth that was not existent yet.  Rather than stand in front of a microphone and tell jokes endlessly, he developed a comic character (in fact a whole cast of them) that became real and lasting to generations of Americans. It was Benny, more than any other that invented the sitcom formula that has been used ever since .... and it could still be argued that no one has ever done it better.

When Benny moved to TV in the 50's, a certain magic from radio was lost but great things were gained as well. We got to see his annoyed looks to go with the celebrated pauses. We got to see the expressions on Rochester's face that went with that wonderful voice of his. We got to watch as Jack and Gisele MacKenzie played warm and hilarious violin duets. You will see those things here as well as other timeless fun with guest stars like: Red Skelton, George Burns, John Wayne, Frank Sinatra, Milton Berle, Dick Van Dyke, Gary Cooper, Tony Curtis, Jack Paar, Robert Wagner & Natalie Wood .... and that is a partial list. This set also includes a show with the Rev. Billy Graham and a program done with President Harry Truman at his library in Independence, Missouri!

In addition there are bonus features well worth having, not just filler. However, it cannot be stressed enough that the real value here is Jack Benny and the marvelous players he created great comedy with for decades. Eddie 'Rochester' Anderson,  Mel Blanc, Dennis Day, Don Wilson, Mary Livingston, et al.

Let's hope this is just the beginning of a series of DVD sets from The Jack Benny Program. It is way, way overdue. A season by season treatment of every episode still in existence is really what is called for. Nothing less can pay proper tribute to the one man who contributed more to comedy in the last century than any other. With his shows available on DVD, Benny could easily continue to influence comedy for the next hundred years as well.",1365724800,69,2500,4.4475982532751095
5195502,5,B008Z0D5L8,"I, too, am looking forward to this product. So my 5 stars are obviously in anticipation of what shows it might contain.

Jack Benny was not just one of the most intelligent and influential comedians of all time (Jerry Seinfeld has said he was inspired by him) but his show on both radio and TV spanned three decades.

The sheer number of guests who appeared on his television program--and by this I mean shows that have not yet made it do DVD--is remarkable. In that number are the Smothers Brothers, Peter Lorre, Carol Burnett, Frank Sinatra, Jr., Former President Harry Truman, Connie Francis, Jack Jones, Nat King Cole, Peter, Paul & Mary, The Beach Boys, Raymond Burr and Mickey Rooney.

As with his shows on radio, the Benny ensemble--including the comically brilliant Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Dennis Day, Phil Harris, and Don Wilson, among others--provided sit-com continuity.

The Jack Benny Program, in fact, was one of the few shows ever to successfully blend together sit com and variety show formats. The only other show that I can think of that did it as well was the Garry Shandling Show.

Anyway, this DVD is almost bound to fill a gap. Its almost like finding out that dozens of ""I Love Lucy"" or ""Dick Van Dyke Show"" episodes are about to be released and seen for the first time in decades.",1365724800,49,1308,4.719298245614035
5195503,5,B008Z0D5L8,"So CBS (and/or Universal) have FINALLY released ""lost"" episodes of one of the greatest comedies in television history - uncut and digitally restored. This is momentous news, and long overdue. The TV version of The JACK BENNY PROGRAM aired, in one form or another, for fifteen seasons - from 1950 to 1965. A popular and critical success of its time, it's still considered classic and still regularly referred to as a ""high-water mark"" in 20th century American comedy. (Even the commercials, integrated into the show itself and performed by series regulars, were hilarious!) There are approx. 260 episodes, but fans have had to content themselves with the same handful of recycled public domain titles for decades.

This 3-disc set features 18 original episodes from 1956 thru 1964; a combined running time of 9 hours (not including bonus material) of genuine rarities unseen for 50 years. According to a SHOUT! Factory press release: ""In addition to the recurring character lineup of Jack, Don [Wilson], Mary [Livingston] and Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, LOST EPISODES also features a superb lineup of guest stars including Natalie Wood, Red Skelton, Gary Cooper, George Burns, John Wayne, Dick Van Dyke, Billy Graham, Milton Berle, Tony Curtis and President Harry Truman."" Also featured are Dennis Day, Spike Jones, Mel Blanc, Frank Nelson, Ronald Colman, Frank Fontaine, Jack Paar, Robert Wagner, Rock Hudson, George Gobel, Mike Wallace, Hugh Downs and more. Additional Bonus Features include excerpts from 4 color TV specials spanning the years 1969 through 1974, with appearances by Frank Sinatra, Dinah Shore, Lucille Ball and Don Rickles. More extras: some raw, unedited Hearst newsreel footage of Benny, including a sequence with Jack and a staff of secretaries reviewing a deluge of entries for the 1945 ""I Can't Stand Jack Benny Because..."" Contest (!)

Let's just hope this initial volume is successful enough to convince the rights holders (whoever they are) to eventually issue the complete series on DVD. We can dream, can't we?

POSTSCRIPT: One reviewer decided to give this excellent set 2 stars based on a supposedly ""lousy video transfer."" This is as absurd as it is dishonest. I've also been viewing an advance copy of the finished DVDs purchased directly from Shout! Factory. The restoration was performed by the UCLA Film and Television Archive, according to the liner notes. I've screened two of the three discs in their entirety so far, and I don't know what he's talking about.

This DVD was a real treat, reliving young memories and watching a subtle master exercise his craft, along with his supporting group. Many later comics incorporated parts of his style, most notably Johnny Carson and Dick Cavett. I imagine we are all cost-conscious and may see ourselves, or others, in some of his antics.

5195584,5,B008Z0D5L8,"As a fan of Jack Benny, I have long sought to expand my episode collection, a deceptively complicated endeavor. Often, the same episodes will be released repeatedly on different disks. Sometimes a disk will turn up with all new material, sometimes with one or two episodes you can't get anywhere else. On other occasions, discs composed entirely of episodes you can get elsewhere for a better deal will appear. These disks frequently have no available episode guide, so telling these apart can often be hazardous. Even more confusing are customer reviews meant for one collection that have somehow ended up under another. I, the Jack Benny Trailblazer, through an extended period of careful research, mostly through purchasing the disk on a hunch and seeing what I got, am here to simplify matters.  Below are live links to each Jack Benny collection which I find most advisable to purchase found here on Amazon (although you may want an episode guide, I recommend the one on Wikipedia.org):

Best of Jack Benny (39 Episodes)
The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes (18 episodes)
Jack Benny - Comedy Pack (7 episodes)
The Best of Jack Benny (8 episodes)
The Best of the Jack Benny Show, Vol. 1 and 2 (17 episodes)
Jack At the Races Ed Sullivan/Genieve Show DVD (2 episodes) (Volume 3 of The Jack Benny Collection)

At the time a hotly anticipated release, Shout! Factory carefully selected a number of episodes never before released on DVD along with several interesting appearances by Jack in newsreel footage and other ""extra curricular"" features.  Among the episodes included, one of particular note is the exceptionally elusive Murder of Clayton Worthington in which Jack solves a murder with all of the suspects being played by Dick Van Dyke. For some reason, this episode never appears on any episode guide and has no entry on IMdB, meaning the only evidence of its existence is this box set. Other special episodes include George Burns, Ronald Coleman, and the much sought after Harry Truman episode.  Here is found a singular collection of Jack Benny material and may there be future releases in Shout's future.

You will find reviews like this one for each of the collections listed above.  May it be a useful tool to navigating the murky waters of Jack Benny DVD's. Also, be sure to watch for Jack Benny on Antenna TV.

5195587,5,B008Z0D5L8,"THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM: One of the most beloved entertainers of all time, vaudevillian trained comedian JACK BENNY's impeccable timing, laconic delivery and priceless hand to cheek pauses proved a major influence on JOHNNY CARSON, KELSEY GRAMMAR and countless other stars. Memorable for his trademark vanity and legendary stinginess, the blue eyed, violin butchering, 39 years young comedian played easily exasperated host to an air tight ensemble on his TV show within a show. Rounding out the cast were jovial, rotund announcer DON WILSON, DENNIS DAY's bumbling Irish tenor, gravelly voiced, wisecracking valet ROCHESTER, and cartoon voice expert MEL BLANC's array of kooks. Unfortunately, a few memorable radio characters like party-hearty band leader PHIL HARRIS weren't included in BENNY's smooth transition to TV, its lone flaw. The impressive guest star list included a who's who of Hollywood, from THE DUKE and BOGIE to his real life best pal GEORGE BURNS...which hardly hurt THE JACK BENNY PROGRAM's status as Sunday night's most hilarious staple for over a decade.

5195589,5,B008Z0D5L8,"The Jack Benny Program-The Lost Episodes produced by the Shout Factory is a misnomer. The 18 eps included in this set from the 1950s are from Jack Benny's personal cache of Kinescopes(a tv camera pointed at an off stage TV set screen)donated to and preserved by the UCLA Film and Television Archive way back when. They have never been""lost"".This is just a marketing ploy. The set includes an interview,bonus footage from some later Benny specials and newsreel footage. Great and historical stuff here.
TV programming from the 40s and 50s is much like silent films. Much of it was under appreciated(no one thought of any future potential of these shows),destroyed for financial gain(tape erased to be re-used for other shows) and done by all the major and minor studios themselves. Most of the intact TV shows that exist from this time period like I Love Lucy or the Jackie Gleason Show were preserved in toto due to the clout and foresight of its stars. But the majority of shows are gone,like silent film,and only exist in bits and pieces,if at all. What an absolute cultural crime both are.
It is because of this that it is an absolute pleasure to see that these shows are getting a new/renewed audience some 50+ years since their original air dates. Of course these kines needed some work and the enclosed brochure with this set explains the restoration that went into bringing them to DVD.We also know that there are plenty more where this group came from,so the public's support for this collection is essential if more are to come to DVD.
I might also ask the question that if these are""lost""shows,where are the""known"" shows? Although the booklet enclosed refers to ""known"" shows already out on DVD,I do not know of any official release of Benny's syndicated shows onto DVD.There are plenty of low grade copies out there,but I have never seen a release by CBS,or who ever now owns the rights to them. And one would expect to get to see the ""known"" shows,before one sees the ""lost"" ones,wouldn't they?
Nitpicking aside,this three disc set is a must have for Benny fans,or for anyone interested in TV history and the plethora of talent that populated the TV airwaves during the halcyon years from the 40s to the 60s. Benny's coven of co stars like the funny and talented announcer Don Wilson,to the equally talented and long time showman Eddie""Rochester""Anderson,to the mellifluous warblings of songster Dennis Day,all aide in defining Benny's comedy style. It also testifies to the top heavy talent on hand. Multiply the talent here times the number of other great shows on the air at any given time back then and you can see why this period is called TV's ""golden age"".I remember it so well,and have missed it a LOT.When talent was just that,and humour didn't come at the cost of losing one's gray matter,i.e. when a joke didn't have to involve a four letter word or sexually explicit material. I KNOW it,but I hope this set provides a newer generation with a fresh reassessment of what has been passing for ""talent"" and ""humour"" for the last 20 or more years.",1388275200,8,3066,4.775894538606403

The best episode is saved for last when he walks out to the audience, converses with them and never misses a beat in ad-libbing. He tops it off with another rendition of the famous ""Getting to Know You"" violin duet with Gisele MacKenzie.

In addition there is bonus material never seen before of outtakes from war year commercials and promos along with a conversation with Harry Shearer ""The Principal on The Simpsons and other voices"" regarding his late 1940s early 1950s stints on Jack's radio and television shows.

You sometimes couldn't tell if he was the comedian / or the straight man.  His humor was without insults, foul language,slapstick or degrading other people.

I think maybe those who choose the content of these dvd's think the most important thing in the selection of shows is the guest stars. to me however the guest stas are not really so important as benny and his regulars and the interplay between them (rockchester, dennis day, mary livingstone, and don Wilson, etc.). I wish simply that they'd come out with the entire series. I certainly would buy them whatever the cost! please! the entire series. not the hour long specials (which focused more on guest stars) just the half hour series, please!  please and please again! that would be five stars! thank you!",1376956800,8,814,4.613793103448276

Special guests featured included John Wayne, Spike Jones, Milton Berle, Gary Cooper, Rock Hudson, Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood, Billy Graham, Harry Truman, and many more.  However, some of the shows - especially the Gary Cooper and Harry Truman were of extremely poor quality which was a big disappointment.  I don't think any restoration was done on these episodes which were from kinescopes.  Some of the later episodes look better but it is a shame that they all did not have the same restoration efforts on all episodes.  The bonus features ranged from a very interesting interview with some of those who worked with Benny to some disappointing color episodes where Benny goes to introduce Frank Sinatra or Dinah Shore singing a song but you never get to hear the song!  The worse was so called Hearst Newsreel that I had thought from the title would be actual newsreel footage but seemed more like rehearsal since the same lines were said over and over again.  I always think Benny is funnier on radio where your imagination takes over.  I rate this a five as anything with Benny is always good and seeing some of this footage that I have never seen before was exciting but I rate it as a one for the quality of the non-existent ""restorations"" and the disappointing bonus features so it ends up a three.

There's no sign of any restoration. Most of these shows are from old kinescopes that have definite quality limitations. Some shows have Don Wilson making the obligatory closing announcement: ""This program was pre-recorded"". Pre-recorded on video tape? on film? Even those episodes have only slightly better picture quality. Given that, these videos give us a look at some rare stuff but don't expect much in terms of picture quality.  The worst picture quality is the episode with Harry Truman as guest.  The accompanying booklet explains the difficulty with this episode (different recording methods were used on different parts of the show).  Here's another false statement from the sleeve: it says these shows are ""unseen since their original broadcast"". Not so. For several years, I've had the Truman episode on commercially released video tape (distributed by Video Yesteryear in 1999; catalog #1212).  The picture quality on the vhs video tape is much better than on the dvd.  Video Yesteryear also released some other Benny episodes at about the same time.  Unfortunately the Video Yesteryear tapes are out-of-print, so you'll have settle for this dvd set.

In the first episode, Jack is to play his violin at Carnegie Hall. Feeling nervous, he asks Spike Jones for advice. Well, I have heard of Spike Jones and the City Slickers, but I never expected him to show up on a Jack Benny Program. If that is not enough, there is George Burns appearing as the Devil (years before being in Oh,God), who offers Jack a chance to be the best violin player ever. So Jack goes on stage (while the Devil waits in the wings). Jack plays beautifully before the orchestra before the Devil springs his trap by changing the conductor into Spike Jones. Spike invites Freddie Morgan and Mousie Garner on stage to play their violins. Soon the orchestra is upset by their crazy antics, not keeping time with music, then fighting over who is at fault, which results in Mousie breaking his violin. He grabs Freddie's violin and then Freddie grabs a banjo, then the whole piece starts to sound country. Soon everyone in the audience is laughing at the orchestra. (At the end, Jack mentions that he really did play at Carnegie Hall and raised $50,000 to help preserve the place.)",1375488000,4,1241,4.569506726457399

The quality of stars that appeared on his shows should be testament enough as to the quality of his spirit. Comedy giants in their own right the likes of Red Skelton, George Burns, Dick Van Dyke, and Milton Berle. Towering mega-stars like John Wayne, Gary Cooper, Tony Curtis. Ex-president Harry Truman! And evangelist Billy Graham (who isn't mocked and God isn't blasphemed as He would be today.)

This comes with a booklet that is also enjoyable with all sorts of tidbits about the Jack Benny shows you'll be watching, giving you new insights, and if possible, making them even more enjoyable to watch.. Maybe I'm a bit sappy, but my personal favorite is on disc 3, it's the Christmas show, and it shows us what Christmas programs should be, but no longer are. Of course, the extras on the set are also priceless, and when you learn why Jack was cancelled from network television you'll be stunned, but then you'll also realize why TV today is filled with talentless hacks, and unwatchable slop.

I would recommend this collection to anybody, whether you're old enough to remember quality television, or you enjoy clean humor, or if you just want to spend the evening with a glass of Pepsi and some popcorn for some good old fashioned belly laughs where you don't have to be insulted by the content, The Jack Benny  Program: The Lost Episodes is a must.

On a personal note, my wife and I care for my mother due to health issues, and all the programs that I have purchased from Amazon she watches, and reflects about the past.

5195661,5,B008Z0D5L8,"It's high noon in the DVD gunfight arena, and two of the most unlikely opponents square off against each other.

This piece isn't about who is faster on the draw; it is for those who love what is fashionably referred to as Classic TV series these days.

What has me wondering is the different reactions to The Jack Benny Program: The Lost Episodes from SHOUT! Factory and The Lone Ranger - Collector's Edition (2013) from Classic Media.

This Jack Benny set is reasonably priced and beautifully packaged, including a booklet on the restoration work done on these episodes that have apparently been unseen for decades.

On top of that you get to see George Burns as the Devil (Maybe that was a precursor to playing God later on, huh?); Jack Benny impersonating Jack Paar's late night interviewing style with Jack Paar watching; Milton Berle trying to transform Jack into his burlesque type of comedy; Gary Cooper doing a Western sketch that Jack would repeat with Clint Walker (not on this set, but I liked the Walker version better);Mel Blanc appears on a Christmas show and talks with Jack about his near fatal car accident which I knew nothing about; Dick van Dyke playing multiple roles in a English murder mystery parody; and a whole slew of others, along with the regular cast of Rochester, Dennis Day, and Don Wilson.

The bottom line here, for me, though, is that Jack Benny material exists once again for people to see and experience and evaluate in terms of Benny's impact on comedy.

And that even if Shout! screwed it up somehow, it still looks pretty good to me. I'm not arguing with the people who feel it could have been done better, I'm not qualified to comment on that.

What I find curious is that the Lone Ranger - Collector's Edition (2013) seems free of critiques from fans even though these episodes are clocked in at about 23 minutes running time.

To me, as nice as the packaging might be, as nice as the extras are, the bottom line here is what inspired all this. The show! What I want to see is the show as close to the way it aired as possible.

Which is why, by the way, I keep harping on Warner Archives to include the bumpers for their 1950s western and private eye shows, because no one did this better than Warners, except maybe for Disney, in that time-frame.

Back in the '90s, I worked on a comic series at Jim Salicrup's request for Topps Comics that he wanted to do.

Not Jack Benny Vs. The Lone Ranger, though Jim is, indeed, a Jack Benny fan.

But Zorro Vs. The Lone Ranger and Tonto.

I also worked on a video game for Lorne Michaels's company, which had the rights to the Lone Ranger at the time.

Claude St. Aubin did the illustrations for both projects.

For those of you interested in lost, never seen, Lone Ranger and Tonto art, just go to the Comicsbulletin.com site, and a longer review, with a lot of art is posted up on my Riding Shotgun column.

In the long run, I hope this Jack Benny DVD set means we will see more released at some time in the future.

With Warners including the bumpers for series like 77 Sunset Strip.

5195662,5,B008Z0D5L8,"Jack Benny is arguably the greatest comedian of all time. Beginning in Vaudeville, he played violin and told jokes as a start. But he accumulated comic ticks and personality quirks, one after another, and incorporated them into his act. He nurtured his writers and his supporting cast.

He was a radio giant through the Depression, WWII and the Korean War. He balanced TV and radio appearances in the mid-50s then moved to the tube full time. His series, ""he Jack Benny Program,"" gave way to occasional specials and an endless procession of guest appearances, along with movies and even a Warner Brothers cartoon (""The Mouse That Jack Built"").

Many of his TV episodes, numbering over 200, are still being rerun on cable stations. Some are in the public domain and can be found on budget DVD sets. This new ""Jack Benny Show - The
Lost Episodes"" collection from Shout! Factory, is different. It's very big news of course for fans, but also because many of them figure prominently into pop culture, Hollywood legend and American history.

This set is big news, indeed. Perhaps the most astonishing find among the 18 shows is one with then-married Natalie Wood and Robert Wagner, singing, dancing and playing beautifully off Benny. But then most anyone could play well against Benny, even Harry Truman.

Jack Benny's ""Truman show"" is a rare appearance on an entertainment show by the 33rd President. The episode was shelved after its first broadcast because the sound quality in the Truman sequence is not really broadcast quality. Seeing it now is astonishing.

If you love Jack Benny, this set is a gold mine. While there are not a lot of episodes that follow the ""Jack at home"" format with Mary Livingston, you'll see Dennis Day, Eddie ""Rochester"" Anderson, Don Wilson and Mel Blanc (who does the classic ""S&iacute; / Sy"" routine).

While some might have to be cautioned about political correctness issues in a very few instances within specific shows, it is worth noting that there is also a very sly inversion of incorrectness in one of the selections. When Benny introduces Lux soap as his new sponsor, an Asian announcer comes onstage and begins a very inappropriate, stereotypical pitch. Then it is revealed that he really speaks in the rich tones of an American announcer, and Benny is the butt of the joke, as usual.

In the last episode of Season 10, Jack faces dismissal when the network executives (real CBS suits played by Joseph Kearns (TV's ""Dennis the Menace, Disney's Alice in Wonderland"") and Bob Sweeney (actor/director who played Tupper in Disney's ""Toby Tyler""). They have discovered that Benny himself doesn't generate laughs. They actually isolate his speaking parts and compare them to those of Dennis Day. It's a wicked jab at network research and corporate pragmatism. Brilliant for its day and for today as well.

Jack Benny also got Hollywood's biggest stars of the day to appear on his show. In addition to Wood and Wagner, there Gary Cooper, Rock Hudson, John Wayne and Tony Curtis. ""Lost Horizon"" superstar Ronald Colman and his wife Benita Hume make their sole Benny appearance, though they did numerous radio shows in which Benny's character pushed their British courtesy to its limits.

Dick Van Dyke, in the midst of filming his classic TV sitcom and the movie version of ""Bye Bye Birdie,"" appears in a show that, like the others, many of us have never seen before. My personal favorite is the Easter show, because this was the one time we can see Jack walk along the boulevard, greeting members of his oddball troupe. The routine was a radio favorite of mine, so it's cool to see it unfold on film.

I'm the kind of classic and radio fan who has to constantly invest in compilations to find even one or two that I have not seen or heard. How wonderful to find a brand new collection, filled with material I didn't know could ever be recovered!

5195663,5,B008Z0D5L8,"I'll be brief. It's the material, not the video quality that makes this set essential. It's not perfect video because most of it never was, but there aren't the usual scratches, splices and missing music and credits typical of those public domain sets. This is a great set, packaged in order of airing, include most of the original commercials and the live TV banter. I especially liked the episode with President Truman and all of the political and pop culture references of the day. Stars pop up everywhere even when they aren't billed. Plenty of George Burns, Rochester, Dennis Day, Robert Wagner, Natalie Wood. Great Stuff. Don't hesitate because of the videophiles who poo poo the video.",1374710400,4,692,4.923076923076923
