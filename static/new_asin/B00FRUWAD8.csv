8618398,4,B00FRUWAD8,"This package brings together four documentaries on space travel.  The theme in several of them is the next stage in space exploration, missions to Mars.  But much of the content deals extensively with prior missions, ranging from the Gemini and Apollo programs in the 1960s to  Skylab in the 1970s, the space shuttle program (1981-2011), and the international space station.  In contrast to many documentaries on astronomy, the primary focus is on the logistical and engineering issues involved in getting out into in space and surviving over long periods of time.  All these documentaries underscore the fact that the technology to go into space has had to be invented at each new step in the process, with some spectacular successes but also some serious setbacks.  In this sense, these documentaries address the need for practical solutions to real world problems.",1517702400,,867,5.1571428571428575

8618401,5,B00FRUWAD8,"This is a four part documentary series created by the Smithsonian Channel about where the space program currently is and its plans for the future. All four episodes feature interviews from officials at the Smithsonian and NASA, as well as company executives, astronauts, engineers and scientists. The footage is of good quality and most of it is very recently produced (around late 2013), color and with great looking computer generated images! Some of the footage is Black and White but of good quality. The episodes are:

1. Into the Unknown: focuses on the unmanned interplanetary space probes. Coverage is of mostly recent expeditions to Mars with some archival footage (black and white) of earlier space probes and an explanation of rocket technology and how it was developed.

2. The Moon and Beyond: focuses on the manned expeditions to the Moon in the late 1960s, with coverage of the Space Launch System SLS and the testing of its engines (includes recent, good quality, computer generated images of the SLS rocket).

3. Open for Business: focuses on the attempts to commercialize space by SpaceX, XCOR and other private companies. Features interviews and computer generated images of the mini-space plane Dreamweaver and SKYLON. The Space Shuttle program is covered and the technology it created which is now being used to develop private spacecraft to take people into space.

4. Surviving the Void: focuses on the Skylab, ISS and different programs to enable humans to live in space for long periods of time. Trips to Mars are covered and interviews with different astronauts about their experiences are featured.

Bonus: Shuttle Discovery's Last Mission which focuses on the history of the space shuttle Discovery and the efforts to fly it and put it on display at the Smithsonian. Footage of past flights, the Hubble telescope, the return to flight mission as well as others is presented. Along with computer generated images of the plans to move the shuttle Discovery into the Smithsonian's display.

These programs are very well mage, with excellent footage which gives the viewer a good idea of where the space program is now and the plans NASA and private industry have for the future. This really a great value! You are getting 5 good programs for around $25.00. Each episode covers its topic well and gives the viewer an idea of what the hard-won lessons of the past were and challenges of future space exploration. This is everything you would expect from the Smithsonian Channel and more! This 4-part series would make a great addition to the collection of the space enthusiast as well as anyone interested in the space program in general! I am keeping this for my collection!",1390953600,8,2698,5.011160714285714
