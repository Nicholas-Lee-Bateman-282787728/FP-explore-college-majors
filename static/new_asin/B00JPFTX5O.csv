6383095,5,B00JPFTX5O,"This intense drama kept me glued to the story!  Excellent!  It is longer than a regular TV episode but since the acting and story were thoroughly engaging, it worked.  For those who commented it was too long, movie length, I could see splitting each episode in half and making this a 4 episode series but for me it worked as it is.",1404691200,,331,4.306451612903226
6383096,2,B00JPFTX5O,"I did not like the abrupt cut from past to present.  The transition was choppy; film editing I guess, I am not expert but assume that is what it was.  Generally followed the book and acting was good.",1403395200,,199,4.2105263157894735
6383097,3,B00JPFTX5O,"I liked it, but did not like the modern piece, the Mafia like guys and the crazy cult women. If you took all that out, the story would have been so much better and believeable. I am sure the book was better, but I didn't read it. (There was a book, correct?) Ha! Love the girl from Downton, she's wonderful but the rest was just not well done.",1402876800,2,343,4.0588235294117645
6383098,3,B00JPFTX5O,"...because it sure did me. I watched this when it came on the CW for a two night, 4 hour total. The previews had me rushing to set my DVR for this movie/miniseries and I started it eagerly. I watched the cast names pop up as the movie started and a few names had me super excited; Katie McGrath, John Hurt, Tom Felton, Sebastian Stan... So I would have given the movie 2 stars but the extra is for the (in my opinion) very good acting and set/costumes. Especially for a TV movie presented on the CW.

The movie opened and jumped into an exciting ""vision"" early and then took a turn toward a much slower pace. And I kept waiting for it to pick up. I thought, ""Well, this IS a 4 hour movie so it has a long time to set up."" In short, it felt like the whole movie was a set up. And the climax (if you can even call it that) was hidden amidst explanations for the so called mystery that felt way too rushed, not fully explained and, quite frankly, extremely boring to have been such a great mystery for the ages. It seemed like there was a lot left out.

I wanted to like it SO much. Especially when I saw it was based on a book. After seeing the movie, I'm definitely not going to waste my time on the book.

The title also had me believing it had something, ANYTHING, to do with the Labyrinth found in Greek mythology. It doesn't. I honestly have no clue, after FOUR HOURS, what in the WORLD the title had to do with the story! I wouldn't recommend it.",1401408000,34,1450,4.098591549295775

6383142,1,B00JPFTX5O,"I love History; I like a well-developed movie, especially if it imparts a message. Alas, the Labyrinth relies on junk history, it's poorly developed, and imparts only the most clichd message. Some movies impart no message at all; rather, they leave audiences asking questions. This often works very well, but the only question I came away with here was why in the hell was this dog even made? At best, the acting is okay, but not good enough to carry an entirely predictable plot. Oh, except for the modern-day villainess--gag--totally incredible and horribly over acted. Some gratuitous nudity and fornication that does not progress the story in the least. Katie McGrath, do yourself a huge favor and don't do topless again, you haven't the requisite tools. There's a modern-day love story mixed into this movie, but there's absolutely no chemistry between the principals. Yawn. Complete waste of time and money. The ONLY thing this movie is good for is a possible bedtime story -- for when you really need something to drive you into a coma.

It never got interesting...and I was hoping for much with the Harry Potter and Downton Abbey stars. Poor choice for lagging careers.

So much of the book is left out it is pretty unrecognizable.  I bought the first part and am still debating about purchasing part II.  To be fair, maybe if I had not read the book, I would like it better.  But I think that so much was cut out of the book (huge, huge plot gaps that are vital to the story), the plot is almost nonsensical, maybe it gets better in part II.  If you have read and love the book, you may want to skip this.  I was very disappointed.  I guess I will buy part II to see if it gets any better and will leave a review for II when I do.

For 800 years this guy didn't get schtup'd because he pined away for a woman who
foolishly loved a scoundrel that was nailing her own sister? Quit it!
In that time he would've figured out a 1,000 ways to find love with an unending list of hot young babes.
Where's the John Hurt that played Caligula? Coulda used him here.
So then the ditsy heroine dumps the secrets of the universe & eternal life to play house with some vicious cougar's cast off sex toy?

6383150,1,B00JPFTX5O,"Boring in the extreme. I thought with such a cast, and associated with Ridley Scott it should have been a clear hit. Instead a very muddy plot, (and no I did not read the book) but frankly the main idea of who the Cathars were and their relationship with the people they were living with in Southern France in 1209 was not fully explained. Why the Holy Grail which (spoiler alert here) could bestow magical powers of immortality was associated with Christianity made no sense. Why certain people wanted it in 2012 and how they found out about never explained. In the scenes during 1209 there is a lot of running around from place to place with no explanation as to why people are running so much. I guess the running was so supposed to indicate urgency or fear?? Direction just average and cinematography could have been so much better, location was beautiful. I had purchased it, so I watched it hoping it would get better. Never did and the ending, character development was so bad that I could never really figure out the motivations of anyone. As for the group that wanted the ""grail"" who the heck were these guys and why did the follow a power mad cosmetics CEO out to her house to meet in secret and have weird meetings? I guess if you read the book, then you would understand. But a movie should be stand alone. Don't waste the time. Read the book if you like this kind of thing.",1443830400,9,1386,4.43921568627451

6383177,1,B00JPFTX5O,"BBC miniseries are traditionally boring. They are full of long speeches and actors being forced to spout dialogue as if they are reciting someone else's poetry for 7th grade. Just watch one of those Shakespeare monstrosities to see how boring BBC can get. This miniseries is even more boring since it drags an hour of story over the course of three hours of tedium. Even when people are getting killed, there's not enough emotional connection to care. I am convinced that John Hurt was hired solely so he could say the line ""you have a destiny"" for the Merlin fanboys.

What truly pushes this movie over the line from trifle to disaster is the insistence on putting all this gravitas in the service of a time travel plot that unravels the more you think about it. The Cathers have the grail in the 12th century and there's a grail that might be in modern times, but the evil Catholic Church wants to get it and get rid of it. And they are very stubborn about it - even murderous - like you gotta shoot them to get them off your back.

At a certain point, people start getting stabbed but it's not enough to distract.",1426118400,,1116,4.439024390243903

However, it just becomes a redundant, drawn out tale of lethal sibling rivalry, a cutthroat cult grabbing for power, and lots of (for this viewer) gratuitous sadistic violence.  I expected a little more exploration of bigger themes from this director (Ridley Scott) rather than a grisly mystery, although to its credit it does expose how politically and economically motivated were the so-called Holy Crusaders even in Europe -- mowing down or incinerating anyone who didn't adhere to their same exact creed.

6383224,4,B00JPFTX5O,"No, this is not a review for the 80s David Bowie film that features Jim Hensons creature-creations (which is a good, fun film, by the way).  This is a review of the 2012 miniseries based on the bestselling book written by Kate Mosse.  The book is historical fiction with a slight sci-fi element, and it is an excellent read.  If you're a fan of the book, you will certainly want to give this screen adaptation a look.

Im not sure if Ive mentioned this before, but Im a sucker for good historical fiction.  In fact, one of my favorite books of all time is PILLARS OF THE EARTH by Ken Follett.  But if an author or filmmaker can weave believable time travel into the mix, my interest is definitely piqued.  Such was the case with LABYRINTH.  I knew this was a must-see the minute I found out it was in production; the book is very impressive, and I was interested to see how well it could be adapted for the screen.  Im happy to report that this is a hearty adaptation, and although not perfect, it is definitely worth a watch.

LABYRINTH is shot well and looks good onscreen.  The production value looks high, which is evident from the detailed costumes and set pieces.  Although this is a miniseries, the budget appears pretty high even so.

The acting is great, with John Hurt and Tom Felton headlining a great cast.  Jessica Brown Findlay and Vanessa Kirby do an excellent job of playing off one another, and I have to particularly give a shout out to Tony Curran, who portrays Guy DEvreux; I have loved Currans work for many years, ever since I saw him in THE 13TH WARRIOR many years ago, and he does a stellar job once again here.

My sole complaint about this screen adaptation of LABYRINTH is that it is a bit slow at times.  Whereas the book is paced very well and moves at a nice clip, this film feels as if it drags in parts around the middle, which made my mind wander a bit.  Thankfully, this does not happen so much that it ruins the film.

Still, LABYRINTH is a heck of a film, and I recommend giving it a look.  It is available now in a variety of formats, so check it out.",1406678400,3,2088,4.3076923076923075

The trailer does a great job of selling it as an exciting and intricate time-slip adventure, though the finished product doesn't quite live up to its intriguing premise.

In 2005, Alice Tanner is volunteering on an archaeology site in the in the Sabarthes Mountains when she is drawn to a hidden cave in the hills. There she finds two skeletons, with a mysterious book and ring with a labyrinthine design lying between them. As Alice continues to explore the old cities and ruins of southwest France, she's haunted by vivid dreams and a strong sense of dj vu, and eventually her discoveries put her in the orbit of a rich and powerful antiquarian called Marie-Cecile de l'Oradore, a woman who has been searching for the Holy Grail her entire life.

In 1209, seventeen year old Alas is a young wife who lives with her husband, father and sister at Chateau Comtal, a citadel under the protection of the very young Viscount Raymond-Roger Trencavel. One morning she goes to fetch herbs on the riverbank and discovers the dead body of a man in the water, his throat cut and his thumb removed. With that discovery, her father reveals to her his long-held secret: that he is one of the guardians of three books that contain the secrets of the Holy Grail. To complicate matters, an army from the north of France is invading Carcassona in order to eradicate the Cathar heretics. As the Viscount prepares for a siege, Alas's father decides to unite the three books and entrust them to his youngest daughter, much to the jealousy and resentment of her elder sister Oriane.

Both past and present intersect when both women are drawn into the hunt for the Holy Grail, aided by those who protect it and threatened by those who covet it for themselves. It theory it all sounds thrilling: female protagonists, ancient conspiracies, an historical mystery, and of course the allure of the ever-elusive Holy Grail. The problem is that - much like the book - the execution of this premise just doesn't gel properly. An adaptation would have been the perfect way to iron out some of the inconsistencies and odd pacing decisions of the book, but instead the screenplay only adds more problems.

Simply put, the story is immensely cluttered and it's difficult to pin down what any character is trying to do at any given time. Practically every line of dialogue is exposition, explaining everyone's feelings, relationships, motivation and thoughts without the slightest attempt made to actually *show* us. Though the second half is better than the first, the resolution is painfully anticlimatic and it's strewn with weird inconsistencies.

For instance, at the start of the story Alas's father warns her about Oriane's untrustworthy nature, telling her that she must be on her guard around her. At about the mid-point Alas comes to him with concerns that Oriane is plotting against them, only for him to pish-posh what she's trying to tell him. Huh?

Then there's Marie-Cecile, who inexplicably gives her boy-toy free run of her estate while she's busy sacrificing people in the garage. And Paul Authie the assassin, who decides to make a phone-call while he's still wearing gloves bloodied from his latest victim. And Alice, who stupidly decides to explore an underground cave mere seconds after an earthquake dislodges several large rocks from the hill above it. And Oriane, who is magically able to react to a man silently shaking his head in response to her question, even though she's fully turned away from him at the time. The villains are walking clichs, though I have to admit I'm fond of the line: ""I'll make honest Christians of these people, even if I have to kill every last one of them to do it."" See anything a tad illogical in that sentiment?

Look, every film or story is bound to have a couple of silly moments, but this is just one nonsensical thing after another.

On the plus side, the high production values mean that ""Labyrinth"" is beautiful to watch if nothing else: the locations, the costumes, the sets - it's all high quality and the designers manage to strike a nice balance between the natural beauty of the world and the more uncompromising realities of life in the 13th century. The soundtrack is suitably evocative and the actors ries to the occasion, determined do their best with an incredibly clunky script. Jessica Brown Findlay has the most success as Alas, though her contemporary counterpart Vanessa Kirby wanders around with a perpetually blank expression. Katie McGrath plays another bad girl akin to her role in&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Merlin/dp/B00C4UR3PO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Merlin</a>, but manages to portray Oriane as quite a different creature than Morgana, whilst Sebastian Stan provides shirtless eye-candy as what amounts to Alice's bland love interest. John Hurt slums it in a minor role, and Tom Felton plays against type as the heroic young Viscount Trencavel.

I wanted to love ""Labyrinth"", I really did, and I was hopeful that a TV adapation could take the potential of Mosse's wonderful premise and improve on its awkward execution. But it was not to be.",1406073600,7,5571,5.292986425339366
6383228,4,B00JPFTX5O,"Historical fantasy?  Is that the best way to describe what this tv movie is about?  In any case, this is an adaption of Kate Mosse's book of the same name.  It is a medieval fantasy, with a twist.  It is a story of two women, separated by time.  Alais, living in southern France over 800 years ago, becomes the guardian of the Grail.  Meanwhile, in the present day, Alice Turner is a teacher on holiday in the same location.  Alice is a volunteer at an archaeological site near the walled city of Carcassone.  The story centers on the Grail, all wrapped up within the bigger story of what happened to the Cathars as they were purged from the city.  In the present day, two powerful factions are on a race to find the Grail.

The movie seamlessly switch from one time period to another, giving the impression that the events are all occurring simultaneously, rather than separated by 800 years.  The production quality is very high.  And the acting from the major characters are all great, coming from a terrific young cast.

Jessica Brown-Findlay plays Alais, while Vanessa Kirby plays Alice.  John Hurt, Tom Felton, Katie McGrath, and Sebastian Stan play major roles.  John Lynch, Emun Elliott, and Tony Curran round out the excellent cast.

The plot unfolds slowly at first.  This may bore some viewers.  However, your patience will be rewarded with some good action scenes.  The fight choreography in the movie was of good quality.  Both Ms. Brown-Findlay and Ms. McGrath have nude scenes.  And the castle town of Carcassone is quite a sight to behold, even on film.

Will Alice Turner discover the secrets of the Grail, as well as its current location, before it falls in the wrong hands?  One faction wants to harness its power for wealth and profits.  While another would like to destroy it and its secrets forever.

Highly recommended.",1405900800,9,1842,4.735015772870662
