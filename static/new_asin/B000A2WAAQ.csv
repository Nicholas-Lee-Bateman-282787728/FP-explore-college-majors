This DVD is only playable on a PAL DVD compatible player and worth purchasing one that will play PAL just for this grand DVD!!

According to their web page:

Augie March is one of Australia's most unique and special musical acts, having established a fanatical horde of supporters who are hungry for some new material from their favoured lads.

Drones & Vapid Ditties is Augie March's first DVD and encapsulates a 3 hour, warts and all history-to-date of the band.

This DVD features all 8 of their music videos including the haunting 'Little Wonder' clip (recent winner at the St Kilda Film Festival), many live performances including a live concert filmed at Victoria's Meredith Music Festival late last year plus a documentary covering the recording of the Sunset Studies album, TV performances, bootlegged video footage, audio commentary, personal photo gallery and of course some rare uncovered gems from the Augie vault.

Drones & Vapid Ditties will be supported with a street based campaign, as well as Sydney and Melbourne tour dates.

Drones & Vapid Ditties is absolutely essential viewing for any self-respecting Augie March fan.",1185235200,,1412,5.636792452830188
