4486529,5,B004WI10YQ,Although I'm a Singaporean. This is a great documentary about the U.S elite forces recruitment and the tough training that these men has to under go no regret in buying.

4486530,5,B004WI10YQ,"If you're into Military type shows, survival shows, or even shows about the elements that make some people succeed where others ""fail,"" then you will very much enjoy watching this show ""Surviving the Cut"" from Discovery Channel.

Each episode follows one class through the extra vigorous training it takes to become one of Americas Elite soldiers. The episodes include: Special Forces Divers, Marine Recon, Air Force Pararescue, Navy EOD, Marine Snipers, and Army Rangers. My favorite hour long episode was the Navy EOD. Having never been in the Military, I can't attest to the ""accuracy"" of the program, but from what they do show, I've gained a whole new respect for the guys that are selected.

All the episodes are very entertaining to watch, and will make you wonder how you would fare under the same circumstances. Inspirational in that sense. Demonstrating the remarkable ability of the body to undergo such high stress and physical endurance.

If you're looking for an inside look into our Militarys Elite Soldiers grueling training,and what makes Americas Military so great, do yourself a favor and pick this show up! Highly recommended!!",1336953600,,1147,5.122994652406417
4486531,5,B004WI10YQ,"This is a great video and series that show what our elite fighting men can do under stress. I would have liked to have seen the Navy SEAL's BUD/S training, but it may have been omitted for security reasons. I would have liked to have seen the Coast Guard Helicopter Rescue Swimmer training included in the series. I bet it was omitted because it is noncombat. But what other service will rescue a guy caught in 50 foot seas with no other way to save himself, but to call the Coast Guard! The Rescue Swimmer (AST) will always say ""Yes I can do this, put me in coach"" knowing he may well die in the attempt! The Rescue Swimmer's motto is ""So Others May Live."" This motto was derived from an officer's report of a rescue on December 22, 1884 by the Cape Hatteras Life Saving Station, North Carolina. The report said in part, ""These poor, plain men, dwellers upon the lonely sands of Hattaras, took their lives in their hands and, at the most imminent risk, crossed the most tumultuous sea that any boat within the memory of living men had ever attempted on that bleak coast, and all for what? ""That others might live to see home and friends."" The LSS joined the Revenue Cutter Service to form the U. S. Coast Guard in 1915.

4486532,5,B004WI10YQ,"Behind the scenes as to what goes into making our military elite. These DVD's are just BAD ASS! If your a military nut like me, you'll love this stuff!!",1323475200,2,152,4.275862068965517
4486533,5,B004WI10YQ,"As a retired senior military officer, I found this DVD most informative and inspiring.  Much has changed since I retired in 1986, and to see the new techniques and training aids that are out there to test the mettle of our fighting men and women, is most interesting. It is reassuring to know that we ARE the cutting edge in stealth, be it ground, sea, or air, materiel, or physical. Well documented and narrated. This training and the personnel who volunteer for this rigorous and demanding training are a tribute to the many who have given their lives to defend and support this great nation against any and all enemies, past, present,and into the future.",1322438400,25,657,4.71304347826087
4486534,5,B004WI10YQ,Fantasic price.  This series is a big favorite of my oldest son.  He is away at a military college and is not allowed to watch tv.  One of the biggest things he misses is watching this series.  Turns out it is a major hit with may of his platoon members as well.  Hope season 2 is out soon.,1318982400,9,290,3.9310344827586206
4486535,5,B004WI10YQ,"Outstanding series that really gives you a very realistic and accurate picture of what it takes to make the cut at any number of very difficult military training courses. I know first hand and recommend this DVD set for anyone who has a family member serving, thinking about joining, or is planning to attend one of these courses.

The Marine Corp and Army both have a number of very intensive training courses available for those with enough mettle and courage to attempt. Many more are too scared to even apply. Many fail out during the course. Yet, even those who try but fail are more courageous than those who are too scared to try. While both services have tough courses the big Army elite courses of Ranger and Airborne,  train super-tough automatons but not commandos. Marine and Army Special Forces training instead is focused on training free-thinking commandos. I think the later type of training teaches better skills in the long-run.

But the differences go even further. Marine Corps training courses are both physically and mentally challenging but Marine ethos requires all instructors to lead by example (Ductus Exemplo). The instructors are also the epitome of professionalism. Yes, standards are high but everyone (student and instructor) is held to that same standard. Unfortunately, that has not been my experience in Army training. Army instructors had a ""do as I say, not as I do"" ethos and many were not physically fit or well-rounded.

Ask any Marine who has attended Army Airborne school and they will tell you the same thing. What a contrast. Service members from the Navy and Air Force will agree. Army Airborne school is one week of training crammed into three weeks of disorganized and unnecessary BS games. But for the Army, being Airborne is elite.

Next time you are at any major airport look around at how the Marines conduct themselves and contrast that with all the soldiers you see. Uniform, grooming, bearing, etc. BTW, you will rarely see a Marine in his camouflage utility uniform in a public place because it is per se unprofessional (and against USMC regulations).

I graduated from the USMC Basic Recon Course, Marine Combatant Diver School, MCIWS, Army Airborne, and Army SF SERE, etc more than 10 years ago and served in both Army and Marine Corp units. For my .02 I would advise any young stud who is thinking of joining an elite unit to look first to the Marines where even if you wash out of BRC you will still have a chance to be a super stud (Sniper, EOD, MARSOC, MCIWS, ANGLICO, etc). Just earning the title to be a Marine allows you to hold your head high and be part of an elite brotherhood. Conversely, if you go the SF Army route and are not selected you are stuck being in the big Army for your entire time in uniform.",1316995200,8,2774,4.721074380165289

I figure if I do't have to call customer service of some support division, the transaction went fine.

4486574,5,B004WI10YQ,"Clear image quality, great price, 7 episodes with bonus content. I'll say that I felt each episode could become its own season. Most of what you see is the last few days of a portion of training, but it's still interesting to see what makes our military unique. It gives you perspective on what real drama is (sorry cupcake wars, you oughta be ashamed of the word war in your title).

As much fun as it is to see people succeed in their training, it's less so when you realize that they may have to apply those skills in life or death situations. What was of most value to me was seeing what was causing the best of the best to washout. Very few of us will get to see someone chase their dreams with such passion just to be pushed to their limits and fail. Some of these guys train for years starting in high school and going well past college just for the chance to be selected as one of these elite few. My hat is off to those who succeed, to those who try and fail, and to those who work very hard to enable those warriors to do their job.",1356393600,,1042,4.107843137254902
