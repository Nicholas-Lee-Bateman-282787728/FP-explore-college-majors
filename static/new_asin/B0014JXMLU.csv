8255943,1,B0014JXMLU,For a movie made in 2006  it is sadly lacking in the special affects department. The plot is possible a good movie but very lacking in funding.,1447200000,,143,4.296296296296297

8255946,3,B0014JXMLU,"This movie isn't bad, nor is it original. It is very similar to The Shining in many ways. The acting is decent (the 2 worst actors are also the first to die), and the story line isn't bad. Although the special effects aren't the greatst, this movie has definite merit and I suggest that any horror fan watch it. No, it is not scary, which is a definite downside. But I enjot it and have re-watched it several times.",1288396800,2,415,4.265822784810126
8255947,1,B0014JXMLU,"Pray for Morning (Cartney Wearn, 2006)

If by some odd chance you caught this on insomniac television, then you should most certainly take the title's advice. Why? Because when morning rolls around, you will have finally finished watching this boring bowl of tripe soup. Assuming, that is, you didn't fall asleep five minutes into it, as you probably should have.

Paper-thin plot: bunch of cute teens breaks into old hotel haunted by ghost (played by Udo Kier, who desperately needed money, I guess) and gets slaughtered one by one.

You've seen this plot a million times before. You've seen it better-acted, better-directed, better-written. Wearn, by the way, also wrote the film, which was his first. To date, it's also been his last, and at a guess, there's a reason for that. (More telling, perhaps: of the stable of cute teens, only three have had anything more than bit parts and guest spots in TV shows since--Jonathon Trent showed up in Transformers: Revenge of the Fallen, Jackson Rathbone is a part of the Twilight franchise, and Jessica Stroup showed up in the Prom Night remake.) I'm assuming that the few parts of this that looked like they may have been original (for example, the killer's method of execution) stem more from my not having seen every slasher movie ever made than from any actual originality on the part of the script; I have no evidence to the contrary from this otherwise utterly derivative work. The acting is barely competent, the direction isn't. *",1286409600,3,1484,4.880952380952381
8255948,2,B0014JXMLU,"You can really see the low budget in this, especially the effects. Rather average movie but it di have it's occassional moments.",1286323200,,128,4.863636363636363
8255949,5,B0014JXMLU,"Better than most horror films, this one gave you a story line than wasn't out of this world. The plot kept you interested in what was going on but it wasn't to cut-them up slasher movies.",1277337600,2,187,4.222222222222222
8255950,4,B0014JXMLU,It's definitely an atention grabber. One of my fav guys are in - Jackson Rathbone. It's a good one. Buy or rent it...whatever.,1247011200,2,126,4.521739130434782
8255951,2,B0014JXMLU,"some people might actually enjoy this movie. i didnt. it actually started pretty interesting but got weaker soon. the effects are B movie and the lead actor""s performance is not the strongest, and during the end the movie just gets weird. i would only recommend watching this if you are bored or have too much money to spend :-)",1228780800,,328,4.576271186440678
