3722670,5,B001NPK5C4,"Its about time, they put California Dreams out on DVD. I know they had issues and I'm hoping they are all figured out. The later seasons were better in my opinion, but nontheless this will make a great collection.",1237593600,,213,4.487179487179487
3722671,4,B001NPK5C4,"I am a HUGE FAN the California Dreams but seasons 1-2 are not its best material. Don't get me wrong, this 90's style high school sitcom formula is still great to watch, and the songs which this show eventually became known for were always an amazing complement to the emotions of an episode. But I really didn't enjoy anyone in the Garrison family, who were the initial focus of the show in seasons 1-2. In addition to not really relating to the parents or the little brother, I didn't particularly enjoy Matt or Jenny's singing voices either. I went on to grow fondest of the show in the seasons 3-5 when the Garrisons were written out and replaced by Lorena, Mark, and Sam, and the focus of the show was more on the band itself.

The ""California Dreams Reunited"" bonus feature sounds nice on paper but turns out to be a big dud, only ""reuniting"" Brent Gore (Matt), Jennie Kwon (Sam), Kelly Packard (Tiffani), and Michael Cade (Sly). I appreciate the effort though. These kinds of special features are really lacking from a lot of DVD's of cancelled TV shows.",1235433600,7,1060,4.578947368421052
3722672,5,B001NPK5C4,I'm so happy they finally took this out on DVD i've been waiting so long. I cant wait until it gets to my house =) I hope they take out the rest of the series it was a really good show i loved it. everyone should def buy this Lol,1235433600,,229,3.6
3722673,5,B001NPK5C4,"Growing up in the early '90s, teen sitcoms were always a pleasure to watch. But never did i expect to get laughs and good music at the same time. That is the case with CD. It's a great show with likable characters and very, very good music from Steve Tyrell. Knowing that a DVD set is finally being released, i'm going to purchase it asap. Can't wait to watch season 1 to 2, on DVD quality, after years on crappy VHS format. I can't wait to see the special features as well, especially the reunion.... Please buy this DVD set, maybe that way they'll also release seasons 3 to 5. Go Dreams!

Now that I've seen the dvds, there are a few complaints:
- as one might know already, the episode is out of order. One episode Jake is with Tiff, the other he's not.
- though not a big problem, there weren't any subtitles, i could have enjoyed subtitles.
- seeing this dvd on a flat screen is pretty bad cause it's all stretched out. unless you see it on its aspect ratio with the black bars left and right.

other than that, this is a pretty decent boxset with a nice package.

Thumbs up to Shout!

Go buy this if you're a CD fan..",1235347200,2,1123,4.185185185185185
3722674,5,B001NPK5C4,"Here's an television show which I'm glad to see coming out on dvd cause when I brought the cd by this group California Dreams and then seen them on television was wonderful Brent Gore & Michael Cade and the rest of the gang are great singers and actors the only sad part is that it's no longer on television. So buy an copy of this great sitcom.

3722675,5,B001NPK5C4,I am so glad that California Dreams is finally coming to DVD!  The wait is long overdue.  As a teenager I hated Saved by the Bell but loved the Dreams.  I cannot wait for the releases of the other seasons.,1232323200,2,205,4.075
3722676,5,B001NPK5C4,"Its been a long time coming for this series mostly because of musical rights issues. And guessing Shout Factorys record we can only pray that this is put out in its original form. If you are looking for that same comedy as Saved by the Bell this is basically the same thing (in my opinion not as great as bell though), a 90s teen series in a tropical setting. The first two seasons were pretty formulaic ending with a song from the band and having the parents more involved with the kids hijinks. But as later seasons progressed it hit is stride with teen romance abound that only Peter Engel could dream up. Here's hoping Shout Factory follows the formula and puts out seasons 3, 4, and 5 out with in a reasonable time frame. I am very greatful they took the effort to release this series.
JUST TO LET EVERYONE KNOW, SEASON 3 IS AVALIABLE FROM THE SHOUT FACTORY WEBSITE. SO ORDER NOW SO THE REMAINING TWO SEASONS WILL  BE RELEASED!",1232150400,10,932,4.4186046511627906

3722680,4,B001NPK5C4,YES I FINALLY GOT IT CALFIRONIA DREAMS ON DVD. IT HAS BEEN OFF AIR A LONG TIME IN UK THERE WAS NO SOUNDTRACK OR DVDS RELEASED IN THE SCOTLAND MUSIC STORES SO WHEN I SAW IT ON AMAZON I THOUGHT TAHNK GOODNESS.ITS ABOUT 10 OR 15 YEARS AGO CALIFORNIA DREAMS WAS CIRCULATED BUT TH VAMPED UP PACKAGE FROM SHOUT FACTORY MADE CALFIORNIA DREMAS LOOK LIKE BRAND NEW TV SHOW AGAIN. THE BONUSES OF THE DVD BOXSET WAS THE JUKE BOX FOR THE SONGS OF THE SHOW AND THE BEHIND THE PRODUCTION INTERVIEW WITH THE SHOWS STARS. THE REMARAKET WITH THE TRAILERS FROM BLOSSOM AND MY SO CALLED LIFE MADE IT A RELIC FROM THE ERA AND THE DESK TOP GRAPHICS AND EDITTING OF THE SHOW MADE ME RELIVE MY HIGH SCHOOL TEENAGE YEAR AGAIN.  I LOVE CALIFORAIA DREAMS FOR ITS FUN WACKENSS COMEDY AND IDEAS THEY HAVE ON THE SHOW. ITS VERY INVETTIVE SERIES TWO IS VERY FUNNY I THINK YOUNG PEOPLE REALLY ENJOY IT. TAKING THEM OUTSIDE OF HIGH SCHOOL AND INTO GIGS AND REHEARSALS SHOWS WHAT HAPPEND TO TEENEGERS WITH FRINEDS PIER PRESSURE FAMILY PRESSURE AND SCHOOL STREES. AS A GANG THEY COME THRU IT TOGETHER IN THERE BOND AS A BAND. IN THE SHOW ITS SET AT THE BEACH IN LA THE SURFERSS AND ADDITIONAL ACTORS AND SUPPORTING ACTORS ARE OFTEN REALLY FUNNY THERE IS ALOT OF COMEDY SURROUDING THE SURF ENVIROMENT WHICH IS LIGHT HEARTED FOR TEENS. THE SHOW HAS DIFFERENT STYLE OF PRODUCION THIS IS WHERE THE SHOUT FACTORY DONE MARVOUSLUS IN REPACKAGEING IT THEY MERGED IT BETTER MAKING IT A BETTER BLAND. THIS WOULD MAKE A FABULOUS GIFT OR MAYBE GET THE COLLECT OF SHOUT FACTORY I MAY DO THAT MY SELF AND RELIVE MY TEENAGE YEARS. GO DELIVERY AND SERVICE FROM AMAZON. AND THE STARS OF THE SHOW OFTEN DO PROMOTIONAL MARKETING AND MERCHANSING WORK FOR PUBLICITY AND THE FANS WHICH I THINK THEY SHOULD GET MORE ACKNOWLEDGEMNT FOR. IN UK THE USA STARS DONOT COME OVER MUCH. I HAVE TO SAY CALFORNIA DREAMS STARS WERE AMAZING THERE WORKING AS TEAM AND GIVING OUT REACH TO THE SHOW THEY HAD GOOD ATTITUDE FOR THAT AS TEENAGER THEY WHERE IN MAGAZINES AND TV CHANNELS LIKE TROUBLE REALLY GETTING TEENS INVOLVED SO BRILLIANT CONFIDENT TEAM THERE THEY STILL DO IT TODAY.,1340496000,,2110,4.466321243523316
3722681,5,B001NPK5C4,I know @ times this show can appear cheesy and completely unrealistic. I just love the Innocence. Innocence is something we may never get back.,1310774400,,143,4.76
3722682,5,B001NPK5C4,"For a generation of kids who grew up in the 1990's California Dreams was an important show and necessary viewing on Saturday Morning's TNBC lineup after Saved By The Bell. For these fans, the nostalgia value and memories of being kids rate out greater than any star rating Amazon would allow. We are not going to care about Peter Engel's moralistic plotlines that everything was going to be okay within the half hour, we just want to see one of the shows that provided us with so many good memories of when we could sit down on Sat. Morning without a worry in the world. On these five disks you get 26 episodes that comprise the first two seasons, every disk contains a video jukebox of all the Dreams songs during the period, and on disk five there's a special reunion featuring Brentley Gore (Matt Garrison), Kelly Packard (Tiffani Smith), Michael Cade (Sly Winkle), and Jennie Kwan (Sam Woo), talking about the experience of California Dreams. Some have been critical of the lack of Jake (Jay Anthony Frank), Tony (William James Jones), or Jenny (Heidi Noelle Lenart), but these quibbles aside, fans should be thrilled to get their favorite tv band from the early nineties on DVD at last.",1297555200,,1191,4.70334928229665

3722685,5,B001NPK5C4,"California Dreams was one of my favorite shows when I was younger and I'm so happy that they have released seasons 1 and 2. You can see a dramatic difference between Season 1 and 2 and how the show was becoming a teen show focusing on their adventures at school and the band than The Garrison family. Some great episodes and music videos(California Dreams) came from Season One: This Time, Guess Who's Coming To Brunch, and The First Gig.  I loved the Music Videos but as you can see they took them out of  Seaason 2. In Season 2, the introduction of Jake and Samantha was a great addition but I truly loved Jenny and was sad to see her leave the show, she in my opinion is the best female singer on the show. Season 2 had great episodes: Ciao, Jenny, Dirty Dogs, and Indecent Promposal.",1254009600,,787,4.346938775510204
3722686,5,B001NPK5C4,"I was so excited to find California Dreams Seasons 1 & 2 available on DVD.  I remember that it came on Saturday mornings with Saved by the Bell, and I actually liked it better.  Although seasons 1 & 2 are great, I agree with the other reviewers, that the later seasons are better.  Some of the music from this show was actually pretty good for the time period.  I have enjoyed watching these episodes, and was pleased to find that there are actually some special features included.  I particularly like the option to play all of the songs from the episodes.  I had a blast doing that.  If you remember this show, you'll want to get it, because it will bring back some good memories and some great fun, it makes me think of more carefree times.",1250553600,,743,4.37956204379562
3722687,5,B001NPK5C4,"I was 16 when California Dreams began in 1992, so the actors were part of my peer group. As I watched seasons 1 & 2, I swear, it was like being in a time warp. As the songs were performed, all of the lyrics came flooding back to me, as did all of the music and the story lines.

 The music styles are eclectic: R&B-esque (Rain), beach boys-esque (Into the Tube), metal-esque (Welcome to the Low Road), in addition to the others. Hands down, my absolute favorite song in seasons 1 & 2 is ""It's Gonna Be Rain"" performed by William James Jones (Tony Wicks). The song reminds me of an MC Hammer rap ballad called `Have You Seen Her'. `Rain' is a beautiful song. Whoever was responsible for composing the music and lyrics for the show has a lot of talent. As for the actors who sang the songs, they each have excellent voices, especially Kelly Packard and Brent Gore. Each of them has a very clear diction, so it's easy to understand the words they sing. The producers wanted to find actors that could sing in addition to being able to act. I learned that Kelly Packard had to audition 9 times and Brent Gore 5 times in order to win their roles as Tiffani and Matt!

 The band's sound in season 1 is different from the band's sound in season 2 (and the band's sound will be different at the start of season 3) because of casting changes that began at the beginning of the season 2. In season 1, the sound is kinda like beach music, ya know, the beach boys or early 1960s California beach music; it's innocent, sweet, and maybe a bit naive. But, with the introduction of Jake Sommers (Jay Anthony Franke) and Samantha Woo (Jennie Kwan) and the removal of Jenny Garrison (Heidi Noelle Lenhart), the group's sound changes enough that it is noticeable. Jenny Garrison's somewhat lower toned voice is replaced by Samantha Woo's slightly higher pitched voice (compare the women's voices in the opening theme song between season 1 & 2; a difference can be heard). The addition of Jake Sommers to the band added an additional layer, a grittier and edgier sound, to the music. Jay Anthony Franke, for the most part, actually performed his guitar solos and all of the riffs you hear in the songs, and I believe that Brent Gore also performed his guitar music (although I have not confirmed this). The other actors ""faked"" the playing of their respective instruments.

 I appreciated season(s) 1 (and 2) because the emphasis of the show was first on the Garrison family (which included parents Richard and Melody Garrison and baby brother Dennis Garrison) and then the band; this ""family"" filled a hole for me at a time when my own family unit was disintegrating, so I felt like I had an emotional connection to the Garrison family. Matt Garrison (lead guitar, vocals, lyricist) was joined by his sister Jenny (keyboard and vocals), and friends Tony (drums), Tiffani (bass guitar), and Sly (the manager). By season 2, the Garrison family was gone and Jenny had left for Rome. She was replaced by Sam (keyboard and vocals) and Jake joined the band as co-lead guitarist and co-lyricist. By the start of season 3, Jake's band responsibilities will morph.

 Matt is the nice guy who always seems to finish last. Jenny is the strong feminist who likes to call Sly a `pig' when he acts like a chauvinistic pig. Tiffani is the stereotypical surfer girl, who occasionally gets ""snaked by a shark"" and is excessively optimistic and ""too nice"". Tony and Sly are friends who compete against one another when chasing girls and are schemers, although I will say that Tony has a conscious, while Sly does not. Sam is the chatty Cathy exchange student who is in love with all of the hot, late 80s male stars like Christian Slater or Marky Mark. And lastly, Jake is the leather-clad, earring wearing, `bad biker' who attracts the `bimbos'; however, he does show his artistic side, his sensitive side, and just how easily he can be hurt. I had a crush on Jake Sommers back then; I find that today, 12-17 years later, that that crush has not weakened in the slightest.

 I cannot wait for the release of seasons 3, 4, and 5! When will the reunion take place? Rock on Jake Sommers and Jay Anthony Franke!",1244937600,,4169,4.576407506702413
3722688,5,B001NPK5C4,"California Dreams - Seasons 1 & 2 are now available on DVD. Who would ever thought this Saturday morning show would have such a strong cult following? Saved By the Bell is number 1 in my book but California Dreams was also highly addictive, the early '90s ruled! The only semi-star of this show was Kelly Packard, she was a cutie pie and she still looks the same. This show is sugary-sweet but I was born in California so I feel close to this ""trip down memory lane"" format. Check it out, you'll be hooked.",1244678400,,506,4.336842105263158
3722689,5,B001NPK5C4,"Bucking the trend for cheaply made, poorly sourced, musically replaced, or even incomplete (""Smother's Brothers"") treatments of TV series, Shout Factory has an umitigated winner here.

All the Season 1-2 episodes are present and they look great.  Thanks to Steve Tyrell, all the original music appears as well.  No rights issues here as the music was composed for and one supposes owned by the show.

Extras are sparse - outside of the ability to jump directly to the songs and a winning cast reunion - sans Jay Anthony Franke, Heidi Noelle Lenhart and William James Jones.  They are missed, especially since Ms. Lenhart and Mr. Franke are referred to more than once as having conflicts with those present.  Given the close relationship between the ""Tiffani"" and ""Jake"" characters, it would have been interesting to hear Mr. Franke's take on the relationship - both onscreen and off.

Given challenging economic times, this is one expenditure that is well worth dipping into whatever disposable income fans of the show have left.  One can't help but hope sales are brisk enough for Shout Factory to release the remaining 3 seasons.

Speaking of - here's a pre-emptive request for Shout Factory.  If season 5 is released - cast commentaries from the principals for the final episode are a must!

As for content - I tend to disagree with most here.  I believe the introduction of the romance of the ""Jake"" and ""Tiffani"" characters midway through season 2 really propelled the show, though it curiously disappeared for episodes 16 and 17 - the ""Jake"" character openly chasing after other girls while the ""Tiffani"" character watched with disinterest - only to reappear in the Season 2 ending cliffhanger (NBC clearly originally aired these epsiodes out of order).  There can be no denying, however, that Mr. Franke and Ms. Packard brought considerable chemistry to the compelling romantic escapades of these two characters.

I believe the loss of the ""Jenny"" character was significant, as I found Ms. Lenhart to be the most talented singer of the group, evidenced by her performance on Mr. Tyrell's compelling pop efforts, ""Castles on Quicksand"" and ""This Time"".  Her performance as a ""head banging mosh pit reject"" was hysterical.  As for the ""Mark Winkle"" and ""Lorena Costa"" characters - I thought Aaron Jackson was an unfortunate choice to replace Brent Gore in the vocal mix, and that their characters never really achieved the magical on-screen dynamic of the others.

THANKS to Tony Soltis - one the show's principal writers - for visiting with us here and affording us a brief snapshot into the writer's room.  While one must always listen with skepticism as all those associated with a project rant on, predictably proclaiming ""this is best thing I've ever worked on!"", it does appear that those involved here are actually speaking from the heart!",1242691200,4,2851,5.016985138004246

In the episode 21 Jake Street, he starts to date this undercover cop but then the disc ends with him and Tiffani breaking up at the prom.

3722695,5,B001NPK5C4,"It's interesting to see how much people liked the later seasons more than the first two, but speaking as a writer who worked on every episode along with Ron Solomon and Brett Dewey, it was the last few shows of the second season when Dreams hit its stride, finding its bizarre, broad tone.  I'm not sure any episode is better than the second season's western musical.  Admittedly, it's only after the Garrisons depart that we get to see Gary Beach sell used cars or that PCH's transie principal and monomaniacal vice principal appear.  I loved the actors, I loved their characters, and the shows are a reflection of the writers room's tomato fights, water guns, and barefoot dance contests late-night atop Hollywood's Gower Studios.  There were a lot of NBC-Peter Engel sitcoms going on at the time, but we were the only ones sticking Kick Me tags on Peter Engel's back at run-thrus.",1238544000,21,883,4.751633986928105
