8081546,3,B000B5LO2C,"I remember watching this in 2004, it's odd watching it back now seeing that Daniel Puder won Tough Enough only to get released soon thereafter. Meanwhile the runner-up, Mike Mizanin was the one who became a superstar.

I'm not quite sure why this dvd was even made considering what WWE got out of it (Even Christy Hemme had a longer run than Puder did) and the million-dollar tough enough contract was actually a four-year contract of 250K a year.

The documentary is about 60 minutes and brings back all the highs and lows of this edition of Tough Enough and it's very entertaining to watch. And for extras you get all of the competitions in their entirety as well as bonus funny stories, audition tapes, interviews, and a bonus Wrestlemania Recall dvd. The dvd is basically a repackaging of the Top 10 Greatest Wrestlemania matches special that was made for the Wrestlemania 20 dvd.

This dvd is kinda rare now so it's a nice video to have and if your a Miz fan (like myself) you'll enjoy watching him rise to getting first noticed in WWE.",1329436800,,1041,4.586021505376344
