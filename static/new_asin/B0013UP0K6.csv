8253023,3,B0013UP0K6,"The movie was/is entertaining, tight, and a joy - however, the film was NOT cleaned up - there are missing bits, lines, and some really bad tracking (during dance numbers this is annoying).  I've seen better clips from this movie, cleaned up. Wish the company that produced this would have found a restored version.",1442448000,,315,4.833333333333333
8253024,3,B0013UP0K6,I realize that this is a very old movie but the picture quality is terrible. I would not buy it again or suggest that anyone-else do so.,1400889600,,136,4.074074074074074
8253025,4,B0013UP0K6,"Who dusted this off the shelves? One of those classic WWII films that are not readily available and the talent is top notch. Not a period piece, but a superb opportunity to demonstrate what the soldiers on the front dreamed about. Great film.",1222300800,,242,4.651162790697675
