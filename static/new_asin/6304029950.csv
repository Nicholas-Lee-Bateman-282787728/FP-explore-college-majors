7859336,3,6304029950,"Good Morning...and Goodbye! more than most of his films represents Meyer's attempt at pre fantasy. I keep thinking of a soft core version of Shakespeare's The Tempest. As far as plotting goes everything is pretty simple.

Angel (Alaina Capri) is in a sexless marriage to Burt (Stuart Lancaster). In order to meet her sexual needs she is having an affair with Stone (Patrick Wright) who is sleeping with women all over town This affair is well known to everyone including Burt. Into the mix is thrown Burt's teenaged daughter(Karen Ciral) who is having problems with her own boyfriend Ray(Don Johnson) who is somewhat interested in Angel. A chance meeting with a wood nymph or witch (Haji) proves to be the catalyst that restores Burt's virility and his marriage.

This is not one of Meyer's best efforts and the story drags somewhat. The dialogue written by Jack Moran has that sixties dated feel but this is still Meyer and it can be quite amusing to watch. This is the fim that came before Vixen! and a change can be seen in Meyer's filming style with the material becoming more explicit.

The standard definition DVD offers the film with no extras. Of some concern is the poor transfer quality of the print but with such a minor film this is the best that we are likely to ever get. Watch it if you are a fan of Meyer or late sixties film making.",1337644800,,1349,4.589211618257261
7859337,3,6304029950,"Ribald, fast-paced, hilarious eye candy.  A worthy Meyer meditation on american marriage, sexual amorality and salvation.
Stuart Lancaster plays a successful family man who seems to have everything he could want - wealth, health, a daughter and a beautiful young wife (played by the voluptuous Alaina Capri).  Yet, all is not well in the marriage bed.  He has a problem warming up to wifey, due to her shrewish, nymphomaniac nature.  It seems she has a totally discretionless tendency to play the field.  The flaunting of her husband's inadequacies wreaks havoc on his and daughter's self-respect.  Her affair with a local brutish stud only deepens her loneliness and the wedge between her and her family.
Not to worry because a shapely forest witch (you read right),the exotic Haji, uses her tantric magic to heal Lancaster's sexual wounds and rekindle his fires.  He returns home a changed man, ready to conquer his stupid, callous rival and his wife's libido.  Buxom Go-Go dancers and two-fisted brawls keep the thrills high.
Meyer is in typical form in this soft-porn art flick (are there any truly bad Meyer movies?).  This really rates 5 by sexploitation cinema standards.  The 3 stars are only warranted in comparison to other Meyer classics like Faster Pussycat.., Beyond the Valley.. or Ultravixens.",980121600,9,1308,5.127358490566038
