8299695,4,B001EWVDJU,"A great introduction to Jarman's work, with the exception of War Requiem. The Derek documentary is very good in a way that most DVD ""special features"" are not. Combine it with Caravaggio and Wittgenstein (on Glitterbox).",1479600000,,220,5.138888888888889
8299696,4,B001EWVDJU,"Jarman five movie set.

""Sebastiane"", that is a pure homo-erotic presentation of a biblical story, was modestly removed from this public-library Australian-produced DVD set. Reviewed separately at a previous occasion.
""War Requiem""
A lyric depiction of a WorldI soldier's love to his bride.

""The last of England"" is a visionary movie of Britain of the eighties. Was reality better?

""The Tempest"" is being enriched with Jarmushian talent  that is sexulizating the already enough-vogue classic plays. An estranged magician with his family and a helper met his relatives-evictors either in reality or in dreaming while attachment to a close friend didn't allow him pardoned to return in a native city. Simple story is mistificated with drunk gender-confused characters and beautiful dancing party.

""The Jubelee"" is an explicitly-dissident work sarcastically-grotesquely depicting the UK-1977 by ushering Elithabeth I through centuries in the future and back. Perhaps, it's the most vibrant film on this disk.",1428883200,,1008,5.6490066225165565
8299697,3,B001EWVDJU,"A wizard called Radagast the Brown is keeping the nest of a dirty bird under his hat in the movie The Hobbit, an Unexpected Journey. Sometimes I think certain jokes can't be printed because they are too close to the truth about an illusion that is widely accepted for social uniformity. For me the movies in this collection are the cycle that throws in a joke about marching a regiment . . .",1359072000,,391,4.36986301369863
8299698,5,B001EWVDJU,"Through the vision of the artful eye of Derek Jarmon comes a timeless capture of known or little known characters. One cannot help but wonder if one has fallen into the rabbit hole! Dank and leaf strewn castle corridors filled with haunting visuals of mixed times, alm glued together by Shakespear's immortal writings!
I assure what you see IS what you get! Only the best in Unique and memorable interpretations.",1346544000,,412,4.9
8299699,3,B001EWVDJU,"""The Derek Jarman Collection"" is a box set containing four Jarman films.  Jarman's background was influenced by both the stuffy British public school system and the intellectual freedom of the 1960's.  He believed that art should be embedded in radical politics, and his canon of work combines political statements, avant garde styles, personal confessions, and reworkings of religious histories.
 In ""War Requiem"" (1989), Jarman interprets the six movements of Benjamin Britten's ""War Requiem"" in graphic visuals and dialogue-free tableaus illustrating war's futility, sacrifice, and waste.
 ""The Tempest"" (1979) is a version of Shakespeare's comedy that mixes Hollywood glamor, high camp, and gothic horror.  The film's finale is unforgettable.  Jarman designs and choreographs a wedding feast as a full-scale production number with Elisabeth Welch wafting her way through a chorus of hunky sailors while she belts out ""Stormy Weather.""  ""Sebastiane"" (1976) is a homoerotic retelling of the saga of the martyred Saint Sebastian, and ""Derek"" (2008) is a documentary on Jarman, who died in 1994.  Extras include three of Jarman's short films and the text of the original press kit for ""The Tempest.""",1226880000,,1199,5.549450549450549
