4462713,4,B004SGWYWE,"Demon King Daimao is about a man who wants to do good in the world, but after a personality review, is fated to become the Demon King destined to destroy everything.

The story starts out with a great deal of fanservice. The first 6 episodes of the 12 episode series consists of copious amounts of nudity, panty shots, fighting, and flirtatious girls. The series also starts out quite funny, with a constant stream of jokes as Akuto (The main character/Demon King) deals with a bunch of girls with odd personalities throwing themselves at him.

The story also drops into Anime Cliches. You have the overly jealous girl who is secretly in love with the clueless hero, the overly slutty girl who is also in love with the clueless hero, monsters, robots, and they even manage to slip in the customary beach episode that so many anime seem to include.

About halfway through story the fanservice starts to drop and it is mostly storyline and fighting. One of the best things I can say about the series is that it had a very good pace. The story moves forward well and doesn't get side tract, even with the fanservice, which is built into the story rather than beside it.

The bad things about the story is that it is very confusing to follow. The story starts out OK, but by the end you have a great deal of trouble figuring out what is going on. In the last 2 episodes several characters suddenly show up out of nowhere, and then you have battles where you have no clue who is on whose side. Even the end is confusing.

If you can put the confusing plot aside, the show is actually pretty funny. The android Kerone constantly messes with him, his friend Kena is a crazy clepto who spends most of the show naked (so she can be invisible), and his love interest borderline hates him for most of the show.

It's a fun ride for the fanservice if nothing else. I enjoyed the show. It's a complicated story and is hard to follow, but it had a better flow than the previous anime I had watched. I would probably say it is 3.5 stars, but as that is not possible, 4 it is.",1314144000,2,2060,4.37958115183246
4462714,3,B004SGWYWE,"I agree with most of the reviews here. The anime started out great. The story line was great. They had a bunch of great characters and development of them was nicely done. Then, half way through it, they picked up and rush too much information in way too fast. I seriously don't know how to explain it in words. It's like they literally didn't want to do leave the fans hanging so they finish it, but only put in all the main plots of the story in, but you would had to read the books before hand to know what's really going on because it's was on fast forward times 8!

I mainly want to say, this anime should had been two seasons, but I guess they saw there wasn't going to be another season after, and so, they had to pick and choose what to tell us to finish it. Again, this wasn't a good or bad idea. It's good for people that already know the story and bad for people that don't know it at all.

Honestly at the very end, I didn't know what was going on? It seemed like they were talking about a lot information that came up to that very point, but the thing is...they never told us anything!!! They, just skipped to the end. I'm not kidding either. It was Climax scene to climax scene to climax scene. I was left feeling ???????????? It just went from what seemed like the middle of the series to the end in one and half episodes. There were a 2 or 3 more characters that came out at the end and it seemed like they were important characters that needed to be explained. I mean, they looked super important to the whole series, but I was left feeling, okay, this guy knows everything and he talking a whole of lot information, and now I see the final battle. Who are you? Were you the main villain? Were you just the secret villain? Were you the guy that just came out of nowhere? Why are you here? Why are you fighting that dude? Ahh...I want to know! It looks cool, but I just don't know what's happening. So sad.

Also, it is confusing to know who was the good guy or bad guy in story. I kept watching it and didn't know what was going on and didn't feel anything towards the end, but confused and rip offed. It was never told who was the ""REAL Villain"" and it will never will be now. One of the main story lines was the Demon King and he like an anti-hero, but maybe, he was the villain really at the end? I don't know. I can't come to a conclusion on a show 8 times fast-forward. lol

The ending doesn't make any sense. Since, we don't know anything. How could it? It's like one minute, you're in the middle of the season and the next show your in the middle half, then the next show your at the ending. So many things weren't explained and I had no clue to what to get out of it. I could see how they got the happy ending, probably, but I don't really know if that's was supposed to be a happy ending or not. I'm just pissed!

This series could had easily been 5 stars. No problem. It just never had the chance to developed into it. Good for people that already know the story, otherwise, stay far-far away from this one. You'll be just pissed at the end.",1314057600,27,3068,4.1237458193979935
4462715,3,B004SGWYWE,"The overall show is decent. The characters are good too. Even the storyline is good. The thing that bugs me is that it feels sort of rushed. The dubbed is bad. The for some of the characters, the mouths still move even though they're are done talking (I'm seeing this all too often these days).

There are a lot of funny parts though, nudity (full frontals & all that. In some scenes, they show everything). A decent amount of sexual jokes (Both visual & conversational). Lots of explosions to boot.

All in all, it's original.
Could it have been done better? Yes, it damn well could have.

Worth buying? Yes, to pass time (but not for this price).

Character growth? Not really but enough to progress the story a bit.

For kids? HELL NO! lol",1312070400,,742,4.466666666666667
4462716,5,B004SGWYWE,The DVD was awesome! the delivery was quick and the product was packages nice and structured (it didn't budge in the box) the DVD was fun to enjoy and it had its moments of laughs.

4462717,2,B004SGWYWE,"Demon King Daimao is a true disappointment. It has likeable characters, an interesting world and starts off with a great premise in an alternate world of technology and magic. But it totally falls apart in its 2nd half, trying to fit waaaaay too much story into the last 6 episodes, getting away from what was fun about this series. It also suffers on the sub track from dubious translation and localization.

Sai Akuto, abandoned as a child at a church, is transfering to the Constant Magick Academy, the world's foremost magic school, when, following a misunderstanding, which gets us a nice panty shot, he meets fellow freshman, Junko Hattori, a girl as driven to justice as she is pretty (her family is a ninja clan, in service to the deity Suhara). Junko is impressed by the good-hearted Sai, and the two decide to become friends with the goal of improving the world. Junko doesn't take such vows lightly, and if the vow is broken, the other must kill the offender. However, Sai's dream of becoming a high priest dedicated to helping the world comes to a crashing stop when he goes for his entrance health exam with the school nurse, who also turns out to be his homeroom teacher. See, this being a magical world, it's a magical health exam by a prophetic crow which also tells you your future job profession, and has never been wrong. Sai's future career: Demon King. Naturally, everyone freaks. The last demon king 100 years ago, caused a terrible war. Needless to say, Junko, who turns out to be in his new class, isn't happy, and afterwards, just about everything Sai says is taken the wrong way, with everyone assuming and misinterpreting the worst everything Sai says or does. An enraged Junko tries to kill him, but he is helped by a flying girl, another classmate, Kena Soga, a bubbly airhead who is a sweet-natured girl (with an obsessive love of rice) who can also turn her body invisible, though not her clothing, which she has to remove to be untrackable. Entering into this mix is Korone, a female android sent to observe him from the government, and Fujiko Eto, a seemingly good girl who's actually a black mage who wants to control the future Demon King, and who keeps company with the talking head of her dead brother. Throw in the Student Council President and the 3 other girls who are on the Student Council, homeroom teacher/nurse Mitsuko Tori who keeps hoping Sai will get killed so that she can turn him into a zombie to fully examine his nature, and ""helpful"" classmate Hiroshi Miwa, whose eagerness to help the future Demon King lead to further misunderstandings, and we've got a large cast to fit into a 12 episode series, but a fun universe to explore.

Oh, the cover? Left to Right, that's green-haired Korone, red-haired Kena and blue-haired Junko.

Lot's of fun to be had here, plus fun fan service from a girl who has to get naked to be invisible, an android with a dry sense of humor, the embarassment of good and noble Junko as she's caught up in all this, plus twisted fun from ""bad"" girl Fujiko, all while exploring a great alternate universe.

And then it all collapses after about the 6th episode. Instead of concentrating on the fun aspects, they throw in a whole bunch of incomprehensible storyline about someone trying to control the gods, someone trying to destroy the gods, the gods want to destroy the Demon King, no, they created the Demon King to destroy humanity, no, humanity created the concept of the gods, blah, blah, blah. Add into the mix a murderous time traveller, another girl, this one a truly bad girl, magical ninja clan loyalties, Junko's kid sister (a ninja girl who's a media idol), Hiroshi's town's prophecy of a hero to face the Demon King, and it just is an absolute mess. The story contradicates itself, showing a young Sai declaring there's no such thing as god, compared to him wanting to be a high priest when we first met him. It's not helped by what seems to be a poorly subtitled show. For instance, it refers to omiai as being an arranged marriage, when it's actually an interview for people who are seeking an arranged marriage. Sloppy work here.

But the main problem with this show is that it first gets away from what works, harem fun in a great alternate universe, and tries to cram about 18 episodes worth of story into the last 5 episodes. You can almost see the writers and production staff saying, ""Screw re-writing this for a proper story to be told in 12 episodes, lets just pull random plot points out of our posterior for the last half of the show!"" Plot point after plot point is introduced in the last 5 episodes without any foundation whatsoever, and the show collapses under the weight of all this nonsense.

Which is a shame, since there are some fun characters here, and this was a great premise. Through the first 6 episodes I'd give it 4 stars, the last half of the series gets 1 star if I'm feeling overly generous. 2 stars doesn't begin to reveal what a mess the 2nd half of this show is. Despite some nice fan service (yes, we have bare booty and boobies, with nipples, on the gals), there are plenty of better fan service shows out there. This show is an enourmous waste of potential and a waste of some good and fun characters.",1308787200,10,5229,4.593147751605995
4462718,5,B004SGWYWE,"Demon King Daimao, (also known as Ichiban Ushiro No Dai Mao) follows the high school life of Akuto Sai, in a world in which magic not only exists, it's a normal way of life. Quiet, kind-hearted and unassuming, he hopes to become a member of the highest order of the church. However, to his horror, he finds out that he is destined to become the next Demon King. As a result, he has beautiful girls wanting to marry him or kill him. Sometimes, it's both.

The series is a short one at 12 episodes, but the storyline is quite enjoyable. Fanservice is pretty standard for a harem series, comedy peaks a lot, and the ending does leave you wanting for more. One of the biggest surprises about this release is the fact that is has an English dub. Considering Sentai Filmworks penchant for subbed-only formats, this is quite a change.

For anime fans of harem series, this is a must to own.",1308182400,16,883,4.444444444444445
4462719,5,B004SGWYWE,"If I had to shorten a review to a few words, it'd be something like this:
Maburaho meets Tengen Toppa Gurren Lagann.

The series isn't so much a departure from typical Ecchi Harem series with plots as much as it is an evolution. For only twelve episodes, one can see a fairly decent plot take shape, the resolution of the plot is a bit weak. The fan service is beyond the impossible, and the content of the action? If you're watching this for the action, then you shouldn't be disappointed.  The series itself tends to attempt to take itself seriously simultaneously not from episode eight to the end, it shows, but up and to that point, it's all fun and games, till someone gets hurt, then there are explosions.",1308009600,,712,4.511627906976744
4462720,5,B004SGWYWE,"Not gonna beat around the bush, this series combines fan service, a harem plotline, comedy and romance into a surprisingly good combination. However it's a Sentai Filmworks release which means based on their track record it will almost certainly be sub-only, more than likely with low quality audio. The series does feel a little rushed at times, but considering this is one of the few series I have seen with a happy ending I don't mind. Just one thing: the title was mistranslated. Anyone who knows some of the Japanese terminology can tell you that the current title translates to Demon King Great Demon King.",1304035200,5,612,4.838095238095238
4462721,4,B004SGWYWE,"Well I've seen the entire series from dvd/television re-encodes so I can't exactly comment on the video quality of the blu-rays, should be superior to both though.

Overall I thought the series starts off well enough, quite a few laughs throughout the first 4-5 episodes.  Also the pacing is good during this time, moving the plot along but not forcing it all out.  However, something so good will never last...

After this point it seemed as if the staff realized that ""OH S**T, we only have 12 episodes!""  and so tried to run through a lot of plot very quickly.  resulting in an almost 'jumpy' feel toward the end,  and it also seemed that they didn't have as much animation budget as they wanted (or it was all used up on breasts, not that I'm complaining).

very nice OP music and the soundtrack has some really decent songs in it.  the ED is tolerable but the animation for it seemed out of place (maybe a result of animation budget deficit, who knows).

TL;DR:  Its a decent harem/ecchi series, definitely quite funny, plot felt a bit rushed, and animation seemed a bit shy at points

overall: worth a watch",1303430400,33,1113,4.565656565656566

One other important note, is that this BluRay collection does NOT include the 6 specials. Granted, they are only 3 minute fan service type deals, but still.

4462732,2,B004SGWYWE,"WHAT I DO NOT LIKE IS THAT AMAZON IS CENSORING REVIEWS - Demon King Daimao is yet another anime with way to much perv and too little plot. They have a good idea in a kid who is the reincarnated soul of the Demon King who has come back to the earth once more, but he is not evil. He is just a kid who wants an education at the most prestigious school in the land. And like all anime in the last 6-7 years (and many before that), the perv factor starts from there.

However, I would recommend you try to find it on instant view before purchasing the dvd or blue ray set. Even though my husband loved it, I personally don't feel the story quality was worth the price. I do agree with him on the animation quality.

Be warned that the series is not suitable for children due to all the fan service and if you're unfamiliar with the term then let me explain.

4462762,4,B004SGWYWE,"This release of Daimao in my opinion is very modest. It contains all of the episodes with minimal extras to offer.

It comes on two disks, with a different background image for each main menu. Also, there is no music on the main menu. Not really a big deal I suppose, but would have been nice.

The extras include production sketches (drawings of characters with a soundtrack playing in the back), clean opening and closing animation (the intro and ending with no credits over the images) and trailers for other Sentai releases.

So, as far as extra meat on the release..it isn't anything too special. But, depending on how much of a fan you may be, this could mean nothing to you.

The picture quality is awesome. It has a very sharp look to it and often times very bright coloring. It looks great and the sound is also very good. One thing I did find odd is that this is considered an ""uncensored version"". I first saw this show on netflix, which after watching it again with this release, I saw no difference. My assumption is that a lot of breast had been edited out of the censored version. There are two scenes that depict frontal genital nudity (both male and female) that are still blocked on this version. In all likely hood that was how the show was actually made, but for those that know which scenes I'm talking about, they are in fact still censored in this.

Despite the modest features of this product, the show is very humorous. If you've seen it before and are considering owning it, this is the way to go. It really does look great. Though if you haven't seen it, I recommend watching it on netflix or somewhere first. The story starts great but ends up leaving something to be desired.

4462767,4,B004SGWYWE,"Akuto Sai wants to be a high ranking magician and serve his country with honor. He enters the Constant Magic Academy, where he learns that he will one day become the Demon King. This makes him very popular with the girls, and unpopular with the guys that want power. He is constantly trying to keep his morality in check by resisting the chicks advances. He is also having to fight off the droves of monsters that are constantly attacking. He's gonna have a hard time achieving his dream, and staying alive.

This anime has really good production quality. The animation, voice acting, and soundtrack are all really well done. The story is fun, funny, and really perverted. There is a lot of nudity, and pervy stuff. Needless to say there isn't much of a plot in this anime, but it's fun. It doesn't really need one. Where most of these harem animes get a little more heated up at the end, I sort of felt a little let down at the end of this one. The characters are developed pretty well for a short series, but the drama at the end falls a little short. Despite this, it's still pretty much fun. I think it's a good watch if you enjoyed stuff like To Love Ru, Kampfer, or Is This A Zombie, you'll probably like this series.",1361404800,2,1223,4.387665198237886

4462774,4,B004SGWYWE,"I do not know why but that line had me laughing. This is one of the few Harem types that I liked. English voices were outstanding and being a fan service anime there is nudity and panty shots all over the place but the story is much more.
 Akuto Sai wants to be a priest but he is told in front everyone at school that he is prophesied to be the Demon King.
Hence the trouble ensues and people are afraid while others are attracted to him.
 This has a nice balance of action and comedy while Chris Patton does an incredible job with the English voice. As far as the disc goes this is bright and crisp bluray and the animation is above average pretty much for the whole series.
 Now will you like this....I do not know as it all comes down to personal tastes. It is definitely worth a watch...stream it,then decide, I know Crunchyroll has it for free and Netflix has it as well, just not free.",1340064000,2,892,4.204678362573099
4462775,2,B004SGWYWE,"Most disappointing anime title I have ever owned.

let's put aside any review of the storyline, characters or content of the actual show. I am not here to give another review of 'will you like daimaoh?' I am here to talk about the bluray and the bluray released in america.

Daimaoh was originally licensed for streaming by crunchyroll in America. In fact, you can legally watch it right now, all 12 episodes, online at the crunchyroll website or if you have an anime network subscription (they are owned by sentai films who is selling this bluray)watch it there too.

So that brings the question why would anyone want to own this mediocre show that can be watched online for free? Well the bluray should be better quality right? uncensored extra content not available elsewhere?

The japanese bluray content included the 12 episodes plus 6 never before seen specials called Another Extra Daimaoh specials. It also included music videos, original commercials and bonus CDs if you bought the limited editions. So we should get all the same on the North American release, right?

No, that's not right, we don't get crap. Oh wait we got some advertisements for future releases. oh, and the original show is uncensored, like 3 scenes had the little foggy clouds removed. That is what you paid 40$ for, was that.

You know, sometimes I just don't understand. I have been doing my best to support the anime industry for more than twenty years now but sometimes I wonder who am I working hard for? certainly it's not for me, I just purchased an authentic copy of a bluray and half the content is missing.

Maybe the Japanese companies expect us all to be pirates? Am I supposed to pay for half the bluray now and download the rest? Or is it both companies just trying to cash and run as much as possible? I understand the world is changing and the Japanese industry needs to protect reverse importation and Sentai films needs to keep prices low but omitting content, 'especially new never before seen content' is like going to mcdonalds and getting half a cheeseburger.

As for me, I am done. I will not pay full price for another bluray. Interestingly enough, the exact same thing is happening with sora no otoshimono. It's a good thing I did not get around to buying the first season before they announced that. I hate to say it, but the Japanese licensing companies need to learn a very hard lesson and  sadly, it's going to be the American ones who end up taking all the damage up front.",1327968000,18,2484,4.640091116173121
4462776,4,B004SGWYWE,The show is all around good enjoyable and comedic but the plot is shot through so fast there are times you are done with an episode and left with a more questions than answers.  a good show if you are looking for comedy and romance but needed more than 12 episodes.,1327881600,,265,4.196078431372549
4462777,1,B004SGWYWE,"To be entirely fair, my experience with this series is the U.S. released, English dubbed version. I want to be as objective as possible, but in 20+ years of enjoying anime of multiple genres, I can honestly say that in my personal experience, only a few have gone from mediocre to terrible so fast.

Demon King Daimao/Ichiban Ushiro no Dai Mao is a story about Akuto Sai, a nice guy attending a magical school, where he is saddled with the predicted future role of being the destructive Demon King. Cue the fights, school-age romance elements, lots of nudity... and more fights. Obviously, this anime is supposed to be a silly T&A romp like many others. It starts out with a predictable and fun enough premise, and a handful of interesting characters. Gratuitous nudity and sexual situations are par for the course, flirting at the edge of soft-core anime porn at times.

All of that is fine, if you know what you're getting into with a series like this. What blew me away was the sudden drop from mediocre and silly fun to abysmal, confusing nonsense. Demon King Daimao was not a unique and outstanding series to begin with - it seems to take a piece from every anime sub-genre stereotype and slap them all together. Shojo meets occult, adds mecha, and showers in fan service.

But after the first half of the series, the episodes become a giant cluster of new plots and characters crammed on top of each other. The plots randomly multiply without explanation, add some jargon, roles and terminology that are never explained, and all before you can pause and scratch your head.

Add to this the fact that somehow, the writing/dialogue gets progressively worse than ever before, until the seriously said line: ""It makes me cry demon king tears"" slayed me and made me stop very near the end of the series. Wow. I didn't pay to watch this series, and I am relieved. There are so many entertaining, equally gratuitous series out there that won't let the viewer down like this. What were the writers thinking?",1327017600,2,2005,4.703703703703703
4462778,4,B004SGWYWE,"Ghost in the Shell this is not!

If I had to summarize this series I would say that it about mystical warriors & panties . . .  Lot's and lot's of panties!

They could have just as easily have called this show ""the sneaky king of the pantie-babe high-school"".  Don't watch this while laying in a waterbed.  It jiggles enough already.  That summarizes how seriously to take this, but that does not mean it is not enjoyable.  Just be prepared to laugh

Its short, and it becomes worse after Ep. 5-7
