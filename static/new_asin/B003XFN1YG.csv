A great movie for kids today who take everything for granted. It gives them a look at how people during this time period lived and how many families are still living today. Makes you feel very grateful for what you have, not what you don't.",1325980800,,357,4.424242424242424
4216410,5,B003XFN1YG,"When I saw this movie on TV last year, I felt like I had been in some of the areas.  Literally.
I was born and raised in Toronto. My maternal grandmother worked for Timothy Eaton himself. I remember one special day that my mother took me to see Eaton's Christmas windows. I remember also going up in the elevator with the Porter calling off the floor number coming up and listing all the items that could be purchased on that floor. I wanted that job when I grew up! Back then that was a once in a life time trip even for one living in Toronto.

So..after seeing this movie, which brought back good memories of growing up, I just had to have the DVD, so as I could watch it every Christmas thereafter.

The movie takes place during the Depression. My mom says it was a difficult time for everyone. This says a lot, as I not having grown up during this time, remember there were times that we had very little to eat and Christmas gifts being an orange and a cookie.  So the Depression years must have been truly a hardship.

Booky and her family are affected by the Depression.  Her mom (Megan Follows) rallies the children together to tell them that their father is without work; they would have to be understanding and help out during this time. The family shows gumption and have an attitude that we'll deal with whatever comes our way; we'll get through this.

Booky believes that there is a real Santa, the Eaton's Santa; Christmas will be the same.
Watch this charming movie to see how Booky is able to bring this about.

A great movie for the whole family. Will make one be thankful for what they do have - not things but family and friends.

There are two other 'Booky' movies, I've yet to find available on DVD.  'Booky's Crush' and 'Booky Makes Her Mark'.",1324339200,,1764,4.383435582822086
4216411,5,B003XFN1YG,This is a Canadian made for tv movie filmed in 2007 but the setting was during the depression so it kinda looks old. But don't let this fool you. This is one of the best Christmas movies I've seen besides it's A Wonderful Life. Booky is one determined girl(she was at the right place at the right time)who wants the best Christmas for her family and even her friend even though times are tough and her father lost his job. It has a good moral lesson. Perfect for the whole family to watch!,1320192000,3,489,4.268817204301075
4216412,4,B003XFN1YG,"I collect Christmas movies, but I am very selective in what I collect.  This definitely went in my Christmas collection.  It is good for the entire family: clean and has a great moral lesson.  It is not overly Christmas-sy but it is a great addition to my collection.  It kept the kids interest and is deep enough for adults.",1312675200,4,325,4.4576271186440675
4216413,3,B003XFN1YG,"As a Christmas Movie collector I sometimes get loosers when I purchase movies I don't know anything about. This movie was pretty good, better than I expected.",1296691200,,158,4.888888888888889
4216414,5,B003XFN1YG,"I have been a long-time fan of Megan Follows for her portrayal of Anne Shirley in Anne of Green Gables (a classic and beloved period drama). When I saw that she was featured in this movie, I was eager to watch it. The Christmas theme also appealed to me as it is the holiday season and I thought this would be wholesome family entertainment that I could share with my husband and kindergartner. We were not disappointed as this turned out to be a charming and poignant period drama.

The movie is set in 1930s Toronto and features young Beatrice ""Booky"" Thomson (Rachel Marcus) whose father (Stuart Hughes) loses his job during the holiday period. He is at wits' end trying to figure out how to support his wife (played by Anne of Green Gables' Megan Follows) and four children. Booky works as the sampler girl (providing free nut samples) at her aunt's Nut Shoppe. She meets and befriends `Santa' (Kenneth Walsh), a nice man who plays Santa Claus in the city's annual Christmas parade. The story shows us how Booky and her family get through this difficult period with their dignity and sense of family intact.

Booky's best friend Laura comes from a rich family and her mother is a rich snob who does not want Laura playing with Booky anymore because she feels Booky is not the `right' sort of friend for her. I loved how Booky's mom explains to Booky why she cannot see Laura outside of school anymore, it is done in such a gentle manner. Things sort themselves out in the end, and the story is just one of those wonderful Christmas tales that inspire and makes one give thanks for the blessings in one's life. The story is based on Bernice Thurman Hunter's Booky series, and I plan on checking out the other movies in the series.",1293148800,11,1733,4.533546325878595

8408076,4,B003XFN1YG,"This is a very colorful sweet tale of a delightful little girl named Booky. We enjoyed the movie and would recommend it. An added bonus is the mom is played by Megan Follows of Anne of Green Gables. My only disappointment with this story is that there is no mention of the true meaning of Christmas. Too much emphasis is put on the material end. However, there is a good portrayal of kindness and generosity in regard to Booky's desire to make others happy. Worth a watch for a Christmas movie.",1382140800,,494,4.43956043956044
