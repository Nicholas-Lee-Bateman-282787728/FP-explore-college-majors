In this way, this work is novel.  The characters use an interesting mix of West Indian, African-American, and working-class British slang.  If you liked ""8 Mile"" or ""Beat Street,"" then you should take a look at this.
One person dismissed this as a ""disguised chick flick.""  There is a romance story here.  However, I think the point is to bring  up Capulet vs. Montague tensions.  I liked the black-on-black love here.  Unlike the US with our Halles and Rihannas, the ingenue of this film has rich, chocolate skin.  I like that this film did not demand that female beauty must be light-skinned.  If you liked the couples in ""Love Jones"" or ""Brown Sugar,"" then you will like the couple here.
This film was much softer or less edgy than ""Kidulthood,"" a film showing a similar demographic.  I wonder if this film was for middle school and high school students whereas ""Kidulthood"" was for high school students and those older.  This film didn't have that dark, angsty, pessimistic vibe of the other film.
Every character throws around the term ""I'n'it?"" to the point of nauseum.  This work has characters that lived as foster kids in their past.  You don't see that group often in film.  I appreciated that novelty.  I think many will love the soundtrack of the film.",1260748800,2,1415,4.686991869918699
