8356616,5,B0028PTT9I,"Several years ago I stumbled upon Vanessa da Mata and several other international singers, most from Brazil.  I have come across many of Vanessa's performances online, but this DVD is Vanessa at her best!  She seems very energetic and comfortable performing.  Her Carribean-style songs were even more improved (with different instrument arrangements and ad-libs) than their original studio-recorded version.

Although most of these videos can be found on YouTube, it just feels better having my own DVD representing her best performances.  A bonus documentary (with English captions available) of her tour is included, which gives you a sense of her good nature, personality, and her band-mates interactions with her.",1421625600,,717,5.541284403669724
8356617,5,B0028PTT9I,"Besides making wonderful music, Vanessa da Mata radiates beauty and a joy that captivates her audience. Her musicians are first rate, making for an excellent performance. They all 'feel' the music and appear to love what they do with a desire to share this joy without the fake ""superstar syndrome"" of many of today's popular elitist artists. The wide range of material, included in good sequence, makes the concert even more captivating. Beautiful set design and location, excellent camera work, and fine audio quality combine to make this a DVD that you must have. Kudos to the production team that captured the excitement of the live concert with excellent audio and visual quality. Additionally, I found the extras on the DVD to be interesting and enlightening, too. Beautiful!",1268438400,4,781,5.109375
