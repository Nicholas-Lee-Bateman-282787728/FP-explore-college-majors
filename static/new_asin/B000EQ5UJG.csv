2529572,1,B000EQ5UJG,terrible production and really not interesting for small kids. I regret this purchase. Why is it that there are only 2 options for this story? Absolutely crap! Come on Amazon for 2.99 you could do better.,1373328000,,204,4.694444444444445
2529573,1,B000EQ5UJG,"She was very cute as a child but I didn't like this movie, I will keep watching the younger days movies and just stick to those.",1362355200,2,128,3.9615384615384617
2529574,5,B000EQ5UJG,Great babysitter. My daughter loves watching these grown ups act out in theater like performances the stories from preschool story books. It's interesting as well to see the movie stars of my youth in the plays and guess who they are by voices as they appear in these plays in costume. Very neat.,1322265600,7,296,4.60377358490566
2529575,4,B000EQ5UJG,"""Shirley Temple's Storybook"" was a successful television series (that ran in colour on NBC between 1958 and 1961) where Miss Temple hosted and more often than not, starred in, adaptations of fairy tale classics and other works of children's literature. Serving as the precursor to other shows like ""Faerie Tale Theatre"" and ""Tall Tales and Legends"", ""Shirley Temple's Storybook"" boasted a galaxy of stars from stage and screen, elaborate production values and lavish costumes. The series later ran in syndication under the ""Shirley Temple Show"" title.

In ""The Little Mermaid"", Shirley Temple stars in the title role. Based on Hans Christian Andersen's tender fairytale of selfless love and sacrifice. While living in a kingdom at the bottom of the ocean can be very pretty, the Little Mermaid feels there is something more that life has in store for her. During a brief visit to the surface, she rescues and falls in love with a handsome prince (Donald Harron), and vows to become a human. A bargain with the Merwitch (Nina Foch) is the obvious answer to her dilemma, but will the Little Mermaid risk her very life to become part of the prince's world?...

Shirley Temple brings a lot of depth and feeling to her portrayal of the title role. Legendary actress Cathleen Nesbitt plays dear Granny Mermaid to perfection. With Nancy Kulp, John Hoyt, J. Pat O'Malley, Torin Thatcher, Ray Walston and Francine York. Original air-date 5th March 1961. Adapted from the Hans Christian Andersen fairytale by Bernard C. Schoenfeld.",1244592000,9,1521,5.055776892430279

8113215,3,B000EQ5UJG,"It's hard to judge something like this, because it's so dated. Very sweet retelling of the classic tale that extremely young children might enjoy. Fans of vintage tv will appreciate the underwater design and costumes. Shirley Temple is all grown up in this version, so if you are looking for ""tiny child"" Shirley you will probably be somewhat shocked that this is NOTHING like that. The cast has fun in what feels like a pre cursor to Fairie Tale Theater. An interesting piece of trivia is that Nina Foch, who plays the Sea With in this version also played Moses' mother in Cecil B. DeMille's The Ten Commandments.",1502409600,2,614,4.694444444444445
