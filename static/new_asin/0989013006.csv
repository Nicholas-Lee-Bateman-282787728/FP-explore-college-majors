7795371,5,0989013006,"These videos are a great introduction to or supplement to training in CBT-I. Donn Posner is a terrific therapist to observe ... he's clearly very knowledgeable in CBT-I and provides the therapy in a warm and relaxed manner. The DVDs are organized in a logical way so it's easy to skip around to particular topics that one would like to review (e.g., using the menu and scene selector). The example patient is believable and asks very relevant questions (questions that I have heard come up many times as a CBT-I therapist, and hearing Dr. Posner's responses was very helpful). This is one of the best therapy resources I have come across and I will certainly be referencing it regularly for tips and to stay sharp as I administer CBT-I.",1377648000,,736,4.713178294573644
7795372,5,0989013006,"This DVD set is an excellent resource for anyone who is practicing CBTI, especially in the early stages or if it is only one part of your practice and isn't used regularly.  The video captures all of the elements of CBTI, and, along with the book (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Cognitive-Behavioral-Treatment-of-Insomnia-A-Session-by-Session-Guide/dp/0387774408/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Cognitive Behavioral Treatment of Insomnia: A Session-by-Session Guide</a>), gives a clinician a very clear guide for how to provide this treatment.

I especially like that each session is broken up into parts in the menu, and using the scene selector, I can find how to present the information that I am looking for.  For example, if I forget the 4P model (which, if you've attended the live training, you probably will never do!), you can jump right to it.  I also like that many of the items are repeated in several areas, which is both true to the treatment, but also gives you several ways of seeing it presented and helps you to craft your own style.

This DVD set is definitely best used in conjunction with the CBTI book, there is important information and therapeutic notes that are not in these DVDs that one needs to have in their minds while delivering this treatment.  At the same time, the DVD answers the question, ""how would I actually explain this to a person?"" that the book doesn't answer on its own.",1373587200,2,1448,5.273913043478261
7795373,5,0989013006,"This series of 8 CBT-I video sessions can really make any CBT-I manual or training course come alive through listening in and watching interactions between a real expert clinician and a mock patient. Hearing from two experts who introduce each session with key tips from their clinical experience was an added bonus. Even after watching these vignettes that demonstrate how CBT-I is done - with just a whiteboard, a calculator, and some silly putty metaphors - it will stay on my bookshelf to periodically review and keep my clinical skills fresh.",1373500800,,547,5.021978021978022
7795374,5,0989013006,"Wow. Carve out a lot of time to watch this video cause there is a TON of information shared! If you are just learning about CBTI, the video vignettes provide step by step directions on how to structure your CBTI sessions with clients. In solo, the video is not enough foundation for starting CBTI in your practice (nor is it intended to be), but it's a great addition to other trainings/readings. Even if you already provide CBTI (like myself, as a licensed social worker), this video has many suggestions for improving your practice such as how to best sell CBTI to clients, monitoring/charting client progress, and how to access additional trainings/supervision specifically for CBTI.

An advantage of this video, in comparison to the 3 day CBTI training with Dr. Perlis and Dr. Posner (although I attended the 3 day training a few years ago, found it instrumental in learning how to provide CBTI, and I highly recommend attending), is you can stop and replay the video as many times as you want so you never miss an important point. You can also space your video viewing out over time so you can process the material, practice a new skill, and replay sessions you are having difficulty with. One disadvantage of the video is when wanting to replay a scene the scene selection process is laborious. However, the sleeping dog that is snoring in the background of the vignettes offered me comic relief to overcome any frustration.

Parts of the video that were particularly helpful included discussions about: the 4 P's (I only knew of the 3P model), the misalignment between sleep ability and sleep opportunity, sleep efficiency and setting new bed times, preventing sleep fragmentations (the silly putty example), cognitive treatment (the catastrophic thought exercise), sharing pre/post treatment data, and post treatment recommendations.

I think the most advantageous part of the video is observing Dr. Posner (who is a very skilled clinician with many years of CBTI experience) provide treatment in the vignettes. He shares many tricks from his clinical grab bag on how to deal with client worry/resistance to CBTI, explaining the possible reasons for insomnia becoming chronic, and offers many concrete examples of what clients can do to cope/comply with difficult aspects of CBTI treatment (including: what to do when out of bed at night, how to stay awake until bedtime, and how to cope with daytime fatigue/impairment).

The only other disadvantage to the video (aside for the scene selection process) is not being able to see the paperwork the client completes or Dr. Posner's writing on the whiteboard during the mock treatment sessions (either the pens are running out of ink or the whiteboard glare makes it difficult to view Dr. Posner's diagrams/charting on the whiteboard). Otherwise, I highly recommend this video to supplement your CBTI training and improve your CBTI practice.",1371945600,3,2896,5.090526315789473
