4311136,4,B004AUCDOW,"The Pokemon movie series got off to a rocky start with some rather mediocre efforts that only appealed to young fans whose tastes are less discerning. The animation was hardly better than the television cartoons and the plots were anemic and forgettable. The first movie was a box office smash in the U.S. but by the fourth movie it was being sent straight to DVD. Meanwhile in Japan the movies continued to hit the theaters even while the box office grosses sagged. It was with the three Diamond/Pearl movies that the sales really took off with Arceus and the Jewel of Life being the highest grossing animated movie in Japan for the year 2009. The increased sales can be directly attributed to the superior quality of the animation, writing and music of the series. These weren't just great Pokemon movies they were great anime. The battles between Palkia and Dialga are absolutely epic and with the previous film Giratina joined into the fray and now Arceus has arrived. So does this film live up to the standards of the previous two? Let's just say it has issues.

I was looking forward to seeing the introduction of Arceus, the Alpha Pokemon, and the ""Original One"". As cool as Palkia and Dialga were surely Arceus would exceed and then... he spoke. What in the world was Universal Pictures thinking in casting the voice actor? The closest I can describe it would be to say that Arceus sounds like Cobra Commander and that is not a good thing for the God Pokemon to sound like. It is absolutely grating and distracting and it's a shame that the American dubbing could so badly spoil the movie.

Anyway, we finally get an explanation of why Palkia, Dialga and Giratina have been duking it out the last two films and thanks to a young lady with some very special powers the three have finally made peace and all is well in the world... for about two seconds. Arceus has returned after decades of healing to wreak havoc on the world for its betrayal. The three Pokemon gods of time, space and dimensions stand up to the Alpha Pokemon but even those three are no match and are left to just try and defend as long as possible. With no ability to defeat Arceus, Palkia uses his control of time to send Ash and crew to the past in order to find out the secret of the betrayal which has so enraged Arceus.

Of the three Diamond/Pearl movies I found this one to be the weakest with the voice acting given to Arceus being the main deficit. Still, it completes the trilogy and if you love Pokemon it's not a bad addition. Personally I've never once purchased a Pokemon movie and wouldn't be interested in owning any but there are worse ways to waste 95 minutes if you find it available for viewing.",1293580800,3,2691,4.532921810699588

4311188,4,B004AUCDOW,"I actually find this movie entertaining in the fact that they for once address the time when Pokemon lived with humans as servants rather than the beloved companions they are frequently protrayed as in the anime. It's interesting to see that ancient humans fear or don't fully comprehend the mysterious powers Pokemon have and call them ""Magical Creatures"" (which is adorable) in reference to this.",1359590400,,398,5.138461538461539

4311190,5,B004AUCDOW,My son wanted this movie for his birthday.  We were excited to see it on Amazon.  It was in good conditon and played perfectly.,1338163200,,127,4.25
4311191,4,B004AUCDOW,"I would like to start off this review saying this: this film isn't the worst in the franchise, nor is it the best.

The plot of this film is interesting in that it leads up to the Poke'mon God Arceus' appearance by making references to past movies. As it turns out, the approaching awakening of Arceus was what initiated the events in The Rise of Darkrai as well as Giratina and the Sky Warrior. The other legendaries of Sinnoh (Dialga, Palkia and Giratina) also make appearances in this film as the conflict between the Sinnoh Dragons all comes to a head with Arceus awakening and returning to Earth, seeking revenge against humanity after it was seemingly betrayed by a human it had trusted with its life. While Dialga, Palkia and Giratina fight Arceus off, Dialga sends Ash and his friends as well as the character Sheena (a descendant of the human who betrayed Arceus) into the past to find out what really happened and correct it before Arceus destroys humankind.

The plot itself begins in a fast-paced fashion but slowly grinds to a halt at several points. We're treated to flashbacks, Poke'mon being cute and other such scenes that drag on for quite a while making parts of the movie rather boring. The villain of this movie is incredibly obvious, which seems to be a running theme in the films now; however the villain's motive is more sympathetic than it usually is for other villains in the other movies. The characters introduced to us for the movie are all well voiced (particularly Dan Green voicing Damos), but not particularly interesting. They don't get out from the background much other than to move the plot along. The film continuously cuts back to the much more interesting fight ensuing between the 3 Sinnoh Dragons and Arceus, and I found myself wishing that was the focus instead.

As others have said a huge problem with the dub for this movie is the voice casting. While the main cast doesn't do a terrible job, Arceus, the central character of this film, was given a VERY annoying voice. He comes off as hotheaded and whiny as opposed to sympathetic and impressive as a betrayed deity. Even before he arrives on Earth you find yourself wishing he was mute like the other Sinnoh Legendaries. He also isn't very likeable as a character. The best voice actor in the film, Dan Green, voices Damos, the secondary character of this film. (Having voiced legendary Poke'mon in other films in this franchise such as Mewtwo and Entei, it makes one wonder why he wasn't chosen to voice Arceus instead.)

One thing that is also irritating about this film is the way they chose to pronounce Arceus' name. In the English dub it's spoken as ""Ar-kee-us"" instead of ""Ar-sea-us"". ""Arkeeus"" is not only a translation goof but it makes it even harder to take Arceus seriously as a ""Poke'mon God"" with such a silly-sounding name.

The visuals in this film are very appealing, much like the other movies. Unfortunately there is a LOT of CGI in this film and it's used more for the scenery than it is the action scenes. The music is also pleasing to listen to for the most part.

In short, if you're a fan of the movies, you'll probably enjoy this. If you can get past the fact the title character of the film is a bitter, arrogant prick of a Poke'mon, you should be able to enjoy the film for the battles and visuals. It'll definitely keep the kids entertained.",1326326400,,3367,4.640939597315437
4311192,3,B004AUCDOW,"At the beginning of the film, Ash and his friends arrive in Michina.  They quickly find themselves in the middle of a conflict between Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina.  Ash, Dawn, Brock, Pikachu and Piplup are saved by Sheena, a young woman who is able to connect with the hearts of Pokemon.  She and her assistant, Kevin, explain that the conflict is due to Arceus (a Legendary Pokemon) being close to awakening.  Sheena also explains that her ancestor, Damos, had betrayed Arceus and took the Jewel of Life.  When Arceus returns, Sheena plans to return the Jewel of Life to the Pokemon.

Arceus awakens from its slumber and returns to Earth.  When Sheena tries to return the jewel, Arceus realizes that it's a fake and destroys it.  Arceus goes into a rage, and Dialga, Palkia, and Giratina arrive to try and stop Arceus.  Dialga, the Pokemon of Time, sends everyone except Kevin back in time to the point where Damos is supposed to return the jewel to Arceus; Dialga hopes that by doing this, the past can be altered.  Can Ash and his friends make a difference in the past in order to correct the future?

When it comes to the animation in the film, there were attempts to try and combine traditional animation with computer graphics.  Unfortunately, the two elements did not blend together very well, and the computer graphics drew too much attention to itself.  Also, there were times when I thought that the computer graphics were being used for things that really didn't need computer graphics (such as plants and trees).  However, I did enjoy the musical score.  The story itself was decent, and it's basically the type of story fans of Pokemon have come to expect from the films for the franchise.

Arceus and the Jewel of Life was released as a single disc DVD.  On the disc, you can watch the film, use the setup menu to choose if you want to have English subtitles and which English audio option you want, and you can choose where in the film you want to start watching.  When it comes to the subtitles, this disc includes a way to turn them off in the menu if your player decides to default to showing the English subtitles.

Like the previous two DVD releases of the Pokemon films, Arceus and the Jewel of Life does not include any special features.  This DVD is priced to run the same amount as a DVD release that includes bonus features.  Personally, I would recommend buying a copy of Arceus and the Jewel of Life if you can find it somewhere that's selling it for under $15.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD through the King County Library System.",1306800000,4,2594,4.557235421166307

When you think of God of ANYTHING you think of a booming low voice filled with wisdom....this guy's voice was high pitched and he sounded like a Villain instead of someone who was tricked into believing he was betrayed.
