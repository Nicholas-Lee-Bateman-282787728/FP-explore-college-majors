8043809,3,B0006Z2NQS,"A few awesome views of the falls, but this is not really a DVD for those who simply wish to have a souvenir of a trip to Niagara Falls. There's a little bit of human history in this, such as people who tempted the Falls by voluntarily going over them in various contraptions, but there is a much heavier emphasis on what science can (and cannot) tell us about the Falls--such as how old the Falls are, how they were formed, how fast they have receded, and what their future is (their future is a little sad, but none of us will live to see it). The DVD also spends several minutes on men whose job is to rescue those who are injured--intentionally or not--near the Falls or in the Niagara River Gorge. Then there's also a few minutes devoted to a couple of ""waterfall hunters"" who explore the Niagara River's tributaries for undiscovered waterfalls, which frankly seems out of place in this DVD about Niagara Falls. The whole ""movie"" is only 55 minutes long, and the only extra is a gallery of still shots. Since I didn't have to pay a lot for it, it was worth the price. I would have felt ripped off if I have paid $15 - $20.",1441497600,,1126,4.291079812206573

8043814,5,B0006Z2NQS,"""Niagara Falls: Raging Rapids"" gives a secular point of view of the history of the erosion of the falls and the region. It brings up the evolutionists ridiculous timeline of ancient times at the falls and ignores the Biblical, true creationist timeline of history of the falls. But includes nice pictures and sounds of the power of the waterfalls that makes it well worth buying and viewing over and over again!",1375488000,4,411,4.802816901408451
