8488398,4,B005X8L0HG,"I also purchased the companion book (Working Wood 1&2). Having the book really makes the package complete.  Paul does an excellent job of explaining the basics to the beginner.  Some of the transitional video production is over the top but overall I say buy it if you're new to working with hand tools and want to get your feet wet knocking out some projects.  The video and teaching method is project based.  He starts you off carving a spatula, a spoon and then moves on to carving a nut bowl and concludes with making a three legged stool with some nice functional and aesthetic touches.",1423008000,4,590,4.59047619047619
