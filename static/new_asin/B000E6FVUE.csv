8106704,3,B000E6FVUE,"I recently picked up a copy of this video hoping to get a balanced view of the creation/evolution debate.  I was very interested to see what the World Wide Church of God (a formerly cultic, pseudo-Christian group that is now theologically evangelical) would do.

Despite the now evangelical and orthodox views of the WWCG, the video did not properly address certain issues.  One of my main problems with the video is that it presented a one-sided view from one geologist about the age of rock strata and the age of the earth.  Why didn't the producers ALSO have some geologists from the Creation Science side to explain why they feel, from a scientific perspective, the earth is not as old as some say?

The narrator simply accepted the CLAIM by the one geologist that the strata were millions or billions of years old.  He didn't bother to even ask HOW this geologist knew this.  Why wasn't this valid question asked?

Now with that said, the video does make a more balanced attempt to show that evolution has problems and that the idea of intelligent design is a plausible way to interpret the scientific data.

What was also good is the fact that the narrator pointed out, as I also believe, that the Bible has been misinterpreted to say that the earth is only a few thousand years old.  But that is not to say that because of this, the scientists who say the earth is millions or billions of years old must be correct.  There IS evidence to the contrary, but that was not explored at all (only mentioned) in the video.

I enjoyed the overall presentation of the video and what the producers demonstrated.  I do feel, however, that it would have been a better video had they addressed the age of the earth issue in a more balanced and fair fashion.  We as Christians cannot blindly accept or reject what science has to say, and if there is credible evidence that suggests a younger earth, if there is evidence that dating techniques have fatal flaws, then it seems reasonable to me that these should have been addressed in the video as well.

Personally the age of the universe or the earth has no bearing on my faith whatsoever.  I could care less.  But for some people, the Bible's veracity stands or falls on what some scientists say.  Next time, the WWCG should be more balanced in its presentation of the facts.  So I can recommend the video, but with caution.",1190764800,5,2368,4.568720379146919
