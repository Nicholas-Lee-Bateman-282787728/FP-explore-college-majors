The story may come across as strange, bizarre or otherwise ""out there"" for those that haven't pursued knowledge in some way to address their own curiosities of existence.
The comedy is also excellent. The moments aren't many, but they are good. The music was a great match to the plot. I had never heard of the artists involved and was lucky to find some of the music on eBay, as it is out of production.
It's a story about one person's struggle to understand himself, his surroundings and the struggle to meaningfully interact with others, a struggle given that they continue with the same habits that he's tried to kick.
I loved it. :-D
I wish I could get it in DVD or digital format!",1333065600,,814,4.54421768707483
8304326,5,6303953662,"I, like most people in the reviews you've probably already read, happend upon this movie by total chance. I was flipping through the channels one day and stopped on HBO and watched a little of this movie. That was encounter #1. Encounter #2 happend after I decided that I liked what I saw so much that I'd try to remember the name of the movie the next time I saw it. I was sitting on the couch on a weekend, and again stopped on HBO, and this movie was on again. This second encounter is what really intrigued me. I know what I like in movies: usually anything comical is an immediate plus, but I also loathe the unusual and the out-of-the-ordinary, like Quinton Tarintino's ""Pulp Fiction"" and ""Resevoir Dogs"" and my all time favorite (tied with this movie) ""The Big Lebowski."" There is something about this movie. I don't know what it is, you have to watch it to understand why I, and everyone else, give it 5 starts and two thumbs up.
P.S. You really should rent The Big Lebowski, it's a fabulous movie, if you like it, you'll definately like this movie.",1004659200,3,1057,4.425641025641026
8304327,5,6303953662,"This movie is brilliant, much moreso than most people would think. It is a shame that some of the flights of character fancy in the film get interpreted as naive filmmaking when in fact they are sly, sarcastic winks at life's idiosyncracies. Prime example: when Kelsey Grammer notes that men spend life sucking on women's breasts and then concludes, ""Life Sucks,"" not only is it a funny look at his genius-yet-pervy character but it's also a brilliant way of tying in the fact that 'galaxy' literally refers to milk. This idea that space is nurturing is one of the central ideas of the story.
Yes, some of the acting is bad, but it's terribly endearing. Beth, played by Susan Walters, is acted at times so awkwardly that she becomes a parody of the throngs of annoying real people just like her character. After she pleads her groom-to-be Adam for an answer why he is no longer interested in sex, he tells her that the urge to procreate is a chemical reaction which ""stems from the R-complex."" She replies disgustedly: ""No! It stems from your complex!"" This is ingenious in its stupidity! It's real life!
The movie can seem preachy or crammed with rhetoric, but it's all entertaining and pertains to the film's central point, so just sit back and listen; most of it will really make you think.
The part of the film that everyone sites as the funniest is in my opinion less impactful: James Ward's performance as the escaped mental patient is absolutely hilarious for his spot-on impressions and goofiness, but somewhat pointless and unnecessary to the plot.
Some people may find it hard to identify with an overly- analytical, geeky white guy who has a nervous breakdown and ditches his own wedding to wander the desert.  But if you have ever felt like your brain is stuck in overdrive and life can be overwhelming when you just can't reconcile people's need for more Walmarts with the violence of the universe, then you will identify with this film and it will speak to you. If, on the other hand, being preoccupied with your Frappucino and your cell phone is enough to keep your mind off the homeless guy bugging you for change, and you just want to see hot chicks and explosions while you're waiting for the lord to call you home, then pop in Die Hard and shut your mouth.  Or who knows? Even you might see the world differently through director John Ryman's lens.
Besides, this movie has explosions and hot chicks, too: Everyone thinks Adam is killed when a missile hits his car; and the line I used for the title of this review is spoken by one of the most beautiful women on the screen - Lisa Todd, who is the operator in those 1-800-DENTIST commercials!",997142400,5,2660,4.633474576271187
