6162287,5,B00HGIL9Y0,Well done. I could watch it over and over. The people did very well in speaking about how they feel. Kudos to the film makers.,1438905600,3,126,4.08

6162291,4,B00HGIL9Y0,"I enjoyed watching this. As another reviewer stated it does portray mostly high functioning autistics, but for most of the population its usually the higher functioning people with autism that are able to express things like feelings. My son is 6 and high functioning and even though he is not like any of the people in the documentary, I was still able to relate.",1437436800,5,364,4.703125
6162292,2,B00HGIL9Y0,The movie is misleading in that it shows only the most highly functioning people with their particular issue and not a broader range.,1436745600,,133,4.826086956521739
6162293,5,B00HGIL9Y0,"Very interesting.  Laughed, cried, learned.  It really sparked some interesting conversations.",1436572800,5,94,7.454545454545454
6162294,5,B00HGIL9Y0,"Before anything else is said first I must be upfront with you. My name is Wolf Dunaway. Indeed I am the very same Wolf who appears in this Neurotypical Movie. I am honest in my reviews so first off I had to  tell you I appear in this movie. I don't hide the fact that I am an autistic individual. My AUTISTIC WEREWOLF name here on Amazon.com is proof of that. Since I appear in the Neurotypical Movie it is fair to suspect I might be bais in my estimation of it.

That said I think this an excellent video production. I know from experience that Adam Larsen and his family team in making Neurotypical did everything possible to bring you autistic people's perspectives on what it is like to be on the spectrum in this neurotypical world. Autistic individuals are generally a very diverse group and Neurotypical introduces you to autistic people who share many varied personal perspectives on our life experiences.

Neurotypical is slow paced because, it allowed autistic individuals to share  their perspectives in an unhurried way. Neurotypical has no agenda beyond letting autistic person speak about their experiences growing up among you who are ""Neurologically Typical!"" Adam encouraged us to speak honestly in answering questions. There were no scripts, no  talking points. What you get in Neurotypical is the pure truth from a uniquely autistic perspective.

Neurotypical is a movie that is limited to only those autistic voices that would be considered ""High Functioning"" or ""Aspergers Syndrome"" to use  what are now outdated medical terms. Everything is Autism Spectrum Disprders now don't cha know! So yes the autistic perspectives you hear in Neurotypical is are those of a child, adults and young adults who have have learned to manage their autism in a reasonable fashion. The autistic people in Neurotypical are all reasonably successful by most standards. Many of us who appear high functioning in the film likely had childhoods where we were not considered high functioning. When I was young I was labelled retarded for a time. Autism is not like most other conditions.  Autism is a journey and who and what you are at any point in that journey is constantly evolving.

Finally in order to succeed everyone in Neurotypical had to develop complex and unique ways to manage their Autism. The coolest thing about Neurotypical is actual people living on the spectrum give you priceless insights on how they manage their autism on a daily basis.  You get to see by watching Neurotypical that there is no one single correct autism self management system. Each autistic individual you meet reveals the guiding principals that help them cope and manage continuing autism challenges in this Neurotypical world. The Autism Spectrum is such a vast and wonderful place that no single movie can do justice to all the people living on our spectrum. What Neurotypical does best is allow autistic voices to speak unhindered by outside forces. In Neurotypical autistic individuals invite you into their world and hope you are made all the better for that experience. Neurotypical is a great first step to understanding the complex challenges and joys of what it means to live on the spectrum within this very very Neurotypical world.

As one who was privledged to participate in this Neurotypical Movie, I invite you to take the journey by looking at this movie. This Neurotypical movie won't make you an expert in Autism nor will it tell you about all those who call the autism spectrum home. What this Neurotypical Movie does is give you a good solid honest insight filled first step on your journey of understanding life on our autism spectrum. For the few dollars this Neurotypical movie will cost your investment yields awesome returns in my humble opinion. I could be baised as I for reasons I share at the start. Just know I get nothing from the sales of Neurotypical. I speak here only because I think Neurotypical is a priceless chance to gain insight into autistic minds free to speak as they see fit, no scripts, no agendas no bull!",1435104000,88,4042,4.886131386861313
6162295,5,B00HGIL9Y0,"Beautiful film.  I'm amazed at the trust and rapport between the camera and the cast, as if it is just part of the family.  Witnessing and capturing such true emotions is rare.  Not to mention eliciting such eloquent and deep aspects of each subject's personality and intelligence.  Bravo!",1435104000,7,289,4.958333333333333
6162296,5,B00HGIL9Y0,I saw this on PBS.  It was really interesting to see the different manifestations of Asperger's Syndrome.  I found it easy to bond with the people in the film.  I think this would appeal to people who like documentaries and/or are interested in psychology.,1405900800,8,256,4.7727272727272725
6162297,5,B00HGIL9Y0,"Is anyone else out there crying after watching Neurotypical? Does anyone else keep searching Dr. Google to find answers?  In this film I found myself, my son, and my granddaughter; we are all on the spectrum.  I've been diagnoses with ADD, as was my granddaughter, and my husband and I were told that  our son was ""too intelligent"".  The movie's title is a misnomer because it's really about those of us who are definitely not typical.  It does show how those on the autism spectrum have learned to live in the ""real"" world. My husband won't be interested ~ he's an anti-lable guy ~ but I will recommend this to my daughter since she's been dealing with how to help her little girl function in school.  My son?  He wondered if he had Asperger's for years.  But we saw his potential and told him to follow his dream.  He is now a college professor teaching Imaging and Digital Arts. And me? I felt my calling was to become a Certified Development Disabilities Nurse ... kids with autism were my favorites.  Please watch Neurotypical for a positive uplifting documentary!",1485993600,7,1069,4.638297872340425

It's great to see autistic people speaking for themselves, confident, self-aware, self-accepting. I only gave four stars though because I'd love to have heard more from the young women who only glancingly showed up. Honestly, this film could have been twice as long and I'd be perfectly happy to keep listening to them talk about their experience, because I've always felt to weird, without knowing why. Hearing them makes me feel a lot less weird, or at least weird in a good way.

8632662,1,B00HGIL9Y0,"Guys . . . if this is your first foray into the realm of neurodiversity framework . . . keep going.

1) Contrary to what the opening definition tells the viewer, ""Neurotypical"" does not mean ""not autistic"" and it's not ""a term used by autistics."" There are many kinds of neurodivergent folks out there, for example, bipolar, schizophrenic, highly sensitive, kinetic cognitive style (commonly called ADHD) etc. Not every ""shape that is not a square"" is a triangle. And anyone studying neurodiversity knows that term. Moving on . . .

2) The three year old autistic girl featured in the movie is adorable. Too bad she's terribly parented. No transition time, no space for her feelings, no explanations that make any sense to go with parental boundaries, and no empathy. When she makes sounds, perhaps because she is excited by what she is looking at, the dad tells her repeatedly to ""be a good girl."" Everything this girl does is pathologized, because she is autistic.

3) The parents put a three year old child on drugs - anti depressants. That is really irresponsible medicine on the part of the prescribing physician, and again, bad parenting. If your child is anxious or depressed, look inside yourself. How well regulated is your brain? How patient are you? How clear and loving are your boundaries? Does the child have room for creative expression? Do you celebrate them for their essence? Is there healthy containment (parents set loving clear boundaries, and then empathically witness the child's feelings about those boundaries)?

4) The way the parents talk about the autistic child, in front of her, is awful. So disrespectful.

5) Wolf was pretty cool.

There are much better examples of neurodiversity friendly parenting out there. Keep looking.",1503446400,5,1756,4.9965753424657535

8632666,2,B00HGIL9Y0,"There's NO representation of severe autism here. Yes, there are people with HFA (high functioning autism) and aspergers (which is DIFFERENT than high functioning autism). But what is disheartening here is the lack of introspective analysis or observation or even acknowledgement into the lives of people who are severely autistic. Many people with severe autism can't speak for themselves. So, they need extra protection. Protection from people who are trusted and trained to discern what they need. This is very difficult because there are no formal training to solidify this. However, there is a reasonable and just way to discern this. WHO is the best person to discern the needs and wants of a non verbal serverely autistic person? Well, the caregivers, parents, primary care physcians etc..who know the autistic child are the experts. Not random defensive attorneys or anyone else who thinks they understand autism. That said, the reason for 3 stars is because we are sick to death of Hollywood and other media outlets misinterpreting autism and not at all portraying severe autism because it's too hard to portray.
