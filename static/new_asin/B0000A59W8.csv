1903952,5,B0000A59W8,"I LOVE Leslie Sansone's workout video's! Sometimes, though, I wish she would stop talking so I can hear the Christian music. I got the product fast and the price was comparable to what I would have paid at the store - but Amazon has a better selection of her videos.",1313280000,,266,4.34
1903953,1,B0000A59W8,"I was very disappointed to discover that this had no walking at all, other than the warm up which really doesn't count.  Not what I expected at all, and I'm really ticked I spent $13 for it.  :-(",1293667200,,195,4.105263157894737
1903954,3,B0000A59W8,"I am familiar with Leslie Sansone's walking DVDs. I already own the 1, 2 and 3 mile series so I was looking for something different. Well, I am disapointed in this DVD. It's not walking at all, unless you count the 5 minutes you spend walking in the warm up. After that, it's just standing around doing different exercises with weights. If you want to walk as a form of exercise, don't buy this DVD!",1264204800,13,399,4.333333333333333
1903955,3,B0000A59W8,"Not what I expected - sort of sloooow... lots of stretching.  You might like it, but check the library first.  I threw mine away.",1216166400,3,129,4.333333333333333

7996192,5,B0000A59W8,This is another one of her great CD'S. I love the weight part. It's easy but it works. You should really try it.,1408060800,,112,3.9130434782608696
7996193,4,B0000A59W8,The DVD I received was not the one pictured in the add. Please change the picture so that others are not misled. This picture shows 2 complete workouts: a one mile and a two mile which I had in VHS form and wanted in DVD. The one I received is a Firm Walk and uses weights whereas the Walk the Walk did not. I will keep this video but I already had it and have passed it on to a friend. Please let me know if the pictured video is available. I am afraid to order it again without a guarantee that I will receive the correct video.,1404432000,,530,3.9166666666666665
7996194,5,B0000A59W8,"I enjoyed this change from Leslie Sansone.  I have worked out using her many Tapes and DVDs over the last couple of years and have lost a lot of weight.  While some products do provide firming, this DVD is just that.  I was even inspired to build a work-out stand that is shown in the program.  It was inexpensive to build and works great and helps stabblize me when working out.  This is a great DVD for firming up.",1370908800,,416,4.215189873417722
7996195,3,B0000A59W8,"If you want a walking workout then this might disappoint you. This only has a walking warm-up and then Leslie focuses on total body toning with weights. You will need at least two weights and some ankle weights or other special equipment you can buy from Leslie's site. I did the workout with just hand weights and it was fine. I felt that the pace of this workout was good for beginners. Intermediate exercisers and advanced exercisers may become frustrated with all the instructions.

I did feel that this workout was great for the upper body and abs. I could really feel the burn doing sit ups and arm exercises. The workout is done to jazzy instrumental music alternated with classic hymns so this is for a Christian audience.

One thing I'd like to say about the ab workout is that you may want to support your head with your hands otherwise your neck will be very store.

Also my best advice is that you count the repetitions of each exercise yourself. Leslie gets so chatty that she doesn't count what she is doing. I counted all the exercises and found that at some times she was doing a whole lot more on one side than the other, as many as ten more repetitions on a side. During one exercise she did thirteen on one side and twenty three on the other. I think if you count fifteen repetitions on a side that would be better.

But otherwise I felt this workout was pretty good. Just I was expecting way more walking.

7996196,5,B0000A59W8,"I was skeptical about this dvd, but it kicked my butt! I was relaxed but I really felt the burn. Especially the next day! There was very little walking, but I was aware of that. I just love Leslie so much I knew this would be a wonderful dvd to purchase for my collection. I attribute it to burning off one pound. Seriously! Not sissy stuff like Leslie likes to say.",1351468800,2,366,4.169014084507042
7996197,5,B0000A59W8,"The CD was shipped quickly and arrived in good condition.  I really like this CD, as it is an enjoyable workout, and works the arms, abdomen and legs.  The CD uses weights and I feel like I get a good work out, but not too strenuous.",1331510400,2,233,4.043478260869565
7996198,5,B0000A59W8,This is a great video to help with your toning.  You need to have weights and a band to really get a good work out.  This is not a cardio workout its it totally designed for toning.  It is another great video from Leslie Sansone.  The Christian music really makes it a great video.  I wish there were more exercise videos out there that used Christian music.,1330905600,3,358,4.2835820895522385
