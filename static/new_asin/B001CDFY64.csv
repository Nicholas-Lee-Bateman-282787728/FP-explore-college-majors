The action is so quick i know i missed a few hidden extras they throw into a scene that will make me laugh some more. Its just way over the top you have to see it!

3508899,2,B001CDFY64,"Project Greenlight 3 winner John Gulager's campy horror flick Feast was released in a handful of midnight screenings in 2005 before heading to DVD where it picked up cult classic status, prompting the studio to throw a back-to-back deal (not to mention buckets of more money) at the team for the sequel and third installment of the trilogy. Shot in 2007 on location, Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds (released today on DVD) and Feast 3: Happy Ending (coming in 2009) boast a larger cast of even more unknowns than the first (Jenny Wade is the biggest star, returning to lead a truckload in this ""war""), more blood, more gore, and more chance to see the monster-villains on-screen... unfortunately all that excess proves to just be superfluous. Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds suffers from the lack of imagination, creativity, and ingenuity with which the first of the series soared to success; Feast 2 lacks the heart of the independent story it once was, proving once again that the extra money and inflated egos of studio films can kill a franchise.

Randy (Jamie Kennedy) from Wes Craven's Scream once said that in trilogies ""all bets are off."" Since the series has a clear-cut end, certain characters-- even the leads-- don't have to be kept alive for countless resurrections down the road. It seems Gulager took this advice to heart with Feast 2, opening on the morning after the initial attack in a town nearby where the creatures are now invading a whole new group of people. He throws the picture he painted in Feast out the window not only by ignoring what happened to the car of survivors that took off at dawn (Balthazar Getty must have been too busy with his TV drama and his real life personal drama to return his calls, and his working relationship with Krista Allen was definitely not positive enough to warrant her return) but also by deeming some events and their subsequent title cards false by having a character or two ""not be dead after all"" (I love Judah Friedlander more than the next girl, but his death was awesome, and his reemergence compromises the rules Feast set forth). A cop out way just to fill the cast with your friends and family, if you ask me, and isn't that what the studio was trying to avoid the first time around? Feast's dollar success was not great enough to allow the granting of complete power to a still-green director who, judging by the auteurship of this film, will most likely have to head back to the world of wedding videos come 2010.
 What was so clever and refreshing about Feast was how Gulager made the most of what he had. He wasn't given all the fanciest FX equipment or the biggest budget for CGI. He made an old-school monster movie, with puppeteers on set, steering the hand-crafted rubber beings. He sprayed plenty of blood on his actors and the camera lens, but first and foremost, he crafted well-developed characters and dialogue, using the carnage as a visual aid, but not relying on it to carry the film. Feast 2, however, speaks to the lowest common denominator, as if everything about the filmmaking process was rushed. Between visual gags, toilet humor, and cheap costumes (seeing more of the monsters just showed the dudes in their latex suits), the budget may have doubled, but the production value has been cut off at the knees. There is a lot of the S16mm handheld ""home movie"" footage in this sequel, but unfortunately shooting such shots at night and ""on the move"" just provide dark, grainy, and offensive results-- not just to the filmmaker in me but also to the fan.

Actually Gulager's brand of humor has always been borderline, but in Feast 2 he takes it a bit too far, once again probably just drunk on the power of being in control. There are a lot of slapstick jokes at Martin Klebba's expense, and there is a scene with a baby that caused my jaw to hit the floor and my finger to hit the stop button on my DVD player. This film is nothing like the original, and if you are one of the few diehard supporters of the first, like me, you definitely should not ruin your opinion of the story by viewing this mess. Gulager himself should not have ruined the integrity of the story by making this mess!",1223424000,3,4163,4.615384615384615
3508900,3,B001CDFY64,"I actually didn't think there would be any sequels to Feast, even though it was an enjoyable and nasty little horror flick.  Well, shows what I know.  Feast II: Sloppy Seconds is pretty much what its subtitle implies, as this sequel ups the ante in terms of blood, gore, and some ultra gross-out effects that will have you doing a double take.  Sadly, there isn't much else here other than what I just mentioned.  What made the first Feast so enjoyable was that it was virtually unpredictable in terms of what was going to happen and who was going to die.  Here, not so much.  The story picks up right where the first film left off, as we learn that a neighboring town has had the same monstrous problems that the survivors of the bar massacre had dealt with as well, and things don't appear to be looking any brighter for anyone involved.  While Feast II doesn't pull any punches in terms of its ridiculous violence, it does become noticeable how low a budget the film had, particularly towards the climax of the film where it is ever apparent that the roof scenes were shot with a green-screen background.  Still though, Feast II delivers the goods in terms of gore and shocks, and manages to retain the attitude of the first film.  With Feast III looming on the horizon, let's hope that director John Gulager and co. manage to serve up some deliciously disgusting dessert.",1223337600,3,1375,4.579591836734694
3508901,4,B001CDFY64,"It's true, this movie was far from perfect.  The acting was decent, and the gore factor was real high.  If you have a beer or two, mellow out, and watch the movie for entertainment purposes, you will like it.  If you watch it like movie critic, who thinks you can make the perfect movie,and really can't either, you won't like it.  I did enjoy the movie, but I get biased.  The more gore, the more stars!

3508927,4,B001CDFY64,"This is the sequel to the movie feast. This is even more perverted and over the top than the 1st one. The violence, nudity, comedy, and absurdity is so overwhelming that when the movie ends you will probably be in shock. There is a lot to tell about this sequel, but chances are if are reading this review then you probably saw Feast 1. If you did then imagine everything in that movie to the 10th power. If you can do that you may have an idea of what this is like. If you liked the first film then you should like this one too. It's a gamble though. This movie doesn't make a lot of sense, but that's not really its purpose. It's for entertainment. I think that it has the entertainment aspect pretty much covered.",1352505600,3,716,4.233576642335766
3508928,4,B001CDFY64,"Feast 2 is similar to the original. A group of people are held up in a location by the beasts. In this case they are in a town and are attempting to break into the jail house because it is the safest building in town. Some of the original cast returns. Introductions are done differently. Instead of the clever 4-5 line bio, they show you a black and white retro bio which was about as ineffective and less funny.

Jenny Wade returns as Honey Pie. She deserted the gang in the last film and is greeted as a punching bag in this one. Movie includes a monster dissection and we still don't know the origin of the beast, i.e. alien, mutant, experiment. More action, less drama than the first one.

F-bomb, sex, nudity (Diane Ayala Goldner, Melissa Reed ?) rear midget nudity, baby tossing, midget hurling, topless biker chicks.",1330732800,,824,4.523489932885906
3508929,2,B001CDFY64,"The biggest difference between Feast and Feast 2 is mostly found in the change from heavy blood and gore campiness to scatalogical campiness.  Sure, there are a few moments where the focus is on the monster getting people, but while the first Feast felt gratuitious as a way of forming campiness, Feast II is horribly gratuitious just to be gratuitious.

If you like fart/urine/scat/semen/penis swinging humor, then this movie will probably make you giggle and laugh (though best if not entirely somber before watching it--and I said ""somber"" because I don't want to encourage young people to get 'high' just to enjoy a show).  However, if you enjoyed the horror camp of Feast, you won't find it in this sequel.

I try to find things to like in any movie I watch, and I do enjoy the same visual crudeness in camera angles and transitions that I saw in Feast, and some of the acting is quite good.  You have to suspend disbelief when the electricity decides to stay on longer for a crucial moment than it has in any other scene, and one wonders how a guy is killed in a locked shop which one of our heroines cannot escape because it is locked, but again, if you have a juvenile sense of humor and appreciate the things that make a ten year old giggle (he said ""penis""! hee hee/ he farted hee hee), then you might actually like this movie.

I'd give it a 3 to balance out my preference for non-juvenile humor and my distaste for scatalogical jokes, except that would imply I liked the film.  I had to stop watching it when the fourth or fifth liquid spewed from the alien's body as it was just too much without purpose.

Again, if you don't hate gross body functions that serve no real purpose, this movie might be a 3 or 4 for you.  If you hate that sort of thing (as I truly do but wanted to give it a fair shot) it's probably a 1 at most.

I did admire the actor who played Thunder, who was willing to run around with only his mucho lucho libre mask on and his overly endowed genitalia swinging in the wind through more than one scene.  Of course, he has reason to boast, but even so, it takes a lot of huevos to display it all in a movie like this.  ON some level, I should warn people that between him and the monsters, it has moments where it feels like a sausage-fest, but I think that will appeal to the tittering juvenile boys purely because of shock value.

I hope this helps people who like and dislike some of these qualities in films figure out whether it will appeal to them, rather than bashing it wholesale.

Afraid to try Feast III after this, but you never know, I might get bored.",1327795200,,2597,4.338842975206612

If you think that they would tone the gore down, and I can say that it's just as bad as the first movie if not worse it seems like they upped it a notch to some degree.  Some of the stuff that you seen in the first movie be sure to keep in mind that some of that stuff does come back if not worse and maybe sicker for the viewers of the movie.  There is one scene that I was like 'that is like so [beeping] gross' but who am I to say and it was rather disturbing to see it happen.  By now some know how I am when it comes to horror movies but some it seems like can hold my attention for a while but some it seems like it don't, and with this one it does have it's moments, yet some things could've been executed a little better.  The writing seems to be almost like the first and yet it don't, the acting on the other hand seemed to be a little better than the writing.

3508944,4,B001CDFY64,"Continuing and expanding the vision that began in his vicious monster flick Feast (2005), director John Gulager outrageously serves up more blood and gore, in the wickedly campy, Feast II: Sloppy Seconds (2008).  With the surprise factor gone, and a lower budget to work with, the monsters make mostly brief appearances, with shaky camera work to simulate a frenzied style of attack.  Shot mostly in a small town in Louisiana, the film features authentic locations, as well as some surreal green screen work.  As in the first film, characters are largely identified by nicknames.

The original film followed the events during one night, when carnivorous monsters attacked a tavern.  Feast II opens in the aftermath of that attack, as Biker Queen (Diane Ayala Goldner), arrives at the scene to find her close friend's detached hand, in the jowls of a dog.  Also present is the Bartender (Clu Gulager), who informs the Queen, that the one responsible for her friend's death, lives in a nearby town.  With Bartender as a guide, she gathers four female biker friends.  The gang known as the Bleeders, arrive to find dead bodies littering the streets of the devastated town.  The one they are looking for is not there, but Bartender renews his acquaintance and has a bite, with Honey Pie (Jenny Wade), an old friend from the tavern.

The bikers wind up in a metal shop, with car dealer Slasher (Carl Anthony Payne), Slasher's wife Secrets (Hanna Putnam), car salesman Greg Swank (Tom Gulager), and wrestling dwarfs Thunder (Martin Klebba), and Lightning (Juan Longoria Garcia), and their grandmother.  This assortment of freaks, doesn't appear to have a high combined IQ, and spend most of the movie trapped in the same location, trying to figure out a way to get to the town jail, which they believe is a safe haven.

Swank has the brilliant idea to dissect a dead monster, unleashing hideous body gasses, liquid waste, and toxic body fluids in the process.  For some unfathomable reason, the group keeps standing around the body like morons, exposing themselves to deadly hazards.  The poor Grandmother, gets the worst of it, and receives no help from anyone.  Does any of these geniuses even wash themselves off?

Swank is the kind of scumbag, that usually is destined for a short life span, but like a disease, he keeps coming back to commit even greater atrocities.  In a classic misdirection, it appears that Swank will actually do something heroic, but instead he sacrifices the most innocent of lives.  Slasher also ranks pretty low in the humanity department, as Grandmother, a pathetic victim of Swank's idiocy, is treated like a piece of garbage, and is just one of the many sacrificed.  Pro wrestling brothers Thunder and Lighting, may be dwarfs, but they each have some pretty big cojones, taking risks to try and save the group of losers.

Surprisingly, Bartender, Biker Queen and the Bleeders, who kick some major butt in the beginning, become more passive later, when the group retreat to the roof, trying to figure out a way to get into the jail.  Her tattooed gal pals, end up topless, providing some decoration, in what is already quite a spacey rooftop scene, as a number of the green screen shots, don't really match up that well, with the look of real location shots.

Honey Pie is off on her own, but like the rest, is going absolutely nowhere, trapped in a store.  She finally finds a way out, breaking through a glass door.  To protect herself from being cut, she takes off her pants and lays it on the broken glass, then slithers through, with her back covered in blood.  Moments later, walking down the street in her panties, there is no blood on her back.  Oops!  Her shirt was actually ripped earlier, in a fight with Bartender, but it is mysteriously repaired before she enters the store.  Her dream sequence with Beer Guy (Judah Friedlander), is just more to get grossed out about.

The commentary features director John Gulager, his father Clu, brother Tom, and wife Diane Ayala Goldner.  At the time the commentary was recorded, Feast III (2009) had already been completed, and was in post production.  Besides being something of a family affair, John Gulager regards the Feast films as opportunities to push the current barriers in the genre, to WTF limits.  Although the budget for the sequel, was lower than the original, this goal was definitely achieved, as Feast II includes drinking spraying waste from monster genitalia, gross monster gas and fluid emissions, a weird belly eyeball, dwarf dismemberment, catapulted bodies, and baby football.  Although there are still some nasty kills, the monsters are not featured that prominently, as the sick humor level is cranked into overdrive.  There isn't a heck of a lot that is redeeming about the survivors, most of whom will return in Feast III: The Happy Finish.",1273190400,,4845,4.88984088127295
3508945,4,B001CDFY64,I was simply amazed with the Feast movies. A friend told me about them. There was definitely no disappointment there.,1266969600,,117,4.9
3508946,3,B001CDFY64,"in this review. Adventuresome person that I am, there are some places even I won't go, and you can add the naked dwarf to that area.

I loved the original FEAST so wanted to see FEAST II despite the reviews. While I've noticed an odd mixture of GREAT and AWFUL -- which one seldoms sees, I'm in the ""rent it if you really must see it"" cuz it just didn't have the fun of the original. I do like to collect series (i.e. SCARY MOVIES I, II, II, IV or several ALIEN  movies -- of which the last was bad enough they really should stop.) but I really don't see the need to complete this one. Won't be getting #3.  Very disappointed in this one. ""Gore Fest"" is a term I've noted in other reviews, and it does suit.

We find ourselves kind'a carrying on from the last movie with a good character actor and father of the director, Clu Gulager, some bad-a$$ motorcycle babes (yes, I know how sexist that sounds, but when/if you see FEAST II you'll understand), a couple of used car salesmen, and sterotypical dumb blondes. I swear upon all that is holy there is not an I.Q. above 60 in this entire movie, and that unfortunately includes the writers. Stupidity abounds, and not in a funny way.

It gets 3 stars because of the bartender and because I love good character actors. He does the job he is (hopefully) paid to do. The acting really isn't that bad here, it's just that the characters do such stupid things over and over. This is mostly a rehash from the first movie, with the characters trapped in a small town instead of a bar, fighting monsters that have come from nowhere. I wish they'd truly had some kind of good explaination in either FEAST or FEAST II as to how something so big and vicious just managed to pop up and start slaughtering the population.

As it is, the ending, the gore, the stupidy is all fairly predictable.",1255046400,,1829,4.348973607038123
3508947,1,B001CDFY64,"Horribly lazy ""Feast II: Sloppy Seconds"" adds nothing to the original ""Feast"" (2005) which some hailed as a new cult classic. It was not the greatest monster flick in the world, but the first ""Feast"" delivered the campy fun with deliberately tasteless and gruesome moments which I found impressive. Now the first sequel arrives, which is equally tasteless, but this time the film's tastelessness is not exactly very interesting to see.

The story of ""Feast II: Sloppy Seconds"" is basically a retread of the original. A group of quirky characters (some of them are back from the original) are trapped in a building in a small town attacked by some monsters. Honestly I don't mind the weak story because I am watching this for thrills and gores and maybe dark humor. There are lots of gores and dead bodies, but sorry, about 40 or 50 minutes in, the film becomes tedious and boring.

For the filmmakers have run out of tricks. The ""creatures"" are no longer scary as they look like men wearing cheap rubber suits. Jokes are painfully drawn out (the lengthy monster dissection scene is one example). As he did in the first film, director John Gulager insists these characters are not always capable of heroic actions, and even if they are, they may not be rewarded. He made a good point, I admit. However, in the sequel his idea is stretched to the point of self-indulgence. Like Tarantino's ""Death Proof,"" the film has turned into an over-the-top mess, which is not funny or scary. Watching monsters attacking characters is one thing; watching characters bickering and fighting among themselves on and on is something else.

For the record, the screenplay was written by Patrick Melton and Marcus Dunstan, who went on to write for ""Saw IV"" ""Saw V"" and ""Saw VI,"" and you already know what you get.",1254787200,,1793,4.77741935483871

<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feast/dp/B000GLL1U6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feast</a>
The basic scenario: a scattering of rastabouts are trapped in a bar by a family of malevolent creatures with large underbites.  The characters try, mostly unsuccessfully, to find a way out without getting killed.  Meaning virtually everyone gets killed.

Because the movie is staunchly amoral, the gore is obscene.  Everyone from the jaw-chiseled hero to the helpless toddler is up for grabs, and in ways that are designed to make you squeam.  The movie helps viewers out by offering up stat cards the first time a character is introduced, including the probability that the character will be dead by the closing credits.  It's a bit of smart playfulness that makes the proceeding hideousness a little bit easier to handle.

Personal state: bemused, slightly nauseous, took two antacids, probably the pizza.  Four stars.

FEAST II: SLOPPY SECONDS
I'm not ruining anything for you by saying that one of the characters to die in the first film was a sneery biker chick referred to as Harley Mama.  In fact, she suffered an especially gruesome death (which is saying a lot), and now her twin sister has discovered her remains and is off an ill-advised revenge quest.  She is accompanied by an unlikely survivor from the first film, and together they encounter many spectacularly horrifying things including:
--a baby ... that's all I'm saying about it.  A baby is involved.
--every single bodily fluid you can name, one after the other
--the violation of a cat
--a liquefied grandmother
--and so on

This installment introduces a new character archetype called ""The Puker.""  See, if the creatures vomit on you, you either melt away after time, or the melting stops and you develop an irrational affinity for blood.  But not for the blood of other Pukers.  It's not THAT irrational.

The creatures are more clearly seen this time around.

Or, more accurately, that most people think it's funny.  But I found it distracting.

In their attempt to top the first film, the makers turned the second movie into a pornographic satire of the original flick.  A catapult is created using the clothes of two breasty biker chicks who spend the remainder of the movie mostly nude.  A man ends up with a pipe in his head but suffers only minor swelling.  Except for the Mexican wrestlers, Thunder and Lightning, every character was viciously selfish.  The movie pushed the envelope until I had no more pushing room left.

And yes.  What did it for me was the baby.  I guess that was supposed to be funny.

This is another immediate continuation from the previous film, with our gang moving underground in their quest to safety, guided this time by a mentally handicapped Prophet who has an unusual ability to ward off the creatures.  As it crawls through labyrinthine sewage systems, the movie achieves new depths to its depravity, including violence of cartoonish dimensions.  (Seriously.  Wile E. Coyote would fit right in here.)  At first I'd rationalized that the movie was offering a kind of social commentary.  In fact, as the third movie unspooled, I was reminded by what Dawson said, ""As soon as men decide that all means are permitted to fight an evil, then their good becomes indistinguishable from the evil that they set out to destroy.""  It made the movie seem smart again.

The ending, not so much.  It's abrupt, it's stupid, it's completely out of left field, like the filmmakers just said, ""I'm tired of this movie.  Let's stop.""  There's a tease about a possible fourth (and an amusing song over the final credits), but the whole thing felt like a shamefaced shrug to me.  As if the makers didn't want people to be too offended, so they finished with a silly little ""See?  We didn't mean no harm!""  When, of course, they did.

SLOPPY SECONDS

The very next day after the events of the first film we follow a group of biker chicks that are looking for the leaders twin sister, you may remember ""gagging"" moment from the first. Upon discovering that the place is wrecked and she is dead they move on to a near by town to find out what happened to her. Along the way we are reintroduced to two survivors from the first film, the grumpy and now very badly injured bartender and Honey Pie the girl who left all of them when she made it to the truck. Once in the town we find that the place is swarming with the creatures from the first and people are dying [being raped and eaten] left and right. So much like the first film this is a survival flick centered on a small group of people trying to make it out alive, and what a great group we have. The biker chicks who get naked, the grumpy and very funny bartender, a wonderfully entertaining car salesman [you may know him as Cole from ""Martin""] with his cheating wife and her lover, and two midget wrestlers along side grandma.

This much like the first is all about the blood, guts, sex, dark comedy, and over the top situations and occurrences, and trust me when I say that they get over. The creatures look as cool as ever although they seem a little different in this one, I like the look of the first film better. Also you get to see a lot of monster private parts, and I mean a lot [ugh]. Also there is a crazy moment involving a cat, poor thing and of course the now famous or should I say infamous baby scene. All of these things along with flying midgets splattering on pavement make for one of the most fun movies I have ever seen, no joke. All the blood you need is there and there are some genuinely funny moments especially from Slasher and bartender, tender has my favorite line in the entire movie.

The return of John Gulager as director and Patrick Melton & Marcus Dunstan as writers was indeed the greatest thing that the producers [Chris Moore, Michael Leahy & the Weinstein's] could have done. With the classic that these three delivered the first time they really were the only choice when bringing this back. I actually like the fact that they kinda go a different way with this film, it kinda adds to the good time brought on by the first and makes a little fun of its self. Where part one was a nice mix of horror/comedy this one leans a little more towards the comedy but adds a lot more blood and fun.

Jenny Wade returns as Honey Pie and is as much of a ........ well a pain as usual, and what a hard girl to kill. She does a good job reprising her role as does Diane Goldner who returns to play her twin from the first one [she is the director's wife]. Clu Gulager is magnificent as the returning bartender and is one of the most entertaining people in the entire film. From there we have an all new cast since the other survives left to pick up a kid from the first film. First off is Carl Anthony Payne II who steals the show as Slasher the car salesman, this dude needs to be making more films. He was great in ""Martin"" and just as good in the classic ""The Breaks"". Hanna Putnam plays his cheating wife and is perfect in the role as is her lover played by Tom Gulager who really takes a nasty shot in this. Martin Klebba and Juan Longoria Garc&iacute;a are two midget wrestlers and are insanely entertaining much like every one in this over the top classic.

Like the review I wrote about the first one I will admit that I can not do this movie justice, I truly enjoyed this film, I always love things like this. I find that movies like this are usually the ones that keep my attention and have me smiling and laughing in a very strange way, I'm not crazy but it is enjoyable......right? Naw I am just playing but still this is a great fun flick that I truly feel if you go in with an open mind you will enjoy. This like the last film as a great commentary with every one on it giving out a lot of wonderful information about the movie and the time they had making it. There are also some more great features that you will enjoy, go out and buy now.",1235692800,2,4108,4.221374045801527
3508970,5,B001CDFY64,"I didn't like the original Feast.  It was boring and uninspired.  Feast II, however, truly outdoes its predecessor, and going down as one of the most jaw-dropping movies I've ever seen.  It's impossible to truly encompass how wild this movie is and how many bizarre turns it takes, but I'll give it a shot.

A woman biker gang who look like the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/SuicideGirls/dp/1932595031/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">SuicideGirls</a>&nbsp;are on the hunt.  Led by a shotgun-toting, German Sheppard blasting, alcohol swilling, tattoo covered bad a*$ named Biker Queen (BQ), they're a formidable group sure to cause havoc and show full frontal nudity.  BQ is looking for her sister, who just happens to be the biker chick from Feast who got her leg severed and then got strapped to a homemade bomb as monster bait.  Let's go back about 16 hours...

An explosion happens in a small town - ostensibly for an alien landing - and aliens soon chase people around, murdering, decapitating, and destroying the town.  Meanwhile, midget luchadores named Thunder and Lightning are in their, one of them engaged in a vigorous railing of his girlfriend.  Off with her head!  The character Hobo from the first film is in jail, and gets to see a monster devour the jailer.  An infidelitous wife (Secrets) and her slick talking used car salesman husband (Slasher), along with his employee (Greg Swank) - who is proud of his glorious mustache and is the guy with whom the wife has been cheating - are sneaking through the alleys of town to avoid the monsters.  Later, Lightning is seen from the back, running away with what appears to be a flesh colored night stick attached to his waist.

Now back to the biker chicks...they have an arsenal of weapons, and they're P.O.d.  They find the Bartender from the original, hiding amidst the carnage.  Tons of gore, dead bodies are lying everywhere, fear is palpable.  The Biker chicks want to know where BQ's sister is, and Bartender knows.  As a few unfortunate nobodies soon find out, get in BQ's way, and you die.  Point blank shotgun blast to the chest!  Neck shot!

After the executions, guess who shows up?  Honey Pie, the coward, imbecile blonde from the first movie who got into the semi and rode off without attempting to help the others.  The Bartender is not happy to see her.  He proceeds to beat her head against a toilet that desperately needs to be flushed - and the person who just used it desperately needs more starch in their diet - then he finishes the battle by biting her ear off ala&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/EVANDER-HOLYFIELD-VS-TYSON/dp/B00114RJTY/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">EVANDER HOLYFIELD VS.

And THEN it gets crazy!!  The scene avoided by most, Greg ends up carrying a baby like a 60s era football, juking two monsters in the streets like Barry Sanders.  FUMBLE!  It's off the wall horrible, and over the top hilarious at the same time.

This is a movie you have to see with friends.  It's outrageous, and you're guaranteed to have a very fun time.  Just after the midget fight, The Bartender says, ""I sure as s#@* seen everything now.""  I concur.",1235433600,2,5179,5.690507152145644

""Feast 2"" falls squarely into the last category.  There is no rhyme or reason to this movie.  Story arcs often go nowhere (the Honey Pie storyline for one) and there is no tension whatsoever -- just lots of gore.  Now, I'm never one to dismiss the power (and fun) of good blood-splattering, but the film doesn't even deliver on that level.  There's just lots of red goo and meal worms for the sake of...I'm not sure what the sake for.  Additionally, the movie dragged; I kept waiting for something of interest but there wasn't anything.

3508983,4,B001CDFY64,"I have finally found my personal threshold for black humor.  I've been on this Earth for 30 very long years and have laughed long and hard at some vile and disgusting things in my time.  I pop dead baby jokes like candy and have happily participated in online discussions deemed so offensive that they have gotten people banned from uncensored websites due to content.  But this is the first film that has ever actually offended and angered me with a joke.  That alone makes ""Feast 2: Sloppy Seconds"" a horror cinema milestone in my world.  It's also a rare sequel that is nearly as good as the original.

Then pick this baby up and prepare for the glorious goriness to be kicked up a notch or ten.

The ""story"" (if you can call it that) picks up immediately following the events of the first film the few survivors are present and accounted for.  Whether the opening&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Yojimbo/dp/B000K0YLZ0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Yojimbo</a>&nbsp;homage was intentional or not, when a film decides to set the tone with a dog carrying a severed human hand getting blown in half, you pretty much know what you're in for.  Or do you?  A gang of dyxe on bikes seeking revenge for the demise of their sister in the first film pick up the old timer known only as ""Bartender"" who survived the carnage and he leads them to a nearby town.  The demonic beasts of unknown origin have obviously been hard at work there.  We are quickly introduced to the cast in quick-cut music video-style montages that are amusing, but a bit annoying.  Among our protagonists are the aforementioned biker chicks, two of which I have the hots for and are listed in the credits as ""ti+ girl"" and ""tat girl"". Since each has both sweet tats and lovely ti+s on display, I do not know how we are supposed to tell which is which. Don't much care either, I suppose.  Also along for the ride is a foul-mouthed car salesman and his cheating wife, a pair of pint-sized luchadores (oh yes, there will be midget wrestling), and another familiar face.  Honey Pie reintroduces herself by declaring that while people may think she's just a dumb blonde, they know nothing about the real her.  Then she tries to load her gun by pushing a bullet into the barrel backwards.  You may recall her moment of glory in the first film where the other characters distract the beasts so that she can reach the vehicle and come back to rescue everyone.  Great plan, but when she got to vehicle she hit the gas and didn't look back.  Classic.  You can imagine how pleased Bartender is to see her.  Ever seen an old man gnaw a girl's ear off in a fit of rage?  Now I have.  It was awesome.

The film plays out like&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/30-Days-of-Night/dp/B00111YM5Q/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">30 Days of Night</a>&nbsp;would have if it had been awesome and over-the-top horror comedy.  The humor is all of the inappropriate, vulgar, and downright wrong variety.  I'd say creating laughs based entirely on excessive profanity or tagging a derogatory term directed towards the person being spoken too onto the end of every sentence is it's own genre of comedy at this point.  Simple, but oddly effective. Well, this falls into that genre.  Any and every bodily fluid you can think of is featured in gallon-amounts (yes, even THAT one.  ESPECIALLY that one.) and sprayed on most of the characters.  There's also demon shlong, excessively large little-person shlong, love for your neighborhood vomit fetishist, characters tearing pieces off of a decaying but still alive and whimpering old woman (to lighten the load, see?), and total cat rapeage.  You heard me.  Rapeage of an innocent kitty.  These monsters are CRAZY!  And then there's the joke I mentioned.  The one so unspeakably vile and evil that it actually, literally bummed me out. You'll know it when you see it. Let's just say that while I said I laugh at dead baby jokes, it turns out I don't want to see them put into practice.  But I can hardly fault the movie.  In fact, it should be praised because it earns it's ""unrated"" rating and then some.  But if any of this sounds like too much for you, then move along.  This ain't for you.

""Feast 2"" is a must-see DVD for the sick and demented horror-starved minority.  While it adds next to nothing to the previous storyline and knowledge of just what these demons are all about, it provides a metric ton of genre satire and disgustingly uncalled-for laughs.  It also sort of sets up for the next film,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Feast-3-The-Happy-Finish/dp/B001KKU9CS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Feast 3: The Happy Finish</a>.

I am nowhere near to saying it was the worst movie I have watched, but it had very little plot, the characters were decent and the actors were fair, but the whole film was jerky, overdone, and, well, stupid.
  The first one had great one liners, surprises, gore, good actors playing characters that jumped off the screen.  The sequel tried to imitate, but fell far short of the mark.  There was no one to feel particularly sad about, the ending was very poor (what did they do? run out of funding?), and the part with the baby was, well, I don't offend easily, but geez! that was over the line!

I WOULD HAVE DONE THE SAME EXACT THING

yes, i would have tried to save the baby, but preserving my own life is a lot more important than the life of a baby that barely has any idea of what is going on any way, anyone that says people don't have a soul for enjoying that scene probably doesnt have a soul because they don't have the survival instinct that everyone else has.",1230076800,,698,4.225563909774436

In addition, none of the cast is likeable in this movie. The worst scene involves an ""attempted"" rescue of an infant that only you can watch to judge for yourself.

If there will be a part three, the producers need to put some closure on the creature's origin and perhaps have at least one or two likeable actors in the movie.

The Feast movies make fun of a genre. whatever is popular in horror movies at the time and then say okay how would that really happen?

I'll be honest and say the first time I watched this movie i was not impressed, then i watched it again and again and again and noticed every time i re watched it i picked up on things, had more questions and enjoyed the movie a lot more. This is one of those movies that grows on you the more you watch it and your totally hooked.

I feel sorry for the reviewers who watched it once and made up thier mind on it. They are really missing out on a great movie, especially one that makes fun of itself and introduces these over the top characters you just dig. After awhile you come to really like these characters, especially Thunder and Bartender and Biker Queen. You can tell the director and the writers are huge horror fans. This is the same team who wrote Saw 4 and 5 and one writer has a brief hilarious run in, in the movie.

I don't know about these other hater reviewers but i cannot wait for Feast 3...gotta see how this all wraps up...and can't wait to see Hobo get his. I reccomend before you watch the movie watch the ""meet the gulagers"" featurette. you'll realize that ""the baby"" everyone is having a hissy fit about is related to 4 family members in the movie. I think they could have left out ""the dream sequence"" it didn't really add anything to the movie :)

I've come to love this movie MORE than the first movie. Like the first Feast it's full of great one-liners that people will be quoting after watching it and I can't help but laugh everytime I see or hear ""the secret"" mentioned since seeing this movie lol Honestly? I've worn out my dvd copy and now prefer this movie to the first one. Course I would have thrown the chick off the roof, grabbed the ladder repeatedly used to climmb back up and climbed up on top of the jail with the key instead of using the Catapault, but that's just me.

It starts off ok, picking up the morning after the 1st one ended. The sister of the biker-chick shows up to find her sister's arm in the mouth of a dog, and the injured old bartender hiding under a truck. So, out of reasons of vendetta, she takes the bartender hostage, looking for ""Bozo"", whom she thinks is responsbile for her sister's death. Not to give away the storyline to those who want to see this, but that is the only piece of plot I could comprehend in 100 minutes. She never even finds ""Bozo""!

3509013,5,B001CDFY64,"i think its hilarious reading through these reviews, people are talking about how feast 1 was some amazing gift to cinema, and i am not putting it down at all, i personally loved both films. however i don't know if some of the people here who reviewed feast 2 have even seen feast 1. first of all feast has always been a campy and over the top, does anyone remember henry rollins character putting a dead monster on a stick and hanging it out the window. i seem to also recall a woman getting assualted by something in her mouth... what was that again? hey wait a minute, doesnt the same thing that happens to the grandmother in the second one, happen to a fat redneck in the first?? people, if you are truly a fan of the first feast, you will like this, its better than the first in my opinion, and this is coming from a true fan of horror. i'm talking directors like fred vogel, peter jackson, sam raimi, dario argento, kind of movies. if your favorite horror movies include crap like the happening, then this movie is not for you, stick to your watered down horror. but if you truly enjoyed the first feast, this will leave you with a good movie going experience.",1226361600,,1166,4.353211009174312
3509014,4,B001CDFY64,"This movie was one of the funniest I've seen in a while!!

SPOILER****

When you're shooting midgets over buildings and having a dead alien squirting fluids on people causing a pukefest, that's just good entertainment right there. No it wasn't like the first one, but that's OK, because the first one was riddled with graphic gore scenes intent on shock only. This one has it's gore and it has some questionable ethics (which are also funny as he**), but it's not the sole basis of the movie.",1225497600,,492,4.64367816091954
3509015,1,B001CDFY64,"Take everything you love about the first feast movie and throw it out, all resemblances of horror movie are taken away. It does everything wrong and dumbs the movie down more than was needed. I didn't expect a classic like the first, but there was maybe one notable kill, one or two funny lines, and 80 minutes of movie I didn't want to watch. You know a horror movie can't be good when the ""best"" characters are a pair a wrestling midgets. This isn't supposed to be a comedy, I loved the first and was greatly disappointed by this sequel.",1225324800,,539,4.4
3509016,4,B001CDFY64,"I really enjoyed the first Feast, and I really enjoyed this one, but they are very different movies.  While Feast tried to be somewhat serious, Feast II is an over the top splatter and puke gorefest.  The casual horror movie fan is going to be turned off at the ridiculous amounts of puking, disembowelments, and other tasteless humor.  I loved it.

When a movie starts out with dwarf Mexican luchadores, full frontal female nudity, a prosthetic penis that Dirk Diggler would envy, and buckets of gore, you know you're in for a good ride.

There is a puke scene that rivals the one in ""Stand By Me"", and the fart/feces humor is on par with American Pie.  The ""rotting grandma"" is a memorable theme, and there is even a toddler death that is pretty disgusting.

But the one thing that really stands out is the most gratuitous nude scene I've seen in a LOOOONG time.  In order to build a catipult, two biker chicks have to give up all their clothes except for their thongs and leather gun holsters.  I guess they didn't realize the male characters all had on several layers of clothes, but hey - I'M NOT COMPLAINING!!  They just stood around topless for a good 10 - 15 minutes.  LOL!

The only real negative to this movie is the poor CGI and ""green screen"" effects.  I realize this was shot on a low budget, but jeeze, there were some pitiful effects at times.

Still, I have to recommend this to gorehounds.  Stay away if you squirm at movies like Scream or I Know What You Did Last Summer.  This is getting near old Peter Jackson territory!!",1225324800,,1541,4.469534050179211
3509017,1,B001CDFY64,"The first FEAST was a hip, edgy, funny, over the top film that had horror fans like myself wanting more.

The filmmakers want to have more blood, guts, nudity, and violence, and generally break some taboos for this sequel. And boy they did they ever. So much so that I hit the stop button after one particular scene.

If you have children or are sqeamish, you may want to pass this movie up. In one of the most tasteless, disturbing and shocking sequences I've ever seen in a film, a cute baby is hurled into the air. We then see him falling in slow-motion before he hits the ground. We then see the poor child crying and writhing in a pool of his own blood before being eaten by the monsters.

I understand the point of the Feast movies, to be funny and gory and they are, but why kill a baby? I personally felt this was very uneccesary and will be passing up on that 3rd Feast. I don't have much of an appetite anymore.",1225238400,,921,4.221590909090909

It's pure camp, and makes fun of a lot of films that try to take themselves far to serious.  This is a super obscene dramomidy.  if you're looking for a scare you're looking in the wrong place.  If you're looking for a film that has fun with itself and the genre, with over the top and sometimes extremely ""obscene"" moments, then this film is defiantly for you.

3509021,2,B001CDFY64,"The best part of the original was you never knew who would be eaten next and surprised when the most heroic or sympathetic became lunch meat before some of the more unsavory and secondary characters.

The sequel antes up the blood and gore but in a different location with a couple of eye-popping deaths involving a dying grandmother and a baby. The trapped victims on a roof decide the building across the way is safer for them and because the creatures are roaming the streets they build a catapult to fling themselves from one roof to the other(ludicrous)  They arn't sure if the catapult will work so they decide to use the old grandmother as a test. Her grandsons, midget wrestlers,(I don't make this stuff up folks) are against this at first but they relent and grandma is loaded onto the catapult-they let fly and grandma squishes into the side of the building across the street.  I will not go into details about what happens to the infant.  Let's just say there was no holding back on what happens(dis-tasteful but brave).

I rated two stars because the movie succeeds in being gross as it intended but it's not much of a movie unless you like, chomp, chew and swallow.",1224374400,2,1178,4.617224880382775
3509022,5,B001CDFY64,"I just read the first three angry/disappointed/offended reviews for this movie and feel compelled to throw my own opinion into this discussion.

This movie, like its prequel, is fun as hell to watch. John Gulager clearly loves cheesy personalities and unnecessarily grossing out his audience--it seems like that's the primary reason why he made Feast and Feast II. Both movies are more satirical of the monster movie subgenre than they are commemorative--I would compare them with Scream and Tremors.

The whole scene inside Thunder and Lightening's ""fort"" was absolutely hilarious, because it's obvious that the movie is incredibly aware of itself during that scene. Slasher's probably the funniest character, but Gulager's writers did an excellent job making Honey Pie the dumbest bitch you ever saw and making that other car salesman (forgot his name) an outrageous sap (I loved that the movie kept putting him in situations in which he could redeem himself and then making him fail miserably).

It's a great movie to watch (especially with a group of friends), and it's pretty unpredictable in a few instances (I noticed the girl who wrote a review a few spaces before me mentioned the baby scene--that was awesome). I would highly recommend this movie to anybody who appreciates a monster movie that can make them laugh.",1224288000,15,1325,5.125
3509023,1,B001CDFY64,"The first film worked so well hidden in the darkness of night. With Feast 2, the harsh sunlight exposes the cheese, and the cheese has melted into an oily blob in the gutter. Very sloppy indeed.",1224201600,,194,4.416666666666667
3509024,2,B001CDFY64,"I watched this movie last night and here is what I thought.  First, the moview was worse than the first one. Second, what is going on with the trashy dialogue.  I mean a few sentenence enhancers can help make a point in a movie better, but the constant use of the f**k word is just plain trashy.  What was with the out of nowhere scene where the baby was killed.  What that thrown in just to make the movie worse.  I gave the movie two stars but I should have given it less than that.

This movie is nothing but the F-word over and over until you can't stand hearing it anymore. NOt much Gore, bad story, stupid actors, it never shows the monsters, etc. Stick with the first Feast movie and save your money, unless you want to watch 2 hours of monster farts, semen, and snot.

3509030,3,B001CDFY64,"I'll preface this review by stating I loved the original Feast...LOVED it. It was funny, the effects were very decent, it sported a somewhat known cast, it was unpredictable...just an all-around quality horror flick...

Feast 2...
where to begin....

I'm honestly still trying to process it all. This movie easily has my vote for the most outrageous, over the top, just straight-up ludicrous movie I have ever seen.  To make a long story short...there is a scene in which one of the main characters decides he needs to dissect one of the monsters...needless to say, there is plenty of monster farts, puke, crap, and semen to go around.

Despite it's shortcomings (especially in comparison to the original), I rated Feast 2 a 3/5, almost purely on it's shock value. The baby rescue scene alone makes it worth the watch...those who have seen the movie know what I am talking about...;o)

The production value of the film is way down from the first one, but the gross outs, the gore, the shock value...is way up. If you can handle the thought of a cat being raped by one of those monsters...by all means, this is the movie for you. If you're the squeamish type, you may want to pass on this one.

Apparently Feast 3 was filmed in conjunction with this one, so look out for the next installment sometime next year. I, for one, will be checking it out.",1223596800,6,1347,4.615062761506276
