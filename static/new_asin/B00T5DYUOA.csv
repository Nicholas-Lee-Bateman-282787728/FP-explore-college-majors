8700365,4,B00T5DYUOA,"I have used many yoga dvds over the past ten years.  I have taken a break and this is one of the dvds I am using as a way to get back into it.  When I stopped, I was an intermediate for sure.  With that being said, this dvd is for beginners who are ready for the next step, or even beginners who will just do most of it and watch a couple of poses.  The instructors explanations are detailed and understandable.  Two of the poses would be challenging for beginners.  They are plank style stuff.  I am not sure if I would do this on the regular because it might get boring with no music, however this guy knows what he is talking about.  That is the most important thing I look for when choosing a dvd.  The only minor issue is I believe that he skips Parsvakonasana on the second side.  I haven't tried the bonus class but I will it review once I do.  Side note, I have tried another Udaya dvd and it was excellent as well.  I must say these instructors place more emphasis on form than many of the Gaiam and other dvd instructors.  But I do love the Yoga for Runners, and Yoga for Flexibility; both put out by Gaiam for beginners.  They are good for men; but I digress.  I gave this dvd four stars instead of five because it is really not fast paced, so a deduction was given for that.  However, if you never did any yoga before, you might find the vinyasa a little fast.  If you have any experience, then it is not fast.  I like it no matter what they call it :)",1454025600,,1464,4.059440559440559
8700366,1,B00T5DYUOA,"I really disliked this dvd.  I just finished Travis Eliot's yoga challenge and I was considering getting Rudy Mettia's collection.  I'm glad I bought this first because I would never get his collection now.  He seems like he has had way too much espresso and  you really don't do much at all.  There are two workouts. One is forty minutes the other twenty.  The core workout is better than the other one, but it was mind numbingly boring.",1451606400,,438,4.551282051282051
8700367,5,B00T5DYUOA,"Rudy provides some of the BEST Yoga instruction out there. This DVD would be great for someone who has some Yoga experience as far as familiarity with poses. But it's not over your head. If you're intermediate or advanced, this is still a wonderful practice for an easier day or if you just want to check in with proper form. The Core workout is great! I highly recommend this DVD. Stop by Udaya.com also for more superb online Yoga classes!",1433894400,,441,4.525
