I sometimes do trainings prepping the students for their med school interviews and I often recommend they want this video. It's an excellent video! There are only 2 videos out there that I really love on prepping students for med school, and this is one of them.

7801052,5,0986691534,This was a great DVD; the advice given within was extremely useful which certainly justified the price. The DVD case was slightly damaged but I still gave this product 5 stars because I didn't buy this to look at a pretty case (note: the damage likely occurred during international shipment). A great tool for those interviewing for med school. 5/5,1362441600,,348,4.816666666666666

7801054,1,0986691534,"You start by watching a girl that is terrible at interviewing ... Then he critiques her interview. The information he gives is good, but you can get that same information by reading one of the med school interview books or watching youtube videos. agreed, not worth the price.",1314662400,,276,4.770833333333333
7801055,1,0986691534,"I feel buying this DVD was a waste of money. You can find plenty of free videos online for general interview tips, and tons of resources to help with the medical school application and interview process (try studentdoctor.net). You're already paying out the nose for MCAT prep (not to mention the MCAT itself) and med school applications; no sense spending more money to prepare for something you can't really prepare for.

7801056,3,0986691534,"This DVD did provide me with some insight into the process but only went over a handful of questions.  Like most in this situation, I have felt desperate to increase my odds of success, and gladly paid the $30.  If you can stand the urge that you may miss some mystical secret, you may want to watch Youtube interview videos and read books about interviewing instead...I don't know if I could take my own advice though.  Dr. Ferdinand knows what he is talking about but the information is too limited and it is too short for the money.",1313884800,,535,4.438775510204081

I accidentally received a duplicate in the order and it was corrected promptly.  These guys are great, I'm going to owe Dr. Ferdinand a beer by the time this is done!",1313020800,,328,4.416666666666667
