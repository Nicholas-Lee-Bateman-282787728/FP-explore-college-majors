5552954,5,B00B2AFGVA,"The DVD's are perfect. Play very well in our DVD player. Hubby loves the show and was surprised to find the DVD's were for hour long episodes. So even though some were part of what he has already seen, he saw a more expanded version!",1398470400,,233,4.2
5552955,5,B00B2AFGVA,"Ice Pilots is one of the best ""reality shows"" around today. If you love old aircraft, and I do, then you get to see some great WW2 transports working in extreme conditions. Almost as extreme as how the airline Buffalo Airways, a family run business, that has Buffalo Joe the head of the airline, Mikey the General Manager, and all time good time guy. Rod McBryan is the head of maintenance, and then there is a collection of pilots and crew that only the Canadian Northwest Territory could draw.

If you have not seen the series, buy them all, it is entertaining, and certainly different from the normal melodrama on TV today.",1377043200,,626,4.589285714285714
5552956,5,B00B2AFGVA,Being a pilot all my life..Of course I love the DVD.  I love those old C-47's. C-46's and my favorate thd C-54..,1371427200,,112,4.090909090909091
5552957,5,B00B2AFGVA,"There is a good reason this series was so popular on TV.  The airplanes are exotic, the flying environment is so foreign as to be nuts.  There is plenty of interesting drama in just getting from point A to point B in these flying antiques.

As a retired airline pilot I see the boss Bufflao Joe is the reason unions grew so rapidly in this industry.  Like many of his predicessors he is an absolute tyrant to the greatest asset any corporation has, it's employees.  Nobody knows from minute to minute if they will be fired if the boss is in a bad mood.  Why anybody would stay working there is a mystery to me.",1370822400,,610,4.260869565217392
5552958,5,B00B2AFGVA,"The season 3 DVD set has 13 hour long episodes on 3 DVDs.  The US TV network that had broadcast season 3 of Ice Pilots had shown episodes edited down to half an hour.  There is considerably more air time given to the Lockeed Electra, an turboprop engined plane, than there was in previous seasons.",1366416000,3,297,4.381818181818182
8561308,5,B00B2AFGVA,"Great videos. Well put together story of a maverick NW Canadian freight line. As a pilot, I find it especially interesting. I'm sure I will watch it many times over.",1529884800,,165,4.533333333333333

8561313,2,B00B2AFGVA,"I had the same problem with season 3 episodes 4 and 5 they could not be viewed, all broken up was all set to order a second copy when I read that review of someone having the same problem that I had. Thank you reviewer",1479427200,,218,3.8666666666666667
8561314,5,B00B2AFGVA,"A fascinating look at keeping a business running with the old war horse planes in brutal winters and constantly changing conditions.
The camraderie and tension among the employees is heightened by the managerial style of Buffalo Joe.  This is cross training to the max...pilots not only fly the planes but they load and unload, scrape snow off, and anything else that is needed.",1462838400,2,378,5.0
8561315,5,B00B2AFGVA,Another great season in an outstanding series.,1458864000,,46,5.714285714285714
8561316,4,B00B2AFGVA,"This is the second copy I have purchased. I believe Omnifilm Entertainment has Quality Assurance issues with their product. Both copies have the same pixilation fault with disc1 tracks 3and4. However the rest of season three is fine, as are all the other seasons I own of Ice Pilots NWT.",1439596800,2,287,4.76
