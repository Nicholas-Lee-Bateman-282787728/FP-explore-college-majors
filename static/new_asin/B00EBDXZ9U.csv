5901140,4,B00EBDXZ9U,"I enjoyed A Christmas Wedding. All of the cast members handled their parts well. The writing and acting was good. The directing could have been a little better. At times the actors were not framed properly in the shots. Vivica was great as usual. Vivica and Miguel Nunez play off of each other well. The actors who played the middle and youngest daughters were beautiful. I especially thought the middle daughter was interesting. She played a poet who had a hard time meeting men. She was a big flirt because she was lonely. You could tell that this family really loved each other. I wanted the play to be a little longer to wrap up everything, but everything worked out at the end. Highly recommended for Vivica A. Fox fans and fans of African American romantic, comedies. This film would be rated PG or PG-13. There is no profanity, sex or nudity.",1402272000,,849,4.592105263157895
5901141,2,B00EBDXZ9U,Can't say the movie was all that. I watched it but it did not hold my attention. I love a good Love story and I can say this was not one of them.,1401148800,,145,3.4242424242424243
5901142,2,B00EBDXZ9U,THIS WAS THE WORST PLAY EVER.  IT MOVED VERY SLOW. THERE DIDNT SEEM TO BE A CONSISTANT PLOT. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE,1390521600,,113,4.136363636363637
5901143,1,B00EBDXZ9U,"I LOVE PLAYS AS WELL AS LOW BUDGET AND SHORT FILMS. BUT, THIS WAS THE WORST I'VE EVER SEEN.
THIS MUST HAVE BEEN A RUSHED JOB . I MEAN REALLY?..FIRST OF ALL THE PLAY WAS ABOUT A WHOLE BUNCH OF NOTHING. AND THE ONE PLOT THEY HAD, DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A COMPLETED POINT OR MESSAGE. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY.",1387843200,,305,4.1
5901144,1,B00EBDXZ9U,"For those who judge a book by it's cover and expect to see something good be prepared to be sucker punched.
This movie contained 2 well know actors and 2 comedians. Miguel Nunez and Vivica Fox (former Juwanna Man co-stars). The comedians are Michael Colyar and Tiffany Haddish (from the new Arsenio Hall show). There is also a The other reviewers do not exaggerate...it is a disappointing and confusing storyline with a bunch of people running around acting really stupid. Nothing about this movie was funny. I would love to see Tiffany Haddish be in something that will help her expand her acting career. These actors have been good in their individual projects but this one was not the one. Do not waste your time.",1387756800,2,716,4.736

5901146,1,B00EBDXZ9U,Save your money. This movie had nothing to do with Christmas and was extremely boring.  Plot was not good at all.,1385164800,6,113,4.380952380952381
5901147,1,B00EBDXZ9U,"This movie was poorly written. Although Vivica Fox and Miguel Nunez are great actors, the script absolutely did not serve them well. The movie opens with poor singing, no music throughout the film, a very long start before Vivica and Miguel come in, and an awful ending. Save your money unless you are a Miguel Nunez fan and just want to see him back on the screen after a long hiatus!!",1384214400,9,386,4.450704225352113
