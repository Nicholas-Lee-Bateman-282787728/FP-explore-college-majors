8592610,2,B0007MTWPK,"This is obviously a transfer from VHS. There are no menu's or chapters to get directly to the area you are interested in. The instruction they do have on there is good. They explain some of the basics well, and the 2 instructors are obviously very good at them. The only problem is that there just isn't much on there. I read the product info over on another website, and it mentions that they include Bunkai (applications) for the movements in the Kata's...They do not. They also teach a couple of odd ""pre"" Kata's that I have not seen in any other Wado-Ryu school or DVD. They look more like the beginning short forms from American Kenpo. I think they copied them. Anyway, this DVD is just ok.",1192752000,,695,4.4375
