5990005,5,B00FF9SKPI,"I'm happy that I got this most recent B.B. workout!  I have only done this workout once so far, and I found this one by far the easiest of the 4 dvds.  My muscles did not ache the following day(s)!  I found this one to be good if you want to do a more mellow workout.  You still have to deal with the ""bridge"" series and a little bit of ""swan arms"" in this one, though!  Like in the other B.B. workouts, I had to rewind the disc a few times to see & figure out what Mary was doing to emulate her foot/leg placement.

I am going to make a B.B. workout week part of my exercise regimen!  Can't wait to see what the results will be!",1386720000,6,629,3.8671875
5990006,5,B00FF9SKPI,"I just got done doing this workout for the first time, and loved it!  I've been doing Mary Helen's workouts for about the last eighteen months.  I own all three of her previous DVD workouts, and last year, when I did just the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Total-Body-Workout/dp/B008XBLCMI/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful Total Body Workout</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Body-Blast/dp/B00AATOHPU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful Body Blast</a>&nbsp;for about three weeks, I completely toned and tightened up, even though I was doing very little cardio at the time. If you're familiar with the Tracy Anderson Method, the results you get from Ballet Beautiful are very similar; you get long, lean muscles without much bulk.

After seeing a recent article about how Mary Helen trains some of the Victoria's Secret Angels (who are in amazing shape), I decided to do another Ballet Beautiful rotation, and will be working this one into the mix.  I'll be doing these and Sylwia Weisenberg's Tonique workouts for a few weeks to see what happens, and will be sure to report back on my results.

When you put the DVD into your player, you have the option of choosing from two options: a Workouts choice (where you can play one of the two workouts or both with a Play All feature) and a  Custom choice (where you can choose which order you do the two workouts in).  Unlike some of the previous BB workouts that are broken down into multiple segments, this one has two main segments:  1) Total Body Strength and Cardio and 2) Total Body Toning.  Each one is 30 minutes long.  You also have the option of playing the workouts with Mary Helen's voice/cueing or with the music only.

These two new workouts are different from Mary Helen's previous offerings.  I would describe them as almost a mix of her Total Body/Classic DVD and her most recent&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Cardio-Fat-Burn/dp/B00DUGC202/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Cardio Fat Burn</a>&nbsp;DVD.  Also new to this DVD is that Mary Helen uses light weights with the arms segment, which she doesn't do on any of her previous DVDs.

The Total Body Strength and Cardio section uses standing moves with weighted arms work (using two- or three-pound weights), so there is a nice cardio factor to this workout. This first workout is also the most balletic of all her workouts; it's all done standing, and you use poses and postures that are very ballet-like.  This workout starts with standing ab work, and then moves into leg work and then arm work that uses the legs.  The second workout, Total Body Toning, is all done on the mat and doesn't use weights at all. For this second workout, you do a set of C-curve work for the abs/core, two series of bridges, some outer thigh work, and a mini-set of Swan Arms.  (If you want to know true pain for the arms, try her fifteen-minute Swan Arms set on the Blasts DVD! Your arms will be fried!) At the start of both workouts, Mary Helen says that they are workouts that she uses for travel, but since the first one relies on hand weights, I think that it's not the best travel routine.

As with her first two DVDs, Mary Helen counts each rep on this new DVD, and she does four sets of eight counts for each exercise. If this bothers you, as mentioned, you have the option to turn off her voice.

Some of the moves are repeats from other workouts (like a bridge series), but there are plenty of new exercises to make this not feel like a repeat of her other DVDs.

As with the other DVDs, these are filmed in a white studio, with classical piano music playing in the background.  I find it really relaxing to have this backdrop and setting -- and am always surprised at how Mary Helen can smile and be so positive, even when she's killing us!

I bought a pair of the&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Capezio-Women-s-Daisy-Ballet-Shoe/dp/B002CQTY84/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Capezio Women's Daisy Ballet Shoe</a>&nbsp;to use when I do Mary Helen's workouts, and would recommend them.  You don't need a ballet shoe, but it's nice to have the extra support, and wearing them makes me feel a bit more graceful than I otherwise am. :-)

I'm really glad I pre-ordered this one, and know I'll use it a lot!

UPDATE ON 12-19-13: Someone asked in the Comments section of my review about the intensity level of this workout, and I would say that it is a bit easier than the other workouts, but still challenging.  Because you're not doing as many reps of each move, it doesn't feel as tough as perhaps the Classic or Blasts DVDs, but it is still challenging.

Today I completed it for the third time, and still felt nicely worked out. I don't shake as much as I do with the other workouts, but still feel nicely challenged.

UPDATE ON 1-7-13:  After doing a few weeks of Sylwia Weisenberg's Tonique workouts, Ballet Beautiful, and Dream Body (using the workouts from the two sets&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Body-Cardio-Series-5-DVD-Set/dp/B00EBRWWG8/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Body Cardio Series 5 DVD Set</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Dream-Body-Workout-Series-5-DVD-Set/dp/B00BACDFHC/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Dream Body Workout Series 5 DVD Set</a>), I started seeing big improvements in my arms and legs -- especially in a slimming of my saddlebag area, which is one of my big problem areas.  It's been a great rotation for slimming down my larger lower half.

UPDATE ON 3-18-15:  If you need more of a low-impact cardio workout, then I'd recommend the new&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Ballet-Beautiful-Swan-Arms-Cardio/dp/B00S02R1G6/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Ballet Beautiful: Swan Arms Cardio</a>, which just came out last month.  Since you leave one foot on the ground at all times with Swan Arms Cardio, it's easier on the joints.",1386115200,109,6168,5.562566844919786
5990007,3,B00FF9SKPI,"I am an avid work out nut. I have had personal trainers, I always have a gym membership and I've been a runner since I was 15. I have worked out avidly in classes like kick box, boot camp, body pump, 3D Core, etc. I am no stranger to working out, and I consider myself pretty athletic.  I like the look of dancers, though, so I decided to try the Ballet Beautiful series. So far, I have this Sculpt and Burn Cardio blast, and the first DVD, the 60 minute classic DVD.

I have to say I like MHB. I think she's pretty and sweet. She knows ballet. BUT...this DVD was kind of disappointing. I like the 60 minute classic DVD better than Sculpt and Burn Cardio . Basically, the first part of this DVD was a lot of ""standing abs"" which confused me, and arms. I think she needs to work on telling us non-dancers some technical things like how far apart to spread our feet, etc. I did not feel like it was a cardio exercise. Maybe if I try it a few more times and get used to the movements, maybe I'll feel like I had a cardio work out. The second part of the DVD was a condensed version of her 60 minute classic DVD. Since I had already done that Classic DVD earlier today, I skipped the second part.

Alas, I neither felt like a ballerina, nor did I feel beautiful after this ""work out.""

However, I am willing to give it a few more tries, though, for the sake of muscle confusion, and mix things up a bit.

I gave this 3 stars because I think this DVD has potential. I think people who are beginners at exercising may find it challenging. While I am not in love with this like I am the 60 Minute Classic DVD, I am not totally dismissing it, either.",1386028800,24,1642,4.102803738317757
5990058,4,B00FF9SKPI,"I purchased this after I gave a rave review to her total body workout. I was hoping to change up my routine a little, but I was a little less excited about this video. I don't feel like I get the same results and it's not as simple and straightforward as her other video. It's a little more complex. Still a good workout, but I far prefer the total body one because it's all floor work and doesn't require weights and need as much room.",1474675200,2,436,4.141176470588236

5990063,4,B00FF9SKPI,"Love this workout. I will  say that this is not for beginners. I do a lot of pilates and have done other ballet and barre workouts. This workout (and all of Mary Helen Bowers workouts are of the same format) starts where every one else  leaves off. Not for the timid. It will take me a while to be able to do the entire 30 minute workouts. I do the travel one. I don't have perfect form (yet). I work on following her but it's hard. But I do feel it for hours after doing it. I also feel it a lot the next day. That's not bad-- that's very good . She is nice but demanding. There is very little modifications. If you have to ask what the modifications are for this workout, you are not ready for this workout. (I am not being rude, I am being honest). I  know how to modify so I can't go full out, I can't always keep up, I try to keep my form in sync but it's not possible (yet).  I am working 15 -20 mins of this workout. The toning workout on the same disc will get the same treatment. I do have reviews on 2 other workouts of hers. If you want to be really making a change in your body and posture, this is a great one to choose.  (along with  Valerie Waters,  Cathe Friedrich and Jackie Warner.)",1465948800,6,1200,3.975

5990120,5,B00FF9SKPI,Ballet beautiful always delivers! It may look easy but its not especially the mat work. If you do this and say its dumb and easy then you aren't engaging your muscles. I started ballet beautiful after I had my first baby and after a few months of a combo of her dvds i was fitting into size 0s and 2s (I was wearing an 11 right after birth which is quite big for me as I'm only 5ft 3) and had never been so toned and sleek looking. Now after baby #2 I'm back at it full on and seeing major results in just 4 weeks of only ballet beautiful i am fitting into my sz 3/4 (I was in a 6 a month ago) pre-pregnancy jeans and am starting to look trim again. I would have to say total body is my favorite and all the other dvds are in close second.,1447200000,7,739,3.8366013071895426
5990121,3,B00FF9SKPI,"This is probably a good workout if you have previous ballet experience. There is not much explanation or direction. Also, it is hard to tell what she is doing, I had to face a mirror with the video behind me to try to imitate her.",1446854400,3,230,4.133333333333334
5990122,3,B00FF9SKPI,"I really wanted to like this DVD and it does have some good points.  Both workouts are definitely challenging, and really get into the muscle groups.  The queing is adequate, as are the explanations of most of the exercises, just not how to modify them.  The reminders to stay on form are timely, and for the most part the camera is focused where it needs to be so that you can see what is going on (although every now and again they feel the need to do a closeup of hear face and shoulders which teaches nothing)

But there are also quite a few downsides here.  First of all, this woman is supposed to be a trained instructor.  Either she teaches classes in front of a mirror with her class behind her, or she hasn't learned from years of training people, and/or never bothered to read 15+ years of reviews of other workout and dance videos that say DO NOT FACE YOUR AUDIENCE AND SAY TO USE THE RIGHT AND THEN USE YOUR RIGHT SIDE!!  Many people will hear the instructor say ""stand on your right foot and do this other thing (kick, make circles, etc)with your left leg"", but the viewer is experiencing a mirror image that is doing the exact opposite and it makes learning much more frustrating for a lot of learners -- and that's why they've been complaining about this sort of sub-par teaching on Amazon for as long as people have been writing reviews.  Perhaps the instructor or the producers of the DVD should have thought to look at reviews to see what people do and don't want from a workout.
There are times when Mary Helen seems aware that she is not capable of swapping her instructions to help her viewers and instead of saying ""left"" or ""right"" says to use ""this side"" and then shows you.  That is far easier for most people to comply with because there is no disconnect between what you see and what you hear.

Another issue I have with this DVD is that many of these exercises are extremely hard....and that is a good thing, but to wait until you are more than halfway through a set or even almost at the end of a series (the abs series is the worst offender) to finally give a modifier for the exercise is ridiculous.  She is asking people to get frustrated and give up on her workouts which is a shame because they are very good, but she seems completely oblivious to the fact that many of the people doing this DVD are not familiar or conditioned enough to do the workout as-is when they first start it.  I would almost swear that there was someone telling her from behind the camera that she needed to put in modifiers.

I ordered 2 of her DVDs at the same time because they had such stellar reviews.  I will continue to do this one because I believe it is a good workout (if you have back issues, please don't try to do the bends in the cardio section as quickly as she does them....she also neglects to mention this), but I really hope that the other DVD is better.",1443571200,4,2883,4.33457249070632

I don't want the tight, round, ""body building "" type muscles anymore.. I had all through my 20's and 40's. (Running, kickboxing, weight training,mboot camp, etc..) I want the long lean elegant shape as I head into my 50's and onward. Not to mention ballet reaches all the tendons and ligaments, and smaller often neglected muscles of all the other exercise choices.. Which is so important especially as we age. The stretches really help the aches and pains.

This is the trick! I got 3 more of her dvds as well, cant wait to try them.

I have Travey Anderson, Tracey Mallet, Ballet conditioning, Ballet Body, and Nyc Ballet dvds too. This one is different. They each are unique an great in their own way.

Its similar to yoga, a more focused, inward tightening, inward strength and control, than outward motion or movements.",1438819200,4,977,4.635838150289017

But by the end, you'll be sweating and cursing. She's not the best instructor and often breezes through instructions and stretches. However, it's fairly easy to follow along, even for someone with no dance background.

As a non-dancer, I wish she'd spend more time discussing the toe positions and foot placement. Maybe she does so in another video, and I just haven't tried it yet. Don't let that keep you from trying this video. It's a really intense workout and doesn't take long to see results.",1438819200,2,657,4.7631578947368425

You think you'll be getting a nice break here, with slower movements and pretty music to listen to. You'll think it'll be a cake walk. You'll think it'll be easy.

Oh honey, no. No, no, no, no, no. No. No. Just no.

Be prepared for some pain. Be prepared for muscle burns, blood, sweat, and tears. Well, maybe not blood, but definitely a lot of sweat, and a bit of tears here and there. ;-) I definitely recommend this to rotate with her Cardio Fat Burn for women who are more concerned about overall weight loss rather than just strictly body sculpting. I like that I can just forfeit my boring walks, jogs, or running around the neighborhood that I used to do before. Now I can do my cardio with Mary Helen Bowers, with her beautiful ballet body that I aspire to look like in about a year from now. Some of her moves may involve some complicated foot work, if you are not a ballerina. That's okay, just try your best and be yourself.

I don't have a problem with her voice or the setting. The only thing I wish is that the camera captured more of her form or that maybe she talked more about form. With some moves, I feel awkward.

It is a great workout making me realize how much id allowed myself to get out of shape. The routines are easy just doing them over and over  make it difficult. She does have the habit of miss counting (something all dance teachers do) so rather than the 4 sets of 8 counts sometimes you might get an extra few counts especially when she is explaining something.

5990264,4,B00FF9SKPI,"Just completed the first workout on the video.  I was shocked that it got me sweating.  I used 4 pound weights.  Have been doing a lot of Jillian Michaels DVDs (30 Day Shred, Ripped in 30, Kickbox Fast Fix and Banish Fat & Boost Metabolism) and decided to mix it up by doing something more elegant.  I was also shocked to find that I also need to work on my balance.  I would say that I am moderately to above average in shape.  I did sports in high school in college and during my post-college years, I ran and trained for marathons until I got pregnant which is when I switched to yoga and swimming.  Since I am a working mom to a toddler, I found it hard to get to a gym or go out for a run, in my spare time.  So DVDs at home before my daughter is awake or when she is napping has been a good solution for me.  I found this DVD to be challenging.  Would need to do it a few more times to improve my posture and form to get even more benefit from working the muscles correctly.  I noticed this to be the case with the JM DVDs.  The better the form, the better the burn.  I also think I need to get some ballet shoes.  I kept taking my socks on and off because with the socks, I could do some of the foot dragging motions but without, I had less slipping and more stability.  I took off a star because sometimes I found it hard to actually see everything.  With her pale skin and white backdrop, I sometimes had a hard time seeing which way her toes were pointed or which way her arms were swinging (palms facing up or out, etc.) or if her back leg was bent or not.

I also mix in other things: running, spinning, Insanity, T25, etc.
Back in December I decided to give Ballet Beautiful a try again and something just clicked! I ended up buying all of her other DVDs, spent the month of January doing JUST her DVDs and lost inches everywhere! There is something in the way her exercises are designed that make them just work!
This is probably my least favorite of her four DVDs, but I'd still want it in my collection.
Since then, I've started an intense kettlebell program (yes, I know, I am all over the map!!), which I love, but still do 2-4 days of BB each week!

5990297,5,B00FF9SKPI,"While I absolutely LOVE Mary Helen's ""Classic/Total Body"" DVD, between work, chores, errands, dog sitting, horse riding and the occasional social outing (yeah right), finding the time & energy to exercise for a full hour had become increasingly difficult.  What I really wanted was a full-body, Ballet Beautiful workout that was neither too long nor too short.

She must have been listening.  :-)

The mat routine on ""Sculpt & Burn"" is very similar to ""Classic/Total Body,"" except it's under 35 minutes. At first I was concerned that it wouldn't be as effective, but in some ways it's actually better.

First of all, the Stomach section is longer and works the abs far more deeply.  I could actually see my stomach start to pull in after ONE workout, similar to ""Callanetics.""

Next comes lots and lots of bridge variations that really work the Seat, Hamstrings & Calves.  No, she doesn't do her famous ""Inner Thighs from Hell,"" but keeping your knees together during all those bridges more than makes up for it.

The Outer Thigh exercises seem a little easier to me, but I can feel them reach all the way up into my upper hips...yes HIPS, people!

She also holds all of the stretches quite a bit longer, which is a huge improvement over her other videos.  I don't know about the rest of you, but I'm the type of person who needs a good, long stretch.

There's a short Arms series at the end which is really excellent, but I wouldn't have minded a bit more. I suppose you could always sneak in ""Classic Arms"" or ""Swan Arms"" on the days in between for an added boost...it's up to you.

The whole Ballet Beautiful system allows you to create shorter, more customized workouts, but here Mary Helen manages to take all of the guesswork out of it.  You could do this mat workout exclusively and still get amazing results, or mix it in with her other workouts if you're feeling ambitious.

FINALLY a way to be super-toned and still have a life!",1395187200,31,1938,4.60932944606414
5990298,5,B00FF9SKPI,"I am 47, I really love the simplicity of ballet beautiful, in its background and music. However... this DVD is not easy in the fact that you have a lot reps to build up to in the toning part, and in the standing part with using the weights in the standing series and going up to 5 lbs should prove to be a challenge, if you are holding your muscle's in and are conscious of your movements you will tone your arms and legs . I am not using weights yet, I have only been doing this for 2 weeks, also I am using the Total Body DVD on alternate days, so I don't get bored . the 2 DVD's that I am using has actually changed my body shape to a small degree, in 2 weeks 5 days each week, my pants are fitting a little looser,  Mary Helen says in an Interview that you can do 5 sets of 8 for the advanced if you want, that is 40 reps people, which is plenty. I really love this DVD , it is awesome for beginners  to the method but you can grow with it also, and its low impact which my body appreciates. For all the complaints about how short her stretching is Pause the DVD , you have the Remote. I personally stretch way longer than she does and she tells you to pause the workout, for Water, Stretching, even just to take a break which I have to do because my muscle's start to cramp up, my 2 cents worth, rant over. I also read another person's review of a different DVD of Ballet Beautiful and she uses 1 or 2 LB ankle weights to build muscle faster which is another way to make these workouts more advanced, I wouldn't go over that weight however.

I love the standing work that gets  progressively more intense and the addition of light hand weights for more upper body work.
The mat work is tough, but knowing it only lasts 30 minutes, and that it hits all the muscles, helps me get through the burn.

Another reviewer said to skip this one and try one of her earlier DVDs to decide if her method is for you, but I'd recommend this one for a beginner because she holds the stretches for longer and because part of her method is standing work like the one in the first workout.

5990304,4,B00FF9SKPI,"This dvd is broken into two 30 minute workouts. The first is mainly standing arm work, sometimes using light hand weights, with a bit of swan arms thrown in. There's also a lot of stretching, particularly through the core. It's a relaxing workout that keeps you moving, but it's not challenging. I use it when I'm extremely sore from another workout and can't tolerate anything demanding, so for that reason it's a nice addition to the Ballet Beautiful routine.
The second workout is classic BB. Four sets of 8 for bridge, abs, inner thigh and outer thigh. It's extremely challenging. Mary Helen has also inserted a lot of isometric contractions (when you just hold your leg in the air for 60 seconds, for example), which are very difficult. The burn is intense! This 30 minutes is more challenging than anything of hers I've ever done before. I love it. Mary Helen is always mixing it up.
I've written before about how BB and the Tracy Anderson method 'fixed' my body after two years of dedicated Jillian Michaels workouts left me somewhat stocky, particularly through the thighs. Mary Helen and Tracy know how to give you long, lean muscles, and keep you unbelievably toned looking. Without changing my diet at all, I've lost 4 kilos since I stopped doing Jillian DVDs and started BB and the method three months. The weight has mainly come off my thighs and waist, and my arms look great too. My legs are so long and lean now! I can't believe how much my body has changed. My advice to anyone looking to get fit AND a lean dancer's body would be to avoid Jillian Michaels like the plague, and stick to DVDs like this one.

5990306,4,B00FF9SKPI,"I consider myself at an intermediate-advanced level of fitness.

I felt I got a good workout considering the low impact nature.  I worked up a light sweat and muscles reach the burning point.  I use this on break days from other high impact workouts.

Pros:  Instructor is low key and counts for most of the routine.  I love the count.  Very much puts me in mind of dance classes.  She also knows the value of silence.  I do not need verbal diarrhea or a constant stream of mindless pep talk.  A few words of encouragement --- or better yet just acknowledgement from the instructor ""that was tough"" since they cannot really see if you are doing a ""good job!"" or not and is meaningless --- at the end of tougher sets is enough.  I usually like a beat to follow but since we have a count, the piano music is very soothing and strangely helps me to get in almost a meditative state of mind while my muscles are burning during tough sets.  Production values are always high with excellent camera angles and sound.  What distinguishes this workout from others in the series are the light weights incorporated in the routine and done very well to blend with the ballet theme.

Cons:  There is a bit of dread factor for said sets that cause prolonged muscle burn.  I think it would be better if she took 20 second breaks between sets.  I put the pauses in myself when I need them but I usually strive to match the pace being set and this one is a killer.  On the one hand it is something to strive for.  On the other, if it is also tough for the instructor, it will probably never really get easier, rather you can just endure more.  As an example, I feel doing 50 push ups in sets of ten with ten second breaks is doable rather than 50 straight in a row and in the end, you did 50 either way, and that is enough for me.",1389398400,10,1813,4.245614035087719

The first workout raises my heart rate.  She uses 3 lb weights for the arm portion of the workout and you definitely feel the burn by the end of that portion.  The second workout is all mat work.  Both workouts are challenging but since you are working out your entire body in 30 minutes, I find this DVD is a little easier (probably why I really like it) than some of her other DVDs where you might be working out your inner thighs for 10 minutes and then your outer thighs for 10 minutes, and so on with the rest of your body parts up to 60 minutes.  Even though it may be a little easier, you still feel like you've worked your whole body in only 30 minutes which makes this DVD very convenient.

5990328,4,B00FF9SKPI,This workout is quite amazing. It let me to stretch my muscles well. Hope Ballet Beautiful continue to release more types of workouts to help us to shape our body.,1389225600,,163,4.466666666666667
5990329,4,B00FF9SKPI,"I wanted to add new workouts to my routine and I came across Ballet Beautiful. The workouts in this video are great and do give a cardio burn without the traditional huffing and puffing like typical workouts. If you do not know ballet foot positions, then make sure to watch the videos prior to performing them because she does not assume people may be novices. These workouts were a challenge for me, but the more I perform them the greater result I see from performing them. Its a good challenging workout and is a nice addition to anyone who wishes to build overall strength.",1389052800,11,578,4.5673076923076925
5990330,5,B00FF9SKPI,This is a great all over body workout!  You will definitely feel all your muscles being worked without the high impact that other workouts create. This workout will create long lean muscles just like dancers have.,1389052800,,213,4.916666666666667
5990331,4,B00FF9SKPI,"I have all the BB dvds and love them - but this one leaves me a tiny (tiny tiny) bit disappointed.

The good:
Just like the previous three dvds, you will get a great workout while feeling graceful and relaxed. This dvd has two 30-minute segments and while they're both killer, the first one (standing/cardio) is the biggest challenge to me! I don't even do it with weights (Mary Helen Bowers has some 3-pounders for it) and I'm getting my heart rate up and lots of good burn out of it. As I improve, maybe I'll just add some light soup cans or something. Not really keen on using weights period because my arms build muscle quite easily, but to each her own. After you get a little huff-and-puff going, the second segment is all toning work on the mat - my favourite part about Ballet Beautiful, and the part that I think gives the quickest and most dramatic results. Mary Helen knows just which muscles to work to give you a lean, toned look. Your own butt, thighs and midsection will start to surprise you - seriously.

The bad:
If you were looking to save money, this is the BB dvd I would skip. I mean for one thing, it's the third of the BB dvds (out of only 4) to have a bridge series (mat workout where you lie down, bend your knees and raise your pelvis to make a bridge). Same basic workout/move, but a teeny bit different on each of the three dvds it appears in. Make no mistake: it's a great move, and will get you great results with it, but once you know it... you know it. I'd rather this dvd introduced some totally new moves so you feel like you're getting something fresh to mix up your routine. For that matter, I don't know if I found any of the toning moves from the second segment to be dramatically different from what you can find on the previous three dvds. There are some swan arms (already on the green dvd), some ab work (very like what is on the pink and the purple dvds), and outer thigh work (similar to the first/pink dvd).

In conclusion, if you're such a BB fan that you'd love to expand your collection for the sake of expanding it (like me), then by all means, this is a good workout as always and you should get it. But if you're new to the BB series or looking to save a bit of cash, I'd get the pink or purple dvd first to see how you like this approach. Enjoy!",1388966400,12,2298,4.2063492063492065
5990332,4,B00FF9SKPI,"The image associated with this instant video is misleading!  This workout is Ballet Beautiful: Sculpt and Burn Cardio Blast, NOT Ballet Beautiful: Cardio Fat Burn, so if you are rotating the Ballet Beautiful workouts, please be aware of what you are purchasing!

That being said, I really enjoy this workout.  I find Mary Helen Bowers to be a wonderful coach with a soothing, yet not too annoying voice.  If you do not have a dance background or have never tried any dance exercise, this may move a little fast for you--I would recommend breaking it up into 30 minute segments after watching the full workout.  This will leave you 100% sore but also remind you to keep your posture in check for the duration of the day, and to keep your abs contracted throughout your day.",1388620800,4,772,4.647058823529412

5990335,5,B00FF9SKPI,"This is the third video of Mary Helen Bowers that I have used and loved!  I had been exercising at the gym and running and then doing lots of Jillian Michael's videos. I am in my late 40's and one thing I have noticed with my workouts and with other women my age is that it seems to shift us more to bulk up--I have a real tendency to do this.  While my husband loses weight with exercise, I put on weight with muscle, which is really not the look I am going for.  The Ballet Beautiful series has been great at lengthening and toning my muscles--my husband has even noticed and commented frequently!

I must admit that this can be at times excruciatingly hard, all while she is just smiling away doing leg lifts.  The workouts look like a joke--they remind me of ones Joan Crawford would do in The Women-but they are harder than most. I find that I do better sometimes in her other series by stopping the tape and doing extra stretches--especially with the out leg series as I have had troubles with my hip.  I also want to say that these workouts have really helped me with knee and hip injuries I have gotten from running.

I love this workout and have become addicted to it. The music is sort of meditative, as is her demeanor. I have been recommending it to all of my friends, especially those who like Pilates.  I also love that I can just do them for free (all you need is a mat and for some weights) on my own time and that each video can be broken down into 15 minutes, 30 minutes or 1 hour workouts depending on how much time you have.  They are great for travel, which I do a lot of.  I also am reminded of my ballet classes as a teen and it makes me want to improve my posture and form.  Thanks Mary!",1388102400,72,1711,4.154545454545454
5990336,5,B00FF9SKPI,"I have all the Ballet Beautiful dvd's and use them every week. This dvd is a fantastic addition to add to my BB rotation. I really like how the workouts are divided into 30 minute segments (great for a quick morning workout before work)  and target the whole body.  The standing routine is my favorite....it makes me feel like a ballerina! Since working out with only the BB regimen, my body has completely transformed. My legs are slender and lengthened, my butt has lifted and my arms are tone and not bulky at all.  I have even been asked if I am a dancer!!!!  I will continue to use all 4 dvd's forever!",1387324800,39,607,4.345132743362832
8615191,5,B00FF9SKPI,"The standing exercises in this DVD are amazing. However it is the mat exercises that really does it for me, especially the bridge and outer thigh exercises. I find the bridge workout in this DVD to be the hardest of all Ballet Beautiful bridge workouts, even when compared to those in the custom workout subscription. Of course, the results are incredible! After only 2 weeks, I can see muscle definition in my legs, the long and lean type of muscles common in a ballet dancer. Since this DVD does not have a whole section dedicated to stretching and given the intensity of the exercises, I find that it's helpful to pause for additional stretches after each segment.

One downside is that this DVD does not include an inner thigh workout. However when done in the right form, the bridge workout really works the inner thighs too. I cannot be happier with the results.",1514246400,,868,4.673202614379085

Not one of the toughest, not the blandest either. It's a good one to put mid week for me. It has a light cardio, light weights and a good mat session. Enjoy!",1509235200,,332,3.970149253731343

8615199,5,B00FF9SKPI,"Mary Helen Bowers has been my favorite for the past couple years; her routines are obviously ballet-inspired, and manage to, without incorporating any real choreography, work exactly the same muscles with the same intensity and pace, consequently giving you that long, lean dancer's figure.  As both a (former) professional ballerina, and mesomorph, I know how easily I can ""bulk"" up from so many other workouts, and also how it can definitely be avoided by doing the right ones...  This video, compared to some of her others, feels a bit easier, because of the slightly more ""fun"" nature of the light cardio at the beginning, and also because the repetitions are limited to four sets of eight, rather than eight...  So, yes, it is a bit less intense, but it's rather fun for a change, goes by very quickly.  The second half of the video, which is mostly core and a lot of leg work, is more intense, similar to her others.  But I think the combination- the balance of the first half and then the second- really works here.  Great as always.",1479513600,8,1040,4.686813186813187
