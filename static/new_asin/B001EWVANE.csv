3557875,4,B001EWVANE,"The first time I had ever seen The Howdy Doody Show was in this collection.  I was shocked at how close the show actually resembled the 'Krusty the Clown Show' from 'The Simpsons'!  Seltzer bottle gags, the live audience, the wacky co-hosts, etc.  They nailed it!

With that out of the way, I did watch these DVDs alongside my father... a fan of the show during it's original run on NBC.  He is not into television, or entertainment, and his memory is going, but as soon as I stuck the first disc of this 5-disc set in, and the theme song came across the speakers, he was like a little kid again!  He recalled all the names of all the characters, and even remembered specific episodes, from a show with over a thousand episodes!  It was great sharing this time with my father... I never see him all doe-eyed and enthralled by anything.

Now the actual set.  It's a collection of 40 'favorite' episodes, as well as the 5th and 8th anniversary shows, and the final episode.  Interviews with Buffalo Bob and staff are included, as well as an interactive timeline and a companion book of stills from the show.  The packaging is nice enough, glossy with a cut out of Howdy on the cover, but nothing special.  In fact the discs all slid out of their paper sleeves just as we were picking up the set to change discs.  The episodes are presented chronologically, but it would have been nice to have them listed, perhaps with descriptions, in the liner notes.  Dates and show summaries are available in the DVD menus.

The quality of the video is surprisingly sharp!  I guess I expected a vasoline haze over the older black and white clips, but they looked very bright, very sharp and defined.  The audio was also very strong and clear.  The final episode was culled from a VHS copy, and as such is fairly poor.  There are rough dubs after commercial breaks, and a grainy quality to the entire show.

Overall, its a very solid, if not comprehensive, set.  The childhood themes and fun age very well, and I think younger viewers would certainly still enjoy the show.  It's great to see the studio audience in each show.  Wide-eyed kids clapping and cheering, staring at the stars of the show.  Something that has definitely been missing from recent programming for children.  This set also serves as a very interesting look into the roots of television, and at one of the icons of television history.",1228262400,,2390,4.567058823529412
3557876,4,B001EWVANE,"Let me say, if you didn't grow up watching Mr. Doody you no doubt will not enjoy this collection of DVDs.

But if you DID, you know you will.

The DVDs present the shows in pretty much their original condition, although I'm sure they did some work on them, they have all the dust, scratches and grain expected from vintage TV.  And in this case, these things happen to help witht he enjoyment I think.

BUT... I think I'm seeing them better than I did back then, as the TV we had (and I'm sure many had) didn't have the best picture using the ever problematical antenna that Dad would curse every time he had to mess with it.

Dad on the roof and Mom yelling out the window about how the picture was doing. ME... waiting for them to get done so I can watch it!

The packaging with this set does not leave even one side unfinished, and all is brightly colored and draws you right into Doodyville feeling.

It comes with a picture booklet showing many stills taken of the actors, sets and kids, and is a keepsake even without the rest in the box.

As is the bonus DVD that's included, interviews, photo gallery and I think it is worth the price of the set alone.

I'll be uploading a photo of the open set to the product page.",1228262400,2,1224,4.218884120171674
3557877,5,B001EWVANE,"I'm giving this 5 stars because the sound and quality are good. The only problem is, this is suppose to be a 5 disc set and disc 5 is missing. I contacted Amazon and they are sending a replacement right out. Did anyone else receive a set with a missing disc?",1226102400,,258,4.078431372549019
3557888,4,B001EWVANE,This show certainly brings back old memories of earlier days. I would highly reccommend it to everyone. Truly a great classic to see.,1368662400,,133,4.826086956521739
3557889,4,B001EWVANE,"Actually, I like this collection a lot, but I think that the episodes I'm remembering from my childhood are from the years 1955 and 56, and they go from '49 to '54 in this offering.  They added the last show in '60, which I remember.  I do recommend this collection for its nostalgia and to learn about how the show began back in the late 40's.  The interviews with Bob Smith, Bob Keeshan (who later became Captain Kangaroo), and other people were very interesting.  This is a good addition to my DVD collection.",1364947200,,512,4.473118279569892

3557891,1,B001EWVANE,"I tried to buy this set From Amazon but they didn't have it.
That is after months of waiting and receiving emails that the DVD's were on their way.

3557893,3,B001EWVANE,"I remember (vaguely) watching this show when I was little so I was a little excited to see it as an adult. Maybe I had higher expectations than I should have because I was bored to tears with the first episode and couldn't watch any more beyond it. I passed the set on to friends that indicated they'd love to watch them. I think that you really have to be into Howdy Doody because it's an acquired taste (at best) otherwise.

This could have been a nice gift for older members of my family that had really remembered watching this live years ago...",1295481600,,549,4.330097087378641
3557894,1,B001EWVANE,"I'M 58 YEARS OLD AND I ALWAYS WATCHED HOWDY DOODY WHEN I WAS A KID. THEN I GREW UP AND HE WENT OFF THE AIR. I ALWAYS CHERISHED THE MEMORY OF WATCHING HOWDY AND I COULDN'T WAIT TO SEE HIM AS AN ADULT SO I BOUGHT THE DVD. LET ME TELL YOU, IN MY OPINION ""EVEN UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WAS THE BEGINNING OF TV"", US KIDS WERE OBVIOUSLY ENTERTAINED BY ANYTHING, BECAUSE AFTER ONE HALF OF AN EPISODE I WAS TWISTING TO FINISH WATCHING IT. TOTALLY BORING STUFF. TO ME THE MEMORY OF WATCHING IT WAS PROBABLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE GOOD TIMES AND CARE FREE LIFE THAT I WAS LIVING AS A KID. BUT WATCHING IT NOW WAS REALLY A DISAPPOINTMENT TO MY MEMORY. I WISH I LEFT WELL ENOUGH ALONE !  BUT THAT'S JUST ME !

3557897,5,B001EWVANE,"Howdy Doody, one of the most beloved and cherished icons of all time, entertained children of all ages for 13 glorious years on television, beginning back in 1947 and ending in 1960.  This special 5 disc collection highlights 40 memorable episodes from this beloved series, including a bonus disc with 3 additional episodes, including the final show in color.  Join Howdy and the gang, along with Buffalo Bob Smith, Chief Thunderhud, Princess Winterspring Summerfall, and the always funny and mischievous Clarabell the Clown, as they take us on a wonderful journey back to a more innocent time when commercials were a part of the show, everything was in black & white, and children everywhere believe in a cute little wooden guy named Howdy.

The video and audio quality is pretty good, considering how old the material is.  Not perfectly clear and crisp, of course, but certainly not so bad that it really detracts from the enjoyment of the show.  You get 10 episodes on each of the first 4 discs, with each episode running nearly 30 minutes each.  Three additional episodes are included on the 5th Bonus disc, including the memorable final episode, along with additional extras.

Perhaps the only real criticism is that all 5 discs are stored in paper sleeves inside the box set, which may cause the discs to fall out or be scratched if handled too harshly.  The box and bonus photo album booklet is a very nice touch though.  Truly an enjoyable set, even with the paper sleeves.

As a bonus, this review includes the original ""episode descriptions"" found inside the first 4 DVDs in this box set, along with additional descriptions of the bonus disc that were not originally provided.  Again, these episode descriptions are taken from the first 4 DVDs of this Box Set and were provided by the makers of this DVD Box Set.  They are offered here strictly as a way for fans to see which episodes are available in this collection.

3557898,5,B001EWVANE,"I grew up hearing a lot about Howdy Doody from my dad. This set allowed me more than just a glimpse - with all the episodes collected here I was able to experience the show as my dad was able to re-experience it.  I would say that it was a richer experience for him.  The feeling of nostalgia will likely carry you through these programs if you are of a certain age.  For those not around to experience the first time - it may be difficult to be that entertained by what you see.  This is very old, early television, and for historical purposes is well worth being preserved. But I didn't honestly find it very enjoyable and it wasn't something I was looking forward to seeing more and more of.

If you want to revisit your youth, this is the ticket.",1246492800,,750,4.253521126760563
3557899,5,B001EWVANE,"I was all set for some nostalgia, but found a whole lot more.  If you think TV is awful now, you must get this set--it was way worse.  I watched early episodes with my grandson and we both laughed till we cried.  Not because they were cute, but because we couldn't believe early TV was so 'rustic'.  We've come a long way, baby.

As a young child, like most others, I was glued to this program and obviously thought it was super at the time, but looking at it as an adult all these years later is very enlightening.  Yes, it reminded me of what we looked like and how innocent the kids in the Peanut Gallery were compared to young ones these days, and it showed how difficult live TV was then.  It is now, too, but they were just figuring things out then and it showed.  The props and credits were anything but sophisticated and there was a good bit of fumbling around, but my favorite part was the commercial.  Yes, the ONE commercial in the half hour segment.  It was easily 3 seconds long and consisted of showing a sign with a picture of the product--Mars Bar 5 cents--and everyone was sufficiently embarrassed even to do that that they felt the need to offer a toy for 5 cents in gratitude for our watching it.  Oh, how we've changed.

If you remember Howdy Doody fondly from childhood, you'll get a kick out of seeing the characters again, but even if you're just curious about early TV, in case you think they were the good old days, you have to see this.  They weren't. I didn't remember the silent movies in early episodes that were narrated, badly, by Buffalo Bob, nor the fact that Howdy was so big or so bossy. These episodes are a selection of the best, so they say. I can't imagine what the worst looked like. Simply hilarious and definitely recommended.",1244851200,,1768,4.370030581039756
3557900,5,B001EWVANE,"This set made me rediscover a treasure trove that says more about American entertainment, technology, consumerism, and society than many textbooks.

This is one of television's very first shows, and the creative team was learning as they went, so judging it from the standpoint of today's taste may not yield the proper perspective. After i watched the shows in this set, i visited amazon for any and all books about the show and found one that tells the good and the not-so-good (""Say Kids, What TIme is It?""), Buffalo Bob's side of the story (""""Howdy and Me"") and the overwhelming amount of details, episodes and, most of all, merchandise (""Howdy Doody Collector's Reference""). It's a fascinating epic saga of how a show progressed from radio to TV as the baby boomers grew up, started buying stuff, and gradually needed more bells and whistles to amuse them (for instance, the more lavish Mickey Mouse Club, trouncing Howdy in the ratings, clearly influencing their more ambitious stories and effects).

I even started buying the new shows from the 1970's, which are actually quite good for their genre, and feature many of the same talents behind the original show.

Because the box does not list the episodes, I took the liberty of creating the following list, based on my learnings from various sources and the screen menus on the discs themselves.

1949

3557901,5,B001EWVANE,"Even if you didn't grow up with the show, you probably have seen the face and heard the name! Perhaps you noticed it playing in the background of that notorious scene in the latest Indiana Jones adventure? ""Howdy Doody"" is an American icon. The freckle-faced, red-haired cowboy marionette was the star of his own children's television show from 1947-1960, one of the first TV shows ever (originally named ""Puppet Playhouse""), alongside his creator ""Buffalo Bob"" Smith! Each episode, Howdy and his human and puppet friends, including Clarabell Clown (originally played by Captain Kangaroo, Bob Keeshan), Chief Thunderthud, Princess Summerfall WinterSpring, Flub-a-dub, and more, would continue an adventure (often an attempt to solve some sort of mystery), watch an old-time movie, and sing and interact with the kids watching from the Peanut Gallery. Oh, yeah, and the cast would hock everything imaginable! Well, this was back in the days when the commercials were part of the show, which doesn't give a very good impression but was a necessary evil of the time.

Watching ""Howdy Doody"" today is a retro delight in small doses, even if you didn't grow up with the show. Of course, if you DID grow up with the show, it must be a thousand times better! Though, don't expect it to entertain small children today. ""Howdy Doody"" is just so very different from what plays nowadays! Keep these things in mind when considering to pick up this very fine release from Mill Creek Entertainment. Forty episodes are featured here on four discs, and a fifth disc holds bonus features. The 40 episodes are ""fan favorite"" selections from the '40's and early 50's episodes, all black and white and featuring the earlier group of characters. It's quite interesting to see how the show changed and settled from the very earliest episodes. The Bonus disc holds 2 anniversary episodes and the famous final episode, which is particularly interesting to see. This 1960 final episode is in color and certainly looks different compared to those early ones, even if some things never changed. The final episode, of course, is best remembered for being the one in which Clarabell the Clown finally speaks, and overall it is a very touching goodbye. Make sure you watch plenty of the older episodes before this one to get the full effect. Also on the bonus disc is a fine documentary of interviews with Buffalo Bob and others from possibly as recently as the 1990's, an informative, interactive timeline, and a photo slideshow. The packaging itself is delightful too, and it includes a lovely ""Memories Book"" of photos of the cast and kids. If you are a Howdy Doody fan, this lovely set is a must! If you are less familiar with the show and just feel like taking a time-machine to the late '40's and early '50's once in a while, then you may want to check it out too and see what all the hype was about! Definitely a product of its time, but a delight to look back upon in this age when Dora the Explorer and Hannah Montana are everywhere you turn!",1235001600,,3021,4.809615384615385
3557902,5,B001EWVANE,"Since I belonged to the Captain Kangaroo generation, Howdy Doody was a bit before my time. I only read about the show in the TV Guide, or heard about Howdy Doody on television shows about the early days of TV.  I must say I was surprised when I saw him on these DVDs. He was always so big and colorful in pictures and magazine covers...in the genuine episodes he's just a scrawny little wooden guy! I've watched two episodes and intend to watch them all, but it's not turning out to be an easy watch. The time period is fascinating to me...the kids from the '40's & '50's...the lessons being taught...but the episodes are just very sloooow going.  This would be a fabulous gift for an avid Howdy Doody fan, however. It's a gorgeous DVD boxed set!",1234742400,,746,4.437956204379562
3557903,4,B001EWVANE,"Nice set, but not understanding the legal issues involved, a worthy addition would have been the great 'Happy Days' episode featuring 'The Howdy Doody Show' when Richie got a picture of Clarabell without his make-up, and thought about helping his budding journalism career by selling it to the Milwaukee Journal",1233187200,,311,5.24
3557904,4,B001EWVANE,"I'm a little bit young to really remember Howdy Doody on TV, but watching these sparks a distant memory of the show.

Each of the 40 episodes follows the same basic formula: First the cast has some conundrum or dilemma that needs solving. A guest may be introduced. Then they show an old silent, slapstick film, which Buffalo Bob (or his replacement) narrates to the children in the audience.

Each episode is complete with the original commercials, which were part of the show in those days. The video quality is so-so by today's standards, but pretty good considering the age and quality available for video during the 1950s (they were not shot on film).

The standard formula has been copied by other children's shows and it most reminds me of Mister Rogers Neighborhood in form. This may or may not be good for your children, depending on their tastes, though the suitability for children is certainly not in question. This is probably most applicable for adults who want a romp down memory lane, though children with a tolerance for ""old"" things would certainly enjoy it.",1231891200,,1076,4.805405405405406
3557905,4,B001EWVANE,"For those who watched these shows when they originally aired, I'd imagine they'd give them 5 stars, as they're probably a treasured part of older Boomers' childhood.  Today's kids might not `get' why the show was popular, given that TV (and entertainment in general) is much more sophisticated these days.  The Howdy Doody show, in retrospect, was an important show, not only for children's programming, but for the development of television as a whole, as it helped put NBC on the map in the early days of TV.  The 40 shows contained in this set are from around 1949 thru 1954 (with the exception of the color `last' epi from 1960 included here as a bonus).  The show itself is quaint and from a more innocent time: it was a pretty simple show, relying on audience interaction, wholesome themes, low-cost props, musical numbers, and (at least early on) silent ""Old Time Movies"", which were actually edited Mack Sennett and Mickey McGuire films (that Mickey Rooney was in as a child), to fill out the daily half-hour running time.  Later on in the series, plotlines developed around a growing cast of characters, which included the somewhat politically incorrect Chief Thunderthud and Miguel the Mexican (epi's that are included in this set).  If you enjoy the Simpsons, you'll notice that the Krusty the Clown Show is a very close homage to Howdy Doody's show, with the live audience (a la the Peanut Gallery), call-and-response, Itchy and Scratchy films (in lieu of Old Time MOvies), cast of odd sidekicks, etc. all mimicking aspects of Howdy Doody.

The set itself has a pretty generous running time (21 hours) for a pretty reasonable price - the bonus disc has an insightful  hour mini-documentary about the show's early days, as well as three bonus episodes (including the final, color, hourlong epi from 1960) and a trivia timeline.  Original commercials were left in the shows, and are pretty neat to see, though the early shows had no commercials.  Video quality is quite good considering the age of the episodes - these look like pretty-to-very good kinescopes (better than usual) and the sound is quite good.  The picture booklet included is nice, though the disc holders are those pocket-type ones that everyone hates - the discs can get scuffed easily taking them in and out of the pockets.

Overall, a nice sampler package from the early days of TV, at a very reasonable price, that will probably most appeal to those who saw the episodes as children.",1231891200,,2464,4.854415274463007
3557906,5,B001EWVANE,"Howdy Doody is one of those cultural icons that I was familiar with even thought I had never seen the show. I knew the names Buffalo Bob Smith and The Peanut Gallery, and I could never forget the episode of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Happy-Days/dp/B001E6FMMU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Happy Days</a>&nbsp;where Ritchie gets a photograph of Clarabell the Clown sans make-up, and choose to destroy it in the end.  But I was far more familiar with the parodies and homages such as Krusty the Clown from&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Simpsons/dp/B000MR8W8I/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Simpsons</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pee-wee-s-Playhouse/dp/B0002IQB3A/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pee-wee's Playhouse</a>.

So I was pretty excited to see the real thing at last.  I didn't expect it to hold up as well as it did, but due to the familiarity of the material, having seen it imitated so often, I found myself enjoying it far more than expected. Unlike modern children's television, where programming is supposed to be educational and give the ""proper message"", The Howdy Doody Show was pure unadulterated kid's fun.  It must have been a blast to have been a member of the Peanut Gallery, and I bet those people cherish the memory.  I didn't know that Bob Keeshan, who would later become Captain Kangaroo, was the original Clarabell the Clown, or that the word ""kowabunga"" was a creation of this show as spoken by Chief Thunderthud.  In fact, there is so much of our modern lexicon and ""pop culture"" that comes directly from this show that I was completely surprised.

This DVD set is a fantastic introduction to people like me who had never seen the show.  Forty episodes at ten per disk, all of these shows were deemed to be the ""best"" of The Howdy Doody Show.  The picture quality is not the best, and the show definitely shows its age, but I am sure when it was being filmed no one expected audiences would be watching it 60 years into the future!

There is a fifth bonus disk that has some great background on Howdy Doody, and one of the best extra features.  The final episode of The Howdy Doody Show, broadcast on September 24th, 1960, features the touching farewell by Clarabell the Clown, and is the only time the character spoke during the entire series run.  Close up on the clown's face, and a soft ""Goodbye kids"" is accompanied by small tears.  Fade to black and the historical show is finished. A beautiful ending.",1231372800,,2582,5.473551637279597
3557907,4,B001EWVANE,"What time is it kids? It's Howdy Doody time!

This 5 disc set features 40 episodes of one of the earliest shows on NBC, and a show that set the pattern for children's shows for decades to come. It's an entertaining trip down memory lane for those who watched the show originally, though it may be a bit boring (and not ""colorful"" enough) for today's kids. Most of the situations that are seen in these episodes aren't that different from the kinds of jokes and gags seen in today's shows, though obviously the production quality has gone up a little bit, as have the gimmicks that can be pulled with modern technology. The sound is fair, as is the video quality (though both are great when you consider that the episodes are around 60 years old).

Howdy Doody, Buffalo Bob Smith, Clarabelle, and other recurring characters make the show lively and fun. While some may complain that this isn't a ""complete"" collection, I'd argue that 40 episodes of Howdy Doody is more than enough for anyone. Some may want to sit down and watch over 10 years of episodes, but I'm happy with the episodes shown here (pulled from between 1949 and 1954). The final episode (broadcast in color) is also included (on the bonus 5th disc).

All in all, this collection is worth watching (or at least worth having if you ever feel like watching an old episode of Howdy Doody). For those looking for just that, this set won't steer you wrong.",1231200000,2,1416,4.566929133858268
3557908,5,B001EWVANE,"Here's a rarity, almost an impossibility. The Howdy Doody show, FORTY episodes of late 1940s and early 1950s childrens's television, restored for all to enjoy! The quality is very good throughout, judging that most of the five discs are kinescopes, some with wavering sound. Some of the earliest memories I have of the show were not so much the puppets, but the clips from old time movies that showed up on Howdy's program. A Ton of Fun, referred to by Bob Smith as ""The Three Tons of Fun"", introduced me to silent comedy. The Smith Family with little Mary Ann Jackson, later to star in the Our Gang comedies for Hal Roach, really stands out in these 1920s Sennett reels. Buffalo Bob makes it tough to find out who REALLY starred in some of the comedies by making up names for the actors, like ""Bullets"" and ""Mary Schnikelfritz"",and sometimes throwing in names of his old friends and crew members in place of the real names of the actors. It's a rare treat to see the show through from it's very early days when Howdy was so polite that he always called Buffalo Bob ""Mr. Smith"", the Dayton Allen era of Ugly Sam and his hilarious version of the Flub-A-Dub narrating an old time movie, to the remarkable use of Allen Swift's voice as Phineas T. Bluster and others after Dayton was fired. We can see the evolution of Clarabelle from Bob Keeshan through Lew Anderson and witness how the clown changed from a child-clown who squirted seltzer at the Peanut Gallery and Bob Smith to the skilled trombone player and juggler who STILL squirted seltzer on all and sundry. There is a remarkable show with Milt Neil the cartoonist on the Howdy Doody comic strip doing team-up drawings with a fellow artist where Milt does one side of a character's head at the same time the other artist does the other side of the head, resulting in a perfectly balanced drawing that looks like the work of one artist! Disc 5 is my favorite. It contains the 5th, 8th and last (the 13th) anniversary programs. Fred Allen actually takes a seat in the Peanut Gallery on the 5th anniversary show, making fun of Buffalo Bob not being able to appear on-camera with the Howdy puppet (Bob Smith did Howdy's voice in the early shows) and ""helping"" Bob Smith narrate the old-time movie. Although not in the best of health, Fred Allen is a lot of fun to watch in this program. Gabby Hayes is featured on the 8th anniversary program in a funny suitcase packing routine with Clarabelle, and of course the last program from 1960 in color ends with Clarabelle's famous ""Goodbye, Kids"" in a pretty decent looking color copy. There is a half-hour of oral history provided by the television Academy on Disc 5 as well, with Bob Smith, Ed Kean the writer of the show, Bob Keeshan and others giving interviews. Keeshan betrays not a shred of bitterness at his poor treatment on the show, but speaks well of his role as Clarabelle and working with Bob Smith. It's still a great comfort to spend time with ""Mr. Smith"" after all these years, his charisma and love of the Peanuts still comes through after more than 50 years, especially when he pitches products. The growth of advertising to children in these early programs is especially revealing, starting with almost no sponsors and ending with too many. It's interesting that the Kellogg's cereal and Halo shampoo commercials are the only ones to use full cel animation in this pioneering era. It's so rare and remarkable to see this much early ""kidvid"" on home video, an era when there was little regulation and no knowledge of television's  impact on children. Yet, there is a cozy spirit of friendliness and hospitality in these Howdy Doody shows that is largely missing from the kid's video scene today. Mr. Rogers is one of the few ""live"" kid's hosts whose show is still running today that has some of the ""Smith"" charisma with children, and he's dead! So pick this up, buy two or three and send them to your friends. Maybe NBC-Universal will release a 40 episoder of ""Kukla, Fran and Ollie"" someday, or the Bob Clampett estate will release a big set of ""Beany and Cecil"" puppet shows on DVD! Let's show them that there is a demand for this kind of show on home video!",1231200000,4,4175,4.604026845637584
3557909,5,B001EWVANE,My mom was searching for this collection of Howdy Doody. I found it for her on Amazon.com. I gave it to her for Christmas and she just loved it. I will definitely be back to buy more episodes for her to enjoy. Great show!!!,1231200000,,223,4.090909090909091
3557910,5,B001EWVANE,"If you grew up with Howdy Doody and his friends, you'll love this DVD collection of 40 of the best episodes (including commercials).  If the show was before your time--as it was for me--you can still enjoy it for its retro kitchiness.  They just don't make kid shows like this anymore, which is a shame.  Also, the bonus extras are outstanding: a photo memories book and lots of interviews included in an informative documentary.",1231113600,,429,4.77027027027027
3557911,3,B001EWVANE,"Before watching this DVD I only had two ""frames of reference"" for Howdy Doody.  Don't get me wrong, I knew who Howdy Doody was but never watched a show before this DVD. The reason being is I had never seen it on television before or on home video.

As for my two ""frames of reference"", the first was my mother.  I can recall her saying that she grew up watching The Howdy Doody Show when she was a child.  She added that it was the only thing on television and she really enjoyed it.  She told me all about Howdy Doody and sang the theme song for me.  This conversation transpired when I was a child (in the early 1980s); because I was quizzical about what my mom watched on T.V. when was young.  The second ""frame of reference"" is this guy I went to high school with.  His name was Brian I will omit his last name for protection.  Anyway, Brian looked just like Howdy Doody.  The same face, hair, ears and freckles.  Brian was also a very tall guy.  So we would always call him ""Howdy"".  I am not sure how much Brian liked the nickname, but I think after awhile he came to love it.

As for this DVD set, it is a five disc set with forty episodes (ten episodes on each disc) of The Howdy Doody Show on it and a bonus disc.  These episodes from what I understand were selected by fans.  Now the one thing that upset me while watching many of the episodes is the dubious quality of picture.  These shows seem so banged up.  There are times the picture is too bright, too dark, and shaky or looks like someone rubbed Vaseline over the camera lens.  There were a couple of episodes I had to turn off because the picture was so hard to watch.  I would imagine that since these episodes were selected by the fans NBC/Universal could have done a better job cleaning these selected episodes up.  It should be noted that there were over two thousand Howdy Doody show, so cleaning them all up would be hard, but only cleaning up forty shouldn't be that much of a problem.  I understand that sometimes certain movies or shows can only be restored so much, but by watching this DVD you can't help but wonder if a better job could have been done.

The show itself was almost a variety television program.  It featured ""Buffalo"" Bob Smith (who also voiced Howdy Doody), Princess Summerfall Winterspring (Judy Tyler who died tragically at age 23 in a auto accident), Clarabell the Clown (three different actors played Clarabell during the show, the first ended up being Captain Kangaroo), Chief Thunderthud (known for saying kawabonga) and Howdy Doody.  Mind you there were a lot of other characters, but these were some of the main ones.  Another character that was shown a bit was a puppet called Flub-a-Dub that was a combination of several different animals.  I don't know about you, but the name Flub-a-Dub really makes me smile.

As for content, the show had a live audience of about forty children called The Peanut Gallery. Buffalo Bob would lead the show and talk to the other characters and The Peanut Gallery.  It was a very interactive show and was filmed live, so anything could happen and sometimes did.  Another thing I found very interesting were the commercials that were blended right into the show.  For instance, Buffalo Bob would be talking to Howdy Doody and then start talking about how great Colgate dental cream is.  As the show progresses, the commercials were little segments all of their own.  There was also a part in the show where ""old time movies"" were played.  This is where Buffalo Bob would show an old movie and narrate what was going on.

The fifth disc has three bonus episodes.  One of these ""bonus"" episodes is the final Howdy Doody show (the only episode on this set that is in color).  I must say that the final episode of Howdy Doody was pretty cool.  It was neat to see the progression compared to all the former shows.  Also on the bonus disc is a documentary about the history of The Howdy Doody Show.  I found this documentary very interesting.  Another feature on the bonus disc was a timeline of The Howdy Doody Show displaying all historic events that related to the show.  There is also a little book that has black and white pictures that journal The Howdy Doody Show.

I have to say that this set is perfect for the nostalgia factor, for someone who might have grown up with the show or wants a piece of the ""good old days"".  It should be noted that The Howdy Doody show ran for thirteen years (1947-1960).  This show also set a standard by being the first live television show to air Monday through Friday.  So in many ways this show set the trend for others.

It might seem like my rating is a bit harsh.  I took into consideration the quality of shows, the picture really does leave much to be desired.  Another issue is that many of the shows had cliffhangers, believe it or not.  So you will be watching an episode and have a cliffhanger, then the follow up episode isn't on the disc.  Now I am not going to loose sleep over a Howdy Doody cliffhanger but come on.  The packaging is horrible.  All of the discs are placed in cardboard sleeves.  I don't know why any company uses this disgusting marketing technique. Why one might ask, because it leaves the disc prone to scratches.  As a matter of fact, as soon as I pull out the first disc there were scratches visible.

I am interested to see if children today would be taken in by this show.  Many children are seduced by video games, cell phones, MP3 players and hi-tech animation movies.  Therefore, would The Howdy Doody show grab their interest?  Who knows maybe it would.  As for my two ""frames of reference"", I feel watching this show as shed some light on them.  I now have a window on what type of television and world my mother grew up in when I watch some of these shows.  I love the commercials, very nostalgic.  As for my friend Brian in high school, I think we were on point with the nickname Howdy Doody, they could be brothers!",1230076800,3,5937,4.429759704251387
3557912,3,B001EWVANE,"I grew up with&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sesame-Street/dp/B000H6SY8C/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sesame Street</a>,<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Reading-Rainbow/dp/B000FZEQUU/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Reading Rainbow</a>&nbsp;and 3-2-1 Contact.  These were shows that brought education to children's television even before the Children's Television Act mandated a certain amount of ""educational"" programming.  My parents were both huge propenents of ""Tv only for educational shows,"" so I had very little exposure to the world of non-educational Children's television.

For me, The Howdy Doody Show was a wake-up call.  This is as bad as it can get.

Don't get me wrong.  I didn't hate The Howdy Doody Show.  I even liked some of the jokes and segments.  But for children's television, this is appaling.  This made me realize why Sesame Street was such a revolution.  There is nothing remotely resembling educaitonal content in The Howdy Doody Show.  Sure, sometimes they'll offer some half-baked advice on making friends, but nothing really useful or interesting to kids.  Most of the show consists of songs about the show itself, or rambling gags with the clown and the puppet.

As a piece of TV history though, this show is fascinating.  My hometown even makes an apperance in the first episode, phoning in to ask about new affiliate stations.  The advertising is blatant, non-stop and strange.  It is usually more about the network than a particular product, which is telling about the world of early TV competition.

The format of the show is what I found most interesting.  Much of it seems like it was filmed live to tape, with little or no rehershal.  The kids often stumble over lines or songs, and the question and answer segements usually devolve quickly into the kids coming up with blanks and the host staring at them menacingly.  The puppet Howdy Doody often just falls limp, sometimes even needing the host to prod him before he moves again.  The clown is perhaps the scariest clown I've ever seen, a towering and bulky figure of silent menance.  If this is what Stephen King watched as a child,&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/It/dp/0451169514/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">It </a>&nbsp;makes perfect sense.

So, get this if you're interested in TV history, or as a cautionary tale of how un-educational children's TV can be.

A final note:  for you Simpson's fans, this is The Krusty the Clown Show.  No exaggeration necessary.  All the things that Krusty parodies, are right here, almost word for word, beat for beat.  Very bizarre to see.  I always thought Krusty was blowing things out of proportion;  he's a higher quality understatement, if anything.",1229990400,,2800,5.742092457420925
3557913,5,B001EWVANE,"Prior to receiving this beautifully assembled, lovingly thought-out and produced DVD set of 40 episodes of the 1950's children's show Howdy Doody, I had never actually seen the show, only brief snippets and still photos.  Howdy and company were a bit before my time (I am a member of the Captain Kangaroo generation), so I was curious to have a look at this iconic show from the earliest days of television.

It was like stepping back in time. All the children in the Peanut Gallery, dressed in their finest clothes, paying rapt, polite attention to Howdy, Buffalo Bob, Clarabell, Chief Thunderthud, and all the other characters, were absolutely charming.  Little boys in suits and ties and girls in frilly dresses are not something you see much anymore.  What struck me most profoundly was the gentility, even amid the antics and playfulness, of everyone on the show.  I also enjoyed the Olde Time Movies that Buffalo Bob ran during the show and the old commercials and plugs for various products like Royal Instant Pudding and Sugar (!) Frosted Flakes.

For people who grew up watching the Howdy Doody Show, this boxed set, which comes with a memories book and a bonus disc packed with fun stuff, will be a treasure trove of fun.  If you're thinking that your grandkids and great-grandkids will eat this up, however, I would caution you against getting your hopes up too high.  Most kids today will not find Howdy Doody all that entertaining.

This brilliant boxed set is trip down memory lane, gentle and sweet.  Fans of the show will find it a terrific bargain!",1229990400,,1565,4.784386617100372

3557915,4,B001EWVANE,"The 5 dvds packed inside this specialy designed box contain some of the most popular and requested of the Howdy Doody show.  My son and I are too young to have seen this even in repeats, but we are wringing immense enjoyment out of this set anyway.  The style of the show and its segments is a nice change from the modern ""kids"" show and the old commericals that have been left on are a kick.  Some shows ran too long and often to get a complete release, but for a show like Howdy Doody this DVD set offers up some of its finest material without breaking your bank or your storage shelf.  Howdy Doody has held up well over the years and has been keeping my son and I entertained for several weeks now.  Recommended for fans of vintage television, and the young at heart.",1229558400,,770,4.2465753424657535
3557916,3,B001EWVANE,"I'm about 17 years too young to've ever watched this show, but have always been curious about it over the years, until the box set I'd never seen an episode before.  I remember my parents talking about it when I was young & have seen little bits & pieces all through out pop culture , I've just kinda always been kinda curious.  Being the DVD junkie I am when I saw this I had to pick it up.  At just $30 retail for 40 episodes (or the $12 Amazon's offering it for, I got raped) I thought this'd be a great way to finally get to know the famous ""HD"" Show.  After popping it in, I realised... there's just no way I'll ever have any interest in watching this entire set all the way through.  While it is entertaining to watch some of these old shows for the historical value of them, there's just kinda no way I'd ever get into watching it just for it.  Granted, I am a 30 year old man now who has absolutely no nostalgic investment in this show what so ever, but there was just nothing really to make me wanna watch anymore.  I know for a fact though that are a lot of Howdy fans out there that'll will most certainly fall back in love with this show all over again, & it's about time more stuff like this is released.  If you're at all curious about this show like I was I'd strongly recommend renting this rather than forking over the cash  with out any prior knowledge.  I know other's review scores don't show it, but I think this ones strictly for the nostalgic out there.",1229472000,,1476,4.165492957746479
3557917,5,B001EWVANE,"I barely remember seeing Howdy Doody as a kid, but my husband remembers it fondly and has really enjoyed watching these shows again.

It is so funny how politically incorrect this show seems today.  You would never see characters roll eyes at kids these days.  It almost seems cruel, but I guess we all have become so sensitized to preserving children's feelings.  I'm not sure if that's a good or bad thing.

Anyway, this is a nice compilation of some of the most requested episodes on DVD.  Any fan of Howdy Doody would be overjoyed to receive this as a gift.  The included memory book is a nice added bonus and we enjoyed looking through it.

I am not sure that this show would translate to a contemporary child.  I haven't had any children over to try to show this to them, but I highly doubt it would be well-received by my nieces and nephews.  They won't watch anything that doesn't have a lunchbox and cereal attached to it in some way.  However, we (adults) look forward to watching more of the episodes.  This has provided us with many chuckles, especially the politically incorrect stuff that you would never see said to a child today.",1229472000,,1145,4.53170731707317
3557918,5,B001EWVANE,"I'm old enough to remember watching this, but don't remember much about it.  Clearly I must have see repeats as I was born in 1967.  I remember the characters more after seeing them yet again.  They obviously don't make children's television like this anymore, and that is sad.

I always had interest in watching this show again, but it never shows up.  Even if periodic runs, or Nick at Nite etc. But, this collection is perfect.  It contains just enough to relive and remember things you once loved.  You see the progression through the years, and it's fun to see the character development, and ingenious entertainment.

A bonus unexpected surprise are the commercials.  Those alone are worth the price of this set.  Seeing the Welch's Grape Juice commercial triggered traumatic memories of getting my fingers stuck in that big can.  I could not pull it out because of the metal pointed prong it creates when opened... and well... thanks for the memories.

This is a great set (and currently a great price) that should be shared with children of today.  So buy it for them, even though you know it's for you.",1229472000,,1110,4.71875
3557919,5,B001EWVANE,"I was six years-old when Howdy Doody went off the air, plus, having grown up in Detroit with its riches of local kiddy TV, it wasn't high on my list of priorities. That's not to say I didn't watch it at all--I did. It just wasn't my favorite show.
However, I'm a sucker for nostalgia and I've never outgrown my love for children's shows, so I was happy to have the opportunity to review this collection. I was even happier once I began to explore it.
It's no secret to anyone who has read my Amazon reviews of Universal releases that I pretty much find Universal itself contemptible. Therefore, I was literally shocked at what a fabulous job they did in putting together this set. First, the presentation is absolutely gorgeous--a beautiful, colorful, heavy-duty (no less) slipcase that encloses five DVD's and a Howdy Doody Memories Book. The first four disks contain 40 full-length episodes (which it's claimed are those most often cited as favorites), with commercials, from 1949 - 1954. I have to add here that while watching these, I got a tad lachrymose because not only was it sweet to see such wholesome entertainment, but the children looked like REAL kids and not cynical adult wannabes in miniature; I wanted to gather them in my arms en masse for a hug. The content itself is engaging and fun and something a young child today might enjoy watching with his parents. These episodes are all black and white, and the audio and video are remarkably good for shows this old.
Howdy Doody was the first show to be broadcast in color, and the fifth disk contains the final episode as the sole color example, in addition to two anniversary shows, interviews with the principals, and other goodies. The Memories Book consists of photographs (period); the set might have been improved had a guide to the disks' contents and maybe some written history been included. Other than that, and the fact that another episode or two might have been in color, this set is perfection.
Clearly, a great deal of love and care went into the development and ultimate realization of this set. Highest recommendation for nostalgia fans and/or parents of young children. It also might not be a bad idea to let Universal know that for once, they're on the right track.",1229299200,,2250,4.727735368956743
3557920,4,B001EWVANE,"This is a set of 40 episodes of one of the classic shows first aired on NBC in 1947. The town of Doodyville is the setting for this children's show.

The show also features Chief Thunderthud/Oil Well Willie, Ugly Sam, Mayor Phineas T. Bluster, and Princess Summerfall Winterspring. The show typically has puppets, Buffalo Bob, Clarabell and the princess Summerfall Winterspring and a gallery with about 40 kids. The show consists of action, tricks, songs, old time silent movies, and the commercials.

3557921,5,B001EWVANE,"Say kids, are you looking for the ultimate Howdy Doody DVD collection?  If so, well boy oh boy are you in luck, `cause here it is, and everyone in your family will really go for it in a big way!  This nifty little box is packed with five shiny new discs, each one chock full of wholesome Doodyville goodness!  Plus, along with the lavishly decorated fold-out disc holder, you'll find a swell booklet, loaded with rare black and white photographs.  Just be careful not to scratch those DVDs when you're sliding them in and out of their genuine cardboard pockets.

As all of America knows, Howdy Doody is a jovial, spindly-limbed marionette with a freckled face that strongly resembles that of Alfred E. Newman.  Howdy Doody was wildly popular way back in the 1940s and `50s, when HALO was a shampoo and not a video game.  The human host of Howdy's show is the avuncular Buffalo Bob Smith.  Buffalo Bob interacts with the kids in The Peanut Gallery and unabashedly pitches a plethora of products with all the enthusiasm of today's TV shopping salespeople.  Mr. Smith's zebra-striped assistant, Clarabell, is a mute clown who communicates by honking a horn, and delights in spraying folks with seltzer water every chance he gets.  The Puppet Playhouse's resident curmudgeon is the amply sideburned Phineas T. Bluster (whom Howdy calls ""Mr. BUSTER""); and it's resident pipsqueak is the wiggly-eared Dilly Dally, whose voice sounds a bit like Elmo from Sesame Street.  America's number one private eye, the puppet known as The Inspector, looks a lot like Howdy aside from his thin mustache.  The Inspector once conducted an investigation that proved there's only one talking cereal in the whole world: Kellogg's Rice Krispies.  There's also only one Flub-A-Dub in the whole world, and he lives in Doodyville.  The wisecracking ""Flub"" is a weird and comical creature with a face shaped like a bowling pin, a neck like a giraffe, floppy dog ears and the body of a seal.

Every Howdy Doody show begins with the singing of ""It's Howdy Doody Time""...which sounds an awful lot like Ta-ra-ra-Boom-de-ay.  Then Bob and Howdy educate kids everywhere about the swellness of the many excellent products that sponsored the program.  Watch the numerous episodes in this collection, and you'll learn all about how to defeat Old Mr. Tooth Decay by brushing your teeth with Colgate's extra good tasting Ribbon Dental Cream...especially after you've enjoyed some ""candy eating fun"" with the treat that can't be beat, the three-piece Three Musketeers bar (it only costs a nickel).  You'll also discover that if you want to grow up strong and healthy, you should eat as much Wonder bread as you possibly can, because Wonder bread helps build strong bodies in eight ways...and be sure to spread plenty of Blue Bonnet margarine on that bread, `cause Blue Bonnet margarine offers flavor, nutrition and economy.  Just look for Blue Bonnet Sue on the package.  But between commercials, Buffalo Bob always finds time to run a Howdy Doody Olde Time Movie on the Scope-Doodle. Olde Time Movies are silent movies, narrated by Bob Smith himself.  These ancient films often feature the aptly-named Tons of Fun--Vick, Clint and Bullets, or Mickey McGuire and the kids of Toonerville.

As you peruse this nostalgic collection, you'll hear Howdy sing several songs and jingles, employing his odd habit of changing one syllable words into two syllable words, as in ""frey-and"" (friend) and ""goo-ud"" (good); plus you'll get to experience the patriotic puppet's historic election campaign in his bid to become the first President of the Kids of America.  What's more, you'll learn the significance of the Fourth Feather of the Fifth Pheasant as well as the Lucky Left Leg of the Lima Llama.  You may even find out who the real ""Mr. X"" is.  Discs 1 - 4 each contain approximately five hours of classic programming, and disc 5 includes a generous helping of swell bonus materials, including the fifth anniversary episode; the eighth anniversary episode and the hour-long final episode (in color).  There's even a 26-minute documentary entitled, Howdy Doody, the Early Years, featuring interviews with Buffalo Bob and Bob Keeshan (Clarabell/Captain Kangaroo) as well as a Howdy Doody timeline and a photo slideshow.

Yes kids, no classic TV DVD collection would be complete without this heap-good Howdy Doody lollapalooza.  It's a circus of fun for everyone!  So ask Mom to place an order today, no box tops necessary (just a credit card).

That reminds me, I wonder if it's too late to send away for those swell looking Snap Crackle and Pop hand puppets...",1229040000,2,4612,4.97522816166884
3557922,5,B001EWVANE,"You can tell the creators of this box set put a lot of thought and effort into creating a worthy tribute to the Howdy Doody show.  The five dvd set includes 40 episodes of the show from 1949 to 1954, an additional three special episodes (including the final one in 1960) and some great extras.

The box set is in a cardboard box container. You open it by turning aside a cutout of Howdy Doody's face and pulling out a striped box.

In the box there is a Howdy Doody Memories Book. The book has a good number of photos from the show. They are great photos and really give you a sense of the show.  There are shots of Buffalo Bob, Howdy Doody, The Peanut Gallery,  Clarabell, Princess Summerfall Wintersping, Timber Tom, Heidi Doody, Chief Thunderthud, Phineas T. Bluster and Peppi Mint.

The five dvds are in a folded cardboard sleeve. The idea of a cardboard sleeve is a good one since I hate having to press down on the button in the center of many dvd holders. Here you just slip out the dvds, four of which have a picture of a different character from the show (the fifth being the bonus disk).

Each of the regular disks greet you with Howdy Doody asking ""hey kids what time is it"" and the answer is of course ""it's Howdy Doody Time."" You then see a small black and white television with Howdy Doody. If you hit episode select you see Buffalo Bob in a helicopter and then Clarabell holding a card explaining the episode corresponding to a particular date.

Each regular disk has 10 episodes. Disk one has 4 episodes from 1949 and 6 from 1950. Disk two has 2 episodes from 1950, 7 from 1951 and 1 from 1952. Disk three has six episodes from 1952 and four from 1953 and disk four has 7 from 1953 and three from 1954. As you highlight each date Clarabell's card explains what happens on that episode.

The shows are complete episodes with commercials included.  The commercials themselves are great to watch. I never knew that the original Three Musketeers Bar had three sections which could be broken apart or that the Snickers Special, a toy train, brought Snickers to ""your town USA.""

The bonus disc includes interviews with Buffalo Bob Smith, Clarabell and others related to the show. It has three special episodes which include the 5th anniversary episode with Fred Allen, the 8th anniversary episode with Gabby Hayes and the final episode in 1960. Also included is a great documentary about the show and a historical and interactive timeline.

I was born after the show ended but had heard about it all my life and had seen clips of it over the years. In watching the shows I was brought back to a time when life was much simpler. I was also glad to see the show still appeals to young children today.

This box set was lovingly put together. It is a must if you grew up watching the show and well worth getting even if you did not.",1229040000,,2840,4.428023032629558
3557923,5,B001EWVANE,"I suppose I got this collection because I am spending more time down memory lane than in real time any more. I understand this is endemic to middle age, so I indulge myself. The Howdy Doody Show was born in 1947 and I was born a few years later, so it was the mid-fifties (this was after HD was shortened to a thirty minute show) before I sat mesmerized on the old family couch and marveled at the existence of a flub-a-dub. By that time the show was vying with the likes of the Mickey Mouse Club and a lot of local television (in NY we had The Merry Mailman, the incomparable Mary Heartline, and the bizarre duet of Pinky Lee and Winky Dink). Even so, the Howdy Doody Show stands out in my memory as being my introduction to children's television, a term that had meaning in a time before children were regarded as miniature adults.

In watching these amazing episodes fifty years later, I can understand the attraction of the combination of human and puppet characters that ""peopled"" Doodyville (an unfortunate place name that caused us endless amounts of snicker sessions, and the opportunity to say an otherwise forbidden word in my parents' hearing).

I think that more than anything else, watching the old Howdy Doody Show put me very much in touch with my child-self by carrying me back to those days when I had (we all had) the ability to suspend incredulity. I remember fondly the kid whose mind was so unsophisticated, so unjaded, so unimpressioned that even when Howdy's strings gleamed in the spots and his wooden appendages clicked and tocked together, I still wanted to believe in him, and in a town whose mayor was named Phineas T. Bluster, and most of all I wanted to believe in flub-a-dubs. That's a lot of nice memories to get from this one collection.",1228953600,,1770,4.580441640378549

If I remember right, tv was only on a few hours a day and the picture wasn't that clear. So when I got these I was surprised to see shows I don't remember at all. It was a nice surprise. The only problem I have now is getting that theme song out of my head! There was something so naive about the show, it made me want to cry because you don't see this kind of show any longer. Everything now is so up to date and the kids aren't as naive as we were then. I seriously doubt many of them could sit through one episode of this show without sniggering. But then, I think these came out more for the adult group that were kids then anyway. And you will love them. There are 3 bonus episodes also, the 5th anniversary episode with guest Fred Allen, 8th anniversary episode with guest Gabby Hayes, and the famous 1960 1 hour (in color) farewell episode where Clarabell speaks. The old commercials are an extra bonus. They are as interesting as Howdy Doody. A very collectible item that you will enjoy for years to come.",1228953600,,1104,4.158878504672897
3557925,4,B001EWVANE,"I don't think I ever watched Howdy and friends, as a kid growing up in the 70s. The closest thing I had was Bozo the Clown which definitely owes its existence to Howdy Doody: an in studio audience, playing games with the kids, cartoon breaks.

I've always been into pop culture and had a fascination with the 50s so this set is quite interesting to me. The presentation is very nice, the included ""scrapbook"" has some great behind the scenes photos. The fact that anyone had the forethought to preserve the shows and these photos some 50-60 years ago is mind boggling at a time when TV was the height of technology.

Being a 30-something and watching the shows, I can certainly see the charm in them and get a kick out of getting a glimpse of a much more innocent (and less PC!) world. Nowadays, you'd flip through commercials but back then they were just as much a part of the show with the characters promoting the company's items on air..and how about those mail-away offers?

I don't think most of today's children, say over the age of 5 or 6, would enjoy this. They'd likely see it as boring (black and white?!?!) compared to the things they have now, but by golly, the show's ceratinly got values to spare which is something lacking in a lot of the current crop of children's programming. But if you're old enough to remember Howdy, or just want to take a peep into a window of the past, then this is definitely something you'd enjoy.",1228867200,,1440,4.467680608365019
3557926,3,B001EWVANE,"This is a set of 40 episodes, most requested by fans, of one of the classic TV shows first aired on NBC in 1947 when television was at its infancy. Although this is considered as children's show by the current standards, this remarkable show was directed to both young and old when this show was first aired. There are four CDs in this set with 10 episodes in each CD. Shows aired 1949-1950; the second CD contains episodes aired 1950-1952; the third contains 1952-1953 shows; and the fourth has shows aired 1953-1954. There is a fifth CD containing the; fifth anniversary episode, eighth anniversary episode and the final episode.

We have come a long way in making the modern day sitcoms with all the technology at our disposal to do any form of stunts, actions, acts, scenery, or bring a dead character alive with clever computer techniques. It is also equally refreshing to view the antique TV shows and reminisce the old times for entertainment and enjoyment: I especially liked the simplicity of life during those days.

The town of Doodyville provides the setting for the earliest nationally televised children's show. Originally aired as, ""Puppet Playhouse"" was renamed to ""The Howdy Doody Show"" in 1949, the series feature songs and the comics of the freckle-faced puppet, and his mentor Buffalo Bob Smith (Bob Smith) and the horn-honking Clarabell the Clown (Bob Keeshan, Bobby Nicholson, and Lew Anderson). The ahow also features Chief Thunderthud/Oil Well Willie (Bill LeCornec), Ugly Sam (Dayton Allen), Mayor Phineas T. Bluster, and Princess Summerfall Winterspring (Judy Tyler). The show typically contains the puppets, Buffalo Bob, Clarabell and the princess Summerfall Winterspring and a peanut gallery with about 40 children. Each show begins with Buffalo Bob asking kids ""Say kids, what time is it?"" and the kids yell it is ""Howdy Doody time,"" then the kids sing the theme song. The show consists of action, tricks, question and answers, songs, olde time silent movies, and the commercial component; the products of sponsors such as Mars Chocolate Bras, Kellogg's Rice Krispies, Welch's Grape Juice, Royal Gelatin Desserts, etc., were marketed during the show by asking viewers to use these products. The TV commercials were at its infancy, but the modern day sitcoms avoid direct campaign for the sponsor except during the commercial breaks.

In the episode aired on Feb 1, 1949, Buffalo Bob teaches children how to greet people, how to be friendly and working together. The episode aired on March 8, 1949 Howdy Doody answers questions from viewers, sing songs and play olde time movies. In the March 27, 1949 show, Buffalo Bob, Clarabell the clown, Howdy Doody and Flub-a-Dub search for a native tribe in Arizona that proves the identity of Buffalo Bob. In another episode, Captain Ugly Sam gets drenched by the Seltzer drink by the Clarabell the clown. In an interesting episode the Wing Ding celebrates the states of Nebraska and Wisconsin and peanut gallery must decide if Howdy Doody or Flub-a-Dub did a better job in honoring these states. This CD set offers an opportunity for all fans to enjoy antiquated TV shows known for their simplicity and honesty.

3557927,4,B001EWVANE,"When I was a kid, Howdy Doody was an afternoon ritual. It was a pretty funny show -- at least to a six-year-old.

Times change. Boomers might remember ""Howdy Doody"" with great affection, but the affection is not fully justifed. The show was aimed at a child's sensibility, not an adult's. (Compare and contrast ""Kookla, Fran, and Ollie"".) ""Howdy Doody"" filled a half hour on weekdays, and eventually NBC's coffers. (The preceding sentence is an example of the literary device ""zeugma"".) ""Howdy Doody"" never does anyting to upset -- or challenge --  a child.

There were sporadic atttempts to inject lessons about friendship, kindness to animals, and the like, but the prime focus was silly fun. Howdy and his friends were often off on some wild adventure, and when they weren't, Clarabell was playing tricks or squirting people with seltzer. It's not surprising that ""Howdy Doody"", as a lot of early television, borrowed heavily from vaudeville. As Bob Smith says in an interview, ""We didn't know what we were doing."" And to put it unkindly, it shows. Of the 2500+ episodes, I doubt there was even _one_ in which -- by accident or design -- everything came together to form a truly memorable program.

Perhaps the best thing about  ""Howdy Doody"" was the terrific puppets. The designs were original and well-executed -- who can forget Dilly Dally, Phineas T. Bluster, or the Flub-a-Dub? Their handling was excellent, with a minimum of spastic jerking.

This ridiculously inexpensive set collects 40 half-hour episodes on four disks, complete with embarrassingly obnoxious commercials delivered by the cast members. * The fifth disk includes the 5th- & 8th-anniversary shows, as well as the final 1960 episode, and several entertaining interviews that answer most of (but not all) the questions one might have about the show. There's a booklet of photographs, most of which also appear on the supplemental disk. The packaging and presentation (other than use of cutout slots for the disks) are first-rate, even if the set cost twice as much.

The anniversary shows are particularly interesting. The 5th has Fred Allen (!!!) as a member of the Peanut Gallery. Though his humor goes right over the kids' heads, he brings a bit of wit the show lacks. And the 8th, with Gabby Hayes appearing briefly, throws into sharp relief just how lacking the regular cast members were in acting ability or simple stage presence. Gabby outclasses them all. (I admit to a great fondness for Mr. Hayes.)

Another reviewer's claim that the final episode is dubbed from a VHS source is absurd. It is clearly a professional videotape recording from the '60s.

Should you buy? The fifth disk alone is worth Amazon's $13 asking price, so the decision is a no-brainer. As for whether you'll enjoy the other four disks... it depends on whether you can switch off an adult's sophistication, and experience ""Howdy Doody"" as it was intended -- a diversion for children in a more-nave and less-complex world.

A final observation... As I write this, none of the other Amazon reviewers has commented on the cover art. It portrays a narrower-faced Howdy, with his child-like navete replaced with I can only describe as vapid stupidity. I suspect the change was intentional.

* The problem isn't the commercials so much (you can't expect a for-profit business such as RCA to put on more than a small amount of unsponsored programming), but rather that the performers delivered most of the ads, the child's liking for Buffalo Bob or Howdy Doody or or Clarabell being transferred to the product. This is no longer acceptable.",1228348800,,3588,4.963333333333333
