8313396,2,B001JP64FU,"This film could be a ""so bad it is good"" film. It takes a log time to develop. The part I liked best was Gilbert Roland talking to the audience with a drink in his hand. I was ready to hear him say, ""Stay thirsty my friends."" A group of people look in Mexico for the Tayopa treasure left behind by padre miners killed in 1646 in Arizona according to the narration. Kathryn (Rena Winters) leads a small group of men who are ready to strap 17 tons of treasure to their backs and walk out. A crazy man named Sally (Phil Trapani) has his eye on Kathryn. There is also a snake curse.

It takes 50 minutes to get to Tayopa. There is a lot of dialogue and narration. The action was minimal. Kathryn gets naked and we get to see underwater blurred nudity. They do use metal detectors to look for the treasure. Is there a metal detector that works with the detector held at waist level? No reason. Just asking.

Guide: No swearing, sex. Near nudity. Some unintended camp value.",1487894400,,968,4.284153005464481

8313398,3,B001JP64FU,"This takes bad movies to a new low. I only gave it 3 stars because I like bad movies and, believe me, this ranks at the bottom of the barrel. Bad acting, implausible story, and poor production values make this one of the worst movies ever made.",1364515200,,244,4.212765957446808
8313399,2,B001JP64FU,"Well, where is the beef?  Everybody wants the boss and she says no.  Some are hard to convince.  Lust and gold always go together.  Get a job people lol!!! No really good guys and bad guys it is hard to tell which is which.  Worth watching if you have a few extra minutes.  I would save it for a rainy day because it looks very hot where they are. Now get out there and do it lol!",1364342400,,380,3.8701298701298703
8313400,3,B001JP64FU,"I was expecting more gold than what was shown,
It's old time western. Acting was okay
Not sure what year it took place in.",1358121600,,122,4.125
8313401,5,B001JP64FU,"This film features Rena Winters an outstanding relatively unknown actress. She does a tremendous job enduring the hardships of remote Mexico as well as vicious male cohorts.  It's a tour de force for the young actress.  Tremendous scenery and violent action takes place throughout the film. There's a beautiful nude scene.  Well worth your time, especially if you like action adventure films. It is truly considered a classic of its era.",1299974400,3,437,5.126760563380282
8313402,5,B001JP64FU,"""The Treasure of Tayopa"" is a classic! Share the adventure and suspense in the Mexican badlands as this unlikely group sets out in search of the lost treasure...The Treasure of Tayopa.
Despite the simple and predictable script/plot, it is an enjoyable film.

The handsome, silver haired actor, Bob Corrigan, is himself a treasure. mmm mmm With his natural acting ability and good looks, it can be difficult to concentrate on the plot. When the going gets tough, Bob's character remains composed and rational, holding the group together...for a while.
Fans of the old ""Mystery Science Theatre"" will find it simply charming..
So, pop the corn, sit back, and treat yourself to ""The Treasure of Tayopa.""",1238630400,3,699,5.078260869565217
