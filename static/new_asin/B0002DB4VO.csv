Acapulco a go-go (1967)
Sort of a Mexi-version of AIP's 1960s beach movies, lots of goofy humor, nightclub scene, jet-set vacationers, sunbathing, go-go dancing, cigarette smoking, booze drinking, complete with beatnik artist, love interest sub-plots, a dash of drama, fantastic 60s hairstyles, apparel, home decor, automobiles and the mod scene.
Best part is very cool set of Spanish cover songs of hits from the 60s like:
""Gloria"" by THEM, ""Spanish Flea"" by Herb Alpert, ""Treat Her Right""  by Roy Head, ""Hang on Sloopy"" by The McCoys, and the best one ""Woolly Bully"" by Sam the Sham and The Pharaohs.
It's mostly in Spanish with a few lines in English here and there.
The only thing missing was English subtitles for film fans like myself.",1387411200,,787,5.00763358778626
8445743,4,B0002DB4VO,"If Spanish is your first language, or if you are bilingual, this is a MUST see movie. Unfortunately there are no subtitles for nonspanish speaking viewers. Set in the 70's its a period piece with lots of twists and nonstop laughs. I laughed so hard I cried and my sides hurt. A lot of fun in this gem of a flick",1316131200,,311,4.114754098360656
