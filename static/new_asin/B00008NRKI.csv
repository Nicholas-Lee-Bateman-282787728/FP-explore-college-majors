7985852,5,B00008NRKI,"You can't beat this dvd when starting out on the guitar.  Anyone looking to start out on guitar will have no problem getting going right away on the material featured in this dvd.  Walking you through everything from strings and notes, to positioning your hands and the guitar, tuning and plenty more to get you up and playing within the first view.  Highly recommended for anyone who hasn't started playing yet and would like too.  The material is simple and easy to pick up on while still giving you the foundation you need to gain an understanding of the instrument.",1145836800,2,569,4.66
7985853,5,B00008NRKI,"This complete guide to the basics teaches: songs, chords and riffs; picking and strumming patterns; and helpful playing tips and techniques, and includes standard notation AND TAB. It's great for learning at your own pace. I would also recommend purchasing the Level 1 book/CD that is available.

Very happy with this product and will use it again for other instruments that I have been wanting to learn!",1145577600,2,404,5.029850746268656
7985854,1,B00008NRKI,"I learned pretty much nothing from this DVD.  He walks you through where the notes are on each of the 6 strings up through the 3rd fret.  Then he plays several songs using these notes, which are included in a little booklet that comes with it (which only contains the songs and not where the notes are, so it can't really even be used as a reference in case you forget), but its all in standard musical notation - no guitar tabs.  Goes pretty fast and there is no real instruction other than watching him play the song or the notes.  Since there is no guitar tablature, you spend more time just trying to read the sheet music than learning anything.  You could probably find 100 free websites that will give you the same information.

This is 90% of the content.  Then at the end of the DVD there are a couple chapters on chords, but its the same thing.  He shows you the chord then plays some songs with them and you watch him.  Then you play it yourself on your own using the booklet.  Practically no instruction at all, no tips on how to quickly transition from one chord to another, he just blazes through the songs and there is no indication of what chord he is even playing at any given time without trying to analyze where his fingers are.

So basically, if you can find all the notes on the first 3 frets (plenty of websites can give you that), find the fingerings for the most basic chords (plenty of websites for that too), and find some simple sample guitar tabs to use for those notes/chords (plenty of websites for that as well), you have more information already than this DVD will give you.",1138233600,11,1605,4.352348993288591
