3479413,3,B001B1Q2TK,"I find that the best time to use this is an evening workout. Good to relax my legs. But I wouldn't want anyone to purchase it as a core workout. While your core is an integral part of just about any workout, I probably wouldn't have bought this one if I knew that it wasn't ""core centric"".",1223683200,6,289,4.087719298245614
3479414,3,B001B1Q2TK,"Meh. I did the workout this morning, starting with the bonus track from Fluid power, followed by the lower body flow and the abdominal section. The lower body flow had about four things that were new and new is good, but they weren't very exciting: leaning forward in yogic squat, drawing arms back behind you then forward, reaching in front of you. OK, that was new.
If you are new to Shiva Rea, I think you would be lost during the very brief ""do your own flow"" piece at the end of the lower body section. The warrior II to reverse warrior to side angle is really no different than the sequence in the long standing pose flow on Fluid Power. Just Shiva's outfit and the Kauaii backdrop are new.
The ab section, if you already have a strong core, is OK. I like the rocking bridge flow, but that, to me, is the best part of the whole DVD: 1-2 minutes. I could do the rocking bridge flow for probably 10 minutes before I even felt it.  The abdominal section just ends as if they ran out of money, time or attention span and you are just dumped into Shavasana, which is only 2 minutes.
I own all of Shiva's CDs/""audiobooks"", Creative Core Abs 1, Fluid Power, Yoga Shakti and Yoga Trance Dance. I feel that this production is nowhere near as well done as any of the other products of hers I own and use. I will be incorporating a couple of the abdominal moves into a much longer abdominal sequence I do on my own, but I have to say, I'm disappointed.",1222041600,21,1447,4.261818181818182
3479415,5,B001B1Q2TK,"I didn't know what to expect from this DVD until I actually got out on the mat and began to follow the practice.  It's a challenging practice
that will build your core - not by doing ab work but by flowing in a graceful practice.

Although Shiva guides you through the practice, she encourages you to
tap into your own flow and add your own movements to the program.

The time flew by and I can't wait to do it again.

This is a great workout for someone who only has a limited amount of time
but wants to move into the flow.

If you are a fan of Shiva Rea, you'll enjoy this work.

If you are not yet a fan of Shiva, this DVD compliments her Core Abs and Fluid Power.

I rated this DVD five stars.  You may want to give it more.

Namaste and enjoy it!

PS. My goal is to join Shiva on a retreat in the near future.  If you aren't on her list, sign up at [...] You'll get her monthly newsletter called Pulse.",1221523200,3,908,3.9613259668508287
3479416,5,B001B1Q2TK,"This workout is short (22 minutes without shavasana) but it really packs a punch in this short time , in ""Creative Roots"" she starts with yogic squat and wide angle stretch which she'll repeat throughout this 13 minute segment with different variations , there are also hero 2 poses and side angle poses with a lot of fluid transitions between them and because most of the time you are in those positions it is really challenging for the lower body, she even demonstrates a transition from side angle to an advanced one arm balancing pose , but you don't have to do it if you can't. She finishes with a quadriceps stretch in cat position (kneeling bow). The second segment ""Creative Core"" is 9 minutes and is a lot of fun , you'll start on your back doing fluid bridge pose  then a single legged bridge with a fun rocking move ,you can see a clip of it on youtube. Then she move into half table pose and flow right into side plank and from there to forearm plank and then into a straight arm plank and she repeats those plank pushups a few times and does this whole series of planks on the other side. It ends with a short shavasana. The scenery is of course gorgeous as in all of her DVD's. There is also a bonus segment from Fluid Power ""Foundation Vinyasa"" that can be used as a great warm up. This is another great addition my Shiva Rea DVD collection can't wait for ""Surf Yoga Soul"" , her next DVD , to be out .",1221264000,20,1416,4.263940520446097

3479418,5,B001B1Q2TK,Powerful class set in beautiful location. Shiva presents yoga with a lot of gentleness and power combined. Strong class for whole body.,1385856000,,135,5.181818181818182
3479419,4,B001B1Q2TK,"I bought a few of the Shiva Rea DVDs because I wanted to try yoga at home before facing a class full of experts.  I will say that this DVD was definitely challenging physically, despite the fact that I am training for a triathlon.  I felt like I could do all of the moves (not in great form) but I couldn't keep up with the pace of the transitions at times.  Otherwise, this is a great DVD.  There was a bonus section specifically for building up abs and core strength.",1379548800,3,469,4.177777777777778
3479420,4,B001B1Q2TK,"I was hoping I could do it, but it is too hard for me.  I need something that is going to make me more flexible first.",1373760000,,118,3.5384615384615383
3479421,2,B001B1Q2TK,"I was expecting more of a strength training routine. This is basically just holding yoga poses like Warrior 1 and 2, and stationary squats. Not satisfying if you are looking to get an actual hardcore strength training workout.",1369612800,,226,4.973684210526316
3479422,5,B001B1Q2TK,"this is the first time I tried yoga and it's pretty easy to follow, and you really feel the burn afterwards",1356134400,,107,4.142857142857143
3479423,3,B001B1Q2TK,"Though short (22 min.), this DVD leaves you feeling energized and inspired.

""Creative Core + Lower Body"" has the same high-quality production and amazing scenery that we've come to expect from Shiva Rea.  The instruction is good, but like any of Rea's DVDs, you'll probably need to watch the sequence a few times before you really get the postures and transitions.  This is not a bad thing- Rea demonstrates excellent form and a beautiful quality of movement, and is a delight to watch.  The music is sitar Indian-style music seen in so many yoga classes, and quickly fades to the background.

The pace of this DVD is a bit slower than other Shiva Rea DVDs, and even a beginner could catch on quickly.  It helps that the first sequence is based on squats, where you can easily watch and follow along.  The postures are not terribly challenging, but allow you to do your squat and plank exercises without it feeling like a chore!

My favorite aspect of ""Creative Core + Lower Body"" is when Shiva Rea starts to explore where you can go from the postures on the DVD.  She encourages the viewer to flow from one posture through a variety of movements and other postures within their yoga repertoire.  I have never seen this in a yoga class, and found myself energized and inspired to continue exploring yoga and movement even after the DVD was finished.  For me, that is the sign of a good yoga class, and since this DVd is offered for such cheap prices, I would recommend adding it to your collection.",1328313600,2,1499,4.597744360902255
3479424,2,B001B1Q2TK,"This is a very short work out. It didn't occur to me to check how long this dvd was, but 22 minutes seem awfully short to me. It seemed like a mixture of yoga and dance. I didn't like it at all. My knees hurt after trying. I felt kind of silly following her moves, because she seemed to be improvising as recording. Very silly, very disappointed. Not what I expected.",1319760000,,367,4.183098591549296
3479425,4,B001B1Q2TK,"Shiva is fun, and I love that I can mix and match the workouts. I love the combo of abs and lower body. this is not a boring workout! I definitly felt it working too.",1291507200,,166,3.7714285714285714
3479426,3,B001B1Q2TK,"I am relatively new to the yoga world, and found this short workout a little challenging. My knees hurt after attempting this workout the first couple of times. It is okay, but I'm not 'in love' with the flow of the workout so far. I would enjoy some background music that is a little more upbeat...to keep me going and my energy up a bit during the poses.",1276041600,2,356,4.25

3479428,4,B001B1Q2TK,"I use this together with the Upper Body + Core one.  Honestly, if you have her Shakti DVD, you don't need another one.  But since I love Shiva, so I decided to get it.  Don't bother with the ""Core Abs"" one, as you can get the same exercises from these two.  I'm not very experienced at yoga, so I can't do much in Shakti, this one provides a nice alternative to prevent from getting bored.  Although, quite some poses in this one I can't do either... >_< but hopefully one day I will be able to...",1270944000,4,497,4.135416666666667
3479429,5,B001B1Q2TK,"I had heard a lot about Shiva Rea, so wanted to try her DVD's.  After trying them i have concluded, its  a must have collection.  I like the way she takes you through each poses.  You will enjoy every bit during your workout.",1260230400,,225,4.162790697674419
3479430,5,B001B1Q2TK,"I absolutlely love this DVD for days when I don't have a lot of time.  I usually do the bonus footage first as a warm-up then do the remainder of the DVD which makes for a total time of approximately 34 minutes.  Even though the practice is short, afterwards I feel centered, calm and strong.  The lower body portion is a refreshing change from typically vinyasas that usually use chaturanga to up dog, to down dog as home base.  Instead the yoga squat position is your home base as you flow between sides doing standing poses eventually creating your own flow based upon how you are feeling that day.  I also like the abdominal section.  very creative!

*** Edited to add:  I have been using this DVD once or twice a month for some time now and this DVD practice continues to grow on me.  As mentioned above, use the bonus footage as a warm-up before beginning the standing pose flow.  The standing pose flow has some deep hip bending and stretching (side warrior, deep squats, long holding of poses).  I wanted to address the issue of the core workout.  I noticed that several people didn't care for the core work.  I absolutely love the core work here.  I enjoy starting with breathing bridge and one legged bridges because at that point in the practice after the standing poses my body is really craving some backbending.  I also enjoy that it is very different core work from her other DVDs.  You do some planks on hands and then move to your elbows and back to your hands a couple of times.  You also do side plank.

My only complaint about the DVD is that I could use a couple more moments to slow down before going into savasana.  I have to stop the DVD and do my own savasana.  I can still feel my blood pumping strong in my veins if I follow the dvd into savasana.  Also, the savasana is short and when over goes back to the dvd menu which has music.  I just shut it down after core work and do my own savasana for as long as I like!",1255046400,5,1943,4.294765840220386
3479431,4,B001B1Q2TK,"I own all three of Shiva's core workouts and they pack quite the punch into just over 20 minutes! I usually combine her core dvd's with various other yoga dvd's or after I am done running. They aren't enough to do just by themselves, but I don't think they were meant to be. I usually combine this DVD with a Power Yoga (Power Yoga by Bryan Kest is my favorite) or with any other strong upper body set of yoga. As like all of her other DVD's, the background is simply breathtaking and gorgeous, it's enough to just watch that by itself! The music is always good. It does have a lot of the same moves as the other two core DVD's so if you're looking to save a little money, maybe just get the Creative Core DVD.",1254960000,3,710,4.1521739130434785
3479432,4,B001B1Q2TK,I found this very hard for the first 4-5 attempts but I stayed with it and it became more manageable.  Has been helpful with back problems.  Only 2 routines for about 22 minutes or so.  Would like to have had more variety but still useful.,1252108800,,239,4.266666666666667
3479433,1,B001B1Q2TK,This DVD is a disappointment because it was very short. Shiva goes through standing poses then does an abdominal core seguence. The standing sequence just was not long enough. There should have been warm up exercises and more lower body exercises for that segment. Also the core seguence needs more exercises. I feel like I got robbed for my money. This DVD was a waste of my yoga practice time. I want my money back.,1243296000,,417,4.573333333333333
3479434,5,B001B1Q2TK,"My first Shiva dvd was Yoga Shakti, her more purist yoga effort. It is one of my favorite yoga dvds of all time. It stands out as unique in the overcrowded vinyasa dvd market. It is also in my opinion the best produced, most beautiful yoga dvd ever. My next was Creative Core Abs which I did not fancy. I thought it was fresh and well produced, but it just wasn't my style. I hesistated with the Creative Core Lower and Upper Body dvds because I did not something similar to Creative Core Abs. I was prompted by the reviews to take a chance on them and I am so glad I got them. I did both the lower and upper body today and found them fascinating including the core sections. This is real yoga and yet it is truly creative. I see the influence of classical Indian dance in the way Shiva ""flows"" from pose to pose - especially in her arm / hand movements. The choreography of the vinyasa on the lower body video and the core section is truly beautiful without straying too far from classic yoga asana which I thought happned with Creative Core Abs. As a workout, Lower Body is enjoyable and manages to build quite a burn in the quads and hamstrings. My only minor quibble is that I wish the yogic squats section had been a bit longer. Thank you amazon reviewers, especially Yoni.",1236988800,14,1278,4.3070539419087135
3479435,5,B001B1Q2TK,"For the reviewer that didn't feel this in their core, I'd love to know what DVD they were following!  If poses were done correctly, in proper alignment, this is a great core workout.  No, you won't find ""crunches"" in this workout, but for people familiar with Shiva's style, crunches are way too boring.

And how about those glutes?!  I was totally ""feeling it"" the next day!  The repetition did not bother me, as I knew I was going into a Core/Lower Body workout, rather than a typical vinyasa.  With that being said, even though this was not a vinyasa, she still brought her signature ""flow"" style to the workout.  Poses were transitioned beautifully and with strength and grace.

As is typical of all of her DVD's the setting was stunning, and the quality was high.  Well done Shiva!  I can't wait for the ""Upper Body"" version to come out in 2009.

Oh - and so you're not surprised - it's a short DVD (around 20 minutes), but don't worry - you'll feel it.  I find it nice when I don't have a ton of time, or a perfect primer to another yoga practice.",1228003200,7,1053,4.398963730569948
3479436,4,B001B1Q2TK,"I like most of the Shiva Rea DVD's I've tried. This one is a bit different from the rest, but short and perfect for when you only have a few minutes to do yoga.

I enjoyed it. It wasn't too hard, but challenging enough that I'll have to do it for a while to get the hang of some of the movements. The garden where it's filmed and Shiva are both absolutely beautiful, and it's enjoyable just to watch.

I didn't like it as well as the first creative core, but still think it will be a valuable addition to my yoga DVD collection.",1227225600,3,528,4.0673076923076925
