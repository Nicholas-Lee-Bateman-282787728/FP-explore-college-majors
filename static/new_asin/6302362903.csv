7825023,5,6302362903,"One of the loveliest television fictional productions, which seems so long lost. Nice to have found it, and sad to think how many will not be seeing it, as I do not see that it ever has been re-run or reproduced.",1498953600,,212,4.195121951219512
7825024,5,6302362903,This is an excellent movie taken from a book by Harriett Doerr and a lovely story about an American couple who move there.  I lived in Mexico for a year during the 1950s and this book brought back fond memories of the people I met there so long ago.,1362355200,,249,4.081632653061225
7825025,1,6302362903,I just did not bother with the return process but the copy I was sent did not track. Was one of those cassettes where the entire movie is on a half inch of tape. Will wait for the DVD to become available.,1342742400,,204,3.880952380952381
7825026,5,6302362903,"Ah well, I'm not the only one who wonders why trash, insignificant and superficial Hollywood box-office hits are being released and beautiful movies are unnoticed for re-release.

I'm glad I have taped this gem when it was on TV ages back.

Far from a tearjerker, but Oh man, where's my kleenex?",1135555200,3,295,4.764705882352941
7825027,5,6302362903,"I do wonder why some great movies like this and other greats like ""Madame Sousatzka"" and ""The Good Earth"" are not being released on DVD while some inferior movies are being released like locusts in an attack run.
If the studio is worried about not having enough people to purchase the product, release it in limited quantity! I am sure those who treasure good movies like me wouldn't mind forking a few additional bucks to acquire it. As for me, being in Malaysia and with the weak local currency, I am more than willing to tightened my belt in order to save to buy it. Afterall, really good movies are hard to come by and it's worth every gastritis pain for it.
I do hope that whoever from the responsible studio which owns this movie is reading this would consider it to be released on DVD soon.",1067990400,5,797,4.428571428571429
7825028,5,6302362903,The is a beautifully acted and directed drama and should be accessible for everyone to see again and again.  Is there anyway we can put more pressure on the studio to re-release it?  I've been waiting for years.,949017600,5,211,4.526315789473684
