756738,4,6304022166,"Even though this is probably not the highest quality production of the Tom Sawyer story ever made, it is my favourite version, because the two boys are at the ages I always imagined them as being. Jonathan Taylor Thomas really does do a good job as Tom, and I really like that the movie shows the way he kind of hero-worships Huck, and sort of wants to be him. Speaking of whom, I know y'all out there reading, will never take me seriously after this, but....I never knew Huck Finn was so cute! Best Huck Finn I ever saw (see? I said you'd not take me seriously!). Really, though, Brad Renfro makes a great Huckleberry Finn. It's interesting, the way the character seems even younger than Tom, in some ways.
 The other characters were really good, too. Little Sid is marvelously fun to despise, and Muff Potter is actually rather endearing. The lady cast as Aunt Polly did a great job portraying  the careworn, but once-pretty woman I never knew Aunt Polly was.
 While not exactly matching the book's description, Rachael Leigh Cook makes a great Becky Thatcher. I really like the fact that, while she can be quite spunky, and at times, responds the way a boy might, she is by no means a misfit. She's plainly a girl who has no problem with being one, and engages in girlish activities with as much enthusiasm as any of her friends.
 I was delighted with the actor who played Injun Joe, Eric Schweig. He looked perfect for  the part, and really brought the character to life. He didn't play Injun Joe as a complicated villain whose point of view one can see from. But, neither did he play a one-dimensional bad guy who's bad because he's a bad guy. What you see in the movie, is someone who is unquestionable a bad guy, but is still plainly human. He's *interesting*.
 It's been a while since I read it, but Tom & Huck is a fairly accurate adaptation of the book into a movie, with all the characters brought to life so well. And, it's a lot of fun to watch.",1077062400,4,1958,4.425
756739,5,6304022166,"The story of Tom Sawyer in the book was brought out in the film. The story was great. But the actors were not right. Brad Renfro was much better in other films. And JTT wasn't the best actor for the part. Don't get me wrong, the movie was still great, but it could have been better.",1057104000,2,282,4.053571428571429
756740,5,6304022166,This movie was wonderful! Jonathan Taylor Thomas is the right person for Tom Sawyer. Brad Renfro is an awesome Huck Finn. I could watch this movie five times a day!!,1040428800,,165,4.533333333333333
756741,3,6304022166,"I thoroughly enjoyed this adaptation of 'Tom Sawyer' and so did my Year 9 class (13 yr olds). After reading the novel I, initially, showed my class the musical version. Well...they were beside themselves...not a MUSICAL!! They HATED it and thought Tom was a bit of a ""dick"".
One of the kids recommended this version and so I showed it to them. They LOVED it!! They thought Tom and Huck were great and that Becky was a ""babe"".
Some of the details were different from the novel but the essence of the story was there. My favourite scene was there -  the infamous 'whitewashing' incident and it was just as funny as it was in the book.",1008460800,4,632,4.401709401709402
756742,1,6304022166,"I knew I was not going to enjoy this movie, even before I watched it.  But, I had to prove myself right.  So, I went to the movie theater and sat through this horrible mess, this Disney monstrosity, and did my best to choke back the bile building up in my throat.  Most of ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" is cut from ""Tom and Huck""; and the most irritating aspect of all is the many scenes, the majority of which, that have been completely invented.  Take for instance the opening scene where Dr. Robinson meets with Injun Joe.  Why did Disney seek to open up ""Tom and Huck"" with Injun Joe, and not Tom Sawyer?  And parents with small children - beware of the obscenity contained within.  It is uttered by Injun Joe, and is so disturbing to hear uttered not merely in a Disney movie, but in a work of Mark Twain.  In fact, had Twain put that word in ""Tom Sawyer"", and his wife, Livy, had seen it, she surely would have scolded him with everything she had.  There are so many flaws contacted within ""Tom and Huck"", it would take more than a thousand words to explain them all.  Only realize this, if you do view ""Tom and Huck"", it is not ""The Adventures of Tom Sawyer"" you are watching.  Johnathon Taylor Thomas is a waste in this film, and the only reason he was cast was due to his  ""popularity"" at the time.  This movie just goes to show how low Disney has sunk over the past decade or so; and the depths they are willing to go in order to make money.  I cannot recommend this movie to anyone - especially Tom Sawyer fans like myself.  One of these days, someone has got to produce a quality version of Tom Sawyer, even if I have to do it myself.  Once again, too bad we cannot give a movie zero stars, because that is what ""Tom and Huck"" is worth, if not less.",990489600,10,1762,4.183976261127596
756743,4,6304022166,"When I watch a Tom Sawyer movie, or a Huck Finn movie, I'm wanting to have fun, that's all. That's why I love 'em. Maybe from Huck I expect some touching moments, but throw Tom in and I expect 99% fun. That's why I love the movies so much more than the books! This movie is easy to play off as a film targeted at Jr. High girls, with the hopes that boys will come for the adventure angle. Well, it probably didn't work out because girls just don't seem interested in the characters of Tom and Huck, no matter who the actors are, and sadly, boys nowadays just don't care about the classic characters of Tom and Huck either. I guess there just aren't enough guns and aliens. I think only the really loyal JTT and Renfro fans went to see this, and a few guys like me, who just find Tom and Huck movies so much fun! Oh, and of course Rachael Leigh Cooke is in it! On that note, I'll say, this movie was very successful! I found it quite fun! JTT doesn't seem to have had the staying power as a heartthrob now that he's grown, but to say he was miscast was all wrong. He was great. I though maybe Renfro looked a bit too old for Huck, but I think that's because I LOVE the Elijah Wood version of Huck Finn, and he was pretty darn young in that. By the way, for the best version of Huck I've seen so far, get the Elijah Wood one, I've nearly worn mine out. If you're looking for a version true to the books, forget it. They're too controversial and frankly, have some really long boring parts, therefore I doubt a movie that's true to the books will ever be made. Anyway, as for this version, sure, it's a little obvious it's targeted at young kids, but actually, it will probably be more enjoyable for those who just like fun Tom Sawyer stories. Oh, here are two things to check out. One, the wonderful music! (Also check out the REALLY Wonderful music in the Elijah Wood film) And two, for a good laugh, pay attention to the scene where Tom and Becky have gotten lost in the cave, and Judge Thatcher gets everyone together to search for them. Here's the hilarious part, for the benefit of the expected all kid audience, Judge Thatcher basically explains the whole plot of the film up to that point, so they know exactly what is going on, who's chasing Tom and Becky, and why. It really is hilarious, but believe me, it doesn't detract to the enjoyment of the movie, only adds to it! Okay, well, that's all I'll say about it, except to add that I actually bought the soundtrack in addition to the video. Now I'm off to get a copy of The Adventures of Tom Sawyer, an animated version where Tom is a cat and Huck is a fox, etc... I believe it's fairly new, from MGM, and I hear GREAT things about it. Read the reviews here on Amazon. I'll post mine after I've seen it.",981676800,12,2761,4.211320754716981
756744,4,6304022166,"Not a bad film, but it could have been better.  I agree with the viewer  from New York; JTT was the wrong person to play Tom Sawyer.  And Brad  Renfro's talent was completely wasted in this movie---he was far, far  better in ""The Cure"".",968544000,,236,4.2727272727272725

757662,2,6304022166,"This film, while attempting to add subtle nods to its literary ancestor when possible, veers too far away from its source to maintain the nostalgic charm that has captivated so many generations of readers.

It's inexcusable to eliminate the role of Twain's narration, especially given the amount of sudden shifts in setting, tone, and mood of the film. It's disconcerting. The best thing about TAoTS is Sawyer himself, as fleshed out by Twain's explanation. He is reduced, here, to a piece of driftwood on the mighty Mississippi... Flowing down along with the story, but unable to really affect it.

757740,5,6304022166,"A superior adaptation of Samuel Clemens' THE ADVENTURES OF TOM SAWYER, TOM AND HUCK benefits considerably from the charismatic lead performance of Jonathan Taylor Thomas as a mischievous, but loyal, Tom Sawyer. Add rollicking supportive music, suspenseful editing, and exceptional sound recording and the result is a delightful production well suited to teen and adult viewers. While the language occasionally slides into vulgarities, the spirit of Clemens is communicated intact. Highly recommended as a very successful translation of the text into visual images.",1424131200,,564,5.807228915662651

758405,3,6304022166,"Tom Sawyer (Jonathan Taylor Thomas) is being best friends with fellow orphan Huckleberry Finn (Brad Renfro).  Against his Aunt Polly's (Amy Wright) wishes, Tom spends every moment he can with Huck.

And that leads to trouble.  When they sneak into a cemetery late one night, they witness Injun Joe (Eric Schweig) kill Doc Robinson (William Newman) and frame drunk Muff Potter (Michael McShane) for it.  Knowing that Injun Joe will come after them if they squeal, they take a vow of silence.

There is plenty of fun around town, especially when pretty new girl Becky Thatcher (Rachael Leigh Cook) is around.  But Tom can't get the murder out of his mind, especially when Muff goes to trial.  Will he do the right thing?

It's funny that this movie is called Tom and Huck since it is obviously based on Twain's Tom Sawyer and just as obviously created as a star vehicle for Jonathan Taylor Thomas during the height of his popularity.  They try to clean up his character, which is a shame because he would have been brilliant as the quick thinking, trouble causing Tom of the book.  Instead, here he is more Huck's follower, and there seems a bit of hero worship to their relationship, with Huck being too cool for the younger Tom.

This movie does include many of the famous scenes from the novel.  And there is plenty of fun along the way.  The funniest scene is the scene in the church.  The novel still pulls it off best, but this one comes close.

But this movie is also scarier than many takes on the story.  Injun Joe is down right creepy, and there are several scenes that might scare the younger members of the viewing audience.

Despite the fun, I just can't get over how they've changed the characters.  This isn't a bad version of the Twain classic, but it isn't good either.",1214956800,2,1784,4.574132492113565
758406,2,6304022166,"Any fan of Mark Twain's writing will be appalled at what this particular Disney version has done to it.  This one takes liberties with the classic characters never before dared.  A perfect example of the complete disregard for Twain's authentic sense of time and place is the laughable fact that neither Tom or Huck ever once are seen barefoot, an absolute hallmark of the characters!  The old David O. Selznick production is far superior!",1207267200,,439,4.905405405405405
758407,5,6304022166,"I love Jonathan Taylor Thomas, so naturally I decided to check out some of his earlier movies. And I'm fairly glad I did. Tom and Huck is an innocent classic tribute to...well...innocence. A lot of the movies you see today are graphic and violent and sexual. Things that are PG rated today would have been R rated back in the sixties. My friend says that's because we've 'evolved.' I think that's a load of crap. If evolving means watching things I should, then I'd rather be stuck in the stone age.

But enough of my ranting. Your kids will thank you for buying them this movie. I'm thirteen years old and I loved it. Just short enough to keep your kids attention.",1193097600,,665,4.450819672131147

758409,4,6304022166,"I liked Jonathan Taylor Thomas. He did a good job playing Tom, even though he didn't match up with the ""real Tom."" Brad Refro was good even though I didn't picture Huck Finn like that. Becky was terrible! I have love the book and this actor and script doesn't even come close! They did a good job with Injun Joe. I don't think you can make  a video as good as the book but, one day I hope they will.",1169769600,,399,3.9875
758410,4,6304022166,"I am unsure of how many versions of ""Tom Sawyer"" that I have seen, regardless, nearly every one had its charms as does this version.  While this version plays more as a vehicle for Jonathon Taylor Thomas and Brad Renfro, the story still plays out much like Mark Twain's original.

This movie launches very quickly into the murder of Doc Robinson (William Newman) by Injun Joe (Eric Schweig).  Injun Joe has pinned the blame on poor Muff Potter (Michael McShane) by using his knife.  We know, however, that Tom Sawyer (Thomas) and Huckleberry Finn (Brad Renfro) were watching.  We also know that Huck has made a pact with Tom to never tell anyone about what they saw.  However, Tom is conflicted because he genuinely likes Muff Potter, and somehow he feels that he can not leave him to take the blame for Injun Joe's crime.

While I do not wish to make light of this movie, we know the general story.  Injun Joe threatens Tom and tells Tom that he will kill him if he tells what he knows.  Of course, Tom ultimately does tell, but Injun Joe escapes the courthouse, and Tom will be in fear of Injun Joe until he is caught or killed.  Eventually the movie ends up in Mark Twain Cave (at least, that was the original setting), where Becky Thatcher (the gloriously beautiful Rachael Lee Cook), Tom Sawyer and Huck Finn have it out with Injun Joe.

This movie retains a reasonable amount of Twain's original story.  However, because the movie barely clocks in with 97 minutes, the story is substantially shortened with little of the significant detail that Twain put into his book.  There is a reasonable amount of humor in the movie to take the edge off the drama, with the famous church scene being one of the best scenes until after Tom was discovered, when the scene began to go downhill.  The famous fence whitewashing scene is relatively weak in this movie.

This movie seems to be a showcase for then popular Disney star Jonathan Taylor Thomas.  Unfortunately for Thomas, Muff Potter, Injun Joe, Huck Finn and Becky Thatcher all steal the show.  Tom, who was the leader and the schemer in the original Twain story, seems to be half a step behind throughout much of the movie.  Apparently someone in Disney thought that Thomas would be more appealing as a more nave child; whoever came up with that idea was wrong.

This movie is a bit too violent for younger children.  I would recommend age 6 or 7 as the lower limit, and even some older children may find some of the violence distressing.

My biggest disappointment with this movie was the portrayal of the cave.  Mark Twain Cave in Hannibal, Missouri was formed by water, and is substantially shale and clay.  In some areas of the cave, water still flows at lower level  Some versions of this movie do a great job of portraying the cave; this movie does not.  I recommend visiting the original in Hannibal, Missouri.

A purist will undoubtedly find this movie to be disappointing.  However, perhaps a child watching this movie will be sufficiently intrigued that they will pick up Mark Twain's book and discover the wonderful world that Mark Twain created.",1131840000,14,3110,4.648351648351649
