8327837,3,B001NRY6OK,"People on a certain red-envelope service gave this low reviews.  I disagree with them.  This was made by a news station almost 25 years ago.  It's not going to have the production values of a PBS or Discovery Channel.  Also, know that the age of the work is what allowed so many actual Black aviators or their relatives to be interviewed here.

This work is about the first Black American pilots.  I purposely don't use the term African-American because that term picked up currency in the early 1990s and this doc was made in the mid-1980s.  What stands out is that Black individuals could tell that planes were going to be ""the next big thing,"" so some of them did all they could to learn to fly, and teach other Blacks to do the same.  But in a vastly segregated time, they faced barriers toward reaching this goal.

The work interviews Black men and women.  It first speaks about Bessie Coleman, a Black woman pioneer, similar to Amelia Earhart.  There are a few anti-racist ally whites interviewed here too.

This doc made me think seriously about how much times have changed.  In the same way that brave people have died trying to travel in space, noted individuals here died in the air.  However, NASA has tried to have diverse astronauts, unlike the bigotry these flyers faced.  The US Postal Service now has a Bessie Coleman stamp.  This work doesn't even bring up the Tuskegee Airmen until the last ten minutes, so the work is trying to emphasize that there were Black adventurers before those wonderful veterans.

While the work starts in Los Angeles (as I think the doc was made there), it says a lot about Chicago and I just love any work that points to Chicago's importance to Black America.  This work made me think about the first Blacks to embrace the Internet, the green movement, or veganism.  It reminds me of how, throughout history, Blacks have said, ""Hey, that looks significant!  Let's make sure our people are involved too!""",1270252800,3,1949,4.659824046920821
