8675257,4,B00MXC6A8E,"This was the first PWG event I had ever watched. Overall I loved it. Although I have never watched an Indy wrestling event I knew most of the wrestlers from other companies. It was a little sloppier than most of the shows I watch, but the atmosphere and talent of the wrestlers is incredible. It was well worth the money. I consider it a must buy, especially because of the WCTT vs Young Bucks match.",1422748800,,400,4.346666666666667
8675258,4,B00MXC6A8E,"Now for those who don't already know, Pro Wrestling Guerrera (P.W.G.) is a promotion based out of southern California who holds events monthly/bi-monthly that feature local independent wrestlers along with some names who work for other promotions as well like Ring Of Honor, DragonGate, Evolve, Combat Zone Wrestling and Championship Wrestling From Hollywood.

One of the biggest names in the history of the promotion wrestled his final match before heading to join El Generico to ""take care of the orphans"" as Kevin Steen, who was drowned in streamers to the point where he looked like a mummy, took on rookie Trevor Lee in a match that saw Steen unload his typical offense earning himself new chants & nicknames from the crowd while also having some fun like having a conversation across the building with one of the announcers during the match while Lee putting up a fight himself including some aerial offense with Steen giving an emotional speech afterwords & a final ""curtain call"" with Mount Rushmore at the end of the night.  Fellow Mr. Rushmore members & P.W.G. Tag Team Champions Young Bucks defended the titles against The World's Cutiest Tag Team (Joey Ryan & Candace LaRae) in a Guerilla Warfare match with the first move in the match being chairshots to the head that saw everything from an ""appearence"" by Super Dragon, one man being dove onto four different times within seconds of each other, how the action was so out of control that it took one man minutes before he could finally get out of pre-match gear, fighting throughout the crowd & the stage area, weapons launched at opponents include a trash can & chairs along with more weapons contained inside black bags that would come into play, what the Young Bucks delievered & where they did it to result in Candace bleeding the ""crimson mask"", and what the Bucks used to make their ""superkick party"" more dangerous than it ever was before to the point where even Steen on commentary just wanted it to be over.  Kyle O'Reilly defended the P.W.G. Championship against Chris Hero in a grueling technical match that saw both men heavily focusing on a specific body part throughout the match relentlessly with stretches & submissions using whatever part of the ring they could to add pressure in a match that went close to 30 minutes.  Other matches include Adam Cole vs. Roderick Strong in a competitive #1 contendor match, Frankie Kazarian & Brian Kendrick making their returns to P.W.G. in a back & forth encounter, a hard hitting match between Rocky Romero & Tomasso Chiampa, Best Friends vs. Michael Elgin & Johnny Gargano that was filled with everything from strength moves to solid wrestling on the ground & in the air along with entertaining tactics with Chris Hero on commentary making the statement about Elgin & Gargano saying ""exceptional teamwork between two guys who never teamed together"", and ACH vs. Cedric Alexander who were very evenly matched throughout the match when it came to athleticism while each man had their various moments of crowd interaction from body surfing to accidently almost hitting hitting a suicide dive on a woman who was just trying to go to the bathroom.

I've always said you can never go wrong with a P.W.G. event & this was no exception with the only downfall being that some of the matches went a little too long & started to drag out a bit but overall was another enjoyable event with tons of emotion from the talents & crowd so it's worth watching.",1410998400,,3463,4.8232323232323235
