5087414,4,B007I1Q4BI,1970's blacksploitation film.  Somewhat based on the Parker novel.  Would have been better if stayed true to the novels.  Great cast.  No real surprises.  Good late-night entertainment.,1363564800,,185,5.703703703703703
5087415,2,B007I1Q4BI,"The whole reason I was determined to see ""The Split"" was because of it's exceptional cast. Gene Hackman, Ernest Borgnine, Warren Oates, Donald Suherland, Jim Brown, Jack Klugman. Some of my favorite actors, a few of them I will gladly see any thing that the are in, but sadly ""The Split"" is not worthy of their talent. The movie is obvious, familiar and dull, based on a novel by the great pulp novelist Richard Stark (Donald E. Westlake) and featuring a nice score by Quincy Jones, it is not a total waste, just a disappointment. For historical significance it is interesting as the first movie released with an ""R"" rating, but it is pretty tame by today's standards, and only the least bit interesting.

5087416,5,B007I1Q4BI,"The Split movie dvd 1968,5 stars for short car chase with 65'/66'Corvette Coupe-2-3 Stars for the Rest of Movie.
Got this as an Gift and I enjoyed it,but my favorite part is approx. 15 mins in when the 65'/66' Dark Red Corvette Sting Ray Coupe is chasing an Cadillac Limo. However,The movie at times can be boring and the plot not exactly original but at least different in that Football is involved which is good too,as for the cast and Acting,Kind of Mundane except Ernest Borgnine,another Neat very short scene is when an Bizzarrini pulls up to the hotel. The movie,it's quality and transfer is fine but the movie seems forgotten or overlooked and for good reason, It is not great Just good and worth an watch.",1359331200,,713,4.622047244094488
5087417,2,B007I1Q4BI,"I didn't like the plot or the quality of the film.  I didn't expect the quality to be that great, since it's an old movie that was digitally copied  I am sure. The disappointment was in the story line and or plot.",1355443200,,213,4.0476190476190474
5087418,2,B007I1Q4BI,"I saw this film on release in 1968, hoping that it would be as good as the prior year's Point Blank based on another Richard Stark novel, since when I had read nearly all the Parker novels then available in the intervening year. With a cast of well known faces in support (Oates, Borgnine, Sutherland (in an early film for him), Hackman and Klugman) the omens looked good but sadly on re-seeing the film again in 2012 it is all as dire as I remember it from the original cinema release!

The key problems are the script sacrifices the hard edge of the source Stark novel to venture into early Blaxploitation territory with Jim Brown and Diahann Carroll who provide zero of the menace or tension needed in the lead roles to make this crime caper and double cross plot work. The best actor in the whole film is a manipulative Julie Harris who shows the type of cunning that the lead characters roles lack. Add to that a very disjointed and edited shoot with too many late 60s/early 70s set camera pieces (e.g. red full screen images for sunset beach walks and too much zooming around in the action pieces) and a pretty unbelievable depicted storyline of Brown as the gang leader and Hackman as a corrupt policeman working together after the heist has gone wrong, means very little works or is memorable in this movie.

The strange opening and ending with little explanation or closure probably sums the whole sad affair up.",1353974400,5,1421,4.590551181102362
5087419,1,B007I1Q4BI,"film was based on one of the legendary Richard Stark[Donald Westlake]novels. Poor in every way. Aimless adaption, incoherent changed plot. A major disappointment version of a minor classic novel.",1353628800,3,195,5.758620689655173
5087420,4,B007I1Q4BI,"It's a treat to see this many excellent actors all in one movie. Jim Brown convincingly plays a no-nonsense operator who assembles a diverse team to rob the L.A. Coliseum of more than half a million dollars. Recommended if you like any of the featured actors. Each has a standout moment that reveals how different his/her character is from the others in the film. The cinematography is vivid, and the location photography at the Coliseum only makes you wish there was more of it. The plot (no spoiler) takes an odd turn toward the end, which may account for the film's lack of popularity. But the cast and the other positive attributes (Quincy Jones' score, for example) far outweigh this slight drawback.",1338768000,7,705,4.786885245901639

8516948,5,B007I1Q4BI,"I want to clearly state that I LOVE THIS MOVIE!!! And I always have, ever since I first saw it on the big screen way back in the day at my favorite neighborhood theatre. It wasn't a box office hit, however, so I never thought it would ever get an official pristine remastered dvd release. Kudos to Warner's Archive Collection for this and many other obscure dvd releases. I strongly disagree with some of the reviews that claim it is dull and boring-as a crime thriller I admit that it's not in the same league as, say, The French Connection or Don Siegal's highly underrated classic Madigan, but it does move at a swift enough pace to hold your interest. I do have one question to pose to anybody out there who may know the answer to a burning question that hit me as I watched the dvd. At the 1:02:41 mark, just after the landlord (James Whitmore) machineguns Ellie to death, it appears a scene was cut because the movie abruptly jumps to show  the landlord in an anguished state without the gun in his hand. Unfortunately, it's been some 45 years since I last saw the film, so I can't recall if any scenes were actually cut. However, the film was rated R, and in Leonard Maltins movie guide he lists the running time as 91 min, while the dvd only clocks in at a little under 90 min. Just for curiosity's sake, if anyone does know if the dvd is indeed cut, this inquiring mind would like to know. Nevertheless, I still highly recommend this action flick.",1433462400,2,1456,4.392592592592592

8516950,4,B007I1Q4BI,"The novels of Donald Westlake (writing as Richard Stark) have really provided a lot of grist for the Hollywood mill since the 1960s.  The first example was the 1967 John Boorman-directed film POINT BLANK, with Lee Marvin, based on Westlake's book ""The Hunter"", and now considered a cult classic.  After that came 1972's THE HOT ROCK (with George Segal and Robert Redford), 1974's THE OUTFIT (with Robert Duvall and Robert Ryan); and 1974's BANK SHOT (with George C. Scott).

And in 1968, there was THE SPLIT.

Based on Westlake's book ""The Seventh"", the film is a classically themed Hollywood heist film, involving a group of thieves robbing the cash office at the Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum during a playoff game between the Los Angeles Rams and the Atlanta Falcons. Former NFL legend Jim Brown, who turned to acting after retiring from the Cleveland Browns in 1965 and became a star in Robert Aldrich's 1967 classic THE DIRTY DOZEN, is the leader of this group that includes his fellow DIRTY DOZEN cast members Donald Sutherland and Ernest Borgnine; Jack Klugman (one of the jurors in the 1957 classic TWELVE ANGRY MEN); and veteran character actor Warren Oates. The heist goes off with almost laser-like perfection, but it's what happens thereafter--the complications; the screw-ups; and the betrayals--that are the real payoff. Gene Hackman, who had at the time recently leaped to acting prominence as a result of his role in BONNIE AND CLYDE, portrays a seedy Los Angeles cop (perhaps presaging his Oscar-winning turn in THE FRENCH CONNECTION); and Diahann Carroll and Julie Harris are the women involved. James Whitmore plays a superbly seedy landlord at Carroll's apartment.

By 21st century standards, this must seem terribly old-fashioned: there are no hyper-violent, over-the-top stunts, no CGI bloodshed, or any of that extraneous junk. And this is clearly a film of the late 1960s, in terms of costumes, hairstyles, and all of that--this and, of course, the fact that the Rams were L.A.'s pro-football team too. And yet, even though it doesn't necessarily stand out among the many great crime heist films, from Stanley Kubrick's THE KILLING to Sam Peckinpah's THE GETAWAY, the original 1974 subway thriller THE TAKING OF PELHAM ONE TWO THREE, or even the 1988 blockbuster DIE HARD, there's still something hugely fascinating about THE SPLIT, in terms of the way suspense is built up. Perhaps part of the reason it isn't as well-known as it should be is that the director, British-born Gordon Flemyng, was not a known entity, save for a couple of episodes of the classic TV series ""The Avengers"", and the campy 1965 film DR. WHO AND THE DALEKS. All the same, though, the cast still does well under Flemyng's direction, with very good cinematography by Burnett Guffey (who won an Oscar for BONNIE AND CLYDE), and a taut, early action film music score by Quincy Jones, who had done major work on THE PAWNBROKER, IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT, and IN COLD BLOOD. This was also the first film to be released following the establishment of the movie ratings system by the MPAA where the for-adults 'R' rating was placed, even though it is closer to a 'PG-13' rating by today's ultra-violent standards.

Yes, the film is extremely dated; and despite its length of only 90 minutes, it's not an especially super-fast movie.  But given its limitations, it still has much more to it than most action films even today.",1429401600,,3416,4.930434782608696
8516951,4,B007I1Q4BI,"While the plot and storyline are pretty simple, a robbery with a murder and disappearance of the money, it is an entertaining film that gives you the chance to see a wealth of stars all together in one caper movie.  Jim Brown, Dianna Carroll, Ernest Borgnine, Donald Sutherland, Warren Oates, Julie Harris, Jack Klugman, James Whitmore and Gene Hackman.  This was the first of the Richard Stark (Donald Westlake) Parker stories made into a movie.  The name was changed to McClain in the movie.  Parker was a hard-edged career criminal.  Later portrayed by Lee Marvin in Point Blank, Mel Gibson in Payback and Jason Statham in Parker.  While not a great film it was entertaining crime caper film and worth a watch.  While it got the first R rating for a movie,  today you wouldn't even give it a PG-13.  More a PG for adults.",1420070400,,824,4.627586206896551
