7340484,5,B011Q0KET4,"For any & all fans of 80s movies, sci-fi movies, & comedy movies, Back to the Future needs no introduction. For those of the younger generation, or never had any interest in seeing the movies, Back to the Future is the essential movie trilogy for all of those, with a little music thrown in for good measure. All 3 films offer a great experience & the story is pretty seamless, despite some obvious aging by Michael J. Fox between movies 1 & 2 & George & Jennifer's actors changing at the same time due to actor weirdness in real life for both of the originals.

Back to the Future is a movie about a kid named Marty getting accidentally thrown back in time when he drives his friend, Doc's, DeLorean to 88 MPH, thus activating the time machine & sending him back in time 30 years to 1955 & sets forth the events of him having to go, as the movie's name points out, back to the future while also having to make sure his parents still hook up before he disappears from history since he interfered with their initial meeting.

Back to the Future Part 2 picks up where the 1st part ends & sees Marty & Doc travel forward in time to October 21, 2015, yes, the day after this set's set to release, to a hilariously both totally rightly predicted & hilariously wrong version of 2015 to help out Marty's future son, but then disaster strikes when they return to 1985 to see that Hill Valley, the town where all 3 films take place, has been transformed into an alternate, more militarized state. They then have to go back to 1955 to fix it by preventing what causes it to happen.

Back to the Future Part 3 picks up where Part 2 left off, having Marty follow Doc into the past to 1885, 100 years prior to the present he's from, because due to unfortunate & unforeseen circumstances, Doc got trapped back there &, after fixing the time circuits in the time machine with Doc's 1955 self, Marty defies 1985 Doc's wishes, & goes back to bring him back to 1985 with him. It takes many tropes associated with westerns & even pays homage to Clint Eastwood's The Good, The Bad, & The Ugly along the way.

All 3 of these films are classics. 1 has great comedy as well as great suspense. Part 2 has the sci-fi, going WAY more into it than the first part did. Steven Spielberg, the main producer & Robert Zemeckis, the director have both said that this film is their favorite out of the 3. Spielberg even compared it to Star Wars V. Zemeckis said it's his favorite movie out of any he's directed. I wholeheartedly agree that it is the best out of all 3 of them, but most only give 1 credit. Then again I'm also more into the sci-fi genre, so maybe I have a bias, but don't believe the naysayers, it's just as good, if not better that 1. Part 3 is just as good as the first 2, only as a western, which Spielberg said could rival any of the westerns that came before it. Don't believe me? Watch the special features from the 2010 Blu-Ray release & tell me I'm wrong.

Anyways, all films get 10/10's from me. Perfect film trilogy that is so quintessentially 80s. I say that even though 3 came out in 1990, but I digress. It also pioneered special effects by them having to build a special camera while Zemeckis was directing Who Framed Roger Rabbit to be able to have multiple actors appear as multiple characters, or multiple versions of the same character in the scenes, which in Part 3 are glaringly obvious in 1 scene due to lighting differences for 1 character versus the other & versus the background of the scene, but, again, I digress.

If you like time travel, Michael J. Fox, Christopher Lloyd, 80s films, sci-fi films, slight musicals, &/or timeless classic movies/stories, these are definite films to own.

As for the cartoon, it's ok. Other than having a pre-Danny Phantom David Kaufman as a voice double for Michael J. Fox, a pre-Spectacular Spider-Man kid-aged Josh Keaton as Jules, & a post-Homer Simpson Dan Castellaneta as animated Doc Brown as part of the voice cast, not to mention Christoper Lloyd as live action Doc Brown, Bill Nye the Science Guy as Doc's assistant, & Mary Steenbergen voicing animated Clara (seriously, this show had star power), the show's fine for a Saturday morning kid's show. It certainly can get pretty entertaining with how the characters get into whacky situations every episode. Plus, it certainly doesn't make kids dumber for watching it like a lot of today's kid's shows. I've seen some of the episodes a few years ago when someone uploaded them to YouTube & it's not bad as early-90s kid's shows based off of acclaimed live action movies go.

This release IS notable for being the first time this show has ever been released on DVD, so there's that, though since it's looking like the movie discs are having the same special features as the 2010 release, it might not be entirely worth it for fans who've bought the original Blu-Ray to buy this. The complete animated series is available to preorder separately from this set, so if you want just the animated series, well, there you go. Also, since the animated series is gonna be on DVD, it seems Universal only wanted to put the movies on the Blu-Rays & not upgrade the show to HD, or put the SD versions of the episodes on Blu-Ray discs to save space with the packaging, it might be weird, but I see why they did that though.

Anyways, this set looks awesome. 4 Blu-Rays with actual disc art for the movies unlike the 2010 Blu-Ray release which, just like every other Universal film release, & what's slowly becoming the norm I fear amongst every company that's releasing TV shows & movies to disc format, had just blank discs with the logos of the movies printed on them. Sure it's modified from the posters, but still. Plus a booklet, separate cases for the movies & animated series, & a replica of the flux capacitor!?! This is a win win for any & all fans of this franchise, plus digital HD copy codes, all for slightly less than $100? I'm sold. I hope you guys will be too.",1437004800,10,5962,4.467401285583104

7340566,1,B011Q0KET4,I was so excited in getting the Complete Back to the Future Adventures on Blu-ray. I was so disappointed. On the condition of the Blu-ray & DVD discs. I contacted Amazon. And they couldn't do a thing but speak to them. Please beware of making this purchase like i did. It may be a wonderful deal. But in the long run you are going to get Blu-rays and DVDs totally scratched up and finger printed on them. The only thing I'm thankful is I didn't pay more then I did for this Blu-ray Box set. Sad how quality for things people buy has going down hill now days.,1517529600,,558,4.175925925925926
7340567,4,B011Q0KET4,Great collection.  Definitely worth the price.  My only negative is that the animated series are on DVD rather than blu ray.  The companion book and bonus disc are a nice touch.,1517097600,,177,4.645161290322581

7340572,3,B011Q0KET4,"First of all, the movies themselves and the extra content here is great. I just want to get that out of the way.

However, if you already own the 25th Anniversary trilogy DVDs then don't bother with this set unless you're upgrading to blu-ray. The disks here are literally the same exact disks found in the old trilogy set. They didn't even change the disk art in attempt to hide this as the bonus disk says ""25th Anniversary"" right on it despite the box art saying 30th.

The collection also includes the animated series for the first time anywhere and a small behind the scenes booklet. However, if you already own the old box set then you're better off buying the animated series separately and the excellent and much more complete ""Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History"" book instead.

Finally what everyone has said about the packaging is true. The light-up lenticular flux capacitor is kind of neat but nothing special. The box itself is a very fragile combination of cardboard and paper and is likely to get destroyed in shipping. I had to repair torn corners with clear tape and it was very disappointing.

If you don't already own these films then this is a great way to get all of the BttF media in one place but if you do, there's nothing new here to worry yourself about.",1508976000,2,1293,4.560344827586207

The sticker of the Back to the Future logo that is placed over the lenticular Flux Capacitor keeps curling due to poor adhesive.

Massive fan of the films, but only had a basic trilogy collection so I was really keen to see the extras and also get my hands on the cartoon series.
This also means I can't compare this to other collections that have been released previously.

I won't go over the storyline, I'm sure you're looking at this as a fan and wondering if you should buy it.  From my point of view this has been a brilliant set to get, all the films, loads of extras and the full cartoon set make this a fantastic collection.

The packaging is a little disappointing for a collector's addition, the box is just cardboard and although it has a light up flux capacitor the light doesn't actually flux, it's more of a 'fixed capacitor'!

There is an included booklet to give you some back story, but if you're a fan I'd recommend getting the full sized version:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Back-to-the-Future-The-Ultimate-Visual-History/dp/0062419145/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Back to the Future: The Ultimate Visual History</a>

5 stars for the films, still absolutely brilliant all these years later, but 4 for this set as I think a bit more could've been done to package this up better.

I think it looks amazing for a Blu Ray box set. I mean, were people expecting the DVD's to come in an actual flux capacitor for $88 bucks?! Perhaps these were the same people that were disappointed that the Seinfeld series box set didn't come in an actual working refrigerator. Or that the X-ray glasses they sent in for in the back of their comic books didn't actually see through clothes? But I digress...
  The packaging consists of a metallic box with a back lit lenticular photograph of the flux capacitor. When moved from side to side there is a pretty convincing fluxing effect. Pretty cool design for a box if you ask me. As far as the bonus features; yes much of the content is brought over from previous releases of the films. If this wasn't included people would probably complain as well. I think it's great to have all the content in one place instead of having to go back and search through previous releases. However the focus should really be on the new content that is included. For the first time ever the full animated series is included which is something I have been personally waiting for. Also, the included documentary by Steve Concotelli called OUTATIME that showcases the restoration of the screen used Delorean Time Machine is top notch. These alone make the purchase worth the $88 dollar price tag. Shop around and you can even find the box set for much less... Anyway, big thumbs up to Universal for a great box set!

I placed the 25th anniversay set and the 30th side by side and find that they are exatly the same, Bluray menus and all. The animated series is a great bonus, but not worth the $90 paid (I saw it as a stand alone set at Walmart for $30). So sad - so this will be returned to Amazon, unfortuantely. I'll just watch my 25th anniversary and get the exact same thing.",1446336000,4,527,4.217821782178218
7340868,5,B011Q0KET4,"Amazing set for any BTTF fans, definitely recommended. One thing to note, however, is that the flux capacitor is actually a backlit 3D laminate, and not an actual recreation, but it still looks very convincing, and it lights up very convincingly, would prefer a swith instead of a timed button though, but that's just a personal preference.

Also worth noting, some of the extra material is repeated between discs, but its just so you don't have to swap discs to see it I guess. Lots of cool insight in there, you even get to watch the BTTF: The Ride video.",1446336000,,557,4.57
7340869,2,B011Q0KET4,"A big disappointment for a big BTTF fan. Lets put in perspective that the Amazon price was around the round $90.00. I was one of those who pre-ordered it back on July and at that time the price was like $99 and I was willing to pay that much for what I saw at the moment. When I saw the pictures and promo the common (reasonable) person would think that the Flux Capacitor package was made of metal (not stainless steel, white gold, silver), but at least aluminum!....I checked on every website for product description and the info was the same: BTTF I, II & III on Blu Ray, a Bonus Disc (also in Blu Ray), a mini book (an excerpt from BTTF a Visual History), Season I & II from the Cartoon Series (DVD). This was ok with me...considering that I already have the DVD Trilogy and the 25th Anniversary Blu Ray Edition. The new Box itself was worth the price (I thought)...oh! and it also said that it light up.
When the box arrived everything changed...the metal was carton...the Flux Capacitor cables were just a 3D image, yes it lights up, but nothing special...just as a McDonalds Happy Meal common toy (cheap looking). It's not even like the picture, that looks like real lightning.
About the box content: the movies are the same discs as the 25th Anniversary...not a single special feature was added. The Cartoon Series is ok, is something that I did not have, so its a new addition to my BTTF collection (a good one). The Bonus Disc is another big disappointment. This disc was the special opportunity to add value to this box set since the movies are the same that were previously released. The content is very poor. Does not add anything special for the true fans. The clips are very, very short. It says over two hours of special features or something like that, yes, but among those special features are two episodes from the cartoon series which is ridiculous considering that the Complete Series is included in this Box set... so at the end you have like one hour o less of NEW (and real) special features.
The book (a 64 pages, excerpt form the Visual History Book) is very cheaply made. You can barely open it.... feels like its going to torn apart by the way it was glued. Ive not seen the book content entirely, it looks very interesting, but by the way it is made its is not suitable to read without damaging it. Im buying the complete book instead. So, the book also does not add too much value to the Box set.
In conclusion, the promo and description was one of the most misleading advertising that Ive ever seen (the pictures were purposely retouched to make fans believe another thing). And it is a big disappointment, since its my favorite movie, I live, breath and eat BTTF. The Box set ended in my Blu Rays shelve as an exhibition. I took the cartoon series out in order to do not need to open the Box set at all; if I need to watch the movies I will use the 25th edition. The Box Set would not last if you open and close it, even under a regular and normal use.
This was a rip off. Its not worth 90, 80, 70 nor 60, maybe 50 as much. Here is my advice, if you already have the 25th anniversary Blu Ray, buy the DVD version of this Box Set (meaning that it's less expensive), you will have the same lame Flux Capacitor Box and the Cartoon Series. Otherwise, if you don't have the Trilogy in Blu Ray, just buy the 25th Edition in Blu Ray, and if you still want the Box, buy it in DVD format, or in Blu Ray (if less than $50). I never thought that I would write a bad review for a BTTF produtc...",1446336000,3,3515,4.311178247734139

7340878,2,B011Q0KET4,"Very Disappointed. I had expected more for the money spent on this.
Things that were not clear to me during the pre-order period:
- It *does* light up, but *not at all* like in the movie;
- It's CARDBOARD. I wasn't exactly expecting stainless steel, but *any* attempt at a metal enclosure would have been a no-brainer.
I *really* hope the discs are worth it. Animated series, bonus footage and shorts, the booklet, and having digital download copies are all a nice touch, but I feel the advertising was misleading. There's no way I would consider putting the case on display on the shelf as a 'flux capacitor'.",1445904000,4,610,4.657407407407407

I spoke with friend who uses one to time travel with his train no problem so I know The problem isn't compatibility.

Just got a visit from future me. Save your money and wait for the 50th anniversary edition.

This ""complete adventures"" box set is little more than a cash-in on the fans' love for these amazing movies and their excitement that the ""future"" has finally arrived. Instead of going all out for the fans, we wind up getting the exact same discs that were in the 25th anniversary box set from 2010. They have not been mastered in 4K or remastered in any way and contain no additional bonus features or commentaries; these are the discs from the set that was released 5 years ago, now housed in cardboard sleeves. There is a 4th bonus disc with an additional documentary from 2009, some fake commercials, a documentary on the restoration of the original DeLorean, and Christopher Llyoyd mugging for the camera as Doc Brown, but it ultimately feels like a waste of a Blu Ray. In addition, the set includes all 26 episodes of the cringe-worthy Saturday morning cartoon on DVD. There's a book with some behind the scenes pictures to flip through as well as a download voucher for an Ultraviolet digital copy of the movie. Other than that, you get a cheap cardboard box with a picture of a flux capacitor that lights up with a sticker that says Back to the Future the Complete Adventures. This is not the set that fans have been anticipating for all of these years. Other than animated series, which can be purchased separately, everything else is from the 2010 set, and bonus disc material can probably be found on YouTube. This is a sad way to treat the fans.",1445731200,5,1608,4.567474048442906

Like others have said, the flux capacitor is merely a lenticular photo with LEDs behind it, which looks very disappointing. The rest of the box is too plain -- I was hoping/expecting the spine to have the set's name or the logo on it so it would stand out on the shelf. But it doesn't.

The Animated Series is on DVD only. The listing at the time didn't say this on Amazon. In fact it said that the Animated Series was on Blu-Ray only for this Limited Edition set. So we ordered this set thinking it was on Blu-Ray. Now Amazon changed the listing of the Special Features. Must of changed it within the 3 months. This is very misleading! Amazon should have ALL THE FACTS before putting up a listing on the site! Another misleading statement was that this box set was suppose to be in a metal tin case. Guess what? It's not. In fact it's a cheaply made cardboard that looks like a tin case. Are you kidding me? WOW what a way to mislead and lie to loyal fans Amazon and Universal! Flux Capacitor is basically a hologram with a light bulb behind it. It has a cool effect but the pictures posted on the internet from Universal and Amazon look way different then the actual product. Way different... It's bad enough that Pepsi and Nike
up with the Pepsi Perfect being Limited to 6,500 and the Shoes are only available for auction. Now Universal is messing things up too. It's a real shame... With Universal it's worse because they are scamming the fans... And let's face it. This set ISN'T Worth $90.00. If it had all the stuff that was stated Animated Series on Blu-Ray, Flux Capacitor made out of real plastic inside the case, and the Case being a actual tin then it would be worth the $90.00 some dollars!",1445472000,6,1579,4.429553264604811

7340889,2,B011Q0KET4,"After getting this so-called limited edition in the mail I'm torn to say the least!
At the end of the day this was a massive cash grab to rake the fans over the coals
deep down i knew this would be a massive let down
Along with the gimmicky so-called limited edition pepsi
all this was just brilliant marketing with plenty of smoke and mirrors!
My first impressions of the box
Cheap and very ugly  (you can tap a small button on the front of the case) and the flux capacitor  lights up really (that light might last a month) Why was this  90 bucks???!!! there is no real proof this is limited in any way for the amount of money it should have been numbered with dare i say it a
Certificate of authenticity at least try to sell the grift! (The Limited edition of Night Breed put out last fall was a bit over priced but, it had a number on every copy sold that was over priced for all the right reasons)
Another major issue i have with the box it's to big it looks like a dvd box set
Why wasn't this put in a limited edition Steelbook
ooh right Universal are cheap and don't give a damn about the consumer
I'm a huge Back to the Future fan (i already have two other box sets of the trilogy)
I used a gift card to pay for the shake down!
I mostly payed through the nose to get the Complete Animated Series
which are dvd's! (which i knew going into it)
Why couldn't they have remastered the animated series smack all 26 episodes on two blu ray disc
The bonus disc seems to be mostly lame filler
a Doc Brown Short what??? why???
Outatime: Restoring the DeLorean  (Massive filler)
Looking Back to the Future (9-part retrospective  documentary is from 2009) This was on the first Universal BTTF DVD Box Set
I'd  go as far as saying almost all the extras are ported over from other dvd's/blu ray's
Digital HD Code (more filler) this should NOT be a selling point on the front of the box set
This whole thing was rushed and only put out to make easy quick money from dummies like me who tried to have faith
Anyone who's defending this and saying it's a must have is delusional or in shock that they got  bent over  screwed this bad and never once told i love you...................
This is Not at all worth the price trust me . I admit it Universal screwed me!
I'm very close to just sending this set back and getting a refund
I've made up my mind it's not worth keeping and it's not worth the super high price tag
I see this limited box set being around much like The Complete Halloween BR box set for at least a year maybe longer.....
If you have the previous BR box set save your money for a  hoverboard
If you are on the fence about blind buying it wait until
black Friday (i see this going for $60.00  the closer we get to the upcoming holidays)
My only question to Universal how long till
the Ultimate Ultimate 4K BR Box Set that has a fake coffee machine built into the case
all consumers need to stand up so stuff like this don't continue to happen
shameless lazy boxset
 (If you wanna see real Limited Edition BR look at Scream Factor's Limited edition of Nightbreed or Arrow Video's OOP Hellraiser  BR Box set) Those are real Limited editions",1445472000,64,3143,4.2462311557788945
7340890,3,B011Q0KET4,"Yes back to the future is my all time film series, and yes I own them on VHS DVD BLURAY and now this awesome set. After watching nearly all the content yesterday on Back to the Future day (except the cartoon) I can say this is a solid 5 star set. Yes its pretty similar to the 25th Anniversary edition, and the ""New"" short film was kinda lame but the Jaws 19 and Hover Board commercials were really nice touches. The reason I buy any blurry/dvd is the packaging. Now when this item first went online, I thought like many of you it was a metal tin with a real flux capacitor. The box alone was worth all $88 to me. HOWEVER it is a nice cardboard instead which was not marketed as such. The promo pics were some photographic fakery if ya ask me. When I found this out I canceled my order and decided to live without it.

BUT THEN I WENT ON BEST BUY.COM. There they had it listed as $50. Now one blurry is anywhere from $10-$30 depending, so for 3 awesome flicks, a but ton of bonus features, art book,  AND an entire cartoon series, PLUS the let down but still cool box I could justify it. It took me about 4 hours to get my hands on it because each store only got 2 or 3 in stock and it wouldn't let me order it online. Now I don't know if they will restock them and if they will be $50, it may have just been a one day deal. If you can get your hands on it for $50 or $60 bucks it is easily worth it!

I know Amazon was trying to be clever with their $88 asking price, but with the box not actually being metal and the flux capasator being a 3D sticker it is NOT worth the price. It is an amazing product however and if you can get your hands on it cheaper it is totally worth it!

7340901,3,B011Q0KET4,"This review is specifically for the 30th anniversary 'flux capacitor' boxset.  If I could give two separate ratings for this, I would.  The movies themselves rate 5 stars, but the boxset presentation is a 2-3 at best.  The boxset itself is cardboard style, and not that sturdy.  The biggest disappointment though is the flux capacitor packaging.  The effect is achieved by just a very very cheap lenticular image which uses LR1154 batteries to provide the light up effects.  And to top it off, the ""Back to the Future: The Complete Adventures"" logo is a sticker that was already peeling off, wouldn't stay put.  :(

The other disappointment lies inside the set.  Unfortunately the movies are housed inside a media book style cover(which never truly closes), and the discs are houses in cardboard sleeves(which can cause the blurays to scratch much faster than traditional packaging).  Each movie gets its own disc, with the fourth one being solely for the extras(which has the Doc Brown Saves The World short mini movie/episode).

The animated series is housed in a clear DVD style and sized case, which doesn't match the packaging for the blurays. I thought the TV series would get a bluray release in this set, but they're just DVDs. Disappointing.  Well, at least the animated show is spread out along four discs and is not crammed in 1 or 2.

The mini booklet is a scaled down version of the ""Back to the Future: A Visual History"" book by Michael Klastorin(which you should buy if you're a detail obsessed BTTF fanatic!).  It's pretty cool and is slightly larger/wider than a standard paperback book.  Overall, I couldn't tell if the image in the 30th anniversary set was any better than the 25th release, but the image quality is still good.
It's a comprehensive but flawed release of a pretty beloved movie trilogy. Wish it was better.",1445299200,8,1841,4.8370607028754

7340903,1,B011Q0KET4,"I don't know when Universal started this, but with both this and Jurassic World 3D collector's tin, they now pack your movie discs in cardboard sleeves rather than proper Blu-ray cases.

Ironically, the included animated series in the package comes in a normal DVD case, but the movies - presumably the reason you're buying the set - do not.

So unless you've no issue purchasing your own Blu-ray cases, stay far away from this edition.

Pathetic, Universal - no wonder more people are just buying digital media when you treat people purchasing physical media so poorly.",1445299200,14,570,4.916666666666667
7340904,2,B011Q0KET4,"I finally received this box set after months of anticipation.  This set is a major disappointment highlighted by cheap packaging.

First, the light up Flux Capacitor is very misleading.  It's a cardboard box with a cheap lenticular printed card on top (the kind with a thin layer of wavy plastic).  The lanticular printing is used as a terrible 3D effect if viewed from just the right angle and distance.  Mostly, you just see a double blurred image.  The card has a clear section with an LED behind it so it can light up.  The light is solid white with no sequence of flashing or sounds to simulate the activity of the actual movie prop.  The box includes instructions for changing the watch battery.  I find this ironic because the package is so embarrassing to look at, I can't imagine anyone wanting to display it; much less to actually use the light.  I don't expect to ever change the battery.

The Blu-ray movie discs are stored in cardboard booklet using cardboard sleeves.  The disc book has a decently thick cardboard cover and a fairly well designed binding.  However the sleeves will leave your discs vulnerable to scratching every time you pull them out and put them back.

To clarify, the animated series is only included on DVD.  It is not Blu-ray.  Luckily, the discs are included inside a standard plastic DVD case with hard plastic pages for the discs to snap into.

The book is paperback printed on fair stock.  It has some great images but the binding and cover are cheap.  Do not expect a book that you can actually open all the way without the glued pages eventually falling out.  You will need to crease the binding to even get it to open up 90 degrees.  I've seen better quality books from under-funded local tourist attractions.

The disc booklet, animated series DVD case, and book are tightly packed into the back of the box.  Like Blu-ray cases, the disc booklet is slightly shorter than the DVD case.  So, they've included a folded piece of cardboard to fill the space and fumble with every time you want to get anything out of the box.  They included a pull ribbon to help get the items out of the box.  Without it, you would never get anything out.

With the exception of the DVD case, the discs themselves, and the tiny circuit board that controls the worthless LED, everything is cardboard.  Apparently plastic was too expensive for the fans.

I shouldn't need to point that the movies themselves are excellent.  The animated series is entertaining enough.  The special features are not very special except for the new Doc Brown short.  Frankly, with the exception of the short, it's nothing that hasn't been seen before.  Obviously, the Doc Brown short, like the package, is absolutely not worth $90 and I can not recommend that anyone should buy this.",1445299200,198,2786,4.678350515463918
7340905,1,B011Q0KET4,"The package is a cheap cardboard box with a lenticular (cheap 3D effect) panel for the flux capacitor innards. The light is a simple LED arrangement behind the lenticular display. It's not worth the money at all.

7340910,4,B011Q0KET4,"Some of you may remember there was a 25th Anniversary Edition collection released not too long ago and are wondering why yet another one? Well I'm sad to say other than the fact this is the 30th Anniversary there are just a few exclusive items in this collection to get those of you who did not jump on the last collection to go ahead and grab one now. For those of you who have the previous version not so much. While the exclusive features are a welcome addition it's hard to say a double/triple dip is in order. That being said this particular collection does offer a lot of bang for the buck.

Back to the Future was a breakaway hit from Robert Zemeckis that proved you can make a huge success out of a sci-fi comedy. It was also one of the few movies to prove you can do the same with a trilogy of films. The trilogy is about teenager Marty McFly (Michael J. Fox) traveling back in time, forward and time and so on using a car retrofitted to be a time machine by eccentric scientist Dr. Emmitt Brown. In the first movie Marty flies back in time and accidentally changes the course of history, affecting his very existence. The second movie has Marty and Doc Brown going to the future briefly only to affect the present, needing to go back to the past to fix it (confused yet?). The third movie mercifully stays in one time period... the old west. The plot of each film puts the old time paradox theory at the crux of the conflict (changing something in the past affecting the present in major ways), and turns such serious and deep philosophical and scientific discussions into a situation comedy.... in a splendid way.

Doing a time paradox comedy could be too much to handle for a lesser director and writer. However Back to the Future is very enjoyable to watch. All the scientific jargon is limited to a few rants from Doc Brown that give you just enough you need to understand what is happening and what needs to be done to fix it. If doesn't hurt that Micheal J. Fox is an incredibly charismatic actor that knows how to play the balance of teen angst/fish out of water when needed while executing the swagger and timing to keep his character from being too stereotypical. One of the themes in each film is the concept of actions and events repeating themselves. The audience has a chance to get in on little deja vu moments automatically recognizable as something that happened in a previous film as if they are inside jokes between the director and the viewer.

The production is definitely A-list for an 80's movie. The acting is pretty top notch across the board. The special effects look very clean and dynamic (and not a lot of flashy effects to drown out the storytelling). The soundtrack is big and classic sounding, which makes the movie that much more enjoyable to watch. For those of you who are sci-fi fans looking for high brow science and storytelling please keep in mind this is a movie for the masses, and it has been able to resonate with a very large audience, including hard core sci-fi fans.

This collection is essentially the same as the previous Anniversary edition. Same discs with the same mastering. It looks great in hi-def, but some who treasure that classic film grain may nitpick at the extensive digital noise reduction and edge enhancements. This is NOT a 4K remaster, which would have been sweet (and almost required) considering the major send up and marketing this date is having.  What makes the 30th Anniversary Edition stand out from the previous 25th Anniversary Edition are the inclusion of the following:

Back to the Future Complete Animated Series - This is the cartoon series that aired Saturday mornings in the early 90's, and starred Dan Castellaneta of Simpsons fame as the voice of Doc Brown. You get the entire series of 25 episodes on five DVDs along with storyboards, still galleries and the featurettes Drawn to the Future and Back to the Future: The Animated Series Revisited. These are the exact same discs that are being sold separately on the DVD collection Back to the Future: The Complete Animated Series.

Doc Brown Saves the World! - A short film starring Christopher Lloyd that tries to explain why the year 2015 today is very different from the year 2015 as it's presented in Back to the Future Part II. I heard that other short films may be included as well. Will post updates if I find them.

OUTATIME: Restoring the DeLorean -  Back in 2010 Temporal FX's Joe Walser headed up a team to restore the original time machine on four wheels to its 1985 glory. This is the documentary that chronicles the restoration and history of the famed car after its Hollywood fame.

Looking Back to the Future: A 9-part retrospective documentary from 2009 loaded with interviews with cast and crew, behind the scenes footage, and other clips that make a great addition to this collection.

Back to the Future: The Animated Series - A strange addition considering the complete animated series is in this collection.  The episodes ""Brothers"" and ""Mac the Black"" are shown.

These exclusives are all on a single disc while the other features are organized in the same disc format as previously released. These other extra features included in this collection came from the 25th Anniversary Edition, and include:

U-Control - Universal Studios have been playing with this ""interactive Blu-Ray"" concept for a while now, and it's still not all that. On this disc it gives you mostly text based extras like a trivia track, storyboard comparisons and other pre-production information.

Tales from the Future - This is an extensive six part documentary totaling over two hours on its own. It covers just about everything regarding the making of the Back to the Future trilogy.

The Physics of Back to the Future - A discussion with physicist Michio Kaku on the science behind the movie. And yes there is enough valid science in the movies to warrant this.

Back to the Future Night - This was an NBC special hosted by Leslie Nielsen that came on before the television broadcast of Back to the Future.

And the rest are the features from previous DVD releases:

Deleted Scenes - 16 deleted scenes total making up about 18 minutes of footage. Some of it is pretty raw, but this is the only extra from this set that is presented in high definition (the reset are standard def).

Michael J. Fox Q&A - About ten minutes with Fox thinking back on the movie.

Q & A Commentaries with Zemeckis and Gale - There was a screening event at USC where Zemekis and Gale did a Q&A after the film. This is a recording of those sessions.

Archival Featurettes - Making of the Trilogy: Chapters 1-3 that were a 2002 DVD release, The Making of 'Back to the Future' Parts I - III (don't know where this came from), The Secrets of the 'Back to the Future' Trilogy was a TV special hosted by Kirk Cameron. Could be one more in this set that I'm not aware of.

Behind the Scenes Footage - Nearly 30 minutes of footage including make up and other test footage, outtakes, design footage and more.

Music Videos - Two videos. ""Power of Love"" with Huey Lewis and the News and ""DoubleBack"" with ZZ Top.

Audio Commentaries - Informative comments from Co-Writer Bob Gale and co-producer Neil Canton. A by the numbers affair, but you get a lot of details.

Back to the Future: The Ride - This is a nice way of archiving a popular ride from the Universal Studios theme park. It pieces together both the video elements from the ride and some actual ride footage to give you as complete an experience as you can get while not actually on the ride.

This is a pretty extensive collection of extras, but I can't help feel it's not as good as it can be. Aside from the lack of 4K remastering there is other stuff I know exists like the footage with Eric Stoltz as Marty McFly that they could have squeezed into the new extras. Still this edition also adds a couple more carrots to dangle in front of you. One is a 64 page booklet titled Back to the Future: A Visual History. It's light version of the visual history book being released. The other is exclusive packaging that looks like the flux capacity, and even lights up. Also you get digital download options. Now if the price tag is too high I believe they are also releasing a regular 30th Anniversary edition minus the special limited edition packaging. If you already have the 25th Anniversary edition maybe just pick up the animated series if you want every show. It's hard to justify the extra features as enough for you make the big plunge yet again.",1444176000,58,8523,4.590131578947369
7340911,5,B011Q0KET4,"Normally I don't give reviews to pre-ordered items, due to the fact that you have to see it to believe it,........but,.........
I can't think of a better trilogy to pass along to my kids. Sure, there's some language, but believe it or not, most of the swearing in the Back To The Future trilogy is rather amusing!
There's more than a handful of people who are waiting for this version to be released onto Blu-ray. I, myself made the pre-order minutes ago. If you know people who have never seen any of these three films, I think you should have yourself a BTTF marathon. I'm used to doing them at least once if not twice a year.
There isn't a better storyline for the perfect time travel series,.....simply put, Back To The Future is groundbreaking enough that you can't tell an original story without making a reference to it. Steven Spielberg recently stated he wants to do a reboot??  That's one of the stupidest things I've heard in a long time, yet,......there's no competition with any other time travel film out there. Everyone agrees that when you talk time travel, someone is going to get this movie somewhere in the conversation.
Back To The Future is the top grossing film of 1985. If you visit IMDB, all the Goonie fans seem to disagree for some strange reason,........ I can't think of a better trilogy to keep passing on from generation to generation!!",1443744000,7,1366,4.644628099173554

7340913,5,B011Q0KET4,Back to the future is came out in 1985 and is still one of the best sci fi movie today. I mean down at the movie theater where i go on October 21 they have the 30 th anniversary marathon that is how popular this film trilogy is but now if you are a big time fan your going too want for your collection because it has the 3 films plus you get a bonus disc with 2 hours of extra bonus features plus you get a 64 page book of the the newest book that comes out the same day and for the first time you get the animation series on DVD. plus the package is the flux compasator that lights up,1442793600,4,585,3.7642276422764227
7340914,4,B011Q0KET4,This is my all-time favorite movie.  So I'm disappointed that we didn't get a special extended cut for the 30th Anniversary.  There's a treasure trove of deleted scenes that should be added to the film.,1441670400,8,202,4.742857142857143

7340920,5,B011Q0KET4,I've been a fan since 1985! I remember seeing this movie for the first time on a VHS tape when I turned 12 years old I remember it since that day that I've been a fan ever since I first saw those movies with the rest of the crew from Back To The Future thank you Michael J Fox. & Thank you for the memories Christopher Lloyd with the rest of the cast members to BTTF!,1437696000,8,367,3.8421052631578947
7340921,5,B011Q0KET4,"This is yet to be released so here is the latest update from internet.
 U get all 3 movies either in blu ray or in dvd version box set including 2 more hours of NEW EXTRAS which is one reason to buy this set if u are a fanatic BTTF fan.
 Another reason to buy this is cause u get for the first time and only in dvd format (either if u buy the dvd or the blu ray box set) the 1992 animated series of 26 episodes with also a bit of new extras plus u get an excerpt of the new book which is called the visual history of back to the future.
 Now this book is more than 200 pages but u get around 64 pages from that stuff IF U BUY THIS DVD OR THE BLU RAY BOX SET of this release.

 ALL IN ALL

 If u already own the 3 movies and u don't care about books and animations then skip this stuff.
 if u do care and u want to have them all then buy this set (dvd or blu ray) and u get except for the 3 movies TWO more hours of new extras plus the whole animated series for the first time (only in dvd) plus 64 pages from the new book called the visual BTTF history plus that collectable cover limited edition picture box set.

 So if u want to have them all this is the right deal but if u don't want to have books and stuff but only the movies and the animated series and u already own the movies u can also buy the animated series seperately but this way u won't have the new extras of the 3 movies and u don't get that limited edition set and u don't get the book.

 Myself i already own the 3 movies in dvd and in blu ray but nothing else so i will get this set to have also the animated series , the 3 movie's new extras, the 64 pages book and the new set edition cover art and i will also buy the new book seperately as it has 200 pages more than those offered in this set and in this way I WILL HAVE IT ALL.",1437523200,25,1802,3.7007874015748032

Also, I did not expect it, but he loved the cartoon series that is included as well. It was not to my taste, but between the two of us, we enjoyed everything this packaged offered. Speaking of the packaging, the light-up effects are a nice touch, and I will be proud to add this to my collection.
