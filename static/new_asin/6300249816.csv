285015,5,6300249816,"If you liked the Emma Thompson version, you will love this one too. Beautiful, sweeping, faithful to the book, great characters (especially Dan Stevens as Edward). I like that it is in 2 parts so the drama can unfold completely.",1520985600,,228,4.725
285016,5,6300249816,Happy with purchase...thank you!,1520208000,,32,7.25
285017,5,6300249816,"I am a long proclaimed Jane Austen fan.  So I am very picky about how well I like the film adaptions of her books.  Between this adaption of S & S and the one with Emma Thompson and Kate Winslet; I find that this adaption of S & S much better, moving at a slower pace.  At first I was REALLY iffy about this Col Brandon due to my love of Alan Rickman as Col. Brandon.  This man did pretty well I will say but I will always prefer Alan's Col.  However that is where my preference of the movie over the BBC mini series ends.  Charity does a beautiful job of bringing Marianne to life.  Hattie is a PERECT Elinor, and Dan Stevens is far, far better as Edward than Hugh Grant was.  His facial expressions alone trump Grant's whole character.  I also love Janet McTeer as Mrs. Dashwood; she is tall, stately, beautiful and still young looking for having beautiful girls.  I would definitely recommend this version over the other one.  But then I have always enjoyed the longer arcs of Austen's books.  I feel the same about P&P with Jennifer Ehle and Colin Firth.  I am probably one of the only people that I know of that absolutely HATED the Kiera Knightly version of P & P.  They spoke too fast, too low for me to follow.",1519862400,,1218,4.239130434782608

285054,1,6300249816,"It was a drag. Although Elinor did look the age, the actress' common modern manors and vernacular was extremely off putting. Dominique played a creepy Willoughby; there was nothing charming about him. He looked like he was FOS from scene 1.",1510358400,,240,4.878048780487805

285106,5,6300249816,As superb a production of Sense and Sensibility as Emma Thompson's.  They're both phenomenal.  MUST SEE IT.  BETTER TO OWN IT.  A terrific film to watch when you need a pick-me-up.  Can never watch it too many times.,1499126400,,216,4.578947368421052
285107,1,6300249816,"This version is a travesty that never should have seen the light of day. From the opening seduction scene (I thought maybe I had inadvertently rented the wrong movie) to the overtly displayed hostility between Colonel Brandon and Willoughby, it is NOT Jane Austen. If I wanted ""sexy"" I would watch 50 Shades. I had much higher expectations based on the reviews, but they must have been written by people who haven't read the book. This version captures none of the personality and entertainment of the writing, and I found I was thoroughly cranky and frustrated by the end of it. Yes, there was some beautiful scenery, and the last 5 minutes were good, but they did not make up for the utter nonsense in the rest of this thing.",1498867200,,727,4.6

285112,4,6300249816,"Irene Richards is charming as Elinor, fragile looking yet resilient.  (One always asks why such a strong woman fell for a man as weak as Edward Ferrars.) Donald Douglas is wonderful as Sir John (it's a great role for any actor).  Robert Swann makes a surprisingly good Colonel Brandon (Who knew? I had only seen him as Gerald Hadleigh in Midsomer Murders.). Bosco Hogan is adequate as Edward;  there isn't much chemistry between him and Richards, though one can only guess how Austen would have cast the role to produce it for TV.  The other characterizations are predictable. Willoughby, as usual, is totally hopeless.  And where, oh where, is Margaret??? But - a must-see for all Jane-ites.",1493337600,,692,4.880341880341881

285144,4,6300249816,Enjoyable and true to novel. Well casted. Saw Morrissey on Walking Dead so I was worried that would mar my perception of his performance as Brandon but his acting was spot on. Made me forget all about TWD and the Governor. The girls were casted perfectly. Willoughby could have been better.,1489708800,,290,4.705882352941177

285178,2,6300249816,"It's hard for me to give just one star to much of anything, but I admit this one was reeeaaally hard for me to watch. Being a huge fan of the novel and of the Emma Thompson version of this story, I found this one poorly if not painfully cast and the actress that played Elinor (IMHO) just couldn't carry the weight of this role. The lead was weak and Edward's character was just not true enough to description, which left the chemistry between them void. Sir John was so off balance that the combination of errors as a whole just didn't give this amazing (one of my favorites) story the credit deserved. It is also quite slow in pace, so very little flavor to add to the list of dry mismatches. All of this is purely subjective but I think just this once I'll have to deferr away from BBC to the Columbia Pictures, Emma Thompson version which is so well done it is in my opinion a hard to act to follow. My two cents.",1479772800,,917,4.186440677966102

285294,5,6300249816,"I have watched many Jane Austen series over the years, and I must say that this most recent BBC version of ""Sense and Sensibility"" is one of my favorites.
The actors are great, but I think what struck me the most was the setting. This movie perfectly captures the small seaside cottage that the Dashwoods are forced to inhabit. The turbulence of the sea against English cliffs mimics the struggles happening within the hearts of Elinor and Marianne. The setting is what makes this version stand out for me. Also, many adaptations seem to ""forget"" that the elder Dashwoods have a younger sister, this one does not.",1466726400,,613,4.738317757009346

285299,5,6300249816,"I very much enjoyed this.  I'm a huge fan of Sense and Sensibility and I love the Emma Thompson / Hugh Grant version and wasn't sure what to expect from this, but I loved the connection between Edward and Elinor.  I think they could have done better with their choice of Willoughby.  He was good looking, but not as charming and free spirited as the charming Greg Wise.

They did pretty well at finding actors who mimic the original looks and personality, but still added a bit more. I love that Margarete looks like the slightly older version, but alas she is a different actress.

The one thing I didn't care for was adding  a wife and kids to  Sir John Middleton.  She was dull and didn't add anything to the story line.  I also didn't like how they changed the conversation between Elinor and  Colonel Brandon regarding the actions of Willoughby and why he wasn't able to be with  Marianne.  It felt lacking when he didn't make mention of the fact that he believed that Willoughby had good intentions of marrying Marianne had it not been for his previous indiscretion and then had a sense later with  Willoughby  and Elinor about it, but it was lacking feeling or believably on Willoughby's part on his love for Marianne.",1465430400,,1225,4.559633027522936

285334,5,6300249816,"This lovely and poignant BBC film version touched me much more deeply than the movie of the same title starring Kate WInslet. The wild coastal setting used for humble Barton Cottage emphasizes dramatically the Dashwood women's brave transition from their former home, the resplendent Norland Park estate. And the actors portraying Edward Ferrars (Dan Stevens of Downton Abbey fame) and dashing John Willowby (Dominic Cooper) are just the hunkiest, and they lend much more sensual flavor and sexual tension than in other movie versions of Sense and Sensibility.",1463616000,,560,5.375
285335,3,6300249816,Didn't love the modernization on the relationships implied but never narrated in the book. It was a little to sexualized for a Jane Austen film.,1463184000,,144,4.8

285337,5,6300249816,"This is the 2008 version of S&S, which I love. I see no need to compare this with the brilliant version directed by Ang Lee and written by and starring Emma Thompson. It's perfectly fine to enjoy both!  They each provide different nuances and choose to focus on different moments or approach them in equally valid ways.  But..I have to say that I adore Alan Rickman as Colonel Brandon--I love him and only can see him in the role, way over the actor in this version, who was too sour and off-putting for my taste.  Otherwise, this is a stellar version with an amazing ensemble cast, equally as good I feel as the Ang Lee film.  I have seen both the original version of Morissey's 2008 S&S, as well as the slightly shorter version and enjoyed both.  I am not attached to the scenes that were shortened as I can't stand Lucy Steele's character, no matter who plays her! ;-)

Several reviewers I believe are incorrectly describing this as the 1981 version, which it is not.  I have no idea how the two could possibly be confused!  The 1981 version has the horrible, blurry video quality you'd expect from 1981 (see the picture of the old version). This 2008 miniseries is exquisitely filmed, sharp and high resolution with modern, gorgeous cinematography, what to speak of the acting, etc.",1462579200,,1286,4.609649122807017

(Though obviously if you don't ""need"" to steam this then possibly buying the DVD version that is complete with no ""cuts"" would be ideal - In my case I wanted to have it for my Kindle for long trips so)

Comparatively to the ""Emma Thompson"" version, I would consider this to be a more thorough reflection of the original story as where the ""Emma Thompson"" version was a shorter more to the point version. I found this to be equally well done and in some ways better since you get a better feel for the characters having more time to ""get to know"" them.

The music, the colors, the movement, costume and acting is so well done; there is a sense of control, holding of breadth throughout the series until the last moment when Elinor is asked by Edward for her hand in marriage.
I'm sure many of the other comments have said how lovely this series is, the telling of the story modern and I won't disagree. The only thing that I believe keeps the series from five stars is how lacking the male characters are in comparison to the perfect, emotion and portrayal put forth by the actresses (the only male actor I thought was un-lacking was Sir John).",1444694400,,675,4.495934959349594

Please know before you buy this instant video version that it has been chopped up so that it will fit into two episodes.  The original version which aired on BBC and PBS and which you can own on DVD has three episodes.  Wonderful dialogue from Mrs. Jennings has been cut in several areas, for example, and other moments are gone that give this version flow and balance.  If you enjoyed this on TV or DVD you will notice it immediately.  I suggest you buy the DVD version.  I am very disappointed that Amazon would offer this without advising that it has been shortened and changed.  And it's a shame that whoever owns the rights to this production would allow it to happen.  If they had not altered it, I would have given it five stars.

285558,5,6300249816,"SENSE AND SENSIBILITY
This latest adaptation of Sense and Sensibility [2007] is a fine version indeed, with lush cinematography, a beguiling score, and credible, above average performances by the cast in general. I find that each adaptation of Austen's novel has something special to offer, and this latest is no different. Adapted by Andrew Davies, this is a first rate adaptation that is bound to be a beloved adaptation, up there with Ang Lee's Sense and Sensibility [for which Emma Thompson received an Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay].

For those unfamiliar with the story - Sense and Sensibility revolves around two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who find themselves together with their mother and younger sister cast out of their family home, Norland, upon the death of Mr Henry Dashwood. As is the custom of the times, the estate passes on to his only son, John who is married to a real sly, snobbish, malicious woman, Fanny [ Claire Skinner in a truly wicked role].

Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars [Dan Stevens] comes to visit and forms a close friendship with Elinor [Hattie Morahan] to the chagrin of his sister who makes it plain to Mrs Dashwood that such an alliance would be beneath Edward's station.

The widow Dashwood and her daughters move to a little cottage let by a relative, Sir John Middleton, a kind yet gossipy man. Here, Marianne [Charity Wakefield] finds herself pursued by two men, the staid and noble Colonel Brandon [David Morissey] and the charming Romeo, Willoughby [Dominic Cooper]. Elinor and Marianne are two very different people, with Elinor being more in control of her emotions whereas Marianne is impulsive, utterly transparent in her emotions and wilful. The rest of the story deals with how these two sisters' romances play out.

This adaptation is beautifully filmed, and there are some highlight performances. Hattie Morahan's Elinor is not only credible in her role age-wise, but also very nuanced as the quiet sister who feels just as much but is not as revealing in her emotions as her younger sister Marianne. As for Marianne, Charity Wakefield makes for a sweet, and wilful Marianne, but I found her performance less compelling than Kate Winslet's luminous and passionate portrayal of Marianne.

David Morissey's Colonel Brandon is well done indeed, and though Alan Rickman's portrayal of the same role in the earlier version was wonderful, David Morissey's Brandon is no less compelling. Willoughby as played by Dominic Cooper didn't do anything for me - he just wasn't very credible, and at times came across as plain unpalatable, appearance-wise.

Dan Steven's Edward Ferrars is very charming [though in the book he is not really outstanding in appearance] and I liked his portrayal better than Hugh Grant's in the 1995 version - Dan Steven's makes an amiable Edward and his chemistry with Hattie Morahan's Elinor is more credible than the Thompson-Grant pairing. Another character that I though was very well-done was Lucy Boyd's Margaret Dashwood - she is so adorable and her comments are always spot on ""Women just sit around and wait for things to happen..."". I love her performance in this adaptation, and understand that she is also in Ballet Shoes a British production that also stars Emma Watson.

All in all, this is a well-made adaptation that stays as faithful as it can to Austen's novel, and is sure to attract fans of Jane Austen's novels as well as those who love period dramas. It is a quality show that is sure to please most Janeites.",1442880000,,3514,4.986348122866894

It's just Austin and her examination of the perils that threatened the survival and dignity of being a woman in the early 1800's.

285700,3,6300249816,"I'm a die hard Austen fan, and I try to watch ALL TV and movie adaptation. This 2008 production somehow escaped my radar, and I was curious to see what the writer, Andrew Davies, can come up with. Since Davies is  the famed writer of the mythical BBC adaptation for ""Pride and Prejudice"" and the man who is considered , by many, to be responsible for the huge surge in Austen's popularity over recent years , you might say I had high expectations. For the BBC to produce a mini series after The 1995 cinematic masterpiece, it had to have a little  something extra, something fresh and exciting that we haven't seen in that version.
I'm sorry to say it doesn't have it. It's true that being a 3 hrs mini series it follows the novel more closely and some people will appreciate that, but it lacks the charm  and the of the movie.
Even production value are only so so. Don't get me wrong - everything is done by the book with costumes and filming sites, but that's just it -It's as it should be and nothing more. We've seen this stuff already in other period dramas and it looked BETTER. Much Better. I was specifically disappointed with the outside scenery which is looking very gloomy and uninspiring instead of being visually striking and  setting the mood as it should be.

Casting and acting are the strong points of this production, and especially the  2 wonderful Young actresses who portray the Dashwood sisters. They look much more the age of Eleanor and Marianne than Kate Winslet and Emma Thompson did. Thompson was superb as Elinor but she looked like a 30 something spinster rather than the 19 years old young woman Eleanor is supposed to be.
Hattie Morahan who plays Eleanor is not exactly beautiful, but she is young, vibrant and attractive and this youth and vividness stand out as a sad contrast to how others see her and calculate her poor prospects of  ever finding a husband and being happy at her ""old"" age... Even the young ( 17 years old!!! ) Marianne is considered to be out of the game after her unfortunate attachment to Willoughby is widely known.
When you watch people who, by our standards, are considered to be very young with so much potential and choices ahead of them being judged  harshly by others and made to pay for each minuscule mistake, it makes you realise the harsh reality  Jane Austen and her contemporaries had to endure.  When they made a foolish youthful mistake or simply were not lucky enough to be born rich, they could spend the rest of their lives being shunned socially and unable to change their situation.  When the  the wedding bells ring by the end of the show you understand the ENORMOUS relief Eleanor, Marianne and their family must have felt...

To conclude - I did not fall in love with this production and  was somewhat disappointed, but it does have its merits.
If this is your very first encounter with Sense and sensibility, I highly recommend you start with the much more vivacious and moving 1995 Movie. If you are like me, and simply Cannot resist the urge to see another adaptation, It's not a bad way to spend a couple of evenings.

A note on the streaming version: It's a pity Amazon doesn't offer this mini series in HD, and you can watch it only on SD. It does make a big difference on a big screen TV :(",1438560000,,3275,4.508445945945946
285701,5,6300249816,"Let me preface this by saying that I have read the book, and have seen 2 other adaptations-- the 1981 mini, and the 1995 movie.

While I think this production fitting of 5 stars, there are a couple of things I didn't like:

**Semi Spoiler**: Mr. Davies took it upon himself to show the viewers in the opening seconds of the film- a glimpse of Willoughby in his ""Libertine"" ways (around 9-10 months prior to his Allenham visit). While background information in some films can be a great help, in this case I think it was a BIG mistake!!  In my opinion we lose the whole shock of finding it out along with Elinor and Marianne (much later in the book)!!

Who on earth picked Dominic Cooper as Willoughby?! ..Miss Austen describes him as ""uncommonly handsome.."" who possessed ""manly beauty and more than common gracefulness"".
I realize this is a personal opinion; and others might feel otherwise, but in my opinion Mr. Cooper possesses neither!
To the ""handsome"" part- he doesn't hold a candle to Greg Wise (Willoughby '95), nor to the Edward Ferrars (Dan Stevens) in the new version! I have to say, that for me- their eyes are one of the first things I notice- and his eyes in no way entice me!! Ironically, Mr. Davies steals Mr. Darcy's ""fine eyes"" line (from Pride & Prejudice) and inserts this as one of Marianne's lines (after her 1st encounter with Willoughby).
As for the ""more than the common gracefulness"" bit- Was it just me or did the poor chap look like he was about to have a hernia lifting Marianne?! (the grunt and gasp when he put her down didn't help either). I'm NOT implying that the actress that played Marianne was overweight; just that he's not a tall strapping fellow that can pick any woman up with ease. Which is what one would expect Mr. Willoughby to be! (An excerpt from the San Francisco Chronicle/ SFGate article entitled ""PBS airs adaptations, old and new, of all Jane Austen's novels"" states the following: 'Dominic Cooper recalled the hash he made initially of one of the novel's most romantic moments -- when his character, the ""uncommonly handsome"" Willoughby, rescues Marianne Dashwood after she slips and twists her ankle running down a hill. The torrential rain ""did make it quite difficult picking her up from a 90-degree angle on a wet, greasy, green hill and turning back to walk up the hill with a very long, wet coat on,"" Cooper recalls. ""When I kind of squatted down, the jacket got caught. I fell over immediately and put her head in a ditch."")
Finally, nothing about his acting or portrayal excited me. Greg Wise will always be the perfect Willoughby to me!

While Kate Winslet remains my favorite Marianne, Miss Wakefield does her character justice.
While this version doesn't have the comedic relief that the '95 had (specifically in connection to Sir John Middleton and Mrs. Jennings), this version does adhere to the book in that Sir John wasn't a widower.
I quite like the new Edward Ferrars (played by Dan Stevens), more so than Hugh Grant.
This Col. Brandon is more of a convincing 35 yr. old than Alan Rickman was.  But his portrayal really didn't stand out more than Alan Rickman's.
Elinor is also much more of a convincing 20 yr. old than Emma Thompson  (and I have to say, there are times when she sounds a lot like Emma too)!  But if I had to choose between a favorite Elinor, Hattie Moran would be it!
I also like the new Mrs. Dashwood (Janet McTeer; she played lead actress in ""The Black Velvet Gown"").

Thankfully Mr. Davies included in this version an important scene from the book that the '95 one omitted!  (**Spoiler Alert**: Willoughby's attempt at redemption: The conversation between Willoughby and Elinor just after he married.) He (Davies) also made a point to include the rest of the (smaller) characters in the book which the '95 left out. (**Spoiler** And to bring to life a subtle mention of a dual between Col. Brandon and Willoughby. Although it has been said that it most likely would have been a pistol draw rather than a sword fight. ...It reminded me a bit of P&P '95, in which they show Mr. Darcy working out his frustration of rejection by fencing. And I do believe that in Northanger Abbey '07 there's a dream sequence in which Miss Morland's two suitors are dueling it out with swords. I guess Mr. Davies loves sword fighting!)

Of the latest Jane Austen adaptations (Persuasion, Northanger Abbey, and Mansfield Park)- Sense & Sensibility is the best out of the four! Maybe because this version is 3 hrs., whereas, the other three were 1 hr. 20 min. Or maybe due to the fact that Mr. Davies has more experience in the adaptation/reproduction department (FYI: He's the script writer for other Jane Austen works: Pride & Prejudice '95 BBC miniseries, Emma  '96 BBC movie, and Northanger Abbey '07).

In conclusion, I definitely think this miniseries does the book justice; and I heartily recommend it to anyone who loves period dramas, or who are fans of Miss Austen!",1438387200,,4945,4.683179723502304

Andrew Davies always delivers a solid script - the actors likewise deliver solid performances.  I was actually glad to be rid of Kate Blanchett's weepy interpretation and felt this more subtle work suited the book's intention.  Also, it is always an advantage to tell these complicated stories through a series format rather than a single film.  The complexities of the novels require attention to details that often get overlooked otherwise.  Not so in this case.

I also love the Emma Thompson version, and have watched that more times than I can count. I do think that Greg Wise made a far better and more charming Willoughby than Dominic Cooper, who looks just a bit too evil at times here, and the comical portrayal of Mrs. Jennings and her silly daughter with the cranky husband was perhaps clearer in the older movie. But I think nearly everyone cast in the Ang Lee version was at least 15 years too old for their roles. I adore Emma Thompson, but... Elinor is supposed to be 19! Their mother about 45! Everyone in this adaptation looks their age, and Hattie Morahan's portrayal of Elinor was so nuanced and well done. The part where she's correcting Marianne about the depth of her feelings for Edward always moves me to tears. And the portrayal of Anne Steele (a character excised in the older movie) was hilarious.

The starting is slightly racy. As it shows unbuttoned back of a dress but no nudity or sex. Most people know the story and will immediately know what that is about. It only goes through the credits. Their kiss scenes are a bit more for those times as well but it was know that Maryanne didn't use common sense but her heart to guide her. I still would not say it's G but PG as it is a bit more adult geared but I would allow my daughter to watch it even with the kissing in it. It's a beautiful story and closest to the book out of all the movies I've bought or scene. I just got it yesterday from Amazon.

285753,5,6300249816,"Of all the adaptations of Jane Austen immortal stories, I think this is the finest.

Yes I know... both of the most recent Pride and Prejudice movies were in their own way very fine and the most recent Emma 2009 with Romola Garai is very close to my praise here maybe even equal... but... what is different about this adaptation is that one feels that the real life of the early dawning of the 19th century... really late 18th century life... is captured with accuracy and without that retrojection of feminist dogma that mares a few Jane Austen adaptations, that are in all other respects... well done.

The music is emotive of what has become a kind of eternal story, one feels in it the sadness of a time past forever.

It sounds as though the author of that music was saying: ""nobility of spirit is gone but here it lives in this story and these people's lives whom we love and in a kine of living  that humanity will never know again. ""

The cast here is perfect... with both Colonel Brandon and the youngest sister cast especially well as well as their mother who too is wonderful... but it is Hattie Morahan's innate dignity... that so matches the character of Elinor, her understated simple beauty, her very deep sounding (at times)  mature voice that holds the family together... and the joy in her eyes and wonder and love as well as a rueful knowing smile beyond her character's years... that makes this rendition of Sense and Sensibility wonderful;  she brings to life Elinor, who is another image of Jane herself or at least her ideal of herself.

One senses the real Jane Austen in Elinor in Hattie Morahan and I can not recommend it more highly than that.",1436832000,,1670,4.543333333333333

The women must have had William Shatner as their acting coach....i haven't seen this much overacting in a long while, and i certainly did not expect to see it in a BBC production. The portrayal of the Dashwood sisters couldn't be further off the mark, the love and intimacy between the two sisters is completely lost in this production. In the book, although Marianne was  a bit of a ""know it all""  she was very likeable, in this production she comes across as insolent and bratty. Irene Henry's portrayal of Elinor is very dull and listless, her performance is so subdued that she manages to stifle the very attributes that endear us to Elinor....her practical nature,grace, intelligence, inner strength and sensibleness.

As sisters, Marianne and Elinor provide balance for one another. They help each other see what is true and important - Marianne to become more realistic in her expectations and Elinor to allow herself to love and be loved.

This adaptation is very faithful to the book. You will come to know all the characters well and feel fully satisfied when the mini-series comes to an end.

Other made for TV shows, such as Cranford (granted, more contemporary than this 1981 version), don't appear to be so poorly made.

Elinor is too cheerful, the costumes are drab and repetitive, the dialogue is true to the book but badly performed, and the actors and actresses show no passion for their job.  Except for the actress playing Marianne, who cries with such wholehearted abandon that it's a little over the top.

285934,4,6300249816,"Jane Austen's romantic story of sisterly bonds is beautifully-told in this 7-part 1981 BBC miniseries.  Following the death of her husband, Mrs Dashwood (Diana Fairfax) is forced to leave the comfort of the Norland Estate, the family's home for generations.  Together with daughters Elinor (Irene Richard) and Marianne (Tracey Childs), they take over the lease of a small cottage on the estate of distant relation Sir John Middleton (Donald Douglas).  What starts out for Marianne as a dull new life in lesser surroundings becomes a romantic dreamland when she meets and falls hopelessly in love with John Willoughby (Peter Woodward), a handsome but reckless playboy.

Elinor, in the meanwhile, keeps her feelings contained and barely lets on that she harbours a breaking heart concerning her friendship with the shy Edward Ferrars (Bosco Hogan).  When Elinor and Marianne are invited to spend the 'Season' in London with Mrs Jennings (Annie Leon), it sets the stage for a series of shattering revelations regarding each other's romantic dream.  In a time when money and property govern all, can the girls learn to find a harmonic balance between sense and sensibility?

This version, scripted by Alexander Baron, takes as it's source the BBC's earlier&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/1971-miniseries/dp/B002DY9KR0/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">1971 miniseries</a>&nbsp;(Denis Constanduros gets a screen credit).  Just like the 1971 version, events in the story are streamlined, and several minor characters are eliminated (eg: the youngest Dashwood sister Margaret).  The performances from the two leading ladies are more than acceptable.  Irene Richard (who had, in the previous year, played a lovely Charlotte Lucas for the BBC's excellent 1980&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Pride-and-Prejudice/dp/B000244FDW/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Pride and Prejudice)</a>&nbsp;does well at conveying the quiet and insular personality of Elinor - many here have written that Ms Richard is almost too cold in the part but I saw no evidence of that.  Tracey Childs nicely counterbalances as the romantic, strong-willed Marianne but wisely steps on the brake when the character threatens to spiral into melodramatic mode.

The casting of the men, I think, is more problematic in my eyes.  Wonderful actors as they no doubt are, I cannot begin to envision either Bosco Hogan (as Edward) or Peter Woodward (as Willoughby) in their respective roles.  They simply don't work for me.  Much better was the BBC's 1971 casting (future&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Poldark/dp/B005X5XIMO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Poldark</a>&nbsp;co-stars Robin Ellis and Clive Francis).  The other members of the cast, however, are truly first-rate, including a most memorable Amanda Boxer as Fanny Dashwood, Julia Chambers as Lucy Steele and Pippa Sparkes as her sister Ann.

Each of the 7 episodes runs for just under 30 minutes, so you can follow the story at your leisure (or watch the entire thing in one sitting - very easily done).  If you love classic period drama you'll adore this solid SENSE AND SENSIBILITY.",1346803200,,3214,5.965141612200436

285967,2,6300249816,"Being as I love this story, and have watched the other two adaptations, I thought I'd give this earlier adaptation a look.
Aside from my love for period drama, particularly when it comes to Jane Austen; unfortunately the only thing that kept me watching was finding amusement in the actors portrayals of their characters! The acting in my opinion, is a far cry from the '95 & '07-- ranging from very dry/emotionless, to the over-dramatic.

**SPOILER ALERT**

""Marianne"" was convincing in her part.  Her acting is reminiscent of an actress of the 50's--in her vocal tone/expressions.  While it isn't my favorite portrayal of the character (Kate Winslet is), she at least possessed a certain depth of feeling in her acting- which is more than I can say for her sister!
""Elinor"" is simply a bore (it's as if she's on some sort of a sedative).  At certain points she barely moves her lips, and sadly lacks any emotional range when expressing her lines 95% of the time.  She says her lines, but you don't see connection to her character (fortunately the '95, and '07 portrayals make up for it)!

""Edward"" likewise, is uninspiring in his acting, and very unconvincing as a man in his mid 20's (more like 40's).
""Willoughby"" didn't have a whole lot of scenes or many lines, but his acting was the best out of the men (and the better looking- in my opinion).
""Col. Brandon"" also did a fair job on the whole, and he looked about the right age too.

""Fanny"" was doing a pretty good job until she had her meltdown (she would have been fantastic in an Alfred Hitchcock film)!
""Miss Lucy Steele"" is an extremely jealous, possessive, opportunistic social climber.  She definitely rivals Fanny as being the most unlikeable of the female roles!
As for ""Mrs. Jennings"" sometimes her facial (eye) expressions, and mannerisms (head cocking) were most distracting; I much prefer the 95's character!

The one thing I will say about this version, in it's favor, is that it does a pretty good job with keeping to the book (especially in showing the whole Willoughby/Elinor conversation), aside from omitting Margaret, and shortening the acquaintanceship with Willoughby & the Dashwoods.

Really, you're better off reading the book first, and then watching the '95 or '07 adaptations.",1332720000,,2260,4.859375

285969,4,6300249816,"Sense and Sensibility is my favorite Austen novel after Pride and Prejudice because I love the dynamics in the relationship between Elinor Dashwood and her younger sister Marianne. For those unfamiliar with the story - Sense and Sensibility revolves around two sisters, Elinor and Marianne Dashwood, who find themselves together with their mother cast out of their family home, Norland, upon the death of Mr Henry Dashwood. As is the custom of the times, the estate passes on to his only son, John who is married to a real sly, snobbish, malicious woman, Fanny.

Fanny's brother Edward Ferrars comes to visit and forms a close friendship with Elinor to the chagrin of his sister who makes it plain to Mrs Dashwood that such an alliance would be beneath Edward's station.

The widow Dashwood and her daughters move to a little cottage let by a relative, Sir John Middleton, a kind yet gossipy man. Here, Marianne finds herself pursued by two men, the staid and noble Colonel Brandon and the charming Romeo. Elinor and Marianne are two very different people, with Elinor being more in control of her emotions whereas Marianne is impulsive, utterly transparent in her emotions and wilful. The rest of the story deals with how these two sisters' romances play out.

My favorite adaptations of Austen's Sense and Sensibility are:

This 1981 adaptation stays mostly faithful to Austen's novel, with one glaring exception. They left out the youngest daughter Margaret in this production, an oversight that luckily does not affect the story much, but the omission is rather perplexing. The production's other flaw is the dated production values which makes the show look its age. If viewers can get past these flaws, then I think it is worth watching especially for devoted Austen fans and those who like to compare screen adaptations of Austen's works.

Irene Richard plays a credible, plain looking, staid Elinor and Tracey Childs is well-cast as the impulsive, passionate Marianne, whose heart rules her emotions. Bosco Hogan is an unappealing Edward Ferrars, though I did like Robert Swann's portrayal as the loyal Colonel Brandon, and Peter Woodward as the rakish John Willoughby.

At seven episodes long, running about 26 mins each, the show includes a lot more storyline and dialogue from Austen's novel which makes it a good reason to watch. The episodes are free via streaming for Prime members, and pay per episode for others. The quality of the streaming is relatively good.",1320537600,,3113,6.0636363636363635
285970,4,6300249816,"This 1981 BBC version of Jane Austen's romance novel ""Sense and Sensibility"" has the virtue of being a generally faithful adaptation and the misfortune of comparisions with the first rate casting and splashier production values of Emma Thompson's 1995 movie version.  At 174 minutes, this BBC production includes most of the original novel and even adds a little to the plot.

As the story opens, the Dashwood sisters, Elinor and Marianne, with their recently widowed mother, have been bounced out of their country home by an older brother and his selfish wife.  The Dashwoods take up residence at a rustic cottage, where their friendly neighbors take them to heart.  The older and sensible sister, Elinor, will fall in love with a quiet but amiable man, who is however secretly engaged to another woman.  The passionate and emotional Marianne will fall violently in love with Willoughby, the local rake.

Each of the sisters will have their own difficulty path to maturity and love, and much of the strength of the story in their contrasting styles and the consequences they must suffer.  Irene Richards and Tracey Childs are well cast as Elinor and Marianne.  The pacing of the production allows us to share their emotional development, including Marianne's tentative interest in another suitor at production's end.

Margaret was cut yet again but other than that it followed the book more closely than 1971. It lacked all the wacky 70s costumes and hairstyles that made the earlier one so crazy and seemed much more understated to me.

I won't spoil it for you-but it's quite clear that the 1995 version missed one of the most important portions of Austen's tale of love lost and found.

After reading reviews on this version about how it was vastly superior to all the others, and it was so much more faithful, I was very excited.  But this BBC version is just difficult to sit through.

As others have said, Tracy Childs (Marianne), Irene Richards (Elinor), and Bosco Hogan (Edward) are thoroughly bad actors.  The dynamic romance between Marianne and Willoughby is subdued and I don't see what at all is dashing about Peter Woodward as Willoughby.  Marianne's supposed passion for life becomes juvenile whiny teenaged angst (she might have been the one to inspire the current emo trend), while Irene Richards's Elinor seems to be reading from a teleprompter.  Even her smiles are unconvincing, being rather watery and disconnected.  I am not sure if it is that she is trying too hard, or not trying hard enough, but she certainly is not an appealing Elinor.

The little chemistry that appears in this film centres around the few actors whom I appreciate.  Diana Fairfax was wonderful as Mrs. Dashwood, and I quite liked Amanda Boxer's portrayal as Fanny--very well done.

Despite the apparently truthful dialogue, I found it lackluster and without wit or imagination.

As others have said, the set and lighting are less than desirable, but that is excusable considering budget constraints.  But it should not be so difficult to find good actors when so many are in want of good roles!  All-in-all, this film may (on paper) be more true to Jane Austen's literal written word, but as others have said, the spirit is lost.

Donald Douglas was a ridiculous caricature as Sir John Middleton.  Irene Richard's performance as Elinor Dashwood was uneven, varying from good to overwrought.  The direction was poor, and the writing was below par.
There were a few worthwhile performances.  Diana Fairfax was a spirited Mrs. Dashwood, and Annie Leon found the right tone for Mrs. Jennings.  Amanda Boxer made a superb Fanny Dashwood.  It is a shame they did not find a better vehicle to support their effort.",1210464000,,790,5.15748031496063
286008,4,6300249816,"Many commentators have duly chastised this 1981 BBC production for being less a film than merely a filmed book, and consequently clumsy in chosen images, while also dull in pacing and rhythm. What works on the written page clearly does not always transfer successfully unless suitable adjustments have been made to the requirements of a different medium. I'd agree that this version of Austen's novel is ultimately one better listened to than watched. At the same time, it has merits lacking in both the Emma Thompson and more recent Andrew Davies versions. Both of these last, for my money, were far too amiable in their vision, so that Jane Austen tends to emerge in them as a gentle-hearted chronicler of Regency order rather than a shrewd, even lethal social satirist.

No less a worthy than E.M.Forster is on record as saying Austen showed him the possibilities of deadly domestic humor. And indeed in ""Sense and Sensibility"" the bores and mean-spirited types among the country gentry are captured for all time, like insects in amber. This adaptation of the novel is truer than others to Austen's insights here. Dinner parties and card-playing scenes are punctuated by superlatively stupid or just plain snobbish comments from the due recipients of Austen's irony. And Lucy Steele, for instance, emerges not as a potentially sympathetic fiancee of Edward's, but as in the novel a pretty mean inquisitor who adds to Elinor's private sufferings.

The final encounter of Willoughby and Elinor is included here, as in the
Davies version, but the dialogue in this version is truer to the complex moral response of the novel. In Davies, Willoughby remains pretty much just a nasty fellow to a suddenly one-dimensional, priggish Elinor and an unnecessarily appearing Marianne. The Thompson and Davies versions, of course, have their merits, and as films clearly surpass this production in technical aspects. Still, short of rereading the novel, Austen's readers can gain much from this version.",1208131200,,1992,5.145061728395062

Because there is more time, this adaptation gives more room to many of the circumstances that help define the characters' characters. Yet it is not entirely faithful to the book. The little sister is not even included, but her absence does not detract from the story.
I like this version much better than the movie, even though I do like the movie, I just like this version better.
People who have not read the book might find this somewhat boring though. I say might because I had practically memorized the book when I saw it so I don't know how someone who hasn't read the book would respond.

The positives.........aside from the assassination of Margaret Dashwood before the first rehearsal of the script, it stays faithful to the book, which for all us Austen fans is a relief. Clothing was good, sets acceptable, script not bad and thats where is ends.

From there on the cast in their attempt to wring every drip of ""good performance and portrayal"" have manged to make it a cross between a pantomine and  the local amatuer players spoof.

Elinor Dashwood is so reserved and ""sensible' that she looks emotionally constipated and needs a fire hose enema to get any movement out of her.

Marianne Dashwood in her attempt to be passionate  behaves like a manic depressive drag queen with an with a throat infection and an accent that sounds as if she went too far rehearsing with marbles in her mouth.

Mrs Dashwood appears to take too much Valium whilst the love enduring Captain Brandon really does look like a lecherous old man hankering after a teenager......... well actually he was

Mrs Jennings has a thyroid condition,has taken speed and sniffed too much helium.  Her daughter Charlotte need serious pychiatric help form her psychosis as she appears to be responsing to voices inside and outside of her head.

The makeup award doesn go the the artist who gave the very sick Margaret the appearance of looking possessed by the devil and good rival for Linda Blair in the Exorcist and Edward Ferris for he comb over.

286012,3,6300249816,"I really tried to like this production. The first episode seemed promising, but it slowly declined.

It was very nice seeing the details of the story which were left out in Ang Lee's production (except for the total exclusion of the youngest sister Margaret, who i very much missed!), but this extra length did not create any closeness to the characters. I could not feel any real affections between characters, and in some cases our heroine Elinor actually came off as a snob, and lovely Marianne as a brat. The supporting cast was just as distant. By the third episode I really wasn't caring how things turned out.

I understand the limitations of low-budget productions, but the lack of fine lighting, lovely scenery, etc. can be forgotten when there is an excellent script and top-notch acting. Unfortunately, the acting is terrible: stilted, stiff, and uneven - at times I found moments of overacting and underacting which were comical. The end was anticlimactic and extremely disappointing.

Sorry to say it, but there it is. I give it 3 stars for the effort, detail, and length. It is tolerable if you are a Jane Austen fan, or fan of period pieces.",1184371200,,1156,4.798994974874372
286013,2,6300249816,"Staged sets and no personality breaks believability, in this earlier, 1981 version. Compared to ""Pride & Prejudice""-2006, 1996, & 1940 all at 5-stars; and the Emma Thompson version-1995, at 4-stars.

This film should be used in a film school, to show what happens when: no additional lighting is used outdoors = (shadows on the actors faces), no boom-mike = (distracting noises), ill-plotted camera-angles = (the camera comes into the viewer's mind), and no transitions, indoor to outdoor, or room to room, and staged-sets = (does not take you there).

So, they had a low budget. If you view it as a college play, do not mind ""reserved"", and ""slow"", and are a big Jane Austen fan, you may enjoy it. I recommend instead, ""Middlemarch"", skipping the first episode; and ""Maytime"", watch first 5-minutes, skip 10-minutes, then the movie takes off.",1175731200,,843,5.014285714285714
286014,4,6300249816,"I have read all the pervious amazon reviews about BBC's S&S miniseries, but they were mixed, so I did not know what to expect from the production as a whole. However, I was most pleasantly surprised, for I found it lovely.

There's no denying it that compared to the outstanding Emma Thompson movie the miniseries seems much more sedate and restrained -with less passion grande and display of tormented feelings-, it's like a theatre play really, but somehow it did not diminish it in my eyes. Given the length it was more leisurely, more faithful to the plot of the book.

I found the cast excellent: Irene Richard as Elinor and Tracey Childs as Marianne played their parts excellently. Diana Fairfax was a warm-hearted and ladylike Mrs Dashwood, Amanda Boxer was an excellent Fanny Dashwood: so cold-hearted, sneering and mean-spirited that you just wanted to slap her in the face really hard whenever she appeared on scene. Peter Gayle as John Dashwood also acted his part as the mean but jovial husband totally under his wife's influence. Peter Woodward (Willoughby) was dashing, Bosco Hogan (Edward) and Robert Swann (colonel Brandon) as the sisters suitors I found endearing. The Steele sisters were vulgar and shrewd, Mrs Jennings was vulgar, but kind-hearted. Characterization was superb through and through.

There were reviewers who found Irene R's Elinor too cold, but I did not have that feeling - it was rather that the scenes focusing on her feelings were just too short, we  were not given the chance to see her suffer.

There is one thing however that disturbed me very much - the very sudden and abrupt ending. I couldn't help feeling cheated of the happy ending. Before I could start to enjoy the fact that all will turn out well, cut ... and over. This is why I don't give it 5 stars.

If you take my advice, try and enjoy this production for its own merits without comparing it to the movie - because they are two different worlds.",1151971200,,1951,4.757396449704142
286045,4,6300249816,"Rodney Bennett's 1981 BBC adaptation of ""Sense and Sensibility,"" the glorious romance of mores and manners, set during England's Regency Period, lacks verve, pizzazz, vitality. However, except for the mysterious absence of young Margaret Dashwood, it is quite faithful to Jane Austen's brilliant novel.

Comparisons to Ang Lee's Award-winning film version, with screenplay by Emma Thompson, is inevitable - but is like comparing apples and oranges, although both are based on Ms. Austen's first published novel. And ""there is the rub."" Bennett's film cannot compare in the polished final production, gorgeous locations and beautiful period costumes department - assets which a small budget cannot bestow upon a movie, especially one made for TV. However, many of the performances here are excellent, especially those of the Dashwood sisters, Willoughby, Edward Ferrars and Lucy Steele.

A Lovely Tracey Childs plays Marianne Dashwood to perfection. Marianne is a passionate young woman, with a definite inclination toward the humanities: art, music and literature. Her heart rules her head, more often than not, and she has a very spontaneous nature. Irene Richard gives a strong performance as Elinor Dashwood, the older of the two sisters. She has a more practical, sensible temperament. While Elinor appreciates the music and literature that her sibling so passionately loves, she definitely thinks things through before making decisions, or taking action, and keeps her personal feelings to herself. She feels tremendous responsibility for her family's well-being. Marianne believes that Elinor, whom she loves, is too cold, and subdued - more concerned with propriety than with feelings. Elinor, on the other hand, is concerned about Marianne's open and guileless behavior. She fears her sister will be hurt by indulging in her strong emotions, and that conventional society will condemn her for this attribute. There is much reserve between the sisters, and the obvious mutual affection I have come to expect, from the novel and Mr. Lee's film, is restrained.

The deceased Mr. Dashwood, father of Elinor and Marianne, had pleaded with his son and heir, (Peter Gale), from a previous marriage, to please take care of his wife and daughters after his death. The spineless John Dashwood sincerely promises to do so, and then is persuaded not to by his greedy wife, Fanny, (Amanda Boxer). Before the Dashwood women are forced to leave their home, the Norwood estate, they meet Fanny's brother, the shy and kind Edward Ferrars, (Bosco Hogan - Warning! Superficial comment ahead! Hogan may be closer to Ms. Austen's description of Edward, but he's nowhere near as much fun to look at as Hugh Grant!). Over a period of a few weeks, while the women are packing their belongings, Elinor and Edward grow obviously fond of each other. But Fanny encourages them to expedite their leave taking.

Upon arriving at their new residence, Barton Cottage, near the estate of Mrs. Dashwood's cousin John, the women meet their relatives and some new neighbors. Colonel Brandon, (Robert Swann), is included in the welcome party. It is difficult for me to imagine anyone else in the role of Colonel Brandon except the charismatic Alan Rickman. However, even had I not seen Rickman's performance, I must say there is little chemistry between this Brandon and Marianne. Of course he is drawn at once to the beautiful, musical young woman, who does not reciprocate his affection. Instead she falls madly in love with the dashing, feckless Willoughby, (Peter Woodward).

The family settles in and explores their surroundings. Elinor waits in vain for Edward to visit her at Barton Cottage. Willoughby's expected marriage proposal to Marianne is unexpectedly interrupted. Two unhappy sisters travel to London for the season, hoping to settle their romantic affairs, and instead, find their dreams thwarted.

I won't give the story away, but it is a tale well told, all in all. I do recommend this version, especially to fans of Jane Austen. It is true to the novel and entertaining. Unfortunately it suffers in comparison to Ang Lee's later production - but that does not mean it lacks merit on its own.

286046,3,6300249816,"This 1981 BBC version of Jane Austen's ""Sense and Sensibility"" presents a mixed bag for both those who adored the novel and those who were delighted in the 1995 screen adaptation.  In terms of fidelity to the book, the seven-part mini-series has more time to devote to the Dashwood sister, helped in part by the fact there are not just two of them since Alexander Baron's screenplay (based on Denis Constanduros' outline), eliminates young Margaret.  Now Edward Ferrers comes to Barton Cottage, Mrs. Jennings is around to minister to Marianne during her illness, and Willoughby tries to visit her during that time as well.  So much more of the novel, as well as much more of Austen's original language, is to be found, although I find the dynamic of the Dashwood family to be quite different without young Margaret trying to figure out which older sister to emulate.

However, if there is such a thing as being too reserved in a BBC costume drama, this production directed by Rodney Bennett would be it.  I watched the 1998 BBC production of ""Vanity Fair"" and found it emotionally distant, only to discover that this version of ""Sense and Sensibility"" has managed to slip into an even lower gear.  Granted, I am admittedly a weeper, and there are several choice moments in the Ang Lee film that I still find affective a decade later.  But in this production there is a remarkable lack of chemistry.  I know that Elinor (Irene Richard) and Edward Ferrars (Bosco Hogan) are smitten with each other, but I never really believe it.  The opening credits such Elinor and Marianne (Tracey Childs) are bound to each other, but except for a few brief moments when one defends the other to someone outside the immediate family, I find little to suggest there is any real affection.  Austen's words are there, but not the heart of the story that Emma Thompson brought out so well in her Oscar winning screenplay, which is why this version never connects with me.

The story will be well known to most who take the time to watch this mini-series.  Elinor is the sensible one while her younger sister is the incurable romantic who wants what little sense she has to be overwhelmed by love.  It is clear that Austen sides with Elinor's view of the world, but as much as she satirizes Marianne's flights of deep feeling there is supposed to be a compassion towards the character because we are constantly invited to see her through Elinor's eyes.  However, Elinor's love seems thwarted when it becomes clear not only that Edward's mother has another match in mind and the man she loves has apparently given his promise to another.  Meanwhile, Marianne, who insists that the stalwart Colonel Brandon (Robert Swann) is old, literally stumbles upon her ideal in John Willoughby (Peter Woodward), and lost in her feelings her actions are close to scandalous.  Then Willoughby abandons her and the question is which Dashwood sister is deeper in the depths of despair.

The test of character for Elinor and Marianne is how they respond to their romantic misfortunes, and it is not surprising that each responds in kind given their distinctive temperaments.  By the time we get to the requisite happy ending Austen's point about the proper balance between sense and sensibility has been made (Elinor is too sedate for her own good, but that hardly seems as grievous a fault as Marianne's dramatic excesses).  Yet for all of their suffering in this tale, the happy endings seem rather tacked on and many viewers have been surprised given the length of the production that the ending is so abrupt.  That was the last straw and resulted in my decision to round down on the rating for this one, and explains why my final thought is that I am even more impressed with Thompson's adaptation of Austen's novel that I was before I started watching this version.",1111104000,,3831,4.775757575757575

The language sounded either lifeless, as if the actors were just reading aloud from a script, or completely overdone and unnatural. The sets looked like stage decorations and the actors stiff and uncomfortable. As a matter of fact, the whole film seemed more like a theatre play than a movie. The screenplay of Ang Lee's version might take some liberties with the book, but at least the characters are lively and credible!

The worst letdown was the end after Episode 8, though: Marianne batting her eyelashes at the Colonel, remarking that she would have to ask him lots of questions - and her mother commenting ""Children"". And that was all! Am I missing a DVD??",1098921600,,810,4.6573426573426575

This version is wonderful because the great writers knew that character and character almost by itself makes literature and film, for that matter.  It takes time to reveal character and
Jane Austen's characters are worth the effort.  I remarked to my spouse that the BBC version had time to reveal less important characters like Mrs. Dashwood and the dastardly Dashwoods as well. There was time to reveal Willoughby and those wonderful dialogues between he and Marianne.  There was time to feature the heated conversations between the sisters Dashwood.  The casting for this movie was wonderful, and I anxiously await other productions with this excellent cast!  There was time, too, for the camera to grasp the landscape and the environs for the viewer and they did it lovingly.  Nowhere in this film was the action of the literary work abbreviated.
