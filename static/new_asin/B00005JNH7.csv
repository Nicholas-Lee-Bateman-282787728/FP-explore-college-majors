***  The three prism adventure with Stefano

***  The Miami adventure (at the Orange bowl, Vizcaya and South Beach)

***  The Dragon adventure (including their wedding in England)

The Bradys- Bo and Hope, Kim and Shane, Kayla and Patch ( Steve)

Roman and Marlena and their kids

John and Marlena and their kids

The Evil Doings of Stephano DiMera

The Best of Sami's Shenanigans

Also- how about all of those big anniversary specials? 25th, 25th and the upcoming 40th would be great. I have my tapes with these and they are getting pretty worn.

They are the show. The show began in 1965 and was so good with Alice Horton character. She always gave good acting in every scene she was in. The fans always enjoyed the Horton family Christmas episodes and Alice and the episodes where Alice pretended to be Big Sal looking for info to clear her husband Tom Horton of a crime he didn't do with the private detective Howie. Alice would do comedy and drama and Frances Reid played the role so good that she was like a member of the family to her fans. We all miss Frances Reid and her role of Alice. The show is not the same without her in the show. She was the reason to watch the show. Eileen Davidson's character of Kristen DiMera is the show's best villian who you feel sorry for although her character is mean mean mean and she is troubled though she cares about children and she shows a kindness and shows she wants to be a good person and just have a family and be happy though she goes about the wrong way and schemes. Eileen Davidson won the Emmy award in 2014 because of her acting. Louise Sorel in the role of Vivian Alamain,Suzanne Rogers in the role of Maggie Horton are good in the show also Doug and Julie and Marie Horton are all liked also.

Or how about to make up for the TRAVESTY of ending Deidre Hall's contract to do ""The Marlena Evans Story"" on DVD.  They could also do ""Christmas in Salem"" and do the various tender scenes (Roman sneaking into the hospital dressed as Santa to see Carrie, the Horton Christmas ornament ceremonies.

I TiVo it daily and I don't miss an episode. It's a family tradition like birthday dinners, road trips to Mexico, and political activism. It's engrained in my family's DNA. And while my husband and son deny watching, they're quick to point out when they sees Days characters elsewhere (""Hey, isn't that Sammy on that diet show?"" or ""Hey Mom, Lucas is on Family Fued."").

I expect that, for most Days watchers, it's about the same. This loyal bunch would be willing to pay for a ""collectors"" edition - whether it's the entire library (my preference) or a ""best of"" as some earlier reviewers have suggested.

If they combined them into boxed sets and released another set every few months at a fair price, I think that there is a good chance to make a lot of sales.  There are many older storylines talked about even today that I was too young to have seen that would be wonderful to get to watch.  They could even shorten them further by eliminating unnecessary footage.",1152489600,,574,4.181818181818182
1529159,5,B00005JNH7,"I am a fan of `Days of our lives', and have been watching it religiously for around 7 years now. I think it would be a great idea to release this feature on DVD.

To those reviewers who think it's absurd or impossible to release the complete series because it's been on the air for 40 years now (and they air 5 episodes every week), I think you should do some research before making any negative comments about the release. `Days of our lives' was a half an hour show for the first 10 years since it aired (from the mid 60s to mid 70s). MPI have already released almost all the episodes of the soap opera `Dark Shadows' (which also aired for half an hour every week day in the 1960s and 1970s) and plan on releasing the entire series in due time. MPI wouldn't continue to release the box sets if they weren't selling well. So, if MPI can release every episode of a soap opera, I don't see why Sony/Columbia/Tristar can't make box sets as well. I can understand that it would be rather tedious and expensive to release the episodes that each aired for one hour from 1975, but at least they can release the first 10 years of the show like MPI did for `Dark Shadows'. I'm sure other `Days of our lives' viewers like I would love to see how the family generations started off, and how the characters were, back then. Besides, 1 hour episodes aren't actually an entire hour. If you remove the commercials, they only come up to around 36-38 minutes per episodes, and the company would be able to put around 4-5 episodes per DVD.

All in all, I think it would be a great idea, because other than `Dark Shadows', no other soap opera has been released on DVD in season box sets. If the company did start releasing `Days of our lives' on DVD, I'm positive that many people would be willing to buy it.",1152316800,37,1790,4.308605341246291

I think that releasing the entire series of Days on DVD would be great but only if done the right way.  I love Days and have been watching since 1984 or 1985.  I think most people who were watching soaps in 1965 are probably not into the ""DVD craze"" so I'm not sure how well it would go over.  I would hate to start to invest in a complete series (a series that I am sure would cost a bundle since it is so huge) and then find out that after the first two or three years did not sell much that they just washed the whole idea.  If they decide to do this then I think they should start by releasing the most recent years then start working their way backwards.  Also, if they were still unsure about such a large project on DVD then what about individual shows available for download via internet?  Then we can burn them ourself and only buy the years that we really want?  Just a thought.

So lets recap:

Days on DVD = Good Idea

Start with most recent year and work backwards = Good Idea

Download individual shows via internet? = Not A Bad Idea",1147737600,3,1139,4.104072398190045
1529235,5,B00005JNH7,"DAYS is so deserving of DVD releases.  Though it's impossible for the entire series to get released since it's aired 5-days a week year-round for over forty years, Sony could still come out with themed ""Best Of"" multi-disc collections containing various FULL EPISODES, like each character or couple (past and present) having their own collection, or a weddings collection, and so on.  A good way for Sony to test the waters and see if DAYS DVD's would sell would be to maybe release the three primetime specials (One Stormy Night - 1992, Night Sins - 1993, and Winter Heat - 1994) as a set.  Then if successful proceed with larger themed collections.  It would be great if DAYS were to be the soap that broke the ice for daytime soaps on DVD.  I bet all die-hard DAYS fans would go absolutely wild over having classic memorable DAYS episodes on DVD.  How 'bout it, Sony?",1146009600,59,870,4.616883116883117
1529236,5,B00005JNH7,"Where does one begin??  Here goes...

Jack and Jennifer making love for the very first time (okay yes, the flame flickering in the background might have been cheesy and lame at the time and subject to criticism and ridicule from a yearning audience but we - or I should say ""those"" - who got the overall gist of this couple also got the point)

Julie Williams and that unflappable, unsinkable and somehow manageably unwrinkleable red evening gown was enough to make me keep tuning in, even at age 13.  I loved it all, and worshipped her as a teen, wishing I myself could uphold a comparable level of glam under any circumstances despite her wild-eyed looks, questionably tidy appearance and such (I didn't care, I simply looked at her as one to possibly emulate and look to as the epitome of class and ""glam"" despite extenuating shipboard and island adversities).  Need I say more?

Bo and Hope - the trials and tribulations of one of the world's first ""supercouples"" was depression-induced in itself.  The caged explosion with Kristian Alfonso (Hope) and actor Charles Cioffi (Ernesto Toscano), where a tear-stained Hope pleads with Bo to ""tell Shawn Douglas that his mommy loves him"" was enough to prompt many rewinds on my VCR at the time (i.e. did I really just see Hope explode inside of an enlarged bird cage)?  Who knew.

Roman/John and Isabella - their blossoming romance and her learning that Victor was her biological father while she and the others were all stranded on the island was heart-wrenching.  Seriously.  This entire subplot was played out to perfection.

Shane and Steve - need I say more?  These 80's/90's icons can come to anyone's rescue anywhere, anytime  :-)

So, 'nuff said - when will we see these fantastic, memorable episodes forever deservedly captured on DVD???  Soon, I hope!",1145232000,5,1809,4.843648208469055
1529237,5,B00005JNH7,I have looked and looked online for Days episodes on DVD. I have not seen a lot of the episodes but I want to very badly. I love the soap and cannot wait until it comes out(and I really hope it will). I know there are a lot of people besides me that want the DVD's to come out.,1124236800,22,277,3.711864406779661
1529238,5,B00005JNH7,I can't wait for this to start coming out on DVD. It'll be nice to have to watch over and over. I LOVE watching the older episodes that I may not have seen.,1124064000,12,156,3.757575757575758
7940762,5,B00005JNH7,"I currently live overseas and can only keep up with the latest ""Days of Our Lives"" episodes by paying $14.99 a month on my iPad from iTunes.  I'd love to try out the new Kindle Fire, but just won't do it till this series is available in amazon on demand (and open to the world, NOT just the USA)!  I'd love to have DVDs of the  series available from the beginning, so we can refresh our memories and keep 'Days' going indefinitely, despite what the future may hold for the soap opera genre.  It's like being with family every day, which helps keep the homesickness at bay.  God save Salem!",1347321600,,589,4.318181818181818
7940763,5,B00005JNH7,"I would really enjoying having ""Days Of Our Lives"" on DVD. I mean every single episode. I hope one day we can see ""Days Of Our Lives"" from the beginning. I was born in 1981 so I didn't get a chance to see how it all began. This is on my DVD wish list.",1345680000,,251,3.6666666666666665
7940764,1,B00005JNH7,freaken days of our lives is so stupid and lame.  my mom watches this pissy show some times.  i hate soaps they just use up tv space.,1339027200,,133,3.888888888888889
7940765,5,B00005JNH7,"I was 5 when i first began watchn days im 37 now and still love it i watch it much less only because i have to keep in the story or not watch at all my work schedule is ever changing and i cant stand only watching once a week. i would love to for days to come out on dvd i would buy every episode! its a part of my childhood memories my grandma and i used to watch together then i would watch her cook supper i have a 14 year old daughter now and even she likes days  i hope it goes to dvd it won't last forever on tv and would be a waste to just let go. if u love dramatic love stories and strong family bonds and just love you will love days of our lives and enjoy it and cherish it as i do! my thought is they will release it on dvd but they are waiting until the right time so they make lots more money from it ,either way i will still buy this series its priceless for soo many reasons to me .",1337817600,,898,3.6528497409326426
7940766,5,B00005JNH7,I think its a good idea for those who haven't seen what it was like yeara apon years ago when it first started. should be like a memeory video of the show and i think that this is one of the best soap series of all time i think. it changed the style of what soaps were and now.,1335052800,,277,3.711864406779661
7940767,5,B00005JNH7,Its not impossible to release the entire series of days. if somebody out there wants it bad enough they will be willing to buy it,1334793600,,129,4.2
7940768,5,B00005JNH7,"I am not a huge Itunes fan but they do sell them in seasons!!! starting from 2007 !!! and they are starting at only 9.99$ per season!! SHOCKING. This is great news to me because I stopped watching for a few years and recently got hooked again. So being able to go back and see the years I stopped watching on weekends is really really awesome!

I really wish I could just find the Demon possession storyline on dvd and some of the aremid and yea the prime time specials.. I never got to see them as that was before I began watching the only prime time soap episode thats aired in my time has been a general hospital twist of fate two hour prime time episode that was awesome and epic!!!I watched gh for three years after that .",1323302400,,727,4.192857142857143
7940769,5,B00005JNH7,"I am extremely interested in boxed sets of this soap, but ONLY if it starts at the beginning.  I loved the ""Bill, Laura & Micky"" love triangle, as well as the ""Julie, David & Susan"" triangle.  The first 10 years or more of this soap were the BEST!  I lost interest after the insipid 'Marlena possessed by a devil/demon' story line.  Blech! Like any other TV series, I want the episodes as they aired, not boxed set 'specials'.  What's the point if you don't know the story that led to them???",1319846400,,492,4.362637362637362
7940770,5,B00005JNH7,"It is foolish to think Days fans would not buy the whole series . Look , it would be a whole new income stream that could go on for a long time . It would be fresh to the fans starting over from the beginning and working their way threw . People got hooked on the show and had to keep coming back for more why would they not keep coming back for the dvd's ?",1314835200,,357,3.710526315789474
7940771,5,B00005JNH7,"I have been a fan of days of our lives since I was a child, for 25 years. I still watch, but there is that classic days that I would love to watch again. I would buy it for sure. I think that it would be wonderful if they had the best of... Best couples like Jack/Jenn, Patch/Kayla, Shane/Kim, both Bo/Carly (nineties era Bo/Carly was awesome!!), and old Bo/Hope before their first marriage, when they were first falling in love with each other, would also love to see Eugene/Calliope again, Tony/Anna, just to name a few. It would be a huge hit, along with the special night episodes, like Stormy Night. Please, please, let this become a reality!! In an era where it seems soap operas are no longer popular, please give us life long fans something to hang onto!!!",1307059200,,764,4.464285714285714
