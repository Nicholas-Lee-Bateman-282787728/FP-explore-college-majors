8070195,4,B0009Y8AEK,"I really enjoyed the Carol Burnett dvd. What was disappointing was that, it has only two shows on the dvd. Normally, when a dvd cost $20-30, it's because you are getting an entire season.  The dvd itself was in perfect condition, nice and clear without problems.",1292544000,2,262,4.695652173913044
8070196,4,B0009Y8AEK,"After Carol Burnett's attempts to get the legendary entertainer Sammy Davis, Jr. on the show, she finally succeeds in Volume 8. A sketch about fame & racism kicks off the show, relying more upon character than jokes to get laughs, which is telling but not preachy. The show is capped with a Jamaican-flavored musical production which employs the entire cast.
Next, there is the wonderful Shirley MacClaine, who joins Carol in a nostalgically amusing number about fan mail, and the show's traditional musical production, a classy number, and again starring Carol & Shirley. As a performer, MacClaine shows us her versatility, and it's also a reminder that the Carol Burnett Show offers more than just laughs.",1244505600,3,707,5.103448275862069
