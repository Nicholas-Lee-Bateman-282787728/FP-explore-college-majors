2128480,3,B0002W4U20,"Both DVDs contain the same 3 episodes. so its an obvious mistake that Amazon should rectify.

It seems that there are only 3 episodes available. So Sad.",1142121600,24,152,4.62962962962963
2128481,3,B0002W4U20,"This is another one of many television series from the 1950s and 1960s that is awaiting an official studio release.  Were it not for ""public domain"" releases like this three-episode, single-disc DVD from Alpha Video, we might not be able to see some of the television classics from TV's ""golden age"" on DVD.  So, in this regard, I appreciate the fact that at least a few episodes are available.  As to the episodes themselves, the three included here are all from the 1960s when John McIntire starred as Wagonmaster Chris Hale.  They include ""The Doctor Denker Story,"" ""The Malachai Hobart Story,"" and ""Alias Bill Hawks.""  These episodes, either alone or in various combinations, have been available on a few Western TV compilations, but this is one of the very few DVDs where you can get all three of them on a single disc.  While none of these are particularly standout episodes, they are representative of the series and include a few guest stars like Theodore Bikel and Franchot Tone.  Look for Irene Ryan of ""The Beverly Hillbillies"" in ""The Malachi Hobart Story.""

The episodes on Alpha's DVD, though not restored, are of decent audio/visual quality.  It remains to be seen as to whether or not we'll ever see an official release of the ""Wagon Train"" series.  As such, I recommend this DVD for fans of the series.

My rating is actually closer to *** & 1/2.",1125532800,76,1363,4.733050847457627
2128482,5,B0002W4U20,Very good brings back the good ole days......interesting story line and good acting without the bad language of today's movies.,1354752000,,127,5.4
2128483,3,B0002W4U20,"Where is Robert Fuller, who is advertised as being in these episodes?? The OLD ""Wagon Train"" is on TV's Encore Western channel every day! This is false advertising. I can't tell you how disappointed I am after buying this dvd and discovering I was duped. The last 2 seasons of ""Wagon Train"" featured the great actor Robert Fuller as Cooper Smith. The '63-'64 season were 90 minute episodes with awesome guest stars such as Barbara Stanwyck (before ""Big Valley""), Suzanne Pleshette, Carolyn Jones, Carol Lawrence, Michael Rennie, I could go on and on. The '64-'65 season went back to 60 minute episodes for the last season of the series. I got to meet Robert Fuller at Apacheland Movie Studio near the Superstition Mountains east of Phoenix (in 1965), and he is still one of the most beautiful and best actors in history. I bought this dvd solely because you advertised that the Robert Fuller episodes were on it, which they are not. Why would I buy a dvd when I can see these same episodes on tv 5 days a week for the last 2 years? The last 2 seasons were the best of the series. A couple of them are on Youtube, but it would be great if they were finally released on dvd. PLEASE change the advertising so people know what they are buying. P.S. Did you know that Robert Fuller was one of the dancers behind Marilyn Monroe when she sang ""Diamonds Are A Girl's Best Friend"" in ""Gentlemen Prefer Blondes""? Heads up, Mr. Fuller, you are being used to sell old ""Wagon Train"" episodes that are already on tv again for over 2 years. Please, someone release the BEST ""Wagon Train"" episodes, which are the last 2 seasons, not the tired, old black and white ones we've seen over and over.",1347062400,4,1678,4.504918032786885

2128485,5,B0002W4U20,"For many fans of this series, Ward Bond as Major Seth Adams, wagonmaster and Robert Horton as scout Flint McCullough are the best the series offered.  Many fans looked kindly as John McIntire as Chris Hale when he took over after Bond's death in 1960.  Robert Fuller as Cooper Smith never had quite the same acceptance in taking over after Horton's departure in 1960.  A show that had tons of guest stars: Lee Marvin, Robert Vaughn, Bette Davis, and many many others.  Why is this not available in a decent format and by season?",1222646400,2,528,4.585106382978723
2128486,5,B0002W4U20,"Clean, wholesome entertainment for the whole family with a good story line. It's unfortunate they don't make them like this anymore. This TV western is in the same league of programming as Bonanza, Gunsmoke, The Rifleman, Wanted, Dead or Alive, etc....",1217376000,3,252,5.170731707317073
2128487,4,B0002W4U20,"The Wagon Train series really deserves better than the release of just three episodes on DVD. Also, the transfer quality in my opinion is pretty poor, although the stories are watchable enough.

It is difficult to overstate the popularity of this series at the time of it's original showing in the late fifties/early sixties. The Ward Bond episodes are the best in my opinion, and apart from a number of episodes released on vhs tape about 10 years ago, there is nothing.

That's a real shame for what was without doubt one of the best western series ever made, with many star actors making appearances. I live in hope that this series will be given the status it deserves and released on DVD in full restored quality soon.",1180137600,4,723,4.640625
2128488,5,B0002W4U20,"I too would love to see WAGON TRAIN, Season One in a box set.  Instead, we are stuck with the only three episodes legally allowed to be sold (so thank goodness for companies like Alpha).  I get to meet actor Denny Miller, who played Duke Shannon on this TV series, this September in Aberdeen at the Mid-Atlantic Nostalgia Convention to talk about his screen work.  He played the role on this series less than 30 times (it was a recurring role) but thankfully one of them, ""The Malachi Hobart Story"" from january 24, 1962, is available on this DVD so I recommend it.",1179360000,5,565,4.466019417475728

2128490,1,B0002W4U20,"i took a chance on this because i love wagon train and hoped for a better transfer than the ones i had.

well that didn't work out to good because the transfers were the worst i have seen. sound drop-outs,blurry,and the sound the rest of the time seemed to be off some from the speech. i may have been just me but do be careful",1146787200,25,327,4.030769230769231
2128491,5,B0002W4U20,"This is another great series that is being wrongfully ignored by the studios.  It should be released season by season on dvd immediately!  I was a real big fan of especially the Ward Bond-Robert Horton episodes.  Those were definitely the best from this series.  And Frank McGrath as Charlie Wooster was great comedy relief.  PLEASE, which ever company holds the rights....release these episodes soonest on dvd NOW!!  You've already waited too long!!",1145059200,47,450,5.180555555555555
