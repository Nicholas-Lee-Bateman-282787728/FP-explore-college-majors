2892583,5,B000T28G5A,"As my title says, this is more of a response, than anything, to the review that says these box sets have left out some of the swearing.  That isn't true.  The reason why is that the fansubs he is talking about are, what I like to called, literally translated.  Basically, a word that was used to mean dang in the original fansubs was probably translated as damn in every situation, since damn is it's most literal translation.  Some would even use swears in place of adjectives they couldn't translate.  These box sets use the original language track, so when you watch these, you're getting the full experience.",1195948800,4,612,4.682242990654205
2892584,5,B000T28G5A,"i think that the uncut naruto is better because it has BLOOD and some foul language  but not curse words . The 5th uncut box set is going to be so awsome. probably better than the other one with all the blood that is in during the battle with naruto and neji. so i hope that there is a alot of uncut stuff like the other four uncut box set.

2892586,4,B000T28G5A,"These DVD boxed sets are great but if you have ever seen the original TV tokyo episodes in their original japanese.. you'll notice that they swear a lot. This is taken out in the english dubbed version including the uncut series. I'll have to double check to see if the option for the japanese dialogue adds the swearing back in. Hopefully they'll add more content in these boxed sets, not to mention more episodes. 13 episodes is no where near enough. The first series goes to almost 200 episodes. The new series ""shippuuden"" picks up with the next episode number after the first series. I think all total, naruto is up to 220-something. At 13 episodes.. this will takes years especially if it's only 13 episodes per 3 months.",1191888000,2,727,4.6434108527131785

-----------DISC 3: Special Features-------------
-Storyboard Booklet over episode 58
-Production Art
-English Credits
-Volume 6 Preview
-Advertisements for some other shows
-Option for Japanese with English subtitles, or the option to watch in English

Alright that's what is on all the discs.  As I generally do, I liked the graphics on the fold open container for the discs-nice pictures.  As I already said, you can watch in English or Japanese with subtitles.

This picks up right where the last box left off, starting with Naruto beginning to train withthe Toad Sage Jiraiya.  By episode 57, his training with the Sage is done--for now--and it spends an episode at the hospital with the previously injured ninja--such as Lee--.  Then episode 59 has Naruto rushing to get to the arena on time because the final rounds are about to start and his match against Neji is first.  Needless to say-of course he gets there-and the next 3 episodes cover his fight with Neji-I won't tell you who wins, just watch and find out.  Then the remaining 3 episodes cover the matches of the other finalist, leading up to Sasuke's match with Garra.

It leaves you wishing you had the next box--unless you've already seen the episodes somewhere else.  But you'll hvae to wait for box 6 to come out, unless you want to read about hem or watch them over the internet.  Or, if it is playing on tv currently wherever you live, as it is where I live-though it is already way past this-, then you can watch what happens next on tv.  There are plenty of places to watch for free, or read episode summaries, or to read the manga on which the show is based.

If you would like recommendations on where to go, leave a comment and I'll try to make sure I check it regularly to reply back.

As I always say, there are lots of episodes.  Currently out--in Japan anyways, though I've been watching with subs over the internet--there are 256 episodes, and the manga is a good ways past that.  I'm pretty sure the episodes will definitely hit the 300 mark and keep going from there, so we are looking at a LOT of boxed sets.  There was an average of 13 episodes to a box, though the last two have had 14.  But that is over 20 boxes, either way.  So I highly recommend you buy them when they are on sale, and not at full price.  Because you're looking at dishing out a lot of cash.  Over time, yes.  But still a lot.",1191456000,15,3034,4.466302367941712

2892728,3,B000T28G5A,"Naruto Uncut Box Set 5 is a three DVD disc set that contains episodes fifty-three through sixty-five of Naruto.  The first and second discs contain four episodes, and the third disc contains five episodes and the special features.  The focus of this box set is Naruto's training with Jiraiya (one of the legendary Sannin), and the beginning of the final round of the Chunin exam.

The first extra on this set is labeled as ""Production Art.""  This consists of ten pages, and all ten pages are model sketches of the Naruto characters that appear in this box set.  There is also ""From Sketch to Screen,"" which contains eight pages of storyboards from episode fifty-six.  For each storyboard, you can choose to see the clip that the storyboard is for.  You can also see the English credits in the ""Extras"" menu.  While it's still the credits without any background music, there is at least a different background image being used this time.

There is a sneak preview of Naruto Uncut Box Set 6, which runs for about three-and-a-half minutes.  A link labeled as ""Trailers"" is a link to four trailers.  The link labeled as ""Manga"" takes you to three advertisements for Shonen Jump magazine and Shonen Jump manga titles.

Again it's disappointing, but not unexpected, that the special features on this set are virtually identical to the special features on the first four DVD box sets.  I still hope that on a future volume of the Naruto DVD box sets, that Viz Media will put a lot more effort into the special features.  However, if you're a Naruto fan that wants to collect all of the episodes on DVD, then the Naruto Uncut Box Set 5 would be a good addition to your DVD library.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1265068800,,1786,4.6075949367088604

Otherwise, and it was around the Thanksgiving holiday and i do realize that was out of his control.  He was very good but there was a ripe in the bottom of the package also.  Not sure if the post office did this or distribution.  But all in all my son will be very happy christmas morning and that is all that i wanted in the first place.",1228521600,,460,3.8105263157894735
2892731,4,B000T28G5A,"Uncut Volume 5's regular edition starts off mostly as a training arc, with everyone recovering or suffering from the effects of the preliminaries and some training for their next opponent.  Much of this focuses on Naruto and a new very important character, Jiraiya.  This perverted old man is actually a link to Naruto's past, and once convinced begins to train Naruto to control the Nine-Tail's chakra within him.  There is some more character development, especially for the mysterious Gaara, who could definitely use it, and Neji.

The rest of the box set focuses on the final round matches between Naruto and Neji, and Temari and Shikamaru.  One is a pound it out battle between opposing skill sets and ideals and one battle is chess match between two tactitians.  Both of these serve to be quite entertaining, but through out the matches you still anxiously wait for the battle between Gaara and Sasuke.  Which unfortunately, you'll have to wait until Volume 6 (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Naruto-Uncut-Boxed-Set-Volume-6/dp/B000WW1YNS/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Naruto Uncut Boxed Set, Volume 6</a>) for.

This volume is the usual high quality release of the series, with a good amount of comedy, character development and action.  It comes with the usual set of 3 discs and the storyboard booklet for a very nice price.  I definitely recommend it.",1216512000,,1396,5.481308411214953

2892733,5,B000T28G5A,"with Volume 5 of the popular anime series Naruto.

It includes 13 episodes mostly centering on Naruto and other students getting prepped for the finals of the Chunin Exam that they are fighting in.  Rock Lee is in the hospital and struggling with not being able to compete in the tourney.  Gaara is well...still a psychotic, mind warped loony that enjoys killing more now than ever.  Naruto is well himself but he's trying to strength himself before his fight with the blockheaded and full of himself Neiji.  Who believes that you can't change your own fate.

It ends with the upcoming match between Sasake (whom finally returns from training just in time to not be disqualified from his match) with Gaara.  It will be an excellent setup and opener for Volume 6 that looks to continue to ramp up the action for our hereos and the people of the Hidden Leaf village as a major plot is about unfold right in their faces.

Great volume and price for a show that i continue to enjoy despite all else.",1210291200,,995,4.550561797752809
2892734,5,B000T28G5A,"This is a big volume in the Naruto series... Starting off with a few comedic episodes as Naruto trains for the finals of the chunin exams and his big fight against the genius Neji Hyuga. Featuring one of the funniest characters in the show, the famous pervy sage AKA Jiraiya. This is possibly the biggest pervert in anime history... you can't help but laugh at him and his antics.

Though after the training is up the series does a 180 as the finals begin... and we're treated with a brilliantly animated fight between Neji and Naruto. Although Naruto is the lead character and is constantly being beaten on by Neji... not once do you despise the young genius as he tells his sad story while pounding on the nine-tailed fox child. With antagonists you can't help but love, this is where the series truly shines through with it's awesome character development.

Then, after this breathtakingly exciting fight we're treated to something special. Shikamaru's true breakout episode. He finally gains purpose and something that makes him unique in the series. Not since Rock Lee fighting his heart out against Gaara has a secondary character been so compelling. Shikamaru will steal your imagainations... and if you're anything like my girlfriend, your hearts too.

Though, throughout the entire episode the main event is constantly teased... Gaara VS Sasuke. You'd think they were maineventing Wrestlemania how they talk it up. And let me tell you... it works! I can't wait for volume 6 to see this clash of power.

Naruto just gets better and better.

The only problem I had wasn't with the product but with the packaging and shipping, it was poorly packaged which led to the product box to be excessively creased on the sides, not damaging the discs but ruining the collectible box itself.",1201737600,,283,4.568627450980392
2892736,5,B000T28G5A,"Ok, I've read all the other reviews up till now, and some had interesting input (some didn't, boo 1 star), and I realized I had to add this. This is the Naruto series we're talking about here. The international craze, with millions of fans from 5 to 80, male and female, all over the world. This is a purchase you cannot regret; the series only gets better with time, and you'll be sad when you get up to episode 200 and can't find these early episodes to rewatch, since not even Dattebayo carries any Naruto from below episode 90. So please, for your own sake, just buy it?",1201564800,,574,4.324074074074074
2892737,4,B000T28G5A,"I found it weird when i saw that America is selling the Naruto seasons in two separate volumes. Thats so cheap. Why not sell the complete seasons in one 6 disc set. For anyone who wasn't aware vols 1&2 are season 1, vols 3&4 are season 2 and vols 5&6 are season 3. Also I was hoping to buy from the U.S. to jump ahead of where I'm at just having watched season two on TV and i have to say I'm disappointed that i have to pay just for 13 episodes. Thats like nothing in these long running Anime series'. Id have to get the next two vols and then wait because They're releasing the DVDs way too slowly. This is an outrage that not even Naruto believes it.

Now for some of the PROS that come with Naruto. If you have the money then season three is the season to own on DVD. It's way better than all other seasons in the Naruto arch. It has the most plot and is pivotal in the entire story. It does end with a cliff hanger though. If you weren't a fan of the first season but thought the second season was getting better this season should blow you away. You will want to keep watching all the way until the filler episodes in season 6. I'm now (due to awesome websites) up to Naruto Shippuden and can't wait to see if these stories are better than the third season.",1200787200,2,1263,4.072289156626506

2892741,4,B000T28G5A,"I haven't watched the content of this set yet, as I watch Naruto as it is broadcast in Japan. If it is where I think it is though, this is the part where the action REALLY heats up, and takes Naruto to the next level. It's presents the entire world of Naruto, not just the 4 man team the series starts with. And it only gets bigger from there.

The Uncut Box Set once again does a good job of giving the hardcore fan all the content they could hope for along with the original Japanese audio and dialog. A very nice and solid box that fits with the rest of the series, and another amazing storyboard booklet.",1199059200,,608,4.1525423728813555
2892742,2,B000T28G5A,"I initially wrote this review for the first set, but found it pretty much covers ALL the Naruto sets released so far.

Let me clear this up right now before I even start this review: The Naruto series has many strengths. The characters in it are interesting and unique and the general storyline is great. Furthermore the animation and voicing are stupendous and make the show worth watching.

If I was rating based solely on the the TV series, Naruto would easily get 5 stars; but I'm not. I'm rating the box set as a whole, and honestly it is severely lacking. First of all the set only comes with 3 discs (13 episodes total). For around 50 dollars this is an enormous rip-off. Other series I have purchased recently (DBZ, Lost, Heroes, etc) come with 6-8 discs and over 20 episodes (most of them hour-long episodes) for around the same price if not a little cheaper! Plus each episode is less than half an hour long; that is just a horrible deal right there. Another thing that detracts from the Naruto sets is that it holds back on special features. If you are a fan like me, you love to poke around all the extra tid-bits usually crammed in similar box sets (ie making of, deleted scenes, interviews, etc)!

Finally, the box sets never end on a complete note; they all awkwardly leave off right in the middle of a story. To make this even more excrutiating, the majority of the run time of these discs is taken up by the theme song at the begginning and end and the episode recap. A lot of the animation is just recycled over and over again to eat away the time and plot development.

I give the this product 2 stars only because Naruto itself is a great anime show. Unfortunately the Boxed Sets leave a lot to be desired.",1198886400,13,1726,4.401253918495298
2892743,3,B000T28G5A,I am a big Naruto fan and enjoy watching the DVD's so I have all 5 sets that have now been released. This set has some great episodes (most notably the three episode fight between Naruto and Neji) but for the most part is relatively plain. It has its' ups and downs but the ups are worth the price of admission. If you don't care about complete sets or things like that you can get the better episodes individually. I recommend the training with Jiraiya and the fight between Naruto and Neji. Otherwise wait till February and get the next set which should take you through the fight with Gaara.
