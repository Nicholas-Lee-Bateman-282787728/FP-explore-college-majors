The work they did is good but if you want to learn to butcher go to you tube and save your money . This DVD was a waste of money , in hard times like these you need more bang for your buck . Sorry BB you flubed a dub on this one - next time do the whole half of beef .",1391904000,,372,3.3372093023255816
