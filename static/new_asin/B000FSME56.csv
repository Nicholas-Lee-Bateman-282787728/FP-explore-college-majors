4125937,4,B000FSME56,"Shocking, Intense, Disgusting, different story line from the first one so it does not seam like the film makers are recycling old ideas. Mind bending death traps that will scare the crap out of anybody watching. My favorite was the hand trap. Jigsaw is manipulative, self righteous, sadistic and just pure evil.",1446249600,,311,5.0
4125938,1,B000FSME56,"Nothing past the first 10 minutes of this movie should have happened. I'll sum it up quickly so you can get on with your life.

A bunch of people are in a house. They are locked in and the same deadly nerve agent that was used in the Japanese subways is poisoning them. The doors are elaborate and cannot be used as an exit. But the windows are WEAKLY boarded up. They have plenty of tools to either go through the windows, or if those are barred, to punch through the wall. It doesn't take superhuman strength to break through plaster and bricks. It just takes a brain. They had 2 hours to punch through the wall and get to a hospital.

Do that and the movie ends.

And that is just an example of what all ""victims"" suffer in this series. They follow the rules given by this merely condescending and quite stupid villain. The victims NEVER think outside the box. They never search for traps. A trap might find them though. They know it's a trap, but they do the obvious thing anyway, knowing that it will kill them. How stupid do Bousman and Whannell think we are??? The victims NEVER think. For ONCE I would like someone to anticipate the tripwire and freaking STEP OVER IT!!!!!!!! AND STILL GET KILLED!!!! A good horror/suspense movie doesn't demand that they escape. It just demands intelligently thought out writing.",1446249600,,1321,4.518828451882845
4125939,4,B000FSME56,More complex and a bit hokier this sequel was still good. Much better than expected. Intelligent horror/suspense that was much lower on gore than I was led to believe. Truly clever setups and dilemmas. recommended,1446163200,,213,5.114285714285714
