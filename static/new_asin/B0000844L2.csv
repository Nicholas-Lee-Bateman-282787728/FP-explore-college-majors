7978922,5,B0000844L2,"I have four copies of the movie. But I needed it on a single DVD for my collection. This is a pretty good mantis movie which down plays the mantis skills over the rise of the student's skills. Thus, youth has its rewards in the martial arts world i.e. in the movies, tournaments and in self defense.",1421712000,,299,4.2631578947368425
7978923,2,B0000844L2,"Mark Long (""The Mystery of Chess Boxing"") plays Xiao Li, a pharmacist who works at his dad's apothecary when an injured man leaves a training manual behind.  Turns out that the man and his brother swiped the much sought-after book from their uncle (Tong Ga Kuen) who had been keeping it hidden from evil-doers (Lung Fei & Chuen Yuen) who are now after them.  Xiao Li studies the book and seems to master the style in about 3 seconds.  Unfortunately his father is murdered and the book is stolen by the two goons.

The humor tends to be annoying but it's not overly abundant.  The fights are pretty good and fun to watch, though sometimes they're a little too long.  That's usually on the list of assets but fights can get boring if they go on forever and/or occur too frequently.  That being said, it's a minor complaint and I enjoyed most of them.  On the faster and more precise side of old-school kung fu.

The fullscreen treatment is why I can't really recommend it.  I can live with the  English dub and the sub-par picture quality but the formatting nearly ruins the final fight.  Usually I find fullscreened kung fu to be annoying, but it doesn't bother me too much.  Here it does.  It's not unwatchable but it could've been so much better.  On the plus side, the only special feature is a cool one:  Fights from several of Eastern Heroes selections, including ""7 Commandments of Kung Fu"", ""Drunken Arts and Crippled Fist"", ""World of Drunken Master"", ""Snake Deadly Act"", and ""Unbeaten 28"".  2.5/5 for this version.

7978924,4,B0000844L2,"Beckybwoy you're absolutely correct,these movies are 20-30 years old and in the 80's when I went to 42nd street every friday night to see them ,some of them were poor quality then but that does not take away from the action and that is what you are looking for. Those other two guys with their upity reviews need to get back to their little preppy school before their teacher marks them absent,any Real old scooler knows that these pictures are old and they accept them as they are.",1149984000,,482,4.488636363636363
7978925,5,B0000844L2,"On Like the other two so called kung fu lovers above, when I watch a martial arts flick, I usually watch it for the actual art of kung fu PERIOD!!  As a true old school kung fu lover, I cannot afford to focus 100% on the sound or picture quality, I'm just too caught up in the choregraphy and or the cinematography. These flicks are usually 20 to 30 years old,,come on be a flexible.  You don't score a flick simply on the picture and sound quality alone!! Personally,,,just as long as I can see and hear appropriately what is happening,,I'm good to go. Therefore, I will rate that movie accordingly!!  Yeah, the picture and sound quality is not the greatest,,but that did not take nothing away from the acceptable story line and the amzing fight scenes!  This is a top notch flick where the art of kung fu is absolutely transparent, an amazing kick ass flick which deserves nothing less than 5 stars in my book!!!",1147996800,5,914,4.455089820359281
7978926,1,B0000844L2,"I don't understand why they think that the average kung fu movie consumer could tolerate such crappy quality.  I've seen this movie in Europe and I know for a fact that the picture quality is decent in it's widescreen format.  When I seen this one come to the states, I refused to buy it unless there was some indication that it's either remastered or in letterbox or both.  They should start doing decent transfers of kung fu movies and quit ripping us kung fu movie fans off!!",1107475200,,478,4.471264367816092
7978927,3,B0000844L2,"I watch a lot of kung fu movies and have come to expect that the DVD transfer of such films is usually less than perfect, but this one went above and beyond the call of duty to be one the worst DVD transfers of a kung fu film I have ever seen.  During the first 20 minutes the film is almost unwatchable as everything takes place in what appears to be heavily-foliaged terrain, its very hard to tell because everything is washed out green with almost no detail visible, even the actors appear to be green when seen in the distance.  Also one can see this was transfered from a VHS tape or similar format as it appears that the tracking was being adjusted constantly for the first sequences of the film.  The only thing that saves it from getting 1 star is that it has some very good scenes of Mantis Kung Fu, when they're actually visible of course. Here's to hoping they find a better print of the movie someday.",1044403200,6,913,4.296511627906977
