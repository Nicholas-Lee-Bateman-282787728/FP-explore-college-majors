8480509,4,B005NHZAX2,"These are older swordsplay flicks featuring Jimmy Wang Yu and David Chiang.  Here are my observations on the quality of the DVD (as opposed to reviews of the films themselves):

This disc is just like a lot of VideoAsia releases even thought the case says ""Golden Star Films"" put it out.  The DVD menu is even the same as VideoAsia's releases, so that is the quality level that you can expect.  Not great, but cheap and worth the low price for fans of these kind of movies.

THE ONE ARM SWORDSMEN (title given in the film itself)
This starts off with credits in letterbox widescreen but after 2 minutes it shifts to a transfer that fills my screen and looks to be cropped.  The picture quality is OK althought there are some dark spots in the night scenes.  The film is dubbed in English with no other language options.

ONE ARMED VS 9 KILLERS (title given in DVD menu)
There are no titles or credits in this film until it finishes and ""The End"" flashes on the screen.  The format has a widescreen aspect and it is a fairly good print.  The film is dubbed in English with no other language options.

POINT THE FINGER OF DEATH (title given in film itself)
This film is sometimes called One Armed Chivalry Against One Armed Chivalry.  This print is cropped and fullscreen with English dubbing (no other language options).  The picture has a lot flaking but it is watchable in my opinion.  The night shots are dark sometimes.

ONE-ARMED SWORDSMAN '94 (title given in film itself)
The resolution is a bit grainy on this even though it is the most recent of the 4 films.  It has English subtitles and Chinese audio with no other language options.

Overal you are getting 4 decent martial arts movies and your staisfaction will really depend on your enjoyment of that genre.  I like old fu flicks so this was a decent buy for me since I did not have any of these films already.  If you are looking for higher quality production then buy the Dragon Dynasty editions of The One-Armed Swordsman and The Return of The One-Armed Swordsman.",1335571200,6,2028,4.521978021978022
