216097,4,630018305X,"The world of W.C. FIELDS is a very peculiar one ; it is filled with clouds  of smoke and empty bottles, with terrible children deserving to be lashed  to blood and with nightmarish wives and mother-in-laws. Always ready to  help his fellow companions, our poor hero must also cope with heartless  bankers and dishonest crooks (yes, they exist ! ).
If you are a movie  lover, this particular world deserves a royal place on your library's  shelves, W.C. FIELDS playing, in my opinion, in the same league than Buster  Keaton, Charles S. Chaplin, the Marx Brothers or Jerry Lewis. The League of  the Champions of the Absurdness.
Nevertheless, the price of this  Criterion release, without bonus features, except for english subtitles,  could discourage the average amateur. THE BANK DICK lasts only 74 minutes  but offers two or three scenes worthy to appear in an anthology of the best  comic scenes ever filmed. I specially loved the car chase, involving three  cars, a motorcycle and a W.C. FIELDS destructing his car while driving at  70 miles per hour. But dialogs are also extremely funny, completing the  pleasure that you are certainly going to have with one of the Masters of  comic movies.
A DVD dedicated to mother-in-laws.",969062400,24,1231,4.902912621359223

216099,5,630018305X,"Buyers beware!  I Purchased The Criterion Collection DVD of ""The Bank Dick"" and found the video and sound to be both excellent - except that  about halfway through the film the sound and video go several frames out of  sync and remain that way through to the end.  This unfortunate defect ruins  what is otherwise an excellent transfer.  I hope Criterion corrects this  and does a reissue soon.",967075200,5,394,4.705882352941177
216100,5,630018305X,"This is the second best Fields film (after It's a Gift) and it's similar in that it casts Fields as the lovable drunk with an absolutely hateful  family. From the almost surreal episode directing the movie to the  eye-poppingly ridiculous chase scene, this one is pure comic entertainment.  One side note: it's sad and not a little scary how bloated and tired the  Great Man looks in this compared to just six years earlier when It's a Gift  was released",966384000,,454,4.625
216101,5,630018305X,"You better listen to the dialogue and enjoy a one man show. Fields was no longer a youngster when this film was made. No matter, the double entendre is in full force and the fun just never stops.
How would anyone describe  one of the funniest guys in films ever. You can do it ..dont try..and catch  who wrote that screenplay.",959644800,,326,4.327868852459017
216102,5,630018305X,"Fields wrote the screenplay (using an alias) and stars in this zany comedy about a man who accedentally trips a bank robber and winds up as a guard. Field's last major role is a classic, a worthy end to his great career. Side two of the laserdisc is in CAV format, which allows single frame access to the frenetic cops and robbers chase sequence.

216193,5,630018305X,"""The Bank Dick"" (1940) remains among the all-time great comedies. W.C. Fields calls the shots as the immortal Egbert Sous&eacute; while pulling a fast one on the Hays Office. Plenty of quotable dialogue, eccentric characters and a car chase for the ages.  Along with ""It's a Gift"" (1934) and ""Man on the Flying Trapeze"" (1935), Fields' feature-length masterpiece.",1376352000,,363,5.258620689655173

216196,5,630018305X,This movie is the absolute funniest movie of all time!!!  There is no other movie that has ever been produced that even comes close to the utter hilarity of The Bank Dick starring W.C. Fields...it is simply the absolute ultimate and will cause most people to wet their pants!,1317772800,,275,4.612244897959184
216197,5,630018305X,"I once met a man who didn't like W. C. Fields. He said he didn't think Fields was funny. Well, what did I learn from this--I learned to stay away from that man. Fields was the greatest comedian the movies ever produced. How wonderful that many of his skits from the Ziegfeld Follies and George White's Scandals were later preserved on film. Fields knew exactly what he was doing, For a great read, try the biography about Fields by James Curtis (title: W. C. Fields). The part about Fields' battle with some swans that lived on a lake near him and often came into his back yard where they would fight him off and win is almost as funny as one of Fields' skits. Even when he was given terrible writers, Fields would ad-lib his way through terrible dialogue and invent funny bits that saved several movies. His private life was tragic, but the legacy he left is priceless. This movie ties with ""It's A Gift"" as his funniest. Both are so funny that it is impossible to say one is better than the other. Strangely, ""It's A Gift"", released in 1934, was a huge money maker, and The Bank Dick, released in 1940, was a financial flop. When it was released in 1949, it faired much better. The comedy is timeless.",1313452800,,1203,4.423423423423423
216198,5,630018305X,A great nostalgic trip back to my childhood. One of my all time favorites is now available. The video and audio are excellent. Just great!,1287014400,2,138,4.56
216199,2,630018305X,"The Bottom Line:

I walked into The Bank Dick knowing little about W.C. Fields and walked out very unimpressed by his style of comedy: the film wanders freely from one boring setup to another, never finding much comic material or presenting any sort of clothesline to string gags on, leaving the audience with little to do but listen to lines that might be funny if written but sure aren't when Fields mutters them droningly.

2/4",1252886400,,430,4.72
216200,5,630018305X,"Field's diehard fans debate whether this film or It's A Gift was his greatest.  I prefer It's A Gift, but I still love this film very much.

Here the family relations have completely disintegrated to the point that little Evelyn Del Rio is bouncing a ketchup bottle among other things off his head.  It's more a state of war with Fields as the crazy grandfather rather than Fields as the henpecked husband.

Some of Fields's regulars are here:  Grady Sutton plays Og Oggilby (""...sounds like a bubble in a bathtub..."") who is not an imbecile but very much a ""luddie duddie.""  Russell Hicks is great as J. Frothingham Waterbury,the crooked beefstake (beefsteak?) mines stock grifter.  Shemp Howard (of the Three Stooges)plays Joe the Bartendar.  Bill Wolfe is funny just standing there in the Black Pussy Cat Cafe and being examined by Dr. Stall. Jan Duggan is funny as the mother of the little boy with the cap gun Fields attempts to apprehend. Franklin Pangborn almost steals the movie as J. Pinkerton Snoopington, bank examiner.

The plot?  It's ""...improbable, impossible"" as Franklin Pangborn said in another Fields movie.  It only makes sense because Fields is in it.  It ends in a classic chase scene that even manages to include a 1930's scene out of the WPA or CCC.  But along the way we are treated to a double noggin of his rich plays on the language and his willingness to play the rascal.

This was one of the movies that got frequent play in the W.C. Fields
revival of the mid to late 1960's.",1230249600,3,1505,4.673003802281369
216201,5,630018305X,"If you enjoy comedy films from this era, you need to see this one. Fields is at his best, screwing things up and trying to get them un-screwed up. It's one gag after another, with lots of laughs along the way. In particular, the routine where he's trying to explain the investment to his future son-in-law had me cracking up.

Yes, the film is very dated. The stunt double driving the car at the end looks nothing like Fields, and there is some racial stereotyping typical in films of this era. But give the film a chance and I think you'll find most of it holds up well after all these years. Fields was a truly original character, just about everything the guy says is funny. Good entertainment.",1217376000,,697,4.4453125
216202,5,630018305X,"Though his work is not to every taste, I view Fields as a comic genius right alongside Chaplin and The Marx Brothers. Along with ""It's A Gift"", ""The Bank Dick"" remains Fields's most sustained piece of hilarity. A brisk outing at just over 70 minutes, the film strikes an ideal balance between plot intrigue and broad action, as Egbert foils bank robbers, invests in a beefsteak mine, and save his prospective son-in-law's job. The immortal Franklin Pangborn is superb as a bank examiner victimized by Souse.",1182729600,,507,4.906976744186046
216243,5,630018305X,"Sure, its one of The Great Man's best movies, but wher are the Paramount classics, Man On The Flying Trapeze and The Old Fashioned Way??

These two Fields movies sum up his character better than any of 'em!",1167004800,,206,4.421052631578948
216244,4,630018305X,"The Bank Dick is the story of a drunken man who finds himself appointed to be the security guard of the bank after a robbery falsely paints him as a hero. This man is in no way qualified for such work, but he takes the job happily. In the midst of his job, he is swindled into investing a large sum of money that he borrows from the bank into a beefsteak mine.

WC Fields is a very natural and understated actor in this film, whose lines seem ad-libbed and whose comic timing is well tuned. He is a likable, clumsy drunk whose antics are obviously damaging but forgivable.

This film features other film favorites. Una Merkel plays Fields' daughter, a cute, innocent character which is unlike her usual personality. Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges plays the bartender. He is frequently in the film, but his character is not developed.

This comedy involves many standard devices including the slow-burn, sarcastic comments, and an overall outrageous story. The background music is sometimes a hindrance to the jokes because it cheapens them rather than emphasizing them.

Overall, however, this is a cute film.",1131667200,2,1112,4.776041666666667
216245,4,630018305X,"This review is to inform any prospective buyers out there that have a remote interest in this film, to buy 'The Bank Dick' as soon as possible. The studio, Criterion Collection, has stopped printing this DVD and thus, it has become an OOP (Out-of-print) like many more of Criterion Collection's films.

So, if you are a Criterion Collection completist, or have put this film in your wishlist, I recommend that you buy it now, before it is unavailable.",1114214400,3,451,4.782051282051282
216246,1,630018305X,"I am wondering about myself.  Everyone here loves this movie, but I found it incredibly tedious and unfunny (is that a word?)

A lot of the ""humor"" is violent and abusive, the main character and his family are among the most hideously unsympathetic characters ever, and the ""one-liners"" are rare and not very clever.  The so-called plot is feeble, dated and disjointed.

After what seemed an endless period of time, I found that only 45 minutes had gone by.

I love old movies, but I cannot understand why anyone would call this one of the funniest ever.  Come on, this was released in 1940, after some of the truly great and funny movies of all time.

I feel like the kid pointing out that the emporer has no clothes!",1113868800,5,718,4.51937984496124
216247,5,630018305X,"I've always been a big fan of W.C. Fields and I've always been disappointed in the quality (and quantity) of his work that is available.  With the 6 short films, Criterion is doing a great job of preserving W.C. Fields for future generations.
I wouldn't argue that some of his other films (such as ""Never give a sucker..."") are better than ""The Bank Dick"", but they're not available on DVD (let alone after being restored as this film has been).
I won't rehash the plot, except to say that the notion of a petty criminal always keeping one step ahead from being found out is continually repeated and nobody did it better than Fields.  A big part of the enjoyment of watching Field's movies is to find out how he lands on his feet.  Field's survives in his world like a cat; with grace and only barely acknowledging what has been going on around him.",1024963200,5,849,4.464516129032258
216248,4,630018305X,"I've seen ""The Bank Dick"" so many times, it's a little hard to review it. It's been on TV for decades and was probably one of the first movies I ever saw. I think I like it so much because it, as well as its star, W.C. Fields, is quite atypical of the Hollywood of the time [1940]. Indeed, the very fact that Fields became a star who commanded a fortune is a happy anomaly in movie history. He had a bulbous nose, he was overweight, and he is reputed to have been drunk much of the time, both on the set and off. He didn't like children or dogs. He drove the Hayes office, the self-censorship arm of the industry at the time, mad with his double entendres and with his characters who lied, cheated stole, and, worst of all, almost never paid for their sins. There are several reasons he was so successful, I think. The primary one is that he was relentlessly funny. Another is that he was always honest because, in his poking fun at everyone, he never forgot to include himself. Finally, he appealed then, as he still does today, to those who love to see hypocrisy satirized.
Like all Fields movies, ""The Bank Dick"" barely has a plot at all. It simply careens from one improbably situation to the next. Fields is Egbert Souse of Lompoc, CA. He lives with his wife, mother-in-law and two daughters. They constantly henpeck and ridicule him. One day a movie company comes to town, and somehow Souse finds himself hired as the picture's director. This leads to his apprehending a bank robber, which, in turn, leads to his getting a job as a guard at the bank. Then, there is the character who comes along selling stock in a failed mine. One of the hapless buyers is souse's future son-in-law, who `borrows' the money from the bank for a few days, only to have a bank auditor show up moments later. You call this a plot? Well, forget about the story. It's all just an excuse for the wonderful physical comedy, the sharp, witty dialog, and Field's remarkable line deliveries.
I should mention that Fields surrounded himself with some of the great character actors of his time. The cast of ""The Bank Dick"" includes Una Merkel, Cora Witherspoon, Frank Pangborn, Grady Sutton and Shemp Howard, who later became famous as one of the Three Stooges.",1021766400,8,2238,4.501228501228502
216249,5,630018305X,"Take a classic comedy and combine it with a company dedicated to bringing you the best quality products on the market and what you get is a DVD that is worth the money! If you want to really enjoy WC Fields in one of his last truly great films, get this version! The print is pristine and the sound is cleaner and clearer than I have ever heard it. It's a lot of money, but worth it for such a good movie.
This is not a review the movie itself in detail here. Most people know this classic, and a lot of people have done that already. This is for the DVD. I am dissapointed they couldn't of done a commentary track, but I will forgive them since it is such a nice print of the movie.

He spends most of his time at the local saloon, where the bartender is Shemp Howard of the Three Stooges.  He has a good relationship with the bartender, even though he never seems to have paid for a drink.  His main occupation appears to be gambling on horses at the saloon.

This is W.C Fields material, and if you don't like these early comics on film, you won't like this one. But Fields makes a point in this movie to hate kids, to be nasty to people (especially some women), and to degrade work. This would be a great film for your collection of early comedy, and Fields is always collectable, even if you don't like the humor. In this film, as the title implies, he's a somewhat lazy, irresponsible bank guard. From the time you meet his character, you just know this isn't going to go well (in the funny sense).
