683901,3,6303568254,"Tobe Hooper's Night Terrors is a low budget horror film with a few pinches of nudity (the scenes with ""Genie"" played by Zoe Trilling and ""Sabina"" played by Alona Kimhi are particularly good!).

In short, the dialogues are very poor, the plot and the setting are pretty good, and the special effects are average, while the acting is below average with William Finley's performance being pathetic.  Moreover, Robert Englund does a much better job as Marquis De Sade than as Paul Chevalier. In addition, it was interesting, though not that surprising, to see Zachi Noy from the Lemon Popsicle series, since the film was shot in Israel.

The movie could have been more graphic, but it seems that the director was holding back for some reason.

Nevertheless, what with the horror and the sexy scenes, and as far as B-movies are concerned, the film is decent.

Overall, far from being a masterpiece, it just might provide for an evening's entertainment if in a really silly mood and/or intoxicated.",1146355200,7,992,4.880952380952381
683902,5,6303568254,This is a well made film not only on the Marquis Desade but also Gnostic Christian cults. The premise of the film is not only s&m but the hidden Gnostic cult behind the scenes,1088035200,,175,4.176470588235294
683903,1,6303568254,"I had great excpectations about this movie, so I was really dissapointed when I saw it. Robert Englund plays the main characther, and Tobe Hooper has directed it. So of course you think this has to be a good movie. Robert  Englund plays the characther of Marquis De Sade and Paul.  Chevaller, both  relatives in their own time, and both with a great interest in S&M.  Genie is a girl who's moving in with her father in the East, and she get's  herself into parties run by Paul Chevaller.  I'm sure this movie was ment  to have a great plot, and I'm also sure that it was ment to be a kind of  epic film, telling the horror stories of S&M...but that goes straight  down the drain. Bat as we all know, life is full of suprises...and  dissapointments!",960595200,3,748,4.355072463768116

7850658,5,6303568254,"Englund does the best he can with a role that emphasizes megalomania rather than sadism, and because one of his characters is de Sade, the megalomania is a drawback.  Movie still gets an A- because of its most interesting aspect:  How seduction can lead to suffering and accompanying ""enjoyment.""  Very daring camerawork of the man and girl each riding horseback--I'll let you guess which person rides the black stallion, and which rides the white mare of innocence in this night-mare.  Sometimes a low-budget movie must offer extremes of plot because, realistically, it can afford to do little else.  Yet, much is done and done well in this offbeat thriller.  I sincerely doubt that its director, Tobe Hooper, really had much todo with e.g. POLTERGEIST, which is a bore and a half.  NIGHT TERRORS does what a movie is supposed to do:  The plot & character-development M*O*V*E fast. Movie is highly recommended for thriller-fans seeking a film that is very different.",1504828800,2,967,5.0

Bien, cependant Il faut toujours prendre les choses pour ce qu'elles sont .. Cet opus dans ses limites objectivement modestes est parfaitement russi, l'ensemble de ses composantes formant un tout homogne et prenant; L'ambiance sulfureuse et pesante, proche du nauseux sied idalement au propos, le dcorum savamment labor (certes un rien propret comme certaines luxueuses productions tlvisuelles ou autres..) ne dmritant nullement tout comme la bande musicale en parfaite adquation; Ajoutons que la distribution est fort convenable et bien implique, Robert Englund s'avrant, lui, tout simplement excellent dans son double personnage. Alors OK tout ceci semble peut-tre un brin 'clt', il n'en demeure pas moins une russite bien fouille pouvant aisment sduire l'aficionado!",1484438400,2,961,5.72027972027972
7850661,4,6303568254,"Hooper one of, if not THE, best stylist the genre has ever known. This is not one of his masterpieces, but is more multi-layered and artfully crafted than most directors could boast. Wrongly ignored because of low-budget and snobbery -- but then even those among Hooper's best (Salem's Lot, Lifeforce) are neglected.",1479340800,,316,5.096153846153846
