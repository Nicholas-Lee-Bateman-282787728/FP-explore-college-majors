7810243,5,6301229436,"As a David Carradine fan I want to ow as many of his movies as I can get my hands on.  Amazon has made that easier than I would have imagined.  I love this movie.  It was MUCH better than I expected it to be.  The entire experience, from ordering thru delivery was excellent was wonderful.",1437523200,,289,4.107142857142857

7810245,4,6301229436,"It may not be as good as ""Platoon"". However, personally I think it's fair enough for those who crazy about Vietnam War. It's under Class B in my personal War movie collection.(Top 100)",1217980800,,184,4.606060606060606
7810246,1,6301229436,I was disappointed with this purchase. This must have been pressed in somebody's basement. The picture and sound quality are terrible. P.O.W. the escape was the real title of this movie. I don't know how a reputable firm like Amazon can sell this garbage.,1210464000,,255,4.818181818181818
7810247,2,6301229436,"Except that Carradine plays Col. Jim

Cooper and nutty Golan Globur crew

stages this one. Not as bad as Rambo

III or Missing In Action III, as Sly

Stallone, who opposed Carradine in

silly Death Race 2000 (*), or Chuck

Norris went to the well once too of-

ten in those pics. Carradine and re-

cognizable black American actor Steve

(Johnny B. Goode) James steal the show

but despicable Mako, a former Hawai'i

Five-0 actor is believable enough until

his hardcore end. Typical pretty good

Carradine actioner undone by sorry Go-

lan Globus production standards which

are worse than Roger Corman's Am. Indies!",1146787200,,617,4.854368932038835
