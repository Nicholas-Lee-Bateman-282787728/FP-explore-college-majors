8267099,1,B0017SETZQ,"This version of Tosca is so bad it's funny. In a failed attempt to ""modernize"" the classic, the producers weigh down the story with hilariously inappropriate stage setups, including a tilted stage (at one point, Scarpia even has to grab a piece of furniture about to slide off into the orchestra pit!) that is actually fitting given the fact that the whole production is about to sink like the Titanic at any moment. The singers writhe and roll all over the stage, they go up and down on pulleys, clothes are ripped at, hairy chests are exposed (oh, brother!). All would be excusable if the singers gave us something new & great, or even good - they don't. The cast is not equal to the task, but is pretty to look at. Even the audience seems incredibly underwhelmed by the needless bombast and ham-fisted Broadway musical acting. And what is with the eyeball? Ugh, could you possible get a bigger sledgehammer to ram that metaphor home? C'mon, its Puccini, not KISS.",1289779200,7,966,4.654970760233918
8267100,1,B0017SETZQ,It's not just the bizarre staging and the hideous costumes and the fact that we are constantly prevented from being even remotely involved by the camera jumping into four black and white scenes from time to time. But it is poorly sung and conducted. The worst Tosca and Caravadosi and Scarpia on CD or DVD. I never made through Act One. Thank the operatic gods I just rented and didn't buy this turkey.,1235779200,3,402,4.52054794520548
8267101,3,B0017SETZQ,"I liked this DVD, the production is a little bit controversial, but the director achieved to show the intimate drama in a huge stage. The second act is perfect. The first is surprisingly good after Scarpia entrance and the sets are riveting. The problem here is the third act, Tosca has killed the evil baron for Mario's sake. With bloody hands and loving promises she arrived, after a beautiful ""lucevan le stelle' to warn Mario about the fake execution. They never really met in this production, she sings over him in a kind of balcony. At the moment of the execution itself, the TV director CUT OFF all the Tosca's lines and screams!!!! Why??? It's only a few moments of music although very significant ones! Nadja Michael is perfectly capable to delivery it! What hapenned? I'm shure for the live audience the scene was there! Why not in video, handicapping a strong performance? Shame, shame, shame!",1228089600,9,904,4.801282051282051
8267102,2,B0017SETZQ,"I had read a number of articles about this production of TOSCA (2007) on the Seebuhne in Bregenz. Most of them were favorable so I was looking forward to the DVD.  At the completion of the performance, I asked myself ""would you watch this again and again"" and truthfully the answer was ""no.""  It's a novelty.  Something completely different.  It certainly works on some levels of opera as theater but when you keep wishing the stage director was in the same room with you so you could ask questions it ends up a frustrating experience.  In hindsight I would defintely have rented the movie first before I made the purchase. And how are the singers?  You already heard the story about ""the little black dress.""  This features a TOSCA in a little red dress suit.  I did a double take when Nadja Michael made her first entrance.  She's the tiniest soprano I've ever seen!  Her singing is good but not great.  She storms back and forth on the huge floating stage which does not lend itself to the characters interacting with each other.  I was impressed with her ""Vissi d'arte.""  Zoran Todorvic as Mario left a lot to be desired.  Its as if the stage director told him he didn't have to sing all the notes all the time and could shout or spit out his words like some dramatic declamation.  His was a very strange interpretation.  And finally the evil Baron Scarpia - Gidon Saks.  Boy does he sweat throughout the opera. He probably needed a James Levine sized towel to dry himself off at the end.  He comes across as a bundle of raging hormones.  I don't even want to know what he was doing to himself under that trench coat when he first sees TOSCA in act one. I told you this production was ""different.""  If only his singing was as raging as his hormones.  All the singers wear head mikes. You never get to see the orchestra or condutor during the performance but they are excellent. The DVD gives the impression the opera was given without any intermissions.  It keeps flowing from one act to the other.  The applause during the performance is tepid but the audience gives a rousing ovation to the singers at the end.  I don't want to give too much of the stage business away.  It's best you are surpirsed by some of the things which work and many that don't.  Now if only we had a Blu-Ray DVD of Maria Callas as Tosca!",1221523200,4,2318,4.4336492890995265
