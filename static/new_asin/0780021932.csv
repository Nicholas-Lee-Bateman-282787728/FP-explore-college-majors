29925,4,0780021932,"Decently suspenseful movie in the classic French tradition, but it's a bit slow in the beginning.  I wouldn't call it ""the most suspenseful movie I've ever seen"" by any stretch of the imagination, but it's an  interesting story of these loons and their nitroglycerin-filled truck, and  how they cope with their almost-certain death versus the hope of escaping  the deadend town they're stuck in.",963878400,,395,5.125
29926,5,0780021932,"Three years before DIABOLIQUE, director Henri-Georges Clouzot had already asked his wife, Vera Clouzot, and one of the biggest stars of French cinema, Charles Vanel, to play together in WAGES OF FEAR. A young italian  actor, Yves Montand, was chosen to face Charles Vanel in this movie which,  in my opinion, is one of the 50 best movies ever filmed.
Lost in a little  south american town (Colombia or Venezuela ?), Montand and Vanel are ready  to risk their lives to earn the US$ 2000 the local branch of an american  oil company offers to those who have enough guts to drive two trucks,  loaded of nitroglycerine, to nowhere land. The story is well-known.
If  you haven't seen WAGES OF FEAR yet, you don't know your luck. Be prepared  for a wild ride not only through hellish landscapes but also through the  purest and the lowest of human feelings. Wait for scenes of anthology which  are already written in letters of fire in Movie History. Observe Vera  Clouzot's dresses that reflect in black and white the destiny of the  characters and listen to the final waltz ending one of the most pessimistic  movies ever made.
No extra features with this Criterion release. Great  sound and above-average image transfer with, unfortunately, a white  vertical line that will appear during long minutes on your private  screen.
A DVD for your library.",962496000,17,1346,4.812227074235808
29927,5,0780021932,"It is difficult to overstate what a terrific blend of suspense, biting images, and nihilistic philosophy this film is. It works at several levels, the most compelling being a thoroughly existential treatment of the action  adventure movie. Clouzot layers his irreverent cynicism into every aspect  of the film, but it is actuated by the tight interplay of the characters.  They are the kind of fugitives, hucksters, fortune seekers, down on their  luckers you'd expect to find at a squalid, end of the world drilling camp.  The director portrays them all in a dour, brave light as they struggle with  futility and fear.
The corruption, exploitation and innocence, are  brought to a boil by a raging inferno and a couple of truck loads of  nitroglycerine. Three hundred miles of rugged roads are all that separates  these desperadoes from a ticket out of town. Clouzot rolls his audience  into the drama with  ingenious visual cues, cables stressed to snapping,  tobacco blown from its paper. He uses no gimmicks, though, to impose an  artificial sense of spectacle. Everything is shown with a taut  authenticity. The film never loses its devil-me-care bravado in spite of  all its tension and pathos. Clouzot intersperses little milestones of  grace, in a prayer or a dance, with images of death. Alternately--  ambivalence, compassion and admiration are elicited for characters pushed  beyond human boundaries and endurance.
 It resembles Treasure of the  Sierra Madre (another excellent film), but caves in to none of its happy  endings, higher ideals, saving benedictions. All here is carried out in a  quiet desperation as every vestige of hope, purpose, escape are  systematically sabotaged. All that is left is the moment, and survival. The  scenes on the bridge, the oil pond, the road, are among  the most  unforgettable in cinema. The characters strive for freedom but are  continually confronted with their interdependence and frailty. The  director's final gesture, in the face of potential victory,  provides a  seal of consistency to this sinister, masterful brew. Clouzot delves into  motivations, relationships, doubt. He challenges pat assumptions of life  and destiny. It is a remarkable and original film, even more so in the  context of the conventions imposed on Hollywood films of that era.",961027200,58,2311,5.226775956284153
29928,5,0780021932,"Easily one of the best ever thrillers made. Henri- Geroges Clouzot,  the French Hitchcock has crafted an edge of your seat thriller.  Although this movie was made in the  1950's Clouzot uses suspence  (visualally and  structurally) to grab the viewer by the throat and  takes you on the ride of your life. Four losers are recriuted by an oil  company for a suicide mission. The have to  carry nitroglycerine over  300 miles of ragged  road. Will they all make it? Who knows. A must  for any thriller fans.

The whole cast is perfect but Yves Montand stands out as  Mario, his determination and tenacity are what makes this film gritty and  tense. Nail biting suspense, you're literally just waiting for the screen  to explode with nitroglycerine. The ending is also memorable and  appropriate. A must-see. Also see Clouzot's other suspense masterpiece  'Diabolique'. From a scale of 1-10 I give this film a 9!",958089600,3,567,4.864583333333333
29930,5,0780021932,Surely one of the most suspenseful films I have ever seen. One has to sit through the rather long prologue before getting to the mission of delivering the nitro. I did become somewhat impatient with Yves Montand's  partner though.  He's always threatening to desert from the group and has  to be coxed to return several times. I think I would have left this whiner  go. Anyone share this sentiment with me?,931305600,,406,4.676056338028169
29931,5,0780021932,"42. WAGES OF FEAR  (french-italian-thriller, 1953) A young Corsican, Mario (Yves Montand), an aging Parisian, a German and a fatally ill Italian are stranded (penniless) in a backward South American village. Close to the  edge of damnation they all desperately seek a way out. The owner of an  American-based fuel company offers the men $2 000 to transport 2 truckloads  of nitroglycerine over 300 (treacherous-mountainous) miles. Though the feat  is wrought with various dangers, the men are desperate to get their money  no matter what.
Critique: This is regarded as the greatest suspense  thriller ever made, and once you see it you'll probably agree. Director  Henri-Georges Clouzot adapted the screenplay from a novel by Georges  Arnaud, creating a totally realistic world full of poverty and despair. The  people living in this wretched part of the world aren't fazed, however, as  their spirits remain strong. The principal's efforts to rise above it all,  though heroic, prove ultimately fatal. Clouzot creates a couple of  tremendously unforgettable scenes: the men pushing their trucks over  dilapidated bridges, across mountains, road, and an oil well. Like no other  film since we feel the desperation and dismay the characters go through.  The ending is a bit of a letdown, further reinforcing Clouzot's theme of  destiny's hand being played.

29947,5,0780021932,"""The Wages of Fear"" lives up to its reputation as a thriller! Clouzot doesn't use any gimmicks to create tension. The longtense sequences are generated honestly. There is no music in the film until the very end. There is a lot here that reminds me of other films. The first 30-45 minutes remind me a little ofThe Deer Hunter. We spenda lot of time setting the scene and introducing the characters. It may seem toolong, but I think it is important toknow the characters. The very end has a sequence that reminds one of 2001: A Space Odyssey. It is hard not to think that Kubrickdrew from this. There is also a sequence that must have inspired Speed.

The stark and gritty monochrome film work is outstanding, on this Criterion re-release, and the soundtrack is crisp and very good.

29964,5,0780021932,"Four Europeans of varying ages are stuck in a poor Latin American village, but finally find the means to escape and make some much needed money too. A local American oil company is hiring truck drivers. The catch--and it's a big one--is that the chosen few must haul two loads of desperately needed, but unsecured, nitroglycerin over rugged jungle terrain and around mountains. One quote from Yves Montand's virile ""Mario"" sums up the situation: ""This truck isn't a rest home!"" For his and that of his companions will either carry everyone to fortune or to their funerals.

Don't look for lots of blockbuster, shoot-'em up--or perhaps ""blow 'em up"" is more apropos--styled action, as this black and white, French-Italian epic starts off a bit slow (channeling perhaps some of THE TREASURE OF THE SIERRA MADRE's attempts to establish a palpable sense of place). Director Henri-Georges Clouzot does eventually pick up the pace to deliver four fatalistic characters whose bravado melts faster than bananas flamb. For what starts out as a tantalizing job turns into a trek towards mostly unflattering self-discovery that's racked withsuspense and punctuated by a couple of genuine thrills--one of which qualifies as a literal cliffhanger!

Character-driven, with gritty realism and suspense that holds up most of the way, THE WAGES OF FEAR still stands as one of the 50's greatest dramatic adventures. C'est magnifique, M. Clouzot!",1459468800,2,1427,5.22707423580786

29966,5,0780021932,"My first encounter with the film of Henri Georges Clouzot was his ""Quai des Orfvres"" (1947).  I saw it on late-night TV and, being eight years old at the time, I didn't realize that what I was viewing was a much trucated American release under the title of ""Jenny Lamour"".  ""Quai des Orfvres"" is an exotic film with mixtures of suspense and mild eroticism with touches of police procedural and noir.  Then in my viewing experience came ""Diabolique"" (1955) a masterful blend of horror and suspense and a must-see for all fans of the genre.  At last I caught up with what many consider to be Clouzot's masterpiece ""The Wages of Fear"" (1953).  What struck me most about the three films was how different they were in subject matter although all three contained, in varying degrees, elements of suspense and thrills.  Though vastly different in content, there is definite style that punctuates his works.  But it's with ""The Wages of Fear"" that you experience the kind of knuckle-biting suspense and adventure that is nearly unparalled in film history.  This beautiful transfer by Criterion is the version to own as it presents the film in its original uncut form.  Don't miss this one!",1447718400,8,1182,4.811881188118812

29972,5,0780021932,"""The Wages of Fear"" is one brutally raw movie, considering it was made in 1953.  In spirit, it seems to have something in common with many testosterone-filled classics that came much later, like ""The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly"", all of Quentin Tarentino's movies, and ""There Will Be Blood""... in fact, any modern action thriller that reduces human nature to survivalism could be said to have its roots in this movie.

In the first part of the movie, we are introduced to a village in South America populated by hopeless men who can't find enough money to escape from it.  As in ""Casablanca"",  a motley bunch of adventurers and ne'er-do-wells from different parts of the globe have become stranded there.  No work is available, but one American corporation (the ""Southern Oil Company"") has fastened itself on the native resources of ""black gold"".  It should be noted that the film was made entirely in France, and the ""third world"" atmosphere was completely manufactured by the filmmaker.

Basically, none of the men in the village are trustworthy.  The few women who are present are treated like vassals, or pets.  But when a suicidal ""opportunity"" presents itself in the offer to drive trucks laden with nitroglycerine three hundred miles through rough terrain, all the riff-raff crawl over each other trying to win the prize.  Four men are chosen, though one mysteriously disappears and is replaced by a ""hungrier"" applicant.

Once the journey is begun, the only question that remains is whether any of the men will survive.

""Wages of Fear"" is wonderfully paced, with great black and white cinematography and fine acting.  It also has a few instances of nudity, although as was typical of the 50's, it's of the ""National Geographic"" variety---which means that only ""natives"" are shown au naturel.",1426464000,2,1800,4.9799331103678925
29973,4,0780021932,"Ok let's start with the good....this movie is very suspenseful. In fact, it's one of the best thrillers you will ever see, I swear. The acting is superb, and the storyline builds up well to the final third of the film, which is for the most part, masterfully done. I've read a great deal of critiques on the film which talk about how this movie was viewed as Anti-American. It's anti Capitalism, not anti-American. To this day, we see in the news media stories of how corporations continue to try and cut corners on their workers, particularly in the mining industry, where only five years ago 29 men died in a coal mine in West Virginia because profits were placed before safety. That happens now and it happened 60 years ago, so I think the story here is told in an honest way.

My problem with this film is the ending. I just feel that it was unnecessary, and too self-indulgent. I think Cluzot made his point throughout the film and the movie didn't have to end the way that it did. The ending felt forced, heavy-handed, and unnecessary in the context of the story. At least to me. Still, The Wages of Fear is very, very good.",1426118400,2,1130,4.4326923076923075

29977,4,0780021932,"Before watching THE WAGES OF FEAR, I was vastly more familiar with its Americanized remake  SORCERER, starring the terrific Roy Scheider.  Id seen it years ago on home video, and I wasn't even aware that it was based on something else.  Perhaps I shouldve been because my thoughts at the time were, This film is quite good, but it just seems to be missing something.  Well, that something turns out to be the dynamics of a stronger ensemble, which was definitely in place for the 1953 original.

(NOTE: The following review will contain minor spoilers necessary solely for the discussion of plot and/or characters.  If you're the type of reader who prefers a review entirely spoiler-free, then Id encourage you to skip down to the last three paragraphs for my final assessment.  If, however, you're accepting of a few modest hints at things to come, then read on )

From the product packaging: In a squalid South American oil town, four desperate men sign on a suicide mission to drive trucks loaded with nitroglycerin over a treacherous mountain route.  As they ferry their explosive cargo to a faraway oil fire, each bump and jolt tests their courage, their friendship, and their nerves.  The result is one of the greatest thrillers ever committed to celluloid, a white-knuckle ride from Frances legendary master of suspense Henri-Georges Clouzot.

I could belabor several thematic points if I thought it relevant, but honestly so much has been written on Clouzots THE WAGES OF FEAR that I don't feel Id have anything all that fresh, vibrant, and original to add to those specific areas; yes, the film is probably as dynamic today as it was back in the year of its release (1953), though Ive read that that theatrical version was heavily edited by censors, mostly in the United States.  After viewing this completed release by Criterion (derived from an earlier compilation by Kino International), I can certainly understand why the (U.S.) powers that be mayve taken issue with several sequences and even an entire character or two, but Ill also let those matters stand to history  or to anyone who wants to research that matter further on his (or her) own.

What remains essentially is a superb tale exploring primarily men and what they're driven to accomplish by any means necessary.  The WAGES from the title end up being more a psychological discussion than anything else  an aging gangster suddenly comes to grips with the realization that this job may be the death of him; a worker sick with a lung disease from his day job is willing to do anything to get out of his dire predicament; etc.  and Clouzot cleverly holds the trump card until the very end.  In between the set-up and the eventual conclusion is a wonderfully constructed journey of discovery for these characters, each one coming to grips with some fatal flaw of personality before all is said and done.

So far as this restored version holds up as its own vehicle, I found it just a tad bloated in the first half.  Clearly, Clouzot went out of his way to capture this world, these people, and the political climate of their times in the first hour.  As a consequence, there are long passages of sights and sounds that, while effective, were probably easy choices for censors to truncate.  This isn't to say that all of what gets explored in those first sixty minutes is either useless or the artistic conventions of a storyteller; rather its only to say that for this particular viewer they went on a bit longer than absolutely necessary.  The real meat of any tale of this sort is the conflict of people trying to accomplish a shared goal; thus, once these four men find themselves behind the wheel, WAGES takes off at an admittedly visually crawling pace but also a vastly more intellectual one.

As for the principal players?  The acting is deliciously top-notch.  Yves Montand lights up the screen in a starring, heroically tragic role; and Charles Vanel plays the aging gangster who discovers he aint as tough as he thought he was to perfection.  Peter van Eyck does a brilliant job as the almost Vulcan-like German who prefers using his brains to his brawn when put into a corner; and Folco Lulli fills the shoes of the jovial everyman with ease.  As an added plus, lovely Vera Clouzot (the directors wife) plays the small-towns resident gal-pal Linda, and shes just about as sexy as screen siren that ever came along in this secondary role.

THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) is produced by Compagnie Industrielle et Commerciale Cinematographique (CICC), Filmsonor, Vera Films, and Fono Roma.  DVD distribution for this release is being handled by the stellar Criterion Company.  For those needing it spelled out perfectly, this is largely a French and Spanish spoken language release, but theres plenty of other tongues (including English) sprinkled in throughout the film.  As for the technical specifications?  Wow.  This is one smart rendered flick, with some especially stunning cinematography for those who relish those kinds of things (I do).  Lastly, this Criterion release is fully loaded as most are, and the disc includes several interviews with production personnel and acting talent as well as a short or two exploring the films controversy; theres also an essay in the liner notes by novelist Dennis Lehane.

HIGHLY RECOMMENDED.  Despite some relatively heavy anti-American sentiments as well as some curiously (ahem) misplaced affections amongst a nearly all-male cast, THE WAGES OF FEAR remains a classic of screen bravado and cinematic tension.  Despite being over six decades old, the film holds up surprisingly well, and it certainly deserves wider study by those who would embrace both its message (both fear and fearlessness come at great costs) as well as director Henri-Georges Clouzots technique as a masterful storyteller.",1421712000,,5818,4.929230769230769

29999,5,0780021932,"In 1948, John Huston directed a famous film titled ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"" and all while watching Clouzot's film, I kept drawing parallels between the two - opposite parallels. While both films are about greed and down on their luck men desperate for a chance at a better life, Houston takes the negative tract and explores how ruthless men will be towards each other and ends his film with an almost puritan ethic of ""they got what was coming to them"".

In all, Houston's film is very American which is ironic in a way because Clouzot's film was criticized as being anti-American. Clouzot has a much more agnostic point of view concerning greed and desperate men. The men in The Wages of Fear are far from perfect, but they share a bond and recognize their common humanity. They know they are working for a greedy corporation (here it is a fictional American oil company named SOC) that is just using them as expendable labor. Though the film begins with many of them looking to gain the advantage over each other, through the course of the film they come to rely on each other, share their dreams with each other and expose their failings and weaknesses to each other. They know they could die at any moment and though they are never overtly philosophical about their situation, they recognize how fleeting their lives are and some of them even revel in that realization.

This is quite a devastating film. First of all, the tension of watching the two trucks loaded precariously with nitro-glycerin as they slowly wind their way through mountain passes (or, in one case, at top speed over a wash-boarded road) is palpable. You just never know what the next moment is going to bring, but you know danger is around every corner and over every bump. And the film carries this tension all the way through. Very few films have ever pulled this off (Spielberg's ""Duel"" comes to mind off the top of my head) but I wish more directors would explore this technique because it is breathless. Even though I started watching this film a little too late at night and was somewhat tired to start, I could not take my eyes off the screen.

Finally, unlike ""The Treasure of the Sierra Madre"", ""The Wages of Fear"" plays closer to our own times and seems more relevant. With economies faltering and people becoming more and more desperate for some financial security, the price we pay for a chance to get ahead not only rises, but also seems quite silly. In the end, when all is said and done, what is more important - a quick but dangerous dollar or the closeness of the human bond?

30005,3,0780021932,"Having seen ""Sorcerer"" back when I was a teen/young adult, (which I remember to this day as being an ""edge of your seat-er"" interesting & good  movie), I decided to try to get this movie after reading all the terrific & raving reviews about this ""original"" version. So on the reviews & advice of others here, I spent the time & money to finally get it.

After watching it however, all I can say is that whoever thought this was good, must have seen it as a very young child & remembered it a lot better than it actually was. (I can't wait until the revamped ""Sorcerer"" Blu-ray comes out in a few months, so I can see if it is as good as I remember it, or is just as bad as this movie/version was! (I suppose it is possible my childhood memory of Sorcerer is as ""Off"" as other people's memory of this movie was!)

Bottom line, my recommendation... don't bother seeing this version. While interesting to see movies & places from so long ago, it isn't enough to make it worth sitting thru this. The only character you like will be killed off, & the others will do things throughout the movie that make you realize that their dying & being killed off is simply justice. And if their cruelty towards others is not enough, their blatant stupidity & ignorant actions merits their being removed from the gene-pool!
In short, having risked everything, used others & treated them like garbage & made it thru horrific, life threatening events, the main character gets so overwhelmed with his survival & reward, that he gets reckless & just drives off a cliff!
NOT the plot of a great movie.

Watch for a future review of Sorcerer someday. When I am able to watch it again & check to see if I remembered that movie correctly, or decide to add it to this one, of the ""don't bother seeing"" group.
Sorry to be so harsh about this one, but it was NOT as good as it could have been, & certainly NOT as good as people here claim it is.

For one thing, with the horrible way the main characters treat others, I end up not caring if they live or die, as I begin to feel they deserve to die! Also, in the movie's climatic tense moments, like when taking horrible risks to maneuver the trucks thru an area that is supposed to be hard to get thru, it was blatantly obvious that they could easily fit thru the area without any risk at all! Even my wife asked ""What is wrong with these guys? What is so hard about making that corner, as there is enough room for even me to do it!""
And then when success is finally had, the idiot has a death wish! Making the whole trip (& movie) for nothing! (It was even hard to be concerned about him making it back to the ""bar-girl"" whom he didn't even care about in the first place!",1389484800,3,2694,4.2745098039215685

30007,5,0780021932,"This is probably one of the most powerful films of all time. It was made during the time of the French new wave and existentialism thus you can only guess at the ending, it probably has a Sartrean twist. So simple a story and yet so metaphorically rich, it weaves together an element that all humans share, mainly living with each other and death.

The direction and story line is flawless and I only wish it was longer to enjoy more the vibrant quality that this film has possessed. It deals with a South American town where people of all nationalities are stuck like flies on a glue paper. Everyone wants to get out but they don't have the means or money to, work is sparse. An oil fire occurs far away at one of the oil pumping stations and the only way to put it out is to ship Nitro to it in trucks. Noticing the danger of the job, many men risk their lives for a chance at destiny.

We have Yves Montand as Mario, a young thug who is cool and keen, he hooks up with Jo (Charles Vanel) as a tough guy old man who looses his bravery once it is put to the test in the desolate jungles and back road mountains. Peter van Eyck as Bimba, a man who is not afraid to die because he has already seen it in a Nazi prison work camp. Folco Lulli is Luigi, a kind hearted and durable proletarian who is dying of rotten lungs. In one memorable scene in the bar, he is given a gun by Jo and says he will not shoot him because, ""I am not a murderer"". These characters are merely human in all they represent, in their weaknesses, in their flaws. We can't help but endear to all of them. The driving scenes are some of the best ever, there is excitement only because the voyage is still unknown and perhaps there is a foreshadowing that these men might not make it.

30022,5,0780021932,"The Wages of Fear takes it's own sweet time to get going, but once it literally starts rolling, it grips you by the throat and doesn't let go. Starting out as a Treasure of the Sierra Madre-esque blackly comic tale of loafers hanging out in a backwater South American town where the roads are filled with potholes and the mangy mutts slink around by naked children, The Wages of Fear sets groundwork that elevates it above your average thriller: it has a relateable human element.

These are characters are fully realized and executed - hateable, lovable characters that, in time of peril (and the movie is FULL of times of peril), we relate with because they and their conflicts seem human in our eyes, and that makes the thrills all the more terrifying. But enough about that. Let's get to the thrills!

And there are thrills aplenty. Once more, Henry-Georges Clouzot draws positive analogies to Hitchcockian suspense sequences such as those in Rear Window, only on a much larger and terrifying scale. The films nail-biting premise means even a bump the size of an orange could make a crater 200 feet in each direction. Clouzot's brilliant camera techniques put you right in the cabin of 10 tonne behemoths - literally primed to explode. Prepare for scenes so tense and brilliantly filmed you'll exclaim in horror.

Prepare for sequences that will grip you by the throat and pull you to the edge of your seat. Prepare for razor-sharp tension between partners who don't know whether they can trust each other or not. Rickety bridges, trees, giant rocks, narrow roads! Double-crossing partners! Explosions! Nitroglycerine! Prepare yourself for one of the best thrillers ever made!

A climax so disturbing and dark you'll never forget it. An ending so shocking and brutal you can't help but gasp in amazement! Brilliant psychological drama and chemistry! Existentialism and heartbreak, perseverance and desperation! This is Henri-Georges Clozout's The Wages of Fear - a blackly comic, dark, terrifying, and action-packed ride of a lifetime. Often imitated, never bettered.

Do not miss out! 5 tonnes of nitro out of 5!",1384473600,2,2117,5.01994301994302
30023,4,0780021932,"I enjoyed Wages of Fear, but not as much as I expected to. I first saw the movie a long time ago, and I remember thinking that the first half-hour was kind of slow, but the rest of the movie was great. Seeing it again a few days ago, I'd have to revise that opinion. The first half hour isn't especially suspenseful, but it does set up the story well. A group of waylaid, desperate losers are stuck in a remote South American town, trying to find a way out.

Seeing a very young Yves Montand at the beginning of his career is certainly fun. The other characters (including Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, together with a multi-national, multi-lingual supporting cast) are well-chosen and move the tale along nicely.

The suspense that made Wages of Fear such a hit in the '50's builds toward the middle of the film, as many of the guys accept an offer to drive flasks of nitroglycerine along bumpy, treacherous mountain roads in order to reap $2000 rewards.

The trouble with the movie isn't really its own fault. It's ours. Most of us have been raised on far more intensely suspenseful films over the past few decades. Spoiled, you might say. So Wages of Fear, while a pleasantly enjoyable movie, just doesn't feel as ""edge-of-the-seat"" now as it must have 60 years ago. Maybe we've become too jaded. There was a point when I couldn't help saying to myself ""You know, this whole tension thing is based on a bunch of cheap props (the supposed flasks of nitroglycerine) that probably have water in them,"" In other words, the film is a little dated and not 100% convincing now.

There are undoubtedly reasons to see the movie. For one thing, Henri-Georges Clouzot was a fascinating director who bears comparison to Hitchcock. For another, the whole plot is so pleasantly weird for its time, and even today. As a ""history of cinema"" type movie, it also has its appeal.

30030,3,0780021932,"I must admit I'm always a tad suspicious of any foreign movie that gets the artsy critics all excited.  However, I tried to approach The Wages of Fear with an open mind, since I like some of Clouzot's other movies, such as Diabolique.  Critics rave about how suspenseful The Wages of Fear is.  Hardly.  Certainly the premise - four losers driving two truckloads of nitroglycerin across a treacherous mountain road - looks promising, but the moments of suspense are few, and frankly there is more nail-biting suspense in a movie like Speed than in this flick.  On top of that, the movie spends more than an hour setting up the plot, with lots of little episodes showing that the four losers are, yep, real sleazebags, and what's more fun than spending two hours of your life with four sleazebags?

However, I must admit the movie weaves its own kind of spell.  It was possible to forget I was watching actors, as the movie gives the impression that this dirty little El Podunco town in South America really does exist, and that these low-lifes are real people, with real dirt and sweat clinging to them.  The four main actors are quite good, especially Charles Vanel as an aging gangster who still tries to hold on to his pride and arrogance even though he knows he is well past his prime (and a coward to boot).  Yves Montand is good as the cocky Mario, and his long and tense ride in the truck with Vanel shows the two men alternately liking and hating each other.  I wish the two other characters, one Dutch, one Italian, were more fully developed, as they seem more likable than Montand and Vanel, but Clouzot seemed determined to focus on the nasty and not the nice.  Clouzot's wife Vera gives a good performance as a pushed-around yet spunky cafe worker who tries to find a little joy in this hellhole.  On the other hand, the American characters - all employees of an oil company (boo, hiss) - are like capitalist caricatures from some really bad Soviet propaganda movie from this period.  The director apparently wants us to like the multi-ethnic people in this fleabag town, but he clearly despises American capitalists, whom he depicts as corrupt and insensitive.  (I read somewhere that, when the movie was first released in America in the 1950s, some of these anti-American scenes had been deleted.  Too bad they put them on the DVD, as they add nothing to the story.)

I wouldn't dream of giving away the ending, except to say that any French movie from the 1950s is bound to be a downer, since the French elites were all caught up in existentialism, that really profound and life-enhancing philosophy, which can be summed up as ""Life's a b*tch and then you die.""

Not an ""up"" movie, and not all that suspenseful, but it isn't dull, and if you can overlook the nasty caricatures of Americans, the acting is quite good.",1374969600,,2830,4.628

30044,5,0780021932,"This is an existential thriller.  Certain loose characters are trapped by lack of funds and transportation in a South American town (Las Piedras) dependent on an American oil company for what little economy it has. The anti-hero protagonist is Mario, a Corsican, who has drifted into town, rooming with an Italian mason Luigi,and having an affair with Linda, a local woman who works as an assistant to a barkeeper. Once the hellish boredom of the town has been established through the arrival of a French criminal named Jo, whom Mario shows around town, comes a circumstance that will allow four of the men sudden wealth--enough money to escape from Las Piedras and begin a new life.  The oil company needs four men to drive two trucks filled with nitroglycerine over some rough terrain: rough roads, swamps, across wooden suspension bridges, over mountains, around sharp curves.  The men will earn a year's pay for the one trip.  Mario, Jo, Luigi, and Bimba (a German expatriate) take up the challenge.  The director created scenes that are meaninglful and drive the plot.  The characters are interesting.  The tension becomes excruciating during the trip.  The film is wonderfully cast--no one seems out of place, the setting is vivid, and the camera work is outstanding and contributes to the conflict and tension.

This cerebral, tense and gritty suspenser by Clouzot, who was acclaimed for his intelligent, intense thrillers-- he also created&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Diabolique-The-Criterion-Collection/dp/0780021940/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Diabolique: The Criterion Collection</a>&nbsp;--took home the Grand Prize at the 1953 Cannes Film Festival, and won a British Best Film Oscar.

The viewer finds himself in a poverty-stricken, decrepit, hopeless village, in a country that appears to me to be Venezuela, in the remotest of South American jungles. The American ""Southern Oil Company,"" for which, I think you can read ""Standard Oil,"" is fighting a fire at an even more remote oil field.  It must urgently get supplies of volatile, hair-trigger nitroglycerine there to help put out the fire. It hasn't prepared for such an eventuality; it doesn't have the proper trucks.  (And, of course, power steering had not yet been invented: it took strength to drive a truck in those days.) Furthermore, the roads are treacherous, and the slightest jolt can lead to the explosion of the truck and the death of its drivers.  So the company offers to pay $2000 a man, a small fortune there and then, to any four desperadoes who will try to deliver the supplies in the two best trucks it has. It selects men from among the penniless local European drifters: a tense rivalry develops between them on the road.

The drivers are: Mario, a Parisian, perhaps the most accessible of the quartet, played by Yves Montand (<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Jean-De-Florette-Manon-of-the-Spring-MGM-World-Films/dp/B0009P7EI2/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Jean De Florette / Manon of the Spring (MGM World Films)</a>), who I think made his look of wifebeater undershirt and scarf tied around his neck almost as famous as the picture.

And in the other truck, we have Bimba, who spent several years in the Nazi salt mines, at gun point, as played by Peter Van Eyck(<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/The-Bridge-at-Remagen/dp/0792843576/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">The Bridge at Remagen</a>).  Finally, the fourth man, Luigi, (Folco Lulli), cheerful, singing Italian baker. Linda, a local girl, is played by Vera Clouzot, the director's wife, who also played an important part in the director's famous DIABOLIQUE.  Her part here was probably written for her, and the movie could just as well have done without it, but she does wear a memorable horizontal-striped shirt as she scrubs floors, and does give us some welcome feminine breaks in the midst of the testosterone-fueled competition.

Clouzot has given us a powerful, character-driven action film here.  Acting and photography are stripped down to the basics, still, a viewer can feel the heat and humidity of the jungle and the dangers of the road.  Moreover, although some modern viewers might find it a little slow, once those trucks get going they hardly stop. The film's minimal score, which contributes to the mood, was written by Georges Auric. The American William Friedkin remade this picture as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Sorcerer/dp/078322947X/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Sorcerer</a>, starring Roy Scheider.  Scheider's not bad, and neither is the picture, but it doesn't function in the same universe as the original.

30051,5,0780021932,"I can't believe I made it to my late `40s before seeing THE WAGES OF FEAR.  What a great movie!

Set in the 1950's, in some nameless South American country, in a poverty stricken village where jobs are hard to come by, and the few there are seem to be provided by the Southern Oil Company, a big, heartless American company.  We meet a group of foreign expatriates who spend their days hanging around the local cantina, frequently with so little money that they must share a single soda between them.  There are Frenchmen, Italians, Germans & Spaniards.  They are rascals and vagrants.  It's never explained why they are there, but we get to know them and just as importantly, we get the social context of the town and society they inhabit.  Half-naked children playing with roaches, bugs and humidity weighing oppressively on the women doing laundry in puddles and men sitting on porches on decrepit furniture.  And through it all, Americans zooming around in jeeps, plowing right through mud and spraying it all over the citizens without caring.

And when an oil well 300 miles away begins to blaze, the American bigwigs decide they need to hire 4 desperate locals to drive two trucks loaded with nitroglycerin across extremely treacherous roads to the site of the burn so the well can be capped.  And four of the men we've gotten to know are selected for the job, even though they're told they've got ""less than a 50/50 chance of making it.""

It takes an hour for the first truck to pull out of the compound, but we're primed for a tense journey.  And WAGES OF FEAR delivers.  The slightest bump could blow a truck to kingdom come.  So we watch the tension weigh heavily on these four men.  Yves Montand is Jo, the cocky Frenchman whose mischievous, winking attitude is quickly tested when the reality of what he's engaged in starts to sink in.  Next to him is Jo (Charles Vanel) a loud-mouthed, bossy Frenchman who has become friends with Mario but who is quickly shown to be ill-suited for the job at hand.  In the other truck are a steely German and a talkative, easy-going Italian.  What follows are a series of set pieces that will test the resolve of these men and seriously tests the nerves of the viewer.

I had heard that this was a tense, exciting film...but I turned it on with skepticism, because it is from the `50s, and we've seen a lot of exciting movies since that time.  I am happy (although exhausted) to say that the final hour and twenty minutes of the film are about as nerve-wracking as any I've seen.  The physical danger plays off against the tensions between the men.  The movie never abandons character, even as we sit on the edge of our seats, yelling at the screen.  It's amazing how knowing that any second a truck could explode and evaporate two of our lead characters can put one on edge.  I don't want to give away much more about the specifics...you can discover for yourselves the trials these men must endure.  But I have to say that the scene when a giant boulder in their path must be removed is 15 of the most ridiculously tense movie moments I've experienced.  Parts of it are almost unwatchable.

Director Henri-George Clouzot has made a film of great power.  He's trying to say something disparaging about big oil and American ""imperialism"" but he's certainly far more interested in exploring the dynamics of men under pressure.  He puts to shame most summer blockbusters that create cardboard caricatures where we can predict in advance who will live and who will die.  He introduces us to four interesting, fully realized characters.  Most of them are far from admirable...they are scoundrels.  But as their journey strips them down to their essential humanity, we feel great empathy.  The movie has a slower pace...but this gives us plenty of time to stew in our tension!  It's two and a half hours of black and white and subtitles...but there's no excuse to avoid this film that truly lives up to the adjective ""classic.""

All you are doing is looking at that freaking screen. Wow. Most of us have been weened on violence and blood and tension since we could walk.

30055,5,0780021932,"I just watched THE WAGES OF FEAR on BLU-RAY and must admit though it was very good, I still don't see how people can say it was better than William Friedkin's 1977 SORCERER. Friedkin added all of the elements of WAGES into his film and more, such as: The dubius backgrounds of the four men who are trapped in the God-forsaken South American country, how they ended up there, and how they must now find a way out by any means possible, even if it's driving two broken-down trucks filled with unstable nitroglycerine across 218 miles of rugged terrain, not knowing who they can trust.

Their desperation leads us to understand why they would volunteer and accept this suicide mission; If they want their lives and loved ones back, THEY HAVE NO CHOICE BUT TO GO, a plot point that is lacking from THE WAGES OF FEAR.

Both films boast a great international cast, great location shooting, and tough, no-nonsense, tight, gritty direction from two great film directors who are themselves the stars of their films.

With THE WAGES OF FEAR you get:
A great intense original story, filmed in glorious black and white and presented in it's original aspect ratio of 1.37:1, the standard at the time(1953), and presented by Criterion in pristine condition with plenty of extra's. You get real explosions (no special effects here), a white knuckle ride, Spectacular cleavage shots of the lovely Vera Clouzot, a shock ending, and you get to see Yves Montand go from French singing star, to leading man status all in one film due to Henri-Georges Clouzet's guidence and masterfull direction.

With SORCERER you get:
A great re-telling of a great story, told coldly, harshly, with real explosions (no special effects here), more intensity, more scope, more violence, color, Roy Scheider, Tangerine Dream, Mafia, Bandido's, a haunting ending, all by the man who brought you THE EXORCIST, THE FRENCH CONNECTION, and TO LIVE AND DIE IN L.A.. What's not to like?

Roger Ebert named SORCERER one of the ten best movies of 1977.

A BUDGET OF 22 MILLION, IT EARNED AN ESTIMATED 12 MILLION
This film had the unfortunate luck of being released less than one month after the first STAR WARS movie was released, while the country was still buzzing over ROCKY, which may have led to SORCERER's  box office disappointment.  Another reason was that many critics unfairly panned SORCERER probably because of Friedkin's audacity to recreate a classic (apparently a no-no at the time), which is funny in this day and age of remakes and re-imaginings. At any rate, this film is now much more accepted and appreciated among critics, garnering an 80 percent approval rating at ROTTENTOMATOES.COM.

WIDESCREEN/ FULLSCREEN
My problem is that SORCERER was filmed (according to the Internet Movie Database) in the aspect ratio of 1.85:1 and NOT the 1.33:1 pan & scan DVD version available today. As of this date (June of 2010) HIGH-DEF DIGEST has listed SORCERER on their docket of films to be released on Blu-Ray, however, they give no date, or even year, so, I will continue to wait patiently for the Blu-ray.

FYI; 2012 marks the 35 anniversary of SORCERER.

But if you want my opinion on which to buy; collect both. They're both great films from two different era's. The Criterion edition of THE WAGES OF FEAR on Blu-Ray is excellent, but definatly wait for SORCERER to be released on Blu-Ray.

Finaly I just want to suggest, as of rule of thumb to ALL filmakers who are seeing their films re-released in Blu-Ray, Do what you will to update your film, whether it be cropping, changing the aspect ratio, adding or deleting scenes, etc..., but alway's alway's ALWAY'S give us the original theatrical release as well. Yes it's that important, and I don't mind paying extra for it.

30057,5,0780021932,"This 1953 pic. is one of the great epics, alongside Apocalypse Now, Lawrence of Arabia, The Treasure of Sierra Madre; even Greed.

The setting for La Salaire de la Peur is the gritty, barren town of Las Piedras (The Stones), an unbearably hot, no-hope wilderness where easy women, fortune seekers, ex-cons and reprobates are stuck way beyond the pale. Everyone's either inert or desperate to flee this Spanish-American hellhole. The ones who work at a nearby oil concern are trucked in either maimed or dead. The living do little more than quarrel, spit and swear.

Sex and women are prominent in the first part of Henri-Georges Clouzot's grand quest. Very much a man's world, it's an overt, complicated kind of sex - at first taking the slinky form of an innkeeper's slave/plaything (Vra Clouzot) who in turn lusts after the attentions of Mario (Yves Montand). Mario's interested, but only to a point; he is being kept in idle leisure by a man who cooks for him and sings and dances. Complicating things further in this underlying homoerotic theme, Mario is then dazzled by the arrival in town of Jo, a man's man with a cocky swagger to match his shady past. They collude to escape their hell through a risky venture, but Jo cracks under the pressure. Mario is crushed, and then turns disturbingly violent.

Montand stars, and, in her first role, Clouzot's sylph-like wife Vra has a brief but highly charged part, making the most of her slender assets. The other striking performance is by Charles Vanel, who as Jo handles a stunningly broad range. Not quite up to that standard, Montand all the same holds his own. Until then, he had been a crooner searching for a better niche, and this project gained him respect. Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli deliver solid performances in more straightforward roles.

The last half, a desperate attempt at a kind of escape, is a suspenseful masterpiece. It's a stark look at human politics, opportunism and greed, and the characters don't do well. Even so, when pushed beyond endurance the pessimism lets up briefly: even the most ignoble deserve compassion, even some admiration. Once the struggle is over, the instinct is satisfied for that something redeeming - as in The Treasure of the Sierra Madre - although it's fleeting. Nothing like the long draught of bliss that John Huston gave his old geezer in that earlier masterpiece.

The characters are universal, as is the dialogue: not only in French and Italian, but German, Spanish (Mexican-scripted but uttered with a Brazilian-Portuguese sibilance), and English (both British and American). It is surely among the most polyglot movies, although it never seems artificial or showy. Subtitling is idiomatic, so up to Criterion's standards.

There's too little of the music by Georges Auric, one of Les Six (Poulenc, Milhaud, Taillefere, etc.), excepting what strikes for a Hispanoamerican tavern feel. Unfortunately, most of the best is played out with the opening credits. This film was severely cut for the North American release, as McCarthyism was then raging, and these characters are, after all, struggling in the maw of US capital. It's at least as relevant today as back then.

Still, for all that its politics is bold and scathing, sometimes it comes across as near tame. Only one scene falls dead flat (""...9, 8, 7...""), but even there its ever-rising suspense - done thousands of times since - still rates a top accolade.

Art direction is masterful, as is Clouzot's easy hand for Welles-like long shots, especially near the start. Some day these movies will be seen again on the large screen, as they deserve.

Shot decades before I was born, I was initially a little skeptical of the rave reviews that the film received.  After experiencing it, I agree that the praise is totally deserved.

I honestly don't watch most of the classic movies shot during the 40's and 50's, mostly because some of them don't hold up well over time.  But like movies such as ""On the Waterfront"", Wages of Fear is totally raw and powerful, and had me on the edge of my seat for most of the movie.  The fear and tension in the film is so real you can almost touch it, and it's a shame that more directors of the present day don't take a page from the playbooks of Henri-Georges Clouzot and Georges Arnaud.

I watched the movie in Blu-Ray format, which made it a terrific experience.  Vivid blacks, and crisp details down to the drops of sweat on the nervous drivers.

Les Dioboliques was sexy, scary, thrilling and still is a fresh of breath air, even after the new wave has come and departed. Thank goodness! Any more new wave and I would have never found this wonderful film as I would have simply shut the door on french cinema and never look back (there are a minuet few that I have taken a liken to).

This is just a theory, but I have a suspicion that old movies that have been deemed ""classics"" get a much more benevolent treatment when it comes to reviews. Perhaps this may be due to nostalgia. I'm not bashing old movies in general. In fact, many old movies appear on my Top 100 Films list (Billy Budd, Fail Safe, Psycho, Ben Hur, It's A Wonderful Life, Zorba The Greek, The Virgin Spring, etc.) But like the vast majority of older movies, this film has acting that is way over the top (overacting) and dialog that is totally cornball. Some may rightly enjoy this campiness. I don't. Another distracting thing about this film is that there are plot sequences (particularly relating to their trek with the explosives cargo) that were simply illogical and seemed to be capriciously thrown in so as to create a foundation for a thrill/action scene. The films cinematography and art direction are wonderful and that's what will stand out in my memory of this film.

Set in a small South American desert town, director Clouzot does a wonderful job of conveying the smoldering heat and the desperation of the noncitizens who want nothing more than to just get the [...] out. The only way out is by getting a plane ride at the very small local airport, but none of the guy's who hang out outside of the local tavern can afford a ticket. There are no jobs to earn money, so they are just stuck in a purgatory of boiling heat.

Things look grim for the guys, but then a stranger (Jo, an ex-gangster) comes to town and soon the group is divided. Most of them hate the newcomer, but fellow Frenchman Mario mistakenly thinks that Jo is his ticket out and starts sucking up to Jo and even turns his back on his friend's in the process.

A oil fire erupts at an remote oil field and the oil company needs a truckload of nitroglycerin delivered in order to put it out. The job is way too dangerous to risk using their own unionized men so they offer the men who hang out at the cantina the job. Two men to a truck. Two trucks and $2,000 per person upon delivery.

I'm not going to give away anymore, but I think this film is excellent. Very suspenseful and like I said before the picture on the Blu-Ray is [...] amazing.

Criterion has done a fantastic job on the DVD transfer.  This is why you pay more for their films.  Criterion's restorations are the best in the business.

Director Henri-Georges Clouzot has created a tense absorbing drama which moves quickly along while still giving us full character studies of the principles.  The story begins in a small village near the Andes mountains in South America.  We meet drifters, thugs and con artists all struggling to obtain enough money to escape to a better life.  We meet the locals philosophizing on life or simply living, giving the others something to talk about.

When a job offer comes along, everyone wants in but the task presented is the transportation of nitroglycerin across rugged mountain roads.  4 men set out on some of film history's most intense sequences.  Through their struggles and fears, the men's characters are revealed almost to the bare bone.  We see the boastful become weak and the nonchalant morph into the most intense.  It's a journey of discovery, danger and death.  WAGES OF FEAR is one of the great films of French (or anyone's) cinema.

30072,5,0780021932,"There are two things often said about this film that I would like to strongly agree with: first, it begins rather slowly, and second, it really is one of, if not THE, most suspenseful films ever made.
The first third of the movie moves inexplicably slowly. I can understand many of the reasons why: the attempt to define the characters, to show their interactions with one another, to depict the quiet desperation of their lives to make it plausible that four men would undertake such an astonishingly dangerous job as hauling nitroglycerin over treacherous jungle and mountain dirt roads. Even granting all that, however, the start is by any standard really, really slow. And I suspect that of the people you encounter who proclaim the film a bore either gave up before getting to the good parts or never recovered from the slow start.

The most suspenseful film ever made? Some people assert that the film has been so overhyped along these lines that it would be impossible for any film to come up to one's expectations. There are two edges to this sword. I am far more impressed that despite being hyped as the most suspenseful film ever made, I was nonetheless utterly on the edge of my seat for most of the final 100 minutes. And if some of the scenes seem somewhat familiar, it is undoubtedly because of the score of films that have plundered this film for their own tension-filled scenes.

I have often thought that Yves Montand was, at his best, one of the more compelling performers of the last half of the twentieth century. He wasn't consistently successful internationally. Sometimes one or two decades would come between some of his greatest triumphs. To illustrate, I think Montand's two greatest film appearances were THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and JEAN DE FLORETTE/MANON OF THE SPRING (1986), only thirty-three years apart.

Many viewers are not comfortable with the very ending of the movie and I I have to agree somewhat. Nihilism was very fashionable in the early 1950s in European cinema. The ending, which seems completely unnecessary and not organically connected with the rest of the film, reflects less any inner necessity for a downer ending than the general mood in ""serious"" films at the time. So, in a sense, one could argue that this movie manages to be one of the great classics of cinema despite a slow beginning and an arbitrarily negativistic ending. Where the film shines is in the utterly riveting journey through the jungle and mountains.",1242518400,31,2472,4.8254716981132075
30073,5,0780021932,"One of the masters of serving up suspense and making it nearly unbearable is the French director Henri-George Clouzot, who curdled the blood of audiences with his somber ""Diabolique"" (1955), the film that inspired Alfred Hitchcock to make ""Psycho.""  Two years earlier, Clouzot made an extraordinary film that combined desperate men, a grimy Central American village, and a dangerous cargo.  This film, ""Wages of Fear,"" is available in Blu-ray on The Criterion Collection label.

The Southern Oil Company, which unofficially is in charge of everything in the impoverished village of Las Piedras, sends out a call for long-distance truck drivers.  To earn $2,000 each, the drivers must transport highly volatile nitroglycerine, needed to put out an oil fire, across treacherous terrain.  Through flashbacks and dialogue, we learn why each of the four men who volunteer is willing to risk his life for these wages.

The early part of the film establishes the characters of the four drivers.  With the exception of Yves Montand, the actors aren't familiar faces, and this contributes to the film's believability.  Clouzot tells us so much about the perils of the journey that we can't wait for the 300-mile drive to begin.  It is here that Clouzot fashions some amazing, memorable scenes as one obstacle after another impedes the trucks' progress.  Largely through visuals, with just bits of dialogue, Clouzot shows how the men's determination transforms to uncertainty and then to fear.  By then, it is impossible to turn back.  The men must either perish in the jungle or forge ahead.

""Wages of Fear"" runs 147 minutes but it is so engrossing, it moves along briskly.  The lead characters are not especially likable, yet the viewer cannot help but lose himself in the suspenseful, hazardous slog through inhospitable terrain.

 The Blu-ray edition contains a restored High Definition digital transfer, video interviews with the film's assistant director and Clouzot's biographer, a 1988 video interview with Yves Montand, a documentary about Clouzot, and a featurette about cuts made to the film for its American release.",1241395200,3,2119,5.243323442136498

In many ways, none of the characters are very likable, except maybe Luigi, yet you still are hanging on every movement to see if they make it to their destination.
With a generous running time of 2:30, the main characters are given time to develop.  The characters of Jo and Mario have an up-and-down friendship, as their flaws and strengths are tested.  I also liked the director's occasional use of natives in the scenes, many times it seems to be a commentary on what ""civilized"" man has brought upon the world.

30076,5,0780021932,"Iconic, vintage masterpiece in brilliant new transfer.

Criterion's restored hi-def transfer of Henri-Georges Clouzot's controversial, visceral and prescient thriller still grabs the viewer by the throat for a breathless, nihilistic ride.

This legendary  film of suspense and despair was deemed ""evil"" by Time magazine during its 1955 US release. Based on the harrowing 1950 book by George Arnaud, it's a cautionary tale of the true blood-toll of oil and greed.

Filmed in 1951 and first shown in France in 1952, ""The Wages of fear"" (Le Salaire de la peur) is about four European men at the end of their ropes.  In a hell-hole of a South American village, these desperate men accept a job from an American oil company to drive two trucks of unstable nitroglycerine along a treacherous mountain route to an oil fire.

Clouzot, who made less than a dozen films including the acclaimed ""Les Diaboliques"" and  ""Quai des orfevres""  never flinches from his vision.  Although the first half may seem a bit unfocused and meandering it is not because we get to know our characters, the squalid S.A. setting and the uncaring, greed-driven, business-as-usual of the American oil company.  The movie literally jump starts when the four hapless men hit the road in their two trucks overloaded with nitro.  We understand these men and we ride with them and their emotions.  Yves Montand, Charles Vanel, Peter van Eyck and Antonio Centa are terrific as the frantic, fraught drivers.

There's a lot of post WW II existential angst in this tale and that's not surprising.  After all, it is French and the ideas of Camus and Sartre permeate this film as they did the decade in which it was produced.

My only memory of this film was a washed out video tape copy with impossible to read subtitles and later a faded 16mm print in film school.

I've watched this Blu-ray version several times now and it is stunning.  It looks like a print that just came from the lab.  The black and white is crisp, with a wonderful range of grays -- velvety shadows to burnished silver.  And the subtitles are always easy to read and perfectly synched to the spoken French.  But more important, the rhythm and meaning of the spare dialogue remains.

This gritty film, devoid of sentimentality, follows men who live in fear.  They know death is coming and yet continue with the task at hand until the end.  Although my personal philosophy is not that of the drivers, it reminded me to relish the precious moments of life and to live it fully, bravely and in the moment.

This is one in the rather small handful of the greatest films in world cinema.  It has never looked better.  And it asks questions that are relevant today:  How desperate are we in our need for oil?  And what is the final price?  Highest recommendation.

30079,5,0780021932,"The Wages of Fear is perhaps the mother of all the Criterion movies that have been able to create a white-knuckle viewing audience. The story centers on a geographic region in South America, where oil company investors are exploiting the needs of the economically disadvantaged, which apparently make up a majority of the local population.

Many are looking for work, and when opportunity arises, they are essentially faced with the question: Just how badly do you want a job and the potential monetary rewards attached? So what is this offer that comes about? Well, let's say that there are two parts. One is easy, and the other is hard, with the higher degree of intensity applied to the latter. Now let's observe the breakdown.

The easy part is the money, which is a relatively paltry, but highly coveted, amount of two thousand dollars. Though this was a large sum back in the 1950's, it is diminutive by comparison to the perils regarding the hard part, which is the task itself. And just what is this insurmountable challenge? It is to meet one specific demand of an American oil company: transport two trucks full of nitroglycerin to a well fire by riding across 300 miles of neglected infrastructure on equipment that is every bit as dilapidated. Now are there any other questions?? As for how cognizant the keys players are, there might not be a soul present who knows the exact chemical nomenclature of nitroglycerin, itself, but they very well know its toxicity in the hauling process. If you spill it or agitate it, then BOOM! YOU'RE DEAD!!

As the movie progresses, there are four brave souls who have either the bravery or the insanity, or both, to undergo such a Russian roulette task. With each passing scene, sweaty brows, near nervous breakdowns, and infightings come to the surface. Aware of the continuous and continual, perils that these men are facing or could potentially encounter, the movie watcher can easily get clammy. In fact, one might be reminded of a particular event from years past that left him or her at the seat's edge. For me, I could only think of the coverage of Robbie Knievel's motorcycle jump over the Grand Canyon, which, in itself, was no joy ride.

So if you think that life and work are difficult, then The Wages of Fear just might shed a positive light on your circumstances in a way that a mere feel-good pill cannot. And for those who have been looking for a good scare after viewing a string of not-so-horror films, this motion picture will come closer to whetting your appetite. The cinematography and acting are great. Truly, Henri-Georges Clouzot was a filmmaking master in his own right.",1229990400,,2643,4.7894736842105265
30080,5,0780021932,"It's the rare thriller that will allow itself time to build effectively to leave a longer lasting impression.  Henri-Georges Clouzot's ""The Wages of Fear"" is that kind of a thriller--one much more deeply invested in bringing out the nuances of the character than the sensationalistic impulses to blow stuff up, but nonetheless creating gripping, stylistically gorgeous drama.

The story is about four men who are hired to drive two truck-fulls of nitroglycerin over a rocky mountain pass for use in extinguishing a oil rig fire.  The infamously unstable nitroglycerin results in one of the slowest albeit extremely tension-filled races against time ever filmed in cinema (forget ""Vertical Limit"", this is the real deal).  Every bump, every falling rock, every obstacle potentially becomes a life-threatening situation.  Of course Clouzot gleefully sets everything he can within the limits of reality in their path.

Of course, this main story begins after a long opening featuring the characters in a small, desolate South American town.  The objective of these opening scenes are two-fold: to develop the characters so that their emotional reactions to the ride are more fully significant, and to provide a strong political commentary on the actions of oil companies (especially Standard Oil) in the region.  A biting commentary it is, and no more distracting to the cause of the storytelling because of the way the characters are eventually treated.  Jo's story is, of course, the most interesting of all, as he pretends to stand as the more comfortable, capable man of the world only to become the most cowardly.  The beginning ultimately also justifies the ending.

Of course, the main character we focus on isn't actually all that likable, and what's interesting is that's the point.  Mario is abusive, self-centered, and rather narcissistic (though possibly not as much as the German fellow).  His own fate is rather more fitting to the ending than a lot of people complain; I've heard some say that the ending is unnecessarily dark; I had to think awhile about it, but considering the rest of the movie I have to disagree.

This is a movie that many film-buffs and up-and-coming filmmakers should make an extra effort to see.  It's the type of movie that takes what is an almost shockingly simple premise and turns it into an intricate, involved character study, social drama, political commentary, and genre thriller film, all at once.  It also shares aspects with Clouzot's famed noir ""Le Corbeau"".  That would be another movie to check out.

30081,5,0780021932,"Think that space invaders, aliens, dinosaurs, cyborgs, or monsters of one sort or another are needed to make a film a thriller? If so, I recommend you watch Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1953 black and white masterpiece The Wages Of Fear (La Salaire De La Peur), about the evils of runaway greed and capitalism, all in the name of oil. It'll change your mind. Over half a century later, and in light of the current American war folly for oil in the Middle East, the film is remarkably resonant and cogent- even down to the loudest criticism of American profiteering and imperialism coming from....the French. However, when they're right they're right. If one wants to know why `Ugly Americans' are loathed in the Middle East it's not because of the rhetorical claptrap about a `clash of cultures', nor Evil vs. Freedom, but because of decades of exploitation where a select group of mainly American corporations, unanswerable to anyone, get rich off of exploiting the masses where they swoop in. It happened in the Middle East, as well as in Latin America- perhaps the only place in the world where anti-Americanism (really anti-American corporate imperialism) rivals or surpasses that in the Middle East. As a minor character in the film rails, `Wherever there's oil, there's always Americans.' But, if all this film were was an anti-American screed it would still not grip viewers today. What it is, is a great portrait of the extremes that human beings- ok, men, will go to just to have things, and to what lengths their machismo will drive them.
  The film's screenplay was adapted by Clouzot and Jrme Gronimi (Clouzot's brother Jean's pseudonym) from a novel by Georges Arnaud, and, despite its nail-biting nature, as well as Clouzot's reputation as `the French Hitchcock'- aka `The Master Of Suspense', for such great thrillers as Diabolique (Les Diaboliques), this film is far beyond merely the technically great cinema that was Hitchcock's stock in trade. That's because it is not merely well made, but provokes deep questions about the fundamental nature of existence, human nature, and fraternity. It's far closer to something like John Huston's The Treasure Of The Sierra Madre (although it's a greater film), and its influence can be seen in many later films, such as Sam Peckinpah's The Wild Bunch- in an opening shot of a naked child torturing cockroaches on a string, and Sergio Leone's Once Upon A Time In The West, when we experience a good few silent minutes of opening shots on the squalid Latin American town, Las Piedras, the film is set in, just to get ambience. Reputedly, the film was shot entirely over the course of a year, in southern France, in Camargue, with a few imported palm trees and cacti to give it a South American look, but one could not tell it from what is onscreen.
Clouzot is at his very best when drawing out the suspense, which, by definition, is the time between big events, the possibility of danger or horror, not the thing itself, which is usually anticlimactic. What the viewer imagines will always be more frightening than the reality, which is why the best suspense or horror films are usually those that are the least action-packed, show little of the monster, or are not dependent upon mere special effects. Yet, even when we know what will occur, the scenes are filmed so well as to draw the viewer in. This is particularly effective and true when Mario is shown slowly pulling the truck up off the bridge, and a metal hook from its side catches the bridge cable, and as the truck gets fully on the road, the bridge breaks below him. This sort of scene has been done many times before. Will it or will it not break? In a film as great as this, where all four main characters end up dead, to expect the cable to last is, at best, a crapshoot, or wishful thinking.
  It is the writing that sets the tenor of The Wages Of Fear, and what makes the suspense/thriller aspect of the film so great. Yet, what raises the film into the high art category is its blunt, simple, but never ham-handed, portrayal of the evils of corporate greed, and the sacrifice of human life so a select few can get rich, as well as the nihilistic despair that drives those who willingly play into their exploiters' hands. As rough as Clouzot is on the exploiters, he's even harsher on the meekly hypocritical exploited. Let Politically Correct Hollywood try that in one of their didactic screeds, and maybe there will be hope for American film. Till then, The Wages Of Fear should always find gainful employment in a cineaste's library.",1221955200,,4556,4.763291139240506
30082,5,0780021932,"This is one of the greatest French films ever made, and arguably the most nail biting suspense filled film ever made.  Even today the tension this film creates is masterful, and its story about exploited oil workers and the cruelty of man hasn't dated one bit.  I would hate to see this film remade today, as they would litter it with CGI effects and destroy the integrity of Clouzot's film.

The film is masterful in its setup.  The first 30 minutes or so are just about the four main characters.  They are all living lives of desperation, trying like hell to get out of a s****y, South American town (even though the locale is never actually named).  They don't work, they're bastards (one character is seen throwing rocks at a chained dog), and they're cruel to women and each other.  An explosion at a nearby oil refinery occurs, and in order to put the fire out, they have to drive 2 trucks of nitro glicerine across incredibly treacherous roads.  The money they will get from the job will rescue them from the small section of hell where they live.

The tension of the journey is so nervewracking and the tension between the men so real that you just want to scream sometimes at the screen.  This film was heavily cut when it premiered in the US.  The scenes that were cut were the ones showing the machinations of the oil company, which was an American company.  Honestly, the scenes are not anti-American at all.  Many European and Asian countries also own oil firms, and you can easily replace Shell Oil with Yukos, for example.  Greed knows no nationality.  But now Criterion has the complete version, and the film hasn't dated at all.  The film was remade by William Friedkin as Sorcerer.  Friedkin's film isn't as good as Wages of Fear, but as far as remakes go, it's a damn good film with some amazing scenes of its own.

30086,4,0780021932,"The Wages of Fear (Henri-Georges Clouzot, 1953)

Widely considered Henri-Georges Clouzot's finest film, The Wages of Fear is the story of four poverty-stricken men hired by a rapacious oil company to transport two trucks full of nitroglycerin over three hundred miles of very bad road to an oil well fire. And for what it's worth, the film is very good at what it does; the problem, from the point of view of someone watching it over half a century after its original release, is that it would be very hard to see this film without having heard much of the hype about it beforehand. (One would have to avoid most reviews of the movie, as well as the copy on the DVD case. This is, of course, well nigh impossible.) While it is, in fact, a thriller, it takes more than a few minutes to get rolling (in fact, in the 148-minute restored edition, the guys aren't hired by the oil company for over an hour). Because of this, it seems there are actually two movies here-- one about life in poverty in a nameless South American town (and we've seen that one before, except it was called The Treasure of the Sierra Madre), and one about transporting nitroglycerin. The second is the better work by far, an interesting and engaging portrait of four friends and how the stress of the job tests their friendship as much as their nerves. I'm not terribly sure I'd call it a thriller as much as a simple drama; still, it's well worth your time if you're looking for a good, long movie to get yourself absorbed in. *** ",1180137600,2,1505,4.469090909090909
30087,4,0780021932,"""The Wages of Fear"" was awarded by unanimous verdict the Grand Prix at 1953 Cannes Film Festival where it won over 27 films, some of which were made by Jacques Tati, Alfred Hitchcock, and Luis Bu&ntilde;uel. Cluozot's own screenplay (based a novel by George Arnaud) focuses on four down-and-out European adventurers (Yves Montand, Folco Lulli, Peter Van Eyck, Charles Vanel) who stuck nearly penniless in a festering town in an unnamed South American country. An oil company need a load of highly dangerous and explosive nitroglycerin to be delivered to a remote well fire 300 miles away burning out of control. The route is through jungles and over crude and treacherous mountains and those men are desperate enough to take the chance. None of these men is heroic or generous, they are in for the money. The four were chosen by the managers of oil company because ""if something happens to them, no one would care, they have nobody to worry about them"". Henri-Georges Clouzot's view on humanity is not particularly optimistic but he finds a way to make a viewer care about disenchanted but desperate characters. Thanks to Clouzot's ability to create not only a gripping action film but a powerful study of failure, the four men will stay for long time in our memory.

Given that possibility we see men in this film squander such moral prospects repeatedly for wanton worldly and almost childish pursuits.

30091,5,0780021932,"30 years ago while stationed in England I caught the last half hour of ""Wages of Fear"" on BBC. Although I did not know the name of the film, it made such a favorable impression that I kept looking for it once I got back to the world; but it was never shown on American television. When William Friedkin made ""Sorcerer"" I was able to connect the dots and put a title to my elusive film.

In many ways Henri-Georges Clouzot's film is a bridge between the Italian Neorealism of the early 1950's and the French New Wave of a few years later. Even more obvious is its link to early Hollywood Renaissance directors Arthur Penn, Sam Peckinpah, and Stanley Kubrick. Peckinpah pays homage to ""Wages of Fear"" with a similar introductory scene in ""The Wild Bunch"" and again in ""Straw Dogs"". Kubrick does it with ""The Blue Danube"" waltz in ""2001"", juxtaposing exterior shots of the moving space station with interior views of the stewardess serving a passenger (just as Clouzot cut between the truck cruising down the road and the party back in town). Penn was a little less obvious but the violent shifts between comedy and tragedy in ""Bonnie and Clyde"" can be traced back to a similar narrative technique in ""The Wages of Fear"".

Most of the criticism about ""The Wages of Fear"" comes because Neorealism presents a more stylized reality than classic Hollywood narrative. The intent is to bring the ordinary features of the world into better focus by exaggeration. Expressionistically imitating reality while announcing that what is being shown is not real, the belief being that the more real the imitation the more fraudulent. Thus the use of narrative techniques that actually call attention to themselves. So the process of Jo (Charles Vanel) becoming a hero to Mario (Yves Montand) is shown through a montage of brief disjointed moments of connection. And Mario's journey from idolizing Jo to disillusionment and back to idolizing is much the same.

Jo, Mario, Bimba (Peter van Eyck), and Luigi (Folco Lulli) are desperate men stranded somewhere in South America (probably Venezuela). They need money to escape so when an American oil company offers $4,000 to each pair of drivers willing to transport a ton of nitroglycerin (300 kilometers over poor roads) to a burning wellhead, they sign on for the job. Death could happen at any moment and the reactions of each man along the journey is compared and contrasted with what the viewer learned about them back in the village during the first half of the film. There is a certain foreshadowing as it is pointed out at the start that this is the kind of intense task where even the survivors will be permanently scarred emotionally.

The four are not heroes, just a mixed group linked by a willingness to value themselves at only $2,000. The oil company (an American one) is able to operate in this remote region because there is plenty of manpower who share this mindset. The film is more anti- capitalist than anti-American and whatever political message it had in 1953 is more generic today.

The cinematographer, Armand Thirard, keeps things claustrophobic throughout; in the dead- end town and in the cab of each truck.

Clouzot sets up his most suspenseful sequence, where the trucks must back up on the unstable wooden platform in order to get around a hairpin bend, by having the first (smaller) truck narrowly succeed, heightening the tension as the bigger truck attempts the same maneuver.

What establishes this as European art cinema is its willingness to break primary film conventions. Clouzot was free from the need for a happy ending and could let anything happen to his characters. Conventional narrative required that a character's narrow escape early in the film was because he had a purpose later in the story, but that is not the case with ""Wages of Fear"". You first realize the power this gives Clouzot when a stray rock rolls down a hillside toward a Jerry can filled with nitro. In this film such an ironic anticlimax is actually a real possibility.

If you liked the original ""Flight of the Phoenix"" you will enjoy this film. And if you are a Peckinpah fan it is a must watch.

30092,5,0780021932,"We can thank the Movie Gods that Jean Gabin didn't want to play a coward or else we'd never have had Charles Vanel's superb performance in Clouzot's The Wages of Fear: it's notable that Friedkin's intriguingly feverish but suspense-free remake didn't even attempt to give its equivalent deadbeat killer a similar arc, despite the fact that the character and his curious shifting relationship with Yves Montand cuts to the very core of the story's take on the nature of courage, bravado and machismo. At the beginning of the film Vanel is the tough guy who can walk the walk, while Montand is his puppy doggish sidekick, throwing over his best friend for his new crush until his feet of clay are revealed when the chips are down. Even in a place where, in the absence of white women the white men cling to each other, this relationship seems to go a few steps beyond mere hero-worship, but when they hit the road the power in the relationship shifts, and in the process we get to watch Yves Montand become a genuine movie star before our very eyes, which is almost as exciting as the road trip to Hell with a truckload of unstable nitro and miles of very, very bumpy roads. Almost, because I doubt there's anything to beat the film's extraordinary double-jeopardy sequence on a rotting platform on a mountain road - a scene pretty much done for real - which takes your breath away until you suddenly realize that the second truck is going to have to do the same thing in even worse conditions... I remember when I saw that at a revival house a couple of years ago I genuinely forgot to breathe during that sequence, and found myself doing the same even on DVD.

Criterion's recent 2-disc DVD is a great improvement on their previous single-disc version in terms of picture quality and extras, but sadly, the `new and improved' subtitle translation is just as politically correct as the old one, dropping most of the obscenities and all of the racist language that's an important part of the hatred and self-loathing that drives the characters to risk everything for a chance for a ticket out of this backwater South American hellhole (amazingly recreated in the Carmargue in France because Montand refused to film in Fascist Spain).

It's interesting to see these four men in action and to wonder about what motivates them. Peter Van Eyck is the supposed tough guy, having endured life in a labor camp, but he turns out to be a coward. Falco Lolli is told by a doctor he only has a year to live. Charles Vanel is an old Parisian, and Yves Montand suffers from ennui at first, but then becomes totally driven by this insane endeavor. (Notice the four different nationalities.)

30095,4,0780021932,"When Henri-Georges Clouzot's ""The Wages of Fear"" made its way to the U.S. in 1953, the American distributor proceeded to hack out 20 minutes of a film in which pacing and momentum were key elements.

Still, film buffs had no problem locking into the tale of four expatriate losers who seek salvation by trucking crates of unstable nitroglycerin across 300 miles of Venezuelan badlands. ""Dangerous work. Good pay,"" the U.S. oil company promised, desperate to blow out a towering fire at its money well. Two trucks are dispatched for the suicide mission, their drivers cold-sweating every bump, every turn of the wheels.

 Even with the distributor's cuts, the film became known worldwide as a classic of throat-tightening suspense. ""Fear"" influenced generations of rough-and-ready directors such as Sam Peckinpah, who stole its opening scene of a boy torturing cockroaches for ""The Wild Bunch."" In 1977, William Friedkin remade ""Fear"" as ""Sorcerer,"" his gritty follow-up to ""The Exorcist."" He dedicated the film to Clouzot. (Universal released ""Sorcerer"" on DVD earlier this year; it's well worth watching despite the raggedy video.)

""Fear"" finally was restored to its original 148 minutes in the early 1990s. The Criterion Collection released the director's cut on laserdisc, and again on DVD in 1999 (without extras). Now Criterion's back in the driver's seat with a double-disc worthy of the film. The set boasts significantly upgraded audio/video and a bonus disc that tells the story of this remarkable film and its troubled director.

Clouzot said of his visual style, ""I always aim to accentuate the chiaroscuro, to oppose light and shadow."" The restored images amplify Clouzot's artistry, delivering dramatic contrasts and little grain. A fine-grain master was the source for the high-definition transfer. The black-and-white video (1.33:1, as shot) is pretty much free of age-related wear. The Dolby 1 audio also got a makeover. It's parked in the center speaker, but for fuller sound, ditch the surround.

The main extra is the Clouzot documentary ""The Enlightened Tyrant,"" made in 2004 for French TV. The disc also includes revealing interviews with assistant director Michel Romanoff and Clouzot biographer Marc Godin. Also, Montand talks about his film career and working with Clouzot in a puff piece taped in 1988, a few years before the singer-actor's death. There is no commentary track, unfortunately.

The intentions of the U.S. distributor that cut up the film remain unclear, but the evidence in an extra about censorship points to political and social motives. Several missing scenes attacked American imperialism by dramatizing how the oil company valued crude over human life. Another deletion amplified the suggestions of homosexuality in the drivers' evolving relationships. And the removal of Clouzot's penultimate punch line -- a character dies seeing ""Nothing, nothing"" in the afterlife -- lessened the existential despair at the heart of the tale.",1132272000,9,2976,5.373390557939914
30096,5,0780021932,"This second transfer of Henri-Georges Clouzot's 1953 masterpiece, ""The Wages of Fear,"" improves upon the first, so it's worth replacing. It sounds better, looks cleaner, is less contrasty, and its extras meet our expectations from the classy Criterion Collection. The picture packs as solid a punch as it did in its European release, in its first Criterion edition, even in the censored film shown in America. Fifty minutes of cuts, mostly ""anti-Americanism"" and hints of homosexuality, have been restored to this complete a version as we're likely to get.

Clouzot's reputation in America rests on two thrillers, this one and ""Diabolque."" Fans of the latter will grouse that in the extras the surprise ""Diabolque"" ending is shown, a disservice for viewers led to it after ""The Wages of Fear."" Alfred Hitchcock sought the book by George Arnaud but Clouzot got the rights first; later, after ""Diabolque"" opened, Hitchcock said that he admired that film, a rare compliment; he later contracted the ""Diabolque"" authors for their book ""The Living and the Dead,"" which he filmed as ""Vertigo.""

When Clouzot adapted Arnaud's novel he made changes, angering Arnaud; he added a non-role for his non-actress wife Vera (in the first of her three films for him.) Cabaret singer Yves Montand starred, igniting his screen career. Jean Gabin declined to play the coward played by Charles Vanel, whose performance won several acting awards. Peter Van Eyck and Folco Lulli complete the quartet of losers in a South American village. They are hired by American oilmen to drive two trucks of nitroglycerin 300 miles to douse a derrick fire.

Sam Peckinpaw borrowed the opening image, a child torturing insects, to open ""The Wild Bunch."" The first hour of village squalor sets up the desperate characters; the rest of the film follows their trek over treacherous roads with the explosive cargo. The suspense is excruciating and the set pieces perfection, among them trucks negotiating a hairpin turn and inching through a pool of oil. The film's genesis is conveyed in rare interviews and documentaries that come with this new transfer; they include an essay by ""Mystic River"" novelist Dennis Lehane and are as engrossing as the film itself.",1131148800,4,2222,5.115702479338843

'Criterion Collection' provides excellent transfers of movies and have planned to re-release 'Wages of Fear' in LATE 2005, with a better picture transfer and more added extras. If you are a serious cinephile and movie appreciator, you should wait to purchase the 2nd print of this film. The current Criterion release is the best transfer available, and far surpasses the poor pan & scan release by 'Universal'.

The current DVD transfer is above average, but the proposed new release by Criterion will promise to be excellent. Thus, unless you are an avid Criterion collector, I recommend you wait to purchase this excellent film until late 2005, as Criterion will fully honour the grandeur of 'Wages of Fear'.",1118707200,12,887,4.986486486486487
30100,5,0780021932,"I missed an opportunity to watch this movie several months ago.  When I had seen it listed on the upcoming schedule of a cable movie channel, I looked it up and it sounded like an outstanding movie.  It was several months before I had the opportunity to see it and, by that time, my expectations had sky-rocketed.  I knew that this was happening and I did my best to ignore this tendency but I was expecting to be on the edge of my seat constantly for slightly over 2 1/2 hours.  I wasn't but I did watch an excellent movie.

For me the strength of ""The Wages of Fear"" lies in its' portrayal of its' vagabond characters and its' analysis of courage (some might call it stupidity but I can't see spoiling a good thing with over-analysis).  The first half of the movie gives us a portrayal of the civilized vagabond in a third world country.  It's the best such portrayal I've seen since the opening portion of ""Treasure of the Sierra Madre"".  These characters are losers for the most part.  They can't aford to leave their meager existance and there doesn't seem to be much point in staying.  There is a sense of superiority that these men emote but we're given to know that there doesn't seem to be much to back it up.

Eventually, there comes a real challenge due to an oil well fire at an American oil company site 300 KMs away.  Nitroglycerine is needed to put out the fire and drivers are needed to get it there.  The representatives from that oil company realize that the best people for the job are amongst these vagabonds.  Ultimately four of them are hired to drive two trucks loaded with the deadly cargo through a rough road in the wilderness.  The movie then displays how these four men handle the death-defying challenges that confront them.  Now is a real opportunity for these men to back up their bluster.  I felt one of the characters was over-done in his plumeting fall from tough guy to wimpering coward.  A more gradual metamorphisis would have been easier to believe and would have left a better impression.  As for the other three, we see the emergence of their strength of character that had previously been left to rot in the gutter.  The suspense of this journey is real but it is not an unending white-knuckle experience.  The ending disappointed me although I understand what the director, Henri-Georges Clouzot, was trying to say.

Some might argue that the movie was at least 35 minutes too long and I considered that point.  However, I enjoyed the whole movie from beginning to end so I tend to discount that.  I rather enjoyed the portrayal of the American oil company people.  It was as though there were the vagabonds, the third world inhabitants, and the Americans as three seperate class of people.

This is an excellent movie that does a brilliant job and saying what it is trying to say.  Some may over-rate the suspense but I'm not sure they can over-rate the movie.",1118275200,5,2903,4.554054054054054
30101,5,0780021932,"What can I say? Simply brilliant at how director Henri-Georges Clouzot can transport you to the fields of Central America and make you feel the tension between the drivers of trucks loaded with highly volatile nitro-glycerine. Nerve wracking indeed. And the ending? Whoa, simply one of the best i've seen...ever. This classic really should be seen by all, even if you're one of those people who hate foreign films because you ""have to read subtitles"", just get over it. My rating: 9.5/10.",1117065600,2,488,4.963414634146342
30102,5,0780021932,"I love discovering a new great film. Preferably, I have just discovered the great film in a revival on a big screen (""Rififi"" anyone?), but video will do in a pinch. I just had the experience of viewing ""Wages of Fear"" for the first time. This is easily one of the best films ever made.

Henri-Georges Clouzot creates a film filled with white-knuckle, edge of your seat suspense that is so pure and well-done you will remember it for ever. Set in a South American village, poverty, dirt and the sun permeate everything. We meet four gentleman and witness their lives as they try to earn a living in this terrible place. Yves Montand plays Mario, the Frenchman in the group. He lives in this town working when he can, but more often than not he spends his days sitting outside of the bar trying to get his girlfriend, the barmaid to steal drinks and food for him. The entire town is filled with desperate loners from the four corners of the Earth. The town's main reason for being is that an American oil company uses it for it's local headquarters. When the new well blows up, the only way to stop it is to blow the fire out. There is some nitroglycerin available, but the only way to get it 200 miles into the jungle is by truck. The oil company hires four men, all of whom are desperate to get out of the hellish town, to transport the nitro in two trucks. Their reward will be enough money to escape once again.

One of the many brilliant things about the film is that Clouzot really allows us to get to know his four main characters and their lives. For the first hour, we watch Mario, Jo, Bernardo and Smerloff try to live in this town. This is something that an American film would never do. Because we know these four men so intimately, we feel for them and care about the outcome of the journey. This makes the suspense and thrills all the more believable and effective.

The second hour depicts the trek across the jungle. Driving two trucks through the jungle, over bridges, treacherous roads and more would be harrowing enough. Each truck has three times more nitro than they need to blow out the fire. Why? Because they don't expect both trucks to make it. The trucks must overcome a series of obstacles that would make most of us give up and go home. Each of the obstacles is very memorable and brings you to the edge of your seat.

The contrast between the two hours is also very jarring. For the first hour, these characters meander slowly through their lives. In the second hour, they are fighting for their lives.

""Wages of Fear"" has an ending that simply would not be made in an American film. It is jolting and a classic. I can't and won't tell you about it. You need to experience it for yourself.

Shot in black and white, the film has a stunning look. Night scenes have a silvery glow, the day is harsh and arid. The little town looks like it fell off the map.

Yves Montand is wonderful as Mario. A performance that could easily have become overdone, he remains believable for every second of the film. Our guide through this story, Mario is not a completely likable man. Each of the four men has a reason for hiding out in the little village. I like that each of these men has a dark side, something they are trying to hide, because it makes them seem more real.

Clouzot followed ""Wages of Fear"" with ""Les Diaboliques"", another truly remarkable film. Both of these films are constantly cited as influences by filmmakers. Both films have been remade as American films. ""Wages of Fear' was remade in 1977 by William Friedkin. ""Sorcerer"" is a very good film, emphasizing different aspects of the story, trying to provide grittier detail. ""Les Diaboliques"" was remade in 1996 as ""Diabolique"" starring Sharon Stone. The less said about that remake, the better.

I would urge everyone to watch ""Wages of Fear"" for the finest example of action filmmaking ever made",1113350400,3,3883,4.504261363636363
30103,4,0780021932,"This was no doubt a suspenseful nail-biter in its day.  But, come on!  This film absolutely PALES next to Friedkin's astonishingly intense remake from the '70s.  This film certainly stands on its own, but in light of the Friedkin remake it seems flat and and lifeless.  The characters lack the desperation, the animal instinct, the tortured recklessness to do whatever it takes to get out of their South American hell.  There is none of the violence, the risk-taking, the bravado of these men in Clouzot's original that would make it plausible that they would risk life and limb and drive a truck full of explosives for a measly $2000 bucks!  The explosives themselves don't seem so threatening as we are rarely reminded of the extreme danger of this particular cargo.  Friedkin's film never lets us forget for an instant how fragile and combustible this precious cargo is.  And neither do the characters, are they are hot tempered and sweat gathers on their brows from the very beginning.  Clouzot's film certainly broke ground and is a minor classic in the suspense genre, but it is Friedkin's riveting, overpowering and grim remake that is the CLASSIC.  A new DVD version of Friedkin's great work (his best film, IMO) is due to be released in early 2005.",1104278400,6,1257,4.831775700934579
30104,5,0780021932,"This is probably one of the most powerful films of all time. It was made during the time of the French new wave and existentialism thus you can only guess at the ending, it probably has a Sartrean twist. So simple a story and yet so metaphorically rich, it weaves together an element that all humans share, mainly living with each other and death.

The direction and story line is flawless and I only wish it was longer to enjoy more the vibrant quality that this film has possessed. It deals with a South American town where people of all nationalities are stuck like flies on a glue paper. Everyone wants to get out but they don't have the means or money to, work is sparse. An oil fire occurs far away at one of the oil pumping stations and the only way to put it out is to ship Nitro to it in trucks. Noticing the danger of the job, many men risk their lives for a chance at destiny.

We have Yves Montand as Mario, a young thug who is cool and keen, he hooks up with Jo (Charles Vanel) as a tough guy old man who looses his bravery once it is put to the test in the desolate jungles and back road mountains. Peter van Eyck as Bimba, a man who is not afraid to die because he has already seen it in a Nazi prison work camp. Folco Lulli is Luigi, a kind hearted and durable proletarian who is dying of rotten lungs. In one memorable scene in the bar, he is given a gun by Jo and says he will not shoot him because, ""I am not a murderer"". These characters are merely human in all they represent, in their weaknesses, in their flaws. We can't help but endear to all of them. The driving scenes are some of the best ever, there is excitement only because the voyage is still unknown and perhaps there is a foreshadowing that these men might not make it. It is a universal story, something so elementary and wonderful.",1102982400,6,1817,4.1737891737891735
30105,4,0780021932,"I liked this film, but it is very understandable why some would not find it interesting.

It would be very easy for this film to receive treatment like that seen on MST3K, where the show's hosts make fun of the film while watching it.  Not that this film deserves it, but the subtitled translations are a bit odd, mostly because there are phrasings and sayings in French which do not translate well to English.

There are also some exaggerated moments.  I mean, okay, it's nitroglycerine, but the amount of fear involved seems arch.  The point of the film is fear, of course, but it seems overmuch at times.  I also had the sense that some dangers could have been avoided (although the point is that Jo is overly cautious, and Mario isn't).

The ending is classic, though.  Not many directors would try and pull that sort of thing off these days, because these days, money is key, and endings like that tend not to make money.

So, why after my criticisms would I give the film four stars of five?  Because of its uncompromising portrayal of everyday schmoes in dangerous situations.  The very lack of charisma in the stars is extraordinary, and the ordinariness of the plot is extraordinary.  For a film to concentrate its focus on such matters is interesting in and of itself.  However, I would say this: The film caters to a sophisticated audience.  Go and get tired of films, and then see this one.",1102982400,,1402,4.600806451612903

30108,5,0780021932,"""The Wages of Fear"" is considered one of the truly great films. It not only delivers terrific suspense and excitement, it is also a rather telling comment on the human condition. Some drifters are trapped in a hot, bug-infested South American hell-hole. They are out of luck, out of money and seemingly doomed to remain where they are, fighting hunger, heat and each other. Suddenly, they are offered a small fortune to drive trucks through the jungle, across a mountain range to a destination 300 miles distant. The catch ? The trucks are loaded with nitroglycerine--one bump--one spark--one mistake--and the truck and any unfortunate humans on board are history.
Four men agree to drive two trucks, and their journey will have you biting your finger-nails down to your elbows ! All four actors are fine, with Yves Montand particularly memorable in the lead. I agree with the reviewer who notes that the first half hour of the film is slow, but it sets the mood. It's important to understand why these characters would volunteer for such a ""mission impossible"", even for a big payday.
The film has a chilling message about the lengths that people will go for money. I couldn't help but consider some of the ""reality"" television programs we see today like ""Fear Factor"". It's sad to see what indignities and dangers people will subject themselves to just to make a buck, and how easily they can be exploited.
The picture quality of the DVD is fine. I was surprised to find no extras, given that this is a Criterion release. An interview with one of our current, respected directors would have been a nice bonus. I'm sure that a film buff like Martin Scorsese would have some fascinating comments. Then again--I'm sure he's a busy guy !

30110,5,0780021932,"""The Wages Of Fear"" by director Henri-Georges Clouzot is a classic example of an action/suspense film for the thinking man.  Filmed almost fifty years ago, the story and cinematography hold up well, much better than those of many American films that were produced during that time frame, c. 1955.
The story:  Four drifters (presumably in exile from native France) are hired to drive two tanker trucks of nitro glycerine through rugged South American terrain in order to to extinguish an oil well fire. In the series of events that follows, the four encounter a variety of circumstances that threaten to end the road trip and send them to kingdom come.
""The Wages Of Fear"" is not the sort of film that you'll see on ""Dinner and a Movie""; The landscape, the cast and the ensuing events as portrayed in the movie typify a sort of squalid existence that most people, fortunately, never have to deal with. ""The Wages Of Fear"" is most definitely NOT a ""date"" film.
The film is french, in glorious black and white, with subtitles and some spoken english.  Yves Montand and Charles Vanel give solid performances, as do Peter van Eyck and Folco Lulli.  The direction of Clouzot helps to wonderfully illustrate the unfolding story of the four, and is simply outstanding.
A previous reviewer mentioned that a 1977 remake, William Friedken's ""Sorcerer,"" is also a good film.  He's absolutely correct; it is.  However, ""Sorcerer,"" was filmed in color, not black and white. And because the film's spoken language is English, the tone of the film is a little different.  ""Sorcerer"" is a little bit softer around the edges, and not as dark.
""The Wages Of Fear"" isn't a film that I'd like to watch on a regular basis - it is a rather dark film.  However, it is worth seeing more than once.  It's an impressive film.",1080086400,5,1798,4.737179487179487
30111,4,0780021932,"Yves Montand stars in Henri Georges Clouzot's suspenseful 1953 thriller ""The Wages of Fear"".  Masses of unemployed workers populate a squalid Central American town where an American oil company dictates the local economy.  When an oil rig fire burns out of control 300 miles away it is decided that a 2000 pound shipment of nitroglycerine must be convoyed there by truck to help extinguish the inferno.
Four drivers are selected from among the throng of the jobless and promised $2000 each to complete the dangerous overland journey with the unstable explosive cargo.  Montand and three others face seemingly insurmountable obstacles which bring out both courage and cowardice in each man.  Comradery bonds them together to accomplish their goal with fear threatening them around every corner.
The camera work and direction of Clouzot help create a sense of foreboding and terror.  One scene where the trucks are attempting to negotiate a ricketty wooden bridge features a close up of a hook supporting a suspension cable slowly and inexorably giving way.  Scenes like that were particularly effective in expressing the horror of the situation.",1079654400,,1144,5.258241758241758

30114,5,0780021932,"Bless Criterion for giving us this oft-fogotten masterpiece.  All the griping about anti-Americanism and slow-moving set-up is just minutae.  The pace is almost unnerving.  The most telling scene happens a little over halfway through the film: Two trucks loaded with decaying sticks of dynamite, spaced apart for safety, each take a different approach to a portion of the road where it is necessary to drive over a long stretch wooden ties.  The men in the first truck choose to move slowly, minimizing the jostling of the dynamite.  Unable to communicate with the first truck, the men driving the second decide to maintain a speed which will enable the tires to glide over the bumps with ease.  The ensuing panic caused when the second truck closes on the first, neither able to change speed without causing the dynamite to explode, is unrelenting.  You expect that a last-minute save will happen, but as more and more of these sorts of situations occur, the less convinced you are that anyone will survive their torturous journey.  That is just a small portion of the many moments of anguish and fear the four principle characters face.
It is funny that some reviewers have commented on how different the film would be if done-up Hollywood style.  Well, William Friedken did just that in his 1977 follow-up to The Exorcist.  Entitled ""Sorcerer,"" his re-make of this film is actually quite good, and while certainly different at times (it's about a half-hour shorter for one thing), comes out much the same.  I used to point folks to Friedken's film (when WOF was still hard to find), because I think it is just about as good.

Four drifters decide to accept the job and the $2000 that each will receive once the job is done.
Henri-Georges Clouzot's  excellent direction and fine screenplay make for one of the most suspenseful films created.

 I first saw this movie in the 1970s, and found it pretty impressive, although I cannot remember if it was the original version or the edited one.
When I saw it available in the Criterion Collection, I promptly bought it. The movie is still good, still viewable. The very young Yves Montand is great. His ""been there, done that"" attitude is very well done.
Being a French movie, done in the 1955, (Diem Bem Phu in recent memory) it has to have an anti-american message, and it is clearly delivered and spelled out. In the scene where the accident at the oilfield is reported in the town plaza, a woman delivers a speech blaming the ""gringos"" for coming to town and killing people in their oilfield, and just giving them money as compensation. They then proceed to assault and mob the truck that brings the wounded to town. The fact that the oilfield is the only source of real income for the local people, is glossed over.
Of course, when the announcement for the ""dangerous and well paid"" job of driving the trucks comes out, people line up for it.
The first half of the movie is slow and depressing, but sets the theme quite perfectly. The second half is a slow, edge of your seat thriller. The end is typical French, dark and depressing.

30117,4,0780021932,"Don't get me wrong - this is a great suspense film.  However, the suspense of the first hour of the movie is: ""is anything going to happen, or are they just going to sit around complaining?""  <Wages of Fear> gets off to an incredibly slow start, and I kept wondering if the rest of the film would be worth wading through the beginning.  It was.
By the time they get in the trucks, the film has clearly expressed the ennui of living in the middle of nowhere, with nowhere to go and nothing to do.  The rest of the film is incredibly suspenseful - moreso than almost any other movie I've seen.  In a Hitchcock movie, you know people are going to die, but it won't be the hero.  In a French film, anything goes, and any of the characters could die at any time.
I have to other problems with the picture.  First (and this may be the fault of the translator) is that some of the reasoning behind some of the characters' choices is unclear.  They have to go really fast so that they don't hit bumps?  Huh?
The second problem is the ending.  It's abrupt, surreal, and frankly it made me laugh out loud (not the intended effect, I'm sure).  Sure it's unexpected, but it didn't really seem to gel with the rest of the film.
Overall, though, this is an excellent film, with a solid DVD transfer from Criterion (there's a white line on the left side of the screen in several scenes, but it's not a huge problem).",1051056000,2,1401,4.2889733840304185

Since the cover of the Criterion Collection of THE WAGES OF FEAR DVD features a dead man's head, it's probably not hard to figure out that mishaps ensue on this dangerous trip.
The stress and tension inherent is the pleasure of the movie, though. Every little bump in the road causes the characters' adrenaline to boil, and the audience begins to feel it, too. Though the characters are only narrowly defined as individuals, their travails and near-misses with the trucks keep you on the edge of your seat. With the premise, Clouzot makes tense scenes out of every possible scenario, a narrow turn, a flooded roadway, a strict deadline that dictates the trucks must travel at an unsafe speed. The whole thing is brilliant.
For those of you who liked SPEED, this film ratchets up the same amount of tension by using a reversed scenario. Rather than a bus that can't slow down, it has trucks that cannot speed up.
THE WAGES OF FEAR will completely stress you out, for it draws you in using an unbeatable, somewhat preposterous premise and keeps the audience aware of bumps in the road long before characters face them.",1043798400,6,1418,4.815573770491803
30119,5,0780021932,"This is one of the most suspenseful movies ever made-- once the journey begins, the tension never lets up.  Director Clouzot has sometimes been called the French Hitchcock, but Hitchcock was never this gritty or pessimistic.  The stark B&W photography only adds to the brutal realism.  Make sure you get the full 2 1/2 hour version, as there may be edited versions still out there.",1039132800,,381,4.8307692307692305
30120,5,0780021932,"If you like tension and drama, and enjoy unique, hard-bitten stories, this is the movie for you.

This is one of the most enjoyable international films I've ever scene.  Shortly after The Big One (WW2), desperate men from Germany, France, and Italy are all squashed into a God-forsaken hole of a South American town dead-smack in the middle of nowhere.  Their only ticket out is to jump in with the big, fat, tough, rich Yankees who'll give them a local fortune if they have what it takes to deliver nitro over mountain roads to an oil well fire.

Clouzot's direction is outstanding.  Even in the comfort of your lazy-boy you'll feel like you're hanging on a cliff with your fingertips.  Peter Van Eyck was the driver most interesting to me, because he performed the whole brain-wracking task with a smile on his face and not a care in the world after spending WW2 in a Nazi salt mine.

Criterion Collection version of this movie is much better than the original.  The colored subtitles are a good touch, since much of the dialouge was previously lost due to white-colored English subtitles against black-and-white film, which, duh, camoflauges the words when something on the screen is white.  The widescreen is good, and the film seems a little cleaned up.

Well worth the collection of a series film fan!

The SOC boss was the only overacted performance. I think the cursing that a previous reviewer mentioned should be in there. Overall a good movie. Maybe watch it on a lazy Saturday afternoon.

30122,5,0780021932,"This is an extraordinary movie. From the opening scene showing the squalor of a Latin American town with filth and vultures in the street and naked children begging for food amid the oppressive, fly-stirred heat, to the finale on a winding mountain road, it is just plain fascinating. True, some of the action does not bear close scrutiny. One does not siphon nitroclycerine nor does one avoid potholes or bumps in the road by driving at forty miles per hour. No matter. Let's allow a little license. And the title doesn't entirely make sense because the wages of sin are death, but the wages of those who followed their fear and did not seek to drive a nitroclycerine truck over 300 miles of bad road are life. Again, no matter. This is such an original movie, every scene like little or nothing you've ever seen before (and for sure will never see again), that the little inconsistencies and some stretching of what is possible are not important. This is man against nature, man against himself reduced to a simple task. It is life in the raw. One mistake and you are dead.
Yves Montand has the lead as Mario, a Frenchman stranded in this god-forsaken town with only one way out: get enough money to pay for airfare. Charles Vanel is the older, tin-horn dandy who ends up with a case of the shakes. Peter Van Eyck is the man with the nerves of steel who finds this little adventure a piece of cake after forced labor in the salt mines for the Nazis. And Folco Lulli is Luigi, the happy, singing baker who hopes to return to Italy with the two thousand dollars they are paying him to drive the nitro-loaded truck.
This is a film depicting the primitive nature of a macho mentality. There's a lot of posturing. Every event is a potential test of manhood. Status and privilege are flouted. The weak and the poor do not inherit the earth.
Henri-Georges Clouzot directs and somehow manages to come up with a work of genius. One wonders how. The story, on the face of it, would seem to belong in the slush pile of a ten-cent pulp fiction mag from the 1930's. The acting is good, very good in places, but not great. The cinematography is straightforward, but nonetheless very effective. It is lean and focused always, showing us what needs to be seen without drawing attention to itself: the invisible style, which is the best. Clouzot's direction is characterized by a vivid depiction of things that we can feel: the mud and filth in the streets, the desperation and the boredom, the cruelty and meanness of men, the oil on their bodies, the singular fact of a ton of nitro in the back seat so that every move is a neuron-exposing adventure. I think that the visceral experience from beginning to end and the fine pacing are the essence of what makes this a great film.
Clouzot's wife, Vera Clouzot, plays Linda who first appears scrubbing the floor in an open-air bistro. She is rather extraordinary herself, finely made up and creamy white like a star of the silent film era. She grovels a lot, especially for Mario. She provides the counter-point, the contrast for the testosterone action of the movie.
No student of film should miss this. It would be like missing Citizen Kane or Dr. Strangelove or especially The Treasure of the Sierra Madre, which it vaguely and strangely resembles. ""La salaire de lapeur"" is, regardless of its flaws, one of the best ever made.",1020729600,4,3364,4.608333333333333

30124,4,0780021932,"I only have 2 complaints about this Criterion DVD of Clouzot's best film (and one of the best films ever). Well, maybe only 1 and 1/2 complaints.
Firstly, even though it is a blessing to finally have a gorgeous video transfer of the entire, uncut film, it still seems a shame to have it presented with now ""extras"". I mean, was there not a Clouzot scholar anywhere who could provide a commentary on the film (even a French film historian's commentary could have been translated)?
Secondly, the English subtitles seem to be an old (and old fashioned) translation. It seems odd to read the characters saying ""swell"" and ""beat it"". And I'm originally from Texas, and I know from experience that the English translation of the Spanish pejorative ""pendejo"" is not ""louse."" I think I also caught the character Jo saying ""eat excrement"" in French and reading the subtitle ""Good Luck"" underneath it.
Since they did completely re-do the look of subtitles, couldn't Criterion have made them a bit more accurate as well?",1008720000,9,1009,4.838150289017341
30125,5,0780021932,"This movie has two flaws. The first is that some of the logic is screwy; the second is the oilman O'Brien is a grotesque anti-American caricature, in sharp contrast to the beautifully limned characterizations of the protagonists. Neither of these flaws make a whit of difference in my reaction to this film. THE WAGES OF FEAR is all the things others have claimed: an action-packed suspense classic with a strong existential flavor. But, first and foremost, it is a masterful MOVIE. When you watch WAGES, you can't help but notice there isn't a wasted foot of film: Clouzot seemingly never plants a wrong foot in 2 1/2 hours of storytelling. The 'slow' first half in the hot little village is never less than completely absorbing...you can smell the stale breezeless air, hear the buzzing flies, and taste the salt of your own sweat after an hour of Clouzot's detailed, swooning-from-the-humidity immersion of the audience into this hellish purgatory: by the time O'Brien is looking for drivers, you know exactly why these men are so desperate to risk death to get out. (One man, denied the job, commits suicide; another, who did get the job, may have been murdered by one of our 'heroes'. It is a plot point left tantalizingly unresolved.) The pitiless journey they must make to get their $2000 is unforgettable: every emotion, every frayed nerve-end is exposed during the ordeal. We see these men at their most elemental and vicious and cowardly...but we also see their incredible nobility and love for each other later - when they have gone so far beyond turning back that hope, dignity and courage are the only things they have left to combat their fear and despair. Even though none of these things matter when a hard bump on the road will immolate the saint and the sinner alike, they nevertheless become the only things that matter. It's a beautiful, inspiring message for a film to contain. Those moments in WAGES where we see the men at their best (the scene where Lulli is discovered alive after the blast; Montand's comforting the dying Vanel at journey's end) are even more indelible and affecting than the noirish scenes of the men falling apart from stress - and THOSE are considerably powerful. Some of the setpieces -the rickety wooden precipice and the oil puddle foremost - aren't just suspenseful: the remote locations, stark black and white photography and tense editing create moments of timeless beauty and wonder, even (especially?) with the threat of death looming close by. Remade for no earthly reason I can discern, and another example of how superior French films before the Nouvelle Vague were to those that followed. Godard, Truffaut, Resnais: none of them ever made a film approaching the power or beauty of CHILDREN OF PARADISE, FORBIDDEN GAMES, BEAUTY AND THE BEAST or this movie. Essential viewing.",998697600,31,2832,4.926778242677824
30126,4,0780021932,"Clouzot's ""Wages Of Fear"" starts very slowly we are introduced to a fake little latin town full of drifters who can't seem to escape its seedy grasp. The only thing that any of the characters want is a new life but are they deserving of one?  The characters in this film are disgusting the guys are dis-honest, unloyal and all out greedy. Then the film begins, four of these men are chosen to deliver some dangerous materials along a most dangerous road and in doing so the fillm begins a game of tourture. The terrain is daunting, cracked bridges, moments of weakness, having to maintain a certain speeed to bypass graveled filled dips in the road. As soon the film paints a character in a nice light with a gernerous gesture they turn around and do something completely grotesque. SO why care about the film ar its characters at all? Simple, because they are human, faulted just like real people you want them to reach their goals but you also want them to fail. It's the human condition in us that wants others to be successful just not at your expense. Having the characters work around most of their fears instead of having them confront them is what makes this film an all around treat to watch unfold.",998438400,,1208,4.541284403669724

Lines pop up rarely but are only noticable due to the beautiful print quality used.  No extras or commentary, so you just get an incredibly enjoyable movie for a song.  The added scenes are welcome...character development in the beginning is more fully understood (and crucial to enjoying the journey), and the portrayal of the American oil company ""taking advantage"" of the needy locals and ex-patriots was remarkably tame and well-balanced (this coming from an ex-big oil employee).  I heard Milius once claim that there are only 32 plots in the movies, but this one to my knowledge has never been equalled, occasional SORCERER images aside.

30128,5,0780021932,"There are two things often said about this film that I would like to strongly agree with: first, it begins rather slowly, and second, it really is one of, if not THE, most suspenseful films ever made.
The first third of the movie moves inexplicably slowly. I can understand many of the reasons why: the attempt to define the characters, to show their interactions with one another, to depict the quiet desperation of their live to make it plausible that four men would undertake such an astonishingly dangerous job as hauling nitroglycerin over treacherous jungle and mountains dirt roads. Even granting all that, however, the start is by any standard, really, really slow. And I suspect that a couple of the one star reviews proclaiming the film a bore either gave up before getting to the good parts or never recovered from the slow start.
The most suspenseful film ever made? A couple of reviewers indicated that the film has been so over hyped along these lines that it would be impossible for any film to come up to one's expectations. There are two edges to this sword. I am far more impressed that despite being hyped as the most suspenseful film ever made, I was nonetheless utterly on the edge of my seat for most of the final 100 minutes. And if some of the scenes seem somewhat familiar, it is undoubtedly because of the score of films that have plundered this film for their own tension-filled scenes.
I have often thought that Yves Montand was, at his best, one of the more compelling performers of the last half of the twentieth century. He wasn't consistently successful internationally. Sometimes one or two decades would come between some of his greatest triumphs. To illustrate, I think Montand's two greatest film appearances were THE WAGES OF FEAR (1953) and JEAN DE FLORETTE/MANON OF THE SPRING (1986), only thirty-three years apart.
Finally, I have to agree somewhat with a couple of reviewers who disliked the ending. Nihilism was very fashionable in the early 1950s in European cinema. The ending, which seems completely unnecessary and not organically connected with the rest of the film, reflects less any inner necessity for a downer ending than the general mood in ""serious"" films at the time. So, in a sense, one could argue that this movie manages to be one of the great classics of cinema despite a slow beginning and an arbitrarily negativistic ending. Where the film shines is in the utterly riveting journey through the jungle and mountains.",989280000,12,2475,4.839622641509434

30130,4,0780021932,"Highly celebrated French film by director Henri-Georges Clouzot has achieved near cult status amongst fans of intelligent, psychological drama. Impressive black & white 1953 production excels in it's microscopic view of four personalities under intense pressure to succeed in a deadly quest.
Well known plot concerns four down & out drifters in isolated South American village accept $2,000 pay check's to transport two trucks loaded with nitro glycerine to extinguish oil well fire. Obstacles abound on their perilous quest with precarious mountain roads, dangerous landslides, burst oil pipes, ageing equipment and clash of personalities amongst motley crew.

Marvellous support performances given by stern Peter van Eyck (Bimba) and animated Folco Lulli (Luigi) as the second crew of foolhardy truck drivers.

30131,3,0780021932,"Sometimes, a good movie is the victim of inordinate amounts of praise and accolades by people who think it would be ""uncool"" of them to say anything negative.  Heaven forbid these in-crowd wannabes would say  anything to break from the pack.  So, instead, they pile on the  superlatives to the point of no return.  As a result, new audiences end up  feeling extremely disappointed when they finally do see the film because  there's no way it can live up to the high expectations these reviewers have  given it.
Well, I'm not one of those, so I'll say it like it is:  ""Wages Of Fear"" is a *very* good movie, but it's far from being  THE suspense movie to end all suspense movies as some here would have you  believe.  The newly-restored director's cut clocks in at a whopping 148  minutes, of which the first 46 minutes go by very s-l-o-w-l-y.  The  characters are being set up and developed during this time, but some of it  does drag and even then there are some unanswered questions as to who,  what, where, and why.
It's easy to see why parts of this film were  censored for its US release back in 1954: the picture that Clouzot paints  of American corporations and their heartless greed is not pretty indeed.  Even today, the dialog used by the oil-company foreman in his decision to  use non-union workers stings and shocks.
The story's pace picks up once  our four main characters get on the road with their charge of nitro.  Most  of the action is completely unexpected (a very good thing), some of it is  boringly obvious (not so good thing), and a bit here and there just isn't  explained very well (a bad thing).  Bimba and Luigi are believable as  characters and they endear themselves to the viewer immediately.  You just  love these guys.  Jo and Mario, however, are the complete opposite.  Jo's  breakdown, fully plausible as a result of what they have to go through, is  a bit too sudden and too early in the trip and renders his character  uninteresting --except for the scene at the gushing pipeline where your  heart will break because of what happens to him.  Mario's selfishness  causes him to do the unthinkable to get his nitro through, but it is this  scene that is the most powerful of the entire movie and which will have you  staring at your screen in complete shock.
Without revealing anything, I  found Mario's behavior at the end to be completely unbelievable and  out-of-character and the story ended much too abuptly (did they run out of  film?).  A very disappointing end to such a good movie.
The Criterion  edition is bare-bones: no trailer, no dubbed audio track, no interview,  nothing.  There are English subtitles, but they are not all that accurate.  The film has been remastered so it's clear, except for a vertical white  line that appears on and off for what seems to be the major part of the  film.  It's not all that obtrusive, but considering this is a Criterion  release it's surprising it's there at all!
I give this 3 stars:  4  stars for the film (despite its several flaws, it is engaging and  suspenseful and well worth owning) minus 1 star for the poor bare-bones  Criterion edition (with a ... list price, you'd think they could give  more).",966729600,13,3194,4.613595706618963
