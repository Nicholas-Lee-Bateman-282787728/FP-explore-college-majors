6402903,5,B00K5983DC,"What a winner. This has very good acting and the story line is kept on and has it's moments. It is a love story but, doesn't go the way that a lot of movies do. Has some very scary moments that didn't go sour. I really like this move and would highly recommend it. I don't think you will be disappointed with this good piece of work.",1416441600,5,333,3.985074626865672
6402904,4,B00K5983DC,"A relaxing film based around the connection these gentlemen have discovered. I adore gay love stories and this one here is a very pretty piece of work.

A true real view. To put it simply, this is what their life is. I'm sure there are many others out there who could compare this relationship to their own in so many ways. I like how this film just tells it like it is, gives it a very real (warm) perception. A great honest film I have much respect for.

The music used in this film is very good also(Joywave). After watching I feel obligated to seek out the music used. Good stuff!

Strong recommendation to check this film out, it's a good one.",1415836800,4,648,4.295081967213115

6402906,5,B00K5983DC,I'm not going to say anything about the storyline since other reviews have that down solid. This film has to be one of the most realistic based stories I have ever seen. Very heartfelt with different emotions. This film has now made it to be my favorite independent release ever. I bought this as a risk and loved it. I hope that anybody else will do the same. You will not regret it.,1414886400,6,384,4.273972602739726

6402908,4,B00K5983DC,"This is a very well acted film. I would have given it 5 stars, but for one thing. There was a sub-plot involving a series of murders of young gay men that did not seem to have anything to do with the film and was a distraction.

It's interesting that here is a film that is not HIV related, homophobic, about the dire consequences of coming out, losing your family because you came out, or any number of ""tragic"" things that so many other gay-oriented films are all about.

Its a movie about two average guys in a relationship in their early 20s,and how the relationship goes sour and why. Unfortunately, the viewer can see the future for these two men at,say, 45 years old. Kurt is a young man with a serious drug ,smoking, and alcohol addiction. Paul is a person well on the verge of significant depression and lasting hostility. How they handle their relationship now gives the viewer a pretty good idea of what they will be like later on in life.

Kurt, would probably have a much more serious addiction problem, with wasted potential, and his boyish looks gone. Paul would be going from one bad relationship to another because he is so skeptical of love after the relationship ended with Kurt, and he is afraid to let himself love. Usually in this situation, the person seems to re meet the same type of person in another body as they go on in life ,with the outcome of the relationship failing like the one did with Kurt.

Even with all that said, the film is presented in a very well-constructed and thoughtful way, the actors, who are new to the industry are naturals, and the whole cast is great. You can always tell when a movie is good, when it doesn't appear that the actors are acting. Bravo to everyone in the film.

Would highly recommend this film to anyone looking for a thought-provoking intelligent film about modern gay relationships.",1410912000,19,1854,4.538922155688622
6402909,5,B00K5983DC,"This indie, gay based drama has been compared to Brit, indie hit `Weekend'. I can see the comparisons but actually found this to be a better story. It is about two men Paul and Kurt, the film starts out with them meeting at a party and it is clear that they are somewhat `estranged'; we then go back seven months to when their love was clearly `in bloom' and find out how they got to this stage.

Whilst Paul worked in a supermarket to pay the bills, Kurt was a drug dealer and got to meet a lot of laid back people - some might say too laid back. A chance encounter then starts the clock ticking on the road to separation. We also have a back story of a serial killer who is targeting lone men. What we then have is the painful deterioration of the two lovers relationship and I have to say it was done completely convincingly. Things never just end and this was like watching nails being hammered into the coffin of their shared love.

I found this completely absorbing even though it was far from being a `feel good' movie. Quite the contrary; it dealt with an aspect of relationships that is all too often ignored and that is the breakdown. Director Chris Michael-Birkmeier has made a very good film and has also got two excellent performances from his leading men Kyle Wigent as Kurt and Tanner Rittenhouse as Paul - both of them virtual unknowns but both showing great ability. Not a bedroom fest more a study of a relationship past its best and if you are up for a challenging, intelligent and very human story then you could do a lot worse than giving this one a chance - recommended.",1403913600,33,1592,4.356902356902357
6402910,5,B00K5983DC,"Such a cute movie that I had to watch it twice! Scenes were shot beautifully and the acting was great.

6402912,5,B00K5983DC,"I agree with all the reviews-this film is masterfully done and deserves to be viewed. While gay-themed, this movie points out what is universally true in all relationships-the notion that things could be better on the ""other side of the fence."" The two main characters are caught in a rut with tensions growing to the point of the split. One character yearns for that ""ideal"" relationship while the other is content with the status quo. It is refreshing, however, to see that ultimately both characters evolve and grow albeit painfully. Kurt at the end hears Paul's working colleague utter in his pain that Paul loves Kurt--then we see Kurt distraught emotionally in the arms of his straight roommate. That was a moving moment as we see the realization by the main character of his own personal failure with his boyfriend, a scene very well played that spoke volumes.

The title of the film is appropriate on two levels--first, it goes into a flashback of when Kurt and Paul were ""in bloom"" from the first spark of attraction; the viewer then sees the gradual fading of the relationship as time goes on. Then at the end, we see the budding rose in Kurt's drink being focused, as the two are sitting on the sofa--a Kurt more matured actually working a legal job although he doesn't like it, and a Paul who is finally willing to communicate with him. We don't know if the two will ever get back together as they had been, or if they will become just good friends--but that is indeed part of the growing up process many of us go thru in any relationship.

There are a few noteworthy things brought out in the film--Paul's working colleague at the grocery is an interesting character. Extremely shy to a point of being socially debilitating, we see him struggle just to invite Paul to his birthday party. We see an emotionally handicapped guy struggling with his sexual identity who would find life just as challenging if he were straight. We see a situation of unrequited love between him and Paul who shuns away from his kiss at his party. Then, we see pointed out by Kurt's roommate and his girlfriend the situation of endless education debt that lead so many to engage in selling weed and other illicit substances. So many youth at the university are barely able to be there, and so many who should be there cannot due to absent financial resources. These side items helped make this film feel complete with universal messages.

I give this film 5 stars. In Bloom is worth seeing for all audiences. Well-done!",1463961600,3,2509,4.671945701357466
6402913,1,B00K5983DC,Halfway through the movie I felt like I wanted to be one of the victims of the Boy's Town killer.  What a morose piece of cr*p!  They must've been giving out free pot to those people with the positive reviews.,1461974400,2,209,4.2

6402915,1,B00K5983DC,"I wonder who wrote those positive reviews-friends of the production? We have here 2 young men in their early twenties, who squabble like a  couple that has been married 30 years. The dialogue is infantile and silly..Add to this couple a""sexy""(according to the notes)young blond men -with a speech impediment -who is supposed to be one of the  reasons for threatening the relationship of the lovers.

6402916,1,B00K5983DC,"This movie was so irritating and boring, I found myself fast-forwarding through a lot of it hoping to get to the part where something interesting would happen. It didn't, unless you count the ridiculous ending.  I literally threw the DVD in the trash afterward because I knew I'd never watch it again and I didn't want to waste the shelf space.  As a Prime Video stream that you stop after 30 minutes, fine, but definitely do not buy it.",1458604800,4,437,4.518987341772152
6402917,4,B00K5983DC,"Filmed in and around Chicago. C. M. Birkmeier's no-budget film centers on a turbulent relationship between Kurt (Kyle Wigent), and Paul (Tanner Rittenhouse). They begin the film with their affair completely ""in bloom,"" as the title suggests; but then Kurt declares openly to Paul that he is no longer in love. Whether that is actually true or not is a moot point; by the film's end, when Kurt is the unwitting witness to an horrific murder, he actually discovers the true meaning of fidelity and loyalty.

The plot is a familiar one, but director Birkmeier reinvigorates it through a suggestive cinematic style. His stock-in-trade is the flat two-shot framing Kurt and Paul as they eat Chinese food, play video games, or sit in bed. This might suggest closeness, but can also denote imprisonment; hence Kurt's desire to escape the relationship. Yet Birkmeier also uses the aerial shot looking down on the two lovers as they lie in bed together. They seem quite far distant from the camera - a fitting metaphor, perhaps, for the state of their affair. On another occasion he films them making love to one another; they are actually lying horizontally in bed, but Birkmeier shoots them from the side and then turns the image through forty-five degrees, making it seem as if they are standing up, having a ""quickie"" before moving on.

On other occasions Birkmeier uses locations to suggest the sterility of the protagonists' existence. Paul spends his days in a grocery- store filling shelves and exchanging desultory conversation with co- worker Eddie (Jake Andrews). Meanwhile Kurt visits several groups of youngsters to sell them weed; while making a lot of ready money from the deals, he does not seem to enjoy it very much. Or maybe he is just frightened of engagement with anyone, whether boyfriends or others.

Critics might accuse IN BLOOM of giving a stereotyped portrait of a gay community as promiscuous, drug-addicted and hedonistic. This is perhaps a little too censorious: Birkmeier seems more interested in the emptiness of his characters' existences as they move aimlessly from party to party without any real aim in life. This is the main reason for Paul and Kurt's break-up; while they claim to have each other, they both realize that the relationship will not get anywhere.",1456099200,4,2289,4.986910994764398
6402918,5,B00K5983DC,"This movie was one of the best surprises ever.  Amazingly true to life in a way that you rarely find in a gay-themed film.  It reminded me a lot of the 2004 movie ""Denied"" (which had issues with muffled sound and terrible lighting but these drawbacks were easily outweighed by the brilliant depiction of a totally dysfunctional friendship/relationship that was so genuine, you just knew it had to have happened exactly that way in real life to the writer of the script.)  I don't mean to say that IN BLOOM suffers from issues of muffled sound and terrible lighting.  But it most definitely presents a brilliant depiction of a totally dysfunctional relationship that is so genuine, you just know it had to have happened exactly this way in real life to the writer of the script.  You might get the idea that this is a depressing movie but it's not.  I actually found it to be strangely uplifting.  Very unique for this genre - it is not like other gay-themed movies.  I highly recommend giving this a try, you won't be disappointed.",1451520000,4,1031,4.626373626373627

6402920,3,B00K5983DC,"I must admit that I was disappointed by this film, after seeing some nice reviews. It is definitely a low-budget production, but that doesn't mean that the production values had to be so amateurish.  Too cheap to put the camera on a tripod to avoid that jittery hand-held effect?  Come on!  And how many creative ways can you film public scenes without actually having any extras?  Yes, the cast is attractive, and more than adequate in ability.  The main problem:  there seems to be no reason -- other than physical attraction -- that our two main characters would be in a long-term relationship.  They seem to have nothing at all in common, other than their cuteness.  There are also subplots which tend to diminish the ""story,"" rather than adding to it.  Granted, there is a somewhat interesting attempt to follow the downward arc of a dying relationship.  I applaud the efforts, but wish the results had been greater.",1436140800,3,921,4.772151898734177

6402931,5,B00K5983DC,"In Bloom is a magnificent film simply for its realistically subtle portrayal of a gay relationship,  Everything from the acting to the lighting is beautiful.  One the thing stands out in my opinion--the writing.  While the overall story makes the film what it is, the dialog between the characters is amazingly true to life that I think I may have had some of the conversations.

This film is a slice of life from gay life.  The acting is excellent from both the two main characters as well as the supporting cast.  The film takes us from the resolution/restart of a failed relationship back into the middle of the relationship where things started to go wrong.

The only slight distraction in the film is the serial killer.  Was Kurt mugged by the serial killer?  Who was it that we saw killed by the serial killer who just arrived home?  Was Paul's coworker's death a vehicle for Kurt to be told that Paul loves him?

I loved In Bloom.  And i am left with only one question.  Did their hands finally touch while seat on the sofa at the party in the opening and closing scenes?",1422748800,,1078,4.494845360824742

6402934,3,B00K5983DC,"This movie might have been better if the characters were just a little bit older. The film is not solid enough to know if it was intentional or not, but the story and feel of the movie illustrates how alone and fragile we all are. The supporting character of a coworker with aspergers syndrome was way more interesting than the twink leads. A few softcore sex scenes.",1420761600,3,367,4.492537313432836
6402935,2,B00K5983DC,"A real disappointment, unfortunately, and not one I expected given all the rave reviews.  The camera work and soundtrack are great, but there is absolutely no comparison to the British film Weekend.  The performances are adequate.  The key problem with the picture is a failure to convince the viewer of the depth of emotional connection between the two characters.  Our knowledge of them is superficial at best and what we do know is pretty disturbing.  Both are deeply involved in the drug culture, though one is more entrenched, while the other has enabling tendencies.  Neither has any sense of aspiration, vision or ambition.  They are mired in the existential now.  They speak a lot but say very little.  Without a knowledge of themselves, how can their relationship work?  The moments of tenderness, empathy, and agony fall flat because the writer and director have failed to convince us that the relationship has any real importance.  It seems merely a trial run hopefully on the way to something better, more challenging, mutually enriching.  Like so many early relationships, this one might seem emotionally fraught to those on the inside, but its real emptiness will reveal itself with hindsight and perspective.  The most engaging character in the film is the repressed coworker Eddie.  He seems to have a back story that might be worth looking into.",1420243200,10,1362,5.04932735426009

8655910,4,B00K5983DC,"A bit of a sleeper, you have to give this one a little time and patience. About 15 minutes in and I wondered, would this be a flop following two guys who go to parties and smoke weed for 90 minutes?  Fortunately, no, though that certainly plays out during the film.

If you're of a certain generation, you may have to go back in time to that early, maybe first love affair that didn't quite go as you expected, then decide, are you Kurt or are you Paul?  At the onset, we have two guys passionate and lusting for each other though appearing to be from different sides of the tracks.  That said, youthful lust is often confused with love, and when a young charmer Kevin enters the picture, things get confusing for Kurt, our drug dealing playful party boy.

I understand why some may pan this film, and if was backed by a major Hollywood studio (which I'm glad it's not), it might only earn 2 stars.  But the actors are good and the production clearly tries to build on some typical film-making angles and effects.  Even the non blockbuster music is pretty good!

We follow the the two through a painful breakup, and it's here where we see the often asked and rarely answered questions, such as ""what did I do wrong""?  The secondary plots, which are not well focused and sort of a distraction are used to bring our two young men together, briefly, but long enough to confront some of their emotions. While not a Hallmark saga, the film manages to get me a bit teary eyed at a few points, indicating it managed to capture the viewer.

The film ends much like real life - can there be reconciliation, or is there no way of recovery? You'll have to see th film to decide.",1520726400,,1667,4.365695792880259

The acting was generally well played out, the camera work and soundtrack were of good value, however I really didn't get the depth of emotion that I generally get from such films, it just seems I was not overly vested in the characters. Three Stars is worth seeing, I don't have any regrets watching the film, I just felt it needed a little more emotional punch, I just didn't feel it.

The other person for the couple also lives a meaningless live, just working to pay the bills, as it seems. Nothing remotely romantic in the air. To complicate the things, there is a serial murder that is attacking young man, in a subplot never developed.
