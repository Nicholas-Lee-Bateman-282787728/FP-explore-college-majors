8702705,5,B00TQ4AFRO,"I ordered this DVD set for my 88-year-old mother, as I had already enjoyed it via a streaming service. We are not Korean and do not speak any Asian language.  Mom loved the story, which is basically a Cinderella-type drama. She said the subtitles were clear enough for her to read easily, a major consideration. One thing I liked about this drama is that the bad guys are as interesting as the good guys.  The plot is preposterous, but don't let that stop you from having a great time watching the series.",1459641600,,505,4.478260869565218

8702708,4,B00TQ4AFRO,"While I really enjoyed this series I think it could have been cut down by several episodes.  It just seemed to drag on towards the end until the last 1-2 episodes.  Having said that, I will also say that I loved the two main leads so much that it made up for the last part of the season.  This is the 3rd show I have watched with Joo Sang Wook and he is just plain adorable.  I think I would watch him in anything.  This is the first show I have watched with Han Ye Seul and I think she also did a terrific job.  All the ""bad guys"" were also fantastic and I loved to hate them all season.  I will say that at times it felt like there were almost too many bad guys.  My heart can only handle so much.  While this show was more soap operaish than most of Korean dramas I have enjoyed, I just went with it most of the time when I heard that ""bad guy music"" because I had faith all would work out in the end.",1442707200,,904,3.843243243243243
