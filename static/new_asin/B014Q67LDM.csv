7420349,4,B014Q67LDM,"This was a great family film. It is not going to win any awards, but the story is solid and shows a family that comes together over a furry friend. The story was cute, and the character development and interaction strong. All-in-all this was a great movie that my whole family enjoyed and yours will too!

7420350,2,B014Q67LDM,"Unfortunately not one of the better Christmas movies that has come out this year!  The plot just does not come together well at all.  It also seems like ""obvious"" parts are missing from this movie.  So much could have been done to make this movie better!!  Along the same plot lines is the Hallmark movie ""Puppy Love"" with Candace Cameron Bure---very well done!!  I would highly recommend ""Puppy Love"" way over this movie, but it is not a Christmas movie.",1446681600,,455,4.6375

7420367,1,B014Q67LDM,"The script, acting, underlying assumptions and Christmas sets in this movie are vanilla, completely unexamined, utterly surface and consumer oriented, in a word, pitiful. Everything is aimed at the lowest common denominator. There is nothing interesting here for anyone with a mind. The pacing is uneventful, utterly predictable and slow.

The most pitiful thing is that I watched this all the way through and now it's 2:10 A.M. well past my bedtime and I may miss yoga in the morning. If you have a brain cell, please honor yourself and your life. Do not watch this.",1483228800,,567,4.90625

7420387,4,B014Q67LDM,"I love a good Christmas heart warming love affair as much as the next person. The story was great. The actors where great. The chemistry between the kids was good and the dog fit but the two lovers well lets just say they seemed more like to people that excepted one another rather then love each other.
This is a good movie but I like to watch them over and over. While once it is a good movie I don't think I'll enjoy it as much tomorrow and the next day. It's just there was not enough emotion for anyone but the dog and the people you knew you where suppose to not like.
Story line well it has been done but boy losses dog thanks to neighbor calling pound. Girl buys dog at pound. They agree to share the dog and grow closer from it. While they are both good looking others step in and create problems that shouldn't be there. Spoiler alert as if you didn't know they sort out the problems and grow to hold each other fondly. maybe I'm spoiled on the fairytale love of Hollywood and this is what real love might be. Something to grow over time with the give and take of real life.
Anyway I hope you get what I'm trying to say good movie just not great to me.",1482796800,,1162,4.100877192982456

work with, it's no wonder it was boring.  Antonio Cupo is one of my favorite actors, but this was not one of his better roles. Even the dog couldn't save this one!",1461456000,2,315,4.216666666666667

7420537,3,B014Q67LDM,"I am a huge fan of Hallmark movies and other uplifting movies like them. I like the actors from this movie, as I have seen them in other movies, but I just really didn't enjoy them in this movie that much. The chemistry wasn't great, and I have seen this story line before in Candace Cameron Bure's Puppy Love, which I actually thought that was better than this one.  It is cute enough to watch once, but if I had seen it before buying, I wouldn't have purchased it because it wasn't one of those that I will watch over and over again.",1451952000,2,535,4.194174757281553

7420543,3,B014Q67LDM,"This was a good holiday/doggie movie for a rainy afternoon, watched it with my young teen daughter, and it was a nice choice.  Low-level drama (which I really appreciated) and a simple story but realistic enough.  She liked it well enough to keep it.  No subtitles, no closed-captioning :(",1447459200,3,289,4.857142857142857

Man finds dog and wants it back, but agrees to share it with the lady and her son. Having lost the dog once did he have it chipped? No!!! Dog gets picked up again and ends up in the pound. The same worker doesn't recognize the dog and is going to let another couple have it. Dog is saved at the last minute by the original owner/man and the lady.
