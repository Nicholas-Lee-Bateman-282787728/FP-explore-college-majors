3106204,5,B0013FW5UE,Awesome ski movie.  Great shots and great athletes killing it.  Matchstick was truly at the peak of their game during this one.,1375056000,,127,4.7272727272727275
3106205,5,B0013FW5UE,Great big mountain action with a little park thrown in for kicks and giggles. Always a fun view with MSP.,1375056000,,105,4.3
3106206,4,B0013FW5UE,"Full of stupid tricks, people skiing, base jumping, and all with a great sound track.  Great way to fill an hour.",1371081600,,113,4.380952380952381
3106207,4,B0013FW5UE,"A little excessive on the acrobatic aerial stuff, but truly phenomenal drops into some of the most verticle runs that you would not believe possible to ski, let alone survive to ski again!
