7441732,5,B015IKSQPW,"I purchased all 5 new ""30th Anniversary"" DVDs directly from Gilad's website and I love all of them. These are all recent workouts from his TV show and not old recycled ones. Each is about 21 min long and there are 2 workouts on each DVD. I try and do 2 for a 40 min workout (I skip the cool down in the middle). All these workouts target different body parts and have cardio mixed in it. The Hawaiian location is beautiful, as always, and the music is good. Good for beginners-intermediates. You can watch a clip for each DVD on Gilad's website: bodiesinmotionwithgilad.com",1447200000,3,573,4.519230769230769

8733703,5,B015IKSQPW,"Of all the 30th anniversary shows, this is the one to get. I love episode 6 heavy ball workout. Its refreshing to get a total body workout without going to the ground.

Episode 5 is probably the toughest out of the 10. The circuit training will leave you drenched.",1530835200,,264,4.387755102040816
8733704,3,B015IKSQPW,"Couldn't review the videos before purchasing; consequently, didn't know what I was getting.  Thought I would get more aerobics; it's more calisthenics.  I was a little disappointed.  Only kept because it's Gilad.  The weight training video is good.",1505174400,,248,5.447368421052632
