4661388,5,B005DPN4B4,"My son is 7 and my daughter is 4 and they both like Zhu Zhu pets. One day in the store we came across this and they begged and pleaded to get it. How could I say no? I kind of thought that they would watch it once, maybe twice and that would be it. However - I've lost count on how many times they have watched it!! They could probably recite it at this point. They especially love the songs. I hear my daughter singing the 'I want to be loved' song quite a bit. The other day 'Celebrate' came on the radio and my son said ""Hey, that's in the Zhu Zhu Pet movie""! So yeah, it's been a big hit in our house. If your kids love Zhu Zhu Pets they will probably love this movie.",1320364800,,672,3.841726618705036
4661389,4,B005DPN4B4,My 5 year old son just loves thr Zhu Zhu and Battle Hamsters so I got this for him.  He really likes it and has watched it several times.  It actually has a solid plot. He was scared the first time he watched it though so it's a little intense.,1320019200,,244,3.86
4661390,5,B005DPN4B4,My daughter loves Zhu Zhu Pets so when I heard they were coming out with a movie I knew she would want it! I have to say that it's a really cute movie with fun songs and cute characters. I would highly recommend this for anyone who loves Zhu Zhu Pets. This will be a family favorite of ours for sure!,1318032000,3,300,3.9344262295081966
4661391,5,B005DPN4B4,"When my daughter begged for the ""Zhu Zhu Pets Quest for Zhu"" DVD I bought it with a faint heart. However it turned out to be a delightful well made film. A couple of songs (with a great version on the Jackson 5 ""ABC"" sung by the intrepid hamsters themselves. The quality of the animation was theatrical and somehow far more fitting for my six and eight year olds than many of the movies we have seen this past year.",1317254400,14,415,4.2

4661397,5,B005DPN4B4,"Most definately a little kids movie. Very cute, but an older kid or adult might find this very kiddy-ish and ""boring"" in my 14 yr old daughters words lol. It IS a cute movie that is child friendly, don't have to worry about language that's not right for your child ect. My 4 year old thought it was just great!",1357430400,,310,4.183333333333334

4661399,4,B005DPN4B4,"My daughter loves Zhu Zhu pets and had to see this movie which she loves.

It's an adorable story about taking what you have for granted and regretting letting it go. Definitely a lesson I wasn't expecting but a good one to learn for young children.",1354147200,,249,4.413043478260869

4661402,3,B005DPN4B4,I bought for two grandkids - ages 9 and 5.  They saw the preview on a Barbie DVD and asked me to get it.  They turned it off halfway through.  Just didn't have the attention grabbing action for them.  Quality of DVD and animation was fine - must have been the story.,1350864000,,266,4.0576923076923075

4661404,5,B005DPN4B4,"My friends and I follow Thia Megia, the amazing talent on American Idol Top 11 Finalist.  We just adore this 16-yr old singer/songwriter/multi-instrumentalist.  Thia's voice gave the song, ""One Day"" an exceptional, beautiful impact to me and my daughter who loves Thia too.&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Music-From-The-Motion-Picture-Zhu-Zhu-Pets-Quest-For-Zhu/dp/B006D88U5K/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Music From The Motion Picture: Zhu Zhu Pets Quest For Zhu</a>",1327363200,,508,8.053571428571429

4661407,5,B005DPN4B4,"My daughter (6) and son (5) adore the ZhuZhu Pets and QUEST FOR ZHU, especially the music in the movie..so much so that we immediately ordered the CD from Amazon after watching the DVD. If you've got teenagers in the house-they'll especially love that American Idol finalist Thia Megia has her first official single on the CD, and an amazing singer songwriter from You Tube (Savannah Outen) is also featured on the soundtrack. Our kids watch this movie over and over and never tire of Mr. Squiggles, Pipsqueak, Num Nums and Chunk. Highly recommend both the CD and the DVD.<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Quest-For-Zhu-Music-From-The-Motion-Picture/dp/B0063NHT5W/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Quest For Zhu (Music From The Motion Picture)</a>",1325030400,2,776,6.0636363636363635
4661408,5,B005DPN4B4,"First of all, we've had some Zhu garb for the past two years. They've love them, but not overly obsessed.  They DO love hamsters (we have a real one) and all things gerbil.  With that being said, we are 2 days past Christmas and they have watched this movie about 20 times (bad mom or vacation?) Who cares.  They DRUG me into the sun room and forced me to sit down and watch it with them (they've never done this with any other movie). After every cute or funny part my daughter would tap me and look at me with a huge smile to see my reaction.  It was the cutest thing.  I'm glad I watched it!  It's really cute and I especially love that they don't say idiot, stupid or shutup in the movie. Gold star for that!  The dragon woman is kinda intense for tiny kids but my kids have been watching The Nightmare Before Christmas this year and are desensitized to slightly scary animation now.  They know it's done in a computer (i've shown them youtube vids :)  BUY THIS MOVIE! It's sweet, funny, charming, entertaining and has a positive message.",1324944000,,1042,4.329896907216495
4661409,5,B005DPN4B4,"My 4 yr old LOVES this movie!  She watched it over and over on a recent road trip.  It actually has a good plot, too!

8467316,5,B005DPN4B4,"My 5 yr old recently got this movie and loves it! He got the 'Quest for Zhu' game on his Nintendo DS for christmas, and has enjoyed it so much. I then found out about this movie, and it quickly became a favorite of his. The storyline matched up with his DS game, which made him joyous. And he loved all the delightful songs and characters. I worried he would be scared of the scary reptile creature, Mehzula, when she came on, but he didn't seem bothered and loved watching the zhu zhu pets save the day. Really colorful, cute animation. Great for lil girls or boys. And I recommend the game too if your child has a DS.",1420934400,,619,4.2100840336134455
