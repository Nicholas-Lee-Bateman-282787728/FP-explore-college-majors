4850969,3,B005O64VT6,"The teenage son of a mother who must work on Christmas and will soon lose her job has given up on Christmas spirit. One night, he is visited by an Angel, Hope, who tells him that he must spread the spirit. He ends up in Malibu at the modestly luxurious home of a family that sorely needs the spirit. Using the pretext that he is the friend of the daughter, he ingratiates himself with the family, all of whom are unhappy with each other, at least at the start.

Like many Christmas movies, this one is entirely predictable, and it's suiting that Maureen McCormick has a brief role here since the predictability level here is on about the same level as&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/A-Very-Brady-Christmas/dp/6302593093/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">A Very Brady Christmas</a>. That said, there is still a warmth here, primarily because of the presence of Alexandra Paul and Jason Brooks as the married couple living in the Malibu home. They truly save the film, and their performances seem to be infectious, for everyone is better in the scenes with them. (This point is important since the film starts so awkwardly with scenes that simply are not convincing.)

In the end, the film delivers on its promise and even has a few pleasant moments along the way, notably the arrival of the grandmother (Janet Carroll in one of the last roles of her life). There is nothing particularly surprising her, and there certainly are scenes that could have been improved and decisions (such as the voice over for the dog) that probably should not have been made. But there is a well-established blueprint for many Christmas movies, and as long as the movies stick to that blueprint, they work, at least to some degree.

For those who are interested, this movie seems entirely family friendly. I cannot recall any swearing, and there is no violence. There is also, for those who care, no religious content except in a vague way with the existence of an angel.",1351555200,5,1987,4.996978851963746

It was fun seeing Maureen McCormick (Marsha Brady) again, and Alexandra Paul and Jason Brooks were great together! Janet Carroll the Grandmother made me laugh and tear up.  The young actors were awesome too! I had smiles, tears and giggles during this movie.  I am going to buy the DVD for my home library and buy it for my kids and their family. .  Its a great movie for the holidays.  I am now in the spirit!!",1321401600,21,511,4.382978723404255

Watching Maureen McCormick again  was so much fun!  Its always fun to watch Alexandra Paul, she always lights up a movie, and Jason Brooks is as handsome as ever, and really charming .

4850975,5,B005O64VT6,"This delightfully terrible Christmas film is sure to make you feel bizarre in all the right ways. The first version of the script seems to have never been revised as many of the lines seem straight out of a student film. The acting tries so hard but is doomed to make even the most forgiving viewer cringe...but don't worry Marsha Brady, I'm blaming the director.
Despite this terrible review, the film has found a place in our hearts, similar to The Room. It has become a Christmas tradition and since our recent purchase of the dvd, I have a feeling it will remain a tradition for years to come.",1419292800,,597,4.486238532110092

4850981,1,B005O64VT6,"This movie, also known as ""A Christmas Puppy,"" is without a doubt the worst movie I have ever seen. For one thing, the movie was re-branded ""A Christmas Puppy"" and has nothing to do with a puppy at all. The plot is completely ridiculous and is of a quality that I would call 4-5 levels below the made for TV movies you might see on ABC family. The acting is horrible, none of the plot makes any remote sense at all. I honestly thought this was the movie equivalent of the Friday music video, assuming a bratty kid with rich parents wrote it and had them pay for it to be produced.

Please Please Please, do not waste any money on this movie. If you are truly interested, ask a friend who has netflix to watch the first 10 minutes.

The only redeeming quality for this movie was that it was so bad, I was compelled to watch the entire thing with friends while we constantly laughed about how horrible it was.

It is, quite literally, the worst movie I have ever seen, in my entire life.",1355961600,,985,4.25668449197861

It's really this movie and it's not really about a puppy?!  wow, that's why I am NOT making this five stars.

8480922,1,B005O64VT6,"The gem of an idea get ruined in this television production.  In this film a teenager gets visited by a ""Christmas Spirit"".  This kid is not exactly full of ""Christmas Cheer"" but he isn't a bad kid.  He is an only child to a single mother.

One day he gets a visit from a spirit that he MUST show another family the joy of Christmas.  Not knowing how to do that he must wing it.  THe spirit tells him to ""follow the signs"" and he will find the destination!  She then hands him a fortune cookie that helps lead the way! Sounds great right.  The kid must travel and look for signs.  What a great funny set up. Can imagine the stranger on the bus looking at him.  He getting the signs wrong.  Great Right!  Well it never happens.  The TV Budget limits this film to just one location.

We go from his home to his destination.  The film took too many short cuts.  The film could of been great,  But it becomes predictable and boring. Kids might like this but adults will just be bored.  What could of been a funny and heartwarming story becomes another forgettable Christmas movie.

This film had a great and funny idea.  This however a film with an idea that should be re-explored.  A bigger budget would help.  A longer journey for Riley should be on the agenda if tsomeone does remake this.

If you come across this film pass on it!!",1471478400,,1331,4.278225806451613

8480925,4,B005O64VT6,"I liked this movie, watched it online on Amazon Video and was impressed at how different it was from most Christmas movies.  Alright, it will never be my favorite, is not one of those that just sucks you into the Christmas spirit and never lets you go.  But it's pretty good.  It's the story of a young man who's visited by a spirit named Hope and told that he has to help a family lacking in Christmas spirit in order to get the spirit himself.  He works with a family that has problems -- it's not a dysfunctional family, but they're not happy and he slowly tries to get them to solve their problems one by one.  And, for once, it is a complete family, both parents living with their only daughter.  I must say that I'm always surprised by how many parents in Christmas movies are single parents -- the other one left, died, divorced ... Just that one change makes it a little refreshing.

It's a pretty good movie with a different approach to Christmas movies and not a bad way to spend a couple of hours.",1451692800,,1008,4.301587301587301
