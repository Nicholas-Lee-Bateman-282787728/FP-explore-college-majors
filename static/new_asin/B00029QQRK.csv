2072181,4,B00029QQRK,"I'll be the first one to admit that this movie borrows from a LOT of sources (but now a days, what movie doesn't?) BUT, I'll also be the first to say that this is a surprisingly good little, cuddle-up-on-the-couch-with-that-significant-other-with-the-lights-out, ride of a movie.
The story takes place at a Canadian Campus, where student boys are turning up dead, frozen from the inside out, and one student believes that it has something to do with a female fraternity house, populated by a gaggle of, ""Barbie"" like centerfolds.
Might sound a tad corny (and this could have been the reason for its slight turn at the box office) but it's actually quite fun.
Oh, and be sure and check out the deleted scenes, as they tend to help answer some small questions, that were kind of left hanging (for reasons of time, I'd suspect).",1090281600,,825,4.816901408450704

This inconsistent approach sinks it immediately because it's never quite funny or scary enough to serve either genre.  The plot wanders and drags, one minute a beauty pageant, the next there's a Hardy Boy & Nancy Drew trying to solve the case, all the while the prime suspect hallucinates and behaves like a maniac.  Why Nicole Eggert and Richard Burgi were in this movie is anyone's guess.
A good idea gone awry.  Not a keeper.",1305072000,,588,4.792079207920792

Oh that silly Sci-Fi channel and their movies, who am I kidding I love that channel and their low budget flicks. This one right here is not one of my favorites but it looks good compared to some others and oh yeah it is a total knock off of ""Species"" but that is ok we'll get through it. This movie is far from perfect and to be honest is really not all together good per say but it has that Sci-Fi charm about it. You know what you are getting so you are never really truly disappointed; I tend to like horrible movies so here we go.

Up in Canada at a college all the kids are doing what one would expect from them, not studying and participating all kinds of sexual acts. As great as that might sound there is one problem for the guys in this flick, some of the hottest girls at the school are actually aliens that are killing the guys off after mating with them. Of course as easy as guys are to get into that position it is not hard for the aliens to pull this off, until one guy sees them in action. Luke is your average college kid until that fateful day when he sees them for what they are. Now as he is trying to prove their existence to his friends and at the same time trying not to be found guilty of the deaths on campus he must find a way to stop them.

Now while this is a rip off of other films like the one I said earlier it is still kinda fun at times although it is not groundbreaking in any way. As with most Sci-Fi Channel flicks the FX are wonderfully cheesy but the frozen bodies [they kill during mating by freezing the victims from the inside out] look excellent. In fact one of the first guys gets frozen while he is still.... Uh well you know. Also it makes sense that these cold creatures by nature are allergic to heat, how appropriate I guess. The acting is hit or miss depending on your taste, if you don't mind over the top acting or lack of talent in some cases then this is for you easy. Not every one is horrible but for the most part this is an over the top type flick.

Writers Tom Berry and Matthew Hastings [also director] while not completely original do supply so good moments and help this film from being truly horrible. Lead actor Corey Sevier is either horrible or greatly over the top depending on how you look at it. Personally at times I thought he was doing fine and at others not so much. Elias Toufexis who plays Roger in the film is either really annoying or actually funny; I kinda liked him in this. As a matter of fact the entire cast can be looked at the same way, horrible or over the top good.

This film will never be a classic and is really not for every one but if you like the Sci-Fi Channel and such this one may be for you. Honestly it was ok not to bad if you are in the mood for a flick like this, a rental maybe but I would catch it on the Sci-Fi Channel.",1244073600,,2830,4.0554561717352415
2072184,5,B00029QQRK,"Like SPECIES on laughing gas, DECOYS is the tale of a Canadian University suddenly infested with man-hungry aliens. You'd think they'd be rather easy to spot, what with their rather unsavory habit of projecting flailing tentacles from their navels and forcing them down the throats of any unfortunate male who happens to give them a filthy glance. But these sneaky intergalactic vixens have arrived prepared. They've disguised themselves as large-bosomed Lolitas, and they won't rest until they've had their nottie way with every unsuspecting horny male in sight.

Understandably, these buxom alien hotties meet with very little resistence from almost every man on campus. But our hero, (dorm-dwelling freshman Corey Sevier), isn't just ANY man. You see, After sneaking into a sorority girl's dorm room to return some quarters, Sevier spies one of the alien tarts sprouting tentacles in front of her roomie - who's casually huffing away on liquid nitrogen (Don't ask). And so Sevier comes to the conclusion that these two are, in fact, not of this planet - though none of his friends wants to believe him. But after a pair of suspicious deaths, Sevier becomes convinced he's right. Armed with a flame-thrower, and a seemingly bottomless reservoir of horrendously bad Schwarzenneger-style one-liners, (""Belt of Orion?"" screams our gas-torch wielding hero. ""How about Belt of O'FRYIN'?"" ), he begins investigating.

DECOYS isn't going to be included on anyone's list of the all-time greatest sci-fi horror flicks, but it definitely had us in stitches from start to finish. This is a film where a man hauled into the police station as the chief suspect for a string of murders will happily explain his crackpot theory about diabolical spacesluts, and never mention the fact that he has a rock solid alibi. It's the kind of film where the investigating detective (Richard Burgi in full ham mode) repeatedly - and inexplicably - refers to said suspect as ""puppy"". And it's the kind of film where the hero dresses up as a Ghostbuster, demands complete strangers show him their navels, and hurls boiling-hot water at them to prove they're not of this earth.

Quite frankly, the guy's clearly insane and should be locked up (whether he's correct or not!)",1193702400,,2246,5.0978260869565215

2072186,3,B00029QQRK,"In Decoys, a group of attractive blond women from another planet have come to earth to mate with the young men of a small college in Canada. They chose Canada because they need things cold. When they mate they lay their eggs inside of the man and if the incubation temperature isn't right, the man freezes to death from the inside. The incubation temperature must be very tricky because every guy they do it with dies. One guy, while hiding out in the girl's closet, discovers they are not normal and sets out to prove what they really are.

Decoys is reasonably well acted and played out considering the low budget. The effects are even not bad for this type of movie. Its biggest problem is not knowing what kind of movie it wants to be. Its not scary enough to be horror, the science is too basic to be science fiction, and it has a weird sense of humor, but its not funny enough to be a comedy. Decoys ends up being a decent, but strange and flawed movie.

Nicole Eggert is the only name actor in the film, but she is given virtually nothing to do. She only has 4 or 5 scenes and a few lines of dialog.",1155600000,,1106,4.23696682464455
2072187,2,B00029QQRK,"This movie was a bit frustrating.  Not for the reasons you might thing, though.  The plot was simple enough, but this was one movie that didn't know which way it wanted to go: horror comedy, or horror thriller (though the acting was actually pretty good, especially for a low-budget Canadian film).  Had it tried to be the former, and left out the serious stuff, it would have actually been pretty funny.  But, in the end, it tried to be the latter, and that is where is failed... so, I'd have to say, I wouldn't recommend this one for anything more that a one time, just for fun rental.",1125964800,6,587,4.407407407407407
2072188,2,B00029QQRK,"Man I wish I would read reviews before picking these kind of movies up from the video store.

This movie is about a couple of college freshmen who meet these 2 chicks that saduce them. But one of them left her laundry money in the laundry room (as Aliens do) and the nice freshman goes to return it, sneaks into her room, smells her cloths and has to hide in there closet 'cause they have returned (as would any normal person just hide instead of saying, ""I was returning your change"")

If that sounds cheesy enough, then the rest of the plot is a bunch of stupid tists and turns that don't play ell with each other. Guys on the campus are turning up dead because these aliens are screing them and laying there eggs in them, if there adaptable they ill survive, if they arnt, they freeze from the inside (at least I think thats what the idea of it was, I don't care to ever watch it again and find out) SO anyway the freshman has to play the hero, and lose some friends along the way.

The end of it is terrible, the only people who didn't predict the ending where either so stupid they didn't see them ending up together or just where doing the smart thing and not paying any attention to whats going on.

Too much unnesercery skin being shown for a bunch of girls in freezing wether conditions and just terrible plot points. Like why have a charactor who gets killed off have an intement moment with an alien for ten minutes, have them fall in love with each other, make you think these aliens are ok people, just a little misunderstood, then have the hero rampage the room, scare her away, then she'd done and finsished, goes home, untill the hero finds her and her friends and decides to BBQ them all. DUMB!

The movie had potentiol to be a decent film, but it went in all diffrent directions that it shouldnt have and had no tie in at the end. Dont buy this, don't rent it, just let it sit on the shelf to rot. Unless [...], you won't get any enjoyment out of this film.",1125878400,5,1975,4.256

Enter our virgin nerd and his ability to resist the naked charms of the aliens (even when he thinks they are normal).  The real question is not why the aliens are here, but are they good or bad.  Are they intentionally killing guys or is it an unwanted side effect?  That question helps drive the second half of the film.

When all is said and done, this really just seems like a college sex comedy.  Sure it has aliens and death but there is no real tension to make it really qualify as a horror film.  No real comedy either (but that is common with a lot of sex comedies).

2072194,3,B00029QQRK,"""Decoys"" is a little flick from our neighbors to the north.  It features a cast built up primarily of newcomers(at least to the U.S. audience)and some reasonably good special effects considering the budget.

The story centers around St. John's College(filmed at University of Ottawa) where a good chunk of the male population has started to come up missing or frozen from the inside out.  No one knows what's happening to these guys until one curious male student stumbles upon a pair of sorority sister cousins with some interesting appendages.  They lack belly buttons but have another surprise waiting for the boys in their unusual birthmarks.  The story unfolds from there as the student, Luke Callahan, attempts to uncover the girls for what they really are and to find out why they are freezing any and every amorous boy that they can get their hands on.  Of course, our hero becomes a suspect in the case, lead by an eager Canadian cop played by the recognizable Richard Burgi and his sidekick, the lovely but never quite a star, Nicole Eggert.

As stated before, the majority of this cast is comprised of newcomers excepting Burgi and Eggert.  Also, look out for the guy who plays ""Jay"" on ""Degrassi:  The Next Generation.""  Another little surprise was the coroner, played with tongue-firmly-in-cheek by veteran soap star Don Hastings.

The FX are pretty good.  The creatures look good in close-ups, but you can tell when a CGI model is used pretty easily.

The story isn't too terrible, but allow for the below-average acting and the sometimes hokey direction.  It's obvious that the director was trying to keep things reasonably light, as attested to in the ""Making Of"" documentary included on the DVD.  In other words, it seems like the cast and crew knew that this flick wasn't going to be a contender in the awards department, so they had fun making it.

There is some nudity and a lot of sensuality, usually followed by some swift violence.  The language isn't too horrible.  As a matter of fact, if you cut out the few scenes with nudity, this film probably would have registered a PG-13 rating in the U.S.

In the cheapjack horror flick ""Decoys"" - which might more accurately be entitled ""Sorority Chicks from Outer Space"" - aliens disguised as blond co-ed bimbos terrorize a college campus by turning horny frat boys into freeze-dried fudgsicles.  Luke is the freshman who uncovers the plot but can't get anyone to believe him.

Set on one of those college campuses in which the students pursue everything but their academic studies, ""Decoys"" can't seem to decide whether it wants to be a straight-ahead horror outing or a parody of the genre.  Unfortunately, it fails miserably at both, being neither scary nor funny, just idiotic and lame.

Decoys definitely has its moments, mostly because it doesn't take itself too seriously.

Back when I was a kid that was a major event for us film fans north of the border but these days low-budget sci-fi and action filmed in Canada is the norm.  But would these American production companies ever dare to set the story in Canada?  Rarely if ever.  They'll pretend Toronto is NYC or Vancouver the American Northwest.  Finally with ""Decoys"" we get a horror film from Canada, set in Canada and for Canada!  While Decoys is not the most original horror film in existence and is not likely to make me forget the films of David Cronenberg anytime soon, it is still definitely a great way to spend an hour and a half.  This one has chuckles and laughs aplenty!

The setting is St. John's college in Ottawa, a higher education institution where books are the day's calling and frat parties rule the night.  Luke and Roger are a couple of freshmen with one-track minds whose missions are to score as many babes as possible.  One night Luke meets a couple of blonde bombshells who live a few doors down from him.  Luke is enamoured but also mystified since school has been in session for months yet he's never seen the two until now.  While managing to sneak into the closet of their room and watching the two undress, he is horrified to see tentacles protruding from their back.  It is clear to Luke that these two girls are anything but normal.  And is it mere coincidence that their arrival on campus coincides with recent campus deaths where several male students were found frostbiten to death, their mouths wide open in a silent scream?  Luke seems to be the only kid on campus who doesn't think so, strangely enough.

The director himself has referred to his film as ""American Pie meets Species"", a very apt description.  It's a bit of an awkward film to categorize since it has the look and feel of after-school PG-13 horror yet is quite graphic in both the violence and nudity departments.  Is it original?  While the physical make-up of the ""Decoys"" is unique, in the end all we have is yet another campus horror film that reinforces stereotypes of modern teenagers to the Nth degree.  The guys are either extreme versions of jocks or nerds, except of course main character Luke who falls somewhere in between.  The girls on campus are all pop tarts except for Luke's goth friend Alex.  Yet when the ball is dropped these students somehow manage to outsmart the local police force AND the coroner.  And why can't modern thrillers ever serve up a happy ending anymore?  Enough with the ""we're so clever"" cornball twist endings.

If you look at it as a classic horror film, you'll be disappointed. DECOYS is definitely a tongue-in-cheek marriage of comedy and horror, unashamedly borrowing elements from films in both genres.

The real value of the DVD lies in the deleted scenes and bloopers, both of which fill in frustrating gaps in the plot and give a real sense of what the film was intended to be; funny, sometimes over the top, undeniably goofy -- sort of a horror version of Airplane!

It's a pity some of the deleted scenes included in the DVD didn't make it into the film, as they fill in some gaps in the story that otherwise leave you scratching your head. Richard (Det. Kirk) Burgi's scenes with Corey (Luke) Sevier and Lilly (Stephanie Von Pfetten) are delightfully goofy and fun and explain a whole lot about Kirk's behavior throughout the film.

The bloopers... here's where you see why the cast say they all had a blast making this film. Burgi and Sevier have to fight to maintain straight faces around each other, often just giving up and collapsing into gales of laughter. :-)

DECOYS is definitely one of the ""your mileage may vary"" DVDs, but if you enjoy Richard Burgi's work, grab it!",1092268800,13,1208,4.626168224299065

 (a way better movie). Another one of those ""invasion of the body snatchers"" type of movies. Your friends are now aliens and you will be soon too. worth a rental (maybe)...i wouldnt buy it",1091664000,,286,4.296296296296297

8024676,4,B00029QQRK,This movie surprised me.  It really wasn't that bad in a bad movie that is kind of entertaining in a way...lol.  Some nerds in a college get hit on by some very attractive sorority sisters that happen to be aliens that need to breed.  Don't expect E.T. or even Species but if you want some good silliness with some boobies thrown in...pick this little Canadian gem up.  There is a behind the scenes featurette about the making of the film.,1456876800,,439,4.45
8024677,4,B00029QQRK,"Released in 2004, Decoys chronicles events at a Canadian campus where female aliens masquerade as hot blondes and seduce male students in order to perpetuate their dying species. Corey Sevier plays the protagonist with likable Elias Toufexis as his best friend and Meghan Ory as his maybe-girlfriend. Stefanie von Pfetten and Kim Poirier play the key alien babes. Richard Burgi plays a detective and Nicole Eggert a police officer.

Decoys mixes elements of 1995s Species with the campus environment of 1998s Urban Legend. It can't compete with the former but it's marginally better than the latter IMHO. While many people hate this film I give it a relatively high rating simply because its entertaining, which is my main criteria for the worthiness of any movie. Decoys hits most of the mandatory checkboxes for an effective horror flick. I particularly liked the campus-in-the-dead-of-winter location, which no other slasher/monster flick has done to my knowledge, except the sequel, 2007s Decoys 2: Alien Seduction. Maybe the reason horror aficionados dislike it is because it has so much humor and camp. I usually don't like horror films that mix-in comedy, like 2002s crappy Cabin Fever, but Decoys and its equally-good sequel mix them in a palatable way. Neither of these movies is scary, although there are a couple of got ya scenes and the aliens are hideous, but they're satisfyingly amusing with good casts and superb women.

The film runs 95 minutes and shot in Ottawa, Ontario, mainly the University of Ottawa.

You don't need to see Decoys to watch Decoys II, In Decoys the whole movie is taken up by the decoy concept and developement (low budget) and since the concept was a sucess in Decoy (even if the movie was so so), it got them a budget to make a real movie:  Decoys II, Decoys II does the concept and developement in the 1st part of the movie and then you get to watch an actual movie.",1414108800,,534,4.085714285714285

8024684,3,B00029QQRK,"This movie has a very thin plot. Aliens from a planet where it's inhabitants are dying come to a college to mate with the human males and save their race from extinction. That's all. If you've seen Species then you know the basic idea. The difference is great though. I think Species was really entertaining. This movie wasn't close to that good. It has some ok comedy moments in it, but that's it. I wouldn't buy this movie. It's not a bad rental idea though.",1351987200,,460,4.423529411764706
