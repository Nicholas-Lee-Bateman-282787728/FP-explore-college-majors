5661723,1,B00BO60G6C,This documentary COULD have been great but instead it is pretty much all about one study. Not that interesting  and by the end I was left extremely disappointed because I was hoping for  so much more. I watched it with my friend who is studying psychology and we were both left empty by the end.,1415923200,2,295,4.345454545454546
5661724,4,B00BO60G6C,"There are three aspects: 1) following returned soldiers, peering into their post-traumatic-stress lives (GOOD), 2) following an experiment to help traumatized returned soldiers meditate (GOOD), 3) trying to show by graphics the mental stress that the soldiers must be feeling (IDIOTIC).  There was way too much of (3).  I would have cut most of the scary, loud music accompanied by crazy art graphics out, and then focussed on more soldiers instead.  The very best parts were the interviews with the soldiers themselves, and also showing the professionals working to teach the soldiers how to quieten their minds.  More of that, please, and I'd give it 5 stars.  The effort to do this work is amazing and both the work (and the plight of returned soldiers) needs to be publicized.",1415491200,5,780,5.015503875968992

5661726,2,B00BO60G6C,"I love the possibility of utilizing meditation to alter the brain. I was really hoping to see evidence of that here. I felt a little misled by the successes as I didn't feel this movie showed the link between the two. I would have liked to have gotten more hard evidence, changes in size of the hippocampus, for instance or before and after MRI scans. The meditation therapy with the boy was dubious. The love of the parents, friends etc and assurances from staff seemed more prevalent and likely more therapeutic.",1412553600,2,514,4.65934065934066
5661727,1,B00BO60G6C,Movie subject matter was great but music/soundtrack was so loud relative to dialogue parts of movie were literally unwatchable.  Maybe im the only one?,1412467200,7,151,5.291666666666667
5661728,5,B00BO60G6C,"I enjoyed this film. You find yourself really caring about the adults and children that are struggling with emotional problems in their life.  It's not a ""this cures everything"" type documentary, but a more look into a subject that is being studied and finding the positive results encouraging. The kindness and understanding that is given to these people under going this study is in itself feels good to watch. You will find yourself really hoping  for them and for all of us.",1411776000,2,478,4.817073170731708
5661729,5,B00BO60G6C,"It was so amazing to see the results and improvement the experimenters and instructors achieved with everyone from children with ADHD, to returning war veterans with PTSD! You may well shed a few tears of joy at the simple act of watching a young child overcome his fear of elevators! If you, as I, have always believed that the mind can overcome most any adversity and that you don't need to medicate for everything in life, you will be vindicated, after watching ""Free the Mind."" We will be watching again to apply many of the principles and exercises to our own family!",1408492800,2,572,4.617647058823529

5661731,4,B00BO60G6C,I have recommended to it to my daughter and friends who are interested in mindfulness meditation. I took train and bus to San Francisco to see the documentary in a theater. I bought a DVD as wellas  multi-region DVD player from Amazon to see it again at home.,1382918400,2,259,4.395833333333333
5661732,5,B00BO60G6C,"I saw this film during the Milwaukee Film Festival in 2013.  I urge anyone interested in teaching, social work, or parenting to view this remarkable production by a team from Finland( smartest country) and Denmark (happiest country.) The filming was done in Madison, WI at the Neuroscience lab using the University's Preschool and  University Meditation Room.
Using EEG's showing the positive effects of deep meditation. deep breathing, and yoga stretches, the process freed a child terrified of elevators. A pair of veterans haunted by memories of war  share their experiences and gradually learn to accept their pain and move on... It appears that these techniques help free patients suffering from fear and other traumas without using  medication.
This is a valuable tool for ADHD and PTSD sufferers.  Highly recommend- alas! not in regular DVD format!",1382227200,6,855,5.303703703703704
8571824,1,B00BO60G6C,"The concept, subject matter, pedigree of Davidson, and timeliness of this make it seem like an incredibly worthy film to watch...instead it is a completely worthless investment of your time...unless you like reading the first and last pages of a book. The movie set up is great and the conclusions (while predictable) are still noteworthy from such a small sample. What lies in the middle you ask....nothing...literally nothing but ridiculous character drama, seeing Davidson talk about that one time he met the Dali Lama, seeing Davidson meditate to a picture of the Dali Lama's face, seeing how awesome Davidson's perm is at all times of the day, seeing the one kid who has a lot of issues and the heavy-set Asian guy who has a lot issues in various environments, and...yeah that is it...oh, odd sound effects and occasional interjections by some grad students. No science, no explanation of why the hell it is they are doing any of what they are doing...or even what it is they are doing...and why they only did it for seven days...What are the theoretical foundations of this, what are the implications to the brain as this process happens, what again is this exact process and how again does it function???? Yeah, none of that.. Complete garbage and Davidson should be ashamed of this, or ashamed that he thinks this is how the layman needs treated when dealing with ""science."" Save your cash and listen to an Alan Watts recording on youtube or Siegel's piece on mindfulness.",1494806400,,1480,4.853754940711463
8571825,5,B00BO60G6C,"Davidson and his close associates, are among the few at the forefront of serious research into the benefits of Indo-Tibetan Buddhist mindfulness and compassion practices.  Using hard science coupled with expertly guided Buddhist practices, Davidson and co. are placing some of the best the East has to offer upon the examination table, to reveal for us ... well let's say ... we may get an answer to the question:  Why are these folks ( Buddhist monks) so daggum happy ?",1481241600,,470,4.8625

8571827,5,B00BO60G6C,"I enjoy very much, this type of documentary ! More please!",1469318400,,58,4.363636363636363
8571828,5,B00BO60G6C,"This is a description of a small study performed at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, WI concerning the ability to help people cope with stress responses through the use of meditation.  There were two cases that were detailed: The first, a young man that had served in Iraq that was having trouble re-integrating into society and the second, a young boy that had been in the foster care system for much of his life that had developed a number of responses that were not useful in his interactions with the people in his life.  The study was fairly short, but had very positive results even in that short period.  I found it very interesting.

In the last few years there has been studies that show a person's brain development can be impacted due to stress in their living environment.  This movie made me consider that perhaps these changes are not necessarily permanent, but that also stress can have profound impacts on the brain even later in life, not just during early development.

This movie may give you a little bit of appreciation for the issues people going through life with ptsd, whatever the source.",1441411200,2,1120,4.717948717948718

8571830,5,B00BO60G6C,I actually saw this documentry in a theator and loved everything about it. Feels like an extreamly powerful meathed for easing PTSD in anyone who suffers from it. I wish this was offered at every VA office in the country.,1419379200,5,221,4.55
8571831,1,B00BO60G6C,the background music is horrible and distracting. Can't even hear the commentaries. what a waste of money for this movie.,1419033600,,121,5.1
8571832,4,B00BO60G6C,"Meditation has been around for ages and as it turns out, it's more than just some obscure, ancient religious practice or some new age silliness.  This documentary looks at how it can be used to help people who have experienced trauma, anxiety, PTSD, etc. and how it is making a difference in their lives.

There are many different types of meditation and it's a powerful tool available to everyone.  It doesn't cost anything, it does not have to be a part of a religious practice, there are countless resources available (many of them free) for people who are interested in it and there is no reason to be intimidated by it.

I speak from first-hand experience.  I was in an unhealthy emotional space.  My mind chatter was incessant and extremely toxic.  I've meditated 20-30 minutes every single day for the last 27 days.  The more I do it, the more I want to do it.  I'm not a morning person but I actually look forward to waking up extra early every day so I can have my quiet time.  Mostly, I practice a type of mindfulness meditation.  I find I'm much gentler with myself, I feel better emotionally, I'm grateful for things I used to take for granted, I'm approaching life from a much healthier mindset and I've only barely scratched the surface.  I have a lot more to explore in this area.

I can't recommend it enough and I really with more people would give it serious consideration.  I think the world would be a much better place.  Perhaps watching this documentary will open people's minds to the idea of beginning their own meditation practice.",1417910400,10,1556,4.586956521739131
8571833,5,B00BO60G6C,Phenominal movie for anyone wanting to learn more about how the brain works and it's effects from meditation and stress relief techniques. Dr Richard Davidson is a pioneer in the Neuroscience field of study and has done extensive work with experienced meditation practitioners. This film inspires me to meditate every day any time I watch it.,1416528000,,342,5.125
