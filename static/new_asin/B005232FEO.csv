She falls in love with a married man,though, and becomes a back street girl-the mistress of a millionaire. If you like an old-style romance/drama, you will love this film. Excellent acting, engaging story, emotional ups and downs. Enjoy this film and keep the tissues handy. Must see viewing.",1487808000,,379,5.229508196721311

8453490,2,B005232FEO,"The quality of this DVD is poor with full snow in a couple of places.  The DVD was bought from a seller in MI, but the DVD came from ""Loving The Classics"".  Wouldn't have known but received an e-mail from them apollogizing for the delay.  I really love this movie and hope that sometime in the near future a clean copy can be purchased.",1363478400,7,336,4.21875
8453491,2,B005232FEO,"I can't believe the 1932 Irene Dunne version of this film is not on DVD.  I saw it many years ago on TCM, and later saw the 1941 version with Margaret Sullavan.  Much as I love Margaret, and liked the 1941 version, the 1932 Irene Dunne version is much, much better, not least of all because it was made before the Hays Act, and is therefore much more honest, raw, and risque.  The 1941 version is downright tame and tepid in comparison.  It's a cinematic crime that this film is not available.

Four stars for the film, zero for the $99 price -- are you kidding???? -- so it averages out to two stars.",1362614400,4,601,4.2368421052631575
