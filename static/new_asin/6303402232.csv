Needless to say, I'm devestated to learn this wonderful story of ""Mr. Thibedeaux Tackles The Punks And Wins!"" has never made it to DVD. A real video tragedy. Please contact me if/when it's re-released......I'll purchase SEVERAL copies for gifts. Oh, and Mr. Thibedeaux, know I still love you....you are my HERO!!!!",1323820800,,441,4.594936708860759
641876,3,6303402232,"This a great action film, more than good enough to be on DVD, don't you think? I'm saddened every day by the older films that don't make it to DVD, and shocked at some of the things that do. There doesn't seem to be any real criteria for either situation. Anything with Charles Durning as the star is usually worth watching. This would be a great movie for all grandpas to watch with their grandsons. It's never going to happen though.",1321401600,3,435,4.382716049382716
641877,4,6303402232,One of Charles Durning's best acting jobs. An excellent movie about standing up for yourself. I saw it on t.v. and had to buy the tape. Great entertainment.,1310947200,,156,4.607142857142857
641878,3,6303402232,Tell me I'm wrong.  Grand Torino borrows liberallly from the plot of Stand Alone.  I Saw this movie over 20 years ago and it still resonates with me.  Worth a watch.,1289433600,2,165,4.258064516129032
641879,4,6303402232,I saw this movie years ago...it hasn't suffered any in that time..first time I saw a movie with character actor Charles Durning being the lead...he does a great job...also Pam Grier is terrific as the public defender...good way to spend a couple hours...Charles Durning plays a WWII vet who defends friends and family from a gang,1270425600,2,329,4.892857142857143

Good theme, good movie.",1420156800,,94,4.8125
7846287,5,6303402232,"I had seen this movie many years ago. When I received this, my husband and I sat down that evening and watched it. Charles Durning was an outstanding actor. For those of you who don't know it, he actually was a prisoner of war. A proud and distinguished man he was.",1419897600,2,265,4.215686274509804
7846288,5,6303402232,Haven't watched it yet.  But enjoyed the movie years ago.  One of Durnings best.  Happy holidays and have a great new year.,1386374400,,123,4.5
7846289,5,6303402232,Charles Durning was a fine actor and he did a great job in this film. It tells the story of one mans battle to keep his own freedom and to raise his grandson to know what the cost of freedom is. This movie was a long time coming out on DVD should you get it you will enjoy it.,1384992000,3,276,3.694915254237288
7846290,5,6303402232,If you are into the good guy ends up on top you will love this film.  I feel this is one of those films that was overlooked maybe because of less visual effects and better writing.  I think this was Charles Durnings better films considering he has been in many.  This is the basic good verses evil plot. A retired war hero who does the right thing only to be abandoned by the police and on his own.  I hope you enjoy it as much as I do.,1379980800,,436,3.9204545454545454
7846291,5,6303402232,"I cannot believe that they won't put this movie to DVD. It is about the Amazing American Spirit...the spirt that the Liberals want to crush and banish.

The real point of this movie is we all have the power to stop evil and Charles Durring was perfect for the starring role...He was a really a WW2 hero.

Today we don't have men of the caliber of this man in real life. Humble beginings with ambition, integrity and honor. No scandles just a life of hard work after being wounded 3 times, one from a German Soldier who bayonetted him...Durring killed that man with a rock.

Those of the Greatest Generation like Charles Durring are dying now, and with them goes that great American Spirit of honor, courage, patriotism and integrity. Its replaced with generations of Timid wannabee's addicted to PRETENDING to be warriors in the safety of their living rooms and a Monitor...

This movie is not being released on DVD because its politically incorrect. Its not what this governments wants us to see... but they will release mindless crap movies by the thousands.

Hitler would be so proud that his Socialist Agenda is alive and well and destroying America.",1356393600,3,1154,4.75
