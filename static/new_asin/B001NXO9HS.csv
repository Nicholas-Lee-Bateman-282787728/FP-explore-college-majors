8328134,5,B001NXO9HS,"This is definitely a movie worth watching for anyone who had been through an intense friendship of the youth.  It is very easy to see how this movie ended up inspiring and influencing some of the most prolific school boys love mangakas in Japan around late '70's such as Hagio Moto and Takemia Keiko (considered founders of the BL movement there). You can still see its influence in today's popular works such as those by Nekota Yonezou's. Although the story line itself is thankfully no longer as relevant, the emotions behind the relationships are simply human. The acting by all the cast is simply top notch! I simply love watching this movie and had done so over and over again. What a gem of a French cinematic masterpiece!",1431734400,4,728,4.6875
