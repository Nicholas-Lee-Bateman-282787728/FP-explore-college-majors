8141517,3,B000B69TAA,"A few years back I attended a Peform Better course that incoroporated decleration drills from the Parisi Speed School and wanted to get more information on their methods.  I purchased the DVD hoping that it would provide me with newer concepts on the aspects of decelaration training related to speed and agility.  Unfortunately most of the DVD contained basic strength and conditoining knowledge and principles.  It was more of a review of methods that I use everyday. I probably took aways about 3-4 new drills I could currently use.

If you're a novice to sports performance you may enjoy this, but other than that I would not recommend.",1373414400,,640,4.898148148148148
