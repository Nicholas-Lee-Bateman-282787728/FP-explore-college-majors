6284171,5,B00IOFN0NM,"THE BIG COUNTRY, THE HORSE SOLDIERS and THE LONG RIDERS is certainly a diverse group of Westerns. These 3 films represent different times and perspectives dealing with the Western genre. Two have definite ties to the American Civil War and reconstruction.

Director Walter Hill's post Civil War film, THE LONG RIDERS is a very memorable and distinguished Western for its visual and visceral style. It is somewhat forgotten, but is one of Walter Hill's best films. It ranks as one of the most underrated Westerns ever made. This is great and innovative filmmaking. One thing that makes this film so distinctive is the actors who are pairs of actual brothers portraying their characters who are brothers on the screen. It is not only innovative, but strengthens the film and the narrative. Jesse James and Frank James are played by James Keach and Stacy Keach. Cole Younger, Jim Younger and Bob Younger are played by David Carradine, Keith Carradine and Robert Carradine. Ed Miller and Clell Miller were played by Dennis Quaid and Randy Quaid. The centerpiece of this film is the James-Younger Gang and the robbery at Northfield, Minnesota. Seemingly, everything that can go wrong does go wrong. The debacle of the Northfield, Minnesota raid, the pursuing gun battle and escape are extraordinarily filmed and edited. This sequence has a lot in common with the opening scene of Sam Peckinpah's THE WILD BUNCH. Walter Hill's direction here is not a homage, but an extension of Peckinpah's extension and ability to capture the moment in both real time and slow motion.

THE HORSE SOLDIERS is a very entertaining and interesting cavalry film set during the Civil War from director John Ford. Usually Ford gives us an image of the United States Cavalry in all its might and splendor defending the frontier against Indians against the backdrop of Monument Valley. During the film's credits we no longer see a grand and glorious image of Ford's beloved cavalry. Instead we see a tired line of cavalrymen on horseback moving along in a slow and weary pace. The image is contemplative and moving and unlike John Ford's previous films. In THE HORSE SOLDIERS the cavalry, again commanded by John Wayne is relegated to a mission during the Civil War deep behind Confederate lines. They are on a mission of mayhem and destruction, which is repugnant to Wayne. This is really contrary to earlier Ford films where the cavalry is a defender of society. William Holden, the doctor assigned to Wayne's staff is there to remind Wayne of just how futile War is and that his own talents as a doctor are being squandered in the conflict. This is actually a great film from Ford and it is a treat because Civil War films have always been too few and far apart. This is a film about duty, loyalties and misconceptions. The images in this film are indelible. The scene where the Confederate military school sends out its young boys to face Wayne's cavalry is unforgettable. The film also asks the viewer through its images some hard questions about the nobility of the Southern society vs. that of the rag tag looking Union cavalry. As much as it looks like a John Ford film it thematically feels a bit different. There is sentimentality to be sure, but it is often bitter sweet. This is a much deeper film than it appears or has been given credit. THE HORSE SOLDIERS is one of cinematographer William Clothier's finest works with such rural scenes characterized by brilliant autumnal colors. The cast is a strong one and also includes Constance Towers, Ken Curtis, Denver Pyle, Strother Martin, Hank Worden, Willis Bouchey, Judson Pratt, Hoot Gibson, Bing Russell and Althea Gibson. John Ford's THE HORSE SOLDIERS is a classic. This is my favorite John Ford film.

Gregory Peck is a very introspective actor. This character trait of his fits certain roles beautifully. I think Gregory Peck's best performance was in 1958s THE BIG COUNTRY. THE BIG COUNTRY is based on Donald Hamilton's novel of the same name. Gregory Peck plays the central character named James McKay. McKay was a sea captain who looked and acted like something of a dandy as he relocated out west from back east to marry his fiance. McKay was a man who had nothing to prove to anyone but himself. I read the novel. Gregory Peck is James McKay. Peck chose this project and co-produced it because I think he recognized that particular character in the novel that mirrored his approach to many of the roles he chose. There are wooden people in everyday life. What is behind the wooden veneer? I think that a good actor takes the roles that work best for them. Look at Peck's performance as Lewt in DUEL IN THE SUN. That is not one of Peck's typical performances. I wonder after all these years what Peck's critique would be to his performance in that film. If you do watch THE BIG COUNTRY I think that Peck actually makes very subtle references to his performance in DUEL IN THE SUN with his awkward attempt at humor, which is consistent with the character of James McKay. THE BIG COUNTRY is one of America's greatest films. It is blessed with one of the finest scores ever written for an American film. What composer Jerome Moross gave us was true Americana as well as music in the Western genre. This score captures the spirit of what made America great. America is made up of different people and different ideals. Charlton Heston as Steve Leech, in what I think was also his best role and performance, showed us an overly assertive male quality. When he finally confronts McKay he comes away with a self-realization about his own motivations and what being a man really means. Later when put to the test he is truly torn for the first time between good sense and loyalty to the selfish and tyrannical Maj. Henry Terrill (Charles Bickford). Only the viewer can draw a conclusion on his actions. The pivotal music by Jerome Moross in this scene will tear your emotions apart. Burl Ives as Rufus Hannassey won an Academy Award for his role. For me he was the most enigmatic character in this film. Is he as tyrannical as his nemesis Henry Terrill is or not? I am still perplexed. Another good performance in this film was by Chuck Connors as the tragic Buck Hannassey. Chuck Connors as an actor deserved infinitely more recognition than he ever got and this film proves it. This was not a film of black and white characterizations. There was a lot of gray. I saw this film in the theatre when I was a little kid when it first got released. It is very strong on imagery. My heart went out to Chuck Connors as Buck Hannassey in the finale and it still does when I watch it today. This is one of my ten or so favorite films. It is slow and deliberate. It is not flashy. The critics at the time were very wrong. It is a long movie yet there is not a wasted shot in it. It packs a greater emotional punch every time I watch it. The older you get, the more you can identify with it. I was lucky enough to see it the first time when I was very young. This film has something knew to teach you every time you watch it. And the widescreen process, THE BIG COUNTRY takes full advantage of it and defines it for the genre.",1423526400,6,7151,4.642462509865825
