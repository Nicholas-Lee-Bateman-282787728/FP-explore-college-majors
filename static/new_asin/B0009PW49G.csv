It has all of the same tracks that are on the CD, with no real extras, but it's KISS!  The band is mostly Paul, Gene, Eric (Singer), and Bruce.  For the last four songs Ace and Peter come on and have an all out KISS-fest!  All of the songs sound fantastic, especially ""A World Without Heroes"" and ""See You Tonight"".  The crowd pleasing ""Nothin' To Lose"" is great and ends with the compulsory ""Rock And Roll All Nite""!

Enjoy it!  But you'll want to buy the CD to go along with it....",1181433600,2,930,3.994475138121547

2311114,2,B0009PW49G,"This DVD was better than the 1st one that I purchased [Diary of Alicia Keys-Documentary, this was a real waste of my money], she is at least singing in this one!  The product is not MTV material, it lacks a certain something, I felt that there was something missing in watching this DVD.  It could be my fault because I was expecting the DVD to match the quality of her music.

Why can she not make a home version of a DVD that are played on MTV, they look and feel so much better than this DVD was.  Unless I have a guest over who likes her, I will achieve the DVD because it is not worth watching again.

One day I hope to purchase a DVD from her that has that certain something where the DVD is really unplugged!",1151193600,,715,4.078571428571428
2311115,5,B0009PW49G,"One of the most phenomenal DVDs in recent memory, ""Alicia Keys: Unplugged"" is one of the first MTV Unplugged DVDs released since Lauryn Hill's performance dating back to 2002. This DVD has proved to be the consummate entertainment experience. With a wide variety of music displayed in the contents of this video, which include Smooth Jazz, Pop, Funk, R&B, Blues, and Reggae, the genius of Alicia Keys & her band led by keyboardist/producer/musical director Onree Gill literally drive the audience into the past, present and the future of what true musicianship is all about. Every song is conveyed with strong skills and a sensational spirit. There is nothing but sheer quality seeping through this masterpiece! The album starts with an a capella prayer sung by Alicia which covers the traditional gospel pieces ""Father, I Stretch My Hands..."" & ""Remember Me."" As soon as the prayer posts, the band punctuated by a powerfully charged orchestra and strings team arranged by the great Ray Chew alongside resolute horn arrangements by Chops lend their staggering musical energy to the hit song, ""Karma."" One thing that's clearly understated with Alicia Keys is the fact that she is selfless, is always eager to get the crowd involved and offers the other performers an opportunity to access their creative intensity. Such is the case when background vocalist Jermaine Paul sings on ""Heartburn"" and harmonizes with Alicia on ""If I Ain't Got You."" Anaysha Figueroa, who sings background for Kirk Franklin, Sara Devine and Denise Stoudmire all blend their vocal talents in background and ad libs. Alicia has also really blossomed in her performance. Vocally, she digs deeper with more soul and vigor. She has so much fun with ""Heartburn,"" ""Unbreakable,"" and literally riffs like crazy on ""How Come You Don't Call Me"" [giving Prince a run for his money] and ""A Woman's Worth,"" which slickly and gracefully covers the Isley Brothers' ""Footsteps in the Dark."" Other exclusive performances include, ""Diary,"" [no need to explain that song lol!] ""Every Little Bit Hurts,"" a reference to Nasir ""Nas"" Jones' classic from ""Illmatic,"" ""NY State of Mind"" in her original poem ""Streets of New York,"" (a.k.a. ""City Life"") which has a staggering jazz arrangement coupled with strong vocals that put you in the mindframe of Stevie Wonder's ""Living for the City."" ""Stolen Moments"" is one of my favorite songs as well as the fusion of Hip-Hop, Soul, & Reggae in the medley, ""Love It or Leave It Alone/Welcome to Jamrock"" featuring Common, Mos Def, Damian ""Jr. Gong"" Marley & Alicia's MBK team. Maroon 5's Adam Levine makes a surprise appearance with his acoustic guitar and amazing falsetto on ""Wild Horses."" This performance is a gem that has more than lived up to its hype and publicity. Get ready for Alicia Keys' upcoming tour & new album slated for release in the fall of 2006!!!",1143849600,12,2861,5.025263157894737
2311116,5,B0009PW49G,"On July 14, 2005, I was about to fly from Charleston (SC) to my family reunion in Cleveland, Ohio. Little did I know that at that moment, Alicia Keys was rocking the house in Brooklyn in a performance that would later spend a lot of time ion my DVD player.

""Unbreakable"" is a beautiful celebration of love and African-American culture (check the lyrics). The duet with Adam Levine ""Wild Horses"" gets no complaint from me and I particularly like the remake of ""Every Little Bit Hurts""

I could go on and on about the songs. The poetry I found interesting and an example of her versatility. But hey, Alicia shows here she has far more talent in one finger than 95% of the Booty shaking bimbos that clutter the industry today (with India Arie, Heather Headley, and Vivian Greene also in the running).

I have to admit to wondering why Common and Mos Def barely appear for a few seconds near the end, and it was kinda nice to see Damien Marley rock it up with the crowd (and Alicia's mother) at the end. But overall, this is an evening with one of the FEW true talents of our time. Get it and see.",1139616000,3,1094,4.352941176470588
2311117,5,B0009PW49G,"WOW! Soul music neva sounded so good sista! You'll go from one song to the next appreciating everything this girl selects and plays. I was also very impressed with her duet partners, especially loved the song ""Wild Horses""...WOW. A must have.",1137628800,2,242,4.926829268292683
2311135,4,B0009PW49G,"Alicia is one of the few truly talented R&B artists. The word artist in this case is not some generic title but a word that truly emcompasses what Alicia Keys is. That being said, she's excellent live. Her rendition of ""If I Were Your Woman"" is much better than her album re-make. She puts her all into all of the songs. Where I fault this concert is when she duets with others. Adam Levine was not necessary and neither was the ending. The conclusion actually hurt the overall concert with the rapping. Also what greatly hurt the performance was the poem. That was dreadful. Thank goodness for DVD because you can easily skip it as well the the other two mentioned.

I was going to give three stars but my wife loved it to pieces except for the songs I mentioned but she doesn't seem to think it would be any less than 4 stars.

I just wish her label would release a proper live concert, where she truly excels.",1133136000,4,912,4.358823529411764
2311136,5,B0009PW49G,"TOP, TOP notch DVD for your collection.  I have 40+ Music/Concert DVDs.  This one is one of the special ones.  The audio quality is AWESOME.  Much better depth and layering of musicians than even great DVDs like Alison Krauss + Union Station.  A bit exaggerated with the bass on some tunes, but that can be dealt with.

Her performance (and the band) are STELLAR.  She is simply a joy to watch.  Camera angles are simple and appropriate.  Video quality is excellent.

I watch this 2-3 times per week...and I always think it will be a couple songs...and ends up being the entire disc.

GET IT.  You will not be sorry.",1131667200,16,616,4.5
2311137,5,B0009PW49G,Great performance.  She is one of the most talented black female artist of today.,1129593600,5,81,4.785714285714286
2311138,4,B0009PW49G,"This is a DVD with the extras as if you were at a concert of hers. I have gone to one of her concerts, and this is exactly how she plays true, beautifully, and with sex appeal. Her renditions are not only unique and creative, but they keep the very same appeal as their originals. This DVD is shot very well, and sounds great. Just the simple things you should be looking for in the music DVDs. If you enjoy her music, then you surely should enjoy this item.",1129593600,8,458,4.157303370786517
2311139,5,B0009PW49G,"This a great add to the superb CD. MTV showed about 5 less performance. To her stage presence is the words of TOMKAT ""Amazing""",1129161600,2,126,4.291666666666667
2311140,5,B0009PW49G,"There are a few artists who are in a class all their own. Alicia is one such artist.  Don't take my word for it. See and listen for yourself. This DVD/CD is a must for anyone who can appreciate genuine vocals, live bands, and real music.",1129075200,3,237,4.1521739130434785
2311141,5,B0009PW49G,"To borrow from Nick Hornby's ""High Fidelity"", I like to think of myself as a professional music appreciator. Now I don't claim to know every last thing about music of all sorts, I am 15, but I have to say that I usually decide I like things that are widely accepted to be good. You know, I like The Beatles, Pink Floyd, Bob Dylan, Elvis Costello (though some don't know who he is and some can't bear with him through his changes), and plenty other people from most genres but rap, and on more than just a greatest-hits-only basis. I can't say as though I see a lot of hope in the present music scene, it being dominated by bands who think they're as good as the best but could only wish they were. Then you've got people who only listen to the mediocre music they make because they don't know there's anything better because they can't look farther back than five years ago. Well, Alicia Keys is someone who can look back.

Now, I haven't seen this DVD, but I've seen the performance on MTV which has about 5 less songs, and I must say that Alicia is excellent on this. I bought both of her albums because I see a strong potential in her, but sometimes her lesser taste shows. Example: I liked the regular version of ""If I Ain't Got You"" just fine, except for that annoying and unnecessary beat overtop of it. The song even had regular acoustic drums on it, which were perfectly adequate, but for some reason they just had to throw overtop that artificial beat to give it more bass or something, becuase that's what the kids like or whatever. Well, here we have none of that stuff.

Here we get Alicia's music in its purest form. This is the reason we have MTV Unplugged and like shows such as VH1 Storytellers and the Meltdown Festival. Nirvana showed that they were a very musically good band and that there was substance to their work beyond the layers of grungey distortion that is their trademark. Bruce Springsteen recently gave us an acoustic performance on Storytellers that really blew me away and that is another DVD I must get. But here we get a performance that really stands out in my head because she is so young. She's one of this new breed of young people who you don't necessarily see on TV yet who can appreciate older music, learn from it, and channel it, much like Bob Dylan did. Alicia has an amazing talent and songwriting gift, not to mention an excellent voice, and here she shows it.

She treats us to some alternate versions to some songs, some better, some fall a little flat, but are still miles beyond most people's now. I didn't care a lot for this version of ""Karma"" and I questioned why she did it first, but the switch to ""Heartburn"" was clever and that version of the song was better. She gives us a stripped down version of ""If I Ain't Got You"" with only her singing and playing piano, the backing singers adding exquisite parts and a few little cymbal crescendos on the choruses. Her band is excellent and she plays well herself. She has another keyboard player, two drummers, an electric standup bassist, a guitarist, and a small string and horn section, as well as four backing singers (but I think there was one too many of them), adding up to roughly twenty people on stage.

When she brought out onto the stage Adam Levine for The Rolling Stones' ""Wild Horses"", I was surprised, curious, and a little worried. On top of it being a fair enough classic, I had just heard Elvis Costello and The Imposters and Emmylou Harris with Larry Campbell sing it in concert. I was not setting my hopes unrealistically high and expecting Alicia and Adam to play it better here. The problem with the performance was Adam's voice. The two did not blend very well together. They have basically the same tonal range, but his voice is very nasal and they didn't exactly harmonize with each other. You'd think him being a guy would sing a lower part and she would sing on top of him but they both sang basically the same thing and it didn't sound as good as it could have. At least they didn't play that long.

So all in all, her performance was excellent and I am very excited to buy this DVD and once I do I'll update this review to make it more specific and to comment on the DVD extras, but her performance was so good I just felt complelled to write a review now.",1128988800,6,4288,4.409090909090909
