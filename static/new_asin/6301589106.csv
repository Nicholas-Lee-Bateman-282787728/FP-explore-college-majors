340221,5,6301589106,"I've practically grown up on this movie since I was 11, and I never fail to find something new in every viewing. Full of surprisingly subtle satire and intelligent commentary (really!) under the slapstick, there is more,  much more than meets the eye here. Others see a silly, pointless movie; I  see a unique and refreshing kind of filmmaking. The cenimatography itself  is worth the rental price--not bad for a movie that director yahoo had to  sell almost everything he owned to make! :)
""Young Einstein"" is  now considered a cult movie,and it easy to see why. Approach it with an  open mind and you'll be amazed at what you'll find!",962928000,6,636,4.684684684684685
340222,4,6301589106,"This was definitely an entertaining film.  It has some strong writing along with a solid acting job cashed in by Yahoo Serious, and some truly hilarious specific scenes.  Villainry is a little corny in this film, and  there are some silly concepts, but this all-inall, a quality, wortwhile  film to see for any age group",946771200,,320,4.763636363636364
340223,5,6301589106,"This movie is so cool. I hope Yahoo Serious made a profit on this production. This is a classic fish out of water story. Here is a guy with nothing and comes up with E=MCsquare. (We all know what this means) and the  whole world just laughs at him until Mary believes him and Preston steals  the formula from him. This moive is one of my favorites. You must buy this  one, it is a lot of fun. Also, wherever this guy goes, apples come out of  nowhere.",922752000,2,451,4.090909090909091
340225,5,6301589106,"I found ""Young Einstein"" to be so, so so side-splittingly funny, I almost died laughing. More so, because my wife is an astrophysicist.
I think that this movie should be required viewing for all physicists.
The  scene with the cats in the pie is possibly the #1 or #2 absolute funniest  scene in all of movie history, way up there with the best of the Marx Bros,  Monty Python, early Woody Allen, Charlie Chaplin, etc.
The fantastic  romance of young Einstein and young Marie Curie is one of the most  memorable screen romances, up there with Bogie and Katherine Hepburn, Lara  and Dr. Zhivago, Cleopatra and Antony, Stella and Stanley, Howard Stern and  his wife, Linda Hamilton & the Terminator #2, even the one with Meg  Ryan as Einstein's (Walter Matthau) daughter ...
Who cares if none of it  ever happened in the real world? I'm sure that the real Albert would have  fallen off his chair from laughing so hard, if he'd been alive to see this  take on his fame and discoveries.",913939200,28,982,4.586206896551724

340241,5,6301589106,"This movie is weird. If you don't like weird movies, stop here. However, if you do like weird, funny movies, I highly recommend Young Einstein. It's got an offbeat mix of science, music, and historical humor, and an excellent soundtrack. Without too many spoilers, this movie involves Einstein, except Einstein is a young apple farmer from Tasmania trying to split the beer atom. Hijinks ensue. I watched this when it first came out and was thrilled to find it again on Amazon - it's held up over time and is just as ridiculous and amusing as ever.",1484956800,,548,4.65979381443299

Shared this with my niece and nephew, not sure they understood it but they humored their aunt by sitting through it.

340297,4,6301589106,"Influenced by the reviewer who said this was a great physics movie, I watched this film again for the first time since I saw it and did not like it back in 1989.  Now, however, I see this film as the other reviewer said as a deeply felt and keen criticism of how governments co-opt physics and other sciences to create WMD's, the pinnacle of which is a Nuclear Bomb.  The plot goes something like this, instead of being a German Jew, Albert Einstein is a bushmen apple farmer on Tasmania (complete with a Tasmania Devil)  who, refusing to dam a valley, is given the task of creating bubbles in beer but his father.  Albert does so with correct physics, and created E=MC2, or Emca, as they say.  And he goes to Australia to get a patent for his discovery.  There he meet young Marie Curie, already a winner of the Nobel Prize.  Fun, physical spouting prostitutes, and many kangaroos later, Young Einstein and Marie save the day.  Full of antipodean in-jokes, this might fall flat for some, as it did initially for me.  But time has a way of changing some opinions, and if I thought Yahoo Serious was ridiculous back in the day, I don't know.  Should the unlikely occur, and I become a Physics teacher, I would definitely show my students this film.",1442534400,,1247,4.477876106194691

There are so many little funny parts in this film, that I'm sure you have to watch it a few times to catch all the little gags and funny signs in the background.

I say so for four reasons:  music, humor, cinimatography, and characters.  I could watch this movie once a week for the next 20 years and laugh every time.

This is a bit goofy I know, but I have a Ph. D. and it's not too goofy for me.  Einstein's look is getting a bit dated, for sure, but the music and scenery and Marie Curie will never, ever go out of style.",1392854400,,533,3.888888888888889

If you're looking for factual science then this isn't it; however, Marie Curie is the true Einstein in the movie.  There is a plot however simple it may be and the music is catchy.

If you didn't care for the movie, i get it, but give the soundtrack a listen, it is one of the best, there has been. I looked in to the bands that do the songs and did't really care for whatever else they had going, seems the best they all had were put here. ""Dumb Things"" and ""I hear a motion"" and ""Great Southern Land"" were the toppers, but it's still too close to call.

Marie secures for him a job at the Australian Patent Office where he discovers how to split the ""beer"" atom and inadvertently endangers the world when his boss steals his invention.  Instead of a revolutionary brewing apparatus, this invention in the wrong hands becomes an atomic bomb of sorts that threatens to detonate at science's equivalent to the Academy Awards (Hosted by Darwin and Marconi) in 1906 Paris.

Along the way young Einstein also invents surfing, the electric guitar, and rock and roll music.  Various references are made to Einstein's Special Theory of Relativity--some of which are actually accurate!

That's a film that connected with my inner child's best memories. I also remember the hype surrounding it. That and the prevues is what got me into the theaters to begin with.( I go to the movies at least 3 times a month.) It was a comedy with outrageously silly characters and plot. I don't like comedies as a rule but I love all good music regardless where it comes from. There are very few exceptions. This is one them.

What stands out in this film the most is the choice of songs and how they are used in the film. Einstein using a guitar to defuse an atomic bomb at an exhibition in Paris and electrocuting himself is a perfect scene. You connect with it or you don't. Yahoo Serious has done another film. It's good. But this film is a lot to try to live up to. What kinds of films does this cool fun achievement belong to? I'd recommend it to anyone that likes The Rocky Horror Picture show. Hedwig and the Angry Inch, Sgt. Pepper's lonely hearts club band, Caddyshack, Stripes, Young Frankenstein or Meatballs - but this one is better for families and doesn't take itself to Seriously.

It really is a labor of love for him, and a love letter to free thinkers like the original Albert Einstein.

The entire disc is barely passable.  The only thing this has over a VHS copy is that is in anamoprhic widescreen, and that it has the original trailer for the movie.

340471,4,6301589106,"I didn't like this film much the first time I saw it back in 1989.  I remember the hype surrounding it, because it was the fourth highest grossing film in Australia at the time...but a hit among Australians didn't automatically transfer to American sensibilities.  It was just a goofy comedy with some outrageous characters and plot, that featured some awesome Australian music.  This is one of those rare films that have grown on me over the years, as I now appreciate its quirky sensibilities and see it as a great tribute to Albert Einstein.  Instead of making a film that's a loyal representation of Einstein's life, the director and star, Yahoo Serious (a pseudonym that unfortunately has the shelf life of a fruit fly) created a unique interpretation of Einstein as an Aussie who discovered the theory of relativity by accident when trying to add bubbles to beer; and then he accidentally creates rock and roll music a year later, in the early part of the 1900s.  Its seriously goofy fun that no one should take literally.  The humour is distinctly Australian, so that might be hard for Americans to appreciate, but for an Aussie-film fan like myself, I love it.

What stands out in this film the most is the choice of songs and how they are used in the film, which is quite exceptional.  My favorite being the Icehouse rock anthem tribute to the land down under, ""Great Southern Land"".  The scene it plays in could very well be a rock video, a la Midnight Oil or something.  Music really carries this film a great distance from a plot that's not quite so well developed as it should be.  Einstein using a guitar to defuse an atomic bomb at an exhibition in Paris, thereby electrocuting himself to cartoonish effect, is the only flaw in this movie for me.  That was just too off the wall absurdity that should remain in the cartoon-land of Wile E Coyote...but its the only flaw in this film for me.  I don't know if Yahoo Serious is still doing films, but this one pratically guaranteed that he would be forever remembered as Young Einstein...the movie-world's equivalent of a one-hit wonder.  With a name like Yahoo Serious...you can't be serious.  The only thing this dvd lacks are some special features that would have been nice (especially any music videos and a director's commentary track)...but I'm glad to see it finally made it on dvd, to replace my well worn VHS copy.",1108598400,21,2384,4.683453237410072

340473,5,6301589106,"Young Einstien was made in 1988 and filmed in Australia.  The actor/creator Yahoo Serious plays a young, slightly airheaded young Albert Einstein, whose family quest has been to do something mankind has never accomplished: put bubbles into beer.  Naturally, this involves splitting atoms.  Albert's father insists he take his new theory, also known as E=mc2, to Sydney and patent it.  In Sydney, Albert meets Marie Curie (Odile le Clezio)and is duped by an ambitious Englishman named Preston Preston (John Howard).  He must find a way to escape from the mad scientists' ward at the nuthouse and stop Preston from building an atomic bomb.  How does he do that?  He invents rock and roll!

I first saw this movie when I was a teen--my parents picked it up at the video store and told me I had to watch it.  Six years later, with a number of science classes under my belt, I'm enjoying it even more.  If you're versed in scientific theory and history, or even if you're not, this film will shine.  The theory itself is all fact, but for the twists, and is depicted in a truly understatedly brilliant manner.  The mutated theories of the greatest scientists in the history of mankind are melded with Yahoo Serious's sense of slapstick comedy for a product that reaches through to all audiences. If you're looking for a smart, laugh-out-loud movie, I'd highly advise you get this a try.",1106870400,17,1381,4.756302521008403
340474,4,6301589106,"I found this to be a delightfully wacky movie.  Albert Einstein as the son of a Tazmanian apple farmer invents the world's first beer with bubbles in it by splitting a beer atom (with a chisel!).  In the process, he develops the E=MC^2 formula about the relationship between matter and energy.  Sent by his dad to register the theory at the patent office, Albert travels to Sydney and meets Marie Curie on the train.  Before it's all over, Albert has invented surfing as well as ""roll and rock"" music, fallen in love with Marie, been locked up in a lunatic asylum (populated with the likes of Ernest Rutherford and Brian ""I was busted for drugs"" Aspirin), escaped by overloading the asylum's systems with an electric guitar, and made his way to Paris to stop an unscrupulous patent office manager--who has stolen his formula--from unwittingly blowing up the city with an atomic bomb (a machine designed to turn out bubbled beer by splitting beer atoms by the millions).

Whew!  It's quite a ride.  It's also, as it turns out, a pretty good introduction to such concepts as relativity and the relationship between mass, space and motion.  And, it has a killer soundtrack of tunes from several Australian bands.  It's not for everybody (I know several people who just can't get into it), but I highly recommend trying it.",1104278400,6,1319,4.775330396475771

  There are six things I want to see on this disc (or on a bonus one): 1)The original Young Einstein shorts that Yahoo made to get funding for the feature film. 2)Commentary from Yahoo himself. 3) A making-of documentary with interviews from the cast. 4) Yahoo's other short films prior to Young Einstein. 5) deleted scenes. 6)trailers and TV spots (including spots for Nickelodeon's Meet Yahoo contest).

  If these things are not present, then why will it even matter it gets DVD release? I could've just dubbed a copy straight to DVD format from my VHS tape if there's nothing extra. I don't demand extras, but considering this is one of my favourite movies ever (and has been for the past 13 yrs.), and considering there is so much material out there Yahoo used to get financing, then it is only logical to put it out there for aspiring filmmakers and the fans (of Yahoo's best film to date).

This film is often considered to be terrible, as are Yahoo's other two movies. I believe that is because people don't understand Mr. Serious' sense of humor. His films are witty and satirical, and his comedy involves a fascinating blend of physical humor and intellectual jokes.
I think this movie is incredibly funny, and if you like it rent or buy Mr. Accident and Reckless Kelly. No, Yahoo's hair doesn't look like that all the time, and no, Einstein didn't invent 4/4 time. But see this film anyway.",997660800,12,639,4.565217391304348
340483,1,6301589106,"Some corny movies I enjoy, but YOUNG EINSTEIN was probably one of the most intelligence-insulting, insipid, and irritating wastes of film ever created. The world's greatest genius trying to split Tasmanian beer atoms? Sure, that WOULD be funny if comedy experts like the Monty Python team got hold of this blatantly dumb movie. If you want to go out and rent what I can't even dignify by calling it a ""film,"" be warned: around an hour and a half of your life will be wasted as you try to understand why the supposedly witty humor and fine acting is totally nonexistent.",978566400,5,569,4.643564356435643
