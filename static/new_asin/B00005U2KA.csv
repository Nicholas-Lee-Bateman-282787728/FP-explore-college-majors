1663226,5,B00005U2KA,Pat's vocals can bring you to those places in your heart where no one has ever been before. Train is one of the most incredible bands of all time.,1182816000,2,146,4.068965517241379
1663227,5,B00005U2KA,"I am a big Train fan, and have attended three of their concerts in the past year alone.  While this concert footage is from a few years back (Drops of Jupiter tour), it certainly captures the feel of being in the front row of a Train concert.  The energy is there, and it sounds great.  I gave a copy of this DVD to a friend of mine for Christmas this year who also enjoys Train's music.  Makes a great gift!",1169424000,3,408,4.0625
1663228,3,B00005U2KA,"I really like Train and enjoyed this live DVD, but had problems with the 5.1 audio.  There were no vocals coming from the center channel which seemed unusual to me.  I'm so used to hearing voices coming from the center channel that it was very distracting to hear the bongos one moment and then another instrument later.  Very strange!  I'm not sure if this is normal for concert 5.1 mixes, but I was very distracted and dissapointed.  Otherwise it was a great show.",1010534400,,466,4.566265060240964
1663229,5,B00005U2KA,"I have a lot of mixed thoughts regarding ""Midnight Moon"". First off, the track selection is excellent. It includes all your favorites including one of the best Zeppelin covers, ""Ramble On"". Go Rob! ""Mississippi"" was very smooth and really exemplifies Pat's crisp vocals. In terms of tightness and precision, I have to say that Drops of Jupiter hit the mark. The band was on from beginning to end on this one. Well, it has been performed hundreds and hundreds of times, so therefore it should sound perfect. It did. About halfway through the gig, I was starting to get worried. Why? I thought maybe the band should've mixed things up a bit. Some of the songs seemed to straight and narrow for my tastes. I know the band has a lot of potential and is capable of incorporating a brand new funk or hip-hop sound with more drum solos or more band member solos into the overall groove. By the time Train played ""Free"" the band was warmed up and in sync 100%. Pat portrayed his percussion talent and let the fans know what Train is really about. Sound: 7.5/10. Sound quality is very tempermental and individualistic in terms of playback. As a listener, one must sit down and make adjustment after adjustment to find the right mix. It takes time. Some of have a good ear for this stuff and of course some of us don't. The 5.1 helped out greatly. I have a decent set-up but its not much. I'm sure if I plug this DVD into a major professional system, it will sound better. I do understand where some of the previous viewers are coming from. The sound is a little sterile at times. Where are those extreme highs? I've watched many music DVDS and VHS recordings and have to say that this is pretty good, but certainly not the best. Check out Sting's ""Brand New Day"" DVD or PF's Pulse or Gabriel's ""POV""(VHS) and you'll see the difference. The visuals: 7/10. CMV is excellent. They produced PF's show in 1994 which in my opinion is the greatest live show ever. I would have prefered additional live backstage coverage and more instrumental shots of band memebers on stage.  The camera captured the front man without a doubt. I gave it five stars because of how far this band has come in six years and the fact that they had the guts to go out and produce a DVD. Alright, I've made my point, so now go out and buy the DVD and see for yourself. An opinion is only an opinion.",1010016000,8,2360,4.43778801843318
1663230,5,B00005U2KA,"Hey. I bought this DVD thinking that it would have ""ok, or poor"" sound quailty.. Well, I watched this DVD on three different TVS with three different sterio systems. They all sounded great. The first sterio system was mildly high tech (it sounded wonderful). The second and third, were just regular TVs... It sounded great... So, I dunno what the other reviewer meant by ""poor sound quality"".... This DVD is a must have. Drops Of Jupiter and Egglplant are personal favorites.",1009843200,4,475,4.8765432098765435
1663231,5,B00005U2KA,"I was glad I made the trip to the Electric Factory in Philadelphia. To see them live, and as the MAIN act was great! I saw them also with matchbox 20, but of course, playing second they only did 5 or 6 songs. Seeing anyone live in a small venue such as the electric factory can't be beat and this DVD put me right back in front of the stage! Great sound and picture! 5.1 dolby digital audio blew me away. If you like anything by train, get this DVD! My only dissapointment is that the song ""RAT"" is not on the disc, however, ""RAMBLE ON"" is, and it's great!",1009756800,,556,4.0636363636363635
1663232,5,B00005U2KA,"I've waited patiently (months) for this release. This DVD was recorded in SF, the ""home of Train"", and they certainly play to the audience, going so far as to introduce Meet Virginia as a ""brand new"" song.  This is a fantastic setlist, and will be considered the ""holy grail"" for Train fans until their next release.  Technical faults aside (picture could be improved), watching this concert on my HDTV is wonderful! All I can say is, I'm ""stuck"" on train.",1008892800,3,456,4.6875
1663233,5,B00005U2KA,"I recently saw train in concert and they are by far the best live band i have ever seen. this DVD doesnt do them justice, but it comes close. the added features are great as is the concert itself. you will not be disappointed with the DVD at all. the camera work is great and the audio is awesome. just buy it and enjoy and great live performance!!!",1008892800,,349,4.147058823529412
1663234,5,B00005U2KA,"Wow! All I can say is WOW! Train is a wonderful live band. If you don't like them, you'll like them after you buy this DVD! It is fantastic. All of their songs sound so much better in a live format. The interviews are classy and everything about this DVD is worth getting!
First of all, I would have to say that the sound quailty is pretty good, it is a shame that it couldn't be better. On the back cover of the DVD, it says that it has ""breakthrough sound quailty"".. But don't get too worried about that...
The songs are great. If you like the songs Meet Virginia, Drops of Jupiter, and Ramble On... Then the DVD is really worth getting. All the songs are very good. I'm very surprised how good they are live!",1008633600,2,711,4.197080291970803
1663235,5,B00005U2KA,"In my search for live Train performances this is all I could find.  It definitely does not disappoint, with a set list containing many fan favorites and some songs that I am discovering for the first time.  I love it and hope that more live performances are available in the future.",1355961600,,282,4.509803921568627
1663236,5,B00005U2KA,I saw them in concert and they were awesome.  I just wanted to relive the experience.  This is a good dvd.,1327190400,,106,4.0
1663237,4,B00005U2KA,"Good concert and nice bonus interviews, which give some background into the band. The interviews are laced with some profanity.",1326326400,,127,5.4
1663238,5,B00005U2KA,"This is a great live show. It doesn't include Train's most recent songs, Soul Sister, for example, but it has all the songs that got me to start listening to Train, Drops of Jupiter, Calling All Angels, It's about you.",1326153600,,218,4.475
1663239,4,B00005U2KA,"I really enjoyed this VHS, it was very entertaining and being able to see Train singing made me a bigger fan of the group if that is possible. I will be viewing it again very soon.",1317772800,,180,4.027777777777778
1663240,5,B00005U2KA,"Gentlemen:  The original five members of Train at their VERY BEST when they were at The Warfield Theatre in San Francisco.  All their great songs!

Sincerely,  Stewart S. Leber",1317513600,,176,4.9655172413793105
1663241,5,B00005U2KA,"I was hesitant to order this video after reading the ratings that most people gave it.  However, being the Train fan that I am and the price of it, I thought, I'm getting it and WOW was it ever worth it and then some!  The audio is incredible and the picture not one bit grainy.  It's just like being at a concert but you get to watch it from the comfort of your home.  I HIGHLY recommend buying this video.",1309737600,2,407,4.05
1663242,5,B00005U2KA,"This DVD arrived as promised, actually they came in a little earlier than promised and they are good quality. Would order again from this site.",1289952000,,143,4.76
1663243,5,B00005U2KA,this is a good video one of my friends got it for me for christmas last year and we looked in the stores for more for our other friends and couldn't find any thank you amazon for being there to find things you don't find anywhere else,1229040000,,234,4.0
1663244,4,B00005U2KA,"I have always liked the Train songs that you here on the radio and I'm a collector of concert DVD's, but now I have become more of a Train fan.  Great concert makes me want to go see them live now, but since they are never in my area this is the next best thing.  Video Quality is above average and sound quality is excellent.",1188259200,2,326,4.0

7954106,3,B00005U2KA,"Rather uninspiring performance, actually. And because I bought this used, my copy is scratched. The one song I really wanted (Ramble On) won't play.",1483920000,,148,5.208333333333333

7954111,3,B00005U2KA,"An excellent concert from an excellent band; however, while this video may be recorded on a DVD it has the appearance of being a VHS tape recording.
The audio was recorded in Dolby Digital 5.1 surround, PCM stereo and sounds wonderful no complaints there at all and I enjoy listening to this concert it is among the very worst of my concert collection as far as picture quality though!",1394150400,,385,4.594202898550725
