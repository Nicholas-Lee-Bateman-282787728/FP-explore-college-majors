8302212,4,6303471684,"Our children have all watched this video from about age 1 to age 3 or 4 and loved it.  Our oldest now takes it with her babysitting as a quick video.  It is only about half an hour long, but there is no violence, no bad guys, only a friendly dragon, a couple of happy children, and some cute songs--a nice break from the Disney videos, Pokemon movies, and other movies generated today that are designed simply to occupy children.  In this video, the children cooperate to help Dudley find his home because he has been asleep for so long and he cannot remmeber where it is.  Along the way, they learn how to identify different environments, how to keep the environment clean, and they help Dudley clean up his home to make it nice again.  Moms and Dads, it is, however, right up there with Barney for adults.",1029110400,,807,4.389261744966443
