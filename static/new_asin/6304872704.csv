7879136,5,6304872704,Fantastic! Evgeny Platov and Oksana Grishuk are the best skaters in history and the best looking! Tara Lipinski vs Michelle Kwan was the most exciting moment in Olympic history. I miss 1998!,1386979200,,190,4.96875

Received as promised by seller in a timely manner.  I would definitely buy from this seller again.",1380499200,,279,4.56
7879138,5,6304872704,Exactly what I was looking for.  Tara Lipinski has the happiest face that I have ever seen on a person!,1356652800,,103,4.15
7879139,3,6304872704,"Well, it's overally good dvd, but as one of the reviewers wrote, you can only pause it during watching. I don't know who made such decision and why - there's  really no point in it. But the good news is - if you have PC, it's very easily to overcome such minor annoyance - just copy all the stuff to your hardrive, and enjoy it to the fullest.
So my final scores are:
TV + standalone DVD: 2 stars
PC + internal DVD: 4 stars",1066348800,3,423,3.976470588235294
7879140,3,6304872704,"I enjoy all Olympic coverage and this was no different.  On the competition tape, the complete programs of Michelle Kwan and Tara Lipinski are a good enough reason alone to buy this set.  But there was a noticeable lack in the Ladies coverage by not showing Chen Lu's gorgeous ""Butterfly Lovers"" - her bronze medal-winning LP - after she overcame enormous odds just to appear in these Olympic Games.  The Ladies coverage was disappointing and very USA-centric - none of the Ladies competitors from outside of the US were even mentioned much less shown.
Also, since the majority of the programs on this tape are edited, the video comes across as rushed and choppy.  What's there has been done well but seeing so many brief, edited clips of programs will leave the dedicated skating fan disappointed and wanting more.
Overall the tape quality is great, very crisp and clear.  And it will definitely bring the excitement of the games back to you!  They've done as well as can be expected when fitting over 20 hours of televised Olympic skating coverage into 80 minutes.
The exhibition tape is much better than the competition tape.  All of the performances shown are uncut and it's extremely fun to watch.  This is definitely the better tape in the set!",980985600,30,1250,4.78139534883721
7879141,5,6304872704,"I recommend this video to anyone. It brings the full beauty of the 1998 Olympic Winter Games in Nagano, Japan. And I agree with Colette! I cant wait for 2002!",955238400,,158,4.3
7879142,4,6304872704,"I thought that this video definetely brought beauty, grace, and drama, to the normal figure skating fan. The only little problem that i had was that in the Ladies' competition, they only focused on Tara Lipinski and Michelle  Kwan. I wish that there were other ladies to watch as well, like some more  on Nicole Bobek, Tanja Scepshenko, Surya Bonaly, Vanessa Gusmeroli... many  more. But the pairs competiton was beautiful: Mandy Woetsel/Ingo Steur had  a program i would never forget, and Kazakova/Dimitriev had a great  performance as well. Besides the little flaw with the ladies competition,  this video will delight any fan of the Figure Skating World. I cant wait  for Salt Lake City in 2002.",953251200,2,698,4.9655172413793105
