3622297,1,B001GZM46Q,"This one star is not because of poor  service from Amazon. We have had to return the video's because they were
the wrong zone.
Our grandchildren were very disappointed as they had been waiting for their arrival.  Your company advised us to
return them to the supplier and this we have done.
We would appreciate the correct DVD's or a cash refund from yourselves.
We are still searching for these DVD's but so far have been unsuccessful.  It is a great pity that they seem to be out of
circulation as we have never heard the grandchildren laugh so much!

3622303,5,B001GZM46Q,"Unfortunately, I had to return my purchase of the Beethoven Series, since they were in NTSC format and I could not access them on my DVD player or recorder. I did however manage to procure a full set here in Australia and have had great pleasure in passing it on to my two youngest grandsons, who love the series. I was quite honestly a bit disappointed in Beethoven 3, which didn't logically follow 1 and 2, but am hoping that when I review 4 and 5, my faith will be restored. Overall, the series is an excellent one for young children, to  about 8 years of age. or maybe a year or so more.

I am also most grateful to Amazon for their prompt reimbursement of my purchase cost.

However, for whatever reason the first 4 movies have been squeezed onto one disc (two each side).  The one I got stopped playing for a couple of minutes each side.

8307523,4,B001GZM46Q,I brought this collection because of the price for 6 movies. I know it gonna be only 3 discs and more than 1 movie in 1 disc. I prefer 1 movie in 1 disc more but of course the price is the most important for family movies. It is cheaper to buy this than the first 6 individual dvd.,1444953600,,281,3.7796610169491527
8307524,2,B001GZM46Q,"#4 did NOT play through. The movies themselves were ok and the price was good IF it played.

I don't have kids in my house to ruin them and we ALWAYS put our movies back in the case. I would NOT buy again.

We purchased  a bunch of multi pack movies so by the time I realized it wouldn't play, was too late to return or even contact the seller. We decided to buy movies that we enjoyed instead of paying for cable. There are still movies I haven't yet watched, hope this doesn't happen again.

In general the movies that have many on 1 disc definitely suffer from inferior quality. But most of them are good enough for an average person or kid.",1444608000,2,644,4.169354838709677
