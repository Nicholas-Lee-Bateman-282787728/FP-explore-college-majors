1313028,2,B00003CXS9,"""The House of Mirth"" is a film (released in 2000) based on the novel of the same name by Edith Wharton (published in 1905). I read the novel shortly before watching the film.

I gave this film a 2-star rating because:
- It is fatally miscast (primary reason)
- It fails to adequately tell the story or reveal the characters
- It combined two characters into one, causing unnecessary confusion

The two main characters of the story (Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz) were dreadfully miscast. Many other reviewers have already commented in-depth on this subject, so I shall not go into details (Google: House of Mirth New York Post).  Anderson was too old for the role, since Edith Wharton described Lily Bart as looking only 24 years old. In the book, Lilys looks and behavior made her an object of irresistible sexual fascination. The movie failed to translate this charm; without this element, it is impossible to tell the story as intended by Wharton.

The film fails to convey the thoughts and feeling of the characters. Perhaps director Terence Davies took ""Show don't tell"" too far: in Mr. Davies version of ""House of Mirth"" the viewer jumps from tableau to tableau, without benefit of Edith Wharton's prose. The film is a collection of pretty scenes: he sets up his cameras in a beautiful location or set, dresses his characters in lovely period-authentic clothing, then has them delivery (dead-pan) dialog with no authentic expression of feeling. Much of Wharton's book reveals the internal thoughts and feelings of the main character, Lily Bart. By completely removing this material, the viewer simply cannot understand the character properly.

Two supporting characters from the book were combined into one character. This created some unnecessary confusion and reduced the impact of their contribution to the story. There is simply no excuse for doing this.",1464652800,,1867,5.048701298701299

1313196,1,B00003CXS9,"I kept on watching this movie thinking something had got to happen eventually...but nothing really ever did.

It had some absolutely fabulous costumes and the backdrop was great, but I just couldn't care.  Gillian Anderson is an actress I really like, but her performance as Lilly in this movie is so ho-hum drab that she kept disappearing into her absolutely fabulous costume.  She looked great, but I just didn't get her and I didn't care enough to try past the first part of the movie.  Even the ""dangers"" she faced at having gone to a man's apartment unsupervised...GASP!...and what it led others to think about her didn't involve me in her character.

I normally also enjoy the work of some of the others in this movie, but they seemed terribly miscast...or maybe the script was just that bad.  After plodding--and I do mean plodding--on through the first quarter of the movie, my attention drifted and I only half-watched the next hour or so.  After that, I honestly gave up and shut off the movie because I didn't even care enough to see it through to the end.

I've seen this author's books turned into movies before, but this one has to the be the worst of the lot.  It was as though they got the surface level of things, but missed out on what makes her work so sharp...this was all rounded edges and doilies.  If you need a movie to fall asleep to, this is a goodie.",1389052800,,1377,4.516129032258065
1313197,5,B00003CXS9,"If you are expecting THE HOUSE OF MIRTH to be joyful, this film based upon Edith Wharton's mournful novel is anything but. This is my favorite of Wharton's novels, and it is a treat to see it brought to life quite admirably in this film. Gillian Anderson is an original and inspired choice for Lily Bart. Most of Wharton's heroines in her novels suffer non-mirthful fates. Wharton seems intent on illustrating the fate of most women of her age who are totally dependent on men and the good opinion of society to thrive. It seems Wharton is attempting to depict how unjust this is and Lily Bart is an excellent example of injustice. In this film, you witness a gradual disintegration of Lily's reputation and circumstances through no fault of her own.

Wharton herself inherited wealth. Her ancestors were the Jones in the expression ""keeping up with the Joneses"". As a best-selling author she also had an income which freed her from the tyranny of dependence on others. Lily, in this film, is at the mercy of others and societal convention. Dan Akroyd plays an unscrupulous rich man who offers investment counsel to Lily, pretending to be gallant. Lily is let down by all of the men in this story, her maiden aunt and society who knows she is virtuous, but won't come to her assistance.

Although the pace is perhaps slow in this movie, it mirrors the slow descent of Lily Bart, a most admirable heroine. It is worth watching for the costumes and sets alone. A beautiful and moving film which will make most women grateful to be living in the 21st century.

* Edith Wharton is as fascinating as any heroine she wrote about. You might enjoy reading her autobiography A Backward Glance [An Autobiography]. 4.5 stars",1381708800,,1713,4.703333333333333
1313198,2,B00003CXS9,"I'm a big fan of Edith Wharton novels and have read them all over the years.  Although the costumes are beautiful, the rest of this movie is just bad.  Gillian Anderson just could not pull it off with a period peace.  She sounds like she's doing a character the whole time.  There's an awkward and stilted quality to sound.  There was not enough music in the background.  As if this was overlooked or accidentally edited out.  I wanted to like this movie but I just couldn't.  It was difficult to make myself sit through the whole show.",1379808000,,536,4.453608247422681
1313199,5,B00003CXS9,This is a great adaptation of Edith Wharton's literary work.  I absolutely loved it and I totally recommend it to anyone.,1379548800,,121,4.761904761904762
1313200,5,B00003CXS9,"I love the sweeping landscapes, the period costumes (especially Gillian Andersons' costumes!!) I love cranky, sickly and condescending An't Julia,(she reminds me of a long, passed away Aunt of my own). With her black clothing, black parasol and dour expressions. Riding in her carriage all straight up and dignified, while she vilifies and chastises her only living relative. I am deeply moved when Grace, An't Julia's ward is devastated by the loss of Lawrence and then again by An't Julia's passing. The audience can really feel her pain, even though this pain was offset by a $400,000.00 inheritance with acreage and a mansion!! I have watched this film a lot and I still wonder why Miss Bart, does  not ever wake up at any time in this film and pull herself together, financially or socially?
She knowingly places herself in the hands of ruthless characters like Gus Trenner (the wonderful and diabolical Dan Akroyd). Who knew he had this character in him, he's just glorious! I realize that Miss Bart, was always on the lookout for the proverbial, best husband suited to her, to her An't's taste, her friend's tastes and to Grace Stepney's tastes..but come on! Why does she continually place herself in the care of others, who have no interests but their own? Lily, continually hands herself up for the slaughter, over and over. Dressed of course, in Doucet, Worth and Pacquin dresses, which sweep luxuriously across the polished floors, while her gigantic hats and feathers sway in the breeze...and then there is Bertha Dorsett..enough said..you gotta watch this film....Bertha D. is an Academy Award nomination all to herself!",1375488000,,1633,5.025830258302583

1313202,1,B00003CXS9,"The House of Mirth is a good example of an ensemble of actors that are miscast and that inhabit separate worlds as they play their disconnected, superficial characters. The movie reminds me of a museum where there are several masterpieces in one exhibit space. Each a great work of art... diluted and unintentionally minimized by the other completely unrelated masterpieces...unrelated except in the minds of the museum curators. Some of these actors have proven themselves and know their craft but there is so much amiss in the chemistry between them and the framework of the piece they couldn't pull it off. It's a shame.",1368316800,,623,5.0
1313203,1,B00003CXS9,"I love period pieces and wondered how I had missed this one when it was produced 12 years ago.  Now I know.  I doubt that the film enjoyed much success at the box office.  The plot is predicably mindless - Victorian era woman intent on living up to societal standards of the day ends up miserable and penniless.  The cast is made up of actors who fared better on television and probably should have remained there, as their stilted dialogue in this filme is totally unconvincing.  This is a movie one can walk away from several times during the running, as I did, and come back to find you have missed nothing.",1365292800,,610,4.410714285714286
1313308,3,B00003CXS9,"W-e-l-l, it's a mixed bag. It's slow. The acting feels stilted most of the time. The story is choppy, and there is a whole lot going on inside the actors' heads that is clearly not being presented on screen... BUT... there is an honesty about this movie that makes me want to watch it again. (I've actually seen it twice now).

The movie starts out in high society. The women's fashions and home decor are incredibly eye catching. It's easy to understand that Lily wants this life for herself. It's also easy to see that she's torn between this image and security and what her heart wants. Then there is the fight between virtue and survival. She has the means to climb back into society, but using it goes against her heart and Lawrence's vision of her. There is also this battle between reality and fakery. Lily seems to want reality. She is different when she is with Lawrence and towards the end of the movie with Rosedale too. She doesn't pretend that she's not broke or desperate ever, but pretending, back-stabbing, lying, and looking the other way is what society does. Yet Lily can't commit to being completely in the social circle or outside of it.

There is a lot going on that is sure to tug at you in some way if you give it a chance. It is one of the most real movies I've seen, but you do have to be patient with it and let is simmer a while.",1360454400,,1357,4.338582677165355

1313310,2,B00003CXS9,"I did not like this movie. I tried but I found it devoid of feeling. One does feel for Lily, she is a tragic figure. She does not represent a person, but an ideal - an uncompromising figure sacrificed by lesser souls.

Eric Stolz is a disappointment as her ""lover"". Indeed, no chemistry evolved between him and Gillian Anderson, whom I personally found stunning. He is, as another review says, too immature for the role, he has the voice of a teenager, is glib, heartless and insincere.

The film is somehow gut wrenching, but not in a cathartic way. You do not feel good when it is over, or cleansed, just empty. And sad, very sad because it was all so meaningless.",1355097600,,666,4.450819672131147
1313311,5,B00003CXS9,Great version of the novel -- the novel was written by Edith Wharton.  Recommend reading the book too if you haven't read it.  Stays pretty close to the novel.,1355011200,,159,4.448275862068965
1313312,5,B00003CXS9,"The House of Mirth is a perfect tragedy based on Edith Wharton's first major novel published in 1905.  This is one of those rare situations where both the book and the film are so brilliant that neither will ruin the other-- read, watch/watch, read-- it makes no difference.  The story is deeply agitating; it is set in Old New York and follows Lily Bart as she falls, lower and lower, down the social strata from her high perch in upper class society.

Lily's soul torturing struggle was one of the highlights.  She had all the tools necessary to regain her social status, but instead of losing her self-dignity by using off hand means, she chose the higher road which meant misery.  The title was taken from Ecclesiastes 7:4: ""the heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.""

Everything about the film was beautiful, set design, costumes and especially the theme song: Alessandro Marcello's ""Oboe Concerto in D Minor.""",1338336000,,973,4.6608187134502925
1313313,3,B00003CXS9,"I have just finished reading the book (See my review at [...] ), and I can confidently report that this movie is quite faithful to the book. Indeed, the dialog seems to be pretty direct quotes for the most part. Of course, like any movie adaptation, the story needs to be simplified. Indeed, one significant character, the kind-hearted Gerty, is gone altogether, and with her a significant sub-plot. But what remains is deftly stitched together so that the cuts don't show.

Gillian Anderson plays Lily Bart, the main character. It's a tough role for a variety of reasons, and I can think of others who might look the part more effectively. But for the icy composure that characterized Lily for most of her life, Anderson plays it very well.

Eric Stoltz plays Lawrence Seldon, the one true friend in Lily's life, who goes under-appreciated for much of the story. Strangely, Dan Aykroyd plays Gus Trenor, and seems a bit miscast. He's wooden where he's supposed to be smooth, and only seems to come into the role when he gets crude. Very crude.

You can get the basic story from my book review, it's that accurate. But having faces to help keep the names straight helps a lot. Laura Linney, who is quite beautiful, makes more sense as Bertha Dorset than anything I had imagined. One of the reasons this works as a movie perhaps even more than as a book is that there are a lot of female characters who are primarily seen in their relation to Lily, and keeping friend separated from foe doesn't work very well when the relations keep changing. That's what poor, honest Gerty was for: the one person you could count on to be Lily's friend. In exchange, the movie gives us Elizabeth McGovern as Carry Fisher. I saw her several times before I realized who she was, but when I did connect her to her name, the role she played here was simplified compared to her role in the book.

All in all, once you get past the rather stilted way people talk, especially in the ""society"" settings, it's a pretty engaging movie. Depressing in many ways, but sufficiently complex to keep its audience involved.",1336608000,,2090,4.62533692722372
1313314,1,B00003CXS9,"This a favorite book of mine--I've read it twice--and I eagerly awaited the film version.  What a disappointment.

Biggest problem for me was poor casting, starting with the lead role.  Gillian Anderson proves here why she's only been successful on a sci-fi television show.  Dan Ackroyd and Anthony LaPaglia are both good actors, but both seemed out of place here.  Only Laura Linney shined; the film would have been far better if she had played Lillie Bart.  (And speaking of out of place, using old, ivy covered Scottish houses for old New York brownstones looked ridiculous.)

Save your money and read, or re-read, Wharton's novel.",1322179200,,635,4.9904761904761905
1313315,3,B00003CXS9,"Well, here's another indi film I waited a long time to see.  Was it worth the wait?  Nope.  As a sucker for period dramas like this, especially all that British royalty, this American period piece left me tepid if not cold.  To begin with, I can usually stay up with bygone speech and mores, but this film left me flummoxed more than once.  After a point was delivered, I wasn't quite sure what was said, or what the point was.  It left my head hurting.  Set in New York in 1905, the film does give an excellent portrayal of class distinctions of the time.  Women were expected to marry and if you had ""standing"" you married up.  Unfortunately love took a back seat.  A flirtation, real or perceived could have draconian consequences for a single woman.  The film is too long at 140 minutes and although it had some fine actors including Gillian Anderson, Eric Stoltz and Anthony LaPaglia in the key roles, they seemed a bit off.  Miscast I think.",1320883200,,947,4.473684210526316
1313316,3,B00003CXS9,"Terence Davies, the writer/director of this eye-catching but uneven adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel, is to be commended for  presenting this work in such a visually beautiful way. In scene after scene, we are shown what looks like a series of John Singer Sargent paintings come to life.  The play of soft light and deep shadow over Edwardian-era fashions is a pleasure to behold. Aurally, too, there is enjoyment to be had from the choice of classical composers (from Mozart to Borodin) to underscore several of the scenes.  It's too bad that the same high standards of quality are not to be found in every element of this film, which dates from 2000.

The dialogue is sometimes witty and biting, but frequently sounds stilted, perhaps too often lifted from the pages of the 1905 novel, where Wharton's conversational exchanges are rather easier to accept on the page than they would be spoken aloud. There's a way to make ""period pieces"" sound natural in film (several of the Jane Austen adaptations have succeeded in this respect), but it requires a more skillful adapter than Davies appears to be, judging by this film.

As a writer he chose to eliminate certain plot points and even several characters (where is Gertie Farish, for instance, a major figure in the novel?) no doubt in order to make a film of a commercially acceptable length. True, the novel has over 50 characters of varying importance and runs to several hundred pages, but in the process of ""telescoping"" the story, a certain confusion is inevitable for viewers who are not familiar with the novel itself. As Davies explains, off camera, in one of the ""bonus"" features on the DVD, he was persuaded to eliminate certain scenes in the film which introduced and developed some of the characters, and/or deepened the viewers' understanding of their motivations and importance to the story.  As a result, those who have not read the novel will likely be perplexed by the sudden appearance and equally sudden disappearance of certain figures who sometimes play an important part in the evolution of the plot.

An impeccable cast could have made up for the deficiencies in the writing. Unfortunately, the quality of the acting varies considerably.  The key role of the heroine, Lily Bart, is played by Gillian Anderson, who has the ravishing beauty and the sensitive facial features required for this complex character, a brilliant but perverse beauty who sabotages her own chances for worldly success. But there's a certain ""studied"" quality about Anderson's line readings that makes it all too obvious that we are watching an actress at work; we can seldom forget that fact and imagine we are watching Lily Bart herself.  Eric Stoltz plays the part of Lily's friend and her moral ""conscience,"" Lawrence Seldon, and he is rarely more than an appealing physical presence, one who registers as too immature for the role.  There's none of the implied depth and emotional ambivalence that Wharton endowed this character with in her book. Of the other actors, the most effective are Laura Linney as a duplicitous socialite who precipitates Lily's social downfall, and Eleanor Bron (whom I recall from the Beatle's film Help!, in 1965) as Lily's imperious and puritanical aunt. They set the standard for what the casting quality might have been, but was not. And how I wish that whoever hired Dan Ackroyd and Anthony Lapaglia (was it Davies?) to play their respective roles had thought better of it before the film went into production. At least, however, those two performances were in some way memorable, though misguided. Many of the other actors' contributions produced instant amnesia soon after the closing credits. They weren't so much bad as they were simply bland.

All in all, this a film with certain virtues and a good many defects.  Whether it will appeal to many people in years to come is very much an open question.  I hope that, at the very least, it motivates people to read or reread Wharton's novel, which is an enduring classic.

Why would anyone write a story like this or produce such a film?

We enjoyed Gillian Anderson in ""The X-files.""  In fact, we kept wondering if Lt. Mulder was going to suddenly appear and rescue Scully from this dire film.  ""House of Mirth?""  There was no mirth of any sort.  Just one negative scene and situation after another.

Gillian Anderson also appeared in a recent production of Charles Dickens' ""Bleak House,""  a dark and brooding tale, even by Dickens' standards.  Believe it or not, ""House of Mirth"" is even bleaker than ""Bleak House.""

Other reviewers liked the costumes and various production features.  But what good are they when there is virtually no story and the characters are all unpleasant, unsympathetic people?

These `period romance' films can be a dime and dozen and the fault that can be found with most is the familiarity of them all.  It is almost like all films in this genre have studied at the `School for Jane Austen Copycats' and have delivered standup interpretations of her films (which have a tendency of running together themselves).  Thankfully, the cast and delicious costume work and production design of `The House of Mirth' elevate it to a more memorable and thus more original stature.  Gillian Anderson is astonishingly good here (truly remarkable performance that visibly shifts as her emotional state crumbles beneath her) as are supporting players like Laura Linney, Jodhi May and Anthony LaPaglia.  The film isn't without its flaws (one of which is Eric Stoltz ghastly performance), but the flaws are forgivable thanks to the sheer engrossing nature of the film itself.  You can't take your eyes off of it.  The predictable gossip that infests these films (isn't it always the way with `period dramas') is deliciously presented, but what I loved most was the way that Lily's character is developed and the way she completely contrasts her own stereotype, which only helps in delivering such a richly rewarding conclusion (despite it apparent devastation); appropriate yet far from initially expected.",1296604800,,1441,5.00418410041841

1313388,4,B00003CXS9,"As an English Major, I read this book for ""Women's Writing."" If you feel like depressing yourself, well, this movie will certainly deliver.

This movie is basically the story of a 30 year old unmarried woman named Lily Bart. One may argue that she is heroic in defying the laws of 'get married if you want to be happy.' But in doing so she causes her own tragic downfall.

She basically got herself into financial trouble by playing cards and losing a lot of money. So even at the start, we have to admit she did a lot of the damage to herself. (Hence if she is to come out of this and survive, she has to either get married to a rich man, or hope that a rich relative dies and leaves her a new fortune.)

To make matters worse, Lily accepts help (that isn't exactly free) from Gus Trenor. And in this process, she finds herself owing him $9,000. A lot of money now to be sure. But A LOT more when the story takes place!

To make matters worse, Lily fins herself the subject of evil gossip which is ruining her reputation.

Now to be sure, society inflicts a lot of cruelty on Lily. BUT, she does do some of this to herself. She loves the lawyer Seldon, but is too ashamed to admit he could make her happy. The VERY rich man 'Anthony Lapaglia' may seem uptight and into himself. BUT, he is willing to help Lily out of this mess. First, Lily turns him down because she doesn't quite think he's good enough. Then when she goes back to him, his mind has rather changed because of the evil gossip surrounding her.

HOWEVER, he makes her an offer that he will marry her if she quiets Bertha. (Bertha was the chief in spreading evil gossip about Lily.) Anthony Lapaglia is an interesting opposite of Lily. He knows the 'rules' of society. He knows the dirty plays, and how to avoid them. He also knows how to 'play dirty' if he has to.

Lily doesn't play by the rules of society. Nor does she know how to play dirty even to preserve herself. Lily is not destroyed quite 100 % by others. She does some of it to herself.

From here, things just keep going downhill. Because Lily had been playing cards and gotten herself into a scandal with Gus Trenor, her RICH aunt DRASTICALLY reduces Lily's inheritence. Lily's tiny $10,000. inheritance is almost all taken by her $9,000. debt to Gus Trenor. She loses her life and desperately tries to make a living in a hatshop, but she is incapable of doing the work. (She is too old and ill now to learn a trade.)

To make things worse, Lily's cousin who got EVERYTHING refuses to help Lily.

But interestingly, Lily DOES have one final chance. Lapaglia takes great pity on her and wants to help her anyway he can. Even to the point of paying Lily's debt until she can get back on her feet. He is even still willing to marry her if she quiets the nasty Bertha. It seems that Lily is stubborn about not only obeying rules, but accepting help.

Now to be sure, Lily brings up how 'borrowing' from Gus Trenor ruined her. But let's step out of feminism here. Yes. The situation with Gus Trenor helped ruin her reputation in society and with her rich aunt. But at this point, Lily has nothing left to ruin. She has no rich relative to hope for help from; and society has done its worst; in short, Lily has nothing left to protect.

In a final desperate effort to save herself, Lily is willing to play 'dirty chess' with Bertha, but Bertha has disappeared, and Lily decides she is a useless person and loses all hope.

This movie certainly is commenting on how a woman is helpless in that culture if she becomes the subject of bad gossip and is unwilling to marry, or just can't. However, we can't deny that Lily refused help when it was offered. Whatever Lapaglia's faults were, he was honest. And he was essentially the last person who showed pity on her and was willing to help her.

Seldon may be a commentary on politics. He seems like a kind good natured man who is willing to help. But he never quite delivers. And when Lily presents her final tears to him, he can't see the seriousness of the situation. Now to be sure, when he discovers the seriousness of the situation he runs desperately to help her, but it is now too late. (Not a bad person, but kind of a typical politician.)

As I said, this is a good movie, but it is really depressing. If you like this movie, you may also wish to check out ""Ethan Frome"" with Liam Neeson.",1284681600,,4365,4.325581395348837
1313389,5,B00003CXS9,"The film is represents the characters and concepts of the book fairly well. The protagonist, Lily, seems unable to make rational decisions, though she is reasonably intelligent. She's hampered by the conventions of her time as well as the shallow ideas inculcated by her mother. She's generally valued for her beauty and uses that as currency for entre into the level of society she's been taught to value. Unfortunately, at the point of success (marriage to a wealthy man), she undermines herself by doing something stupid. She never quite understands her own motives and learns introspection and self-realization too late.",1252713600,,624,5.25
1313390,3,B00003CXS9,"Edith Wharton's story of a socialite's downfall is a finely nuanced tale of societal expectations, the perils of beauty, and the soul-deadening roles assigned to women.

Some of this nuance is lost in this movie adaptation. I didn't get from the script that Lily Bart is not as wealthy as the crowd she runs with, so is a sort of professional houseguest, with unspoken duties that eventually contribute to her downfall. The way her debts are presented in the movie (and debts are the hinge of the story), it seems to be her own fault that she has gambled away money in card games, rather than the result of a system that expects her to participate in the entertainments of the social class to which she aspires, despite her inability to keep up financially. Not understanding this unenviable position, viewers don't have as much sympathy for Lily as they could as the tale spins itself out onscreen.

Even so, the viewer still can sympathize greatly with Lily. Who can blame her for turning down any of the men who might have been her financial salvation through marriage? They're all icky, even her great love Lawrence after a while. It was a sick system that forced women into marriages that demolished their inner lives and sense of self, and punished them for not complying.

This is a beautiful movie to watch. Who doesn't like the opulence of this period and social class? But I found some -- perhaps most -- of the roles overplayed, and therefore a bit laughable (especially Dan Ackroyd!). But the title role, played by Gillian Anderson, will keep you going to the end.

1313481,5,B00003CXS9,"When you read the reviews of this film, reviewers who have read the book tend to rate the film lower and indicate that film does not measure up to the novel. However, I think it is only fair to review the film as a stand alone artistic production independent of the source novel, and under this condition the film is superb and highly disturbing. I found myself thinking about the film all the next day after I saw it, for it is dark social commentary on the human condition.

Gillian Anderson plays Lily Bart, a cool socialite, seeking a rich husband among the New York City social upper class. The film follows Lily as she makes one mistake after another in judgment, all with consequences that begin to undermine her social position. Her vulnerability is based on her ambivalence and inaction when action is required. Lily had upper class parents who lost their fortune when she was 19. Now she lives with her Aunt Julia Peniston, and her cousin, Grace Julia Stepney.

The most obvious ambiguity in her life is her love for the handsome lawyer, Lawrence Selden, who does not have the size fortune needed to attract and maintain Lily. She loves him and yet her vocation is to seek a wealthy husband, and Lawrence recognizes that this is her vocation, the goal toward which everyone in her family and social network directs her, and thus he does not push his affections upon her. They become a tragic pair of star-crossed lovers. Eric Stoltz does a great job playing Selden, a cool sophisticated socially accepted handsome man. Under normal circumstance he would be an excellent choice for a husband. However Lily has been bred to go after the highest prize, the wealthiest men in New York City.

Lily has a small inheritance of $9,000 of which she has lost $8,000 in gambling debt which she must repay.  She is friends with Gus and Judy Trenor and Judy is attempting to fix Lily up with New York's most wealthy men. But Lily loves Lawrence and she undermines each and every attempt to connect her to a rich husband and secure future. She confides to Gus Trenor that she is in debt and he offers to manage her inheritance. Lily sees Judy and Gus as her great friends and attends the opera with Gus when Judy is in the countryside. Gillian Anderson looks outstanding dressed in red for the Mozart opera but her conspicuous beauty in combination with her married escort begins to stimulate gossip and tales that reach the ears of her prudish rich aunt. Funds come in which Lily disburses, not realizing that these funds are not her dividends but the funds of Gus Trenor who finally reveals he wishes her to become his lover so as to repay the funds he has given her. She refuses Gus but the damage to her reputation has been done.

This incident is minor stuff compared to the incredible double-cross that she endures from Bertha Dorset, who sets up Lily to cover her own marital indiscretion. Lily's cousin Grace uses every opportunity to influence the elderly Aunt Julia and when Julia dies the vast fortune goes to Grace with only enough funds going to Lily to pay her debts.

Lily has the evidence to shame Bertha Dorset and give her husband George Dorset the grounds for a divorce but she does not use the tools she has been given. When the wealthy Jewish businessman Sim Rosedale offers her a strategy by which she can regain her status, she refuses to act, probably because Bertha has had an affair with Lawrence Selden and thus to act would also hurt Lawrence. When rich Aunt Julia dies, she leaves Lily $10,000, enough to cover her debts but no more. Lily never understood or appreciated her aunt's value system and what games would be required to inherit the vast fortune of $400,000 that is left to cousin Grace. Remember that $400,000 in 1907 is equal to about 400 million in 2008 dollars.

The film tracks Lily's sad fall down the social ladder and the poor self destructive decisions that Lily has made come to bring about her downfall. It is an irony that she never really commits any of the indiscretions for which she is accused. Beautiful rich women in her class had to balance their vocation of acquiring wealth with their passion for men other than their husbands. Lily was not cut out for this strategy that Bertha Dorset has mastered so well. Laura Linney is excellent as the relentless Bertha who would sacrifice Lily to cover her own indiscretion.

The end is sad and crushing. Lily has learned that life is difficult and that she is useless person if she no longer resides in the upper crust of wealthy society. She comes to see that she was just a cog in a giant social machine and when she dropped out of the machine, she was of little use to anyone.",1225756800,,4676,4.5849282296650715
1313482,4,B00003CXS9,"HOUSE OF MIRTH (2000) is a period piece based on the Edith Wharton novel that portrays the early 20th century social caste of New York's elite. Gillian Anderson brings depth to Lily Bart's character as she navigates the protocols and expectations of society that are steeped within her own personal vices. Eric Stolz, Laura Linney, Dan Aykroyd, Anthony LaPaglia, and Elizabeth McGovern also display fine performances, portraying characters that provide a cohesive backdrop for Lily Bart. Caught between gambling debts and naivete, Bart (Anderson) finds herself in a maelstrom of life-altering events, which preclude her from being with the man she truly loves.",1208995200,,660,5.41747572815534
1313483,5,B00003CXS9,"The melancholic tale of rapacious Lily Bart, that was so meticulously and brilliantly written by Edith Wharton, deserves to be depicted onscreen with the same fluidity, subtleties and emotive presence as the novel, and I'm not exaggerating when I say that director Terence Davies truly accomplished this. Having read the novel a couple of weeks before, I was so anxious to see the movie adaptation that could do it justice and in my opinion, it sure did.

What Davies concocted in this small-budgeted movie that somehow looks extravangant and lush is the dreamlike atmosphere, with shades of ethereal lighting, that poses a stark contrast to the realism and a sense of brutality in the movie. It seems realistic in a way, as people have mentioned, by the lack of background music that may all but decimate the essence of the words said by the characters. The stillness of a scene without music whatsoever, pulls the audience in and makes the conversations more private and true.

I'm actually very happy that Davies had decided to retain the 'stilted', formal dialogue that Edith wrote, which makes the similarities between the novel and the movie more tangible. Most of the actors seem to be at ease with the dialogue, and I can only sing songs of adulation to Gillian Anderson. I'm not very familiar with her and the supporting cast's work, and the faintest memory of Gillian in X-Files that I have is when I was barely in elementary school.

Gillian is absolutely resplendent as Lily Bart, and the fact that her translucent azure eyes emoting a paroxysm of different emotions within seconds astound me. Her downward spiral towards penury is executed wonderfully; her trembled voice and breaths and her fatigued expression just express pure debility. She does an absolutely  brilliant performance that deserves a universal recognition.

As Lawrence Selden, the handsome Eric Stoltz portrays him with such sophisticated charm, at times boyishly, and flirtatious air that it's no wonder that Lily, Grace Stepney and Bertha Dorset are vying for him. In the second part of the movie, Stoltz proves to be a remarkably effective actor in doing dramatic scenes, especially his final scene where he strips off Lawrence's righteous facade and pours his heart out that all but shows the vulnerability and despondency of a crestfallen man. Only stone-hearted people are not affected by this particularly sad scene.

I also have to mention that Gillian and Stoltz elicit amazing sparks and chemistry from each other, which makes their attraction very credible and justified. They react off each other perfectly just with clandestine glances, smiles and even behind cigarette smokes. Their intimate scenes are titilating and private, under Davies' claustrophobic frame, that makes me feel as if their rendezvous is not meant to be seen by the audience.

Other standout performances for me are Anthony LaPaglia as Sim Rosedale and Laura Linney as the vulturous Bertha Dorset, whose malicious intentions lie behind her placid smiles.

The only complaint I have about this movie is that some scenes can only be understood by the rarefied few, albeit those who have read the novel. One scene in particular is the entertainment at the Brys where they held a tableux vivants and Lily was Watteau's Summer. It seems to come out of nowhere in the movie without explanation whatsoever. Such problems occur, unfortunately, because of the meagre amount of budget.

Nonetheless, The House of Mirth is an extraordinary adaptation and it lingers on with me long after I finished watching it that I had to watch it again on the same day. And both times, I couldn't help but cry and feel extremely moved by the movie. This is the movie to see if you enjoy the aesthetics of great cinema and leisurely-paced movie that is deep and wreathing with emotional turmoil.",1203552000,,3836,5.018867924528302
1313484,2,B00003CXS9,"I loved the book, and didn't mind the rewriting of the storyline. But this was just a badly made film. The acting was terrible, for one. As much as I like Gillian Anderson, I felt she was out of her depth for the role. Everyone else (with the exception of Laura Linney) seemed to be ""faking"" it. The worst part was the transitions between scenes, which were too long, and usually without dialogue or music. I'm not looking for an action-packed film, but the transitions really added nothing to the flow or emotion of the film. There were some good moments, and the costumes were beautiful, but otherwise, I'm waiting for someone else to make a film adaptation of Edith Wharton's wonderful book.",1203120000,,694,4.650406504065041
1313485,2,B00003CXS9,"I just finished the dvd after having read the book a few weeks ago, and I'm sorry to say that my high hopes were disappointed.  You would think that a novel worth adapting to film would be worth adapting with some sense of fidelity to the original...unless you have learned better by now.  (I have not.)

My first frustration with this version was when I realized that the script had collapsed, into one very incoherent character, the heroine's greatest (blindest, even!) defender *and* one of her greatest detractors.  Was this a misguided attempt to economize?  In the novel, Gerty Farish is a crucial foil not only for Lily Bart's beauty but also for her taste for luxury, her selfishness, and her charm--perhaps someone decided that, with her unrequited longing for Selden and her bad complexion, Gerty would drag down the film's aesthetic standards.  In the novel, however, this is essential: she is shabby, yes, she is exhaustively principled and self-effacing, but she also shows us that the extreme poverty that leads to such squalid ruin in the heroine *can* be compatible with some kind of respectable and useful existence.  This all sounds like a load of moralizing, but what works about the novel is that it doesn't try to privilege this good-doing over what is undeniably more interesting; you could say that it is Gerty who manages to survive the course of the plot, but you would also have to admit that the life of Gerty Farish would never merit any kind of novelistic treatment.  I have harped on this for too long, but to half-eliminate and half-combine what is probably the fourth- or fifth-most important character in the book with, of all people, Grace Stepney, is, to say the least, problematic.

My other main gripe with this adaptation was that I missed a sense of Lily Bart's tragic habit of doing the wrong thing, against her better conscience, until it was just too late.  This was what sustained, through the better part of the book, a sense of ineluctable doom.  If a pervasive sense of ineluctable doom doesn't sound like a good idea for a movie, then someone ought to rethink making movies out of stories that [spoiler, if you are still with me] end in suicide, even if the suicide is staged with a bottle of red liquid dripping artistically from the heroine's loosening fingers.

If you're looking for Edith Wharton, needless to say, you'll do better to read the book.  If you're trying to save yourself the trouble of reading Edith Wharton for a class--shame on you!--you'll probably get more out of wikipedia than from this movie.",1191369600,,2564,4.8
1313486,4,B00003CXS9,"House of Mirth was actually number one on my Christmas list of must-read books last year. I'd heard so much about the movie, I forced myself to abstain from watching it until I finished this sure-to-be intensely satisfying book. I'm sure it's because I'm not used to Edith Wharton's writing style, but I think she may've been alergic to action. There's plenty of self-examination from our heroine, Lily Bart, and her seemingly endless commentary on society and her place in it. Thankfully, we're spared much of that in the film. The film brings up many interesting points that I'm sure the book discussed, had I cared at the time. Is Lily Bart a martyr for accomplished, well-to-do ladies of her circle? Does she surrender too soon? Does her weakness say more about her or society? It really is rather a disturbing look at societal politics and how quickly the upper echelons of society could eliminate or alienate rivals by rumor, slander or even the hint of impropriety. As much as I initially loathed Lily Bart and her ineptitude, I really should sympathize because she's not a survivalist in the skilled, strong work-ethic sort of way. She wasn't bred for that. We get early on that even she knows she's doomed to failure. She's given several opportunities to get back in the game, but shuns them out of pride or loyalty to her friends. Gillian Anderson is exceptional in the film because she understands Lily Bart is an uncomplicated woman. She wants to be a part of high society but won't step on anyone to get there or take the easy way out. She knows Lily's imperfections but she'd explain that they're necessary if she's to fight for her place in the world. That's all she knows. I do love the entire cast in this film, especially Dan Aykroyd as Gus Trenor. Some people dislike the casting of Aykroyd and I too think his presence is rather jarring. I'm waiting for him to whip out his proton pack. But his odd, slimy salesman presense was a brilliant choice as we instinctively don't want him anywhere near Lily. I'm rather partial to this film for restoring the bitter disappointment I felt for the book. I really find it more interesting to watch Lily's star gradually diminish without needing a constant commentary from the heroine. We only need to see how she reacts. She isn't able to share her inmost feelings and I think her silent, self-struggle, is what makes the audience wish they could help her or be her confidant.",1186185600,,2436,4.69392523364486

1313592,4,B00003CXS9,"This is an adaptation of the 1905 novel by Edith Wharton.  The title is from Ecclesiastes 7:4: ""The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning; but the heart of fools is in the house of mirth.""  The story follows young socialite Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson of The X-Files) as she simultaneously attempts to find a husband and sabotages the attempts with gambling debts and, in her naivet, even more troublesome financial obligations to a wealthy married man aptly played by Dan Aykroyd.  Lily appears trapped by her love of money and the strict social conventions of the time.  She tries to do the right thing but her efforts fail.  She is ultimately a tragic figure.  She states towards the end, ""I have tried hard, but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person.""

For a story to work you must care about the characters.  The reason I give this movie only four stars is that while I cared for the Lily of the novel I could not muster the same feelings for the selfish and often stupid Lily of the movie.

Edith Wharton was born in 1862 to a wealthy New York family.  She knew the wealthy and powerful of the age.  She was a part of upper class American society but also a harsh critic of it.  Her novels illustrate the provincialism, elitism, ignorance and bigotry of the period.  Wharton won the Pulitzer Prize for Literature for her novel The Age of Innocence, in 1921.  She was the first woman to win the award.

Recommendation:  If you enjoy period movies this is one worth watching but be warned it was written as social commentary, not as a romance.

Lily was a little arrogant, refusing one wealthy suitor after another, while pining for a lawyer who has nothing and wouldn't marry her anyway, because he knew he couldn't provide her with the kind of lifestyle to which she was accustomed. She resides with a wealthy aunt and cousin, having little money of her own.  She acquires gambling debts playing bridge, though we never see when this happens.  The cousin tells the aunt about the gambling debts, and the old lady more or less disowns Lily.  When the aunt dies, she leaves everything to the cousin, who tells Lily that it was HER fault her aunt died and it was because her gambling debts caused the aunt to worry herself sick.

1313596,4,B00003CXS9,"The House of Mirth is my favorite Edith Wharton novel.  The way she illustrated the hypocrisy and heartlessness of high society was gripping and moved me to the core.  I had wondered how the film industry would be able to adapt the novel with the same eloquence and style.  Well, this film adaptation, though tiresome in some areas, is wonderful and powerful and the actors are incredible.  Gillian Anderson does quite an amazing job portraying Lily Bart, the young New York socialite who falls from grace when she is shunned by the people she had once thought of as friends when it is discovered that she is in debt.  We see how she is courted by endless admirers but her heart belongs to the working class, metrosexual Laurence Selden (Eric Stoltz).  We also see how Lily is betrayed by a ruthless social peer (Laura Tinney) and is ill-advised by a sneaky financial advisor (Dan Akroyd).  The tragic ending touched me very much.  Anderson and Stoltz brought this last scene to life in more ways than one.  They brought me to tears!  I have always been a sucker for tragic endings, and Edith Wharton was quite good at writing them, and the film captures the cruelty and superficiality of the upper class and the loneliness Lily Bart experiences when she realizes that very few of the people in her life are actually her friends.  The film's visual is the most mesmerizing of all.  The Edwardian era is brought to life with the gorgeous wardrobe and beautiful scenery (filmed in Scotland).  All in all, The House of Mirth is a must-watch for all Edith Wharton fans.  I agree with the reviewers who say that the film gets kind of boring at times (especially in the beginning) and that it lags in some areas, but the creators of this film had wanted to capture Wharton's tone without adding the Hollywood-esque gratuitious melodrama and cliches.  This is the second adaptation of a Edith Wharton novel I have seen (the other one is BBC's The Buccaneers, which I love and have watched several times) and I'm quite pleased with the quality of this film.  I hope the adaptation of The Age of Innocence is as good as this one.",1161820800,,2120,4.628342245989304
1313597,3,B00003CXS9,"I had to watch this a few times before I really liked it.  What got me to watch it more than once in the first place was the georgeous look of it.  Costumes, sets, and locations are stunning.  Even though I was a bit bored with it at first, I felt like there was something worth exploring again.  I watched it again last night and the brutality of it finally clicked.  Every cruel insult is always said with a smile, and spoken in the most pleasant and proper way. Awful things are happening but no one acknowledges them.

  That's why I think I didn't get it at first -- it is low key, calm, and with little excitement, but that is how the world of upperclass society is portrayed.  Politeness and propriety overrule emotions and compassion.  In a way fear overrules it all.  Fear of ostracism and inconvenient associations keep people from doing the right things and standing by their friends.  Lily Bart does the right things, follows her emotions, and gives in to her vices.  In the end she loses everything for it.

  I am giving it three stars because I still don't like how it moves along, with short and choppy scenes, and no background music, making it feel very stark and dull.  Dan Akroyd is a joke -- he seems like a kid trying to act like a grown-up.  I don't know what the casting director was going for with that choice.

  Other than that, the acting is very stiff and often times it feels like the cast is simply reading their lines off of the page.  I understand why they are doing it now, it's all part of the desensitized image they are portraying. Yet to a movie with very little energy to begin with, this acting style doesn't help even if it is relevant to the story.

  In summary, if you are patient, there is a pot of gold at the end of the rainbow.  If you do not want to invest the time, look for other options.  One suggestion is another Edith Warton adaptation, ""The Buccaneers""  that will keep you hooked like a soap opera, and offer some quicker gratification.",1154390400,,1992,4.368852459016393
1313598,2,B00003CXS9,"""House of Mirth"" is one of the most depressing movies I've ever seen.

To be clear: I've seen movies like, oh, say, ""Schindler's List,"" or ""The Heart is a Lonely Hunter"" that treat tragic events, either in the macrocosm or the microcosm, that did not leave me depressed. Rather, they were powerful works of art that moved me and made me think.

""House of Mirth"" deals with tragic themes, including human society's ability to destroy its own, and the power of hypocrisy and hypocrites. It wasn't, though, moving or thought provoking.

I wasn't moved by Gillian Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor. I didn't believe Gillain Anderson's portrayal of a betrayed woman who lives by her own sense of honor.

Rather, I was bored. I kept wanting the film to go faster. It's a great irony; Edith Wharton's novels are real page turners. Quick, to the point. Hollywood has yet to adapt one of her books in a way that honors this quality.

""House of Mirth"" has gorgeous clothing and sets. I didn't care about anybody onscreen, though. I didn't believe anybody onscreen.

I felt that this movie had a misanthropic agenda, and it moved its players around as if they were chess pieces, as if to prove these points: people are hypocrites, see! People are insincere, see! If a person has any decency at all, that person is destroyed, see!

I would tend to agree with all of the above points. So ... why do I need to watch this movie?

Also, as a woman, who, as Lily Bart was meant to, has lived her life by her own code of honor and paid the price for that, I felt that this movie, no less than the Polite Society it depicts so brutally, betrayed Lily Bart.

Lily Bart is just a step above a passive masochist in this film. She all but participates in her own destruction. You want, just once, for her to show some initiative, some intelligence, some ability to create her own fate.

The film denies her those abilities. In this crippling of Lily Bart, the film seems to hate her as much as polite society does.

Movies like ""Gone with the Wind"" that depict spunky heroines occasionally winning, and occasionally gaining some power, imo, are much easier to watch.

One might argue that such films are not realisitic. I don't know. Even we real-life Lily Barts have our resources, and our triumphs.

And, again, watching Lily Bart in ""House of Mirth"" slowly being eroded onscreen was not a feminist experience for me. It was more of an art house snuff film that utterly disempowered its female heroine.",1151539200,,2524,4.582222222222223
1313599,4,B00003CXS9,"In this beautifully costumed and lavish period piece based upon Edith Wharton's novel of the same name, Gillian Anderson gives an inspired and luminous performance as Lily Bart, a rising young New York socialite who is ultimately done in by a ruthless friend , deliciously played by Laura Linney, who cruelly sacrifices Lily to save her own reputation.

The dry repartee in which Lily engages and passes for wit in this bygone era sets the tone for the film. It is a carefully orchestrated show in which marriageable society girls engage in order to snag the wealthiest suitor. While Lily Bart is the cream of the crop, she has the misfortune to have given her heart to a socially acceptable, yet financially constrained, lawyer, Laurence Selden, wonderfully portrayed by Eric Stoltz. Her heart claimed by this most unsuitable of suitors, she dallys, refusing to commit to any others, while her star is still on the ascent.

Lily finds herself making an unwise financial transaction which puts her at the mercy of an unscrupulous and smarmy financial investor named Gus Trennor, well played by Dan Akroyd. When he puts Lily in a compromising position in return for the money he now claims that she owes him, she indignantly spurns his advances and incurs his emnity. Meanwhile, her aunt, upon whom Lily is financially dependent, hearing of her financial indiscretion, is appalled and vitually cuts Lily out of her will, leaving her a small determinate sum, rather than making Lily her sole heir as expected.

Meanwhile, her friend, devilishly played by Laura Tinney, is on the verge of having her marital indiscretions made known to her circle of society friends. She throws everyone off the scent by cutting her friend Lily in a most public fashion with all the attendant insinuations from which much may be inferred. This has the net effect of causing Lily to fall totally into social disgrace. Her star is now very much on the descent.

When her aunt dies, and Lily is left virtually penniless, Lily finds herself alone and on a downward spiral, forced to earn her daily bread for the first time in her life. Abandoned by her friends, she despairs, even though she has the means of regaining her former status at her fingertips, would her information not also sully the reputation of her true love, Lawrence Selden, as well as that of the false friend who brought her to this point. To her detriment, she takes the high road of love and honor. Too late, Selden realizes the sacrifice that Lily has made on his behalf.

What happens to Lily and why is an interesting study of human frailties, class consciousness, social status, and honor. This film is a beautifully and richly costumed period piece with bravura perfomances by the entire cast. Those who are fond of period dramas will surely enjoy this film.",1146614400,,2811,4.835758835758836
1313600,2,B00003CXS9,"Considering that the Edith Wharton novel on which this movie is based is a literary masterpiece, I expected more from the filmmaking. I imagined it would be a tasty adaptation  along the lines of the marvelous ""Age of Innocence."" But this movie disappoints sorely.

For starters, the two lead actors are just plain wrong. The actor playing Lawrence Seldon has an effeminate voice that negates him as a convincing love interest. And as a character, he is dull and conservative, not the thinking, lawyerly man of the world we know from the book.

Other problems with this adaptation: Gus Trenor isn't alcoholic enough; Sim Rosedale isn't Jewish enough. Worse, the actress who plays the tragic Lily Bart is a hollerer. When she's not pouting, she's hollering her lines. The emotional scenes get louder and louder, just when the viewer would be most affected by subtlety. Sashaying prettily out a door in an expensive dress does not replace good acting.

True, the settings are plush and the costumes are wonderful. But the settings are sooo consistantly plush that one wonders where the non-rich people are hiding. In Wharton's novel, there is contrast. Seldon's cousin lived in an unpretentious apartment  and was involved with social work amongst down and out women.

But this movie combines Seldon's  cousin with Grace Stepney, the rich aunt's beneficiary.  So we never see this contrasting life in the movie, and hence, Lily isn't given the opportunity to redeem herself by showing  kindnes to the disadvantaged. And two  important  characters are rolled into one, which eliminates complexity and serves to soap-opera-ize the movie even more.

Good points? I liked the rich aunt. She was believable, despite being situated in a house too rich for her situation. I also liked the Grace Stepney character. With her hair down, she was convincingly heartbroken. And the tour guide girlfriend of Lily's was nicely done. And so were other minor characters, including George Dorset.

It's a shame that the poor editing or poor acting or whatever it was of the two primary characters served to slaughter this tragic drama so pitifully. I had a dificult time  finding the patience to watch it through it to the end.

While people who enjoy soap opera-like historic romances may like this movie,  if you're an Edith Wharton fan, you'll definitely be disappointed. I recommend watching ""Age of Innocence"" again, and skipping this one.",1144281600,,2424,5.052763819095477
1313601,2,B00003CXS9,"The Edith Wharton novel this movie was made from was beautifully written, sensitive and poetic. While this movie was visually appealing and faithfully rendered the story, the performances of Gillian Anderson and Eric Stoltz were painful to watch. Ms. Anderson especially, while a great beauty, so overdid her lines that I was reminded of high-school plays that I've seen. For emotion or drama, she spoke moreloudly. Her lines were raced through, and punctuated by strange words being stressed. And while she was trying to be distraught, or betrayed, or vulnerable, her face showed no emotion at all. A little bit of eye-brow raised, or pouting lips, but that was all. Eric Stoltz was little better. I couldn't help feel that Ms. Anderson was out of her depth as an actress. Bur Mr. Stoltz, who I've seen in many good roles, was inexplicable. Maybe it was the directing that failed them.

This was so disappointing to me, as I had really wanted to enjoy it, and I had so enjoyed ""The Age of Innocence,"" with Winona Ryder, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Daniel Day-Lewis. But this production, from a superior book, really fell short. I would recommend the PBS version, with Geraldine Chaplin, if it were in any way available.",1142726400,,1215,4.869565217391305
1313685,3,B00003CXS9,"The book was wonderful to read, but the movie lacks something. The actress playing Lily failed to portray Lily as a passionate, willful young lady stilted by the rigid rules of early New York society. This eventually kills her.  Lily's performance was wooden and completely lacking in personality.

Too bad, because this is a great story, based upon Edith Wharton's (the author) own observations of her society, and its destructiveness to those who did not play by its rules.",1140307200,,475,5.0
1313686,4,B00003CXS9,"I saw this movie in the theater at a point in my life when I was semi infatuated with both Gillian Anderson and Edith Wharton.  I have always loved period costumes but for some reason when I first saw this in the theater I was left cold.  My sister bought the DVD and I have seen a few times since.  On my most recent viewing all the coldness I remember from my first viewing has dissipated.

I am going to assume that you know the plot about the promise and decline of Lily Bart (Ms Anderson).  When I first saw it I was waning in my X-Files obsession and hoping for Ms. Anderson to blow me away by very much not being Scully and I think I was to overwhelmed by the stiff upper lip part that she is playing most of the time to notice how she hits the right notes of flirty, self destructive, and questioning.  Unlike Dana Scully, Lily Bart is not brilliant able to work her way through any situation.  She is special, more empathetic with all the characters, particularly the men.  Ironically this means they see whatever they want reflected in her and assume that she will continue living out whatever fantasy life they have set out for her.  The novel is more explicit about this, but the film also addresses this nicely.  The theme is most crystallized in the character of Lawrence Selden, here played by Eric Stoltz.  Lily and Lawrence have the kind of relationship that they play as if it can be Platonic, not realizing how one sided the game is.  Though Lawrence feels he knows the real Lily she is more direct with characters like Sim Rosedale (the always excellent Anthony LaPaglia) with whom she can be frank, even if it is too little too late.

I also need to mention the gleeful malicious performance by Laura Linney another actress I always like.  Her, Bertha Dorset is the Queen of her on reality and she can crush anyone who does not play by her rules.  Her opposite in the story is the more genuine, less powerful Carrie Fiser, played very warmly by Elizabeth McGovern

I also want to note something I did not know when I first saw the film.  During the scene at the opera they are attending a performance of Mozart's Cos fan tutte.  It is a curious choice as I don't think it was at all popular in the early twentieth century, and there is considerable literature about how this opera was abused in productions from after its premier until around the end of the second world war.  Since noticing this opera, (and now that I have seen it performed) I have been trying to get why this was chosen for their outing. I at first think it was the shifts in moods.  The overture is used to wonderful effect for the simultaneous existence of flippant and dark.  There is also the fact that they both start as comedies and then have the supposed lover inflict the kind of pain that only people in love can receive.  There is also the fact that in both works the male characters do not notice the hypocrisy of their judgments of women.  But I think the choice was the anti-romantic, do not put all your faith in a one redeeming love feeling that they both possess.",1139184000,,3070,4.394690265486726
1313687,5,B00003CXS9,"This film has a lot to teach and portray aboout the rigours of social snobbery, a set of unwritten rules govern the plot development, rules which are not entirely a matter for the history books. The recreation of this stifling world in both physical and emotional terms, is outstanding.

 Wharton's novel is adhered to with great accuracy and craft.

Anderson is compelling and tragic as the central character, her pain and misfortune are palpable. What seems like a dry work is soon enlivened by Anderson's slow boil performance and her penultamate scene in which she confesses her pain and hopelessness to Stoltz, is simple heratbreaking.

1313688,5,B00003CXS9,"Writer-director Terence Davies has done a superb job of adapting Edith Wharton's brilliant novel for the screen. Rarely deviating from the source, much of the dialogue is as Ms Wharton wrote it. Set in the Gilded Age of 1905 New York, the film portrays the closed, repressive society of the wealthy aristocracy at the dawn of the 20th century. It is also the story of the downfall of one woman, who attempts to live by her own rules, with no sponsor and no money of her own.

Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) is one of society's most beautiful and accomplished women. She is searching for a rich husband but is drawn to Lawrence Seldon, (Eric Stoltz), a man whom she respects and could love. Seldon, however, is a mere barrister, whose lack of income makes him entirely unsuitable as a spouse. ""Why is it when we meet we always play this elaborate game?"" Lily asks Lawrence, at one point. The answer is that the claustrophobic world they live in gives them no other choice.

Therefore Lily is forced to explore farther afield  for available suitors in the limited circle of her acquaintances. As expected, she is popular with both bachelors and married men. Most of the bachelors propose marriage at one time or another but, on each occasion, she cannot bring herself to marry a man she despises. Though she has little money, she has family connections, good breeding and the hope of coming into an inheritance. Lily has been brought up to be an ornament, as were most women of her class at that time. She is a gilded bird with a noble heart, but clearly she is not aware of the restrictions of her cage. Part of Lily's tragedy is that she does have character, spirit, and a conscience. However, she does not know how to align these attributes, with her ornamental avocation, and her ambitions to marry a wealthy man of good birth.

Lily has developed a gambling habit to support her lifestyle, and to supplement her allowance. An unfortunate losing streak has put her into debt. In her naivete, she forms an unsavory business alliance with a married man, Gus Trenor, (Dan Aykroyd). Later, she is unjustly accused of having an affair with him and their business arrangement also come to light.

Her family cuts her off without a penny because of the scandal. Society friends and connections reject their former darling, trying to extricate themselves from any repercussions Lily's indiscreet behavior may have on their reputations. The irony is that Lily has never committed any of the sins she is accused of. Several friends have done far worse...but with maximum discretion. Lily's crime is indiscretion. Her beaus disappear, as do her marriage prospects. When, in desperation, she reconsiders and decides to accept the proposal of Sim Rosedale, (Anthony LaPaglia), an ambitious and kindly businessman, he is no longer willing to offer her the position of wife, only mistress. The hypocrisy of her class becomes more apparent to her, as she searches for a means to survive, with all the familiar doors closed in her face.

Lily's descent, from society's darling to a penniless, friendless woman is terribly realistic and heartbreaking. The decisions she makes to resolve her situation are astonishing and make the storyline all the more fascinating. You have to see this movie for yourself to discover what happens to our heroine. Director Davies' suffuses the film with an almost unbearable sadness which really captures the tragedy and waste of Lily's life.

Gillian Anderson's performance as the doomed Lily is superb. Lily Bart is one of my favorite literary characters, and I was pleasantly surprised at the former ""X-Files"" costar's portrayal. Her presence is felt in almost every scene and she is captivating to watch. Laura Linney delivers as the vicious hostess Bertha Dorset, and Elizabeth McGovern is terrific as one of Lily's confidantes. The production design is sumptuous. Kudos to cinematographer Remi Adefarisin, who got an Oscar nomination for ""Elizabeth."" Eric Stoltz' portrayal of Seldon is somewhat stiff. I, personally, would have preferred another more charismatic actor to play Lily's love interest. This may have to do more with my taste in men than with Mr. Stoltz's considerable talents. however.

This is an extraordinary film. Highly recommended! And by all means check-out the novel if you have not already read it.

1313689,5,B00003CXS9,"Emily Wharton's play is the source of inspiration for this adapted film placed in the early 20 th Century. The story deals with the life of a beautiful woman in the propitious age to get married and her several flirts with some pretenders.

But the life goes on and her game debts will lead her to unsuspected labyrinths that will seal her fate. The crumbling state of things will make of her an impoverish woman in search of her lost past. Betrayal, greed, ambition, moral double, envy and loneliness will be part of this claustrophobic landscape in the middle of this urban and promising city: New York.

1313690,5,B00003CXS9,"I had never seen this movie before now and barely remember trailers for it. Which is a shame, really. This film is lush, and thoroughly tragic. Believe the acclaim you read about this film.

A world seemingly entirely different than our current one, this Turn of the Century New York is harsh and unforgiving, and demanding. Social facades are everything, and all critical eyes are hungry to spot any mistake anyone makes.

The drama unfolds marvellously and the predicament the strong-willed Lily Bart (Anderson) gets herself in begs the audience for pity and sympathy. Anyone who has had even the smallest amount of financial difficulties or has had any-sized financial hurdles to clear will empathise with Lily's situation. Money is so easy to spend, especially for those living beyond their means, like Lily, something necessary in this superficial time.

In a time when debts are looked down upon much more harshly than in our current times, Lily's fall from society's good opinion is especially cruel.

What's worse for the character is that her ""friend"" heartlessly sets up the final step that ostricises her from good society altogether. The hopeless romance between the one man she truly loves (Stoltz) is heart-breaking to witness, and her stubborn independence and determination to pave her own way and to clear her name is wincingly pathetic.

If Gillian Anderson's performance seems stiff in moments, it is a perfect portrayal of society's rigidity.

All actors are perfectly cast, most surprisingly Dan Aykroyd, who plays his cold investor role marvellously.

I had never imagine her in such a difficult role and she gave a multi-layered and powerful performance. With a superb supporting cast, she still managed to carried the film all the way to the end.
Anderson plays a high society single-lady in search of a healthy husband, because she grew up in proverty, and dued to her gambling addiction and bad investment with Dan Arkroy who scammed her money, she was going through bankruptcy. Her aunt rejected her, her friend(Laura Linney) walked away on her, and she rejected her only true suitor(Anthony Lapilliga).

1313694,3,B00003CXS9,"This film version of Edith Wharton's ""The House of Mirth"" should be commended as a good attempt to bring the classic 1900's novel of manners to the big screen.  However, while the director makes a laudable effort to adhere to the text, there are too many missing pieces to encompass the entirety of the tragedy that is Lily Bart.  The removal of key sequences and themes - her parental influences, the irony of charity, her personal fear of filth and dinginess, Selden's role as a spectator and Lily's art, and the final scene with Netty's baby - leaves us with a separated, disjointed view of Lily.  In short, the lack of setting and background means that if you have not read the book, you will not like this film.  It leaves too much to the imagination.
While Gillian Anderson gives a good portrayal of Lily, the other actors hardly do their characters justice.  Dan Aykroyd should stick to ""Ghostbusters"" or ""My Girl"" rather than attempting Gus Trenor; he simply doesn't fit this role. Elizabeth McGovern is blunt and leaves me cold, when her written character has far more heart than we are given in this interpretation.  Eric Stoltz's portrayal of Selden is perhaps the most divergent from the character we know in the novel, but apart from a bad interpretation of the character the actor himself comes across as insincere - he is not Wharton's Lawrence Selden.
Overall, the film is good, but it lacks the emotion, the background, and the establishment of setting that would have made it great.  Granted, the two hour time of the film would have been far longer if the things I have pointed out were to be included, but maybe someday the BBC or A&E will take on the project and do it the full justice it deserves.

Some of the language is not widely used today but was perfect for the time and the actors were good at conveying the meaning through their expressions and tone. At the beginning of the film the main character is not very likeable and seemed to be strickly worried about society and her place in it but as the film goes on we find that she is trusting because she is trustworthy to her friends and true love. When she can clear her name she sacrifices for her true love. Even though this is a period film I found myself sympathetic to Lily's situation. Wonderful performances by all.

And nobody ever did!  The style fluctuated far too often between poetics and colloquialisms, many of the latter seeming entirely too modern for 1905.

1313775,4,B00003CXS9,"This film came out more than half a dozen years after THE AGE OF INNOCENCE, but the earlier film enjoyed a much more widespread critical and financial success than THE HOUSE OF MIRTH ever found. The reason? Both are adapted from Edith Wharton novels, both are set in the same time period and place, both have self-destructive characters at their center-- but THE AGE OF INNOCENCE had a major name director (Martin Scorcese) and big name stars (Daniel Day-Lewis, Winona Ryder, and Michelle Pfeiffer) and MIRTH had a little-known British director (Terence Davies) and a star who many were not prepared to see outside of her role in a hit television show (Gillian Anderson), let alone in a period piece.
Audiences missed out-- as did the Academy, which did not see fit to grace it with a single Oscar nomination. MIRTH was distributed by Sony Pictures Classics, which appears to have put all of their efforts (and promotional dollars) behind CROUCHING TIGER HIDDEN DRAGON that year. Sadly, promotion, not merit, is the name of the game with the Academy (not that TIGER wasn't a good film), although there now seems to be rumblings about reforming the process, i.e. for studios to stop ""buying"" votes by way of copious, conspicuous freebies and promos (see Miramax and SHAKESPEARE IN LOVE).
So, having dealt with the two strikes against it (no big names, little promotion), I can say that this is an exceptional film. Gillian Anderson fits Lily Bart like a glove-- Lily's humor, her charm, her impetuousness, and her ultimate desperation are all captured in luminous tones. She is ably supported by Anthony LaPaglia and Dan Ackroyd as, respectively, Rosedale and Gus Trenor (both well-cast-- if one can abandon preconceived notions about what sorts of roles they should and should not play :-) ), although I felt that Eric Stoltz' Selden was somewhat wooden (hardly the type that Lily would be drawn to) and was a bit confused by the combining of Gerty Farish and Grace Stepney into one character-- the novel puts these two characters at very different poles in Lily's life, and the combined character often doesn't make sense in how she interacts with Lily. However, the positively TOXIC performance by Laura Linney as the scheming Bertha Dorset is a stand-out-- from her first appearance you know that she will somehow assure Lily's destruction.
Lily's descent is frustrating yet riveting; we see how each poor decision and misstep take her further from her goal (to take her place in high society as the wife of a wealthy, respectable man) and place her in the gunsights of ""indiscreet"" Bertha-- who quite handily uses her as a scapegoat when her own infidelities threaten to catch up with her. But we follow Lily, and care about her, because she has a spark and vibrancy that the more ""respectable"" women lack. Lily doesn't deserve what happens to her-- she is victimized not only through her own actions (and inactions) but by the cold, unforgiving nature of women in her ""circle"" and the unwillingness of the men to challenge the status quo.  Both Rosedale and Trenor are diffident in their interactions (Ackroyd is particularly brutish in one key scene; who knew he had such nastiness in him?) with Lily, and Selden is ineffectual at best-- he has no right to agonize over her increasingly intenable position (as Lily sharply reminds him in a especially wrenching scene), nor to ultimately cry for her, as he has not involved himself in her life to a level that would have made a difference in her fate.
Those who have read the novel (as I have) know the outcome, but Gillian Anderson keeps us riveted to her-- she continues to fight for herself, and thus inspires the viewer to stay with her wherever her life leads. So yes, it IS a slog, in a way-- Wharton excels in creating fascinating yet ultimately self-destructive characters-- but oh, can any of us turn away from the wonder that is Lily Bart?",1057795200,,3904,4.826865671641791
1313776,5,B00003CXS9,"An absolute travesity that this movie was overlooked come Oscar time. If Laura Linney could get a nomination for her breakout performance in YOU CAN COUNT ON ME (which she deserved), then Gillian Anderson deserved one as well. Boy, visions of Dana Scully were put aside in about five minutes. She was gorgeous and intelligent and glowing and handled the dialogue perfectly. I can't wait to see her do more juicy movie roles.
I won't rehash the plot, but suffice it to say this is a gripping, but slow-moving ""romantic suspense story."" Will she or won't she is putting it pretty simply. The social politics involved are foreign (somewhat) to us, but the screenplay keeps things simple and understandable. (Where was this screenplay's Oscar nod?) We are sucked into the movie as our heroine's plight gets more horrific. The women in this movie are all terrific. Eric Stoltz is even quite good.
The ending is devastating in its simplicity and tragedy. I highly recommend the movie for anyone who doesn't feel their movies need to move at the speed of a jet plane.",1042934400,,1060,4.797814207650274

There are many deep, serious conversations under the guise of light-hearted banter. The movie keeps the spirit of the book, with only a few slight changes (two characters in the book are combined into one for the movie, for instance). The story is basically a comment about the structure of society in the early 20th century, and it follows the story of a young and poor society woman and her choices. If you don't like sad endings, you may not enjoy this movie, but for those who love to be moved, this is a jewel!

Her presence is riveting and fully three-dimensional as she portrays a woman with an unique spirit and intelligence far exceeding the time period in which she lives.  Her downward plunge into misery and destitution is stark and compelling.  I have seen few performaces as finely nuanced as this one.  Great praise is also due to her fellow actors.  A tragic but incredible movie!,1031011200,,486,4.878048780487805
1313910,5,B00003CXS9,"When we talk about great novels that deal with the downfall of a young woman, Edith Wharton's ""The House of Mirth"" does not get mentioned in the same breath with ""Madame Bovary,"" ""The Awakening,"" and ""Anna Karenina.""  Certainly there are substantial differences since Wharton's heroine Lily Bart is not a married woman seeking comfort in an adulterous affair; she is a single woman searching for a husband, playing the game of flirtation, and weighing her options.  But in the end her destruction makes her a kindred spirit to Emma Bovary and the others.  In fact, because her sins are relatively small and her destruction so complete, Lily Bart is a much more memorable tragic figure.
I came to this film version of ""The House of Mirth"" with no expectations other than a breakthrough performance by actress Gillian Anderson in the role of Lily.  As it dawned upon me that we were watching the complete and total destruction of a human being by the venal society of which she thought she was a permanent member, Anderson's performance took on a truly haunting aspect.  The result is as restrained an emotional performance as you have ever seen, reflecting the slower tempo of the times depicted (watch the measured pace of Lily's walk, both in the opening sequence at the train station and when the gilded society walks up the massive staircase to the opera).
Like Lily, we have our expectations of the characters in this gilded society shattered as the story progresses and she begins her descent into hell.  The man who comes to her financial assistance, Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd), is looking for something in return; the man who would take her as a trophy wife in a loveless marriage, Sim Rosedale (Anthony LaPaglia), is ultimately the only person who will treat her decently; the man she truly loves, Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz) is unworthy of her affections; and the man who would treat her the way she truly deserves, George Dorset (Terry Kinney), is married to the instrument of her destruction and therefore beyond her reach.  The ultimate irony is that Lily's character has a strength greater than those around her, but it does her no good in the end, when even her personal dignity is not enough to sustain her.
The measured performances throughout this film are superb, but it is Laura Linney as Bertha Dorset who stands out with her ability to inject pure venom into a quick glance or a few well chosen words.  Anderson was not exactly robbed of an Oscar nomination for her performance, but if she had received one no one would have blinked an eye.  Certainly this role will open up some serious doors for her down the road as she enters the rest of her career after Scully.  ""The House of Mirth"" lacks the spectacle of ""Age of Innocence,"" but I do not want to dock a film rating stars because of how much money they had to put things on the screen.  This film starts slowly but then builds up a compelling momentum.
Terence Davies audio commentary is extremely insightful (I especially like his comment on how American actors use their eyes), although he picks his moments, usually at the beginning of scenes.  His emphasis is on both the adaptation of Wharton's novel and the actual production of the film.  With regard to the former he talks about the decision to combine characters or other alterations, and takes great pleasure in identifying those lines which are his own creation rather than Wharton's.  The latter topic evidences how the director solved the problems of an $8 million budget filming in and around Glascow.  Davies talks less than half the time during the audio commentary, but what is there is certainly first-rate.  He also provides a spirited defense of the deleted scenes, most of which are longer versions of those in the film and which provide additional layers of density to the complex character relationships.  Clearly, Davies was a writer-director passionately involved in the creation of his film.",1026604800,,3944,4.819259259259259

1313914,5,B00003CXS9,"....but not dreary
This film is MORE than pretty costumes and beautiful sets.
The acting on ALL PARTS is very good. Gillian Anderson surprised me, I like her in her role as Scully on the X-files but didn't expect her to pull this off...I was wrong
Based on a story by Edith Wharton, and set in New York in the early turn of the 20th century.
Gillian Anderson plays Lily Bart. She lives with her aunt who gives her a modest allowance. Lily has a taste for luxury and insists she pays her own way, she plays bridge for money, creating debts...she's very naive
She has many influencial suitors and could easily marry. But she's in love with Lawrence Selden (Stoltz) a lawyer. Who is equally in love with Lily, but neither seem to want to marry.
One of her suitors, a married investor ""Gus"" Trenor, offers to invest some money for her, ending with a sum of $9,000. She spends it, only to learn that it was actually his money. She can't do what he expects from her, so now she's in debt to him.
She becomes in posession of some letters which could be very damaging to her married friend Bertha Dorset (Linney) ; which Bertha had written to Lawrence Selden. Bertha seems to be in an unhappy marriage with her husband George, George tells Lily, if it wasn't for her he would had left Bertha long ago.
Tensions grow between Bertha & Lily, when Lily accompanies them on their yacht. Bertha goes off with a man and doesn't come back to the boat until 7.00 A.M. When Lily approaches her, Bertha turns on her and makes a scene at a dinner party, telling Lily she won't be allowed back on the yacht with her and George.
Her aunt dies and instead of leaving everything to Lily (like everyone expected) Lily only gets $10,000. Which will have to go directly to Mr. Trenor. Mr. Rosedale ( Anthony La Paglia) offers to marry her, only if she uses the letters against Bertha, which would ""redeem"" Lily in the eyes of her society...""It'd be so easy"" she'd have Bertha in the palm of her hand.
She declines... Mr. Selden is also tied to the letters
She instead enters the working class, attempting apprenticeship at millinery, but that doesn't work. Mrs. Hatch takes her in to keep track of her appointments and fill her prescribtions, but lets her go; she fears Lily's reputation might taint her... Lily leaves Mrs Hatch but keeps one of her prescriptions......
Lily refuses all offers of help, even Mr. Rosedale's offer to pay off her debt to Mr. Trenor..she won't swallow her pride, and wants to go it alone.....to the tragic end...
Gillian Anderson is enjoyable, her portrayal is fresh & poignant . Laura Linney is always good, as is Eric Stoltz and Anthony La Paglia. Hopefully we will be seeing more of Gillian Anderson.
It IS a long movie just over 2 1/2 hours, but I hardly noticed. Perhaps not the kind of movie you could watch over and over. But it's a good movie.",1021161600,,2854,4.490384615384615

This cast is simply not up to acting a period drama (at least Dan Aykroyd realized this and didn't even try).

However, the more prominent theme, the theme that plays during the opening scene and the theme that the Lily Bart character pecks out on the piano, is the 2nd movement of the Marcello Oboe Concerto (sans oboe). It is a beautiful and lamentful theme that, in my opinion, is one of the most beautiful pieces of music ever written.

Since first seeing her as the skeptical FBI agent on Fox TV, I've come to realize, along with a legion of fans, that her success is not a fluke.  Gillian Anderson can act...beautifully!  She proves this with her role as Lily Bart, a woman who makes some painful mistakes in the direction her life should take and pays the ultimate price.  At a time when a woman's role is defined by her marriage to a man, Lily tries to stall her acceptance of marriage, hoping that the man she loves will come around.  Losing her chances for a life with an acceptable position in society, she soon becomes the victim of the back stabbing of a so-called friend, played wonderfully by Laura Linney.  Unfortunately for Lily, she begins a downward spiral that can only end in tragedy. The cast in this movie (Eric Stoltz, Laura Linney, especially) is very good.  The direction, though not as good as Martin Scorsese's ""The Age of Innocence"", moves the story along nicely. I highly recommend this film.",1014422400,,1113,4.6479591836734695

Instead of feeling sorry for the Lily Bart character I was actually relieved when she got flushed -- she is just so painfully stupid and manages to be destructive to herself and several other people.
Also, instead of ""a captured dryad"", Ms. Anderson looks worried and very short, so I have to think that this was a casting mistake. Unlike the movie ""The Age of Innocence"", when you could feel sorry for the main characters because they were trapped in a society that distorted their lives, I ended up feeling that all of her ""friends"" were better off without Lily Bart...
I gave it 3 stars because it looks so good, and because I thought that the director was successful in doing what he wanted, although I suspect that he didn't do justice to the book.",1011571200,,894,4.5246913580246915

Merchant/Ivory this is not--the direction is pedestrian, lacking any of the sweep and flow of the M/I period productions, and the acting is sub-par. The cast, with a few exceptions, are painfully not at home in this idiom--unnatural performances and stilted, almost comically overannunciated delivery are the norm. (We get the point--these were stiff, formal folk--but even Titanic did a better job of getting its Victorian uppercrusters to seem authentic.) Gillian Anderson is simply miscast, and Stolz is unfortunately wooden. Still, the story is compelling in spite of these cinematic shortcomings, and the film never lost my interest. Its message is powerful and touching; its characters (as written by Wharton) compelling.

1314004,4,B00003CXS9,"As a person who really loves Edith Wharton's beautiful novel, I was deeply impressed by the film.
  I didn't think Gillian Anderson did the opening scene in Seldon's apartment very well, ditto for some of the other scenes in the beginning, so at first I was kind of disappointed, but  as the show went on I was more and more thrilled with her performance. The last few scenes were so beautifully tragic it was heartbreaking.
  It is very faithful to the book, with some mild alterations that were probably for the best, for instance in the book Lily rarely cries, but the reader understands her inward agony so tears are not necessary. For a movie, I guess you need more visual stuff, so she's more teary. One change that surprised me was that the character of Gerty Farish had been left out, and oddly combined with that of Grace Stepney, to create a rather strange person who was almost creepy.
  Still, if you loved the book, you'll love the movie. I would urge all Edith Wharton fans to see it. . . it is  worth the viewing time and may even increase your appreciation for the book. Definitely one of my favorite movies, and extremely well acted, it'll rip your heart out.",1011052800,,1176,4.514150943396227
1314005,3,B00003CXS9,"There's precious little mirth in ""The House of Mirth,"" a complex, though sluggishly paced, study of Victorian Era morality (though, technically, this film is set a few years after that time, during the early years of the 20th Century).  ""The House of Mirth"" was Edith Wharton's first novel and, although I much prefer her later works like ""The Custom of the Country"" and ""The Age of Innocence,"" this maiden effort is not without its virtues.
Like many of the Henry James novels upon which Wharton consciously patterned her own, ""The House of Mirth"" is a harsh indictment of the class-consciousness and false values that permeated life for the well-to-do class during that era.  It casts a scathing eye on a society that offered so few opportunities for women, yet demanded that they live up to such an impossibly high standard of behavior.  In the story, Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) comes to experience the subtle brutality of this tea-and-crumpets world, where favors come with hefty price tags of compromised virtue, where one's position of comfort can be suddenly obliterated at the whiff of a scandal or the utterance of a rumor, and where trusted friends, in such a case, can be the first to abandon one on the shoals of poverty - all in the cause of social expediency.
Taken as a bare-boned story, ""The House of Mirth"" is really quite interesting - especially in its later, darker section wherein we see Lily stripped of all her social connections and forced to try to make her way in a world that has been designed to block her every move.  She becomes quite a sympathetic figure as the movie goes along.  But how long it takes us to get to the point where we really care!  For long stretches of this film, we find ourselves wishing it would at least pick up the pace somewhat.  We know that the film is not intended to be a fast-moving work, but ""The House of Mirth"" often confuses slowness and drabness with high drama and art.  Only in the latter stages, where the character connections finally fall into place and where Lily's plight becomes one with which we can identify, does the film truly pique our interest.
The casting also seems quite problematic at times.  Anderson does a find job conveying the wistful sadness of Lily at the end of the film, but her hangdog expression seems inappropriate in the early scenes.  Eric Stoltz is far too much of a milquetoast as the man who might save her and Dan Akroyd is nothing short of an embarrassment as an older married friend who makes a move on Lily in exchange for some badly needed cash.
""The House of Mirth"" makes some profound statements about the plight of women living at the last turn-of-the-century.  I'm just not sure how relevant it is to women living at THIS turn-of-the-century - except perhaps to show them how much better they have it now.",1010793600,,2816,4.668686868686868

The storyline and editing are choppy, dull, and annoying (as if it's a mainstream movie that's attempting to be arthouse), and for some reason, Anderson's character isn't quite believable. Above all, though, it's a story about a woman who a) is a bit dim, b) is selfish, and c) is unable to communicate with her friends or ask for simple assistance when she's in trouble. I couldn't figure that one out - is she really stupid, or can't she swallow her pride for five seconds? I may seem harsh, but sincerely, who wants to watch a movie (that isn't a comedy) about someone who's selfish and stupid? The only redeeming moments are those with Eric Stoltz, whose character has half a brain (only half), and the villains, Dan Aykroyd (he makes an excellent bad guy) and Laura Linney.

Unlike most period dramas, this doesn't show the blissful romance of the lifestyle of the rich or spend time panning around beautiful green hills.  Its instant sense of reality is stunning and brings you right to the front of the action.
Here we see Gillian Anderson, who won the British Independent Film Award for Best Actress for this, as Lily Bart constantly searching for fulfilment.  As she turns down various suitors and is manipulated through her own naivity, we see her gradually spiral downwards.  Here we are shown the cruelty of society, with Lily's friends quite prepared to discard her when her fortunes change.
Anderson's performance as her fortunes change is absolutely mesmerising.  She perfectly displays Lily's shock and horror as society spurns her, as well as her desperate scrabble for a scrap of self-dignity.  Here the general public are shown what 'X-Files' viewers have known for a long time (especially through episodes such as 'Memento Mori') - that TV actors can actually act.  This film is a real tour de force, and has seen that after leaving the hit TV show, Anderson will surely be taken seriously in the movie world.",1007856000,,1294,4.9308755760368665
1314011,4,B00003CXS9,"I've always loved well done period dramas, since they give us a glimpse in bygone and sometimes less hectic times, and many times show that the people who lived back then were sometimes not all that different then us.
Such is the case with this excellent picture which stars the X-Files Gillian Anderson as Lilly Bart, a beautiful New York heiress in the opening years of the 20th century. Like many women of her class, Lilly is trolling for the ideal man to become her husband so she can live in comfort. Eric Stoltz portrays her true love, a lawyer of modest means, whose reduced station prevents him from taking Lilly as his wife, seeing as she's after bigger fish in the matromonial pool.
  The film plays out as sort of greek tragedy as we watch Lilly slowly decend from her lofty station to the depths of despair both through her own actions, (She runs up a large gambling debt, and spends extravegently), and through the actions of those she trusted as freinds, (Dan Akroyd as a banker who offers to pay her debts if she'll become his mistress, or Bertha, who is willing to sully her best freinds reputation in order to cover up her own sexual indescrections) Through it all Lilly holds the key that'll bring about her salvation (A group of incriminating letters) but she hesitates to use them, instead allowing herself to brought low, finally taking her own life in an East side rooming house.
This is a lush film, full of period detail that requires the viewer to pay close attention. Ms Anderson's performance is of Oscar caliber and it is a great didservice that she was not at least nominated for this role as she brings Lilly across beautifully in all her moods from the flightyness of a money heiress at the films beginning to the dark mood of the end when she has fallen to the bottom from her once lofty perch.

From the moment she walks out of the cloud of steam created by a train and turns her veiled face to Eric Stoltz, she completely transcends Scully. Anderson plays Lily Bart, who's gambling habit and tendancy to fraternize with men leads to her social downfall in turn of the century New York. She knows she should marry a man with money, but she loves Stoltz's character, Lawrence Seldon, a young attorney who is financially secure but not well off. Through a series of social blunders and failures to understand the motives of several characters, Lily soon finds herself on the outside of society living as a drug addict and making hats. Gillian Anderson plays Lily with such heart-breaking stubborness that most of the time you want to climb through the screen and shake her. But this is a typical Edith Wharton story, and the good guys rarely, if ever, come out on top. Watching Anderson's physical change is one of the most amazing aspects of this film. In the beginning, she is bright and bubbly with a perfect complexion and clear eyes. By the end, her exhaustion and addiction is palpable--her entire body seems to have changed in some way.

After that I looked forward to the movie even more, and when I finally got to see it, I was not disappointed. I had been told it would never get to theatres here, so I pre-ordered it on DVD from the UK and had it delivered just a few days after it was released. At the time, I didn't even own a DVD-player -- I was just happy to finally own the movie, even if I couldn't see it yet. Of course that didn't last long. The following weekend, I bought myself a DVD-player. I finally watched the movie that same afternoon, and I... fell in love. This is a beautiful, tragic, moving and touching film -- a true masterpiece. How they failed to give Gillian Anderson an Oscar nomination is still a mystery. Her portrayal of Lily Bart is not only moving and truthful -- it is pure brilliance. As we get to follow Lily's descent in society, we feel for her. When she cries, our hearts break for her. When she loses her spark, something inside of us dies as well. But at the same time, something is brought to life inside of us -- the appreciation for a performance as good as this; something you will carry with you for a long time. This is really Gillian Anderson's movie, despite the fact that she has many great co-actors (the love-scenes with Eric Stoltz's Selden are sizzling with underlying passion, and Laura Linney's Bertha is just pure evil). Buy it, watch it, feel it and ultimately fall in love with it.",1005523200,,1557,4.3174061433447095
1314121,5,B00003CXS9,"""House of Mirth"" is an absorbing character study of a proud woman's social downfall at her own hands, leading ultimately to her complete demise.  The story is intricately told, accurately portraying the subtleties and treacheries of polite society in more stilted times.  Director Terence Davies does an outstanding job with a limited budget in rendering the look and feel of the period.  His character development is probing and filled with nuance, although the pacing is a bit slow and perhaps too inclusive.
The story of Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) is a classic tale of a fall from grace resulting from excessive pride and self indulgence.  Davies draws us in to her world, laying bare both her noble and arrogant sides and giving us conflicted feelings about her eventual fate.  On one hand, her adherence to her principles is admirable, yet on the other it is difficult to pity her when her decadence and inability to compromise almost assure her doom.
I cannot rave enough about Gillian Anderson's performance in this film.  Prior to this film I had little regard for her acting ability, assessing her to be a one dimensional character actor propelled to cult status by a popular TV show.  Taking this part was a monumental risk for her, shedding the familiar bonds of her emotionally contained Scully persona to take on a character swirling in a volitile hurricane of emotion.  She handles it magnificently.  Her performance has great volume, reaching far, wide and deep into her character's psyche and bleeding it effusively onto the screen.  After seeing this tour de force performance, I am left wondering why she wastes her time on television (I guess her multi million dollar ""X Files"" contract might have some bearing on it).
The rest of the cast is barely adequate to the task of supporting Anderson.  Dan Aykroyd is miscast for this part.  He simply doesn't have the sinister side that the role requires.  Eric Stolz' character is supposed to be very stolid, but Stolz so understates the character that he comes across as lifeless and wooden.  Laura Linney is the best of the supporting cast portraying Bertha Dorset as charmingly diabolical and affected.
This film is a wonderful throwback to the days when the story mattered.  Its classical underpinnings give it a tragic richness you don't see much anymore.  I rated it a 9/10.  It requires a patient and intelligent viewer, but for those who appreciate powerful character studies it will be a treat.",1001980800,,2469,4.939467312348668
1314122,5,B00003CXS9,"Gillian Anderson is absolutely devastating in Terrance Davies' brilliant adaptation of Wharton's great trash novel.  The film is surely stifling at times, but the material couldn't be handled any other way. We need to feel as claustrophobic as Lily Bart if we're meant to understand her circumstance. The film's look and direction understand this quite well. When the camera is freed from a sitting room, however, the we feel an absolute senese of freedom. There is mirth here for the audience, if not for Lily. Laura Linney, with great economy, turns in her best performance of 2000 (forget You Can Count on Me), and Dan Ackroyd shows a mean streak he never even hinted at before. It's soap opera-style tragedy at its absolute finest, infused with a great deal of restraint and class.",999648000,,785,4.902255639097745
1314123,5,B00003CXS9,"Gillian Anderson's exceptionally sensitive performance makes this film a wonderful adaptation. Although this particular screenplay focuses more sharply on Lily's social fall (e.g. Grace Stepney and Gertie Farish are fused into Grace), the effect is no less profound. Laura Linney does a stunning job of playing the execrable Bertha Dorset (second only to Lawrence's Hermione in the literary slime hall of fame). Linney combines just the right amount of smugness and smoothly manipulated ignorance; thus she embodies perfectly the monstrous society whose contradictory rules ultimately take Lily's life. Eric Stotlz plays the anti-hero Selden with great tenderness, and the relationship between him and Lily is probably one of the most intricately beautiful moments ever captured on screen.",999561600,,789,5.752136752136752
1314124,4,B00003CXS9,"For fans of Edith Wharton's novel (and fans of period pieces in general), you will be relieved to know that this film stays true to Wharton's story. Critics and audiences griped that this film (directed by Terence Davies) was too long--and at 2 hours and 20 minutes, it does demand something of the viewer. But fans of Wharton and films set in this era (early 1900s New York) will find it gripping. The film tells the story of Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson of ""X-Files"" fame), a society woman who has little money of her own and lives with her demanding aunt. Lily is beautiful, but foolish about money and men--and these two things become her downfall. She has debts from playing cards with other members of the upper crust, and she steadfastly refuses to become more involved with Lawrence Selden (Eric Stoltz), her true love, because he lacks the money to support her in the style to which she is accustomed. Lily chases after a wealthy husband, but every time that she seems on the verge of making a match, her mistakes come back to haunt her. She foolishly trusts Gus Trenor (Dan Aykroyd) to invest her money for her--but Trenor, smitten with Lily, ultimately uses her debts to blackmail her as reputation becomes more and more tarnished. Lily's downfall is tragic--the final 40 minutes are so are very bleak, but this is true not only to Wharton's novel, but also to the plight of women in that era, whose value was only defined by their marriageability. There is solid acting almost all the way around. Gillian Anderson looks lovely and works the full range of emotions demanded of her. Eric Stoltz as Selden seems like a calm and stable center in this world of flighty and poisonous people. And Laura Linney, as the woman who does the most to bring about Lily's downfall, is perfection. This film is tough going, but extremely well done. Davies captures the suffocating atmosphere of upper-crust life in 1900s New York, and Gillian Anderson makes for a remarkable heroine.",998956800,,1978,4.736231884057971
1314125,4,B00003CXS9,"In this beautifully costumed and lavish period piece based upon Edith Wharton's novel of the same name, Gillian Anderson gives an inspired and luminous performance as Lily Bart, a rising young New York socialite who is ultimately done in by a ruthless friend , deliciously played by Laura Linney, who cruelly sacrifices Lily to save her own reputation.

The dry repartee in which Lily engages and passes for wit in this bygone era sets the tone for the film. It is a carefully orchestrated show in which marriageable society girls engage in order to snag the wealthiest suitor. While Lily Bart is the cream of the crop, she has the misfortune to have given her heart to a socially acceptable, yet financially constrained, lawyer, Laurence Selden, wonderfully portrayed by Eric Stoltz. Her heart claimed by this most unsuitable of suitors, she dallys, refusing to commit to any others, while her star is still on the ascent.

Lily finds herself making an unwise financial transaction which puts her at the mercy of an unscrupulous and smarmy financial investor named Gus Trennor, well played by Dan Akroyd. When he puts Lily in a compromising position in return for the money he now claims that she owes him, she indignantly spurns his advances and incurs his emnity. Meanwhile, her aunt, upon whom Lily is financially dependent, hearing of her financial indiscretion, is appalled and vitually cuts Lily out of her will, leaving her a small determinate sum, rather than making Lily her sole heir as expected.

Meanwhile, her friend, devilishly played by Laura Linney, is on the verge of having her marital indiscretions made known to her circle of society friends. She throws everyone off the scent by cutting her friend Lily in a most public fashion with all the attendant insinuations from which much may be inferred. This has the net effect of causing Lily to fall totally into social disgrace. Her star is now very much on the descent.

When her aunt dies, and Lily is left virtually penniless, Lily finds herself alone and on a downward spiral, forced to earn her daily bread for the first time in her life. Abandoned by her friends, she despairs, even though she has the means of regaining her former status at her fingertips, would her information not also sully the reputation of her true love, Lawrence Selden, as well as that of the false friend who brought her to this point. To her detriment, she takes the high road of love and honor. Too late, Selden realizes the sacrifice that Lily has made on his behalf.

What happens to Lily and why is an interesting study of human frailties, class consciousness, social status, and honor. This film is a beautifully and richly costumed period piece with bravura perfomances by the entire cast. Those who are fond of period dramas will surely enjoy this film.",998265600,,2811,4.835758835758836
1314126,5,B00003CXS9,"I went into House of Mirth with considerable expectations - both the novel and Gillian Anderson are high on my list of favorites.  I had put off viewing the DVD out of fear that it would disappoint, but there was no need - it was wonderful.
Gillian Anderson has the ability to pull the viewer completely into her world - whatever it may be.  Her subtlety is perfect for the role of Lily Bart - propelling this film into my personal top ten list.  Without giving too much away, Anderson's Bart is a beautiful study of grace and dignity under pressure.  The tone and style of the film is as close as possible to that of the novel - very well done.",998179200,,645,4.262295081967213

We didn't particularly care what happened at the end; we just wanted the tedious affair to expire.  These period piece usually don't move very fast anyway, but this one made glaciers look like tornadoes in comparison.  The DVD picture quality was uneven; some shots were spectacular, while others (expecially those with Ms. Anderson) looked like they were shot through some sort of filter. I know this film was well received by most critics. I guess we just missed the point.",997833600,,664,4.867256637168142
1314224,4,B00003CXS9,"I watched this movie purely because Gillian Anderson of the X-files was starring in it.  As an X-files fan, I have followed movies by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, having enjoyed both their roles on TV.  I suspected but did not know that Gillian Anderson, had the range, I saw in this movie.  She is phenomenal.  She conveys all the emotions, so clearly on her face.
SOCIALITE LILY BART IS A FREE SPIRIT WITH A GOOD HEART:
As socialite Lily Bart, she conveys the intelligence and understanding of social politics that a single woman of that day often had to have. But, unfortunately, she also conveys an genuine pureness of heart as few others that played this game did.  She opted for an integrity that few around her employed.
THE SOCIAL POLITICS ARE INCREDIBLE:
This movie in the first half an hour paints the main players of the social circle Lily is in and you see the positioning and games that are being played.  It is a bit confusing at first until you learn who is who.
IN THE EARLY 1900s, HIGH SOCIETY YOUNG WOMEN HAD ONE JOB, FIND A POSITIONED HUSBAND WITH A CERTAIN AMOUNT OF MONEY.
The only real job for a young women of this time in this circle is to find a husband.  Such a calculated manuever, without involvement of the heart she has already given, does not suit Lily.  She is stuck in a quandry.  She knows what she needs to do to secure her position, but does not have the calculating heart to do it.  Ironically, she is well aware that she is alone in this devotion at one point in time, but remains steadfast in her devotion.  Except for one moment in time when she was tempted and regretted what she was about to do.
A MANUEVER OF A CLOSE FRIEND, COMPROMISES LILYS SOCIAL POSITION AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM;
The manuevers of a so-called friend, that Lily trusts compromise her position, and in turn influences many other facets of her life that she does not as yet comprehend.  Amazing how none of her friends intervene to help.  I guess the society thought then was if you are too stupid to protect yourself that is a fault in itself.  However here, ignorance is not bliss.
To reveal the situation, would do you the reader an injustice.  But, it really is amazing how situations can be manipulated.  Gillian Anderson, does a remarkable job of portraying a young woman with integrity realizing she is in a game that is not quite so cleanly played.
WARNING:  To those of you, that like to walk away from a movie in a cheerful up mood, this is not the movie for you.  It is true to life and particularly frustrating in the lessons learned.  Reputation is something not so much owned by you, but by others idea of you and is influenced only so much by what you actually do and the rest is pure spin.  You just have to be careful on who else can influence that spin.
Masterful job.
THE REASON THIS MOVIE GOT A 4 INSTEAD OF A 5 IS THAT IS WAS A BIT TOO ARTSY IN PARTS You were at a loss occassionally with the sweeping pictures of covered furniture, water being cut by the bow of a boat and a couple of other scenes that seemed pure visual effect.  These did not seem overly pertinent and added about 15 minutes more to the picture.",997574400,,3151,4.3982758620689655
1314225,3,B00003CXS9,"In other words, shallow. The fact of the matter is that this film is little more than a costume period piece, with not much in the way of character development. Lily Bart is hardly an admirable heroine. A compulsive gambler, she is looking for a RICH MAN to solve all of her financial problems. In other words, like all other people who want to marry for money, she is simply a prostitute. There is nothing unique in this sad little drama; in fact, it is constantly being played out in Silicon Valley and Beverly Hills today.

1314226,5,B00003CXS9,"Beautiful.  Stunning.  Astonishing.  Heartwrenching.
All these describe The House of Mirth, the movie based on Edith Wharton's 1905 novel, a piece so utterly overwhelming in its visual and literary beauty that the viewer ends up feeling somewhat drained by the experience.  Drained in a wonderful way.
When was the last time you sat down and watched a movie and connected fully with the main characters?  If it's been a while--and I know it had been for me--then this movie is for you.  The film follows the beautiful Miss Lily Bart, a twenty-nine-year-old single socialite who cannot be accused of having good luck...at all.  The film is based upon Wharton's novel, and the novel must be classified as a naturalist piece, even by the most optimistic of critics.  Viewers find themselves drawn to Miss Bart, even as they want to cry out, ""No, Lily!  Think!""  Lily becomes the most intriguing, endearing character due to Gillian Anderson's astonishing portrayal, the perfect combination of poise, restraint, and emotion, not to mention the feminine wiles that characterize the always beguiling Miss Lily Bart.  Anderson, the long-time star of the cult television classic The X-Files, won the best actress award for the film at both The Village Voice Film Critics' Poll and The British Independent Film Awards in 2000.  And trust me, she deserves it.
Other than Ms. Anderson's lovely portrayal, the film also includes performances by Dan Aykroyd (and he is surprisingly wonderful), Terry Kinney, Anthony LaPaglia, Laura Linney (of You Can Count on Me), and the gorgeous Eric Stoltz, whom many have called a younger Colin Firth/Mr. Darcy of The House of Mirth.  They all put in beautiful performances.
Simply trust me when I tell you that this film will change your way of thinking, not to mention your way of feeling.  It's worth the buy.",996624000,,1836,5.016501650165017
1314227,4,B00003CXS9,"While you may find the story bleak going at times, the authentic period details and stunning homes of the time will keep your attention during the slower portions of this film. Gillian Anderson is surprisingly good in her role as Lily, a woman who is both naively unaware of the conventions and manners of the day as well as admirably independent in her own way. Unfortunately, Lily makes some mistakes which ""compromise"" her and set her course for life, a course that spirals steadily downward. What makes this movie particulary moving, to my mind, was watching Lily fall from a possible place in the upper classes, a place she was never sure she wanted in the first place. By the end of the movie, it is clear that she regrets her choice. A convincing portrait of a particular woman in a particular time, well-acted by Gillian Anderson. Strong supporting roles by Dan Ackroyd, Laura Linney, Eric Stoltz.",996624000,,905,4.770700636942675
1314228,4,B00003CXS9,"The symbolism in this film begins from the start: Lily arrives late and misses her train. As she said at one point, ""I always seem to do the right thing at the wrong time,"" to which her companion Laurence adds, ""Or vice versa."" Hers is a life of indecision, naivete, and bad timing. At the heart of the tragic story is the fact that neither she nor Laurence can fully commit to each other, despite their obvious but suppressed love. She cannot do so because she still is holding out for a richer suitor. His motives for not marrying her are more difficult to discern, but they seem to be a combination of emotional aloofness and concern about the slightly scandalous reputation she acquired from picking up gambling debts. All through the film she vascillates, missing opportunities to marry into great wealth but never taking the plunge with Laurence either.
Her poor gambling skills are also a metaphor for her life -- in both gambling and life Lily is against players much better than she is at getting and using money. She has come from humbler origins than the rich people she mostly hangs out with, and although she is much more charming and intelligent than most of them are, they have a ruthlessness that she lacks. Furthermore, most of them know what they want and are prepared to do whatever it takes to get it. By the time Lily tries to grab an opportunity, the train has left the station. Hence, the opening scene is quite appropriate.
Lily ignores some prudent advice that would have prevented her from unfairly losing her social reputation.  (She was already a little tarnished by her gambling, but a much worse scandal would surround her later.) After the scandal erupts, she effectively is banished from her social group and disowned by the wealthy aunt who financially has supported her, leading to a slow and tragic descent. This is the American dream turned into an American nightmare: the mirror image of rapid upward mobility.
Anderson gives a wonderful, charismatic performance as Lily. You may only know her from her affectless performances in the X-Files, but she reveals a sparkling charm in the House of Mirth. Other strong performances abound.
My complaint about the film is that it did not have the sort of emotional punch that it should have. It is sad story, but it's not the three-hanky film it should be.  Like all period, costume dramas, it can be a little stiff, and that can make it harder to feel the emotions that lie beneath the mostly genteel surface.  Still, it's a good film that is worth seeing.",996364800,,2537,4.70945945945946
1314229,4,B00003CXS9,"I saw this film two weeks ago and it has still got me thinking. While the notion of watching another adaptation of an Edith Wharton novel didn't initially excite me, I took the time out and it was definitely worth doing.
I won't go through the plot but the movie shows the downfall of Lily Bart played by Gillian Anderson, as she fails to take the chances offered her of marriage. Instead she bides her time, hoping a romance with the less than wealthy Laurence Selden will come to marriage. Anderson is a revelation, as she moves from manipulator to the manipulated, expecially at the hands of her so-called friend, played here with wicked aplomb by Laura Linney.
As with all Wharton novels, things do eventually turn pear-shaped for our Lily and we witness the long (perhaps a bit too long) tumble into poverty. Even at her lowest point Anderson gives Lily a certain radiance - we are frustrated by her plight and want to call out to help her but to no avail.
An underrated movie that deserves more exposure and certainly shows that Ms Anderson is not a one hit wonder.",996364800,,1071,4.55440414507772
1314230,3,B00003CXS9,"The three stars are for excellent performances (including one by the city of Glasgow, which very convincingly impersonates New York in 1905) and beautiful cinematography.  But if you haven't read the novel, it may be difficult to understand just what's going on.  A great deal of the action in Edith Wharton's novels happens inside her characters' heads.  Even the most sensitive and intelligent of her characters, like Lily Bart, have had all the gumption bred out of them by a suffocating society, and the plot depends mainly on their making bad choices at crucial moments.  Wharton can tell us what the character is thinking, and why she is always working at cross-purposes with herself, right up to and including the last thing she ever does, when she takes an overdose of sleeping medicine; she may intend to kill herself or she may not, Lily herself doesn't really know.
A movie simply can't tell you all that, it has to simplify and shorten the plot, and some characters have to be written out.  But did they have to sacrifice Gertie Farrish?  She's a wonderful character, a glimpse of hope for women in gilded age society, in that she has managed to build an independent life for herself, and to do something more worthwhile than sit around in drawing rooms serving tea.  When she's first mentioned, it's as a drap spinster whom Lily pities, but in the end, Gertie is Lily's only true friend, and this in spite of the fact that she knows they both love the same man.  Her generosity is quite a contrast to the society women who dump Lily for supposedly having an affair with a married man, even though they all know perfectly well that she's innocent.  At the end of her life, Lily gets a glimpse of redemption when she meets one of the poor women whom she and Gertie helped with their charitable work.  And why don't we get even a glimpse of Lily's parents, in at least a brief flashback?  It was Lily's mother who effectively wrecked her daughter's life, by bringing her up to accomplish one thing only, namely to marry rich, and win back her family's status after her father lost his fortune.  (The scheming mother in ""Titanic"" was the same stock type; she may even have been modeled on Wharton's character).

I picked up on a lot of self-pity and suffering but the story wasn't coherent or fluid.  Maybe it came out too long for a movie and the plot was lost on the cutting room floor?

None of the people in the movie even seem like people.  The are so stiff and unlifelike that zombies would come off well by comparsion.
The story itself is simply stupid.  No one would follow the actions taken by the main character unless they were insane.  And I think the produce may have been insane to even think about bringing this to the screen in this fashion.

1314333,5,B00003CXS9,"'The House of Mirth' is an outstanding film that for some reason was practically ignored by the press, the critics and the academy.  After you see it, you'll wonder why this is the case as well.
Director Terrence Davies manages to adequately capture the time period and the screenplay is perfectly in line with the Wharton novel.  Shot on location in Scotland, the architecture, breathtaking backgrounds and costuming adequately set the stage for a realistic and definitive period piece.
But it is the acting in this film that makes you sit up and take notice.  Eric Stoltz easily captures the troubled Selden Lawrence, torn between his true feelings and his well-known financial shortcomings. Dan Ackroyd plays the vile, manipulative Gus Trenor, who clearly has his own agenda. Laura Linney takes self-absorption to a whole new level as she gleefully sacrifices her loyal friend to save herself.  Anthony LaPaglia creates a character that is distasteful, boorish and somehow lovable as he desparately tries to convince Lily Bart to use the power that she possesses to pull herself up at the expense of another.
However, all are completely overshadowed by Gillian Anderson, who is nothing short of phenomenal in her portrayal of Lily Bart.  She manages to capture the true spirit of this tragic heroine, scene after scene.  Anderson expertly reveals every aspect of this character and clearly depicts the downfall of Lily Bart as she is transformed from the object of every man's desire (and every women's jealousy) into a tragic, desperate woman who is cruelly thrown into the scrap pile of society.  Anderson's performance is breathtaking as she weaves raw, yet subtle emotion into every word and action, taking the viewer along for the ride as Lily Bart makes tragic mistakes, takes the wrong advice and ultimately sacrifices herself for her own moral convictions.
If you've read the book, you simply have to see this film.  If you haven't read the Edith Wharton novel, you still have to see it.  Anderson's performance alone is worth it.  I highly recommend this film and I still can't understand why this film was not given the attention that it deserves.",992217600,,2160,5.025210084033613
1314334,3,B00003CXS9,"""The House of Mirth"" is a safisfying and pungent adaptation of Edith Wharton's novel about New York society, circa 1905.

But she lacks the necessary refinement, allure, beauty and conviction of a woman hoping to better her position by marrying old money. She is ill at ease. Her line delivery is stilted. It is only when Lily is expelled from society and forced into poverty that Anderson moves beyond her otherwise one-note perfornance.  Had Lily been played by Kristen Scott Thomas, Kate Winslow, Gwyneth Paltrow, Juliette Binoche, this film could have been so much better. But no. We're stuck with Anderson trying to put ""X-Files"" behind her. Aykroyd fares no better. As Gus Trenor, a wealthy businessman who offers to loan Lily money in exchange for sexual favors, the actor looks as if he's doing a bad Merchant-Ivory caricature for ""Saturday Night Live.""  What's right about the film is its pungent and playful attack of New York society. Wharton's disdain for upper class greed is suitably addressed by the filmmaker. So is the contempt she shared for silly women whose only goal in life was to attend parties, buy Paris fashions and vacation in the south of France.",992131200,,1360,4.934497816593886

Director Terence Davies sensitively directs a fine group of actors who portray the characters in Edith Wharton's most famous novel.  THE HOUSE OF MIRTH is an excellent art house presentation with the added allure of Gillian Anderson in the uncharacteristic role of Lily Bart-----a beautiful, vulnerable, but shortsighted woman who knows what she wants but is driven to pass up every opportunity for a ""brilliant"" marriage to a scion of New York society.  Miss Anderson's personality is a bit too modern for the role of Lily, but she does a commendable job in the part.  There is perhaps a bit too much of a feminist message in her comments on a woman's role in society.  We are, after all, seeing the events of a century ago, and judging the past by present day standards always gives the sense of belatedly condemning history.  But despite the cross-cutting of emotions, class and subtle sexism, the general theme of the story is that most people find out the truth about themselves and their milieu too late.
Eric Stoltz is remarkably affecting as Lawrence Seldom, a man who understands Lily, the world, but not himself.  The scene in the garden at the Trenor party where he and Lily almost declare their love for each other is one of the most memorable I've seen in years.
 Anthony LaPaglia as the social climbing businessman and Dan Aykroyd as the lustful Gus Trenor are right on the mark with their characters.  Terry Kinney as the weak-willed George Dorset has an understated intensity that few actors could successfully convey.  Laura Linney as his malicious and scheming wife Bertha turns in an excellent performance as the woman who dramatically delivers the coup de grace to Lily's social ambitions.
The standout for me, though, is Jodhi May who plays Grace Stepney.  Her face can show conflicting nuances of emotion that deeply affect the viewer.  Where has this actress been hiding?  There are scenes between her and other actors where she is saying one thing, yet conveying quite a different meaning to the audience through her facial expression that are positively heartbreaking.  One scene in particular has her turning Lily down for a desperately needed cash advance in the full knowledge that her denial will end in tragedy for Lily.  She denies her the money for supposedly moral reason, yet has tears of regret in her eyes because of the jealousy that is making her do it.  Portraying a conflict of emotions in a single character is a rare talent and Miss May's ability is magnificent.
Let's hope we see more of this very gifted actress and that her next role will be more prominent.  Hers is a performance not to be missed in a film of great emotional depth.

I have read and enjoyed the book upon which this movie is based. But, I must say, Lily is stilted and noticably ""acted"" as is the Lawrence character. The editing leaves much to be desired especially the long drawn out water and song number in the middle just prior to the yacht scenes. The only decent acting was done by Elizabeth McGovern and Dan Aykroyd. I would only recommend this movie for forced viewing in America's penal institutions.

She had me liking and hating the character at the same time. Some parts of the movie are a little dry and slow-going but on the overall it is well worth watching.  I think the fans of this wonderful actress agree that we want to see her in other movies that showcase her wide range of talent.  I'm sure that she looks forward to putting Scully behind her for a while to pursue other areas of interest more fully. I look forward to seeing her in a movie where she gets to smile a whole lot more :o)",991180800,,670,4.138461538461539
1314440,5,B00003CXS9,"When I saw the title I had to look it up. It means joyous laughter. It reminded me of a 20th century Greek tragedy. Yet it moved through Lily's life. You saw the transformation of what her mistakes did to her,tearing her down. An AWESOME performance by Gillian Anderson at pulling at the strings of emotion. The chemistry of Anderson and Stoltz was even more than that of her and Duchovny in the X-files. Anderson's remarkable acting has been hid from us because of the files. There is more hidden beneaththat with a good director behind her could come out. One day it will be the Oscar.",991180800,,587,4.4953271028037385
1314441,5,B00003CXS9,"For the vast majority of us, Gillian Anderson is indistinguishable as an actress from Secret Agent Scully.  Think of one, and you think of the other.  But THE HOUSE OF MIRTH is potent evidence that THE X-FILES might be more of a hindrance for Anderson at this stage in her career than a help.  Her performance in this film is nothing short of a revelation, marking her as one of the very finest actresses that we have today.  She needs and deserves more roles like this in the future; for her not to get them will be our loss as much as hers.
Apart from Gillian Anderson, everything about the film is solid and excellent, but the movie succeeds or fails as Ms. Anderson succeeds or fails.  Luckily, she is fabulous, and makes the movie.  One cannot help but feel her intense suffering, and the difficulty of her situation.  Both this film and THE AGE OF INNOCENCE)and even more so the Wharton novels upon which they are based) do a great job of making one feel the narrowness and hypocrisy of New York society at the turn of the previous century.  I will add that I did find Anderson's performance to be better than the rest of the film.  I would actually give the film as a whole 4 stars, but her performance elevates it to 5.
The supporting cast is quite excellent for the most part.  Laura Linney is appropriately reprehensible in her role, and Eric Stoltz as excellent as always.  I loved seeing Elizabeth McGovern in this one, and have always wondered why we don't see her in more films.  Anythony LaPaglia was excellent as Sim Rosedale, one of the more complex and interesting characters in the film.  Ironically, although through most of the film one of the more apparently coldhearted and calculating characters, he ends up being one of the few to take genuine concern with our heroine's plight.
Interesting bit of trivia:  anyone who has seen THE LAST OF THE MOHICANS will recall the very beautiful actress who played Madeleine Stowe's sister, who struck more than one reviewer as bearing a stunning resemblence to Botticelli's Venus.  In THE HOUSE OF MIRTH, as difficult as it may be to believe, the same actress, Johdi May, plays the somewhat homely and quite bitter Grace Stepney.",991094400,,2192,4.627906976744186
1314442,4,B00003CXS9,"For years I've been feeling deep respect and admiration towards Ms Anderson's acting talent (which, together with DD's, still manages to keep the half-dead X-files faking life). It is a pity and big loss to the movie industry that she's been chained to that TV-project for years and couldn't let her talent sparkle fully, until the House of Mirth. As you'll read about the contents of the movie above in the editorial review, I'd like to concentrate on Ms Anderson. First of all, she suits to the role perfectly, being the embodiment a woman of that time, 1907. The hats and dresses (which she changes a lot), the manners, the looks seem to be created for her. The way Lily Barth lights a cigarette, moves her fan, steps down into a cab are a delight to watch. Suffice to say tha ther acting is impecable and she herself seems to enjoy it immensely.
As to the story line of the movie, don't expect any nudity or action sequences: House of Mirth is even more slow-moving than Age of Innocence. The 100 years that elapsed since 1907 make the gap between public opinion and morals of that time and today evident: at the bottom of my heart I still can't understand why certain characters acted the way they did, those hollow facts that ""compromised"" Lily Barth in the eyes of that hypocritical and intrigue-spinning ""society"" make her tragedy for the modern viewer more palpable and incomprehensible. Lily herself is not only an innocent victim, she lives (at least the first half of the movie) in the stiff and artificial frames of the public morals, acts imprudently and hides her own feelings towards Lawrence (excellent performance by E Stolz). Their interplay creates special and rare moments of intimacy, otherwise alien to this bodice-tightened movie.
True, I fidgeted in my arm-chair many times and even yawned, but had to watch how all this ends. And the ending left tears in my eyes and made me give 4 stars to House of Mirth. I sincerely hope that G Andersen will finally unearth her talent and let it shine in many other genres, besides sci-fi.",987206400,,2052,4.7027777777777775
1314443,5,B00003CXS9,"I have been a long-time ""X-Files"" fan, so that was my principle reason for seeing ""The House of Mirth."" I actually, first, read the book, but found it painfully drawn out, and thus, became reluctant to see the movie. However, when I did see it, I was amazed! By the end of the film, I no longer thought of Gillian Anderson as the scientific Agent Scully, but I now saw her as the former-socialite, Lily Bart. The only thing that bothers me (both in the book and movie), is that there truly is no one to like, not even Lily herself. Upon viewing how each character hold themselves, one is repulsed. However, I believe that is the charm of this wonderful movie.",986601600,,659,4.409836065573771
1314444,5,B00003CXS9,"""I have tried hard, but life is difficult, and I am a very useless person.""
So opines the tragic Lily Bart (Gillian Anderson) in Terence Davies superb adaptation of Edith Wharton's blistering indictment of the vacuous, convention-constraining life of New York society in the early 20th century. Gillian Anderson is stunning as the waveringly unconfident Lily whose tenacious morality is unsuited to a world where insincere people idle away endless hours in gossip and back-stabbing. Her lack of ruthlessness causes her irrevocable downward slide over the course of the film's two years.
The beautiful Gillian Anderson, in her juiciest role to date, dominates the entire film, gracing virtually every scene. Her Lily is entirely believable, earnestly trying to follow the rules to support her plush lifestyle, by speaking with affected tones and mannerisms, and feigning a stiff upper lip during the many adversities she encounters. But she only follows the rules half way, and when the chickens come home to roost, her deep vulnerability leads to a heartbreaking catharsis. Anderson's performance is doubtless one of the best performances of 2000 (male or female), all the more amazing when one considers that she wasn't even rewarded with an Oscar nomination, the same slight that befell Bjork who was absolutely superb in Von Trier's Dancer in the Dark. What a pity.
Terence Davies' facile treatment of the material admirably maintains Wharton's restraint, faithful to the era. The audience, sensitized to the ""civility"" of the period, shudders when the emotional confrontations arrive -- confrontations based on mere insults or raised eyebrows which are no less powerful than had they been punctuated with the physical violence which accompanies modern day fare. Special mention should also be made of the gorgeous photography of Remi Adefarasin whose camera soaks up the Renoir-like beauty of the era at every turn. An altogether remarkable film.",985737600,,1950,5.355048859934853
1314445,5,B00003CXS9,"Gillian Anderson devastatingly captures the reality of a young  woman who makes life-altering mistakes in financial and class decisions. It is 1905 and Lily Bart is dependent upon her aging aunt for both financial support and class distinction. The only thing for a young woman of status to do in that era was to marry well. Love is not the issue, nor is compatability. Money is everything that is matched in value only by reputation. Lily's decisions trigger a downward spiral that forces her to discover the traumatic and horrifying effects of poverty. The viewer needs to remember that there were no soup kitchens, no salvation army, and no unemployment. The only help she could get were from family or friends. Gillian Anderson's portrayal of Lily and the evil she brings out in characters portrayed by Dan Aykroyd, Laura Linney, and others is haunting and frightfully real.",985478400,,878,4.9727891156462585
1314446,4,B00003CXS9,I thought that the screen adaptation of the House of Mirth was excellent.  Gillian Anderson does a fine job as the ill-fated Lily Bart.  Some of the other cast members i.e. Dan Akroyd do not seem to fit the timeline very well... but probably only because they have been type cast as comedic actors.  The majority of the films female roles were performed very astutely.  I would recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in biographies or period pieces... as long as you can forgive them their 20th century American accents.,983145600,,530,4.728260869565218

And, Gillian Anderson, Dan Akroyd, Terry Kinney, and Anthony La Paglia were horribly miscast.  Only Laura Linney and Eric Stolz were fit for their roles, and Linney just barely.

7918261,5,B00003CXS9,"The author Edith Wharton is writing about social norms dating from Jane Austins novels, to her time. I.e. the responsibility of a woman is to marry, and marry well. Lily Bart is a flawed, self destructive young woman. Until her aunt dies, she has little money of her own. Despite this, she has gambled and lost, so owes a great deal of money. She has several opportunities to marry well, but ruins every relationship. With each missed opportunity to marry, she sinks lower and lower socially, until forced to take demeaning employment, completely outside her former social circle. In one way she is a victim. But as much as I like both the book and movie, I have difficulty having sympathy for her, as she is the cause of her own self destruction.
