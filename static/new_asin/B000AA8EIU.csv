8077083,5,B000AA8EIU,"This Hong Kong superhero movie is in the same vein as classic Ultraman episodes.  It's a great deal of fun for fans of cheezy martial arts superheros, and is completely ridiculous.  The costumes are silly, the sound effects are over the top, and the dubbing is absolutely laughable, but that's what makes it fun.  Inframan is a really goofy name in and of itself (I expect they are making reference to Ultraman, but ""infra"" means ""below/beneath"").  The dialogue contains marvelous moments, and the translation is probably a bit too literal; case in point, the villain is translated as ""Princess Dragon Mom.""

Bottom line, if you like stuff like Ultraman and other tokusatsu shows/movies, don't pass this up.",1394496000,,707,5.0085470085470085
8077084,5,B000AA8EIU,"If you love Sci-Fi, martial arts and bad lip syncing this is the movie for you.  I saw this about 30 years ago and it still cracked me up the day I watched it.  My sons got a kick out of it too.

Great for getting the wife to leave the room on her own......",1391990400,,257,3.6363636363636362
8077085,1,B000AA8EIU,"This edition (Substance) is unspeakably bad. It is an obvious transfer from VHS or Beta, with an extremely soft picture and running colors, plus it's ""Pan and Scan"" with about half the picture chopped at the sides! There are two other versions available, the best being the ""Shaw Brothers"" edition of Super Inframan issued by Image. This one has Mandarin and English audio and is in its proper Panavision format. Next best is ""The Super Inframan"" from Red Sun. Avoid the ""Substance"" edition at all costs!",1378684800,,504,4.872093023255814
8077086,1,B000AA8EIU,For some reason the package purchased contained Inframan and Super Inframan which were basic takes of the same movie. Inframan's packageing was closer to what was expected but the product was substandard. Probably the vendor producing it didn't quality control prior to release. The dvd had flaws (scratches). I returned it the day after viewing it.,1369440000,,349,5.25
8077087,3,B000AA8EIU,"I bough inframan and super inframan (shaw brothers).

They are the same film but the shaw brothers reproduction was far superior and actually looked like a normal movie and not a copy from a vhs.",1360972800,2,195,4.571428571428571
8077088,4,B000AA8EIU,"I was in a flashback moment when I remembered when I was young and went to the movies with my parents because I saw the trailer of Inframan when it came out in the 70's. This was great stuff back then when you were a kid. I never seen this movie again since, so I looked it up at Amazon and there it was. I ordered it along with a other DVD of a childhood memory,Ultraman the complete series. And for a great price too, and got it two days before the estimated time. Anyway I watched Inframan and was not to happy over the video quality but I finally seen the movie that I have not seen since my childhood,and the other DVD set of Utraman was way better quality in video recording and cost less. so I did o.k. I would wait to find a better recording of Inframan. This one should of been better.",1334016000,3,794,4.063694267515924
