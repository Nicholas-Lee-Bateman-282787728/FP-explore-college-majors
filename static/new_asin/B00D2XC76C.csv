8588779,4,B00D2XC76C,"The story of 2 ""Eagle"" medics that served with the GREAT 101st Airborne Div. (THE single most ""bestest"" combat unit the world has EVER seen! The 82nd comes close.)
Thes 2 Eagles made their jump into Normandy on D-Day and tended the many wounded, both Allies and Germans! Because they did tend to German wounded German combat units left them alone. This was NOT the case theater wide. My own Dad was a medic w/ The 101st. This is a MUST for anyone interested in D-day or WWII in general!",1402272000,,486,4.411111111111111
