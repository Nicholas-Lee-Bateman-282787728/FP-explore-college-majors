Fortunately, the seller was quick to accept my request to return the DVD and acknowledged the issue about the 'fine print'.  They are working towards fixing this.  ...so five start merely because the seller seems to be one that can be trusted.

As for the video itself, I only saw a little of the Heidelberg chapter.  From what I saw, it highlighted all the main interest areas of that city.  Many 'snapshot' glimpses of places were places I had visited myself.  It is very unfortunate that this video is only in Chinese because I would have been very happy with it otherwise.",1355011200,,679,4.694915254237288
