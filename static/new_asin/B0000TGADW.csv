1943275,5,B0000TGADW,"Finally some quality footage. I knew it had to be out there some where.
Only one thing would have made it better, well maybe two things.
It would have been great if Steve could have done some kind of introduction at the beginning,
or better yet an INTERVIEW on DVD to go along with it.
I was hoping to see some ROR footage that I have only seen glimpses or photos of,
 with Steve was wearing blue tails and black & white tails.
But it's still an awesome DVD. In fact, I have bought 4 for gifts.
I hope there will more to follow.",1069718400,,528,4.076923076923077
1943276,5,B0000TGADW,"We can't thank you enough!  Finally, a DVD of the Classic Journey line-up.  I ordered mine before Amazon had even put ""Journey"" in the title, and received it a full week ahead of schedule.  I may have to get another as I am sure to wear this one OUT!
Made My Millenium!!!!  Thank you JDK & Steve Perry!!!!",1069718400,,305,4.206896551724138
1943277,5,B0000TGADW,"""...Sing jazz standards...""
Couldn't help but to notice your plea....FYI, Steve DID sing on a recent Jazz album that came out this past Aug. 5th - ""Soul Sessions"" by Jeff Golub.  Steve sings a ""guest"" vocal on track #8 - ""Can't Let You Go"" - note, tho, that this is a ""GUEST"" vocal; he sings sporadically throughout the song. But OHH MY!!  He sounds SOOO GOOD singing just FOUR WORDS than other ""singers"" do while singing ENTIRE SONGS!!
Highly recommend....haven't gotten the DVD yet, but I am SO SURE I will love it!!
Happy Listening ~ and Happy Thanksgiving To All!!",1069718400,,568,4.6138613861386135
1943278,5,B0000TGADW,"The quality of this DVD surpasses all my expectations. It sure beats watching all the blurry, scratchy, unmixed bootlegs that have been circulating over the years!
And while on one hand, it's disappointing that there is nothing ""new"" here, in the case of the lead singer, that's the best feature of the DVD!
I MISS STEVE PERRY! And Steve, if you're out there, reading reviews written by people who really matter (FANS), please come back in any incarnation. Sing the blues. Sing jazz standards. Yodel the phone book. I DON'T CARE! I want to hear -- and see -- you as you are TODAY!
As for wishing for something new.... There must have been an outtake, or an alternate version, or a snippet of an interview, or ANYTHING DIFFERENT that could have been tacked on to the end in an effort to throw a bone to those of us who have been watching those bloody bootlegs ad nauseum for two decades??? Please consider this for the next installment in this series.
I'm hopeful about this since I noticed something very encouraging in the cover art. There's a Roman numeral one underneath the scarab. To me, this means it's the first in a long line of Journey DVDs. YAY! I'm ready now to shell out my hard-earned cash to buy each and every one!
CATHERINE CHAPMAN
p.s. Only one sour note... Was anyone else bothered by this:  In ""Don't Stop Believin'"", why was ""...born and raised right here in Houston!"" taken out and ""...born and raised in South Detroit"" overdubbed??? Lousy decision!
p.p.s. I have absolutely nothing against Steve Augeri -- he's a lovely man with a lovely voice. Every interview I've seen him give has endeared him to me -- especially the story he told about being overjoyed that he was poised to get a raise and a pension plan at the Gap just before being whisked away by Schon & Cain! Is that a Cinderella story or what??? He's done a great job trying to fill shoes that are impossible to fill. I hope he abandons that notion and stands on his own merits. They're more than considerable.",1069718400,5,1993,4.5515320334261835
1943279,4,B0000TGADW,"First, I am a huge Journey fan.  I think the Escape and Frontiers albums are some of the best music I own and I will go weeks on end without taking a Journey CD out of my CD player.  Now, as for this DVD, I am glad to see some of the bootleg concert footage I have had for years finally get cleaned up and look good.  I think the DVD would have been better if this had been done in chronological order, but that is my opinion.  That way you could see the hair/clothes/music styles evlove over time (and see the product placement from when they promoted Budweiser).
I would have liked to know why they just do not release the whole Houston concert, or even the Tokyo concert from that same year out on DVD, I think they would each be big sellers.  As it is this is a great look at a wonderful band.  I love to watch the ""Seperate Ways"" video because it is so ""80's"", one of the best videos for that time (best to make fun of).
If you are a Journey fan, buy this DVD.  If you are a fan of drummer Steve Smith, but this DVD to see him (when they show him) playing live.",1069545600,43,1066,3.976525821596244
1943280,5,B0000TGADW,"Once upon a time long a go there was a band called JOURNEY. This group dazzled us with wonderful heartbreaking ballads and hard rock grooves. The group broke up at the end of the 80`s leaving fans wanting more...they re-surface in 1996 with another heart renching ballad (WHEN YOU LOVE A WOMAN)..This was the beginning of something good in a world gone mad. The euphoria was short lived, STEVE PERRY left the band. Leaving fans with an empty heart and fond memories of a glorious past. Now they have returned  with a new DVD filled with memories of a gentler time. This DVD is most have for any serious JOURNEY fan and collector. The sound quality and video is superb. This is where you will find the STEVE PERRY we all know and love. I would like to give a special thanks to STEVE PERRY, JOHN KALONDER and MICHEAL RUBENSTEIN for producing this master piece of JOURNEY videos.. THANK YOU FOR BRING BACK FOND MEMORIES AND GOOD TIMES.",1069459200,2,932,4.5476190476190474

1943336,5,B0000TGADW,"I actually wasn't a big Journey fan back in their heyday, since I found their music too soft, too pop for my taste.  But of course I heard their songs countless times on the radio and MTV, so they became implanted in me.  Now, with the perspective of decades more life experience, I find this DVD to be a lovely stroll down memory lane with a truly great band.

The songs are wonderfully crafted and prove that they stand the test of time.  The musicianship is top notch, and it's now clear that Neal Schon was a superb guitarist, always perfectly fitting his tone and playing to the songs, with solos that were never overplayed yet often built up to searing crescendos which showed that he had all the chops a guitarist could need.  Some may not know it, but Steve Smith went on to become a very accomplished drummer in the world of jazz-rock fusion, so he evidently wasn't fully able to stretch his legs in Journey but, like Schon, kudos to him for fitting his drumming to the music rather than overplaying.  And most of all, Steve Perry ... wow, that voice is straight from heaven, I can't say that anyone has ever surpassed it!

Given that these performances reach all the way back to four decades ago, of course this DVD is also of some historical interest.  The clothing can make us laugh, but it was what it was.  And lol, how can you not love some of those hairstyles, with Schon's afro so big at times that you'd wonder if he had white versus black identity confusion?

If you're a Journey fan, of course you need this.  If you don't think you're a Journey fan, maybe give this a try and discover that you're a bigger fan than you thought.

PS - I think Arnel Pineda is a superb singer in his own right and has done justice to Journey.  Not quite the voice of Steve Perry, but close enough, and the story of his journey to becoming part of Journey is wonderful and uplifting.",1454284800,,1884,4.363896848137536

I never understand how they don't have access to crystal clear masters when they put out DVDs. If i have clear copies, they should! Not saying the visual quality is horrible, its a B grade, but just so you know not to expect super clear videos. Otherwise its a great disk. it would be 5 stars, but like i said, i have copies i made from recordings years ago that are a bit clearer.",1415491200,,520,4.158415841584159

1943517,5,B0000TGADW,It just doesn't get any better folks.  Add the absolute hands down BEST voice in Rock (Steve Perry) together with one of the top pounding rock bands (Boston and the Chambers Brothers would be similar in terms of energy) and you've got a combination that absolutely needs to be preserved not only on CD but on DVD via their concerts.  This products delivers in all of the above.  Enjoy and remember one of the best ages of classic Hard Rock.  You'll never see this again.  Don't wait until these are discontinued and unable to be obtained again.  People who have these will NOT let them go.,1403308800,,589,4.509433962264151

1943539,5,B0000TGADW,"Love this DVD! Gave this to my aunt (with Downs Syndrome) several years ago and she loved it! She lost it so I ordered a new one because it is such a great DVD, it engages her in listening to music instead of watching TV all the time and she gets up to dance! The band members give a fantastic performance in every song, some songs are from music videos which is great. I rarely sit down in front of the TV to watch live concerts but I actually sat down to enjoy this myself. Journey is such a great band and even better live because Steve Perry puts so much enthusiasm into his singing, he is so passionate with his songs and you can tell. He runs around quite a lot but never shows any signs of fatigue in his singing. Wish Perry would have stayed with the band.",1387152000,7,764,4.1
1943540,3,B0000TGADW,"While I enjoyed the DVD, I was disappointed in the poor film quality or course I realize HE was not available at that time. I wished there were more variety of concert clips. It seems they were all from only two concerts and if they had been put in chronological order would be great. Even some interviews",1386806400,,305,4.368421052631579

1943554,5,B0000TGADW,"I bought this as little surpise gift for my wife as Journey was one of her favorite bands in high school and college. She never got to see them live and since Steve Perry is no longer with them doesn't have much interest in doing so now.

Picture was very, very good and sound was almost CD quality. I actually liked it better than I thought I would. I would have rather just had concert footage but the 'music videos' were not too bad. There were 3 or 4 songs I just didn't know as I was more of a causal Journey fan but my wife knew all but one of them.

I would rate this a very good 4.25 to 4.5 our of 10. Highly recommeded for Journey fans or fans of late 70's or early 80's music.

Hopefully Steve Perry will kiss and make-up with his former band mates before they all get too old to have a good-bye tour.",1382918400,6,811,3.993827160493827

1943584,5,B0000TGADW,"I play the greatest hits of  Journey for a concert at my home and I never get tired of it.  This shows live performances from many different venues and places and has a great variety - small group presentations which are ""cozy, intimate"" and then the very grand Tour presentations to huge crowds.  This group never disappoints me.  I actually really enjoyed going on the road trips with them...  My favorites are: Don't Stop Believin', Wheel in the Sky, Faithfully, Any Way You Want It, Who's Crying Now...  Well, all of them.  Steve Perry is the heart and soul of Journey, in my opinion. This package came with Street Talk - arrived on time, delivered in a package which protected them, and received with joy.",1366848000,,710,4.632

1943590,5,B0000TGADW,This is a great DVD. It has all of Journey's big hits. It's a combination or live videos and music videos. Steve Perry is doing his usual great job of getting the audience to sing along and he's looking like he's having fun doing what he does best. You can see how Neil tears up a guitar. Steve is looking great as always in these videos. He's nice on the eyes and his singing is at it's best. I think this a must have for all Steve Perry/Journey fans and anyone who loves rock and roll and song sung well.,1361664000,,506,4.07

I enjoyed the videos, which I had not seen in several years.  I also gained a greater appreciation for the rest of the Journey members.

I found myself dancing in my living room-could not sit still. The concert in Houston was the most fun, with them singing hit after hit, including ""Don't Stop Believin"", ""Any Way You Want It"" & ""Open Arms"", plus more. I do hope that Steve Perry has either recycled or retired the yellow animal print shirt that he wore for that concert. Overall, this a great entertainment for a small price.",1345248000,,541,4.645833333333333

1943631,5,B0000TGADW,I love this album. It brings back memories of when Steve Perry was in the band and how special his voice was. The videos in this DVD are so great and I thought they were amazing to see again. Steve is and was the heart of this band and they have ruined it by bringing someone in with the voice that is not comparable to THE VOICE as Steve was called.

Simply put, Journey is one of the greatest bands of the 70's and 80's, and would certainly be in my top 20 bands of all time. Their music is timeless and has a soulful, etheral quality that their main competitors in the arena rock format - Styx, Foreigner, Boston, and REO Speedwagon - never came close to matching.

However, one thing they ALSO share in common with those other bands...their videos for the most part stunk.  While artists like Duran Duran, Peter Gabriel, and Talking Heads were turning out classy, arty films to accompany their songs, Journey's clips were afterthoughts that more often than not just detracted from the song's power.  No better example of that exists than the much-maligned ""Separate Ways (Worlds Apart)"", which easily gets my vote for Worst Video Ever Made For An Otherwise Good Song. The whole air-guitar (and cringe-inducing air-keyboard) thing was just ill-conceived, and while I'm sure was intended to be humorous, I don't think they intended it to be the downright embarrassment it is.  ""After The Fall"" doesn't fare much better.  Journey certainly weren't shy about mugging for the camera with the most overwrought bad acting imaginable, and laying it on way too thick with the biggest I-am-so-getting-it-on-with-this-guitar-right-now faces they could muster. It just makes you weep.  The cheesy shots of them falling past the window outside doesn't do much to help the effort.

A good share of these aren't videos at all, but live clips from a 1981 concert.  Videos were never produced for the songs from ""Escape"", so ""Don't Stop Believin'"", ""Who's Crying Now"", ""Stone In Love"", and ""Open Arms"" all come from that.  For some reason, ""Any Way You Want It"" also comes from that show, even though a video was produced for that when the ""Departure"" album came out a year earlier.

And then there's the late 70's clips for songs like ""Lights"", ""Wheel In The Sky"", ""Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'"", etc.  They're all pretty much interchangable in their use of obnoxious lighting, costumes (including the popular Japanese robe period so many bands embraced during this time), dated special effects, and hair...gawd, the hair.  If Neal Schon's head had gotten anywhere near a hot lamp in the ""Wheel In The Sky"" video, there would've been a bright flash of light, and then a smouldering pile of ash with a guitar laying on top of it.

Beyond that, there's the fashion mishaps of the '86 tour when Jonathan Cain felt like he had to get a perm to match Neal Schon's while wearing clothing straight out of ""Joseph And The Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat"".  The high point of this era is when Cain steps forward to jam with Schon while playing his KEY-TAR...the ultimate in 80's instrumental cheese. ""Hi, I'm playing a keyboard strapped over my shoulder, so that makes me look like I'm holding a guitar, right?""  Ross Valory and Steve Smith managed to escape (no pun intended) this travesty, as they had been ejected from the band.  The bass player for these videos is Randy Jackson of ""American Idol"", who apparently was performing a silent tribute to Larry Blackmon of Cameo during this period, and geez, dude...there's a certain weight threshold where one should not wear spandex, and you've clearly passed it.

Oddly, two concept videos that did get a lot of airplay on MTV aren't included here. ""Chain Reaction"" suffered from the same hammed-up acting as the other ""Frontiers"" videos, but it at least had an obviously respectable production budget and therefore would've been more interesting to have than yet another cable-access-worthy video like ""Just The Same Way"". Also missing is ""Why Can't This Night Go On Forever"", another ""life on the road"" video, but this one extols the positives of the touring life (meeting fans, playing on stage, etc.) instead of the loneliness and isolation conveyed in ""Faithfully"". Nothing especially groundbreaking about it, but again...still more interesting to watch than yet another live or performance video.

Overall, this DVD is amusing for the way it embraces the worst of 80's fashion and art, but you just think about how with a few better selections in directors, and perhaps not relying so much on live clips from the ""Raised On Radio"" album, they could've been respectable video artists.  Truly, just the opposite is the case.",1313712000,,4399,4.976807639836289

The music became their babies and like Steve said, ""He set them free, they either make it or they fall.""(meaning the song they wrote) Something like that anyway. Music is this mans life and he gave up everything and we should honor him.

I saw Journey perform with Def Leppard with Jeff Scott Soto at the helm. He also did a good job. I will get the new dvd/cds sooner than later with Arnel Pineda/Revelation. But Perry is still the one, and it will never be the same in Journey without him. Just like Van Halen is not the same without Roth(Saw them twice this year), same holds true for Journey.

I never would have given them a peek back then if I never heard their music. They are one good looking group of guys!  Steve Perry is so rockilicious.  I always thought they were hotties in the 80s but I just think they look sooooo much slicker in their 70's getups. Steve Perry, N. Schon, R. Vallory, S. Smith, A. Dunbar, G. Rolie, J. Cain and the later additions all looked hot and sounded hot (Yeah even Randy ""stretchpants"" Jackson).  There is not a group around with their sound, looks and talent.

I LOVE this DVD!!! :D Being a Journey fan since 1982, watching these videos brought back a lot of memories.  Steve Perry is not only the best male rock singer around (and to this day in my opinion), but he was a hottie (and still looking good at age 57). Watch ""Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin'"" and you will see what I mean. *sigh* :)

Yes, some of the videos are cheesy (""Seperate Ways"", ""After The Fall""), but nonetheless, the videos are still entertaining to watch, and makes you think of the early days of MTV, before all the rap-crap-reality-shows sleeze that now characterizes the channel.

A real treat are the Infinity-era videos, ""Feelin' That Way"" and ""Lights"", videos that I have never seen before, and was delighted to see included on the DVD.

My only gripe is that the videos for ""Chain Reaction"" and ""Any Way You Want It"" (the perfomance clip from 1980, not the live version from the Escape Tour) have been omitted.  This DVD would have gotten 5 stars had these two videos been included. Perhaps, one day the band will have another DVD with Steve Perry released that will include these two videos.",1157500800,6,1148,4.602941176470588

I was never a huge Journey fan in the day, although Steve Perry's voice melted my soul the first time I heard it. Now I could kick myself for missing several chances to attend one of their concerts. Until recently I never the knew the history of the band or the reason for Mr. Perry's departure. If the Universe is listening, please, please, heal the past so we can see the REAL Journey members reunite. NO ONE can replace Steve Perry. That would be the concert of the century!!!!

In the meantime I will relish this video as well as the 1981 Live Escape Tour while holding out hope they will once share the stage again.",1148083200,61,732,4.297101449275362

1943717,4,B0000TGADW,"I was born in 1979, so I never got to see Journey/Steve Perry live (would love to, though, if it ever happens!). But I grew up listening to their music and to this day I love it. Nothing beats cranking Journey in the car after a long day at the office.

Yes, the ""Separate Ways"" video is howlingly bad and takes away from a fantastic song. The Houston concert videos are my favorite: full of raw energy and inspired showmanship. I believe this was Jonathan Cain's first tour with the band and his enthusiasm shows! Next favorite would be the Infinity videos with Gregg Rollie, master of the B3 and no slouch as a vocalist himself!!

It's also a lot of fun watching Neal Schon (as far as guitarists go, he should be ranked up there with Eddie Van Halen, Brian May, etc.) crank out scorching solos, as well as seeing his hair evolve from a nearly screen-filling fro to total '80s jeri curl.

Steve Perry...what can I say! He's probably my all-time favorite male vocalist. Who can sing ""Send Her My Love"", ""Open Arms"" and ""Faithfully"" like him?? I melt everytime I hear those songs. A reviewer earlier mentioned his extremely tight pants...that's one reason why I love to watch this DVD so much!! ;-) Speaking as a 26-year-old woman, the man was a total babe!! The Evolution videos with the spandex and the unbuttoned shirt...sigh...

Speaking of spandex, get a load of AI's Randy Jackson from the 1986 videos! Spandex, flattop and a pink polka dotted bass guitar. Like many things from the '80s, you have to see it to believe it!

I do have to admit I am disappointed the Evolution videos' original vocal tracks are lost...it takes a bit away from a concert video with the studio recordings dubbed in...oh well. Also, I would have liked to see the videos in chronological order. I loved the visual style and class of ""When You Love A Woman""...a song that came out when *I* was in high school!

1943719,5,B0000TGADW,"Start believing it cuz its true, this DVD is NASTY! I mean good. This thing just starts off right with a live performance of DONT STOP BELIEVING from 1981. Steve Perry looks a little gay in this first clip, but it doesn't matter, cuz it's awesome. Next we go back to 1978 for a live/video of WHEEL IN THE SKY. This is even better than the first, this shows us a rock band in full form. Next is an early music video for FAITHFULLY... whoa, the plot to this video just touches your heart. The band on the road, missing their sweethearts; Steve Perry wondering why in the HELL he's got a mustache. Yeah.

The live version of ANYWAY YOU WANT IT, is a little to weak but sit tight because what follows that is most definately the most AWESOME music video EVER! YES! I SAID EVER! Of course I am talking about the 1983 music video for the song SEPERATE WAYS (WORLDS APART). This video is pure genius, and is absolutely amazing.. right from the start.. when the whole band is just rocking out with no instruments in front of a wharehouse. The ""air"" keyboard is my favorite because Jonathan Cayne has this really intense look on his face while he's banging on keys that aren't really there, and then POOF, theres a real keyboard in front of him and he's like ""WOAH"" real quick, and then he just goes right back to intensely ROCKING out. The whole video takes place on a wharf in front of various wharehouses, while the band follow this chicky around, who has obviously been damaged by love, and sing right in her face, sometimes two or three at a time, ""someday love will find YOU...."" Sometimes they even get right into YOUR face and sing it. The degree to which they ROCK out in this video though is incredible. Wicked bad ass! If I ever get a music video on MTV I'm going to completely mimic this one.

Well, ok, thats basically the peak of the DVD real early on. SEPERATE WAYS though is worth at least ten stars. The rest of this thing still continues to rule though, just can't possibly compare to the one video. Next in the lineup is a live LIGHTS which is a song that I really sort of hate, but more goods follow. A couple live performances from 1986 feature American Idols RANDY JACKSON playing bass, only here he looks sort of like May Day from A View To Kill. He really rocks out hard too though. It must have been something about this band. They were seriously on that stage to one thing.... rock BAD ASS!

1943728,4,B0000TGADW,"One thing I've often wondered about video compilations in any format is: why do we need opening titles, captions and closing credits? Records contain just music and include all the additional information on the cover, so why don't videos do the same? In other words, records are not produced like radio shows, so why are videos produced like TV shows? In the case of DVDs, it's even easier to include credits as part of the menu. Well, this Journey compilation uses the ""record"" concept. Once you choose the ""play all"" option, all you will see is the videos in sequence with no obtrusive captions to tell you either what you already know or what you can read on the back of the DVD box. Initially it may look amateurish, but I like it that way. As for the videos themselves, they are exactly what a Journey fan will expect, a nice mix of live performances and promo videos from the Steve Perry years. Maybe they could have released the live concerts in their entirety or included more live cuts instead of the videos, but this DVD works fine as a good Journey compilation for one's eyes and ears.",1110499200,,1096,4.540404040404041

1943730,3,B0000TGADW,"This visual document of Journey during 1978-1997 is worth buying simply for the live cuts taken from the band's 1981 concert at Houston in Texas during the Escape tour, when they were really rocking.

Steve Perry is in fine voice on all the tracks from that gig, proving what an outstanding vocalist he is, whether in the studio or in concert. Check out ""Open Arms"" or ""Who's Crying Now"" to find out just how good the classic line up oif this band was on stage.

The live tracks from Journey's Raised On Radio tour of 1986 are good too, but the videos aren't too great, except for ""When You Love A Woman"", a terrific video from ""Trial By Fire"", the band's last album with Steve Perry. Beautiful visuals and great production values on this one.

The rest of the videos appear rather dated, though Steve Perry has to be one of the best and most emotional lip syncers in the business!!

Audio is simple two-channel, with no remixing or remastering for surround, and thus a bit disappointing and one of the reasons why this DVD only rates three stars. But the sound is smooth and the DVD sounds great when played live. Also disappointing is the lack of any bonus features.

It would be nice if Journey would now release the entire Houston concert on DVD with surround sound, or maybe one of the shows from the 1986 tour.

And as for all the critics who keep bad-mouthing Journey, ignore them. The catchy songs and the terrific playing just can't be put down for ever....",1105488000,16,1466,4.513207547169811

When I bought the DVD I really didn't know much about JOURNEY but I'll tell you, after searching on over 2000 songs of the 80's I could not find a better singer than Steve Perry. I am not talking about his vocal skills only but about his extremely good taste choosing how to interpretate and performe those excellent songs.

I have only one complaint: If this is a ""Greatest Hits"" package, why not include ALL of their official videos? I am specifically reffering to ""Chain Reaction"", off of the ""Fronteirs"" album. All of that album's hits (from ""Separate Ways"" to ""Faithfully"") are included except the above mentioned song. I recall watching the video on MTV and it actually had some heavy rotation.

  I went out and bought a Greatest Hits album. It, to this day, is the most listened-to album of my collection. I wasn't put off by the sometimes sappy lyrics and stereotypical '80s, new wave keyboarding. I was entranced by Steve Perry's exceptional voice and the band's incredible song-writing talents.
 Once you get past the 'wardrobe malfunctions' which are only to be blamed on the '80s, you will find that Journey was a great band for the era they were in. They played great music, had an excellent lead singer, and their ballads were great love songs.  In fact, my favorite Journey song, ""When You Love a Woman"", was actually recorded in 1996 during the band's short reunion. In the video, we see a hippie-haired Steve not looking much older and still showing the passion he attained so long ago.
  The other videos, though sometimes sprinkled with 'the cheese-factor' are great fun to watch. Steve, Neal, Jonathan, Ross, and Steve Smith (the Escape era band) truly look like they're having a blast, and that's what makes this DVD wonderful.

I do find it interesting (and disgusting) that several reviewers
wouldn't care to see pre-S. Perry material on the DVD. What a
joke!! You people are obviously not true fans of the group. If
you really think you are a FAN of this group, try putting on the CD ""Look into the Future"" (have you even heard of it?). It's worth having for the title cut alone. Gregg in all his glory on
vocals and keyboards, the immortal Aynsley Dunbar on drums (the
best drummer Journey ever had), not to mention the most emotional and expressive guitar solo ever by Neal Schon. To dismiss early Journey is like saying that the early Beatles sucked. Real smart!! I'm a Steve Perry fan, I loved the Raised
on Radio period, I guess I'm actually a real fan of the group.
If you like Perry that much, just listen to his weak solo stuff.
For the true Journey fans, don't listen to those losers. Go out
and get some early Journey, they made 3 albums before Perry even
was in the group. ""Journey"", ""Nexus"", and ""Look into the Future"".
Check out Gregg Rolie on lead vocals, fresh from Santana. Amazing music!!!!! I gave this DVD 4 stars due to the lack of
early material. Hopefully there is some old footage out there

awesome!!!!!!!!",1088294400,3,1394,4.470588235294118

1943760,5,B0000TGADW,"I was so excited when Steve Perry announced that he and John Kalonder were working on a DVD of Journey video's. The first day it was released I ran to my local Border's store where they only had three left on the shelf.
The first thing that struck me immediately was how ALL of the band members between 1978 & 1997--the dates clearly shown on the cover--were awknowledged. I thought that was very nice to recognize everyone who played in Journey during those years.
Playing the DVD I was amazed at the video and sound production....the video is crystal clear digitally remastered and the sound is amazing!!
The mix of videos is really good....going back and forth between the live performances where Journey really shined to the glory days of MTV.....some of you might remember those days....that's when MTV actually showed MUSIC VIDEOS!!!
The songs are the soundtracks to our lives. ""Don't Stop Believing,"" ""Open Arms,"" ""Wheel in the Sky..."" all the greats are here.
And the there is the last video they did togather...their only Grammy nomination...the beautiful ""When You Love a Woman...""
I almost want to cry everytime I see it.
I noticed some reviews questioning  why certain performances weren't included and I would remind them that there is another DVD in the works! If anything this video left me waiting for more!!
Some have commented on being dissappointed that material prior to Steve Perry's arrival wasn't included on here. I'd remind them that the dvd specifies the years that Perry was in the band. I also have no interest in the band prior to those years and wouldn't care to see any of that work included. They were just a jam band before he arrived....he's the one who put them on the map and made Journey a household name.
While I wish the current incarnation of Journey all the luck in the world (they certainly need it with the rodeo's they've been playing lately) the fact remains that when Journey lost Steve Perry they lost their voice. He was THE VOICE and always will be.
For us Steve Perry fans this video is essential. And despite the little promotion for this DVD it still went PLATNUM within a matter of months....a clear sign how much Steve Perry and his voice are missed.

To alot of Journey fans like myself, this is an awesome package to get all of Journey's videos, some never seen before on MTV. Many of the live cuts are the actual clips that were shown on MTV back in the day when MTV was a music video channel. Thank God for VH1's new digital channel ""VH1 Classic"" They have shown some of the lesser seen videos like ""Just The Same Way"". I wondered, why don't they put out a collection of these cool videos...whata ya know! Here it is! Sounding great too. This really makes you crave the original Journey line-up. The first time I saw Journey live was the ""Evolution"" tour and was lucky enough to get back stage passes and meet the guys. This was Journey at their most magical in my opinion.
  They went on to replace Greg Rollie for Johnathan Cain who changed the feel to a more radio friendly ""Journey"". Not that that was bad, it was part of the ""evolution"". To me though, Steve Perry is the most missing in today's line-up. I have all their CD's right up to the last ep ""Red 13"" which isn't bad but isn't like the ole Journey.
  Fans of Journey will love this DVD! They took the time to make this collection look and sound great! Flashback to a better time in music and ""Don Stop Believin'""!",1076544000,5,1359,4.296875
1943764,4,B0000TGADW,"I saw Journey live back in the 80's and was blown away by how much energy they had live. The songs sounded even better than the studio version because the band fed off the energy of the crowd. The concert footage in this DVD gives a glimpse into what it was like to experience Journey live.
However, as others have said, the DVD intermixes concert footage with studio videos.  The latter pale in comparison to the former. The band's earlier videos, such as ""Lights"" and ""Same Way You Love Me"" pre-date MTV; they aren't so bad because it's just the band lip-synching to an empty audience. The music is fine and it's a treat to see Gregg Rolie, but the energy and interplay with the audience are noticeably absent. Seeing Schon with his three foot afro and Perry with pants so tight (how can I put this delicately?) that you can tell on which side the gentleman dresses...is great for longtime fans, but won't do anything to attract new ones.

And then we have the wincingly bad early MTV videos such as ""Separate Ways.""  In its best execution a music video enhances the music; Journey's videos detracted from it.  I skipped these amateurish attempts altogether, with relief that Perry mercifully chose not to include the video depicting him and Schon dueling over a mannequin. :)
In any event, I give this DVD 4 stars because I love the concert footage. I'd also like to send a clear signal of support to the music industry that I appreciate, and will buy, these types of DVDs.  Since Steve Perry helped produce this DVD, I'd also like to send a message to him that his charismatic presence and unsurpassed vocals are sorely missed in this age of style over substance.",1075939200,7,1667,4.5993265993265995
1943765,3,B0000TGADW,"Unlike Michael Jackson, Peter Gabriel and other more image-conscious artists, Journey was definitely NOT a vanguard music video act.  Live performance was always Journey's forte, so I'm disappointed that the band's lame and embarrassing music videos are compiled here along with excellent live footage. As expected, the best videos here feature the band lip-syncing or performing.  The more interpretive, conceptual stuff is unwatchable.
Writing as a fan, I would have prefered that Journey's music videos be featured on a separate DVD. I suggest that Sony Music / Columbia Records follow Led Zeppelin's lead and release a Journey DVD box set featuring entirely live performance footage. Such a set should include Journey's amazing 1978 PBS ""Soundstage"" appearance, their 1978 Midnight Special performances, and the band's 1980 appearance on the sketch comedy show ""Fridays,"" among others.  The set could also feature entire concerts from each of the band's tours with Perry.
As evidenced by the many positive customer reviews here, there still exists a voracious market for Journey memorabilia. Indeed, this DVD compilation hasn't even been heavily promoted, yet the band's many loyal fans have discovered its existence. That's because Journey hearkens back to a time when record buyers were most impressed by enduring qualities such as songs and musical ability. The band probably didn't put much thought into their music videos because they felt it was a waste of their formidable talent.  I mean, who needs music videos when you sing like Steve Perry, play guitar like Neal Schon and lay down the foundation as expertly as Greg Rolie, Jonathan Cain, Ross Valory, Aynsley Dunbar and Steve Smith? Who needs the vacuous glamour of videos when you compose pop songs as catchy and enduring as ""Lights,"" ""Feeling That Way,"" ""Lovin', Touchin', Squeezin',"" ""Don't Stop Believin'"" and countless others?
I strongly believe that a comprehensive Journey DVD box set would take the industry by surprise, just as Zeppelin's 2003 live DVD compilation generated impressive sales. If you're a Journey fan and you agree that the band's live performances should be preserved on DVD, let your voice be heard here. Show Sony Music that a live DVD set would prove profitable.  Because as far as I'm concerned, this mix of superb live clips and dubious music videos only whets my appetite for more concert footage.",1075420800,6,2395,5.2591623036649215
1943786,4,B0000TGADW,"As a longtime fan who only recently became a hardcore fanatic, I can say that this DVD is a true must-have for all Journey fans.  It covers all of the years that Steve Perry was with the band.  The music is always excellent, and the video quality the same.  It's great to see the fashion, too... especially on Steve Perry, who wore some interesting getups.  My main disappointment is that the studio version of Any Way You Want It was omitted in favor of a live Escape version.  Other than that, I watch this DVD all the time and I love it!  You may think they're cheese, but Journey rocks.  Give this DVD a chance.",1074816000,2,615,4.2956521739130435
1943787,5,B0000TGADW,"I don't usually buy music DVDs without reading some reviews, so for me to purchase JOURNEY: GREATEST HITS 1978-1997 is an anomaly.  What pushed my ""buy button"" was the number of ""live"" period songs on the DVD.  It's always great to see a band playing their stuff WHEN they were ""the"" stuff, you know?  And this DVD is a great ride for that purpose alone.
I must confess I had NEVER seen the ""Separate Ways"" video (don't know how that happened!), but it IS pure corn and cheese.  For hardcore Journey fans that won't matter.  For the rest of us it's only a reminder about how sad some music vids were in the early 80s.  Still, it's a slice of music history worth remembering just so we don't repeat it.
All said and done, you won't be disappointed in this DVD.  I'm not.",1074556800,,769,4.335664335664336
1943788,5,B0000TGADW,"If you are, as I am, a great fan of Journey, this is a must have for any collector.  Unfortunately, I was never able to see Journey Live, although I still hold out the hope that they will get back together with the original line up, and I will be the first one in line for tickets.  So this DVD is a great substitute for the real thing!!!  It is also amazing to see how the band changed over the years, but their music still remained strong and poignant.  Steve Perry is one of the great voices of music and Neal Schon compliments everything he does.
A MUST HAVE!!!!!!!",1074211200,,569,4.192660550458716
1943789,5,B0000TGADW,"Finally a video compliation of one of the Best bands around...Journey. It it great to look back on some of these videos with one of the best lead singers in the business. BUT it is almost unforgivable of what Steve Perry nearly did to this wonderful band. (go to [...] for an interview with Herbie Herbert the founding manager of the band for the Truth of Steve Perry- its a must read for any true Journey fan.)Now we have a new lead singer Steve Augeri who is just as capable of leading this great band and i cannot wait for their new album to be released. I have been a fan of thiers since 1979 and my first concert of theirs was in 1983 in Philadelphia were Send Her my Love was taped- and it was just incredible. So this video is a great look back upon their wonderful success but Steve Perry is gone and won't be back...so let us Look in to the Future with Steve Augeri and the band because the Journey Continues on and on and on....and what a bright future it seems to be for such a deserving band. If you haven't seen them See them now for they are even better than the old line up, and Pick up ARRIVAL thier best album in years. Dont Stop Beliven!!!",1073779200,,1157,4.169642857142857

1943792,5,B0000TGADW,"When I found out about the new release of Journey's DVD...... I was thrilled and ordered it right away!  Made myself a x-mas present.  I have been waiting for this along time! Any work from Steve P!  As a fan of old Journey/Steve Perry(since 1978) I am excited about the dvd. This is what fans  were waiting for. Thank you Steve Perry, JDK, and others for the collaboration of the release. JDK says on his web site that there will be other releases soon......what a way to start 2004! Steve you are greatly missed by me and many of your faithful fans around the country and the world! You are ""THE VOICE""! KEEP THEM COMING! AND THANXS FOR MAKING YOUR FANS HAPPY !
 YOUR VOICE IS GREATLY MISSED...THERE IS SILENCE IN THIS CRAZY WORLD WITH OUT YOUR VOICE!!!!!! PERRYON!!!!!!!
P.S. JDK was asked if Perry would release his solo videos......said he would talk to him re: this.......so what if there were only a few!!!!!! We the fans would buy it!!!!!!!!!!",1072915200,3,951,4.570588235294117

1943794,3,B0000TGADW,"Journey was my ultimate favorite group back in the day !!!  Saw them quite a few times in Hartford (two of them being in the front row )
Great DVD - however I was hoping for more than just ""the videos""
I like to see some ""extras"" on DVD releases.  Interviews, The Making of....and so on.  It also like to see english subtitles with music available as well.  This DVD does not include any extras - however the videos and concert footage is absolutely great.  Again - it is good to see them again.  It brought many many memories of watching MTV wating for a new Journey video  back to me like it was yesterday.
ONE REQUEST - PLEASE RELEASE FULL CONCERT FOOTAGE OF JOURNEY WITH STEVE PERRY ON DVD.  I believe that they taped the Frontiers tour for VHS? - however would love to have that on DVD.
Thank you !!",1072656000,,804,4.243421052631579

1943797,5,B0000TGADW,Wow!  I was in the video store and saw this DVD and immediately bought it!  I hope Journey will decide to release the full version of the Escape Tour concert which they highlight on this greatest hits DVD.  I have a old VHS copy of the entire concert and it was great to see it cleaned up.  It was a great selection of songs and sounds great!  It really shows what a showman Steve Perry is!,1070668800,3,390,4.078947368421052

Great to see the videos anyway!",1070496000,,153,4.241379310344827
1943799,5,B0000TGADW,"This DVD absolutely ROCKS.  Like others have said, the quality of the video and audio simply blows away anything you may have taped on VHS.  It embraces Journey's rich history, including tracks from Infinity through Trial By Fire, really doing justice to their greatest hits with some killer live performances.  This labor of love embodies everything I always loved about Journey, and I'm proud to own it.
If you loved Journey or Steve Perry - or never got to see the boys live, don't wait.  Buy it now.  You'll be glad you did.",1070064000,3,528,4.634408602150538

Who better to produce it than the man who is ""The Voice"" of Journey. The re-mastering and clarity and sound of the DVD is awesome! I have most of these old videos on VHS and I can tell you this, they look much better on DVD than on my old VHS tapes! If you are a Journey fan, you must have this DVD!! I hope Sony will release the other Journey concert DVDs soon!",1069891200,,525,3.952830188679245

Steve Perry's glorious vocals blow me away every time, but this is a great showcase for a very under-rated band. Yes, there are tracks we might wish were on here too (""Chain Reaction"", ""Why Can't This Night Go On Forever"") but with so many of their classic hits represented, it would be churlish to complain.
