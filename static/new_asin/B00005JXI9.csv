1610682,5,B00005JXI9,"I bought this movie b/c I'm a huge fan of great Westerns.  Also a fan of Tom Selleck esp. when he starred in Magnum P.I. back in the day.  This movie is just the way I like it...a fast paced, action-packed thriller; similar to being a page-turner in a very good book.  Christian Kane, Wilford Brimley, Scottish actor David O'Hara and Virginia Madsen were magnificent in their respective roles.  As was Mark Harmon playing the bad guy and gets killed in the end.  In 2000, I videotaped a movie called Love Song with Christian Kane, Monica & Essence Atkins, remembering his performance in that.  Will be watching this movie as often as I my schedule will permit.  Very enjoyable, loved it!",1509840000,,687,4.628099173553719

It has it all.  But this understated, and totally under appreciated film IS a winner.  It deserves much more recognition than it has received.  Some classic lines.  Classic minimal dialogue from the hero...Tom Selleck:  ""Day's not over yet!""
Solid supporting cast:  Mark Harmon in an unusual bad guy role; Virginia Madsen, as the skeptical--at first widow; and Wilford Brimley as the dependable partner.  All shine in their roles.

1611273,4,B00005JXI9,"Louis LAmours Crossfire Trail (2001)

 Tom Selleck had a mini-career with made for TV westerns.  Named Louis LAmours Crossfire Trail for some reason that escapes me, this one ranks up at the top of these quickly made films.  I am not alone in liking Crossfire Trail.  Writer Charles Robert Carner won the Bronze Wrangler award for his teleplay for the TV movie.  Carner is perhaps better known for writing the script for Witless Protection, Blind Fury and the iconic Vanishing Point.
 The director also has a long history of film making to his credit.  Australian born veteran film maker Simon Wincer put together a solid, traditional Western which we enjoyed watching, never mind the flaws.  Of his many movies fans will remember most fondly The Light Horseman and Quigley Down Under.  Quigley also starred Tom Selleck.
 Wincer assembled a very strong cast which for me makes the film.  Virginia Masen plays the female lead.  The beautiful actress has made dozens of films including Sideways, one of my favorite films.  A woman with strong abilities on screen, she convincingly portrays the frightened widow, alone in a dangerous land.
 In the story, Selleck and two friends, Shanghaied on a ship out of San Francisco, are befriended by a man who is murdered by the ships captain.  The trio vow to take care of the dead mans ranch and wife in Wyoming.  Skullduggery, double dealing and murder abound in a classic Western tale of honor and revenge.
 Also featured are Wilford Brimley, Christian Kane (now appearing in TVs The Librarian), Berry Corbin, Rex Linn, William Sanderson (Blade Runner), and Mark Harmon as the smooth talking sociopath who runs the little western town.  Even in a made for TV movie it helps to have good actors in their places.
 Cinematographer David Egghy (Pitch Black, Mad Max) takes full advantage of the landscape around Calgary, Alberta to produce some of the beautiful film scapes that we relish in a good Western.  Gorgeous.
 They may have pushed the film making too quickly or maybe stuffing the story into a 95 minute long frame caused the avoidable flaws but they are still there.  When the heroes leave a woman with a broken leg in the middle of fixing her up or when the new guy in town stalks out of the bar without paying, we notice, it jars our sense of the flow of things.
 Still, the classic western deserves a solid, if not spectacular, three saw blades and remains a good entertainment value.  This was the highest watched made for TV movie at its debut.",1438646400,,2498,4.766899766899767

1611323,5,B00005JXI9,"One of my favorite western story tellers has been Louis LAmour.  I just finished seeing the movie (Crossfire Trail) and loved it.  I am surprised I had missed this movie over the years.  The story is simple but there is certain beauty in traditional western stories.  In this film (Crossfire Trail with Tom Selleck, Virginia Madsen, Wilford Brimley and Brad Johnson) there is the perfect combination in a story about corruption, murder, friendship and promises made and promises kept.
 Rafe Caradec (Tom Selleck) is a tough independent minded cowboy, and a loyal friend.  His good friend, Charles Rodney had been beaten up by the Captain of the ship and was dying.  Before dying Charles made Rafe promise that he would make sure to look after Charlies wife, Ann Rodney (played by Virginia Madsen) and their ranch in Painted Rock, Wyoming.  Rafe, being a man of honor swore he would make sure the ranch and his wife Ann would be protected by him.

In any good western movie there has to be conflict and a battle between good and evil.  In this case the ruthless and corrupt Bruce Barrow (Brad Johnson) is the towns big shot in Painted Rock and has enough thugs to keep everyone in line. He has his eye not only on the ranch, but also on Ann.  When Rafe gets to Painted Rock and tells Ann about her husband dying in his arms six weeks ago, she at first does not believe him.  Wilford Brimley is also great in this movie as an old tough cowboy who ends up as one of Rafes new friends.

I never like to give away too much in any movie because it spoils it for anyone else who wants to see the film; however, you can be sure that this action western has plenty of character development in the form of bad guys, good guys and a great shoot-out at the end.  What I like about the character in Rafe is his dedication to principles and that he is a man who keeps a promise he made to his friend.  For those who have read the book, (as I have)  you will notice there is a little different tale but the plot and basic story line is the same.

If you like watching traditional western movies you should check out this excellent DVD.

In any event the plot, although well-used, is always good to see again when other actors use it.
It is 1880, and Selleck promises a dying man that he will take care of his ranch and his wife. Selleck goes to the ranch and finds that it is run down. He also discovers that another man, the villain, wants both items and has hired gunman to help him get it.  He owns the mortgage on the property and is doing all he can to force the widow to sell the ranch and to marry him. Why? The wife thinks her husband did not die six weeks ago as Selleck knows, but a year ago, a time the villain insists is the true date of death. Why?",1415923200,,865,4.0

1611465,5,B00005JXI9,"Being October it would seem a bit odd for Sid to be spending time reviewing a western when this is an obvious month for all things horror. Despite that fact, there is no possible way that we could turn down the opportunity to watch Crossfire trail when it appeared last Sunday evening around 11:00 pm. As we perused the programming viewing options we read the synopsis for this gem and knew it would be right up our alley. Not only was the story intriguing but the cast was top notch with Tom Selleck, Mark Harmon, and Wilford Brimley....but we had no idea this acting combination could be so potent. When Wilford Brimley strolled onto the scene we were in a state of pure bliss as he looked like a combination of himself, a hobbit, and David Crosby. The laughter to soon follow could only be compared to that of the 1994 viewing of Death Ring during Don Swayze's machine gun scene. There are few characters in film history that can hold a torch to Brimley's role in this B western powerhouse. Come to think of it, this is our first review of a western. Wow we really set the bar high on the Western B market.

Crossfire Trail is the story of Rafe Covington (Selleck) who promises his dying friend that he'll take care of the man's ranch and his wife once he's officially pushed up daisies. Seems like a simple task for Rafe until he arrives in town and meets Bruce Barkow (Mark Harmon) whose got a stranglehold on all the town folk. What Barkow is to Crossfire Trail, Brad Wesley is to Roadhouse. The only distinguishing difference is Brad Wesley was the perfect villain while Barkow is a bit hard to believe. Mark Harmon just doesn't scream ""tough guy"" as the film would have hoped. Once you've seen him as Mr. Shoop it's pretty hard to picture him striking fear into the hearts of all the towns people. We all know that Selleck and his mustache could take down Mr. Shoop in seconds flat, but he still wrangled himself up a crew including the mighty Wilford Brimley. Brimley's character Joe Gill commands the screen from the moment he arrives. Together they must battle Barkow and his gunslingers in order to take control of the ranch and save his friends wife from the clutches of Barkow. The forced marriage scene is one that won't soon be forgotten. What also won't be forgotten is the brief cameo from Roadhouse's most notorious villain Jimmy. Roadhouse. We won't give away the ending, but do your really think Mark Harmon will be victorious against Tom Selleck and Wilford Brimley? It's just simple logic.

Crossfire Trail is a 5 star event hands down. Even if the film consisted solely of Wilfred Brimley wandering around for an hour and a half it still would have gotten 5 stars. This was Brimley's shining career moment for sure. Outside of Brimley, the rest of the cast was also performing at a level of perfection very hard to be duplicated. Everyone was firing on all cylinders making this one of the finest made for TV movies ever created. The made for TV aspect added an extra element of charm equivalent to that of a direct to video release. After this experience it only makes sense that we delve into the world of westerns going forward. The logical step would be to go after some Sam Elliot features in the very near future.",1413676800,,3243,4.551369863013699

Other than that, I loved Selleck as the good guy and the handsom Mark Harmon as the dastardly jerk. Also, nice performances by Wilford Gil, Christian Kane, and David O'hara.

The only thing that appeared to be missing is that there was an Indian (Native American) war party that was looking for the Chief's daughter. The daughter was kidnapped by...I don't know, a bad man. Selleck's character comes across her, helps her from an injury, then protects her until the scouting party arrives. That was a scene that had a lot of tension that didn't pay off there nor later. So I felt like it was unnecessary. Bad Man shows up later looking to fight but I just feel like there could have been more to the scouting party then just to introduce Bad Man.

Especially the surprise of Tom Harmon playing Selleck's arch nemesis, and playing it to the hilt...Ice water in his veins. He's the perfect bad guy against Selleck's cool, clean, honest and all-American good guy. Virginia Madsen plays a spot-on damsel in distress. Wonderful supporting cast. Wiford Brimley is likeable, which is almost impossible to conceive. Expect the usual sometimes sarcastic witicisms, which he seems to carry from character to character, from Selleck.

1611614,5,B00005JXI9,"What can one say about Tom Selleck. He's one of those actors that gets better looking the older he gets. Crossfire Trail is one of those western tales where Selleck's character Rafe Covington is good as his word and he makes a promise to a dying man that he'll look after the man's widow played by Virginia Madsen and their sprawling Wyoming ranch. At first Madsen doubts the integrity of drifter Covington and there is an unscrupulous land grabber played by Mark Harmon (famous for his role of special agent Leo Jethro Gibbs on NCIS) and his gunmen are sizing up the ranch the way a spider eyes a fly as it says in the description on the DVD case. I just like how it's worded and it fits the villan in this story to a tee. Selleck and filmaker Simon Wince (who also directed Selleck in Quigley Down Under) score a bullseye, steeped in the cowboy way with Louis L'Amour's writing - this movie contain valor, grit, uprightness - all signs of the heroic West - Crossfire Trail. This is a really good vehicle for Selleck. He plays the hero well. This movie also has wonderful character actor Willford Brimley (Cocoon and the sequel) If it's possible for a Western to be classed as a feel good movie, this movie and Selleck's performance amd the good guy winning in the end...drifter Covingington settles down  mostly due to interest in widow Madsen I think but then what woman could resist the tall dark and handsome Selleck.

Tom Selleck, gorgeous as usual, Wilford Brimley, the loyal friend, and at the time newcomer Christian Kane. If you want to see ""baby Kane"" and note his acting ability even 10+ years ago, here is your chance. This is before the days of movie stardom and the role of Eliot, the hitter on Leverage (TNT). Mark Harmon? No!!! Gibbs as a bad guy? Yes, it's true. Obviously the cast stands out, and least we forget, Barry Corbin as the Sheriff, and Virginia Madsen as the ""damsal in distress"" (Dune, Sideways, the Astronaut Farmer), it's truly an ""all star"" cast.

Tom Selleck has to go to the home of his dead friend, meet the wife (Madsen) and help her with whatever it is she needs. Obviously, we must have conflict, so enter Mark Harmon. Meanwhile Selleck and friends Brumley and Kane retreat to a little ranch outside of town. All the usual plot lines take place, with a death of a character along the way. Will the lovely widow let a man take over her riches? Will the Sheriff help her or not? It's a good movie for most ages that you can watch with the guys (it's Louis L'Amour after all) or as a family.

There are all these sinister dealings and misconceptions and lack of trust.

Covington possesses incredible instincts in dealing with people, (mainly those who want to hurt him), and manages to re-shape people's perceptions of him as a suspicious figure. He is a relentless figure who seeks the truth and wants to convey what he knows to Ann Rodney, his friend's wife who owns a large ranch. The ranch is the target of a takeover by a group of men who see big money, as oil is discovered on the property. Wilford Brimley delivers a fine performance as Ann's ranchhand, and quickly realizes Covington's passion and starts to believe in him. The movie ends with a very violent, bloody shootout in the streets, which is what one would expect in a film like this.

There are few men in movies, in my estimation, who can meet Tom Selleck head-on in terms of looks, stature, stage presence, and acting ability and come off as completely equal, but Johnson is all the more chilling because Selleck's good-guy character has clearly met his scary match in this ominous bad guy. Johnson's surprisingly convincing portrayal (surprising only because he usually plays good guys, as in Always) lends a realistic air of uncertainty to what would otherwise have been a predictable plot. I gave this movie 4 stars rather than 5 only because I don't like the love scene between Selleck and Madsen. I usually like her as an actress, but she comes across as hard and lacking in genuine warmth in this scene. Someone should have done something about that. Still, there's good news for female viewers: between Johnson and Selleck, there's no shortage of clean sex appeal in this unrated movie!",1309478400,,1013,4.895348837209302

1611704,5,B00005JXI9,"Tom Selleck plays the lead character in ""Crossfire Trail"" a Louis L'Amour film, that draws together Wilford Brimley, David O'Hara, Barry Corbin, Christian Kane, Virginia Madsen, William Sanderson, Marshall R. Teague, Joanna Miles, Ken Pogue, Patrick Kilpatrick, Rex Linn, Daniel Parker, Brad Johnson, and Mark Harmon to make a western about honor, dishonor, justice, and injustice.  Well, of course the bad guy is portrayed as despicable as possible so you as the viewer don't care how he meets his end, and the good guys are portrayed as civilized and talented, educated and Christian with integrity of character, and noble in thought or deed.  This is the romantic fantasy we all have of the old west glory days, when unspoiled wilderness was freshly becoming tamed, and Native American Indians still had equality and respect among those who lived there.  The story is predictable, stays on track, and ends exactly as it should, with the bad guys dead and all the good guys alive except for one (as final justification for the bad guys dead).  ""Crossfire Trail"" is what I look for in a western, and Tom Selleck has yet to disappoint me in a western; as believable in this film as any I've seen him in.  I happily give this film 5 stars, because it never fell short of what I bought it, and viewed it for.  Attention to detail, authentic, a strong cast in the right fit for roles, solid performances, photography that never wavers, and easy to follow story that goes precisely as I was anticipating it would - who cares if the story is original or not.  I recommend this film because it deserves it.  Yes I know it was shot in Canada and says it is Wyoming.  I enjoyed this film and want to buy ""The Shadow Riders"" next, because Tom Selleck and Sam Elliott are both in that one.  In ""Crossfire Trail"" the more interesting metamorphosis of acting ability I saw was Barry Corbin who obviously has some versatility about him, his role in this film is quite different from when he was on ""Northern Exposure.""  Although it is also a point well made that Mark Harmon also portrays a very, very convincing sorry waste of human skin.  ""Crossfire Trail"" was a TV movie, and although violent in the sense of guns and killing, there is no nudity or sexual part to this film.

  Rooting for the good guy is obviously built in story . Family can watch and all enjoy . Joanna Miles is a vision and leaves one thinking age doesn't change beauty ; maybe that's because her 'take-action' character is sexy to most men .
  Panoramic views add to the NEED for slower story development . LOTS of ""shoot 'em up"" at the end . UNLIKE most movies , Rafe Covington is main character , however , story line is written so  NO ONE could be left out and seems as though each has a prominent scene at some point .

In this film, Selleck plays Rafe Covington, a man who promised a dying friend that he'd look after his wife and the family ranch in Wyoming, only to be troubled by the wife's refusal to believe his words, and a man who has an eye on both the woman and the ranch.
The film is a terrific western adventure, with fantastic performances by the likes of Selleck, Virginia Madsen, Wilford Brimley, David O'hara, Brad Johnson and Mark Harmon. Great action set pieces, beautiful scenery and a terrific score by Eric Colvin combine to make a powerhouse western, the likes of which haven't been seen since the western faded into obscurity in the 1970's.

But a rich scoundrel has plans to talk the widow into marriage and get the ranch for himself. What he doesn't tell her is that he's responsible for her husband's death. Things get real tense for Raif and his friends as the expose the rich man for the cheating liar he is. A well written screenplay adaptation and lovely scenery.

1611793,4,B00005JXI9,"This is the second of three outstanding Westerns that Tom Selleck filmed for TNT between 1997 and 2003. Selleck revisited his early Louis L'Amour, TV-Western roots with ""Crossfire Trail"" and also re-teamed with director Simon Wincer, who directed Selleck's best big-screen effort - ""Quigley Down Under"" - as well as the all-time classic Western ""Lonesome Dove"". The result is an excellent film that, while breaking no new ground, contributes to the rich mythology and legacy of the American cowboy.

Selleck plays Rafe Covington who, at the beginning of the film, promises a dying friend that he will take care of the friend's wife and ranch. Selleck and two partners set out to do just that, and they add a new friend from the nearby town, played by Wilford Brimley, shortly after their arrival. The film is predictable: the widow is suspicious of Rafe's motives, the town bad guy has been wooing the widow in order to get at her land, the bad guy hires a hit man to eliminate Rafe, and so on. And yet, even though the viewer can see right through the plot to the end of the film, every element is so well handled that it is a pleasure to watch the movie.

I read several articles just before the film was released about the painstaking efforts made to have authentic costumes, props, sets, etc., and I must say that the filmmakers' efforts certainly paid off. The film is set in Wyoming, but was filmed in Alberta, Canada, which gives the film some of the best mountain vistas in a Western since the real Grand Tetons were featured in ""Shane"".

There is one small negative element in the film, which is why I couldn't quite bring myself to rate it a 5, and that is occasional strong profanity. I realize that real cowboys weren't always the most genteel people in their society, and I know that our modern society tolerates a lot of profanity; however, in a movie that continually emphasizes honor and integrity, profanity seems unusually out of place. There are DVD players and devices available that filter out profanity; if you are like me, then you can simply get such a player or device and still enjoy this first-rate Western.",1162512000,13,2134,4.685333333333333

Perhaps foolsih but he enlists the aid of two of his friends and a former ranch hand, played by Wilford Brimley, and they make a go of putting the ranch back in shape after a year of neglect.

1611820,5,B00005JXI9,"Tom Selleck and Director, Simon Wincer have collaborated on three Westerns: ""Monte Walsh"", ""Quigley Down Under"", and this film, ""Crossfire Trail."" All three films are the direct modern descendants of the great, archetypal westerns made by the collaboration of John Wayne and Director, John Ford.

When watching Selleck, one cannot help but be reminded of the Duke. Like John Wayne, Selleck fills the screen. When he is on screen, you cannot help but watch him. There is also sincerity to his style, an authenticity especially in a Western that immediately connects with the viewer.

There are several things one can always depend on in a Selleck/Wincer Western:

First, it will be a Western in the classic mold; meaning that the hero will be heroic and the villains will be evil (and both sides will be well rounded, human characters). The fight will be good against evil, honor versus greed. There will always be a simple, great story about men and women who seem achingly made of flesh and blood (this trait is shared with all the great films of John Ford, who primarily loved to flesh characters out fully in film, even the small character parts).

Second, the period feel will be perfect. There is not an actor alive today, or maybe ever, that has a deeper understanding of the American West than Tom Selleck. The look of the towns, the dress and leather gear, and especially the firearms, are all painstakingly perfect. Only the Duke himself ever seemed as competent with a lever action rifle.

Finally, all three films by Selleck/Wincer were photographed by David Eggby, and they are all (in the grand tradition) sweepingly beautiful.

If you are looking for a film that ""demythologizes"" the West, look elsewhere and good riddance to you. Great film making is about mythmaking, and the Western has always been a place were myths were given landscapes to roam. -Mykal Banta",1122508800,13,1878,4.889937106918239

1611822,5,B00005JXI9,"Based on a Louis L'Amour book, the script for this made for cable film is marvelous; it's the substance that makes the characters come alive, and the performances so fine. Though very predictable, down to the very last shot, the words and the acting make it worthwhile viewing. Tom Selleck is superb as Rafe Covington, larger than life, a hero with principles and strength, who never misses his target, and is about as handsome as a man can be. He is backed by a great cast, with Virginia Madsen, one of Hollywood's most underrated actresses, perfect as the widow men want, either for love or what her ranch has to offer. Mark Harmon plays a slimy fellow who though he ""has manners and smells nice"", is pure greedy evil, and Wilford Brimley is terrific as Selleck's crusty old friend.

Filmed in Calgary, Alberta, the scenery and many horses are beautiful and David Eggby's cinematography makes the most of it, and Eric Colvin's atmospheric, melodic score adds so much to the film. Simon Wincer's direction is well paced (Wincer worked with Selleck in ""Quigley Down Under""), but the bottom line is the script, by Charles Robert Carner, which is way above average for the genre, and being made for TV, is free of the foul language that has permeated films in this age, and makes it excellent family viewing.

  For those of us who haven't gone out of our way to track Selleck's career this movie is a revelation of sorts.  He fits comfortably in the John Wayne/Randolph Scott/Gary Cooper tradition of the strong, dependable western hero. Fast paced and well photographed (see it in wide-screen if possible), with an above average cast, this movie is definitely going to please anyone who thinks they don't make them like that anymore.

  CROSSFIRE TRAIL also contains one of the best final shootouts I've seen.  Not only is it well choreographed and understandable, it also pulls off the unique trick of resolving some minor character questions - in particular those surrounding the town sheriff (Barry Corbin), who tries to drown his self-loathing while the guns are blazing.

1611857,4,B00005JXI9,"Morality plays set in the Old West, a staple of my childhood on both television and in theaters, are hard to come by these days, so it's a treat when a half-way decent one comes along - like CROSSFIRE TRAIL. And there aren't too many living actors that can do a credible cowboy hero - Eastwood and Duvall come to mind. Luckily, this film has another excellent one of the genre, Tom Selleck.
CROSSFIRE TRAIL opens aboard a merchant vessel off the California coast in the 1870s. Rafe Covington (Selleck) is comforting a dying pal, beaten to death by the sadistic captain. After promising to look after the man's wife and ranch, and kicking the bandini out of the ship's master, we next see Rafe riding through the magnificent mountain scenery that is ostensibly Wyoming. Upon arrival at the ranch, Rafe finds the place deserted. In the nearby town, Covington discovers the widow, Ann Rodney (Virginia Madsen), under the benevolent spell of smooth talkin' Bruce Barkow (Mark Harmon), the local VIP who holds the mortgage on the ranch and pretty much rules the local rubes with his band of armed good ol' boys. (Where have we seen this before? SHANE, PALE RIDER, and THE QUICK AND THE DEAD.) Barkow is more suave and better dressed than most villains of the ilk. As Rafe notes, Ann likes Bruce because ""he has manners and smells nice"". In any case, the Wider Rodney doesn't believe Rafe's version of events, but accepts Barkow's story that her husband was killed by Injuns on his way back from San Francisco. It's quite obvious that Barkow covets Ann and her land, which has pools of oil on it. The conflict is, of course, between Covington and Barkow, and the hired pistolero that the latter imports from, of all places, Kansas. (SHANE and PALE RIDER also had pistol packin' hit men.)
Because the plot of CROSSFIRE TRAIL offered no surprises at all, I was tempted to award only three stars. However, playing the stolid, principled and reluctant gunfighter is Selleck's forte, and he does it as well as The Duke, Alan Ladd, or Gary Cooper ever did. Harmon is particularly oily as the charming Barkow, and there's a crusty performance by the aging Wilford Brimley, one of my favorite character actors, as Joe, Ann's ex-ranch hand. And it was good to see Barry Corbin as Barkow's toady Sheriff Moncrieff. (Corbin was Chris Cooper's deputy in LONESOME DOVE.) So, I'm awarding a reluctant four stars.
The scenery is absolutely gorgeous, and mated to an uplifting score. I was all set to saddle-up for Wyoming when the credits rolled and informed me that the film was shot in Calgary, Alberta, and at the Western Studio and Backlot, which, according to its website, is 35 minutes west of the city. Hummph! Pretty soon they'll be pretending it's Tombstone's OK Corral with Mt. Fuji in the background. At least SHANE had the Grand Tetons.",1060473600,72,2827,4.747967479674797

7942581,4,B00005JXI9,"RELEASED TO TV IN 2001 and directed by Simon Wincer, ""Crossfire Trail"" is a Western starring Tom Selleck as a laconic Westerner named Rafe Covington who travels to Wyoming to honor his promise to a dying friend: Look after the mans wife (Virginia Madsen) and ranch after hes gone.  The problem is, the charlatan mogul of the nearby town wants them too (Mark Harmon).

While this was a TNT production, its on par with the average traditional Western/theatrical release, e.g. The War Wagon (1967) or Open Range (2003), and is more satisfying than most goofy spaghetti Westerns. Voluptuous Madsen is formidable in the female department while cutie Kyla (Anderson) Wise works well in the periphery as a barmaid. Moreover, likable Selleck towers in the role of the noble protagonist, who attracts an equally noble group of sidekicks (Wilford Brimley, Christian Kane and David O'Hara).

The story surprisingly loses steam in the last act with a classic shootout-in-town between the heroes and villains. Dont get me wrong, the fight is muscular and competently executed, its just a little lackluster somehow and gives away the flicks TV origins. Nevertheless, this is a worthwhile modern Western with Harmon superlative as the swindling antagonist.
