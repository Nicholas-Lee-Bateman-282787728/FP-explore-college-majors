2596246,5,B000G0O5EG,"In the early 1970's, I remember how Dick Cavett was constantly positioned as a competitive threat to reigning late night king Johnny Carson. Coming across as far more erudite and at times pretentious, Cavett never came close ratings-wise, yet he did get some amazing ""gets"" during his tenure on ABC. This four-disc set is appropriately entitled ""Hollywood Greats"" since it contains relatively extensive interviews with true film legends who rarely subjected themselves to such probing. While Cavett can come across as a bit worshipful at times (e.g., he looks truly awestruck with Hepburn for the first half-hour), he also asks sharp, often unconventional questions and offers some clever quips to warm up his guests with tangible results.

The best is the two-part 1973 interview with Katharine Hepburn, her first ever for TV. At a robust-looking 66 and with her crackling persona in full bloom, the legend threatens to make Cavett into a whipping boy with her unapologetic honesty and lacerating wit. After a typically critical appraisal of the set, the interview unexpectedly starts, and for well over two hours, she is constantly fascinating from her confessions of being a burglarizing prankster in her youth to her genuine pride over her accomplished parents to her thinly veiled disgust with actors who refuse Oscars to her personal impressions of co-stars like Bogart and Peter O'Toole. What she does so well is completely skewer Cavett when he becomes too unctuous, for example, when he asks whether she regrets not working with Olivier, her lightning-quick response is ""Neither of us is dead yet."" My favorite moment occurs when Cavett disingenuously asks Hepburn whether she has ever had a desire to snort some coke, her response is immediate...""Cold sober...I find myself absolutely fascinating."" So true. There is also an intriguing extra included - 24 minutes of unedited pre-interview footage which shows Hepburn interviewing Cavett.

There are also terrific conversations with Bette Davis, Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, as well as master directors Orson Welles, John Huston and Alfred Hitchcock. The feisty Davis showcases her brazen honesty with unabated energy and humor in a 1971 interview, especially talking about her early days at Warner Brothers when she was called on to assess fifteen actors on their lovemaking skills. Also from 1971, Mitchum is hilariously deadpan as he talks about escaping a chain gang in Georgia or the seemingly unyielding tolerance of his wife of thirty years. With his dry humor in full effect in 1972 just as his underrated ""Frenzy"" was released, Hitchcock is wonderfully sharing about his particular aptitude in filmmaking as well as his limitations.

The funniest chats are unsurprisingly with Groucho Marx (with fellow guest Debbie Reynolds) and Mel Brooks, who is part of an intimidating multiple-filmmaker line-up of Frank Capra, Robert Altman and Peter Bogdanovich. There are some other chats that are not as interesting. Even though he sings Gershwin, Berlin and Porter tunes with his elegance intact, an impeccably dressed but overly self-effacing Fred Astaire is simply not that revealing in his 1970 interview. He easily looks the most ill-at-ease with Cavett's format. But easily the worst interview is with Marlon Brando, then embroiled in his 1973 Oscar snub and focused on the plight of Native Americans. With his cocky arrogance, the 49-year old actor, who was then in the midst of a career renaissance with ""The Godfather"" and ""Last Tango in Paris"", simply refuses to talk about his career in favor of his cause despite Cavett's best efforts.

Sadly, the print quality varies at times, in particular, during the Hepburn interview when the lighting noticeably changes from segment to segment. Nearly seventy now, Cavett has recorded new introductions for the interviews with his personal remembrances of how they came about. On Disc Four, there is also a recent interview TCM's Robert Osborne conducts with Cavett, more celebratory than insightful. This set is for anyone who is a fan of Hollywood's golden era, as Cavett was able to talk to otherwise inaccessible celebrities and capture their real personalities for posterity.

Here is the content breakdown of the four discs:

--Disc One: Katharine Hepburn, Fred Astaire

--Disc Two: Bette Davis, Groucho Marx, Kirk Douglas

--Disc Three: Mel Brooks, Frank Capra, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, John Huston, Marlon Brando

--Disc Four: Robert Mitchum, Orson Welles, Alfred Hitchcock",1159660800,71,4507,5.3011204481792715

2596248,5,B000G0O5EG,"This is the first time I have written a review for Amazon.  I just purchased this DVD today and simply could not wait to see Cavett's interviews with Bette Davis and Katherine Hepburn.  Both these women are so unique and so strong willed in their sense of who they are one can't help but be impressed.  Earlier today I glanced at the Tyra Banks show and she was devoting her entire show to interview the Celeb du jour Nicole Richie.  When asked, Richie could  not fully even explain why she was famous.  Seeing Davis and Hepburn one is fully aware why they are so rightly put on a pedastal by movie fans and film historians when seeing their originality and inner strength and sheer bravado.  In a way it is very sad seeing these two being interviewed especially when compared to the mediocrity of todays bland celebs that are all about marketing and fit bodies and NO PERSONALITY!

Watching Hepburn I am inspired to honor everything about myself that is unique and to aspire to live life better and to more consciously enjoy the present.

As a gay man, I must say Bette Davis has fascinated me since I was a kid.  Her physical fraility (especially towards the end of her life) could never diminish her forceful personality.  It is because of this contradiction that I believe so many gay men of a past era have been inspired by her- I can't imagine anyone telling her what to do without encountering a wrath of outrage on her part.  In Cavetts interview she remains as commanding and opionated as ever.  Davis will always be my favorite actress, but Hepburn is a close second.

I am eager to see the other interviews on this DVD collection, especially Orson Welles.  Cavett is a wonderful interviewer because he allows his guest to shine with little interruption.  I always thought Oprah was great at interviewing, but after seeing Cavett I must admit she constantly interrupts her guest and fails to let them shine (lets face it the spotlight is on her even if she were interviewing Christ-just kidding!!).

Do yourself a favor during this present day wasteland of celebrity mediocrity and hear the wisdom and charm of celebrities that live up to their greatness.  I know Davis and Hepburn will charm you while they share interesting anecdotes about their lives in such a wonderfully articulate way.  It is so refreshing to hear celebrities speak who are actually intelligent and have something to truly say.  Enjoy!",1158019200,77,2418,4.711904761904762

Dick Cavett was a very unique talk show host blending dry wit with hisf fannish but informative interviews.

My only gripe is why there aren't more sets of the Cavett programs?

I want to own episodes that featured Cavett & Capote vs racist Governor Lester Maddox; the terrific verbal fireworks between Gore Vidal and Norman Mailer; plus the awesome interviews with guests like Lillian Gish, Satchel Paige, Salvador Dali, John Simon, Warhol Superstar Viva, Nora Ephron,William Saroyan, Veronica Lake, Anthony Burgess, Patsy Kelly, Lady Bird Johnson, Ingmar Bergman,  Bibi Andersson, Kenneth Tynan, Enoch Powell, Spike Milligan,  Pete Hamill, Marshall Efrom, Milos Forman, John Kerry, Alexis Smith, George Bush, Edmund Muskie, Gloria Swanson, Janet Flanner, Paddy Chayefsky, Christopher Isherwood, Allen Ginsburg -and more!!",1384473600,7,917,5.4822695035460995
2596261,5,B000G0O5EG,Saw the Alfred Hitchcock interview on Dick Cavett show from 1970's and had to have.  Looked it up on Amazon - and found it.  Enjoyed all the other great interviews too.  Well worth the price for hours of entertainment.,1382832000,,218,4.538461538461538
2596262,3,B000G0O5EG,"While I enjoy watching Dick Cavett interview celebrities such as Brando, Hepburn, Marx, and Burton - it is in spite of, not because of Cavett's lame questions.  He hems, he haws, he perspires, he mutters,he loses himself in his misguided, and usually failed, attempts to be witty  Hepburn et al run roughshod over him and after awhile it is as though he is not there, or at least this viewer wishes he were not.  He turns being tongue-tied into an artform - an artform akin to wrinkling one's nose or asking someone to pull one's thumb.  He brings obsequiousness to a level even Osric would never have dreamed of (though James Lipton has him trumped in the servile department.  I am certain that one day Lipton will finally ask a guest to bend over so he can plant one on his posterior).  Worst is when he tries to be clever and then apologizes for it - as well he should.  Brando leads the interview (""I don't want to talk about that."") and Cavett comes along for the ride - sitting comfortably in the backseat.  I keep waiting for him to ask Kate or Groucho if they'll autograph his yearbook.

  There's a great line in ""A Hard day's Night"" in which John is having fun at the producer's expense and says ""His wife knitted 'im"".  It certainly would fit Cavett if the barb were aimed at 'im.  One does not wish an interviewer to be as rude as, say, Morton Downey, but nor does one want an interviewer to be in awe of the person he is interviewing.  Susskind also had a difficult time getting a question out, but with him the effect seemed related to a physical impairment while Cavett's impairment is purely emotional.  Then there are the inevitable pauses. . .in which both interviewer and interviewee are utterly lost for words.  In common parlance it is called lack of preparation.  He expects his celebrities to be brimming with so many stories that it rarely occurs to him to think of some questions on his own.",1379808000,3,1916,4.491329479768786

2596265,5,B000G0O5EG,"I watched most of Dick Cavett's shows when they were originally shown in the '70's.  What I did not realize was why I liked him so much.  I was too young to know how smart, quick, witty, and creative he was.  I mainly concentrated on his wonderful guests.  After I  viewed the first boxed set of his most famous shows I bought the next boxed set and I will buy them all!
This is television at it's best.  Matter of fact TV was better then, then it is now.  Or were the Stars he had on bigger then?
Cavett is a master.  All the commercials have been taken out and when the interviews are over you wish they weren't..
Please, release all his shows on box set.  Germaine Greer & Joan Baez were two I remember that were very good but what the hell, they all are,  because he is so good!  Thank you Mr. Cavett. Thank you for keeping alive the best of our pop culture.

2596266,4,B000G0O5EG,"I guess talk shows moved more slowly in the 70's; at least Cavett's did. So relax, sit back and ""sit in"" on some leisurely conversations Cavett has with some of the greats.  Only Brando's appearance was disappointing, as he refused to discuss his movies or acting during his interview and instead invited a few American Indians onto the show with him. Quality of the DVD, including the sound, is good.",1300665600,,401,4.728571428571429

2596268,5,B000G0O5EG,"I must give a big round of applause to both Mr. Cavett and to Shout for releasing this great collection of COMPLETE shows. The video and sound quality are magnificent. Mr. Cavett gives the viewer a brief nostalgic introduction to each episode and then the video immediately takes you back to the 1970s, presented just as it was originally presented on ABC-TV from start to finish. It's wonderful to see these episodes in the original, uncut version! I am so pleased to have purchased this collection as well as the other collections of his show that also contain complete episodes. The interviews are funny, sensitive, informative and to see so many greats who have since passed on (Bette Davis, Katharine Hepburn, Groucho Marx) is just amazing. I would love to see even more complete episodes of The Dick Cavett Show released - perhaps with some of the many famous authors and writers that he interviewed in the 1970s - that would be WONDERFUL!",1283040000,,945,4.803680981595092
2596269,5,B000G0O5EG,"Whether it's ""The Tonight Show"" as hosted by either Conan O' Brien or Jay Leno, or ""The Late Show"" with David Letterman, most ""talk shows"" are, in fact, comedy programs built around their hosts. The chat, in which the guest plugs a new movie, is superficial and quickly forgotten by the time that the credits roll. Such was not the case with ""The Dick Cavett Show,"" which aired on ABC opposite ""The Tonight Show"" during the late `60s and early `70s. The host, to quote Kirk Douglas, one of the guests in this four disc set devoted to ""Hollywood Greats,"" was ""erudite,"" and the only time he appeared in the role of a comedian was during the opening monologue which was wittier and subtler than anything you're likely to see on TV today.

Once the monologue was out of the way, Cavett hosted a genuine ""talk show."" Conversation was key, and his guests were drawn from areas other than entertainment. Cavett's ratings would likely have been very respectable in modern times, but in the three network universe of the `70s, his show was under constant threat of cancellation due to its failure to attract an audience comparable in size to that of Johnny Carson. Like Kirk said, Cavett was ""erudite,"" and that's not the way to describe the majority of the television audience. In an interview from Cavett's June 12, 1973 show, Marlon Brando referred to the audience as beer drinkers in T-shirts who had enough troubles of their own to think about all day and would rather not hear him talk about the plight of the American Indian (the now politically incorrect word to described Native Americans). Brando was not in a mood to discuss anything else, however, and waved away Cavett's inquiries concerning ""The Godfather"" and the then current ""Last Tango in Paris.""

Brando is actually one of the least interesting of the ""Hollywood Greats"" featured in this 4-disc DVD set, one of several in the Shout Factory's series collecting memorable episodes from Cavett's show. These are not clips, but complete episodes, so when Brando appears in an unfashionably new jean jacket with neckerchief and a beard, we also see the other guests he insisted on (Sam Cagey, Dr. Wallace Heath, Dennis Lemberhand, Mervin Wright) who discuss Brando's pet cause. Prior to sitting down with Cavett, Brando probably hadn't appeared on TV in a decade, so it's interesting to see him in this environment, but as Cavett notes in his introduction, the show is ""unsatisfying."" Brando speaks slowly, and very carefully, gazes at the ceiling when thinking about Cavett's questions, then answers elusively. Movies, he says, are not interesting enough to talk about, and, besides, he hasn't seen the controversial ""Last Tango"" so he has nothing interesting to say about it. As for acting, it's a craft, a job that provides food and shelter for his family. Those who consider it an art are ""deluding themselves."" Like those beer drinkers in T-shirts that Brando mentions, I was too bored to sit still through the segment devoted to his cause, and as ""Indians"" took to the stage (along with a white do-gooder who did much of the talking), I fast-forwarded to the conclusion where Brando tore open a plastic package containing trout and began eating. When a crumb fell on the chair between his legs, he picked it up and ate that, too, unconcerned that his seat may not have been cleaned since the previous show and residue from another guest's perspiring behind might have attached itself to his snack.

Unfortunately, there were no television cameras present after the show when Cavett joined Brando for dinner. As they walked along New York's streets, paparazzi photographer Ron Gallela snapped a photo of the pair, and Brando, probably wanting to impress Cavett, punched the shutterbug and broke his jaw. This nasty moment received more press than anything he said about Indians on the show, and, in my view, suggests Brando was a phony, less concerned about the downtrodden than in presenting himself as a man who can speak intelligently without the aid of a script. At times on the Cavett show, he succeeded, but for the most part he has little to say and is at his best when he's silent and lets that famous grin speak for him.

Orson Welles and Alfred Hitchcock were no strangers to talk shows, and they effortlessly hold the attention throughout their separate 90-minute appearances. Welles speaks at length (but without much apparent admiration) about another ""auteur,"" Jerry Lewis, and is appalled by the sound in a film clip from ""Lady from Shanghai."" Hitchcock tells the story about his fear of policemen and how it began when his father managed to convince the police to lock him in a jail cell to teach him a lesson. In old age, his fear lessened, but police still filled him with ""mild apprehension.""

Surprisingly, the often earthy Bette Davis sounds like a pretentious prima donna as she describes the conditions at Warner Bros. as ""terrible"" in the 1930s during her heyday at the studio. It was ""terrible"" because she was forced to appear in so many films unworthy of her talent, but she fails to express appreciation for having been gainfully employed, and paid exorbitantly well at that, when the country was still mired in the Great Depression. Robert Mitchum never removes his tinted glasses, smokes Lucky Strikes , and speaks freely, politely, and literately, though he doesn't provide too much insight into his career. Kirk Douglas barely needs Cavett. He seems to be hugely enjoying himself and praises Johnny Cash, his co-star in ""A Gunfight,"" in release at the time of the June 29, 1971 interview. No, he did not resent that Cash was such a good actor in what both Douglas and Cavett call the singer's film debut. (In reality, it wasn't. Cash had previously appeared in ""Door to Door Maniac,"" a B film from a decade earlier.)

John Huston, with shiny white hair and a full beard, speaks passionately about Ireland, where he was residing at the time, when its problems with England were at their height, and praises Humphrey Bogart as his first choice for all the films they made together, and still his first choice for the films he wishes Bogart had lived to make. These days, it's rare to see anyone smoking on television. In the `70s, however, talk show guests lit up frequently even after the FCC banned cigarette advertising on TV. MItchum smokes throughout his appearance, Peter Bogdanovich and Mel Brooks both smoke during the show in which they are joined by fellow directors Robert Altman and Frank Capra, and Huston puffs on - and inhales! - a cigar. ""Please don't inhale cigars,"" Cavett tells him at the conclusion of their chat. After Huston developed emphysema later that decade, he may have wished he had heeded Cavett's advice.

The most ballyhooed guest among the ""Hollywood Greats"" on Cavett's show was Katherine Hepburn whose appearance was divided into two back-to-back programs. I never cared for her, have seen few of her films, and remain mystified by her appeal. Fred Astaire was another film legend who bored me (except in ""Holiday Inn""), so Disc One, on which their appearances are featured, was the last to be inserted into my DVD player, and the one I watched with less than rapt attention. Therefore, I won't write about it here.

I went to Wikipedia to see what has happened to Dick and discovered that there are DVDs of many of his interviews. I will buy them all. His ability to draw out the person and get from them honest answers to intelligent questions has never been equalled.

Unless you are from that era, you may not appreciate the unexciting Dick Cavett but what a pleasure to be able to listen to many huge and very private Hollywood Stars who rarely gave interviews at that time. An incredible look into their lives. Dick Cavett's laid back style works perfectly in this particular setting and his open affection for Katharine Hepburn is both humorous and wonderful.

The Katharine Hepburn interview was worth the price of this DVD If you ever wanted to know anything about KH and her very private life, you won't be disappointed as she also talks about others whom she worked with or befriended. KH is indeed a very strong willed individual and was her own person throughout her life. Acting was her life and romances were few because there simply wasn't time.

Look, listen and feel good about the times when humor was simple and funny without having to be vulgar or X-Rated. How refreshing to watch a classic movie and see the two partners walk upstairs to the bedroom while leaving the rest up to your imagination. Well, this DVD gives you the same refreshing feeling. See Bette Davis as you may never have before, watch Alfred Hitchcock with his double talking, if you could understand it.

I saw these shows when they were first aired in the early 1970s and I believe I enjoy them more now that I can view them with the objectivity of time while still enjoying a bit of nostalgia for the television of my younger days.

2596276,5,B000G0O5EG,"I've only watched a couple of these shows so far but can see already how much greater this chatshow format is to the modern day shows. Here, in most cases, the full show is given over to one guest (and unlike modern chatshows, they were not there to plug their latest book, film or whatever, but to entertain and to give the viewer an insight into their character) And in this collection we have some of the great Hollywood stars, simply sitting and chatting with a charming host, for an hour and a half.
Dick Cavett is quite deceptive in that he seems to do very little as a host but that is where his real skill comes in because he has the real ability to bring out the best in his guests without trying to steal the limelight from them. This is classic tv and a must buy for anyone interested in Hollywood when it used to produce 'Stars'.",1199836800,,841,4.2625
2596277,4,B000G0O5EG,"Cavett shared with Johnny Carson the interviewer's finest gift: the ability to listen and to go with the flow. This sometimes came at a price. When confronted with a recalcitrant guest (here, Brando, who would never have made this package's cut had he not been, well, Brando) Cavett was hobbled. When commandeered by a zany (here, Mel Brooks), four-handed conversations flew straight out the window. But when it's Cavett one-on-one with an intelligent raconteur, the results glisten. For the most part there's a lot of sparkle in this set, thanks to entertaining storytellers like Huston, Welles, Hitchcock, Astair, Davis, Douglas, and Mitchum. The two-stage interview with Hepburn is a marvel: basically, they just rolled the cameras and Cavett coaxed an interview out of her nearly in spite of herself. The reflective set-ups by the host are entertaining and informative, as is the segment with Robert Osborne. A little pricey--I purchased mine used but in very good consition--but well worth the money if you love Old Hollywood.",1191456000,5,1031,5.216867469879518
2596278,5,B000G0O5EG,"Dick Cavett is a wonderful personality who hosted his own television show during the late 1960s and early 1970s. His conversational style of interview is refreshing compared to the short snippets we see on modern talk shows. Thankfully, Cavett's show preserves a period of history long gone and often forgotten. This DVD set celebrates the wit and charm of the stars of Hollywood gone by.

Unfortunately, some of the shows are similar thanks to Cavett's use of familiar devices. Several of the episodes feature trivia questions directed toward the audience in lieu of a monologue. And why does he ask that incessant question about acting not being masculine enough?

We hear Cavett in modern times commenting on each and every episode with a more lengthy featurette with Robert Osbourne. Sometimes he acknowledges his mistakes and makes fun of himself, and other times he tells stories about after the show.

One of the most entertaining interviews is the one with Alfred Hitchcock, apparently a much-requested episode. Hitchcock is revealed to be rather bright with an excellent sense of humor. Orson Welles' episode is very similar, filled with gems of information. Other shows are simply funny and great fun to watch like Bette Davis' spot and the one featuring legendary directors Mel Brooks, Robert Altman, Peter Bogdanovich, and Frank Capra. Brooks manages to steal the show, as always, but Capra gets a chance to tell some interesting stories.

Some interviews are rather uncomfortable. Groucho Marx and Debbie Reynolds make an unruly pair which paint Marx as a belligerent jerk and Reynolds as a prude without a sense of humor. Marlon Brando makes a rare television appearance with a red flag waving for the cause of the Native Americans.

Who else? Fred Astaire sings, Katharine Hepburn dictates, Kirk Douglas reminisces, John Huston smokes, and Robert Mitchum just is. With such an excellent cast of characters, how could you pass this one up?",1180483200,11,1953,5.109717868338558

The Brando interview is astounding: is he arrogant, genius, mad? Make up your own mind but you won't be able to turn it off!

Welles comes across as like no other alive today: he spent time with the greats, lived among them and don't miss his anecdotes about Churchill.

2596281,5,B000G0O5EG,"Katharine Hepburn is and always will be my most beloved actress, so I ordered this set because of her. Since I live in the Czech republic, I have never had a chance of watching these two interviews, so it was a must for me.

But I am a person interested in Hollywood generally, so I must say that basically all of the interviews are fascinating. To name just a few, the humorous Alfred Hitchcock, the wonderful Bette Davis, and Frank Capra, who should have been IMO given more time since he's very interesting. And Fred Astaire actually dances and sings, so that is also a great thing about this incredible set which I heartily reccomend.",1167782400,2,638,4.547826086956522
2596282,5,B000G0O5EG,"After viewing this set, I now realize why I have no interest in watching today's late-night talk-TV shows (Leno, et al.) -- there's an intelligence gap between those and The Dick Cavett Show the size of the Grand Canyon. The only currently running show that measures up to Cavett's standard is 'Inside the Actor's Studio' on Bravo; and I wouldn't be at all surprised to learn that Cavett was James Lipton's inspiration. The interviews with Katharine Hepburn are by themselves worth the price of the boxed set. I only regret is that Cavett did not interview James Stewart (or if he did, that it wasn't included in the set -- though I can't imagine that anyone could possibly assemble a Hollywood Greats collection that wouldn't include Stewart!). The interviews with Mitchum, Douglas and Brando simply blew me away. One can only hope that there are more of these in ""the vaults"" somewhere!",1166745600,7,888,4.848684210526316
2596283,4,B000G0O5EG,"Like most of the other reviewers, I remember watching Dick Cavett's show all those years ago. It was sometimes quite entertaining, frequently irritating, but a slightly more highbrow alternative to the antics of Johnny Carson. The best thing about the show was the quality of the guests - not all of the time, but often enough to make watching the show regularly worthwhile. This set of Hollywood Greats contains some of the more memorable interviews, most of them devoted to a single guest.

In the Cavett/Osborne interview that is a mildly interesting extra, Cavett quotes his idol Jack Paar's rule that talk shows should be conversations rather than interviews. This is, apparently, easier said than done. When Cavett and his guests click - such as Bette Davis and Orson Welles - they are an absolute delight. Some of the other guests such as Robert Mitchum and Kirk Douglas, are pleasant and genial and give the viewer a totally different impression of these actors than one might get from their films. Fred Astaire, on the other hand, seemed awkward and uncomfortable - probably preferring dance to conversation. And John Huston, who had a reputation as a witty raconteur, is a big disappointment - stumbling over words and not being overly forthcoming in his answers until the end when he wastes far too much time expounding his rather crackpot views about Northern Ireland.

Cavett says the Hitchcock interview is the one fans most ask to see again, but I have no idea why. It comes across as very strained and stilted. Hitchcock is his usual po-faced self, telling familiar anecdotes with his trademark dry wit. But Cavett's interview seems completely disorganized and he often appears not to know what to say or do next. Similarly, the Brando interview was full of false starts and awkward pauses - it was the only one that I turned off half way through. The show with the four film directors was an interesting experiment. Mel Brooks, who had only directed two films at that point, plays court jester while Frank Capra is the wise old man that the others pay obvious homage to. Robert Altman says very little - it is Peter Bogdonovich who comes off best.

The viewer's response to the Katharine Hepburn shows will be in direct proportion to how much they like her in the first place. Personally, I found her alternately amusing and irritating in roughly equal measures, but my wife loved her.

Then there's Cavett himself. For me, he has always been a very difficult person to like. In interviews like these in particular, he is much too starstruck by his guests to be a really effective interviewer - he is never inclined to probe beneath the charm and anecdotes. And he tries too hard to be a combination of the brainy Ivy Leaguer and the shy kid from the Midwest. While his guests occasionally let the public image slip, Cavett is always the facade. And his little introductions to each show demonstrate that he hasn't changed very much over the years.

The other thing about seeing all these shows together is that you realize how much Cavett recycled the same questions. For instance, he asked every actor (Hepburn included) if they thought that acting was an ""un-masculine"" profession and never got a single sensible answer. (I remember David Frost used to ask every guest: ""What is your definition of love?"" with similar results.)

All in all, I'm very glad to have got this DVD set and will certainly enjoy watching parts of it again. If nothing else, it proves that the good old days really were good - especially compared to the shows and alleged personalities that are on our screens now.",1163289600,15,3609,4.794212218649518

2596285,2,B000G0O5EG,"I was looking forward to the issuance of this set because I remembered the Cavett interviews as insightful. However, what the set showed me was how inaccurate memory can be. Cavett was the darling of the ""intellectual"" set because, to his credit, he was interested and willing to give his guests more time than to just promote something. But what the interview set showed me was how really terrible Cavett was as an interviewer. When the guest was talkative, like Hepburn or Brooks, the shows were a delight, but when the guests were more reticent, like Hitchcock or Mitchum, then its almost worthless watching. Nothing new is revealed. In truth, Cavett was decent and an apparently nice man, but he doesn't really know how to open up his guests. The thrill here is that he had these guests for an extended time and since all, except for Brooks, are no longer with us, they do have some value. The other thing these interviews showed me was that Charlie Rose is a much better interviewer, although he has his own problem in not knowing when to shut up. I'm not really sure I'd recommend this set to anyone.",1162944000,8,1106,4.619289340101523
2596286,5,B000G0O5EG,"I discovered that not only do I like Orson Welles (after all), I love him, he is a wonderful and wonderfully humble person.  My only previous exposures to him were a talk show 30 years ago where I disliked him intensely (he said everyone is an actor, consider how people say, ""Have a good day.""), Citizen Kane which I not only didn't like, I didn't understand, and The Third Man where I stupidly, mistakenly took the smug pomposity of his character (Harry Lime, wasn't it?) for his actual personality.  I was dead wrong.  He is just a very talented actor, with a perfectly charming and ""ordinary"" personality of his own.  I had to say all that because I was so off base about him.  I almost skipped his hour on the discs.  Which brings me to my only substantial comment.  Each interview lasted about 1 hour EXACTLY.  1 or 2 ran to an hour and fifteen minutes.  Yet Cavett kept calling them 90 minute shows.  Did people really endure a full half hour of commercials for just an hour of program?  Either these actors demanded a high price for their presence, or somebody was getting rich.  Yet they couldn't have been just hour long shows, because then there would have been no room for commercials at all.  I'd like to mention now that I never watch TV, haven't for years, nothing to watch, my TV is hooked up to my DVD player.  I consider these discs rare treasures, just finished them (have the comics to watch next, that's all I bought), and a little less pompously I thought they were a fascinating delight.",1162252800,8,1510,4.483516483516484
2596287,5,B000G0O5EG,"This is a great DVD set with 4 disks. It's as though the essence of the people interviewed was captured and time has stood still. Somehow Dick Cavett managed to find the person behind the celebrity and these are very likeable people. Robert Mitchum is wonderful and could have probably made it as a comedian as well as a serious actor. He keeps you laughing and his conversation is thoroughly enjoyable. Marlon Brando is always fascinating to watch and although he might not always say what you want to hear, he does say what he honestly thinks. One reviewer mentioned his ""cocky arrogance"" which I did not see at all.  I saw a man that was there to talk about the problems of Native Americans and genuinely wanted to help. Brando's sensitive, caring side is captured and he seems so aware of what Native Americans were going through that he could actually feel their pain. And his smile makes you feel all better anyway. Kirk Douglas is charming, witty and interesting. Betty Davis is her outspoken best.

Although I have my favorites, all of them come across as down to earth, intelligent, interesting people that are much nicer than you might have thought.",1160870400,3,1159,4.704433497536946
2596288,5,B000G0O5EG,"In our current soundbite culture the art of conversation is dead. Talk shows (both day and night) are merely vehicles for actors, authors and musicians to promote their latest movie, book or record. They are given very little time to have a conversation between commercial breaks. With the exception of The Charlie Rose Show, which is on public television and has no commercials, there are very few shows were people can talk to each other for longer than five minutes without an interruption.

In the 1970s, The Dick Cavett Show was a great source of fascinating conversation. He interviewed a diverse group of people during the various incarnations of his program and this new boxed set features an impressive collection of Hollywood icons who normally shunned these kinds of shows and the Hollywood scene in general. Cavett gets notoriously private stars like Katharine Hepburn and Bette Davis to open up in wonderfully unpredictable interviews. At first, they seem uncomfortable or, in Hepburn's case, even confrontational but Cavett, like any good interviewer, makes them feel at ease. This, in turn, makes them feel comfortable enough to talk about their lives and careers.

Another potentially tough interview subject, Robert Mitchum, comes across as quite pleasant and engaging as he tells all kinds of entertaining Hollywood stories. He clearly felt comfortable enough around Cavett to speak candidly about his career. He talks about his lifelong struggle with insomnia and nonchalantly about his stint on a chain gang, alluding to his escape from it. There is a real absence of ego (as opposed to Brando) as the actor speaks humbly about his reputation. Mitchum was one of those rare movie stars unafraid to speak his mind. The man led a colourful life and was someone you could listen to for hours because he was such a good storyteller.

The first disc features ""Katharine Hepburn Uncut,"" showing her with Cavett before the show started getting ready. It allows us to see them in unguarded moments that provide fascinating insight on the legendary actress.

Discs two, three and four include promos for various shows. Also on this fourth disc is ""Seeing Stars with Dick Cavett and Robert Osborne."" The two men talk about the differences between talk shows when he did them and that state of them now. Cavett speaks about how he became a talk show host and how his hero was the legendary Jack Paar. Osborne takes Cavett through some of his more famous guests (complete with clips) and offers his recollections of them.",1160611200,33,2529,5.014285714285714
