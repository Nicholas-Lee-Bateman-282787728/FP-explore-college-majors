8589854,2,B00D69I4KA,This video is very dated and does not include any current information for Yoga for Wellness,1501545600,,91,4.75
8589855,5,B00D69I4KA,It was just what I was looking for.  Lorien explain how to do yoga move clearly. My mother who never done yoga before was able to follow along since Lorien show different ways to do each move. Thank you,1387152000,,202,4.17948717948718
8589856,5,B00D69I4KA,"I got my DVD and today I tried the first sequence, circulation. I'm in love with Lorien!

First off, the production is lovely - professional but not slick. The clothing is nicely coordinated without looking costumey. The background is clean, the floors freshly mopped, everything is uncluttered yet it does not feel like a set.

The sequence begins with Lorien doing some gentle stretching on the floor. When she comes to seated, there is a fade and 3 more people appear onscreen, demoing variations. They stay on until she moves back down the floor for a final backlying twist and then savasana. I thought the camera work was nicely done and it was clear what the variations were without too much focus on them. I liked all the people - clean and scrubbed and camera ready, pretty but not models - approachable folks with pleasant expressions and relaxed alignment, not intense at all but still doing everything properly. Lorien's hubby makes an appearance!

She does some things standing, but there are variations for chair in those, as well as using a chair for balance support. The poses are in a viniyoga style, gently moving with each exhale and inhale rather than holding the postures static. I felt it was a very appropriate way to perform the poses for those who are in need of healing.

I thought as I was doing it how nice it would be if you were needing a variation to aspire to doing this video with less support one day, and how it was helpful in showing where you could be without making it at all feel like you should be doing it any way other than the way you needed to. I also thought for someone who had bad days and good days, it would be nice to have a familiar video you could put on and do something with whatever kind of day you were having.

Lorien's instructions were clear, with lots of space around them - well timed especially for those who might need to transition slowly from one pose to another, without feeling for an able bodied person that the timing was too slow. I really loved the feeling of being invited to this gentle pace. As an able bodied person, I felt it was a sweet practice - not one I'd do every day for myself, but one I will do on days when I need something gentle and nourishing.

My only critique is one that would be resolved on repeated viewings, which is that sometimes she will instruct a variation and then the person doing it is not shown right away, but still fairly quickly and soon enough I could figure out what was going on. Pretty minor problem.

I enjoyed the savasana and meditation and felt the instructions were well suited to people new to yoga - guided meditations that were not too talky but enough to know the DVD was still playing and enough to keep someone involved even if they were a little agitated or not used to relaxing. I found her voice soothing and even. I peeked sometimes and loved the footage of nature that was used in these sections. Again, not too slick. They did not feel like stock footage, but the photographer and editor found something original in sea, sky, and waterfall that were pleasant to watch and yet, not so compelling that I would not then be okay closing my eyes and just enjoying Lorien's voice. I liked the amount of time allotted to meditation and savasana. I can think of many elderly people and disabled that I would recommend this to, and have a friend with MS who is going to review it for me when I get done. She is in a wheelchair but I think has some mobility with her legs, and so I am going to assist her with the first set and see what it is like for her.

The menus are set up so you can skip right to meditation and relaxation if you wish. I only did the first music variation but the music was great - sitar I think. I liked it. I'm interested to try the other music track.

Great job - I'm proud to be a Kickstarter on this project!!! We need more DVDs like this!",1374019200,,3885,4.36237897648686
8589857,5,B00D69I4KA,"Lorien Neargarder has done an excellent job creating  a DVD for those who need a gentler and modified approach to the yoga practice.  The DVD is organized into 5 sections:  A practice for Circulation, Flexibility, Relaxation, Meditation, and a  Full yoga practice.

It is well sequenced, simply narrated, and beautifully demonstrated. In her video, Lorien uses  a good cross section of people to demonstrate the postures.  The inflexible elderly  gentleman,the woman with limited mobility(using a chair) and a person with balance issues. I especially loved the relaxation postures,so perfect for those needing to de-stress. Whatever your situation, this DVD clearly demonstrates that yoga can be adapted to meet any challenges, regardless of age,gender, or physical limitation.

As a yoga therapist and teacher,this DVD is perfect for beginners, seniors, those suffering from chronic pain and stress. I find it a valuable resource as a teacher, and would highly recommend it for those needing a more tailored and healing approach to yoga.",1371600000,4,1038,5.4375
