5391168,4,B00A6YR6BQ,"If you can only comprehend a great fight as one fought in a ring, then pass on this movie.  I really enjoyed it though despite the acting not being top notch.  Worth the watch.",1468800000,,176,4.147058823529412

5391173,5,B00A6YR6BQ,"I would give it a 4 1/2 because of the hispanic propaganda in it, but the title has more to do with the ""fight"" in his mind than in his MMA skills. It was an inspirational movie and that is why I gave it a 5. It was as good and inspiring as Rocky and the Karate Kid. It was funny that they had Martin Kove in it for the villain's advisor or sensei.",1467158400,,348,3.7162162162162162
5391174,1,B00A6YR6BQ,"Truly one of the worst films ever.  The Autistic kid didn't even fight in the ring like you may be led to believe.  The only famous actors in this film phoned it in and the rest were cheesy as can be.  Terrible film, don't waist your time.  Also at least one of the other reviewers I suspect to be related to an actor in the film so take the other high reviews with a grain of salt.",1434499200,2,382,3.9220779220779223
