849961,5,6304360983,"The first time I saw this movie, I was struck mostly by how much fun it was to watch. There is an offbeat, good-natured humour that softens the harshness of some of the settings and situations. (Much of the music is beautiful--it's by Robbie Robertson but he's not mentioned for it in the credits.) The story line is well-developed, with good transitions between two converging sub-plots. The basic plot is quite simple: two friends, Philbert Bono (Gary Farmer) and Buddy RedBow (A Martinez) take off on a road trip from a Montana Indian reservation to New Mexico in order to get RedBow's sister out of jail. Along the way they form a friendship, despite differences in personality and ways of looking at life.

After seeing the movie a second time, it became clear to me that much of what divides them in the beginning has to do with different styles of being or becoming a ""warrior."" Redbow is a Vietnam vet, as well as an activist who was present at the Wounded Knee conflict. He has a lot of anger about the depredations of white people as well as, I suspect, his Vietnam experience. His idea of carrying out a campaign has to do with fighting, guns, and discharging rage.

Philbert Bono, on the other hand, has never seen any combat action. He's a peaceful sort and regarded by others as an overweight buffoon. However, he's on a spiritual quest to gather power and become a spiritual warrior. His idea of carrying out a campaign has to do with getting the universal forces on his side. The dynamic tension between Philbert and Buddy define the second plot that runs parallel to the basic story line.

By the end of the film the two men have worked out a strong friendship and respectful working relationship, but it is clearly Philbert's approach to warriorship which ultimately carries more weight. The movie does have a few plot flaws, but they are insignificant compared to the interest evoked by Philbert Bono's journey, which is one of inner seeking combined with action in the outer world.",964656000,115,2001,4.695156695156695
849962,5,6304360983,"I rented it over a long, snowed-in Christmas weekend. A friend who's part Pamunkey was with me and told me I needed to see it. (no indigenous heritage in my blood, however) I watched it 3 times, and before turning it  in, fast-forwarded to the parts I really loved. I'll never forget it.

849963,5,6304360983,"I heard once that Kevin Costner considered making a sequel to ""Dances with Wolves"" showing the 'plight' of the modern Native Americans.  Don't bother Mr. Costner, it has already been done.  ""PowWow  Highway"" and the newer, equally as good ""Smoke Signals"" beat  you to it.",947462400,4,271,4.955555555555556
849964,5,6304360983,"This deceptively simple ""road buddy"" film was first introduced to me in 1991 when I was researching Native American culture for my 2 children so they would better understand their heritage. What a feast for  the eyes,ears and spirit! The score,some of it by Robbie Robertson (U2) is  a wonderfully effective backdrop that carries us into the world of one  Native American's unique vision quest.  One scene that comes to mind is  when the gentle Cheyenne named Philbert Bono (Gary Farmer) surveys a  dilapidated junk yard full of wrecked cars, but sees instead a herd of wild  ponies galloping on the plain. His choice of a ""pony"" is a broken  down Buick,yet to him it's as noble as any horse that ever ran. And so it  goes. A. Martinez is facinating as Buddy RedBow, Philbert's activist friend  who joins him on the road.  The film weaves together humor and  pathos,fantasy and realism for a story that entertains while it touches the  spirit and makes one feel,at least for a little while, as if life could  indeed be as Philbert sees it; and wouldn't that be a wonderful,magical  thing! I have not seen this film since 1992 and thought I might never  again. That Pow Wow Highway is available now is a dream come true. I cannot  recommend it highly enough!",927244800,48,1257,4.640909090909091

850101,2,6304360983,"Maybe 10% of the great novel by the unknown author David Seals. What a shame this eloquent epic of the struggle of indigenous peoples on the American Hemisphere, was reduced to a cliche ""Buddy Picture"". A bit of the humour is retained from the novel, but not much. Where is the comic allegory so reminiscent of John Steinbeck's 'Tortilla Flat'? Oh so politically correct, this is a whitewash of the truthful, vibrant world of Native Peoples on remote rural landscapes, far from the salons of New York and Hollywood where they must have felt they needed to clean up the reality on the Reservations, out of respect or guilt or something.

Gary Farmer reduces the quixotic character of Philbert to a sappy sweet stereotype. He's not real. Philbert is down and dirty, a drinker and girl-chaser. He wants to be a true warrior like his Cheyenne ancestors of yore, and so pursues his romantic dreams with a wonderful comic flourish that is more like Sancho Panzo than don Quixote, which Seals twists into an original take on the Cervantes classic from Steinbeck's own twist with Mexican paisanos also pretending to be King Arthur's knights. The twists and turns are brilliant and original, as Buddy Red Bird, a serious political activist in the tribe, joins Philbert on his Quest to rescue Buddy's wayward sister Bonnie from jail - another original version of Dulcinea as a flesh and blood Aldonza. Their beat up old Buick is a sway-backed steed christened 'Protector the War Pony', further extending the mock-heroic adventure along the roads of the modern American West from Montana to New Mexico. Philbert and Buddy, better portrayed by A Martinez of TV soap opera fame, are just Indian copies of the 'Rain Man' road characters.

The directing by Jonathan Wacks isn't bad, and the music of Robbie Robertson, Jesse Ed Davis, and Creedence Clearwater Revival lifts the journey a little bit, but what a disappointment. Reports are circulating there is even a TV series planned from Handmade Films. Let's hope it doesn't ignore the quixotic battles in Nicaragua, Hawaii, Texas, and British Columbia that also appear so eloquently in the book(s), giving some fair exposure to the  ongoing genocidal injustice done to Indigenos Dios.",1446249600,,2222,4.967741935483871

It is a buddy movie, a road trip move, a coming-of-age movie and a peek into modern ""NDN"" culture. A delightful cast, including A Martinez and a score by Robbie Robertson this movie belongs alongside ""Smoke Signals"" and ""Thunderheart.""

850414,4,6304360983,"I watched the film after having read the book, which is always an interesting experience. In this case, it was particularly interesting because, in many ways, I liked the film better than the book.
One of the reasons is that the film is tighter. Where the book is divided into many short episodes peppering the larger story of Philbert and Buddys journey to get Buddys sister out of jail, the film focuses on the main story, trying to make the most sense out of it. And actually, some episodes become clearer in the light of the larger story. Even some changes in the plot and in the characters reasons make the story stronger, in my opinion.

Where Philbert is basically the same character as in the book - a very naf guy, very trustful, oriented to tradition where he finds his strength and reasons - Buddy is quite a different character. Where in the book hes a bitter veteran that doesnt believe in anything or anyone anymore, in the film hes an activist, that believes in principles even if he doesnt believe in people (not even his people) anymore.
In a sense, this makes the relationship between the two characters more meaningful for me. It is the same relationship with the same evolution as in the book, at its core, but in the film it becomes sharper because of the sharper contrast between Philberts idealism/trust and Buddys mistrust/activism. The way their outlook on life converged in the evolving of the story takes up more sense, it comes across more effectively in the film, in my opinion.

Some episodes are missing from the film, which in a couple cases is a shame. But Jimmys and the veterans episode is still there, and Im very happy about it. Its one of the strongest episodes in the books as well as in the film. It is a very touchy episode with a brilliant Graham Green in the role of Jimmy.",1391472000,,1816,4.5504587155963305

The whole point is that you can be dirt poor and victimized by bullies and cowards and violent bums, and overcome the whole bunch living strong and enjoying being anti-fragile, instead of lying about whining and complaining and blaming the Man. It's also a fun story about American Indians (excuse me, Liberals: to be politically correct, ""Native Americans"". although when you told them what to be called, you never asked hem what they preferred to be called, and what they still are...INDIAN!).

850420,5,6304360983,"I loved the book and I love the movie--but in a different way. The movie changed a lot of the details, of course, but is true to the spirit of the book.

Buddy Red Bow (he was Red Bird in the book) is an activist in Lame Deer, MT, who opposes strip-mining the reservation, so the Bureau of Indian Affairs arranges to have his sister arrested in New Mexico in order to get him out of town. He and friend Philbert Bono set out in an old junker car called ""Protector"" to get her out of jail. The story is an engaging adventure filled with drama, detours, and plenty of humor. At first it appears that Philbert (Gary Farmer) is the one on a vision quest, but as the story unfolds, it turns out that the hot-headed Buddy is searching for meaning, too.

This is definitely magical realism, so if you're hoping for straight documentary about Native Americans, forget it. But the underlying foundation is firm: a thoughtful and multi-layered look at contemporary Indian life, interwoven with history, culture, legends, attitudes, and more. All the performances are stellar, from the main stars to the supporting children. (Watch for the book author's son.)

I felt really sad when Graham Greene appeared as a veteran but still capable of defending a friend.  Philbert named his brown ""pony"" car the right name, Protector.  Later the car would go down into a canyon and Philbert was thought to have been killed.  But he came up saying his pony had thrown him.  His pony protected him.
To some this would be a funny movie, to others it would seem silly in this modern day.  Not all Indian people are completely assimilated into the ""modern days"" culture.

The reasons to watch this film are: good story, good acting, good direction, good teachings, good environmental themes and teaching that we can all find peace and our own path - via connecting to our own spirit, with the help of ancestors, but not necessarily with the help of elders. It's producers are a respectful film company in the UK including former Beatle - George Harrison. This film is very timely with the current Idle NO More movement in Canada, and now the US, bringing attention to continuing treaty rights violations, corporate negotiations for resource rights, environmental protection and the power gathering, dancing and drumming - power of the Pow Wow. I like the stops along the Pow Wow highway at power gathering points, which mirrors the steps along each of our own life's road ... sometimes gathering power, sometimes giving power away. I write about serious lessons in this story, but life is funny, mysterious, unexplainable. This film tells the story of two people who need to become aware of why it is important for them to be close friends, and support each other - no questions asked-.",1363305600,,1236,4.862559241706161

Recognizable from the beginning is Gary Farmer who has a presence in many similar films including Smoke Signals, Skins, Sioux City, and Ghost Dog (not Native American-themed, but there Farmer is). Farmer's character is an amiable, spiritually-driven fellow with a deep appreciation of culture who does not mind smashing a safe if necessary. Hilarious. In contrast to Farmer's laid back character is that of A Martinez, a type-A driven hot-head who loses his temper and knocks down obstacles with determined impatience. The two men join on a road trip to check on a family member. Along the way, both men share their philosophies on how to live the life. While enjoyable, if just for the nostalgia of seeing A Martinez wreck his way across the screen, production values on the other movies named in this review may make the themes come across clearer.

850612,1,6304360983,"First of all, this movie was filmed in the early 80's and it's very obviously dated. But then a lot of very good, enduring movies are also dated. This, however, is not a very good, enduring movie.

Where it fails for me is in the screenplay, the directing and the acting. The screenplay seemed to be trying to take the movie through a poorly conceived maze with a director who was unaware of how to put effective story material together and actors who were just trying to get through their lines without screwing up.

It seems like they were trying to squeeze too many details into too short of a movie (87 minutes), so none of it comes across convincingly or with any entertainment value. Apart from a couple of performers, the acting is subpar at best and the plot elements seem just strewn together in a poorly thought out manner.

There are moments that are touching and rise above the mediocrity of the rest of the film, but not enough to save the film from being dragged down by it's many lessor elements. A significant conflict early in the film is left completely unresolved, and the plot and subplot have very weak development. There is almost no sense of character development, either. The one character that does have a measurable degree of development is very poorly established at the outset of the movie, and his acting is unfortunately one of the weakest performances of all. Perhaps that is why he wasn't given many lines. At the beginning of the movie we meet him in a bar where he sees a cheezy used-car commercial, after which he goes to some glorified junk yard and trades some bourbon and marijuana for a mangled car that he picks out without any forethought, after what appears to be a brief vision of ponies running. There is great opportunity for development and humor here, but it is never adequately explored in the movie. It is just one more plot element that seems to be there, just because.

This is a story that had great potential but in my opinion was ultimately undone by too many shortcomings.",1327881600,,2027,4.5911602209944755

850775,5,6304360983,"A road movie about two contemporary Cheyenne traveling down to New Mexico to spring a relative from prison. Buddy Red Bow (A. Martinez) is a young militant activist with a quick, angry temper. His gargantuan friend, Philbert (Gary Farmer), is a portrait of inner peace with an unlimited appetite to match. Together they mirror the political and spiritual aspects of modern Indian life. Buddy wants to protect his people from the forces of greed surrounding them (his sister is framed on a phony drug charge to lure him off the rez during a crucial tribal council vote). Philbert wants to find his soul-power as a Cheyenne warrior would have done in the old days (his battered auto is christened ""Protector""). The pragmatism of the former and the dreaminess of the other first clash but eventually compliment. The foundation of this story is as much about their past and present relationship as the adventure of getting to their destination and home again in one piece. This is the first mainstream movie that deals intelligently with current issues facing native peoples, ""Powwow"" got over-shadowed by the ""Dances With Wolves"" hoopla that followed on the heels of its release. A pity, too, because this is a far superior movie that achieved cult status for a time.

850777,5,6304360983,"""Powwow Highway"" is a tale of Native American life today, which is very third world.  The film is told via the contrasting stories of two Cheyenne men from Lame Deer, Montana.

Philbert Bono (Gary Farmer) is a big, gentle soul who trades his homegrown weed for a `war pony', a beat up old rustbucket of a car, to go out on a traditional vision quest.  He's going to achieve his medicine by gaining three tokens on the way.

The first thing he gains is a passenger, his high school best friend, Buddy RedBow (A. Martinez).  Buddy's been claiming his Native American heritage in a more traditional way.  A member of AIM (The American Indian Movement) he's been at Wounded Knee and has earned a Purple Heart in Vietnam.

Buddy had no plans to leave the rez.  There's a critical vote coming up on some land issues and he needs to be there to get his tribal members out to the polls, but his sister Bonnie RedBow ( Joannelle Nadine Romero) got arrested in New Mexico on a trumped up drug charge and he's the only one who can get her out of jail and back to her two very young kids.

The story's very much an `odd couple' pairing between the two men who take radically different approaches to solving problems.  RedBow is much more confrontational while the gentle Bono seeks ancient wisdom.

""Powwow Highway"" takes viewers across the gambit of emotions.  You cannot look upon the third world vistas of Native poverty without being moved to tears.  But, there are light moments where Philbert is telling ancient stories to his friends.

The soundtrack of this film is also excellent.  Robbie Robertson provides much of the music, which is well worth listening to.

My only wish would be to see some bios of the cast of this film.  A. Martinez, Gary Farmer, and the others are all people who I'd like to learn more about.

I found that the physical road travelled in this movie is similar to the travels of the Cheyenne as they were herded northward. That made the movie even more special.
What was interesting to me was the way the ""old ways"", spirituality, campaigning for rights, and militant revolt all played roles in the movie.  Each of us must always try to figure out ways to react to injustices done to us, and this movie offered several possibilities.
The plot could use some strengthening, but the movie was fun to watch, especially when one could fall into the director's point of view of the slightly mocking and yet truthful way of seeing the world from a contemporary Cheyenne viewpoint.

850881,4,6304360983,"I have a ritual of watching ""Powwow Highway"" once a year, usually around Christmas, as that is when the movie is set. The movie was produced by Beatle George Harrison's company, and I feel it offered many opportunities for Native American actors and musicians to get some notice.
As has been mentioned by other reviewers, actors Wes Studi (Heat; Mohicans) and Graham Greene (Thunderheart)were in the movie, as was activist, songwriter John Trudell. Pay some attention to the end-credits as they role and study the names. Many of them have done well since the 1989 filming.
As was mentioned elsewhere, musician Robbie Robertson (The Band), who has some Native American blood, provides some haunting and exciting songs from one of his solo albums (1987, I think). Native American fluist Carlos Nakai provides the opening musical sequence.  Floyd Westerman, whom I met before he died, was the voice of a Native American trucker from Sturgis, SD, talking to Gary Farmer (who plays the lead character Philbert), lamenting the fact that today's Indian youth don't know anything about their legends or heritage.
I felt the the movie really touched on some important issues: the polluting of the Western lands, improper diet (Philbert lived on grease, beer, sweets and carcinogens), powwows on reservations, problems on reservations, such as alcohol abuse, alcohol-related killings, substandard housing and conflicts between AIM and the big-bucks corporate types). Leonard Peltier, a real-life figure currently in prison, was mentioned, as was Wounded Knee and the grim results of Vietnam at a person level (e.g., a mind-scrambled ex-POW Graham Greene).
Two touching scenes feature the travelers visiting Fort Robinson in the snow (where hundreds of Indians died needlessly) and where Philbert shares an Indian story about a husband searching for juicy plums in the stream and falling in, when the actual plums were above him all the time, within his grasp.
If you can get past the really foul, four-letter language of the movie, which really detracted from the movie, it's a pretty good one that still stands up after 19 years.
On a personal note, I missed seeing actor Gary Farmer in New York City a  couple of years ago. I happened to be up there and had booked a flight home early that evening, meaning that I had to head out to the airport at about 3pm. I couldn't change the flight. That afternoon at one of the NYC museums, Farmer was scheduled to give a lecture on Powwow Highway after it aired. It would have been really great to attend that, as I've practically memorized the movie.

If you want a hero for your life then look no further than Philbert Bono. Gary Farmer's character is a gem.

The film is funny and sad at the same time, and even after nearly 20 years it speaks today with a voice perhaps stronger, and more poignant about how to walk through life...with beauty all around...and with a simple faith.

A Martinez and all the cast do a great job and the scenery of the big sky is superb. Dont miss the voice of Floyd Crow Westerman as the CB trucker. Or a cameo from the great John Trudell and another from Wes Studi and his shining smile!

The film tells a wonderful story and at the same time is able to drive home social/political issues that are still relevant today, without being too preachy.  There are some really poignant moments in this film but also a good amount of warm-hearted humor in the mix.  The two main characters alone make this movie, and the cinemetography helps capture the beauty of the land.

My only gripe with the DVD is that it doesn't have subtitles, but otherwise, I'm very happy with my purchase.  It might not be Oscar material, but this film is a must-see, in my opinion.",1168473600,2,687,4.508064516129032

Gary Farmer does an outstanding job in this movie, and gives a performance that makes you laugh and cry (sometimes at the same time). A Martinez plays his role with perfection and shows the frustration we all feel at times. I know that this has been said of many acting duos, but A Martinez and Gary Farmer are the Native American equivalent of Laurel and Hardy.",1149379200,3,511,4.333333333333333

At first I didn't want to see it because I loved SMOKE SIGNALS and thought it sounded similar.  It is and it isn't.  SMOKE SIGNALS is about boys; POW WOW HIGHWAY is about men although both are road and reservation stories.  Here  the road and reservation landscapes show you an America both wrenchingly painful and beautiful.  Don't miss it!!!  Philbert's slow and radiant smile is worth the price of admission alone.",1142035200,17,669,4.849557522123894
851040,5,6304360983,"I bought ""Pow Wow Highway"" because it was recommended as something I would like because I had purchased ""smoke signals"".  Normally, I don't bother with these recommendations from Amazon, but this time (on a whim) I bought ""Pow Wow Highway"" and I am so glad I did!

Being part Cherokee, it's hard to describe the mix of feelings this film brought out in me.  This feeling was only enhanced by the powerful use of Robbie Robertson's ""fallen angel"" in the scenes with Filbert.  Knowing the song very well, and knowing how it was used in the film, it brought tears to my eyes.  It made both the movie and the song that much more powerful.

I won't repeat what others here have done by outlining the plot, but I will say I agree with one reviewer: this film is a study in two ways of approaching being a warrior.  It's two warriors fighting the same fight in two different ways.  A totally incredible, breathtaking film.",1134172800,13,915,4.503030303030303
851041,5,6304360983,"If you like independent or foreign films in general, or if you are interested in a non-Hollywood film about American Indians (or Native Americans, if you prefer), I think you'll like this film.  It's one of those non-Hollywood films where the story is more about characters than it is about plot.  The plot is fairly simple -- two Cheyenne men -- best friends -- drive a broken down old car from the northern Wyoming reservation to New Mexico, because one man's sister calls him to tell him she's been arrested on a trumped up charge and is in jail.  He hasn't seen or heard from her in years, but her two children to consider, and she is his sister, so he has to get to Santa Fe to help her. This is coming at a bad time because a mining company is trying to get tribe approval on a contract that this man is opposing.

As noted, the real plot involves relationships, both between characters and between Native Americans vs. the dominant culture. Although both friends have a strong sense of their culture and people, one of the two friends is an easy going man who aspires to be a shaman and the other is an intense activist.  It's kind of the Odd Couple contrast, but much more sophisticated than that -- it's about how to be Native American in today's world.

The acting was very good and as other reviewers have commented, the sound track (U2 music) was perfect and enhanced the film.  If your idea of a great movie is one starring Sylvester Stallone or Tom Cruise, this may not be the film for you, but if you appreciate slower, simpler, thoughtful films, I recommend this.",1132185600,9,1579,4.461805555555555

  Philbert agrees to take Buddy in his ""pony"" and together they go on a traveling adventure.  Philbert has his own agenda.  He needs to find four tokens along the way so he can have good medicine and feel better.

851144,5,6304360983,"A wonderful movie with the ultimate message, in my view, that we each create the world in which we live. Put another way, you reap what you sow. The movie tells the story of the journey of two friends who view life from opposite poles. One (Martinez) is a rebel so bent beneath the weight of the chip on his shoulder he can hardly move. He greets the world with rage and impatience, reactionary and impulsive, and is frustrated by obstructions at every turn. The other (Farmer) lives in an entirly different world, where the spiritual infuses everyday life and the ""outer"" world is shaped by the ""inner""; where things happen at their own pace and as they are meant to; where stories hold wisdom and a Journey has meaning. Nothing could infuriate his friend more.
Martinez and Farmer are great as the travelling pair, and each brings a depth to their character that makes this much, much more than a simple ""buddies on the road"" movie. It reminds us, most importantly, that we can choose the path on which we walk, and that others have left guideposts along the way.</p>",988588800,16,1069,4.602094240837697

851146,5,6304360983,"There have been a plethora movies about Native Americans in recent years, which are a bit misleading. For instance, Sherman Alexie in his movie Smoke Signals, portrays us as half-minded individuals who never leave their reservations. Watching these sorts of movies, I feel somewhat offended. In addition, the Indians on Smoke Signals spoke with a southern Accent, which makes them sound retarded! Well, the makers of Pow Wow Highway didn't distort the facts, the way others movies have.
The protagonist is a political activist, named Sunny Redbow, who is protesting the installation of a mine(in all probability a pit-mine, which just destroys the beauty of an area) on the Lame Deer Indian Reservation. So the organization which is trying to build the mine, diverts Redbow's efforts by having the FBI(which was run in a despotic J. Edgar Hoover-esque way at the time), arrest his sister, Bonnie Redbow, on some bogus drug charge. After this, the movie takes a sort of ""48 hours"" buddy movie twist. To clarify, Sunny Redbow doesn't have the necessary means to get to Santa Fe, New Mexico(where Bonnie was arrested), so he asks his best friend, Philbert Bono, to give him a ride. Philbert Bono, who recently just acquired a vehicle, which he affectionately refers to as his ""War Pony"", agrees. And the interval between Sunny Redbow's departure from Lame Deer Montana, to the freeing of Bonnie Redbow in New Mexico, is probably the most hilarious few hours I have had the pleasure to visualize. They encounter members of the GOON squad(an anti-AIM organization funded by the US government, which intimidated red nationalists by scare tactics, such as drive-by shootings and physical assault), the Sante Fe police department, fellow Indians, and of course, the elements(i.e. the weather).
