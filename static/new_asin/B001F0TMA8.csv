8300218,5,B001F0TMA8,"One of the funnies films I've seen in forever, I keep remembering snippets and chuckle to myself throughout the day! Very real characters. Michelle Ehlen (writer, director,actor) SHINES!",1400284800,3,186,5.678571428571429
8300219,4,B001F0TMA8,"Out of work actress, Jamie Klein (Michelle Ehlen) has auditioned for a myriad of female roles, but is always rejected because she is too butch. Adding to her frustration is the fact that her roommate Lola's (Olivia Nix) cat `Howard' is a more successful actor than she is. When Jamie at last decides to audition for a male role and just be herself, she lands the part. The one condition of the role however, is that Jamie not reveal that she is in fact a woman.

Crazy mishaps ensue as Jamie takes on her new role as `Steve' and inadvertently attracts the affections of straight co-star Jill (Tiffany Anne Carrin). In an ironic twist, Jamie finds herself unintentionally entering into a `straight' relationship when she begins dating Jill who is unaware of Jamie's real gender.

Director/producer/writer/star Michelle Ehlen brings to the screen a witty and satirical look at gender roles, stereotypes, and assumptions. `Butch Jamie' is a wonderfully fun and upbeat film that will keep you laughing all the way through.

The multi-talented Michelle Ehlen is incredibly comical as Jamie, unwittingly caught in a web of deception. Olivia Nix is hilarious as Jamie's roommate Lola and owner of `superstar' cat actor `Howard'.

8300220,5,B001F0TMA8,"This was hands-down, one of the funniest movies I saw at the Frameline Film Festival in San Francisco a couple years ago. It features real people - not highly polished stereotypical Hollywood stars - and some real situations, along with some concocted exaggerated situations that just cracked me up. It was a very likable story and I highly recommend it.",1316563200,3,354,4.916666666666667
