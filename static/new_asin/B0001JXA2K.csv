8013274,5,B0001JXA2K,"This film is tragic and amazing. It shows you the lives of one of the greatest animals-The Mountain Gorilla. It talks about Dian Fossey and her gorillas who have survived even after her own death. The silverback Peanuts, who Dian knew, died of a lung infection(possibly pneomnonia). The video is great for those who love gorillas.",1198195200,,330,4.910714285714286
