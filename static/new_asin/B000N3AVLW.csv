2753293,4,B000N3AVLW,"On November 14, 1970, an airplane carrying the Marshall University football team, coaches, and many prominent supporters crashed with all aboard killed.  This movie portrays what happened to those left behind and how they rose from the ashes of this disaster and resurrected the football team.

Since everyone knows what is in store, the first part of the movie is especially poignant as you meet the players and know their lives are destined to end far too early.  What a typical moviegoer might not be familiar with is the character of Jack Lengyel, a man who was the only one willing to come forward and try to salvage the football program.  Matthew McMcConaughey gives a stirring performance as Coach Lengyel as does Matthew Fox as Red Dawson, the assistant coach who gives up his seat at the last minute to another person.  The guilt of being a survivor eats at him and nearly destroys his life.

Emotional, uplifting, and enjoyable....this movie manages to honor those who died and those who picked up the pieces and restored pride to Marshall.",1167609600,90,1050,4.837988826815643
2753294,3,B000N3AVLW,"DISCLAIMER: Okay, I have to admit to you straight up that the ONLY reason I went to see this movie (in the theater) was because I had recently seen (& fallen deeply in love with) the movie ""Facing The Giants"" & I was in desperate need of another football movie fix ...

That said, I also have to admit that this movie IS well-made & the acting IS excellent & the music IS swell & I therefore lay before you now all the good things that could possibly be said about a movie, yadda, yadda, yadda, blah, blah, blah, ad infinitum, etc. I mean, it's everything that a movie should be ...

& less.

Whoops. Okay, because, hello? Like I said, I had gone to see ""Facing The Giants"" BEFORE seeing ""We Are Marshall"" & so I couldn't help but watch the entire movie & think about how SPIRITUALLY BANKRUPT ""We Are Marshall"" was compared with a movie like ""Facing The Giants"" ...

Because (without giving anything away) all you have to do is compare the 2 COMPLETELY DIFFERENT ATTITUDES TOWARD WINNING & you will see what I mean ...

& that is just one of many items that could (& probably should) be compared between the 2 movies ...

Which is also why (& I'm writing the rest of this review for mature Christians) I think that it would be worthwhile for churches/Bible studies/etc. to show both movies to perhaps their teens &/or movie buffs &/or seekers, etc. & have in-depth discussions afterwards ...

&, yes, I realize that ""We Are Marshall"" has bleepable moments (which is why I would show it first &/or show an edited copy), but I think that is also one of the many reasons why it would be an excellent movie to compare & contrast with ""Facing The Giants"" ...

Why not have a little ""film festival"" &/or ""movie marathon"" to spark some meaningful dialogue inside the church? Because God knows people are going to be discussing them OUTSIDE the church anyway ...",1167264000,13,1854,4.448377581120944
2753295,5,B000N3AVLW,"When the Marshall plane crashed killing 75 people, including 39 members of the Marshall football team, on November 14, 1970, I had been in country for a month and a few days, so even though I heard of the tragedy, I was a bit pre-occupied at the time to give it much thought. Now, 36 years later, I've been able to catch up on this piece of history.

WE ARE MARSHALL is a poignant story of the tragedy and how it affected so many lives. The most glaring thing that this movie accomplishes is to portray how the event was not limited to the families of those who perished, but stirred a whole campus, a whole community, and even a whole country, and how that same tragedy even touches the lives of people today through the Marshall University legacy.

The movie itself is very well cast and historically accurate. I believe the profound, underlying message here, as displayed over and over in life, is that humanity is at it's best when situations are at their worst. That same holds true whether facing battle situations, terrorists attacks, or the loss of a college football team. Unlike so many events that Hollywood feels the need to add its own brand of romance, drama or heroics, the producers were able to present the story accurately without the need for embellishment.

This is not an easy movie to watch and will send the viewer on an emotional roller-coaster, but is definitely worth the ride. The acting is good, the soundtrack is good, the script is good, even the wardrobe is good, although McConaughey and Fox should have shaved. In 1970, men either had beards or they were clean shaven. The three-day stubble look didn't come along until a decade later. But if that's the only thing I can find wrong with this film, then I have to give it my highest recommendation.",1167264000,35,1780,4.591194968553459
2753296,5,B000N3AVLW,"Marshall football made the biggest comeback in sports history...from ashes to glory.  The storyline is predictable because its a true story...and its respectful to share both the hardship and the tremendous heart of those who were able to carry on and take the field the next season.  Players, coaches & a whole town had to come together to save this program and honor those who perished.  It was a quest that proved successful in the long run, as Marshall football went on to be the most winning NCAA Division I football program of the 1990's.  Imagine a story about a athlete program, a town, a university...that had to rebound from the nation's worst sports tragedy.  It's a great story and a powerful movie.  It's one of the most inspiring movies you will ever see.  Enjoy!  We are...",1166918400,22,788,4.700729927007299
2753297,5,B000N3AVLW,"WE ARE MARSHALL's Director, McG, managed to portray the personality of Huntington, WV & its intimate relationship with Marshall Univeristy true to the time period of the event: 1970. The story could be construed as corny if it was anything but a true historical reflection of the tragedy as it unfolded in that time and cultural period. McConaughey has stretched to a higher acting level in his off beat character as Coach Lengyel.

As part of the Huntington Community working with Marshall University, I found the film captured the cultural context of Huntington's appalchian personality accurately. Coach Lengyel's movie character is an enjoyable, quirky departure from the more austere historical figure and legitimately nurtures the film's landscape to broaden audience appeal for those unfamiliar with history's greatest sport's tragedy.  For a historical documentary of the event, see ""Ashes to Glory."" For a feel good experience see ""WE ARE...MARSHALL!""",1166745600,16,960,5.47972972972973

2753328,5,B000N3AVLW,"I remember clearly when this tragedy occurred. At the time I wondered how any town, college or individual could survive such an event. This movie is a triumphant of the human spirit on many levels, and the heartbreak simply can't be overcome by some even with being able to get past the tragedy on a day to day basis.
An entire football team, coaching staff and athletic department is wiped out in a single plane crash. The team is from a Division II school with a small enrollment, so the pain is almost beyond comprehension. One of the surviving team members who was injured and not on the fateful trip becomes the driving force to reinstate football at Marshall.
How the college, town and people overcame their grief to restore the heritage of success with Marshall football is played out with poignancy and has the viewer cheering them on. I highly recommend this movie for both the historical content and for how the key figures never wavered in their efforts to rebuild. This is an excellent motivational template.",1483228800,2,1020,4.735955056179775

Every time I hear Marshall University I think of all it went through as well as the years, tears and struggle it took to rebuild Marshall's football team. I admire the community for its resolve to support the University after such a heart wrenching tragedy of loosing it's players, coaches, and loved ones in that accident. I would recommend this movie to all.",1480982400,,633,4.601769911504425

2753348,2,B000N3AVLW,"The movie is inspiring, a story of a team, college, and town healing after an unfathomable tragedy.  The problem I had was the language.  Now, I certainly never expected a story mostly focusing on a football team to sound like a Sunday sermon, but there is a LOT more foul language and profanity than I am willing to excuse as football language.  If you have a TV Guard, that might catch most of it.  (I don't know since I don't have one.  I try to limit my watching to things that wouldn't need it.)

Everybody has their own conscience, but I cannot in good conscience recommend this movie, at least not unfiltered. . . which is really sad since I enjoyed the story line.",1475280000,,672,4.379032258064516

2753561,4,B000N3AVLW,"On November 14, 1970, one of the worst disasters ever to befall a sports program in the United States occurred when a chartered Douglas DC-9 airliner carrying the Marshall University football team crashed in Huntington, West Virginia. All 75 people on the aircraft, including 37 team members, 8 coaches, and 25 team boosters, perished in the accident.

The plane crash devastated both Marshall University and Huntington, the city in which the school is located. Grief ran particularly deep throughout the university and city, and recovery from the disaster was especially slow and painful. In the aftermath of the tragedy, the university almost discontinued its football program, but eventually decided to field a team for the 1971-72 season. Jack Lengyel was hired to become Marshall's new head football coach, and was tasked with rebuilding from scratch the school's football program.

In 2006, Warner Brothers released ""We Are Marshall,"" an excellent film that dramatizes the events of November 14, 1970, and their aftermath. Starring Matthew McConaughey, Matthew Fox, Anthony Mackie, Kate Mara, and Ian McShane, and directed by McG, ""We Are Marshall"" is an excellent film that shows how the people of Marshall University and Huntington, West Virginia were able to persevere and begin rebuilding their lives in the wake of unspeakable calamity.

""We Are Marshall"" is a film that must have taken a lot of courage to make, dealing as it does with a profound tragedy that still affects Marshall University and its surrounding community four decades later. ""We Are Marshall"" tackles its difficult subject matter with good taste, sensitivity, and restraint, while at the same time allowing viewers to understand the full force and impact of the events portrayed.

The film's ensemble cast has much to do with this success. Matthew McConaughey plays Jack Lengyel, the coach who confronts the situation at hand without pretense, but with a certain compassionate toughness; Matthew Fox as Red Dawson, and Anthony Mackie as Nate Ruffin are two men who set aside their grief and guilt for the greater good of the team; David Strathairn is the college president with a distaste for football, who passionately but reluctantly fights for the program's survival; and Ian McShane and Kate Mara portray two fictional community members trying to overcome bitterness as they come to grips with their personal loss. It all adds up to an appropriately low-key approach that allows viewers to understand and feel something of what it must have been like during those tragic days in 1970 and 1971.

""We Are Marshall"" is a very good sports movie that successfully portrays the horrific tragedy that suddenly befell a university and its surrounding community. Poignant and dramatic, this remarkable film still manages to maintain a feeling of optimism in the midst of catastrophe. Highly recommended.",1422144000,4,2879,5.25

2753716,5,B000N3AVLW,"This is a thriller even though you sort of know how it comes out in the end, ie., that the school and the football program survive, otherwise they would not have made the movie.  The thrill is in seeing how Coach Lengyel engineers a miracle using his indirect, low key, home-spun, yet highly intense, never-say-die manner.  He is a study in contradictions and an inspiration to boot.  The story of We are Marshall is filled with emotional highs and lows, incredible sadness, and incredible resilience.  I highly recommend it to all, whether you are a football fan or not.",1393891200,,571,4.737373737373737

Outside of West Virginia, it became a lost story for years.  I am glad the film rekindled that memory for me, because the tale of what happened to the town of Huntington, and Marshall University, is one that should never be forgotten.  The film depicts the tragedy very respectfully, as the plane crash is not actually shown.  What takes place afterward is a story of rebuilding, healing, and inspiration, not only in terms of football but of life in general.  Everyone reacts differently to movies, and this one really struck an emotional chord with both my wife and myself, so much so that after seeing it we became Thundering Herd fans.  Since the film came out we have traveled to Huntington annually to pay respects and see a game, and based upon our experiences in doing so we can attest to the fact that the good folks of that town are as warm and hospitable as they are depicted on the screen.  We can also attest that the tragedy of November 14, 1970 still resonates greatly with those people today.

It's a good story but I thought they should have shown a little more of the people who would later go down in that plane so we could feel more of the loss that the towns people felt.

Then, on the way home from a football game, the team flight went down and burned killing most of the team, the boosters, and the staff.  the rest of the film covers the search for a new coach and settled on one man who started from scratch with a couple of players and a few staff members. It also dealt with the surviving friends and families showing one young woman who left town with her fiancees engagement ring. His father gave4 it to her as he had no other heirs and wanted it to remind here of their love. the focus went to the meeting on whether to rebuild the team or to drop out of their conference. the students gathered outside the meeting building and chanted ""WE ARE MARSHALL""  until they voted to restart the season and the team.

2753875,3,B000N3AVLW,"The film ""We Are Marshall"" was apparently panned by critics at least according to the reviews on Amazon's web site, but gained a substantial fan following particularly for Matthew Mcconoughay's performance. As it was on special I bought the DVD. My conclusion: I can see why the critics panned it, and also why there is a fan following. The movie is flawed but the sincerity of the performances and the material itself give it a certain attraction - the makers of this movie so much want you to like it that I did to an extent.
The story is affecting. Marshall University lost its entire team and all but one of its coaches in a plane crash. Only two of the team remained - the ones that did not go on the away trip; ""We are Marshall"" tracks the immediate aftermath up to the first two games after that crash.
The movie takes too long to get started and the four plot lines are are slow in developing and then are rushed at the end as all the loose ends are tied up too quickly. Tne Matthew Fox character never solidifies and Ian MacShane does a yeoman's job with a one-dimensional chracter whose heartbreak is never resolved.
But yet there is a gritty realism to the movie and this is part and parcel of its appeal as well as its weakness. In real life of course things are not resolved but it makes an unsatisfactory ending.",1346803200,,1326,4.394308943089431

2753877,5,B000N3AVLW,"The setting is Huntington, West Virginia, the year 1970 and a tragice event shocked the students, faculty and everyone involved with Marshall University as almost the entire football team, players and coaching staff is killed in a plane crash. The mood is solemn as the townsfolk can't seem to shake this bad feeling that the tragedy put upon this town and the school.

As the immediate future of the Marshall football program is unknown, a man named Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey ""Sahara"") decides to step in and become the coach of the team just months after this event took place. He takes the charge of coaching a bunch of inexperienced players who basically have zero chance to win any games for the upcoming season. But that doesn't mean they won't try their best, grow as human beings and become men on the field and in life.

Sports movies themselves are a mixed bag, usually the cliches can wear down even the coolest of sports moments the filmmakers capture, but with ""We Are Marshall"" it is truly one of the best modern sports movies. The football action is quite well done, the acting especially by McConaughey is very convincing and while yes it is cliche and anyone who knows the story knows the team didn't do well, it is easily one of the most touching and inspiring sports flicks I've seen in quite some time.

The opening scenes with the football game vs. East Carolina and those leading to and immediately after the crash do set the tone for the rest of the movie. At least director McG (The Charlie's Angel's movies) actually doesn't go heavy handed with anything or over the top like some of his previous directing ventures. One of the other good performances in this flick is by David Strathairn (""Good Night & Good Luck"") who always shines with this type of material.

I agree with what most people have said after viewing this, that if you're not inspired by this film then there's something wrong with you. You don't even have to be a sports fan to enjoy this, its really that good, much like ""The Blind Side"" as it mixes drama/real life tragedy with sports as a backdrop. **** out of 4 stars.",1345939200,,2122,4.620689655172414
2753878,3,B000N3AVLW,"It's bad enough when your movie enjoyment is staved off by forced viewing of trailers for other movies.  Judging by most of the ads they thought only men would watch this movie.  From hockey to football to even a lengthy promotion for the state of West Virginia, you must endure it all while the menu is inoperable and the movie is anything but the priority of this dvd.  I'd love to put whoever decided to force all that drivel on us into a football preseason training camp as the practice dummy!

Read the other reviews for more about the movie in detail.  I agree with them all.  The casting is excellent and the acting captivating.  Suffice it to say I enjoyed the movie enough to buy the dvd after having rented it.

2753896,5,B000N3AVLW,"Every once in a while I visit a nearby Ross Clothes For Less Store to look through their ultra-bargain DVD bin. You might be amazed at what you can sometimes find there. It's an interesting way to chose late night movies, if you know what you're doing. This time I picked out three movies and one was ""We Are Marshall"" (Full Screen Edition). It was the tragic story of a late 1970 plane crash killing 75 people, most of whom were the Marshall University football team and coaches on their way back from a game with East Carolina University. The crash wiped out almost the entire football program.

I've been a college football follower ever since my undergraduate days at the University of Colorado and I remember the tragic crash well. I also remember that Marshall decided to rebuild the program and have a team playing the regular schedule the following 1971 season. Most people would have said it was impossible. Well, I knew nothing of the details, but they did it and even managed to win a couple games. This movie attempts to document that rebuilding feat. It's part fiction and part fact. I suppose you could call it a docudrama. It's a good movie, without question! You might best understand it if you knew a little about football, but it's not really necessary to have any great depth. It's a very tragic story, but is very uplifting at the same time. The acting is good. The story is well done. The photography is excellent. For your own comfort, I'd suggest that you have a box of tissues handy while viewing it.

2753900,3,B000N3AVLW,"With McCounaghey and Ian McShane, this should have been a homerun, or at least a triple. Instead it was a double.

Okay, stupid baseball references aside, the story is compelling enough. The setting was done real well and a lot of the supporting acting was great. The plot either got short on material at the point the reformed team is playing again or the screenwriter lacked in the delivery of a climactic ending. Also, worth mentioning is McConaughey does a poor job evoking emotional support, in the role of the fill-in football coach. He is just too damn quirky to be the underdog hero. McShane is great, though...

As you know, the movie is based on the tragic plane crash that wipes out the entire Marshall University football program. The resulting emotions, survivor guilt etc., plague the entire town, never mind the student body. Then, the team is reformed due to the enthusiasm of a replacement coach. Up to this point, the movie is very good. Then, as you would expect, the emotions should build until the knockout punch is delivered. It never happens. Several attempts are made to ratchet the anxiety, such as the formulaic cemetery scene, but it just seems to fizzle. The eventual team win just fizzles too. It's too bad.

Anyway, this is a rental, not a purchase. It just isn't the quality of movie that you will want to watch repeatedly, like Remember the Titans or Rudy.",1325635200,,1388,4.7272727272727275

2753902,5,B000N3AVLW,"I suppose to the general viewer ""We Are Marshall"" could be mistaken for just another football movie with a Sisyphean task (push rock up the hill guy) of overcoming both monumental tragedy and relentless adversity.  I believe one such reviewer called it a ""tired plot.""

To those wise enough to recogize what is happening though, the movie is about how a town, a university, and many individuals experienced the five stages of grief as a result of the true event that killed a university football team and many community leaders.  The five states of grief are (1) denial and isolation, (2) Anger, (3)Bargaining, (4) Depression, and (5) Acceptance.  I thought the film makers did an incredible job of showing how each stage was dealt with both individually and communally.

Tied into the grief recovery of all involved is the effort of one outsider coach who believes he can help everyone through the process, accepting the challenge of adversity he knew would be universally omnipresent.  His belief, effort, and result is truly inspirational.

""Grief is messy......It can make you do things you'll regret.""  It is for that reason anyone walking the path of grief from the loss of a loved one to the loss of a job should watch the movie.  Someone once said ""when you lose, don't lose the lesson.""  An entire town and university suffered a terrible loss, but the lessons are numerous and beautiful in ""We Are Marshall.""

It's a film that when it is over, you're glad you watched it. That's a good endorsement right there.

Matthew McConaughey's role as head coach ""Jack Lengyel"" was a little goofy. I question whether the real coach was this ""quirky,"" but I'm not complaining because it made ""Lengyel"" -- in the film - a lot of fun to watch. The screenwriters probably did that for just for that purpose, and it worked.  The one football game featured is a little hokey, too, but I didn't say the movie is great, just entertaining and inspiring, which is good enough for me.

2753929,5,B000N3AVLW,"There are a lot of times when great leadership has mattered. In West Virginia a sports program is more than sports. It is the life blood of a people.
It's the embodiment, at its best, of the people of a state that have suffered under the indignity, and the denigration of supplying to this nation with her blood and toil her energy ""needs"" (seemingly to expand to this then ungrateful bloated beast.) It is in the poverty of West Virginia, in her beautiful hills,  I was able to grow up and be ever free in the calm simple majesty of a place that has had to bear the brunt too often of national mocking. But not really on a fair field of play.  It's funny how much she's shown us really in her sports.

My Dad, I recall him talking to me during this game shown here at film's culmination, the game the ""day after."" As Marshall ""went on."" In his way saying to me, this was a great tragedy of these boys, it was wordless. So many lost, so long ago, lost on an ill fated flight, all lost Marshall players. In this film that awful time (and how it was faced) is immortalized. I actually looked for myself in the footage of a game re-enacted, laughing at the mistake of that after a few moments of great family teasing. The game shown is symbolic of them putting things back together and finding a way to go on through the leadership of this good coach that went into this and tried.

I grew up able (because of Coach Catlett) to meet and enjoy some awesome WVU games and people in her sports halls of fame. Not understanding fully then how cool it was for me.
Nothing was quite like the loss of the Marshall team, even very young we understood that was something that stopped a state in its tracks, potentially very numbing. Hearing of this movie I thought that I'd never watch it. How could anyone? I don't know how those from that time intimately involved made it through then or now dry eyed. It was so tear jerking.

But I did just finish the game. Opps, movie.  I am taken with what it says to us, shows of leadership. We face times now that West Virginians have long known.

Now too in differing circumstances we Need those able to put aside their enrichment to make lives matter, focus on dreams that are not symbolized with getting the next Humveee, to focus on the heart. That place, Marshall has real heart. My half-sister went there, just graduating. It is a good school, and this is a winner film about the rebuilding of their team after a catastrophic loss. I can't believe it was made.

They went forward. Showing the people of that time for who they were in the moment. It gives credits many just didn't give then to many good people. And could it really ever say enough about that loss?

It took me back. It was acted, filmed, made as a tribute and it captures the people and the times. I'm glad here before the Superbowl I saw it.
It lifted me up on a day I find I cannot get out of bed for wishing we could channel this kind of spirit, to the place I love, my saddening world.

I knew nothing of the tragedy at Marshall in the early 70's, so this was all new to me and quite frankly it made all the more powerful.  The movie of course begins with the tragedy and then builds on the aftermath and fallout.

2753946,5,B000N3AVLW,"This movie is based on a true story.  In 1971, a charter plane carrying the entire Marshall university football team + the coaching staff and trainers crashed.  There were no survivors.  It was a tragedy that shook the entire nation in a way that the United State would not experience again until the shootings @ VA Tech a few yrs ago.

In the aftermath, there was much consternation as to whether Marshall would even continue its football program - at least in the near-term.  Enter an eccentric coach (played brilliantly by Matthew McConaughey) who finds that he must literally rebuild a football program.  I'm not talking a typical rebuilding program where a coach takes over  a losing program & has very few good players to work with.  Rather, I'm talking about rebuilding a program which lacks the actual PLAYERS.

Even more importantly, the new coach is tasked with lifting the spirits of the team, the students of the university & the entire town of Huntington, West Virginia.  In this way, this is one of those films in which sports can transcend the travails of life & become a metaphor.

This is one of the more powerful sports movies I've ever seen.

2753947,5,B000N3AVLW,"Based on a true story, this movie is about a town healing from a shocking tradegy where 65 people were killed in a plane crash.  People wanted hope and hope came in the form of football.  Football unified the community, gave sense of purpose, a team too believe in, an escape from the drudger of steel production, and a wholesome sense of value.  The President convinced the NCAA to play freshmen, a move that would lead to his dismisal. The President finds a coach willing to rebuild the team.

The story is not about winning, or building a fearsome reputation, or finding superstar players.  The WV football team was below average in stats and win/loss, but big on heart, courage, and determination. A senior determined to play despite a shoulder injury - and being told, he did enough. A belief in the Power I formation, theory not practice.  No big payoff leading to a championship, but the restoration of a dream.  The story is about determination, dreaming of greatness, compassion during loss, and the desire too raise a family.

The higher quality dreams of escaping to California, return of an engagement ring, loss of a son, leaving small town culture, and moving forward symbolizes the thrust of the movie.",1221782400,,1217,4.7894736842105265
2753948,3,B000N3AVLW,"When you strip away the sentiment that clouds this movie (due to the fact that the horrific events serving as the films foundation are true) then you start to see this film for what it is; a generic sports film.  There is absolutely nothing special and or new to separate this film from the rest of the pack, and honestly it is no where near as good as most other sports related dramas.  Yes, it has an emotional wallop that will endear this film to a lot of people, but if the title of `true story' were taken away then this film would have no where near the fan base it has now.

The film focuses on the town of Marshall West Virginia.  When the entire football team (minus a few players) dies in a horrific plane crash an aspiring football coach from out of town comes down to pick up the pieces of the now barely there football team.  Jack Lengyel faces a lot of opposition in his attempt to rebuild the Marshall Football team, but his efforts are not in vain for it is through the power of the game that the town is able to heal wounds and unite once again.

Like I said, not much separates this film from any other random sports drama out there, and there are a lot of them.  I lacks the emotional impact that it could have had, even with the devastating circumstances that litter the films every frame.  In all honestly I found `Friday Night Lights' to have a much stronger emotional connection to the audience than this film.  The sub-plot involving the father and ex-fianc of one of the deceased is rather touching and heartbreaking, but overall the film cannot reach the heights it is so desperately trying to grasp.

The acting is hit or miss for me.  Matthew McConaughey is seriously one of the worst actors making money today.  I never really understood his appeal (aside from his body).  I mean, why is he booking big ticket movies?  He pulls off the same semi-charming performance in each film yet never manages to make his performance `mean' anything.  This is probably his best `acting' performance to date; sadly it is also his most annoying.  He actually creates a character here but the character he creates is one I wish he had never attempted.  The way he walks, talks and interacts with others is painful to watch.  Matthew Fox is rather boring here, as is Strathairn, and Anthony Mackie is just a really bad actor.  I haven't seen him do anything noteworthy yet (aside from getting his face smashed in by Freeman in `Million Dollar Baby').  The two actors who actually pull their weight here are Kate Mara and Ian McShane, but even they lack consistency.  At times Mara's pain comes off forced and McShane's reclusive nature plays on the clichd, but in the end they make a much deeper connection to the audience than anyone else involved with the project.

I won't say that `We Are Marshall' is a bad film, but I must declare it is far from a great one.  Fact remains that this is nothing new and thus should not be regarded as such.  It feels very familiar because it pays close heed to follow the same formula almost every sports related drama uses.  If you want to watch a film about the town of Marshall and the tragedy that befell them then by all means, watch this film; but if you are just looking for a sports film then you are bound to find more satisfying fare elsewhere.",1221436800,4,3305,4.441127694859039
2753949,5,B000N3AVLW,"At its core, this film tells the story of the Marshall College football program of 1971, when a year earlier nearly the entire team was wiped out in a plane crash and thus the entire team had to be rebuilt.  Sadly, this is a true story, and this film is able to capture the essence of the entire story in two ways:

First, not only is the building of the football team extremely difficult, but more importantly was the rebuilding of the community after the tragedy, and director McG captured that emotional period brilliantly, showing how members of the school and community grappled with the issue of putting a team on the field (and risk dredging up bad memories) or scrapping the football program altogether.  While some people yearn to see the green and white colors on the playing field, others are haunted by those memories and would prefer to keep them at an arms length, the conflict that provides the emotional punch to the film.

Just as important, however, is the quality of the acting.  Matthew McConaughey breaks away from his traditional ""brainless"" or ""hunk"" movie roles to portray Coach Jack Lengyl, who brought football back to Marshall.  McConaughey nails this role, bringing the enigmatic coach to life.  Also impressive is Kata Mara in the role of Annie Cantrell, whose personal struggles mirror the struggles of the entire community.  However, it is Matthew Fox (""Jack"" of LOST fame) who really steals the show.  Playing a Marshall coach not on the doomed plane, Fox is brilliant in portraying the conflicting emotions (relief, sorrow, regret, anger, guilt, etc.) that arise from such a complicated, emotional situation.  It has been a long time since I have seen an actor be so good at playing emotionally conflicted characters.

Overall, this is a very inspirational, yet also quite sorrowful film that will take you on an emotional rollercoaster.  Yet, even in its most emotional moments, there always seems to exist a light at the end of the tunnel, or a way that things can start to be okay after such a tragedy.  Though you likely already know how the situation turned out, that knowledge will not stop you for rooting on the Marshall boys all the same!",1219449600,,2180,4.8123324396782845

2753962,5,B000N3AVLW,"I had never heard of Marshall University until that chartered plane went down in the West Virginia foothills in the autumn of 1970.  I recall how very sad I was upon hearing of this tragedy, and I wondered how the school--how the town that nurtured it--would recover. . .or if it would ever recover.  So when I learned of this film, I became intrigued; either WE ARE MARSHALL would fall flat on its face as superficial and phony, or it would effectively pay a poignant, lasting tribute to the school, to Huntington, and to those who played a part in restoring its football program.

I've never seen any footage of head coach Jack Lengyel, but based on Matthew McConaughey's quirky, eccentric behavior in his portrayal of the man called upon to rebuild Marshall's program, Lengyel is clearly one in a million.  McConaughey is funny, a tad odd, and wonderfully inspiring; he is totally believable as a head coach working through the trials and tribulations of putting together a staff, hanging on to the few players who didn't make the fateful trip, and recruiting dozens of new players.  I've seen several films featuring this actor, and this is by far his best role.

Yet WE ARE MARSHALL features several exceptional performances, including Anthony Mackie as cornerback and team captain Nate Ruffin.  Missing the ill-fated flight due to injury, Nate was devastated by the tragedy, yet determined to lead the fight to get another team back on the field as soon as possible.  Also noteworthy is David Straithairn as humble, soft-spoken school President Don Dedmon, a man just a bit in over his head in dealing with the NCAA for permission to allow freshmen to play.  Ian McShane and Matthew Fox cause a few tears to fall, too.

This film brings back the Seventies in all its vibrant, gaudy colors, augmented by a slick musical score that restores an avalanche of memories.  And finally, WE ARE MARSHALL boasts one of the most moving cinematic scenes ever--when Marshall's student body confronts a board of governors voting to suspend the football program.  You will really feel chills racing up and down your spine, and a lump in your throat, yet compelled to stand up and cheer this inspirational, exceptional movie.

2753963,4,B000N3AVLW,"I highly recommend watching this beautiful, inspiring and incredibly sad film about a town in West Virginia that lost its college football team and most of the coaches in a horrific plane crash and how an outsider helped them rebuild and keep the spirits of the lost players alive.

In 1970, after losing a game to an East Carolina University, the Thundering Herd boarded their chartered plane to head home. Assistant Coach Red Dawson gave up his seat so one of the team's recruiters could get home to see his granddaughter's recital. They were so close to home and I'm not really sure from watching the film why but the plane crash landed into an inferno a mile short of the runway. There were no survivors. Seventy-five people died.

Many thought that was the end of the football program at Marshall University but a union of students and townspeople convinced President Dedmon he had to give it a go at building up a team that meant so much to this small town. His first job was to find a new coach but no one wanted to take on what was really a no-win situation. Then one day he receives a call from Jack Lengyel, a strange but honest coach from an obscure town who wanted to see what he could do to help the people of Huntington heal. With the help of surviving coach Red Dawson and the remaining senior players they set about building up a team from nothing.

I would have liked to learned more about the past and replacement players. I felt the only real player we got to know was Nate Ruffin the Captain. But I understand there's only so much that can be committed to a 1 1/2 - 2 hour film. Regardless it is still highly charged with emotion and you are sure to be cheering from within: We are, Marshall!

This film is about hope, grieving, rebuilding and the unity of a town brought together by the sport of football. Notable performances include Matthew Mcconaughey as Coach Jack Lengyel, Matthew Fox as Coach Red Dawson, David Strathairn as President Dedmon, Anthony Mackie as Nate Ruffin and Kate Mara as Annie Cantrell (who also affectionately narrates).",1209859200,2,2067,4.548387096774194
2753964,5,B000N3AVLW,"November 14 1970 was a very sad day in West Virginia. A fatal aerial accident took away the entire team and hard fans of this beautiful and warmth city.

So, in this messy and uninspired state of things, the slow breadth will begin to reconstruct from the ashes of the memory, piece by piece, the epic effort to give them back another team, another opportunity to exhibit with legitimate pride, the honor and the glory of these fallen gladiators.

Matthew McConaughey plays the role of the couch that will make the best he can in order to reestablish the vanished glory and the passion for winning. So the film shows us the entire different stages of this process. He will have to face the most difficult and unthinkable obstacles; the sad memories, the sorrow of having missed a beloved being, on one hand and on the other, to rescue the spirit of fight in the team.

A true lesson of life and epic resistance against the odds. I would not hesitate to label as the best sport movie after the well reminded Hoosiers.

2753965,4,B000N3AVLW,"We Are Marshall, starring Matthew McConaughey, Mathew Fox, and David Strathairn, is very well-done, and the story is inspiring.

At Marshall University in West Virginia, the ""Thundering Herd"" football team, along with a collection of boosters, parents, etc., is flying back from an away game when their plane crashes, killing the some 75 souls on board. The university and its town are crippled by the loss and want to suspend the football program at the school. However, a small number of remaining players organize a student protest to keep the game alive at Marshall.

After many fruitless phone calls, the university president (Strathairn) finds a new coach - Jack Lengyel (McConaughey). Lengyel convinces former assistant coach Red Dawson (Fox) to return, and the NCAA grants the university the right to play freshmen. Lengyel and Dawson then fill their team with new recruits and begin playing football again.

This movie is based on a true story, and I became misty-eyed more than once as I watched it. Performances are very good, and though the cast boasts several ""stars,"" I thought the best depiction in the film was given by Anthony Mackie. Mackie plays Nate Ruffin, one of the remaining football players. Ruffin was not at the away game due to an injury. It is his determination to keep the football program going that makes it a reality. He had some wonderful scenes with McConaughey and Fox, and, in my opinion, he walked off with the movie.

Other than one scene that seemed rather pushed to me (Lengyel's speech at the graveyard where the victims of the crash are buried; I didn't buy it. I don't know if it was the writing or the delivery, but it came off as maudlin and strained.), this movie is right on target. I highly recommend.",1205539200,2,1750,4.823333333333333

My only complaint about the movie -
Whoever was in charge of editing or adding music to scenes went overboard. At times, you will hear maybe 7 different 'period' songs in the same amount of minutes!!!! Geeez, it is too much and takes away from the movie. I know they are trying to ""take you back"" to that time period and give you the feel. But it is too much. All the music is great!

While the actual story is well worth telling, it's poorly told in this so-so melodrama concoction. We are allowed no time to get to know the characters before the fatal crash and it takes us to the last 10 minutes before we have enough invested in this film to care. I've seen many better sports films that are heartfelt and leave you feeling inspired.

This movie is about trying to bring back the football team with new players, and make them a solid team.  There were a few people from the old football team who were alive and well, because they happened to miss the flight that day.  They play a really nice part in the movie, and their emotions are believable.

In fact, the emotions of the coach, the new set of players, and everyone else is very real, honest, and believable.  At the time it was the biggest tragedy that ever happened to a football team, and you'll find out through the movie how hard it was for everyone to try to move on with their lives.  It was very difficult, and through plenty of emotional scenes, they'll eventually make moving on a reality.

2753985,4,B000N3AVLW,"To the small city of Huntington, West Virginia, the college football team is more than a weekly distraction from the toil of daily life.  The team unites their town and gives a sense of worth to a community in the Appalachian coalfields where so many feel swallowed up by the outside world.  Other schools have more money, bigger programs and greater fame, but no school means more to the townsfolk than the Marshall Thundering Herd.

So, more than thirty years ago, when a plane crash took the football team away, the town lost a part of itself.  In addition to the players and coaches, the town lost more than half of its doctors and many prominent members of the community, all who were some of the plane's passengers as ""boosters"" of the program.  But more than the loss of the people, the town lost its shining star, the football team.

""We Are Marshall"" covers the aftermath of the crash, as the team is built back by new coach Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey).  Sadly, the writers felt the compelling stories that grew naturally from the events needed to be Hollywoodized.  Some scenes lack authenticity and scream film cliche (everyone in town drives to the crash site and gets within a hundred feet of the burning plane, ""bad guys"" don't want the program to continue, the entire student body marches on the administration building to get the team back, etc).  The film's more poignant moments really happened, including a great scene with then West Virginia head coach Bobby Bowden helping the Marshall coaches learn their offense and a sobering moment where two funeral processions actually meet at an intersection in the days after the crash.

Had the film remained true to the story and stayed away from the manufactured drama,  this could have been one of the finest sports films ever made.  But even with its flaws, the heart of this film is in the right place.  It gets right the most important points concerning the ripple effects of the tragedy in the small town.

2753990,4,B000N3AVLW,"The 2006 film ""We Are Marshall"", directed by McG, is a story based upon a true & tragic event: the November 14, 1970 crash of an airliner resulting in the deaths of nearly the entire football team of Marshall University along with nearly the entire coaching staff and many other victims.  Only a handful of team members were not on board, including Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) and Tom Bogdan (Brian Geraghty).  With the entire town of Huntington, West Virginia in mourning following the crash, Nate organizes the students to rally the school's board to continue the football program rather than suspend it as Paul Griffen (Ian McShane), head of the board, wants to do because his son Chris (Wes Brown) was killed in the crash.  However, Paul Griffen and university president Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) relent and decide to continue the program.  After many failed attempts at finding a new football coach, Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) of the University of Wooster applies for the job and gets it.  Under his leadership, he and one of the original coaching staff, Red Dawson (Matthew Fox), train a new team comprised of almost all freshmen as the new Marshall University football team.

This film, which is a tribute to the football team that died in 1970, the students of Mashall University, Jack Lengyel, Nate Ruffin and the new freshmen football team of 1971, is an emotional, engaging & well-written film.  With wonderful cinematography, a gripping story and moving characters, ""We Are Marshall"" deserves a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.

2753992,5,B000N3AVLW,"WE ARE MARSHALL, directed by McG (what kind of name is that?) is a great movie that captures the incredible tragedy of the plain that, in 1970, killed so many members of the Marshall football community. The movie then attempts to capture the struggle of the decision to resume the football program and of the difficulty in putting the past behind and pushing forward with life. People affected directly by the tragedy will have a different opinion about the movie that the rest of America that only knows of the Marshall plane crash in passing.

You can really divide the movie into two parts. First, the plane crash, the victims, and those left behind to cope with the loss. Second, standared sports movie where team overcomes obstacles to prevail. I truly believe the creators of this movie tried their best to create a factual yet entertaining movie about the Marshall tragedy. The film can't follow all of the sad stories, so it chooses a few characters to focus on and has them be representative of the entire town. The film opens as Marshall loses a tough road game. We see the hurt by another loss yet proud of his team. We see the star running back kissing his fiance (played by Kate Mara, who is also the narrator of the movie) goodbye as he catches the plane and she gets in a car to return home. There is Nate Ruffin, team captain, who didn't make the trip because of the injury. Coach Red Dawson (played by Lost's Matthew Shepard) tells another coach to take his seat on the plane so he can get home to see his daughter's piano recital. Dawson takes a car home, and thus misses out on the crash only by chance. The film sets up a group of characters quickly and they all connect with the audience.

Then the plane crashes right before arrival. The crash is close enough that people in the town can see the site. The President Dedmon of Marshall (played by David Straitharn) is a timid man forced to take a leadership position. He is ready to cancel the football team but a show of support from the student body forces him to change his mind. He has a horrible time finding a coach until one man, Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) shows interest in the job.

The movie shifts here to focus on Lengyel trying to form a football team while facing so many obstacles. The team doesn't have enough players so the school finally gets the NCAA to allow freshmen to play (this wasn't allowed at the time). The coaches fight many recruiting battles and win a few. They finally make it to the season and the movie concludes with the team's first home game.

I think it would be almost impossible to capture what the town went through during these tragic times. But WE ARE MARSHALL does a great job of  portraying the sadness of the entire community and the incredible spirit that it took to embrace the new football team and honor those who lost their lives. The acting in this movie is solid, especially Fox and McConaughey. I recommend this movie to all sports fans and those interested in the history of the tragedy at Marshall.

2753995,4,B000N3AVLW,"This is a deeply moving movie. I wouldn't like to know the person who can sit through the first half hour of this movie and not be moved to the core of his being. It brings out every loss and every moment of grief that anyone has ever felt. In one searing moment of loss every one in this town lost close friends, lovers, admired leaders,neighbors,a whole team of athletic heroes, parents, children,and everything that forms the heart of town. And all are killed by the most horrible way known to man - burned to death. Six of the athletes were so totally destroyed that they could not be identified and had to be buried under a single monument.
This movie is only slightly about football, It is mostly about how people handle grief and somehow  move on with their lives and rebuild their world.
It has no happy ending. The new team does not move on the first year to become league champions. They do manage to win one game, and that is where the movie ends. The real victory lies in that the town does not give in to the grief that is still present, but decides to honour their dead by continuing the football tradition even though they know that it will be many years before they can have a winning team.
Sentimental people should have a full box of kleenex handy. Just when you think the sad part is over, something happens to tear your heart open all over again, just the way it happens in life.
Although this movie brought back the memories of moments of overwhelming grief in my own life, I am not sorry I watched it.  By showing how these people handled the grief in their lives, it gave me lessons on how to handle the grief in my own.
I reccommend this movie to every adult in the english-speaking world, but do not expect to come away unscathed.  It will hurt.  But, it will also heal.

2753997,4,B000N3AVLW,"The fact is that this was the worst sports tragedy ever in this country. 75 members of the team, coaching staff & others associated with the Marshall University football program were killed in a plane crash. It starts simply enough with the hours before & during an away game. The movie rolls into that horrible moment & the aftermath. It became a national story. The school & the city of Huntington, West Virginia were devastated. The relationship between the city & the school was very close & small town America. The first impulse was to cancel the next season. The whole varsity save two members who didn't make the trip were dead. A list was made of men associated with Marshall to fill the head coaching job. Nobody came forward. But a small time coach from Ohio with no ties to Marshall came forward & applied for the job. In desperation he was hired. That was Jack Lengyel, played by Matthew McCanaughey.
He made it clear that he intended to field a team, no matter whose feelings got hurt. They got a waiver from tha NCAA to play freshman for next season. The balance of the movie covers that year of struggles just to play, much less to win even one game, against bigger, stronger & older opponents. A story like this must have pathos. But we are not burdened by it or bogged down. A father & the sweetheart of a player share their grief. An assistant coach who had recruited 20 of the players is emotionally shattered & a player who overslept & missed the plane is racked with guilt. These hit just the right mix. Perhaps, an outsider, like coach Jack was needed to pull it all together. But in the end he also became part of Marshall.",1195776000,,1646,4.471760797342193

At the time of the plane crash, I was 10 and my brother and sister were both attending Marshall.  My sister and the quarterback were friends.  I grew up and attended Marshall with the cloud of that terrible tragedy looming over my formative years.

That said, my husband and children thoroughly enjoyed this film (with me sniffling the entire time).  The film tries a little too hard to capture all the emotions of the folks in Huntington, but all-in-all, McG tackles that impossible task admirably. He used composite characters to reflect the experiences of hundreds of people in the community, but there are several ""true"" characters in the film. The film is a story of perserverence and redemption, ideas to which anyone can relate.

The great thing is that the film does not end perfectly -- its ending is honest and genuine.  It took years to rebuild the football program at Marshall, and there were many, many times over the years that the community thought that Marshall should just let the program die.  But the program did finally overcome the adversity and produced great football and great football players.  And that's the best ending we could have.",1192579200,4,1247,4.816901408450704

2754033,4,B000N3AVLW,"Another football movie based on a true story. Yet, who can forget the tragedy that unfolded in 1970. I was barely born, but I remember how the tragedy was talked about for years following. How an entire college football team perished in a tragic plane crash, returning home from an away game. Surprising that doesn't happen more often as much as teams travel week to week.

WE ARE MARSHALL, is not just another true story football movie. It is brought to life by powerful performances by Matthew McConaughey who plays the brave coach Jack Lengyel that is brought in to revitalize a destroyed program, Matthew Fox who plays returning coach Red Dawson who wasn't on the plane that tragic night, and Anthony Mackie who plays Nate Ruffin, an injured player who didn't travel with the team that fateful night.

Mostly though, WE ARE MARSHALL, is brought to life by great decisions by the films director McG. He captures the hollow, lonely feeling of a heartbroken town with just quiet scenes in a local cafe. He also captures the emotion behind the 3 returning players, mostly in an extremely powerful locker room scene between Ruffin and Fox, as Ruffin pleads to be able to play through his injury, feeling he owes it to his perished teammates. It chokes me up just to think about it.

WE ARE MARSHALL is a tremendous achievement and a tremendous tribute to those players who perished and a team that struggled through grief in order to eventually lift its chin and keeping trudging through, paying the ultimate tribute to those players.",1192492800,4,1533,4.777358490566038

This emotional film follows the aftermath in the city of Huntington, WV, and how a new courageous coach and dedicated players helped pull the team and the town back together.
The film is boosted by solid performances by Matthew McConaughey as the new coach in a performance that eschews his usual macho comeon and focuses on his sincerity.  LOST star Matthew Fox is quite good as the assistant coach who switched places with someone and missed the fatal crash, carrying his own form of survivor guilt.  David Strathairn as the President of the University is fine in a smaller but impressive role.  Ian McShane brings a sense of unexpessed grief as the father of one of the victims who feels a new football team would mar the memory of the team.

Some of the boys lost in the plane crash were from my husband's hometown of Ravenswood, WV. For this reason, my husband watched  with tears and silence as the movie explored the lives that were changed and a community that was challenged when Marshall lost nearly its entire football program. Rather than only focusing on the team, the movie also explored the raw emotions of those who did not recover well from the tragedy.

You get to know the Marshall University team through its trimuphs and tragedies. McG is commended for directing this true life story. Well worth your time to watch this movie!!",1190332800,,588,5.072164948453608
2754050,5,B000N3AVLW,"In the fall of 1970, tragedy struck the Thundering Herd of Marshall football team.  Returning from a road football game, the team's plane crashed.  Seventy-five people, including the entire football team, coaching staff, and some fans were killed.  Marshall was left without a football team.  This fine film describes the rebirth of the Marshall football program after this terrible tragedy.

In the months after the crash, the university struggled with the idea of whether or not to continue the football program.  Most of the board of trustees wanted to suspend the program.  But university president Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) wasn't convinced.  When star varsity player Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) organizes a student body rally outside of the boardroom, Dedmon is convinced that the program must continue.

All of the coaches on Dedmon's list turns down the offer of becoming Marshall's new head coach.  But, Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey) has heard of Marshall's plight.  Jack contacts the University himself and expresses interest in the job.  Dedmon drives to Jack's house to interview him and soon, Jack is introduced as Marshall's new coach.  The problem is, Jack has no staff and only three returning players.

Jack's first duty is to hire a coaching staff.  His first hire is Red Dawson (Matthew Fox).  Red was on the previous coaching staff and was not on the plane when it crashed.  The next step is to find players.  The NCAA had a rule which stated that no true freshmen could play football.  But Jack begged Donald to persuade the NCAA to make an exception for Marshall.  Several letters and phone calls to the NCAA led nowhere.  Finally, at Jack's request, Donald drove to the NCAA offices in Kansas City.  He returned with a letter stating that freshmen could play for Marshall's team.  Now, Jack had to build his team.

Marshall was competing against some other big-time college programs, most notably West Virginia University, for players.  Missing out on all of the top recruits, Jack and his staff are forced to play with mostly fresmen, walk-ons, and the few remaining varsity players.  The early results were not pretty, but Jack preached patience and hard work.  Leaders began to emerge.

Soon, the team was ready for its first game, which turned out to be a decisive defeat.  But Jack kept his players practicing hard and believing in themselves.  The next week, the Herd faced off in their home opener against Xavier University.  The contest was close throughout, but in the end, Marshall prevailed on a last-second touchdown.  The long road back for the Thundering Herd had begun.

Over the ensuing years, Marshall's team slowly began the climb to respectability.  First, a winning season was accomplished in the early 80s.  Next, in the 90s, a series of future NFL stars played for Marshall, including Randy Moss, Chad Pennington, and Byron Leftwich.  Two National Titles rounded out Marshall's resurgence.

Simply put, this is a fantastic movie.  David Strathairn, Matthew Fox, and Anthony Mackie are all very good in their roles, but this movie belongs to Matthew McConaughey.  He does a masterful job of portraying a head coach who faced nearly insurmountable odds and yet put a group of young men together and made them a team.  His performance is truly one of the best I've seen.

I give this movie my highest recommendation.  The story is poignant, yet uplifting at the same time.  The acting is first-rate, and the game sequences are exciting to watch.  If you're a fan of football or just plain old stories about overcoming adversity, then this movie is for you.  You'll want to stand and cheer.",1190332800,7,3644,4.980066445182724

2754052,5,B000N3AVLW,"On November 14, 1970 a plane carrying the Marshall University Football team, it's coaches and fans, crashed on the way back from a game against East Carolina University killing 75 people. The way in which the film makers presented this sequence of events made the tragedy palpable. It's to their credit, that no sensationalized special effects or morbid recreations were used during or after the crash. The full grievous effects were still felt by the viewer due to the  touching  introduction of the players, the fans, and the overall small town U.S.A. atmosphere that this college, this town, and the players shared. This is ""NOT""  a football movie, but there is football in the movie.

As sad as the loss of lives, are the tortured souls of the people spared by fate, most notably two injured players who didn't make the trip and an assistant coach  Red Dawson, who at the last minute before boarding the doomed flight, volunteered to stay behind and make a recruiting call in the place of another  assistant coach, so the other coach could get home to see one of his children's  piano recital.

One of the most touching scenes of human decency in the film, is when the new head coach, Jack Lengyel and Red, were having a tough time getting the new team's ""veer"" offense  running the following year, so Jack came up with the unheard of idea, of going to see their in-state rival West Virginia University's coach Bobby Bowden, and ask for some advice. Bobby at first couldn't believe the ""chutzpah"" of Jack, but then said; ""Well we don't play you this year!"" And then led the two Marshall coaches to his film room and said go ahead. While they were in there, two West Virginia players accidently came into the film room, and when they turned around to leave the Marshall coaches saw that painted on the back of the West Virginia University football helmets were ""MU"" and a ""CROSS"". The impact of that stunning scene brings tears to your eyes and a pang in your heart. At that moment Coach Bobby Bowden walks in and Jack says barely audible; ""IT'S FIRST CLASS COACH! FIRST CLASS!""

And that's the best thing I can say about this movie; ""IT'S FIRST CLASS!""",1190073600,9,2156,4.65
2754053,5,B000N3AVLW,"""We are Marshall"" is the true story of what happened when a chartered plane crashed just short of the airport in Huntington, West Virginia on November 14, 1970, wiping out the varsity football team for Marshall University.  Having to replace virtually the entire team and coaching staff, university President Donald Dedmon (David Strathairn) hires Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey), who is not a Marshall alum, but who thinks that he can help a team, school, and community devastated by the tragedy.  The story ends a year later, when the Thundering Herd play their first home game of the season.  While watching this true story play out it might occur to you that this inspirational story reaches its climax when Marshall played in its first game under Lengyel the week before, because just fielding a team again is a major achievement, but ""We Are Marshall"" stays faithful to the genre it represents and represents well.

In many ways the most emotional part of the movie is the opening half-hour, that starts with the end of the final football game at East Carolina and plays out the rest of that fateful Saturday.  In depicting the plane crash, the film's director McG gives us bits and pieces of the moment of realization for those who will be touched by this disaster as the news breaks.  Wide shots of the forest on fire contrast with the downpour in which a wife learns that her husband was not on the plane.  Inspirational movies of this sort are intended to provoke strong emotions if not tears, but rarely is the first act as emotionally powerful as it is in this 2006 film.  The plane crash was not some place far, far away, but on the outskirts of town.  The students and townsfolk not only got to see the rescue vehicles streaming to the crash sight, they also got to go and see the fiery wreckage in the woods for themselves (at least they do in this film).

The other main characters in this film are those touched hardest by the tragedy.  Matthew Fox plays Red Dawson, the assistant coach who gave up his seat on the plane at the last moment, Ian McShane is Paul Griffen, the father of the team's star running back, and Kate Mara is Annie Cantrell, who was engage to Griffen's son.  One of the things I respected about this film is that not everyone is able to walk back into Marshall's football stadium for the big game, let alone be healed by the final credits.  Far and away the most compelling character in the entire film is Anthony Mackie's Nate Ruffin, the star defensive back who stayed in Huntington because of an injured shoulder.  It is Ruffin who organizes the students to keep the football program and who wants to keep playing despite re-injuring his shoulder time and time again.  His motivation seems unique, because Ruffin wants his team back, and it is Ruffin who is the heart of the Young Thundering Herd.

There are moments where the comic relief elements of the film run against the grain a bit too much for my taste; McConaughey's Jack Lengyel comes across as a bit of a bozo early on and there is a sense in which we do not get to the ""real"" him until his big speech before the Young Thundering Herd's first home game the season after the tragedy.  But then a running gag involving West Virginia University, which keeps getting all of the recruits that Lengyel and his coaches have on their board, takes a nice twist, and I have to admit that there needs to be some levity in telling story.  Furthermore, as much as I hate slow motion for big plays in sports movies, I really like the way McG intercuts flashes from all that has happened in this film into that moment, and the wonderful way that history and drama are intermixed during the final credits.  For my money, ""We are Marshall"" is one of the better inspirational sports movies in some time.",1190073600,7,3791,4.581360946745562
2754054,4,B000N3AVLW,"I remember clearly, as a high school junior, the shock and loss that the crash of the aircraft carrying the Marshall University football team invested on a nation. The town, the college, and those left behind must have suffered so. It has taken 25 years to portray that loss on film, and the December film, ""We Are Marshall"", while not living up to its promise as one of the years ""awardable"" movies, was nevertheless a moving film experience.

The film deals briefly with the events leading up to the crash, and then in depth with the different ways that those affiliated with the school grieve and start over again. Star athlete Nate Ruffin (Anthony Mackie) is stunned at the fact that he wasn't on the plane, due to injury, and that his legacy is to pick up where the team left off and start over again. His faith in that new start never waivers. Unlike Ruffin, the school's administration and its president Donald Dedmon (the always excellent David Strathairn)
are more realistic. They can't recruit, can't play freshman, can't rebuild right away. The school is small and although ""The Thundering Herd"" were important to students, alumni and faculty alike, the task is insurmountable. They will suspend the program for a few years to give everyone a chance to recover.

The student body has a different plan, and their outrage presents Dedmon with the need to try. He can't find a coach and has to settle for a virtual unknown from the College of Wooster. Jack Lengyel (Matthew McConaughey, complete with greasy hair in an unlikely length and clothes of plaid polyester) accepts the challenge He's just savvy and stubborn enough to make it work, to reformat and refashion a team of sorts, and even to talk former recruiting scout, Red Dawson (Matthew Fox) into returning as an assistant coach.

The remainder of the film deals with both the practical matter of building the team, the difficulty in winning, and the way those in the town and at the school deal with the grief of what might have been.
Director McG, not a favorite of mine (he brought us BOTH Charlie's Angel's films) surprises with his light touch with the story and his ability to let the film find its own legs. It is a poignant tale. It bogs down between the decision to move forward with the team and the actual first game. The game sequences have an authentic feel, and the score moves well with the film. The film feels like authentic West Virginia and authentic 70's. It never attempts to be something it isn't; it's a sports film that treats the sport within the greater landscape of what was happening in the times and how emotions sometimes get in the way of moving on with your life. It deeply affected the crowd in the theater on the day I saw it.

McConaughey is goofy, offbeat and believable as Lengyel. Aside from his performance, everyone else in the film works well together as an ensemble, with few false notes but not much to remember about their contributions. There's no cliche here, just a simple story that will make you both sad and hopeful. Forget what the critics say, ""We Are Marshall"" will touch you.",1189900800,44,3097,4.677064220183486

2754058,4,B000N3AVLW,"Being a WV native, and Huntington resident from 1967-1992 as well as a student at MU 1969-71, I waited for this film with both curiosity and some fear of what the producers would do to the story.

Some of the landmarks have changed-the downtown bridge is long gone and the bridge in the final scene wasn't completed until the late 1980's.  The restaurant scenes capture the essence of Wiggins' 16th Street altho' it is gone as well.  However, the feelings and the emotions of the community were portrayed exactly as we remembered them, we being my wife, a Huntington native and Marshall graduate.  It took many months if not years before the community began to understand the impact of the trajedy.  I believe it was to the University's, the Board of Regent's, and the Collegiante Athletics Commission's credit that MU was allowed to return to play and field a team, no matter how makeshift.

Following the Young Thundering Herd gave us cause to begin the healing process.  Failing to re-instate the football program would have forever left the plane crash as a final punctuation point to MU athletics.

Matt Macconaughey's portrayl of post-crash Coach Jack Lengyel seemed a little over the top to me, but there is no question that Coach Lengyel is indeed a character. That outrageous sports coat was actually only slightly out of fashion in the day.

I saw the film in Florida, 2 months after it's release.  I was amazed that at the end of the film very few in the audience left.  Most folks, including us, just sat quietly in their seats while the credits rolled and then very quietly got up and left the theatre.

That was exactly the atmosphere on the Marshall Campus following the crash in 1969.  Well done!",1189123200,17,1712,4.723905723905724
2754059,5,B000N3AVLW,"Nine months after the initial showing of ""WE ARE MARSHALL"" I still have to pinch myself to believe this movie really happened. I had great fortune to see it first time in Huntington while home for Xmas with my Father. He, my late Mother (she was retired MU professor) and other family loved the experience of being together to see it. Like everyone at MU at the time, I lost friends and parents of my friends. But....somehow we survived and so slowly put our lives back together but we always understood that life is precious, not to be taken for granted. The movie does a good job of acknowledging the deep pain we felt and how we all struggled with the loss. People seeing the movie who do not know MU Football history may not realize how long it took for MU Football to be competitive again and what determination everyone connected with MU showed in sticking with it. MU Football now has two consecutive losing seasons but I do not get too concerned about it. As Matthew Mc. said in an interview Marshall got ""back into the game of life"".....after all....that is all that really matters! Bring on the Herd! Let's Go Herd!

2754060,5,B000N3AVLW,"I have been waiting for the release of the DVD of We Are Marshall ever since I saw the movie with my wife on December 22nd, 2006.  Both of us are Marshall alumni, Class of 1974.  While my wife came after the crash, I was a freshman living in Towers East.  I was there.  I helped carry mattresses to the gym to set it up as an emergency triage hospital, before we learned that no one survived.

As an alum, as a student on campus at the time of the crash I was emotionally taken back at the movie.  As much as I can remember, it was very accurate not only in the details but the ""spirit"" of the community - both town and gown.  Football is and has always been a sport that the Huntington community gets behind.  With the tragedy that affected so many in the community that day and across the state and nation it tied us together like few other events could.

There were a few items that were expanded or not fully accurate but for the whole I believe it was accurate in capturing the spirit and emitions of the time.  The events of the loss of our Herd team had an impact on me then and the movie brought back many of the memories.  I have spoken with Gail Parker, who was the graduate assistant coach who traveled with Red Dawson on the recruiting trip and did not make the flight back (yes I know the movie only showed Red Dawson - that is one of the small inaccuracies) and he believes it was fairly accurate as well.

I can't wait to buy and watch the movie again, this time in the privacy of my home where I can shed a few more tears.

2754061,4,B000N3AVLW,"I watched this film with tears streaming down my cheeks as I recalled the evening of my 12th birthday, November 14, 1970. I vividly remember watching TV in the basement of our small house in St. Albans, West Virginia, and during the football game which I was watching, the local tv station broke in with a report that the plane had gone down. My first thought was, ""Oh no, Roger."" One of my family's neighbors in our first house in St. Albans was a young man named Roger Childers, who if I remember correctly was being redshirted during this particular season. As a typical boy who had dreams of growing up and playing football myself, I think back to Roger taking the time to visit with myself and my next door neighbor Joey when we asked him questions about football and college at Marshall. He was a wonderful young man and my family I learned the next day that unfortunately he was among those on the team plane.
 This film took me back to my youth and I thought everything was handled ""delicately"" out of respect for the dead and their families including the crash itself. Seeing terror in the faces of the coaches and players would have been very difficult to handle. I thought they paid very close attention to the details particularly in regards to the crash site and the weather that night...it was cold, nasty and rainy. The rebirth of the program reminds me of a Phoenix rising from the ashes to live another day. If you like to be moved when watching a film, by all means, watch this one.

I was 13 years old when this tragedy occurred, right in the middle of my football ""career"". Nothing mattered more to me at that age than football. I remember being struck at the age of 13 by the absolute magnitude and suddeness of the accident, and the completeness with which the joy of the Marshall football team was cancelled. This was both the biggest and most profound thing I had ever read about, and it was born in the thing I loved the most, football.

Just a week earlier my uncle took me to a Marshall  game in Huntington where they were playing Kent State. While some of the characters are composites (the cheerleader for one) I felt that it would be difficult for a movie to capture the mood of a town that just lost so many of it's prominent citizens. Just about everyone there knew someone who died - but this move captured that feeling and in a dignified manner. And it captures the long slow struggle back to getting a football team with coach Dawson. The movie is more than about a ""sports comeback"" - it is a story of the triumph of the human spirit.

I remember, first hand, what our town and community went through after the tragic loss of so many lives.  When I first heard that the movie was going to be made, I was both thrilled and trepidatious.  Could a big time Hollywood movie capture the real event with integrity, honesty and respect?  The answer is a resounding Yes!

McG, McConaughey, Fox and the rest of the cast and crew treated our story with all of that and more. The movie is historically accurate, (thanks to a great script by Jamie Linden) the acting is excellent, the soundtrack is fabulous, and McG - thank you for filming a good portion of this movie in Huntington!

This movie was not only ""necessary"" but a story that applies to so many other ""rise from the ashes"" events in our world today.  I know it would seem easy for me to love this movie because I lived it, but my adoration for this film actually comes from the efforts and dedication that the film makers put into this project.  They took a true story and made it into a movie that can touch the heart of anyone who sees it.

For those critics who spend too much time focusing on the ""pacing,"" and ""spirituality"" or other minutia, you're missing the point.  This isn't a film for pretentious, overly analytical critics or Sunday School debate.  Enjoy this film for what it is.

2754073,3,B000N3AVLW,"Ah yes, the obligatory motivational sports movie, where adversity, tragedy and all impossible odds are overcome and is topped off by a sugar-coated Hollywood finale. Hmm, not quite in this case. Based on real events, We Are Marshall suceeds on the basis of its factuality, leading cast, and the fact it doesn't try to sweeten the deal with an ending far removed from the reality it's based upon. Despite this, the pacing is often problematic, and certain scenes wring the drama dry by virtue of the cliched performances therein.

The greatest bouyancy factor in this film is Matthew McConaughey himself, and is the perfect candidate for the coach who revives the team. The college president, David Straitharn, also pulls through and adds immensely, as does Anthony Mackey as Nate. Without them, however, the remaining characters are not suffused with enough character development to make them memorable. All the new players that are recruited are so one-dimensional it's downright pathetic, in fact. In other films of this ilk(Mighty Ducks comes to mind) the characters are given greater depth and add to the movie by their presence.  Here unfortunately, the new players are more like stage props; nothing is added, other than the obvious existence of a football team.

Pacing can destroy even the best of films, but done properly, it can salvage even the most stinking wreck of celluloid. Unfortunately, We Are Marshall is far closer to the former. The more dramatic scenes jump awkwardly from one to another, interspersed with the occasional scene of irony or comedy. The interaction between Chris's girlfriend and his father, for example are too undistinguished to be effective. There is nothing to elaborate on their relationship, only the memory of their loss which is never pursued beyond ""the ring"". Adding to the irony is the ending itself, which despite being a powerful clincher, proves that this film would have been even more powerful as a documentary, given the heart-wrenching course of events it's based upon.

While this is not to say the movie shouldn't have been made, it wasn't overly necessary either. If I was to rate this movie on its comparative handling of most other hollywood sports films ""based on true events"" I would have given it 5 stars. But viewed objectively, there is too many shortcomings to allow me to be blindsided by the tragic subject matter.",1172966400,5,2382,5.038071065989848

2754078,4,B000N3AVLW,"Spirited and inspiring, `We Are Marshall' takes the tragic plane crash that killed nearly every member of the football team and coaching staff at Marshall University and makes it into a living memorial. Taking place in 1970, the town of Huntington, WV is found in a state of shock. Key members of the tragedy are focused upon, including #59, Griffin, whose father, Paul (Ian McShane) is a college head and whose fianc, Annie (Kate Mora, `Brokeback Mountain') is grieving. Besides team leader Nicky and a few other lucky team survivors, Red Dawson, the assistant coach (Matthew Fox) missed the flight when his recruiting duties called for him to take a car home. The college president Donald Dedmon (David Straitharn) understandably wants to throw in the towel, but Nicky won't stand for it. When Dedmon calls a private session to vote to cancel football, Nicky cleverly sends for people to come to demonstrate on the mall of the campus. His heart keeps all perseverance alive. After many attempts to keep a license from the NCAA and to recruit a coaching staff, Dedmon finally finds a recruit, an outsider, Jack Lengyel, (Matthew McCaugnahey) who has the color and spunk to fire up a football team from the ashes. He finally convinces, consoles, and cajoles those who are in shell-shock, in grief, and in survivors' guilt--including the reluctant Red--to stick with the program.

With great music pumping into the scenes, we get the determination to follow the seeds of rejuvenation. That is until the first game takes a nosedive and everyone involved starts to second-guess the timing of starting over. Then the movie takes a long time-out to reflect on matters a while. Lengyel, who was inspired to take over despite the results, at least has the winning message. (What the results are I won't tell, even for those who know the whole story.) The characters are lively and likable, and the story is told in a riveting way. Inspiring, 'We Are Marshall' makes us all want to be Marshall in our own way.
