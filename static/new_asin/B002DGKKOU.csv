8365094,5,B002DGKKOU,"""Those boys danced my feet off!"" a tired Rita Hayworth once
complained. But Rita and others brought cheer and laughter to
our boys in uniform at a time there was little reason for them
to even smile. There was nothing funny about the enemy they were
fighting. There was in knowing Bob Hope could be somewhere behind
the lines giving them the raspberries..His troupe actually did land
a couple of places before the Marines.
Of course, our boys preferred to meet and greet the Hollywood
glamour gals he brought with him. Many of those gals wrote
encouraging letters to their families back home.
One of them, Hedy Lamarr, invented a device that helped
American bombadiers better hit their targets. Few knew
about this because she hushed it up. She was getting paid
big money in Hollywood ""to stand around and look stupid,""
