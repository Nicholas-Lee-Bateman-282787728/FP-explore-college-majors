8233238,2,B000YKT4BM,"With a cast like this, how could this show be so bad? Easy. Just add execrable writing, schizoid directing, and a booming musical track that almost, but not quite drowns out the boilerplate dialog and TA DA! Strictly Confidential.

Suranne Jones is an amazing actor ... but watch her in something else instead. I recommend ""Scott and Bailey"". I have to wonder what the hell she and all the other fine actors were thinking when they said, ""Yeah, sure, I'll do that show."" Maybe it paid well? Or maybe they were sold on a premise without seeing the screenplays?

(Full disclosure: I'm writing this maybe 2/3rds into the first episode. Maybe the show gets better. I guess it would have to; I can't imagine it getting much worse.)

EDIT: For some reason, I've continued to watch it and the show kind of grows of you, god knows why. This certainly is by no means a good show, but I've raised my rating to 2 stars.",1501200000,,908,4.490909090909091

8233240,2,B000YKT4BM,"Pedestrian. unbelievable and disappointing - a let-down from start to finish. (No pun intended!) This mini-series appears to be written purely for sensationalism and is certainly not up to the standards previously demonstrated by writer Kay Mellor's earlier series such as Band of Gold, Playing the Field and, more recently, The Syndicate. Unlikeable, self-absorbed characters spouting drivel and playing sexy - plus the weakest of plots. The show doesn't know whether it is a murder mystery, a social documentary or a soap opera. If titilation and pretty faces are your thing, you may find this entertaining.  However, after watching Strictly Confidential you may regard celibacy as a viable option!!!",1373328000,,702,5.440366972477064

8233242,3,B000YKT4BM,"Strictly Confidential started out on a high note; two sex therapists who work in Manchester with patients from every walk of life. One of the therapists used to be a cop (this was never believable) and when she finds out her husband is impotent, she has an affair with her brother-in-law who just happens to be her co-worker. Their work as sex therapists was entertaining as they dealt with every issue as adults, offering insight and understanding and there was some fun in the editing room as the patients were shown at home with their significant others.

What doesn't work with this show was the murder angle. One of female therapist's patients kills herself (or not) and the therapist's former female lover/detective is investigating the crime. The story quickly unravels as to who, if anyone, killed the patient, who's having an affair, who's had an affair, and who knows who's having/had an affair.

Hopefully someone will revisit the basic premise of this show. It's not a  complete letdown but it was close.",1202688000,4,1016,4.895348837209302
8233243,5,B000YKT4BM,"America is likely watching ""In Treatment"". I certainly am. But if you want to really get some therapy, Strictly Confidential serves up a plateful of twists, turns and surprises. Where the HBO series is dry, ""Confidential"" is packed with ""wet"", touching upon taboo after taboo, fetish after fetish (S & M to bisexuality and beyond). It even throws in some murder to add to the spice.

If you enjoy the likes of Sex & the City, Footballers Wives, Desperate Housevives, etc., Srictly Confidential will definitely strike a chord for you. And, the super all-star cast plays it right all along the way.",1202428800,5,596,4.8431372549019605
