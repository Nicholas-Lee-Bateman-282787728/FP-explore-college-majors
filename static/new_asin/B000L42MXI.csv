8160200,4,B000L42MXI,"Better than expected in that Maxwell Reed is one of the stars, and I didn't think he ever made a really good movie.  Wrong.  This is good:
excellent locations, very atmospheric, and it kind of fools the viewer for some time...and THEN. Maxwell Reed is perfect as the gypsy, newcomer Siobhan McKenna is ideal as the alluring Irish girl, and Anne Crawford is always stupendous!  4 stars.",1475798400,,385,4.7164179104477615
8160201,4,B000L42MXI,"Barry Morse has a part in this movie.

You are kind of rooting for the ""seductress"" at the beginning; thinking she isn't getting a fair deal.  But gradually, you start losing sympathy for her.

Kind of provocative for it's time; without any nudity or graphic sex.",1393804800,,263,4.673913043478261
8160202,3,B000L42MXI,"Redemption Films is known throughout the world as an exploitation film distributer of primarily obscure and out-of-print horror titles, and for this we love them. I`m assuming these titles are getting tougher to find, so they`re going farther back in time cinematically to gain new releases to re-introduce to the marketplace, and this is a prime example. It`s not a bad flick, not at all, but it doesn`t belong in their catalog, as it has nothing to do with horror or exploitation. It`s a 1946 film about a Scottish girl who, because she`s the least bit flirtatious, or at least is perceived to be that way, is sent off to England to another family to live on a farm and work there as a servant. Men find her attractive (although she`s extremely ordinary), and those who get close are pushed away or have their faces scratched for taking advantage of her virtue. She doesn`t really deserve all that`s happened to her, other women loathe and start rumors about her, and this understandably takes its toll on her psyche, resulting in accelerated retributions on her part (I don`t want to give the plot away), culminating in a decent ending for the movie, but an unfortunate one for her. The moral here is bad things happen to girls who are perceived as anything but clean and wholesome (It ain`t easy being pretty, it ain`t pretty being easy) - remember, this was right after the war, and British censors ruled w/ iron fists now that Hitler and Churchill weren`t. Again, it isn`t a bad film to watch once, but you don`t need it in your collection, certainly if you purchased it thinking it to be like most of Redemption`s titles, you`ll be sorely disappointed. Rent it instead if you`re still curious.",1266019200,5,1700,4.708053691275167
