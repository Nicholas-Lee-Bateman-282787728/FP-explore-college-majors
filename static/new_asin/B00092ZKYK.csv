2260853,4,B00092ZKYK,"Forgive the rap.  These movies, although not the eye-popping ilk of Earth Vs. The Flying Saucers, or War of the Worlds, or even Invaders From Mars, are still worthy additions to anyone's canon of what goes for classic science-fiction.  Sure, the sets move when the actors bump them in Catwomen, and the so-called Brain is barely believable in Planet Arous, and the sets still move in Missile To The Moon, and the acting of The Day It Came To Earth has to be seen to be believed, but what is required here (as even in Star Wars) is a suspension of disbelief.  It seems to me that as movies get more sophisticated with  the special effects, there isn't as much of a challenge being demanded of with our imaginations.  It's as if the work is being done for us.  See these movies not for their flaws, but for the light and shadow of mystery that is still in each one---even if you have to look a little harder than Close Encounters of the Third Kind to find it . . .",1151452800,21,962,4.287292817679558

8056821,3,B00092ZKYK,"The four movies are on four separate discs; but are stacked one on top of the other. This is the first time I've ever seen multiple discs packaged like that.
I basically got this set because of one movie; ""The Brain from Plant Arous"". I have a couple of other old Sci-Fi movies with John Agar in them (""Tarantula"" and ""Revenge of the Creature""), and he is a likable actor and is good in these movies.
Despite Agar and a pleasant Joyce Meadows, the movie seems to have been written by some grade school kids.
Yeah I know the reason we all like these old Sci-Fi movies are because they are kind of ""corny"", but this one is just goes way past that. The characters don't react as ""normal"" people would and the movie just suddenly ends with a lot of unanswered questions. Not unanswered because the writer was trying to make us think about the ending, but because the writer just gave up and ended it.
Granted, it doesn't go to the extreme of ""Plan 9 From Outer Space"", but close.
And most of the special effects are close to being something that was done in someone's basement. ""Try to hide the wires holding up things please!""
I haven't watched the other three movies yet. This first one isn't remastered and it has some film flaws, but it isn't bad at all. The discs seem to all have been produced with a relatively descent level of quality, for what they are.
I'll post some more comments when I've watched the other three discs.",1399507200,,1428,4.412878787878788
8056822,4,B00092ZKYK,"Pretty good collection of old ""B"" type movies.  I bought it to round out my Scifi collection, as it had two movies that I did not already have.  Good set for the money.  I would recommend this set if your into old Scifi movies.",1397260800,3,227,4.113636363636363
8056823,4,B00092ZKYK,"THE ALIEN ATTACK COLLECTION consists of three uber-cheeze classics- BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS, MISSILE TO THE MOON, CAT-WOMEN OF THE MOON, and one total dog-log- THE DAY IT COMES TO EARTH. BRAIN FROM PLANET AROUS stars John Agar (TARANTULA, JOURNEY TO THE 7TH PLANET, INVISIBLE INVADERS) as a scientist possessed by an eeevil -and quite randy- alien brain named Gor. Agar devours any scenery in his path, like a super-charged termite in this masterwork! Meanwhile, a good alien brain named Vol takes up residence in the family dog. Can Vol stop Gor before Agar does that disturbing laugh again? Brrr! MISSILE TO THE MOON has lunar babes in swimsuits, high-heels, and huge head-dresses. Can the male visitors from Earth resist their wiles? Will the obligatory earth-women ever get their hair and make-up right? CAT-WOMEN OF THE MOON is pretty much MISSILE TO THE MOON's goofier twin. More moon-goddesses (in cat-suits), rock monsters, and giant, spider-pillows-on-wires abound. THE DAY IT COMES TO EARTH (aka: THE DAY IT CAME TO EARTH) is the ridiculous tale of a murdered man brought back to life by a strange meteorite. He crawls from a swamp, wanders around, and that's about it. George Goebel (!!) is in it, along w/ intergalactic megastar, Wink Roberts! The movie is the equivalent of self-immolation...",1373068800,8,1305,5.074418604651163
8056824,3,B00092ZKYK,"I think I saw all of these oldie but moldy films as a kid. I can really only recommend them if you're nostalgic for 50s SciFi B-movies. Yes the Brain from Arous is a balloon, Yes the Rock men are made from foam rubber, but its all part of the fun.",1372377600,,247,3.8627450980392157
8056825,4,B00092ZKYK,"""Alien Attack"" consists of four pretty cheesy sci-fi movies, three from the 1950's (""Cat Women of the Moon,"" its semi-remake ""Missile to the Moon"" and ""The Brain from Planet Arous"") and one from the 1970's (""The Day It Came to Earth""). If you're a fan of unwittingly campy grade-Z cinema, this set is for you -- though oddly the 1970's movie (albeit in color and with marginally higher production values) is even tackier than the three from the 1950's. ""Cat Women"" is still one of the most boring movies of all time (and, alas, this disc does NOT present it in the 3-D version released on VHS by Rhino in the 1990's) but its semi-remake, ""Missile to the Moon,"" is actually surprisingly good, the product of the same producer-director team, Marc Frederic and Richard Cunha, that made the equally underrated ""Frankenstein's Daughter,"" also in 1958, with a genuine sense of excitement and suspense that gets us past some awfully tacky special effects. ""The Brain from Planet Arous"" was a movie I looked forward to seeing based on Harry and Michael Medved's hilarious account of it in ""The Golden Turkey Awards,"" but it was a disappointment: not good enough to be entertaining on its own merits but not bad enough to be camp, either. Still, I was glad for the opportunity to see it in this set -- and to see ""Missile to the Moon,"" an underrated and genuinely entertaining film.",1370995200,2,1373,4.725
8056826,4,B00092ZKYK,"These films set the cheese factor higher than the whole state of Wisconsin. The special effects are neither special nor effective. The only thing less believable than the plots are the actors. The number of visible wires is only exceeded by the number of cliches.  Make yourself ready for a romp through the psyche of the time and stand in awe of how far we've come.  This is the Science Fiction of the 1950s where suspension of disbelief was the only art form available. And yet, half a century later some of us still love them. Why? Because for the imagination that craved more than a police drama, a romance, a soap, a western or a war story--this was it. There was nothing else. Because, well, they were fun. The films in this collection are wonderful examples of how to tell a story with no help from the studios, no computer effects, no scientific background and a budget of four dollars and seventy three cents. Young people, when you view them please forgive these movies their glaring flaws because without them there could never have been a Star Wars, a Transformers, a Spiderman or a hundred others titles.",1256515200,11,1117,4.636363636363637
8056827,4,B00092ZKYK,Purchased for nostalgia sake.  Parents used to drop me off w/ a girlfriend at the movie theater to see double features.  We were only six.  Could you imagine doing that today?  I remember Moon women and other really bad missle to moon type movies.  They're good for a Friday night giggle.  These 4 CDs are well packaged and enjoyable to look at as well as play.,1168300800,11,361,4.393939393939394
