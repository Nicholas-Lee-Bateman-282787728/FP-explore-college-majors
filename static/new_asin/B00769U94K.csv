5057338,3,B00769U94K,WELL IT WAS OKAY .IT WAS NOT WHAT I THOUGHT IT WOULD BE I WOULD NOT RECOMMEND IT. IT WAS BORING TO ME.,1355875200,2,102,3.4782608695652173
5057339,5,B00769U94K,This movie has a powerful message for the youth. Boring and confusing is what some said. Well i am not surprise the state of the youth is not number one on some people mind. Trust me some of the greatest stories have been told on a low budget truth be told hollywood wouldn`t have backed this anyway.,1351987200,9,300,4.280701754385965
5057340,1,B00769U94K,"I rented this movie from Redbox...... I figured since it had a few good actors that it would be a great movie. I didn't like it at all and wish I would have saved my money. I don't even think if they were offering this movie for free, people would stand in line to get it. This movie is weird, just very crazy and I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone because I wouldn't want them to get mad at me, lol.  Don't waste your money or time.",1351987200,3,440,4.0
5057341,1,B00769U94K,Not what I expected not very good wish I didn't order it cover and info misleading movie very very confusing,1351468800,2,108,4.45
5057342,5,B00769U94K,A must see.. The ensemble cast is wonderful and the acting is superb. Ty Hodges really captures the real life story of kids on the streets of LA and has put it into TRUE ART!! I was riveted and I recommend it to everyone..specially kids who think they would be better out on the  street and will soon find out that it is  not the place to live their lives..,1345075200,7,357,4.085714285714285
5057343,1,B00769U94K,"I also had a free Redbox code and decided to rent this movie. This is probably the most low budget film I've ever seen. Additionally, the lighting was terrible and the acting was sub-par. I fell asleep after 20 minutes.",1343001600,,219,4.5
5057344,1,B00769U94K,"I received a free rental code and decided to use it for this movie! Good thinking because this move was TERRIBLE (although I couldn't get through the entire movie)! It's a very low budget movie and and very slow! About 30 minutes into the movie, I shut it off and returned it! DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY OR YOUR TIME!",1338854400,3,313,4.322033898305085

5057346,5,B00769U94K,"its gritty and vulgar, and reality and yea its spiritually grounded in a message. A lot can be said about this flick being very graphic but so was KIDS and so are the actual streets of america. Avant-garde work is sometimes low budget, but its cutting edge. I like the fact this idea was put forth with no major backing beyond actors that felt enthusiastic about telling a story. Its a dark tale but sometimes you gotta get thru that part of life with faith and resilience to reach the light.",1415404800,,492,4.417582417582418

5057354,1,B00769U94K,"The producer spoke highly of it so i decided to get it from Redbox. What a waste of the $1.27!!! Low budget movie, extreme profanity, confusing and weird!!! I actually don't believe Ty H. agreed to do this crap. I watched 20 minute and could not take it anymore. Do not waste your money.",1397001600,,287,4.333333333333333

I started to STOP the movie because it was not making any sense. But in the end I do get what the movie about.the things that you do in your life will always come back to hurt you.
