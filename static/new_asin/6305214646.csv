995840,4,6305214646,"First of all I should mention that I saw the unrated version of this movie and I advise you to do so, too. The story is about yuppie Spader who meets and falls in love with mysterious Amick. But since this is a thriller/drama she has a dark secret...
The strenghts of this underrated and rather unknown movie are especially the outstanding performances by James Spader (who is great as usual) and Maedchen Amick who for the first time really shows how much sex-appeal she's got. Furthermore she's completely believable in this role as a beautiful, untransparent  and sort of crazy young woman.
The problem of this movie is that it goes on too long especially after Spader's and Amick's characters meet and fall in love. For this reason the tension decreases a little bit towards the end. Another weakness is the ending which is not completely satisfying since it leaves the viewer with quite a strange feeling. Nevertheless ""Dream Lover"" is a smart and extremely sexy and well-acted film - that's why you won't regret watching it (at least I didn't).
By the way: if anyone knows where to get a copy of the DVD of ""Dream Lover"" (unrated) please inform me. I've been looking for it since I first saw the movie!",997920000,12,1208,4.644859813084112
995927,3,6305214646,A youthful James Spader finds himself in a mess as the result of the lure of a mysterious woman.  Good mystery/drama.  Some of the story was a little easy to anticipate - but not the end.,1465776000,,187,4.166666666666667

The supposedly surrealistic carnival scenes may well have been added as an afterthought, a salvage operation to save the rapidly sinking ship of fools.but they were disingenuous, obnoxious, and boring.

996645,3,6305214646,"What we remember about this film is the important plot device that includes the Spader character being set up not only by his wife-to-be but also by his male business partner. Because of this, we feel that the minor characters are important especially the ones who contribute to Spader's paranoia.  Also, it is our impression that the female character in this story was mainly scheming, greedy but essentially stable as was James Spader's male work partner.  Plot devices also include the vulnerability of the Spader character in a state of loss therefore being even more vulnerable to believing what he wanted to believe similar to the William Hurt character in Body Heat. (Except in Body Heat both main characters were jerks.)  For some, the ending might seem to exemplify poetic justice. However, Spader's male business partner should also have visited Spader perhaps wearing a plastic set of love beads as he also contributed to Spader's downfall.  Since it is just fictional the ending is okay.",1432252800,,999,5.036363636363636

996717,4,6305214646,"I happened to see Dream Lover just a couple days ago and I thought it was pretty good. None of it predictable especially the ending. James Spader changes from a guy in love, to a man who finds out little by little everyday that he married a complete stranger. Madchen Amick plays Lena an attractive young woman who at first seems like the yin to Ray Reardon's (James Spader) yang. She is his dream woman, his fantasy. Ray is a man fresh out of a divorce who falls for Lena quickly. After a quick romance the two are married and Ray really starts to see his life with Lena the way it really is. It's far from a picture perfect life. I think Madchen Amick was brilliant in this film. Her facial expressions could go from loving and warm to cunning and cold and I loved that. James Spader is also great in this film. He too shifts in this film. The worst part of this movie is the ending. Is the ending good? Eh...Seems rushed but realistic. Id recommend this film because of the great characters and chemistry between James and Madchen. The characters start off one way and end totally different.",1355529600,,1094,4.394088669950739

Guess what --- someone decided to cut it out.  It's on my old VHS, not here.  Still a bit of nudity but no extended love scene.  What person decided to take it out and for what reason?  It makes the movie.  Women and men will be disappointed or not know what they are missing.

Not a bad movie, but skip it.  (Don't get the DVD anyway.)  If you want, spend a mint on the old, uncut VHS which is sexy yet not at all like a cheap porn flick --- it's much better and leaves enough to the imagination resulting in a real turn on that also better explains the movie.  Great for couples.  It was just right, especially with two fit, beautiful actors.

What person did this?  The rating did not change.  Why?",1327881600,3,838,4.15625
996810,2,6305214646,Mdchen Amick is hot - pretty face  -- but it takes more than a beautiful face to make a great movie. This is a light movie - first 20 minutes are fascinating but then it's downhill and good for a fast forward.,1324080000,,209,3.9761904761904763
996811,5,6305214646,"Like many others, (except maybe for Twin Peaks fans, of which I confess I am not one), this is where I first saw Madchen Amick, and what a film to begin with.

She is so sexy, the screen almost steams up!  She is truly gifted at playing dangerous femme fatales and she isn't really that tall.  But let's face it, what man could say no to such a pretty face?

James Spader, who has made a living pretty much being the victim in films such as these, and is terrific at it, is also terrific.  He manages to match Amick, which can't be easy and their scenes together really sizzle.  The one scene which stands out is a long flash of Madchen walking to the bathroom with her bare backside smiling at us fellas, which we will always be grateful for.  Mind you, Madchen is part Swedish, so maybe it's a natural thing for her.  Either way, terrific thriller and I have several other films starring the great Madchen Amick too.  One of those actresses from the 80's who you don't forget.  Oh, Madchen!",1319155200,2,992,4.342391304347826
996812,4,6305214646,"I love this film.

James Spader is warm and vulnerable as a divorced yuppie who meets his dream woman (Mdchen Amick) by chance one night. Unfortunately for Spader, he realizes she's not who she seems, but not before it's too late to turn back. A dangerous mind game ensues.

Probably because neither leads are superstars, this is a largely forgotten 90s thriller. But that's still surprising, given what a fresh take on the genre the film is. Setting itself apart from similar films, Dream Lover smartly forgoes the usual cheap murder and mayhem  la Basic Instinct and instead uses disturbing psychological suspense and mystery that works on several levels for the viewer. It's not just a great cautionary ""date movie"". It's a darn effective cautionary life movie as well.

The real draw however is the beautiful Mdchen Amick, who will be familiar to fans of Twin Peaks, where she had a limited role as a teen-aged waitress from 1990-91. In Dream Lover she unleashes a remarkable force of talent that encompasses a lot of depth and range. It should have been her star turn, but, for one reason or another, her career never took off. However, her performance here opposite Spader is amazing. Together, the two have intense chemistry, whether it be romantic, as they fall in love, or antagonistic, as they grow apart and eventually face off against each other.

I recommend Dream Lover as a great domestic tragedy of sorts for the 1990s. It's about shooting first and asking questions later, the consequences of which unfold with devastating impact.",1283212800,2,1547,4.911877394636015
996813,3,6305214646,"The rating I give here, 3 of 5, is meaningless, as I could not finish the film.  Despite the quality of the film and the acting, I find it difficult to watch tortured relationships (trigger warning).  And, as much as this reflects real issues in our culture, I would prefer an NC-17 rating for any such combination violence and sexuality.  But then, our morality rating system is broken and has never served anyone but the conservative moralists.",1282262400,,446,4.766233766233766

Picture this: Your own wife is a psychopath and you don't find out until 2-3 years into the marriage and start piecing together clues as the years go by and then all of a sudden you find out this woman isn't who she says she is, everything shes said has been a lie and worse..

When he finds out and confronts her... well i'll let you find out for yourself, all i can tell you is its insane what she does to him, she fools and manipulates everyone into believing hes the 'crazy' one, then the twist of an ending.. This is the worst case scenario that could happen to someone. This woman is your worst nightmare. This combined with weird dreamlike carnival sequences make this a very good thriller.

For years, I have been waiting  for  the DVD release of this classy, sexy, chilling twist on Happily Ever After.

James Spader is intriguing (OK, and gorgeous!) as the guy who seems to have everthing when he meets the girl of  his dreams.  Madchen Amick as the best psycho-chick I've seen in years, eventually has him doubting everyone around him, and  everyone around him doubting his sanity.  Who's more obsessed: him in his pursuit of the perfect life, or her and.... Hey! Watch the movie!  I've never seen the unrated version, though I hope to.  I am ""voting with my wallet"" and buying the rated version.  It's a great movie and industry bottom-liners need to be reminded that there is a market (i.e. profit for them) in the release of great movies that aren't mega-blockbusters!  So I'll watch and enjoy this one, and suggest you do, too.  And when the unrated version comes out, I'll buy it, too!",1094169600,10,915,4.608695652173913

This movie is most for the eclectic tastes looking for independent films
the script of this movie treats the life of the character as the people (at least me) does. The real and more intimate thoughts and feelings come to the surface through the dreams and the influence of the dreams in the cotidian life.
And one thing this movie theaches is : never blow it, 'cause sometimes you only have only one opportunity.",1087516800,3,538,4.556701030927835

Ironically, MGM chose not to use the unrated version and in the process, cheating viewers out of about 10 minutes of additional footage. If you watch the trailer, you can see scenes not in this 'R' rated version. The video is very clean with no artifacts, colours are fine. Choice of both widescreen and full-frame are available. No extras except the original trailer. Sound is dolby digital or stereo surround. Of course the visual treat here is Madchen Amick who is just stunning throughout the film. Other notable actors are Bess Armstrong and Larry Miller. If you want to see the entire film, seek out the vhs unrated version. Recommended for fans of Spader and Amick, both are superb. 1 hr 44 minutes.",1086393600,23,879,4.641025641025641

Madchen Amick is also in the groove as her psychosis slowly comes to fruition. The secondary characters are thankfully left in the background, as they're not very interesting and the focus is kept on the burgeoning tension between man and wife. When Spader finally snaps you wish you were there with him laying the smack down.
That they didn't release the unrated version is a travesty, but fortunately no plot is lost in this version (only some great nudity and hot sex with Madchen). At any rate this dvd is worth it for James Spader's performance of a lifetime, and the superb if unoriginal story.",1086134400,35,730,4.848

The ending did sort of surprise me though...but Amick was amazing in this movie!
