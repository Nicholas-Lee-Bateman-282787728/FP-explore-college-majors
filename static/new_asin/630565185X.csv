1057094,4,630565185X,"I remember seeing this on TV several years ago, and thinking this is going to be horrible! Was I ever wrong! Its a surprisingly touching holiday movie, with great performances from Howard Hessman, and Jennifer Love Hewitt(Here billed as Love Hewitt).

  With the exception of ""Part Of Five,"" I was never a huge Hewitt fan. Home For Christmas was a great example of how good she can be when Hollywood isn't giving her bad scripts. Her chemistry with Hessman was terrific, and that smile could light up the night. A very pleasant surprise, and one that I will continue to watch form time to time.",1124496000,4,594,4.6380952380952385
1057095,5,630565185X,"Can't take my eyes off on Jennifer ""Love"" Hewitt while watching this movie. I'm glued to it. I enjoy watching her. She's so natural as if she's not acting. I really love and adore her so much that I want to kiss her because she is so CUTE on her younger days. I recommend watching this movie because it brings the holiday spirit on what it reallly means, being with the family and the values the goes with it.",1118966400,3,409,4.189873417721519
