8556927,5,B00ARM3DZ0,"If you're a fan of ""Destination Truth"", ""Fact or Faked"" or ""Haunted Highway"", then you'll enjoy this show. Plain and simple.  I like anything with a Road Trip vibe to it and the three cast members had a good chemistry on screen that didn't feel forced. Give it a shot!",1471132800,,268,4.36
8556928,5,B00ARM3DZ0,Nice show fun and interesting to watch. Allways been a big fan of Erin Ryder.,1453334400,,77,4.2
8556929,1,B00ARM3DZ0,This show was a silly joke and an insult to all interested in ufo's. At a later date James Fox almost cried when he talked about regretting his part in it. DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!,1423872000,,183,3.972972972972973
8556930,5,B00ARM3DZ0,"As stated in the title to my review, too bad this show was canceled.
James Fox is a well respected UFO researcher, as well as,a fine producer and writer of this genre. This show has some minor flaws, like everything in life, however, it is good nonetheless.

The skeptics can be somewhat overbearing. Even they can be mildly entertaining!  ( Ben with the alien mask )

Overall, it was a worthy show. Alot better than some of the absolute
junk that most channels shove on the American public today!

NatGeo jumped the gun, at cancelling this show, it did have potential.
Much more than some other less capable shows on the channel.

8556931,5,B00ARM3DZ0,"I was pretty excited when this show was first announced. It sounded a bit like 'UFO Hunters', but with a different spin. It premiered on the National Geographic Channel to some pretty bad reviews and even had the actual investigators on the show denouncing it. All that said, its still very entertaining. The team travels to locations like Brazil and interview, what appear to me, very credible witnesses. You've even got a skeptic on the team who attempts to explain away most of these stories as best he can. The show can sometimes get silly with the team searching around the desert (at night) with metal detectors trying to locate UFO debris, but somehow, this adds to the shows charm. Not every episode like this and I can see how critics disliked it because of small details like that, but the bulk of the show focuses on the eye witness UFO accounts. That's what matters right?? It's a shame this show wasn't given a second season. From what I understand, it had the viewers and I enjoyed tuning in every week, but it just gathered too much of a negative reputation I guess. The good news, however, is that the first (and only) season of this show was recently released on DVD. I'll buy it and enjoy the episodes and possibly feel a little depressed knowing that the series could've continued and improved over time with more seasons. If you're interested in this topic I'd say give the show a shot.",1363305600,3,1406,4.605577689243028
8556932,1,B00ARM3DZ0,"This feels like yet another scripted reality show about nothing.  Sadly the crew actually goes to some cool places and sees some cool people like Travis Walton.  Travis Walton had an abduction experience that all his friends saw.  You could blow a tow hour show on just an interview with him.  He wrote a book, like a good book.  Anyway this show is so stupid and so fake I had to stop watching.  If you want to see three fools drive around and scram a lot and say ""oh my god! That's a UFO! Ahhh"" This is the show for you. If you want a show on one of the greatest mysteries on earth keep looking.  See ""Fire in the Sky"" or ""The Forth Kind"" UFO Files is ok and stay clear of Ancient Aliens unless you want comedy.",1360713600,,713,4.086330935251799
8556933,1,B00ARM3DZ0,"This series is very poorly done.  Very little time is given to the subject matter- UFOs.  Not a good value for the, rather steep, price.",1360195200,,136,4.4
