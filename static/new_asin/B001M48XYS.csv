3692205,5,B001M48XYS,"This modern dress production of Semele by Robert Carsen is very entertaining.  I've admitted previously that I don't particularly care for baroque opera.  This one started out slow, as usual, with the same lines sung over and over again, but once the gods were involved, the production started to percolate!

I wasn't expecting humor but this opera is filled with it.  Isabel Rey as Iris and Birgit Remmert as Juno did some very funny bits together.  Charles Workman as Jupiter and Cecilia Bartoli as Semele were brilliant together.  If there was a weak link, it was Liliana Nikiteanu's English pronunciation and a tendency for her singing to fade out.  Otherwise, the entire cast and chorus sang beautifully and the acting was superb!

If you are new to Handel, start here, you'll love it!",1239494400,19,790,4.887218045112782
3692206,5,B001M48XYS,"I've been greatly enjoying this new Decca DVD of ""Semele,"" with Cecilia Bartoli in the title role and Charles Workman as Jupiter.  The disc is now on sale here in the U.S., having been available on-line from the U.K. for some time.  Originally performed as an oratorio, Semele takes naturally to the opera house (in this case, Zurich).  Although in modern dress, Robert Carsen's staging is generally faithful to the text, with few gratuitous additions.  As would be expected of William Christie, the musical production is excellent.  The cuts are mostly minor.  If you want to check it out yourself, you can find several excerpts on YouTube, including ""Endless pleasure,"" ""Myself I shall adore,"" and ""Where'er you walk.""",1237075200,26,720,5.059322033898305
3692207,3,B001M48XYS,"This performance opens into a somewhat Calvinist dcor - solemn, restrained and wealthy.  The spirit of Protestantism is here.  This wedding certainly takes place in Zurich, not in Palermo :)  The overall design resembles of another Zurich Opera production - Ariadne auf Naxos, but this one is done with more taste and discretion - at least at the beginning (it was not an aesthetically rewarding idea to place Ariadne's action in a restaurant and make her a drunkard - even though it was the famous Kronenhalle Restaurant which is close to the Zurich Opera House).

I ADORED the newspapers headers after Semele's abduction : Daily Mail: ""Where Eagles Dare!"", The Times: ""By Jove! Princess in Eagle Palace; Snatch-Drama Continues"", Daily Express: ""Semele: I'm in Heaven!"" - this was hilarious and witty.

Juno's costume is absolutely ravishing - she is dressed as Queen Elisabeth II, which is so incredibly funny and smart, telling us that the action is actually happening in London, where Handel lived; it was for me the first time I understood we were actually not in Zurich anymore!  But Juno's astonishment over the photos of the amorous couple seems to be exaggerated - considering that her spouse had many other passionate love stories, and by the way, not only with women - he practiced equal sexual opportunities for both males and females.  We have more entertaining newspaper headlines here: Daily Mirror: ""Jupiter and Semele! It's official!""

Iris acts to laugh. Juno sings her famous aria ""Awake, Saturnia... Iris hence away"" - well, although the best ever singing of this belongs to Stephanie Blythe, and that voice is incomparable, I also like Hilary Summons in this role.  This Juno sounds are not always agreeable to me - I find her shrieks inappropriate for the Empress of Olympus; her role is of dignity and unyielding revenge; such do not scream hysterically.

Next bedroom scene is well-done.  Zurich's sense of gifts is certainly richer and more generous than that of  Boston's - the jewelry Jove gives to Semele must be custom-made from Chopard at least (it there a world-famous British jeweler???), while in our Boston home-made production Jove gave Semele a very modest tiny Tiffany box.  That was stingy  indeed for the King of Gods.  I am was also glad that they have not overdone ""burning sensuality"" scenes.  Regarding music, I could clearly hear ""He shall feed his flock like a shepherd"" in Jove's aria ""Where'er you walk"" in Scene 3, Act II.

At the end of Act II the chorus presents a globe of good fortune to Semele - a very elegant touch, in my opinion, conjuring up images of Fortune by Giovanni Bellini or Albrecht Durer as fortune traditionally holds a blue globe.

It is somewhat strange to recall again a link between this and Aridane auf Naxos production of the same Zurich opernhaus - at the end of Ariadne Bacchus sings of his mother Semele, as at the end of Semele Jove sings of a ""god more powerful that love"", that ""sighing and sorrow for ever prevent"" - that is, to Bacchus.  Perhaps it is another pearl of Hugo von Hofmannsthal and Richard Strauss in their opera, a subtle allusion to Semele and an elegant homage to the Baroque King.

Back to this Semele - Happy - the last chorus bears a strong resemblance to that of Acis and Galatea ""Happy, happy, happy we..."".  Cecilia Bartoli is charming in ""Myself I shall adore"", but even all the acting cannot help the voice that is too low for Semele.

The funeral scene with Semele body was burdening;  and production booklet reveals somewhat simplistic and moralizing thinking of the production director; definitely Ovid and Romans did not think in Zwingli terms about marital infidelity on the part of the Emperor.  The performance ends on Jove caressing the behind of a courtier lady in the direct sight of his wife.  I find this vulgar and unnecessary to stress his libertine nature - and such vulgarity has no place in Ovid, who is more playful than crude;  barbarians like Robert Carsen seemingly do not value an understatement.  It is a pity they did not stop at fabulous extravagance of Juno and Jove opulent costumes in the final scene, but had to hint thickly with that vulgar gesture that Jove is always up to new adventures, to the consternation of his wife.  Yet it was overbearing and awkward to my taste.

Singing-wise, I think this is a good, but not excellent production;  Cecilia Bartoli confirmed once again that she is a vocal agility virtuoso, but her voice lacks squillo, yet she compensates for it with vibrato.  However, the brilliance of the genius voice is not there.  Her mezzo voice is not the best fit for Semele, and she could never compare to true sopranos like Kathleen Battle or similar youthful voices in this role; I'd say that Norma Burrowes,  Rosemary Joshua or Beverly Sills are more believable and more delightful in their sopranic divinity.  Semele must be a very young, nave and somewhat childish, trustful, see-no-evil girl, and Bartoli's mezzo is rather a middle-age mistress.  She is an expert singer, and her vocal tricks are amazing, but her voice is just not right for Semele - there is no lightness of soft and innocent youth in her voice.  Yet I still give this production 3 stars for the effort and quality, but without Bartoli's  virtuosity, it would probably be less.  Jove is quite good, but he is not anything close to Anthony Rolfe-Johnson;  Juno is adequate and Ino is below average - I wonder how such mediocre singers get solo roles in the world of opera fierce competition.  Athamas makes a companion in voice quality with Ino - he is not impressive; both of Ino and Athamas seem to be insecure in their singing.

Conducting by William Christie is good, but the orchestra sound this time is average.

Story-wise, I think Handel's personal position regarding the narrative is in Juno's words: ""Love's a Bubble Gain'd with Trouble: And in possessing dies"".  I find it a little silly to give serious attention to these stories, since they are utilized to demonstrate emotion and singing ability of a singer for whom they were written, but I actually think that Jove disappointed Semele as a lover, and she grew frustrated, not knowing anymore what to ask for.  That marked the end of  love.  I strongly detest bourgeois explanations offered by Carson and others.  Romans were not puritan prudes, and they adored Ovid's ""Ars Amoris"", so the outcome like Semele is most likely from intimate frustration, not from any social status.  But it is truly somewhat ridiculous to give this story any serious consideration;  it has to be ironic, as in this production.

Overall, I recommend this DVD for viewing and audio pleasure; while this is not a masterpiece but a good entertainment.",1275004800,,6724,4.824607329842932
3692208,1,B001M48XYS,"I did not believe the three negative reviews for this and am I sorry!!!  This is in almost every respect a disaster as a production.  The whole concept is shallow, foolish, badly conceived.  The setting is dismal and meaningless, costumes also, direction too awful to be laughable.  Indeed, it makes a tragedy of this very lovely, short and simple opera version of Semele, presented here as broad comedy, totally ignoring the poignance and tragedy of a foolish, ambitious young girl's vanity and the perfidy of men.  I have seen productions when the setting of an opera has been changed, ""updated"" in time and place, and they have worked, due to the care with which the story is kept intact to the composer's intentions and the life of the music and story.  Here, it was not.

Unfortunately, only Semele and Jupitor are outstanding singers, and Bartoli is made ridiculous in her acting, as are others in the cast whose vocal contribution is second rate.  Bartoli sings well in English.  The mass sex orgy, fully dressed,  on the floor covered with chairs, is mind boggling.  The blue satin bed is both vulgar and distracting, and Bartoli's wardrobe deserves special condemnation.  Her appearance in a complete opera of such caliber is insulting to her and the opera both. It is also an insult to me and to those who respect opera and fine music as an art form to be respected, even revered. I've seen worse productions in my eighty five years,  probably, but I can't remember one at the moment.  I feel cheated since I could not with a conscience give my copy to anyone else or sell it.  However, I would like to hear more of Workman whom I have not seen before, a fine singer and actor.",1265587200,25,1687,4.632996632996633
3692209,2,B001M48XYS,I was waiting for this release to come out with baited breath.  Semele is one of my favorite handel works and I've owned the CD version with Battle and Horne with Nelson conducting.  I can't tell you about this production because I found the singing to be so god-awful that I paid little attention to the staging. Bartoli is fair - although I found her sung English to be quite understandable.  I feel that the other singers really ruined this performance for me.  Very sorry that I bought it.,1252800000,8,493,4.50561797752809
3692210,5,B001M48XYS,"Yes, I found the so-called comedy hokey rather than witty. Yes, it is modern dress; but I didn't mind. It doesn't detract from the performance. The minimal sets were acceptable but added nothing much to the strength of the production. In general, the absence of more extensive settings did limit the possibilities of interaction so as to minimize their impact. The direction seemed, at times, to be devaluing certain key supporting roles, such as Juno (Birgitt Remmert), so that they lacked the weight to be taken seriously when they are causes of key activities. I'm sure that I can come up with other deficiencies in direction which made the performance less than it might have been; however, that said, despite these weaknesses, the marvelous Handle score shines through thanks to first rate vocal performances by Cecilia Bartoli (as Semele) and Charles Workman (as Jupiter), Solo, in duet, and with the (excellent) chorus they give us words (by Congreve) and music which make for a most entertaining and stiumlating evening.
There is a moral, of course, which is very lightly touched upon. Handel was well aware of the nature of the British society of his day and paid his respects to its rulers, but with sufficient delicacy so as not to offend the developing middle class. The moral: if you don't know your place in society, the bosses (aristocracy) will see that you learn it the hard way. The directors of the production make sure that none of us will be distressed at the anti-democratic qualities which, once upon a time, probably were given greater emphasis.",1250553600,10,1569,4.9245283018867925
3692211,5,B001M48XYS,"There is conjecture about this being an oratorio rather than an opera as it is based on an English opera libretto by Congreve.  One train of thought suggests that, with opera waning in popularity, the oratorio form was needed for success to regain prosperity for the composer.
That said the Zurich performance is most definitely in operatic form but the result is strange at times with the chorus dressed up in dinner suits and evening gowns.
The plot uses mythology to illustrate that greed ultimately destroys the individual, in this case Semele sung by Cecilia Bartoli, who demanded immortality from Jupiter who had whisked her off to a specially built palace.
Bartoli is in fine singing voice and often outshines others in the cast.  The oratorio style is often evident in the singing but this is not a somber work as there is comedy mixed with some bawdiness with Bartoli spending a lot of the time romping around in a nightdress.. So overall it is quite a different work which receives a unique presentation.
First class audio and video.
Regarded as one of Handel's masterpieces this production deserves a place in your collection.",1247270400,9,1137,4.8860103626943
3692212,1,B001M48XYS,"... and, like other powerful executives of recent memory, had dubious taste in dames. But the libretto for this English opera, written by playwright William Congreve, is several notches above the average Georgian doggerel, and the music is Handel near his compositional peak. What follows here will be a critique of this specific performance and should not be read as criticism of Semele as a work of the musical stage.

This is a wretched mess of a performance. The modern sets are dreary. The orchestra is shaky. The balance of voices with orchestra is lacking in acoustic integration. But most of all, the singing is shoddy, unstylish, lacking in ensemble discipline, and OUT! OF! TUNE!

Cecilia Bartoli is the biggest name and has of course the biggest role, as Semele. Bartoli often substitutes mannerism for affective expression, but this time she takes her flouncy coyness to extremes. Worse yet, she sings most of her arias with a tight, quivery, non-ornamental vibrato. It's unclear whether she's attempting to re-legitimize the old-time fat lady's warble, or to mask the deficiencies of her tuning, but in any case she fails at both.

Liliana Nikiteanu, in the role of Ino, has such a reedy little voice, and so little control of her enunciation, that it hardly matters when she's out of tune, which is often. Believe me, it's true. Listen to her duets with Athamas, sung by high tenor Thomas Michael Allen, early in the First Act. The duets are shockingly out of tune, and I think the fault is chiefly Nikiteanu's.

Birgit Remmert (Juno) and Isabel Rey (Iris) play their roles as TV comedy, which might be presumed to justify their squawky, squeaky timbres. But they're also tragicomically OUT! OF! TUNE! altogether too often.

There's nothing especially ingratiating about the voice of bass Anton Scharinger, at least in his Baroque role of King Cadmus. His singing is bluff and robust, but not at all stylish. Nevertheless, his arias come as a relief, since he's mostly IN TUNE!

High tenor Thoams Michael Allen struggles bravely with a role (Athamas) that flings him up and down across his voice break. He has some style and he acts with expressive restraint. I'll watch for him in other productions.

William Christie is one of the finest conductors and exponents of Baroque music in the world today. It was his presence at the podium  in the Opernhaus Zrich that induced me to buy this DVD. Unfortunately, the orchestra ""La Scintilla"" lets him down. The violins struggle raggedly to keep up with Handel's hustling sixteenth notes. The oboes are scattered at crucial passages, and in one obbligato, they are hideously OUT! OF! TUNE!

This DVD is so disappointing that I'm putting it up for re-sale immediately. Hopefully one of my pesky persistent no-voters will buy it by mistake.",1247184000,14,2796,4.9445628997867805

Staging is current vintage Eurotrash.  Bartoli's mezzo lies too low for Semele and she strains to produce the required volume.  Nikiteaun's voice also sorely lacks the strength needed for the role and her English pronunciation is atrocious.  Tenor has a lovely voice which he produces without strain, both top and bottom,  Orchestral playing excellent, and it is really better to listen to the sound track than to view tortuous sludge.",1244073600,11,580,6.68
3692214,2,B001M48XYS,"A wonderful  Baroque opera made into a silly comedy... slap stick at times. I'm always surprised when great talents like Bartoli and Christie allow a director to make them out to be fools. Normally i would do not review performances since taste varies. My only reason for posting this comment is t caution prospective buyers... this is not a quality update, it is a farce. The singing does not excuse the low budget contrived production.",1243555200,12,437,4.826666666666667
3692215,5,B001M48XYS,"Cecelia Bartoli has the voice if not the figure to make you believe Jove would lift her to a secrete love palace on the lambent wings of an eagle.  This opera is Handel at his erotic best.  I blushed many times as Semele and Jove cavorted the bed to sublime music.

The production is what opera should be: fun and entertaining to watch one rainy evening.  The only irritant is the silly bedrobe Bartolia wears through most of the production---surely the lover of Jove would be more sexily attired?

My favorite aria is Juno in full fury:  Hence hence, Iris, hence away.  Always the jilted spouse, Juno is a fury of anger and malice as she tricks Semele into self-destruction.  And does so here most convincingly.  Bartoli looks so innocent besides the conspiring wife that I shuddered to think of silly, young girls throwing themselves at married men.

If you have ever conceived of Handel as serious water-cannon music, here is a production that is worthy of the modern and immodest times we enjoy, and done with verve and skill so that by the end you are satisfied as only opera can satisfy:  full of visual, aural, musical, and sensual delight.

The Work.
By 1741 Handel was out of the opera business. For three decades he had presided over a thriving Italian Opera House in London, had produced dozens of operas by other composers as well as written and produced some thirty five or so operas of his own composition. All this time he had been in the favor of the royals and the ""people of Quality"". However the tastes of the London audience had changed and he had gone from a wealthy man to near bankruptcy. Now he simply changed forms and was writing oratorios in English and was again prospering. A succession of ""hits"" folloowed including Messiah, Samson, Saul, Joseph and his Brethren etc. Then in 1743 he too up the script of Semele, a tale from Ovid. He had previously written a ""serenata"" in English also based on Ovid in 1714 called Acis and Galatea which is in oratorio style, not staged. Semele was to be a non-opera even though the libretto by William Congreve was set as an opera by John Eccles in 1707 but not performed at that time. This libretto is a masterpiece of English writing. It pulsates with life, passion, lust, comedy, pathos and eroticism. Certainly not something for a church choir. Handel added some parts of Alexander Pope e.g. Jupiter's ""Where 'er you walk"" to fill in the Congreve text. His great inspiration began to flow again and Handel produced one of the most perfect gems of his great output.
The Performance.
This DVD production was filmed in January 2007 at the Zurich Opera House, The cast here has the very gifted Cecilia Bartoli, the formidable conductor and Baroque authority William Christie and noted producer Robert Carsen. All in all a very successful operation. The other cast members are not so well known as Ms Bartoli but are most all up to the calling except the Ino of Liliana Nikiteanu who goes breathless on occasion. They all work together along with the excellent chorusto give the piece a light comedic touch, particularly the Juno of Brigit Remmert. When this work was first presented (not staged but sung) in 1744 the reviwer dubbed it ""No Oratorio, but a baudy opera"", and bawdy it is. A good evvenings entertainment as a staged work.
In 1990 a superb CD was issued using period instruments, the Ambrosian Opera Chorus, English Chamber Orchestra all led by John Nelson. The cast was a dream roster with the young Kathleen Battle in perhaps her best recorded role, the unmatchable Marilyn Horne as Juno and Ino, Samuel Ramey, Sylvia Mc Nair, counter tenor Michael Chance and John Aler as Jupiter. I have listened to and cherished this recording for many years. When I compare this performance to the present DVD I'm impressed with several things. In the CD we have a series of arias superbly sung e.g. Horn ""Hence, Iris, hence away"", M Chance ""Hymen haste, thy torch prepare""(not included in the DVD), Ramey ""Wher 'er you walk"" (so beautiful). But that is it. It is a series arias sung by some of the best and most famous singers of the time; there is no sense of continuity. Here in this DVD it all works well together as an opera with the good chorus providing push for the action and unifying the parts into a whole. Semele has a sad end but from her ashes is born the demigod of wine and good cheer. So in the end the chorus sings his praises and passes around the wine to everyone onstage, all get tipsy and start doffing off clothes; and Bacchus crown the joys of love.",1243296000,22,3430,4.606209150326797

8320394,1,B001M48XYS,"A commentator colleague wonders why there are one star reviews of this DVD. I have read them and I found the reasons clearly an orderly exposed. But if I had to express the reasons about my own disappointment on this production, Id say that Bartoli is a wonderful singer, with a really incredible voice that has the most imaginable versatility coupled with a strong register in both the high notes as deep, an almost unprecedented combination. I think she is the best mezzo of her time. But as in this life you cannot have everything, on the other hand she is a lousy actress. I correct, she is that kind of actors/actresses that have only one role in their repertory, and they act the same way Macbeth than Falstaff. Mrs. Bartoli acts every play like a farsa, AND IT IS NOT LIKE THAT; she acts only in productions made by modern and pretentious rgisseurs, if for taste or chance, I don't know. Nonetheless it is disrespectful to the public (like Mr. Houston means), but above all is a huge disrespect to the author and the play itself. In the classical theatre, the tragedy is a very serious issue like the comedy itself; they have something to say to us, something very important that was thought by the greatest writers of humanity, and not precisely by Mrs. Bartoli or some rgisseur who believes to be a genius. Semeles plot, teach us the human finitude and fallibility, and the result of the pride. To mention an opposite case, La Cenerentola (other play destroyed by Bartolis acting) tries to show us the value of humility, kindness and generosity. This marvelous opera includes a basso-buffo, but neither this, nor any melodrama giocoso, much less a dramma per musica like Semele, include a mezzo-buffa. In conclusion: if this were a CD, perhaps I would give it 5 stars; since it is a DVD/blue-ray, I give it one. I hope this answers the question of the colleague.",1440028800,,1871,4.6555891238670695

Strangely, this work, which was performed as an oratorio by Handel and never repeated during his lifetime, has more recently been quite accepted as an opera masterpiece.  This dvd supports that notion.

It is set in modern England (it was written in London), with the jealous Queen Juno dressed as the British monarch.  She and her attendant Iris, are played for laughs, which works quite well.  Her rage at her licentious husband Jupiter (Jove) is over the top since he has been dabbling with ladies for ages.  So her anger at Semele is exaggerated, and, therefore, ripe for comic treatment.

Cecilia Bartoli is wonderful as Semele.  I agree her voice is a little low in tessitura for the role,. But she has such charm and verve that she won over myself and especially my wife. While not beautiful, her charisma makes her that much more attractive.

The chorus, always the key part for me in an opera) was great.  They have much work to do here, and really move the story along, as well as comment on the characters.
