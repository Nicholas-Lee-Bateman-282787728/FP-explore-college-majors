8363548,2,6301257812,The kingfu was fast at times and slow at times with the major martial arts being swordplay. The storyline was good with revenge the theme with the a woman as the hero. Her kungfu was  slower than slow. It was entertaining  though and it won't put you to sleep. I just prefer more hand to hand  combat.
