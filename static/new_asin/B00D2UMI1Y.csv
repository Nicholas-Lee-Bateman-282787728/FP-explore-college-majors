Hopefully for those of us patient enough, a cheaper version will come to Amazon later.",1372809600,4,174,5.0
8588652,5,B00D2UMI1Y,"It has been how many years since the first DVD release?  I think it has been 6 or 7 years since Season 1. This is my favorite guilty pleasure show. Although I think they really started going good was in Season 3 with the introduction of Bubba Higgins and Iola Lucille Bowlen(Mama needed a sidekick in all of her capers and she is one of the best in TV history).

From what I heard is that they are going to re-release the First Season with the TV movie called Eunice plus the full episodes will be released as well-there was such an outcry from Season 1 from fans they decided they could not release the other seasons with the tv cut versions.

Also heard the they are going to release the whole series from Time Warner-the commercials you see on tv selling Carol Burnetts shows, etc... They are supposed to have interviews from all of the cast members, bloppers and extras that nobody has seen before. But there is no formal release date as of now. The only thing for sure is the release of Season 2(which I have preordered already).

If they release all seasons I will definately be buying that. Better start saving my money!

Love you Mama!",1371600000,4,1143,4.423809523809524
