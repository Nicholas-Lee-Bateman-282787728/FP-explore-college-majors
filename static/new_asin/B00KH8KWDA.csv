6427412,2,B00KH8KWDA,I found this video to be boring and monotonous. I also found the two main actors/chroniclers to be rather corny.,1408838400,,112,4.65
6427413,5,B00KH8KWDA,"Joshua Zeman's second film follows in the impressive shadow of his first, ""Cropsey"", and builds upon the bridge between urban legend and reality.

Right off the bat, if you like ""Cropsey"" you will like this film too.

For the rest of you, ""Killer Legends"" explores the events that spawned four popular urban legends: The Hook , based on Texarkana's ""Phantom Killer"", Candyman, the awful story that drives parents to x-ray Halloween candy every year, the babysitter murderer, and outbreaks of Clown sightings. Each segment is approached seriously, and driven by Zeman's curiosity. Unlike reality TV shows that dominate the cable TV landscape, all of the subjects are treated with respect.

The Baby Sitter and the Man Upstairs portion was the most fascinating to me due to the scope of the two crimes, and the related unreported crimes  in such a small Missouri town. The Killer Clown piece was engrossing because I'd never heard of it.

Killer Legends is a well crafted documentary with solid camera work, and a haunting sound track. It is perfect for those who wish to explore urban legends, and how they evolve from real events.",1408233600,19,1130,4.957671957671957
6427414,5,B00KH8KWDA,"As one other reviewer wrote, the only problem I have with Killer Legends is it wasn't long enough.  But that's an indication of just how good it is.  The truth and origins of urban Legends and the willingness of people to believe them at face value has always fascinated me and I'm a big true crime fan, so Killer Legends was definitely a documentary I enjoyed immensely.  The movie is very straightforward without a minute wasted and it goes by very fast.  I can only hope for a sequel.  Made by the people who made the acclaimed documentary Cropsey and this film is just as powerful.  Highly recommended to lovers of urban legends, true crime and horror films.",1407715200,2,662,4.567796610169491

6427416,4,B00KH8KWDA,Great documentary.  Very interested to watch Cropsey now.  Provides great insight into 4 particular urban legends and how they became prominant in our culture.  Easy and enjoyable viewing.,1407369600,,188,5.642857142857143
6427417,5,B00KH8KWDA,"Delving into our collective nightmares, this horror-documentary investigates the origins of our most terrifying urban legends and the true stories that may have inspired them.

A few years ago, Joshua Zeman made ""Cropsey"", a punch in the gut documentary that started as an examination of an urban legend and turned into a full-scale exposure of something far worse. What many would rather have us forget, Zeman brought to life: a mental facility that was not doing its patients any good, to say the least.

This time he is back, examining not one but four urban legends and finding what may just be the truth behind them (or, if nothing else, real events that pushed the legends further into public consciousness). The hook man, the candy poisoner, the babysitter and the killer clown. Each is looked at in some detail (although limited by the film's running time).

With the hook, we travel to Texarkana, find a little-known serial killer who was never caught, and explain how fact and fiction were blurred through the film ""The Town That Dreaded Sundown"". The fact the city annually shows a film about the killer, who could have been alive and attended a performance, is a bit disturbing. And how these ""Texarkana Moonlight Murders"" are relatively obscure, even for serial killer buffs, is a mystery in itself.

In the candy poisoner segment, we learn of the legend of candy tampering, which is just that: a legend. Although circulating for one hundred years, instances are so rare as to be virtually non-existent. And then we have Ronald Clark O'Bryan, the man who took these legends and used them to cover up his real crime... and legend becomes reality.

The babysitter story, with a killer being inside the house, is best remembered as the plot for ""When a Stranger Calls"". Interestingly, we find that babysitters are not likely targets -- perhaps even less likely than the average person. But then the story takes a juicy turn, when we learn of a serial rapist and murderer who preyed on babysitters, and how a town's racial prejudice probably sent the wrong man to prison. This story deserves its own documentary.

Lastly, the killer clown. Apparently there is an urban legend (not as well known) of clowns that drive white vans and abduct children. And while they circulate around Chicago, the story cannot be traced to the obvious source of John Wayne Gacy (though he certainly intensified it). Here we never quite get to the root, but along the way learn a great deal about Chicago's history with clowns, which is interesting in itself.

This film is every bit as good as ""Cropsey"", though it does suffer from the format. From the short segments, we are left with one of two impressions (or both): that these needed to be longer but could not be because of running time, and that this was likely supposed to be an ongoing series for Chiller that never came to be. One can easily imagine Zeman traveling to a new town each week and getting to the bottom of an unsolved mystery and an old legend, being the gruesome counterpart to Jan Harold Brunvand.

And we hope he does make more.",1405555200,45,3092,4.766355140186916
6427418,5,B00KH8KWDA,"If you are a true crime fan you'll love this documentary. The
film-makers profile 4 true crimes and how they relate to urban legends.

6427420,3,B00KH8KWDA,"Overall there was some interesting information, which is why I gave it three stars. Unfortunately, what kept it from being higher was the fact that in order to fill time and information that was unfortunately lacking (true crimes are not always solved) they became speculative and exploitative. An interesting premise, finding the foundation of urban legends in real life, they offered multiple true crimes that brought some of the urban legends to life. They investigated the crimes, went through evidence and crime scene photos, and went to the locations where the crimes took place. What was not necessary was knocking on the doors of the houses where the crimes took place to talk to people who were not even alive (or were babies) when the crimes happened. They also claimed some theories as facts before being corrected. Because of that, and the use of fictional movies as backdrops to tell the story, it crosses the line from documentary to entertainment throughout the film.

The killer clown urban legend became silly when talking to people about ""spotting"" clowns that were pedophiles and each story became more ridiculous -- clearly they were hamming for the camera. They were in Chicago, they had the Gacy story -- why go anywhere else? That is the ultimate killer clown story. Also, the whole history of the circus train and the dozens of entertainers who were killed -- why? Pointless to the story.

In the end, the narrator says, ""Maybe these monsters, despite our overwhelming desire to believe otherwise, just aren't real. By presenting false boogeymen our urban legends are helping us to make sense of crimes too wicked to comprehend."" That would have been a great place to stop, but it wasn't sensational enough. He finishes with, ""So what's the lesson behind the cautionary tale? The warning here is simple -- be afraid, not of the story, but of the storyteller."" WTF???!!! Is he telling us we should be afraid of him? That was the problem throughout the film. In an effort to try to be more exciting, they became ridiculous. They should have stuck with the facts.",1487376000,,2084,4.90084985835694

6427440,3,B00KH8KWDA,"This could have been a far more interesting documentary if the directors hadn't made two very bad mistakes. First, they inserted themselves into the movie for no good reason. They have zero charisma and add nothing to the movie. Two less interesting people could not have been found. They don't look good on screen, they don't sound good...it's like watching two office workers with horrible haircuts having a break room conversation over their lean cuisines. They have directing skills, and their focus should have stayed in that role. The movie would have been a lot better if they'd just used a narrator. Every time the film manages to achieve some momentum, they show up on the screen and yank it back into amateur-land.

The second mistake was that they introduced the film as being a sociological exercise, investigating the sources of urban legends we've all heard, but then they randomly shift into a true-crime format. This wouldn't have been a deal-breaker all by itself, but the true-crime aspects are often poorly executed. They start each segment investigating possible sources for urban legends we've all heard (the hook-handed killer, poisoned Halloween candy, the scary clown, etc) but for each one they just wind up picking a single crime/incident and then trying to solve the crimes. It's just weird and unfocused.

For it's flaws, there were some things I liked about the film. The music was done well; it adds to the movie while remaining unobtrusive. Too many documentaries these days opt for soundtracks that are overbearing and distracting. Their interview subjects come off well, which speaks to good editing. There are genuinely creepy moments, and it was fun and chilling to watch at halloween time. I was just frustrated because it could have been a lot better.",1475539200,,1788,5.037162162162162
6427441,4,B00KH8KWDA,"I liked this because it featured some news stories dating back to the fifties that took place in my hometown of Columbia, MIssouri.  I wasn't't aware of the connection, so I was floored when the story started! Interesting.",1475539200,,222,4.842105263157895
6427442,4,B00KH8KWDA,"There was a lot of ground to cover in this documentary and the filmmakers did a good job. The style of this well made show helped transcend its shortcomings and the camerawork is excellent. For those very critical reviewers, remember that this is a 'small' production, i.e. not made by a big studio with big studio funding. Would it have been stronger if each segment had a little more in-depth information, for example, the filmmakers didn't state how many of the ""Phantom's"" victims were assaulted before death, only focusing on one seventeen-year old girl, but maybe that was done for the sake of time - a lot of information to fit into a documentary and still keep it interesting. It would be very interesting to see this premise expanded to an episodic TV show, an hour-long show devoted to one urban legend at a time. The filmmakers should pitch that to Amazon, and or Netflix.
In this documentary, for a fuller picture, it would have been nice to know the stats on the other similar crimes to establish pathology (as in the Phantom killings), but that takes the kind of overview feedback (and funding) that a large film company would insist upon before release. Stats, in crimes shows, give the kind of structure that makes for a rock solid framework upon which to build your story.
The rambling, conversation-style approach was very easy to watch, not distracting, and felt like just-us-guys-talking, which was very fitting to the premise of the show about how urban legends evolve from a kernel of truth rooted in real crime. Again, this is where style transcended form and it worked.
The filmmakers have evolved from their first documentary Cropsey, and this film is very encouraging. I am looking forward to what their next offering will be, and fingers crossed, hoping that they get a full season run on Netflix.",1475280000,,1824,4.812101910828026

6427502,5,B00KH8KWDA,"Reading stories involving urban legends has always given me a chill, possibly because many are loosely based on fact.  After watching this documentary and learning the back stories, some of those legends no longer simply give me a chill, they frighten me.

Killer Legends respectfully covers some of the well known urban legends and boogie man stories of our youth and reveals the true stories behing those legends.  The filmmakers took the time to research the details of the actual stories, they showed where the stores took place and interviewed people who were there, who knew the victims (and perhaps the actual killers).  Unlike the ""reality"" shows that cover ghosts, haunted houses, or cryptids, this isn't campy, it is serious and factual.

Most of the stories happened decades ago, but that doesn't make them any less tragic or frightening.  The legends are scary, but the true stories behind them are scarier because they really did happen, and often the killer(s) were never caught.  I remember seeing the movie 'The Town That Dreaded Sundown', it scared me then, it scares me more now.

I greatly enjoyed watching Killer Legends, it was interesting, fascinating, and well done.  I very much hope the filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills will document the truth behind other urban legends.  I'd enjoy seeing more films like this (but only with the lights on and all the doors and windows securely locked).",1463616000,,1420,5.004255319148936

6427520,3,B00KH8KWDA,"The best I can rate this is  stars and I think it generous.  The acting is OK.  The documentary format is successful.  They do get enough folks that were involved in original murder cases to discuss the incidents and they acquire evidence of the crimes to define what actually occurred and what mysteries remain.

It is like watching a cheap television documentary, but I give credit to the two legend hunters in that they seemed genuine and not corny, and the people they interviewed also did not seem like nut jobs like I have seen in so many other documentary type shows.

The thing is, it is supposed to be horror, and it is about as scary as four year old in a Peter Pan costume on Halloween.  I know it is about murder, but it does not have any content that would classify as horror.  It is more like documentaries I have seen talking about the legends surrounding the Kennedy assassination than horror.  Informational.  Possibly entertaining at times.

This documentary not only explains through well-conducted research the stories that have lasted years, but also begins to unravel the truth of what we truly find terrifying. Absolutely worth the watch, if you love horror movies, you can't get any more horrific than the true and grisly happenings of next door or down the street or in our hometown.

One thing though, after trying so hard to draw connections between the various stories told here, it seems odd they wouldn't have tied the whole thing together with the glaring connection between Gacy & Dean Corll. Gacy was likely emulating Corll in some ways, their choice of victims, methods of torture, suggested use of multiple accomplices, and so on. Corll's case is rife with speculation of sex slave rings involving young runaways, which points back to implications suggested throughout Cropsey as well as in Gacy's case. There are at least two documentaries on male prostitution in Houston that also point to a similar theme. Corll ties Cropsey & Killer Legends together in another way too via Corll's nicknames, the Candy Man & the Pied Piper.

6427645,1,B00KH8KWDA,"There's an awful lot to dislike about ""Killer Legends,"" and I do mean awful. It claims it will investigate the real-life crimes that inspired certain urban legends, but rarely rises to the integrity of a low-budget cable-tv documentary. The most lurid of such shows still adhere to the barest bones of investigative and reporting principles, which this film repeatedly flunks.

It's quite a disappointment after the authentic, well-balanced and eerie doc ""Cropsey,"" which benefited from Josh Zeman's lifelong and nuanced exposure to his hometown legend. There's also a lot less of Zeman in front of the camera in ""Cropsey;"" he would have done better to stay behind it this time.

""Killer Legends"" frequently treats local news reports as the gospel truth about unsolved crimes. The film barely examines the tabloid sensationalism so often infecting local news, and how it can distort or omit the most important facts of such cases (especially decades ago). A healthy skepticism is but one of the virtues of ""Cropsey"" missing here.

There's also a noticeable scarcity of police or forensic reports, or of interviews of any depth with local law enforcement who were actually involved in the cases. These are staples of even the lowest-budget TV crime doc (and of ""Cropsey""). When hard evidence does appear onscreen in ""Killer Legends,"" it's often in isolation from its official source. The filmmakers, whose deductive talents appear limited to what they've seen on TV, recklessly speculate on-camera about what conclusions might be drawn from the evidence at hand; they then fail to corroborate or even inform most of these conjectures in any other scenes, and don't invite anyone else to review the same sources. This isn't intriguing or tantalizing; it's fatal to credulity.

Why do the filmmakers feature themselves and their hapless Encyclopedia Brown act so prominently? What insight do we gain by watching them react to a week in town and maybe twenty hours of Googling a case entire police forces haven't solved in decades? (Spoiler alert: zero.) Are they the subject of their own documentary because they couldn't secure the interviews they had hoped for, with more credible sources directly related to the cases? Perhaps the cops, owing to their years of detective work, deduced this movie was a turkey long before I could, and judiciously declined to participate.

The interview gap is filled (poorly) by additional amateur sleuths, introduced as 'among the foremost researchers' and the like in this or that case. In fairness, the filmmakers are honest that these people aren't experts or professionals. The documentarians and hobbyists trade some loose banter onscreen, in lieu of formal interviews. This might have been the right approach, given both parties' lack of credentials, were it not for the occasionally cringeworthy leading question or betrayal of confirmation bias that should've been left on the cutting-room floor. Too often, they persuade no-one but each other.

""Killer Legends"" generously sprinkles horror-movie clips throughout, probably just to fill time, but the effect is to overstate horror movies as reflective of ""our deepest fears."" Horror movies entertain by being fanciful, highly improbable and just scary enough, not really believable; genuine urban legends are existentially terrifying. A film like this was a rich opportunity to illustrate the difference but, alas, the distinction is lost on the filmmakers.

Case in point: one of the supposed urban legends this movie investigates, the babysitter stalked by a homicidal stranger, isn't a fear that's actually felt by society at large, except at the movies. (Or perhaps, I concede, during the immediate act of babysitting.) ""I thought we'd find tons of murdered babysitters, but we could only find one actual case in the entire country!"" Rachel Mills blurts to the camera. The filmmakers seem oblivious that her observation hasn't debunked an urban legend; she's in fact observed that the entire segment to follow is about an 'urban legend' that doesn't actually exist. It's possible they found themselves trapped in a logical fallacy after filming (the segment itself ultimately disproves its own premise) and it was too late to re-shoot; but I suspect oblivion, since their go-to academic talking head contributes some analysis of ""the roots of this deep-seated fear"" which is, in fact, the sole invention of Hollywood.

The real intrigue in the babysitter segment, it turns out, is the alleged railroading of two black men for the murder and a related rape they might not have committed. An angle like this is exactly what made ""Cropsey"" so compelling. But our not-so-intrepid reporters ""investigate"" no farther than a few rebuffed phone calls to the local police (real go-getters, these kids!). They're told that the cold murder case is ""too old"" to warrant further investigation and, damningly, we're left with the impression that the filmmakers take whoever's on the phone at their word. The rest of the segment spinelessly tiptoes around the elephant in the room: racism is rarely mentioned again, let alone explored for its potent influence on urban legends. Their gutless haste to abandon this line of inquiry is the near-opposite of ""Cropsey,"" in which the Perfect Suspect is thoughtfully, patiently revealed to possibly be a patsy.

In the spirit of ""Cropsey,"" Zeman might have segued from this moment into Charles Stuart, the Boston man who murdered his pregnant wife in 1989 and blamed a non-existent black gunman with a raspy voice. The entire nation, including the press and police, bought Stuart's story until his brother came forward to reveal a murder plot for insurance fraud. Now THIS is a genuine and timely urban legend, rife for true soul-searching: the imaginary black male scapegoat. But that's far too relevant, too edgy, too much thinking-person's stuff for this ""documentary"" to dare tackle.

So journalists these two are not. Worse, they're not even entertainers. The whole thing is narrated in Zeman's reedy, nasal drone, which is particularly ill-suited to this subject. But not even Keith Morrison or Bill Kurtis could liven up this purple prose. How many times can you recycle narration like ""But the truth was stranger, and more horrifying, than we ever imagined"" before it becomes an unintended punchline? (Spoiler alert: zero.)

Chief among its many unexamined assumptions, ""Killer Legends"" is way too confident that these decades-old, hopelessly naive legends still fool anybody. In 2015, even a 12-year-old knows serial killers aren't asylum escapees living in the woods and stalking strangers. They're high-functioning pillars of their communities who often know their victims. Where are all our modern urban legends, which have shifted their focus from strangers to neighbors? The Arab boyfriend who warned his white girlfriend not to visit any U.S. shopping malls on the black Friday after 9/11? The friend of so-and-so's husband who visited for a few days and left behind a length of cut clothesline hidden under a pillow to be stumbled upon and screamed over by the wife after his departure? Geraldo's devil-worshipping day-cares (and his susceptibility to the cult angle, given the journalistic aftermath of his successful Willowbrook expose)? The serial sodomite who drugs his frat dorm-mate with Rohypnol? And can we finally put the supposed intimacy between gerbils and weathermen to rest, if only for a minute or two of comic relief?

A more serious film (or a merely competent one) could have stuck to the antiquated legends, and still found ways to ask: now that the facts about serial murder have debunked the Hook and Halloween Apples Laced With Razor Blades, what do they tell us about society then vs. now? Did they help make us wary of strangers back then, or lull us into a false sense of security about our neighbors? How complicit is the media in perpetuating urban legends it knows to be false (well-handled recently in ""Nightcrawler"")? What are the consequences of that complicity for, say, the black American male? Is he our new bogeyman, because to this day he's still a stranger to too many of us? Or has the Information Age and its all-too-verifiable, moment-by-moment cellphone-video coverage of mass shootings debunked urban legends for good? By the time we reach a particularly tasteless attempt to connect John Wayne Gacy and Colorado movie-theater shooter James Holmes, it's clear these topics are well above the filmmakers' heads. So they aim instead for an easier target: beneath our dignity, and the victims'.",1430784000,14,8573,5.222383720930233

This was a serendipitous choice, it seems, since I just recently watched the meta sequel to The Town That Dreaded Sundown (sharing the same title), considering that this documentary begins with an exploration into that particular series of murders in Texarkana.
It goes on from there to a chilling story of a real life incident of a child dying on Halloween night from poisoned candy as well as the basis for the urban legends that provide the substrate for numerous movies including When a Stranger Calls.
This was a terrific documentary about a truly fascinating subject...and I wish that I had thought to do it myself.

I didn't like the ""docudrama"" music, which is one of my pet peeves with seemingly every doc I watch.
What I didn't like, specifically, was the ""babysitter"" segment, where they attempted to tie some terrifying rapes to urban legend. I found that disgusting and in extremely poor taste, especially considering the obvious pain it caused one of their interviewees.

6427687,5,B00KH8KWDA,"KILLER LEGENDS is another chilling, ultimately enlightening documentary from the maker of CROPSEY. This time, Joshua Zamon and Rachel Mills hit the road, traveling across America in search of urban legends. First, they investigate the legend of ""The Hook Man"", visiting Texarkana, Arkansas, where the real-life Phantom Killer struck in 1946, which inspired the film THE TOWN THAT DREADED SUNDOWN in 1976. Next, they're off to Houston, Texas, looking into the ""Candy Man"" or ""Halloween Sadist"" murder case that helped to fuel the national fear of tainted candy every Halloween night. Then, Zamon and Mills hit Columbia, Missouri, to delve into the murder of a babysitter in the early 1950s. This, of course, ties into the legend of ""the babysitter"" and the modern WHEN A STRANGER CALLS films. Finally, we are taken to Chicago, Illinois, where the idea of the ""Killer Clown"" is thoroughly examined. This segment is my favorite, as it goes into the phenomenon in depth, including clown history, local Chicago mass clown sightings, John Wayne Gacy, etc. KILLER LEGENDS, like CROPSEY, is more than just a simple expose of these four topics.

Or the poisoned Halloween candy story which turned out to be based on a true crime as well.  Worth the time to watch definitely.",1422662400,,453,4.457831325301205
6427704,5,B00KH8KWDA,I watched it for free on Prime. Very interesting and well done. Edgy and artistic but still factual without jumping to any conclusions and giving their own answers. They just look at the evidence and say what *could* have happened.,1422662400,,231,4.8

6427706,3,B00KH8KWDA,"This is a decent doco, though you can also catch the most important parts edited into the other doco ""Cropsey"" which was also directed by Joshua Zeman. Zeman essentially made two videos out of Cropsey, though this one does include a couple less interesting, less well researched local legends.",1422057600,2,293,5.0
6427707,4,B00KH8KWDA,"This was a very interesting collection of urban legend investigations. Touching upon the more entrenched social myths of the stalker on lovers lane, the killer in the house and Candyman they explored the root of the tales, who or where the stories were exploited and what the impact of those legends today. Doing their own research and contacting experts or historians in each location to gain further information they fill in the background of the tales to try to gain an understanding of how an account that could have faded into obscurity bloomed into word of mouth monster lore. The filmmakers Joshua Zeman and Rachel Mills also shy away from contacting family or living descendents of the victims which I thought was tasteful--although they did approach a few people at locations of murders or neighborhoods were violence occurred.

If there was one thing I didn't like it was that they did a lot of conjecture and inference of facts rather that allowing for the fact that somethings were just unknown. I do realize that when doing a documentary it is almost impossible to remain objective but in a few places they did a great deal of leading that I felt was meant to make their material more spectacular than the urban legends reveal might otherwise have been had they just given the truth. Non-fiction is often sadly not that entertaining.",1421625600,,1346,4.852173913043479

6427714,5,B00KH8KWDA,"Really, really enjoyed this - while the 'legend' parts were interesting, what really fascinated me was the stories of the crimes themselves; the film-makers really did a great job of uncovering some true crimes that I'd never heard of (esp. the babysitter murder) and have been reading about ever since. Older cold cases, such as the ones covered here, hardly ever make it to Investigation Discovery or other true crime shows; their producers apparently aren't motivated enough to do some research, hunt to long-unseen places where things happened, interview older people who might know something. These producers did have the motivation, and while the legends are good, the stories about the crimes are fascinating. A good find for true-crime fans!",1419638400,,749,5.25

6427723,5,B00KH8KWDA,"Had its high and low points, naturally, but it was entertaining, nicely descriptive and rather intriguing. As a side note, and something that Amazon no doubt wants not said: you can watch this movie, for free (technically speaking, you pay the monthly membership costs, but you ought to know what I mean) on Hulu. Unlike the shows, their movies have no commercials, nor are they edited for time, content, and so forth. Amazon Prime is far superior in almost all respects, but a good rule of thumb to keep in mind, always, is that if you have em', use em'. And by that, I mean search for the movie, or show, on Netflix, Hulu, on demand (premium channels: HBO, Starz, Showtime, Encore, Cinemax, Xbox Video and so forth) and so on. You can save a penny or two doing this. Very few people actually do this which I find somewhat ironic. Nevertheless, I digress. At any rate, this is a fairly good, accurate and enticing documentary about some of the most gruesome crimes ever committed, and the fear and paranoia they fostered, and the legends they precipitated into. Lastly, outside of premium channel apps and what not, no other source for entertainment has higher quality than Amazon (Prime). I say this not because I'm paid or told to do so (which many reviewers obviously are; self-promoters), but because I've used Amazon Prime since it rolled out several years ago. Nothing comes remotely close to beating their quality and price averages. The best alternative, if you own a Xbox gaming system or utilize Zune, is to buy your movies and shows from Xbox Video.  Their prices are comparable to Prime; however, their rental viewing period falls incredibly below that of Amazon. In conclusion, watch the movie! And like anything else, use some common sense when going to buy s movie or show. Enjoy!",1415664000,7,1796,4.756410256410256

6427727,3,B00KH8KWDA,"I watched this a few months ago, but didn't review it.  Amazon keeps putting it on my review screen to review so I'll review it.  I usually like to write reviews for movies within a few days of watching the movies.  So, I was going to watch this again before I reviewed it, but Amazon wants 4 bucks of my hard earned cash to rent this in SD.  I can't remember if I paid to rent this when I first watched it or saw it on some other streaming service.  The movie may not be fresh in my memory, but I do remember the feeling that it was okay.  It ain't worth paying 4 bucks to watch.

I watched it because the people who made it also made Cropsey.  Cropsey is worth 4 bucks to rent.  It's so creepy and bizarre that I thought it was a mockumentary at first.  That creepy and bizarre Cropsey vibe is missing from Killer Legends.

But, each movie should stand on its own and it may be unfair to compare movies made by the same people.  Two different movies may be great because for different reasons.  Dr. Strangelove, A Clockwork Orange, and The Shining were all directed by Stanley Kubrick.  They're great movies for different reasons.

I feel the need to compare Killer Legends to Cropsey, however, to explain why Killer Legends is mediocre.  Cropsey is just one whacky story.  The guy behind the Cropsey legend was still alive (maybe still is) and the film makers were able to communicate with him, the story was still in the living memory of the community, and it is all very real and tangible.  The film makers were able to spend the entire length of the documentary exploring this really odd story.

Killer Legends, on the other hand, is just pretty much lost to legend.  It was very hard for the film makers to pin anything down or explore the legends in detail.  In fact, they explored four separate legends in the film.  Superficial and had a very network or cable crime show feel to it.

Worth watching for free, but 4 bucks is 4 bucks.",1412985600,3,1942,4.348189415041783

This documentary is in the same sort of scope, taking 4 notorious crimes, and relating to how they have influence modern urban legends, and culture.
The great thing I think this documentary points out, is the fascination which such macabre things, and how we as a modern culture latch on, even if in a symbolic since to atrocities and horrors of a real nature.
Albeit, if you follow this sort of thing at all, you will find that there isn't too much new to be had here, and this is certainly not as good as Cropsey, but it was done well! Worth a watch.",1411344000,,744,4.518518518518518
