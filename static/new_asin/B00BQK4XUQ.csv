5666609,2,B00BQK4XUQ,Video is very low resolution/poor quality transfer even for DVD. Too bad I liked these movies as a kid.,1405641600,,103,4.473684210526316
5666610,1,B00BQK4XUQ,There is no captions on this marvelous 8 movies and I wonder why there is always new companies give it a go to print DVD without captions and not checking if there was captioning on other original DVDs that was produced by Anchor Bay.,1401753600,4,234,4.340909090909091
5666611,3,B00BQK4XUQ,"The main reason I bought these movies was for Angel. Most of the movies are good, but definitely all B rate movies.",1397779200,,115,4.2727272727272725
5666612,5,B00BQK4XUQ,"I have not yet seen all the movies but, just the 3 awesome flicks alone, were worth the admission and then a bucket of popcorn!
Those awesome three are Tuff Turf, Soul Man and Black Moon Rising.

I saw a small part of Night Patrol which looked bizarre and goofy, so I will definitely watch the rest soon for sure.
Girls Just Want to Have Fun is a really known chick flick so female customers should at least enjoy that one. I heard about the Fraternity Vacation so it should be fun, Angel and Reform School Girls I am not sure about but they both looked promising. Even if there are only a few you enjoyed, I think it would still make this set a good bargain.",1397692800,4,659,4.188976377952756
5666613,4,B00BQK4XUQ,"Like many,  I was a teenager in the 1980's & remember these films, some I had not seen since the 80's, so some good & bad memories were refreshed here, I will go down the line here....

Angel (1984)

This is one of the better films that gives us the ugliness of prostitution on Hollywood Blvd, very similar to ""Vice Squad"" two years earlier as far as the look & feel of what the LAPD deals with on a nightly basis, this one has a 15 year old girl (Donna Wilkes from ""Jaws 2"") as Molly Stewart/Angel who we learn was abandoned by her parents & left to fend for herself as she takes up streetwalking while attending College at the same time, however I am sure Wilkes was a lot older than 15, my guess is she was 21 or 22 at the time, I had a serious crush on her as a 14 year old when first saw this back in the 80's, she has a sweet but demure look about her as she is being stalked by a Norman Bates-type killer who apparently has mommy issues, John Diehl (Miami Vice) portrayes him sadisticly without saying a word, Cliff Gorman who looks a lot like Paul Michael Glaser is real good as the concerned cop who wants to help Angel, this one spawned many sequels, but this is the best one.

Fraternity Vacation (1985)

This is another one of those ""gotta get laid"" movies that were everywhere in the 1980's, this one is no exception, but this one is good because it has a heart, Tim Robbins(before he got famous) & Cameron Dye (Valley Girl) are two friends who take Wendell (Stephen Geoffreys) on a Palm Springs vacation in the hopes of you guessed it, they are met by two rivals (Leigh McCloskey & Matt McCoy) who offer a bet on who can lay the sexiest woman there who happens to be Sherrie J. Wilson (Dallas) however things come to a head at the end when she finds out about this little bet, Wendell gets involved with Amanda Bearse(both of whom would later star in ""Fright Night"") who has a overprotective father (John Vernon) who is the Cheif of Police in Palm Springs, & things don't go over well here, I won't spoil the ending, but this one is your standard ""gotta get laid"" film, but it has heart & all is resolved with a very satisfying end.

Tuff Turf (1985)

This was a cheaply made film but it proved the stars that James Spader & Robert Downey Jr. would later become & both still seem to have a steller career today, you could say this is a updated 80's version of ""Rebel Without a Cause"" where Spader tangles with a local gang to win the affections of the gang leader's girlfriend (Kim Richards) who was sweet to look at, Richards would not appear again until 2007's ""Black Snake Moan"" as Christina Ricci's absent mother, even in that film Richards had aged quite well, but here she is the object of Spader's affection & they do share a good chemistry together, Downey is Spader's friend who helps him, all & all this is pretty good given the talent here but really has lot of scenes that make us want to forget some of the fads of the 80's.

Soul Man (1986)

I am not sure this one could get made today with all the political correctness now, to say this one is politically incorrect is an understatement, but if you don't take it seriously, it is a fun movie, C.Thomas Howell(Secret Admirer) is Mark Watson who has been accepted to Harvard Law School, however his dad will not fund his education, so Mark tries to get loans & is denied at every turn, he then tans his skin to accept a scholaship that has been put aside for a black student, Mark of course steals this scholarship & pretends to be black & later becomes smitten with Rae Dawn Chong who is a fellow student, James Earl Jones is the Professor & as always Jones commands the screen in some fun moments, Jones definatelty has all the best lines, this one of course has many then unknown stars such as Julia Louise Dreyfuss & a pre-""Naked Gun"" Leslie Neilsen, all is resolved at the end of course & Mark comes clean about his deception & we get a satisfying conclusion although I think in real life Mark would have been expelled, but hey, it is a movie & very 80's.

Reform School Girls (1986)

This is your typical ""women in prison"" flick, it is nothing you haven't seen before in other films of this nature, but the villian here is Edna, this woman is scary, but you can't help but like her on-screen villian, sure Wendy O'Williams is your typical head prison inmate that no one messes with, but it is Edna that is a blast to watch, she is every female prison inmate's worst nightmare, & has a evil laugh to go with it.

Black Moon Rising (1986)

I had not seen this one since it came out, & now I remember why, it is horrible, if there was ever a high-tech film made on the cheapest budget....it is this one, this is a film I am sure Tommy Lee Jones would love to forget he ever made, I can't summarize this one because I still don't know what it is about, I think it is about some car theives who conduct their business in a L.A. Skyscraper where it seems that L.A. has no other traffic or people, got that?, although Jones had by this time established himself as a bankable star, he had yet to have any real clout, that wouldn't come until the 1990's, Linda Hamilton who at the time was fresh off ""The Terminator"" is given a thankless role, a role she would probably like to forget as well, talk about cheaply made film, this one makes practically no sense, although the car is cool, it is a cheap & I mean cheap imitation of the K.I.T.T. car in ""Knight Rider"".

Girls want to have fun (1985)

Haven't watched this one, once in the 80's was enough

Night Patrol.....same thing as above.

Out of the 8 films I really like 5 of them, so if you want to re-live some cheesy moments from the 80's, this is for you, you would have had to be there to really appreicate these films.",1393459200,36,5751,4.271139705882353
5666614,4,B00BQK4XUQ,Good movies.  There are some in here that are not the mainstream popular.  I grew up in the eighties and haven't seen or heard of a few of these.  They are the normal tacky 80's movies that I love though. Watching these gives anyone a good feel for what this time frame was all about!,1393286400,2,284,4.127272727272727
5666615,4,B00BQK4XUQ,This was a gift but I am considering getting one for myself . I thought it was a good price for this collection of movies.,1390348800,,122,3.92
5666616,3,B00BQK4XUQ,"From cheesy (Girls just Want to have fun) to extremely bad (Reform School girls, Fraternity vacation) and thru average but fun (Soul Man., Tuff turf) this 8-movie pack offers what you expect from What New World Pictures was offering to the teenage crowd in the 80's. Cheaply made movies, simple storylines, with sometimes the heart in the right place, and some others with the camra at the wrong one.
Still, the surprisingly good quality of the dvds gives this capsule some good Times remembering what B movies were 30 years ago.",1383609600,14,529,4.824175824175824

5666619,5,B00BQK4XUQ,"This set exceeds expectations. There is a reason the set is named ""Guilty Pleasures""....it's a fitting description. I got it initially for Reform School Girls and Tuff Turf but they are all worth watching! I will say, there are definitely movies in here that WOULD NOT get made today, and kind of seems surprising that they ever did, so it's an interesting ""time capsule"" if you will of a different era, so keep that in mind if you are easily offended.",1498780800,,452,4.592592592592593

5666622,5,B00BQK4XUQ,Some good and some not so good. I had not seen one of the movies and it was as bad as I thought. The others I truly enjoyed watching them again and will watch them when summer comes and nothing else is worth watching.,1496102400,,217,3.9545454545454546

woman and taught me a lesson in what to look for in terms of young, old, and middle-aged womanhood. Her real name is Constance Cummings and
from what I remember she found what she was lookin for at the end of the rainbow!!!!!! As Grace Jones said in A View to A Kill ""What is there to say!"" The films are great!

While it is more dramatic and the acting isn't the best the store is really different than other movies during the time period. Tuff turff is a little lame but reminds me of the 80s so I enjoy watching it once in a while. Night Patrol and Black moon rising are just okay I hadn't seen them before purchase. Fraternity vacation was typical 80s party movie. Reform School girls is definitely different but does not disappoint in nudity and violence.,1518134400,,682,4.464
