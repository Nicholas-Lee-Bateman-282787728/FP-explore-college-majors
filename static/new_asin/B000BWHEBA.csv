2443551,5,B000BWHEBA,"I've done this workout twice ( although I haven't had time to tack on the core strength section) and really like it a lot. The constant variations on lunges and squats keep you moving and you really do feel it. The instructor is very likeable and inspiring. A knee injury and splintery floor have kept me from trying this barefoot  ( although the Mei shoes I wear get pretty close), but I think it's a great idea. In fact, I recommend this workout to any dancer who works barefoot ( bellydancers, contemporary dancers, etc) as a great crosstraining tool.",1145232000,9,554,4.595959595959596
2443552,5,B000BWHEBA,"Wow! I thought I was advanced with the heavy duty cardio and weight lifting (lots of Cathe stuff) I've been doing, but this workout had me crying for mercy!  It's fun, it's ultra challenging and totally different than anything I've ever done!  The cardio portion is only 17 min. long, but the 15 min. warm up before hand is no walk in the park.  If you put some effort into the warm up, you could definitely consider it cardio, giving you 32 min. of cardio.  The core work at the end is no traditional crunches and lifts.  Some tough plank work, stability work on all fours, a deceptively easy-looking dead bug series, and some bridge work at the end that had me shaking! Throughout, there are yoga moves and a lot of balancing work.  The entire workout is done barefoot, which actually makes it more challenging to keep your balance and stability.  Stacey and her crew show three levels of each exercise, so it's do-able for anyone, but beginners will definitely be working extra hard!  All in all, a well rounded workout, which is a good addition to your routine if you're mostly doing traditional stuff.  Makes you realize how many muscles you have that you maybe aren't working.  Beware, though, it is different, so if you're not into that, you may not like it.  Also, there are plenty of squats in the warm up and cardio portions, but they are actually fun!  Give it a try!",1144454400,38,1378,4.534412955465587
2443553,4,B000BWHEBA,"I was sore for days after I finished 3/4's of the routine the first time I tried it [skipped the core part because I didn't have time]. The next time I did it and finished the whole thing, my body was aching bad for days [again]. I like it though-'coz I know I'd feel worked out after I'm done with it but days later, I'd still have a hard time walking and climbing the stairs. My thighs and buns were sore. It's very different. Just 10 min. into it and I was already feeling it and starting to break a sweat. NO jumping around but LOTS of squats/lunges on the cardio part and I was breathing hard. The poses on the core part were so long and I'd be shaking. A good DVD to include in my collection. You could take this on vacations 'coz there are no equipment required. I gave it just 4 stars because I recommend it to anyone who wants a challenge but I don't do this a lot because I'm kinda scared of the challenge....weird but true. Maybe I should do this more often so the soreness would eventually go away. I found this harder than Billy Blanks' Bootcamp or Jari Love's DVDs. I'd do Leslie Sansone's DVDs the next days just to recover from Stacey's routine....",1207353600,,1164,4.247747747747748
2443554,5,B000BWHEBA,"Although I don't have this video, I do want to purchase it eventually.  I just started to take Stacey's class ""WillPower and Grace,"" at the Bay Club in San Francisco and am intrigued with her clever mix of ballet, pilates, yoga, (maybe Feldenkrais) and other ""ancient"" techniques that she skillfully employs in a one-hour workout.  You have to buy this DVD if only for the proprioceptor movements that she says will help to allay the affects of age on balance.  I just love new and innovative techniques that address all aspects of health and Stacey seems to really understand the reasons behind the seemingly strange things she asks us to to - like spinning - as if we were Dervishes.  Google: inner ear and proprioceptors.  Spinning around and around helps to normalize the inner ear fluids that assist in maintaining our balance and equilibrium.  That's just a start.  We also talk to our toes.  Stacey is a lot of fun and although she is originally from New York, she really belongs in San Francisco.
Oh, and you will get sore - like, in having to use the handicap toilet for a couple of days.",1201219200,,1097,4.618556701030927
2443555,3,B000BWHEBA,"There are a lot of good things about this workout - original moves, a focus on functional fitness, awesome core stability work and enough intensity to really sweat.  Unfortunately, the cardio section relies SO heavily on variations of lunges and squats that I had to subtract 2 stars. My knees were swollen and sore after that section, and I found myself longing for a more balanced effect.  Why not up intensity by adding some upper body, too? Plus, the last part of my body where I need to add more bulk is my thighs.  Check out the exercisers in the video - it looks to me like they have over-developed their quads and hams. No thanks.  I would do this again for the great dynamic stablity moves and the exciting, different style, but it won't be a regular in my routine.",1193356800,12,774,4.468085106382978
2443556,5,B000BWHEBA,"Stacey Lei's style is very controlled.  It's a mixture of Pilates, Yoga and Body Sculpting exercises all rolled into one.  If your following her technique correctly you'll definitely feel it the next day.  Her demeanor is relaxed but motivating at the same time.",1179619200,3,262,5.046511627906977
2443557,5,B000BWHEBA,"I take Stacey's class at Equinox in San Francisco, and she's kept me coming back for WillPower for over two years now. I take this with me on business trips so I can keep up my workout on the road. If you want a challenge that will always leave you sore, this is it!",1168732800,4,266,3.9444444444444446
2443558,1,B000BWHEBA,"This is too different for my taste, I was very disappointed with the instructor and the program.  This just wasn't something I'd recommend to anyone.",1168473600,,149,4.96
2443559,5,B000BWHEBA,"The first time I did this workout was the morning after a long day of international travel. I felt sluggish and achy. For some reason I decided to workout that day and I was so grateful I did. At the time (I was intermediate) I followed the level 1 student and was I ever panting and taking water breaks! The details of the workout have been well explained by other reviewers so you know what it's basically about. When I was done, I felt relaxed, stretched and more limber throughout my body. I actually felt more energized, more clear headed and balanced than when I started! With the 3 levels, one can grow with this workout or adapt to the body's needs. I have a delicate back and I haven't had any problems. Just doing this 2x a week for 3 weeks I noticed a marked improvement in my endurance while doing other videos. I'm now an advanced exercizer and recently discovered I still enjoy this workout so it'll be back in my rotation. It has 3 chapters: Warm up & Cardio, Stretch and Core. The entire workout is about 65 minutes or you can break it down.

Great cuing, no crazy, difficult moves and Stacy's encourages you without being over the top with the enthusiam. A wonderful workout!",1159660800,,1192,4.442922374429224
2443560,5,B000BWHEBA,"This is a great workout.  It's the first dvd I have of Stacey's but I really like it and based on this one, I'd definately buy more of hers down the track.

After a 15 minute warmup, there is floor aerobics for about 18 minutes, then nice stretches and then to finish off, there is floor toning.  It's tough, but fun because you have to challenge yourself.  The cardio section is using a lot (A LOT) of squats and lunges, and the arm movements are optional (you'll see why when you try this for yourself).  The floor workout at the end is a lot of pilates movements so that's good for your core, making this a complete workout to get your heart pumping and your fat burning.  I highly recommend this, because it's definately going to give you results.  I've seen them already even after 12 days.  I like this alot.",1152662400,4,814,4.344370860927152
2443561,4,B000BWHEBA,"This video workout has lots and lots of squats, so please be prepared for that!  and I meant ALOT!

Usually I get sore muscles the 2nd day prior to the workout, but after I did this video, I immediately noticed that my gluts are sore... and the next day was even worse...

Aslo, the entire workout was done in a very fast speed with full range of motion, so safety is also something you want to watch out when you are doing it.",1151539200,14,427,4.120481927710843
2443562,5,B000BWHEBA,"I read the reviews and since they described it as challenging, I thought I'd try it to add something new to my routine.  However, I didn't really think it would be that big of a challenge because I currently run, lift weights, and do yoga, with some pilates, Tae-bo, and spinning thrown in on occasion.  Boy, was I surprised!  This had me utterly wiped out at the end, and left me with sore muscles the next day.  I didn't even think I could get sore muscles anymore...

The warm-up is a psuedo cardio session in and of itself, but by the end of the 17 min. actual cardio workout I was wondering if I could even make it to the end.  The instructor has different levels that the viewer can follow, 3 being the most advanced, 1 for beginners.  At first, I could literally only do level 1, but now I am able to do mostly level 2, with a a few level 3 moves thrown in.  Sometimes, just closing your eyes during a balancing move is considered level 3.  The 9 min.stretching portion between the cardio section and the core workout provide a nice break, yet keeps your heart-rate up a bit.  The 25 min. core workout is a a great antidote to the cardio section, nonetheless, it is still quite a workout!  By the end, I am shaking, and relieved it is at an end, because I certainly am!  I would highly recommend this program to anyone seeking to challenge and maximize their exercise routine.",1149724800,15,1383,4.33852140077821
8093521,5,B000BWHEBA,"I am a half-marathoner, and much like the other reviewers this workout really challenged me. At the base of good running form is foot structure, and I've began supplementing this workout DVD with my regular training. Already in the past month, I've moved to a zero drop running shoe and have noticed I'm consciously aware of running.
I had the opportunity to interview Stacey about the workout- you may be interested to read more. http://activetastylife.com/2014/04/07/barefoot-cardio-willpower-grace-method/",1399075200,,508,5.786666666666667
8093522,5,B000BWHEBA,"This is a real great workout.  Its not high impact but it sure does work out your body.  No equipment required, not even shoes.  I actually find it to be better bare footed.  I would call this a muscle and strength work out and a super nice cool down at the end.  It has become one of my favorite DVD's when I am in the mood for a decent workout without the heart pounding.",1396569600,,373,3.9864864864864864
8093523,5,B000BWHEBA,"I LOVE willPower & grace - as an experienced exerciser, I really look for a challenge with fitness DVD's. This does not disappoint.  And, as a staunch critic of fitness DVD programs, I feel this combines the most effective exercises from multiple exercise programs to create a well-calculated, well-balanced toning and strengthening workout that also enhances endurance and increases mind-body awareness.

Yes, it really does ALL of that.

The warm up is quick-paced but really does what its supposed to - warms up your muscles and provides dynamic stretching to help loosen you up. The cardio segment, truly, is ALL squats and lunges - I personally LOVE this, but if you have bad knees or a weak lower back, this would definitely be a segment you should watch before doing.

Both the warm-up and cardio segments also feature several exercises that help improve balance - an element too many exercises programs do not emphasize.  Your feet will not know what hit them - you will need to use those toes and even the arches in your feet to maintain your posture and keep you standing.  The real benefit of barefoot training!

The stretching segment is a good segue to the core routine - my FAVORITE part of the program. There are only a few basic exercises in the core segment but they WORK. Even though they are differentiated as spine strengtheners, ab strengtheners, etc., essentially all the exercises are interrelated and keep your entire core working with each one.  You will learn to embrace plank and bridge with as much love and respect as I have.

The entire program is a little over an hour, but it really breezes by if you focus on the technical execution of the exercises and PUSH yourself - it is definitely a program where the benefits your receive reflect the effort you put into the workout.  You will feel energized from this - not exhausted!  Cannot recommend enough!",1290297600,,1884,4.783950617283951
8093524,4,B000BWHEBA,I take this class at my local gym and absolutely feel in love with it. The only problem is that they only offer it once a week. When I found this DVD I was SO exicted. It was made in 2006 so I was a little worried but it's basically the same thing. There has been some updating and more moves in the class I take so I hope they put out a new DVD soon but until then this is awesome!,1262390400,,382,3.6707317073170733
8093525,5,B000BWHEBA,"This is an intense and muscular workout.  Uses basic moves, like the squat and muscular yoga.  makes you sweat! I've taken these calsses at the gym- this is a great intro to her program",1261267200,,185,4.411764705882353
8093526,5,B000BWHEBA,"lots of squats, great overall body workout.
The workout is a lot of fun, but I don't think that this is really for beginners. I took a willpower and grace class, and the instructor did these same moves, except at a slower pace. This video goes at a little faster pace. There are 3 levels. I've been doing the willpower and grace class consistently for two months, and I'm still on level one. Good news is that I'll probably be working out to this dvd for a long time, since I'm not quite at level two yet.

I like that this workout doesn't require any other props or equipment. I also like the Barefoot training. I wish that the instructor spent more time explaining the positioning of your feet and your body. I felt that if I had not taken the willpower and grace class, that I would have been confused on the positioning. The positioning is really important in keeping your balance.

Overall, it's a great workout.",1251504000,,917,4.4523809523809526
8093527,5,B000BWHEBA,"I absolutely recommend this workout to every person who wants to switch up there boring sweat routine.  It doesn't look hard when you watch it first, but when you participate in the exercise it makes you sweat like crazy.  I am a Fitness instructor and I now teach this exercise to all types of people and ages.  So...Go for it! You'll be hooked!",1238112000,,346,4.4603174603174605
8093528,5,B000BWHEBA,"OMG! I've done Willpower and Grace before and I'm not totally out of shape (I hope!!) but this was hard! Not for the faint of heart but rewarding! My advice is to watch, at least the beginning, once before you do it if you haven't done Willpower and Grace before. Good luck!",1226361600,,274,4.288461538461538
8093529,4,B000BWHEBA,"For anyone who likes to move their body, challenge their heart, and open their mind.",1224547200,,84,4.666666666666667
8093530,5,B000BWHEBA,I haven't actually done this video but I have taken the Willpower & Grace class lots of times at my local gym with a certified instructor. The first time around I could barely make it through and my legs were sore and weak for several days. I'm happy to say that with consistent exercise including the Willpower & Grace class I can now make it through the routine without  being completely wiped out afterward.  WP&G is the only way I can force myself to do lunges and squats.  I'll be moving soon and unable to take the WP&G class so I'm sure this video will become part of my home fitness.,1218153600,,591,4.306306306306307
