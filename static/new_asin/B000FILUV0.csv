2568033,1,B000FILUV0,"I bought this dvd without doing any research. Big Mistake! I should have gone to netflix and looked at the reviews. I bought it based on the credits on the dvd cover. Don't believe the hype! I'm glad if this dvd moved some people but please be honest about what is contained in the film!!! Dead Kenedys, Bad Brains (1:00 minute of club footage?) no real interviews with the stated bands.  Unless you are a huge ""Cipher"" fan this dvd is probably not for you.",1154908800,5,457,4.376470588235295
2568034,5,B000FILUV0,"When you get right down to the meat of things, life is a confusing prospect. The interviewees in this documentary have found themselves in a position to be able to look inward because of their isolation from societal norms. The one thing that holds together this short film is the humor and wisdom that has developed among the Afro-punks. They have managed to grow beyond the society around them by exploring the depths of a lifestyle that stereotypically, they should shun. Of course, their monologues are full of self-contradicting statements, but that's the nature of the beast. I've been a black rocker since 1982, and this film was a Godsend to me.",1152662400,2,653,4.839285714285714
8123240,4,B000FILUV0,Great documentary! However I didn't like the fact that it was presented in a windowbox format (black boxes on all sides of the picture). Kind of annoying. Do all versions of this movie look this way?,1436659200,,199,4.555555555555555
8123241,4,B000FILUV0,"This is a great documentary.  It is well worth seeing because of its historic value to the afro-punk movement, and to punk rock in general.  I wish there were more like this.  Showed it to my daughter so she could understand her Mom's younger days.  When she asked me what a moshpit was, and she then asked if crumping was its' baby.

8123242,2,B000FILUV0,"This movie was ok....I was expecting it to be more about the punk scene and not just a bunch of black kids complaining. Granted I'm a black female in the punk scene, well in my city the underground, squat, basement show, DIY scene. This movie was rather disappointing. While I have experienced most of the issues they talked about, It just felt like complaining and I found my self thinking ""Deal with it"" or ""What are you going to do about it?"" through the majority of this movie....",1343692800,2,484,4.511363636363637
8123243,2,B000FILUV0,"Alot of the isolation these people feel is due to their atypical appearance and tastes in music; however, It is no longer unusual to see black teenage boys  wearing tight jeans, gauges in their ears and dyeing their hair....so, eccentric, non-traditional styles and preferences are no longer taboo amongst  black youth; making this film somewhat dated.  The people in this film were hard to connect to as we only got snippets and summaries of their lives in brief interviews. It feels like each of these people had 7-minute interviews that were chopped up into a movie; it's really a bunch of mini-interviews, not a documentary about people's lives.  And listening to them whining about how hard it is to be black wasn't particularly interesting. I am black so I know what it's like; that's old news. Give me something new.",1340323200,,823,4.857142857142857
8123244,2,B000FILUV0,"I'm a suburban white girl, in my mid thirties, and I have come to realize that punk rock is for us old folks now.  Having been in a few scenes here and there, there is always the token black kid among them.  I was looking for a real innovation, perhaps a personal story or two.  Instead, I got a very generalized look at why others are punk rock.  Alienation, feeling outside of society, feeling misunderstood are all a part of it.  These black kids that were profiled in this documentary were one of the few black people in their community.  They will naturally look to what the white kids are doing for entertainment.  Maybe this was with limited access to cable television and the Internet, but it's really not surprising how black teenagers will look to punk rock in some places and hip hop in others.

There are no surprises here.  The only highlight was seeing a few interviews with members of the Dead Kennedys.  Otherwise, not very entertaining.",1234828800,,953,4.585798816568047
8123245,1,B000FILUV0,THIS MOVIE HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH PUNK!! EXPECT FOR BAD BRAINS AND THE DEAD KENNEDYS THAT COME OUT FOR LIKE 2 SECONDS.,1198972800,,118,4.173913043478261
8123246,4,B000FILUV0,"This dvd was dope. Because it had artist who i didn't know existed, better the world doesn't really know exist. it had artist that can but inspirational but you'll never see their videos on b.e.t. which i think is wrong b.e.t needs to put black rock n roll artist on their channel. they need  artist like, bad brains, fishbone and etc. Not just so damn gospel s... on the air so it can influnce black children to be  rock n rollers not just singers n rappers.",1183593600,4,459,4.325581395348837

directed by James Spooner
approx. 66 minutes

This is a very good movie dealing with black identity in the world of hardcore punk.  The movie is made up of testimonials from several black punks talking about subjects such as the relationship of traditional African culture to body modification in punk fashion, interracial dating, being a ""safe black"", and having mostly white friends.  What I like about the movie is the way it doesn't distinguish between the experiences of black suburban high school kids and famous black punks such as D.H. Peligro (of DEAD KENNEDYS).  The interviewees are all ages and from all over the country.  The movie is edited in a way that emphasizes common thoughts and experiences (such as the importance of BAD BRAINS).  They correct misconceptions that people may have about them and their background.  Some of the punks do get a little more camera time, such as the zine author from California and the black nationalist singer of the band CIPHER.  The more ""in-depth"" segments show some of the ways black punks set themselves apart and how central identity politics are in their projects.

This movie is NOT a collection of archival footage that aims to deliver a history of black punks.  At the end of the movie, some of the interview subjects are asked to name as many punk bands with black members as they can.  If you'd like a thorough directory of black involvement in punk rock, look up ROCTOBER magazine's website for an extensive list.

This movie is a welcome addition to the recent crop of punk movies since it examines an area of the music scene which often goes undocumented.  I look forward to seeing more movies from the director James Spooner.  You do not have to like punk music (or be black) to enjoy this movie.",1173571200,10,1780,4.755700325732899
8123248,5,B000FILUV0,"if your racial identity has ever been questioned whether you are black, white, asian, latino, native american, middle eastern, or what have you, you should definitely check this dvd out. you don't even have to be black or into rock music at all to get something out of it.

maybe you're the only black kid on the lacrosse team

maybe you're a white rapper

maybe you're the only male hetero ballet dancer at your dance school

maybe you're the only asian dude on the basketball team

maybe you're the only girl on the football team

maybe you're the only muslim in idaho

this documentary in many ways tackles a lot of the existential realities related to those types of experiences; experiences of isolation and rejection by a larger more dominant society. of course, every different experience is unique but there are some commonalities among them and things to be learned.",1154995200,7,875,4.793333333333333
