3446995,5,B001AD54AC,"Cleopatras Daughter is a very good film of its type, Debra Paget is raveshing,
very good story,nice print though only Pan & Scan.good color.

 It comes on a DVD-R from Sinister Cinema who always do a good job on there public domain films.

Highly Recomended.",1227398400,2,258,4.688888888888889
3446996,1,B001AD54AC,"This film was not only a waste of time and money, but the acting and dialogue was unbelievably diabolical.  I just couldn't believe how this film ever was released.  At one point I actually thought they had frozen Debra Paget's face, it was just RIGID with some words coming out of her mouth.

The sound and quality of the DVD matched its acting - extremely bad to say the least.  It was a total waste of money on my part, and I certainly would not recommend it unless you are THAT keen.

I enjoy watching anything to do with ancient Egypt, but this film was torture to me and it goes straight into the bin.",1220918400,10,607,4.243478260869566

3447000,4,B001AD54AC,"Although the U.S. version is called Cleopatra's Daughter the original European version has nothing to do with Cleopatra and is titled The Tomb of the Pharaoh. It is set in an Egyptian period far earlier than that of Cleopatra and Debra Paget plays the captive daughter of an Assyrian king who is forced to marry the Pharaoh. In English language prints the narrator says she is the daughter of Antony and Cleopatra sent to live with the Assyrian king to save her from the Romans. It's an entertaining movie with a good cast, particularly Debra Paget and Ettore Manni. The only widescreen version was available in Spain. Unfortunately it has never been out in a decent version on DVD in the U.S. Too bad as it deserves better.",1415491200,7,724,4.6640625

3447005,4,B001AD54AC,"Pretty good sword-and-sandal with the ravishing Debra Paget.  She plays Shila, the last surviving daughter of Pharaoh Cleopatra, raised by the Assyrian royal family as their own.  When Assyria is conquered by the present Pharaoh and their rulers exterminated Shila is forced into marriage with the sadistic tyrant.  Her only solace is her love for the court physician, who returns her feeling.  I bought the Alpha DVD release which is probably the best out there.  That is not saying much because the film needs restoring and re-mastering.  Hopefully a good version will be released soon.  Otherwise the film is recommended for fans of this genre.",1400803200,6,647,5.104761904761904
3447006,2,B001AD54AC,"This film could have been a great one like ""Land of the Pharohs"" or ""The Egyptian"", but it didn't quite come off.  The story of Cleopatra's daughter is a very interesting tale, but this film did a poor job and didn't even tell a good story.",1400630400,,240,4.217391304347826
3447007,2,B001AD54AC,"I noticed a listing for the disappointing (Fritz Lang) India Epic, which I bought.  Saw Debra Paget's name, and decided to see if she was in anything else like that.  Sure enough, she was.  And, being in one of those moods, I also sprang for a few other Italian goodies from the same period and featuring stars of the second level of whom we've all heard.

First off, I suppose I get where Sinister Cinema is coming from with their drive-in theatre restorations.  But I nevertheless wish the transfers were a little bit higher caliber restorations.  At a couple places, it was hard to see what was happening, the images were so degraded.  The color was very uneven, suggesting more than one source was used, with no attempt to even things out.

I don't know who wrote the screenplay, but he had no business near a typewriter; and the acting by Paget and Purdom was indifferent to bad.  Imaginative movies of this period in Italy and perhaps elsewhere in Europe, were often intended for adult audiences, and by American standards, could sometimes be a little racy. This didn't even really achieve that.

If you'd like to see more of ms. Paget, get the Lang Epic; her dance scenes are worth a second or third look.  If you just want something from the period that's at least fun to watch, get The Prodigal, with Lana Turner.  Cleopatra's Daughter is an interesting movie from a historical point of view, but not very entertaining.",1391990400,,1428,4.645418326693227
3447008,1,B001AD54AC,Not much to say as the heading says it all.  I guess Debra was in need of some money  when she took this job.,1390867200,,109,3.5

3447010,3,B001AD54AC,sadly it is very poor quality  focus is blurry perhaps because of age of original film ? but love the story line and of course because DEBRA PAGET is my favourite actress.,1375228800,,171,4.34375

3447012,1,B001AD54AC,uch.  thought it would be campy.  no such luck  it was just embarrassing.  need six more words to finish this.,1364083200,,110,4.35
3447013,4,B001AD54AC,"Debra Paget was riding high as the exotic beauty of the ""sword-and-sandles"" when she starred in IL SEPOLCRO DEI RE in 1960. Coming hot on the heels of Ms Paget's sultry turn in Fritz Lang's ""Indian Epic"", the film was dubbed into English as CLEOPATRA'S DAUGHTER, though it's links to accurate historical events involving the Queen of the Nile are slight at best.

Enslaved after the abrupt, death-ridden end of Cleopatra's rule in Egypt, Cleo's secret daughter Shila (Debra Paget) enters into an arranged marriage with Nemorat (Corrado Pani), the ever-so-slightly mad new Pharoah. Shila is also loved from afar by court physician Resi (Ettore Manni), but their romance will have to conquer death itself. When Shila is framed for the murder of Nemorat, she is punished by being buried alive along with her husband. Resi abducts the tomb's architect (Robert Alda) and recruits a small group of bandits in an attempt to save her...

I've always had a soft spot for CLEOPATRA'S DAUGHTER, mainly because of Debra Paget, of whom I'm a great admirer. In my view she is one of the most fascinating female stars from the golden age, appearing in everything from ""Les Miserables"" to ""House of Strangers"" and ""The Ten Commandments"", perhaps her most prestigious film. Paget's perfomance as Shila in CLEOPATRA'S DAUGHTER is strong; indeed she might as well be reprising her previous role of Seetha from the ""Indian Epic"", a character who found herself in a similar situation to what Shila does in this film! The English dub of CLEOPATRA'S DAUGHTER features Paget's own speaking voice, something which sadly didn't happen in Fritz Lang's ""Indian Epic"" (re-cut as ""Journey to the Lost City"" for international markets). Whilst it probably did well at drive-ins and smaller theater chains, CLEOPATRA'S DAUGHTER might have been a bigger hit if it had instead been released three years later, when the world truly was ""Cleopatra"" crazy, thanks to the 1963 Elizabeth Taylor film.",1331942400,4,1960,5.046296296296297
3447014,4,B001AD54AC,"I saw this as one of the movies on my 50 pack of warrior movies. It is all swords and sandals flicks. I was pleasantly surprised at this one. It had great scenery and color. It definitely needs a restoration though, it was not a crisp clear picture but I could still see the potential. The scenes inside the pyramid going through secret passages was pretty cool. Very reminiscent of the Indiana Jones movies during those scenes. I liked the plot and I thought the acting was fine, especially by Debra Paget. I think I'm better off with my version than purchasing the separate disc from Synegy. It doesn't sound like they remastered anything. I bet I have the same print on my 50 pack as this one. Too bad, if it were actually remastered and any cut out parts restored I would buy it.",1308268800,8,783,4.406896551724138

The print on this DVD-R from independant outfit Sinister Cinema is reasonable enough for the price, though it does differ slightly from the original video release (on the Ubat label as I recall) which, up until now, I've been more familiar with.  This print, which I suspect was created for the film's eventual TV distribution, opens with a shorter version of the main titles (I do so love composer Giovanni Fusco's swirling, romantic main theme), and a brief explanation of the historical events which frame the story.  There's also an early scene with Shila, Queen Tegi and the handmaidens which is strangely missing.  Colour is quite good; the only extra is a trailer.  There are no chapters, you may only progress through the film in 5-minute increments.",1305158400,16,2728,5.017738359201774
