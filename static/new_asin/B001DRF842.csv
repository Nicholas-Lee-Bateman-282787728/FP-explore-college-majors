3537090,5,B001DRF842,I think pikkon should be on the cover cuz he rocks. great saiyaman could also be on the cover too cuz he is hilarious. anyway this should be a good dvd to buy. love to watch it in Japanese.,1223424000,,189,3.871794871794872
3537091,5,B001DRF842,"I agree with past reviewers that these are the more weaker sagas, but they do give a chance for a bit of levity and character development for Gohan and his relationships with his family and his new school mates, especially Videl, who he teaches to fly and later marries and has a daughter, Pan, in the GT series.  But I think it really should have been Supreme Kai and Kibito on the cover.  It is because of them that the Z fighters are forewarned of the coming of Babidi and the inevitable awakening of Majin Buu, which is the focus and last great battle of the Z series.  As an aside, I really did like the battle between Goku and Pikkon in the after world martial arts tournament as well.

And also, dosen't this cover look like the piccolo from the fight with Radditz in the beginning of the series?  Come on Funimation, get your freakin' act together.",1222646400,,856,4.3924050632911396
3537092,4,B001DRF842,"I'm glad to see that this is coming out right behind season six! But, why piccolo on the cover???? They should have went with gohan at SSJ 2 as a teen. But, this saga is really just a filler until Buu is released. Although Goku and Vegeta gives us funny moments throughout the tournament and up to babidi's spaceship! Great Saga but not better the Fusion and Kid Buu! Hurry Up Funimation!",1221868800,,388,4.402777777777778
3537093,5,B001DRF842,"Season 7 takes place after the drool-worthy ending to the Cell games in which Gohan obliterates Cell with his one-handed Kamehameha wave.

Now a few years later Gohan is ready to start High School which means no more home school from Chi Chi.

However, directly before this Goku takes part in a filler martial arts tournament from beyond the grave and we get to see Frieza, King Cold, The Ginyu Force and even Cell again one more time.  The final battle of the tournament is Goku (duh) vs. Pikkon under supervision of the Grand Kai.  This part honestly has nothing to do with the overall plot of the series and was just a filler section before the next arc starts.

Back to Gohan (and the actual story).  Gohan is on his way to school, sees a robbery, and transforms to a SSJ to beat his enemies in a flash.

Now the whole town is going on about the ""Gold Fighter"". So, in order to draw attention from his new superhero Gohan creates another superhero with a disguise so people won't know its him.  He creates probably the most godawful yet super hilarious costume and character.  He calls himself the ""Great Saiyaman"" and does little dances to intimidate the enemy.

If somebody who has never watched DBZ sees these episodes as their introduction into the series they probably would turn away immediately, but believe me this part is not THAT bad.  I would honestly rather watch this part of the series 5 times in a row than sit through GT again.

Gohan goes to meet Videl, daughter of Hercule, at school and befriends her.  She eventually discovers his true identity and in order to prevent blackmail Gohan teaches her how to fly.  Goten and Trunks also achieve SSJ while training.

Season 7 might dwell into the World Martial Arts Tournament that takes place next, but probably not very far if it does.  Basically mid way through the tournament is when the next Saga starts and we learn of the new deadly threat to the world.  Majin Buu.

Season 7 is an essential part of the DBZ collection seeing as how it ties the end of the Cell Saga and beginning of the Buu saga together.  The episodes may be most non-serious of the series, but they are there for a reason.

If you've been collecting from Season One be sure to pick up your copy when its released.",1221350400,27,2257,4.498771498771498
3537094,5,B001DRF842,it not like i care about the cover! but why wasn't gohan in front of the cover of season six but it was goku again! and season seven is piccolo while this season piccolo does do as much they should of put him in season two! but who cares atlesst we got the series?,1221177600,,264,3.9074074074074074
3537095,5,B001DRF842,"The Season Six boxset hasn't been released yet and already FUNImation is planning the release of Season Seven (from what I gather will include the Great Saiyaman and World Tournament sagas). Although the two forementioned sagas are the weakest of the entire series IMHO, it's nice to see they're getting this set out in time for Christmas instead of waiting until February as the past release pattern has showed us.

So with Season Seven consisting of the Great Saiyaman and World Tournament sagas, that leaves the Babidi and Majin Buu sagas for Season Eight and the Fusion and Kid Buu sagas for Season Nine, thus wrapping up the DBZ season boxsets.

I'm confused as to why Piccolo is on the box art like many others on this site, but for me, it's not that important.",1220659200,4,767,4.674074074074074

They're watching it in the original Japanese version, and they absolutely love it. They made me remember what it was like watching this as a kid as their excitement mirrored my own. Especially when the major turning points in the shows happen. If you are an old fan, and want to introduce the show to someone the show stands on its own as a classic. You won't go wrong with this.

Oh, If you are watching the English Dub, and you are the type who puts on subtitles while watching, you will find that the subtitles will not match the spoken dialogue. It actually seems like the dialogue you read are the translations of the Japanese version. Just watch out for that.",1487894400,2,782,4.319727891156463

3537231,5,B001DRF842,just got it a little while ago today.  i have 6 other seasons of dragon ball z and this one is by far the best.  i got it used and it was flawless when i got it. 10 outta 10,1453939200,,173,3.3
3537232,4,B001DRF842,"There is a lot of filler episodes in this season, however it's still a lot of fun especially if you are already six seasons dedicated.  If you're just getting into Dragon Ball Z, this is not the place to start.  It's a nice little transition season between the Cell Games saga and the Babidi/Majin Buu sagas.  The only thing that really irritated me is that this could definitely have been brought down to 4 discs, as the last 2 discs only have 3 episodes on each but for some reason or another (probably because Funimation wants to charge more) there are six discs.  All of these season sets don't really have any sort of special features, unless you are interested in watching it in the original japanese.",1453852800,,707,4.543307086614173

3537242,5,B001DRF842,"Out of most of the Seasons in the Z arc this is one of the shorter ones. With 25 episodes Instead of thirty or so like the average DBZ season. But This box set is the Great Saiyman and the World Tournament sagas. So this is right after Cells defeat and features Goku's time in the other world tournament. Gohan's time as a ""super hero"", and the Strongest under the heavens tournament were Supreme Kai, and Kibito. This is one of the seasons that can be skipped but what fan would want to?

The Physical box set has some problems though. They no longer come with booklets to serve as a character/ Episode guide and that is a bummer. Also the thin plastic disc holders used can break easily. Over all I wish they had the booklet's still but its the best way to get the series.

Total run time is 565 minutes or 10.9 hours.

Also we see Videl for the first time and Vegeta punches his kid, so that's also worth mentioning.

**PLEASE DISREGARD REGION WARNING IN LISTING** I just purchased this again, ignoring the Region B warning in the listing as I was fairly certain this was a Region A/B release, and it is.  This WILL play in your US Bluray players.

I don't even consider the clipping an issue at this point.  This is the way DBZ should be watched on HD displays, period.  I wouldn't have it any other way.  There are a few sequences and episodes where the cleaning took a blurring tool more than a sharpening tool, but overall, they did a fantastic job bringing this to the big screen.  It's good to see such care taken to update the Orange Box releases for HD.

If they repeat this process for Dragon Ball and GT, they will most assuredly have sold me at least six more box sets, even after DBZ finishes up.

No joke, FUNimation has made me look at other HD releases with a spoiled set of eyes.  I can't watch Akira on Bluray because it looks like it hasn't even been touched when compared to the care that went into DBZ.  It's CRAZY, and I'm serious!

If not then your not likely to buy the other seasons so why this one but if you do than this season is just a great as choice as many others. Held by many to be a fill-in or (spoiler alert) catch-up season after the resulting time jump post-Cell Games I find what this season lacks in fighting it makes up for in character development and is a welcome change of pace showing a bit more of the human side to the old z fighters as well as introducing a couple new ones. If you like the show soley for the action you won't miss much but if you like the show for the characters then this season is great and one of a kind as I believe it shows more development of the fighters as people then any other season and introduces gohan's future wife videl who is a great challenge for him. I recomend this season for anyone who wants the whole DBZ story and experience.",1413072000,,939,4.108695652173913

Picture quality is also terrible having lost all fine details and the artist's original shading is smeared out to nothing. It doesn't even include dub-titles!

3537382,1,B001DRF842,"Bad product.

For example:

- 20% of the original footage is missing.

- Colours are badly corrected and over-saturated.

- Brightness and contrast are over-driven.

- Heavy DVNR.

- Painted backgrounds were totally messed up by DVNR.

- DVNR caused a strange smearing and artifacting in quick moving
scenes.

- Grain removal (Grain is part of the image. It's just how film works. Grain
holds detail. Wiping grain means wiping detail. There's no way around it at this point).

- Sometimes, there is a strange kind of earthquake-like unnatural jittering present.

- Artificial digital camera pans that were added by FUNimation.

- Artificial sharpening that were added by FUNimation..

- The ending is zoomed in by at least by 30%.

- Blacks are crushed even more than on other releases from FUNimation (dark areas are completely black).

- 16:9 cropping made many scenes look claustrophobic. The fact that it is selective, heavily affects the original director's vision when only the top or only the bottom of the frame is shown. I'm not even mentioning camera
moves.

3537385,4,B001DRF842,"It was certainly nice to have ALMOST a full season of calmness going on, though it's distantly the shortest season in the series.

As with all Funimation DBZ seasons, this is not good to watch in its English dub. Its voice actors seem very rushed and flaw-tolerant. I instinctively watched it in Japanese, but in curiosity, I switched it to English during Spopovitch's fight with Videl. I've never been more embarrassed while watching something, and by myself! Some anime yells and grunts are annoying, but I almost wet myself over Spopovitch's compulsive lack of yelling and surplus of through-teeth inhaling.

Aside the horrible sound or accuracy in the English dub, this is a great season to watch when you wanna see something involving latter Dragon Ball characters without harsh problems or action.

Some other reviews might say it's a great season to bond with the characters or something. Tryhards. There's hardly any of that. It's calm, but other than Videl, Gotten, and Trunks, you already have a full idea of everyone. In less than an episode, you figure all 3 of them out. The story moves on.

Another bother in the English dub is how different Gohan comes off. He doesn't seem at all like a shy, passive-unless-troubled kid trying to study. He seems more grown, confused, and overconfident. This carries on through the rest of Funimation's DBZ and DBGT dubs.

Still, this is easily one of the best Dragon Ball seasons. Leave the English dub alone, and you'll be fine.",1404604800,,1479,4.876494023904383
3537386,5,B001DRF842,"Season 7 contains episodes 195-219, and I'm sure everyone knows that these blu-ray releases are in 16:9, but that doesn't bother me that much.  The colors look great, and it's still DBZ.  Plus the cropping isn't as bad as the Orange Bricks.

It looks very dapper next to its brothers and sisters on my bookshelf all snug and perfect. It is where it belongs and I am providing it a happy home.

3537389,4,B001DRF842,"Not too long ago I watched the ""Season 7"" of Dragon Ball Z on the Orange Bricks which the quality looked very good, even though they were missing lines and the cropping chopped off heads, eyes and more but overall it was fairly decent though for this release I really hope that the cropping is far better (wish it wasn't really cropped though) and since these Season Blu-rays the missing lines have never been a problem any more, at least.

""Season 7"" covers episodes 195 to 219, so basically the Otherworld Tournament, Great Saiyaman and Tenkaichi Tournament arcs.

Also, with Majin Boo arc receiving a Kai treatment in Japan it'll be good to have these released as from what I've seen the pacing and editing begs to be better for the Great Saiyaman arc specifically the rest is great, but from what I read there'll be two editions of Dragon Ball Kai: Majin Boo arc, i.e, one's ""Japan Edition"" and the other ""International Edition"" meaning Japan gets the series with around 49 episodes (half of what was in Z) and Internationally we get 69 episodes.",1402185600,11,1050,4.6702702702702705

Ironically, the only episodes in the Saiyaman Saga I didn't like were the 2 where important things happened, the one where Videl discovered Gohan's identity & the one where they learned Goku was coming back.  Aside from that, it was good, until Videl's battle in the ring, which was waaaaaaaaaay too long.  I have seasons 8 & 9, but am holding out on watching them since I heard they will be doing a Kai edition of the Buu Saga.  I'll probably keep this one even when I upgrade, because it does have some of the best filler ever (& in case they cut that hilarious Cell Games re-enactment out).",1368230400,,744,4.285714285714286

The remastering quality is good, just the cutting of the frames that really irritates me. Having been moved aspect ratios, the top and bottom have both been cut off leaving you with a lesser image. It would have been nice to have the opening scene like I remember it to, I'm not a big fan of the japanese version, and what the heck is the ending scene all about?!

Other than that, the marathon feature is  a brilliant idea if you plan watching a DVD in full. The casing and DVDs themselves look professional and good enough to sit on your DVD shelf.",1361232000,,675,4.299212598425197

Gohan is in high school now and he's trying to balance his school life with his superhero duties. The World Tournament is about to begin, and Goku is about to come back and fight. My favorite feature of this box set is the marathon feature option. This allows you to watch all the episodes on each disc w/o any previews or opening/closing songs. It makes everything flow so much smoother. The video and audio quality is also very good in this collection. It is presented in 5.1 dolby digital. The dialogue has also been revised.

If you are looking for epic battles you might be disappointed. However, this is probably my favorite season in the series because viewers really get a glimpse into how the characters have developed (it begins seven years after Cell is defeated). Many of the characters have changed for the better, especially Vegeta, and we are also introduced to Goten and kid Trunks. Even though there is a lot of fluff I think the episodes are very entertaining and I even found myself laughing out loud many times during the World Tournament. The end of the season becomes more serious since it's paving the way for the Majin Buu saga, so even viewers looking for classic Dragon Ball Z action will be satisfied with this.",1342051200,,825,4.696551724137931

Now that technology has changed since the 90s, a lot of remakes are being made. This version is from the original Japanese intro and outros. I grew up on the 90s version of the intro and outros(definitely not the same and the 90s version was in English) so for this one I was a bit surprised but the picture is clear as it can be. Also, it is NOT like the Toonami version that the US was given. It is the original Japanese version of the show. The shows are in English, clear, precise, no commercials, just a small 10 second cut away, in each episode. I can sit an watched these all day because as you know back on TV the commercials was so annoying so to have no commercials and you transition well between shows, it is a TREAT. Go get your popcorn, and relax cause you will be officially apart of the show.

3537464,4,B001DRF842,"First of all I love DB and DBZ. I have since the first time I watched Goku as a young boy be ridiculously naive about the differences between boys and girls lol.

Now though we are far, far ahead of that time, and we see Gohan as a teenager going to highschool, the introduction of Satan's daughter Videl,the reintroduction of most of Gokus old friends, and the introduction of the final bad guy(s) of the DBZ series, Babidi and Majin Buu (though we don't actually see them).

As for the season itself I loved it. I loved the change of pace, the fun, goofier atmosphere of Gohan's school troubles and of seeing young Trunks with his father. The two tournaments (both the Otherworld tournament in which Goku fights and the World Tournament)were enjoyable in that we get to see the guys (and girl) fight without the fights being horribly drawn out and filled with 'macho screaming' which love of the series aside does get...tedious lol.

Overall I would rate give this season five stars however I was a bit disappointed with the last three discs only having three episodes a piece, making the viewing time quite a bit less than usual box set.
Anyway despite its being largely a filler arc, it was very enjoyable and worth adding to you DB and DBZ collection.",1318032000,,1256,4.598214285714286
3537465,5,B001DRF842,Dragon Ball Z Season 7 is the coolest animated series I ever seen!

3537467,3,B001DRF842,"The Dragon Ball Z Season Seven box set includes six DVDs that contain twenty-five episodes.  The first two discs contain six episodes, the third disc contains four episodes, the fourth and fifth discs contain three episodes, and the sixth disc contains three episodes and the DVD extras.  The episodes on this set include the tournament in the Other World, Gohan attending high school, and the start of the tournament with Mr. Satan.

One of the best features of the Dragon Ball Z sets is the marathon feature; this allows you to watch all of the episodes back-to-back.  However, with the marathon feature, you only see the opening credits once, and the ending credits are not shown.  This feature is very helpful when you're trying to watch all of the episodes on a disc in a single sitting.

For the special features, this set includes the textless opening and closing.  However, this feature now has the new opening and closing that were introduced during the episodes that appear in this set.  And on these textless songs, the credit text is gone, but there are still subtitles that appear on the screen.  Also in the extras menu is a link for trailers.  The trailers included on this set are for: Tsubasa, Hana, Case Closed, Dragon Ball GT, Love and Honor, xxxHOLIC, Black Cat, and Dragon Ball Z.

Like the previous box sets, I have issues with the audio mastering levels.  FUNimation's splash screen at the beginning of the discs, the trailer at the start of the disc, and the menu are mastered at a high audio level.  However, the actual episodes themselves were mastered at a very soft audio level.

While I was disappointed with the audio levels and the lack of special features, this set is still a ""must get"" for any Dragon Ball Z fan that wants all the episodes on DVD.

In order to write this review, I checked out a copy of this DVD box set through the King County Library System.",1288051200,,1894,4.62874251497006

There are two new additions to the DBZ gang in the hilarious tag team of Trunks and Goten and now that Cell is gone Mr. Satan hogs all the glory of being the greatest hero and saving the world.

This point of the DBZ series has possitives and negatives. The parts I like are the expansion of the Otherworld universe showing us that King Kai is not the only omnipitant being in the world beyond. In fact there are more powerful Kais that have even bigger roles to play in this story. Explaning the world of Dragon Ball Z outside of fighting is great to see because this show has a lot more to offer than just amazing fights. This season brings back the old comedic charm of Dragon Ball. The only negative I see is just the story once again grinds to a hault and it just moves so slow. So what do you do you bring back the World Martial Arts Tournament. Unfortunatly when the fighting is only for fun it just makes you crave another villian. Still, the interesting part is there is a villian among the heroes the question is who could it be?",1258588800,3,1192,4.274336283185841
3537472,5,B001DRF842,"I've been a diehard ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" fan ever since I was six years old and I love this DVD box set! Continuing from where Season Six(The Cell Games Saga) left off, Goku is still in the Other World and is training, then fights in an afterlife tournament there; meanwhile, the other good guys, after a while where Gohan is The Great Saiyaman, decide to fight in the World Tournament. Eventually, towards the very end of the World Tournament Saga, two henchmen, Spopovitch and Yamu, the henchmen of Babidi, yet another one of my favorite villains from the series, that's in the next boxset, go to the tournament, fight against Videl, Hercule's daughter, and steal energy from her, and then fly off to Babidi's Spaceship, prompting the Z-Fighters to fly off after them, leading up to the next boxset. There are a lot of new characters in this saga, such as Pikkon, Aqua, Frog, Onion, and many other fighters in both the afterlife tournament and the World Tournament, and Videl, Hercule's daughter. You get all of the episodes from Season Seven(the Great Saiyaman and World Tournament Sagas combined), such as when Goku fights in the afterlife tournament, when the other good guys fight in the World Tournament, and when Spopovitch and Yamu steal some of the energy to revive Majin Buu and fly off to Babidi's Spaceship and the good guys fly off after them. The only things I miss from this boxset are that there's no scene selection feature and that the American music Bruce Faulconer made isn't there, but the show is still amazing! I love this boxset and I can't wait to get this and the rest of the ""DragonBall Z"", ""DragonBall GT"", and ""DragonBall"" boxsets that I don't have yet!",1247616000,,1712,4.767676767676767

You get to watch Gohan growing up and going to school for most of it, which I found funny and enjoyable....but when the World Saga tournament hits, it kind of goes downhill and ends up with basically ""buy Season 8"" because it tells you nothing of what's going on if you don't. Overall it's not terrible, but it lacks a villain to get into(it lacks action overall), and is easily the shortest length of all the DVD season sets by Funimation because of this.

Quirky fun, and most likely, you're going to need this set for your collection, otherwise this is one I'd say most people can skip if they are just into the epic battles and struggle for survival.",1240704000,,870,4.331288343558282

But you still get alot of the usual stuff thats in the other seasons jokes fun moments etc. In conclusion not the best season but still a must if you like me want the entire series on dvd box-set.",1236643200,,485,4.225806451612903
3537479,4,B001DRF842,"First of all I must start of by saying I'm from germany and I love Dragonball Z
This Season is nice even though I think, they could have put the Other World Tournament in Season Six.
What I like about this Season so far is that you get to see how everybody has changed.
Gohan grew up but if you look closely you'll see he just looks like the young Gohan that beat Cell. His little brother Goten is so cute and acts just like Goku did in the Dragonball Series. Trunks is also cool, because he reminds me of Vegeta, arrogant and pride in a funny way.
But I don't like the Great Saiyaman and the moves Gohan does, are ridiculous. He acts just like the Ginyu Force. Why???
So this Season is worth its money and if you're a fan of Dragonball Z, you're bound to have this at home.",1235606400,,774,4.098684210526316
3537480,3,B001DRF842,"This season was alright too good. I like the fact that Goku and King Kai show us different parts of Other World and showing us that old dead characters can still return for an appearance like Cell, King Cold, Frieza and the Ginyu Force.
I know the fight down in hell is short but it rocked especially when Pikkon comes in and takes down Cell,King Cold and Frieza in a matter of seconds.

When Goku meets the other North Galaxy fighters in King Kai's division it would have been great to add Goku's father, Bardock(if he comes from the North Galaxy), it would seem right because Vegeta knew his father in his early childhood days and why can't Goku. After seeing the `Bardock: The Father Of Goku' on DVD, Goku & Bardock have certain characteristics which make them almost alike. When Freiza first saw Goku it reminded him so much of Bardock but when Freiza asks `I was involved in a skirmish with a Saiyan who looks just like you. You're his offspring aren't you?' and Goku replies uninterested `I don't care'.
The match between Olibu and Pikkon was intense and I was just watching with my mouth open with amazement.

Getting back to the land of the living, I suppose I haven't got a big problem with Gohan's Great Saiyaman outfit, it is just his whole weird, dorky poses and things that he says when he is Great Saiyaman which I find annoying. Also in episodes `Rescue Videl' you can notice a character who looks like the Saiyan, Nappa in it. In the episode `I'll Fight Too!' two characters on the film set who look like Commander Red and Officer Black from the Red Ribbon Army.

There are a few boring episodes like `Gohan Goes Too Highschool' & `Gohan's First Date' but I'm sure they're there for character development or something. I wonder if Gohan's flying teaching works?

I think the series needs someone like Hercule to add his loud, goofball behaviour to the screen and the Cell Games video they showed was funny and embarrassing for the Z fighters. Goten and Trunks' fight was great and when I first watched the match between Spopovitch and Videl it made me cringe at the sight of Spopovitch's torture on Videl. Also they should of brought back Captain Ginyu because at the tournament Gohan's bends down and picks up the namek frog. Captain Ginyu should of changed bodies with one the the fighters and entered the tournament. Also this tournament I would have liked to see to the very end, without the Z fighters flying off and Hercule coming up with the Battle Royale.

In the booklet, why is Hercule and Pikkon in the Enemies page, they're the good guys. They should of put Yamu and Spopovich,Cell,Frieza,King Cold & the Ginyu Force. Also I think most people have noticed that Piccolo is on the front cover. I would have put Gohan as Great Saiyaman or even the picture on the front of the booklet would do. Poor Gohan, he saves the world from Cell and Bojack and still gets nothing.

This is a relatively good season even though it contains only 25 episodes, which is understandable considering if they added the Bababi saga as well leaving only 22 episodes for the Majin buu saga. I actually rate this season a 3.5 stars.",1234137600,,3134,4.577540106951871

A girl named Videl takes interest in Gohan and eventually convinces him to join the world tournament as a participant. Things get interesting when a new threat appears.

The ability to run the episodes back to back as a 'marathon' series that cuts out the intro vids / credits between each episode is a great way to enjoy this series.

I would highly recommend this to anyone who is a fan of this great anime series.",1229904000,,404,4.315789473684211

3537491,5,B001DRF842,"This series was one of my most favorite series as it has the in-between time showing how regular life went on for the Z fighters. It wasn't all doom and gloom and after 6 previous seasons they could afford to do it. In some ways they revealed how they get and use their abilities,the true philosophy of much of the martial arts. I highly recommend it.",1228521600,,351,4.333333333333333
3537492,5,B001DRF842,"Like stated before, this season is essential to find out how season six and eight link. why they had to make a whole season instead of just a couple episodes is beyond me, but anyway. Also, I would imagine they put one character on each box cover and it was Piccolo's turn. I would prefer to just rent this set, its entertaining but not anything i will watch again.",1227139200,,365,4.304347826086956
3537493,4,B001DRF842,"I have to admit that I'm a bit biased towards the ""Dragon Ball Z"" anime series.  I loved the series when it was first release in Japan and still passionate about it today.

The fact that FUNimation Entertainment releases these season box sets with plenty of episodes (25 in this box set) for under $30 is just awesome!  Could you imagine that just several years ago, the series was released with only a few episodes per disc (and there are literally a few hundred episodes of DBZ) and were sold for under $20 at one time.  So, the fact that you can watch all these episodes with digitally remastered video and revised audio is just great!

As for this box set, personally I enjoyed the Great Saiyaman arc.  We watched little Gohan grow up and now he is a teenager and although he doesn't know it yet, he has met someone he cares about and willing to help her no matter what.  The chemistry between Gohan and Bedil is just awesome and episodes just focusing on these two were just great.

Also, episodes featuring Goten and Trunks and seeing these two go against each other in the Junior Division of the World Tournament was fun to watch.

And of course, to see how everyone has changed.  Especially Krillin who is now married to Android 18 and both have a daughter.  Heck, Krillin now has hair!

But once you get to the third arc, you know that we are now heading towards the explosive final ""Dragon Ball Z"" villain arc of the coming of Majin Buu and with that being said, similar to the fifth season box set, season seven may leave people feeling cheated because there are only 25 episodes instead of the 30+ episodes.

In fact, discs 4-6 only contain three episodes each.  Disappointing but at the same time, I understand why FUNimation had to do it, and that is to make sure that a TV season focuses on certain arcs.  This season box set focuses on the Great Saiyaman but also the Underworld Martial Arts Tournament and the World Martial Arts Tournament.

It's easy to get spoiled since the first few seasons and even the last season, fans have been treated with more than 30 episodes.  But still, considering how much these episodes were sold at one point and the fact is, you still get 25 episodes at under $30, that's still a great deal.

Also, if you are buying Season 7 of the the series, more than likely you have committed yourself in buying every season of ""Dragon Ball Z"".

All in all, another fun and enjoyable season of ""Dragon Ball Z"".  Check it out!",1227052800,9,2465,4.459821428571429
3537494,5,B001DRF842,"This isn't supposed to be released until next week as of my writing this but i stumbled across a copy that must have shipped early and made it to the shelves at my local walmart earlier tonight. I was one of the guys who grew into their adolescence watching this show and it filled the void that pokemon left when it became considered to juvenile after sixth grade.

This season contains the following 25 episodes:

195 Warriors of the Dead- Goku meets Grand Kai and runs into Cell & Frieza Again
196 Tournament Begins- Goku enters another world tournament
197 Water Fight- Other World Tournament plays out, quarter finals
198 Final Round- Other world tournament heats up, final round begins
200 Goku vs. Pikkon- Other world tournament ends, will Goku or Pikkon win
201 Gohan Goes to High School- 7 years after cell, Teen Gohan goes to high school
202 I Am Saiyaman- Gohan becomes a super hero
203 Gohan's First Date- Gohan is blackmailed into a date
204 Rescue Videl- Gohan must...rescue videl
205 Blackmail- Gohan is blackmailed into world tournament by Videl
206 I'll Fight Too!- Other Z fighters want in on world tournament
207 The Newest Super Saiyan- Trunks and Goten have secrets, Videl meets Chi-Chi
208 Take Flight, Videl- Gohan teaches Videl and Goten to fly
209 Gather for the Tournament- Everyone meets at the tournament, some old friends finally reunite
210 Camera Shy- Everyone is at tournament, prelims begin

212 Trunks .vs. Goten- World tournament juniors continue
213 Best of the Boys- Who will win Goten or Trunks?
214 Big Trouble, Little Trunks- Trunks fights Mr. Satan/Hercule, Goku is confronted by mystery men
215 Who Will Fight Who?- The important fighting order is decided, and manipulated
216 Forfeit of Piccolo- Everyone is stunned when Piccolo forfeits, what could be his reason?
217 A Dark and Secret Power- Videl fights a man stronger than expected
218 Videl is Crushed- Her opponent prolongs the match totorture Videl
219 Identities Revealed- Gohan takes the ring but blows his disguise
220 Energy Drain- Two mystery men have a surprise for Gohan which will lead us towards the Babadi, Majin Buu saga.

These episodes are mostly considered filler that lead into the final major villain of Dragon Ball Z and all the Majin Buu saga's. I however enjoy seeing Gohan just be Gohan for a bit before getting back into the action and the first few episodes are Goku entering a tournament in the after life which are at the least entertaining if not a repeat of what we've already seen. I remember liking how they take Videl's character from someone i didn't like at all and made her likeable as episodes went on with the interaction between she and Gohan, it reminds me of Dragon Ball's earlier episodes and Chi-Chi being reintroduced towards the end.

I personally enjoy these episodes but by far my favorite season will always be the cell games saga, maybe because of the time of my life they aired (i was the same age Gohan is at) or the subject's they covered and area's they ventured, they will always be my favorite and the sixth season set was the best out of all of them as far as the episodes go. it may be that after that season I began feeling too old for DBZ but I liked where that saga left off on a high point and in a good place.

However, I find the whole series enjoyable and these episodes are no different, actually I'm finding myself enjoying them now almost more than when they originally aired because the aniticipation that used to stay with me during episodes to see where they were going and when and what the next battle would be is gone now and i can actually pay attention to the slower parts focusing on other areas besides the fighting.

The box and set itself is the same as always with the booklet and obviously the controversial cropped image. The cropping doesn't bother me much and never has and after buying all the sets so far in I don't see a reason to buy them again without the cropping because for me it won't make that big a difference. I hope for some of you that it does matter that someday they release these in original format but they are more than good enough for me. Some shots you notice the cropping but admtittedly it does make others more cinematic or enhanced.

I always appreciate the preview of the next saga's on the last disc and hopefully the next season will come out as quickly as this one did so we can finish up this series and I can relive all my childhood memories before I get too old.",1225756800,20,4543,4.6081582200247215
