6819668,5,B00PR2IC8I,"This DVD Offers 3 wonderful daily practices, each a little more challenging. The flowers in the garden set the mood for the series of yoga movements Jane describes so clearly. This practice is both FUN and RELAXING. My Mom and I did the level 1 chair practice and had a great mother-daughter time together. Enjoy :)",1420416000,23,315,4.642857142857143
6819669,5,B00PR2IC8I,This Yoga CD is the perfect one for seniors who are wanting to start yoga but a little hesitant about being able to handle the poses.  Jane introduces each pose in a way that is easy to follow and equally easy to do.  They strength and flexibility that comes from doing this type of yoga is amazing.  I started with these poses at 65 and have moved up to a little more strengthening under the gentle yoga over the past couple of years.  I recommend it to everyone and have given this CD as a gift to friends.,1418342400,158,508,4.153061224489796
6819670,5,B00PR2IC8I,Perfect Yoga for me.  I am 70 and have been doing Jane's workouts for 4 years and never tire of them.  She is very thorough in addressing every part of your body for a well rounded practice.  The setting of this new DVD is beautiful and the soft background music really completes this enjoyable practice.  I like doing a different workout every day and when I add this to my older DVD by Jane I have a nice variety.  Watch for the funny cat that appears near the end of the first practice-I think he sensed the peace and calm Jane exudes.,1418083200,139,538,4.235294117647059

6819672,5,B00PR2IC8I,"This was very helpful. It's basic, but I feel so much better after. Afterwards, if I feel like it, I have weights to follow
or stretching bands. So it's helpful by itself or along with other exercises.",1530489600,,201,4.45945945945946

6819675,5,B00PR2IC8I,"I love how smoothing it is while doing the exercises. I can feel the difference in my muscles after the first week of using it. I look forward to moving on to the standing exercises, but know that the sitting ones are doing my body a lot of good.",1530316800,,246,4.040816326530612
6819676,5,B00PR2IC8I,Definitely would recommend.  Good way to regain flexibility  and balance.,1529971200,,73,6.2
6819677,5,B00PR2IC8I,"For as long as I can remember, I HATED YOGA because I don't have the patience to hold poses, to stand there, it's so slow; I am always on the run, errands, walking, etc...but when I finally tried this one, I could not believe that I actually liked it. I don't know why but maybe it's because it's not the conventional yoga, you don't need to do different poses and just stay on them...this is very different yoga for me. I LOVE IT!",1529798400,,431,4.204819277108434

6819681,5,B00PR2IC8I,"At first I thought that this DVD might be too easy. However after working out with this for a few days I have found that it is perfect for my strength and endurance level. I find it very difficult to get up and down off the floor so I really appreciate the use of a chair to do the exercises. The chair also helps with my balance issues. The instuctions are easy to follow and the instructor knowledgeable. I think that this DVD will help me build strength, balance and mobility.",1527552000,,479,4.274725274725275

6819684,5,B00PR2IC8I,I love this DVD - this is the second yoga DVD that I have from Jane Adams - her routines are really great! Most yoga is so difficult that you just want to give up but these can be adjusted to your level. Highly recommend!!,1527206400,,222,3.9555555555555557

6819688,5,B00PR2IC8I,I am 71 and my husband is 75.  We have been using this dvd to exercise 4 times per week for the last month and a half.  It has greatly increased our flexibility and balance.  I have needed to wear shoes with orthotics for many years.  Now I can wear sandals everyday and even go barefoot once in awhile.  I highly recommend this dvd.,1527120000,,333,4.140625

6819690,5,B00PR2IC8I,"As a senior citizen i really enjoy this DVD because it loosens you up in all the right places.  I even have my husband doing it with me since he is unable to do too much exercise.  It doesn't take that long and helps  keep you limber.  Would highly recommend  it to seniors who are finding it difficult to move like they would like to.

A satisified customer.",1527033600,,359,4.205882352941177
6819691,5,B00PR2IC8I,I bought this dvd because even though I am not a senior yet I have been pretty sedentary and overweight. I wanted to ease back into an exercise program that would help strengthen and provide movement. This is gentle and technically easy so I will probably progress to the next one quickly. But I'm thinking I will pass it on to my mother who is in her 70's when I am finished because I think it will really benefit her. It's a very basic program for people who just need to keep up basic strength.,1527033600,,497,4.242105263157895
6819692,5,B00PR2IC8I,"This is a wonderful DVD - I'm on the first section so far, seated yoga and it's easy and effective.  This was a very good buy, I highly recommend.  I'm a toga beginner.",1526860800,,168,4.0606060606060606

6819695,5,B00PR2IC8I,"I like the 3 sessions.  Some days I don't feel like doing a long session.  This DVD is very similar to what I have been doing at the gym.
I am 80 years old and need the exercise as provided, not weight lifting or exercise machines.  Thank you",1526774400,,242,4.0
6819696,5,B00PR2IC8I,"I am very happy with this DVD even though it wasn't exactly what I thought it would be.  It turns out that I needed this program to improve my range of motion and balance.  It's very gentle and easy to follow.  There are no distracting music or background scenery.  All of the movements are explained slowly and thoroughly.  I'd recommend this if you need a gentle movements, but it's not a hard core yoga dvd.",1526515200,,410,4.413333333333333
6819697,4,B00PR2IC8I,"Just awesome..I will be 52 this month and love how you distributeed the time taken in each level, even though one or two of the leg movements were suppose to be right and not left or the other way round...but overall just perfect and i enjoyed it very much!..thanks Jane!.",1526515200,,272,4.46
6819698,3,B00PR2IC8I,"not as good as the balance and strength one I got at first, the seated portion is longer on this one but a much easier workout than the Balance and Strength for seniors DVD. I have not tried the other two routines yet. Still working on getting stronger muscles to balance on",1526169600,,274,4.288461538461538
6819699,5,B00PR2IC8I,"I'm 62 and loving it. Chemo-induced Neuropathy and arthritis has destroyed my balance. After falling twice, I knew I had to do something and I'm glad this was my choice.  I can easily see the improvement and my flexibility is better Thanks Jane Adams!",1525651200,,251,4.704545454545454
6819700,5,B00PR2IC8I,This exercise session is very doable for older people who have lost flexibility.  You don't realize it at the time but you really are using and stretching muscles.  It is a good program to do.,1525305600,,192,4.457142857142857
6819701,5,B00PR2IC8I,I enjoy this DVD very much.  It makes me move muscles that really needed it.

6819707,5,B00PR2IC8I,"I regularly attend different chair yoga classes with experienced and skilled instructors in addition to standard yoga 2 and meditation classes. Currently, I am residing in a group home with cancer victims and their caregivers. A volunteer comes in once each week to do a chair yoga class. The participants truly enjoy the class but wanted more so we decided to preview tapes. This DVD completely meets our needs and closely resembles the chair yoga classes I am accustomed to. One of the best features is the 3 different levels allowing for various degrees of fitness/energy abilities.",1524960000,,585,5.041237113402062

6819718,5,B00PR2IC8I,"kudos.  i am most pleased with the dvd's, use this at least five days a week.  i give it a top rating.  i have bought multiple copies and given them to friends.  it came with the strongest recommendation from a friend and i give the same strong recommendation to friends and famiy.  i think it is well put together, goes at a good pace, mixes things up in an orderly manner, and works on things i need but relegate to the future.  i am 74 and still active.  the emphasis on functionality, maintaining and increasing: flexibility, range of motion, essential strength, balance are things that one should be working on at any age.
i was in a serious auto accident and the physical and cognitive therapy got me only so far.  this was the piece needed.  i am back

My husband and I are both in our mid forties, but I'm out of shape, and my husband is a disabled vet and really inflexible.  I bought a different beginner DVD and it about killed us. So I found this DVD and thought it might be a good place to start. I couldn't be happier. This DVD was perfect for us and even my husband can do it. The only thing I would change is at the end during the relaxation section, she talks through it, but besides that it's great. So glad I bought it.",1517875200,4,564,3.9911504424778763

I did some poking around the internet and found out about gentle yoga and chair yoga. I was going to make her a playlist when I found this DVD with glowing reviews.

We have arthritis problems & back problems that prevent us from doing exercise that is too wearing on our bodies.  This seems to be one of the answers we need.  We got this as a Christmas gift to ourselves & we've tried only Level one & two.  It does stretch us & will help with our stability.

6819771,5,B00PR2IC8I,"A new favorite yoga DVD for me.  I've almost completed my 230 hour yoga certification but my focus is more therapeutic or modified yoga approaches.  I have been taking chair yoga classes with my elderly mother for years and am always impressed that even though it is in the ""chair"" I still feel like it is a good workout.  The chair doesn't make it easier necessarily, it just changes your focus and makes other muscles work harder.

My personal practice focuses on Somayoga, a combination of somatics and hatha yoga.  I find this DVD actually has elements of that built in or that I can easily somatize myself.  It works on foot, ankles and hands, as well as a lot on balance.  BTW, balance work is core work for those who want to work on that.  I like that there are 3 levels and progressively longer workouts so I can pick the one I want to do based on my available time.  When I do these, I just make sure to focus on my edges and not go beyond my current range of motion, while also keeping my core activation in mind.  I move slower than she says sometimes but doing the same movement mindfully.  It is a great addition to guide my at home practice on days I don't want to guide myself.  It is a safe yoga DVD as long as you know how to focus on your own body signals about your edge of stretch or pain (don't go into a full stretch, only to the edge).",1512691200,14,1358,4.180769230769231

Jane is very gentle, her voice is soothing and she explains the poses as you do them, with NO pressure to do them perfectly. The music is soft, in the background where it should be.

Even though I did yoga for years, I saw changes in my body as a senior and became uncertain which yoga movements might now constitute injury. By working with each of Jane's three programs (as my schedule allowed)  I re-gained noticeable strength, flexibility and balance in certain areas.  This helped me determine any deeper physical issues. Now I wish to retain this precious level of health and energy and am confident to explore Jane's other DVDs.

Mom is a southern bell. ""Ladies don't sweat."" Never exercised a day in her life. Visited her today for first time since she started the program. It's only been a couple of weeks. She did not use her cane once! Her balance has already improved!! She can't do anything on the floor yet but manages some things on her bed.

I have been trying to get Mom to do yoga with me for 30 years. What opened her mind her was a recent news piece about a woman in a wheelchair with kyphosis who, after starting yoga, walked again. Saying it was yoga for seniors sold her.

His only previous experience with yoga was at our senior center where he did not like the teacher or the class, so I ordered this DVD in desperation. He loves this instructor and has stayed with her program. After a few weeks of doing the most basic level which s all seated, he moved on to the next which has standing portions. So far, so good!

The sessions are about 40 minutes so you don't have to spend a couple hours to get through it all.  I do find the positions challenging for me but not so much that I can't do them at all.  With knee and foot mobility problems, I can't do a full squat or fold up onto my knees or kneel on the floor anymore.  This video doesn't have any of that.  The introduction says that the video is for people over 70, but I'd say it's useful for anyone with some arthritis or issues like I mentioned above.",1469491200,11,665,4.15625

Best of all, it has loosened up my hips and my left I-T band as well as my lower back (all of which have been giving me problems for years!).

6820032,5,B00PR2IC8I,"Let me start off by saying this DVD is excellent and has so much to offer. The target audience is Seniors but middle aged people and people with some limitations and/or beginners will also benefit and enjoy this DVD. The setting is outside in a beautiful garden in Kalispell, Montana. Jane does the routines alone outside on a sunny day in front of a stunning border of flowers with every color you can imagine that starts at the lawn level and runs to about 6 feet high. The camera is usually set showing her doing the moves from head to foot with only a few closeups when necessary so it is much easier to follow along. She instructs by voice-over and the instructions are clear and easy to hear as the music is lightly playing in the background. You will mirror her meaning she will tell you to move your left foot and she will move her right so you can more easily follow along.

There are three separate routines listed in the main menu which I will briefly outline below:

1. Level 1 - Chair Yoga (26 Minutes)
This is the least challenging of the three routines. It is all done sitting in a chair, no yoga mat is required. At a steady pace you will complete gentle twists, leg lifts, arm circles, wrist circles, ankle rotations, neck stretches and much more. Easy to follow and you won't even know that a lot of the moves are yoga modifications. The session ends with a short relaxation. You never stand or even get up from your chair for Level 1. (Look for the cat wandering into the routine).

2. Level 2 - Chair & Standing By Chair (40 Minutes)
This routine is a little more challenging than Level 1 and in it you will do exercises sitting in a chair but you also will do exercises standing behind the chair and on each side of the chair. When standing the chair is to steady you. If you did Level 1 prior to this one you will notice it builds upon what you did in Level 1 and introduces the standing balancing poses. It is completely new video footage from Level 1. Again, Jane does not get into using yoga language but those familiar with yoga will recognize the modifications of the usual yoga poses such as modified down dog and forward bends using the chair.

3. Level 3 - Stronger Chair & Standing (55 Minutes)
This is the longest and most challenging of the 3 routines on this DVD. This time you benefit from a yoga mat in addition to a chair, and possibly a second chair for added stability. All the routines are done either sitting in a chair or standing. There is less reliance placed on using the chair for stability than in Level 2 but it is completely at your option. Level 3 is all new video footage and does not recycle from the previous Levels 1 and 2 but you will feel familiar with some of the exercises. Level 3 can be further broken down into sections as follows;

3a. Standing Warm-ups (6 Minutes)
Bends, stretches, and more demonstrated without the chair.

3b. Seated Core & Foot Warm-ups (6 Minutes)
All sitting in a chair. Includes gentle twists, stretches, ankle openers, and more.

3c. Standing Balances (13 Minutes)
Lots of standing balances using chair as needed

3d. Seated Upper Body (6 Minutes)
All sitting in a chair. Includes fingers, arms (eagle arms) and more.

3e. Standing Poses (16 Minutes)
Those with yoga experience will recognize modified Sun Salutation ( Warrior 1, Down Dog, Plank, Forward Bend all modified with the chair) and Triangle and Warrior 2. Those without prior yoga will learn and follow by Jane's expert instructions.

3f. Seated Finishing Poses (8 Minutes)
All done in the chair. Easy spinal twists, stretches and more. Ends with a short relaxation.

In summary, I find this to be a very good DVD with expert instruction. It is truly a bargain as you get 3 classes totaling over 2 hours of instruction. The outside location is an added bonus. I can see myself using this DVD many times and am glad I purchased it.",1446595200,21,3878,4.478753541076487

6820034,5,B00PR2IC8I,I thought it might be a little too easy for me since I am fairly active.  But by the time I finished the beginners work out I knew I had moved muscles that I don't move a lot.

6820040,5,B00PR2IC8I,"Found this DVD in my search for yoga poses I can do to ease back into yoga after 35 years.  I am currently under the care of a spine specialist and a physical therapist.  They did not recommend yoga, but many of the ""exercises"" they are recommending are actually yoga poses.  In this DVD, smiling, encouraging Jane Adams offers quite a bit to choose from.  No floor poses!  I like that it offers 3 sections.  On most days, I work with section #2, where I am able to do 99% of the poses.  At this stage of my life (I'm 69), I am very concerned about balance, and this DVD helps in that regard.  I recently retired from a desk job, and, as you can imagine, I spent too much of my day sitting.
I also have Jane's DVD:&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/Gentle-Yoga-7-Beginning-Yoga-Practices-for-Mid-life-40-s-70-s-including-AM-Energy-PM-Relaxation-Improving-Balance-Relief-from-Desk-Work-Core-Strength-and-more/dp/B00PRABXFO/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">Gentle Yoga: 7 Beginning Yoga Practices for Mid-life (40's - 70's) including AM Energy, PM Relaxation, Improving Balance, Relief from Desk Work, Core Strength, and more.</a>&nbsp;This one is a bit more challenging, however, I DO enjoy it, also.

She was recuperating from major back surgery, and I wanted something gentle yet effective to supplement her sessions with the Physical Therapist.  At first she was fearful that this strange thing called yoga would damage her back, but to her surprise and relief Level 1 was filled with the same exercises that her therapist had her doing.

In Level 1 everything is done while sitting.  There are leg lifts and stretches, arm strengthening, neck and shoulder stretches, posture training.  All the exercises were perfect for her current abilities.  Being an avid gardener she was also delighted with the flowers and water feature that was the backdrop for the video. (She has added a visit to Bibler Gardens to her Bucket List!)  The cat wandering into the scene also gave her a chuckle.

We looked briefly at Level 2 & 3, but they are well beyond her current abilities.  But Mom is getting a little stronger every day, and I hope to ease her into Level 2 in a few weeks.

The sleep and conscious relaxation have lowered my blood quiet a few points. Will continue to follow these lessons and be a much happier (and balanced ) senior!!  Lol.",1424217600,15,556,4.53
6820091,3,B00PR2IC8I,I thought I was in the public room of a nursing home doing yoga when I watched this video. It's a little timid and basic. I was hoping for some exercises that used a chair for balance but still promoted stretching. This was more hand waving and not really the yoga I wanted.,1424217600,9,274,4.188679245283019

6820095,5,B00PR2IC8I,"If you're looking for a way to improve your fitness or that of a parent or grandparent, I can't think of a better place to start.  I've no experience with the shorter, completely seated workout on this DVD.  Last year, I purchased the first edition which has one work out very similar to the middle one here on the second edition.  The third workout is more difficult--we plan to work our way through this eventually, but for my 85 year old mother it was a little too much so we went back to the more modest middle workout.

Key differences between the first and second edition's middle workout:  The sound is set louder on the first edition. If you're using headphones that aren't always loud enough, the first edition could be better.  The second edition shows multiple camera angles, so you can better see what you're meant to do.  Ms Adams has modified this workout a little bit.  In the end it's four minutes longer.  You might think 36-40 minutes is a long time and worry it'll become tedious, like I did.  After doing it for a few months, my mother still looks forward to it every day and it still surprises us both how quickly it goes by.

My mother's posture, back pain, balance and endurance have improved.  Between them, my parents have had years of professional physical therapy (both in-home and at rehab facility) and I've never seen a significant improvement like this.  Unfortunately, we had a bit of a set-back last month where her knee was hurt (considerable pain for a few weeks but nothing fractured, broken or torn).  Now we're quickly getting back to where she'd been--I credit this workout (which she still wanted to do despite the pain) for the speedy recovery, perhaps preventing a worse injury.

The middle workout is the perfect gentle, yet serious nudge toward better health and fitness my mom needed.  You or yours won't do every exercise with effortless perfection.  It might take weeks to work through the whole workout, as it did for us.  And if this becomes too little of a challenge, the third workout (which we've only tried once, not quite making it halfway) looks fantastic too.

I thought so highly of the first edition that buying the second edition for Seniors, then another Jane Adams DVD for me was a no-brainer.  Nothing is for everyone, but I'll bet this comes closer to disproving that than anything else.  The value is far greater than anything I've bought in this millennium.",1423008000,167,2422,4.678486997635934
6820096,5,B00PR2IC8I,This DVD features exercises done in a chair as well as standing.  Both ways provide great range-of-motion exercises and have increased my flexibility as well as my strength.  By taking the time to do these exercises I feel so much better.  When traveling one can do  these  Yoga programs in a motel room or when visiting someone without having to lay on the floor. I take a portable DVD player with me.  gf42,1423008000,,408,4.52054794520548
