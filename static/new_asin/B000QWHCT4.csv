8197865,5,B000QWHCT4,"Leonardo Favio (a hard Peron fan) the well reminded and legendary author-singer devoted a good part of his kaleidoscopic talent around one of his greatest passions: To make movies.

And this film is his glorious masterpiece. Supported by a dynamic script, he makes an admirable description about the ascent, consecration and fall of Gatica el mono a humble boxer who achieved the status of legend due his notable charisma, physical conditions (he made several fights into the brief interval of fifteen days) respect his multiple scandalous love affairs. Favio remarks admirably the profound relationship with Peron (who was the Godfather of his son). As a matter of fact, one of the most admirable sequences of the film is when Peron goes to congratulate Gatica after a brutal fight won by el mono and Gatica says Peron: ""Look how the lion mess roars. Two potencies greet themselves.""

Once he reached the top, its well known addiction begin to affect slow and progressively his condition as well his irascible character, becoming his happy marriage into a true hell.

The creation of the existential atmosphere in which Gatica grow up during his youthful years, the sordid ambiance, the violence and dreams he had by then are narrated with admirable pulse and good taste.

This film from 1993, still remains in my memory when a total cycle of Favio (I watched all of them) was exhibited at the National Cinemateque by then.  The film deserved for his protagonist , Edgardo Nieva a cult reference because the very actor made himself a facial surgeon with the only purpose to seem like the famed boxer and deserved him several prizes as Best Actor for his mesmerizing performance.

The best Latin American film of the Nineties and one of the supreme Argentine filmic jewels ever made by sure.",1264636800,,1791,4.9335548172757475
