8418758,5,B0048M1906,"I didn't know more than the basics of how to find a pitch and sing from my diaphragm - meaning I'd only been instructed a couple of times and still didn't really know anything. I was seeking something to tide me over until I could afford professional lessons and I purchased several books and CD's but this one is the only one that delivered what it claimed. The others were not enough for me or they were mostly the teacher advertising to take their lessons. With this couple, they teach from a beginner level on up to a more advanced level, and help you not only learn for someone at day 1 like me, but I haven't gotten to disc 3 yet (I dared to try it a couple of times but it was a strain) and I feel confident for musical theater auditions now (which is what I was aiming for). I have a lot of learning to do (such as sight reading, etc.) but it's done what I wanted. It won't replace real lessons obviously, but this is a great price and the best thing that I've found for learning by yourself.

The only downside is that when they are teaching you pitch, they repeat between the notes. So they will play a note, then say 3 instructions, then it repeats. The instructions get annoying because I need to focus on the sound and when they talk, it disrupts that focus and I have to re-internalize the pitch to sing the note. They do that in all the lessons - but it's not annoying because the demonstrations last longer than a note- they are usually scales with the instructions after about 4 minutes. The instructions are informative at the start of the lesson, but they just repeat between all of them. I recommend doing it on your computer not a DVD because on the DVD I was not able fast forward during the instructions - only skip from lesson to lesson. With the computer, I know the lessons now so I just skip to the exercises where you sing along. Hope that helps. :)",1365465600,2,1877,4.272471910112359
8418759,5,B0048M1906,"Hello, I purchased this DVD today and would like to make the first comment. It comes with three DVDs and I like the format and quality so far. I have seen many DVDs and books on singing throughout the years and have taken voice lessons for about two years. I feel this is a great DVD...I am a novice singer but it teaches alot about technique of singing - things I have heard before. The graphics are great, the quality of video is great and the lighting is wonderful. It is an upbeat DVD that is not as dry as the other DVDs that I have reviewed in the past. I am only 15 minutes into the DVD. However, there are three DVDs total...I will make another review after I am done reviewing the other two.",1295049600,2,700,4.154411764705882
