7873738,5,6304534280,"The main reason I bought this was because it was based on one of my favorite books, Shui Hu Zhuan (a.k.a. All Men are Brothers, or Outlaws of the Marsh). Video game fans may notice that this is the book that the Suikoden series of RPG's is loosely based on. I was very satisfied with this movie, and would recommend it to anyone who is a fan of martial arts films or classic Chinese Literature. If you're a fan of the game, it's fun to draw parallels between the characters -- Lin Chung is the Tenyu star, a role which is filled by Kasim in Suikoden 1, and Hauser in Suikoden 2. These characters are all very bound by duty, and always follow orders. Lu chi Sum is the Tenko star, which in Suikoden 1 and 2 is the well known character of Viktor. I thought that would be interesting to any fans of the game. Regardless of that, it's a nicely done movie, and definitely worth owning",1063670400,,879,4.238095238095238
7873739,4,6304534280,"All men are brothers is the story of Lin Chun, a nave but honorable general, and his friendship with Monk, Lu Chi Sum.
When Lin Chun inadvertently humiliates a nobles' young son, the cowardly youth plots revenge. He frames Lin Chun in a plot to assassinate a high-ranking official, and in the ensuing scandal has him humiliated, branded and left for dead. Only the clever monk Lu Chi Sum can save him. Can Lin Chun restore his honor?
All men are brothers is a classic HK action movie, with several truly endearing characters and a memorable friendship between Chun and Sum. Some plots and scenes in this movie are quite hilarious, especially at the beginning. However, the movie darkens quite a bit towards the end, and became slowly, more progressively violent.
Overall, I loved this movie, and found it quite entertaining! My only disappointment was the seemingly abrupt ending, and the rather badly misspelled English subtitles.
If you like humorous, campy HK action films, don't miss this one. It's over-the-top Kung Fu at its best!",1032048000,2,1036,4.925714285714286
7873740,4,6304534280,"All men are brothers boils down to loyalty and morals which make up our character.  Oh yeah, with plenty of kung-fu.  There is an actual story and plenty of kung-fu.  Oh, did I mention that I just love Tony Leung Ka Fai?  If you liked him in Dragon Inn (5 star movie with Brigett Lin) you will like him in this flick also.  Although this is not a good as Dragon Inn it's still very enjoyable and worth checking out.",1012262400,,415,4.1375
