1214474,3,B00000FZJ4,"The episodes in this DVD set are from the DIC era of the Care Bears not the Nelvana era that did the movies and both versions of the animated series.
Some of the episodes WERE released on video a long time ago by a company around 1985 to 87. They came out the same time as the Nelvana episodes were released in larger numbers.
The episodes include:
Drab City, The Old Man & The Lighthouse, Birthday, Lucky Charm, Night the Stars Went Out, Cloud Worm and Magic Shop.
The DIC series featured low quality animation which was common for DIC, however they are the only ones that feature Loyal Heart Dog in a speaking role. If you want to buy the DVD then do so. If it sells enough we might get the better Nelvana episodes that feature No-Heart, Brightheart and others that the DIC episodes ignored.",1050883200,23,793,4.401360544217687
7908741,3,B00000FZJ4,"I love love LOVE Carebears! I've slowly been collecting all the stuff on DVD that I can find and while it's not quite as much fun as when I was a kid it still gives me a nice feeling of nostalgia to watch and remember what it was like when I was little. Plus, it's new stuff for your little ones to discover and something you can share together!",1371600000,,345,4.0144927536231885
7908742,4,B00000FZJ4,"Care Bears was on the television when I was a little girl. *sigh* Such fond memories! Just to let you know this is made by DIC. They are know to have bad production shows and movies. The color and quality of the DVD isn't that good. The voices are just weird! It doesn't sound ""cartoony"" if you ask me. Still good none the less.",1158451200,3,328,4.140625
7908743,5,B00000FZJ4,"These original episodes from the TV series are pretty much the same as I remembered them (I was a teen when they came out): juvenile, predictable, and badly animated (think Thundercats - The Old Man and the Lighthouse on this disc is actually even more poorly animated than the others). I bought this disc and The Last Laugh for my son when he was about 3 and he loved it. He would watch them over and over glued to the television, so they were a perfect baby sitter when necessary. His favorite episode on this disc was the Cloud Worm. Compared with the 3-episode discs that his grandma bought him (Tenderheart Tales & Land of Enchantment), the 7-episode discs are definitely a better value and overlap significantly (only one episode was different on the 3-episode DVDs). Compared with the original Care Bears movie, the animation is a little choppy. However, these original TV episodes were much better and got watched a lot more (the movie is pretty scary).",1130457600,,961,4.726190476190476
7908744,3,B00000FZJ4,"I was quite disappointed with this video. I didn't like the way it was produced. The ""kids"" in all episodes had weird grown-up voices, and a few of the Care Bears sounded very strange and annoying (like Bedtime Bear, Grumpy Bear, even Champ Bear. And oh, let's not forget Gentle Heart Lamb's shee-ee-ee-py voice!). Also, most scenes could have been improved with more and better background music.

We bought this video along with the 3 others from the Animation Station series, which are: ""The Last Laugh,"" ""Care Bears To The Rescue,"" and ""Daydreams."" Between the 4 of them, there is a total of 22 episodes. These episodes are also featured in the 3-episode DVDs produced by Sterling:

(In random order)

1. Forever Friends

2. Celebration

3. Dreamland

4. Land of Enchantment

5. Fun in the Sun

6. Starry Skies

7. Tenderheart Tales

DIC also came up with a DVD 3-pack which covers 20 of these episodes.

Instead of spending extra money on all 7 DVDs or the 3-pack set, we decided to get the VHS version...it was a lot cheaper (got all 4 videos brand new on ebay for only $12 plus shipping), and we still get to watch all 22 episodes produced by DIC/Sterling/UAV. The video quality seems okay...it's certainly sufficient for occasional viewings by a 4-year-old. My daughter doesn't seem to mind the awful voices (although she'd sometimes comment on how ""weird"" someone sounds).

As one would expect, yes, there are moral lessons on caring, sharing, being nice, etc... and the bad guys are tolerable enough... Overall, this is still a cute 80's cartoon series for all ages.",1130025600,,1575,4.792592592592593
7908745,4,B00000FZJ4,"I was a fan of the care bears ""way back when"" so it was interesting for me to watch this video with my 7 year old. He didn't seem very interested and I can understand why. The voices of the characters don't sound like I remember and in the case of a couple of the bears, slightly scary. I think this would be more for the pre-school set than school age children.",1110240000,2,362,4.041666666666667
7908746,3,B00000FZJ4,"Watching this really takes me back!  The origional theme song! There is no beastly, noheart, or shrieky here, but the the bears are there.
 Drab city is one of my favorites.",1083542400,,173,4.548387096774194
7908747,1,B00000FZJ4,"As a giant fan of the Carebears, I had bought the original 2 Carebears movies, as well as some of the VHS tapes that come with the stuffed animals not too long ago.
Seeing this dvd in the store, I was thrilled to find another Carebear movie and of course bought it right away, along with the Last Laugh dvd.
They were both a horrible disappointment to me though, and if I could I would have taken them back and gotten my money back! It didn't match up at all to the original Carebears movies and show, and several of the voices were quite awful! Nothing at all compared to the originals!
Original Carebears fans will not like this dvd at all.
My advice.... do not waste your money on any of the 3 dvd's in this set!",1072569600,9,715,4.188405797101449
7908748,5,B00000FZJ4,"I remember I used to watch the Care Bears when I was a very tiny tot.  Seeing these old episodes of the Care Bears series by DIC definitely brought back some fond memories of my childhood.  Each episode features a different type of story, but they all revolve around the importance of caring and helping others.  Youngsters who have never seen the old series would enjoy this treat.  And, parents, it will be a first opportunity to share something from your past to your children!",1071446400,2,480,4.6117647058823525
7908749,5,B00000FZJ4,These are the Best Epsodes Put out by DIC Drab City is one of my favorites on the disc. This collection of epsodes really do teach you and your kids about sharing and caring. You'll laugh cheer and quite possibly cry during the movie. These epsodes are what made the Care Bears grand Definatly a must buy for people who are collectors and new fans alike. Myself being a collector seeing all these epsodes many times know what to expect this is a great DVD. And it is also very hard to find in stores so you've come to the right place.,1053388800,7,534,4.245098039215686
