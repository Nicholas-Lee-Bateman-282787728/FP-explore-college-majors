2684795,1,B000K7VL06,"The battle of the Kokoda trail was one of the more imporant battles in the countries history. Australian troops fougth against an invading Japanese Army in New Guinea and eventually defeated it as as an all Australian military operation. It was the second defeant of Japanese forces after another Australian operation at Milne Bay.

The battle took place over some months and for most of the time Australian troops were heavily outnumbered fighting against a well trained and fanatical enemy.

The action of this film seems to take place after the battle of Mission Ridge when the defending Australian Marouba force was overrun and forced to retreat through the jungle.

The problem with the film is that it is basically gloomy and shows a rather defeated Australian patrol retreating in dreadful conditions. The cast keeps on talking about only being "" choclat soldiers "" ( derogatory term for militia ) and waiting for the AIF to turn up.

The reality is that whilst the conditions these battles were fought in were dreadful the Australian troops performed well. At the initial battles of Kokoda 1 and 2 400 Australian troops were by their aggressive counter attacks were able to delay an invading force of 2,500 Japanese. The Japanese commander in fact thought that Australia had some 6,000 troops in the field they were so effective.

In the defensive battles around Isurava around 1,000 troops kept 5,000 Japanese troops at Bay. The effect of the various defensive battles was that the Japanese ran out of supplies and eventually by the time they reached the end of the trail most of their army was starving and wracked with Typhoid. This prevented further offensive operations and the Japanese were forced into a catostrophic retreat.

The reality is that the Australian troops were skilled and self confident not like the scared winners portrayed in this film. It is a shame that something which should be a proud episode in Australian history is portrayed as a grim disaster.",1168214400,6,1983,4.957831325301205
2684796,5,B000K7VL06,"A true representation of Aussie courage and friendship.  Unlike the usual over the top heroism of American war films, Kokoda shows the real story of how young Australians faced fear, poverty, starvation and extreme conditions to protect Australia's northern borders from the Japanese during World War II. This is a story that makes you feel proud to be Australian, as well as appreciate the lessons learnt from the past.",1166313600,2,420,5.086956521739131
2684797,2,B000K7VL06,"Its the story of Australian reserve troops that defeated a major Japanese assault to take New Guinea. This they did while out numbered, out fought by better troops, with very little in equipment and fighting in some of the worst terrain in the world. In fighting they managed to hold the Japanese long enough for the Japanese supply line to collapse so the Japanese had to retreat so saving New Guinea from Japanese control. Its the sort of stuff that legends are made off.

Overall I found the acting was poor. The story stilted. The action scenes quite good.",1162857600,2,560,4.656565656565657

Dysentery, malaria were present in the film, as well as hunger, thirst, brutality, fear, and rage.  It appears to be filmed on location.  I find no fault with Kokoda, and it is a subject not known in the US, and therefore welcome to myself as a historian.  It is worth a view.",1372032000,,391,4.328767123287672
2684820,4,B000K7VL06,"This is a good, solid war movie, which sticks I believe quite succesfully to the reality of jungle war as Australians waged it in 1942 in New Guinea. Below, you will some more of my impressions, with some limited SPOILERS.

The Kokoda trail is a 60 miles long foot path which crosses the Owen Stanley Range on New Guinea island. In 1942 it was the only track which connected Port Moresby on the southern side of the island with the Oro province, on the northern side, beyond the mountains. After failing in their direct attack against Port Moresby the Japanese high command decided to seize this strategically crucial port by an infantry attack coming from Buna on the northern coast of the island through the Kokoda trail. Obviously, Australian high command decided to contest this attack with all the (very limited) forces it was possible to muster.

This film tells the story of a small Australian infantry platoon forced to make a fighting retreat from approximately the middle of Kokoda trail to the village of Isurava, which is near the southern end of the track. It is inspired by real events, both on the strategical and tactical levels - Isurava village really existed and at one moment it became indeed a rallying point to all scattered Australian troops retreating from the north through Kokoda trail.

This is a very brutal and tough film, in which the real fighting plays a rather secondary role - it is the jungle with all its attractions (heat, humidity, mud, insects and other vermin) which is for most of the time the real oponent of Australian soldiers. The war is nevertheless very present and even the smallest wound received in the most insignificant skirmish can become deadly, as the jungle jumps on every weakness and tries to choke out the life of any wounded, sick or exhausted man...

The scenario is quite solid, actors (all completely unknown to me) did very well and this film can be considered as rather succesful. I must say that I missed a little bit some action scenes - there is very little fighting in this film indeed - but on another hand it makes this movie quite realistic. War is after all made mostly of a lot of walking, resupplying, digging and waiting, all interrupted on rare occasions by short but intense episodes of extreme violence...

Weapons, uniforms and equipments are also quite realistically shown - as is the unbelievable brutality of Japanese soldiers.

I was quite impressed by one of the final scenes, which includes a lot of wounded Australian soldiers (no more details will be provided) and shows a REAL episode - it is a surprisingly low key scene, but once I actually understood fully what was happening, well, I had tears in my eyes... The quite, stoic beauty of this heroic final act is definitely one of the best war scenes I ever saw in a movie...

Bottom line, I liked this film and I will keep the DVD for a future reviewing. Not a great masterpiece, but a very honest, solid, well thought and well done thing. I can not really say that I enjoyed it (it is pretty nightmarish), but I am glad that I saw it.",1366156800,,3076,4.65377532228361
2684821,1,B000K7VL06,"I was bitterly disappointed in this film. Most of the one and two star reviews have said the most important things.
As an Australian, I thought the whole theme deserved much better treatment. The Kokoda Track has become a symbol and an icon in Australian mythology; it symbolises courage and determination against the most overshelming odds.

But two major things were missing. The first was the sense that they were part of a much larger force. A consequence of this omission was another glaring fault: the lack of any real sense of mateship, togetherness and good humour. There were bits of it, but the overwhelming impression was that of a disjointed rabble fighting for no more than their survival.

What the movie did do was portray some of the real horrors of war. But it missed out totally on the redeeming aspects (in the sense of making the best out of a horrible situation) such as humour, mateship and cameraderie.

This movie is yet another example of how Australian movie makers think they can simply tap into Australian symbols  (eg the landscape, Ned Kelly, Phar Lap, etc) and make a winner, simply by the conjuring up of that name or symbol.

After such disjointedness, horror and negativity, William McInnes' speech about the soldiers' heroism seemed absurdly out of place.

In an episode of Faulty Towers, the American tourist (Mr Anderson) said to Faulty ""...you are the British Tourist Board's answer to Donald Duck!""

In like manner, I would suggest that this movie is the Australian Movie Industry's answer to Jane Campion.",1327363200,,1545,4.896551724137931
2684822,4,B000K7VL06,"Almost all of the reviews I read about Kokoda were negative.  To me, this was a pretty good flick.  As a 30 year veteran soldier, I could relate quite well to what the ""Diggers"" were dealing with.  It was a nasty war in New Guinea, and the film displays the hardship the Aussies went through in detail.  There is no revisionist history in this film.  It showed the Japanese for what they were, cruel and sadistic.  As an American, it filled me in on what occurred in New Guinea before US GIs arrived.  Not sure what the other reviewers were looking for.  This movie told the story of the defenders of KOkoda and did so quite effectively.  Warning, This movie is not for the faint of heart.",1325203200,,689,4.362204724409449
2684823,4,B000K7VL06,"This isn't a great movie; it may not even be a technically good movie, but it is a movie about real heroes and what they did on the Kokoda Track to save an entire nation.

Rarely, do men have the chance to change the course of history; to ensure the survival, not only of their culture but the very existance of their country. Well, the 18 year old conscripts of the 39th Australian Infantry Battalion not only had that chance, they rose like Spartans out of the mud of that track and triumphed.

Historians, with the aid of hindsight. dispute if the Japs would have invaded Australia even had Port Morseby fell, but historians are always wise after the fact and fight wars from the safety of their homes.

The 39th Battalion, though ill trained and poorly equipped didn't have that luxury. Watching this movie makes me proud to be Australian and so proud of these men who preserved my way of life.

By the way. As these men fought to save us, General MacArthur and General Blamey were accusing them of cowardice! Shame on them. I hope they are both in hell!",1271808000,,1058,4.466321243523316
2684824,5,B000K7VL06,"Incredibly the most neg reviews have been from Australians. On this ANZAC eve I've watched this for about the 6th time and love it. Perhaps it is the shame of Australia sending part timers to do a full timer's job that endures with these interweb enjoying couch potatoes. I only stumbled apon these sad reviews when checking the price to send my ex-Marine buddy in TX a copy...and freak me, there's someone in TX who likes it better than the so called Aussies!

2684825,2,B000K7VL06,"Having an interest in Australian history, as well as teaching the subject to middle school students, the battle(s) on the Kokoda trail in Papua New Guinea between Australian forces and the invading Japanese, is a WW2 event that causes a sparkle to shine forth from the eyes of the students.

Out numbered and out gunned, these Australian soldiers fought bravely under the worst of tropical conditions: rain, mud, jungle, malaria, and extreme heat. What makes this event memorable was the courage of a few men fighting against impossible odds and holding their position against a fierce adversary.

Although slowing the Japanese invasion, in the end it was the harsh environmental conditions and a lack of supplies that prevented the invasions success. The 6000 Japanese soldiers, for the most part, died of starvation and disease. War is never a handsome affair, and the Australian film Kokoda depicts the conditions and extreme hardships with poignant reality...other than that, however, the film was a big disappointment.

The impression is the director focused on portraying, as realistically as possible, the dire conditions of war. He accomplished this aim without question. However, Kokoda has no `plot' per say, there is no actual story in this film other than focusing on a small contingent of soldiers in retreat, their deaths and suffering, and the courage these men had in order to carry on despite the apparent uselessness of it all.

As many people have commented after seeing this film, it begins compellingly, but we continue to watch expecting `something' to happen, a flashback of home from one of the soldiers, a character development or relationship explored to ensure we feel the pathos when one dies in battle; at least a `story' amongst the harsh conditions of war because there is only so much shooting and killing and audience can take.

Kokoda is like an expensive documentary with great actors, well made, with no story other than the brief contextual explanation from a voice over at the beginning and a paragraph of information at the end. In fact, the film did not teach the audience anything about this important historical event in Australian history; guessing that the director expected `us' to know enough to feel the harshness of war and how close the invading force came to success.

To be fair, this film is a good visual of history to convey what these courageous boy's experienced defending the country. My impression is that the director had tunnel vision, making the film to a small ""Australian informed audience"", because any audience overseas would wonder what the film was all about.

In the end, my students gained a better visceral understanding of a part of history they should be proud of, that war is a reality and nothing to be glorified because war is pure hell. And their grandfathers and great grandfathers' fought bravely to defend our country against a ferocious enemy.

A 2.5 rating at best.",1179273600,14,2946,5.022540983606557
2684826,2,B000K7VL06,"I have avoided this review for some time but couldn't hold back any longer. I saw this film not long after it came out on DVD. It pains me to have to call this film out for what it is, largely flawed and missing the mark; particularly in a tradition of Australian cinema that has so often delivered incredibly powerful and poignant war epics which tell the history of our diggers ... Breaker Morant and Gallipoli but two among them.

I found myself cringing as the film dragged on, it had a great deal of potential but became a complete cop out focusing only on a group of fear gripped Militia. I think that the entire trajectory of the film is a slap in the face to those that served during that time. If you read your history and do any research on these men you know they were made of stiffer stuff than is portrayed in this film. My reading of Kokoda and this film are at opposite ends of the spectrum for realism! The point is that they were called Chocko soldiers but showed themselves to be anything but!

Another major disappointment was the weak battle scenes - when a final charge by the Japanese comes late in the film during a night time engagement we see possibly only about 13 Japanese come out of the scrub to make an attack and then the camera only shows about 4.5 secs of the battle instead focusing on an Aussie soldiers face as he deals with an off screen enemy we are supposed to now imagine! Waste of yet another cinematic opportunity.

I am proud of Australian Military history and felt this movie did nothing to serve it in any way shape or form. An opportunity was missed, when you consider how rare it is that we see films made about the Aussie WW2 period and this is what we get to stand in celluloid as representation one of the greatest and most sacred of Australian wartime engagements?

Fair suck of the sav!",1178755200,8,1838,4.349854227405248
2684827,1,B000K7VL06,"I had great expectations for this film, but I was very disappointed. The story was about nothing more than bunch of blokes wandering aimlessly through the jungle, bumping into and being slaughtered by an almost invisible enemy. More like Rambo meets Predator than a WWII film.

As a viewer I got no perspective of the battle fought along the Kokoda track. In fact, we hardly even saw the track. There was no sense of a huge prolonged struggle. We never got the idea that they were outnumbered because we hardly saw the Japanese. We did see a dozen or so Aussies get killed in minor battles. This movie is ruined by gory Hollywood killing effects and as usual, the coward dies a horrible death, and the bad guys are of course brutal murdering swines.

I rate this film right down there with Gallipoli. If you want to see a good WWII film then see To End All Wars or The Great Raid.

Its a shame really, I'm sure the story of the Kokoda track deserves a lot better than this.",1172102400,5,973,4.394444444444445
8155044,1,B000K7VL06,"This is a disgrace to the memory of the battle of the Kokoda Trail, and the Australians who died and suffered there.

The incredible valour shown by Australian soldiers against what should have been overwhelming odds is just ignored.

The book - ""Kokoda"" by Peter Fitzsimmons tells it all, keeping the reader (in this case me) spellbound between incredulous admiration, and tears of grief and frustration

How they dare title the film ""Kokoda"" is beyond me, as it is not about Kokoda, and there is little in it that would make anyone think it was.

In fact, I would say the producers use the word ""Kokoda"" to get people to see what is a very disappointing and uninspiring story of what in actual fact is an heroic Australian battle lasting months.  The incompetence of the Australian Military leadership in Canberra is, of course, not mentioned  The Diggers on The Trail had more enemies than the Japanese and the terrain, they also had the ignorance of Blamey and MacArthur dogging their every footstep.

I can only think that the reviewers who have praised this film have not read the book, or any history of the Kokoda battle. .",1451174400,,1131,4.710659898477157

8155048,4,B000K7VL06,"This film looks at the experiences of Australian militia men on the Kokoda Track in 1942. These militia men of the 39th Battalion were young, mostly conscripted and insufficiently trained. Yet when the Japanese advanced over the Owen Stanley Ranges they were the only troops in a position to oppose them. Despite their difficulties, the men of the 39th did a remarkable job in extreme conditions.

The film follows the survivors of a section that is cut off by Japanese attack. They are forced into very thick jungle and struggle to regain contact with the main Australian force. The extreme danger they are in is very graphically portrayed. The Japanese troops are shown to be very brutal, as indeed they were. They did not spare prisoners and engaged in torture. The jungle adds to the tension with its disorientating shadows and thick foliage. There are also the incredibly steep mountains of the ranges, heavy rain and mud. It is exhausting country and the Australians struggles are interspersed with violent clashes with the enemy. These are quite graphic, so this film is not for the squeamish.
The film makers are to be commended for the realism they have achieved. The soldiers look like they are operating in a steamy, muddy cesspool. Uniforms and equipment are also quite authentic. It is sometimes hard though to follow whispered dialogue and some things are confusing. As the numbers dwindle this was less the case. There is a nod or two to the strange set-up of the Australian army at this time as well. Some of the interpersonal conflict seemed a bit forced but if a time and place was going to put pressure on people  this was it. The actors were mostly sound in these roles.

Kokoda is infamous for the terrible terrain as much as for the ruthless enemy. The mountains sapped strength and the limited visibility in the dark and gloomy jungle meant an enemy could appear right in front of you with no warning. This is very well conveyed, some scenes being quite nerve racking, particularly the creek crossing. Victory on the Kokoda Track required bravery, grim determination and sacrifice. This film shows all of this in a very commendable manner. Highly recommended. 3 3/4 stars",1430006400,,2194,4.8453333333333335
