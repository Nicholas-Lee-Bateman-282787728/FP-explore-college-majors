5371349,3,B009XJVKKS,"I liked this film, but I did not love Abel's Field . One one hand, it was a moving story of a young man who was willing to do whatever it takes to take care of his younger sisters. He was not afraid to work hard, and did his best to provide a safe environment for them and make them feel loved. One scene has a football player committing a criminal offense...in my state anyway. [Goodness knows we are crazy about football too, but the boy needed to be held accountable by the witnesses.] Plus, it bothers me that no one seems overly concerned about how these children are surviving. There is an inconsistency that distracted me. I can go along with some of it, but not the entire thing.

The relationship between Seth and Abel was more convincing. Both were struggling with unimaginable issues for most of us, but each provided something the other needed. Abel had withdrawn into himself and did not want to let anyone in. Many of the touches of humor sprinkled through out the film played on this aspect of his character, and I thought Sorbo showed great reactions to these situations. Seth was overwhelmed by responsibility, mistreated and/or abandoned by those who should have been helping him; He also believed that God didn't care about him. Both of these men learn that family matters, we need others, and that God can be trusted to be there even when we are having to step out on faith.

5371350,5,B009XJVKKS,"I knew when the opening scene of Abel's Field was a high school football game that I would love it!  Football is the only sport I follow and have loved since my high school days. And who doesn't love a good sports movie?

I will admit, I was not expecting a whole lot from this movie considering the fact that I'd never heard of it. I was so pleasantly surprised by the whole plot and the way that it played out.  It was not predictable and it just flowed along at the perfect pace.  I was instantly engrossed in this story and while I have never seen Samuel Davis in anything else, I was so impressed by his talent. You will see a side of Kevin Sorbo he doesn't usually show and I liked seeing him in a serious role.

Faith is something that people struggle with when they lose the people and things that are most important to them.  Seth McArdle struggles with this as he just tries to get through every day. An unexpected ally comes along and Abel has unbreakable faith despite a mysterious troubled past.

Most people can relate to heartache and struggle and movies that are about real life like this have the ability to really touch you deep within and think about your own life and faith. Abel's Field made me laugh and made me cry and left me feel inspired.",1359072000,2,1264,4.30801687763713
5371351,5,B009XJVKKS,"Abel's Field is the kind of movie that we need more of.  It is a movie you can enjoy with your family and not worry about them hearing foul language or seeing inappropriate scenes.  I really enjoyed this film.  It is a great story about hope, forgiveness, and prayer.  The main character, Seth, is carrying the weight of the world as he tries to care for his two young sisters, work hard at his schoolwork and jobs, and put up with bullying.  And he is determined to do it all on his own.  As things slowly crumble around him, Seth learns about asking for help from others and from God, whom he has given up on after his mother died.  Abel, Seth's supervisor, is a key part of helping him, but Abel has a secret of his own that might turn Seth down the wrong path for good.
One thing that did seem a little unrealistic to me was that three children would be allowed to live on their own.  Even if Seth is 18 and refused help from anyone, someone (from church, school, etc.) would most likely step in and do something about that. Other than that, I thought it was a very well done movie full of heart, humor, tears, and even a little romance. Although I think this is a great family move, I did not allow my kids to watch it yet.  My oldest son who is 8 might be able to grasp some of the storyline, but I think this movie is more appropriate for teenagers and older.  If my kids did happen to watch it, I am glad that there is not anything in it that I need to be concerned about.",1358899200,,1480,4.107638888888889
5371352,5,B009XJVKKS,"Let me say this first and foremost: this is a wonderful family movie! I rated this a big 5 stars Folks!!

There are very few movies these days produced without extraneous special FX, portaying real life people with real life challenges. When a producer, director and actors are willing to go forth with a message of faith, in this case, forgiveness, I for one applaud their efforts.
My family and I were very happy to hear of Abel's Field release on the 22 January 2013 and enjoyed a great movie!
Cast with good, clean, faith driven talent, Abel's Field carries a message of hope and forgiveness that you will not soon forget!

Samuel Davis in the role of Seth is mesmerizing as a seventeen years old who single handed raises his younger sisters, goes to school and holds two jobs!
When he is faced with after school work detail following a fight with bullies, he meets the school groundskeeper, a loner named Abel, played by Kevin Sorbo.
Their combined efforts in putting a new sprinkler system in the football field enables each one to learn a valuable lesson from the other whilst ultimately placing their faith in God's hands.
When Seth's home is about to be foreclosed on, he learns to trust and aks for help whilst Abel learns to accept forgiveness.
Heartwarming!

A movie you will not want to miss and your family will love!

5371353,5,B009XJVKKS,"""It's OK to ask for help, that's what we're here for."" Seth (Davis) is a high school student with no parents, two jobs and two little sisters he is trying to raise. Between getting beat up by the football team and trying to keep the bank away from his home he is trying to find his dead beat dad. Convinced he can do it all on his own he refuses help from everyone, but sometimes it is needed. Going in to this movie I was expecting another cheesy, low-budget Christian movie. I was wrong. While it was a little cheesy I really enjoyed this and Seth is so likable that it is hard not to pull for him throughout. While there are some pretty heavy scenes in this this is a very good family movie that teaches a lot of good lessons for families to talk about. For a movie I just put in so I could get the review done I ended up really enjoying this and I surprisingly recommend this. Overall, much much better then expected. I surprisingly give it an A-.",1358812800,,951,4.173913043478261
5371354,5,B009XJVKKS,"Sometimes it's harder to forgive ourselves than it is to seek God's forgiveness. Seth McArdle is about to learn that very lesson in the unlikeliest of places. Seeking to raise his twin younger sisters after the death of his mother and now the abandonment of his father who fails to returns phone calls or even come home to see how his family is managing. While trying to finish up high school, avoid the quarterback of the football team who seems to bully Seth whenever possible, and hold down three jobs just to put enough food on the table. Now when a man appears searching for his father, Seth learns that his father hasn't been paying the mortgage payments on the house and it's now going to be foreclosed upon if the payments are made current.

When those around Seth offer help, he seems too proud to take it or even to ask for it. He is trying to find a way to keep his family together even though it's falling apart all around him. Even his brother, Keith, seems to have abandoned the responsibility of helping out when he can and instead finds solace in drinking. When Seth pushes things a bit too far with the football team, he finds himself the only one facing punishment. The football coach assigns him the task of working with Abel (Kevin Sorbo) the janitor/groundskeeper of the high school to get the sprinkler system up and working before the big game. Abel attempts to find a way to reach inside Seth and help him find the path back to God and to keep him from making some foolish mistakes that may cost him everything in the end.

In the DVD, Abel's Field by Affirm Films, makers of such wonderful family films like Fireproof and Courageous, now bring you another great family film that deals with forgiveness and understanding the circumstances that life can bring about when our choices seems to much to deal with. This is the perfect family movie to watch to show you how easy is can be to ask God for forgiveness and how hard it is for each of us to find forgiveness in ourselves. This one rates a 4 out of 5 stars in my opinion and I received Abel's Field, compliments of Propeller, FlyByPromotions and Affirm Films for my honest review. Once again if you're looking for a wonderful film to watch with your entire family without worrying about the subject matter, than this one is perfect to add to your DVD collection.",1358640000,,2341,4.5058823529411764
5371355,5,B009XJVKKS,"This movie was an endearing story on many aspects. The two main characters, Seth a high school student and Able the quiet groundskeeper at the high school, become friends through unusual circumstances.

Seth shows perseverance and commitment trying to take care of his two younger sisters when his mother dies and his father and brother abandon him. You see a young man who loves his sisters and is willing to do anything to keep his family together even though they lose the house due to debt and he must work 2-3 jobs to make ends meet while attending school.

Able has secrets but the two form a friendship based on hope and eventually forgiveness through believing in Jesus. You can believe through this movie that people enter your life for a reason and you never know how they will impact your life.

I believe this is a movie for older children and adults, rather than younger elementary age children.

It could easily lead to an excellent discussion about faith, God, redemption, etc. It is worth watching more than once.",1358467200,,1029,4.731843575418995
5371356,5,B009XJVKKS,"Need something to do next weekend?  You've got to watch this movie.  I love a good clean movie.  This is it.  It's full of real life drama.  You know what I mean... bullies, mortgages, grocery shopping, secrets, abandonment, family tension, bad friends, you name it.  This high school senior is really facing troubles.  It's also full of responsibility, determination, respect, and sibling love.

After yet another fight with the popular high school quarterback, Seth ends up in a different kind of detention at the command of the football coach.  He's sent to help Abel, the janitor, dig up the football field and fix the sprinkler system.  Big job.  Abel's not a mechanical kind of guy, so it takes awhile, a long while.  Abel's got secrets of his own.  He's a brooding man who doesn't talk much.  As the plot progresses, questions stirred in my mind about why he was so sulky and introverted.

This movie had so many layers.  There were two main characters and both stories were told concurrently.  The depth was refreshing.  Watching each man struggle with himself and his situation, interact with each other and with God, and come to conclusions was good, real good. ~smile~

Ultimately, Christ was honored.  The producer didn't shy away from the name of Jesus.  That's why I consider this a must-see movie.  It's coming out January 22nd.

5371407,5,B009XJVKKS,"What a great drama ""Abel's Field"" is! Released in 2012, the story revolves around 17 year-old Seth (Samuel Davis) whose mother is dead and his father is no where to be found. He's forced to be the parent to his twin 7 year-old sisters. His cold half-brother is following in his father's alcoholic footprints. Seth is bullied at school by the football team and their bossy coach (Richard Dillard), but finds solace with a popular girl at school, Katie (Nicole Elliott), and -- surprisingly -- with the school's loner maintenance man, Abel (Kevin Sorbo).

Like all great dramas, ""Abel's Field"" captivates your attention in the first act and you find yourself in the world of the characters. As the story progresses we discover why Seth is mistreated at school, but it's thankfully not spelled out (it has to do with jealousy, rivalry and sectarianism, the moronic ""Your not one of us"" mindset). You'll notice, incidentally, that the players only confront & attack as a group and never alone. It's a microcosm of the mob mentality, not to mention they're too cowardly to attack one-on-one.

Three relationships are the focus: Seth's fatherly relationship with his sisters and his developing relationships with Katie and the mysterious Abel. Speaking of Abel, Sorbo is excellent here in an atypical role. His likable joie de vivre is completely absent in favor of a quiet, brooding spirit.

The message of the film is A+ all the way and the overt references to God and faith are refreshing, but they're not so overt to turn-off those who don't believe, so don't let this factor deter you if you're amongst the latter. This is simply an inspiring film for everyone, except maybe atheists (or perhaps them most of all, lol).

Those looking for a faith-based film that shows a conventional family environment might want to steer clear (not that there's anything wrong with those types of films; check out the excellent ""Cutback"" for a quality film of that sort). ""Abel's Field"" shows the awful truth of broken & dysfunctional families in the modern Western world and the negative repercussions thereof. Thankfully, that doesn't mean that there isn't any hope; but the proud individualist must be broken, both for Seth and Abel.

I also like the fact that the film shows that the mentors we stumble across in life are there to mentor us in one way or another, but we shouldn't make the mistake of idolizing them, no matter how great (or small) the mentor is, he or she is still a flawed human being who just so happens to be further on in their spiritual journey, at least in the area we need help in.

Another thing I liked: Just because someone's in the ""mentor"" role doesn't mean the ""mentee"" can't mentor the mentor in one way or another. And a worthy (humble) mentor will receive from the mentee when applicable.

One reviewer referred to Nicole Elliott, who plays Seth's potential girlfriend, as ""overweight."" Wow, nothing could be further from the truth; in fact, this isn't even remotely true. Check her out in the film and see for yourself. It's idiotic statements like this that drive women and girls into anorexia and it totally ticks me off! If anything, Nicole could stand to gain some weight. Regardless, she's uniquely beautiful, a refreshing alternative to the stereotypical hot blond cheerleader type.

The film runs 104 minutes and was shot in Thrall, TX, which is about 20 miles NE of Austin.

5371441,5,B009XJVKKS,"I highly recommend this well done, superbly acted movie which champions family values. It is a Christian movie with a message of faith, hope and redemption. Many Christian movies are not professionally done, but are low budget endeavors. This movie isn't like that, but is professional in every way. For me, the most touching part of the movie was the love Seth had for his younger sisters and how much they loved him in return. Enough of Christian movies with the siblings picking on each other. Also his very special girlfriend and how she treats Seth and his sisters was sweet. The fact that the young man did not give up under such trying circumstances, with one nasty blow after another was also very touching. But as one reviewer so rightly commented, ""Even good people need the Savior."" At the end of his own strength, Seth finds him. The part of Abel, who is a mentor to Seth was also very well done. I won't give the plot away, but let you watch the movie for yourself and find out.",1361664000,2,991,4.511111111111111
5371442,5,B009XJVKKS,"I purchased this DVD simply out of a sense of obligation.  If the Body of Christ fails to support faith-based films, every time we go to the megaplex it will be nothing but Naked Girls Part 2 and Blowing Things Up Part 3.

Using my incredible powers of deductive reasoning which are never wrong, I examined the cover and classified this movie as a rehashing of one of those Yoda and Luke Skywalker films.  The angry kid learns important life lessons from a wise groundskeeper or trash collector or whatever.

Boy, was I wrong.

This time, Luke's anger management issues pale in comparison to the baggage Yoda is carrying.  The story is complimented almost perfectly by the location.  The small Texas town setting gives the film a ""Friday Night Lights"" kind of feel.

I won't name names, but I have sat through some truly awful faith-based movies.  But ""Abel's Field"" is one of the best I have seen.",1361664000,22,898,4.632911392405063
5371443,5,B009XJVKKS,"When I asked my gang what they thought of this new film starring Kevin Sorbo and Samuel Davis, they unanimously said, ""It was different from other Christian films.""  And they mean that's a good thing.  Abel's Field was well written, well acted and entertaining to boot.

Among many good messages in this story, I was particularly touched by Seth's dedication to his younger sisters. My kids also pointed this out as one of the things that made Abel's Field stand out.  So often, even in Christian media, brothers and sisters are portrayed as annoyances to each other.  It was a nice change to see an example of what siblings should be to each other.

Allen liked that Abel, the Christian lead in the film, was not a perfect saint.  He was portrayed in a very real way that all of us can relate to.  Just like the average Christian, Abel was struggling to overcome his past and gain victory over the sin in his life while trying to live out God's will, share the Gospel and be a good example to those in his life.
Typically in Christian films we start with someone who is obviously lost and living a life full of sin... alcoholism, adultery, drug addiction, theft, anger... the list goes on and on.  As things get worse the rebel comes to the Lord and he cleans up his act at last.  In stark contrast, Seth is a good kid, working hard to do good things.  His life, even in the absence of parents, is full of great character traits.  But he is still lost and in need of a Savior.  That is a message our world needs to hear.  Even ""good"" people need to know the Lord.",1361577600,55,1564,4.348275862068966

If you're interested in buying/watching this movie because you're a Christian who wants to be edified and encouraged by Christian films, than this movie is quite simply a waste of your time and money.  I have appreciated movies like ""Sheffey,"" ""Facing the Giants,"" ""The Printing,"" etc., and this one doesn't even come close to having the spiritual impact as these great films.  When my brethren asked me what this movie was about, I could hardly answer the question.  It wasn't about Christ, salvation, or sanctification.  I don't really understand what the point of it was at all.  I was disappointed by immodest clothing on teenage girls, flirty advances on a supposedly Christian man that are indulged rather than rebuked, the absolute absence of the gospel, and more.

5371451,5,B009XJVKKS,"""Abel's Field"" is a Truly Amazing Strong Movie, one that offers what all search for so often in life for a Second Chance, it is very rare that I will give a full Five Stars for a movie but this is fully deserved, from the really strong script, great production and two amazing performance from two actors! First the established Kevin Sorbo best known for the roles of Hercules in Hercules: The Legendary Journeys, Captain Dylan Hunt in Andromeda etc, who does not have a lot of words to say but his part is so pivotal to the two main characters and the position their lives have developed into. Second is Samuel David a young actor that I predict a very strong future for who showed his real potential in a movie titled ""New Hope"" released last year, which is well worth checking out for. Samuel's approach to his role in Abel's Field shows the depth of his acting skills, a name to really watch out for.

The producers used the setting of a small town in Texas Thrall and what a first class choice it added so much to this film, no film sets all locations which added to the strength of this movie, one that I fully recommend, the story is strong many of meet difficult times in our lives, we look for a second chance and redemption!

Check out ""Abel's Field"" you will not be disappointed.",1359849600,3,1290,4.393305439330544

5371453,3,B009XJVKKS,"Where to begin?  Kevin Sorbo brought the needed intensity and acting chops to a hurting, brooding character and Samuel Davis was a pleasant surprise as the devoted but stressed big brother.  The script wants to create a bond between these two but it is only the acting that actually achieves it.  The dialog and the plot both strain belief and require a suspension of thought (seriously?  Where is the State?!) and willpower to sit through the predictable and pedantic writing.  There are no surprises in the plot or the characters, no arcs, no development.  And I say that with much thought, knowing what the obvious intent for both characters was.  (If you do miss that point in the movie, check out the ""making of"" extra.)  In short, there was much potential that never really got off the ground.  I really wanted to know these characters, wanted to know how they overcame punishing lives, overcame their major disappointments and the pain that led both into fits of rage. But despite the acting, the script gives us nothing more than cardboard cut-outs and Hallmark card answers.  It really is the acting and the cinematography that convey the main point of the movie and the *intended* character arcs.
The storyline does not allow me to agree that this is a family-friendly movie for elementary students.  Can they see more extreme violence on tv every night?  Sure.  That does not change my mind nor my recommendation.  The themes in this movie are heavy and are not satisfactorily enough worked out to make it children's fare, despite the fairy-tale ending.  There is violence used by and against the main character.  The adults in this boy's life are consumed with their own problems and at best neglect him, at worst target him.  The few minutes of screen time that a pastor gets are not enough to make him a positive adult figure (and don't get me started on the reality that this man knowingly left these 3 children under their own care without more than an offer to help).  The younger sisters are left on their own at times and when they ask him for reassurance, ""Are we going to be okay?"", brother Seth can not give it.  As an adult viewer, these are not a problem; nor is it for older kids. But as a mom, I think these things make unsettling viewing for young children.
Finally, religion does need to be addressed as this flick does bill itself as a film of faith.  This claims to be a Christian movie but faith is at best an undercurrent here.  Those who look for something as open as ""Fireproof"" will be disappointed.  There is no ""gospel-message""; no preaching or evangelizing.  God is mentioned, faith is alluded to, Abel prays and states that he believes in God and in forgiveness.  But the real themes of the film -forgiving oneself, humbling oneself to ask another for help and turning the other cheek - while tied obliquely to the Christian faith, are here bland enough and vague enough (none more so than the name shared by the main character and the title), in my opinion, for all to watch with little risk of either offense or salvation.  Some may even question what kind of faith Abel really has.  He believes in forgiveness but cannot forgive himself.  He prays but only after reducing himself to total weakness, in what seems to be self-punishing weight-lifting.  And while confession is good for the soul, there is no mention anywhere, no hint even, of justice for Abel.  Throughout, Abel is all about Abel, even in the end.  God doesn't really show up, even in the supporting cast.
To sum up, Abel's Field is worth checking out for the acting.  But its claims of family values and faith struck me as a little thin. The movie's heart is in the right place, but you will get more of the film's message from the ""making of"" than from the movie itself.  It never quite rises to the bar that it sets, presents difficult questions then gives glib answers and refuses to delve into the hard issues it raises. Those are problems that no acting can overcome.  Three stars for the acting. Parental guidance recommended for some violence and adult themes.",1359590400,2,4075,4.654545454545454
5371454,4,B009XJVKKS,"Abel's Field is a very neat DVD. It is a story about struggle, loss, love and mentorship. Some real life issues are addressed here and aren't sugar coated, but has humor in the story. Just like real life sometimes humor goes along with tragedy.

Seth is a young man still in high school going through all of the things associated with school, but has the added reasonability of taking care of two very young sisters. Their mother died years ago and the father just left. So Seth does his best, but feels so inadequate.

Abel comes to town and works at the school and Seth has to help him as a punishment for getting into a fight. Even though Seth doesn't have all of the answers, but he has been through hard times and tragedies himself and knows what he needs to do. Abel is an excellent help to Seth, but not until many bad things begin to happen.

I really like Abel's Field for its honesty, humor and the acting is very well. Also Abel's Field was filmed in a very small town under 900 people and you can see the friendliness and caring of a small town coming through in the film.

I recommend you watch this film for a family fun time and a great learning experience.

5371455,2,B009XJVKKS,"I've seen Kevin Sorbo in at least two other movies, and enjoyed each of them a LOT. But, unfortunately, Abel's Field wasn't a movie I grew to like. I kept watching, waiting to grow attached to the characters or the story plot...but couldn't. The idea behind the story was a good one, but sadly it just wasn't done very well--with the story plot, screen writing, and even some of the actors.

Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought that Abel's Field was a Christian film. And while there a few times when Abel is seen in a field in what we assume is prayer, there isn't much praying until the very end when Seth finally prayers for God to fix everything  And, above all that, I just couldn't grasp what kind of town/church/friends would let this young boy try to raise two little girls on his own. I mean, he was only 17! I would have thought the state would be all over this case. And it just didn't seem realistic that Seth could leave the two girls alone for such long lengths of time---he was working 3 jobs at one time!

As for mature themes, there wasn't much that I feel like I need to mention. The romance between Seth and Katie was sweet and cute. Katie's outfits were rather low and revealing in a few shots, but what surprised me the most was the plunging neckline the elderly lady at the convenience store wore. In my opinion, it wasn't at all attractive and something I would have rather not seen. So, be forewarned when those scenes come up---even though they were pretty humorous!

There were just too many aspects of this movie that I didn't understand or enjoy very much. My younger siblings like it, though, and it had good music. :-) As I said before, the idea of the story---a teen boy trying to care for and keep his sisters together no matter what---was really sweet. Seth's dedication to them was really commendable, and there are a few lessons that you can get out of this movie. It just didn't gel with me all the way. But I will be keeping this movie in the family library and, I have little doubt, my sisters will be re watching it sometime in the future.

DVD Review Abel's Field

Left motherless by tragedy and  abandoned by his father, high school senior Seth McArdle (Samuel Davis) faces enormous pressure as he strives to support his younger twin sisters. At school, he endures the daily bullying from members of the football team. At work, he struggles to earn enough money to make ends meet. At home, he has no one to turn to.
When Seth fights back, he's singled out for punishment and assigned to an after-school work detail under the supervision of the reserved groundskeeper, Abel (Soul Surfer's Kevin Sorbo). Seth is surprised to discover that Abel understands his struggles ... and his dreams. Abel encourages Seth to ask out popular Katie and even steps in to babysit so Seth can go out on the date. Yet as dark circumstances lure Seth toward a desperate decision, a reluctant Abel could be the one person who points him back toward the light.

Abel's Field
Kevin Sorbo, Samuel Davis
Sometimes the heroes are on the sidelines.

Rating: PG for thematic elements, brief violence, and a smoking image
How do you know the right way? (Seth)
It's usually the hardest. (Abel)

My Review:

  ""If I've learned one thing, it's you have to be honest when you're talking to God. Otherwise you're just going through the motions."" --Abel ~ Abel's Field

Get the popcorn ready and settle in! This hometown can be changed by one person who decides not ""to treat everyone alike."" For not everyone is alike.
  Put another senior boy in Seth's place. Fix supper, help two little sisters with homework, work two jobs to put that supper on the table, heat the house and keep the lights and water on. Listen to the little sisters ~ keep those pretty little smiles on their faces. Laundry. Senior paper. Grieve for your mother. Long for your father.
  Let's add all the senior boys. For one day. Take turns for the month. What if this was your hometown? Would you see Seth?

Okay. Let's watch the movie. The scenery is wonderful, the townspeople real. You are swept up in this moving story of survival and obedience. Doing what you know to do; doing what you have to do. Seth and Abel are two unlikely friends meeting under unusual circumstances. Both being in the same place at the same time, doing what needs to be done. Mentors ~ for each other. Seth is working so hard at staying together with his little sisters. They are joyful. He is doing a good job. Against all odds, he is staying alert and following through. This movie storyline is deep and could actually be happening. Seventeen years old. Decisions to be made. Choose life.

This movie is very well made. The story is like watching life all day consistently moving. Marveling at Seth in high school, wondering how he gets everything done. A story to share; a story to treasure.

5371457,5,B009XJVKKS,"Abel's Field is a wonderful movie with an important message:That no matter what you've done,God can and will forgive you and will help you learn to forgive yourself. The two main characters,Abel(Kevin Sorbo)and Seth(Samuel Davis)are brought together under unlikely circumstances and end up teaching each other these valuable lessons,but not before Abel's secret and Seth's desperate action threaten to destroy their friendship. The performances by Sorbo and Davis are very good. For Kevin,this is a very different kind of role-he really wasn't able to put anything of himself in it as he has done with other roles because to do so would not have made sense. Abel is a loner who keeps to himself and doesn't say much when he is around people and that is what makes the bond between him & Seth so unusual! I strongly recommend this movie-it could teach you something about yourself!",1359244800,2,880,4.993197278911564
