2267878,5,B00095NXA0,Wow! One of the very best performance bellydance DVDs I've ever seen. I love the diversity. Professional quality from every aspect.,1278806400,,131,5.285714285714286
2267879,5,B00095NXA0,"I really enjoy this performance DVD.  The imagery is fantastic.  My favorites are Blanca as ""The Fool"" and ""The Magician"", performed by Neon and Blanca.  Great buy!",1278288000,,164,5.0
2267880,5,B00095NXA0,Es un video fantstico. Me gust mucho por que describe por medio de movimientos las cartas del Tarot. A mi familia le gust tanto que se quedaron viendolo conmigo(siempre me dejan sola viendo mis videos de Bellydance) Son muchos bailarines diferentes que te harn quedar sentado por casi dos horas de video... y si tienes cartas del tarot a mano veras que bien las logran.,1277596800,,369,4.6923076923076925
2267881,5,B00095NXA0,"The Tarot- Cards-If that alone isn't bewitching and captivating, imagine yourself in a mythical land, where darkness falls and destiny is played out as each dancer superbly depicts the chosen card before you in her artistic vision!
Take your pick! A ""Devil"", ""The Lovers"", ""Magician', these are a few of the 20 selections that symbolically play out the cards. (Each selection has been named in the previous review.) As each card unfolds, the dance interpretation will be richly intertwined with modern fusions that show off so much variation in belly dance. Gorgeous dancers adorned in  beautiful costumes and props depict the theme vividly. Travel into an Egyptian temple, and in a moment's captive breath,face a mischievous devil!
This a collection of performances with such names as Aysche, Anasma, Sara Skinner, Neon, Eliesheva, Blanca, Autumn Ward, and many others. The two hours of enchantment all too quickly dissipate, for each performance is enjoyable, as it is lovely to watch each story unfold. ""The Fool"" and ""Judgement"" are unforgettable presentations as the dancers define their skill in a phenomenal, unexpected style!
 Although the studio backdrop setting is simple, the lighting changes enhance the theme and its motifs so well. A definite gem for my collection!",1271894400,2,1279,5.295566502463054
2267882,5,B00095NXA0,"Using the exotic imagery of the Tarot oracle card deck, with most of the Major Arcana, or ""court"" cards depicted, this DVD is a 2-hour sumptuous feast of dance, using a combination of belly dance, along with ethnic, modern, and interpretive dance, to tell their stories. Some of the biggest names in belly dance are here, to entertain us with their creative art, shimmering costumes, and imaginative choreography. The set is a simple stage backdrop, but uses lighting to great effect, changing the mood of the piece with color and intensity. A must watch for dance lovers of every genre!

The dances are:
1: ""The Fool,"" with the gorgeous and lithe Blanca.
2: ""Magician,"" is a favorite piece, with Blanca playing the shadow of Neon's Magician. These 2 brilliant dancers are always captivating!
3: ""High Priestess,"" has Sarah Johansson Locke and the Alchemy Dance Theater, and reminds one of the dramatic Indian images painted on ancient temple walls.
4: ""Emperor,"" has Toshi Hamada, with Blanca, and has a Japanese Noh Theater feel to it.
5: ""Empress,"" ""Parvati,"" has the delicate, feminine Ayshe in a piece inspired by Indian dance.
6: ""Hierophant,"" Ayshe again with The Cult of Isis, with Egyptian imagery and shimmering ""wings.""
7: ""Lovers,"" ""Venus and Tannhauser,"" with Neon as the exquisite seductress of Angel.
8: ""Lovers,"" is a contemporary version of this card, with Yoshina in high heels doing a tango with Todd Colburn.
9: ""Lust"" (sometimes known as the ""Strength"" card), has Sarah Skinner and the Sisters of Salome in the 1st of 3 pieces with this cast.
10: ""Wheel of Fortune,"" ""Cleopatra,"" has Sarah Skinner with the Sisters of Salome which includes an always fascinating ""tray dance.""
11: ""Wheel of Fortune,"" ""Medusa,"" has Sarah Skinner cleverly coming out of a shroud with snakelike vengeance.
12: ""Hermit,"" the beautiful Tanna Valentine as the Hermit.
13: ""Justice,"" is a big favorite, with Irina Akulenko, who with riveting skill wields her sword.
14: ""Hanged Man,"" is another favorite, with Belly Craft (Alicia and Heather) giving us a smooth duet.
15: ""Death,"" has Fayzah with the Aurea Dancers, Sangeeta and Zaira, in a contemporary and humorous piece.
16: ""Temperance,"" with Andrea Anwar in a sensual and expressive dance with luminescent gown and veil.
17: ""Devil,"" has the scintillating Anasma who is an impish devil until the forceful end. Marvelous!
18: ""Tower,"" has Michelle De Vine and Mahalet, in a terrific sword dance.
19: ""Star,"" has Uyum Dans, Kittarina and Elisheva, is a piece that could be classified as pure modern dance. Simple and lovely.
20: ""Judgement,"" has Autumn Ward in an erotically tinged piece with choreography that shows her incredibly strong back to good measure.",1269648000,7,2710,5.076233183856503
8057505,4,B00095NXA0,"The music and the talent are awesome in this video.  It's a new take on bellydancing, and while all the dances may not appeal, there are some, like ""Justice"" which are just amazing.",1523577600,,181,4.484848484848484
8057506,1,B00095NXA0,"Like another reviewer, I bought this DVD because I saw Irina's ""Justice"" video on Youtube and it was inredible! So I bought the entire DVD because I thought all the other performances would be just as amazing. Turns out, I couldn't even get through half the DVD. Besides Irina, the only ones I liked (that I've seen) were the Isis Tribute (simply amazing!) and the Parvati Tribute (which wasn't even Belly Dance; it was Classical Indian Dance but it was still beautiful). World Dance New York is capable of so much more than these mediocore performances. Don't buy this DVD, really. I wish I had read the reviews before I bought it.",1417737600,,632,4.651785714285714
8057507,5,B00095NXA0,"As promised, Neon and her associates always deliver beautiful performances. She not only teaches you belly dance movements but the way to make your body glide, increasing your feelings of health and wellbeing. Arrived quickly, safely and was well affordable.",1377388800,,258,5.475
8057508,2,B00095NXA0,"I bought this DVD just because I saw a video of Irina Akulenko, who danced to ""Justice"" on YouTube. I expected that all performances on this DVD would be as creative as Irina's was, but I was completely wrong!
Tarot cards can be very inspiring to dance to, but I assume that most of these so called artist didn't want to bother with cards meaning or choreography, as much as they bothered with costuming. The choice of music was very boring, too.
The worst Tarot interpretation was the card called ""Lovers"". There are two parts on this DVD and both of them suck! It suppose to be belly dance, not salsa or jazz!
Don't waste your money, just check the YouTube video of Irina, that's only performance worth watching on this DVD.",1341792000,4,726,4.507575757575758
8057509,2,B00095NXA0,This is the first time I do not like a Neon DVD it is just not worth it. It is several shows based on the tarot cards but it was extremelly boring for me. Don't waste your money like I did.,1314144000,,189,3.6341463414634148
8057510,3,B00095NXA0,"Well, this video was...interesting. Very different which I expected it to be. I felt there wasn't enough belly dance in it. I know it's supposed to be more fusion but I guess I expected more. But the quality was good and there are some good dances in it.",1305849600,,254,4.3125
8057511,3,B00095NXA0,"I liked about half of the pieces in this DVD. Particular favorites are The Magician, The Fool, The Devil, Death, Justice, and Wheel of Fortune. Others I just did not understand -- no bellydance in them, only modern lyrical dance; and/or I could not see how the dance piece related to the card they were trying to represent. My favorite dancers are here -- Blanca, Neon, Sarah Skinner, Autumn Ward, and many other WDNY girls -- but again not every piece was a winner for me. I guess it's a matter of taste, but I feel that the theme could have been done a little more justice. Overall, the visuals were consistently good and some were even stunning. The Cleopatra piece and the Lust piece particularly were visual feasts. The music was kind of hit and miss IMHO, but the sound quality was OK. Overall worth the watching, some pieces several times... others not so much.",1297814400,2,868,4.57051282051282
8057512,2,B00095NXA0,"The ads and synopses for this really make it sound like some kind of slammin' bellydance extravaganza. It is not like that at all. It is a lot of falling leaves and people pretending to throw each other around.

Don't get me wrong. The World Dance New York team is awesome. But I searched my heart and soul for something good to say about this DVD and all I came up with was ""Some of the outfits are pretty."" The dances themselves are very boring and at times they even made me break into laughter.

Also, the sound quality is quite poor.

And as much as the goth dance was cool, the random breaking into Velvet Acid Christ music in the middle of this was just... funny. I mean, if you want comedy, by all means buy the DVD. Other than that... ""Pretty outfits.""",1286496000,2,761,4.270833333333333
8057513,5,B00095NXA0,"As a male fan of bellydancing, I was skeptical about seeing a man partnered with my favorite bellydancer Neon. I don't care what anyone says, bellydancing is an ancient art form exclusive to females and female movement. But the man served a purpose for Neon's ""tale"" and never pretended to be a bellydancer (not that I didn't triple-speed fast-forward his routine). Neon never disappoints; if she's on the DVD, it's worth buying. But giving her a run for her money on this DVD is Irina Akulenko, who also shone on ""Fantasy Bellydance."" There are several other standout performances: two from Blanca (one with Neon) and three from Sarah Skinner. Like all other WorldDanceNewYork performance DVD's, this one's highly recommended.",1281830400,,727,5.117647058823529
