8476593,5,B005K8RJ2O,Get Ready..Get Fit..Get Real..and Deal is not the usual workout routine! It is very effective for the entire body and cardio and is easy to do and easy to follow. Jeanette starts with a great introduction and is there with comments and advice throughout the routine. The warm-ups are great and the stretches at the end help you to come away feeling so good that you don't feel like you just exercised. Feel great! Good for any anyone at any age! I highly recommend this DVD!,1320969600,15,474,4.523255813953488
