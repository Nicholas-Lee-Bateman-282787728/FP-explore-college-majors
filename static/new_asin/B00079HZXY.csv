2206326,5,B00079HZXY,Piper Perabo is perfect for the french role of supposed to be Gebivevve Lapeouff who is actually dead. I watched this yesterday knowing its out in england already. It brillant and funny. It about a girl who wants to be the beeg queen but she needs to let a french exschange student to put put her on top of the rest.

With thanks to her brother and an ex boyfriend she slaps the french and shows her true identity. But whre was the actual real french exchange stident ?,1035072000,5,658,4.357723577235772
2206327,4,B00079HZXY,"I have not been so blessed as some of the other folks reviewing this movie.  I haven't caught any other films by the lead actress.  But I have actually SEEN the movie, not just the trailer.
As for the flick, what with cartoonish characters, plot improbabilities, and obvious reverses, you'd think I'd hate this trifle.  You'd be wrong.
Late summer movies are rarely anything other than entertaining.  This is not a bad thing.  And a chance to see multiple female-on-female fights is brought to hilarious fruition.
Like any good comedy, it is built on a bedrock of tragedy and horror.  Our Heroine is a girl who'll do anything to become a co-host on The Today Show.  Her dippy boyfriend is the quarterback for the school team who seems destined for a coronary at 20.  Her mother is an alcoholic.  Her father is a bitter romantic.  She stabs even her best friends in the back.  Lesbians (or more accurately, women who are perceived as lesbian) are ridiculed.  The little brother is a snide, jaded fellow.
Then comes the transfer student.  Who, like Eve in All About Eve, watches and waits to take over every aspect of Starla's life.  She sucks up the parents, the cheerleading spot, and the dippy boyfriend.  Then all hell breaks loose, slowly at first, then with a vengeance.  And that is what this movie is about: vengeance.
Funny. Yes.  Laugh-out-loud funny?  Absolutely.  Worth your time?  Yes, if you want fairly mindless entertainment.  And especially if you love mock battles feminine.
P.S. Slap Her, She's French is a funny title.  Not cause for a PC war.  This movie doesn't pick on the French any more than the rest of US society.  We think they look down their noses at us.  That makes us believe it's OK to give them grief.  It's not like anyone who views this movie is liable to slap anyone, let alone anyone French.",1030665600,14,1827,4.648902821316614
2206328,5,B00079HZXY,"i saw Slap her.. last nite, and i thought it was so GREAT! i LOVED IT! it was so funny! i couldn't stop laughing!!

Piper did a really AMAZING job in it.. but are we surprised? no, because she's ALWAYS great!

It was really really cool to see her play a bad guy! She should do it more often!

it was one of the funniest movies that i've seen it a long time! and thats really cool!

so, make sure you guys go see it! it was hilarious! you're gonna like it! and tell everyone you know too! :)",1029888000,9,490,3.919191919191919
2206329,5,B00079HZXY,"I can't wait to see this film, Piper Perabo is great and she has never been in the same role twice.  Just look at Lost and Delirious and Coyote Ugly...they are completely different roles that both worked for her.  After seeing the ""Slap Her"" trailer, I am pretty confident that the movie will be really funny and entertaining.  I hope it comes out soon!",1029801600,,353,4.484375
2206330,3,B00079HZXY,"The only actor I recognize from seeing this promising hilarious trailer is Piper Perabo who made an impressive screen presence in my opinion in ""Coyote Ugly"". This time she  plays second fiddle to the main character of the movie who suddenly despises ""Perabo's"" character. ""Slap Her She's French"" is an odd film but I do plan to check it out.",1028592000,,342,4.7
2206337,5,B00079HZXY,I caught this movie on television one day and told myself I had to buy this one! It was hilarious. Piper Perabo's character is perfectly funny in this role!,1427846400,,156,4.413793103448276

I still think the original title (""Slap Her,  She's French"") is a better title.",1412985600,,196,4.764705882352941
2206342,5,B00079HZXY,"If you've watched the series, ""Covert Affairs, then you already know that Piper Perabo is very talented, but if you haven't seen that series, then this movie will surely convince you of her wide acting range. It's a very funny movie, that you might have to watch a few times to hear all of the jokes; because you were laughing from the other jokes that you did hear.",1388793600,,366,4.397058823529412
2206343,4,B00079HZXY,This movie is a cult classic for its raunchy small town humor! I appreciate the typical characters that aren't played so typically. Definitely worth the buy!,1379635200,,157,5.076923076923077
2206344,2,B00079HZXY,"My husband or kids would have never sat through that.  It was truly lackluster.  Maybe if you want to see a 'french introvert' turn into a sexual cheerleader for about 10 seconds, but seriously....it would be better skipping it and doing something better.

2206345,5,B00079HZXY,"I didn't have any preconceived notions about this film, and when I read the description, I passed at first.  but I'm glad I came back to it.  While it is predictable, especially the ending, still there's enough of a story to keep you interested.  And it's funny, to boot.  So, if you want a nice little mindless comedy to watch, I recommend this movie!",1353369600,,352,4.453125
2206346,5,B00079HZXY,"This is easily one of the funniest chick flicks I've ever seen. A blonde girl from Texas, Starla, accepts a French foreign exchange student, Genevieve, into her house. Genevieve first acts like a naive newcomer but soon takes over Starla's life. What I appreciate about the movie is that the humor is original and this movie doesn't feel like a repeat of every other cheerleader movie out there. There were several times when I actually laughed out loud when watching the movie. The actresses who play Starla and Genevieve both do their jobs really well and timed their jokes perfectly. Overall worth watching for a few good laughs.",1307664000,2,632,4.861111111111111

2206348,4,B00079HZXY,"Really, this movie is hilarious.  I read some of the other reviews and... honestly, did you think you were sitting down to watch 'Citizen Kane'?  'Casasblanca'?

It's just a lighthearted teen comedy and on that level, it's awesome.  Plus, it makes fun of Texas AND France in the same movie!  (Two worthy targets, indeed!  FYI, that's called ""satire"" for those reviewers who just don't seem to ""get it"".)

Adjust your expectations properly and enjoy.

2206349,3,B00079HZXY,"It's not the best movie you'll ever see, but it's certainly worth some stupid laughs.",1182902400,,85,4.733333333333333
2206350,1,B00079HZXY,"That was a rhetorical question, of course, but this movie chose to answer in the negative anyway. I was hoping this trite silliness wouldn't make it to DVD, but some filmmakers will push anything. When I first saw the preview for this, I was drawn to it because it looked like an interesting story about the interplay between two rival girls and I'll admit that I'm sometimes still drawn to the drama and trauma of highschool.

While watching the preview, I wasn't sure which girl I was supposed to root for; the blonde was annoying and full of herself, while the redhead seemed rather underhanded and sly. The movie, however, seems to push Starla (the blonde) as heroine, a role which she is simply not cut out to play. As a popular rich blonde cheerleader (anyone see the stereotype there?), Starla is an extremely unlikeable snob with an unbearable Texan accent and a strong streak of proud stupidity which makes her think she's the ideal teen with the perfect life. (And again, she is supposed to be our heroine). Enter Genevieve, French exchange student (and aforementioned redhead) who Starla's family takes in and Starla attempts to take under her over-buffeted wing. Of course, Genevieve isn't what she seems and pretty soon she starts trying to take over Starla's ""life"", aka her cheerleading position, boyfriend, parental spotlight, etc.

Remember when I said Starla's unlikeable? This hasn't changed since the beginning of the story; in fact, once Genevieve enters the picture, Starla becomes more intolerable than ever. Her condescending ""friendship"" is so transparent a blind man could see through it, and even though Genevieve supposedly lost her entire family in France, Starla still insists on flaunting her perfect life in front of her. The last straw for me was when she gave Genevieve a big hug and exclaimed, ""Oh, I'm so glad your family died so you could come here!"" And we're supposed to feel sorry for her when things go downhill? By the time Genevieve started trying to ruin things for Starla, I was practicaly cheering for her! The little bimbo deserved to have her illusion of perfection stripped away. Unfortunately, the movie doesn't stop here.

Genevieve, of course, goes way overboard in her quest to ruin Starla and soon frames her for drug carrying. When Starla was whisked off to prison, I knew the film had lost all reality and dropped all pretenses of trying to be good. For some reason I kept watching anyway, only to see what is possibly the dumbest conclusion I've ever seen in a movie. Suffice it to say that Starla attempts to take back her crown in self-righteous fury and Genevieve the-black-hearted-villain is defeated. As if this silly tripe isn't enough, the filmmakers seemed determined to make us think that Texans are the dumbest and most annoying people on Earth. (If this is some sort of poorly executed anti-Bush statement, I suggest you stop beating the dead horse, people; as a registered Democrat, I can honestly say it's not funny anymore)

The old teens-are-stupid-and-evil stereotype isn't funny either, especially not if you add the dumb-parent one to it. Starla's parents, if possible, are even dumber than she is; when Genevieve announces in public that Starla has been arrested for drug-dealing (which her parents know nothing about), her parents give each other confused looks, frown, than go right back to listening to Genevieve with no other reaction!

Sorry I wasted my time watching this on TV, but at least I didn't waste my money buying it. For those of you who did, you have my sympathy.",1143504000,4,3556,4.9101497504159735
2206351,4,B00079HZXY,"This was under going to be released under the ""Slap Her"" title.

I saw the trailer and lost track of the movie but saw it on cable and this is sly funny movie, as good as Mean Girls.

Piper plays a French exchange student who comes to stay with Starla, a Texan cheerleader beauty queen type. Texas as well as France are in for some parody but it is well done and not really mean spirited at all.

The action as Piper  works way into taking over Starla's life a la Single White Female (minus the CSI style violence) is a scream. The actress who plays Starla is great as well. The movie is comedy but also manages a unsappy message about self awareness while causing you too laugh your butt off.

Melanie Mayron directed. Many of the funniest bits are visual, check Starla's kid brainy kid brother reading Tropic  of Cancer.",1138579200,3,822,4.375
2206352,5,B00079HZXY,"2 Words = 5 Stars

The two words are: Jane McGregor. That's all you need to read, hear, and see. She's charming, vulnerable, and in control.

It's not easy finding an actress that can be beautiful, classy, AND funny. You have to travel back to the golden age of movies to find that - Audrey Hepburn, Judy Garland, etc.

This comedy is light, carefree, and has a powerful theme that all people - teen or not - can appreciate.

2206353,2,B00079HZXY,"She gets what she wants is a flimsy movie that has potential but it never fulfills it. It's not that funny and the characters are so annoying. It plays into Texas stereotypes, which is getting old and lacks in humor. I wanted more, but by the end I knew why it wasn't released in theaters.",1130198400,2,289,4.2727272727272725
2206354,5,B00079HZXY,"I saw this movie a while ago, and immediately went out a bought it.  On the surface, it's a ridiculous movie with completely despicable, stereotypical characters who have predictable paradigm shifts and change their ways.  And okay, that's kinda what it is.  But it's FUNNY!!!

This movies is full of not-so-subtle subtleties, a very tongue-in-cheek kind of humor.  Another post compared it to Drop Dead Gorgeous, and I definitely agree.  It constantly makes fun of itself, which makes the parts of it which could otherwise be offensive hilarious.

The movie plays off of maxims about the French, Texans, jocks, nerds, etc.  Much in the same was as Not Another Teen Movie, but much smarter.  It could be taken offensively, but it is really SO outrageous that it's hilarious instead of hateful.

Some highlights (though you really must watch the movie to understand the context and appreciate the humor):  the Beef Pageant, ""Mmmmmm, A1."", calling ""Genevieve"" ""Jen-of-eve"", ""Oh, I like Dick!"", ""He brought me the mustard!!!!!""...oh, so many more.

A flaw in the movie, for me, was that I never really liked Ed, the sensitive, loner, non-jock guy.  He was cute, sure, but I always kinda felt like he was sleazy and was gonna turn bad or something.  Anyone else feel this way?  Maybe it's just me...

Some people will definitely hate this movie, but overall I loved it.  If you haven't seen it, and enjoy the farcical style of Drop Dead Gorgeous, you will probably enjoy this movie.",1124928000,7,1478,4.895161290322581
2206355,1,B00079HZXY,"Let's see: this movie was made in 2001, has been sitting on a shelf for four years, and was just released on video with no fanfare whatsoever.  Could this be a 4 or 5 star movie as my fellow reviewers are claiming?  Give me a break.  You know, I really regret that I, the Bad Movie Buster, must constantly post on this site.  But what choice do I have, when the shills and hucksters for the movie studios and the movie rental chains keep loading up this site with bogus reviews in order to boost business?  So here I am again, trying to save me fellow movie lovers from making bad choices.  A few years ago, I was in a movie theater and I saw a trailer for a movie called ""Slap Her, She's French.""  The movie never came out, and I assumed it was because of the un-PC title.  Yet, the movie was just released on video under this title of ""She Gets What She Wants"" and it is obvious that the lack of any laughs or an interesting plot are the reasons why this dud never made it to theaters.  All of the characters are completely one dimensional rip-offs of every other character you've seen in every other teen movie comedy: the clueless parents; the younger brother who helps to save the day; stuck up cheerleaders.

8046183,5,B00079HZXY,"Amusing twists and turns- some funny twists and turns. Worth watching more than once for the dialogue; and yes as other people ave noted in some places and on some venues this is titled something like ""Slap Her She's French' but actually one of the things that makes this movie a fun watch is that everyone in the cast gets satirized- regardless of where they're from or what their situation is.  So for those of you who haven't looked into the movie further than the title change- no this isn't a movie about hating the French.  To elaborate anymore would be to give spoilers which no one wants.
