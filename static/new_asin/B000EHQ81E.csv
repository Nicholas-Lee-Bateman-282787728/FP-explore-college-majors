8109787,5,B000EHQ81E,"A very inspiring video.  More than the usual ""stairs and rails"" this video reminded me of what true street-skating was when I was a kid in the 80s.  Keith Hufnagel's section reminded me a bit of the search for Animal Chin, with the ollies over landscaping and a little carve around a bench at the China Banks.  Steve Berra is a pleasure to watch, especially after his surgery.  Daewong Song - just an inspiration.  I believe these guys all ""found"" Animal Chin.

I love to watch this video and then go skate, and try to relearn the stuff that made skating so much fun when I was a kid.",1184803200,,584,4.3119266055045875
