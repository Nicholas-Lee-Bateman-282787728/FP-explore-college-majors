7441742,5,B015J50NNY,"A classic series and comedy that is as fresh today as it was when it was first released. As a man in my mid-20s, I'd much rather prefer these classics to the junk on TV today that I will never watch. Here's hoping for a DVD a release of the rest of the series, or better yet a complete series collection! In the meantime, sit a spell and enjoy the hilarity of season one....

While it may leave fans of the series feeling good that they now have an ""official release"" , the effort would have been more productively spent releasing season five and the remainder of the series.",1457136000,,302,4.769230769230769
7441744,5,B015J50NNY,"I am excited to see first season of Beverly Hillbillies come out in April 2016 and plan to buy it.  I noticed Paramount put out The Legend of the Beverly Hillbillies  a 1993 documentary on CBS.  I saw this on VHS tape and there was a part where Lester Flatt & Earl Scruggs were singing in fancy eating room.  That was on VHS Tape but not on DVD by Paramount.  Was that a part of the May 24, 1993 special? just wondered.  Paramount might want to put this documentary on an individual box set.",1456876800,8,491,4.170212765957447

7441765,5,B015J50NNY,"I'm a big fan of the Beverly Hillbillies. The first season is possibly the best one to pick up because it sets the tone for the series and there's a lot of locations filmed at the Kirkeby Mansion before filming there was cut. Unfortunately, there's a severe lack of bonus features, just some sponsor footage and an extended version of the pilot, but still, it is nice to see the original episodes before they were edited down for syndication.",1493337600,7,442,4.6075949367088604

7441776,5,B015J50NNY,"Like many, I have watched these episodes in their public domain form and enjoyed them. Watching this official set is like watch the season for the first time. Picture is crisp and clear, audio is clean. You will notice things that were not visible before-everything has a great depth to it and the black and white transfer as the look of a fine film.

The episodes themselves are hilarious-with the Clampetts discovering Beverly Hills for the very first time. Sponsor segments are included in the episodes themselves (if you choose that option)-many times these segments are a wrap up storyline to the episode (while Jed and this clan eat Corn Flakes and smoke cigarettes, ha ha.). No musical changes are evident-and the quality of the music is superb. Nice job CBS Video on this season and the rest of your classic tv offerings.",1483574400,4,829,4.7972027972027975

7441778,5,B015J50NNY,"I may have been too young to fully appreciate how hilarious this show was when it originally went on the air in the early '60s. When I was older I saw it in reruns & couldn't stop laughing.  Pretty amazing for what is essentially a one joke show.  Obviously, the cast & the writers were able to make it last much longer than one would think. In some ways this is the best season because every modern device imaginable is fair game for the clueless but very likeable hillbillies.  First few years were in B&W.  This has enough extras to make it even more worthwhile.  Still funny after all these years.",1482192000,3,601,4.378378378378378

7441805,5,B015J50NNY,"Having previously purchased seasons two through four, I maintained the hope that at some point, the Official First Season release would ultimately come out - and to my delight (and the delight of others, I'm sure), it did.  From what I had previously read, in various other reviews, I simply wasn't interested in purchasing previous releases or versions of season one episodes - this release, is re-mastered and looks great, in my opinion.  What more can one add about this show which hasn't already been covered numerous times?  The Beverly Hillbillies represents another of those type shows that stand up to the passage of time quite well -- and, it's another of those shows that I think it's safe to say that 'they simply don't make 'em like this anymore'..  Come and Listen to a story 'bout a man called Jed, should jingle a few memories, about how the Clampett's went from rags to riches.  And, this release includes an extended pilot episode as well.",1466035200,5,956,4.7696969696969695

7441809,5,B015J50NNY,"It has always irritated me that Paramount chose to skip over the classic first season of the Beverly Hillbillies and start with season two when they began releasing the series on dvd.

Most of these episodes have been available for some time now on public domain dvds but many were butchered and looked pretty ragged. MPI released nearly all of the unedited season one episodes (Home For Christmas is missing) spread across two dvd sets. I was tempted to buy these but I decided to hold out for a complete series release. My wait is now over, finally Paramount has released the complete remastered first season of The Beverly Hillbillies.

The first season of The Beverly Hillbillies aired from September 1962 to March 1963. This set has all 36 uncut and remastered episodes spread out over 5 single-sided dual-layered dvds.

The episodes on this set are:

Disc One:
01. The Clampetts Strike Oil
02. Getting Settled
03. Meanwhile, Back at the Cabin
04. The Clampetts Meet Mrs. Drysdale
05. Jed Buys Stock
06. Trick or Treat
07. The Servants

Disc Two:
08. Jethro Goes to School
09. Elly's First Date
10. Pygmalion and Elly
11. Elly Races Jethrine
12. The Great Feud
13. Home for Christmas
14. No Place Like Home
15. Jed Rescues Pearl

Disc Three:
16. Back to Californy
17. Jed's Dilemma
18. Jed Saves Drysdale's Marriage
19. Elly's Animals
20. Jed Throws a Wingding
21. Jed Plays Solomon
22. Duke Steals a Wife

Disc Four:
23. Jed Buys the Freeway
24. Jed Becomes a Banker
25. The Family Tree
26. Jed Cuts the Family Tree
27. Granny's Spring Tonic
28. Jed Pays His Income Tax
29. The Clampetts and the Dodgers

Disc Five:
30. Duke Becomes a Father
31. The Clampetts Entertain
32. The Clampetts in Court
33. The Clampetts Get Psychoanalyzed
34. The Psychiatrist Gets Clampetted
35. Elly Becomes a Secretary
36. Jethro's Friend

Video: The remastering on this set is on par with the remastering jobs done on the second and third season sets. The episodes are presented in their original full frame 1:33 aspect ratio and look great. The show is in black & white and overall looks clean and as sharp as a SD dvd is going to look.

Audio: The only audio track on this set is English Mono. It is clear sounding and I have no complaints

Subtitles: There are English subtitles only.

Extras: This set includes the option to watch the episodes with their original sponsor openings and closings. There is also an option to watch the extended version of 'The Clampetts Strike Oil'.

If you are a fan of this show and don't already own these season one episodes, I highly recommend picking up this set.

I just hope the sales of this season are good enough to persuade Paramount to release season five within the next year and continue to release the rest of the seasons in a timely manner.",1462320000,95,2779,4.621951219512195
7441810,5,B015J50NNY,"Up front, I'd figured the chances of ever getting an official release (not counting the MPI Ultimate Collection sets of course) was not even remotely possible. It has been in the public domain for years, so I never figured on CBS going to the lengths of digitally remastering that season. They surprised us with the announcement a bit back that they were giving us this, the crowning jewel of the series in my opinion.

Count me impressed. I have been watching this since I was born in 1973. Of course then I was watching it on local TV from 16mm prints. It has also been syndicated via tape masters from Viacom, but those have been edited for syndication versions. CBS did a heckuva job on this set to say the least. The clarity of the transfers is outstanding.

I'm watching the series on a 55"" LG LED TV with a Sony DVD player that upscales to 1080 connected via an HDMI cord, and listening on a 5.1 Sony home theater, though I'm only running the two fronts, center, and the powered sub since it's mono; I realize in all actuality it's supposed to be center and sub only, but I like the ""full"" sound from the front speakers being added. The only way you'd get a better picture quality is to have this reissued on blu-ray or stream it in HD most likely.

There is absolutely nothing at all that's distracting; a bit grainy at times, and a couple of episodes that the audio seems a bit muffled or distorted, but that was the same way on the MPI sets audio wise, so I'm assuming that was a problem when originally aired, though likely no one noticed on their 19"" b&w TV! There are some stray specks here and there, and a stray line or two, but again, nothing worrisome or detracting.

I don't want to turn anything into a political debate here, but I was in fear that CBS might remove references to Granny being a confederate or in some way cut scenes that had the rebel flag; those are intact with no disclaimer being added. I have not noticed any music replacement, again, that's a plus since Flatt and Scruggs appeared on the show in that season. The S4 release had background music replaced, though nothing close to the travesty of The Fugitive or My Three Sons. I didn't find any background music replaced; if it is, it isn't noticeable in any way.

I haven't investigated the extras yet. From what everyone is saying on those, it's the same way that it was with seasons 2 and 3; the product sponsor plug is at the end of the theme for either Kellogg's or Winston, and a picture of the sponsor's product is seen at the end of the show.

All in all, this is worth the $17.96 I got it for at WalMart. I wish CBS would get on the ball and give us the rest of the seasons since this has been on the stalled list for a while; it's been 2 1/2 years since S4 was released to DVD. 2008 is when they started releasing the series, so we've gone a full 8 years and only have 4 seasons. Hurry up, CBS!!!",1462060800,27,2896,4.294871794871795

7441812,5,B015J50NNY,"I was so elated to find out The Official First Season was FINALLY going to be released on DVD after all these years.  The wait was surely WORTH IT!!  The picture has been digitally remastered and is crystal clear.  The sound quality is great.

I thought it would be a long shot to hope that the sponsor messages would be included with this DVD release.  However, I was shocked to find them included here.  I had watched a few of the Winston Cigarette commercials featuring the cast on YouTube.  I fell in love with those commercials and the nostalgia of it all.  Well, those very same commercials are included in this release, as well as the Kellogg commercials.  Those alone are worth buying this set for.  True vintage nostalgia.

You'll find all the episodes in their original broadcast order and format.  Another extra bonus is the rarely seen Extended Pilot.

All in all, this is a MUST HAVE for any fan, new or old, of The Beverly Hillbillies.  50 years after it's original release and it still holds up to the test of time.  They don't make quality shows like this anymore.  You truly can watch this show with your entire family.

8733773,5,B015J50NNY,"I used to watch this show in reruns when I was a young kid.  I always thought it was funny, which is why I decided to buy the first season and show it to my 15-year-old daughter.  I did not remember how gut-busting hillarious it is!  My whole family laughed so hard we had to stop watching more than a few shows at a time due to stomach discomfort.  Even the teenager loves it.  Such a great classic tv show, they don't make them like this anymore.  In fact I have to say that I really have never laughed this hard in my life.  Please release season 5, we are out of new episodes to watch.",1520467200,,589,4.025862068965517
