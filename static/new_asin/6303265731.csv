612679,4,6303265731,"Tommy Lee makes the movie worth watching except for the one objectionable scene with Hamilton.

She does not do her role justice but I assume this is about the beginning of her career.  At times her delivery of speech was much too soft.

Her acting was ok. As for pulling a car heist?  Ah, well!

What a way to lose his evidence.  Hey, the police hired Quint! What do they expect?

Great action - darn good actors - fast enough pace for the story - Tommy Lee just keeps getting better.

612680,3,6303265731,"Tommy Lee Jones plays a freelance thief who is hired by the US government to steal a computer tape from a Las Vegas gang boss .The gand members  are less than delighted when he accomplishes his mission and set out to get the tape back and eliminate him in the process. With the gang in hot pursuit he conceals the tape in the Black Moon ,a new experimental car with some distinctly high performance features .Unfortunately for him the car is stollen by Linda Hamilton for a hot car ring run by Robert Vaughn .

Jones need to retrieve the car and the tape -no easy task given that they are in a fortress like office tower AND the bad guys ,headed by Vin Rames ,together with a federal agent ,played splendidly by Bubba Smith are all after him ,and not for the purpose of selling him health insurance !

The story is not especially plausible but the vigorous direction from Harley Cokliss helps paper over the narrative cracke .Jones is -as ever-splendid and the rest of the cast are way better than the material

Good action scenes and a lively pace ensure you will have a good time watching this -although one scene in which Jones absorbs a brutal beating seemed a tad over the top to me .It just lacked a better script to elevate it a  notch or two higher in the eighties thriller league",1105747200,,1288,4.394957983193278

First of all this is not a duel layer disk, so a skip should not happen. Actually the skip (close to halfway through the movie) is much worse on duel layer discs. This made me mad. If I pay close to 30 bucks for a dvd, I expect it to be in tip top shape. I returned it for an exchange and guess what! Same skip but only much, much worse than on my first version. I even have a top-of-the-line DVD player; a sony. I give up. The movie is good, but be causious, most versions of this disc (my family and friends have the same bad skip on their dvd's) contain that terrible skip.

612736,5,6303265731,"This for movie only not DVD. The movie is better than average high tech 80's movies with great future super car and acting by Jones and Vaughn.
The movie has plenty of fight scenes without using the current special effects crap that is just annoying and looks so fake. The driving scenes also
are real driving stunts! I love they used a 80's Dodge Shelby cause I use to have one but it didn't have a motor to sound like a muscle car. Jones
is cool tough guy thief working for Govt and Vaughn is a big mob car thief boss who steals the super car that Jones has hidden secret records in
so he has to retrieve for Govt. He runs into Linda Hamilton who works for Vaughn who is the coolest actor ever and should have had more scenes.
Hamilton is typical kinda tough girl but sexy no surprise. The best part is the ridiculous car chase inside the building that results in Jones crashing
the car thru one of these twin towers and landing in the other one! nice stunt but not realistic. The ending was OK could have been better. But for
80's it was a good flick. It's much like most Carpenter films even though he didn't direct. It's a blast from the past.",1461456000,,1148,4.2465753424657535

612744,4,6303265731,"In Black Moon Rising (1986) Tommy Lee Jones plays a professional thief hired by the FBI to apprehend a data tape to incriminate a questionable company. Oddly enough, once he gets the tape hes forced to hide it on a prototype supercar, which is stolen by a woman (Linda Hamilton) who works for a professional car-theft ring led by a character played by Robert Vaughn. Richard Jaeckel plays the inventor of the supercar and Bubba Smith an intimidating FBI official.

While the film was written and produced by John Carpenter and features the stars noted above, the budget was limited, which is evident in a few areas. For instance, the supercar -- named Black Moon --looks rather cheesy, although Im sure it looked neato futuristic in the mid-80s. Nevertheless the outlandish story keeps your attention, particularly the interesting caper in the third act, borrowing elements of other 80s films/shows like James Bond, Beverly Hills Cop (1984), Knight Rider and Terminator (1984). Hamilton is likable as always, but the feminine eye candy is limited to her and shes too thin for my tastes. Still, you cant go wrong with Linda.

The film runs 100 minutes and was shot in Lancaster, Hollywood and Los Angeles, California.

Is it ""Mission: Impossible"" meets ""It Takes A Thief,"" or ""Bullit"" meets ""Die Hard""? Its got elements of all of them, with a plot that doesnt lag and action that doesnt disappoint. Were definitely in Carpenter territory here: hi-tech toys, fast-paced action, a minimum of verbiage and enough humor to keep it from taking itself too seriously.
The driving action includes some nicely choreographed car chases through the streets of L.A., and a final aerodynamic stunt thats still impressive. Even today, the flick still looks hi-tech (except for the bulky cell phones) which is no small achievement.",1421625600,,852,4.795918367346939

Look for it here on Amazon.

This release is also by Starz / Anchor Bay (DVD Release Date: January 30, 2001), but apparently some people have had skipping issues with this version (see the other reviews). Also, avoid the other releases which are cheap for a reason; most are full screen and poor quality transfers. Some even have the opening ""computer text"" removed.

612987,4,6303265731,"This review is for the Black Moon Rising DVD with UPC 013131549690 and ASIN: B000WC38DM, from Starz / AnchorBay. DVD Release Date: December 18, 2007.

There are several versions of Black Moon Rising available on DVD. Please be aware that many have VERY poor transfers, are full-screen (cropped), and some are even missing the opening computer ""text"" that sets up the plot. I've purchased three versions on DVD and this one (The 2007 release) seems to be the only one that finally gets it right.

Black Moon Rising is based on a story by John Carpenter, who is also listed as a co-writer of the screenplay. If you're looking for a good action B-Movie from the 80's, Black Moon Rising should be at the top of your list. Here's why....

Perfectly cast; Tommy Lee Jones totally owns the role of ""Quint"", a character that should have seen many more big screen adventures. Linda Hamilton, fresh off her ""Terminator"" success, delivers a fine performance as ""Nina"", a professional car thief. Film and TV veteran Robert Vaughn (The Man From UNCLE, Magnificent Seven) makes an excellent villain. Even the supporting cast (Bubba Smith, Richard Jaeckel, Lee Ving) are right on target!

I cannot review this movie without also mentioning the OUTSTANDING score by legendary tv and film composer Lalo Schifrin, who is perhaps best known for having created the ""mission impossible"" theme. I must also mention the incredible ""Black Moon"" car, which looks absolutely great!

The weakest link within the film is a screenplay that could have used a rewrite, and a few special effects in need of a bit more work. But in the end, it's the cast, music, and overall ""style"" of the film that more than makes up for the low-budget and script problems.

Black Moon Rising is a low-budget, 80's B-Movie that is certain to entertain! And with this DVD release, we finally get a decent, unedited transfer of the film!!

JM",1200355200,42,1892,4.820987654320987
612988,2,6303265731,"Quint (Jones) works for the US Government. Nope, he's not your average desk jockey doing 9 to 5.  He steals things they need.  In this particular case, he's stealing a corporation's tax records.  Unfortunately, he hid them on an experimental car (the Black Moon) which has been stolen by Nina (Linda Hamilton) as part of a syndicate run by her boyfriend Ed Ryland (Robert Vaughn).

Now, Quint's got 72 hours to get that car back or the US Government will be down on him. ""Don't f--- with the US Government,""  their agent warns, and Quint believes them.

Unfortunately, the multistory headquarters for the car theft ring looks about as secure as Fort Knox. Quint's got a few things going for him--some inside connections and the fact that Nina's having some disputes with Ryland over keeping the Black Moon.

""Black Moon Rising"" had a lot of potential, but the film doesn't sustain the initial suspense through its middle.  The end is reasonably satisfying, but you have to fight boredom to get there.

I'll watch almost anything with Tommy Lee Jones in it and adding John Carpenter just makes it a bonus, but this video is not the best quality I have ever seen.  Before you invest in a disk that's got skips, just rent the film.  If you really have to buy it, know the disk is flawed.",1192665600,2,1284,4.612334801762114

It's one of his original film efforts circa 1986, it features a Tommy Lee Jones, as a thief under contract by the US District Attorney's office. He is charged with retrieving vital records kept at a company and things go sideways upon his escape.

While he is retreating from the theft he is seen by a man from his past. He hides the records in a special prototype car called the Black Moon as he tries to evade his pursuers. And in traditional John Carpenter style the car he hides it in gets stolen by carjacking specialist Linda Hamilton. Jones follows her to a warehouse filled with stolen high priced autos which happens to be owned by suave criminal Robert Vaughn.

If you are a Carpenter fan you'll find a pleasurable film experience in Black Moon Rising. The snappy dialog, the old 80's clothing and the really cool chases made even more spectacular by Carpenter's attention to detail make this a definite must see film.",1155254400,2,977,4.641618497109826

However, I suspected the DVD was a bootleg copy when it first began to play, and so I then popped in my VHS tape.  Sure enough, the very first scene, which is only about 30 seconds long, is missing on the DVD.  It's critical because the scene sets up WHY the rest of the movie is important... a telex message advising a government operative to use any freelance methods necessary to retrieve accounting files from a company guilty of [...].
