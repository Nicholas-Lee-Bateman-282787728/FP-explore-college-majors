After he dies in a plane crash in KILLERS FROM SPACE, Doug Martin (Peter Graves) is revived by extraterrestrials who hypnotize him into spying for them in advance of an all-out invasion. It's not apparent at first that this sci-fier is just another excuse for macro photography clips until Graves gets an injection of truth serum. In fact, except for a lone wall portrait of Ike Eisenhower that appears more often than your brother-in-law at dinnertime, everything here up to the needle seems quite stylish. Then a drugged Graves recounts his ludicrous story of aliens with ping pong ball eyes who plan to unleash their menagerie of giant bugs and lizards on an unsuspecting Earth, and everything goes right down the pipes.

Boring stock film clips, overwrought acting and a faux-dramatic score make the story's second half laughably bad. After a chase scene in a 1950s power plant, we see through open venetian blinds that famous atomic bomb blast as the cast gathers on-camera and stares dumbfounded at its expanding mushroom cloud. But they're not silently contemplating the death of eyeball aliens or even humanity's imminent extinction. No, these disaffected thespians are all mentally resolving to dump their agents for saddllng them with this turkey.
