I agree that big hits like Come As You Are Teen Spirit there are no versions of those songs b,but  for any Nirvana fan it is a must own.

Unfortunately Kurt passed before its completion and Krist & Dave had to finish it they way they thought it should be.  Some of the performances highlight their rebelliousness towards the showbusiness media entities that they held contempt for, even though they were hosting their appearances.  Some viewers complain about the footage quality, or lack of technical prowess in shooting some venues, but they're missing the point of the compilation.  It shows the geniune raw character of the band, from the early days of small, raucous clubs, to the eventual massive arena days in the end.

619431,1,6303296726,"For a band that arguably had just two big hits, these people are pretty selfish. Selfish
enough to deprive the fans of their two biggest hits a decent live version of their
two biggest hits.

Who but a fan of those songs would pay $20 for a DVD, only
to receive the slap in the face of not one, but TWO parody versions of Smells Like
Teen Spirit in it, a third parody of Come As You Are, and no further reference
to those songs?

What gives?  The video is supposed to be a live documentation of
the phenomenon that took Nirvana to the stratosphere of fame, yet it pointedly
IGNORES the two songs that drove the entire thing. Worse, it denigrates them.
One live version of Smells Like Teen Spirit included here features the charming
gesture of Cobain opening the beginning bars of their biggest hit, the crowd roaring
in recognition,  and then Cobain suddenly trailing
off and refusing to play the rest of the song, with Krist announcing ""We're gonna skip
that one.""

The other live version of Smells Like Teen Spirit included here is
a parody version that Cobain taped live for a television show  in England, where he deliberately garbles the
words and mocks the song throughout, with the band jumping around in protest that they
had to play along to a recording of the music.  Some respect for fans of the original song here,
many who probably paid their $20 to see Nirvana's biggest song played live.

Then the mocking version of 'Come As You ARe', the only version of it included on the DVD, where Cobain also garbles this song while singing with the voice of a brain damaged drug addict with Downs Syndrome.
This was Nirvana's second biggest hit, yet only this horrible version was chosen to be on a live compilation of their greatest hits?  Why? To punish those who enjoyed their work?  Why? To prove how sophisticated Kurt Cobain is?

What the point of this 'punishing' of Nirvana fans who liked these two songs is, is beyond me.
This live video project was conceived and compiled according to the wishes and directives of Kurt Cobain,
and was not completed until after his death.  Krist and Dave cannot be faulted for leaving the project
in the format that Cobain himself planned, so the question remains as to why Cobain hated these two songs enough to go to such lengths as to not only denigrate them, but insist that the denigrations be shoved
in the faces of fans who would care to buy the DVD? Why?

Ardent fans will insist that this was just to
be 'original' and show the world snippets of some of the truly unconventional and unexpected moments
of the band. To those ardent worshippers, I ask the question. If that were the goal, why is it necessary
to include the full length versions of such 'moments', to the entire exclusion of any decent full length
version of both those songs?  Sure, I agree that the band's eccentricities are part of their story, and
snippets or outtakes could be included in such a project. It could even have been put in the DVD extras.
But FULL LENGTH parodies, and NO REAL VERSIONS of their two biggest hits in a live greatest hits compilation ?
It defies explanation.

Maybe some day the world will know the real reason that Kurt Cobain hated those two songs.",1254614400,4,3203,4.555749128919861

Best thing in this DVD is the Extras - where you actually get to watch Nirvana in action without much editing. But that's like 6 songs or so. If you want very short documentary and some Cobain interviews - then this will suffice, but if you want a pure concert without silly editing - wait until better concert DVDs will be released.",1202515200,,464,4.224719101123595

619466,5,6303296726,"My impression before I actually saw this DVD is that I might not like it as much since I favored the MTV Unplugged Nirvana performance (very different from the performances here), however, I was pleasantly surprised with the entire DVD because in the end, I actually did enjoy it more than I thought I would. The entire DVD is full of Nirvana's hard rocking rendition of songs - making it a bit more difficult to hear the spoken lyrics (which I like to do when I listen to music) but even so, I found myself enjoying the pace, the harsher, relentless pounding of the way the music was played, and watching the antics of what now - at this point in time - appears to be very young men caught in the tumult of their own fame. I saw a side to the band's music I hadn't known previously. Definitely a good addition to any Nirvana fan's collection.",1198713600,,843,4.341772151898734
619467,5,6303296726,I bought this on VHS and wore the tape out-twice.  I'm so glad they have it on DVD now.  It is a testament to how powerful the band could be in concert.  Kurt's ability to alter/enhance the meaning of a song by how he ennunciated the words is breathtaking.  This DVD has stellar examples of how raw he could be.  I think it also shows some of the humor that I think fans who were not around at the time might miss.  I love this DVD.,1181001600,,432,3.9651162790697674

619471,5,6303296726,"I remember buying this on VHS back in the 90's after it was released and being blown away by the footage - it captured the energy and attitude of Nirvana so perfectly. This was a project that was started during Kurt's lifetime yet was finished after his departure and it still managed to convey the original concept of the late Cobain.

The highlights are many on this great video, but among the best are:

1) The performance of 'Territorial Pissings' on a British TV appearance instead of the announced song, 'Lithium'. The set ends with the band trashing the instruments and walking off stage to the sound of feedback, which has the TV host plugging his ears.

2) A Top of the Pops appearance that has the band mockingly throwing their instruments around and blatantly playing off key to the prerecorded 'Smells Like Teen Spirit'. Kurt sings the song in a high-pitched scream during parts and also a low almost operatic tone, changing the words at points and almost swallows the microphone during the 'Hello, Hello, Hello, How low'.

3) The live footage of the band destroying their instruments during the song 'Endless Nameless' is some of the most powerful stuff on the video. Kurt's heart-wrenching yells accompanied by images of him throwing himself around with his guitar wrecklessly, jumping into speakers and drum kits seems to display not only the attitude of Nirvana as a band, but also reveals the inner turmoil of Cobain.

There is really not any dull moments on this video and the interviews are great. The DVD version comes with some extra footage which is nice bonus material, but the original video is the real gem. A must have for any fan of the band.

RECOMMENDATION: If you don't already own all of Nirvana's albums be sure not to forget the 1992's 'Incesticide', a release of odds and ends that really captures the sloppy brilliance that was Nirvana.",1168041600,5,1871,4.777089783281734
619472,4,6303296726,"First of all, it shouldn't have taken this long to see this released on DVD. Especially when Geffen distributed the film in Brazil back in 2002 on a promo disc for the self-titled hits album. But overall, the DVD is great. I saw some new things hiding in the corner that I didn't notice in the original VHS version. The only things that I hate which many people have already mentioned is the grainy-ness in a lot of the home movie/camcorder footage. Is this normal for a digital transfer and remaster? I wouldn't think so. Also, hearing ""On A Plain"" three times in a row was very annoying; as the last song before the credits, as the ""Nevermind Rehersal Footage"" which was TERRIBLE, and lastly as part of the bonus footage in Amsterdam.

Watching this dvd I wished I could have gone to at least one live show. Nirvana never came our way. Can imagine if they did tour South-Africa.

619508,3,6303296726,"This is an average DVD. I know that many fellow Nirvana fans are starving for some kind of live footage, but this footage is just mediocre, sorry. Most of the video quality is aweful compared to many other concert DVD's in my collection.

The best part is in the extra footage where you get five songs from the Amsterdam concert. The main film consists of various different shows. Most performances are cut short and interupted by talking and various other home videos. These outakes would be nice as an extra, but I don't like them in the middle of the film.

If you are a fan get this DVD if for nothing else the Amsterdam performance and to see Kurt Cobain in various stages of mental depression and breakdowns. As far as I am concerned we will have to wait for Nirvana Unplugged to hit DVD to get a great concert film with Cobain on top of his game.",1163030400,4,853,4.3584905660377355
619509,5,6303296726,"The great concert film once only available on VHS is now on DVD!  It's about time.  The bad news is that there was no attempt made to correct any of the factual errors in the liners.  No, ""About a Girl,"" ""Breed"" and ""Polly"" aren't from Seattle '92, it's 10/31/91.  No, the songs from Brazil are not from Sao Paulo, but Rio de Janerio.  No, ""Negative Creep"" isn't from '91, but '92.  ""Something In the Way"" isn't from '91 either, but is from '92.  That's an AWFUL lot of mistakes!  The ""With the Lights Out"" box set had all the correct information in there..  I don't understand why there are so many mistakes in these liners.

It's also too bad the extras we got are from just one concert, and that being a widely available one.  2 of the 5 songs are available from other perfomances in the proper film, but with the way Nirvana product trickles out, we should be glad we got anything at all.

The film itself is brilliant.  I wore my VHS out and this DVD brings back a lot of memories of this powerful and genius band.  They were a force to be reckoned with and will be badly missed.  These live performances are totally exciting and really capture the brief and wonderful moment when Nirvana ruled the world.  The camcorder shots look more grainy then the VHS, but the sound is much improved on and the professionally shot stuff is as sharp as ever.  Hopefully this will pave the way for a video collection, Unplugged, and a DVD of TV appearances from the US and Europe.  The band hung it up 12 years ago.  Give us some product now!

In any event, Nirvana was a force that changed the metal genre for the good or bad, which ever way you see it.

Nirvana was a creative force that was refreshingly welcomed when it occured. It was like opening the windows to let the air in and blow away all the stuffy metal music that was all too much alike at the time.

My favorite would have to be the take on ""Something In The Way,"" in my opinion that's the best song on the tape as far as the proformance goes.
I was a little disappointed with the take on ""Smells Like Teen Spirit."" Kurt purposly sang it different because that's the song everyone liked, and he they were kind of sick of playing it. Don't get me wrong the song wasn't bad, he just sang it more in the form of an Opra Singer, rather then in his own voice.
The back-stage footage and interviews are awesome! The video itself is worth buying just for that alone. - All-in-all, I rate this 4 Stars, the ending could have been better, as it just has Kurt crawling off the stage...",1084492800,2,814,4.2243589743589745
619559,5,6303296726,"More than your average live rock video, this is a work of art that tackles head-on the insane rollercoaster that Nirvana found themselves on, and takes Kurt and the band's anti-rock star message to its logical conclusion, kicking off with the gloriously sarcastic opening speech.
Full of press and interview snippets, and ending in a glorious orgy of destruction montage as Endless Nameless bleeds from your TV speakers, this was always going to be a video for fans of the band. It does not pander to popular music tastes.
Hence, we get the first couple of bars of 'Smells Like Teen Spirit' from a live show before the band grinds to a halt and tells the audience, ""we're gonna skip that one."" (Footage of the band from BBC's Top Of The Pops makes up the rest of 'Teen Spirit's place on this video, the vocals delivered by Kurt in a hillarious ""goth"" voice.)
'Come As You Are' is also played out-of-tune (I believe they purposely screwed up the entire set, but only 'CAYA' appears on this video from that gig) apparently because the band had a problem with the audience for slagging off the support acts. Don't quote me on that though, my memory's pretty hazy about it but I'm too lazy to look it up!! Another notable moment is the fracas between Kurt and a violent security guard, which has to be seen to be believed.
This is essentially Kurt's video, he conceived it and had very specific ideas about where it would go, but the film wouldn't be completed until after Kurt's death. In the concluding scene, Kurt, apprently exhausted, puts his guitar down and crawls off-stage.

619606,5,6303296726,"I have to admit, at first, I didn't like this too much. It just seemed too messy and disjointed, as some of the live performances of certain tracks are like cut-and-paste collages featuring bits of footage taken from various different concerts and spliced together - sometimes within a single song. But, after watching this quite a few times, I started to appreciate the artistic quality in this -- as well as having fun watching these three in action.
This footage was mostly recorded during the 1991-1992 era during the release and popularity of their _Nevermind_ album, and as a result, you aren't going to hear any tracks beyond the _Nevermind_ era (_Incesticide_ was mostly recorded in 1990, but released in 1992, so that really doesn't count.) You get to witness the ""backstage"" or offstage antics of Kurt Cobain, Dave Grohl and Krist Novoselic, and as you witness their tomfoolery, you realize that these three ""weirdos"" were meant for each other, as they seem to be in sync with one another, without intent. You also get to hear their feelings on superstardom, witness some nifty performances and other such stuff.
Here's a listing of the live tracks performed on here:
(1). Aneurysm. (2). About A Girl. (3). Dive. (4). Love Buzz. (5). Breed. (6). Smells Like Teen Spirit. (7). Negative Creep. (8). Come As You Are. (9). Territorial Pissings. (10). Something In The Way . (11). Lithium. (12). Drain You. (13). Polly. (14). Sliver. (15). On A Plain. (16). Noise (which is basically comprised of bits from ""Endless, Nameless,"" the hidden track on certain copies of _Nevermind_, added with destruction.)
Some things worth mentioning are: (1). The performance of ""Something In The Way"" is in a different key than the studio version, as well as being amped-up. (2). During the first clip of the ""Love Buzz"" performance, Kurt dives into the audience, possibly hoping to do some crowd surfing. It gets a little out of hand as the bouncer is trying to keep things organized, but he gets hit in the head by the body of Kurt's guitar quite a few times, which leaves a bit of a gash in the bouncer's head. I'm not sure if Kurt did this on purpose or not. But, after Kurt returns to the stage, the bouncer comes from behind and punches Kurt in the back of his head, and kicks him once. After that, the concert pretty much stops, as Krist comes to Kurt's defense, and soon Dave is seen flying from behind his drum kit to help out as well.
(3). Anyone wondering where all those concert clips seen in the video for ""Lithium"" came from, you can find them all on this set. (4). The ending features something Nirvana seemed to love to do: destroy their instruments and equipment. At the end, Krist does a little bit of batting practice - with musical instruments. Kurt chucks his guitar in the air, and when it lands, it breaks in half. Afterwards, Krist picks up the body of Kurt's broken guitar, and uses it as a baseball. He uses his bass as a bat, and chucks the body of the broken guitar in the air and tries to hit it. After a miss on the first shot, he hits on the second shot, and the audience applauds. Some really demented stuff.
Enough of my rambling. Case and point: if you're a Nirvana fan, you HAVE to own this. You get to see other sides of the members of Nirvana that you wouldn't have seen elsewhere. Plus with the fun footage, and performances, how can you go wrong?",1054857600,66,3374,4.597014925373134

619610,5,6303296726,"This video transcends normal rock video biographies. Most band videographies consist only of their songs. However, Kurt actually had a hand in making this video so his artistry graces it's lining. Here you don't just get an awesome selection of songs, you get a visual barrage of what it was like to be in the whirlwind success of what was Nirvana.

The video starts out at a nice pace. Relaxed and posed. After the ancient video of Love Buzz where Kurt demolishes a bouncer's head with the butt of his guitar; you begin to see the pace of the video speed up. What ensues is dramatic climax showcasing some of the bandmember's goofy antics, and eventually with them being engulfed by the hailstorm known as success. The fame, the drugs, the immensely consuming lure of being on stage in front of thousands of fans.

What I like about this video, is the chance to know Kurt a little bit more by the character he exudes on stage. He is charismatic in the most strangest of ways. Through his point of view (the video) you can see what tremendous pressures he was faced with, and eventually how much injury that was inflicted upon him by being a rock star.

Great songs such as the British TV appearance: ""Smells Like Teen Spirit"", the Australian TV appearance: ""Territorial Pissings"", ""Love Buzz"" (Texas/Amsterdam), ""Come As You Are"" being butchered on purpose by Kurt, the insanely good ""Lithium"", and even the anti-climactic ""Endless, Nameless"" all appear on this video, and more!

619648,5,6303296726,"This videotape helps you relive the ragged glory that was Nirvana with footage from several of their live concerts mixed with behind-the-scene , foreign news , and home video footage in between the concert footage.
Kurt and the boys downplayed their popularity and enjoyed shocking the status qou. Some of the funniest and ironic moments are when Nirvana , unpolished by society's standard , were on these very polished programs like ""Top of the Pops"" and ""Tonight with Jonathan Ross"". The boys displayed their rebelliousness and nerve on these two shows by playing WHAT they wanted to play and singing HOW they wanted to sing. Nirvana was not essentially a commercial band but hit it really big in the mainstream anyway and these two clips showed that they weren't going to compromise their grunge integrity nor take their fame seriously. They did whay they wanted to do and didn't care what people thought. In true rock & roll/punk fashion.
The concert footage is terrific , wild , crazed , energetic , funny , and at times disturbing (you can say that , overall , about the tape) from Kurt bashing a stage bouncer in the ear with his guitar and paying the price for it , to a packed stadium crowd wanting Krist Novoselic to shut up and play music(funny) , to Kurt playing a few weary notes on his guitar , dropping to one knee then , quietly , crawling off stage in lingerie. There are two concert clips that might make you cringe but that is part of the shock value of the tape. I won't say what they are but you have been warned.
The things that I don't like about the tape is that near the end they use a couple of clips that were previously shown on the tape and some songs are cut midway and jumps or blends into another concert or video clip. Overall the video is very entertaining on several different levels. Its humorously , shockingly , and nostalgically entertaining. You may find yourself watching this video over and over again and rewinding certain parts to look at again. If you want to see this ground-breaking band in their element during the days of ""Nevermind"" then this is the video for you.",1007164800,46,2114,4.565789473684211

So it looks like we'll have to wait a while for all the cool stuff to get released and the stuff already out there (ie this video) to get re-released.

Mixed in with interviews with the band and news reports from around the globe, L!T!SO! tells the story of Nirvana's rise to fame after the release of Nevermind.  The video does take a few viewings to truly digest, for many of the back-stage shots of the band goofing-off are often very quick and random and the entire video's editing is done in a very fast-pased crazed manner.  Does take away from some of the incredible performances though.  My personal favorite from the video was ""Territorial Pissings"" from the Jonathan Ross Show, which shows Nirvana clearly freaking out the soccermom majority crowd.  The tape has tons of hilarious segments featuring Krist's wicked sense of humor.

619703,5,6303296726,"In the height of my own personal Nirvanamania 5 years ago I couldn't wait to get this & thrilled I was indeed when I sat down & watched it. This features live performances from 1989-1992, backstage camaraderie, interview snippets, & media nonsnese in a continuous stream of images & sounds. the 1st thing is Krist says ""Kill 'em all I say"", maybe relating to that Metallica lp & if you pause you can see Dave looking @ a copy of Sonic youth's EVOL [much better imho], the something else I forgot. I think the 1st song is Aneurysm w/ the [in]famous Reading '92 appearance where Kurt is wheeled in & gets up, moans the 1st line of Bette Midler's The Rose then collapses, all in a wig, then gets up & the band starts. A friend of mine said he was there & it was good even though he was still shouting ""oh you lot aren't as good as Husker Du"" [I think I'd disagree], also something about John Peel running the show, oh also that is not to be confused w/ the even more famous '91 Reading show as seen on the legendary 1991: THE YEAR PUNK BROKE, which L!T!SO!  is only slightly less brilliant than. The footage here varies from super-professional clean imagery & sound, like for About A Girl, to supersloppy lo-fi for the 1st version of Love Buzz, which is where a lot of violence ensues w/ a redneck bar crowd. The interviews w/ him w/ Buddy Holly glasses & bleach-blonde hair are hilarious & insightful. The top of the pops appearance is highly amusing, they show the mockery of all the miming & whoever's running the shwo decides they can't finish the song [yes THE SONG] off & they go to another band during the solo. ""did you see that guy? what a shot!"" is someone's commentary & guitars & basses fly thru the air near the end of the video. there are many other memeorable moments in there but I'm sure you don't want all yr fun spoiled.",969926400,,1836,4.337209302325581
619704,5,6303296726,"Initially supposed to be completed by all band members, this project was  released post-humously after Cobain's 1994 suicide. Although it is  provoking to play ""What would it look like if Kurt had lived?""  the actual video is special in it's own way.

Both Krist, Dave and  whoever else helped edit the video into it's final form should be commended  for working under such morose circumstances. I honestly do not believe it  was easy for these men. They could have just as easily scrapped the  whole idea without explaination. Considering it came moths after his death,  I am certain I would not be able to do as well.

The final project is  as much a history of the band (which was problaly supposed to be it's  original intention) as much as it is a tribute to Cobain.

Even if it is  obvious that the video was supposed to be different, one cannot fault the  two men for mourning over their best friend. Too often, our society forgets  that musicians are people too and suject to the same emotions and flaws as  the rest of the population.

The raw unreleased footage shows a group of  buddies who just happened to become famous from a hit single. That the  members of Nirvana cared for each other is clearly obvious from this movie  and is very emotionally touching.

Also important is the fact that it  revealed members of Nirvana voted in a presidential election. While this  political involvement should not come as a big suprise to die hard Nirvana  fans (who knew of involvement with Rock for Choice, No on Nine and other  campaigns)it would problaly motivate newcomers to get out and change the  system if they perceived something wrong.

I do however agree with the  nausea-themed montage. This group of friends was experiencing some conflict  and pressure because of the intense experience with fame and something  would have to give. Ideally, it should have been all of thr tabloid media  who picked on Kurt and Courtney, but as fate would have it, it was Cobain  himself. The world truly lost an original when Cobain died.",965779200,21,2037,4.6960227272727275

But the last third jetisons the humour and  takes a disturbing view.  Erratic editing, previously seen footage repeated  in slow motion, and constant moaning feedback create the mood of nausea.  This is climaxed with scenes of Nirvana destroying their instruments.  You  realize that all along Nirvana were trying to thwart their fame, when all  it did was increase it.

My favorite part is during the live ""Love Buzz"" when Kurt stage dives and the bouncer paid to protect him tries to bring him back.
