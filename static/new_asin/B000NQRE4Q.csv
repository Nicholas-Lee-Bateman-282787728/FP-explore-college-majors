2777915,5,B000NQRE4Q,"THE TWISTED NERVE is only available in the U.S. on a fuzzy bad-sounding DVD. This version from the UK has beautiful sharpness, color, and sound. Although the film was probably originally released in the European widescreen format of 1.66:1, this 1.33:1 version cuts off
some information from the sides but still looks great. THE TWISTED NERVE is in the tradition of British psycho-thrillers like PEEPING TOM but the big draw here is the spare score by Bernard Herrmann and the killer's haunting whistling theme which has been used by Quentin Tarantino in KILL BILL and the recent cable series AMERICAN HORROR STORY. It's also worth noting that two of the actors, Billie Whitelaw and Barry Foster, later showed up in Hitchcock's FRENZY. If you have a Region 2 or region-free player, this is a great way to see this rarely shown movie.",1330646400,,833,4.873239436619718
2777916,4,B000NQRE4Q,"The Boulting Brothers' shocker ""Twisted Nerve"" (1968) starring the team of Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennett, who teamed before in ""The Family Way"" for the Boulting Brothers and later in Sidney Gilliat's ""Endless Night"" finally appeared on DVD in a Reg. 2 edition some time ago from Optimum Releasing and shortly after appeared for all regions in an edition MOD for Sinister Cinema.  If you have multi-region capability, the Reg. 2 (from the Boulting Brothers Collection) is the winner (see my review).  A very crisp and clear image with no distortions and spectacular sound are all there.  With Sinister Cinema, the image seems fragile as if it could malfunction at any minute while watching and listening to it.  I am thankful it was even presented as this film has had a sleep for about 40 years probably due to the unwarranted controversy surrounding it about chromosomes and mongoloids.  It is otherwise a very original and extremely creative thriller/shocker that really should be seen.  And not just for the score by Hitchcock collaborator, Bernard Herrmann as resurrected by Quentin Tarantino in the ""Kill Bill"" movies.  A five-star movie.  The actors and direction are brilliant as well as the script by Leo Marks and Roy Boulting.  A time to see it.",1329177600,9,1256,4.971291866028708
2777917,4,B000NQRE4Q,"[TWISTED NERVE - (1968) - Directed by Roy Boulting - Fullscreen Presentation]  Clearly this production stepped on some sensitive toes upon release, as it opens with two separate statements - one spoken and one written - absolutely assuring us there's no scientific evidence that there might be a link between Mongolism and criminal behavior. Of course, it's a very provocative and courageous assumption to revolve a psycho-thriller on, especially during the late 60's with the close-minded and easily offended board of censorship in Britain around that time. It's no shock that 'Twisted Nerve' rapidly became a controversial and harshly-hated gem that just recently returned to its deserved cinematic spotlight, thanks in part to Quentin Tarantino utilizing the catchy yet bone-chilling whistled theme song for  his own now-classic 'Kill Bill'.

One of the more unique and original psycho-thrillers made in Britain, this tale concerns Martin (Hywell Bennett in an truly inspired role, who also starred with Haley Mills in 'The Family Way' shortly before this), a young schizophrenic who obtains whatever he desires by posing as Georgie, an intellectually underdeveloped but well-mannered, likable and helpful boy who warrants much pity. As the repellant, arrogant Martin, he's kicked out of the parental house by his controlling, overbearing stepfather, but as the innocent Georgie he's soon taken in by the cherubic Susan (Haley Mills in one of her first 'mature' roles), who works in a library, and her mother (Billie Whitelaw in a splendid role) who runs a boarding house just outside of London. The inhabitants of said boarding house add additional elements of sarcasm, racial and sexual tension that benefit the film nicely, and the derisive banter and black humor lend further spicing to insure we're always entertained during the plots intermittent downtime.

From inside this safe environment he's weaseled himself into, Martin can plot a fiendish revenge against his stepfather and simultaneously become an essential part in the life of the unsuspecting Susan, whom he intends to seduce. There's even a homoerotic subtext regarding Martin, who reads a lot of men's muscle-building magazines and masturbates in front of a mirror afterwards that shatters upon his sexual release, reminding us just how fractured and fragmented his underlying personality actually is. And then there's the suggestive tension between Susan's mom and the needful Martin, a sordid showcasing of motherly love, co-dependency, and the ever-revolving sexual preferences of Martin's various personalities. He's a petrifying character, constantly altering his behavior between that of a demented yet restrained psychopath and a sincere, handsome innocent with the intellectual capacity of a 10 year-old. The extremely intelligent script (supplied by Leo Marks and director Roy Boulting) concocts what is pretty much the perfect murder (though by now we all know there is no such thing), and it's so daringly twisted and blunt that the film is certain to appeal to fans of controversial cinema and psychological thrillers in general. Hywell Bennett's astonishing performance ranks amongst the best and Hayley Mills is equally evocative as Susan. And an indelible score by Oscar-winner Bernard Herrmann certainly doesn't hurt either. There's very little on-screen graphic violence, but the eerie ambiance and carefully drawn characterizations will cause the hairs on the back of your neck to rise and fall throughout the film.

This time around, Sinister Cinema has far exceeded my expectations, giving us a pristine picture print and sharp audio track along with a great flick well worth checking out - it's 'Twisted' for sure, and bound to unsettle your 'Nerve'.",1313884800,18,3743,5.446551724137931
2777918,5,B000NQRE4Q,"First off, I should mention that this is a DVDR. I have no problem with that, especially since the price was very reasonable. The company selling this DVD, ""Sinister Cinema"" should be commended, because after glancing through their other offerings, I see that they have dug up some really good forgotten gems and are finally making them available to the public. (all at very fair prices)
My copy of ""Twisted Nerve"" arrived quickly after placing order. The transfer of this film was great, obviously taken from a really clean print with bold, vibrant colors, and it is a full screen version.
As for the film itself, it holds up rather well after all these years. Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennett had such great chemistry together, and they both immersed themselves in their roles here. Having Billie Whitelaw in the cast was a huge plus, as this great actress easily ups the class and professionalism in any film.
Compared to today's thrillers, Twisted Nerve may not seem so shocking, but there are indeed a couple of shocking moments in this film that still packs a punch.
The biggest drawing factor of this film for me is the odd atmosphere that drenches the entire movie. The director captured a unique time and place, and time has only added to the very impressive oddness.
Overall, the story may seem simple, but the great chemistry of the cast and the wonderful atmosphere has made me highly recommend this film for years.
Now that ""Sinister Cinema"" has made a great print available to the buying public, I still heartily recommend this film to anyone who enjoys oddball thrillers. It's a fun ride that's well worth the great price.",1311984000,32,1635,4.780918727915195
2777919,5,B000NQRE4Q,"The Boulting Brothers, John and Roy had had a success with ""The Family Way"" in 1967 and teamed again their co-stars, Hayley Mills and Hywel Bennett.  Roy Boulting had started an affair with Hayley Mills, 20 years her senior and shocked her fans with a nude scene in ""The Family Way.""

When work was begun on a Hitchcockian story, ""Twisted Nerve"" (from a screen story and idea by Roger Marshall and Jeremy Scott) even had Bernard Herrmann do the score (Hitchcock's long-time collaborator), it began a 40 year sleep for the film until it was released in 2009 on Reg. 2 DVD in the ""Boulting Brothers' Collection.""  Photography was by Harry Waxman.

""No puppet master pulls the string on high, a twisted nerve, a ganglion gone awry, predestinates the sinner or saint.""

This lead-in in 1968 established a cause, one of chromosomes and their mystery, then a curious mix of the youthfulness and then rare inclusion of male nudity amidst the Hitchcock catalog and had an even more delicious flavor of pop art, but the film was attacked because it gave the impression relatives of mongoloids were apt to be psychotic/criminal.

Very different.  It is a new season.",1246060800,2,1156,4.808080808080808
2777920,4,B000NQRE4Q,"Early slasher from the normally staid and respectable Boulting Brothers has Hayley Mills in all kinds of peril from the seriously loonie Hywell Bennett.

'Twisted Nerve' is a nasty film even by my standards. Despite a pre-credits disclaimer that it is in no way suggesting that mongolism is connected with psychotic or criminal behaviour - it proceeds to do just that.
Bennett just luurrves to stab his step-father in the stomach with a scissors and bash his horny landlady in the face with an axe, and his only motivation is a gnarled chromosome.

He flits between characters: from Georgie, a meek, jealous man-child; to Martin, an intelligent, confrontational spoilt boy.
Both are highly dangerous and both have the red-hots for the fetching miss Mills.

The rest of the cast support superbly: Barry (Bob Rusk) Foster plays a racist, sexist, drunken lodger; Billie Whitelaw is the ever-ready landlady and Timothy West excels as a wily, droll police inspector.
Each lends the movie extra worth and rising even though it rarely needs it. West is a particular joy.

A clue as to the true nature of 'Twisted Nerve' comes with the discovery that Leo Marks is the script-writer. This is the guy that wrote 'Peeping Tom' for Michael Powell and it's no great leap from that film to this one.
The similarities are obvious but no less interesting; only here it's a genetic defect that's the villain rather than systematic patriarchal mental abuse, but the resulting psychosis are pretty much the same - as are their outcomes.

Special mention to Bernard Herrmann's annoyingly appropriate theme music which is everywhere in the film: characters whistle it, it plays on the radio and while the 'kids' are getting on down at a party - guess what's spinning on the stereogram?
([edit:] If you think you've heard this devious motif before, Daryl Hannah's character whistles it as she walks down a hospital corridor in an early scene from 'Kill Bill')

'Twisted Nerve' is a disturbing thriller with handsomely offensive overtones. A poem with lines like: 'a ganglion gone awry' is quoted as an explanation for mass-murder, and mental illness is nonchalantly described as 'abnormal'. The science world has a breath-taking theory that a twisted nerve 'predestinates the sinner or the saint' and the always reliably sensitive police bark out phrases like: ""watch your step - this chap's a nutter!"".

This is what happens when people who just don't do this stuff - do this stuff.
Mills is desperately trying to shake her child-star/Disney reputation and the Boultings were usually to be seen making typically resolute British fayre like 'Lucky Jim,' 'I'm Alright Jack' and 'Carlton Browne of the F.O.'
It's probably the sheer scale of this departure that makes brutal-but-precise film-making like 'Twisted Nerve' appear so other-wordly and oddly attractive.",1243728000,7,2839,5.09247311827957

2777943,3,B000NQRE4Q,"""Twisted Nerve"" is an interesting British thriller from the sixties that is a surprisingly good color print from Sinister Cinema. It really looks nice. The story concerns a disturbed young man (Hywel Bennett)  who rebels against his family and becomes obsessed with a pretty young librarian (Hayley Mills). Her mother (Billie Whitelaw) runs a boarding house and Bennett uses a ruse to start living there to keep his eye on Mills. Whitelaw is suspicious but Mills, who is sweet, kind and trusting, convinces her to let him stay.  Bennett is so disturbed that it appears he has two personalities, Martin and Georgy. Things get weird with Whitelaw and Georgy and a couple of grisly murders occur before everything comes unraveled at the disturbing finale. There are a lot of disturbing things in this film. It comes off as a psycho-sexual thriller although Mills remains chaste and clothed throughout. Not so Bennett. If you've never seen this, it's well worth watching since the print is good. The acting is first rate and it has an overall creepy feel thanks to Bennett and Whitelaw and good direction.",1402617600,,1101,4.945945945945946

2777949,4,B000NQRE4Q,"I liked it. The story revolves around a psychotic personality that developed because of a lack of ability to deal with sexual maturity. As is normal, this personality is exceptionally manipulative & willing to play things to the end to get what they want. A great scene showing this is when he ""goes to Paris"" & shows Hayley's mother the note he's written to gain entrance to the house. They originally refuse him & send him back into the rain so he walks slowly away giving the guilt he knows will bother them time to work all the while appearing to be a gentleman & unwilling to put them out.

This is a good suspense movie even though the director is careful to show the rising tide of evil & doesn't give any misdirection to fool the viewer. We know what is going to happen before it happens & it doesn't really matter. The tide of evil comes on almost like a gentle ocean tide; you're in it before you notice the beach is gone.

The term special needs, doesn't really play out here, as it didn't exist at that time. Special Ed. perhaps but this doesn't involve education. It is as the book title said, Psychopathia Sexualis which doesn't necessarily require what we term today special needs as a spawning ground. It's the inability to deal with sexual maturation that drives this movie. Other movies that deal with this subject are Black Swan of 2010 & perhaps the best known, Repulsion by Roman Polanski (1965) from the UK also. Twisted Nerve is about the male end of the story while the other two deal with this psychosis & dual personality on the female end. Strangely or perhaps obviously the two female centered movies deal with the opposite ends of one mental health strata that being the ""do harm to others"" end. The other is "" do harm to oneself"". Repulsion deals with ""does harm to others"" while Black Swan deals with ""does harm to self"".

Hywel Bennett is very good here as the troubled soul & Hayley Mills comes across as a full blown young adult (with boobs). I'm going to have to check on Hywel Bennett at imdb as I'm totally unaware of him. While no role here is complicated except for Bennett's they are all competently portrayed. Heck I like this movie better as I type. It's not an Oscar contender but it is a couple of steps above the norm. 4 Amazon stars I'll say. An enjoyable ride.",1377043200,4,2307,4.462085308056872

2777961,1,B000NQRE4Q,"This is an excellent film and my rating here is limited only to the Sinister Cinema version of the film.  The manufacturer, Sinister Cinema, has placed a ""SC"" branding mark on the lower right corner of the screen which is very distracting from the film.  Frankly, I have never understood why television/cable networks and certain distributors feel the need to ""birthmark"" films, especially if a consumer has purchased it!

Furthermore, the packaging does not provide any information about the film other than a poorly printed copy of the film poster on the front and a generic description of the Sinister Cinema company/brand.

2777964,3,B000NQRE4Q,"Homicidal sociopath Martin (Hywel Bennett) poses as simpleton Georgie to duck a shoplifting rap and save face before love interest Hayley Mills in this light yet overly conceived psychosexual thriller from the U.K.'s Boulting brothers, 1968. The supporting cast is excellent, and leads Mills and Bennett (paired also in 'The Family Way' and 'Agatha Christie's Endless Night') work well together, but the script eventually gets mired in a lot of textbook mumbo jumbo about genetics (sparking some controversy at the time in its frankness regarding what was known about mental retardation) that dilutes the plot, ultimately rendering the film more quaint than frightening while spotlighting the story's main technical problem: the incredible gullibility of Martin's victims. Similar imbalances afflicted Michael Powell's 'Peeping Tom' eight years earlier, illustrating how masterful by comparison Hitchcock was in mixing suspense with the clinical concept of psychological aberration in 'Psycho.' Still, performances and production values make 'Twisted Nerve' a better-than-average effort, and the public-domain prints circulating on DVD are surprisingly good. 3 stars.",1362614400,,1167,5.9523809523809526

2777967,5,B000NQRE4Q,"When this film came out in the late 1960's it was dealing with a very controversial subject.  In fact there is a written and verbal disclaimer from the Producers at the beginning of the film to say that there is no evidence connecting ""Down Syndrome"" (which was then known as ""Mongolism"") with any form of mental illness e.g. Pscychotic bahaviour.  The film was dealing with a very touchy subject at the time so this definitely affected the original success of what is now considered an excellent film.  How times have changed!!!  Hywel Bennett an incredibly versatile actor is truly superb as Martin/Georgie.  He is also gorgeous to look at and has a wonderfully expressive face.  Hayley Mills has matured from the adorable child actress into a lovely leading lady!  Billie Whitelaw one of Britain's most talented actresses delivers a fine performance as Hayley's Mother. All the other actors fit their characters well.  The story is well put together and because the acting is so good it makes for a very creepy but entertaining film. Hayley and Hywell had been teamed up before in the fun film : ""The Family Way"" in 1966 and they also went on to make a really  interesting version of ""Agatha Christie's Endless Night"" in 1972!

8180817,5,B000NQRE4Q,"An excellent film examining the psychotic behaviour of a young man Martin (Hywell Bennett), who has reached man hood after years of protective mollycoddling by his Mother (Phyllis Calvert) .

After giving up her first son Pete, who was born with Down's Syndrome, to an institution since birth, she, with the immense wealth provided by her second husband Henry Durnley (Frank Finlay), has lavished Martin with more than most could ever wish for. The only trouble is, she has cherished the little boy in him, inadvertently stunting his natural development from boy to adolescent and then young man. Therefore Martin has seemingly tried to direct himself into becoming a man, by buying muscle building magazines, but instead, when emotions are stirred within him, by anger or otherwise, finds himself attracted to and pleased by his undeveloped, boy like body. He then becomes completely disgusted and filled with self-loathing as his adult sexual arousal rears its ugly head, destroying his childhood safe haven, with the ever flowing love from his doting and forgiving Mother. So without an elder brother to emulate, his own father dead but not missed, his step-father a resentful father figure, and the only 'woman' in his life being his Mother, it is perhaps hardly likely that Martin is a mixed up, troubled and angry young man.

The film refers to the condition of Down's Syndrome as Mongolism. A term that is looked upon as indelicate today, but back in the 1960's it was the general term used with no disrespect attached.

It also states that one in so many thousands are born with the condition, but this by no means leads to that person growing up to become psychotic. However, if by chance one is born with an abnormal chromosome - a 'twisted nerve' as quoted from a poem by the film's Doctor, then this might lead to a troubled mind or behavioural problems.  The Doctor does question though, whether an unhappy childhood or home conditions fuels a psychotic character more so than a 'twisted nerve'.

Martin, by chance, first spots the very pretty and kind young woman, Susan Harper (Hayley Mills), whilst he is shopping for a toy for his brother Pete, but through sheer devilment puts the small toy in his pocket. He and Susan, mistaken for a couple are stopped for shoplifting.

Martin plays his ace hand to get out of trouble by taking on his inner 'alter-ego' Georgie - an innocent minded boy in a man's body,  who lives in hotels with his wealthy businessman 'Daddy'.

As Georgie, Martin quickly gleans the address of his new heart's desire Susan and after a final row with his unsympathetic step-father, feigns a trip to Paris, but goes to stay, in a Georgie/Martin existence, with Susan at her Mother's boarding house.

Troubles then arise as Martin is sexually attracted to Susan and is intensely jealous of her present boyfriend, but has to remain as Georgie. Susan's mother (Billie Whitelaw) is intrigued by Georgie, and is herself finally aroused by sexual/motherly feelings for this good looking man-boy. Martin also has a deep hatred for his step-father and sets out to settle the matter.

There are excellent supporting roles throughout by Barry Foster as 'Gerry', a paying guest and current sex interest in Mrs Harper's life, and Salmaan Peer who plays 'Shashi' another paying guest, sympathetic trainee Doctor and ally of Susan.

Please note that the brilliant theme music, known as 'Georgie's Theme', written by the late, great Bernard Herrmann, has since been used in the film Kill Bill and in television commercials. But for me personally, it will always remain as Georgie's Theme!

Great film, great music, great cast - enjoy!",1433030400,,3655,4.93485342019544
