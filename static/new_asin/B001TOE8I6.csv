8575069,5,B001TOE8I6,This is such a great piece of cinematic magic. Shaun Paul Costello and Krista Boshinski's chemistry is absolutely breath taking watching the two of them together took my breath away. These two are going to be huge stars. The whole story is absolutely beautiful and all of the cast is very talented. If you're looking to enjoy a good movie at home you'll want to pick this up and enjoy this film with your closest loved ones.,1259971200,,424,4.51948051948052
8575070,5,B001TOE8I6,"I thought that this was one of the best pieces of cinema I have seen in a long time. I thought lead actor Alan McClintock did an amazing job along with the other very talented actors. The original score was brilliant and really drove the story home, as well as adding to the overall atmosphere. I loved the surprise ending, but you'll have to see that for yourself because I don't want to give anything away. I thought that director Ramesh Anthony did an incredible job putting the whole thing together and I can tell that he is definetly a talent we need to watch. I have a feeling more good things will be coming from him shortly.",1235952000,,632,4.364406779661017
