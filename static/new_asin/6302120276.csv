Check it out!!!",1043539200,3,137,3.7586206896551726
7821960,5,6302120276,"I Eat Your Skin is the ulitmate in low budget horror for its time. Everything about it is just right for its audience. The zombies are eerie and sport wierd makeup with bulging eyes. It also contains probably horror's first decapitaion by machete. It is a must for all zombie film fans, especially since these zombies run around and are extremely dangerous,rather than just slinking around. I Eat Your Skin is by far one of the better films of the 60's.",975888000,7,453,4.604938271604938
