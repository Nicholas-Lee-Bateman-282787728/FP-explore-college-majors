7799060,5,1577821955,"Excellent. I have watched it many times and it only gets more emotional for me each time.

Whenever I need a good cry, this will do it every time.

The musical follows St. Peter and his transformation. It deals with his denial of Christ, how it changed him and his final proclamation of Jesus that brought Peter to his own cross.

Objectively, the audio quality is spotty (live performance) and some of the songs are better written than others. It can seem campy to some, but I don't care. When it works, it works beautifully and moves me.

The whole musical, I think, is redeemed and bookended by the Apostles singing ""Do you remember?"" at the beginning and Peter and Abby performing ""I'm already saved"" at the end (I have no idea what these songs are really called). Those two songs are masterful and are worth buying the DVD many times over.",1366675200,,844,4.532894736842105
7799061,4,1577821955,"I bought this as a gift for a friend, but I have one of my own that I've watched countless times.  Each time I come away inspired.  I also have the unabridged version from 1987.  Scripture tells us that Peter was married (Matt 8.14), but says nothing specific about his wife.  In this play you will meet ""Abby"" in all her glory.  The development of Peter and Abby's faith is a faith builder for all who watch it..",1355529600,2,413,4.243589743589744
7799062,5,1577821955,"This is one of my favorite movies of all times. Its not the quality, or special effects that make this movie incredible. What makes this movie incredible is the accuracy by which the actors portray the hearts and the depth they create in the characters of this movie. This makes the early Church come alive in a real, grabbing, and inspiring way.",1342137600,2,346,4.596774193548387
7799063,3,1577821955,"This musical is a remake of&nbsp;<a data-hook=""product-link-linked"" class=""a-link-normal"" href=""/UpsideDown-1987-Version/dp/1577821971/ref=cm_cr_arp_d_rvw_txt?ie=UTF8"">UpsideDown 1987 Version</a>. In my opinion, it is not nearly as good as the original. Both musicals tell the story of the beginnings of the early Christian church as described in the New Testament book of Acts. But this version moves somewhat away from a straight portrayal of Acts and more into a fictionalized story centered around the apostle Peter's family, and a Roman centurion. It seems they were trying to make it more kid-friendly, by focusing more on children and by making it shorter. But in doing so, some of its heart was lost, as well as the 'epic' quality. The orchestral arrangements seem jarring and overdone. Yes, it is much more polished, and not as obviously amateur... but sometimes ""amateurishness"" is a good thing. However, since I saw the 1987 version first, I could be biased by my enjoyment of that one.",1300060800,3,997,5.565789473684211
