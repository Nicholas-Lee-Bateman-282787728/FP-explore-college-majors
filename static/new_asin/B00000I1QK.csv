7909399,4,B00000I1QK,"This anime series is a great one for anybody that likes action and romance. It is about a boy that falls in love with a divine demon who is the last of her race.  Not to spoil the movie to much, they meet, go on adventures and they are seperated to finally be joined at the end.  It is somewhat based on religon, well just the part of the divine demon and stuff.  It is a great series.",1027468800,,385,3.91025641025641

7909401,3,B00000I1QK,"After watching this series I have concluded that immortality is a curse. Big time. Seeing Yakumo get killed so many times I was wondering how he maintained his sanity for the duration of the series. Whether he's being  hit by a bus, crushed under debris, or shot repeatedly, he emerges  relatively unscathed, but boy, that's gotta hurt!

The overall story  is a typical ""get the artifact before the bad guys"" affair.  Yakumo and Pai spend most of the series fighting off hideous monsters while  Pai continues her quest to become human. The action sequences are pretty  good even though some of the monsters are a little hokey. A few of the  other characters appear to have hidden agendas, but those aren't revealed  during the duration of series.
The characters themselves are somewhat  interesting. It's kind of funny seeing Pai suffering from a  multiple-personality disorder. Usually she's a charming, innocent thing,  dripping sweetness; until she opens her third eye, that is. Then her voice  drops a few octaves, she frowns quite fiercely, and tends to treat poor  Yakumo like dog food. Speaking of Yakumo, I felt a bit sorry for him that  Pai trapped him with his immortal curse. It's kind of funny to see him get  maimed so many times, though. Rounding out the main cast is a martial arts  reporter, Ling-Ling, and Meishing, who develops a crush on Yakumo.
The  art and animation are of typical anime quality. Nothing looks bad, but  nothing stands out, either. The dubbing was pretty average as well.
My  only big complaint is the lackluster ending. The final showdown felt like  the equivalent of missing the Stanley Cup finals and reading about it in  the paper the next day. The resolution is very open-ended, with plenty of  room left for a sequel. I just wish the series actually had more of a grand  finale instead of the rush-job that it had.
Overall, it's mildly  entertaining, worth watching for any action or horror fans. Actually, it's  worth watching just to see Yakumo get repeatedly killed.",957052800,6,2013,4.847058823529411
7909402,5,B00000I1QK,3X3 Eyes Perfect Collection is a quintessential video for any anime library.,953942400,,76,5.416666666666667
7909403,5,B00000I1QK,"oh oh oh! This is a great anime!  It's sad that you cannot buy it here at Amazon now, but hopefully it will be re-released because it is amazing. Any good rental stores should have it for you to rent. The storyline is great,  and the ending is sad. It will have you hooked, leaning off the edge of  your hair, a thin drool strand hanging from the corner of your mouth. You  cannot draw your eyes away from it.
It doesn't matter if this would be  your first anime to watch, or your hundreth, it is still going to be one of  your favorites!",953337600,,538,4.076190476190476
