8439391,5,B004RWUCPK,"It took me more than a decade to find this gem. After I watched this film many years ago, there was a marathon of Miyazaki films (actually studio GHIBLI) I wanted to have this film. Although this film is dubbed in Spanish and it also comes in Japanese with subtitles, I loved it. The DVD came within days after my purchase. I highly recommend this buyer.",1356048000,3,354,4.378787878787879
