366630,4,6301798805,"It's not as cohesive or funny as YOUNG FRANKENSTEIN or THE PRODUCERS, but SILENT MOVIE has plenty to offer.  A wild romp that parodies the film business and the all but lost art of creating silent films, SILENT MOVIE  stars Mel Brooks, Marty Feldman, and Dom Deluise as a trio of film makers  who vow to save their studio by making a new silent film with major stars.  Many conventions of silent films are spoofed, such as how the right title  card can alter the meaning of a scene (the title of this review is from one  such card).  Several stars (such as Burt Reynolds and Paul Newman) seem to  enjoy parodying themselves, and Anne Bancroft's tango with our heroes is a  standout.  Harold Gould is the epitome of blackhearted villany and Sid  Ceaser contributes some of his trademark pantomime as the neurotic studio  chief.  Best of all is Marty Feldman; with his wirey body, elastic face,  and, of course, those eyes, Feldman looks as if he stepped out of 1920's of  Mack Sennett into the 1970's of Mel Brooks.  He steals many a scene (subtly  or otherwise) in SILENT MOVIE.",943401600,24,1078,4.560209424083769

366750,3,6301798805,"It's Hollywood, and the trio of Mel Funn, Marty Eggs and Dom Bell (get it?!) are tootling down the boulevard in Mel's canary yellow roadster. It's the Roaring 20's, and the decadence is passing them by. As a caption tells us (this IS a silent movie), ""Mel Funn, once Hollywood's greatest director, until drinking destroyed his career, is trying to make a comeback.""

They go to Big Picture Studio, ""If it's a big one, it was made here"", to pitch one last film. But Big Picture is in financial straits itself, and is trying to stave off a takeover by the stinky conglomerate appropriately named ""Engulf and Devour"".

How the boys make a film and save the day is the story of ""Silent Movie"". There are sound effects, but no dialogue or voice-overs. There are many gags, including sight gags, such as when the Big Picture Studio's office door has this name plate: ""Current Studio Chief"".

It has guest stars, like a TV show, cameos where well-known actors play themselves: Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Liza Minnelli, Anne Bancroft, Paul Newman, Sid Caesar and my favorite, Marcel Marceau.

This silent movie schtick is fun for a while, but it doesn't hold up for a whole movie. I think I would have appreciated this more if it had been shorter. Otherwise, this 1976 movie feels just like a 70's TV show.

Mel Brooks directed twelve films in all, acting in all but one of them.

Not quite, but almost. The sight gags are, at first, hilarious ... but I have to say that they become predictable. Of course so did Mack Sennet's, so Mel is in good company.

There is a plot of sorts, but it plays a secondary part to the relentless visual gags: blink too many times and you'll miss them.

The jokes are stale and the attempts at slapstick are poor. The guest stars (James Caan, Burt Reynolds, Liza Minelli) are completely wasted in their small cameo roles, and the only effective use Brooks gets is from his gorgeous wife Anne Bancroft who does a dance number that is the only highlight in what is otherwise a flat film.

There are some genuinely funny moments, courtesy of Mel, Marty Feldman, Dom DeLuise, Sid Caesar, Harold Gould & Ron Carey leading the list. Brooks opted for Bernadette Peters as leading lady this time, and she's perfectly cast, looking as if she stepped right out of a silent movie. There are some wonderful slapsticks gags here, often accentuated by Brooks' politically incorrect tone.
Several familiar faces (including Brooks' wife, Anne Bancroft, in a very funny nightclub scene) cross the camera lens (sadly, most of the cast is gone now). The one guest star who steals the show is legendary mime Marcel Marceau, who, ironically, is the only actor who utters a symbolic word: ""NO!"" Brooks has confessed that he had grown up watching silents (his favorite comedian was the great Buster Keaton) & developed a deep love & respect for them. So, it was natural for him to try a silent comedy within a silent film. The results are mixed: Strangely, the lack of sound makes the film seem slower than it really is, in spite of the frenetic slapstick.

(By comparison, the bits with Liza Minnelli and James Caan promise more than they deliver.)

I'm sure this was not a high-priority DVD title for 20th Century-Fox, but nevertheless it would have been nice to have some Extras, aside from a couple of theatrical trailers. A few years after the film's initial release, I saw the ""original"" cut at a Mel Brooks retrospective. This version had scenes that were eventually deleted for the general-release print. While they weren't necessarily great comic sequences, it would have been nice if Fox had included them here as Extras. These scenes included:

*In the screening room sequence, Sid Caesar shows Mel, Marty and Dom the rushes for another production, LOBSTERS IN NEW YORK, which depicts giant lobsters at a fancy restaurant, making their dinner selection from a tank filled with humans.

*A hungry Dom goes into a bakery where he gets a numbered ticket, then has to patiently wait until his number is called, even though there's no one else in the place besides the woman behind the counter (played by Lu Leonard). As the number before his is called, a woman rushes in and purchases the entire stock, leaving Dom to munch on his ticket.

*Mel, Marty and Dom drive by a miniature golf course, where midgets (Billy Barty among them) are playing. Mel observes, ""It takes so little to make them happy.""

*During the climactic car chase, the boys zoom past a Volkswagen with a seemingly dead bear (a hunter's trophy) strapped to the roof. The Volkswagen topples over, and the bear revives and runs down the street with the car now strapped to its back.

367038,5,6301798805,"Silent Movie represents Mel Brooks' successful attempt to lampoon the greed of Hollywood with a comic tribute to the era of silent films when the actors merely had to work on their ""faces."" Silent Movie runs along at a brisk 87 minutes and the action simply never stops. The plot holds your attention and the color remains quite good after all these years.

Mel Brooks plays Mel Funn, a has-been movie director whose career was ruined by drinking. However, he gets an idea that could breathe new life into his career--he wants to make a silent movie. Mel Funn, together with his buddies Marty Feldman playing Marty Eggs and Dom DeLuise as Dom Bell, must seek out a Hollywood studio that will buy into his idea of a silent movie. The threesome goes to see the chief of Big Picture Studios, played so ably by Sid Caesar. Big Picture Studios is in such trouble that they are a sitting duck for a hostile takeover from the huge conglomerate Engulf and Devour. The studio chief finally decides to let them make the picture at Big Picture Studios after Funn, Eggs and Bell promise him that big name stars will appear in the movie. The studio chief hopes that the star quality of the film will compensate for it being a silent movie; that would make badly needed profits so Big Picture Studios can remain in business as an independent studio and reject hostile takeover bids from Engulf and Devour. Thus the studio chief gives the green light to Funn, Eggs and Bell to cast and direct the silent movie.

This is a Mel Brooks picture, so needless to say there is much slapstick and parodies galore. At one point when Mel Brooks is chasing after Paul Newman as they ride in wheelchairs at a hospital, the wheels clash and the sparks fly just as they did in a racing scene from the movie Ben-Hur. In another spoof about how big all the candy portions are at the movies, there's a scene in the movie theater in which Dom DeLuise eats a Hershey's candy bar as big as he is while a couple purchase popcorn in the ""trash can"" size as the employee uses a hose to pour gobs and gobs of melted butter onto the popcorn. I'd tell you more but I don't want to ruin it for you. Trust me; it's funny.

Of course, Engulf and Devour are hungry for profits and their greed leads them to want Big Picture Studios at any price, even if it isn't too profitable. Will Funn, Eggs and Bell be able to complete their movie, get their stars into their picture and save Big Picture Studios from ruination or, worse yet, the menacing conglomerate Engulf and Devour? Will Funn be able to handle the stress of it all without turning back to liquor again to ease his pain? And what about the beautiful young lady Engulf and Devour hire to ruin Funn's chances of making his movie so that they can take over Big Picture Studios once and for all? No spoilers here, folks; you'll have to watch the movie to find out!

The cameos by big name stars are delightfully funny and interesting. Funn, Eggs and Bell go after great stars including Liza Minnelli, James Caan, Paul Newman, Anne Bancroft and Burt Reynolds.

People write that this is not Mel Brooks' best movie and maybe they are right. One thing, though--it holds your attention and the gags ARE funny even if many of them do involve slapstick. It's great to see Sid Caesar again and the acting by everyone is very good.

I recommend this film for fans of Mel Brooks; and people who want a light hearted enjoyable comedy will appreciate this movie. The DVD doesn't come with a lot of extras but Silent Movie stands on its own two feet rather well.",1176508800,15,3560,4.460829493087558

I hadn't seen it since it was out in the theaters, but it had always resonated in my mind as one of those slapstick movies that could have been made back in the days when silent movies were the norm.  Bravo to Mel for making another one of his wonderful parodies.",1176163200,,380,4.053333333333334
367080,4,6301798805,"They stopped making silent movies eons ago -- or as my brother puts it, ""Movies with no talkin'.""

But Mel Brooks revived the genre somewhat with the hilarious ""Silent Movie,"" which spoofs two things: those over-the-top old silents, and the nastiness of the movie industry. Full of slapstick and star cameos, this is Brooks stretching his comedic talents... and nobody can hear it.

Former alcoholic Mel Funn (Brooks) is seeking a comeback, and he pitches a silent movie idea to the president of Big Picture Studios, who unsurprisingly rejects it. But Funn swears he can get some stars to star in the movie. So he and his friends Marty Eggs (Marty Feldman) and Dom Bell (Dom DeLuise) go on a slapstick recruiting drive, relentlessly pursuing Liza Minelli, Burt Reynolds, James Caan, and Anne Bancroft.

But they still have a problem -- the evil Engulf & Devour is planning a takeover of Big Picture Studios, and so they don't want Funn's movie to succeed. So they send sultry nightclub singer Vilma Kaplan (Bernadette Peters) to seduce and distract Funn. Will he fall off the wagon? Will the movie get made?

Since obviously there's no dialogue (except a ""non"" from Marcel Marceau), Mel Brooks has to drop most of his verbal gags in here, in favor of lots of visual ones. Instead, a lot of the comedy comes from that wild, overdramatic acting style that people used before movies had sound. And giant chocolate bars.

So, it's slapstick galore -- pratfalls, wild exaggeration, and crazy reactions to everything. And there's some mockery of the cold-blooded way Hollywood moguls act. Nobody wants Funn's new movie because it's wildly different and risky, much the way ""Silent Movie"" probably was -- and it leaves you wondering just how Brooks recruited all these actors.

And Brooks spoofs other stuff related to movies, such as theatres (note the ""Trash Can Size"" popcorn, with butter poured on by a GAS PUMP). In fact, it doesn't take long for Brooks to cross the line into total craziness, as evidenced by the climactic battle between the good guys and bad guys -- it involves throwing soda pop grenades. Who'd have thunk it?

Brooks, Feldman and DeLuise are all obviously having a great time, playing these relentlessly over-the-top characters, especially when they're doing things like lurching around in suits of armor. And the cameos by various actors are fun, especially Reynolds and Brooks' real-life wife Bancroft.

If comedy had a sound, ""Silent Movie"" would shatter all the windows. While Brooks can't exert his verbal comic skills, he almost makes up for it with all the delicious spoofery of old movies and Hollywood. Non!",1174694400,,2635,4.9457013574660635

The movie's plot is apparent:  three goofball producers try to pitch doing a silent movie to save their studio from a huge conglomerate.  To do so, they have to convince ""big"" stars to sign on, and our boys go about it in a slapstick manner.

Brooks, Dom DeLuise and Marty Feldman are our three heroes and they each bring their own particular comic style to their roles, with Feldman's rolling eyes still pretty funny.  Sid Caesar is the producer; Harold Gould is the bad guy; and Bernadette Peters is the vixenish siren.

I was particularly struck by Marcel Marceau's performance. I can't stand most mime, but the guy appears to be an entertainer first, and a mime second. His ability to move is just amazing.

367117,5,6301798805,"Silent Movie is often called Mel Brooks' worst film - it's certainly not on par with his masterpieces, Blazing Saddles or Young Frankenstein, but keep in mind that it's also his most ambitious work; the concept of the movie - the story of a film director trying to make a silent movie in the 1970's, told itself as a silent movie - is certainly his boldest, and it wasn't easy to make it work, but it's as good as it should and could have been - as only Brooks could have done it. Even though the real Silent Movie was not a surprise hit like its fictional counterpart - in fact, it bombed in the box office, not quite unexpectedly - it's an essential part of the Mel Brooks classic catalog, and deserves much from attention than it got; it's also unbelievably funny.

Mel Brooks, Marty Feldman and Dom Deluis are Silent Movie's stooges, and they play their parts with every bit of love and respect for the classic silent comedies of the 20's and 30's. Like in Young Frankenstein, Mel's intention was first and foremost to revive the genre, but with self parody and self awareness; therefore Silent Movie is mainly slapstick and physical humor, and these three comedians make it work, especially Feldman who in himself proves to be a natural silent film comic born several decades too late. The humor is often as crude and simplistic as those films really were, but it works in this modern context much better than could be expected. The excellent cast also includes Sid Caesar and Bernadette Peters in excellent and hilarious performances, and a series of the biggest stars of the time playing themselves as the actors Mel is scouting for for his movie - Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Liza Minnelli, Anne Bancroft and Paul Newman, each of whom grants an unforgettable scene filled with slapstick and good-natured self parody; the film's most memorable moment, and only spoken word, is granted by pantomime legend Marcel Marceau.

My only complaint for Mr. Brooks is this - as long as he had the balls to make a film as bold as this, one that was almost certainly doomed to be a financial and critical failure, he might as well have gone all the way and made it in black and white - that was, after all, one of Young Frankenstein's most striking features. Other than this, Silent Movie is a very funny movie and an essential to fans of Mel Brooks' early material. It's not his best and it's not perfect, but it's one of a kind.",1129420800,2,2424,4.570114942528735

This leads to guest spots from Burt Reynolds, James Caan, Liza Minelli, Anne Bancroft , Marcel Marceau, and Paul Newman. Some of these work better than others and that holds true for all the bits in this movie. I thought the sketch with James Caan was overlong and not very funny, but the shower scene with Burt Reynolds was very funny. My favorite scene was the three of them dressed in suits of armor trying to get close to Liza Minelli in the studio commissary. The scene is the three of them trying to sit down at a lunch table while wearing full armor and I laughed so hard my stomach hurt.

367120,4,6301798805,"The audacious idea of making a silent film in 1976 was a brilliant one, and Mel Brooks milks it for all it is worth in this hilarious winner. The film features mood music and sound effects but no audible dialogue, except for what we read on the screen (just like in an old Chaplin Movie.) In choosing the silent style, Brooks reminds us how good and funny visual gags can be, and how many guffaws we can get from pure slapstick. And yet, the film is shot in modern times in color, so it is not merely an homage to old silent films but also a version of what one might look like in later times. The silly plot involves Brooks and his two associates, Dom Deluise and Marty Feldman (whose face, body, and attire are wonderfully suited for silent comedy), trying to save Sid Caesar's movie studio from a hostile takeover by making a silent movie crammed full of as many Hollywood stars they can find. To this end, they don various outlandish costumes and get themselves into all kinds of silly situations in order to get to the stars. Along the way, they throw in a number of irrelevant gags that are just there for the hell of it. Many are laugh-out-loud funny. Others less so, but even those grow on me with hindsight. The overall effect is pure Brooks, with sharp edges but a sweet, old-fashioned story at its core. Perhaps Brooks relied a little too much on ""lines"" that we have to read off the screen, where he might have left the sight gags to speak for themselves, but for the most part his use of lines that we read in quotation marks is masterful and funny. (Bernadette Peters begins her corny stage shows by shouting ""Babaloooooo!"" which is duly noted in type on the screen.)

It does have a great cast cast; Marty Feldman (Marty Eggs), Dom DeLuise (Dom Bell), Bernadette Peters (Vilma Kaplan), Sid Caesar (Studio Chief), Harold Gould (Engulf) Ron Carey (Devour) and cameos by Burt Reynolds, Paul Newman, Anne Bancroft (It's no suprise to find her in this movie, since she is after all Brooks' wife.)

For those who don't know, this movie is about a once great director (Brooks) who was ruined due to drinking. After some time away from movies he tries to make a comeback.

Caesar won't hear of making a silent movie, even though his studio needs all the help in can get before a conglomerate ""Engulf & Devour"" (who's tagline is ""our hands are in everything"") buys the studio. After Brooks suggest what if he gets big stars to act in the film, the studio chief soon realizes that with big stars, the film could make big money, and so he agrees to let Brooks make his film.

Hot Toasty Rag, July 10, 2017

Hollywood loves to make movies about itself. Audiences love to watch them; it makes them think they're all secretly true stories. In Silent Movie, Mel Brooks plays a has-been director desperate for another hit. He pitches the idea of creating a silent film to his studio, and once given the green light, he has to recruit movie stars to act in it.

The entire movie (except for one spoken word) is silent, but the gags get old fast. It really isn't Mel Brooks's finest hour. I was so bored I kept fast-forwarding sections of the film. This is one of those Hollywood movies that seem like it actually happened. When Mel Brooks has a hard time getting studio approval and actor interest in his film, it feels painfully realistic. The only bright spots are the actors who play themselves in cameo roles: Paul Newman, Burt Reynolds, Liza Minnelli, James Caan, Marcel Marceau, and of course, Anne Bancroft.",1499644800,,955,4.712574850299402
