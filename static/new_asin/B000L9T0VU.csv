8160416,1,B000L9T0VU,"If you're interested in watching a bunch of airheaded Canadians get drunk and smoke cigs while ""soaking up"" some superficial Berlin ""culture"", this DVD is for you.  Otherwise, stay away, far away...",1417219200,,198,5.1875
8160417,1,B000L9T0VU,They're more about logging a camp-like experience of a bunch of early 20 somethings as they party across cities rather than any kind of real travel video. It's hard to glean any information you could use on your own trip as they're centered on describing specific people or situations they ran into and talking about how members of their own group 'scored with the ladies' and other BS like that.,1360454400,2,396,4.671428571428572
8160418,5,B000L9T0VU,"Alcohol is less of a big deal in Europe than in the U.S. Anyone who has been on both sides of ""The Pond"" knows this. If that's an issue for your family/classroom then you/they are likely going to be offended or tire of the frequent cafe/bar scenes. (Side bar: they don't abuse it like Americans. They can walk away from half-full wine glasses and beer bottles.) Europeans seem to drink beer or wine everywhere and all the time. Here is my point: wine and beer are everywhere on this DVD because it accurately reflects the everywhere-presence of alcohol in Europe. If that bothers you then don't get this DVD. That issue aside, this is an EXCELLENT video tour of a great city.",1333152000,,675,4.540983606557377
