1815864,5,B00007JMF3,"The same brilliant cast and beautiful scenery combine to make visiting Avonlea a delightful escape. It is 1914 and WWI is raging on in Europe... in Avonlea everyone is preparing for the Christmas holiday when word arrives that Felix King is MIA. The indomitable Aunt Hetty has a health crisis which brings the family closer together. Felicity does much soul searching and finally decides on a new career path. Unfortunately there was no Gus Pike or Sara Stanley in this movie but overall the other regulars including Rachel Lynde (""thats what"")keep the story interesting and moving right along. This should be added to your holiday viewing schedule each and every year.",1108598400,34,669,5.036036036036036

1815866,5,B00007JMF3,"Note:  This DVD is the same movie as the earlier released ""Happy Christmas, Miss King"".
I really enjoyed this movie.  From what I remember, it was filmed and released after the Road to Avonlea series had finished filming its 7 seasons.  The movie stays true to the Avonlea characters and scenery.
For one of the reasons that Kevin Sullivan stopped the filming of the charming RTA series... the Christmas movie shows the time of war.  The boys of Avonlea (including Felix King) go to war and all the innocence of Avonlea is temporarily lost.
However, this is a Christmas movie, and 'The Road to Avonalea Christmas' depicts the Christmas theme with all the charm and detail that the Road to Avonlea series has brought us.
I would definitely add this DVD to your personal or child's collection.",1041292800,5,791,4.751824817518248

This is my introduction to the world of Avonlea on Prince Edward Island.  I saw part of this program on television (entitled there as ""Happy Christmas, Miss King"") and was taken by the setting and the tartar, Miss King.  Just got around to viewing it today and loved it.  Of course, I had no background of the players from the series, but a look at Wikipedia and a second viewing caught things up sufficiently for a unique Christmas special.  I really liked the King family, enjoying Hettie even before her softening, when ""life's vicissitudes"" (one of her phrases) came her way.  Rachel was listed as a town gossip and sometimes friend/sometimes enemy of Hettie, but she was very pleasing here as the housemate.  It's a winner for the setting, full round of interesting characters and their interplay.  Another welcome and charming old-fashioned Christmas movie.",1355616000,4,1302,5.132701421800948

1816087,4,B00007JMF3,I finally saw this  last night and what struck me was a similarity in some ways  with this film and a old film with Jennifer Jones called Good Morning Miss Dove  a devoted teacher  bought gifts for her students every year  nurse in hospital was a former student and the story of the gift the girl remembers and both Hetty and Miss Dove told the little girls to wash first.  The sudden need for surgery  Very much  reminds me of that old movie. Other parts of the movie where more original I thought the parts with Janet and Alex King missing the boy where good.  I was also shocked about not mentioning Sarah  even perhaps a christmas card from her. Would have like to see Gus and Jasper.  Enjoy the actress that plays Hetty  she was always great.,1322438400,,747,4.333333333333333

1816090,4,B00007JMF3,"""An Avonlea Christmas"", also known as ""Happy Christmas Miss King"" reunites some of the beloved cast members from the Road to Avonlea series, Road to Avonlea: The Complete First Season through Road to Avonlea: The Complete Seventh Volume. Unfortunately, many of the familiar cast members are missing from this stand-alone episode - Jasper Dale, Olivia's husband was not featured; Gus Pike (Felicity King's husband) is in Halifax; the Pettibone's are not in it; and, Felix King only appears in several short scenes on account of being away at war.

I was quite disappointed that the producers decided to focus on the First World War and how it affected the inhabitants of Avonlea. Though this may be historically accurate, I wanted to see a light-hearted episode of one of my favorite family shows. Instead, the tone is dark from the very beginning when we see Felix King in a battle scene. The mood in Avonlea is also low-spirited - many inhabitants have sent their young men off to fight in the war thousands of miles away, including Alec and Janet King, and though the planning for the Christmas festivities continue as usual, some obviously do not have their hearts in it. Janet misses her son; Olivia stews over Jasper's absence; and Felicity King ponders her uncertain future when the foundling house she started with Gus Pike is closed down.

Hetty King, the stalwart of tradition, continues as though nothing is amiss. She oversees the Avonlea concert for Christmas, and gets into a bitter argument with both Olivia (for constantly criticizing Jasper) and Janet (for not showing more compassion over Felix's MIA status). When Hetty is diagnosed with a possible life-threatening condition, she gets plenty of time to reflect upon her own actions.

Though this was not the best effort in the RTA series, I am just glad they made a reunion movie of sorts (the series proper ended in 1996, and this was released in 1998). I just wish the tone had been more light-hearted and not quite so dark and bleak.",1289779200,2,2005,4.873900293255132

It was the missing piece for me.  Before I purchased it, I read a review that stated that Gus was not in this movie.  I was disappointed but since I was expecting that Gus would not be there I was able to enjoy the movie with what characters were there.
I had always wanted to buy the ""Road to Avonlea"" series since I was 14 years old and so here I am 15 years later finally buying the series to find out what happened.  I had watched the first three series on the Disney channel and I always wanted to find out how the romance between Gus and Felicity turned out so the end of the seventh series left me wanting to hear more about Gus and Felicity's life together which I did find out a bit more about in this movie.  It gave closure to the series.

Pretty much everyone else is here...celebrating Christmas, visiting Hetty in the hospital, debating the merits of war (Felix is off fighting in World War I for much of the movie) and continuing their lives from the series.  It's very well done...they even ramped up the budget a little bit for a couple of war scenes, which was somewhat unexpected.

It is a war story taking place on the home front as boys head to war, and only some return.  It has a Scroogie old lady school teacher, who learns at Christmas time that love of family is available and worthwhile. There are other individual struggles but as in all good ""G"" rated stories, all's well that ends well.

1816131,2,B00007JMF3,"""Avonlea Christmas"" is missing the wonderful charm of seasons 1-6 of ""Road to Avonlea"".

I highly recommend seasons 1-5 of ""Road to Avonlea"", season-6 is good, but does not reach the heights of the earlier seasons. The episodes are written by different writers. The focus of the ""Avonlea Christmas"" episode, is one dispute to the next, rather than predicaments for the characters to display their personalities, and their ultimate warmth. The little kids are grown, so the same arguments are no longer cute. This episode-writer was unfamiliar with the true personalities of the characters previously established in the mind of the audience. My favorite episode writers of the early seasons of ""Avonlea"", Heather Conkie, Suzette Couture, and Hart Hanson, who set a high standard for the series, did not write ""Avonlea Christmas"".

Has the same technical proficiency in costumes, lighting, and good morals; but something is missing. It is not the same. Likewise, the first two ""Anne of Green Gables"" movies were great, (with the script lifted from the books) but the third Anne movie, during World-War-I, was unsatisfying, as here, written by a different writer, taking us to a place we did not wish to go, with characters we do not know.

If you do not expect to continue ""Road to Avonlea"", and do not mind more conflict, then you may enjoy this. Will be as good as anything on TV, but with characters who are not their old selves.

Another good period series is ""Christy the Complete Series"".",1183852800,,1492,4.956

I highly recommend seasons 1-5 of ""Road to Avonlea"". Season-6 is good, but does not reach the heights of seasons 1-5. I have not seen season-7. The episodes are written by different writers. The focus of the ""Avonlea Christmas"" episode, is one dispute to the next, rather than predicaments for the characters to display their personalities, and their ultimate warmth. The little kids are grown, so the same arguments are no longer cute. This episode-writer was unfamiliar with the true personalities of the characters previously established in the mind of the audience.

The producer's interest is visually appealing shots, beautiful countryside, beautiful homes, beautiful people in beautiful costumes, all which adds a lot to the films. He was lucky to have brilliant script-writers in seasons 1-5. He changed script-writers into season-6, and the quality of the scripts plummeted downward. His interest and strength in visual cinematography, has a huge blind-spot, weakness for appraising good, script-writing. His film, ""By Way of the Stars"", is the best example of pretty pictures with a terrible script. The producer, by his experience, can shoot great visual shots in his sleep, and should focus all his effort on learning about the elements of a good script, and what made many of his great scripts in seasons 1-5 great. Under the comment button, I list many of the reasons past great scripts were great.

1816133,2,B00007JMF3,"Can someone answer a question?  I finished all 6 seasons of ""Road to Avonlea"", but the series didn't end there.  Season 6 ends with Gus Pike being lost at sea, but there was another episode where Felicity almost married Seth Pritchard and Gus returned and finally married Felicity.  Where is it?  Was there a 7th season or is it in something else?  This is driving me crazy. Even Sara Stanley comes back in the final episode.  Is there a season 7?",1169510400,,447,4.45679012345679

When Road to Avonlea series aired on Australian TV in the 90's. I again loved watching the program. When I found out that the series was now on DVD. I purchased all the seasons.
I found Avonlea Christmas on Amazon at a very good price $9.99. I puchased it without a second thought.
I found the movie very enjoyable to watch. It is a clean family friendly movie with family values.
These days it is hard to find a movie that can actually be called a family movie.
I would recommend this DVD to anyone who loved watching Anne of Green Gables.",1166054400,26,621,4.271186440677966
