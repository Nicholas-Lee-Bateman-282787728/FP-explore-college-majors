3042531,5,B000ZKQUZE,Awesome product and i Was very pleased with the condition and the arrival of this product. I didn't expect to get it when I did!,1363910400,,128,4.16
3042532,5,B000ZKQUZE,"The next generation should love these as well as the last. Really adorable videos, calm and sweet, done in the same visual and artistic style as Potter's books.",1356480000,,160,4.75
3042533,5,B000ZKQUZE,I watched these stories before giving them to my grandson and we both loved watching them again and again.  In my opinion they are charming stories!,1350345600,5,148,4.6923076923076925
3042534,5,B000ZKQUZE,"This is but one of three DVDs in the The Beatrix Potter Collection, and I would certainly recommend getting the complete set (for a few dollars more). This DVD contains three tales by Beatrix Potter:

The Tale of Pigling Bland - Pigling Bland loses his way and ends up at a sly farmer's house. He meets Pig-wig, a cute little black pig with a sweet voice, and helps her escape the evil farmer's clutches.

The Tale of Samuel Whiskers or The Roly-Poly Pudding -one of my seven-year-old's favorite Potter stories. The naughty little Tom Kitten escapes his mom, but ends up in the attic where he falls prey to the wicked rat couple who intend to eat him. Will Tom Kitten make it out alive? There's plenty of suspense but never too scary for little ones.

The Tailor of Gloucester - this story reminded my daughter and I of The Elves and the Shoemaker. A tailor is working on a fine coat for the Mayor, but when he is taken ill, he fears the work will never be completed on time. Luckily for the tailor, some very hardworking mice come to the rescue!

The entire DVD runs 77 minutes, the aspect ratio is 4:3, is in color, and there are English subtitles for the hearing impaired.",1336003200,14,1175,4.425925925925926
3042535,5,B000ZKQUZE,"Children as young as 18 months are captivated by Beatrix Potter's soft drawings and beautiful voices in this fine interpretation of the original stories. I have to add a warning that my own daughter as a two year old mimicked the destruction seen in Two Bad Mice, lol.  Children as old as 100 (yes, one hundred!) should be impressed by this production of living literature.  As a teacher of many years, I have found students of all ages to delight in these stories as presented in the dvd format of The World of Peter Rabbit and Friends.  C.S. Lewis himself became enchanted with Squirrel Nutkin (unfortunately not in this series)about age 9, being born around the turn of the 20th century near the time of the books' publication.  He loved Miss Potter and her books and began creating his own ""worlds"" as a result of reading Miss Potter.  Although I almost never encourage anyone to watch a dvd instead of reading the book (and I do heartily recommend reading the books), this series is magical and not to be missed. My own children are in their teens and remember this dvd series as being a wonderful part of their store of childhood treasured memories. Enjoy!",1274918400,9,1162,4.648780487804878

Her Last Tutor Was Only Three Years Older Than Potter. ) She Begins To Infuse Tea And Dip Her Pen Into A Nice Inkwell, Then Comes The Episodes. . . Each One Brings Potter's Stories To Life. So Splendidly Done ! At The Ending Of Each Episode, Potter Finishes The Story, And Proceeds To Post It Herself Or Handing It To One Of The Children.

8235820,5,B000ZKQUZE,"This has beautiful music, drawings/art, and I can see why other people have written reviews that say they fondly remember watching these shows back in childhood.  I don't know if the other Peter Rabbit/Beatrix Potter movies are as awesome as the BBC one, so I can only comment on this BBC (British Broad Casting) Beatrix Potter movie.",1411344000,,334,4.859649122807017
8235821,5,B000ZKQUZE,"These cartoons are okay.  I do like to watch them, but I have to be in exactly the right mood to enjoy them.  Still, she loves them and she appreciated me getting them for her, so for her sake I give this five stars.",1386720000,,216,3.8863636363636362
8235822,5,B000ZKQUZE,Pigling Bland is one of my favorite cartoons of all time.  My parents recorded it on VHS for me when I was little but that has long since gone missing.  (I believe we lent it out and it was never returned.)  Thank goodness I have been able to add them back into my collection.,1381881600,,276,4.074074074074074
8235823,5,B000ZKQUZE,These tales are faithful to the original texts and illustration style. These are so much better than the later animated series. My son loves them!,1372377600,,146,4.88

8235825,5,B000ZKQUZE,"This DVD is an excellent quality one by the BBC. Beatrix Potter stories on the video are beautifully done. We had another one in this series and our 2 year old grandson loved it so much I investigated buying another if available. A friend told me there were others so I ordered this one. He adores it too and I never get tired of watching it with him!! The live action scenes are gorgeous, animation wonderful and narration perfection. We love these DVD's!!!",1365033600,,458,4.530120481927711
