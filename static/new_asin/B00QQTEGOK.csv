6877453,3,B00QQTEGOK,"Like anything Rory Miller has published up until this point, the Scaling Force DVD provides excellent material to anyone looking to better understand the world of personal defense. The DVD, however, is not nearly as thorough as the book. The sections on Presence and Voice are almost non-existent and the other levels of force are far briefer in the DVD than they are in the book.

I was looking forward to seeing some interaction between Miller and coauthor Lawrence Kane, but unfortunately, Kane was only present in cut in segments of the DVD, so the two authors never got to talk together on camera.

If you are looking to really grasp Miller and Kanes Scaling Force concept, read the book first, and supplement with the DVD.",1426896000,3,728,4.76984126984127
6877454,5,B00QQTEGOK,"Scaling Force is an excellent complement to Rory Miller's previous books and DVDs regarding self-defense and use of force, i.e., Facing Violence and Joint Locks. Miller is a former law enforcement officer who has vast experience in dealing with violence and knows whereof he speaks.

Miller and his colleagues demonstrate and explain various situations in where force may have to be utilized or avoided. They show how to extricate yourself from what could become a dangerous or perhaps a fatal outcome without losing face. Defusing a situation, it is explained, is the best way to avoid needless confrontation.

Miller explains when your own use of force, whether in self- defense or protection of others, can go too far and make you the villain. He shows you just how far you can go in a combative situation. It is explained just how much force can be used to save yourself from harm or legal problems, even though you may have been the initial victim in the scenario.

They demonstrate various methods that are used in particular scenes such as: use of your own presence, physically or mentally; use of your voice; touch; empty hand restraint and when lethal force may have to be used. Miller explains that each step must be used at the appropriate level and the why behind these steps.

Miller stresses that avoidance is the most important and logical action in most situations.

All in all, this is a very interesting and again a very informative DVD, as are his previous works in the same field.",1424736000,5,1500,4.7984496124031
6877455,5,B00QQTEGOK,"This an excellent DVD for the money, very informative and an excellent ""hand in hand"" for the book ""Scaling Force"".

The often-neglected subject of this DVD  is assessing and dealing with the realities of the different levels of violent situations we may encounter in the real world. The authors have put together much of the essential information found in the book, edited down of course, in an easily accessible format.  This they do by dealing with the issue at the different levels at which the viewer may encounter them (and different levels of response), from when someone sees the potential for a fight, through the onset of a fight, to the reality of finding yourself in a fight. This is done mostly in a mix of  classroom and workshop style walk-throughs. Hands-on examples of the key technical points they are teaching are shown.

This tutorial does not stop there, but attempts to rationally cover the factors one should consider (social, moral, and legal) when making the decision to defend yourself. Violent action in any civilized part of the world does not begin with the first blow nor end with the last one - and this DVD touches on the details leading up to, during, and continuing into the aftermath, of a violent encounter. Awareness, common sense, and rationalizing/mastering ones natural reactions when under stress are discussed and principals applied with an eye to real life practicality. This DVD is not about how to throw a punch - it is also about when, and even if, to throw a punch.

Obviously, I am very impressed with this tutorial, as I was with the book. If I presumed to re-title this DVD for the authors, I might call it ""WHERE THE DOJO USUALLY LEAVES OFF"", as few of the many gyms and dojos that I have trained at or visited over the last forty years went into any real depth on what is contained in this DVD.

Both the DVD and the book are worth having for anyone who wants to be safer on the street.
I recommend getting them both.",1424131200,5,1969,4.624641833810888
6877456,5,B00QQTEGOK,"How do you deal with a hostile set of circumstances? Do you go full-bore when someone starts pushing you and calling your mother names? Do you try to soft touch someone who has pulled out a big-honking bowie knife and is holding it at your gut? How do you know when violent self-defense is proper or not, and deadly force is or isn't justified? Rory Miller and Lawrence A. Kane, both seasoned in violent confrontations from a law enforcement and security environment, have brought out a 120-minute DVD that approaches this subject in a thoughtful, experienced, and attention-getting way.

The format of the Scaling Force DVD is very simple. Miller and Kane walk the viewer through each of the 6 levels of force, giving demonstrations, stories from their own experiences and explanations that are clear and easily grasped. The exhibitions support the didactic matter, reinforcing each point, exposing vulnerabilities and displaying the strengths of better approaches. There is even a segment on how to survive a crowd attack that was simple and skillful. The final minutes of the DVD hammer out the importance of articulating why one used force level 5 and 6 and the subjects that must be expressed clearly to help keep ones self out of lawsuits or jail.

One of the strengths I appreciate about the Scaling Force DVD is that the intention of the presenters is not to get into a fight, all macho and mad-hatter, but how to avoid becoming a victim or evade the misstep of going from the assaulted to the assailant. Miller and Kane work hard to help the viewer make sane decisions in dangerous situations. One of the potential downsides to the DVD happens to be the profuse profanity. If that doesnt bother you, or you can filter through it, then the DVD will prove an invaluable addition to your library.

The Scaling Force DVD is a great stand-alone media, or a supporting addition to the book that goes by the same title. The DVD will keep your attention, and get you thinking through scenarios you could easily find yourself in. This electronic instruction material would be useful for viewing in a martial arts school, or as supplemental information for a self-defense class. I highly recommend this DVD.

Thanks to YMAA for a copy of the DVD used for this review.",1424044800,6,2266,4.802564102564102
6877457,5,B00QQTEGOK,"A great DVD that serves as a wonderful companion to the book of the same name.  When in a dangerous situation with treat of violence, the person needs to clearly examine and rationalize the true level of threat, and to react with the appropriate level of response...all in a matter of seconds.  This DVD along with the book offers excellent guidance on how to do both.  I highly recommend either this DVD - or both the DVD and book!",1423440000,2,432,4.443037974683544
6877458,5,B00QQTEGOK,"This is a video seminar from professionals in the corrections and protection business.
They are experienced in dealing with real world violence, armed & unarmed, and are experienced in teaching others how to deal with it.

They cover a series of important topics that are rarely or never reviewed in martial arts classes.

Most martial arts classes cover fighting techniques, skills and physical conditioning.
But they don't discuss real life situations that involve danger.

This DVD has practical information on how to identify and deal with dangerous situations.
Very interesting.
The DVD states that their theme is: ""Use too much force and you are going to jail. Use too little force and you will be hurt"".

They cover how to evaluate situations and determine how much force you used and then to be able to explain and justify what you did so that you don't get prosecuted for assault.

8692332,5,B00QQTEGOK,Dealing with extreme violence is something that the average individual would rather not have to do but if there is no avoiding it one does not want to go to jail or get sued but mostly one does not want to go to the hospital. Rory Miller conveys a lot of useful information in all of his videos. I wanted to brush up on striking techniques and didn't really know who to go to so I let Rory pick the instructor in their video Attack the Attack and that also contains a lot of good information as well as his videos Improvised Jointlocks and Infighting.,1504224000,,551,4.257142857142857

8692334,1,B00QQTEGOK,"At first this dvd makes sense, but then I began to realize what a joke it is. The instructors are all out of shape and the guy talking says how they're not actors so it won't seem as realistic (understabdibly so..for the physical motions, that is). This dvd is spoken in generalities that are very persuasive in nature, so that you almost think they are real. For example, you'll hear tense music in parts, then it cut scene to a loud background of a bearded guy claiming ""One time I got in a fight (a deadly one) or one time this guy pulled a knife on me."" In other words, there is absolutely NO PROOF to what they are saying and that it's even true!!! Like a car salesmen, always agreeing with you after the fact. You buy this dvd, and after a persuasive story of the instructors emphasizing with your needs and how they know ""a buddy who goes through this like you might at home"". One way or another, you find out this is still a lemon of a purchase. Like kids too. ""One time! Godzilla came to my room and I used Karate to fight it off!"" All tall tales, with no video to support anything on this dvd!!! They say it's in Washington. They quote some laws to support their premise. How does the purchaser know where the heck they even really are for this? Take their word for it? How does this help me as I'm not experienced. Well, it didn't and was a joke.

The levels of violence, de-escalation, Level 1-6 make sense, but your basic mental health hospital, social services, or social work job teaches the same thing he calls an ""art of scaling"". More commonly known in ANY JOB as CRISIS Intervention. These instructors say ""lethal force"" is your last option and go into more tangents about people who have used lethal force and how it changes your life fully. This would be a no brainer. Does a soldier (who they reference) in combat not already realize the life altering change? Pointing out the obvious again.

Yes, of course killing someone with lethal force, even if legally found in the right (in self defense) will mess you up pretty bad. The funny thing is the instructor says he's an experienced ""in fighter"" or ""in-line fighter"" and yet can hardly exhale at times, trying to catch his breath. The people on this dvd say they are current police officers. There's no way. One looks like a biker from the boonies with half a Zztop beard already grown

There's a lady that says she's a doctor, one is apparently ""bouncing"" (a bouncer) and the others are apparently experts in their craft, but act more like beginners when they ask frequently how to do the moves. They'll say ""Is it like this?"" Or, ""In this stance?"" This is just an attempt to put his book on video (just added him visually on a stage). No different than people used to put books to tape years ago. Story telling, power of persuasion, and a vivid imagination. Cuz you're gonna need one when you wonder how this has so many 5-star reviews! It seemingly keeps getting them and I will also mention, the other dvd ""in fighting"" where he's got a cool move totally kicking a** on the cover, is even worse.

Look for Kelly McCann's ""The Crucible"" Combatives Vol. 1-3 set (he's a.k.a. Jim Grover). More expensive, but you get what you pay for.  Kelly Mccann will show you full contact fighting, how to use his moves on your dummy, and even tells you never give your wallet and keys during a car hold up while shopping in parking lots, etc. Cuz the person came for violence first, keys and wallet last. Why would you roll over and say ""okay **throw keys and wallet now** here's my keys and wallet"". Cuz then they'd say, NOW GET IN the car. It could be a car jacking. Or, they just shoot you and take all three just cuz you tossed them down and get away.

In Scaling Force, supposed cops, says hand over your goods to the bad guy. Unless, it's unanimously agreed on that in a liquor store or bank robbery, you just cut your losses and sit, stand, listen, or run. Not ""hold them and detain someone at a bar."" That's why I like Jim Grover's videos better and recommend them over this, which is pretending and pantomiming.",1448409600,2,4082,4.42154255319149
8692335,5,B00QQTEGOK,"Scaling Force DVD provides a tangible, well-thought out blueprint of the use and counter use of force options within the context of human conflict. This blueprint follows closely other force-continuum paradigms found in US and Canadian federal law enforcement force-continuum models. The bottom line for using any force-continuum model remains in assisting lawful operators, who find themselves addressing conflicting behaviors, for selecting the appropriate amount of force needed to counter the force being expressed from adversarial personnel.

Over the last decade there has been much argument within law enforcement bureaus about the actual utility with implementing force-continuum operational models. The conclusion has been, which is accurately addressed within this instructionally-rich, DVD presentation, that force-continuum models provide operators with a useful template of how to respond to conflict with appropriate levels of force. Without such well-learned templates, operators are more likely to under-react or over-react to force presentations. This is not an option for lawful response to offered violence or the potential for offered violence.

A very key component of the force-continuum is covered, reliably within this video. This is how the continuum is not always a linear progression, but often a returning spiral of activity and discourse. An event can escalate from zero to 100mph in the blink of an eye, depending on the suspects behaviors and goals. Since no human can read the mind of another, our only option becomes engaging situation awareness, which Miller and Kane clearly define the importance thereof.

The force continuum Miller and Kane present involves a progression of how our presence, first of all, can off-set or escalate violence. The next level is how the use of verbal de-escalation works well to prevent things from going nuclear. Then they show how simple touch can rearrange human cognition and violent motives brewing. Moving on the 4th level of force management, they demonstrate key physical manipulations that mechanically control a subject, which demands complete control over head and hips for total control of the suspect. The next level (5th) involves showing clearly less-than-lethal applications needed to incapacitate subjects, minimizing serious injury to the subject, but who have not yet escalated into lethal force options. And finally, they address lethal force issues, and what is required to stop the threat when the threat offers lethal force. Appropriately, all of the consequences from all six levels of force used are covered in detail.

Overall, the video was a comprehensive menu of force options running through the full spectrum of human behavior within a conflicting context. I do believe this DVD is a great complement with Millers other, more recent DVD INFighting, also by YMAA. Used together, one can fabricate a unique blend of applicable force-option cognitive and behavioral selections that transcend mere self-defense classes.
I recommend this video, as it more clearly hones expectations more accurately, and more conducive to human violent outcomes. Good job.

8692336,3,B00QQTEGOK,"Scaling Force DVD: Dynamic decision-making under threat of violence, YMAA, `120 minutes.

Roy Miller has created five DVDs, all of which Ive seen, and written several books, of which Ive read four. Ive been very impressed with all his work so far, and even went so far as to attend two of his seminars. I was also quite pleased and impressed with both him and the material presented. Having said that of all his DVDs this is the only one I would not give five stars. Is it bad? No, its well worth watching. I think anyone who watches it will get something from it. But is it great, as great as his other materials? I don't think so. As for Lawrence Kane, Ive read two books him as well and thought they were good too and look forward to reading others. Both men are good writers and martial artists with a firm grounding in self-defense and an ability to analyze and communicate well.
However, like another reviewer at Amazon, I strongly recommend that someone interested in the subject should first read Miller and Kanes book Scaling Force before watching this video. Thats where most of the real factual content can be learned. But having said that, I don't wish to condemn this DVD entirely. It does supplement the book and provides new examples and perspectives on the lessons taught, although I question if a person could get a good, well rounded grasp on the material by watching this DVD alone.  To a large extent, I felt that in this DVD they got away from the focus of the book, and  taught about a wide variety of self defense, crime avoidance, and awareness related subjects instead.
The basic presentation style, in my opinion, was not chosen to fit the content of the book and the lessons the authors wanted to teach, but instead they went with the approach Miller used in his four other DVDs. Miller is in a room with several other people. In this room with these people, he lectures, tells stories, discusses, demonstrates, and answers questions. Periodically, this is interrupted by Lawrence Kane, who was not able to be present giving lectures and telling stories on his own to give his own spin on the materials. Now anyone whos met Rory Miller probably believes like I do that if he were to talk about grocery shopping on a school bus, just to give an absurd example, youd learn a great deal of valuable stuff.  So its not like this is devoid of content. On the other hand, it would have been nice if they had supplemented this with charts, diagrams, computer graphics, and other sorts of visuals to illustrate the lessons and clarify points.
The basic idea of the book and DVD is that when one is faced with violence or the threat of violence one needs to respond in an appropriate way with an appropriate degree of force. In the book and DVD, Kane and Miller divide potential responses into six different levels.
The first of these is presence. Often a situation can be defused or avoided merely by ones presence, particularly if the potential assailant is being observed.  Miller gives an example of someone who caused a suspicious car to leave the neighborhood simply by photographing its license plate and letting the person inside see that this was being done.
The second level of response is voice. Many situations can, indeed, by defused through talking. Talking of course, does not include just negotiation but also talking down emotional distraught people, letting potential assailants know you're aware of their intent, or even tricking people.
It was this part where I was most disappointed in the DVD, largely because this section of the book is so amazingly good. I would recommend without hesitation that any EMT or emergency responder interested in improving their emergency communication and crisis intervention skills read this section of the book. Unfortunately, I do not think they would get the same benefits from this DVD. One reason for this is, ironically, Millers professionalism and desire to produce quality materials. He states in the DVD that although he and others of the people present are skilled and experienced in talking emotionally distraught people down, they chose not to demonstrate this in detail in the DVD because they are not good actors and would not show it well.
The third level is touch. In many cases, a situation can be defused when the right person places a hand on someone in the right way. Examples are shown.
The fourth level is the use of restraining and other hand to hand techniques.  This is, of course, the point where  most martial arts and self defense training begins.
Although the book speaks of level five,  less lethal force, and six, lethal force, as separate entities in the DVD they are combined.  It is explained that the reason for combining the two is because in a real conflict situation a person will react automatically with a mixture of instinct and training and not be able to distinguish clearly between the two levels of force.
This is just one more example of the differences between the book and the DVD.  In the DVD, there is an assumption that the audience is ordinary people, citizens who do not normally respond to violence, and not people who face it regularly such as emergency service personnel or large event security people. It also one example of how the DVD is much less organized than the book. (Some will respond that violence is inherently disorganized. One of the things that I love about Millers work, however, is that he is able to see the patterns in it.)
In conclusion, theres much in the DVD thats worth paying attention to. Theres a lot of good material on how to avoid violence and increase ones awareness of dangerous situations. Miller and Kane know their stuff. On the other hand, for those expecting a video organization that tightly follows the format of the book, they are likely to find this disappointing.",1434672000,2,5833,4.7379310344827585

8692338,5,B00QQTEGOK,"We have all heard of Six degrees of Separation, this DVD will open your eyes to Six Levels of Dealing with Violence.  Presence, Voice, Touch, Empty-Hand Restraint, Less-Lethal Force, Lethal Force. You street and case fighters out there may opt of Less-Lethal Force (Level 5) right off the get go. Those of you who have never been exposed to any sort of violence and have lived a calm, serene life may opt for Voice and Touch (Level 2 and Level 3) as a natural first reaction. Maybe soldiers with PTS or life long criminals just released from prison might hop to Level 6, Lethal Force if they feel their life is threatened. A college co-ed being approached in the bleachers may back off unwanted attention with Level 1, Presence and using body language, but that same girl, dragged into any empty elevator or laundry room might employ Level 4 , and use threat through pain or forcing compliance through leverage, perhaps some chin-na that she learned in kung fu class or a self defense workshop.

There are many levels of crazies out there, from the drunk, the mentally unstable, the temporarily angered or enraged person seeking revenge or restitution, all the way up to international terrorists.

We never know what we are going to run into once we step out of our door, or for that matter, if we stay behind locked doors and are subject to home invasion or car jacking. We also may be able to handle ourselves through years of intense training, either martial, military or police backgrounds, but can we handle the worldwide judgments that are sure to follow any decision we might make. Pick the wrong level and hurt someone unnecessarily, chances are it is filmed on cell phones, surveillance cameras and uploaded and made viral on the net within seconds. Pick a level that is too low and you may be the viral victim being flashed on every news feed 24/7, even before your family and friends are notified. Just yesterday a friend of mine posted a photo of a person who was pushed off a platform on local rail road. The victim was being carried by EMS teams past the windows of all the passengers on a rush hour train, most of whom were filming the unnamed person on cell phones and posting to Instagram, Twitter and Facebook, all before they were even identified. How would you have reacted to the push? Unsure of the answer? Get this DVD and the companion book.

Violence is happening all over the world, not just in the bad parts of town or the third world countries. If you do not have training in self defense, you need to study this material. If you do have training or a martial arts background, you need it even more, to protect your self from having had to protect yourself. Life is not fair or just, so you must do everything in your power to live and prosper. Just this week a prison guard was telling me about how they have to use light weight sticks or batons because they can be held libel if they hurt someone with a real stick. The prisoners on the other hand are allowed to work out in the weight room with heavy weights and are even allowed to have pharmaceuticals to enhance their muscle growth. Tell me this makes sense.

This material is important for anyone dealing with the public, police, military, homeland security, gangs, or martial arts schools. In the given times we live in, it is also important for anyone planning on going to college, an opening night movie of an adventure action film, the bank, or even the drug store.",1428969600,3,3454,4.564516129032258

Rory Miller goes into the dynamics of the ""monkey-dance"" of how our primate brains get wrapped up in social violence, and also details how to avoid becoming victim to predatory violence.

Of special interest to me was the section where he pointed out some of the major problems people get into legally with self-defense - specifically, when your adrenalin takes over and you hurt someone before you can snap out of it, or in the case of martial artists, where you've trained a lethal or sub-lethal ""finishing"" technique in a military style, and carry it out automatically, before thinking of the damage you are doing to the other person.
