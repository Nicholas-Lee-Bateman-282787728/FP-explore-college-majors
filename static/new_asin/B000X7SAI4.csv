2998735,4,B000X7SAI4,Great old movie featuring Cab Calloway and a host of great black actors and actresses. A wonderful look at times gone by in the movie industry.,1396051200,,143,4.538461538461538
2998736,3,B000X7SAI4,"It was fun! The costumes may not have been the last word, to say nothing of the sets. And yet there is just something so  watchable about Cab. He's quiet the guilty pleasure!",1383436800,,174,4.2727272727272725
2998737,5,B000X7SAI4,"I am a fan of Jenny Legon. In fact, I was in her performing dance group many years ago in los Angeles.",1369008000,,102,3.6818181818181817
2998738,4,B000X7SAI4,"Cab Calloway, leader of one of the most successful hepcat swing ensembles of the Harlem Renaissance, stars as himself in this flimsily plotted showbiz revue.  Calloway fans will definitely want to check this film out, although no one should expect much in the way of great drama or filmmaking.  It's all just an excuse to show Cab and his band strutting their stuff, which is cool, since he was definitely one of the great showmen of his time.  The production quality of the film isn't great, though -- the acting is pretty stiff, and the ""scenes"" barely exist, hastily stuffed in between the wall-to-wall musical performances (some of which are clumsily dubbed, others which seem to have been filmed live).  Also, the plot is a little troublesome -- the story opens with Calloway in an apartment room, bossing around his girlfriend, Minnie (the Moocher, of course) and slapping her down when she back-talks him.  Minnie's jealous of Calloway's female business manager, Nettie, a ""high-class"" bourgeois woman -- and when Cab won't drop the other woman, Minnie goes off as a woman scorned, brewing up trouble for Cab and his pals.  The race, class, and gender issues are disturbing from a modern vantage point, but like all the dramatic aspects of this film, have to be taken with a grain of salt.  Really it's all about the music... Oh, and the dancing.  The last third of this hour-long film features the Cab Calloway nightclub act in full swing, which means some truly amazing tap dancing and leggy chorus girls.  Leave the PC issues aside, and this is a great cultural artifact.",1046476800,7,1581,4.825925925925926

8227126,2,B000X7SAI4,"From what I can tell, Minnie's entire purpose was to be abused. This short rather bummed me out, there was not much of a plot and I ended up skipping over some of the music as it was not his best.",1489968000,,196,3.8048780487804876
8227127,2,B000X7SAI4,It has a poor plot and not the greatest acting. Music is OK.,1468540800,,60,3.6923076923076925

8227133,4,B000X7SAI4,"Bad lip sync, stilted acting and violence again women. The music is great and Cab is amazing but it's not perfect and didn't age well. It's a strange time capsule from an ancient time. Enjoyable but odd.",1416441600,,203,4.513513513513513
