8179180,3,B000NL3NX2,"I had just found out why this movie and the movie about the Battleship Yamato is so bad in translation.  It seems that Japan movie producers decided to outsource the translation of this movie and Otoka no Tachi Yamato to a company in China to do the translation in English.

The good points.  It is a Japanese film with Japanese actors.  The sets and design and locations are great.  The choreography in the fight scenes are excellent.  The story is already known to me and the movie portrays closely to what I remember reading including the characters and their development.

I cannot give this the 5 star rating it deserves because the translations is so badly done.  There are missing words and mispelled words.  Also the reference that come from China is both hilarious and insulting.  Instead of saying that you have strong swordsmenship, the translation comes out that you have strong Whushu (A form of Chinese Martial Arts.  And instead of bringing the sword to the Emperor in Kyoto, (Which is where he is living during the Ashikage Shogunate, and you can actually hear the word Kyoto being pronounced) the translation comes out as bringing the sword to the Divine Emperor in Bejing.  This is a direct insult to Japan who have been enemies of China since the actual Ashikage Shogunate (1200's) to the 1600's due to two attempted invasions by China from both Genghis and Kubalai Khan...  The viewer should be informed of this.",1297209600,2,1432,4.772357723577236
