8691710,1,B00QJN33OM,"As a huge fan of the original ""Mad Max"" films, I was curious to check out one of the many early 80's rip offs from Italy. Sadly, this film is simply a boring and cheap attempt to mimic the ""The Road Warrior"" with nothing remotely interesting or memorable. Recommended for completists only",1443657600,,288,4.5576923076923075
8691711,5,B00QJN33OM,"This is such a cool movie with an equally cool soundtrack.
Kinda like Mad Max italian style with lots of slow mo crashes and explosions.
An electronic soundscape that speeds the movie along through the dirt and rocks.
I love everything about it!",1432944000,,245,4.72093023255814
8691712,3,B00QJN33OM,"Exterminators of the Year 3000 is the story of a second-rate Mad Max character named Alien. In this Spanish-Italian rip-off of The Road Warrior, Alien travels the wasteland in search of water that he can sell to become rich. Along the way he meets up with a kid and a woman who eventually help him defeat a gang of desert raiders.

There are some great schlock moments to savor here. If you're feeling a bad movie night, I highly recommend this for Mad Max fans and lovers of Italian 80s cinema. Have a few drinks and enjoy this with some friends. There are plenty of laughable moments and opportunities to riff the film for taking itself so seriously. Dont spoil it for yourself if you're interested. Its worth it.",1432684800,,715,4.542635658914729
8691713,3,B00QJN33OM,"With the release of MAD MAX and its follow up THE ROAD WARRIOR low budget studios jumped on the band wagon making post-apocalyptic films like crazy. The majority of these came from Italy, a country known to latch on to various genres that were big making them their own. So when this movie was released fans of the genre flocked to theaters showing the film. It might not have been playing at enough screens to make a dent financially but it did well enough to have several more films released with the same theme going forward.

After nuclear war has made most of the world a barren desert wasteland people form packs trying to survive. Most are the angry, warrior type groups seen in movies like this. They wear the most outrageous outfits that seem to have nothing to do with their environment and spout various forms of headbands and accoutrements that simply make them look terrifying to the normal scavenger on the road. But they aren't the only ones out there.

Another group has banded together to do their best to continue the survival of mankind. Gathered in a well-protected fortification they have greenhouses held in caves within. But their water supply is running low and if they cant find any soon all of the plants will die and with them this ragtag group. The father of one young boy has already gone in search of water never to return. Now his son sets out to follow in his fathers footsteps, recruiting a loner he come across named Alien.

A loner by choice Alien really doesnt want to help the group at all. Hes more concerned about getting back his car, a specially modified ride that he stole from the leader of the motorcycle gang thats been terrorizing anyone on the road. But the young boy and Alien eventually find an engineer that Alien knows as well as his helper. When they learn that the boy has an idea of where water can be found they decide to help. Alien still wants to run off but has second thoughts. Before the end of the film one group will face off against the other, some will live while others die and the future of the world will be decided.

The first thing to know about these movies made in Italy is that there was no expense too great for them to put their stories on film. Thats because they had little to no expense to work with. But that didn't stop them from making some decent action/sci-fi films that are as enjoyable today as they were when released. While the end results may not compare to the original films that inspired them as well as the Spaghetti westerns did to their inspiration, movies like this did result in some fun flicks.

The biggest part of the budget for these films went into the vehicles that were modified or blown up in one way or another. Second on that list was the screenplay that put it all in motion. While all involved do a great job the actors were further down the list than these two items and it doesnt matter. As I said, all involved do a great job with the material they have as well as the fact that many didn't even speak the same language as those around them. These films were noted for involving actors from around the world, language be damned.

The end result is a bit campy at times but a full blown action flick at others. The story is involving enough and the movie doesnt lose near as much in translation as many do. The fact that the depth of the plot isn't that deep helps with that. What the result is is a fun time for those who like the genre and for those looking for something different to watch. The blu-ray put out by Shout/Scream Factory is as clean as can be expected for a low budget film like this and should please those whove had to scrounge around for bootleg copies of the film or VHS copies. The extras are a bit lean but Im guessing there weren't many to be had with this one. If you're a fan though youll definitely want to add this one to your collection.",1431043200,,3875,4.382475660639778
8691714,3,B00QJN33OM,"BOTTOM LINE: Featuring at least a half dozen concepts lifted from other, much better films & TV shows all mashed together, EXTERMINATOR OF THE YEAR 3000 is a terminally silly film; yet another Italian knock-off designed to capitalize on the ESCAPE FROM NEW YORK/MAD MAX-inspired post-apocalyptic films that were all the rage back in the early 80's. With that being said, this film is a harmless, inoffensive way to burn a couple of hours on a rainy afternoon, or in the wee hours when you can't sleep. EotY3k has an odd charm about it and I'm glad I bought a copy for my B-movie collection. 4 STARS for the film, minus 1 STAR for the tepid Blu-ray presentation.

THE STORY (contains spoilers): Our future is pretty bleak in this film, as with all post-apoc movies. Here, water is an ultra-scarce commodity and people will kill for it. Kind of bass-ackwards that water is the most precious thing there is yet, for some odd reason, there's still plenty of gas to go around. And another thing...  for cars, trucks and motorcycles that are supposed to be 1000 years old, they all still run pretty dang well. Just sayin' is all. The film's main characters all have names like Trash, Alien and Crazy Bull. Don't think about things here too much or you'll just end up hurting your brain for no good reason.

THOUGHTS: I quite enjoyed this dubbed post-nuke actioner back in the day... recalling it as a rough around the edges ""Road Warrior"" clone with a cool story and crazy intense stunt work. My enthusiasm & affection for this film were clearly a case of ""rose-colored glasses"" at work. Honestly, it's just plain silly. But that's alright! I have a unabashed fondness for low-budget B-films, so I can forgive quite a lot. I enjoy these kinds of films for what they are rather than what they aren't. Take for instance the car stunts of EXTERMINATOR OF THE YEAR 3000. Oh my. What seemed ambitious, well-executed and hair-raising back in the day when I first caught this on VHS is actually anything but. Watching now, it's painfully obvious that those crazy vehicles are moving a LOT slower than I remembered. The intended visual intensity & kinetic energy of the sequences lost a lot of their ""oomph"" when I realized that all the stunt vehicles were moving only slightly faster than the floats in your average homecoming parade. LOL

THE BLU-RAY: After years of hoping, I was tickled to finally be able to pick up this corny old Road Warrior rip-off... and in hi-def, too! But hang on there gang. Don't get too excited just yet, because the transfer ain't all that great. In fact, it looks more like a DVD in terms of picture quality: soft focus, over-saturated colors and occasional pixelation & artifacting. Soundmix is solid and even at least, but there isn't much else to cheer about. The print looks to have been over-tweaked with DNR (Digital Noise Reduction) processing as a more cost-effective means of dealing with dirt, scratches, etc. instead of the more time-intensive (= expensive) frame-by-frame / by hand restoration. But then you have to ask yourself ""Why would anyone bother spending a single dime trying to spruce up an obscure old film as goofy as this?"" Beats me either. In Shout! Factory's defense they did not do any of the mastering themselves. They simply struck prints from the source materials they received from their Italian connections. Regardless, the transfer definitely leaves much to be desired. It's a bummer that the hi-def release of EXTERMINATORS OF THE YEAR 3000, fizzled rather than dazzled.",1429401600,3,3523,4.799011532125206
8691715,4,B00QJN33OM,"Scream Factory digs even deeper than usual with their latest hi-def offering of the sci-fi / apocalyptic Exterminators of the Year 3000. Director Jules Harrisons (aka Giuliano Carnimeo) low-budget Italian / Spanish blend of The Road Warrior and Death Race blows up all over the screen with exciting car crashes and chases. To add even more camp to the movie, the most ridiculous dialogue youll ever hear is overdubbed as half the cast speaks English and the others shout their lines in their native tongues.

In Exterminators of the Year 3000, the post-apocalyptic earth is a desert and water is the most precious substance of all. A band of survivors must turn to a mysterious stranger (Robert Iannucci) to battle a ruthless gang of motorcycle psychos for control of the wasteland and the water. Can their reluctant savior defeat the sadistic outlaws and get the water back home before their supply runs out?

Every part of Exterminators of the Year 3000 invokes images of other end-of-the-world films of the 1970s and 1980s. The demolition derby jousting and destruction is obviously heavily influenced by Mad Max, The Road Warrior, and the original Death Race 2000. The survivors compound, water plant, and other locations are extremely reminiscent of the ones seen in Logans Run and Battle for the Planet of the Apes.

Anti-hero Alien looks like he walked off the set of Megaforce wearing Barry Bostwicks hair and headband combined with Peter Hunters costume from Spacehunter: Adventures in the Forbidden Zone. Alicia Moros wardrobe and makeup department appear to have watched episodes of Battlestar Galactica and studied Farrah Fawcetts hairstyle in Saturn 3 to get their inspiration. Head bad guy Fernando Bilboa looks as if he was given permission to raid the left-over wardrobe from The Road Warrior for his outfit.

Scream Factory gives more bonus material than one would expect for such an obscure movie as Exterminators of the Year 3000. Audio commentary is provided by Actor Robert Iannucci. He also provides a detailed interview where he talks about his involvement in the making of the movie and shares his experiences working with the other actors. TV spots are included as well.

Although its nowhere near as graphic as movies of this nature would be today, Exterminators of the Year 3000 is rated R. It contains violence and gore, profanity, alcohol use by a minor, and frightening and intense scenes. The scene of a young boy downing beer after beer as a pain killer might offend some. One other sequence has our heroes battling mutants that resemble the deformed ones from Beneath the Planet of the Apes.

Exterminators of the Year 3000 is the perfect film for those who have ran out of Mad Max and Death Race flicks to watch. Its a B-movie to top all B-movies that conjures up the same tingles and giggles you get when watching anything Roger Corman produced or directed in the 1970s and 1980s. With the release of Mad Max: Fury Road so close on the horizon, I cant think of a more fitting time for audiences to enjoy this little known cult classic.",1426464000,3,3070,4.894230769230769
8691716,3,B00QJN33OM,"After the global success of the 2nd Mad Max movie titled ""The Road Warrior"" here in the states, the Italian film industry at that time started churning out dozens of cheap Mad Max ripoffs to cash in on another film's success. One of those films was 1983's ""Exterminators of the Year 3000"" which has received a bluray release courtesy of the awesome folk at Scream Factory. Whereas gasoline was the ingredient that the world had ran out of in Mad Max, in ""Exterminators of the Year 3000"" the world has ran out of water. The film was like so many other cheap Italian knockoffs made on the cheap and that is a big part that adds to the charm of films of this particular ilk. It doesn't make hardly any sense plot wise and features an abrupt ending that makes even less sense. The film is a bit too long and could have been trimmed up easily by about 20 minutes of so which would have helped it. It's not my favorite Mad Max ripoff but is still a decent little time waster.

As for the bluray quality, the film is presented in 1.78:1 widescreen and the picture quality shows that the film didn't receive any kind of frame by frame restoration. Detail is moderate but the film doesn't feature any compression artifacts and this is the best by far the film has ever looked so fans should be happy. The sound only makes use of the front channels but is mixed well. Extras include any interview with the main star of the film  along with an informative and fun commentary track featuring the same actor. Overall you could do worse than this film but it does what it sets out to do and is worth checking out overall.",1425859200,5,1607,4.37123745819398
